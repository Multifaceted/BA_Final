0,Kennedy ..,"New York, NY",28,14,785,4.0,10/24/2018,"The Continental is closing.  Four stars because I am going to miss it.When the McDonalds went up next door I remember thinking that was the beginning of the end.  Since then even RMcD has abandoned this location and left developers to replace every inch of the block with mind numbing monotonous modernity or numb minded modern monotony.  The prospectus isn't clear which. The four stars are for what it was.The Continental is just a shell. Now obligatorily tattooed employees bide their time softening the punk saturated walls for the wrecking ball by playing the Beatles.  Not even the good stuff. Ringo.  Is this St Marks Place New York City or an Old Navy in Branson?  Thank you Arlene's Grocery among a few surviving others for for blasting NYC Punk music so loud that you can only hear ""PBR""  and not ""what craft brew do you  have on tap?"".  A couple of weeks ago I was at Fraunce's Tavern and even they were playing the Clash and the Ramones.  The four stars because it was good enough for Iggy Pop so I can almost forgive him for being in a cadillac commercial.Good: Tuesday the place was unusually clean, even the bathrooms. Take advantage of the drink specials.  Bad: At least three tap beers were so sour they should have been wearing berets.  The taps will never again be cleaned so stick with bottles.The four star are because one day people will slide past this area, Star Magic / The Cube / Trash and Vaudeville, and  vaguely remember that this was once a pretty cool place.",1,1,1

We immediately left each time !!!!!!! No more trying this place out. Service wasn't consistent anyway. Just read the other low score reviews if you do t believe me. After years later I stand by this statement. Never coming back here.,11,6,6

I can't believe it hasn't been sued out of existence already, especially with some reviews of out right assault. Seriously, read them. Good riddance shithole!",,,
6,Waheda I.,"Queens Village, NY",92,253,398,3.0,12/9/2017,"I don't hate it nor do I love it. Neutral. 1. Cash only. ATM next to the bar.2. 6 shots for $12 plus mandatory order of beer for $5 (total $17 for the deal)3. Bar counter is sticky. Idk why. Poor maintenance. 4. Around 9pm they take away all the chairs. You better find a table in the back or drink standing. 5. Very packed bar so you're brushing up against people.My overall opinion, you come for some quick shots and leave. Not the place to hang out.",3,,
7,Abhinav S.,"Hoboken, NJ",123,3,1,1.0,3/27/2018,"This is the only racist place I have seen in the city. So last night around 11pm me and my friend went to this bar and the black security guard told us that you people can't get in. When I asked him what does he mean by you people and asked to talk to his manager or someone responsible here he replied 'go f*ck yourself and eat curry and started abusing badly'. He was doing all that because of the color of my skin. I honestly don't understand why he has so much anger towards my community, maybe his wife ran out with some Indian/Pakistani guy while he was busy eating curry but still its not justified to take out that anger on the entire community.If the manager or any prominent person from the Continental is following this yelp page then please do something about it. I'm also gonna file a legal complaint to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else",17,4,2
8,Kayla L.,"Manhattan, NY",54,136,108,2.0,4/13/2018,"My things have changed... last time I was at continental was about 2 yrs ago.The place is closing and moving elsewhere (unknown yet) on July 1 2018. Apparently the entire block was sold.Anyway, yeah no more 5 shots for $10. It is now 6 for $12. Which is still a decent deal but the portions have changed, even down to the type of shot cups they use. Hard to explain, but you're not getting as much liquor as before. And we ordered cuervo. As a loyal cuervo abuser, whatever I had this night was not the cuervo I am used to.There is also now a mandatory drink purchase that has to come with any order of shots. Which I could be wrong about, but I don't remember it being the norm before.The owner must be attempting to cash out a little more before he finally closes shop which is kinda sh*tty. I've only visited a handful of times and its always a good spot to pregame, but not anymore I guess. I see all the complaints about the bouncers here. And in all my visits, Ive never had an issue and I'm a POC. Take it how you will.",5,,

Unfortunately, one of our friends could not get in because his pants were considered to be ""sagging"". Growing up in a predominant Black community, My friends and I laughed at first and tried to calmly understand what the bouncer was trying to explain to our friend. Our friend's pants were not even halfway down his butt, let alone, underneath his butt, to consider him ""sagging"". The bouncer said that because my friend walked up sagging his pants, even if it was corrected and pulled up to his waist, he could not get in - and that this is the  manager's policy. Definitely B.S. Dear Manager - Do BETTER!",4,,

Opt for the honey jack anything else is cheap liquor. Honestly this place reminds me of the good ole college days. Keep it real, stay a few mins only to savor the cheap alc then move on to something more classy and age appropriate. They also have some false advertising throughout the establishment so beware. Also bouncers are not nice, so make sure you and your party are cognizant enough to get inside. Cheers!",,2,

Updated review","Trashy place deserves to be closed down. Bartenders are racist and refuses to serve. Doesn't serve food here, so go somewhere else that treats the customer right. Don't forget, they don't serve water. Don't say ""literally"" because they will kick you out.Rude and racist bartenders, and watered down alcohol. Come here if you like all that.",12,3,3
12,Shayla C.,"Newark, NJ",366,42,73,3.0,3/10/2018,"This place has unbeatable prices. 6 shots for $12 (with the purchase of a beer) or 5 shots for $12 if not. You can pick anything you see on the shelf and they have everything from Absolut to Johnnie Walker to Fireball to Jamestown to Jack Daniels to Stoli to Tito's. Only reason I don't give this place more stars is because I've had such mixed experiences with the staff in the past (often unpleasant). Also, this place is good for a chill vibe to talk with friends and get cheap drinks, but I wouldn't say make this your main stop if you're looking for a fun time. That being said, it's closing soon (can't say I'm sad) so get your $2 premium shots while you can!",1,,

16,Dana M.,"Brooklyn, NY",92,153,93,2.0,9/24/2017,"This is the place to come for cheap(er) drinks before bar hopping. I've been here twice and both times I've asked myself why I'm there. Well it's because they have a shot deal, 6 for $12 if you buy a beer. I tried to do the deal last night and the bartender explained that it didn't quality, a Stella and 6 shots. I asked her to explain it to me because I was paying $17 when I should have been paying $12. She looked at me and rudely said ""What do you want me to explain?"" I am hard of hearing and can't yell to save my life so I felt defeated and walked away. We snatched a small table in the back. The demographic was all mixed. The lights make your beer look like urine. If you don't scream you won't be able to hear the person next to you. I went to the bathroom twice just to get away from the noise for a second. I don't know why Continental rubs me the wrong way. I will not be back.",4,1,

Fine ill just ""tip"" you ladies since you all be jobless soon with fuck up customer service like this. Ask for limes to go with the tequila shots, ""no lime!"" ( threw us an bottle of salt).

19,Cory S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0,1.0,1/5/2018,"I've always disliked this bar, but my friends are cheap and like coming here, so I've stopped in for shots from time to time. However, my friends and I will NEVER come back again after I was sexually harassed by a bouncer here a couple months ago.A few friends and I were standing on the sidewalk outside the bar, right on the curb near the street, in NO WAY blocking the sidewalk or anything like that. It was Halloween weekend, so there were plenty of other groups right next to us who were actually blocking the way. We were not even drunk, as we had just gotten to the neighborhood.Well, there was this older white bouncer wearing a (racist) triangular Asian-style hat, and he approached my group of friends, who were only standing there trying to figure out which bar we should go to (we weren't even planning on going to Continental). Again, I have to restate that we were nowhere near the bar or entrance and not in anyone's way.This bouncer comes over and starts immediately yelling at us to move, using foul language and being really rude. I told him that there was no reason why we couldn't stand on the sidewalk as everyone else was doing, minding our own business. He started to get aggressive and put his whole body up against my back, refusing to move from behind me. I was EXTREMELY uncomfortable and told him not to touch me. He responded, ""I'll touch you wherever the fuck I want."" This was an absolutely disgusting and offensive thing to say so I started yelling at him to get away from me, and my friends intervened. He left, but not before saying, ""Why would I want to touch you anyway? Just look at you,"" as if I were this ugly creature. I was so shaken up by his behavior that we left.This is UNACCEPTABLE behavior and I can't believe Continental employs this horrible person. If anyone from the bar needs any further proof of what happened, message me, I'd be happy to help get him fired.",10,2,
20,Aja T.,"Harrison, NY",80,14,0,2.0,1/13/2018,"I've gone to this bar on and off for the past six years and to this day, I still have no idea how I feel about it. It's always a hit or miss and changes like a girl going through pms. Some days it's good; the bartenders are nice and work hard, the bouncers give us no problems, the drinks will be good, etc. But then there are a lot of times when it's completely horrid. There have been a handful of times where my group wouldn't be let in because of a dress code. I still to this day have no idea what's allowed or not because it's always different. I feel like the bouncers wake up one day and say 'you know what? Fuck people with sneakers' and condemn all sneaker-wearers from entering their sacred house of cheap alcohol. I usually go during times when it's not crowded and sometimes the bartenders seem disinterested and have a bit of an attitude. I remember back when it was 5 shots for $10 and now it's 5 shots and a beer for $17. I haven't been to this place in a while and wasn't aware of the change, so when I was taken aback and asked since when? The bartender cooly states 'since always.' First of all, no... but I digress. In conclusion, it's an ok bar. You get what you pay for. I don't hate it, but I don't particularly like it either. It's one of those things you'd have to experience for yourself. Perhaps check it out if you're in the area, but I wouldn't recommend as a main event.",5,3,

She was an older lady and wasn't even dressed appropriately for her age. Yeah I understand it's a bar but please do not wear a see through tank top with a bright bra. I was also asking her a question and she did not give me her full attention either. She kept talking to the bouncer very loudly and had snarky attitude overall. The only thing good about this place is the 5 for 12$ shots. BUT IT USED TO BE 10$!! And they recently changed the prices so I was a little disappointed when I walked in the other day. Overall, I'll only come here for the shots but now that the prices increase and the bartender is rude - I don't know that I will",8,,1

Me and my beau were roaming around the area after hitting up the Barcade happy hour and came across this place. It was totally empty....ok, maybe a handful of people. But what drew us in was the 5 shots for $10. Figured since we were leaving the city to go back to Brooklyn, might as well get a few shots in and enjoy the A/C!The bartender was SUPER nice and attentive, yes, I know the fact that she probably wasn't busy had something to do with it, but she knew we weren't from around here and was very patient with our million questions. We decided to add two ""pickleback"" shots for $1 each because it reminded us of our first time taking the pickleback shot with fireball in Amsterdam. We didn't take it with fireball this time though because the bartender suggested just regular whiskey....good call. After splitting the shots, we couldn't pass up on the $3 glass of merlot before heading out. And by glass, I mean it was like a pint! Anyway, we had a good time here. Oh! The only thing that annoyed me was that the security wouldn't let us in with our brand new unopen bottle of water so we had to chug it. But whatever.",2,,1

The first group was all hispanic and besides being carded we went inside without a problem, next time was a mixed group black/spanish/white and were also let in without a problem. I do want to point out that the second encounter was during the week (a Monday) and perhaps that is a reason why there was no issue getting in.Overall, thankfully my experience here was good.",1,,

31,Christopher M.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,12,0,1.0,7/23/2017,"Decided to check the reviews on here to see if they were still a racist establishment and sure enough they are.

Bouncer said ""regulars only tonight"" and then let in a few guys that were white and dressed like business men. We were wearing dress shirts and dress pants so attire was over dressed for a dive bar. Just wanted to make sure others know this place is a joke of an establishment.

I myself, like many others, have been denied entry here for whatever reason, but it never stopped me from coming back. Beers are cheap, the drinks are cheap, and the shots are cheap. Awesome place to pregame. I hate the fact that they're closing, but with NYC evolving, I'm not surprised.",,,
33,Peoples H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",18,8,0,2.0,5/22/2018,They only take CASH. They have an ATM inside which cost $2 but it's an inconvenience that it's 2018 and they don't have a credit card reader. They are also very particular with who they let in. I stopped going because the bouncer doesn't like letting guys in if girls aren't in the group. Great deal if you're looking for quick round or two of shots. Really spacious and roomy. Dance floor and one TV in the back. But that's only if they let you inside to begin with,,,

This is an irresponsible and dangerous policy and when we questioned how this could be a real policy at a bar we were directed to a sign above the bar confirming, ""no free water."" They were not polite about it.

36,Jessie B.,"Queens, NY",213,213,146,1.0,12/10/2016,"This place is extremely gimmicky and in my opinion, not worth the aggravation and rudeness you will experience from the staff here. Came in on a Friday night for my brothers birthday with a group of 5, it wasn't very crowded and we were able to get a table- fine. On first entering we had no issues with the bouncers (you will be denied entry if you're a male and your pants sag even a bit) because everyone was mindful of pulling up their pants and having valid ID. Here's the real deal- yes you can get 5 non watered down shots of liquor for $10 as advertised - drinks are $8 yes $8 not $4 as advertised online and in signage.The drinks were just ok, nothing to rave about.Here's where things took a complete left turn. This place is small so trying to cram 5 chairs into a table can we a challenge- out of nowhere a large male staff member yells ""we get crowded on Fridays"" and forcefully pushed my chair into the table, fine whatever.A few moments later my brother, myself and a friend stepped out for some air, I asked the bouncer if I could go back in and he assured me that I could. 5 minutes later he denies my brother entry because his pants were sagging even though his bag was still inside! And he denied me entry because I was in his words ""a little tipsy"" spoiler alert I was not.

They were shutting down people at the door left and right. One bouncer is in a ridiculous hat and looks like a busted version of Raiden from mortal combat. I went there with two attractive girls just because they had a crazy drink special on a banner as we were walking by. The bouncer told us that the bar was only for regulars and we couldn't come in. It looked empty so we were shocked that they wouldn't want 3 attractive girls there to help this sorry place out. When my girlfriend didn't move fast enough off the line the other giant bouncer deciding to play tough guy and began arguing with her. I've never been shut down in places a million times better then this dump. I would never go back and warned all my friends about it don't waste your time!,5,3,
38,Jun C.,"New York, NY",26,176,107,1.0,11/9/2015,"If you somehow manage to get past the bouncers, then get in, pound your 5 shots for $10 (or any multiple of that), and get out.  This place itself epitomizes the ""dive bar;"" it's pretty filthy in here. For instance, the floors will bind, essentially on a molecular level, to the bottom of your shoes, so that your shoes and the bar fuse into one entity. That's how freakin sticky the floors are. Oh, and don't even get me started on the bathroom. Despite the reviews of mean bartenders, I haven't yet had a negative experience with the bartenders. There isn't much sitting room here, so there are constantly like 30 people jam-packed in front of the bar, waiting for their drinks or just standing around aimlessly because they have nowhere to lean or sit. The drinks themselves are fine, not too watered down (though they definitely do so a bit), and it's the cheapest bar in the city to get drunk at. My favorite shots here are definitely the kamikazes. Fun fact: the official Continental website even has a WHOLE PAGE dedicated to the owner (the dude in the Raiden hat) denying allegations of racism. These are actual words copied and pasted straight from the website: -""I refuse to let in saggy/baggy jean wearers white or black (mostly minorities of course)""- ""I hope this doesn't sound patronizing but someone's Race has always been irrelevant to me. My early and continued support of President Obama speaks for itself""...yea, I know, right? If you don't believe me, then see for yourself at their website.continentalnyc.com/doorp…",14,8,1

When we told her this she didn't believe us and gave us so much attitude, practically yelling ""HOW DO YOU THINK THIS BAR IS GOING TO MAKE ANY MONEY? SHOW ME WHO GAVE THAT FOR FREE"". She reminds me why I don't frequent places like this. The worst service with shady bartenders. Maybe if your bar wasn't rated so poorly, you would make more money.

At a bar that I went during my student days, which has since closed, the Hurricane cocktail was one of infamy that immobilized me and my friends, some of us among the best drinkers. Trying to test my limits (for the nth time), I ordered 5 shots of the cocktail. Nothing happened. I was on my feet and remembered everything I did. It's watered down. Granted if you spend more than $10 and drink a proportionate amount of shots, you and your wallet will end up getting destroyed regardless. if you're willing to get smashed, go somewhere else like The Thirteenth Step.",1,,

Updated review","What can I say, this bar lives up to it's motto of being the best place for pre/post game drinking and with the shots deal they have, it's hard to argue. 5 shots for $10 is a great deal if your trying to find your inner you before going to another bar or party lol. I would rather pay this price than $5 or $8 for a single shot -__- but mind you, the shots have to be the same liquor. it gets pretty busy fri-sat nights so stay cool when going through the sea of people to place your order. This place also shows movies and plays a couple of 90's-00's classic so stick around and dance to a few tunes while chugging shots with your group of pals or newly meet acquaintances :p  don't forget the jameson and vodkaaaaaa",6,1,2

I don't know why she felt so comfortable to be that way towards me and my guest just for walking in, but she's lucky I was in a good mood cause I could have damn near slapped her. First she told us cash only which was fine since the ATM was next door. Then she questioned if my friend paid or not even 10 minutes after our first and only round. We assumed it was because she didn't tip right away. Then I went to play music on the juke which she then told me not to because she had already personally placed a lot of songs on the queue.

Updated review","I would give this place zero stars if I could. I have been here a few times and each pervious time was really fun. The bar tenders were amazing. This time I was here with a group of people for the bars' ""7 shots and one drink"" deal and when the bar tender was asked what drink she recommended, we were answered with with an eye roll and ""I don't know what you want"" ... if we're asking for a recommendation why answer with negativity? You're a bar tender at a public bar. Anyway, we brushed it off and continued our night. About a half hour later we asked for another round and as my boyfriend was asking what drink the bar tender made, he was answered with ""please stop talking to me"" and was cut off because he had ""too much to drink"". We're asking you what drink you made me and you're not gonna to tell me? So he asks for the bar tenders name and we were kicked out. I approached the bar, by our shots that were poured but not taken (notice she gave us the shots, took our money, and THEN kicked us out). I asked the bar tender first what happened but she wouldn't tell me, answering with ""Ask your boyfriend"" which I don't understand.. if he's cut off and kicked out, YOU tell me your SOBER version of what happened and I'll leave. Then I asked for our money back since we didn't even get to take the shots and were cut off & kicked out, but they refused. Then the bouncer came over and was kicking us out as I'm asking the bar tender what happened... long story short this place obviously doesn't care since they have a two and a half star rating.They're deals are good but the bar tenders aren't worth it. Wouldn't come back here if my life depended on it.",6,,

The owner walks around in a teepee hat and as long as you leave him alone and don't touch the hat he stays to himself. When I went there last we had a really pretty blonde mermaid like bartender... complete sweetheart. Bouncers usually don't give me any problems. CASH ONLY so be prepared. The only really awesome thing about this place is how reasonable there drinks are. There shot deals are insane and lots of beers on drafs( angry orchid, Stella, Guinness etc.) all for 3.00 dollars during happy hour. Some beers like bud light draft are $2.50. Normally I think a mug of Guinness will cost $5.00. On top of that, Five shots of anything for ten bucks? Where does that happen in NY? It's a place to go if you want to drink OR SHALL I SAY GET VERY MESSED UP, and not burn a hole through your Wallet with NYC prices. Don't use there bathrooms unless you get intoxicated and you're bladder is crying in despair...there not very ""appealing.""

So turns out the signs and pretty much all of the staff here are pretty surly.  So the atmosphere is pretty much a buzzkill as the jukebox was barely used so most of the time it was quiet enough to hear a pin drop. But then when you order your drink of Jameson and ginger ale and the bartender says $4--- everything stops: what did she just say??? Wine is $3--huh?? Every top shelf drink is beyond cheap. So yeah, it's a blackbox with tables and chairs in the back and they don't care if you bring in outside food.After checking the place out it dawns on me that this place has a history, both good and bad, that surpasses the drama surrounding it which could really make it an awesome place. Better marketing etc etc. But this is NYC and this place has its niche. It just wouldn't be a place I'd take anyone I was trying to impress.

They stated it was a new guy working the door that week. Needless to say my friend and I were of a certain ethnic group and they let about 10 people in after.

Us old folks arrived 11 o'clock on the dot. We walked between the velvet ropes to have our IDs check, and the bouncer grunted us onward. As soon as we stepped inside, our eardrums were blasted by Eminem so loud it could have made my bones shake. We surveyed the scene and saw nothing but bros and realized our friends weren't there yet. The music seriously was so loud, I couldn't even hear myself, and I couldn't stand staying there a second longer, so we peaced out.

I told him he should never talk to a woman that way, and all he did was keep yelling at me. We waited until he walked away from the door, and we felt safe enough to leave.

I mean this guy was so rude for no reason it honestly disgusted me. It even bothered a group of girls right next to me because his attitude was so unnecessary. (Shout out to them for being super nice to me and standing up for me!)Literally all I did was ask him where and if they have a bathroom there. It was SUPER packed and I couldn't se a sign plus I am pretty short. I didn't want to go pushing and shoving people because thats just not how I am. So I literally just asked "" Is there a bathroom?"" and ""If there is do you know where it is?"" he responds  "" If you were at Mcdonalds you would go find that bathroom.""(when i did try to find it) ""my kids go find the bathroom themselves."" ""Do you want me to hold your hand  to go to the bathroom."" Honestly if it is that hard to respond respectfully to a SIMPLE question then he shouldn't even have a job that involves interacting with people. He must really hate working there because he looked stank and miserable like he hated his  god damn life the whole time. Like why get a job knowing you will have to interact with people when you obviously lack  respect and communication skills. I can say who it wasn't. It was not the black guy with the beard (never had a problem with him) it was the black guy who was bald with no facial hair and a really round face. normally stands posted inside a few feet from where people walk in on friday nights.On the other hand i usually come during  happy hour  when I haven't seen that bouncer and every thing is okay. The bartenders earlier then 11pm are pretty nice and have good attitudes. The drink prices are cheap and vibes are okay.

As I was showing my ID, one of my friends had already went in and heading to the bar.

Gross.  I get it's a dive but that just make my $3 beer harder to drink.  They need to get that fixed.The bar tender looked pained to be serving. Lame.  But eh..... Cheap drinks I guess.

Tall bearded blonde guy and the guy posing as an Asian outside rejected my boyfriend from coming inside and used the excuse of his apparel when there is clearly no dress code because about 10 other people dressed crazy went ahead of us and they didn't give me any trouble. The only reason was because he was black but apparently they used saggy pants as an excuse when I don't even tolerate saggy pants on the men I date so my boyfriend wasn't sagging his pants and when we all saw he wasn't sagging the bouncer got loud.

At least in Manhattan. Things I don't like about this bar are plethoric: One of my friends several years ago ended up getting rejected at the door for apparently having ""too baggy blue jeans"". He's over 6 feet tall and African American. But he was wearing like a freaking sweater or button down and loafers and his jeans weren't that baggy. So the story goes. I wasn't there. But this IS NOT THAT KIND OF BAR where you have to get all FANCY. It's a CRAP HOLE. Out of solidarity no one came back for several years. Except for me. Because I'm an asshole and wasn't really aware this happened. But I haven't been back in at least 2 or 3 and honestly there's no reason why I should have come back. They don't like you lingering around here as well and will make you sit at a table if you have more than one person with you. They will also refuse to let you go up to the bar and accept that you are being forced into getting table service from a waitress. While you are at said table, some bouncer guy near the bathrooms will harass you for having ""too large of a bag"" and make you shove it under your said table. This is what I get for cheap shots. Speaking of ""cheap shots"", who remembers that great shit hole? Back to Continental, after getting some 'tude' I finally decided to order a jack and coke. I may as well get drunk now that I'm here and have done 3 shots. One of which got a yelling at to Steph P. by the bartender: ""We don't make baby guinesses. That's a too elaborate of a shot"". ""But it's only 2 different types of booze dumped on top of each other. . . . "" ""NO"". LAME. This turned into doing shots of Malibu. Ralph. Bottom line, I don't get this bar. They have fancy tv screens now which they did not used to have. The focus used to be on the music and hipsters jumping up and down with shot glasses. Now its trashy swanky. Not my thing.",3,,1

This place should have been our first stop but it was one of our last stops instead. If I could do it all over again, I would definitely pre-game here before heading to the more expensive bars around the area.

Well, maybe! But it is more of a pregaming hangout spot for me.I take away 1 star because bouncers are rude as f***.

I'm an Asian woman and my friend is a Hispanic man, neither of us with racially ambiguous complexions, and we both got in without any attitude or remarks from the bouncer. The real problem I had with this place was the high-and-mighty female bartender who treated us like we were infants fumbling over our first alcoholic drink. We got a total of 10 tequila shots (Jose Currero, they don't serve Patron for some dignified reason), and when my friend asked to chase it with ""something sweet"", bartender gave him an ill-disguised condescending look:  ""What do you mean? Like orange juice..?"" I stared at her because she had to be fucking with him. I've never (professionally) mixed a drink in my life and even I knew he meant some fruity-ish cocktail. I was about to speak up when he, embarrassed, clarified himself. The kind of vibe she gave off was so patronizing that I was genuinely glad to see her gone and someone else come on their shift. I keep reading about watered down shots. Maybe it depends on the liquor but we both thought it was just a little bit.

When I reassured him I would, he then asked me who my friend was I was meeting ( IT WAS CREEPY)  he didnt listen, I think he was possibly drunk, and I ended bolting out feeling completely harrassed.I tried calling this shit show like 5 times, no response.While I understand the no restroom policy unless a customer, and being weary, this was INSANE.DO NOT COME HERE.",4,1,

Returning here with friends for one of their birthday pre-games, I was promptly turned away at the door. The bouncer took my ID, said it was fake and if I didn't leave he'd call the cops. My ID is NOT fake, he didn't scan it or anything, just glanced at it. I demanded to speak to a manager or owner, and he said the same thing. At least once the other guy came over he gave back my ID. I was sure they were intent on stealing it.I was insulted that they said I was too young but I was terrified that they intended to steal my ID. I requested cops be called but they yelled at me to go so my friends and I did.I haven't been back to this bar since. I'm sure my experience was typical but it should still be known.",,1,

Got the baby face of a sparkly-eyed 16 year old in love. Yes, you heard that right. In LOVE...his name is Bailey's you see and he's sweet, smooth and Irish. He tastes great with Kahlua and wait - OMGOSH YOU GUYS!!! 5 shots of anything for only $10 at Continental?! They open at 4pm and don't have a bouncer at that time! Okay. Now I'm in love again and his name is Continental. This is the spot.Early 20s...So yeah, I'm 21 now. Finally I can't wait to show my ID at bars now so I can be all like, *BOOM* ""IN YOUR FACE, SUCKAAAAA!"". No, I've never really spoken like this, but in a fit of Ally McBeal-like rage I do in my head. You know what else I can do in my head? Math. Not complicated math, but the kind of math that's like, ""Man, 5 shots of anything for $10 comes out to approximately $2 a shot - we can mix shots too?!"". Man, math is delicious. Let's add!Mid 20s...Guys do we have to go to Continental tonight?! I mean, we've kinda sorta got jobs now and we can do nicer places like wine bars. More mature guys hang out at wine bars and I mean aren't we tired of only drinking to celebrate ""girl nights""? Oh...we're not? Kay. Let's walk down memory lane and visit Down the Hatch, USA instead then! Yeahhhhhh, $3 ""you call it"". So much better than shots...well...okay, we can do one round of shots. Wait what?! Our 6'5 African American friend can't join us because his jeans are too baggy and he has tattoos?! His tattoos aren't loud or crass, he's wearing a long sleeved button-down shirt!! His jeans aren't baggy at all, he's just tall AND he's wearing dress loafers?! This is St. Mark's place!! This bar is rich with historical punk well...HISTORY...what? You guys put up a red carpet and RED VELVET ROPE now after 7pm?! NO, THIS IS STUPID. I'M NEVER COMING BACK HERE AGAIN IN SOLIDARITY WITH MY ""GUY BESTIE"" BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE IGNORANT, RACIST AND BECOMING EVERYTHING THIS BAR WAS SET UP TO NOT REPRESENT. 70s Punks everywhere must be crying...no wait...they're not crying. Punks don't cry. You guys are now pathetic and you're like a parody of everything St. Mark's place now represents and it's disgusting. THIS ISN'T MEAT PACKING AND YOU'RE NOT A YUPPIE LOUNGE. We're definitely taking our money over to Down the Hatch where they know their flaws and their spot on the totem pole of NYC bars and they embrace it rather than pretending to be something they're not. Late 20s...Remember when we used to have good times at Continental? Yep. Those were the days. We were carefree, beginning adulthood and poised to take over the ""real world"" by storm. Also, remember when they were cool and not filled with wannabe preppies that wear 3 polos at once all with popping colors so that you can see that they're wearing 3 different colored polos? LAMESAUCE. Man, $10 for 5 shots is still a really good deal...but so is that awesome wine bar where everything is ""buy one get one free"" until 8pm. Let's go there...Early 30s...Yeahhhhh...remember when our 6'5 ""guy bestie"" was a really great guy? He was smart, fun as well, witty, knowledgeable and possessed a heart of gold? We used to have so many good times and in our late-teens and early 20s we used to get the party started at Continental because of that ""shots deal"". That's pretty much the only thing about Continental that hasn't changed...I stopped going there because they were becoming lame and I didn't like how they treated him...it was wrong, especially when bouncers were the same height, tattooed and wearing MUCH baggier pants. Such hypocrisy. Oh, what's that? You have a friend visiting from Costa Rica who has never been to NYC? Yeah sure, let's show her the Continental ""shots special"". I'm only doing one round though because I now have adult obligations and a man to get to who I want to do adult things with. Oh - my former ""guy bestie"" is on his way despite this place treated him like shit for years? Yeah, cool - definitely my signal to hit the road. Also, there's TABLE SERVICE here now? I don't need a waitress, this is a shit bar.______________________________________________________^ That last one was my reasoning for coming here the last time I was here. Hopefully it will be just that - my last time. 3 stars, ONLY for their ""shot deal"" and because of the memories I had here in my younger years...although now they have a large projection screen in the back with sports (WHAT?! CONTINENTAL?!

Did we even pay attention about the setting, style and decor of the place? Honestly, not. Once we emptied our shot glasses, we're just getting ready for other establishments in the near by area.

Some seating in the back, and the place smells like the well with a hint of vomit.Service 3/5You're buying shots. Don't expect to share life stories with the bartenders because they have to pour 50 more shots over the next few minutes.

Everyone was staring and it was so embarrassing and humiliating for my friend AND our group. This idiotic bouncer kept screaming and my friend had to be escorted out.

157,Marlyn M.,"Bronx, New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,4/9/2017,"I honestly don't know where to begin with my review. This is my first yelp review ever, and I just HAD to write something for this spot. I've been here a couple of times so I know that it wasn't a one time bad experience thing...HORRIBLE staff. Just do yourself a favor and look at all the recent reviews and trust them! The staff will literally curse at you in your face for no reason. The shots are watered down, so don't let the 10 for 5 deal fool you, you will end up wasting money and not even get the slightest intoxication from it. There are other WAY BETTER bars around, I am just trying to save your night.~~~~My recent and LAST experience:~~~~Came here last night with a fairly large group for a birthday event. It was our last stop of a night of bar hopping. We arrived around 1AM and it was completely dead for a Saturday night. The bar itself is very catchy to the eye. Music is alright. After some difficulty getting in, we sat down, had some drinks and were taking pictures. Now, if you've been here before you know about the square in the floor by the stairs where you are NOT allowed to stand on. If you haven't been here before, beware, there's a section on the floor outlined where you are not allowed to stand on or you will catch attitude from one of the bouncers. MIND YOU, this section/ square, is in the middle of the dance floor and on the way to the stairs to the bathroom. Now I get maybe that section is ""restricted"" for safety reasons to avoid someone falling down the stairs, but if you are simply standing on it for longer than a second then you will be told to move. So what happens...? One of my friends pulls a chair out the table thats next to this ""restricted"" area and sits on it. One of the legs of the chair is slightly on this square on the floor. Next thing I know, this bouncer whom I haven't seen from the other times I've had gone, starts SCREAMING and CURSING out my friend. My friend and everyone else in the entire bar were shocked from the bouncer's reaction. He started being very vulgar to my friend, yelling stuff that I am uncomfortable to even share in this review. Me and my group immediately got up since we honestly thought the bouncer was about to get physical. The bouncer dragged my friend out the bar, mind you my friend didn't even say one word back and the bouncer was just yelling ""YOU CAN'T SIT HERE.... F' this F' that. YOU PEOPLE think you can do whatever you want""...I have never in my life seen a bouncer lose his cool over something so trivial as that. He then kicks out my whole group and it was just so humiliating as we were literally taking pictures having a good time. Even the other bouncer in the bar was like ""wth dude?"" to the bouncer who just snapped. We got an apology from one of the staff, as it seems if stuff like this usually happens... my question is why is it still happening then? Anyways, we went outside away from the front of the bar and the bouncer is still yelling and cursing... I was so annoyed and distraught about what happened, since my group of friends usually go out and this is the FIRST time we ever gotten kicked out of a bar. I demanded to speak to a manager but they wouldn't let me. I was able to speak to another staff just to try to provide some suggestions for them in the future since we weren't even interested anymore in going back, and they were saying how its not a public space so they can kick out or let who ever they want in... (Which i've seen from other reviewers here that they were being discriminated on just because of their accents or appearances.) Anyways, I wasn't getting anywhere with them, the bouncer went back in because he was getting annoyed that I just wanted to speak to someone.Long story short, it is honestly not worth your stress or night. Don't come here for your birthday. Don't come here with a group. Don't come here for the drinks that sound amazing but are juiced/watered. There are other bars around St. Marks that have better deals and WAY nicer and attentive staff. For example, Bar None have good deals and better drinks. Honestly ANY OTHER BAR is better than this one.",2,,
158,Bria L.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,4/8/2017,"This bar is ridiculous ! The bartenders are rude . I am African American and I went to this bar with my brother and my non African friend . The bartender ( which was a Caucasian or Hispanic short female with dark brown hair ) served my friend with no problem at all . However when me and my brother came to get the shot deal she kept asking us if we were going to tip her which I found to be extremely rude I mean  why wouldn't we tip her ? She didn't ask my friend about any tips . I immediately became annoyed at the fact that for some odd reason she thought that out of all people WE wouldn't tip her , so I told her that if she kept asking I would not tip her . She then stated that if I didn't tip her she would not serve me and she begin taking back the shots that she had originally started to pour . After that she went to the other side of the bar and told the other bartenders not to serve me and my brother which really was an ugly thing to do . I stayed there for a couple of minutes trying to get the other bartenders attention to get a drink and they all ignored me and began serving other people . I am from a different state and I have never seen anything like this in my life . I am disgusted . I have everything on my camera and I'm contemplating on releasing it to social media so people can see how they treat their customers . The only thing holding me back is that besides the rude bartenders the place was actually pretty nice . However I will not be going there ever again. The Bartenders are drinking on the job and acting desperate for money . I do not like how I was treated ... all over a tip , if she would of just properly did her job I would of tipped her , however I find it extremely rude to ask multiple times if I would tip you",2,,
159,Kristen M.,"Manhattan, NY",228,26,2,1.0,4/10/2016,"DO NOT COME HERE!!! BOUNCERS ARE CRAZY AND READY TO ATTACK CUSTOMERS!! MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CARE!!! This is seriously the most unsafe bar in NYC!! The bouncer at the top of the ramp is literally out of his mind! My sister and I were at the bar last night for 5 minutes waiting for friends. This was at 9:10PM on a Saturday night and we were completely sober. After we realized they switched bars, we tried leaving the way we came into the bar. The bouncer at the top of the ramp, just put his hand out and didn't say anything. I was thinking maybe there is a limit to how many people can enter and leave, so I just waited in silence with my sister. Now mind you, we are two very petite pretty blonde girls just waiting to leave. Finally my sister asks ""Can we not leave here?"" He just stares at us. 20 seconds go by and we say ""We are confused, can we leave?"". He points to the bar, which my sister actually interpreted as the exit. My sister then tells him calmly ""Well you could have told us that"". He literally starts SCREAMING at the top of his lungs ""Are you disrespecting me, Are you disrespecting me!!!"" We proceed to exit even though being treated like this. He literally runs down the ramp SCREAMING ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY BAR. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE YOU DUMB FUCKING BITCHES"". I was literally scared for my life! I thought this bouncer was going to hit me the way he was screaming at my sister and I. Let me remind you, we are SOBER petite blonde women and we were just treated this way. When we get to the exit. All the bouncers were super confused on why this bouncer was behaving like this. We asked to speak to a manager, they said we were speaking to him. He saw the situation, but the OWNER has instructed the bouncer at the ramp to act that way. He refused to give us the bouncers name or his name. He said the only way to complain & have the owner understand the way we were treated was to call the bar tomorrow. He told us they have had many problems with that bouncer in the past. While we are talking to this senior bouncer manager, this bouncer is still screaming, now at the doorway, ""GET THOSE DUMB BITCHES OUT OF HERE""Honestly no bouncer should EVER be screaming at anyone trying to leave a bar. The bar was not packed and it was quiet enough that he could have easily explained where the correct exit was. The fact that this bouncer called two sober pretty blonde girls ""FUCKING DUMB BITCHES"" is inexcusable. No one should be treated in such a hostile manner at the bar. I thought bouncers were supposed to protect us? The bouncer at the ramp at Continental has me scared for my life. The way he was screaming at us, had me scared he would hit me next. He is literally insane and acts like a wild animal. I beg of all people reading this review, STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BAR IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE!!! Honestly this bar is a lawsuit waiting to happen with a bouncer like that at the ramp! So if you know a lawyer, you should head here and record how they treat you!!

I didn't have a complain. Because of this I took a girlfriend here and the bouncer was so rude and I was seriously so turned off that we left. The third time I went here, which was a few nights ago I also went with another girl because we were in the area and she'd always wanted to go in. The bouncer was one I didn't recognize before, new maybe. He was okay. The waitress also was attentive, making sure to get every shot glass immediately after we drank them. I suppose the drinks are watered down because I know for a fact 5 shots of Jack Daniels would of messed me up more. I think this is a good spot to chit chat while having drinks (it has never been that packed when I have gone) with the idea of just getting a bit tipsy.Update: super packed on Saturdays. line passes Mcdonalds outside",,,

The drinks are all so watered down and it's ridiculously obvious. I know the 5 shots of anything for $10 is very appealing but at the end of the day, I feel that you could spend just a tad bit more money elsewhere, who doesn't serve watered down shots and you'll be able to get to a better level of ""tipsy-ness"" that you wish to achieve. I had a shot of tequila, and you still get that tequila taste but instead of the flavor sort of lingering in your mouth, it washed down rather immediately. I had another shot of whiskey- or should I say ""whiskey"". I had to call it a night after that. It was truly disgusting. Please take your $10 and bring it elsewhere. At the end of the day, you'll spend as much as you would anywhere else as you'll have to go for multiple rounds.",5,3,1

The bar is nearly empty... one regular and another man. I use the restroom and am going to take the option of the special $10 for 5 shots. Before I can the regular is telling the other man 'I love all your movies man, holy crap... I can't believe its you'. He is telling the guy modestly 'Thank you man, I appreciate it... can I get you a drink?'. If so to shut him up from being so loud and blowing his cover.The man in question... James Franco.He peers over his shoulder, looks around and sees noone else but me. As we lock eyes, he motions me over and says 'Hey man, can I buy you a drink too?' The answer was clear. He was cool and down to earth while we did 2 rounds of shots which equated to 10 each.First time a celebrity paid me for his anonymity, or maybe he wanted to feel like a regular Joe at a bar for once. Anyway, really cool guy... and uhhh I guess cool bar? Never have been back since but my experience was worth the 5 star review. I really went in because of the bars long standing history as a bar throughout the St. Marks Scene.

172,Nikki And Bruno V.,"Manhattan, NY",12,17,4,1.0,1/22/2015,"BEWARE: Racist and/or homophobic and/or sexist door policyNever in my life have I ever been denied entry anywhere!  From my younger years of partying in meat-packing, midtown, down in Miami and even in Vegas' VIP velvet-rope land, I've NEVER been treated in such a reprehensible way.  It took me 30 years in this city to truly feel discriminated against.I don't know where I went wrong. I apparently was too black, or too  gay or not prissy enough for their bouncer. I was denied entry yesterday evening, around 6:05 PM. Being in NYU territory, I walked up to the bouncer with my ID in hand. Without even looking at my ID, he looks me up and down, and  grunted:""no, only regulars"". I said ""Excuse me, what does that mean?"" He points to a sign that reads:  ""This is not a public place. We reserve the right to refuse entry"" then says  ""You can't come in. We only let in regulars. Step outside the gate.""  Pardon me?  This is St Marks, on a Wednesday and 6:00?!?! What's the problem? Could it have been my color or assumed sexual orientation? Was it the full business suit I had on under my jacket? Was it my polite demeanor? Maybe it was the nondescript black boots I changed into before leaving my office... seeing how, it's January and snow was in the forecast!!! No, it couldn't have been my attire.  The patrons I saw from the door were far from the black tie attire crowd. I'm talking to you boy in the dingy converse and other guy in the beat-up construction boots.Seriously dude, what regulars does a dive bar have?  Was it the 5, yes 5 - I counted - 5 people at the bar? My non-black male friend that I was meeting there was already sitting at the bar looking at me *confused?* throughout this ridiculous exchange. Funny, how he (being a ""regular"", I assume) was in the bar already though HE'S NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE!!! He's not even from the city. It was literally his first time visiting the East Village. And the tip of the iceberg, they have a sign outside stating ""This bar is not a public  place! We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone"". *So after doing some research I saw that they have been cited before for discriminatory practices, multiple times. You can read the owner's long rant defending their door policy.  Apparently, the sign out front is their scapegoat for being racist and homophobic. The KKK must have the same type of signs outside of their meeting places.Wtf. In conclusion this place may be dirt cheap but it's the East Village. There are many other inclusive establishments.  So don't support Continental's ignorance with your money. If you want an exclusive atmosphere, head midtown.  At least you'll get your money's worth.Feel free to read the owner's own words.  His justification is that most of this bouncers are ""very large black men"" so they can't be racist. He continues to say ""Race has always been irrelevant to me. My early and continued support of President Obama speaks for itself"" *I'm not even making that up. It's a direct quote from the website. It would be comical if it wasn't so offensive and delusional. Btw, I doubt Obama is a regular or else he would have been standing at the curb right next to me.continentalnyc.com/doorp…",17,4,4

Maybe it's a 90s mix? Smh. Anyway, I told the bartender my friend was coming who was paying for my drink and she took the drink back from me until he came LOL! But anyway, I've had issues before. Like when I came here with my now ex-boyfriend they refused to let him in for wearing sneakers! This trash can?! Really. I couldn't believe it.

177,Robert H.,"New York, NY",0,11,0,1.0,5/13/2015,"If it's too good to be true, it probably is. A friend and I were actually drawn to this place by the cheap beer rather than the famous (now infamous?) shot deal. We had gone down to St. Mark's for the evening and thought we had found a killer deal. I will once again reiterate that if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.Admittedly, I had read on Yelp that the shots were watered down, but I thought their draft beer would be fine (I didn't think you could water anything down out of a tap). Well, when my friend and I got our two Yuenglings we both agreed that they indeed tasted watered down (I had not previously informed him about the reporting of this practice on Yelp).Furthermore, I could not stand the signs politely informing me that in Continental, ""The Customer's always WRONG"" (sic). What a ridiculous attitude. What's the point of coming here if the bar's objective isn't to deliver the best customer experience possible? I guess we're supposed to thank Continental because they were so kind as to serve us watered down beer and liquor for such a great price...I would say that in spite of these two major complaints, I had no problems with the service or the bar's decor, even if it was a little dingy. If you want to save money on drinks, buy a bottle of something and stay home. Alternatively, check out the myriad of other, much better dive bars in LES that don't dilute what they serve to their customers.",2,1,

181,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,3.0,5/6/2013,"Only thing you need to know about Continental is the SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS. Continental is cheap. They have cheap shots, beers, and shots. $10 for 5 shots; any shots, all the time. They also have dirt cheap beer, $2 domestic drafts like PBR, Blue Moon, etc., also bottled beers like Goose Island, Stella, etc. One can't complain about such dirt cheap prices for Manhattan. Continental is where you get a cheap pregame on; you come in for an hour, and then you leave. Interesting how many times I have passed this place and never bothered to go in. They advertise $10 for 5 shots on a giant banner at front. I finally had reason to come here recently for a friend's small celebratory prelude to a night of birthday drinking. Be ready to whip out ID as semi-intimidating bouncers will be standing by the entrance. The place itself is low-key/divey. Both the exterior and interior of the bar is a bit dingy/dark, but they have a nice big opening to the outside, so you can get a nice view, natural lighting, and fresh city air. There's plenty of seating at the bar, and there are some tables. First time here, a Thursday night, was quite empty. That was good though because our bartender was more attentive. It's CASH ONLY, so make sure you have cash. I can't speak for more sophisticated and refined drinks such as martinis, aged scotch and such here; that would be best reserved for other bars. For beer and economy liquors though, Continental does the job just fine. One very important thing to know, and which they don't advertise, is that while they offer almost any and all types of shots, they are limited to economy liquors/house brands and some are watered down/mixed versions of the original. This may or may not deter some because one should not have expectations of gulping down shots of Ciroc Raspberry or Silver Patron for only $10. If you order a Jager, it won't be Jager from the bottle. It will be a concoction of Jager. And disappointingly, it may taste more like Robitussin to you than Jager. All in all, decent bar which offers great value for ECONOMICAL liquors/cheaper brands. Unfortunately, due to such low costs, it's doubtful they can accommodate such pricing for every type of liquor here especially when it comes to the shots. Nonetheless, not a bad bar if you just want to get a cheap little buzz before the real party starts.",4,,2
182,Glen K.,"Long Beach, NY",9,22,3,4.0,1/31/2015,"This is a great spot to start your night off because of the 5 shots for $10 special. We got shots of fireball and were able to get a nice buzz going. The bar seemed dirty but nothing out of the ordinary for a dive bar. That said, with plenty of great bars to explore in the East Village, there is no reason to stay here after a few rounds of shots.My friends and I were able to get in no problem. The bouncers were never rude to us and I was initially surprised by all the comments claiming discrimination.In defense of Continental, the owner can conduct his/her business however they choose, as long as it's within legal limits. If the owner chooses to secretly discriminate against skin color or ethnicity, that for him to decide. If he wants to hire ignorant bouncers, that's his call. The owner runs his bar and can decide those he wants as customers and those he doesn't. It is up to the patrons of the bar to decide if they want to give the owner business or not. Having read many negative comments deters me from coming back to Continental. I would rather not take the chance of finding myself or a friend in a hostile situation before entering the bar. East Village offers plenty of great alternatives that are worth spending a few dollars more for.",5,,2

This was confusing for me because the bar wasn't crowded and my guy friends were wearing a button down and chinos. I came to the front of the bar to look for them when a bouncer aggressively told me to move from in front of the walkway because I was ""blocking the line"" and the doorway. There was not a single person waiting online to get into the bar so his tone and approach was ridiculous. I moved to the side and was told to come out of the bar and step to the side to look for my friend. The owner of the bar then comes over to me and says ""We told you to move. what are you special ed?"" At this point, I was flabbergasted because why would you say that or speak to me in this way?

I tried to explain to him that I tripped over the step, but he couldn't be bothered with listening. He then insisted I leave before he ""made"" me leave. I asked if I could finish my beer, he said no. I asked if I could get my money back, he said no. So, I left and will never return.
