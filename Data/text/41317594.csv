0,Matt B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",43,96,89,5.0,10/20/2018,"Went to Marc Forgione with the expectation I was going to be served the best chicken in the city, which frankly is always dangerous. Easily delivered though. What's great about MF is that it is simple, doesn't break the bank, and just very well done. Great dining without pretence. I have no idea if that is what he was going for but that's what you get. Service was fantastic - seated immediately, drinks came quickly and the guys were attentive throughout, knew the menu and could read us in terms of food sizing. Also made sure we didn't forget what we were taking home. So 5 stars to them. Started with 3 of the starters, which were the sushito, hot wings and Notikori. All great. See pictures attached. Simple food done very well and pretty centric to nyc style taste. The chicken was the key though, comes out on a cast iron tray that it was cooked in. Potatoes are drowned in the trimmings, with the broccoli cooking right there in front of you. The chicken itself was perfectly balanced with the right amount of tenderness and moisture. We didn't have a lot to drink (rare) but the glass of Italian Barolo was a great recommendation. Bill came to 224 including tip and tax. Crazy affordable. Fantastic. Would highly recommend.

Highly recommend the squash agnolotti, the spaghetti with foie gras and the chicken on the brick.

(He said it would be fixed soon) While asking this question the  off-duty general manager (who had been eating a meal near us and likely drinking) approached our table and asked us to leave because ""(he had) heard us bothering his staff about their grade""What a joke!  I believe his name is Matthew.  He is crude and incredibly unprofessional.  If their grade status wasn't enough to deter me from returning he certainly is.",2,,

The skin was bite through with a crunch that leaves you wanting another bite.For desert I ordered a frozen cappuccino which was a nice touch with a chocolate ganache s'mores.",,,

Every plate is one joyride after another.  Not only is the food impeccable, it's presentation is done with simple, classy settings that are unique.  The whole dining experience with the happy black clad waiters are just down right... perfect.  I have actually been here half a dozen times, way before my Yelp days, but am truly happy to give this place the super-5 star rating.  This time, I ventured to let the restaurant take the lead and tried their taste menu.  It was a menu filled with exotic, exquisite flavors from around the world - the Colorado lamb with harissa from Africa was truly heavenly.  The sirracha- flavored buttered sauce accompanying the succulent lobster made my mouth water continually way after they cleared my empty dish.Thank you so much for the amazing dining experience",9,5,8

We went for my birthday and when we got there they had a birthday card waiting at the table and we were given a round of complementary champagne. The service was amazing. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. The food was the best part. We started off with some oysters and the tuna tartare, then we moved onto a pasta dish and a large shareable halibut dish. Everything was packed with flavor and just the perfect portion.Also they sent us a few ""gifts"" from the kitchen. Our favorite item that we had all night was one of these gifts, the mini everything bagel bites filled with cream cheese. We were so stuffed towards the end, but we did order their donut of the day which was AMAZING. I'm not a big donut fan, but this donut was killer. Overall we LOVED this restaurant and can't wait to come try it out again!!",1,,
6,Shelley C.,"Lebanon, OH",191,239,739,5.0,3/3/2018,"Oh sweet Jesus, this place is the definition of ""As good as it gets""!  The restaurant décor and ambiance is on point, the staff are warm, welcoming and super attentive, and Chef Doug is a just a culinary genius!!We started out with some specialty cocktails as we looked over the menu and JP gave us the rundown and actually took the time to ask if there were any allergies, dislikes, etc (bonus points to start the night off right)!While we were waiting on our starters they delivered their delicious potato bread and an amuse bouche, which was a warm broth with a lovely bread stuffed with cheese on top. We were then ready to move on to some serious starters...Foie Gras, which was so creamy and wonderful, it was served with a delicious warm banana bread and spread, if you have never tried Foie Gras, this is definitely the place to try it. We also tried delicious fried cubes of chick peas (I believe) they were delicious. Next we had the most delicious tortellini that you could ever imagine. It was filled with a warm salami and the pillow like tortellini's floated in this amazing warm broth. To die for! I am craving these as I write this!For our entree's we had the Tomahawk Steak and the Chicken under A Brick. You really cannot go wrong with either of these choices. The Tomahawk was a perfect medium rare seared perfectly. The Chicken, wow, just wow, it was so tender and cooked perfectly. Dessert topped off the evening with a specialty (I can't even remember the name, but it was like a cloud of deliciousness) and of course those famous 10 minute cookies and melted ice cream....so just go ahead and order them....these are an absolute must! They are the most wonderful chocolate chip cookies you will ever taste, like ever, period. Marc Forgione's is a definite must go to in New York. The food is amazing, the service is impeccable, the décor is warm and inviting and you will have an experience you won't forget.  So take your time, sit back and enjoy your evening.We can't wait to go back!",3,,
7,Brooke M.,"Conshohocken, PA",220,126,99,5.0,1/30/2018,"Marc Forgione is the perfect place for any form of celebration going on in your life. My boyfriend took me to this restaurant for my birthday and from the moment we walked in the door, we had amazing service. We arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation and they let us know that our table was not ready yet but we could wait at the bar. We ordered drinks at the bar to start expecting to have to pay for them separately as some restaurants make you do but they were kind enough to transfer over to our check at our table once we were seated. When we sat down, there was a nice handwritten birthday card waiting at our table. Our waiter also poured us each a complimentary half glass of champagne. To start our meal, we ordered a special that our waiter told us about that was a pureed potato ravioli. It was a bit on the smaller side but still delicious. For our dinner, we decided on the chicken for two which could definitely be chicken for three with how large the portion is. It came out steaming hot and was absolutely amazing. Would highly recommend this and for how much food you get, it is very reasonably priced. To finish our meal, we ordered the 10 minute cookies and they are a MUST if you love chocolate or cookies. This was hands-down the best cookie I have ever had in my life!",1,1,
8,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",119,301,527,4.0,6/17/2018,"Really great dinner! They served warm rolls which were amazing and so fresh. We were then also served an amuse bouche that was their take on an everything bagel and a chilled soup. It was great. We then started with burrata, which we thought was just ok and pretty standard. It came with just 1 cracker which was strange. I would have loved if it was paired with a piece of charred sour dough bread. We then got the ricotta filled ravioli. This dish was great (although small) and the ricotta melted inside so it almost tasted like a soup dumpling. We then got chicken under a brick which was amazing. The chicken was perfectly cooked and so moist and the skin was perfectly crispy. The potatoes that were cooked with it tasted great.",1,1,1

First off I want to thank my wonderful servers: Mark and Robert for making my night a memorable one.It was packed when we got there around 8/8:30pm which was a good sign in the middle of the week.I tried the tasting menu for $125 per person, and was so impressed with the choices that night. There was not a single dish I didn't enjoy. Service is important for me, along with knowledge of the dishes, it was clear the servers were on point in explanation as well as personable and able to make us laugh. We ordered a 2016 Domaine Louis Michel & Fils Montee de Tonnerre Chablis Premier Cru that paired perfectly with each dish (for my palate) - the Sommelier that night, recommended that one to us since the one we chose recently finished, (thank you for that). I'm so glad we drank the one we did.  Would I come here again? HELL YEAH. If you appreciate outstanding service, knowledge and delicious food which isn't one particular cuisine, please do.",,,

13,Zhenny G.,"Manhattan, NY",237,79,37,5.0,7/5/2018,"This is a great restaurant that has elegant food but a casual atmosphere. I came here on a Tuesday night with 2 friends and were able to get a table without a reservation. The sommelier was super helpful and helped us to pick out a lovely bottle of rose. We ordered the oysters, soft shell crab, burrata, and the beef tenderloin, all to share. The menu choices were limited but everything was simply amazing. I feel like the menu items we ended up choosing are pretty typical of things that I've ordered at other restaurants, but Marc Forgione was able to put their own unique spin on each that blew all other comparisons out of the water. The burrata, for example, was enveloped with truffle that was amazing, while the soft shell crab was drenched in a basil aioli that only added to its flavor. This restaurant is a solid choice if you're looking for a reinvented twist on some classic dishes.",1,1,1

Without a doubt, the best chicken I have ever had. Tender, crispy, juicy, etc. It is in my honest opinion, that it is a travesty if you come here, and don't order the chicken. The appetizers were good (nothing to write home about hence the 1 docked star), we had the chicken wings and meatballs. Next time I would definitely order the lobster dish for appetizer, I heard great things about it. Atmosphere was very nice but very hot. My guests and I were all fanning ourselves and sweating a bit, which hurt the dining experience. Overall, I would most definitely return.",1,1,
18,Risa S.,"New York, NY",4,193,383,4.0,1/23/2018,"Came here for a birthday dinner and how most people have described, the food is delicious. Since we were a group of 10, we had an option of the large group prix fixe meal (see my photos for the menu-$95 per person). Everything on that menu was so delicious! My favorite was the chicken dish and the potatoes that come with it. Oh my gosh, you have to order it!!!! And for dessert they brought out mini cupcakes and cookies for everyone. Also, I was able to make changes in the prix fixe menu. Changed the ribeye to halibut since the birthday boy doesn't eat red meat and they had no issues with changing that. Awesome! Service from the staff was fantastic! Every person was nice and friendly. The dishes come out family style and they bring out enough food to serve everyone at the table. Meaning, we got 3 plates of each order for the group of 10. *thumbs up*The only complaint I have was the process of making this reservation. Knowing that it's a large group, I made the reservation over a month in advance. And because it is a large group the hostess on the phone stated I had to contact the event coordinator via email. So this was December 12th (wanting to make a reservation for 1/19). Yes, I knew holidays were around the corner and the reply may be late but I didn't expect it to take 3 weeks. And after my initial email I called the restaurant 3 times asking if my reservation was in the books or not. And each time it wasn't and I asked to relay the message to event coordinator for me. So then I finally emailed him again to follow up on my original. He finally reached out and the reservation was made. He apologized and everything was smooth sailing from there. I was hoping I would meet him in person at dinner but he never came around our table (he may not have been working. Who knows). Needless to say, it was a hassle but the food was amazing!!!! And I know all 10 of us will agree. Would I go back? Yes.",,,

20,Lily M.,"Dallas, TX",620,871,1372,4.0,4/27/2017,"Whenever I'm in the city, I always try to find the best restaurants in terms of menu options and ambiance, depending on who will be joining me and what kind of mood we're looking for.My husband and I were in town for the weekend and decided that Marc Forgione's restaurant would an amazing choice.  For starters, making a reservation was quick and easy.  Instead of using OpenTable, I instead made a call to the restaurant and easily scored the time that I had requested.  Upon arriving on the night of our reservation, our table was ready and we were immediately seated in a comfortable half booth, half table (so to speak).  As we all glanced around the room, I couldn't help but to notice the brick walls that brought a more laid back feel to the otherwise elegant interior.  The dim lighting made the space feel a bit romantic, and yet a bit hip with the brick exposure around the restaurant.  I think the restaurant is perfect for a romantic date night or a group outing, as the vibe was energetic, yet still graceful.Our waiter was amazing to us.  He was so knowledgeable about the menu and he allowed us to take our time chatting with each other before immediately pushing us to begin ordering.  The menu is small and to the point.  Normally, I would not go for a restaurant with such a small menu; however, this menu had just about every single thing I would have wanted to try, and it ended up being hard narrowing down my selections.Along with the glass of Chardonnay I ordered that I at first wasn't pleased with until taking a few more sips, we all received an Amuse Bouche that was glorious.  I have no idea what all was in it because the restaurant was so loud that I couldn't hear our waiter, but it was delicious and it definitely started the meal off in the right direction.My husband and I ordered the Chili Lobster to share as an appetizer, which was the perfect amount for two people.  Although the chili broth was spicy and savory, the toast was so tough that I had a hard time eating it.  Thankfully, there was a good enough amount of lobster that made up for the lack of toast I got to eat.  I do recommend this dish; however, I'd probably request for the bread to be lightly toasted.For my entrée, I ordered the Halibut since it's indeed my favorite fish.  To compare the Halibut to the Black Bass, I much preferred the Black Bass.  The Halibut was nicely cooked, but it was the sauce that accompanied the Halibut that was a tad bit too salty for my liking.  If it weren't for the dish being over-salted, it would have been an amazing meal because the hazelnut flavor really made this dish unlike any other that I've had.  The Black Bass was pure perfection.  The Bass was light and flaky and went so well with the gnocchi and vegetables on the plate.For dessert, we ordered the Warm Cookies with Melted Vanilla Ice Cream and The Egg.  We had no idea what The Egg was, and so as not to spoil the dessert, just know that it's only for someone that would love a sweet and fruity flavor.  If you aren't into fruity tasting desserts, definitely don't order it.  But, to speak on the Warm Cookies, they were amongst some of the best cookies I've ever had.  The cookies were thick, moist, and they had just the right amount of sweetness.  I would have preferred frozen ice cream over melted ice cream, but it was still a winner.All in all, we had a great time here and I'd most definitely recommend it to anyone.  We had a fun time, great food, and superb service.",5,4,2
21,Eric R.,"Westbury, NY",463,264,20,4.0,5/7/2018,"NOTE: 5 stars for food, 4 stars for the service. Had an amazing meal for my 1 year anniversary with the mrs this weekend. Restaurant Marc Forgione is a blend of different culinary styles. I was tasting french, Italian, asian, and a little bit of Caribbean flavor in the food I was trying. We were going to go for the tasting menu originally but everyone kept stating to order the chicken under a brick so we did our own menu combo. We ordered the scallops with caviar, the green pea ravioli with shaved truffles, the duck in a jar, and the wings. The wings were pretty much nonexistent. Its supposed to be a ""snack"" but well they should probably take that off the menu. The 3 starter dishes was amazing. The last dish was the chicken under a brick which came out sizzling hot. Our only complaint was the service was a bit slow but it was worth the wait for that chicken under the brick. It was amazing and my first time trying it. I would highly suggest you make reservations and you get there a little early.",1,,1

I chose this as the birthday restaurant. Our seats were already reserved. We were guided to our seats by the hostess. Next up we notice something on table.  Situated in front of us was a birthday card from the forge family. Our waiter came over and wish us a happy birthday follow by champagne to celebrate the special day. For drinks we got the Kumquat cachaca: this drink lights up and was put on a unique glass. For entrees we got the Scallops: scallops was fresh! love the crisp on the outside and the combination of flavor to this dish. Chili lobster: the sauce was so flavorful. A bit of kick. I wish I had more bread and sauce. Very outstanding dish. Halibut: fish was soft and cook to perfection. Yet another amazing sauce.Half a chicken: yep! We wanted to try all the items on the menu but a whole chicken was too much for us. Waiter was accommodating and let us order half of it. Chicken came out on a very hot plate. Skin was crispy. Meat itself was tender. Just everything goes well together. Service was amazing, they gave us a bag of cookies to take home.",2,,1

But every single aspect of this meal was perfection!My friends and I arrived right on time for our 7:15pm reservation and were seated nearly immediately. We started the evening cocktails, each trying something a little different. We began the meal with an amuse-bouche bagel filled with cream cheese and some chilled tomato soup, along with some warmed bread covered in butter and black sea salt. Next we shared three appetizers:Hirasama: This signature dish is a unique experience in and of itself, as you eat a tiny bit of flower to ""awaken"" your taste buds and then take a bite of the tuna...just wow! Try it. My mouth was tingling because this was so good.Chili Lobster: Another winner here, with a very flavorful dish.Eggplant Parm Ravioli: Since we split all the appetizers, I only had one ravioli, but easily could have eaten an entire portion by myself!For dinner, a friend and I shared the $62 Chicken Under-a-Brick, which was just delicious. The presentation was truly dramatic, in the best way, served in a rectangular skillet with the juices still sizzling as it came to the table. It was perfectly seasoned and served with some potatoes and broccoli rabe. Though none of us had room for dessert, we shared the 10 Minute Cookies, which were the icing on the cake. Warm, soft chocolate chip cookies right out of the oven, served with ice cream! Overall, the service was superb, the food was perfect, and the ambiance was unexpectedly relaxed. I loved it!",7,2,3

At this point we have had basically everything on the menu, but some of my favorites are the hiramasa, lobster chili, Laotian sushi, rib eye, halibut, chicken on a brick, tomahawk steak...hmm ok, everything on the menu. The ambiance is personal, romantic and very rustic chic. The service has always been exceptional, every single time. The drinks and cocktails are delicious.

My boyfriend and I have been here 3 times and it's always amazing. We've done the tasting menu. But the real winners on the menu is the brick chicken and lobster chili.The chicken is amazing! Best chicken I've ever had. It's even better when you add the truffle, but be ready to pay a hefty price for amazing flavor. If you like truffle, definitely add it to the chicken. They'll shave off some truffle right after they serve it to you. The lobster chili is amazing! My boyfriend and I didn't even feel shy to ask for more Texas toast to soak up the rest of the chili.

Marc Forgione stole the top spot for me with its chicken under a brick. Other fancy spots might try to up their game with foie gras and truffles, but at Forgione, they stick to simple, classic flavors by pairing the chicken with butter, capers, and lemon--and nothing else is necessary! My fiancé and I also ordered the off-menu smoked bbq oysters, which was the first cooked oyster dish that I liked! It tasted like smokehouse barbecue sauce and was extremely melt-in-your-mouth tender. I also really appreciated the amuse bouche in the beginning, which was a gazpacho with a Costco chicken bake-like pastry (childhood throwback in a bite). The size of the meal was more than enough for two, and I was able to take home leftover potatoes and caper butter sauce for the chicken to make a delicious egg hash the next day, making it a meal that just keeps on giving...",1,1,1
27,Cindy L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",166,23,106,5.0,2/18/2018,"My boyfriend and I celebrated Valentines weekend here, and had an outstanding food adventure experience! I've watched Marc Forgione on Iron Chef on Food Network, so when I discovered he had a restaurant here in Manhattan, it landed on a spot on my food bucket list.We had an 8pm reservation, and when we arrived 10 minutes early, they informed us that they had a table ready, but another party in a more intimate spot was about to leave. We appreciated them informing us, but ended up waiting 20 minutes since the party was taking awhile to leave. They ended up preparing another table for us, although I didn't understand why they couldn't have done so earlier, since it was not packed and there were still a decent number of empty tables.It was also strange that they kind of pressured you to order drinks by giving us the drinks menu without the food menu. We were not expecting this, and although we ordered drinks, it also still took awhile for the waiter to give us the food menu. That was a theme I realized throughout the service, a lack of urgency. Maybe that was just their standard so customers wouldn't feel rushed, but it came off as the servers and waitstaff didn't care too much about our time.However, the service was the only downside to our experience. We got the winter tasting menu, and were absolutely blown away by the food. Everything was an amazing and complex creation of contrasting flavors and textures, unlike anything I've ever tasted before. The rolls were delicious, as was the amuse-bouche which was crab filled and reminiscent of a crab rangoon. A lot of the starting dishes were Asian inspired, such as the notkitori, fish on top of savory warm sticky rice. The most memorable was the Hiramasa. The server handed us the Szechuan button, which if you've never had Szechuan food, gives a spicy, tongue numbing sensation. With your tongue numbed, eating the acidic flavors of the creamy yellowtail fish and crunch of the chips was a unique experience. The halibut and chicken under a brick were also standouts in terms of flavors and texture, everything prepared visually and taste-wise to perfection.I think the tasting menu was perfect for getting a variety and being able to taste all of the restaurant's famous dishes. We definitely still had room to eat afterward, but the complexity and originality of each dish made for a satisfying and amazing experience.",2,1,1

Pork Chop it right up there at the top as well.Dining at the bar is our preference,  table seating is nice too.Go and enjoy!",2,1,
30,Shrimps Lover S.,"Chicago, IL",5,19,0,5.0,1/31/2018,"The name of the game is food and boy oh boy does this place serve up  warm dishes of delicious. My friend Timmy told me about this place, and gave me no further details...so I went in cold..not knowing much besides making sure I hold Timmy accountable for however this meal turned out.Turns out, Timmy is a genius, and so is this so called ""Marc Forgione"" guy...I don't know if hes made up or a real guy, but man can this guy cook better than my Dear Aunt Granny (RIP), and that's sayin' somethin'. The Hiramasa was absolutely breathtaking, those flavors....man did they dance on my tongue like a graceful ballerina boy. The chili Lobster was spicy and incredibly luscious and rich...for every time I took a sip of that broth it reminded me of being wrapped in a 4000 thread blanket made of silk and rayon.Additionally, the service was exquisite and the atmosphere can't be beat. I will say...do prepare to take out a small loan if you go big, it is rather expensive...but as my second cousin Butch always says...its better to go big than hang around his friend Peter.. who smells of wheat and thinks he's a reincarnation of Gérard Depardieu. One negative: There was no shrimp dish..which for the life of me I will never understand...Bravo! ""Marc Forgione"" Bravo!",2,2,1
31,Sarah A.,"Cleveland, OH",2,48,81,5.0,8/9/2017,"I had an amazing meal here with my husband on his birthday. We got the creekstone steak which was cooked perfectly- with a salty crusty exterior. We started with the shoshito pepper appetizer which was mind blowingly good- definitely get that if it's still on the menu. Dessert was a peach cobbler type dish which was juicy, crispy and delicious. Overall an amazing eating experience.",2,,
32,R. K.,"Valhalla, NY",12,470,1,4.0,3/21/2018,"With its rustic ambience and quality offerings Marc Forgione provided a positive dining experience.Seated at a comfortable window table for two we arrived for an early 5:30 dinner. By 7PM the dining room was electric and loud. A tasteful cream cheese ""popper"" accompanied with a subtle cool chicken broth was offered ""on the house"". A pleasant surprise...a positive beginning. For starters we both selected the ""Pansoti Special"". Flavorful ravioli stuffed with meat we both enjoyed this fine choice. We both heard / read about this restaurant's most popular entree - ""Chicken Under a Brick"" - so off we went. At $65 this large easily shared for two  (possibly  three) was a steal. Arriving hot the chicken was tender and juicy. The yukon gold potatoes were perfectly cooked and  the broccoli rabe - compatible. That said - it's a basic chicken dish. We didn't find anything unique in flavor here - nothing that would stay in memory. For dessert we were blown away by the Apple Cobbler. The ""Lemon Cardamom Ice Cream"" combined perfectly with ""Drop Biscuits"" resulting in a wonderful finale to a most satisfying dinner.Service for the most part was acceptable. When quizzed on the menu our waiter seemed unsure on certain selections. My colleague and I were interrupted a number of times with servers asking if we were done with certain courses. It was pretty obvious we were not. This became a bit irritating.However - Overall it was a fine evening.",,1,1

There was a hand written happy anniversary card to the both of us followed by a complimentary celebratory drink to toast our special occasion. We had the scallop special which was amazing, lobster chili which had heat and flavor, and oysters which also had some heat and were delicious! My husband can eat a lot and had the chicken under a brick for 2 to himself and really enjoyed the meal. I had the bass which was delicious. Don't miss out on the 10 minute chocolate chip cookies-they didn't disappoint! What a great experience!! Wish we could give it more than 5 stars!",,,

Kudos to him for one remembering, and two taking it upon himself to make plans. We arrived early, hoping to eat earlier, our reservation was for 10:45, found parking right in front! Which was awesome. Hostess informed us that we couldn't be seated earlier, but we could hang out by the bar have a drink, and/or sit at a high table, and get served there. Since I wanted a romantic dinner, we opted to have some drinks before dinner. The place is very dark, intimate, and the staff is very friendly, after a while of us standing by the bar we asked a waiter if we could sit at the high tables to enjoy our drinks, which wasn't a problem, thankfully! Soon after that we were seated. For appetizer we ordered...Chili lobster- for me it was too spicy, flavor was good, and my husband really enjoyed it, my pallet can't take super spicy stuff, so after two spoons I was done. BBQ clams- these were very good, and would recommend. For entree we had the Halibut- HOLY CRAP! This is DELICIOUS!!!!! Incredible! And I will come back once a week just for this!!! The sauce it came in was incredible! For dessert- we had the two minute cookies, which was prefect to end an incredible dinner. Overall it's a great spot, amazingly incredible quality food!

Hirimasu is quite extra ordinary from the eating sequence you need to follow in order to taste every unique flavor of that dish. To me, this dish taste like a fish dessert!Their signature black truffle chicken dish is a star. Served while boiling and good to share. We didn't waste anything in that plate. We ate it all. Halibut meLts in your mouth and the mouth watering octopus isn't enough for 4, you would want another order. It's super Uber delicious. The oyster which they call tiny little bitches are the best starter to get you hungry for more tasty recipes. And the milk and cookies is oh so rich and creamy. Marc also stopped by our table and chatted with us. I would love to come back again!",1,,

Apparently we had made the right choice as the ""shared dish"" that we planned to get was huge in size. By huge I really meant it...That big plate of chicken, underneath you could also find huge chunks of potatoes (great flavor, trust me), was nothing but tender, soft, juicy, and to some extent, spongy. It was also salted to the right level, so that the original flavor of chicken was not overwhelmed by the sauce. Finally, the skin! Not greasy, crispy, and carried a light meaty taste, oh my, you won my heart! If you were only allowed to pick one dish, go for the chicken! Their app selections were quite extensive too - we shared the BBQ oyster, as well as the foie gras; I would give recommendation on the former. Dessert on menu was slightly disappointing, yet I liked my off-the-menu choice poached pear on tart.Overall this was a lovely dining experience with many highlights; however I do feel too noisy, and even a bit disturbing while eating, and would have to shout in order to make conversations. Yeah ""rustic"" as it claims itself.",15,9,10

Just really, really good food which is obviously the foundation of a fantastic restaurant. What really put us over the top was , Mark (no, not Marc), our server. He was genuinely, the BEST, server we've ever had a restaurant. He was kind, funny, knowledgeable, and patient with questions.

Complimentary champagne to start the meal and a hand written note from Forge. We love the brick chicken- it's a must. His signature. The scallops are also wonderful.

The bread that came w the duck in a jar was much better. Foie gras was sooo creamy-- could just eat it by itself. I got the John Dory. The first bite I took, I almost wanted to cry-it was that good. It was over a bed of squid ink couscous that complimented the saltiness of the John Dory. I'm sorry nemo and marlon-I found dory.My dining companion got the pork. Mine was better.We also got a bottle of wine-total bill came out to be around 188$. This is a must try restaurant. We initially came to try the scorpion shots but we were so busy obsessing about how good the food was that we forgot.. I know amateur mistake, but we'll be back!The decor of the restaurant is really nice too. It has a sort of a modern rustic feel to it.Service was excellent.

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was very observant and accommodating, omg, i'd come back to the restaurant just for him! He should open his restaurant and hire a chef! He also recommended me cocktails and his choice didn't disappoint!Food was delicious. Complimentary bagel with mushroom soup on a tea base brought nostalgic memories about great dining experience in Hong Kong: tea ceremony, where I had tea soup with dumplings. So thanks for that!Scallops were one of the best I've had in life. And I mean it! Yellowtail appetizer is a must! Highest quality fish is presented with delicious dressing and tasty herb to reset you pallet. It was sad that they didn't have swordfish, but halibat fillet tasted great.Initially I had doubts about going there, because prices weren't listed anywhere. They should have prices on their website with disclaimer that it is subject to change without notice.But restaurant is affordable, menu is attached.

The restaurant decor is rustic yet homey. There is a wall with books and exposed bricks. When we got to our seats there was a handwritten note to wish my dad happy birthday and complimentary champagne. They also gave us this bread that was fluffy and buttery.After reading reviews for this restaurant, we decided to play it safe and order the highly recommended lobster chili and the Chicken under a brick for two. We also ordered two glasses of Malbec.Before our lobster Chili, the waiter brought out a mushroom soup with a tiny everything bagel on top. You have to eat the bagel first and then drink the soup. We thought the soup was a bit too salty, especially since the everything bagel is salty already. This was okay.The lobster Chili is as delicious as everyone says! Full of flavor! A tad spicy but very very savory. The Chicken under a brick was good but it definitely didn't live up to the hype. It was a bit bland and the drumsticks were too dry. Wish I had that lobster chili to dip my chicken in lolAt the end of dinner, my dad said he didn't want any sweets so we didn't order dessert, but our waiter kindly came out with some cute little carrot muffins on a plate that said Happy Birthday with a candle on the side. It was very very sweet and thoughtful! Also Marc himself was walking around the restaurant and was greeting people in the front when we were leaving.It was money well spent!

The buns was so warm and fluffy but still has that chewiness. Whoever the baker is....knows what she/he is doing. I asked for seconds on the bread. The lobster was amazing. The broth was unbelievable and the lobster was perfectly cooked. The toast was also perfect. I could have had at least a million more serving of this dish. At least!!!The chicken under a brick was good but a little greasy for me and just a minute on the over cooked side. However the skin was delicious and the potatoes were great. Overall still an excellent dish. It is all white meat plus the drum stick. As someone who prefers dark meat, I was a little disappointed not to get a thigh. We also got a little cookie in the house that was quite pleasant. On our way out we bumped into Mark. He gave us free muffins for breakfast too!! It was fun. He was really nice. As an aside, we also were the most awkward diners. We had just picked up 4 stools we bought off of Craigslist and carried them with us to dinner. They were super accommodating and let us in anyway. While a real table takes reservations, there are several high top tables that seem to be able to accommodate the walk ins. They were busy for sure but I don't think anyone had to wait too long to get a spot at those.",,,

And to my surprise, even though we came 30 minutes earlier, the table was already set up for us and there was already a birthday card on the table greeting my boyfriend.  They were very nice. Gave us complimentary birthday champagne. They had a birthday card when we got there. Waiter shook my boyfriend's hand and greeted him. Then manager stopped by our table to ask my BF how everything went (at end of dinner when I went to restroom).

The staff is fantastic and knowledgeable, the somm is a doll. The wine list is diverse and pairs well with the also diverse and ever changing menu, but you'll want to go straight for the bottles. The smell of warm, browned butter truly evokes a sense of comfort and puts you in the proper mindset from the moment you walk in the door. As any New York chef knows, in order to please both the local foodies and the tourists alike, you must have a chicken entree made to please any crowd and this dish nails it. The shareable chicken comes out in a bubbly buttery skillet. Simple and perfectly cooked appealing for even the most pickiest of NYC foodies!

64,Omega-Man ..,"Englishtown, NJ",0,15,0,4.0,12/19/2017,"Chose this place because it has One Michelin Star and because Marc Forgione is an Iron Chef. There were five of us and we were temped to choose their ""tasting"" menu at $95 a head. However, we figured we could order exactly what we wanted for, maybe, a couple hundred less. So, we doubled up on appetizers to share and went from there.Chicken Mushroom ""Muse"": Served with a very small ""bagel"" (maybe 1.5 inches across) which was stuffed with some sort of cheese. The bagel was delicious but I didn't think it resembled or tasted of bagel. The waiter explained that the broth was more of a bone broth, which is all the rage now and, much more intense in flavor than chicken soup. However, more than a mere 2 tablespoons of broth would have been appreciated. I am not kidding, 2 tablespoons of broth! But, since it was on the house, who am I to complain!Hirasama: This signature dish is a unique experience, as you start with a tiny flower bud to ""awaken"" your taste buds and then you eat the rest. I still don't get the point of the flower buds since it kinda numbs your tongue and makes it tingle. But, nevertheless, this dish was truly outstanding.Foie Gras: Served with Banana Bread and Jam. Was served cold as it was from a terrine and not a seared lobe of Foie Gras.Farro Scallop Risotto: Very good but the scallops tasted a little burned and tasted of the pan it was cooked in.Chili Lobster: Outstanding! On the spicy side in a chili broth (on the thicker side) and served with thick toast to mop it all up. Potato Ravioli: Excellent! It is a one bite pasta so, be sure to pop the whole thing in your mouth. Otherwise, it gushes out on your plate if you try to cut it.$62 Chicken Under-a-Brick: A Bit Dry - The presentation was dramatic, served in a rectangular skillet with the juices still sizzling as it came to the table. It was perfectly seasoned and served with some potatoes and broccoli rabe. I believe this is one of their signature dishes. However, chicken under a brick certainly wasn't invented by Forgione. You can find it in many Italian cook books. Unfortunately, all five of us agreed that, although nicely seasoned and flavorful, it was dry, especially the breast. Even the thighs were a bit dry. $150 Cowboy Steak: A bit Chewy & Unremarkable - This was a 40 ounce Rib Eye Steak dry aged for 28 days. BTW, 28 days is the bare minimum when aging steaks. Self respecting steak houses start 28 and go up from there. I found it interesting that they listed their chickens as coming from Snowdance Farms, implying that this is something special but, they make no mention that their steaks are USDA Prime. Most restaurants praise their steaks as being USDA Prime since only 2% of all beef is so graded. Being prime and aged usually adds greatly to tenderness and taste, which brings me to my point. Our steak was a bit tough and appeared to have none of the benefits I mentioned and, overall, unremarkable. So, how did we do by not ordering the Tasting Menu? Tasting = $475. Our check was $615! But, we did have two rounds of drinks. The overall experience was very good. Service was Excellent. Would I go back? No, too many other One Star Michelin restaurants to try in NYC. We are working ourselves up the ladder to the Three Stars!",,,

I highly recommend trying it for a special occasion or just for a beautiful night out. It was a stunning experience and we will definitely be back!,,,
70,Bink P.,"Lower Manhattan, NY",0,69,61,5.0,7/31/2017,Loved the ambience. Candles everywhere. The signature lobster dish was SO good! Definitely was the most tender lobster I have ever had...and the sauce it comes in... so good too!,1,,
71,Gary L.,"New Rochelle, NY",117,53,6,5.0,2/8/2017,Exquisitely beautiful and hip dining by a world class master chef! I would characterize this as non-pretentious molecular gastronomy!  The chicken with shaved truffles is utterly silly!Cocktails are creative and balanced!Always a bunch of delicious and creative apps on the menu that use odors and textures as palette tools!Master chef himself shaved our truffles!Heavenly restaurant,,,1
72,Anne B.,"Montclair, NJ",1,31,23,4.0,7/24/2018,Wow is the smell of food food here. Beautiful ambiance. Not cheap. Still loved it.  Shishito peppers on menu affordable... not much else ! But such a great place nonetheless.,,,
73,Aja T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,23,0,4.0,7/11/2017,"The food here was EXCELLENT! The chili lobster could be the best dish I have ever experienced in my life! I recommend you come just to try that! The desserts were also killer! The ambience was great, service was professional, courteous and informative. We stayed a pretty long time because we were there with old friends and they didn't give us a hard time. I think this place was pretty great. The reason why I took off a star is because it's REALLY expensive. We had a table of four, we each had appetizers, main courses and dessert and our bill with tip was $468! We don't even drink! Although we did have sodas. The only other thing, which was minor, was that the apps and desserts were extremely above par, but I would say the main courses were ok but nothing to go over the moon about! I wouldn't complain and there was still inventive stuff about them, but we weren't as impressed with the mains as we were totally blown away by the other courses.I would definitely recommend this place though and I hope to come back sometime in my lifetime for the chili lobster! Or maybe I'll have it in heaven!!!",1,1,
74,Richard B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,35,1,2.0,5/28/2017,"Extremely overrated and overpriced restaurant in Tribeca. It's a mid-level restaurant that charges prices of a Michelin star restaurant.I have been to Marc Forgione a dozen times in the past two years, and the only dish that's actually worthwhile is the chicken entree. Other then that, when compared to the other high-end restaurants in the area it would be at the bottom of my list. The Food combinations are not special or tasty. For the same price you can have a nice dinner at Bouley, Sushi Gari or Scalini Fedeli that are right around the corner.The one thing the restaurant does have going for it is the ambience. It's perfect for a date...",3,,

Updated review","Almost perfect. My husband and I came here after 7 years and had the tasting menu. The food was out of this world and I highly recommend trying this restaurant especially for a special occasion. We decided to do the $125 tasting menu. Every course was delicious, uniquely presented, and filling. We even had a black truffle supplement which was $60, it was great but in hindsight too much money for only having it on one course. We knew this and took our chance. The striped bass and lamb chops were probably amongst the best I've ever had and the egg dessert and short cake were phenomenal. I love how the egg was a surprise and they later explained the burst of flavors we experienced. We had a great time trying to figure out what the ""yolk"" actually was (I'll keep that a surprise for patrons to come)! Bottom line, this was one of the best meals I've had in the city. The reason for the 4 stars is because we were told that chef Marc was going to come to our table during our dessert course but when it was time, we were told he had left. I could tell my husband, (who has watched Marc's journey from iron chef, to Michelin rated, to minus a star to present day) was disappointed especially having spent $600 on our meal prepared by the chef himself. I understand Marc is very busy and he simply cannot see every one who asks but since we were told we would get to see him and then did not, expectations were built and then let down. The last time we spent that kind of money, Daniel Humm came to our table for a moment and it changed the experience making it the best meal in the US we've ever had. If Marc had come to our table even for a moment, I truly believe it would have superseded our 11Mad experience as his food was as delicious if not perhaps more. I think this meal falls a close #2 but in the end it's the entire dining experience.  Thank you and much love!",,,
76,Charles L.,"New York, NY",803,162,2383,5.0,10/7/2016,"This is the best restaurant I have been to in a while. It's very dark sexy and difficult to take Yelp food pictures. We started off with drinks, they knew how to mix a corpse reviver #2. (1 in 10 bars can do it).It was made perfectly and not at all skimpy.  We were served several things gratis, A tiny bagel stuffed with cream cheese with cold watermelon soup, unusual but really tasty. We had hot pistachio nuts and several salads to begin with followed by my poached halibut and chicken under a brick served with additional white truffles for two for Julie and Sarah. We had a nicely priced bottle of rosé and the check without tip came to about $225.00 for the three of us, Not bad for a swanky NYC restaurant on a Saturday evening.",13,6,14
77,Aili H.,"Manhattan, NY",135,31,93,5.0,2/3/2017,"This is my second time dine in Marc. Absolutely LOVE it! THE best restaurant in the neighborhood! And it's very consistent in its food quality and service(except the boy who taking finished plates)Tried MARC couple of months ago, and couldn't wait to go back. Finally got to tonight, and was so happy to see its new dish on the menu, which are all super delicious as the food we had last time!Can't be happier on Friday!!Here's some food I LOVE:1) the KampachiIt is the dish that has been on the menu since the restaurant opened. Definitely a must try! It comes with some Szechuan petter to stimulate your palate, a taste spoon of the tartare mix, and some chips. The dish is definitely a balance of sweetness and sour. Think it put passion fruit in it? And the fish is super fresh!2) HalibutThe halibut is cooked very well. Very tender, and crispy on the bottom. The source we had tonight is a very interesting Middle East fusion. It has some chickpea/ humus like sauce, as well as some cauliflower. Strongly recommend!3) S'more 2 and 10 minutes cookieTried the apple crisp dessert and S'more 1 last time. Wasn't so impressed and all of the was extremely sweet. HOWEVER! I was so surprised by tonight dessert!!! All of them had such a good balanced sweetness!! The s'more 2 had a very interesting mix with 4 layers, mush mallow, dark chocolate, cheesecake, and cookie crust with a size of ice cream, and wooden baked mush mallow. EACH part of it was sooo delicious! And they balanced so well! Nothing is too sweet! The 10 minutes cookie is really crispy outside with melting chocolate in it, and the dippy ice cream is very milky and not too sweet at all! Their dessert definitely improved A LOT!!My second favorites: (don't get me wrong they are all very good as well, just not my personal flavor)1. Chili lobsterIt comes with a very good portion. Definitely not just a appetizer size! The side bread is very crispy. The sauce has a very strong spicy sauce that we have for pho in it. However, kind of feel that it lack of sophisticateness. It is inspired by Singapore chili crab, but have to say the Singapore chili crab has more layer of taste than it.2. Scallop with hazelnut Hmm the scallop is good. But not that spectacular as Marc's other dishes. And it's kind of oily..3. The to share steakWe had it last time. The steak is very tasty! It's just the portion is too big and once you order that, nearly impossible to try other delicious dishes unless you come with a big party.Dish that don't recommend:We had the night special radish with tuna/ foie gras and daikon. It taste pretty weird for me... The foie gras is really small, and you can't really taste the tuna...Really love the foie gras served in the jar. Had it last time, but it's not on menu anymore. Kind of disappointed with the new foie gras dish..And the appetizer bread we had last time was really good. Super warm, fresh out of oven, and super crispy outside. However, the one we had tonight is really mediocre.. And asked for a second, requested a warm one, but it's even worse than the first one...The service at Marc is also pleasant. Server always explain the dish when it comes up. Except the running boy who came really close to us to see if we have finished the plate frequently, which is kind of uncomfortable. But in all, the service is great!",,,
78,Asher W.,"New York, NY",276,209,583,3.0,11/11/2015,"Place was pretty good. I wouldnt go drooling over it but it but there were definitely some superb aspects. I don't understand the obsession with their rolls. I mean they're good but nothin crazy. If you want crazy rolls get the duck fat rolls from vitae. Holy moly. Those things make me moist. Anyhow. The amuse bouche was really good. Mini everything bagels with smoked salmon cream cheese and cucumber sammies with whitefish on a cool piece of marble. We got the duck, the swordfish, and the halibut. The duck was well cooked and well spiced. Little ok the salty side but I'm ok with that. It also came with latkes and bernaise. All around good dish. The swordfish was mediocre. Came with root veggies. Not much to say about it. The halibut may have been the dish of the night. It was incredibly high quality and had a sensational sauce. The sommelier also recommended a fantastic bottle of wine to go with our dishes. A nice dry white. For dessert we got the 10 min cookies and the poached pears. The pears were good, covered with cuts and vanilla ice cream. The cookies were just cooked to order cookies. Pretty standard. Overall there were high highs and mediocre lows. Good experience. Awesome atmosphere. Service was on the better side. Not fantastic. But this isnt a place i'll be crawling to get back to.",2,,2
79,Kella X.,"Manhattan, NY",136,11,71,4.0,11/8/2016,"Finally had a chance to visit chef Marc Forgione's modern bar styled Forge on Reade street.Similar to chef Forge's style at other restaurants, the flavors in the dishes are on the more vibrant side. Personally, the dishes are a bit too greasy for my taste. Nonetheless, I enjoyed dining here and their chili lobster was cooked to perfection.Recommend: Chili Lobster, Chicken for two",1,,1
80,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",757,900,1561,4.0,8/26/2015,"Was finally able to cross Marc Forgione off my list of places to try. It's always exciting going to the restaurant of a celebrity chef, so I was really looking forward to this. Came here on a Sunday early afternoon for brunch and dove right in. Located on a side street in TriBeCa, Marc Forgione has a contemporary look and feel, while managing to also give off a rustic vibe. They have a bottomless mimosa brunch menu on the weekends, which lets face it, is always a good look. After downing a bunch of mimosas, we moved on to the food.I had an order of the pork sliders, which were pretty good. I was honestly expecting them to be a amazing, but they were a little on the bland side for me, though not too much so. It was still an enjoyable dish that left me satisfied. A few people I was with had the waffles and said it was some of the best they'd ever had. I'll definitely be back to try that dish.Overall it was a good experience and I'll definitely be back. Though I can't rave about the dish I had, it was still good and I know that there are other dishes I need to try here. Mainly, those waffles!",4,1,5
81,Amanda S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,26,53,4.0,11/18/2017,"This restaurant is a few blocks from my apt and I've been here one other occasion for dinner and another time for drinks and dessert. The restaurant is beautiful, it looks SO inviting on a cold fall evening. There are exposed brick walls, lots of heavy wooden chairs and tables, candles softly glowing, sprigs of dried wildflowers in tiny glass vases. It is warm, comfortable and inevitably busy. The staff is kind and accommodating. The appetizers came in 2 rounds, which was not a problem, but they changed our plates and silverware after we finished the salad but before the lobster and raviolis arrived. This is only an observation of something I didn't find necessary, but not a complaint. The chili lobster was the appetizer standout, my friend remarked that she would be happy to drink the sauce like a soup! For dinner two of us ordered the halibut with white truffles and our friend ordered the chicken for one. The halibut was..... mind blowing. The hazelnut and cauliflower were such a good pairing, the sauce was phenomenal and the fish was cooked perfectly. Our friend was happy with the chicken until she tasted our fish :) The chef came out to shave our truffles! We were stuffed by dessert and fighting to finish the second bottle of Cote Rotie but managed to order a scoop of apple cider sorbet - what a palate cleanser! Amazing dinner!!!!",1,,

83,Aaron O.,"Upland, CA",74,49,43,5.0,6/25/2017,"We came here for our 1- year wedding anniversary based on some research and recommendations on dining blogs. We arrived about 30 minutes late for our reservation due to an issue with our Uber. As soon as we arrived they had us wait at the bar where we received 2 glasses for complimentary sparkling wine. Our table outside on the patio was set and ready in less than 10 minutes. When we arrived to our table there was a hand written card on the table wishing us a happy anniversary. We ordered the scallops and shishito peppers, but since the chef was not happy with the quality of the peppers, he prepared and brought out all of their other appetizers for us to try. We had the delicious mussels, fried chicken liver and sushi in addition to our scallops. All were very complex in flavor and unlike anything we've tasted. We ordered the Chicken under the brick which was cooked to perfection, juicy, and filled with flavor. For dessert we had the S'more which was a chocolate cheesecake topped with marshmallow and graham crackers. Absolutely delightful and not too sweet. Between my wife and I, this was easily the best complete dining experience we have ever had. We have experienced some of the best restaurants in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Napa Valley, but comprehensively, this was easily the best experience when hospitality, customer service, quality of food, and overall atmosphere are all factored in. They clearly run a tight ship here and it shows. We will be returning next year with our friends from Los Angeles. Bravo!!",,,
84,Silvia G.,"Orange County, CA",694,705,4062,3.0,7/8/2016,"I have mixed emotions about this restaurant.  Most of the food I had was good and creative, EXCEPT FOR THE STEAK, but the price and service were not up to par.My cousins highly recommended it so our expectations were high, I mean, it's an Iron Chef so it must be amazing, right? I hear you can also meet Marc Forgione on weekdays and that he's very friendly.*Atmosphere 4/5: Beautiful restaurant, romantic, with exposed brick walls, lots of candles...just a bit too dark (had to use my cell phone to read the menu) but very modern. We were a party of 6 and were seated in a high communal type wooden table*Food:-We started with buns that very buttery, warm and yummy. Some sea salt on top and extra butter was available if desired; 4/5-I ordered a Basil rye cocktail which had tea, honey and alcohol. It was bitter, nothing special. My sis got the Tropical rum cocktail and it was even more bitter, $14 ea; 3/5-Kampachi tartare, $19: it was a pleasant surprise.  They give you a wooden spoon with some type of green herb that numbs your mouth, and then you eat the kampachi which was very good, on top of some avocado yumminess; 5/5-Canneloni, $17 for the appetizer portion. It was good but nothing special; 4/5-Foei gras, $24: it was a tad salty but very yummy when accompanied by their thin jam ""leather"" cover with berries and biscotti; 4/5-Chili lobster, $34: one of their signature dishes.  It's just lobster in a spicy sauce, it was ok but not worth the $ for the portion; 3.5/5-Chicken on a brick (for 2), $62: another of their signature dishes.  It's deep fried chicken on a casserole with yukon potatoes. I had the breast and it was very tender and juicy but reminded me of chinese fried chicken. Mom had the drumstick and she said it was a bit dry. It swims in a pool of butter/oil; 3.5/5-Duck, $39-small pieces of chewy meat that were lukewarm and just alright; 3/5-Halibut, $36-just a small filet, nothing special; 3/5-Cote de boeuf was the most disappointing, $129- I have never tried this cut but it was HARD and BLAND, do NOT get!!! 0/5. It was topped with lots of greens herbs and they give you some sauce to pour on top which should have been a sign because good meat only requires some salt and pepper.  The Meat itself had no flavor, it was hard to chew and came out more rare than we asked for. We asked the server about it and he just apologized. When we asked again, the manager just came to ask questions, wasn't very apologetic and just asked if we wanted another entree.  We had already finished the meal and were just expressing our dissatisfaction, did not need another entree.  We thought he would at least comp dessert but nothing! Even when I asked about it after receiving the bill, they refused to do anything to compensate for our disappointment. Wow, I'm in the service industry and couldn't believe they were just so apathetic to our small request, especially for a party of 6 that is dropping almost $100 ea and complained about one dish.  I read another review that also complains about the steak. I guess that's just not their forte.As far as service, the fact that they didn't care that we were so unhappy about the steak was just plain rude and arrogant.  I guess they don't need my business. It's a shame",6,3,2

Yes we arrived early for our booking but the restaurant was nearly empty. The hostess 'graciously showed mercy' by giving us a table despite us being early. Aside from the sub par overly snooty (for no good reason) hostesses, everything else was great. The Somalier was approachable, friendly, and helpful. Our waiter was fantastic, a great balance of attentive without being overly in our face. Overall wait staff in the area was also great. We ordered the Bologna, Chili Crab, Bolognese, and Brick Chicken which were all seasoned to perfection. Smores Dessert was great and exactly what you'd expect camp fire marshmallows and all.",1,,
86,Matt K.,"New York, NY",263,93,22,5.0,7/3/2016,"Another one of Marc Forgione's Tribeca hotspots, this one actually bears his name.  The atmosphere here is very ""tribeca,"" with exposed brick, industrial lighting, and an old elevator shaft right in the middle of the space giving off a very unique rustic yet chic vibe.  Most patrons (whether it be for dinner or just at the bar area) are either locals or finance types considering the exterior is very unassuming on a quiet Tribeca street.While the atmosphere here is a massive part of the experience, the food menu (which has a distinct American farm to table flare) is unforgettable.  For those at the bar looking for a snack, they have massive communal tables to share anything from Chesapeake oysters, to shishito peppers, to a 24 inch potato chip (it's incredible).  For those looking for a full meal, enjoy anything from squid spaghetti, to chili lobster (a clear local favorite), to the bell & evans chicken.  As with all of Marc's spots, this is truly one of those establishments where you need to sample as much of the menu as possible. Oh, and don't forget about the desert.  There are few other places in New York City that could make something as simple as milk and cookies or s'mores so memorable (fun fact:  they have a ""forager"" on call whose job it is to collect the sticks necessary to make the s'mores) .The service is world class, with the entire waitstaff there to make you feel at home and answer any random questions you may have (see my fun fact above).  Of course, the entire experience doesn't come cheap (most of the dinner menu is in the $30-40 per item range).  That said, this is one of those New York establishments that makes Manhattan dining so legendary.",4,,1

Theres complimentary champagne for birthdays and a handwritten note from Marc Forgione himself! It's little details like these that really make a restaurant experience special.We orders the lobster appetizer to start with which was my favorite dish. Awesome depth in flavor and the toast with the broth was so so good. It also tastes somewhat similar to the lobster sandwich that is served inside The Pennsy (next to penn station) which is also owned by Marc Forgione. If you're looking for something cheaper this is a good alternative. We ordered the chicken under a brick as our entree which was really good, but it didn't blow me away. They cooked the chicken extremely well so the skin and the meat were both super yummy. However the flavor was lacking a little. It tasted kind of salty and it was quite heavy due to the amount of butter that they use. For desert we had smores which had just the right amount of sweetness. Overall - be prepared to eat! The food they serve is quite heavy so just keep that in mind when ordering. Loved the ambience in this restaurant, it was very farm to table but with a slightly modern twist.",,1,

Unfortunately our server Mark R. really put a damper on our dining experience by constantly pushing us to order more food. For 4 girls we ordered 3 apps, chicken for 2 (which was more like for 3) and a steak entree. Mark kept insisting that it wouldn't be enough food and suggesting more dishes. We kindly told him we would order more if it wasn't. (We ended up not being able to finish our entrees.) At the end of the meal although we were all already stuffed, we ordered the 10 min cookie to share. The dessert comes with two cookies which was perfect for us because we really only wanted something for the birthday girl. But AGAIN Mark was pushing for us to get more. I understand trying to ""upsell"" and being helpful, but learn to read the room. We all left with a really sour taste in our mouths.

We both had fish (seabass) and it was excellent.  Very flavorful.  Portions aren't huge and yes, they are a bit pricey but I expected it.    The best part about the night was the sommelier and the extensive French wine list.  She was super knowledgeable and recommended a fantastic white wine.

We had Kyle as our waiter and he was just amazing. So attentive and so caring about our menu needs. We're halal eaters and when they brought out the starter soup he ran up and asked if we were okay with chicken broth (which were not) and so he prevented us from eating something that wasn't ok for us. Great catch on his part for reading his customers. Now on to the food, my husband had a ribeye steak and I had a burger... I can honestly say that was the best burger and steak we have ever tried!

The restaurant isn't fancy in that it doesn't have white tablecloths, but the service is definitely that of fine dining. They gave us a delicious amuse Bouche of tomato soup with a cheese puff, and then we had the chili lobster and the chicken for 2. My dad was confused on how a chicken could be $62, but after we had it we understood. The chicken was moist and flavorful and came in a boiling hot cast iron skillet. It was served with greens and potatoes and was simply amazing. The chili lobster was the perfect amount of spicy and I licked the plate clean.

The restaurant was dark, homey and bit loud, but the food was inventive, flavorful and delicious. We selected the 9-course tasting menu and were prepared to be skeptical. Each course arrived with an explanation of its construction by a knowledgeable and very friendly waiter. And each course added a layer of complicated flavors and delights for the palette without being fussy. Chef Forgione appeared and shaved truffles onto the baked potato ravioli and later reappeared for conversation and photos.The Hiramasa and BBQ Oysters were surprisingly great appetizers new to us. The Chilled Lobster reminded us of our visit to Singapore and made our tongues dance. The Szechuan Flower which cleansed our palettes and gave us a tingle was a revelation. The main courses of halibut on a cauliflower puree infused with a brown butter, raisin and hazelnut sauce and the buttery chicken under a brick were home runs.The secret egg and the S'mores desserts topped off an amazing, well-paced and sumptuous meal. We left already planning which friends to bring back for round 2. If you are looking for something different and terrific at expense account prices, give Marc Forgione a go.",1,,

102,Miles K.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,101,64,4.0,3/10/2016,"Went here for my wife's birthday recently and was fairly happy with our meal. The ambiance is great, it's like you're a guest in Chef Marc's living room. Unfortunately, the meal failed to live up to the greatness that we experienced our first time visiting the restaurant about two years ago.To start, we had the Spanish octupus, which was fantastic. The texture was unlike any octo I'd had before and the sour orange was a great feature. We had a duck confit as well, which was very tasty. The mains left a little more to be desired. The Yellowfin Tuna was just flat out bad. It had been seared, but lacked both the flavor and the texture of any seared fish I've eaten. In fact, the fish had the texture of overcooked fish, which is crazy given the fact that it was only seared. The 30 dry aged ribeye was ok, although we were both expecting better. About half as good as the dry aged porterhouse at Delmonico's. Both desserts were fantastic. My wife had a Creme Brulee which was as close to perfect as you can get and my Carrot Cake Semifreddo was really nice too. Had great wine suggestions all night.The service was also fantastic and our server was very nice to take the Yellowfin tuna off our bill after she realized how much we disliked it. There are better options in the area for meals in this price range.",3,,
103,Greg W.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",0,6,1,3.0,3/6/2017,"Overall, my fiancé and I both thought the restaurant was just OK. For the $ we spent, and the food/service we received, we wouldn't go back. We'd put this on par with lots of other Manhattan restaurants you could go to for half the price. We really liked the look/feel of the space - an upscale rustic vibe with lots of little eclectic pieces. The bill came to $195 total which got us an appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 glasses of wine, and then a dessert shot and cup of coffee. Appetizer - we got the Foie gras and it was very well prepared and plated. Only came with 2 small pieces of toast which really wasn't enough for the amount of Foie gras.  Entrees - I got the duck. It was tasty and very well cooked, but pretty salty for my taste. The portion wasn't very big, but with the appetizer, I had enough to eat. She got the Black Bass.  It was a touch overcooked, but not by much. Again, the dish was really salty. Wine - I got the Bordeaux and she got the Pinot Noir. Both were solid wines. The biggest issue I had with the wine was that the server didn't have a strong recommendation to pair with the entrees. The menu only had 5-6 entrees on it so the wait staff should have been able to provide a suggestion for the best pairing rather than waffling back and forth on his suggestion. Dessert - I just got the Banana Jameson shot. It was a nice little after dinner drink and was definitely unique. She just got a coffee which was good. Overall, it was decent, but not worth the price and nothing really memorable (other than the Banana Jameson shot).",1,,

Updated review",Restaurant ambience was on the darker side. Wish it was a little brighter. Staff extremely friendly.  Selection of wine that was offer was impressive.  Food was Amazing! A MUST order is the Smoking Oyster seasoned perfectly.  We order 3 different Fish dishes and Chicken for one. If you live in the area or work near by it's a must try.  We had the opportunity of meeting and seeing Chef Marc Forgione himself in the kitchen.,,,
107,Sanaa H.,"Manhattan, NY",299,51,79,5.0,3/28/2016,"If you want to experience that licking your fingers and the bowl clean feeling, then dining at Marc Forgione is a must! The restaurant is the perfect embodiment of rustic and antique with stone plates for dining and bookshelves that line the length of one wall with old cookbooks and pictures. You feel like you're at an old friends place having a great meal and never want to leave.We came here on a Friday night with a reservation that was made well in advance and got a cozy table for two along the window. They have a community table as well for those who walk in without a reservation. It's a wooden high table top with stools and would be a great option if you're craving some mouth watering food. We were first brought out the potato buns and house made butter spread. I can't describe how satisfying these were. It was love at first bite and we made sure to order more.For appetizer we ordered the infamous chili lobster with Texas toast. This in itself was quite filling and could probably be ordered as an entree. The buttered garlic toast in combination with the lobster bisque dipping sauce was absolutely delicious. This is what I meant by licking your fingers and bowl clean feeling.For our mains we ordered their Creekstone filet Mignon and the Duck. Both entrees were exceptional and cooked just right. If we were to revisit we would definitely re order those entrees as well as trying the ""Chicken under a brick"". Several people around us had ordered that and it looked amazing. For dessert we went with the basic cookies and milk and left completely satisfied. Baking cookies is an art and it has to be timed just right. The cookies were the perfect combination of golden on the outside and soft on the inside. Again licking the chocolate off of my fingers feeling!",1,,1

They started the night with a sweet note, then 2 glasses of champagne to start the night. Beautifully presented potato bread with homemade butter. Ahhh... homemade butter with ?garlic always gets me. If a place is willing to spend time on a complimentary butter, they already win in my book. Then... we ordered the Brick chicken. We never order chicken but we did at this place because EVERYONE raved about it. It. was. The. Best. Chicken. I've. Ever. Had.",2,,2
111,James W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2729,1914,8247,5.0,12/26/2015,"In a word: WOW. The ambience is fantastic and spacious in a rustic way. Service was good although they definitely tried to upsell us, which I never appreciate. The main attraction here is what it should be - the food, so let's get started.1. Bread: A little mound of lightly baked round bread that was absolutely delicious! The garlic butter that came with it I was licking off the butter knife.2. Cheese puffs and cucumber-fish filling: This was a complimentary course that started off our meal after the bread. The puff had that amazing pop sensation when one bit into it. The cucumber-fish filling was good, but the puff took the prize of the items on the plate. 3. Foie gras: This dish came with black bread, bee pollen, slices of some fruity thing, and oxtail marmalade.. You get two solid cuts of foie gras, which was fantastic. 4. Amish Veal Tenderloin, boudin blanc, Tokyo turnips, roulade pommes de terre: I really loved this dish, although the reviews were mixed at the table. It was a combination of two meats in medallion form. Juicy, tender, interesting.5. Specialty duck: This was not on the menu, but I'm glad we ordered. I can't describe it except to say that it was done the right way. Crispy skin, tender and flavorful meat but not too ""gamey."" It's a decent size too. The sauce that comes drizzled over it is awesome.6. Bell & Evan's Chicken under a brick: This dish comes with broccolini, potatoes, and large pieces of deboned chicken. It serves 2 people, although I probably could have eaten this whole thing myself given how good it was. The fat and oil that was on the bottom of this cast iron tray was incredible. I was trying to coat all my food with it. But the CHICKEN. Likely the best I've ever had. Evenly tender and juicy all the way through with a crispy skin. It looks so simple, but I've never had chicken done this well, especially a big one like this. Bravo.7. Milk and cookies: Those soft melt in your mouth cookies, dipped in the milk. Good for sure, but probably would be been better to opt for the s'mores. It was Christmas eve though, so thought the milk and cookies for Santa was appropriate.8. Margarita cheesecake with citrus marmalade: This was decent, but pretty standard. Nothing amazing.Overall, this place had phenomenal items. There were a few that didn't blow me away, but the rest of the dishes really were fresh with lots of creativity involved. The meats are all amazing.",12,5,7
112,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",532,293,1896,4.0,1/27/2015,"The night started out with an amuse bouche which was like an everything bagel bite and a plate of fresh potato rolls with whipped butter. For appetizers, I had the kampachi, baked olde salt oysters, chili lobster, They had already split the kampachi into two for us to enjoy comfortably to ourselves. It was amazing and definitely a highlight of the meal. I was not a fan of the olde salt oysters, yuck. I'd never order it again. The chili lobster was so good but I wished they had a bigger portion to offer. For entree, I had the chicken under the brick. It was amazing. I fell in love with the chicken under a brick, the best chicken dish I've ever had.Minus one star for their dessert selections, the desserts were all disappointing, nothing further to say about it. I'll definitely be back for brunch and dinner! I'm excited to try out other items on their menu.",2,,2
113,Hue L.,"New York, NY",348,88,203,5.0,1/8/2016,"Before I leave or if I ever leave NYC, I definitely need to stop by Marc Forgione again.  The first time we ever ate here was for brunch, which wasn't a bad idea but we also heard that it was famous for the Brick Chicken.  Boy, we figured out why soon enough.  Brunch menu was pretty standard, nothing extraordinary.  (The chicken wasn't on the brunch menu so don't come here during brunch for that!)  But I have to saw the decor was one of the best in NYC.  Now, located in Tribeca, you gotta step up your game as you are setting the table for some of NYC's elite. The main dining area was huge and very fancy.  I would take a co-worker or something more formal here for a classier dining experience.  It kinda reminds me of ABC kitchen but different color scheme.NOW GET THE BRICK CHICKEN.... I'M GOING TO SAY IT ONE MORE TIME...GET. THE. BRICK. CHICKEN.It's amazing.  We had a bunch of other dishes too but nothing compares and honestly that's all I really remember about Marc.  The chickennnnnn.  My favorite chicken dish besides that fried chicken dish from ABC.Loved it and I know you will too!

114,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",277,462,562,5.0,1/15/2016,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go for special occasions. It's also the only restaurant I'll order chicken from. You know how places tend to overcook their chicken to the point where it's so dry? Marc Forgione doesn't do it. I always order the chicken under a brick every time and it's juicy each time. The dish is meant for 2 people, but if you wish, they can make the chicken for a portion of 1. Special occasion or not, I definitely recommend ordering the chili lobster with Texas toast appetizer. It'll cost you the amount of an entree, but it's soo good. The soup base is what makes this dish - I literally can just pick up the bowl and just drink it. However, I just took the bread, which is amazing too, to soak up all of the deliciousness. Extra brownie points because we were given free champagne for my boyfriend's birthday. Also, Marc Forgione happened to be at the restaurant that day and walked around greeting each table. Score because we were able to take a picture with him!",2,1,2
115,Jonathan K.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,319,4,4.0,7/21/2017,Delicious preparations but small portions and steep prices.  The decor is nice - great effort was taken to make this look rustic and barn like.,1,,
116,Dave F.,"Hoboken, NJ",417,624,1367,4.0,1/11/2015,"There is something to be said for going to a celebrity chef's restaurant and seeing him work the room and take the time to go table to table talking to his diners. It shows quality control, and that they care about their diners experience. Came here for a birthday dinner celebration and were welcomed to the table with complementary glasses of champagne and a letter signed by Marc Forgione. These art touches that go above and beyond what you see at most places. The ambiance here is rustic and romantic. The brick and wood and lighting sets the tone for the meal; rustic elegance. To start, we had to go wit the Chili Lobster and the soup dumplings. The chili lobster is an absolute just get. The lobster is served in a chili broth that is rich in seafood and lobster flavor with enough chili to add heat without being overwhelming. The tail is cut into rings and the claw shelled. A few pieces of thick, buttery Texas toast come with this to mop up every drop of the deliciousness. The soup dumplings are a bit of a misnomer, as told to us by our waiter. It's more like tortellini served in a rich broth. It's a good dish, but pails compared to the chili lobster. For our mains, we went with the halibut and the stripped bass. He halibut is served in a ""proposal"" sauce. The story here is that when Marc Forgione made it for someone, when they tried it, they asked to marry him. I get it; the sauce is that good, and this dish is harmonious and decedent. It's another must get. The stripped bass was nice, but again, like with the apps  compared to the halibut just was overshadowed. Desserts, we did the lil shorties, which are basically mini ice cream cones, and the pumpkin cheesecake. Both very solid desserts. This is a great place for a special occasion, as they will go the extra step to make the experience a memorable one. For the food, some of the dishes are truly amazing (chili lobster and halibut) whereas others are simple just really good. This is as solid of a 4 star place as you will ever find, and I'd recommend it without hesitation.",2,,2

The waitstaff was fantastic and attentive without being obtrusive. Perhaps the best part was the bottomless mimosa...we had a leisurely brunch and went through quite a few glasses. Every time I looked, they were refilling our glasses! I'll always love a place that is liberal with the drinks, has great food and friendly staff. Looking forward to our next visit...",1,,
118,Paul Y.,"New York, NY",504,131,117,5.0,12/20/2015,"Fantastic! So I came here because I heard chili lobster, but I left, singing halibut! Let's start from the beginning. The decor was quaint and comfortable. Alittle dim but perfectly fine. Nothing too special.Then the chili lobster and duck tortellini. The Chili Lobster was exquisite. Absolutely phenomenal spice and freshness. The toast and chili could have been a meal in itself, but that would mean none of that delectable lobster. The duck tortellini... Meh. It was good, but I would much rather recommend the lobster.We had ordered the venison and the halibut. The venison came out alittle too cold, but exceptionally well seasoned. The flavor paired with the meat was great. Inspiration to make my own recipe on that. The halibut though... It was life changing. The creamy sauce was the perfect combination to the light texture of the halibut, and with a light crisp on the top, there was no way to beat it. Dessert was a nice maple creme brûlée. Very nicely accentuated vanilla bean in the cream and a light and textured glaze on the top. A very enjoyable and textured finish to the meal.10/10 would eat again.",2,1,2

They were super accommodating as they gave us the corner table with on the house champagne, dessert shots and cookies to go! The waiter was very attentive and knows his craft very well. Service was very attentive and not too intrusive at the same time. Drinks menu before the dinner menu was a smart idea because we hate drinking cocktails and having our food come in the next 5 minutes. The free bread rolls were so good that we asked for more. Chili Lobster app was super delicious. Had the special tuna tartare app but would've been fine with the kampachi tartare. Chicken under a brick for 2 was very flavorful but wish we knew you can ask for a single serving. The leftovers the next day tasted even better! Loved everything!!",,,
120,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,5.0,11/9/2015,"I came in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised by my experience at Marc Forgione. It's truly a delight for foodies because they do food right - and it doesn't hurt that they have good service and amazing ambiance too. My friend and I tried our luck here as walk-ins on a Friday night because I couldn't get reservations, they were booked solid. The hostess very nicely and gently informed me that all their tables were committed for the night and that we could grab seats at the bar or communal tables. We found two empty seats and though the communal tables are not the best for intimate conversations, I was still very happy to be there. The interior here is dark and dreamy - perfect for almost any occasion - romantic date or friend-date. Our waiter was kind of dreamy too. And his food suggestions were right on. The only thing that was a miss was the appetizer (which I did not consult our waiter for)...the black garlic spaghetti was a bit too spicy with little else going for it in terms of flavor. All thoughts of the appetizer were erased from my mind as soon as my halibut arrived. It was a thing of beauty - a thin delicious crust, cooked perfectly, tender and flavorful and served on a bed of hazelnuts. I'm usually not a fan of hazelnuts, but these were great, I don't know how they cooked them, but they did not have their usual overpowering taste, they were perfectly complementary to the fish. Had a taste of my friend's scallops and it was creamy and amazingly delicious. Dessert (the milk and cookies) were equally enjoyable. What drove the whole food experience to a whole new level was the wine (yes, recommended by our waiter) - the Sancerre rouge - you must try it, it's to die for. I can't find a bottle of it anywhere, I'm currently trying to talk the sommelier at my local liquor store into ordering a crate of it. This meal was worth every penny and I can't wait to come back and explore the rest of the menu. I left full, drunk and happy.",5,2,3

122,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",284,130,874,5.0,1/1/2016,"Marc Forgione is one of my favorite restaurants in the world.  I have always had amazing experiences there and I'm excited to write this review.  One time I ate the halibut entree ON THE SUBWAY because I couldn't wait to eat it.  THE SUBWAY, people.  The food is just that good.  I seriously considered starting a petition to get this place's Michelin star back.  Most recently, a group of five of us went to MF for New Years Eve.  We were seated right away.  The restaurant itself is dark and pretty with lots of candles.  They had it all decorated with balloons.  We first ordered a bottle of wine that our server recommended, which was a magnum bottle of Gruner.  Their wine list is reasonably priced which makes it easy to try different things.  MF starts you off with warm, soft rolls with a garlic butter.  Fantastic.  They also usually bring out a small dish, compliments of the chef.  We had a little dish with cucumber and lox spread and little mini ""everything bagels"" stuffed with cream cheese.  Very cute.  We ordered some appetizers to split.  With some of the apps, they will pre portion them out to fit your group size.  We started with the kampachi tartare which is served over avocado in a sweet, fruity sauce with ""potato chips"" on the side.  This is a fantastic appetizer.  The fish is super fresh and the whole thing is very flavorful.  For five people, they allowed us to order 2.5 dishes and then portioned them out for us.  The presentation of this dish is really cool, too.  They give you an herb that numbs your mouth and then a spoon with a small bite of the app.  It's not pretentious at all, either - the servers are always very patient and explain the different dimensions of the dish.  Excellent - and at 17$, a no brainer.We also ordered cavatelli to split - this was good although I preferred the other dishes.For entrees, we split the halibut and the chicken.  The halibut is INSANE.  It's a beautiful piece of fish served with a crunchy topping over hazelnuts, capers, cauliflower, and this SAUCE.  The SAUCE is AMAZING.  I'm not sure what they put in it but whatever it is, it's highly addictive.The chicken is also excellent.  It's served in a oily, fantastic sauce with broccolini, onion crunchies, and potatoes.  It's not quite as good as the halibut, but then again, nothing is.For dessert we ordered cookies and milk for the table.  The cookies are crunchy on the outside and essentially cookie dough in the middle.  I don't care how full you are - you need these.At the end they brought us out little butterscotch candies and were cool that we had to itemize the bill.  Our server was very cool (which is the norm at MF).  He knew a lot about the dishes, had recommendations, and was genuinely a nice guy whose attentive service amplified our experience.  All in all, the experience was fantastic, like it always is.  Main takeaways:1. The food is top notch and you can't go wrong with anything you order.  On past visits, we've gotten the giant potato chips, the duck in a jar, a duck entree (over jasmine rice), etc - everything is good and it's all consistent.2. It doesn't matter where you sit, the service is always great.  If you sit at the bar, you will get the same attentive, knowledgable service as you would at a table.  The bar is first come, first serve and the bartenders are fantastic.  The last time we sat at the bar, we tried their banana whiskey which was really different.  3. From what I can tell, Marc is there a lot.  On one occasion he came out to greet people.   We've also met one of the managers who sat at the bar with us.  Everyone who works here is really nice and approachable.  4. Although this place isn't cheap, it is well worth the money and it's pretty much perfect for every situation (date, family, client dinners).  I love Marc Forgione - everything about it is awesome.",1,,1

We went to his restaurant with some friends that enjoyed the foodie scene. We ordered baked potato ravioli as a starter, and immediately after our first bite we all new that we wanted a second order. So we did! Next we had the yellowtail tartar which I think is the best thing in the menu. For the main entrees, we had roasted chicken and skate. I normally don't order chicken for dinner, I'm usually a steak or seafood person when it comes to places like these. However, the chicken is unbelievable and arrives sizzling in butter as it arrives to the table. It's probably one of the best and I had. Highly recommend it!

Not that we were looking to have a vegan meal, but it would have been nice to complement the fish/seafood dishes with some greens. The chef did prepare some veggies for us 'off menu', but they tasted unnecessarily buttered up (would have been fine with a touch of olive oil and some herbs).  We didn't have dessert, but they looked eclectic and tasty.

131,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,4/20/2014,"The namesake restaurant of the well-known Iron Chef, Marc Forgione has been serving ""contemporary American"" dishes for nearly six years. Both the website and a few shelves in the dining room still boast the one-star Michelin awards from 2010 and 2011, an almost wistful reminder of the glory days from before. Yet, on the Tuesday evening that my friend and I entered, the restaurant was still bustling. Nearly every table was full and the dining room was filled with sounds of chatter and glasses clinking - a promising sign for the evening to come. After being seated and given the menu, the two of us eventually decided to get our individual appetizers and go for the one ""for two"" entree listed on the menu.To begin the meal, I decided on ""Pop Pop's Sunday Gravy"" Cavatelli. Despite a homely name, the pasta turned out to be anything but. Served in a small metallic cocotte, it contained cavatelli pasta interspersed with lamb belly and an aged beef ragu. Paired with a red sauce and topped off with a crusty parmigiano reggano, it was a rich and savory dish, with flavors that all worked in tandem. There's a hint of gameyness from the lamb, acidity from the sauce, and plenty of texture with each bite of the cavatelli; overall, a very well-composed dish.Our entree had to be the Bell & Evans Chicken Under a Brick. Meant to be shared between two people, the dish is served in a large cast-iron skillet, featuring two pieces of roasted chicken thigh and drumstick paired with yukon potatoes, broccoli rabe, and the all-encompassing ""pan drippings"". Here, the simple roast chicken is done to justice; the meat is tender and juicy (compliments of cooking it ""under a brick""), seasoned generously, and keeps a crispy, lightly browned layer of skin. The accompaniments only elevate the dish further, as the broccoli rabe and potatoes add some more diversity of taste and texture, and the roasted shallots and capers at the bottom of the pan were a nice surprise. It's a generous portion even for two, and well-worth its menu price.While Marc Forgione might have lost some of its luster over the years, it's nonetheless held its place in the city - and for good reason. The food, while simple, is well-conceived and cooked, and the focus remains on the end dining experience for guests.",13,6,11

My coworker and I took some clients here for dinner and since we had 8 people, we did the family style menu. If you have the chance to do this, it is a must. We got to try the majority of the menu and everything we had, we loved! The lobster toast was my favorite and these mini everything bagel and cream cheese puffs! Also, the drinks were very creative and tasted great as well! They give you huge portions and there was a lot of food leftover!",,,

Highly recommended.",,,
134,S M.,"New York, NY",0,132,9,4.0,7/11/2017,"The atmosphere here was almost my favorite part -- really nice rustic design that's dressed up a little with some romantic lighting. And on a nice summer night, the front is left opened up to the small patio. Despite the semi-casual vibe, I could tell from the second we sat down that it was going to be a 'fancy' meal from the excellent service, amuse-bouche, etc...but most importantly, the prices. I think that's what's keeping me from 5 stars -- the food was delicious but the restaurant felt a little too laidback for what we spent, if that makes any sense. Anyway, I'd recommend it for a non-stuffy special occasion but just be prepared to spend $60+/person plus drinks. Our favorites were the lobster Texas toast app and the s'more dessert, which had the cutest presentation with a flickering twig.",,,

My favorite dishes are the Kampachi Tartare, Laotian Sushi and Chili Lobster, Texas Toast! Must get The Egg for dessert too! But really you can't go wrong! Drinks are awesome here too.

137,Jeff G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,25,8,2.0,6/23/2016,"Why is this place so well rated on here? Is it the celebrity-chef factor? Has it gone downhill recently? Did I eat there on an off night? Honestly, I don't know, but I will say that my ratings and comments reflect the expectations of s restaurant of this kind of reputation.I ordered the ribeye steak for my entree, and was served a beautiful looking piece of meat, though that's about all that was on the plate - a few dry flavorless green onions, some rather flavorless esgargot, and similarly benign mushrooms. The overall effect was that of monotony - little acid or other flavored going on to break up the beefy/fatty steak flavor profile - a big disappointment for a steak priced in the $46 range.My husband ordered the brick chicken, which was delicious but swimming in a dish containing so much oil that it was distracting and a bit cloying.Our martinis were rather meh, and the appetizer has already been forgotten. Our waiter avoided our table the entire time we ate our appetizers, and only came back and asked how everything was once the plates had been cleared - not seeing that I was so dissatisfied that I sent back part of the steak to be trashed. He did apologize and got the manager to come over, and she comped the martinis, but we were left feeling disappointed and won't be returning. Why do that when NYC has so many restaurants worth exploring and returning to?",3,,1

Amazing.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken under a brick. Even though that dish is meant for 2, they were able to make it for him as a dish for 1.

Use your hands! Dip that toast into the sauce, it was spicy but the lobster flavor was so rich that have you wanting more!- Passionfruit Cheesecake: Aroma of this dessert was beautiful.

143,Jay H.,"New York, NY",186,71,0,4.0,4/14/2017,"Before dining here, something about this place really made me want to dislike it. I don't know what it was - perhaps the elite ""Tribeca-ness"" it exudes, perhaps the small menu I had seen online, perhaps for no reason at all. I walked in half-scowling and ready to find fault. The restaurant is lit by low lights and candles. The whole place is like an old wooden library, with books and trinkets lining the walls in a wonderfully tasteful manner, but curiously louder than expected for such a place in TriBeCa. We were immediately sat, grateful that the table with 3 energetic children next to us was leaving, and I was handed a cocktail menu/wine list. No other menus, nothing for my girlfriend dining with me. It's ridiculous: a wooden board with about 60 sheets of paper clipped to it. Each sheet is cut to 20% of the size of a regular sheet of paper, meaning there is very little on each page and you spend an age going through it unnecessarily. Strike 1. I ordered wine for the table, and finally we got our food menus. The rest of the night was a different story. We had course after course of absolutely immaculate food combined with exceptional service. The wait staff don't miss a beat here. Stand-out item on the menu is the halibut en croute. Get it, see what incredibly treated halibut tastes like. This place is expensive, so I won't be going every night, but the food is spectacular.",,,1

The vibe at MF is rustic and casual but fun.  The chef even came out to describe the dishes to us which was quite a treat.,,,
145,Nga C.,"Brooklyn, NY",515,467,1964,5.0,5/16/2015,"Came here only for drinks and this venue was OUTSTANDING!!We were immediately drawn to the aesthetics of the restaurant and bar area while we were in search of a place to sit down and relax.Once seated at the bar, the bartender gave us our menu and he was very chilled yet attentive. For me, that's a great combination to have because it creates comfort and trust. After asking for his recommendations, we ordered two glasses of white wine (can't remember which one) while our friend ordered a whiskey. I don't know about my friend's whiskey but my white was chilled perfection and it tasted so great!The restaurant has a lively vibe and is illuminated at the right lighting. A perfect place to bring a date. It also has a nice flow of energy despite us arriving around 10am and the restaurant was still pretty crowded (relatively speaking of course).I would definitely come back here and try their food. Some of the dishes they brought out smelled incredible and if that doesn't tempt me to return then I don't know what will!!!",2,,

Updated review","I hope this restaurant is here for all of eternity.  I've eaten here probably 10-15 times over the past 3 years.  The service is arguably the best in the city as the staff makes you feel right at home.  Additionally, the food is flavorful and fresh.  The chili lobster as a starter is my favorite and the brick chicken for an entree is the juiciest chicken I've ever had.  Bottom line:  If you're looking for great food in a warm atmosphere surrounded by people that truly care about your experience...eat here!",,,
147,Sarah Z.,"Baltimore, MD",0,2,0,4.0,1/3/2017,"The atmosphere is totally cool in here. Saw it on a blog post for 10 most romantic restaurants in NYC - while I don't necessarily agree with the title, it's still a cool spot.The inside is full of exposed brick and wood. The tables are pretty close together, and it can get kind of loud on a ""date night"" (Thurs, Fri, Sat..)Drinks are great but pricey - they have an excellent selection of whiskey, but you get what you pay for.The food was absolutely impeccable. The potato roll(which is complimentary) is light and fluffy, and the scallion butter was the perfect combo. Next came their version of an everything bagel(also complimentary) - a small little tot filled with vegetable cream cheese - placed on top of a small stone pot containing their mushroom soup.We ordered the scallops for an appetizer. They said it was meant for one, but my girlfriend and I split it just fine. The sauce it comes with is spot on, and the scallops were perfectly cooked.Our entree was the Chicken on a Brick - HO. LY. SHISTA.Two large chicken breasts, two whole roasted potatoes, and broccolini cooked in a giant cast iron brick; drippings and all. Something your great grandmother would have made on a Sunday with the whole family at the table. It's rustic, savory, and everything just kind of melts in your mouth. There aren't many times in my life that I have a meal I'm unable to replicate in my own kitchen - but, I will say without hesitation that this was definitely one of those times.Well done!(the missing star comes from the noise level and the inadequate seating. I know more than I'd ever like to about the lives and misadventures of the couple to my left and right.)",,,

The husband and I had a 8pm Broadway show to attend and I really did not want to dine in the theatre district. I made an early reservation here and let them know when we arrived - they happily got us out on time and we never felt rushed.I loved the ambiance here. Very rustic and everything was lit by candles. Every person we met - from the hostess, to our waiter to the random people just stopping by our table were SO friendly. Like overly friendly. We were very tempted to try one of their tasting menu's - they all sounded SO good - but knew we were sadly on a time crunch. We ending up ordering some of the more popular dishes that I had read so much about - Chili Lobster and Chicken for Two (both of these are MUST orders!).I know I have been giving out a lot of 5 star reviews lately but every single bit of our meal here was pretty close to perfect. The fresh baked rolls at the beginning, the amuse brought out before our meal, the insane taste of the chilli lobster, the ridiculous butter covered chicken dinner. Everything was honestly out of this world. We were so stuff from our dinner that we sadly had to turn down desert. Maybe next time.There are so many other things I want to try here so I feel like I will definitely be back. I also want to come on my birthday - I saw some hand written notes from the chef as well as complimentary champagne for people celebrating events. yes please.",2,1,3

156,Biru S.,"Mamaroneck, NY",321,658,142,3.0,3/7/2015,"My wife and I were extremely excited to try this restaurant out as we have previously dined at American Cut and loved it.  Till this day my wife boldly claims that it is one of her top 5 favorite restaurants of all time.  We walked towards the restaurant and the first thing that we noticed was the ""B"" sanitary rating on the door..... I understand that some of these inspectors can be a real PITA, but it's Marc Forgione! come on now..........We originally had a 10PM reservation but they very nicely bumped me up to a 9:15 reservation after a quick phone call. We ended up showing up at about 8:45PM(friday night) and we were seated promptly.  They dont have a formal coat check but the woman at the check in will take your belongings and will give you a ticket.They started us off with some onion butter and some warm rolls - very nice.  We skipped the appetizer just because we prefer to keep some space for dessert.  My wife went with the dover sole lobster roll and I went with their dry aged rib eye.  Shortly after ordering our courses, they dropped off a little plate with two cucumbers with some seafood on top along side an ""everything bagel"" bite.  It was good :).We ordered a few cocktails off the cocktail list, all of which were decent but nothing amazing.  I did however order a traditional whiskey sour which will rival any of the top cocktail lounges in NY.  I'm talking gimlet glass, top notch single malt whiskey, egg white, sour mix made from scratch, shaken very aggressively with tiny shards of ice and finished with bitters squeezed out of a medicine dropper. AMAZEBALLS.(If i came to this restaurant and had nothing but the free bread and 8 of these whiskey sours, I would've given this place 5 stars).Now on to the mains :(....My wife's dover sole lobster roll looked pretty. It was a small portion as expected but the dover sole was overcooked. It's such a beautiful cut of fish and it was her first time ever trying it and after much hyping it up, she was dissapointed. Bummer.  My ribeye steak was cut circular so it looked more like a filet mignon.  It was served up to a nice medium rare but it was tough to cut in to.  Maybe it was the shape? Maybe it was the knife? Who knows.  The potatoes that came along side this dish were great.  The onion relish that it was served on top of was nice too, though it did taste a bit ""ketchup like"" to me.For Dessert, we went with their banana brulee.  Not impressed.  What's with the chocolate cookie crumble on the side? What's with the teaspoon sized serving of ice cream?",2,,

I didn't think I needed to inspect my food to insure it was done correctly. When we told the surly waiter, a simple I'm sorry would have sufficed, he fought me to the floor saying they were already cooking me a new one - which I didn't want.

One is awestruck by the detailing of the interiors.  Now onto the food... You know the food is going to be awesome if the bread placed infront of you vanishes in less than a few minutes! The potato rolls were outstanding so much that we asked for extra helping for the kids! We wanted to try their famous chicken under a brick which is awesome!

I  know food and food service pretty well. We came to this restaurant and were able to get a table which was great and I was excited because this is a celebrity chef restaurant who was successful in iron Chef. Normally I love affected food with staff that take the restaurants seriously but not when they're snobbish to me (a person). Snobbish about the food sure, but when the waiter stop looking at me when he's describing the food I was a little hurt. We went with our family members who are long time Trebekah residence, and my brother-in-law is kind of cute and funny so I get why the waiter was talking to him but it was very odd how he stop looking at me altogether. I was not being  or weird or rude I was just trying to ask about the food because I was excited to try some different things. I do not love country pate that comes with mismatched pieces of meat in a brick that's then sliced into pieces... So when the special sounded like it was going to be that I questioned it. I believe that this Set off the waiter. HaaaaI ordered the fois gras  that was on the menu and with its pairings it was spectacular. Everybody at the table ordered the ""Dover sole lobster roll"" my husband gave  me a bite and it was delicious and very interesting. I had the halibut en Croute Hazelnuts, Sauce ""Proposal"", it was prepared beautifully and the crust was very interesting and crispy, I thought that the sauce was too bitter, understanding that it's supposed to be bitter but it lacked balance. (In just saying) it probably would've been better with a different class of wine but when I ordered the old-fashioned Chardonnay the guy practically choked... I cannot drink red wine sadly so I still like a full bodied wine, whatever I'm almost 50 years old, so I can like what I like. The waiter presented me with a glass of wine that was delicious but far from what I was looking for for my meal. Oh well, all in all the food was really delicious and the atmosphere very hip but cozy at the same time. I think it's a shame that sometimes New Yorkers chalk up the attitude is just par for the course... I've been to very excellent restaurants where the people have been incredibly friendly and welcoming and I've had just is great food.",,1,

Wow, is really all I can say.We were able to snag the dredded early bird reservation on a Saturday night even having called one month to the day. Nevertheless, at 6:30 the place was hopping and we snuck in to some seats at the bar to enjoy a cocktail. The mixologists are nothing short of miracle workers. The two gin cocktails were spectacular, herbacious and refreshing. I enjoyed the Piedmont Italian red by the glass..elegant, nice legs. Worth noting, I was ambivalent about which red to order so the bar tender gave us a taste of both the Garnacha from Spain and the Italian I chose.We weren't rushed to our table even though we lingered a bit at the bar past our reservation time. Prime table in the front which gave us a great view of the bar/windows and well-healed but unpretenious crowd that milled about. Our server has been at the restaurant for 5 years and you could just tell. He was professional with a witty sense of humor and made wonderful recommendations. All but one of us were prepared to do the tasting menu but alas, we opted to order a la carte vowing to come back again.We sampled the farro salad which was creative and yummy, the tete du cochon (a poached egg on top of a crab cake)...also unbelievable. I enjoyed my hamachi in a dashi broth but the star of the appetizer course (as insisted upon by our server) was the kampachi. This is no ordinary raw tuna prep I promise you. FIrst, you chew on a tiny herb on the ceramic spoon...pow...explosion that is then matched only by the flavors in the tuna 'terrine' if you will! The flavors combine so well for this powerful burst of flavors I have never had. Apparently this is one of the few items which they keep on the menu as it changes season to season. And it is obvious why.Amongst the four of us, we had the chili lobster with Texas toast, the duck entree, a lamb saddle special which was knock your socks off and a half portion of the famous chicken under a brick. Yum....don't knock it til you try it...the chicken is a star! But so is the duck as was the lamb. The choices are really tough as all indicators are that no matter what you order it will impress and charm your taste buds.The only less than stellar elements were the desserts. We ordered the more whimsical ones that are designed as throw backs to childhood, aka comfort style desserts: smores and cookies and milk. Both were certainly fine but not on par with the rest of the cuisine. Still...not a reason to stay away. Definitely planning on returning soon to do the tasting. And the bonus is that all of that food and a few drinks each amounted to a bill of about $230 per couple. Kind of a bargain given the entire experience particulary compared with other like fine dining establishments in the best city in the world. (wink wink)",,,

175,Cara H.,"Jersey City, NJ",10,29,18,5.0,1/20/2015,"I went here with my parents and boyfriend for my birthday last week. I'm so glad I chose this restaurant to celebrate, because the atmosphere was cozy and contemporary and the food was delicious.My advice is to stick with the seafood on the menu, which is clearly the specialty. The kampachi, yellow tail and scallops appetizers were all delicious. The halibut and striped bass entrees were INCREDIBLE. Someone in our party ordered a beef entree, which was good, but couldn't compare to the fish. The fish were both cooked perfectly with the best sauces I can remember eating. The halibut comes with ""sauce proposal"" which the waiter explained gets its name from how women want to ask Marc to marry them after they've tried it. After trying the sauce for myself, I think the name is warranted!Plus, the dessert selection is great! The coconut semifreddo and the pumpkin pie souffle are both beyond description!",1,,
176,Nichole K.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,166,1,4.0,3/14/2016,"Love the ambience. When we walked in there was an overwhelming smell of bacon. I don't like bacon but I know that's not normal so I feel another person would love it. The kampachi was incredible. The rabbit was amazing. My friends' had the snapper which was good, the the halibut of which I would really recommend to anyone if you are going. That said, my tuna wasn't very good. It was sort of tough. The desserts were superb. The s'mores dessert was honestly one of the best chocolate desserts I have ever tasted. I would go back because the food was good as was the service.",,,
177,Will S.,"Chicago, IL",0,501,1,4.0,2/25/2017,"Return? - Yes. We came for the Valentine Day fixed menu so would like ot come back to try the regular menuAtmosphere (4) - Open, warm, easy to carry on a conversation. Nice bar on the other side as wellFood (4) - Don't remember all of the courses but the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the duck (too fatty)Drinks - 2 glasses of the Loimer ($32) and 2 Kettel One Martinis ($24)Service (5) - Fre=iendly, helpful, attentive.

178,Vicky P.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,18,4,5.0,3/12/2017,"I am a huge Marc Forgione fan from watching Iron Chef, so it was an absolute pleasure to be able to dine at his restaurant, and I was certainly not disappointed. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with rustic decor, and the staff were all attentive and kind. The dark lighting during dinner made for a very romantic and cozy ambiance. Like many of the other reviews, definitely recommend the chicken under the brick!!",,,
179,E B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,6,0,5.0,7/6/2017,"Marc Forgione is ""hip and trendy"" with old school quality service and delicious food.  It's essentially the best of both in the sense that it's a lively night out with a good ""buzz"" but you aren't sacrificing on the food.  The restaurant is not cheap by any means, but the quality of the food is excellent.  My girlfriend and I shared the chicken and we both felt it lived up to the hype.  We had a delicious appetizer special and were given an amuse bouche in between.  Marc Forgione is definitely a talented chef and the menu exhibits that.  Cocktails are great too.",,1,1
180,John M.,"West Hartford, CT",26,108,78,4.0,4/23/2015,We did the food tasting . You need a few hours but oh so worth it We had so many great dishes I started taking pictures of each on but got into it after the 4-5 th plate Not big portion but leave full and with a treat ;),,,
181,Laura A.,"Hoboken, NJ",3,21,8,2.0,9/19/2014,"This place has been a long time waiting on my ""go to"" last for brunch. Unfortunately, the experience did not live up to expectations. The website no longer mentions bottomless mimosas, but never fear, they're still there and they're quite good. When ordering our waitress informed us that the kitchen was out of multiple items on the menu (also noticed that the menus themselves were very worn and grungy looking). I settled on their version of eggs benedict, which turned out to be essentially poached eggs with hollandaise on top of some hashbrowns.  Something I could have made at home or gotten from any average breakfast joint around the city. The everything flavored biscuits for the table were by far the highlight of the meal. The space itself is nicely decorated, but more suited for a nighttime vibe. I really wanted to love this place, but if the brunch is an accurate reflection of the capacities of the kitchen, it wouldn't be worth coming back for dinner.",3,,
182,Christine Y.,"New Hyde Park, NY",0,2,2,5.0,6/5/2016,"Came here for my 3 year anniversary back in March, however I still feel compelled to write a review about the lovely experience. First, my boyfriend and I were congratulated in person when we arrived, then we were greeted with a handwritten note on the table-- such a kind gesture! From there on everything was a 10/10 from the quality food to the service; the dishes we ordered were phenomenal and the staff was very attentive. Thank you everyone at Marc Forgione for a fabulous evening, stay amazing! x",,,
183,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",115,11,2,1.0,6/26/2017,"*STEALS YOUR MONEY* They charged my credit card more money than I had signed off for. This ultimately is robbing your customers money.

185,Lauren G.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,18,1,5.0,7/12/2014,"Went to MF last night for the first time and WOW, all I can say is WOW! From the moment you walk in, the atmosphere and ambiance is so warm, rustic, and vintage charm. My bf and I sat outside on the raised sidewalk patio and it was adorable. Now...to the good part.. THE FOOD. Honestly, each dish was better then the next. We got the oysters, spanish octopus/calamari, and chili lobster. If I was in nyc now, i'd go back and get the chili lobster RIGHT NOW! It was AMAZINGGGG. For entrees, the halibut was equally amazing and my bf loved his bass.And lastly, being the s'mores lover that I am, I happily endulged in the s'mores and was not asked to share by my bf (thank goodness bc I wanted every last bit of the s'mores goodness) :pWalking home, my bf and I BOTH agreed, MF was hands down the BEST place we've ever eaten. How the HELL does anyone five this place less then 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!",3,1,
186,Grace C.,"Howell, NJ",11,50,14,5.0,2/13/2015,Came here for an anniversary dinner on the Sunday afternoon. We were seated promptly. Had two glasses of champagne waiting for us as well as a letter thanking us for choosing the restaurant to celebrate our occasion. Very nice touches!Complimentary appetizers - mini everything bagel stuffed with cream cheese and cucumber with a dip (forgot what kind). Both absolutely delicious. The bread is absolutely delicious - certainly worth raving about.We had the chicken under a brick for dinner. It was very well done - very enjoyable. Had this s'mores dessert - probably the best part of the meal. But I'm guilty of having a sweet tooth. Certainly will be back.,,,
187,Daniel P.,"New York, NY",8,76,263,5.0,2/24/2015,The waiter was really friendly and was very knowledgable of the items on the menu. Lobster Chili was absolutely delicious!! First time to ever have lobster prepared that way. I could've just ordered 2 or 3 of these and called it a night.The chicken under the brick was very tasty as well! Overall great experience and would defiantly come back.,,,
188,Steve And Me D.,"Henderson, NV",0,110,45,3.0,2/14/2017,"We were very disappointed with the bland nature of the food - we tried the peppers and the chicken.  Service was absentee and not friendly.  Highlight was the fresh dinner rolls, frankly.  Would not return.",,,
189,Kenny L.,"Jersey City, NJ",273,614,25,5.0,9/15/2015,"""The chicken is kinda life changing."" I forgot whether the waitress said that to us or a neighboring table. That statement helped push me and fiancee to order the chicken for two. We did not regret it. The chicken was a whole chicken, deboned, and it came in a cast iron pan with potatoes, broccoli rabe and pan drippings. Yes, the chicken was pretty near lifechanging, it had perfect, crispy skin and it was still moist. The pan drippings infused this wonderful schmaltziness to ther perfectly roasted potatoes.I'm a little split as to whether shaved truffles are necessary.  I always feel that truffles are overkill as far as the flavor it provides and a sign of conspicuous consumption.  Never ordered the truffles, but the first time I was there, the table next to us, did.  The smell of truffle from the next table complimnted the chicken perfectly.  The next time I came, I did not order the truffles nor did the people at the next table.  Something was missing, but the chicken was still perfect.This place is worth every penny and the chicken is truly life changing.As to the non-chicken items on the menu, I have to say the Iron Chef generally knows how to use salt, even on desserts. I only wish that I made a little bit more money so I can eat here more often.",2,2,
190,Stefanie S.,"Hoboken, NJ",166,31,4,5.0,12/11/2015,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant. My husband took me for my birthday and from the moment we walked in the staff was attentive and courteous. We arrived at our table and there was a signed note from Chef wishing me a Happy Birthday along with complementary champagne. (Who doesn't like that?!) When I was between choosing dishes, the waitress helped me decide and I'm so glad she made the recommendations she did, every bite was delicious! I ordered the lobster with Texas toast, the tuna tar tare for dinner and for dessert my husband and I shared milk and cookies and smores. My husband's kampachi and halibut were to die for. I think this meal was one of the best if not THE best I've had in NYC, probably elsewhere too. The ambiance was perfect! Especially for a winter night. I can't wait to try American Cut and of course make plans to go back to Marc Forgione!",,,1
191,max g.,"Camarillo, CA",3,53,0,2.0,10/23/2016,"The atmosphere and decor were indeed great. The first hostess sat us on the table next to the doorway and was refusing to move us. Lucky for us another friendly one did.  The waiter we got was great. Gave us small history of NYC places and without him the dinner would not have been as pleasing . Good thing he moved to NYC from North Carolina or we would not have had him.Onto the meal: our first morsels were one small dinner roll for each one of us. Next was a tablespoon of complimentary ""soup"" in a dark clay dish with small crouton on the lid. Good thing it was complimentary as it was hardly any soup.The next dish we ordered was BBQ Oysters. You get three of them. We did not like them. They were cooked with an assortment of spices and did not taste good. The scallops were covered with a large sea shell in their presentation. They were good but tiny. They must have come from Micronesia. Their signature brick chicken was good but submerged in a bath of grease with vegetables and potatoes. Lastly the passion fruit sorbet was indeed good. In all, this restaurant is very overrated.  It is very average. Again, our waiter and supporting servers made the dinner worth it. No plans to return. There are too many other good ones to try.",1,,
192,Debbie T.,"Manhattan, NY",29,42,113,5.0,7/7/2015,This restaurant is a combination of rustic charm and comfort food. Located on a tree lined quiet street in Tribeca it provides balcony dining outside the main dining room. Service was prompt and attentive. Excellent cocktails too.,8,5,6
193,Ricardo M.,"Palo Blanco Sector El Eden, Mexico",2,4,6,4.0,10/20/2014,"Marc Forgione was everything. Everyone was so inviting, and the food was astounding. Don't even think about skipping dessert though! That PB&J panna cotta was too good. The only con I can think of was that the margarita was a little tangy for my taste, and a little delay with the check, but nothing that'll keep me from coming back",1,,
194,Lydia C.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,149,242,5.0,5/16/2014,"The chicken! It was definitely one of the juiciest chickens I have ever eaten in my life. Shared it amongst 4 people.All the apps (oysters, tortellini and lobster are a must) and desserts (s'mores, banana split, semi freddo) we order were delish as well. I really do not have anything bad to say about my experience here.Service was great - our waitress was quirky and enthusiastic about the menu. Loved the rustic decor of the restaurant.",2,,
195,Andrew D.,"New York, NY",1,3,0,5.0,2/20/2017,"I've been to Forgione probably 10+ times and tried their regular and tasting menus.   Menu suggestions:My fiancé and I usually order kampachi tartar, chili lobster, and then either split the chicken or do halibut + 1 of the other entrees.  For dessert, we love the cookies.  The kampachi and lobster in particular are sort of the staples, so definitely try one or both if it's your first time going.         Ambience/service/other:Great atmosphere, at the bar and in the dining room.  After searching for him numerous times we finally met Marc the last time we went.  We sort of awkwardly flagged him down but he came over and chatted with us for a bit - he was great.",,,
196,Erum S.,"East Brunswick, NJ",11,23,4,5.0,2/18/2016,"What an amazing restaurant! Hands down, one of the best places I've been to in NYC. I can't remember the apps that we ordered, but they were amazing. Loved the rolls and the delicious garlic butter they served - probably the best I've ever had. My husband got the steak (For Halalies, it was CREEKSTONE :)) and I got the chili lobster after reading the Yelp reviews and both were WOW. I had made a reservation letting them know that it was our wedding anniversary and when we arrived, there was a letter wishing us and signed by Marc himself! Lastly, the service was ahhhhh-mazing!",,,
197,Cutie Patroller ..,"Manhattan, NY",1921,123,850,4.0,2/1/2014,"Hello *\(^_^)/*Iron chef America, Chef Marc Forgione has two other restaurants in Tribeca, American Cut and Khe-Yo, but this is his original spot in Tribeca. There were five of us, and of course we ordered two of the chef's famous dishes: Chili Lobster and Chicken Under a Brick. Both dishes were DIVINE GOODNESS! and perfect comfort food for this weather.  Although I loved those two plates, my favorite was Halibut en Croute, Artichoke, Golden Raisins, Hazelnuts, Sauce ""Proposal"".   The sauce is truly rich and fantastic.At the end of dinner Chef Forgione was so sweet to show up at our table. He told us the story of how he came up with his famous Chili Lobster dish after his  dining experience during an Asia trip. I love love listening to stories like that!! And Chef Forgione gave me his steak knife too! Yay *\(^_^)/* I eat out so much but meeting chefs are always the most exciting part of dining.  The great ambiance and food here is the type where I can come all the time with friends on any night of the week. This place has a New York chic and casual feel to it so it's nice to take visitors or friends from out of town too. How great to know that Chef Forgione spends a lot of his time here, even though he is SuPa busy with all of his work and projects (0).  Thank you chef for the fantastic food and it was wonderful meeting you. xoxoOverall - 4Food - 4Atmosphere - 4Price - $$$$",5,1,4

Now, let's get to the food, which is the best part. We enjoyed the complimentary small bites and despite the waitress revealing the night's specials, we knew we wanted the brick chicken.OH MY GOODNESS! Please do not hesitate because I've never experienced a moist chicken dish (esp with white meat being presented dry in most situations). The crispy exterior with every bite being juicy made my taste buds very happy. This dish can be shared with more than 2 people so please try it!!!",,1,
