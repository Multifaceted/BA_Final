0,Neil B.,"Brooklyn, NY",575,983,1097,3.0,6/1/2018,"Because they do not accept the app for purchases and specials nor do they offer a senior discount, the most I can rate this franchise is three stars. What saved them from a lower score was my personal experiences with those working here which have all been very positive. Special mention goes to Bianca who was very helpful and deserves kudo's for being sure a new employee made my vanilla bean coolatta correctly!",8,5,6
1,Kaley R.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,237,317,3.0,9/26/2017,"I mean, yeah, this place is a mad house. But I would expect nothing less from a location that consistently has hundreds of people pouring in.For such massive amounts of customers this location always has, the service is shockingly really quick. I never wait more than 5 minutes for food and coffee. And you can get one of their five or six deals that has a bagel/muffin/2 donuts/etc with hashbrowns and a coffee for literally $5. A steal. And their ""medium"" coffee is basically the size of a large at most places so that's a win. Also, the pumpkin munchkins are delicious, as are their hashbrowns. Sure, the employees are less than enthusiastic about being there most of the time and it might not be *the* cleanest DD out there, but I get my order quickly and am out in a heartbeat. I'll take that any day, especially when I'm running to catch a train.",,,
2,Nina S.,"Brunswick, ME",260,64,140,3.0,1/4/2018,"I have to be real: it took forever to get my food! I ordered an egg sandwich and hash browns and I felt like I was waiting there for all of eternity. On the bright side, the food was superb and reasonably priced. The good news about the long wait was that I was able to flip through some of the books on display (this Dunkin is inside of a Hudson News). I read a book for teen girls that would make the Bible more relatable. 3 stars.",,,
3,Steve W.,"Queens, Queens, NY",8,3,0,1.0,1/23/2018,"I was disgusted with the coworkers at the cashier today. I entered the store with my co-worker to buy lunch and this short middle-aged Muslim woman with big eyes and glasses and her co-worker with similar appearance who was laughing at me for the way I speak. She found my disability a joke! I left the store holding in the anger. Anyone who plans to stop at this Dunkin Donuts, don't go there. They need to know it's not cool to laugh at disabled people",,,
4,Corisa K.,"Queens, NY",327,108,242,1.0,3/31/2017,I found a long plastic wire in my iced coffee!!! Absolutely disgusting and unsanitary!!!!,,,
5,Lauren Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7,46,72,3.0,9/10/2018,"This Dunkin Donuts is fast and efficient. I always order a Medium Iced Caramel Latte with Almond Milk. I appreciate that it always comes out the same way and tastes the same. Consistency is key when it comes to coffee spots. I love Dunkin Donuts because it is much more affordable than Starbucks and it has more reasonably sized portions. You really get your bang for your buck here. I now understand why America runs on Dunkin, because I definitely run on Dunkin ‍ I also enjoy their Donuts and Bacon, Egg and Cheese Wake Up Wraps. It isn't always fresh, but it is edible if you are really hungry. The only issue I have with this particular Dunkin Donuts location is that it is in Penn Station, which any food place in Penn Station automatically grosses me out, but I do my best to overlook that. I will continue to come to this Dunkin Donuts out of convenience, even though I am aware there are better locations in the world. Overall, I give 3 stars.",,,
6,Sean C.,"Fremont, CA",1056,1460,2756,1.0,5/8/2014,"Inside the New York Penn Train Station, this Dunkin Donuts is the crappiest one ever. Limited, spare selection. I had a smooshed French Cruller served to me, and a Mochachino that was lacking that guilty pleasure feelin' this time. I would have gotten back in line to exchange it, but too many customers were in line to get the last of the donuts. At 11 a.m. #calamity",3,2,3
7,Joe B.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",0,16,1,1.0,12/18/2016,The most accurate word to describe this Dunkin was pitiful. The only shining star of this Dunkin was how quick the service was. It was VERY dirty and there were homeless people in the check out area asking for money as I was checking out. My food and beverage were not pleasant either. My iced coffee had WAY too much sugar and cream and my sandwich and tots were soggy.,,,
8,Erika R.,"New York, NY",0,25,2,1.0,10/27/2014,"If I could give this DD a 0, I would. I love Dunkin donuts and was so excited when I found one right on my way to work...the first time I went here my coffee was beyond terrible. The coffee tasted old and there was not even a small hint of pumpkin. Old burnt coffee and cream...yuck.The second time I ordered a small iced pumpkin coffee...3.04$? Is that a joke? Okay...so then I waited about 5 minutes only for a confused guy who could barely speak English to ask me what I got. A pumpkin iced coffee, cream and liquid sugar. Him- vanilla?Me- no I want pumpkinHim- no pumpkin. You get vanillaMe- no. Do you have caramel?Him- we have French vanilla coffee! AsbshakansbshsbMe- I don't know what the f*ck you are saying and I am late for work, just get me a coffee with cream and liquid sugar!!Him- iced coffee?Me- Jesus Christ are you serious?So when I finally got my coffee, it had no flavor and tons of regular sugar clumped in the bottom.1. Learn English 2. Learn to make coffee, this has been multiple times3. All the pastries and bagels look nasty and old. I've had this problem with a DD in Harlem, by the looks of the staff I am guessing it has the same management.4. Your prices are outrageous. Are you kidding me?This place needs to be shut down. Or burnt down. Whichever works.",,,
9,Johanna G.,"Massapequa, NY",539,369,20,2.0,8/13/2012,"You have got to be kidding me.I love dunkin donuts coffee, way more than Starbucks and just a smidgen more than Timmy Hortons.  So they open up this DD in Penn Station, and I'm thinking ""self, this is great, you can mix it up in the coffee department in the morning, hooray!""My first experience here is most likely going to be my last.  I'm on line with some friends waiting to hop on NJT (don't ask) and the computers go down.Hey, I get that, sometimes there are technical difficulties that aren't in the control of the people working there.  You would think, since there are a few other Dunkin donuts in the terminal, that the employees would direct traffic to another place - or figure out a work around while trying to fix the machines.Negative.  The line is exponentially growing.  I'm next.  My order is simple: Two Medium Iced Coffees, skim and sugar, and whatever weird vitamin water my friend dropped on the counter in front of me.1. The girl legit looked right past us and yelled ""is anyone ordering hot or cold coffee?""  I'm confused, is there other coffee they may be ordering?  Am I not standing directly in front of you, waiting to get coffee?  Wait, yes I am.  Some fella 4 people deep yells ""I am!"", walks up, places his order.  Now, the locals are getting restless.2.  I attempt to regain control and say ""May I order?"" and she goes ""didn't you already do that?"" and walked away.alright, lady, we're about to have a problem, cause I'm getting pissy3. She finally takes my order and tries to ring it up.  Now, remember, the machines are KIND of working, so she rings things up and it comes to $3.85 for my friend.  I hand her a $5.  She looks at me confused, and turns to the person next to her and says ""do you have a calculator"".  At this point, I'm completely incapable of concealing my disgust and comment that had I known I was going to be here for a half an hour, I would have gone to a more capable coffee stand.I really wanted to like you, DD, you should have a test before hiring people.  Like, a simple mathematical test.",1,3,1
10,Emily F.,"Manhattan, NY",30,107,0,1.0,8/14/2012,"I only will review a chain if it's exceptionally good or exceptionally bad.  This one happens to be the later.  In the Dunkin Donuts in suburbia, there usually are only 2-3 people running it at a time.  Usually, no problems.  Here, there were maybe 5 or 6 people and they still couldn't get anything right.  My friend ordered a breakfast sandwich which they gave to someone else, and a coffee that they gave her the wrong size of.  I ordered a bagel not toasted, not buttered (as we both had a train to catch) and they both toasted and buttered it.  Further, everyone else on line seemed to also be having similar issues with their orders.  Before taking our orders, the cashiers were having personal conversations which is not necessarily a big deal, unless your store happens to be in the middle of a train station and your customers are trying to make a train.  OH WAIT, they are.Again, only reviewing this because I hope that the franchisee who opened this one can see how horrible his/her staff is.",1,1,1
