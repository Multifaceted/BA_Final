Will be back soon.food was super flavorful and delicious, not sure why people said it lacked seasoning in some reviews? It's fish.... don't overpower it.",,,
1,Katrina C.,"New York, NY",68,8,1,4.0,9/17/2018,"Came here for dinner last Monday with Mama and Mini-me. The decor is bright and airy. The music is somewhat loud, but they played Aaliyah and some other 90's jams so I'm not complaining. For the love of food...Minnie had the kids meal, fried fish and sweet potato fries which was DELISH!!! They were out of broccoli, which was strange, but I guess sweet potato is healthy enough.  I was craving pasta but didn't want anything too rich so I opted for the seafood with squid ink pasta and tomatoes. The flavor being a bit too mild for me, I added some pizazz with the addition of red pepper flakes, a squeeze of a lemon and some salt! GMa had the reel deal with bluefish (yum), mac n cheese (she loved, but Im not a fan of smokey smoked gouda), corn and zucchini, and kale, quinoa salad, and sweet potato. I couldn't pass on the $1 raw clam deal (half dozen minimum). Though they were very meaty and not as briny as I prefer them to be. Overall it was a great experience. It's our new neighborhood staple and we're looking forward to our next meal there. Will try to post pics from my phone later! Until we eat again, Ciao baby!",,,
2,Olivier C.,"Manhattan, NY",12,22,0,5.0,8/24/2018,"I've been here twice, and both times were amazing! The first was outside. I know summer is fast fading, so I highly suggest taking advantage of the outdoor seating. I had 2 orders of happy hour oysters and a craft cocktail as the sun set. And then I ordered the nightly special. The fish was delicious, and the sides were perfect.The second time, I came for the downstairs movie night. Free popcorn with Bay seasoning, themed shots, and a table app! Still bought some dinner: a delicious fish burrito and crisp sweet potato fries. Highly recommend the movie night AND the food. Make sure to try the craft cocktails.",1,,
3,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,293,616,4.0,7/30/2018,"I've been on a seafood kick this summer so Seamore's seemed like the obvious choice for a warm summer night.The ambiance - nice tables, cool bar seating (although my feet were dangling the whole time because I'm short which wasn't too comfy), good lighting, bomb music playing. Whoever controls the playlist here needs a raise because they're nailing it.The food - a little pricey, but the 2 dishes we tried were dope. We ordered the Reel Deal ($24) which comes with your choice of fish from the daily landing and 3 sides. We went with the Porgy, a white fish suggested to us by the bartender which was spot on. The 3 sides make this dish enough to split - we went with the Mac and Cheese (couldn't try this since I can't have dairy), sweet potato fries, and the summer squash. Perfect dish and great portion. The fish also comes with your choice of sauce served on the side. We went with the charred scallion which I tasted a bit of. It was very good and very garlicky. We also split an app, the crispy squid which was crisped up nicely and a pretty good portion. Not too much, not too little.The wine selection was pretty dope as well. We had the Sancerre and another white from Sardegna, both of which paired well with what we ordered.Would def come back and try the happy hour oysters.",4,2,3
4,George S.,"Newport, RI",260,203,29,3.0,10/22/2018,"Had lunch at Seamore's with my wife and daughter this past Sunday and I was pretty hopeful when I sat down.  What I liked was the entire restaurant was a washed in sunlight from the large windows that surround the room.  The menu was not that appealing and I ended up having a fish taco that was all right.  It said it came with mole but my didn't.  My wife had avocado toast and there was a little too much going on with it and it was tough to eat.  My daughter's lobster cobb salad was very large and she said it was good.  Our server was attentive at first and then when it started to get busy we were left waiting and she forgot to bring the tea my wife ordered at the end of the meal.  Also, as the place filled up it became very noisy and tough to have a conversation without yelling.",2,,
5,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1481,4351,4.0,5/28/2018,"Stopped by for dinner on Cinco de Mayo and took advantage of the $5 margarita deal they were doing. I also had the kale and apple salad, which was delicious, and some of my boyfriend's blackened fish sandwich and sweet potato fries. So good!Only thing is, I wouldn't recommend the outdoor seating. The street is pretty noisy (like all streets, I know) and the tables are super tiny. Still, food is great!",2,,
6,Rob W.,"Brooklyn, NY",219,347,521,3.0,8/13/2018,"My friends and I stopped here to meet for a drink, and decided to stay and eat at the bar.  I'm a big seafood fan, so wasn't really a hard sell.  Food and drink were consistently solid--I had the Beer battered fish sandwich, which was tasty--the pickled veggies on top were a nice, contrasting touch, and the old-bay dusted chips were (of course) an excellent accompaniment.  The fish tacos were another big hit, though the burger a bit less so--perhaps best to stick to the seafood at this seafood restaurant?  The drinks were enjoyable as well.  Not sure if the menu changes a lot, but the Montauk Standard gin-drink is well worth trying if available, with the lovely hint of fresh thyme.  Would prefer a larger and more diverse selection on the wine and beer lists, though the options they had were mostly solid.As noted, we sat at the bar area, which really put a bit of a damper on what was an otherwise enjoyable meal.  The service there was abrupt and impatient enough to unfortunately qualify as rude.  As a lifelong New Yorker, I appreciate the need for speed and occasional brusqueness in service, and I am aware that the bar was mixing drinks for a whole restaurant, but... the noise with which things were shaken discarded right in front of us felt passive-aggressively hostile, and the minimal, condescending actual service we personally received at the bar felt actually hostile, so... that really put a damper on the meal.  I love seafood and would consider trying it again, but I'd make sure to get an actual table.",3,1,2
7,Caroline D.,"Santa Monica, CA",118,137,78,4.0,5/9/2018,"Seamore's is a great spot for a healthy bite. It's so light and airy inside and I love popping by for their happy hour ($6 drinks, $1 oysters). It's nice to be able to have such fresh and healthy options (and a few decadent ones too - I'm looking at you, creamy farro). They have a variety of veggie sides and the fresh catch changes constantly. They also have new specials all the time - and I'm a huge fan of their soft serve. I just wish that they had food options as part of their happy hour like some of their other locations do. Prices could also be better - $20 for a burrito seems a bit high, even if the quality is good. I'll stick to the $1 east coast oysters & $6 pino grig, for now.",3,1,2
8,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1177,35,3.0,7/19/2018,"I'm struggling with this review because the food was amazing, and we had a very friendly and helpful (though not too available) server...but the overall experience was not outstanding. Let's go with 3.5 stars.At 6:30pm on a Wednesday this restaurant was hopping. We had a reservation so we didn't have to wait too long for a table, though most of their tables are either two-tops or larger group share tables. We were three people so we ended up at a group share table, which was fine at first. Our server made sure we took advantage of Happy Hour before it ended at 7pm, so we got $6 proseccos and $1 oysters. The drinks came pretty fast, but the oysters took about a half hour. Following that, we opted to try all the appetizers, skip the entrees, and then go for dessert. The Tuna Poke blew us away, as did the Lobster Mac and Cheese. And we also loved the Scallop Crudo and Crispy Squid. I have no complaints about the food...it was all so good! Also, the Pink Lemonade soft serve ice cream was the surprise of the meal...so fun! But overall, this restaurant was just a little slow with the service and the noise levels were unbelievable. It was so hard to hear my friends  who were directly across from me. We also had some really annoying people seated next to us at the share table towards the end of our meal who took more than their fair share of space. I'd go back, but maybe at a less busy time and maybe to a different location. I really do want to try the Black Spaghetti.",7,3,4
9,Linda D.,"East Bronx, NY",75,264,1433,4.0,7/15/2018,"Came for brunch today. When we got there we decided to eat outside. The Sun wasn't out yet, so it was nice. We like to people watch! We were served very quickly! We ordered two appetizers and and entree to split. Which was more then enough! We ordered the guacamole and chips. The came with the purple nachos! Then we ordered the tuna poke. That also came with the chips!   We then split the fried avocado egg Benedict! It was really good!  Full of flavor and topped with a shrimp and a scallop! Nice place!",3,,
10,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",188,186,541,4.0,3/14/2018,"Came here with a group of 4 during the week for dinner.  It's difficult to get a reservation here, even during the week, but we finally found a weekday time that worked for us.I thought the food was good and overall pretty reasonably priced.  We ordered guacamole for the table to share and it was yummy.I ordered the blackened fish burger and was very pleased with it.  The avocado, fish, aioli etc. all went great together.  Unfortunately they don't have regular fries (I don't like sweet potato fries), so just got the side salad with the burger (probably better health wise in the long run).Other people ordered tacos and regular burgers and seemed to enjoy them.  They don't let you mix and match tacos though, so if you want fish tacos - they come in 2 per order, and you have to get 2 of the same one, which was kind of annoying.This is a solid option in the neighborhood.",2,1,1
11,Sherry J.,"Manhattan, NY",177,136,573,2.0,4/16/2018,"Got their watermelon Bellini and Bloody Mary for brunch. Also ordered the fried avocado benedict and fish cake bennies. On the menu it says the benedict comes with seared scallops and shrimp. It was one scallop, one shrimp. The fish cake was not your average stuffed fish cake. It was made with strips. I don't think I would ever go back for the food. The service was great and the location was good. We only went to check it out because they provided outside seating.",,,
12,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, NY",30,4,1,5.0,8/17/2018,I've been to this location of Seamore's quite a few times and I've always been very pleased with their varied selection of food/drinks and their service! The staff is so friendly and are always available to give recommendations when I can't decide what to order. I love sitting at their bar when I'm dining alone because the bartender usually chats with me =)Order their scallops whenever they're available! They are great on a salad. Any of the fish I've had there is always fresh and delicious!!,,,
13,Lauren G.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",84,61,42,4.0,7/26/2018,"Cute and bright interior, good menu. I had the mussels for brunch. The broth was great, had to use a spoon for the remainder of it after soaking up what I could with the breadsticks! Also enjoyed ""a lil honey for your dew"" off the drink menu.  With so many places to eat in the city, I don't necessarily know that I'd go out of my way to eat there, but will keep it on my list for the future.",,,
14,Sasha K.,"Jersey City, NJ",190,62,151,4.0,3/22/2018,"In a time where I feel like red meat dominates (at least on Instagram and in the food influencer world), it's great to have a spot dedicated to seafood. We came here earlyish on a Friday night (around 6:45) and there was already a wait of 25-30 minutes, which we expected since we know how popular Seamore's is. Fishbone, the speakeasy-style bar downstairs wasn't quite open yet downstairs, but they told us to head down anyway.Fishbone has a dark, cozy space and the bartender knew his stuff. He was extremely attentive and helpful in deciding what we were going to order once we got a table. (This was after he told us everything was amazing, which is great, but not all that helpful haha). We ordered a couple of beers and waited to be texted for our table. 30 minutes went by and I went back upstairs to check with the hostess with our table, which we got seated at no more than 5 minutes later. We were seated near the door, so it was a little chilly given that it's winter and all the cold air was coming in as people entered and exited. I'm not really a fan of wearing my coat while I'm eating indoors. Other than that, our server took our drink orders and food orders fairly quickly.We started with the guacamole (since I'm a vegetarian) and that came out fairly quickly. It was well-seasoned and super creamy. Could have used a few more chips, though! It then took more than 30 minutes for our food to come. The waitress could tell we were a little tired of waiting and that it was taking way too long for a salad and the Reel Deal and offered to buy us a drink. Once our food came, we were very pleased - as the bartender downstairs said, everything is good, and he wasn't kidding. I got the Kale & Avocado salad, which was actually a really large portion. It was lightly dressed, super flavorful, and definitely filling. My boyfriend got the Reel Deal with skate, mac and cheese, sweet potato fries, and charred broccoli. The skate was cooked well and was very light and not fishy in taste. The mac and cheese was a little cold, but still very good. The only real complaint about the plate was that the broccoli was definitely steamed, not charred, which isn't nearly as delicious.We will definitely be back, but will be sure to make a reservation and ask for a table not near the door.",,,
15,Tirso G.,"Burbank, IL",13,3,0,1.0,11/7/2018,"We were seated at 6:40. In addition to the regular menus, the server also gave the Happy Hour menu. The server didn't greet us until maybe 10 minutes after. She grabbed our drinks and when we ordered, she told us that the happy hour ended at 7 pm. It was literally 7:03. The food itself wasn't spectacular, lobster mac N' cheese was decent (not enough lobster. Just another restaurant on the block, no reason for me to go back.",,,
16,Peggy W.,"New York, NY",529,185,191,4.0,3/5/2018,"Simple done well! I didn't come here with high expectations, and generally don't get that excited about seafood, but wow was Seamore's freaking delicious. I highly recommend getting ""The Reel Deal"" ($24), which gets you one of the fish they have that day, a sauce, and three sides. I ordered grilled shrimp with charred scallion sauce and charred broccoli, kale avocado salad (delicious!), and sweet potato fries for sides. I don't think the offerings for The Reel Deal is very unique, nor are large parts of the menu, but Seamore's does the basics really, really well. The service is also friendly, quick and efficient. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and open, which made for a nice dining experience. I'll be back to try other fishes and other sides!",,,
17,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",280,554,265,3.0,6/18/2018,"This is a seafood focused restaurant chain that has several locations throughout NYC. I've tried most of their starters (plates to share) and my favorite was the tuna poke and crispy squid. The poke was really fresh and so delicious that I almost didn't want to share with my friends  The crispy squid is good - fried seafood is generally a safe bet.For my main I had the ""Reel Deal."" I selected the bluefish with charred scallion sauce, mushroom ragout, sweet potato fries and spiced carrots. This is a lot of food and I couldn't finish all the sides. The fish was cooked nicely and it was tender and juicy. My favorite side was the mushroom ragout - it was highly concentrated with mushroom flavor. It you like mushroom then you'll enjoy this side. The sweet potato fries are a crowd favorite - they're great for sharing.Solid seafood place - don't be put off by the fact that it's a ""chain."" 3.5 Stars!",2,,2
18,Torae B.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",432,60,142,4.0,1/25/2018,"First let me start off by saying that kale, sweet potato, avocado, apple salad is like the best salad I've ever had (all exaggeration included).I came on a slow afternoon which was nice for lunch alone or an intimate lunch with another person if you're into that kind of thing. I came for the restaurant week and was not disappointed. I didn't necessarily need the three courses but I couldn't resist. Also they paired their house wine for only $6. I love restaurants that don't only have fried fish tacos. And the winter berry crumble dessert was #awesome. Service did start to die down but I'm going to assume they were in the middle of a shift change? other than that everything was great.",,,
19,Tash B.,"Brooklyn, NY",176,156,62,2.0,5/10/2018,"I had some friends rave about this place and others who wanted to try it so I stopped by for lunch one weekday. I was underwhelmed and so were my friends.I ordered the lobster Alfredo which was more basic than expected. It came with literally no sauce and I had to send it back for more. Oh and for the price, it came with one lobster claw, not even cut up and mixed in. Without that, you pretty much paid for a bowl of pasta. My friends got a fish and veggie dish each that they described as BOTH too lemony and citrusy like everything had the same seasoning despite the fact that their orders consisted of different fish and veggies. One person even got two veggies and she felt everything tasted the same.It's a cute place with a beach town feel but the food is not impressive enough to go back.",,,
20,Bonnie G.,"New York, NY",127,476,780,5.0,7/9/2018,"Had such a relaxing happy hour here on a Monday. My girlfriend and I took one of the seats outside and drank two Reislings, a plate of tempura and six oysters for just $24 each with tip, since the happy hour boasts a $6 a drink special/ $6 for 6 oyster special. Would definitely come back here for this! Looking forward to trying their tacos next time.",3,,1
21,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,3/6/2018,"I'll be frank: I am not a seafood fan. Save for a tin of good tuna, some crab cakes, or the occasional scallop, I don't eat seafood of my own volition. I've moved past my ""EW! FISH! GROSS!"" phase of my childhood circa mid-1980s through the early aughts, but seafood has never been my preference, regardless, even as I've reached out to try different options.Well, Seamore's has enlightened me to how good seafood can be.I did attend a dinner here with members of JBF Greens, and I was lucky enough to sample many different dishes. To start, I had their buttery and perfectly-cooked scallop with avocado, pineapple, and coconut cream. Second, I sampled their lobster agnolotti with pork belly and a quail egg. Finally, I tucked into their fluke, wrapped in skate, served with mushrooms, swimming in an intoxicating beurre blanc. I can not say enough good things about these dishes. Though seafood, I did not get an overwhelming off-putting fishy flavor from any of them. They were cooked to perfection; the scallop wasn't chewy, just buttery. The fluke was flaky, though a few bones threw me off! The lobster agnolotti was luscious. OH, and can we talk about dessert? A small peanut butter and jelly cake, covered in chocolate, oozing with strawberry jelly, sitting on a fluffy bed of strawberry meringue, was one of the best desserts I've had in AGES.As I said, I'm not a seafood fan. But would I be willing to return to Seamore's to possibly continue my education on how delicious seafood can be when it's prepared wonderfully? I'm thinking...yes. I would like to be a student.",1,1,1
22,Courtney B.,"Hewlett, NY",72,5,0,5.0,8/17/2018,"Went into Seamore's yesterday for happy hour with a couple friends. The cocktails looked too interesting to simply just get a beer. I had the Madame Pelé and it was incredible. It was made with roasted pineapple juice, which gave it a really unique and delicious flavor. It was actually my first time there, and the decor was super cute, light, and fresh. Would definitely go again, especially to try the food. We had just eaten, or we would have ordered. I love seafood and the menu looked great. The staff was really friendly and attentive, never without water and right there when we needed another drink.",,,
23,Alisha R.,"Los Angeles, CA",151,54,13,4.0,7/1/2018,"We really enjoyed stopping here after checking out Fleet Week, while on vacation from California. My boyfriend got the lobster Mac & Cheese and I got the Lobster Roll. Both delicious! The Mac & Cheese did NOT disappoint. Sometimes you get cheese that doesn't melt down to a creamy consistency, or you just don't get enough cheese at all. Other times, you don't get enough lobster. This place really got the consistency, flavor and bite just right. It was served in a small cast-iron skillet. The lobster roll was also delicious! Again, not skimping at ALL with the lobster portion. Good flavor, although maybe just a tad too much mayo for me, but great bite with the crisp lettuce and buttered & grilled roll. We plan on coming back on our next trip to NYC. Tip: restroom is downstairs and is gender neutral, dorm-style",1,,
24,Michelle C.,"Philadelphia, PA",4089,1932,2462,5.0,7/3/2017,"I absolutely love when I find a restaurant in NYC that will be worthy of multiple visits. Seamore's came recommended by my colleague, and my friend and I both agreed that it was fantastic.Upon arriving, the restaurant was bustling around 7:15 on a Wednesday. I hopefully asked the hostess if she had any tables available and she said there was a wait. I said I wouldn't mind sitting at the bar and she told me to follow her, because she was just about to sit two people who were currently at the bar. Score! My friend and I were happy to take over the two bar seats at the far end of the bar. The bartender was busy but attentive nonetheless. I loved the house rosé. We started with the ahi tuna appetizer, which had large chunks of tuna. The fish was very lightly seasoned and the freshness of the tuna shined through. The blue corn chips provided just the right amount of salty crunch. We both went with the reel deal for our main course. You select from the fish of the day options, then you pick one of four sauces. The plate comes with three pre-selected sides. I inquired about the sides, which were rice, asparagus and beets on my visit. I cannot get on board with beets so I asked for a substitute and was told I could either double up on rice or asparagus, so I went with extra asparagus. Our plates arrived and looked absolutely delicious. I thought the amount of food was quite nice for $24. The red curry sauce I selected was served on the side (love that! thank you!) and it was super delicious with the scallops. It also had a kick which I really enjoyed. Everything on the plate was phenomenal and I couldn't have been happier with my healthy yet completely satisfying dinner. My only complaint is that the restaurant is extremely loud. I felt like I was shouting and straining to hear my friend and we were right next to each other. I think the ceilings were pretty high but maybe some more soundproofing could help. In any case, it's not going to stop me from returning, and I can't wait for my next visit!",15,1,7

February night?  Eat Happy Hour oysters, of course!  We ordered three dozen for a dollar a pop.  They were fresh and sweet, served on ice, with a decent mignonette sauce.  Happy Hour wine was fine, G and T was heavy on the T, to be expected.  Lovely, serene atmosphere - seated by the open window.  Great acoustics here - we could hear each other talk!  Server was friendly but got bogged down - took twenty minutes to catch her eye to order another drink.  Definitely a decent option in Chelsea for when you need oysters but don't feel like braving the crowd at Cull and Pistol in Chelsea Market.",,,

I cant compare Chelsea the original to, having never eaten in the Soho sibling. I was floored when I first saw the space, it's impressive.Ate: The Real Deal $26There's a mix of seafood and comfort classics here, but this fish plus veggies and grains and a sauce is the seafood equivalent of a meat and and three plus a sauce. On, Sunday, the space is packed, loud and the table is hardly cleaned. With my dish,  server serves some me orange sauce-NOPE, I want the charred scallion, if you would have asked. Well, the bluefish cooked to order with the veggies(asparagus & golden beets)was delish. The fish was super seasoned and though I didn't dig the black rice and asked for a sub which I didn't get, the food was high quality and a good value. Little soft serve cones are cute.

The staff was attentive and polite! I ordered the lobster roll with the kale side salad.  It was very light and fresh. I've never had a lobster roll with avocado on it, but anything with avocado gets a gold star from me - it was a nice touch. But let's talk about this $30 price tag... c'mon now. More than I'd want to pay for a lobster roll, for sure. I had some of my coworker's sweet potato fries and those were yummy. Get those. Today's dessert special was a coconut and pineapple soft serve swirl with the option of getting a shot of rum on top.... UMMMM, HELLO?! YES! Give me all of it.... Sadly, I didn't get it because I had to head back to the office (no drinking and working!) and didn't think the dessert would be complete without the rum.

If you don't like fish, there's still plenty here for you including the excellent ""F*** Jerry Fried Chicken Sandwich"" ($18, sweet potato fries included).Luckily they also do the OddFellows soft serve that they have Downtown, which is an always rotating and always good flavor (even if it is super pricey at $6 for a tiny cone).",10,7,11

Don't bother with the reel deal because while it seems like fish and three sides is a bargain, there really is no fish on the plate. I got the monk fish, there was 5 forkfuls. She got scallops. There were 4 of them and they were not big. While $1 oysters sounds nice, and they were fresh, they were dirty, with sand and shells in them.  I didn't feel comfortable biting down because there were constantly things in my mouth that weren't oysters. $70+ for 12 Dirty oysters and 10 bites of fish combined. The manager was friendly but the servers were absolutely not friendly either. No smiles. Barely came to the table. Will seek fish elsewhere.",1,,

We selected the mahi mahi (solid) along with the sweet potato fries (delicious), roasted broccoli (good), and mushroom ragout (may choose something else next time). While the meal was perfectly satisfying, it was the service that made me want to return. Our meal did take a little longer than expected to be served, but the waitress (and manager) were overly kind - offering us guac and chips to eat while we waited and topping the meal off with their vegan soft serve sourced from Odd Fellows.

The place was packed, but we were able to snag the last open table in the place.After perusing the menu for a bit, we both decided to go with the Reel Deal with Hake and shared the charred scallion and red curry sauces.The hake was cooked perfectly, but was a bit smaller of a piece than I was expecting. Nevertheless, the sides were pretty substantial, which made up for it. The curry sauce was really good, but was probably a bit strong of a flavor to have if you could only choose one. The scallion sauce was also very good and a little easier on the palette.Of the sides, my favorite was the escarole and beans, then the potatoes, and I didn't really care much for the eggplant caponata. Overall, this place serves up some interesting plates and has a wide variety of fish throughout the week. The atmosphere here was hopping and our service was friendly and attentive. A welcome addition to the neighborhood.",3,,1

Great for a casual dinner with friends, family, or a date. I enjoyed the reel deal. The bluefish is a nice balance between being meaty and flaky. Definitely a mild fish. The scallion sauce on the side added some more freshness along with the fresh squeeze of lemon. The three sides that I got were the roasted squash, Brussels sprouts, and the kale avocado salad. The squash and kale salad were great. I found the Brussels sprouts to be a bit salty for my taste. The restaurant was able to accommodate a party of eight and the staff was friendly.",,,1
36,Warren A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,50,80,5.0,6/21/2018,Great place for some seafood. They have a catch of the day type of menu so there is always something new to try. They place is really busy so it is recommended you make a reservation or you could wait around 30 minutes. Service was good. The meal did take some time to come out but it was worth the wait. Very good and very tasty. It is in the more expensive side so be prepared to spend a bunch.,,,

Service is great and the venue is super pretty. ConsThe food here is terrible. We ordered (1) guacamole to share, which was fine (2) blackened shrimp tacos - small with little flavor and (3) beer battered fish with fries. Everything tasted sweet or burnt, there was clearly no love put into cooking the food or creating the recipes. The tacos were the worst dish, overly sweet. It's such a disappointment when you take visitors to Ny to bad restaurants, at least we got to enjoy the sunshine.",,,
39,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,4.0,2/16/2018,"Whenever I would walk passed Seamore's Chelsea location, I would see a packed house.  However, the Yelp reviews seemed mixed, and I had never been that much of a fan of Michael Chernow's other space, The Meatball Shop, so I was not sure what all of the fuss was about.  However, this intrigued me into making a dinner reservation there when I was in the neighborhood one night.  My friend and I arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation, but the restaurant was so crowded that we were unable to be seated earlier than our pre-planned time.  Some of the tables were actually communal, and a spot at one of those happened to open up first.  Initially, we agreed to accept this offer, but we found our middle seats to be too impersonal.  The hostess and manager allowed us to vacate the communal table for a personal spot that subsequently opened against the windows, which wound up being much more comfortable.Both of us decided that we were going to decline alcoholic beverages, despite how creative they all sounded.  I did want to try something besides water, though, so I was thrilled to see that they had a Watermelon Agua Fresca.  It was revitalizing and a bit sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.  To start, we shared an order of Guacamole, which was a rather generous portion that was topped with diced tomatoes, pickled onion slices, and sprigs of cilantro.  The smashed avocado was perfectly seasoned and had a texture that was not overly chunky or watery.  It was served with a handful of Blue Corn Tortilla Chips that had the ideal kiss of salt.  Though it took a while for the guac to arrive, we plowed through it rather quickly.  In fact, we finished the chips, with some of the dip still left in the bowl.  The observant server walked by and instantly offered to bring additional chips, and we accepted the bowl, against our better judgement.  Ha!  For our entrees, we both selected The Reel Deal, a customizable plate consisting of our choice of daily market fish, sauce, and three sides.  We both selected the Winter Skate from New Bedford, MA and were thrilled at its simple preparation.  The skate wing was tender and was presented with a lightly browned exterior that had been sprinkled with a hint of salt.  We also both opted for the Miso Brown Butter as our sauce, but I was glad that it was served on the side, as I thought it tasted more like a sugary butter than an Asian miso.  My friend and I differed on our selected sides, but were both delighted by what we received.  The first of my three was the Roasted Winter Vegetables, which, on that evening, were chunks of rutabaga and ribbons of red beet.  My other sides were Roasted Brussels Sprouts and a Kale and Avocado Salad.  After reading rave recommendations for the salad, I knew that that had to be one of my choices, and I was glad that I had followed suit.  The leafy greens were tossed with walnuts, sweet potatoes, quinoa, and a honey-apple vinaigrette, and then garnished with raw avocado slices.  Each side was expertly prepared with ideal texture and seasoning, and the three together felt like a powerhouse of super foods.  I was able to indulge in the complete meal and walk away feeling healthy, rather than gross.From the service to the window-filled dining room to the flavorful and nutritious food, I really loved Seamore's and would definitely consider this one of my new go-to spots.  Give it a try!  And if it is the wait for a table that causes you to hesitate, just know that, in addition to their dining room bar, they have a full lounge called Fishbowl on the lower level.  Enjoy!",3,,2

Updated review","Had the best time with my friend here tonight. Decided to venture out in the rain after work and happy we did. We came in with no reservation even though my friend said it's impossible to get a table here. We each had some refreshing cocktails and poke bowl to start. I had the seared fish tacos and my friend had the real deal with haddock and some sides. Both were really good!!The service was great, from the host to the server. Even the manager stopped by our table (i never see that in NY) to make sure everything was great, I think he said his name was Kevin. We had such a great time with good food and great atmosphere. Whoever chooses the music here should get a raise! I'll be back for sure!!",1,,
41,Olivia S.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",1,36,3,5.0,7/5/2018,"Really liked this place... it's pricey, but that's seafood in Manhattan for ya . The ambiance is really bright and open and the service was impeccable. Really love the menu concept of choosing your fish, your sauce, and your sides. Between the table, we tried most of the sides and they were quite substantial. The cocktail menu is citrusy and refreshing (a perfect pair for seafood)....I would absolutely come here again (has usurped Cookshop as the best in the hood for the best post-work dinner with friends).",2,,
42,Nick S.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",1,40,65,2.0,7/30/2017,"The decor has a very inviting ambiance, a bit more so than the staff.We where asked if we have any food allergies but not explained allergic to what? Since we don't have allergies we dismissed the weird request. Until later that night when my wife broke out in hives! The fish burger was dry and fell apart even though it was covered in mayo. The sweet potato fries much more appealing than the burger itself.Crispy fish tacos were OK but I recommend chipotle sauce on the side as it was too spicy & over powered the other ingredients. Mac-N-Cheese was cheesy but not worth the $9 for it's size! Poké is made with tuna. The pieces were too big, I found myself chewing a bit, not a melt in your mouth texture Poké should have. The rice was old, dry & tasteless. It made it hard to enjoy the tuna flavors with the other ingredients in the bowl. Needed to add a spiced mayo on the side to bind the flavours together.Staff never asked if we are satisfied with the food but were repeatedly asked to remove our dishes as we were still eating. HOW RUDE!All and all the price point for the meal was less than desirable & the service followed suit.",3,1,
43,Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2265,1601,649,4.0,7/3/2017,"We were wandering Chelsea for a good place to have lunch and stumbled upon Seamore's. We were quickly shown to our table by our very friendly host. The restaurant is very clean and still smells new - no fish smell at all.We had:- Seared Fish Tacos with Porgy - Delicious! Perfect combo of fish, slaw and avocado.- Hamburger - 2 patties on a burger - very good- Mac n Cheese - Very good, loved the breadcrumbs The server was lovely (he was also the host). We will definitely come back. The fish was fresh and deliciously prepared.",8,2,4
44,Joey O.,"New York, NY",405,42,67,4.0,3/18/2018,"The staff here was great and very accommodating for hosting my big group for brunch. Trendy, great ambiance spot in Chelsea and would definitely come back. Can't wait for it to be warm again to enjoy sitting outside and sipping on some wine! One small feedback, the home fries that come with most plates, we're super salty. My whole party said the same thing. Hopefully management sees this and changes that up?",,,
45,Alicia C.,"Manhattan, NY",495,794,740,4.0,3/4/2018,"Very good spot! The happy hour is nice. The $1 oysters are a nice perk. The fish is very fresh and flavored really well. The Thai curry mussels are some of my fav. I really really enjoy the red curry broth. Oh my god it's spoon worthy. You just want t eat it like a soup at the end it's so yummy. Then the fish tacos were pretty sweet. I enjoyed the grilled ones very much. And the Mac and cheese was a surprise stunner. I loved the unique pasta shape, it was mezzi rigatoni and it held the cheese really well! Mmmmm. It was tasty! Overall a fantastic meal and I'll be back!",,,
46,Andrew G.,"New York, NY",1,6,0,3.0,7/30/2018,"The Reel Deal fish was fine, though the sides were far more satisfying. It would be nice if they had an option to add a couple more ounces of fish (4 oz seems even smaller after it's cooked), perhaps in exchange for getting two sides instead of three. The real disappointment, however, was the removal of the Riptide cocktail from the drinks menu. That pineapple tequila drink, which I enjoyed on a previous visit, was one of the best I've had in the city! The Madame Pele cocktail they replaced it with just doesn't compare. Please put the Riptide back on the menu so that I can come back.",,,
47,Tiffany W.,"New York, NY",248,294,177,4.0,7/2/2017,Came here after dinner at the restaurant on the street level. The bar is located underneath the restaurant and you enter by the stairs at the right side of the main entrance. It's a good place to hang out with 1 or 2 friends. The place is small so it starts to get crowded fast starting at 9pm.,2,1,2
48,Sybil S.,"Chappaqua, NY",1,77,12,5.0,2/20/2018,Terrific fun atmosphere & super healthy fish dishes. Incredible poke. Delicious veggie sides. Marvy tacos. Wonderful menu. Extremely friendly,,,
49,Aavody A.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",2,48,7,4.0,9/21/2018,"This place always has fresh seafood, always on point. I've come here more than 4x as a matter of fact with my bf and daughter and it's consistently been solid. If we're in the area and we're arguing where to eat , Seamore's will definitely be the end result of our restaurant argument. I will only give 4 stars tho because of our one experience with a server. My daughter is highly allergic to eggs and nuts and she wanted the Mac n cheese so just like any mother would do before ordering anything I asked if the Mac n cheese has eggs. Our server said she's not too sure if it has eggs but it probably does so I asked her if she can please ask the chef. After I said that she then said to me oh yeah ""i think"" it has no eggs. I was like ummm does it or does it not. She said nope it doesn't so do u guys wanna order the Mac n cheese? Umm noooo unless u ask someone in your kitchen we would not. The face on this girl turned soooo pissed , she turned her head to look back and rolled her eyes. Ummm miss server I can see you. So make long story short I did not order from her and called the manager instead.  Manager was very pleasant, he made sure we were taken care of and had a pleasant dinner. Oh and the Mac n cheese? It actually didn't have eggs. Allergies can be fatal. If u work in the restaurant business u should take this as a serious matter and being a server and doing what this server did was unacceptable.",,,
50,Carlie M.,"Cumming, GA",136,99,101,4.0,8/2/2018,"Great place for dinner! We stopped in one night and were seated right away on a week night. It looked like some people had to wait a bit as we were seated though. The service was a little slow, but the food was amazing! The blackened shrimp taco are amazing! The chipotle mayo and slaw are heavenly. The lobster Mac n cheese was so so delicious. I was afraid it would be way too rich but it wasn't overly so. I suggest splitting it though as we did.",,,
51,Advin I.,"Manhattan, NY",2,18,27,5.0,12/5/2017,"Love the decor inside, it feels cozy and clean. The staff and my server was very knowledgeable about the food, especially the fish. The food was delicious, it was presentable and they really got me with the beets, I ate them all ( I am not a beet person) but those were fantastic, the guacamole and chips were perfect but what really got me was the soft ice cream. That one is a must!",3,,
52,Lindsey E.,"Manhattan, NY",23,83,36,4.0,1/22/2018,"I liked this place! The food was good and the ambiance is a nice casual setting. My friend and I showed up at 7 on a Sunday night and waltzed right in too! We both got the Reel Deal which is their fish of the day and then you pick 3 sides. I picked a miso butter sauce which was delicious, and then the avocado salad, Mac n cheese and butternut squash. Would definitely come back here! My only complaint is that the food took a rly long time and I'm pretty sure the waitress forgot about us. She also wasn't too friendly either. Otherwise, this place would've been 5 stars.",,,
53,Maria G.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,22,1,3.0,2/4/2018,"Very friendly staff and great ambience, very considerate owner. And the cocktails were quite good!But I'd want to warn other people who might be seduced by the impressive wall of fish into thinking this is a serious fish place. It's not. The main fish dish is mostly vegetables with a bit of fish that was completely lackluster. No taste at all in the fish, and overcooked. So, I'd just want to set up people's expectations that this is more like an advanced poke joint than a good fish restaurant. It's just a better mindset to walk in with. And I don't know what they charged for the dessert, but also good to be forewarned that it was pretty much just a reheated, slightly stale blondie brownie with a dollop of cream and a mint leaf popped on to make it look dessert-y. But the staff was very solicitous and fun, and if you view it mostly as a nice place to hang out with some decent, healthy food, you'll have a great time.",,,
54,McKenzie A.,"Sycamore, GA",3,7,5,2.0,6/21/2018,"I've been to Seamore's multiple times and it was great, however this past time was absurd. We waited over an hour for our food only to get over salted and hardly any fish in The Reel Deal plate. Fish tacos were okay but took 35mins to come as an appetizer. Also the music was so loud we could not have a conversation or even understand what the server was saying. No lie it was louder than most bars around.",,,
55,Robert J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,7,0,5.0,5/28/2018,"I have been hearing lots of buzz regarding Seamore's so I popped in one night on my way home from work. Since I was alone I quickly grabbed a seat at the bar but there was a wait time for those wanting a table. I was promptly greeted by the bartender who proceeded to explain the menu and made suggestions. I went with the chips and guac and the fish tacos. Both came out in a timely matter and were delicious! I had the Montauk IPA which was very cold and was the perfect compliment to the tacos and guac. I also found out that they have a bar downstairs which I took a peak at before I left, it was small but busy. In short Seamore's is a great addition to the area. I will be back ASAP for a proper dinner and look forward to checking out its bar in the basement. Make sure you make a reservation to avoid long wait times and get the guac to start!",1,,
56,Christina P.,"Floral Park, NY",0,30,12,4.0,6/4/2017,"I went here with my boyfriend on Friday night, and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meal! We got there around 6:30pm, and only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. We ordered two different types of tacos so that we could try a few options. The crispy fish tacos were delicious. The fish were perfectly breaded, the guacamole on it gave it a nice flavor, and the radishes gave it a great crunch. We also got the shrimp short rib tacos, which were amazing. The portion was big, and the different flavor combinations of all the different ingredients made it very delicious. Definitely recommend those!My only complaint was the seating situation. They really cram people in there, and we were essentially put in a small corner, less than a half a foot away from another party, which happened to be very loud during our whole dinner. I understand a new location wants to be able to get in as many people as possible, but they should also keep in mind that parties don't want to be sitting on top of each other either.Overall, I would definitely go back to try more of the menu. The food was great, they have a nice drink menu, and the service was very quick, even though it was crowded for the Friday dinner rush.",,,1
57,Tyler L.,"Wanaque, NJ",195,1601,1308,4.0,10/16/2017,"If you're in the mood for some tasty seafood with a nice warm, sunny atmosphere to match, Seamore's might be the top spot in the city. The outdoor tables are great for enjoying the food outside when the sun's out. The brunch menu is an interesting melange of food choices where the normal menu items are incorporated into more breakfast-like options. The crab cakes were quite flavorful and tender, practically falling apart with a fork's touch. The fish tacos balanced spice and subtle flavor of the fish quite well and were perfectly sized for an early meal. Service was very fast and friendly, perfect for a day out with kids who started getting a bit testy.",2,,
58,Katie S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",385,1,0,1.0,10/30/2018,"This used to be one of my favorite ""go-to"" seafood restaurants in the area. The daily landing special was always great and the seasonal sides were amazing. That said, I honestly cannot go back to this restaurant given how horrendous the service has been on a consistent basis. The restaurant is not large and yet the waitresses and extremely inattentive - blatantly forgetful and almost rude. The food is amazing when it's right but I have sent food back twice for being cold and over cooked. My favorite part about this place used to be the daily landing (whatever fresh fish was caught that day) however on multiple occasions when I have called the restaurant to ask what the daily landing was the hostess didn't know (Hello!!! It's listed on the wall). Further, waitresses can't even tell you which is the most popular that day! You also used to be able to pick your three sides and now they have removed that option and included the three most basic sides (no options) because ""it's too hard with seamless"". That's insane - this is a nice restaurant in Chelsea with not a particularly low average price point! Lastly, the last time I was there we place our order and the manager informed us that they were out of lobster which is included in many of their dishes. The manager was polite and offered us another round of drinks which we declined because we were not drinking heavily on a Sunday. He didn't offer anything else and was no where to be seen the rest of the night. I wanted to get up and walk out but ordered a soup as to not be rude - the bill for two was over 90 dollars and we got nothing we wanted! Used to love this place but this was the last straw - won't be going back.",,,
59,Shuana Y.,"Queens, Queens, NY",59,12,6,4.0,1/21/2018,"We weren't that hungry but we just had to finish everything because it was that good. I got the reel deal with porgy and scallion sauce with sweet potato fries, Brussels sprouts and broccoli. I actually didn't expect to get so much bacon in the lobster Alfredo but that dish was just as tasty as the other. Both were delicious, service was good and I'm definitely coming back here!",,,
60,Charlie R.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,53,1,3.0,6/20/2018,"Good service and lovely decor. The food itself is nothing to write home about. The fish and sides weren't seasoned well and it tasted rather bland.

61,R L.,"Alexandria, VA",78,56,0,1.0,10/7/2017,"We came here despite the negative reviews because we like the Soho location so much. Big mistake. Our experience was pretty much like the other bad experiences listed here: service is non-existent. Sitting outside was clearly a bad choice because we were forgotten about most of the time. Every time we needed something, we had to go inside to find someone. Someone was opening the windows and we tried to get his attention so that we can just get the check and get outta this terrible place, but he looked at us and then turned around and walked off. The cherry on top was the fact that the food was not nearly as good as the Soho location. Blegh. Really sours our taste for the Seamore's name in general.Oh, and it was NOT busy at all and when my husband went to look for someone to request the check from, he saw 4 staff members just standing around the bar chatting.",2,,
62,Edisa R.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,2,0,2.0,6/9/2018,"Portions too small, bad service, good flavors: We ordered The Reel and were really disappointed by the amount of fish served - especially given the price. Also, the kale and avocado salad should be called the sweet potato salad, I didn't see a single kale leaf on my plate. It also took over 30 minutes to get our food which I'll assume was just a service mishap. The flavors were good, but other than that this was pretty disappointing.",,,
63,Angela M.,"New York, NY",67,8,2,2.0,1/14/2018,"Came here with a friend for brunch, it wasn't all that great. Not many dishes to choose from. Everything is based off Kale, Sweet Potato and Seafood. If you're not a seafood lover then sorry nothing really hear for you. Everyone really pushes the dishes on you, buy saying its healthy and you should get it just for that reason.Not to mention the presentation is great but it doesn't go passed that.

64,Mei Lyng L.,"New York, NY",136,2,0,1.0,8/14/2017,"1 star because the food was tasty but not anything you can't find elsewhere. Really wanted to give 0 stars but I'll be fair. Why 0 stars? This place is low key RACIST. I went twice in the last week. Once with my friend for lunch and another last night for an early dinner with my boyfriend. My girlfriend and I kept getting weird looks from the staff. Almost like, ""why are you guys here kinda looks."" Mind you, I was wearing Givenchy shoes and Saint Laurent sunnies and adorned in gold but that's all besides the point. The white staff should try hiding their looks of disgust by people of color coming into their establishment. It felt very awkward.Then I stupidly came back without thinking with my boyfriend who is dark skinned and he felt very uncomfortable and I felt terrible for coming back and not using my judgement. We both were not in the mood for any meat or poultry so I suggested Seamores when I should have gone to Macondo for great service. The only individuals who were pleasant and didn't look at us crazy last night were literally the only POC working there. The hostess and a young Jamaican-American gentleman.

It's close to the Joyce Theater and a little crosstown walk from the Rubin Museum. The reasons why I love it, the fish is fresh, the food is ""clean"" limited ingredients, flavorful, freshest ingredients, great prices for top quality ingredients.You MUST try their watermelon salad with the best vine ripened beefsteak tomatoes & thinly shaved jalapeño peppers. The flavors are a burst of fresh sweetness with a kick of hot spice!Kale salad is dressed perfectly with a lemony walnut dressing & roasted sweet potatoes.Scallops are a juicy & seared perfection.Crispy fish tacos, are deep fried & surprisingly not greasy at all, these 2 plated corn tacos have great crunch texture with fresh kale & creamy guacamole layered under the crispy fried flaky white pollack( a type of cod). End your meal with a refreshing Pineapple VEGAN soft served ice cream, a punch of ice cold pineapple, just an amazing summer meal.Tip: if you don't like noisy restaurants, they have sidewalk seating which is nice too.Don't miss Seamore's, it is an inexpensive, especially in terms of Manhattan dining. The crispy fish tacos are $15 & you get 2. I had that & a pineapple soft serve the other night & it was filling & delicious.",7,2,3

The scallops came with the same dressing and sides (though we had requested the curry sauce).With 1 drink per person, the bill was very reasonable around $90 before tip.Note: no oysters at this location.Music is pretty loud, so it is not the best restaurant for a romantic conversation.",1,,

It's more like carrot cake w bits of over cooked fish in it, the poached egg on top was hard and the hollandaise sauce desperately needed salt and pepper to make it slightly more inviting to eat, and the kale salad that went with it was tough and barely dressed.Yeah, for sure I won't be back for this low quality of food.",,,

We got lucky and snagged a table outside on a beautiful day with no wait. There was a long wait that formed just after. The food overall was tasty though a few dishes weren't great, the side of carrots and the coconut chowder. Neither worked well. However, the guacamole was nice. The fish tacos I liked a lot.

76,Patrick W.,"New York, NY",89,5,0,4.0,8/5/2017,"I was so excited when Seamore's opened a new location in Chelsea because it is within walking distance of my apartment. I had previously been to the other location near SoHo with coworkers and loved it. I went for lunch with a friend around 2 PM, and as soon as I walked in was thrilled with the atmosphere - it is so brightly lit and airy, and the staff was warm and friendly. We had a calamari (appetizer which was great), and my friend had the fried chicken sandwich (which he says was good, and a large portion - though i made fun of him for coming to a seafood place and ordering chicken!). I ordered the seared mahi tacos, which I will get to in a second. We finished up with a complimentary pineapple and coconut ice cream, which was SUPER refreshing and appreciated. All in all, I know I will be back several more times, if anything just for the vibe! A couple things that weren't the best though:1 - We felt a bit rushed. I think we sent a clear signal that we were having a relaxing lunch and wanted some time to work on our appetizer while we figured out what we wanted for entrees...our server checked in for our entrees before the appetizer arrived, 5 minutes after it arrived, and again a few minutes later. I would understand if there was a huge rush and a need to turn over the table, but lunch was clearly over and it was not busy. I'll chalk this up to just trying to be attentive, though.2 - My tacos weren't my favorite. I felt they were a bit underseasoned (i.e. in need of a little salt) considering all the ingredients that were present. Also, the corn tortillas were a bit hard, seeming like they could have been warmed a bit more first.",,,

Came here because they opened down the street from my favorite BnB in Montauk and while I did not go to that store, I still wanted to check the place out.I had fried calamari and the lobster roll. The food was fine although why they put avocado on a lobster roll is a complete mystery to me. Also, the 'micro-greens included cilantro which tastes like cold cream-tinged soap to me.Hint: New England lobster rolls are made with lobster salad because the mayonnaise holds the chunks of lobster meat together. This thing fell apart all over the place. I felt like a toddler with good all over the table and my shirt.Lobster roll recipe: chilled chunks of lobster meat and mayonnaise on a top-split roll. Nothing else. No avocado, no celery, no lettuce,  no micro greens. But the real issue with this place are the noise level (horrible) and the service ( god awful). The waitresses literally loll against the walls while you desperately try to catch their eye.

I love the original Nolita location so was stoked when they opened a location in my hood. It took a while to get a table so we got some wine in the cute downstairs speakeasy.  Once we were seated we ordered more wine and split the mac and cheese which was yummy.  Then I got the seared fish burrito which was good and came with a great kale salad.  One of my friends got the veggie version of this.  My last gf got the seared scallops special which looked delish.  All in all it was yummy dinner and I'll be back.  Tip make a res or come early.,1,,1

We were promptly seated, and our orders taken.For drinks, a Smoke on the Water, a Bloody Mary, a Riesling and a coffee. The cocktails were average, the candied ginger livening the Smoke. The glass of wine and coffee were more warmly received.Only one of our two apps appeared, a rather tasty bowl of poke, topped with cabbage instead of rice, blue tortilla chips on the side. A generous portion, but insufficient because the wait person forgot our ordered clam fritters. When we pointed this out, we got a mild apology, but maybe the fritters should still have come out, later, and been comped.Mon fils and I both had the fried avocado Benedict. This comprised eggs, panko crusted deep fried avocado halves and a sauce styled as harissa, but not as spicy. No bread. Is it me, or do you not expect English Muffin under your Benedict these days? The shrimp and scallops was a partial misnomer - one medium-small shrimp, and one perfect scallop. For $22 at brunch, not the best deal. The fish cake bennies, at $15, were a better value. I am guessing they were tasty, the feinschmecker didn't share. The egg dishes came with your choice of sweet potato home fries or salad, both portions being generous. If you're a couple, I suggest you order one of each and share. My carbo avoiding wife insisted on ordering a plain piece of fish and a side salad. The fish was a nicely grilled piece of sea robin- and came with a tiny price tag - ($7 or $8 I think.). Given that the benedicts were pain-less, she could have had one of those.The gracious maître d coming over at the end to check on us sealed the deal. I appreciate her interest. Overall this was a pleasant experience, and worth the price charged. Still, I am still jonesing for some clam fritters.",,,

I'm also a huge fan of the Meatball Shop, so I was excited to see their take on seafood.  The decor is bright and does smack of a seaside cafe.Unfortunately - the prices just didn't justify what I felt was pretty solid, but nothing special seafood.  The poke was too chunky for the chips it came with, and the portion was smaller than I expected. My fish taco was fine. Nothing bad, just nothing I would rave about.I'd recommend friends to go try it, or even enjoy a happy hour. I'll go again, just to see if my review holds a second time, or improves, but that would be it.Pros: Beer selection is greatCons: Pricey",,,

The general manager, Todd, stopped by to say hello. He was so nice as well. VERY knowledgeable about food and drink. We were beyond impressed.

There was a good reason why.First, the service. It took a good ten minutes for a waiter to come by the first time. And that was after they brought water to a couple next to us that I'm fairly sure came in AFTER us.We finally placed our order. After what seemed like forever, the food for the couple next to us came out. It looked exactly like our order, the blackened fish burger and the fish tacos. So maybe they were here first. Regardless, when our food came out, I got the fish cakes instead of the fish burger! So we had to send it back. It turned out that our waiter had put in the wrong order! I would have understood if he had mixed up our order with the table next to us but the wrong order? We were pressed for time as we were going to a show later. It came out soon enough but not before we had to intervene multiple times.The fish burger was pretty good. It had a mix of rice or something in it though. The tacos were decent. But overall, the fish burger and sweet potato fries were very salty. In fact, you could see so many of the salt particles on the fries.The terrible service here is not worth the decent food.

I've had friends rave of the place so I probably will go back... hoping this day was a complete fluke. Basically, the service was extremely spotty... we saw our waitress for the order and THAT WAS ALL.  We had to call her over for sparkling water, never was anything offered or poured for us.  I also had to ask for ice. When the order was taken, two burgers, there was no asking of the temperature or the toppings... I did not  know the burger had a massive ring of onions on it because it's not listed on the menu. The burger took about 35 minutes... maybe 40.  It came out after I flagged down a manager.  He was kind and apologetic. The burger was awful.  The cheese was sorta melted but sorta crusty like it was sitting under a heat lamp. The patty was crumbly and unseasoned. The bun was flaky. Upon finishing, I had to then ask the host for our check because the waitress wasn't paying mind to us. Unnoticed two other tables asked the same host for their checks. She dropped off the check, asked how everything was... I responded, ""it was just ok"". No response, took our cards, returned without a thank you, a goodbye, or a single word. Honestly... terrible experience.",1,,

94,Lisa W.,"Hoboken, NJ",140,210,0,3.0,5/28/2017,"I ate at Seamore's on their second night of business because I wanted something relatively healthier even though my father always warned us of going to restaurants when they just open because he doesn't believe they wash the dishes and linens first.  I actually agree with him but I'm not as persnickety about that.  I did notice a fine film of slight dust on my appetizer plate which reinforced that belief but I am not going to tell my dad that because then he'll be mad at me for eating at a restaurant on its second night of business but I digress.  Seamore's is a really cute space.  It's open and airy with communal tables and bright colors and flowers.  I felt like I was transported to a cute CA or seaside restaurant.  We ordered the poke, fish tacos, and reel deal.  The food in general was good and the place was charming but there were some missteps.  The poke was bland by itself; the rest of the seasonings were solid but it needed more salt.  If you ate it with a saltier homemade chip, the poke was more balanced but on its own, it was lacking and I have a palate that is generally sensitive to salt which means it really needed salt.  The fish taco was a tasty rendition of a classic fish taco.  The only unusual thing about one of the tacos was that it was cut off.  Almost as if a giant piece of fish was fried and then cut in half to be split up among two tacos but usually fish tacos are portioned more precisely.  The alternative would be that someone cut off or pulled off a piece of fish to eat a bite so I clearly prefer the former explanation.  The reel deal was actually my favorite dish and I highly recommend that.  We had the option of 3 daily fish (black sea bass, mahi mahi and sheepshead) and it came with asparagus, beets, and black rice.  The black rice and the fish with the miso butter were really tasty and the asparagus were quite meaty.  The beets were braised in red wine I believe so they didn't have the sweetness I initially anticipated but were fine.  Some reviews of the original Seamore's location talk about how the reel deal is so huge and it can easily serve two, etc.  These people must not eat a lot.  The reel deal is a perfect sized portion for one person.  There seemed to be some fluctuation in the size of the fish people were receiving though.  I did notice our tablemates received a slightly larger piece of fish than we did and then later on, as we were leaving, I saw a very tiny piece of fish being served.  Supply and demand I suppose.  We finished the meal with coconut and pink lemonade froyo which was refreshing.  There was a significant time lag between appetizer and main courses though for me and my friends.  So significant that the waitress even apologized that it was taking so long.  I wouldn't have minded an extra pour of Tito's with my watermelon agua fresca (it was delightful but I feel like there was hardly any liquor in there) to make up for the wait.  Obviously, some of the missteps could be related to first week working out the kinks except for this one thing.  The thing that has brought me out of my self-imposed Yelp retirement because it bothered me so much that I had to comment on it.  While I was waiting to use the restroom, a waiter/manager/not sure his position went up to a server and said ""sub out the mahi for the sheepshead; they won't know the difference"".  Ummm what?!  Excuse me?  That really felt inappropriate to me.  Sure, a lot of people won't know one tender, mild fish from the next but why not just tell them you're out of one fish and offer a recommended replacement versus subbing it out because you think a patron is too stupid to note the difference?  That kind of bait and switch (pun intended) didn't sit right with me.  I actually really did like the environment at Seamore's and the food in general and I appreciate trying to promote sustainable fish so I would return.  However, I had to go with three stars for that overheard comment because I felt it was unprofessional and inappropriate especially if you want to foster an environment that exposes customers to the beauty and flavors of different types of fish, you don't just sub things out without telling people.",7,7,3

103,Jordan H.,"Manhattan, NY",108,1,0,1.0,4/14/2018,"My fiancé dragged me to Seamore's with the belief it was one 6th ave. While walking from the West Village I made a $10 bet with her that it was really on 8th, a bet I wish I never made. Upon my victorious arrival to the 8th ave Chelsea location, we headed downstairs for a drink after leaving our name with the hostess. We were delighted to find two seats at the bar to enjoy our drinks as we watched the bartender finger the drinks in front of us. No, you read that right. Fumbling about the bar, the bartender accidentally poured drinks in the wrong glasses and proceeded to correct himself by using his finger to flick about the ice cubes till he found the proper appearance. After being seated at a communal table set for one too many seats, my fiancé and I quickly placed our order. As this was our first time, we had a few questions that our waitress just didn't want to answer. With the wood and metal heavy decor reverberating every possible noise, I could understand why our waitress may have wanted to keep conversation to a minimum. While ordering my fish I misunderstood that the meal came with three sides and not two. After telling the waitress she could surprise me with the third side she replied with ""this isn't that type of restaurant"". I'm sorry, but what type of restaurant did you think I was referring too? Stunned by the comeback, my fiancé finished the order as the waitress walked away, thus further setting the mood to this unfortunate execution of a restaurant. While wrongly being served other tables meals by the runners more times than I could  count, I just sat in awe over how many times people were switching their plates over being served the wrong dish. In short, as for the food, the guacamole topped with a delightful pickled red onion had some hard inedible pieces we had trouble to navigating, my fiancé's linguine with clams was good but nothing extraordinary, and my perfectly cooked monk fish was served over salty brussels, simple broccoli and olive oiled slicked rigatoni topped with melted cheddar shavings sold as Mac n cheese. As we ran out of the restaurant my fiancé handed me my winnings from our bet earlier and confessed she meant to take us to Seabird on 6th ave. I refused the winnings, and made an agreement to put it towards a better experience at another restaurant.",,,

105,Ursula K.,"Manhattan, NY",57,55,56,4.0,8/6/2017,"The atmosphere is casual and trendy but not too trendy. The Poke was awesome, with huge chunks of tuna, guacamole, sesame seeds, cabbage, and garnish (I want to say cilantro). We were stuck between choosing the poke or the guacamole and I'm so glad we chose the poke so that we could actually have both. Served on blue tortilla chips. All of the ingredients played so nicely together. The Special Lobster Roll was nice, a little mayonnaisey for me, but the taste was still good. I didn't taste a lot of butter on the bun, but if there was then it seemed to work with the mayonnaise. The Crispy fish taco was probably the best one we ever had, fried pollack with a very spicy but delicious sauce. I took off the radishes. Down the block I've referenced Cooper's, which also has terrific fish tacos , it is hard to decide which was better because Cooper's is a gastropub and Seamore's is more of a fish specialty house. Great portions for all of the food. For dessert we had the Rum Floater, which was Pineapple and coconut ice cream by oddfellows with Pina colada and RUM. For $10 it's a good buy.  As for the service, the food came up very quickly and they did not make any mistakes. However, after we got our food, they could have checked on us a little more (e.g.-asked if we wanted another soda) but all in all it's the type of restaurant where whatever you order, you will be very happy.

I had about 12 of my closest friends join me for dinner. Before the date even came to go, just the experience setting up the reservation was so easy and quick. We were given the option of prefixed meals and drink options. It's so smart to have everyone pay one price and have an amazing time without worrying who pays for what. They have plenty of food options for everyone to enjoy. From the moment we walked in we were all set up. They even had a personalized menu with my name on it (great attention to detail). It was a two hour limit and I felt as everything went so smoothly with the food timing and drinks. The servers were exceptional & the manager was on top of everything. So warm and friendly, and attentive. Especially with the restaurant being busy to begin with! The bartenders as well were very quick with serving our drinks, you can blatantly see they all work as a team. I also appreciated that I never felt rushed, even when it ended we weren't asked to leave or pushed out, some of my friends even stayed at the bar to enjoy some more delicious cocktails.

As he was bringing them to the table he had his fingers in the food picking something out of it and tossing it on the ground. The waitress was then inattentive the rest of the time. We asked for assistance from the manager, who was equally as disinterested in providing good service. After 30 minutes of waiting for our drinks, they returned to tell us they were out of what we ordered. All in all, worst service I have had at a restaurant in a long time. I certainly won't be back.",,,
110,Sheila B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,23,0,3.0,8/16/2017,"Fantastic food - great environment. Wait staff rides that knife edge of realizing they are there to ensure clients have a great time and also resenting them because they really moved to the city to act and/or could be updating their own social media. Management could more emphatically ensure clientele focus, i.e. ""When you are on shift, pay attention to your diners and that is it."" Service and wait staff can make or break you. People will put up with an occasional bad meal. They will not be ignored, snubbed, and spoken down to a second time. Horrible reservation process.",,,
111,Jerome C.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,3/11/2018,The main dish was not served with all of the ingredients as advertised on the menu - including the main protein. Despite a couple of follow-ups the restaurant did nothing to address that.,,,
112,K E.,"New York, NY",0,282,1,2.0,6/30/2017,"Really not great food. The fish tacos are terrible - just bland, tiny and a damn shame. Avocado fries - meh. Everything was just average and the icing on the cake was the terrible, awful mess of the Salad Nicoise. Are you ready for stiff, overcooked, disgusting canned tuna on top of a mediocre salad?!?Not into it.",,,
113,L B.,"Manhattan, NY",19,41,9,3.0,8/26/2017,"I randomly walked in on a Saturday. Hadn't spotted this place before, not familiar with their other branch and like to support a new local business. The avocado toast caught my eye so that's what I ordered and it was great. 2 utterly perfect poached eggs, just the right amount of avo on the bread, a delicious crunchy kale salad w sweet potato on the side (instead of sweet potatoes fries). Service was fine. It was 30% busy when I went in. I'd go again. I think a fish restaurant is a perfect addition to this n'hood and the decor and the bar area are beautiful.",,,
114,Jerry L.,"New York, NY",15,2,0,2.0,2/19/2018,Stopped in on a Sunday night around 7. Restaurant was kind of quiet which is normal for a Sunday I guess. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed and in a rush and was very short with her interactions. She seemed to get more rude as we asked questions about entrees. Food was mediocre at best.,,,
115,Michelle L.,"Manhattan, NY",4,38,6,4.0,7/4/2017,"I had never been to Seamore's before so my friend and I decided to try the Chelsea location for dinner this week. I was so pleased and will definitely come back. We each got the ""reel deal"" which comes with an option of fish picks, three sides and a sauce. I got the sea bass with beets, asparagus and dirty rice with charred scallion sauce. All of this was delicious and cost just a mere $24! The service was also very quick. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that there seemed to be some type of issue between the busboy and waitress as they were a bit snappy with each other and it was somewhat uncomfortable. Either way though, I will most definitely come back!!!",,,
116,Sam K.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,7,1,5.0,8/10/2017,Had the most awesome dinner here. Great sized shared plates. The poke and squid were perfect. The tacos were out of this world--Definitely get the steak and shrimp tacos!Mary Kate was a total sweetheart and made us feel very welcome and never in need of attention,,,
117,Valerie E.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,4,0,2.0,11/26/2017,I really wanted to love Seamore's. I am a fish taco connoisseur and was eager to try the seared and crispy tacos. The fish tacos were under seasoned and seriously underwhelming. Two stars for the nice decor and ambiance. Service was meh. I will not return.,,,
118,Brian P.,"San Diego, CA",0,5,0,5.0,6/24/2017,Loved this place. We got the poke to start and crispy fish tacos. The food was perfect and the service even better. Staff were funny and friendly.,,,

120,Gina D.,"Washington, DC",0,2,0,5.0,7/4/2017,"Excellent food and service. The curry mussels were perfectly spicy, and the sauce was so good that my friend and I asked for more bread (which was also excellent). Had two different tacos: fish and shrimp and brisket. Very healthy portion of filling on each. The service was spot on. Very attentive, didn't rush us. Waited until we were finished lapping up the curry sauce until they brought our tacos. A+",,,
121,Kelsey S.,"New York, NY",444,62,0,2.0,6/26/2017,"Bad experience. My sister had her birthday party here and the staff could not have been ruder to us. We asked another waiter for help and his reply was, ""unless I'm waiting you table I won't be helping"". Awful experience. The food was subpar. Definitely won't be visiting this location again.",,,
122,Dana M.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",234,2,0,2.0,8/7/2017,"Poor service, waitress was not very accommodating  to allergy concerns and recommended dishes she told us were not appetizing.

123,Mari P.,"Brooklyn, NY",64,16,0,5.0,8/14/2017,"I came here with my husband during Seamore's grand opening and had one of the most delicious Niçoise salads. Every element was fresh, full of flavor, and bite. The tuna had to have come out of the sea just hours before! The lemony herbed vinaigrette on the crispy romaine was so good I wanted to drink it. My generous side dishes included jumbo asparagus spears and roasted red and golden beets which were cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of seasoning. My husband had the fish tacos which he loved. The staff were super pleasant and catered to all our questions. We'll be back soon!",,,
124,Paul M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,1,4.0,8/29/2017,"Really good mid-afternoon stop.  Had great tacos and it wasn't too crowded (which I love). Menu is certainly limited, but it seems like they have their thing and do it well.  Very friendly staff, and they didn't make me feel uncomfortable about asking for a table for one (which many restaurants do).  I will definitely come back.",,,
125,Tim S.,"New York, NY",1,94,0,2.0,6/1/2017,"I live in the neighborhood and was intrigued by the opening of this new restaurant.  I wandered in on Thursday afternoon (June 1), looking for an 8:30pm reservation for a party of two.  I spoke with a hostess, who seemed to be very nice.  She told me that she could not offer me a reservation, but that I should have no problem getting a table at that time.  Since I had never been to the restaurant, I observed that there were a couple of large communal tables.  I immediately indicated to her that I would not want to sit at a communal table.  She assured me with a laugh and a giggle that getting a private table would be no problem.  I had my doubts, but against my better judgement, I decided to give it a whirl.  That being said, after decades of dining in Manhattan, I should have known better.....my bad, my bad.That same evening, I met my friend at the restaurant at 8:30pm, and he had already spoken with a hostess and put his name on a list for a table.  He was told that it would be a 45 minute wait.  Go figure.  I then asked him if he had indicated that we would want to sit at a private table, not a communal table, and he said that he had not.  We both went to speak to the hostess at that point, and what do you know, it was the same hostess that I had spoken to earlier in the day.  I let my friend handle the situation.  He proceeded to tell her that we would not want to sit at a communal table, but would prefer a private table.  She then proceeded to tell him that the wait would most likely be closer to an hour wait.  She looked beyond stressed and frazzled as she explained the situation.  I almost felt sorry for her, but not really.  At that point, I asked her if she remembered me, and she did not.  Sigh.  I reminded her of our earlier conversation, and when she realized who I was, she all but plotzed herself.  She had been caught in her bold face lie about being seated promptly.  She meekly apologized, but what good did that do me now.My friend and I went to a nearby bar to kill time, and roughly an hour later, we received a text that our table would be ready.  So, our 8:30pm dinner plans turned into 9:30pm dinner plans.  I had not signed up for this.Once at the restaurant, we were promptly seated at a table for two up front near the corner.  We ordered a few appetizers and a couple of tacos, all to share.  The food came relatively quickly.  Everything was relatively good, except for the avocado fritters, which were pretty tasteless.  However, once all of our food had been served and we were essentially finished, we realized that our seared fish tacos had not been delivered to our table.  We then brought this to the attention of our server, who seemed shocked that we had not recieved our tacos.  Isn't the servers job to ensure that our food gets to our table?  I mean what else do they do??  We noticed that this same dish had just been served to the two tables either side of us, both of which had been seated about 30+ minutes after us.  How does that happen?  Seriously.Our tacos finally made their way to our table, without as much as an apology from our server.  Nothing was done to make up for the sloppy service, which was no fault of our own.  At that point, we were pretty much over our dinner.On top of this, it should be noted that in order for our server to get to the corner table, she had to constantly knock into my chair to get to their table.  It was beyond annoying, but due to the poor layout of the restaurant, there was not much else that she could do.Additionally, I observed only one unisex toilet to accommodate the entire restaurant. Maybe there was another one, but I did not see it.  Yikes!!I could go on and on here, but as much as I was hoping to like this place, it was pretty much a FAIL.  I wish them luck, but from this one experience, I do not think that they have much of chance of success.You've All Been Warned!!",,2,1
126,Nicole R.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,11,2,5.0,6/1/2017,"I love this restaurant so much! It seriously feels like I stepped into a restaurant right off the beach. The cocktails are some of the best I've ever had. The food was fantastic and  left me feeling super satisfied without that sick feeling of being too full... The ENTIRE staff from the hosts to the servers to the bartenders to the owners themselves were SO friendly and personable, making us feel like we were a part of the family. I cannot say enough about this place, and they maintain sustainability, recycle, AND use paper straws which is a HUGE plus for me that really seals the deal. My friends and I will be back ! THANK YOU!",1,,
127,Jenna K.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,6/2/2017,"I had a lovely time at Seamore's! I was greeted warmly by the hostess and promptly seated with my party. We started with the poke appetizer which was recommended to us, and it didn't disappoint. We also enjoyed some scallops, fish tacos, and mac and cheese !! Our server (lola) was such a delight and answered all of our questions and gave some great recommendations. Awesome location, healthy, delicious food, yummy drinks, and excellent service! What more could you ask for? We will definitely be returning to Seamore's.",,,1

129,Deborah B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,3.0,8/12/2017,Shrimp and steak tacos had one small shrimp and a mass of overcooked stringy beef (?) topped with way too much mayo. Not my idea of a seafood dish and definitely not worth $17.,,,
130,Kimberly Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,2,3.0,7/16/2017,"Wonderful staff, Waiter was great. I ordered the fish cakes Bennie and calamari. The fish cakes contained a great deal of shredded carrots, not what I expected. Food was good but I wasn't impressed.",,,
131,John C.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,3.0,7/2/2017,Seamore's see less. Sadly did not live up to expectations. There really wasn't any fresh seafood on the menu. The fish sandwich was minced seafood! Big disappointment!,,,
132,Anum A.,"Hewlett, NY",1,44,16,4.0,6/12/2017,"Ordered the guacamole for appetizer and found that the guac was a bit salty and chips a bit stale. However, for my entree I ordered the fish burger, which was pretty good! It consisted of two different types of fish (not sure which ones), quinoa, avocado, and kale on the side. We went around 12pm on a Monday so the service was pretty quick and the inside wasn't too crowded. The ambiance is crisp and bright, its refreshing!",,,
133,H J.,"New York, NY",74,51,0,2.0,6/8/2017,"Let me start by saying that I definitely see the potential in this restaurant. Service: The service was terrible. We sat outside yesterday (Wednesday) at around 6:45. It took 20 minutes for our server to bring water and order drinks. when our server brought us our drinks she identified the wrong wines and when we said that is not what we ordered she said that she made a mistake and the order was correct.  It took another 10 minutes to order the food. After we put in our order our waitress came back and said she forgot the order and repeated it to us all wrong. So we had to reorder- seriously? Just write my order down- no need to memorize.  It took another 40 minutes for the food to appear. We each ordered the grilled fish one Mahi Mahi and one Hake. I wondered where the other half of my fish was and both pieces looked as though they were already partially eaten and were less than 3 oz. The worst part was that they switched mine and my friend's order and we ended up eating the wrong fish.  When we told the waitress she could care less. My friend specifically ordered the Hake because she was pregnant and the mercury count is lower than the Mahi Mahi.   I wanted to order another glass of wine which I told the bus boy who said he would send over our waitress who of course never came. We ended up asking for the check which took another 15 minutes. The food: The calamari was great.  The food was very good, but the portion size of fish is offensive. As I said above, it looked like each of our fish dishes were partially eaten. The sides were the best part.",,,
134,Alex B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,2.0,5/27/2017,We both had real deal and the entrees feel like cafeteria food only that our bill with one appetizer (over sousauced and sesame oiled poke bowl) and 2 drinks was almost $100,,,
135,Kari P.,"Garwood, NJ",0,4,0,5.0,6/2/2017,I love this place! The vibe is great and food incredible. The poke is a must and the fish is cooked to perfection!,,,
136,Dan P.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,4.0,5/27/2017,"I dined with 3 friends last night and overall really enjoyed the experience.  3 of us ordered the Reel Deal, consisting of perfectly grilled tile fish accompanied by fresh beets, asparagus and grains, and my choice of red curry sauce on the side was a nice dipping option,  I liked how it was all thrown together in a bowl  reinforcing the restaurants fun non -pretentious vibe.  The 4th devoured the Nicoise salad - he raved.  Desserts were ok at best , the mini ice cream cone for $5 was presented on a whimsical serving box which we were told the owner made.  The $15  overpriced and melted profiterole I could have done without.  The staff is still getting their sea legs, a  mix on our table being inside instead of outside and forgotten coffees can be  overlooked by the newness and super friendly demeanors of hosts and server.  These guys seem to have a winning formula- this is a welcome addition to the ever changing storefronts of 8th ave in Chelsea we call home.",2,,
