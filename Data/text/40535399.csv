1,Julianne B.,"Dumbo, NY",212,173,418,4.0,1/13/2017,"Popped into this little place for an impromptu happy hour drink with my sister. It was absolutely perfect for a midweek rondevu . They had a nice selection of tap beers, wines and cocktails. Beer & the house wine were the only happy hour items. However, when my sister and I asked if the prosecco was on the happy hour menu, the bartender said, ""No, but that's okay, do you want to try it?""The bartender made friendly conversation, relating to us in a way that made me feel as though I was in Chicago rather than NY where few people interact with people they don't know. Low key but on point music selection, matched the mood and the crowd. aWe arrived around 6pm to a fairly empty bar, but left around 7:15 to a nearly full house.",1,,
2,April B.,"New York, NY",10,34,1,1.0,1/27/2018,Dope bar. But you are invisible as a black woman to Bartenders. It's been 25 minutes so far and as an experiment I watched every WHITE person get served but me. Guess they think cuz they play hip hop they're woke. Im out  taking my black dollars elsewhere.,6,1,

One of them pushing my boyfriend down onto the ground (that was covered in glass) for being in his way. It was his birthday; and he was minding his business, dancing with his friend. Alberto pushed him onto the floor and further threateningly advanced him for absolutely no reason. The dance floor was very crowded and some nudging is expected, but not this kind of violent behavior. He has been celebrating his birthday there for 3 consecutive years, and always has 30+ people. NEVER AGAIN will we step foot into this place.",1,,

We chose to leave and I probably won't be coming back anymore.",1,,

10,Scott S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,8,5.0,1/8/2018,"Monday and Tuesday nights are truly wonderful at this bar. Walk in from Bleecker Street (@Bowery) and you are immersed in a realm of eclectic music (courtesy of Caitlin, who also minds the bar). It's never crazy busy on these nights, so I usually pick up a sandwich at nearby Bite (at Lafayette) and cozy up with a draft to enjoy the tunes, which might include Glen Campbell, Nick Cave, or Shirley Bassey.

I do not recall what the crowd was like upstairs but downstairs was mostly people in their 20s. The space is really small and it gets really packed.Music: Mostly hip hop (old and new school) but they throw a some reggae here and there. They even played one salsa, and yes, you know I was on the dance floor for sure! Service and price: No cover; The bouncers were ok. Drinks are expensive $13 a popThis place is chill but I would rather go to bOb because the music is better and the crowd is more diverse.",4,1,1

17,Wei Wei Z.,"Tampa, FL",1,2,0,1.0,2/13/2016,"Smelly, dirty, verbally abuse bouncers. Generally not a good time...  I was there with a group for my friend's birthday.  One of the bouncers Mike miraz?, apparently a manager, kicked me out of the bar because I politely asked him to not call me ""sweetie"".  I think my exact words were ""sir, I would prefer it if you didn't call me that because it's a bit condescending"". Not only did he not apologize to acknowledge my statement, he repeatedly called me sweetie on purpose several more times after that just to instigate the situation, then finally, as I was walking away, he was obviously not done with the conversation so he pulled me back by my jacket hood, which choked me bc it was zipped up tight.  He also did it so hard that now a chunk of fur on the collar is missing.  Although this type of demeaning behavior may be typical of bouncers, especially at dodgy places, it is hardly acceptable... I probably would have brushed off his rude comments in my college days but now I'm older(over 30) and a bit more accomplished.  I think perhaps I just have a lower tolerance for this type of behavior.  I have the good fortune of being treated like a professional at work and respected equal in my personal life so I'm just not accustom to harassment like this.  Hopefully others have a better experience when they go.",14,,

There were two cocktails and a few glasses of wine on the docket. I went for two glasses of The Bleecker, a delicate mix of gin, Prosecco,and rose water-infused syrup with a lemon twist. (The first one was on Ruggy...thanks, man!) Gin and Prosecco? A dangerous mix for this lightweight, but as a (at the time) stressed out grad student at her wits end, I happily imbibed and let the alcohol do its job. Ha!The staff was friendly. I heard a few people complain about the tall blonde female bartender. Ummmm...unless she had an evil doppelgänger, I am not seeing what others were seeing. She may have been a bit frazzled, yes, but each of my interactions with her were quite pleasant. She made my drinks quickly and effectively. I tipped her based on the original price of the drinks. I thanked her each time I got a drink and see seemed genuinely happy for that. (It's usual bar courtesy, I feel...) My boyfriend even got a free shot of Jameson from her! So...I'm not quite sure what else to say in that regard, but I am Team Tall Blonde Female Bartender! (I'll defend your honor! It's Girl Code...)I'd love to come back, certainly. Looks like a cute date place or a place to catch up with a few friends, glasses of red wine in hand.",1,3,1
19,Priti R.,"New York, NY",320,405,57,1.0,10/5/2014,"This place sucks. Went on a Saturday night. Typical Saturday night crowd, busy of course, no big deal. Line to get downstairs to the dance area (which is filled with grinding and whatnot). What makes me give this place one star is the service. Some of the worst, rudest people. Not only are the bouncers pushy, and rude, the bartender was a b*tch. Tall blonde girl, I think. I say this because of course, cash only under $20, and I got a $7 drink. I pay with a dollar bill, and a five, and 4 quarters (this is literally all I had). I kindly ask the gentleman standing next to me if I could have a dollar, ""cause I would hate to leave without tipping"", he says ""of course!"" And starts to hand me the dollar when the bartender throws the quarters back at me. The man and I exchange looks and he goes ""you know what? Watching her... She kinda sucks."" My thoughts exactly. Thanks for the $1 off on my beer, bartender. Pro-tip for other yelpers if you want to save money, and save yourself the trouble from this average Manhattan bar.",5,7,
20,Trish R.,"London, United Kingdom",29,15,7,4.0,12/13/2015,"This place is a gem on Bleecker street! I've lived in the neighborhood for a year and so glad I stumbled upon it - what a great find. Cocktails are great to start out, I was also drinking a prosecco recommended by the bartender which was very nice. The basement is a lot of fun. There was a lot of throwback hip hop music which was awesome. Not typical or mainstream. The people were all fun and the staff was friendly. It was a bit empty when we were there but it was very early for dancing. Definitely coming back here. All in all, great place, and great vibes!",2,,2

I like...+ Someone who can put their hair down and relax.+ Someone who can stop a room when the occasion calls for it.+ Someone with a great taste in music.+ Someone with an artistic eye and good taste in design.+ Someone with an appreciation for tactful body art.+ Someone who can mix a mean cocktail. + Someone with a fun variety of friends. + Someone who can party... but can also act their age.In short, all of these characteristics also exist in one of my new favorite destinations for weekend revelry, Von. I'd like to say I'm dating her, but we're still getting to know each other. But upon our first blind date, I'm fully planning on giving her a floral pass to our second encounter at the next Rose Ceremony. Let's hope she accepts!",22,21,14

We got here around 11pm and immediately went down to the basement where 90's hip-hop and R&B were bumping. The space downstairs is dark. The bar area in the basement can get crowded but the area around the bar has space to dance and hang out with your friends. Staff was good and drink prices weren't ridiculous. Would recommend.",1,,
24,Guillermo M.,"New York, NY",3,17,1,4.0,12/7/2015,"Best place for a dance party - DJ is pretty on point most of the time (good mix of everything, new, 90's hip hop, R&B).

Wait, I retract that statement. I do like dancing until the sun comes up, but not in this kind of setting. The place does have an interesting layout, that I can say honestly. There is a downstairs area which is cozy and snug, but just way too many people on a Friday night. When you start seeing bottles of champagne, you know someone is having a party and their whole posse is in tow. Oh man, be prepared for an evening of expensive drinks, top 40s jams, and shouting. I am sure this place would be OK on a weeknight, so I am wiling to come back and give it another try. But for now, definitely not coming back on a weekend.",4,6,3
26,P S.,"Oakland, CA",8,49,4,5.0,6/24/2015,"Best experience dancing in NYC on a Friday night ever! Packed crowd but not unmanageably so. Friendly, prompt bartenders who even replaced my drink without any attitude when he misheard my beer order.Amazing mix of 90's hip-hop by a DJ who obviously knows his stuff, without any train wreck mash ups.

Great place to dance with a group of friends, maybe even be able to sit down for a little, without having to buy a table.Drinks are pricy but I guess nowhere can be completely innocent of New York annoyingness.

Had a drink called the Mission Cocktail and it was pretty damn good. This drink had a speakeasy vibe to it. I stuck with a few of these for the night. Getting a free Yelp Drinks Week pint glass was a bonus! Thanks Ruggy!I can see this place being  a good spot to bring a date. Dimly lit and kind of sexy looking. Small but decent beer list with a pretty large and diverse wine list. A bit cramped by the bar area when the happy hour crowd arrived, but there is a chill room to the side to hang in, and even a downstairs area. It's not a rowdy loud place, but more of a comfy intimate setting with a vintage decor to it.I also noticed that the female blonde bartender on last night needed to chill out. She was kinda mean. Would have been nice if she cracked a smile or two. She scared me.",10,7,7

As you explore more.. you'll notice an area around the corner which double the size of this place. They offered a choice of 3 cocktails for YDW. The one i had was called The Mission which was whiskey based and absolutely delicious. Now, why 1 star you say?Seeing as how this place wasn't that crowded, the lady bartender that night seemed a bit in a foul mood for whatever reason. Even as to go as far as to tell another patron that she can "" hold on, i'll get to you"" or "" you know that price doesn't include tip right""? is out right rude and disrespectful. If you're in the service industry, you make most of your money off tips and seeing as how you acted last nice.. i wouldn't be surprised if you didn't make much at all.  Watching you storm to the backdoor then pound and kick it to get your other worker out was quite pleasant to watch as well. Hulk Smash!!!The place is decent but when i order a jack & coke and you fill the cup up with about 85 percent coke and less then a 1 count of jack for 9 bucks is when i draw the line. I will not be returning.",7,4,4

Until I looked around and realized that everyone was extremely young. Presumably from Stern Business School, or so I was told. Anyhow beer spilling, pushing, yelling a girl hurling in the bathroom not really my scene anymore. There was  a space off to the side near an exit so we decided to just hang there and grab some drinks. The music was actually really good. A blend of the 90's to early 2,000's  which is interesting considering the clientele here is  just touching the age of  21. If your lucky enough to score a seat downstairs  it wouldn't be bad to remain stationary and enjoy the music!",1,2,2
31,Adam J.,"New York, NY",19,13,0,1.0,4/17/2013,"The bartenders are a bunch of C&¥%TS.They've mastered the art of noticing you, then deciding when and if they will serve you. And if you do manage to get a drink, before you die of dehydration, just take their obnoxious snarl with a smile, or else you'll NEVER get another one. It's basically the DMV, with a longer waiting time.",1,4,1
32,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,4.0,12/17/2012,"This is one of those places I've passed a million times and never went in because it's not on any of my usual itineraries, and it doesn't have a name posted out front, so in my mind it remained one of those anonymous storefronts. Until a group of friends, some of whom mix in circles unknown, decided to stop in.So, actually, Von is pretty cool. No pretentious admission policies (perhaps because we were with ladies). Not a trendoid place I would have assumed by the nameless storefront appearance. A few decent beers on tap, not too crazy crowded up front, and there's a nice alcove around the corner where you and your friends can hang out. The crowd appeared to be generally attractive, if you care about that sort of thing.I didn't hit the dance floor (alarming sign of getting old), but there were some groovy hip hop tunes on the gramophone, so jigging was in full swing downstairs. I understand the dance floor gets pretty crowded.",3,3,2

It's a big dark inside, but it's much bigger than you first expect with the room on the other side. Decent beer list, and a great cider that I can't recall the name of. I think Von is great for bouncing around the neighborhood, but I could see why people might be inclined to stick around. I haven't been to the basement yet, so I can't offer anything on that. Not too shabby, I'm near certain this place can end up being a common spot to consider when hanging out in the area.",1,2,1

The upstairs is great for just lounging and relaxing at the bar enjoying a drink or two (it's even good on weekdays). On weekends you will always find me downstairs!!! The DJ is always on point. And the downstairs itself just makes you feel like you are in New York City. The DJ plays a lot of hip hop/rap, which I'm not even into, but he plays the BEST. I'm telling you- if I will dance at this place, then anyone will dance at Von. Also the bartenders are great. After only 3 times going there they remembered me!",3,1,2

When I asked about the 50% off they said, ""Oh, you didn't mention that you wanted to use the special."" Why would I NOT want 50%? The atmosphere is dim and cozy, but it was freezing inside.

I was just quoting a hip-hop classic to give an example of what can be heard in Von's downstairs. It was nice to grab a beer and chill out with some nice music. I've gotta say though, this place is too busy for me. I got to relax a bit because I was fortunate enough to reach a table, but if not? Lots of bumper to bumper traffic.I've never been big on crowds, and that might be a funny thing to hear from a native New Yorker, but I really don't like crowds. I understand places get crowded, but unless it's the subway....hell, even if it's the subway, I like to at least have a couple feet of personal space. I never got that when I went to Von, and that just didn't make me comfortable to do anything. Will my drink survive the trip from the bar to the table? How many drinks will end up on my shoes? I probably sound like a curmudgeon, but if you're fine with the shoulder-to-shoulder thing, give Von a look. The crowd that was in there seemed really pleasant and I think the more extroverted folks out there will really appreciate how everyone wants to have a good time. For me, I just needed a break after a while.",8,7,3

I've visited Von earlier in the summer and have had a few of their wines during happy hour and all I can say is I will return, esp for $5 glasses.I think Von also let's you bring your drink to Bianca when you are called for dinner. The owner at Bianca seems to have a very good relationship with Von and brings back glasses once the drinks are done.This place is good for meeting with one or two people. I think a group can be a bit much especially if it's busy. There's a space in the back next to the bar and then the bar area--so decent sized place but not enormous.

When they say pet-friendly, they mean it, my 8 lb mini sausage dog wandered around the entire afternoon and said hi to all the patrons.Seriously though, the bar is a cool spot. Very low key, dim light, enjoy a beer kinda place. Nothing overly done or pretentious, just a chill bar with a cool vibe.

First time I was here it was for a helper's bday bonanza on a Saturday. Entering Vons one will notice its wide assortment of wines, wooden distressed floors, and lopsided rustic feel, reminiscent of my apartment (wink). Your cheek to cheek with every foreign transplant NYC has to offer, don't think just a bunch of Jersey folks posing. The candlelit area makes for a homey feel. Word to the wise, if you're not an extrovert then WTF are you doing here? Actually, we need our introverts. Ha, their usually the hottest person their holding the wall up.  After your walk through the trendy gauntlet of fashion model wannabes, head downstairs. Sometimes there is a bouncer, sometimes there is not. As a matter of fact, there was a line for me to get in. V's has an identity crisis. It is hot as balls down there. It isn't your regular dance hall basement. It's the shoulder shaking crew in here with a strange beer in hand.  The retro tunes that will keep you moving your hips all night long.  They played obscure Fugees music. It had me smiling. I don't think the birthday boy enjoyed it though, he wasn't smiling. Anyway did I mention I had fun? I like it here.",2,5,

There's no line to get in - you show your ID and you're in.When you first walk in, the place looks like a regular divey-ish East Village bar. It has 3 main sections - the initial entrance/bar area, the side room with tables and the downstairs dance area/bar. The dance area isn't big but it can accommodate a fairly large group of people - somewhere between 50-80. On both nights, the DJ played late 90's to late 2000's top-40's hip-hop music.On Friday, the place wasn't too crowded, you could move around and get a drink fairly easily. But on Saturday, the place was packed and I couldn't move from one end of the bar to the other.Drinks here are reasonable. $6 for Bud and Tecate cans and $8 for craft beer.

Ultimately, they're reasonable prices/good selection of whiskey did not mesh well with the PBR double-fisting, at least in a metaphorical sense. Let's just say the candle inside me began to grow into a flame. So I left, highly annoyed and frustrated with ""those people"".Flash forward a few months and I'm back for a friends birthday party. Timid as all get out at first, I quickly warmed up to the place. It was extremely crowded, but everyone was just having a great time. The only douche scenario I encountered was some unwanted dancer getting shunned by a group of girls - hilarious. We tucked our group in a corner downstairs, between the dance floor and the DJ (song title?). I was most impressed by the use of space, and the way their sound system was set up (we could actually HAVE CONVERSATION AT A BAR, say WHAT!?)Overall, the convivialities were a success, I was chipper drunk from good, cheap bourbon and my girlfriend had some fun mix drinks and an all around great time.

Updated review","I'm a huge fan of Von--had birthday drinks here, and it was the perfect middle ground between chill, low key bar and dance-if-you-want bar. We got here a bit early and they were playing a ton of reggae/Bob Marley, which later transitioned more into upbeat dance music as the night went on. Never felt so crowded it got uncomfortable (I think I was over that feeling of being squished between some skanky girl wearing pleather and some obnoxious drunk guy about...ALWAYS. ago.)It reminds me of what Arlo & Esme was (before they suddenly closed!), I think it's my new go-to spot.",,,

70,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,4.0,12/29/2012,"Von provided a great space for a relaxing, intimate happy hour with colleagues.  My four-star review comes from the casual and vintage atmosphere that drew us in.  However, the rude and unhelpful bartenders really dampened the experience.  Once we got past their nasty attitudes, we were thrilled to see that they had a great happy hour deal that consisted of $5 house wines, sangria, and some beers.  Both the wines and the brews included in the discount were from the local region and were fairly decent.  The bar's main wine list, however, was very lengthy and intriguing.  In terms of the seating options, the main section of the bar has several comfortable lounge choices, but they fill up very quickly, leaving only some bar stools or a counter to lean against.  Also, if you want to receive service, you have to walk over to the bar and fight for the bartender's attention, as there is no wait staff.  I had also heard that there was a downstairs bar that got packed on weekends, but I had yet to check that out.Von definitely had its pluses and minuses, but the good outweighed the bad.  There were also few casual lounges in this area, so that made it even more appealing.",1,1,1

The dj in the lounge had a great selection but it was a total waste since there was no room to move. My guess is this was probably a chill spot to drink AND dance with a cool crowd.

And one of us wanted to sit down for a few min, a girl pushed and said we can't sit, even temporarily. Then her friend came over to ask what's happening try to bully around. Gosh, what's going on with this place? Suppose the patrons make the place. I'd say this place is going downhill. Not like a couple of years ago. Time for a new dig.",2,1,

But... that's kinda what you sign up for an a bar in this area!Dimly lit, and dancing. Depends on the crowd each night. I've been there where it's chill, and the crowd is late 20's early 30's. I've also been there when it feels like someone is throwing a 21st bday and don't know how to act like an adult. Point being, stop by. You might like it :)",,,

This is a great place, no matter what size your group is.  This place doesn't have any fancy cocktails and has no frills to it.  It's the kind of place you go to if your choice of liquor is a good glass of strong whiskey or beer.Upstairs, the place is a very casual bar.  Downstairs, the place becomes one of the best places to dance to.  On Thursdays, they play hip hop and R&B.  The first time I came hear, I walked downstairs and Michael Jackson's ""I Wanna Rock with You"" was blasting.  It was then followed by Too Short's ""Blow The Whistle.""  And then old school Roots.  I don't think life gets better than that.There's never a line.  And the owner Charlie is really cool.  Once he's seen you a few times, he'll treat you and your friends very kindly.  And by kindly, I mean he'll make sure you are both drunk and can still afford that trip to Bergdorf you were planning on taking the next day.",5,1,1

Maybe if your date is gross and unattractive and you aren't too concerned about a second date. Otherwise I would suggest a more tasteful and similarly casual route at nearby Tom and Jerry's.

Von can get soo packed that you're next morning subway commute might feel like your alone in a field.  Von bar is one of those strange spots where hipsters and yuppies collide.  Located in the gentrified bowery district, it attracts a mixed crowd somewhere between CBGBs and J. Crew.  It also attracts a lot of beautiful fashionista women.   So guys remember to keep full eye contact with you date, otherwise she might go home with the guy at the end of the bar who looks likes Rick Santorum wearing a Ramones T-shirt.    Depending on your mood the upstairs and downstairs offer totally different vibes.  If you're looking for a casual classy drink, stay upstairs and order a specialty drink with one massive ice cube.  If you're in the dance like you just don't give a f&%$ mood, then downstairs is the ticket.My only real complaint about this place, besides being a tight squeeze, is that a few of the bartenders were very cold to me. After the first time i'd let it go, but upon coming back and being a regular, i still receive the same ""fuck you, what do you want from me, I'm too cool to serve you"" attitude from the blond hair female bartender who works upstairs.  Whatever happened to service with a smile?",3,4,
107,Jonathan C.,"New York, NY",39,27,1,3.0,12/14/2012,"This small quaint & cozy bar located near Bowery is a place to have a nice drink with a friend, or someone more.  There isn't that many places to sit, probably 10 on the bar, 4 - 5 small tables and a couch (near the fron window), but the music is classic.The People:The people are pretty casual, down-to-earth, and hipster-like.  You may get a few stragglers, but that's because some people like myself come to wait for a seat at the next door restaurant, Bianca.  The Music:The music was very mellow, jazzy/classic (now that i think about it, I can't recall).  But overall very soft music for a bar, which makes it great for having a conversation.The Drinks:The drinks weren't too bad.  They have a good selection of wines and not so much beer.Overall, a nice place to relax after a long day of whatever that you may have done.  It's not a crazy bar, bar (but then again never went there too late, or been to these so-called other floors).",,,
108,Lex N.,"New York, NY",4,21,0,5.0,2/13/2012,"This is the place where nights turn into mornings. Well, not mornings, but you know, 4 AM. Close enough.Not being a club, this is a great place to go for either a) a few casual drinks with friends, b) dancing with friends, or c) all of the above. The upstairs space is for the cool kids who like to sit and knock back beverages like it's nobody's business. The downstairs space is home to a small dancefloor surrounded by a few tables. It's not a big space, but it gets awfully fun. Having had the pleasure of spending a handful of nights here, the music has never disappointed me and neither has the crowd. The balance between contemporary, hip hop, oldies, and electro is just right, catering to the weathered, multifaceted listener. Don't go there too early or too late. Too early - empty and boring. Too late - a queue to get downstairs is formed; the basement has an intimate capacity. Drinks are good; how could they not be? Nothing complicated.Also, these guys are very thorough about ID's, which is absolutely wonderful. Never will an NYU freshie ruin your time by projectile vomiting. Not at Von. Cheers!",1,,

I think it was for capacity reasons over exclusivity. The upper floor is just a bar and some limited seating and it was super crowded. At the end of the bar there's a set of stairs to go down to the lounge area. The only thing that sucks is that you have to wait in line again to go down there. Once again, the line moves pretty fast so no worries. The music and vibe downstairs is great. Just loud enough to be danceable, but not not too loud to carry a conversation.

A nightcap, if you will, in not just cocktail, but in that warm hug at the end of the evening feeling and I definitely found it at Von.From the second I walked in, I knew I was gonna love this place. My boss assumed it was because the place was crawling with hot men...hey, I ain't gonna lie, that didn't hurt the visual appeal...but it went far beyond that and just has a vibe to it that is so comforting and you instantly feel like you belong there. At least I did.When I mossied on up to the bar I received a nice smile from a gentleman sitting there and we started chatting. Couldn't have been a nicer chap. I'm guessing he hangs there quite a bit because he quickly introduced me to the bartender who was also a peach. I then struck up a conversation with another cat sitting at the bar and he too was so friendly.

To be honest, I was already inebriated when I walked into Von and approached the bar. All my blurred vision could see was the caramel colored liquor in the bottles - scotch, whiskey, bourbon* - not my forte. After staring at my choices for what seemed like an eternity, a $10 Old Fashioned was chosen over an embarrassing Whiskey Sour. However it was a choice I neither regret nor spit out, since it was a damn good cocktail. Von is a place you can catch up with a friend or if you roll like an aZn, you can roll in 20 deep, which is what we did on a cold November night. The bouncer was quite welcoming and let us all in. Looking in from the outside this place looks like a regular small pub with one long bar along the side. Head to the back and turn the corner where there are seats to snuggle or converse with your date. Then head downstairs and enter a totally different dynamic. Music to shake what your mama gave you and another bar to progress the party to the next level. The scene, far from pretentious, the crowd very laid back and the tunes played on a Wednesday night were a nice change from the usual Top 40 radio hits you hear at every other place.

Guy starting calling my buddy a wiseass because he simply asked if one extra person from our group could come down (it was overcrowded down there too). Ask a simple question, get taunted by the bouncer, apparently.Eventually, we all made it downstairs and it was boring as hell. Nobody seemed to be having a good time on the dance floor and, like the upstairs, it was too crowded to get anywhere near it. That was pretty much the story of the entire night.

At first I was thrown off by the random dogs at the bar, but that just added to it's comfortableness. The decor definitely speaks ""less is more"", with it's brick walls, and wooden benches. This is definitely a great ""neighborhood bar"" feeling, yet still remaining cool and trendy without being pretentious.Downstairs is a totally different animal. After a few drinks and wanting to party more, a friend brought a group of us here. Initially thrown off by the first floor, I was surprised to find this stairwell, which could be mistaken for a bathroom entrance. This led to the lounge downstairs which felt like we were led to some super secret cool and chill hip-hop lounge.The lounge, though small, wasn't cramped. The bar, though busy, was easy enough to grab a drink from. The music was filled with the hip-hop and funk I wished more lounges were playing. The decor was dim and intimate, with so many little nooks and corners for you to hide out in.I was told to keep this place a secret, for hopes that it wouldn't become a over saturated, but I apparently can't keep a secret because I ended up celebrating my birthday here last November.

I don't know if it was the music or the crowd (both?), but not much dancing was going on.  Sad since I was hoping for some dancing, but maybe it was an off night.  Overall I'd definitely be willing to head back and give it another try.",,,
138,Lauren P.,"Brooklyn, NY",187,322,9,5.0,12/1/2012,"Von, Von, Von.  Mmm Mmm Mmm. I attended Von last night around 11 pm after getting smashed at karaoke. My friend said she use to frequent the bar often. I was a little skeptical about it because NoHo isn't really my stomping grounds and I know the crowd those places tend to attract. . The bouncers, Daniel and Daniel were extremely friendly and pleasant. We were let in immediately. The upstairs is a little more laid back. There are several tables and some really chill music like Frank Ocean. We made our way downstairs, and THAT is where the party was jumping! Old school Michael Jackson and Motown, 90's hip hop, salsa, Miguel and Frank Ocean..the music was ON POINT! I really loved the diversity of this place and that is the main reason I gave it 5 stars. It really captured the essence of what NYC is all about. I had a vodka and cranberry and it was delicious..the glass was pretty tall as well. I can't really tell you how much it cost because I didn't pay for it. There was enough space for everyone to dance and it wasn't a disgusting  hot box like I expected it to me. I will DEFINITELY be attending Von again. I would like to see what it looks like on a Saturday night.",1,,

I love how Von has a super low key - super nice bar up top & an amazing dance floor down stairs that almost gives you the aire of an exclusive little spot that you just want to keep a secret from everyone else. The ambiance is literally ME, from the great amount of soft lighting to the cork ceiling. What's even better is 9-10 the music is excellent...blending a little tribe called quest, a little alton ellis, some Rihanna (puke) etc etc. The only negative is the Asian DJ there sometimes. I mean she SUCKS and she takes NO requests...even when you get there the dance floor is packed and by the time she finishes there is no one on the dance floor.",2,,

Non stop grinding, and several make out sessions across the dance floor and bar! The ambiance: sweaty, steamy basement grove! Music: an eclectic mix of old school hip hop to new school radio hits!Advice: get there early to get downstairs and get your boggie on!

Great wine selection, good draft beer and the prices are more than fair for that part of town.  The fact that it's right next door to my favorite restaurant in possibly all of New York City doesn't hurt much either.  An interesting mix of people from the uber trendy to bridge and tunnel (like the guy named Chaz from Staten Island with the 3 gold chains trying to tell me how his Mama makes a meatball....).  I can't say I'm a fan on weekends when the place is practically busting at the seams and the one bathroom on the upper floor can get old really quick. And I'd rather be upstairs than downstairs with the base pumping squeezed in with way too many people in what surmounts to a well decorated finished basement.  Still though, I'll keep returning, and returning, and returning.

After about 5 songs of that we asked him if he could play something more upbeat cuz a girl can only grind so much.  He said he could but he won't because....direct quote ""My soul won't let me""...I said ""doesn't your soul also want people dancing?"" At this point there was really only a handful of people dancing.  He then got mean and said something i couldn't hear and didn't think it was nice enough to ask him to repeat it.  After that a couple more girls came up to him and asked him to play something more upbeat too...Denied.  So we all left and went to Sapphire where the DJ's soul is out to please the crowd.",,2,

The night the DP met two out of three brothers and one of my oldest friends. Yeah, scary. However, the atmosphere, the booze, the music and the very different areas at Von allowed for all tension to be diffused and everyone to continue to be amused. Downstairs, where the party-goers gathered, was a mix of dance-floor and lounge, with a large space lined with benches and tables and a DJ spinning up to the side. It was a little loud, but you could escape and go upstairs and sit in the weird little long room before the main area. The DP and I escaped there and were able to hold a proper conversation and sip our beers without him looking around nervously for my brothers. The main bar area is full of the usual NYU crowd trying to be a little different, but if anything it's amusing. Well, this time it was because no idiots jostled me or imposed their uselessness on my space. For you guys looking for variety in your alcohol consumption, Von has a great selection of beer and wine and on a weeknight you can enjoy a couple of tasty brews and quiet conversation.

Great atmosphere and the bar has slightly and old world charm. Reminded me a little of the bars we went to when I was living in Hungary.

171,Kira M.,"Los Angeles, CA",67,155,21,4.0,4/4/2010,"(3.5 stars)For whatever reason, I was under the (mistaken) impression that the dusky Von was small. Upon entering, it certainly seems to be: The bar area past the front door is a cramped, narrow rectangle. But then you spot the discrete, ancillary section on the first floor, which has several couches meant for groups.And then the stairs leading down... To a spacious, subterranean area. With what looks to be like a round boulder protruding from one of the walls. (I guess the owner attended a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" prop auction.) Experienced patrons are right - Von, on the whole, can get crowded - but, downstairs, there's more than enough wiggle room. In this third, and most rowdy, section, the speakers blast eclectic music, over which it's difficult to hear your conversation partner. The regulars (The crowd is late 20s/early 30s.), however, know it's best to skip the talk and, instead, sway to the beat. The space doesn't transform into a full-throttle dance party, but pockets of patrons certainly do put on a fun show of enjoying themselves.",,,1

THIS is von bar.""with the same wood-filled decor as the upstairs, it was full of a variety of ppl. no one looked too dressed up or dressed down. all about in their late 20's to early 30's. the bar area is pretty tight, and there is a dance area a few steps down but the dj was playing this awful slow funk or jazz-something that just didn't have a beat you could really dance to. maybe sway...hehe. so if it weren't for that we would have stayed but eventually ended up leaving to fat buddha where the music is always a guarantee hit! it's definitely a smaller venue, but perfect for a small group since it's a more hidden away spot, so it won't get too crowded. at least the night i went it wasn't. if you're looking for an intimate place that's kind of tucked away, for a small group, von may be your man ;)",1,1,1

The people watching is also on point because everyone is having a good time dancing, talking, and making out.

I try not to do magic on first dates, that just seems really trying too hard. I like to see if people like me without the magic. Then he says, oh you'll love this.He takes a chapstick and does a magic effect where he shoves it up his nose and it comes out of his mouth.He did a pretty good job for a layman. He flashed, but totally decent. Most people can't do even a simple ""gotcher nose!"" level sleight of hand. He was goofy, I kinda liked that.but then he pulls out the blackberry and starts texting. he's like ""I didn't tell you that I wanted to see this show tonight because I wanted you to come out.""  then we chat, then he starts texting again.

He's like, ""Oh no, I really think you're beautiful I just want to hang out tomorrow, that's all, there's a really cool band playing tonight"" He's slurring his words and staggering a little.

All I know is that his eyes were not focused and his head was kinda tilting, orbiting some invisible something, clockwise.PLUS, he just got back from 4 hours of getting tattoo work done on his arm that day.My friend Daisy told me aferwards while we drank bourbon at her house, ""See, I told you to stay away from models with full sleeve tattoos.""But I love full sleeve tattoos!Maybe I should stay away from models. I have to admit, I've never met a model that wasn't freakin' completely crazy.I think that there has to be a beautiful man out there who is NOT a jerk. I'll keep looking. I'm not prejudiced. I look at his wingman, who the hell takes a wingman to a blind date? and he shrugs.it was very crowded, standing room only, although my date and I had a couch in the corner and there were some cute dogs which I petted. Amazing cute homosexuals there too, really cute women, the men were okay looking, most of them had wedding rings on. Very weird night. Maybe this wasn't a good night to review Von. My cabernet sucked. My bad for ordering wine in an obvious beer bar. Not quiet enough to bring a date. Not roomy enough to pick up people, not hip enough to pick up cool people. Everyone here looked like amateur night, totally over dressed trying too hard, no one was very relaxed, mainly because everyone was standing and waiting for like for EVER to get drinks. Really, the only reason I had a vaguely good time was becasue this cute blonde guy had this sweet dog that was so cute and I pet the dog and I talked to the guy's wingman who seemed very nice.I'd like to try Von again, but maybe with friends, and a LOT earlier in the evening. It was too crowded for anything to be fun.",4,7,4
185,John S.,"Louisville, KY",0,13,1,2.0,9/13/2014,"This a place has good potential - but executed all wrong. The drinks we're decent - not great, but the real issue is the bartender and staff. We asked about one of the cocktails - and got told ""it's exactly like the ingredients on the chalk board - read the chalk board.""",,,
186,Scott P.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,63,0,3.0,3/1/2009,"Hmmm. I really don't actually have an opinion about this place, I'm kinda right down the middle. I just feel like I've been there a ton of times recently, enough so that I really have to state some sort of feeling for it.Well, now they have a bizarre, still somewhat unfinished dungeon in the downstairs area. with dancing, i guess? and a weird drain in the middle of the tile floor. really, it's weird.but that means the rest of the bar is less crowded! and i can do my favorite thing in the whole world - sit down! Ahhhhh. my dogs. So I guess it's fine as places in that part of town go, where i temporarily am doing the vast majority of my drinking. i like my new friends that i go there with, so that's nice.",2,1,1
187,Patricia S.,"New York, NY",56,527,281,4.0,3/30/2010,"Von and Bianca, Bianca and Von - two peas in a pod. So beautiful and loving together. So hospitable. They're such a happy couple, you just want to be mad at them for being happy and making you happy too! Bianca is the lovely (cash only! ) Italian restaurant next to Von. You can get Bianca's food walked over to Von, if it's not too crowded. Also, you can sit out your wait at Von and the hostess will be happy to come over and give you a shout when your table is ready. The happy hour isn't really that 'happy' in my opinion (read: not that cheap and with not nearly enough variety), but I still go there around happy hour time on weekdays because it's low-key at that time of day, not too crowded and it has the perfect atmosphere for an intimate conversation with a friend or lover. I don't need to add anything about the quality of the cocktails (superb!) or how it's dog-friendly (excellent!), the other yelpers did so for me. I've never really gone on weekends, because I just expect it to be too hectic for me. Weekdays are where it's at.",,,
188,Jennifer M.,"New York, NY",28,50,0,3.0,10/10/2007,"I was working an event right next door and a friend suggested we meet for drinks here. It was a very comfortable vibe - wine was great, atmosphere was friendly. Had a neighborhood feel to it - people brought their dogs, several people seemed to know the bartender, each other, etc. I went on a Monday night - so it wasn't very crowded, don't know how it is on weekends. There is a large back room with benches and tables - would be great for a date or a group of friends. It's also a place I would feel comfortable to hang out and have a glass of wine by myself. I like those kinds of places.It is a bit pricey (for me anyway) - a glass of wine costs about $9.00 - but honestly, it's always really, really good wine and I don't mind the splurge. The bartenders are good with recommending and explaining the wine. They also let you taste the wine before you buy a glass to make sure you like it.They have this absolutely wonderful pinot noir, it's some kind of organic blend - it's much lighter than usual - but it is so good, I swear to god, I pretty much will take a trip from West Harlem to the lower east side just to have a glass. Really. It's that good.Also, if you're not into wine - they do have beer and mixed drinks you can order.How could you not try the wine though? Come on - just try the wine.EDIT:  Well, I found out what it IS like on the weekends and I took two stars off after my Saturday night encounter with the place. It literally transformed from charming, relaxed, neighborhood bar to music pounding pick-up scene.  It was absolutely packed - mostly with dates and small groups of people eagle eying every table ready to pounce when it became empty.  Ugh. Not very relaxing.",5,1,3
189,Rebekah K.,"San Francisco, CA",90,168,0,4.0,10/23/2008,"The space is nice & if you go to the back around the bar its somewhat quieter. We saw someone drinking this pretty drink called a French75 which seems to have been the special of the evening. It was DEE-LISH! Its a cocktail with gin, champagne & lemon juice. Its kind of a nicer lemon drop. I felt super classy!My favorite part about the the affair was not the drinks however, but rather that one of the 3 drinks were comped. [Our party included my husband, a friend & myself] The bartender apparently thought my husband, the bringer of drinks, was attractive. Not only was one of the drinks taken off the tab, but we also got away with not having to pay the $25 credit card minimum. I guess I'm not the only one who likes the Hubbie's sweet, sweet ass.PS...This was the bar we were told was the closest to a San Francisco bar by a person who didn't really seem too sure where in California she was from. By SF bar all we wanted was a place with no TVs & the feeling you weren't gonna get beer spilled on you.",3,2,2
190,Kathleen R.,"Manhattan, NY",454,215,152,3.0,6/1/2008,"3.5 reallyA great neighborhood place.  We came toward the end of the evening on a Saturday, and while Von was crowded, there were a few open seats and plenty of standing room.  The bartender was friendly, and they had a nice selection of beer and wine, in addition to a few specialty cocktails.  I asked for a gin gimlet (not listed) which was very nice on a hot, humid night.Von has a cool vibe to it.  It's a casual, chill local spot, and while it probably won't blow you away, it's a great place to stop in and have a reasonably-priced drink while enjoying the varied E. Village crowd.",3,,3
191,Jennifer H.,"Los Angeles, CA",165,74,2,4.0,5/28/2011,"Wonderful location.  Friendly hotties.  Casual atmosphere. I like my girlie drinks though- so I was disappointed to find they didn't have milk or anything to make sweet drinks like White  Russians, nuts & berries, etc.   Nevertheless- I would def go back.  Didn't get to go downstairs but will on my next go.",1,,1
192,Jane H.,"New York, NY",96,28,10,5.0,10/22/2008,"This is my favorite bar in the city.  I prefer to come here during the week because the weekends are insane/crazypacked but during the week, the crowd is just right.  However no matter how busy the place is you never have to wait more then a minute to get a drink.  The bartenders here are amazing and so friendly. I give it 5 stars because on top of the casual lax vibe it has (which is perfect to meet a friend or a date) the place always has perfect lighting and the music is always pretty darn good.",2,2,3
193,Rebecca H.,"Portland, OR",9,49,0,4.0,4/14/2012,"Very cool small, rustic bar. I went on a Wednesday night, so I'm not sure how crazy it gets on the weekend. However the night I went it was pretty relaxed and calm. It's a nice place to have a drink and talk with a friend. The bartenders were really friendly, which is always a plus. I wasn't too impressed with the beer selection, but they have a descent list of wines and a handful of house cocktails. I tried the Bleeker Rose which was simple and tasty. I might go back if I hang out around that area again.",,,
194,Jeremy S.,"San Francisco, CA",5000,1346,2318,3.0,11/16/2008,"Von reminds me of Elbo Room in the Mission for those of you that know the San Francisco landscape. You won't see many folks in stripe-y button downs or cocktail dresses, it's more of a causal drinking-with-your-friends place with a touch of hipster flare. I was here twice in the last week, both times it was pretty crowded and finding a comfy place to sit was tricky. Most people are just standing, so my recommendation is get tipsy enough so you don't mind getting regularly bumped around. Also interestingly this bar seems to have more dudes than women (probably because its a little gritty), which is a bit of a rarity in Manhattan.",2,,4
195,Samantha P.,"Glen Cove, NY",6,36,1,3.0,8/27/2011,"Friends and I went to Von a few days ago. It looked like a little bar on the outside, but when you got inside, it had extra tables toward the back, as well as another room with benches and tables. The drinks were a little too expensive for my liking, but overall it was a great place.The crowd was a mix of business people and casually-dressed people. It wasn't as dark as some other bars I've been too, so at least you can see people when you're talking to them! Everyone seemed to know everyone else, which created a nice atmosphere.",1,,
196,Lauren L.,"Astoria, NY",128,529,0,4.0,5/5/2011,"I went here last weekend with some girlfriends and was kicking myself for having never been here before. At first when I walked into this place I couldn't believe how packed it was and wanted to immediately run for the hills. However, there is a downstairs area that while very bare bones (re: just a few tables and some super dim lighting) was great and quiet. There was only a handful of people downstairs with us and kinda gave the feel that we were the only ones at the bar. I would absolutely go back and try the martinis, which my friend raved about. Overall prices are good, there is a pretty extensive selection of glasses, and there are a handful of $11 cocktails for those who steer clear of vino.",1,,1
197,Miles H.,"Taipei, Taiwan",51,170,0,3.0,4/1/2010,"Good little bar, but always packed. I'm not sure if its driven by the overflow from Bianca's or vice versa. This place has a laid back upstairs bar which gets very packed, however the downstairs is much more spacious and has a good dance floor. This is the goto place when waiting for your table at Bianca's.Also, not a bad single malt selection.",,,
198,Adam R.,"Brooklyn, NY",423,741,150,4.0,11/17/2008,"It's an abstract word, but ""vibe"" is very important for places like Von.  The space is sort of small, the decor is nice, but nothing incredible, but what got me was the vibe.  It's the kind of place that is fairly packed at 10 PM on a Tuesday night.  Sure, some of the people in there are morons, but no worse than half the places in the area.  And that counts for something.Their wine selection isn't huge, but what they do have is pretty good.  I'd say too many whites for being later in the year, but that's me being picky.  Their non-wine selection is pretty good too, though I question the person that goes into the wine bar and gets light beer.",2,1,2
199,Liz I.,"New York, NY",18,9,0,3.0,4/29/2008,"A great bar to have a drink after work or to start a Friday or Saturday night.No frills, no happy hour, back to basics.The crowd at Von is mixed- from your hip, young professionals to your Robert Redford style older crowd; and everything in between.  Once spotted Ty Pennington and a lady friend there!",2,1,2
