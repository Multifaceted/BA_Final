0,Adam S.,"New York, NY",1542,292,2047,4.0,11/14/2018,"Route 66 Cafe is your basic glorified local diner.  That said, you have to go in with the right expectations.  I've visited several times for weekend brunch or a casual bite to eat for dinner and have had a pleasant experience every time I've gone.  A quick lesson: Most NYC ""diner"" style restaurants don't have amazing service, both usually have a large menu offering an eclectic variety of entrees with all sorts of proteins.  Route 66 serves big portions at somewhat reasonable prices. If you order from their brunch menu, it includes one brunch juice or alcoholic beverage and a coffee or tea.  The service is quick, the food is decent, the ambience is eccentric yet somehow all fits together.  One of my usual orders: BBQ Hickory Burger - made with a turkey burger instead of a beef burger.  Never disappoints.",2,,1
1,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,4.0,7/3/2018,"I came here without a reservation with a group of 5 friends and we were seated immediately. The booth seating was comfortable and the interior decor had cool silver balls of different sizes on the ceiling. There were floor to ceiling windows in the front, brick walls, brown tables and yellow/blue accents. It had a casual feel. After being seated, we were given complimentary muffins and pastries, which was great. There were bran muffins and corn muffins and the pastries had sweet cheese and apple or berry fillings. The corn muffins were nice and moist and the pastries were wonderfully sweet.The menu is quite extensive and includes breakfast/brunch meals, as well as sandwiches, burgers, wraps, salads, pasta, steak, chicken, seafood and desserts. I was having a tough time deciding but finally went with one of the frittatas, which consisted of bacon, meunster cheese, onion and peppers, with a side of potatoes. This also came with juice, coffee and toast. I enjoyed the frittata, which was a thick egg based omelet-like dish with melted meunster cheese on top. The frittata was delicious and flavorful, packed with crispy bacon, perfectly sauteed and fresh veggies and there was delightful melty cheese in every bite. The potatoes were well seasoned and tasty.Our waitress was lovely and made sure we had everything we needed. I would consider coming back, but only if they turned the AC on. When we came, they had the doors opened instead of the AC.",12,7,11

Updated review","Worst bison burger I have every had. It was like a pre made patty they popped out of the freezer and severed up. The coleslaw was discussing to even look at. Why even serve it, If it is old. The only good thing was the fires and delivery service. I would not recommend this place at all.I decided to give this place another chance considering it's right by my place of business. It seemed as if people sit outside enjoying breakfast and brunch and that was what I was in the mood for. I called to order delivery. To make a long story short the lady who answered the phone took my address but did not bother to ask for my name. I work in an office building so I gave her the extension to reach me. The food took over 45 minuets to come and I'm right across the street. When I called to check on the ETA the same woman said the delivery was on its way. 10 minuets later I call back because I had not received my food. The woman proceeded to tell me the delivery guy went to the 3rd floor and asked for someone who no longer works for the company (remember she never asked for my name and assumed the name correlating with the address was me). WRONG! She also never bothered to record the correct extension nor the correct floor that I gave her during our first conversation. To rectify the situation she had my food remade and sent TO THE WRONG FLOOR AGAIN. The front desk called and sent the delivery guy to the correct floor. I apologized to the delivery guy because it is not his fault that his coworker is not doing a very good job. Let's move on to the food. The French toast as decent. The eggs were cooked properly but had a burnt taste most likely due to a DIRTY flat top grill. The sausage was good going down but later that day I was as nauseous as could be and that breakfast was the only thing I ate. For midtown where the competition it competitive I don't know how they survive. I'm DISGUSTED and permanently turned off.",,1,
3,Hannah T.,"New York, NY",205,62,155,3.0,5/29/2018,"Relatively good happy hour specials for the area! I enjoyed my massive burger, fries, and beer. ($17.) unable to control ourselves, my friend and I split the happy hour fries pickles as well. It was a large serving size, complimented with a garlicky dipping sauce.  If I were to go back, I'd get there earlier and just order apps and drinks.  Normally I'm a staunch believer that more food is better, but this was a bit too heavy for my night out. There's outdoor seating and the service was good. Some of the other dinner menus seemed a bit more expensive and ""fancy"". However, for me this restaurant was a much more casual location. Overall, not bad!",,,
4,Caroline N.,"Queens, NY",37,235,1745,4.0,3/18/2018,"Came here for a bite to eat while waiting for an item and all the nearby restaurants were crowded.The restaurant is mid-sized, clean and it was packed.  There were 4 2-people hightop tables by the wall.  Unfortunately, we needed a table for four.  The waiting area is a bit narrow especially with customers waiting and others trying to exit or delivery guys passing by.  After about 15 minutes, we were seated.The waitress gave us a complimentary plate of muffins.  It isn't warm but it was good to stave off hunger.There is a brunch menu that comes with a drink (bloody Mary, Mimosa, screwdriver, juice, coffee or tea).  Nothing on the brunch menu was appealing to me, I wanted a burger (Swiss Mushroom Burger medium).  It came with pickle slices, coleslaw, tomato slices and lettuce and french fries.  It was made perfectly though I could only eat the burger.  If you need a refill on the hot water or coffee, might need to ask and it gets refilled quickly.There are 2 bathrooms...no gender specific...it's relatively clean.Nice place if you need a burger or local joint.",1,,
5,Keemy U.,"Manhattan, NY",122,103,197,4.0,6/1/2018,This is a great location and they're open practically all day. The strawberry colada was very good. You don't taste the alcohol but you do feel it at the end. It taste like a healthy strawberry smoothie. They're appetizer servings aren't that great but they are tasty. I would come back for a burger because they look very good. The waiter was friendly and nice. They have outside seating and a pretty small bar.,3,,3

7,Rachel M.,"New York, NY",188,145,247,3.0,9/9/2017,"This is a solid 3 - wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but totally fine for a diner-style bite in the area. I went for brunch with a friend after a run in Central Park because we were starving and looking for the first place that looked like the crowds approved, and Route 66 was packed enough for us to feel comfortable with our decision. We both got eggs which were a good deal. $15.95 for our omelettes (she got the California frittata and I got the green omelette) which came with toast, a side (hers had potatoes and mine had fruit - really great berries!) as well as an alcoholic beverage + coffee/tea. Neither of our eggs came with cheese so we added it for $1.50 and they oddly melted it on top of the eggs, but it did the job. The meals were perfectly average - loaded with veggies, a bit greasy, but succeeded in satiating our post-run appetites. Additionally, the service was verrrrry slow.",,,
8,Kateland R.,"Washington, DC",249,39,77,4.0,2/17/2018,"This place wasn't that bad as it seems. Me and my bf just stumbled upon this spot when it was snowing really hard, so it was convenient and there was NO wait. I ordered the salmon burger, and my bf ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Both came with fries, some cole slaw, pickles on top, and a side of lettuce and tomatoes to put in your burger/sandwich if you wanted. Mine was good if you like a healthier alternative, but the pulled pork was way better. It had a hint of spicy too, so if you like spice order this! Also, the portions are pretty big so you'll get full fast. But I don't not recommend!",,,
9,Kathleen H.,"Manhattan, NY",212,7,4,5.0,9/24/2018,Fresh and fast service. Generous portions. We came for lunch and the variety of lunch specials is sure to please anyone. Great variety and they also offer soup of the day in 2 different flavors! Our waiter was friendly. Not so crowded place and the windows are floor to ceiling and opened up during the warm season. There is also some seating outside. Highly recommend !,,,
10,Folasade A.,"North Berkeley, Berkeley, CA",1,33,29,3.0,6/21/2018,"This place is cute and kind of small, the food was just okay, and same with the service. They have regular American dishes, burgers, salads, sandwiches, etc. I asked for a smoothie which was not good at all but they were nice enough to bring me a different one. The prices are cheap as well. It's kind of a hole in the wall place, at least with all the construction going on currently. There are TVs to watch sports and a bar as well. Beer seems to be a big thing here. There are bathrooms for customers as well. It was good, but I wouldn't be in a rush to come back.",,,
11,Jerry F.,"Manhattan, NY",87,173,15,3.0,8/31/2018,"There were five of us, including two children.  The place hit the spot for the most part. We went there two days in a row because it was kid friendly.  I really liked my burger with mushrooms and Swiss.  The French fries were hot, crisp, and fresh. The only thing was the bun was a brioche that totally fell apart.  I would have preferred the multigrain, but they never mentioned it. The next night I had a Greek salad with chicken.  Chicken was not dry which was great, but anchovies were way too salty.  Also, something was wrong with the ice tea that day.",,,

13,Chelsea S.,"Philadelphia, PA",24,262,389,4.0,11/23/2017,"A super chill cafe in the Columbus Circle Area. I picked this one out for its chill vibe, out of the other more fancy looking places on 9th ave. It definitely has a down-to-earth atmosphere . It is a place where you could have a glass of wine and a snack with no extra frills. Happy hour is from around 3:30 to 7 and even though we missed the happy hour we still had a good time with two glasses of wine, sweet potato fries and mozzarella sticks. The wine was tasty and the snacks comforting. Locals and workers seem to favor this place, so it is a good indication about the quality of atmosphere, food, wine and local color.",,,
14,Josh K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",294,1309,45,4.0,10/8/2017,"Basically an upgraded Greek diner trying to get a little more upscale with its offering and stop feeling like a diner... It's good though. We came for lunch from a conference near Columbus Circle. The specials were filling and tasty. I got a pastrami panini, which I thought would be risky, but it actually was very good. Service was friendly and prompt and while it was empty to begin with, it got a little more crowded closer to 1PM but they were still responsive.It's not Masa or anything, but given the expectation (junky diner food shoddily dressed up) it ended up being good and satisfying. It gets a 4 for solidly beating those expectations.",1,1,
15,Pamela N.,"London, United Kingdom",0,49,37,3.0,5/18/2018,"I visited this place for brunch on Sunday, very busy! I was seated at the bar since was the only space available. I ordered the pancakes with chocolate chips and Bellini (which is include on brunch price) the portion was a good size and filling but the pancakes were quite dry, definitely you would need lots of water to finish eating them. The Bellini nothing special, super light it's more like an orange juice. Overall the experience was just ok, I might give it another chance for lunch just because the prices are reasonable but will see",,,

17,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",785,815,371,4.0,5/8/2017,I flat out adore this cafe. If I lived in the hood I'd be here many times a week. It's so cute with the brick wall.

19,Paige W.,"New York, NY",103,67,68,5.0,7/9/2017,"This review is for the happy hour only. The first thing worth noting is that the sangria is hand-crafted instead of pre-mixed. The bartender adds triple sec, brandy, and some other stuff...I was sold as soon as I heard brandy. It is $7 on happy hour or you can get it as part of the $12.95 drink plus appetizer option.I got picked the appetizer plus drink special and ordered the hummus, which was delicious. The hummus was creamy and had a little spice to it. My friend ordered the pork sliders and said they were delicious as well.We sat at the bar and had fast service. I recommend this as an option for happy hour, esp. if you are a sangria fan like myself.",,,

Updated review","Came here with a group of 6 since it was so close to Mt. Sinai hospital. Definitely exceeded expectations! The Route 66 burger was cooked perfectly and the fries we big and delicious! I had the chicken avocado salad and others had the mango salad and, woah, they were huge!!! The salads are pricey (14-19$) but the portion was definitely worth it. I took half home and had lunch for the next day! Great place for a date or even a quick drink in you're in the area. They also have gluten free buns which really caught my eye! Good for all types of diets and overall a great experience- service could have been a bit better.",,,
21,Anna N.,"Manhattan, NY",61,199,240,4.0,3/12/2017,"I enjoyed my brunch here! I was seated right away on a Sat. afternoon which is great because I don't want to wait an hour at high traffic tourist spots. Seating was comfortable and not cramped like other tiny NY restaurants. I enjoyed my eggs benedict and complimentary mimosa. I liked the potatoes that came with it because they had a ""smash like"" quality and salsa. I've seen a fancy chef cook these on tv but haven't had it in a restaurant. I wish the entree also came with a small side of salad. I had good service. Their drink menu looked great with several rum cocktails, but it was too early for that. I'll be back! Affordable prices too!",3,1,4
22,Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,274,1594,4.0,3/21/2016,"Strolled in here for breakfast on this first day of spring. (Sure doesn't feel like it though with all this fresh snow!) Route 66 is very American West road trip themed.........the whole restaurant gives that typical diner in the middle of the desert feel. The menu reflects the same feeling with your classic burgers, fries, and milkshakes.However I came in too early this morning for all of that. So I decided to get the Eggs Benedict instead. I also ordered a Pina Colada because why not, I wanna feel like I'm in the Caribbean.There weren't that many other patrons this early in the morning, so my food came out pretty fast. The eggs were perfectly poached, the whites nice and solid but the yolks were warm and runny. The Hollandaise sauce had a nice tangy quality to it, and it all came together with the ham and English muffin it was served on.The Pina Colada had me day dreaming of crystal clear blue waters, palm trees, swimming with stingrays and dolphins before retiring to my hotel room by nightfall.Definitely stop by Route 66 when you're in the neighborhood.",11,6,7
23,Zach A.,"San Diego, CA",3,32,60,2.0,9/4/2017,"Had mocha and vegetarian omelette. Omelette comes with potatoes, toast and house salsaOmelette and potatoes were not tasty at all, not seasoned well and it came cold already, toast was cold and dry. Salsa was good though. One of the top 10 worst Omelettes and potatoes that I ever had.  Not giving any stars for this.I give one star for the $5 mocha, it was very good and the cup was fairly big. Also some kind of hair or plant roots were swimming in my glass of water. I told them about it and they took the cup and offered me another one, I said no thanks.",1,,1
24,Todd H.,"New York, NY",195,42,273,2.0,1/20/2018,"Tried it twice now recently for an early breakfast. Eggs, ordered medium, were undercooked. Miniscule ice cold butter pads served with lukewarm flimsy toast that couldn't be spread. First visit: sausage links requested well done had to be sent back to be cooked more to order. This time, turkey sausage was tried. Was good. But is pricey. Hash browns this time were decent. My first visit I had fruit salad. Melons were unripe too crisp and berries were dried up and past their prime. Service wasn't good. Requests made and politely received but then waitstaff was busy with other orders and I had to request refills and water more than once each time. Note: I was here early. Only 10 guests present at the time. Does service get better when they're busy? Take your chances. Decor is warm and nice. Clean. And this place has been here a long time. I've been here many times over a decade or more. But I'm done with this place for breakfast.",2,,1

Updated review","I was there for breakfast on a cold weekend morning. The restaurant had yet to fill up and I took a seat. I got coffee right away and then ordered a ham and cheese omelette with rye toast and bacon. The meal, as usual, was delicious. I spent time over another cup of coffee but i had always been here for breakfast. They also offer lunch and dinner and brunch on Saturday and Sundays. [from 10A-4P] There is a happy hour every day from 3-7p and again from 10P to closing featuring draft beers, mojitos and margaritas for $6 each.

For pasta, we love the rigatoni w Italian sausage, broccoli and spinach (I do shrimp on this and no sausage).Note the entrees come w soup or salad too so you will be full.I've come in for brunch twice and it didn't disappoint.

My friend ordered their Veggie Burger and loves how they do it (I did not sample to check if her opinion was sound however) and for me it was a Cuban style panini.  I love a good Cuban sandwich when its made right and felt it would be interesting to have in a panini.  The order came with french fries (served in a cup) along with some Russian dressing which I felt was odd and more of a Rueben sandwich thing but oh well.  My sandwich was nicely sized but I did feel that it was a tad too dry.  The Cuban had ham and sliced pork along with cheese and pickles and so it should have been like biting into sand.  Still tasty I surmised that perhaps it was pressed too long.  I asked the server if this was usually this dry but she wasn't aware and was alright with replacing it but I didn't want to be that customer.  The provided dressing worked fine at helping the sandwich be less dry.  No drinks other than water this time as I had a full afternoon of to do still but I will def check this place out again if I am in the vicinity.  You should too.  Oh yeah, there WAS WifI but despite trying to plug in the password it never worked and no one knew what was wrong - oh well.  A minor issue.  My Foodspotting would have to wait until I got home.",2,3,1

The manager had the order resent and even gave me a little treat to make up for the botched delivery. They always listen to requests made on the delivery order, such as extra ketchup or pickles. They are a well managed, seasoned operation and true survivors of New Yorks restaurant wars. They are well worth a visit.",1,,

I had the turkey club and added avocado, delish though the mayo came on the side which I didn't love. The fries it came with were great though! Boyfriend got the fried chicken with cornbread & garlic mash, very tasty I must say. The food came out hot and service was good! I'd like to try it for lunch, it strikes me as more of a lunch/brunch spot being that it's a cafe and has an upscale diner feel. We shall see next time!",,,
45,Ally W.,"New York, NY",143,590,507,2.0,8/23/2016,Maybe it was just an off day...we ordered four drinks and got four of the most watered down happy hour specials ever served. The sangria came in a glass of mostly ice and then fruit and then a splash of wine. The mojito was missing a key ingredient - the sugar that is suppose to be mashed with the mint - which was also a few pieces short of being called mint.,3,,1

We stopped in because it was not that full, and the menu looked interesting. The decor was hip and we were greeted friendly enough.Then the server took very long to get our order and on a hot day we had to flag down to get refills.Food- not seasoned. As in beans that tasted as if they opened the can and dumped them on a plate. The huevos rancheros were uncreative, under seasoned and luke warm. Also the plating made no sense and was not inviting at all. The veggie frittata was not seasoned, and the vegetables were not cut to an appropriate size. Uneven and huge. Why does that matter you ask? Because when you cook veggies you want them all the same size so they cook even and all the same. So the consistency of taste was way off.The food and service was like a bad greasy spoon dive - but with expensive midtown hotel prices.My advice, SKIP this place.",3,1,
48,Eric H.,"New York, NY",6,39,1,3.0,3/25/2017,"Something like a diner ""light"" Rt. 66 is a nice little place with some decent and healthy menu options, as well as variety. I particularly enjoy their juices and smoothies, and the food I've had here is always solid. Others I have dined with here also seem to have enjoyed their meals. My preference is for their wraps and eggs Florentine.The one drawback to this place is that they tend to be a bit on the slow side in terms of how long it takes for food to arrive at the table. This is a factor which I must frequently weigh when deciding where to dine. As a consequence I do not visit Rt. 66 as often as I otherwise might. When I am not in a rush I find this is a pretty good place to go.Service is friendly and professional. The food and juices have always been tasty and seemed fresh.",2,1,1

Even lots of salt did not rescue the avocado, mushroom and onions South west omelette.  The pancakes were also rather pedestrian.  It did not help that it took more than 1/2 hour to get our food and we had to bug our waitress to check on our order.It's a shame - it used to be a really great place.",2,,

The waiter did try to make up for the overcooked steak by giving us a piece of cheesecake on the house which was nice.  The cheesecake was huge and very good.The atmosphere was nice.  Memorabilia related to Route 66 were hanging on the walls and the bar was retro.  The White Sangria was very good.  It had strawberries in it.,3,,

Highly recommend this place, not only for the food/drinks, but the entire atmosphere was super cute & perfectly represented the ""Route 66"" theme.  It's hard to find a place in this neighborhood that's welcoming & of high quality with their food & staff for a reasonable price, but this place really steps it up.

69,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,529,28,3.0,6/10/2014,"After a long day of kayaking on the Hudson (...okay, it was more like 30 minutes), we were famished and looking for just about anything to eat. One of the first restaurants we stumbled upon was Route 66. Once we noticed that the brunch specials came with a free drink, we were in. There was a bit of outdoor seating but empty tables, so we took a seat inside. The interior was bright and airy. I headed straight for the bathroom to change out of my Hudsony clothes... luckily it was clean and larger than your average NYC bathroom so I had room to move around.Although it is true that the brunches come with a free beverage, the drinks are basically built into the price of the dishes. I had a blackened chicken salad that cost $16, but was worth right around $16 minus the price of a brunch cocktail. The salad was actually pretty good - ranch dressing, nice-sized bites of tasty chicken, other salad ingredients. I also enjoyed my Bloody Mary and even ordered a second. The waiter actually forgot about it for a while, but that was remedied by him only charging me $4 for it (it was supposed to have been $7 or $8). Service was pleasant enough.In short, not a bad option if you are in the area and concerned chiefly with convenience. If you are looking for a dining experience or excellent food, there are probably better places to seek out.",5,2,2

My best friend and I decided to try a new place and we'd heard decent things about Route 66 Cafe's breakfast/brunch so we decided to have lunch there that day.I ordered the ""Black Margarita"" which sounded interesting in lieu of a regular margarita. Our server had no clue what the drink was, though it was blatantly listed on their specialty drink list. We ordered calamari to start and while it looked incredible, and our server informed me that the bar didn't have the ingredients to even make the cocktail, which was a let down. The calamari didn't go down without a fight, though. It was quite tasteless and a bit rubbery.  He ordered the gyro and I ordered a ""bleu cheese infused burger"" with bacon and onions. My burger (which came with a patty, grilled onions on top and tomatoes and lettuce on the side) lacked the taste of a decently caramelized onions, the tang or creaminess of anything to be ""infused""of bleu cheese, I can't even believe there could've been bacon in the patty because there certainly wasn't any on top or underneath it. My friend's gyro was a few pieces of sausage patties and lettuce and tomato on the side. I've seen better presentation of a gyro from the average bodega. He says it tasted like generic breakfast sausage. If their breakfast is what it promises to be, it may be worth checking out if you can't go to your usual place.... maybe. As for the lunch experience that we had, I can't say I regret the meal - for that was something we suffered through voluntarily.

I saw someone else's lox and it actually looked good.

Updated review","The food and service are great. It's a great neighborhood go-to place. BUT, they are single-handedly producing more paper and plastic garbage than any other restaurant on earth! Today I ordered a simple egg salad sandwich on a roll with an ice tea to go. Here is what I got:Egg salad sandwich in a PLASTIC CONTAINERNapkins, plastic fork, straw, and a small plastic container of cole slaw in a PAPER BAGIce tea, with TIN FOIL wrapped around the top in another PAPER BAGAll of this was then put into another huge PLASTIC bag for me to take across the street!They could have simply put the sandwich and cole slaw in a small paper bag and handed me the ice tea without any further wrapping. It is absolutely maddening that this happens every single time I get food.

I went there for a quick bite with some friends, and even though my expectations were low and I just wanted something simple, was thoroughly UNimpressed. First, they messed up my friend's order by giving her the wrong burger. They not only didn't apologize, but implied that maybe she was just wrong about her order. When she sent it back, they added a few toppings but didn't actually correct the order. It took forever for our food to arrive, with other tables that arrived after us nevertheless served before us. A waiter spilled something on my friend's shoes. We received no apology for any of this, and even though they said they would ""make it up to us"" but didn't take anything off the bill. There are better options nearby for the same price. Don't bother with this place.",4,,

The place is practically empty besides another table. They are fully staffed. We are given our drinks and food. Never does our waitress come back to check on us again. My drink was empty and never did it get refilled. We were just sitting waiting for our check to come. Nope. She just sat at the bar. The owner and other waiters made Eye contact with us not doing anything. Finally 100% annoyed I go up to the owner and say ""excuse me, may we get the check please?"" He pays no attention to me. I approach him even closer and ask again. The entire morale and attitude is below indifference with the owner and staff. They'd rather sit around and talk to each other. I was livid. I can understand if we aren't helped that much if you're busy, but when there are only two tables taken in the place you'd think this would be easy for them by constantly being on top of our refills and checking on us, if we need boxes or our check, but no! THE WORST SERVICE OF MY LIFE!",8,1,
106,Jenn V.,"New York, NY",17,17,2,1.0,12/8/2013,Came for lunch on a Friday because they have a fairly extensive menu so I figured I would find something to satisfy everyone's tastebuds.

She also forgot to bring over my soup that I ordered and when I brought it to her attention she apologized half heartedly. Only good part about this place is the ambiance but I won't return.,7,1,

I was a little confused at the name, given that THE Route 66 starts in Illinois and ends in California...but I figured they were either trying to be cute or referring to some other, lesser-known Route 66. The restaurant is a bit grungy, with a definite diner feel as you enter. Tables are very close together, and the dining area is quite small. In spite of the double doors, a fair amount of cold air would come in with each entering or exiting guest.Service was a bit below average, as our waitress was either hard of hearing or not very good at English. She also disappeared for quite a while after we requested the check, then forgot to bring the check until we reminded her a couple more times. Other staff members stared at us blankly as we awaited her return.Food was pretty average, and nobody was all that wild about their selection. I had some very watery cottage cheese and a fruit smoothie that wasn't too bad. The rest of the group had various egg and sausage items, which they neither complained nor raved about. They did say the sausage was weird, though (and it looked weird).In another city, I might return to this restaurant if I were in the area. In New York, though, I wouldn't bother.

The comments below about the waitress are true, she's not very attentive and definitely not energetic. But it's a nice change from other places try to rush you out so we really didn't mind and actually preferred her hands off approach.The food was very average. I thought the burgers were going to be the main attraction from the decor of the place, but our bison burger was very average. We got the ranchero burger and I definitely think they could've used a fresh salsa instead of whatever canned stuff was on there. We also asked for a medium burger but received it well-done. The mushroom salad was good. Very fresh, however instead of roasted red peppers, there were fresh red peppers- not the same thing!

The restaurant was about 30% full, and they tried to usher my friend and I to the bar (which only has 4 seats) to have a drink, rather than just letting us sit. I find this annoying because often, don't people spend just as much on 2-3 rounds of drinks as they would on a meal + water, or a meal + one drink? The server promptly started explaining dinner specials, and when I interjected to say, ""hey, we're having drinks"" he continued his sentence. No stopping those specials, man. I ordered a frozen strawberry colada, which while it tasted good, looked frankly stupid upon arrival. I'll post the pic. It was in a wine glass, with a white straw. I didn't realize it was Cancun springbreak circa 2007 night.They took forever to pick up the check. Did not say good night to guests leaving the restaurant, but instead stood looking sad and dejected at the door. How depressing.But I guess what you guest for eating somewhere with a name the same as a brand of jeans sold at Kmart. Shame on me!Spend your drink dollars elsewhere, is my recommendation.",9,,

However, it seems a bit too modern and upscale to be a ""diner""  I had a burger with an overeasy egg and bacon - not bad, but nothing out of the ordinary. For those of you from SoCal, it's comparable to something you could get at Knowlwoods, except it was about twice the price. The fries were pretty legit - tasty, crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside.

This should NOT be recommended as a good place to eat for a tourist! SMH I went here with my best friend and we had to keep reminding the waiter of things we asked. She was the bartender and waiter so this place is definitely understaffed. The weather was nice so we sat outside in the patio area in front of the restaurant. While we were waiting for our food, they had a delivery and was bringing in raw meat and other food in the front door. They should have had least went in the back entrance...smh.. The garden salad wasn't at all impressive. The penne alla vodka with grilled chicken was okay and my friend enjoyed her burger and fries. The price could have been better for the quality of the food. We went during happy hour and the drinks was definitely disappointing. We both ordered desert, I asked for a plain vanilla ice cream and my friend ordered a slice of red velvet. When the food came out, she had added all things that i didn't ask for to the ice cream, smh and as I was eating it, I found a hair looking substance in it!! I got the waiter's attention and he even looked disgusted with it. They got the manager and all she said was that it stretches so it can't be hair but they don't know how it got in my ice cream! smh..I lost my appetite and found no reason to continue eating there. Then our actual waiter had the nerve to say she was busy when we were trying to get her attention to correct our bill!! I was sooo done after that, how are you working in hospitality and telling the customer that you are busy??!!! I've never heard that before. Do Not go here!

I ordered the Romanian steak n eggs and substituted the eggs for Benedict style w no hassles, the English muffin was perfectly toasted and the hollandaise was delightful.

It was late (~4pm), and Route 66 apparently does not put time limitations on its brunch. I ordered the eggs florentine, and they were among the top five I've ever had - no joke! The poached eggs were prepared perfectly, and the spinach was well seasoned with dill and other herbs. The potatoes were done nicely. You get a coffee and an alcoholic drink with the brunch, and the bloody mary was really delicious - nice and spicy with a decent amount of vodka. All for under $12.

IMO, walk fifteen minutes south on Ninth to Burgers and Cupcakes for a much cheaper experience, or to 45th and Ninth for an experience of the same price but with a much higher calibre of meat.",3,,

Shortly after leaving the restaurant, I crossed the street and had to run into a nail salon as I was overcame with nausea. I vomited my entire meal and began to shake. After waking up from this, I phoned and talked to the manager and she just apologized and dismissed it..I was trying to tell him not to serve this and I eat out all the time and never become so violently ill like this..and he quickly hung up the phone. If you do go to this place, just walk by the kitchen which is directly next to the bathrooms, which are not 100% either.

The Staff: Friendly and accommodating.Food: The food here is better than your average casual eatery and the portions are a decent size for the price.The entrees come with a soup or salad and they have several burger type options. ( I confess to a weakness for burgers.)My last visit I decided to go nonburger and have herb chicken with garlic mashed potatoes & steamed brocolli.

It was so quiet, totally dead, which makes it surprising that it's open all night.They serve the standard American diner fare, and I went with the chicken quesadilla.

I came by here around 3:00pm today.Even though I've seen the bad rating for this place, but decided to give them a try anyways. I would have gave them a 5 star rating, but there were two bad things that caught my attention and are worth mentioning. Let me start with the pros first:First off, the service was great. Well, you have to take into consideration that there was only me and my friend, and this other couple of people, so they were not busy at all. Anyways, our waiter was nice and attentive. The first time our waiter approached, she asked if we would like something to drink. Me and my friend both said water. Within I would say, 5-6 seconds, they brought the water to our table. She consistently came back and asked us if we needed anything and if everything is alright. They have two flat-screen tv's - one at the bar and one by the front door. I'm not sure if you can request to change the channel or not - I'll look into that next time I go. I ordered Buffalo Wings, which comes with 7 wings and a side of bleu cheese. My friend ordered a Grill Chicken Ceasar Salad. I don't eat salad, but when I saw her salad, I wanted some. Can you believe she actually complained that they gave her too much grill chicken slices!? The decor looked nice. They had outside sitting today due to the warm weather, but we sat inside. The environment inside was nice and calm.Now on to the negatives. One negative was, there was something in my friend's glass of water. It looked like a chunk of food floating at the top of the glass. That's nasty, and she had already taken a sip too. We of course had that glass of water replaced. The second negative was that one of my wings were cold!...and it was the first one that I tasted too. I finished the first wing in hope of the rest of the wings being hot, because if they were not, there was going to be a problem. I picked up the second wing and felt it was hot; from then on I knew everything was going to be alright. Those are the only two negatives I had and they are the reason there was no 5 star rating given by me. I still recommend trying this place out.",3,3,1
