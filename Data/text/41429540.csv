Has a large variety of coffee and other beverages as well as pastries and food. First at this establishment and I only had a coffee and croissant. The coffee was incredible, but the croissant was probably the best I've ever had.",
1,,10/2/2018,146,,"Manhattan, NY",Sonya W.,71,2.0,59,"It was just a decent experience, less than average. Service: 2/5; food: 3/5; drinks: 3/5Me and my boyfriend trief ordering like 3 sandwiches but apparently they were sold out. While ordering the lady on the counter was just upright rude. She didn't even let me email or text my receipt. Her coworker also made my drink wrong. When I got my iced chai latte I was presented with a hot chai latte so they had to remake it. The chai was really not that impressive but it was different in that it was milkier. There wasn't much chai taste in it. It was a really short experience but yet I felt so many things. I don't even know what to say except for disappointed. Incredibly disappointed. The place did look pretty though, that's all I can say.",1
2,,8/25/2018,484,,"Jersey City, NJ",May C.,591,3.0,663,"My husband and I were going to a venue close by and since we were early, we decided to pop in here for some food. When you walk in, you automatically smell the aroma of coffee and pastries. It was so nice and inviting. The organization of the place though is a hot mess. The cash register is so close to the door that if there's more than 3 people waiting to order, the line is already out the door. If you move over to the right, you'll be in the way of people and the seating area. There's also no clear sign that says where you can pick up your beverage/food, so if you're not dining in, it's awkward not knowing where to stand (and there aren't many places to stand!). They do have two picnic tables to the right of the entrance, but they don't fit too many people. There's limited seating towards the back of the cafe and the walkway is very narrow. Anyway, once we finally figured out the place, I ordered an almond croissant, an iced chai and my husband ordered the cuban sandwich. Altogether we paid $21, which is pretty steep in my opinion. My almond croissant was a bit on the heavier side. The croissant was very dense and wasn't as flaky as I would like it. The iced chai was pretty good though. My husband enjoyed his cuban sandwich, but it's quite small for $10. He pretty much left the place slightly less hungry than before.Overall, it's a cute coffee shop, but I don't think the prices justify coming here often. If I'm in the area, I'll pop in. If not, there are other coffee shops to visit.",

Looks like a nice casual place, with wooden benches around for you to chill out and work while sipping coffee. Service is quite fast. I ordered the cortado, well made, strong enough with very fresh smell and flavors. They do have extensive menu for breakfast with a variety of different sandwiches. Stop by for a coffee if you are in the area!",5
4,,7/24/2018,201,,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",Nicholas C.,584,3.0,204,"I had the opportunity to visit Ground Support for the first time while grabbing coffee with a friend on a Saturday in Soho. We had planned to check out an art exhibit nearby and thought this would be an ideal spot to enjoy some cold brew beforehand.The space itself is really interesting! When you walk in you instantly notice the long wooden picnic tables set up for customers to sit at. They also have pretty standard beverage choices, along with a variety of food options to choose from. So if you're just looking to grab a cup of coffee or enjoy a full meal this place seems good for both.My friend and I ordered our ice coffees ($4) and actually opted to sit at a bar they have that's located towards the back of the space. There's natural lighting that makes it's way into the cafe which was also really great too. Even though we were more towards the back we didn't feel like we were ""in the back"" so to say.The only issue I have with this place is their restroom. There's only one, and it's located all the way in the back in between the staff's private section and the trash disposal closet. Also, it was pretty dirty when I used it so that was in itself a really off putting experience.Overall a decent coffee shop where you could either do work, catch up with a friend, or enjoy what looks like a decent meal! I might just try and use the restroom elsewhere if you really have to.",1

My friend works in the area so he'd been here a lot and said I should try it out, so we did. I got the cold drip coffee, and he got a chai latte - I liked the cold drip coffee ($3), taste was pretty strong and did the job. Friend liked his chai latte (I'm not a fan of chai, so don't really know if it was good or not). There is a decent amount of seating for SoHo, but still not enough for all the people trying to sit/chat and grab coffee or sit and stay a while to study or work. Friend and I wanted to sit and stay, but it was a little too busy for us to focus on our conversation so we decided to grab and go instead. Solid place, fast service, good coffee, bustling place good for grab and go coffees.",2

This place looks like it's the bees knees with the crowd who comes in.I was just there to kill time while my students were out and about shopping til they drop in SoHo. Pretty good chai latte, a little too foamy than what I'm used too but hey, still good. Also loving the custom stamp on the simple white cup to brand the store. Only minus 1 star cause the cashier looked bothered from us. Maybe caught him on an off day and bc it was super cold out?!",1
7,1,7/28/2018,340,1,"Berkeley, CA",Jane L.,136,5.0,86,"First time in SoHo, and this coffee place had very unique drinks for the summer. One of them was similar to Starbucks frappucino, but much less sweet and more coffee flavor, almost closer to melted coffee ice cream (minus the creamy taste), and the other one was matcha and lemonade blended. I am not sure if these types of drinks are common throughout NY, but was great experience for me, and was a great coffee break in the middle of humid and hot summer day :)",1
8,,4/12/2018,107,1,"Watertown, CT",Victoria T.,416,5.0,79,"I only nipped into Ground Support quickly but I fell in love. First, it is surprisingly hard to find a good chill coffee shop in Soho, probably because the rent is Chanel & Louis-worthy and therefore precludes the humble cafe. Second, the inside is adorably airy and relaxed, with a lot of natural light and shabby chic vibes. It is a very popular nomad workstation so to take into account if you want a seat or are one yourself! Third, the barista gave me a latte with two kissing swans!! And said he wanted it to match my outfit, which is the sweetest thing I've heard lately. And fourth, when I posted the latte to my Insta, the coffee shop reached out to thank me and we had a great chat. Fifth, I then found out they refuse to post foodporn and only post photos of visiting dogs to their company IG. I'm totally charmed. If I could marry a coffee shop, I would. Swipe right on Ground Support if you're in Soho!",1
9,2,9/10/2018,2501,2,"Manhattan, NY",Yan T.,228,4.0,1708,"Great cup of artisanal joe here. Probably the best specialty coffee shop in SoHo and they've been around awhile. There's plenty of comfortable seating, free WiFi, and a friendly staff. Certainly a notch above Starbucks and a refuge from the shopping hordes a few blocks east.",4
10,2,2/8/2018,484,,"San Francisco, CA",Christine W.,169,4.0,166,"Coffee shops in SoHo are pretty much my favorite thing ever because each one is so unique -- and Ground Support definitely reaffirmed that idea. I came in on a weekday around 4PM and grabbed the coveted bench facing out the window. It was great pulling out my laptop, typing away, and looking up every once in awhile to people watch New Yorkers walking by all bundled up in their fashionable winter wear. Once my laptop started dying though, I struggled a bit to find an outlet as they're quite scarce and the cafe was crowded with people. Once people started clearing out, I was able to scout one out behind one of the benches by the walls. The seating there wasn't as comfortable but hey, it's an outlet. I got the chai latte and it was a nice treat for a frosty winter day. The latte itself wasn't anything special but it did the trick. Ultimately, a great place for working but come with your laptop charged just in case!",2
11,,4/1/2018,224,,"Seattle, WA",Sarah C.,1064,5.0,129,"This is one of my favorite cafes in NYC! Not only do they have amazing coffee but also delicious paninis! My go-to panini is the Cuban. I actually haven't gotten around to try any of the other ones because I keep coming back to order this one again! Everything is fresh and made to order. If you're ever in soho and need an afternoon coffee pick me up or a quick lunch, definitely check out this place!",

You might have to share a table with other people but there's plenty of room. I love that there's plenty of natural light throughout the place. It's really pleasant.My cappuccino was pretty good too.I didn't try the food, but the menu consists of several sandwiches and (a single) salad. There are also a few pastries available.",
14,,11/8/2018,112,,"Burnsville, MN",Laura C.,0,5.0,1,Their homemade almond milk is amazing!! I tried the overnight oats as well and will order again! Delicious!,
15,1,6/8/2018,322,,"Boca Raton, FL",Kaitlyn M.,61,3.0,50,"This place has a great location and a cute interior. However there is limited seating, and I'm not a huge fan of the communal tables. The iced dirty chai was fantastic, but the regular coffee was so so. I ordered a breakfast sandwich which tasted good but was overly oily and greasy (probably due to the sausage), but it ended up giving me a stomachache.... I'm going to chalk it up to the oil?",2
16,,11/11/2018,2,,"New York, NY",Alex A.,0,5.0,20,It was a cold day and I was in the mood for a hot cup of coffee but not the Starbucks (bitter) or DD (weak) kind. I wanted something delicious and fresh. I absolutely found that here. I must say this coffee is the best I've had in a long time. Freshly ground and just the right amount of kick. They have homemade almond milk and fresh local milk for those who prefer their coffee that way. They have small sandwiches available if your in the mood for it. It tends to get crowded and you do have to wait a bit for your coffee so if your in a rush this may not be the place for you. But in my opinion it's definitely worth the wait.,
17,,3/19/2018,47,,"New York, NY",Brandon P.,11,2.0,68,"An oldie, but not a goodie.  I've been to ground support on and off for the past five years and unfortunately, it no longer stacks up to other options.Seating: this is a pretty small cafe with limited seating. All of the tables are a bit creaky and old, and it's pretty difficult to get a good seat.Internet: if you're coming yo get work done, turn away!  The internet is known to be very bad -- and it disappoints every time I have visited.Ambience: It's quaint and feels like a small cafe. But it's too loud and crowded that it's not a great place to stay for awhile.I can't comment on the food (coffee is okay, sometimes burnt) but I'd say it's not worth a visit.",1
18,,7/26/2018,12,,"San Francisco, CA",John L.,1,3.0,182,"I got a Cuban sandwich for lunch. It was okay. A little greasy, with not enough pickles and far too many grilled-to-no-flavor vegetables. It came in excessive packaging (a three-layer extravaganza of paper, tin foil, and wax paper).",
19,,7/8/2018,349,,"Philadelphia, PA",Wendy S.,70,3.0,74,"If you are thinking of doing work here, abort. Oh man, I am so disappointed that I didn't enjoy this place at all :/ I found this cafe on a list online for ""best coffee shops to get work done"", and I am someone that if I need to get work done, I will block out an entire 8 hours to be at a coffee shop to get it done. And today was one of those days. But the WiFi at the cafe was so spotty - I can not even download a zip file and it takes up to a minute to load a page. During peak hours around 2pm, the entire place is packed with people. There is so little seating that people are having full on conversations just standing around in the coffee shop. I think the WiFi is also dependent on how many people were using it, it literally just stopped working. I looked over to the lady next to me, her pages were also not loading, and I had to leave to go to a Starbucks to finish my tasks. The coffee and bagel were alright, but this is NOT a place to work if that's what you are looking for.",
20,1,6/17/2017,875,,"San Francisco, CA",Sherry L.,813,3.0,1146,"Not my favorite coffee shop. My friend recommended it because she had been there before and said that she'd enjoyed the ambiance and the coffee. Maybe they were having an off day when I visited, but I found the baristas slow and the internet shoddy. It was so shoddy as to not be available at all! When my friend went up to the counter to ask about the internet, we were told to move to the back of the cafe for better service (where there were no seats).The macchiato that I ordered was nice and strong, but it took about 15 minutes to prepare - I was watching the clock because I was due for an appointment but had ordered a macchiato to stay because I thought I would have at least 30-40 minutes to enjoy it as I studied. Unfortunately, I had to down my drink almost as soon as I got it because it took so long. I might give them another try if I'm in the area, but given the plenty of other options, this will be a hard sell.",4
21,3,4/16/2018,136,,"New York, NY",Mallory M.,11,5.0,94,"As good as overpriced coffee can get. They have numerous milk choices and a full food menu. Plenty of seats, which is super hard to find in any NY coffee shop. There are a few long tables in the front of the store and two in the back. Also there is bar seating. Yes--there is wifi! I still don't understand coffee shops that don't have wifi, obviously they're not down to have customers spending hours in their small square-footed store. There are many windows, allowing light to peak through, even on rainy days. Definitely a good work/study place. The music isn't overpowering either, which is another hard shark",
22,,4/29/2018,1,,"Bay Shore, NY",Marissa C.,4,5.0,13,Every time I'm in Soho I make it my mission to stop in and get a cup a coffee along with their grilled cheese sandwich.

24,1,1/23/2017,212,2,"Dumbo, NY",Julianne B.,418,3.0,173,"Not a bad place to hang out and get some work done. Low key background music, relatively soft spoken crowds, and reliable wifi (at least so far!) there are picnic tables and a few benches throughout so it isn't cozy, but there is plenty of seating squeezed into a small space. I was hoping for a fun latte but their only latte flavors are mocha and honey. I ordered the honey latte from the disgruntled man at the front. The baristas are all friendly and working away. They made the latte quickly and always seemed busy in the back. The latte was made well, with light frothy milk and a pretty heart design.  I was underwhelmed by the honey flavor or lack there of. I couldn't really taste anything which was disappointing considering it was $ 5.75 for a medium.",1

27,,6/27/2017,296,1,"New York, NY",Alma W.,129,3.0,95,"While the vibe of Ground Support exceeds my expectations for a coffee shop, the pricey and only okay quality drinks made for a disappointment. The coffeeshop meets industrial decor with benches (seating available both times I've come here!) and music playing offer so much to fawn over. It's not a large cafe, but there's a substantial amount of seating and some outdoors seating on nice days. There was a healthy mix of people chatting and people working and those just getting coffee to go so I was excited to try my drink.Unfortunately that's where this review gets sad. The first time I came here I ordered a cold brew, which took 10 minutes and reminding the barista I had ordered it to finally get, and a very ice heavy cold brew and not that strong tasting cold brew at that. The second time I ordered a iced matcha latte with almond milk, which came to a hefty $6 total. CRAZY. For that price the matcha latte was not worthwhile. It was slightly above average with a distinct matcha taste, but the drink had too much ice and seemed a touch watered down. I enjoyed it, but would not be willing to pay for it again. On the plus side I had a pleasant time reading a book here during the visit I got the matcha latte. The menu also has pastries and sandwiches (~$10 ea) that generally dominate the chalkboard. I stared at the board for a good five minutes to find the coffee section (it's in the top left corner btw). Of the limited options, don't get what I got.",

52,,8/20/2017,1,,"Austin, TX",Nick S.,42,1.0,10,"Unequivocally the rudest register loiterer I've ever met. I walked in (after having frequented the joint from the first day it opened) this guy short and dumpy with a patchy beard and sweat stained baseball cap has the worst customer service manners I've encountered. The manager who hired him should reconsider. Normally I wouldn't be so specific in my description and perhaps a little more tactful but trying to come up with a polite description is quite difficult when the guy was just a dick.The problem here is his attitude and lack of manners and etiquette for their clients. I didn't know where to stand when ordering the coffee as the guy never noticed me then another customer came in who stood next to me and served him instead. Clearly I was ready and wanted a coffee, that's what most people want on a Sunday morning in NYC. I asked him 'oh, this is the line here' it was a foot to my left, he still ignored me so I left. As I was leaving he finally spoke to me 'have a nice day', I'll go get coffee some place else I said, again, 'have a nice day', I told him no need to be an asshole, and again from him 'have a nice day'. Amazing how one can open up and be a real asshole all the while he could have just said hi and taken my order.After this encounter, coffee and panini lovers really need to think ahead and ask themselves just how much of a nice day would you like?I'll take my nice day some place else and have it too. Along with my friends who used to eat and drink there. I think it would be much easier just to say 'hi, what can I getcha'!Have a nice day indeed.",

I left at the point where it didn't connect anymore at all. And it might be a personal thing, but I felt like the AC was on pretty strong, so I had my jacket & scarf on all the time.

Today, I order a regular matcha latte.... And maybe it comes with almond milk normally? Or I look like an almond milk kind of girl? (I've been told this, and to be fair I usually am). Just didn't want it today with this pairing. Anyway, definitely not an authentic Japanese matcha, which I didn't expect anyway. However, because it's on the lighter side in terms of flavor, it really just ended up being an almond milk latte with a mint green tint. No hint of matcha flavor anywhere below or in the foam. I searched. Pretty, but not particularly amazingly tasty and costed me extra. I've had their cappuccinos/lattes many a times and loved em. So maybe just stick to the basics. I will say, the latte and cappuccino have the same amount of foam... So I really feel like I'm getting the signature almond milk latte with every espresso drink i order... Which is the slight issue. It tastes fantastic though!Would love to try their food... I got a little tinge of cafe food envy while sitting down and writing this review. They have wifi, log wooden benches with picnic tables.

Some tourists came in and they were beyond rude to them because they didn't speak English very well. The guy at the register rolled his eyes at them multiple times and was very aggressive towards them. Maybe he was having a bad day, but that's no way to act towards a customer. He was not rude to me so I decided to give here another try since it's close to my work. I got a matcha latte this time, which tasted like warm milk (no matcha flavor). I went back asking for a new drink because I was not satisfied with my $5 cup of warm milk, which I felt like I was in the right. I even had my friend try it and she agreed that it didn't taste like matcha. The guy at the register was very rude and told me it was ceremonial grade. Sure it might have been, but it clearly wasn't made properly. I asked if I could get a regular coffee and he obliged. After, the girl and guy making the coffee asked me if I've ever had matcha before. Well, yes sir, I have many times before, which is how I knew it tasted gross. Matcha happens to be my preferred choice of drink. He proceeded to tell me that the matcha cost $500 a pound, which adds more to the fact that perhaps it wasn't made right more than the actual matcha. If it was that expensive, you would think that's you'd have more respect for the matcha. After this, they kept talking and laughing at me behind the counter as I was standing in front of them. All around rude service for coffee that is ""so-so"". Gave them another shot, but definitely will not be coming back.",1

Ground Support has rave reviews on Yelp, so I thought this would be good. After all, I don't have high expectations - available seating & outlets, decent drinks, a good work ambiance and reliable wifi. Unfortunately, Ground Support only checks one of those boxes (yep, available seating & outlets on a weekday afternoon). I quickly skimmed the drinks menu; I don't drink coffee and I didn't want to pay $3 for a tea bag in hot water, so I opted for the very interesting-sounding turmeric latte ($6), their special. I was pretty excited for it because I really like the turmeric milk that my roommate makes. I almost spit it out after my first sip; all I got was a thick, spicy foam. After swirling it around cautiously for a while, I tried it again, but I realized it wasn't just the foam: the whole drink was a liquid form of cayenne pepper. I saw the sprinkling of pink peppercorn on top and the lovely yellow of turmeric, but I didn't taste any other flavor. It was completely unpalatable - no sugar whatsoever to offset the pure cayenne. I was initially shocked that they would sell a drink like this, but then I realized that I was in Soho and who knows what hipsters drink? I dismissed it as the price for studying in a coffeeshop in Soho, and continued studying. After some time, I started hearing some pretty loud, obnoxious conversation. I looked around, wondering who could be doing this, and realized that it was the baristas. I was able to ignore the beginning of it (""How much would you have to be paid to eat 27 hot dogs?"") and chalked it down to bored teens. A few minutes later, however, this devolved into ""How much would you have to be paid to push an old lady in a wheelchair down the stairs?"" and variations on the theme. I know it's just a hypothetical situation, and maybe I am an oversensitive med student, but I thought this was completely inappropriate (especially in a public setting where they're working). Coincidentally, one of my friends texted me about a practice question on elder abuse. :( They stopped talking after a while and I actually did study there for the most part in peace, but this left a sour taste in my mouth (in addition to the disgusting drink). It was also 60 degrees outside and all the doors were open. I guess I'm also overly cold sensitive because everyone else seemed to be fine. I kept my coat on. The wifi was okay in the beginning; I don't need super fast wifi for doing UWorld questions, but I do need working wifi. It started going in and out after an hour or so (still okay for my purposes), and it sputtered out completely eventually. It was the last straw. I left. Definitely not coming back.",3

Her response was to continue to stare right into my eyes and simply point her thumb right behind her. I asked her ""what does that mean?"" And she emphatically continued to shove her thumb pointing behind her where there was nothing but some dishes. I ask her ""why are you pointing at dishes?"". The barista then turns around, realizes her mistake, and then leans over stares right into my eyes and points in a different direction. This time in the direction of where I can fill up my own cup of tap water. And finally I have to wait about 15 minutes for my black coffee which was not served to me.

I've seen people do it, but I don't think this is a spot where you can jam pack a 3-4 hour study session because: 1. The wooden seats and tables are not comfortable. And a lot of the seating arrangements are communal, so you'll find yourself fighting for desk space or lodged in a corner seat, holding in your pee, after you've downed a cup of coffee. 2. Regardless of what time you get there, it's loud. It's always packed with Soho-esque people aka aspiring models and hipsters. It's a good looking crowd, admittedly.So, this isn't the spot to go to if you want to study or to have some serious down-time with a book. It's a very lively and social spot.

I asked for a sandwich without cheese but he told me they were pre-made so he couldn't do that even though there were 8 people behind the counter and I could see that they were currently making sandwiches in the back. I guess it just slows down the whole process they have going on so I was totally okay with that.My girlfriend asks a guy who was just standing around if she could get some half-and-half, and he answers in a super sarcastic and condescending tone, ""you see those little pitchers over there? yeah, it's in there."" Hey buddy, as much as I respect a well made cup of coffee, you pour hot water on beans, let's be real here. There's no need to be so snarky.I'm really tempted to give them one star but their coffee is good. The iced coffee I got was on the lighter, fruity side and was not watered down or lacking flavor. The ham and Gruyere sandwich my girlfriend got was really good as well. Prices are on par with everything else in the area.If you can put up with the impudent customer service, this is a decent place to get your coffee and sandwich fix. I'll be taking my money elsewhere because they clearly don't value it. The La Colombe on Lafayette near Prince is just as efficient, serves just as good coffee if not better, and while they may not be friendly, they're not blatantly rude.",3

West Broadway is like a runway for all the stylish and oddities of New Yorkers. As for their coffee, they hit the spot. Not sure which brand of beans they use but it is smooth and strong.

Definitely ample seating room regardless of the time of day. you'll notice when you find a seat; its got just the right amount of buffer between each seat which gives you a warm lively coffee shop feel yet it doesn't feel crowded. This is also a great spot to come alone because they have this park bench facing the front window looking outside.

Beautiful and hip Sohoians/tourists in and out. I definitely saw many people pop their heads in the back area to just sigh and realize they weren't going to get a seat at this popular cafe. You definitely pay for the location. The $3 redeye was great and strong. No complaints. The Veggie Sandwich was delicious but for the 9.50 price tag it could have used more of that cauliflower, cabbage and goat or was it feta cheese (served cold).

Coming from San Francisco, where my standards are high and my caffeine-withdrawal headache was bad from drinking bodega brown piss-water for three days, I was in bad need of something good. I'm sorry to say my experience here was nothing special.I got a large black coffee, which in my opinion is a great litmus test for the quality of a place's cup of joe.  Again, nothing special. I could have gone to Starbucks and had a dark roast of equal quality. I also had an almond croissant which was dry and crunchy; mediocre at best. I didn't try the espresso drinks, which are well reviewed and did look good.  Another thing is my drink was served in a paper cup which was disappointing because I wanted to drink my coffee there and other people were drinking out of ceramic mugs. The service was fine, but I would have appreciated being asked if my coffee was for there or to go so a cup wasn't wasted.Bottom line: New York, you are an amazing city with amazing food, amazing people and amazing  culture.  Get your coffee act together and stop drinking the Budweiser equivalent of coffee.

They have long wooden benches or a counter you can sit at to relax and enjoy your coffee. Mine was brought to me and had pretty latte art on it.

It's off the more foot traffic filled blocks in soho and has benches out front to sit and take a break. Inside is a pleasing sitting area of all park style benches. Past this it really fails.     Millennials really occupy the shop. It'll be hard to find a seat that isn't taken by someone on their Apple macbook that will likely not move for another hour and has probably been sitting for an hour already.      Mixed reviews on yelp were stating the staff is rude. Well it's true. I ordered a turkey sandwhich that sounded especially appetizing. Got it and my coffee (which is nothing special) and sat down. It was stale. And I could tell by just touching it, but I dove in anyway. The best comparison to what I must have looked like to the girl across from me is a dog pulling on one of those rope toys with its owner on the other end. I'm writing this review an hour later and my teeth still ache. Breaking the bread was a workout and once I got to the chips on the sandwhich I decided to say something. They were more stale than the bread. So I knew it wasn't fresh. Here comes the staff interaction.     I politely went out of my way to get the original server who rung me up. I asked if the sandwhiches were made fresh and let him know that I couldn't bite through the bread and told him the chips were stale too. He arrogantly said they are made fresh and that the bread is delivered daily, that it's a ""rustic baguette"". And that's why its hard. Thanks for your bulls**it but I'm an adult and I know when bread is stale. He conveniently ignored the chip part. His attitude was as if I personally physically harmed him. I was at a loss what to do so I sat back down. Him and the staff then proceeded to snicker and comment about me as if I wasn't four feet away facing them for the remainder of my time sitting. Maybe I'm just caught in a twilight zone episode where businesses can be as awful as they want to their patrons.      This place will continue to do well with the millennials pouring in and out but I should have checked yelp to see the other similar situational reviews before I walked in and wasted 16 dollars.
