Music was perfect as well, we all were commenting on how perfect it was for the space. As for the drinks, I messed up and ordered the Smoke + Dagger not realizing how spicy the Anchor Reyes Verde actually was. Combined with the ginger, it was disgusting lol. Basically sucked it down asap so I could move on to something else. ‍Otherwise, no problems and staff were helpful and friendly, and clean bathrooms.Give this joint a shot, but if you don't know what an ingredient is, definitely look it up lol.",1
1,,6/1/2018,3,,"Kearny, NJ",Alvin Z.,8,1.0,9,"This bar is poorly managed. I waited in line for 30 minutes to only be rejected by a women bouncer with black hair and dark skin color on June 2nd at 1am (the date and time is specified to single out the person working out front). She told us we had to ""leave the line"" because ""we're clearing out the line"", ""this bar is too packed"". We were the only ones to be told to leave the line..I felt discriminated, not sure if it was because of my race or gender, but a group of guys behind us went in shortly after. This review isn't a a review to sway anyone from this bar - it's purpose is to inform the consumers and to spend money at an establishment that purposeful.Also, a male bouncer (worked at the same date and time) with dark skin (who claims to not know the owner) claimed I was discriminated because of my race (he was clueless of the situation and this was the first thing he brought up). He also mentioned that ""new york bar tends to pick and choose who they let in"".Hopefully this doesn't happen to you..",3
2,,11/10/2018,4,,"San Francisco, CA",Nisha D.,0,1.0,14,"UNACCEPTABLE AND UNFAIR. My friends and I came to blind barber at 12:30 on a Saturday night. There was only a small line and we decided to wait in 30 degree weather. There was a group of about 10 white blonde females in front of us. We all had to wait for a bit but then the group in front of us got in and we were next. We said we had a group of 9 (half girls half guys) and they refused to let us in. They used capacity as an excuse. We said we're more than happy to wait in line and have one to two of us go in as capacity opens up. We are all adults who understand how capacity works. As we watched many people come out of the bar, they let certain people in but not us. We asked why and they said they didn't feel comfortable. We asked if they thought we were drunk and they said no..because we weren't. But they never gave us an answer - they simply just didn't let us in. They wouldn't let us wait in line and continued to let others behind us in. We will never be going back and you shouldn't either if you don't want to deal with absolute idiocracy. It is crowded and they are just looking for an excuse for people to buy tables which btw don't exist (there's hardly room to move inside) - I know because I've been like 5 times. So it's basically a scam and there are a 100 other places to go in NY as they said in their own words - ""there are so many other bars to go to just like ours"". DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.",

I'd like to say I love most (all) bars, but this is not the case. The music was weird, and the people were even weirder. If you've never been to New York, are from a tech start up,  and are looking to have an ""authentic"" city slicker experience then sure, this is your place. Also, lets chat music. The music was strictly 80s weird techno except for the one time they played ""Thank You Next"" by Ariana Grande and ""Uptown Funk"" by Bruno.

When they did open up, I ordered a cocktail expecting it to be part of the happy hour special price. When the check arrived I was disappointed to see it was full cost. Have no idea why and felt bad asking cause they weren't kind enough to explain anything to us. Didn't feel like other speakeasies I've been to where service is held to a higher standard than a typical bar. My drink was good: I ordered the Batman, but this too, wasn't as amazing as most other speakeasy cocktails I've had, where I've said ""wow, this is phenomenal.""",

I give the company 5 stars for everything they are about and how management strives to make you happy while being reasonable. 3 stars for my technician...it wasn't bad but it wasn't great. The guy behind the chair was funny, sharp, and quick but a bit rough to the touch with me. Pretty decent result after I had him adjust it a little before I left. The guy said he had been doing hair for awhile and I believe in his talent, but I personally think he could use more professional training. Overall I'd recommend this place for sure.

Basically, it's a barber shop that you have to go through before you get to the bar. How freaking cool is that?! Such a hidden place that's chilled out and awesome to hang with friends on a night out in the village. Not super fancy, but very spacious with a huge bar and lots of seats and historic pictures. Gotta love it!We missed the happy hour unfortunately cause we arrived a little after 8ish on a Thursday evening.They had some fancy cocktail for $14 which is pretty decent for the area. I stayed neutral and had two glasses of wine - cost around $7/each.The music was really happening, I didn't find it that loud, but definitely can have a discussion and manage to do some dance moves in between.Overall great speakeasy bar!",7

It's not hidden that well and you can see the door obviously sliding through the windows. The place was surprisingly spacious and even has a cute back library area. There are a decent variety of cocktails for $14 each, but we were there during happy hour (until 9pm), so they were only $9 each! What a steal for a speakeasy type place!! I really enjoyed my cocktail (forget what it's called) but has mezcal, tequila, ginger, and cinnamon. I ended up getting two. My friend and I were able to get a large cozy booth to ourselves, but I think it was less crowded that day because it was pouring rain. Main critique is that there were only 2 bartenders working, so it took forever to get our drinks. Everyone was gathered around the bar trying to order drinks. But overall, yummy cocktails, great price during happy hour, and fun speakeasy atmosphere.",

Came here with some friends awhile back and had a great time! Drinks were great with knowledgable attentive bartenders whom whipped something up. Not sure what we order but I do remember this one particular bartender took his time with us (sorry didn't catch your name otherwise I shout you out!) Typical bartender just want to make what you order, get paid and then onto the next. Only one complaint extra ventilation/air. It does get pretty steamy in there when the place is packed back to back.Great selection of music!",13
15,,3/5/2018,5,3,"New York, NY",Sangeeta K.,8,1.0,42,"As much as I want to like this place, I felt threatened for safety at this bar. My friend who is short and skinny got pushed down the stairs toward the restroom for no apparent reason by a bulky, arrogant (potentially high) bouncer who thought he could just hit the patrons at the bar. When confronted for why he did so, he refused to engage with us. My friend incurred neck and head injuries and now we plan to sue this place for physical assault.Also the bartender charged a 20% gratuity on the bar tab and expected us to tip on top of it.If you care for your safety, stay away from this place. We will definitely NEVER set foot in this shop again.",9

As soon as you get to the location, the ""barbershop"" lights are off with candles inside and the door opened.. as you walk in, you walk straight through another open door that leads you to the bar/lounge area. Dropped in on an empty night, ordered some drinks that were not so much to my liking and a little weak on the liquor. Dark inside so reading the menu was a bit difficult, but I guess that's part of the speakeasy feel. Skip the bar and lounge in front..towards the back, pass the bathroom is a quiet intimate space.. SIT THERE! Regular radio music when I went, and a bit dull but I'd like to see what a busy night looks like.",

Loved the Strawberry Fields drink when I was looking for something more like food than alcohol haha..it was absolutely delicious - smelled like fresh mint and strawberries and tasted like a confiture ^^Also, it's a speakeasy but pretty straightforward to get in to - just ask the guy out front, and if it's not too busy of a night you should be set (although it may still not hold true for a large group of guys - not too sure on that). Overall very friendly vibe though, we even got complimented as a gorgeous couple by the bouncer/doorman on the way in [when I went years ago]! ^.^",1

21,,12/8/2016,842,,"New York, NY",Lissette C.,42,5.0,105,"If you know me, this is one of my favorite places in the East Village, ABC, LES area. I've been coming here for more than 3 years, before I even lived in NYC. Now, I can't think of a weekend where I don't at least 'end up' here. First of all, it's got such a cool entrance (speakeasy) so it's definitely different from other things you may have done in the past. Once you're in, the vibe feels very cozy. Drinks are mid-range and pretty average for New York City, and they're definitely strong. It's usually pretty packed after 10 p.m. and it's definitely one of those places where you might run into the same people - usually mid to late 20s. Everyone here is generally friendly, stylish, and really just here to have a good time. It also helps that the DJ is usually really good - a blend of good mainstream music and lots of hip-hop. It's one of those places that you can go for dancing at the end of the night and have a great, no judgment-zone, time. I will definitely recommend getting there a little early if you don't like the big crowds or lines, or coming toward the end of your night. This will remain one of my favorite places in the city because it's so ""home-y"" and I totally recommend you give it a chance!Oh - and if you came here for reviews on a haircut - these guys are some of the best. Check out their Instagram pages for proof.",2

26,,4/23/2017,382,,"New York, NY",Ashley N.,637,3.0,334,"Honestly, it's a hit or miss. I usually can only tolerate this place once I've been to a few other bars before. It's technically a speakeasy but there's a bouncer outside or usually a line getting in so the illusion of the speakeasy fades. I've only been here during weekends so it's always crowded and you can never get a seat. I've only been here for drinking too so I'm not actually sure if they have any food. The prices are a little overpriced for what you get and the drinks aren't really alcohol forward. It's a cool place to bring friends who have never been here but I think it loses its appeal after the second time. It's LES so there's a ton of other great and cheaper bars in the area.",3
27,1,10/15/2017,1,,"San Francisco, CA",M B.,4,1.0,37,"TLDR: Bartender thinks he's working at a speakeasy and causes obscene drink lines. This place is great. Great setup, ambience, and crowd. Most of the negative review comes from folks who don't do nightlife often and have improper expectations. The layout, music and scene is designed for an intriguing night out dancing with friends and meeting people.....except for the bar.....I've been here once a month for years. The bar is always a cluster. It's virtually impossible to get a drink, and it's due to one guy. There's a shaved head, African American bartender who takes upwards of 5-10 minutes *per* drink. This is a very, very busy place. This bartender appears to have the belief that he works at a speakeasy and not a party bar. I made the mistake of getting drinks here once, and when I went to close my tab, the wait was****45 MINUTES****I actually never made it to the bar. I had to go outside and ask a bouncer to help me close my tab.

Troy made it an experience with before and after photos and was careful to make sure I was getting exactly the hair cut I wanted. His cutting skills are top notch - in addition to the dozens of compliments I've gotten, people have commented that it's a very well done haircut and mentioned how I look a lot like (surprise, surprise) Ruby Rose. The vibe of the barbershop was completely comfortable. Even though it's a little pricey, I'm definitely going back to keep experimenting with awesome, creative short hair. Thank you so much Troy!",

The music choice was great when I was there this past Saturday, as it was all rap but not songs with ignorant lyrics. They player Russ, Kanye, some throwbacks like Soulja boy lol, but mostly quality music! The only reason why I won't give them a better rating is because one of their bar tenders was absolutely rude. My friend was there for his birthday and is from NJ and requested four whiskey shots and a beer for two separate tabs and the guy insisted that they have to be on one for no apparent reason. I said it was his birthday and the man didn't care, he proceeded to give us our drinks, not even pouring them into proper shot glasses.

I had scheduled a full cut, but since he was really just fixing a botched haircut from another place a few days ago, he only charged me for a trim (40% cheaper). Only issue I had was the payment process. For some weird reason they technically don't allow you to tip with card; you can only pay the list price of the cut with card. So your options are: bring cash or tip nothing. This is also odd because you step into the bar area to take care of payment, and when the bar is operating, you can tip with card when you buy drinks. Anyway, I talked the cashier into ""making an exception"" so that I wouldn't short change Troy, who did an excellent job.",

Dylan is absolutely perfect: I can walk in with a sketchy idea of how my hair should look and in about 30 minutes he's done it perfectly. Also, starting with a drink is a fantastic way to begin a conversation. The bar is pretty liberal with their pours and selection. It's actually a highlight of my month.",

Such a great concept and the place has great aesthetic - rustic but modern and just downright cool.Back bar gets hopping late at night. The bar was starting to fill up as of 11-11:30PM on the Sat night I was here. Comfy benches and booths to chill on but they do get reserved on most late nights.Music selection is good and cocktails are unique. Started with the 'Strawberry Fields' which was good - gave me that wanted buzz. Then I changed it up and had the 'Batman""... turned my night from good to awesome! Also got half off our first round of cocktails since we got there earlier in the evening :)Cool place! Can't wait to come back!",6

I mean you walk through a quaint little old fashioned barber shop to get into the actual bar and that's a really cool authentic speakeasy feel. I went on a Friday night around 12:30 and the place was PACKED like I mean I almost lost my friends the minute we walked in. It is incredibly dark, barely any light at all which I get is part of the speakeasy feel but just beware it's very easy to find yourself losing the people you're with. The section with the bar was very crowded but of course I persisted and made it over to grab a drink. Cocktails were $14..... I'm sorry but I've been to pretentious rooftop bars with cheaper prices. So I got a $7 Peroni instead. The bartender wasn't particularly nice and neither was the DJ. Asked for a song to be played and literally didn't even look at my friend and I. Anyway, it's not horrible but definitely wasn't exactly my cup of tea. Glad I went and saw what it was about, though.",2

I came here for my 25th birthday and had a great time with a group of friends. It's recommended to make reservations for large groups but I didn't and luckily got a table (I arrived before it got too busy, around 10ish). This place starts to approach full capacity around 11 but the DJ bumps good music so you could easily ignore the busy crowd and dance your pants off. Only downside to my experience was that there was only one bartender to serve everyone and ittook a while to get drinks. One of myFriends was smart and ordered 2 at once to avoid the wait again. I also expected better quality $14 cocktails from a speakeasy but I guess I'll come back during happy hour or at a less crowded time and hopefully get better speakeasy quality cocktails.",

Regardless, there was barely any dancing and those who did dance did not look right. Got a basic cranberry vodka for $10. As other reviewers mentioned, the bartender is SUPER slowwww insanely so.

I've had different bartenders in the past year that I've been coming here, and for some reason every time I order a drink, I get the feeling like I'm causing a huge inconvenience. The bartenders seem annoyed and brisk, and I get it, being in the service industry is not the easiest thing, it can be quite taxing, especially when dealing with alcohol.

It's off the beaten path a bit, so It wasn't as crowded as some of the other speakeasies in this area. We got into the Barber show and slide the door open to reveal a rustic bar space. The candles and wood made everything look like an old sepia photo. We got to the bar and grabbed a menu. They have a happy hour special from 6-9, so I suggest taking advantage. The cocktails run $13 normally, but the HH special put them at $8-10. The drinks were all good. I had the Sweeny Ted and Lacey Love (i think it was called that); I enjoyed both. Seating is definitely limited, so I suggest getting in early and grabbing a spot at the bar or in a booth. There were only 2 bartenders working, so drink wait can be long. If you can nab a spot near a bartender though, do it. They are true mixologists and it's really fun to watch them concoct everything.

Others may like that.Wasn't too speakeasy like with the door leading from the barber shop to the bar was constantly ajar, and at about 9-9:30pm, the bounce was stationed outside like it was a club.

He clearly remembered what my cut had looked like last time, offered a number of options for the back/sides that I hadn't considered, and was just all around great.

There was no line at that time of night but there were still bouncers at the door checking ID's and whatnot. Also, we did not pay any cover. The store front is an actual barber shop that you walk through and essentially enter a door at the back of that shop which takes you into a speakeasy. The back bar/speakeasy is fairly big in size. The bar is long and there are small circular booth-like tables to sit at. Although crowded, the bartenders were fairly attentive and I felt like it didn't take long to order drinks at the bar. I didn't order any fancy cocktails so I can't comment on the drinks (I'm a vodka-tonic girl...you really can't mess that up). What I really loved about this place was the music!! The DJ was playing 90's music, mostly hip hop, and it was AWESOME! Being in high school in the late 90's, my girlfriends and I knew every word to every song played that night!! The ambiance is cool and casual and the people there were dancing the night away. What's extra funny is that most of the people there were in their early 20's so no one else knew the words to the songs being played but they all still seemed to enjoy themselves....awesome haha. This place definitely made me realize how old I was but I STILL had fun so whatevs. This is definitely a fun bar to dance at with great music and even though I felt like an old lady here I would definitely come back for the amazing music. This place is great for groups of friends if you want a low key, casual night out.",
81,6,8/16/2015,860,8,"New York, NY",Molly T.,1415,3.0,443,"Reeeeally want to give Blind Barber four stars. But I can't. How do you run out of egg whites at a cocktail bar?? Especially at 10:30pm on a Saturday night. So I'm going with a solid 3.5 rating and rounding down because everyone should be able to experience the lovely experience that is egg white frothiness. This all said, Blind Barber is almost always a good time and when it DOES have all ingredients fully stocked, it boasts some tasty cocktails as well.I've been to Blind Barber maybe four times at this point--it's important to note that these visits have all been on the weekend, because it's apparently a drastically different scene during the week. Despite the fact that it can get packed, Blind Barber is by far the easiest speakeasy to get into in the area. Death + Co, Angel's Share, Attaboy--you might be waiting for hours. Part of this is because Blind Barber can accommodate more people, but I also think it's due to the type of scene you'll find here. Along with Bathtub Gin (Chelsea) and the Mulberry Project (SoHo), Blind Barber is loud and buzzing with energy as opposed to the cozy, romantic vibe you'll find at most speakeasies. Nothing wrong with this, just depends on what you're in the mood for. Blind Barber has two rooms--the larger space is conducive to mingling, dancing, schmoozing, etc. etc. The smaller one, which I've yet to find a seat in during my visits here, is where you can get more of an intimate experience. So there's a nice dichotomy here that you can take advantage of if it's not too busy.Now, for the drinks. I tried to order the ""Shiso Pretty"" (points for the name) on Saturday night, which is where I ran into the unfortunate egg white debacle (sounds like the title of a children's book, no?). Take two brought me face to face with the ""Smoke + Dagger"" (Jack Daniels, Jalepeño Infused Cointreau, Cucumber, Ginger, Lemon), which was quite enjoyable. I'm a huge fan of spicy drinks, so this baby had me at ""jalapeño"". It's far from the best drinks I've had at a speakeasy, but still a solid choice for a whiskey lover who likes drinks with a kick. I'll also note that the drinks here are actually reasonably priced. So if you want to get a speakeasy experience without drinking away your entire paycheck (this is possible, I assure you), give this place a try!",6

Unfortunately, our fun night came to a halt at BB, due to how rudely we were treated at the door. One of the companies that my company works with took a large group of us out for a night of fun - and a lot of drinking. We started the night with some food and fun, with a table waiting for us at BB when we were ready. We walked up to the door and stated the name that our reservation was under, to which the bouncer replied ""Who? I don't know that person."" without even checking the reservation list. He proceeded to give us a lot of grief, and the guy who had taken us even tried to tell him that we were his clients and he felt very embarrassed. The bouncer didn't budge, saying that we would need to wait until this person showed up - and eventually went back inside.We waited outside for quite a while until he finally came back outside, saying that we could go inside. He made all 18 of us look him in the eye as he told us the rules of the place, and if someone looked away he would stop talking and start over. I've never felt so disrespected and been treated so much like a child while waiting to get into a bar... They had a table reserved for 20+ people on a week night, and that's how we were treated???The rest of the night was a downer from there - I honestly didn't want to go in after that but I wanted to stay with the group. I decided not to order a drink because I really didn't feel like supporting a place that can be so rude.

I gotta say I was really bummed after going to the Blind Barber. I had the place targeted for awhile, heard good things and was excited to try it out. That being said they failed in several areas and not for the back room, I'd give it two stars. Lets start with the drinks. Terrible old fashioned. That's the cocktail I'll always get to judge their drinks by, I should have stopped there. The Moscow Mule, which they renamed to the Moscow Fool, was not as bad but still not what it should be. Overall the drinks were a major disappointment.The table we sat at had a near by couch which could not be used unless you wanted several springs trying to penetrate your ass. Maybe that's your thing, I'm not gonna judge. I get it, you want that old decor but the first obligation should be making your guests comfortable. Throw that shit out. The back room however is real cool. (Pictures attached above) Has that old school personal library vibe. I really enjoyed it. Giant mirrors, old paintings, clocks, books, plush seats and an old school television set. We just need an outdated globe. I'd come back if the backroom was available and during a happy hour, where I can have a crew to sit in the back with. Otherwise, you can talk with friends quite effortlessly at a different speakeasy.",13

DancingB. DrinkingC. Making outFrom that point the night went pretty much as stated. Music is great too since its mostly hip hop and a little bit of 90's too. Keep in mind this was on a weekend night.On a regular night, drinks are pretty standard fare depending on who you're comparing them to and you don't have to wait in line or make an advance reservation to get in.

Also be forewarned that the 100-some studio-style pics on yelp look nothing like what you'll see.Things started off great, with our party of 6 entering through the barbershop front and walking through to the back room but things got progressively less awesome from there.The place was packed, with only a couple couch type offerings available for the masses that were inside. This led to a hoard of people just standing around the cramped bar (the floorplan of the place leaves a lot to be desired). Once we were able to finally fight our way to the bar and squeeze in, we hadn't seen any drink menus so I asked one of the bartenders if they could make a Lions Tail and a fruity drink for the gf. Instead of acknowledging my existence with any words, the bartender handed over some drink menus. Alright, no problem. Our group decides our drinks, and many of the drinks required egg whites - cool, I always enjoy a nice frothy drink but when we placed our orders, bartender man says they only have 1 egg left - at 11PM on a Saturday? Out of eggs already? And half of your menu offerings incorporate egg whites?? what a shame. But we were not deterred! We chose new drinks and I again attempted to ask for a lions tail, which was not on the menu but I assumed any speakeasy bartender worth their salt would be able to whip up some sort of replacement. But alas, it would seem this particular bartender was not worth his salt and just salty - no lions tail, no explanation, no help, no nothing. the 4 drinks we did order took an hour and a day for him to make (okay maybe like 20 minutes and I understand they're all handmade but still. C'mon) and had a look on his face that made it seem that not only did he hate his job, but hated everyone around him.The drinks all turned out well enough but the crowdedness of the place plus the difficulty of ordering a drink meant that we stuck around for only one drink and then bounced. Maybe we just got unlucky on that particular night but the blind barber just didn't cut it for me (haha!).",

He brought me to the back room & gave me alcohol wipes & bandaids & made sure I was okay. He even gave me some extra bandaids for the road.

When I went, it happened to be a night a big group came for a birthday party, so the place got pretty crowded and loud quickly.I'd rate it somewhere between a 3 and a 4.

The interior was well-decorated, and provided an interesting backdrop. I ordered a Smoke and Dagger, and was pleasantly surprised to find that instead of the usual price of $13, it was just $7 because it was still happy hour!While sipping my drink I took in the ambience and let my mind wander, and thoroughly enjoyed my experience there.I'd definitely go back again, as long as it was early!",1

Fortunately for the owners of The Blind Barber, they smartly targeted New York's love for a lively, almost covert bar, rather than some bizarre affection for getting a haircut in the earliest hours of the morning.Once through the front door (and after 11:30 or so, that can take a while without a table reservation), guests head straight for a large sliding door in the back, guarded by yet another barber shop bouncer. Beyond here is the actual experience of The Blind Barber, complete with checkered floors, a brass bar, and a table in the far back surrounded by decked out bookcases. While this is the ideal table to buy with a group for an exceptionally fun night at a price that you won't need to worry about, after midnight, the large main space is given over to the authority of the DJ, and a packed dance floor quickly conglomerates.With a little something for almost every type of nightlife party-goer, The Blind Barber is one of those few destinations that sometimes deserves a cross-town trip.",1

On another weeknight the crowd was good and there wasn't any real wait for drinks. Last time I ordered a specialty cocktail - Smoke and Dagger which has Jack Daniels, jalapeno infused Cointreau, lime juice, ginger and cucumber. It was fantastic. Extremely smooth. The spice of the jalapeno permeated the entire drink, giving each sip a consistent kick. Bartenders here are quality. The space is fun and is perfect to bring out of town guests.

A bouncer then threatened to kick my crying, injured friend out of the venue for ruining the vibe. It was awful. Drinks were nothing to write home about and, thanks to overcrowding, it took forever to get one (close to twenty minutes).

They are a little cheaper than the standard speakeasy prices of $15-$20. The bartenders are usually on the rude side.

The first challenge here is getting past the pretentious bouncer. We came around 9:30 and he hesitated to let us in for a while. One, because it was ""nearing"" their busy time and two, because of our ratio of two guys to one girl. Really? I understand Vegas clubs, but you're a simple bar. What if a couple of guys just come here to hang out? After some convincing, they finally let us in, but the made the experience an unnecessary pain in the ass. Drinks are wonderfully prepared. Bananarama, Strawberry Fields and The Dynasty are all fantastic drinks with the first being my downright favorite. It takes longer than average to order and get your drinks due to the massive crowds just chilling at the bar and blocking everyone. Bartenders are a bit douchey and pretentious as well, but that's expected from such highly-acclaimed mixologists. This is also why they charge $15 a drink + tax. Not sure when drinks started getting taxed, but it's annoying.For a speakeasy, this place has a strange vibe going for it. The decor fits, but they play hip hop at obnoxiously loud levels.

IMO though, the Blind Barber exudes the same attitude as the patrons who frequent it--mid 20s to early 30s year old who are still ""figuring out what to do with their lives."" Honestly, it doesn't know what it's going forObviously the entrance is through a barber shop, so that's the speakeasy element. However, the music is super loud and it's really dark, so it feels like it's going for the LES Fat Baby/the Delancey vibe. And then the whole dull and rude bartenders mixed with entirely-not-memorable drinks (besides an overly sweet and memorable-in-a-bad-way drink featuring Drambuie and a whisky) just doesn't fit any categories.The  redeeming factors are the quaint decor, and the fact that drinks are on the cheaper side compared to other speakeasies ($12 and $13), so at least you might be able to drink enough to forget about all the aforementioned problems!",7
197,1,11/7/2013,17,1,"Manhattan, NY",Alex V.,0,5.0,10,I LOVE The Blind Barber. It's probably my favorite speakeasy in the city so far. I find it less pretentious than some of the others. I have only ever been on a Wednesday or Thursday so I can't really say too much about weekend crowds. (Aren't most cool places obnoxiously crowded?)The drinks are amazing and they have a HAPPY HOUR UNTIL 9!!!!I wish I lived next door.,2
198,,1/2/2016,1,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",John B.,5,3.0,20,It's a cool speakeasy behind a barbershop. I strolled in here on a whim and it was Happy Hour. The Happy Hour prices are very reasonable and feature their specialized cocktails.,
199,1,1/17/2014,7,1,"Bayside, Queens, NY",Jessica L.,3,4.0,51,"I came here for the first time last night, and I'm definitely a fan.  I met one of my girlfriends here at around 6:30pm, so it was pretty empty.  We didn't leave until 12:30am, so you can tell we were having a good time.The music was good until the twilight zone time between ""barber shop closing time and until DJ gets there"" (as told by the bartender), the bartenders were great and attentive, the drinks were deeeeeelish, and we were also there for happy hour, which was helpful because DANG those drinks do add up. $$$The only thing I could really complain about was the crowd.  It came in two waves last night, the complete :GAG ME WITH A SPOON: try-hard yuppies, and then some regular ol Manhattan oddities.  It was almost as if there was some secret goth party in another room we didn't know about, or something.  The latter crowd was just really pushy and rude.I'll totally be going back, though.",1
