Second floor has plenty of seating with a view of the avenue. Easy place to grab a bite and keep it moving. Buffet style counter as well as counter service food made to your order.",3,1,2
1,Boris C.,"Sheepshead Bay, NY",151,24,1,1.0,6/29/2018,"2nd straight lunch I had to throw out because the food was horrible. I mean almost inedible. I work right upstairs and it's convenient but enough is enough. I tried the salads, the buffet and their sandwiches and it's all loose leaf paper tasting.Officially done with this place",,,
2,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",316,454,6448,4.0,12/6/2017,"This is my go to spot for breakfast in the AM rush.  They have a convenient hot buffet for breakfast fare - featuring eggs of all kinds (egg white scramble, regular eggs and cheese, no cheese, sunny up or hard boiled), there's also pancakes and French toast.  A sampling of pre-made wraps (already cut in half so you don't have to get the same flavor if you choose more than one), some classic breakfast sandwiches already put together to go, and lots of protein options.  Sausage, turkey bacon, regular bacon, ham.  They even have tator tots, hash browns or home fries on the ready.  The cold breakfast buffet offers fruit and yogurt options, bagel and lox sandwiches, deviled eggs, etc.  It changes day to day so always fun to look.There is a classic grill counter as well so if you don't want the pre-made stuff, you can order fresh from the counter there.  Try the blueberry bagel w/ cream cheese...it was excellent.The check out lines by the door look long but move pretty quickly - there's usually two registers on the ready and if it's crazy busy, they open a third one towards the back of the store.  Note: you will have to make your own coffee, self-serve station on the side and if you want oatmeal - same deal, scoop it and doctor it yourself with the oatmeal station.  All in all a good value and all price points.  Rest of the joint is a typical deli.",8,6,7
3,Kelly Y.,"New York, NY",138,138,228,4.0,3/4/2018,"This is my go to lunch spot whenever I have time to go out and buy lunch! What can you go wrong with a wide variety of hot foods, sandwiches and even a salad bar? My go-to is the salad bar where I can choose up to 7 different topics over a bed of spinach, lettuce, romaine lettuce, or other types of salads. There's a choice of vegetables and protein which is perfect if you're looking to watch your weight or count your macros. I usually opt for either the grilled chicken or tuna, egg whites, chickpeas, and other toppings which gives me enough energy and makes me feel healthy.  Their pricing is decent in the Midtown area and portions are larger than most places. If you don't want to go back to the office just yet, there's an upstairs seating area to take a nice break or have some alone time.Check out this place - there's so many different selections you will never get bored.",2,1,1
4,Danny H.,"Lake Ronkonkoma, NY",6,1,0,1.0,10/7/2018,"Today I decided to try this place with my co-worker, since I work for a large Corporation near by and always pass by it. Went in and decided to order a shrimp ramen soup. Which was on the screen for $9. When the cook finished making our soup we take it and see that it had $10 written on it. When we get to the register we realized it and told the two girls at the counter and they said that, this was the price. I had them look at the screen. And right away the second girl went around grabbed a remote and changed the screen to a screen with a different price on it. And she comes back and says no it's not it's this price. I don't have an issue paying a dollar more. But it was the principle behind what she did. That really messed us up about this place. We told them we were going to pay the $9 for each soup. She says ok. And when we get the receipt. She charges us the $10 each. We will never be coming in this place again. Guaranteed, and our co-workers heard about this the same day, they will not be going anywhere near this place again. If they had before. If you decide to walk in here. Please look at the prices they have. Before you go to the counter to pay. These girls were the worst explanation of customer service that I have ever encountered.",,,
5,Brian F.,"Lake in the Hills, IL",367,195,314,4.0,3/15/2017,"Though I haven't been in the restaurant, I have had their catered lunch during a training I had for work.The sandwiches they made were toasted, stacked, and super flavorful. I had two servings of the Ruben (how they spell it, but I spell it Rueben) and several servings of the avocado/corn/hearts of palm? salad. The combination of taste, texture, and innovation make this experience mainly about the food. I know that my colleagues complemented the parmigiana, meatball, and chipotle sandwiches (those are all separate options), and I think there was a Philly Cheesesteak and a tuna melt that I would've tried if I wasn't so full. My rating for the food alone is 5 stars easy. As far as the catering aspect goes, the couriers showed up early and set up quickly to ensure that they would serve the meal on time. The sandwiches were hot and the selection was diverse. There were even a few options for gluten-free eaters and vegetarians.If you want to go into the restaurant itself, I think it would be the best way to see what they've got. If you're looking to cater an event (especially lunch) I would highly recommend Bocca Bliss as a must-try option.",3,1,2
6,Anne Y.,"Bridgeport, CT",0,6,0,1.0,8/22/2018,Rude staff!!! Overpriced. Cashiers are rude and don't even look up at you before they take your cash. The prices change every day and the food isn't the best.,,,
7,Oss I.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,0,3.0,5/18/2018,"Unfortunately mixed feelings.  The food is quite good, with lots of choices, and quite easy to eat really healthily.However, the cashiers are maddening/infuriating.  Almost no English, slow (and this place gets very crowded, so the cashiers create long, slow lines), more interested in chatting and smiling with each other and the countermen than in focusing on customers, clearly telling them how much their food costs, and processing the exchange.If they had better cashiers, I'd easily give them either four or five stars.",,,
8,Sampad D.,"Lansdowne, VA",191,825,522,3.0,12/26/2016,Just like any other NY buffet place. They do have lot of option but I found it to be just OK.Just been once over here with just an OK experience !,1,,
9,Michelle F.,"Sarasota, FL",222,4,0,5.0,1/11/2018,I enjoy their salads as they are very fresh. The salad guy is the nicest and friendliest guy. He makes and chops the salads perfectly. Their prices are great too!,,,
10,Jason W.,"Wayne, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,1/12/2018,The deli guy had no clue what a turkey club triple-decker was and then the cashier charged me more than was was written on the sandwich.  This place is a mess you're better off going to any of the hundreds of other delis in the area.,,,
11,Angela G.,"White Plains, NY",1,88,12,5.0,4/26/2016,"I have never, ever, EVER eaten off a buffet steam table...until BOCCA BLISS. (Sorry yelpers, but typically I cringe at the thought of eating from something you've breathed all over and poked through with your grubby little paws.) But THEN...I was LURED one day by Bocca's grilled seafood salad, those perfectly charred little tentacles calling to me. Could it BE??? SEAFOOD SALAD?After slowly circling the ENTIRE table, carefully scrutinizing everything and finding it PRISTINE, I stood back for a moment...watching. I was SO pleased to see someone in a Bocca shirt doing the SAME thing. He was inspecting & wiping, inspecting & stirring, inspecting & changing spoons, inspecting & turning the tray...Inspecting, Inspecting INSPECTING. I deemed it safe to dive in.. let me tell YOU... boy am I GLAD I did! Bocca BLISS... is EXACTLY what the name implies...a mouth full of SUPREME HAPPINESS. Luckily I brought it back to my office to enjoy, because I caught myself making yummy food noises as I ate. It was the REAL DEAL too, no imitation seafood here.Being a little on the picky side, with whatever dietary restrictions I have placed on myself at any given moment makes this my GO-TO spot. When I was going through a no bread phase, the sandwich guy made me lettuce wraps for a week. I tend to micro-manage the preparation of all my food and they have never made a mistake. FINALLY, a place where the employees speak English. I know I'm not the only one that hates when you have to point at salad toppings over a counter that comes up to your nose AND has salad bowls stacked on top of it.BEST iced coffee EVER! I'm partial to making it myself and they have a great selection, including syrups. I'm also a huge fan of their sushi, besides being really good, they make brown rice sushi options as well. I just found out they make their own mozzarella IN HOUSE. As well as those little cookies and peanut brittles in the packages with their logo on it. They're all made and packaged in house. Not private labeled out. If you are lucky enough to come by a package of the BACON peanut brittle, snatch up EVERY package and DON'T share it. It's FOOD PORN and they don't always have it. If you are someone who is sick of the same old thing, I would definitely give them a shot. They ALWAYS have something new and delicious!",5,5,2
12,Cynthia D.,"Queens, NY",474,866,6306,4.0,4/1/2015,"A very spacious lunch spot in the immediate area. Every section is neatly organized - from cashiers to coffee to salad bar to drinks display to buffet to ramen to bibimbap and to sandwiches. There are monitors on top of each section that has the menu, list of ingredients in the food, and the price. I particularly like the ramen and udon section. It comes in a big bowl container with choices of Vegetables, Chicken, or Shrimp Tempura. I love the fried tofu and various vegetables toppings like carrots, broccoli, and mushrooms that goes in with it. Soup is hot, savory, and quite tasty. Of course, the soup is not comparable to real ramen shops but good enough for take-out ramen. They do not offer seafood option anymore for a very long time now but I hope they will bring it back someday. Fresh tossed salad. Select your lettuce, medium or large and top it with as much toppings as you can fit. The ingredients are very fresh compared to neighboring competitors. Delicious!I do want to point out that, although the store is very well-organized physically, their staff aren't evenly distribute around the stations. Unless it's prime time lunch, there's almost no one at the ramen and udon spot. I would suggest speaking up and ask politely for assistance. Do not be shy and wait until they notice you because they will not. Overall, I recommend the morning coffee (French Vanilla is the best!), salad, bibimbap, and the ramen/ udon. This place is respectable for a Midtown lunch spot.",7,3,5

14,Laureen R.,"Yonkers, NY",29,138,17,2.0,9/19/2016,"I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  I have been getting breakfast and lunch at least 2-3 days per week and have always believed that they have really fresh and decent food.  My first issue is that they are so focused on the catering that you can't even get around the buffet or to the soda refrigerator because all their catering orders are all over the place.  I've tripped and been bumped by catering carts dozens of times.  Yesterday I asked for a 3rd Avenue (Sandwich),  The guy was making another sandwich for the display and completely ignored me.  I asked two more times and nobody moved to make my sandwich so I just walked out completely disgusted.  I showed up this morning for breakfast and they had everything BUT eggs.  It was 7:45 AM. Seriously?  It has been my experience that the breakfast buffet is always missing something.  My friend and I just came from there at 11:50 AM to grab lunch.  I waited 10 minutes for a pre-made sandwich and then as I was standing there, I was asked to move because they were mopping the floor.  Is it really wise to mop the floor right at the start of lunch time?  I do believe the food is pretty consistent but if something appears to be spicy its almost always WAY TOO SPICY for my palate and I think I have a high spice tolerance.  There have been days where I have thrown away their guacamole because it was way too spicy it was inedible.  They also let the staff eat from the buffet (which is not uncommon) so if you go in there at 12PM, you will likely be standing and waiting behind staff members getting their own food.....I'm not suggesting that they don't eat but do they have to do it in the middle of the lunch crowd when their customers are trying to get in and out?  I told my co-worker that I need a break from them.  I will be taking my business to AMISH MARKET around the corner for a while.",1,4,
15,Meka S.,"Rosedale, NY",76,169,383,3.0,3/23/2017,Sometimes come here for breakfast or lunch. I tired the udon chicken soup . It was very very good and and you get a lot of soup for the price ($8) .,2,2,1
16,Tam R.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",159,10,0,5.0,4/27/2017,"This place is perfect for picking up something quick & healthy.  They have a full buffet bar & prepared hot food, but you should head for the salad (unlimited toppings) or the Udon/Ramen bar.

17,William C.,"Englewood, NJ",241,21,9,5.0,4/23/2016,"I eat here regularly for lunch and haven't had a bad meal yet. They have a good selection of health conscious foods, New York style and portion sandwiches, great hot food/salad bar and breakfast! I'd recommend anything chicken as they give generous portions for a great price. Bocca has also catered for my office more times than we can count and has never disappointed, it's tough to please hardcore office foodies!Overall, they have always been accommodating and their service has always been top notch, oh and the food is good too!

Updated review","I am now officially a ""regular"" at Bocca Bliss, I eat here at LEAST 6 times a week, (Breakfast and Lunch).  My last review was a review of their lunch, which was in a word, AWSOME.  then I went in their one morning, and I discovered the wondrous NEW and Unchartered world of I have named ""Bocca Breakfast"".   The coffee is TOP NOTCH, FAR better than ANY PLACE around, including Starbucks. The Bagels are INCREDIBLE, as you would expect they have a grill, (2 actually, VERY fast) where you can get just about anything made to order.  But the REAL treasure is their breakfast bar, LOADED with fresh cut fruits which included Mango and Dragon fruit (My Favorite), Homemade Cottage cheese and Yogurt with ALL sorts of toppings, but the real ""Star of the Show"" was the Hot Side, LOADED with all sorts of Goodies, from Pancakes French Toast, an assortment of different Grilled cheese sandwiches cut very small, as well as assortment of sandwiches on Croissants, English Muffins, Mini Bagels, and Flatbread, as well as ALL sorts of eggs and MUCH More, including Delicious Homemade Compote toppings, EVERYTHING is FRESH, and they are always adding new stuff ALL the time, you gotta see it to believe it.The Bocca Bliss ""catch Line"" is  ""Creating Fanatics"", I am now officially a  Bocca Bliss FANATIC.",3,1,1
19,Jennifer M.,"North Bergen, NJ",22,12,3,5.0,7/21/2016,"My job's GO TO lunch spot. Unlimited toppings on your salad for 9 bucks. Can I get an 'Amen'!! The hot food selection can be a bit slim but non the less there are other options to choose from if you're feeling anything from there that day. All the workers are super friendly and crank out food and payment as fast as they can during the lunch rush. They have a second floor with tables and TV's where you can eat your lunch but there are so many other places to grab food and eat outside, weather permitting of course.",1,,

It's a good spot to go to for a variety of different foods and the staff there is always friendly and helpful.  They make salads and sandwiches however you prefer. Soups are always different and salad bar with so many good options everyday. I've mainly gone there for lunch but breakfast is the same idea. Very good spot for take out. If you prefer to stay and eat, they have a really nice sitting area upstairs with a view of the city streets. One of my favorites!",1,1,1

You are always greeted here and never feel rushed when ordering.  This is my morning pit stop and whenever I have extra time I enjoy sitting up stairs where they have the morning news playing on the TV and Free Wifi.I have to say... The breakfast selection could make anyone happy; Moist bagels, Hot Buffet that has everything even Turkey Bacon and Mini Frittats. I probably come eat lunch here 3 days a week when I decide to eat out and not bring my wife's leftovers. The lunch selection is delicious! I usually go for the hot buffet but the sushi/ramen station is delicious.",4,,3

29,Lisa Z.,"Flushing, NY",1,54,421,4.0,4/19/2016,"Minus a star for the limited English communication here. I had to repeat what I wanted numerous time. Like I asked for this and they repeated back something else, at least they did confirmed with you before proceeding. One time I asked for balsamic vinaigrette and ended up getting just ""vinegar"" on my salad. Argh. But nevertheless, I love the salad bar here with unlimited toppings and will continue to come back if I am nearby. My salad: mixed greens, chicken, ham, cheese, corn, broccoli, cucumber, onion, bacon bites, almond, AND mango. (which can be a hit or a miss depending on the days. One time I got it and it was too ripe and soft, other time just right and perfect.) I now see they have additional items you can add on to your salad like shrimp, salmon, beef and something else WITH additional charge of course. A plus for having a cashier to checkout right at the end of the salad bar. That way you can pay and go instead of getting on the long lines at the front. Note to come before 12pm if you want to avoid the long lines but it does move somewhat fast depending on how many of those guy behind the counter assisting customers.",2,,3

They always exceed our expectations which is why we keep coming back. The food is delightful and we love their wide variety of selections as we have some employees with dietary restrictions.

38,Sandra B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,11,0,1.0,2/4/2016,"I've been working in the area for 2 years and over the course of time it seems to me as if the prices are going up but the food quality is going down. Buffet Station:Hot buffet station has the same consistent items which in some cases can either be too salty, over cooked or under cooked. The Cold buffet station can be dry at times and the salads some times taste as if they did not wash the greens. Not to mention lately the store has been displaying a shrimp cocktail in which the first 2 days it was fresh but after it seemed as if it was sitting in the wrong temperature. Iced Coffee:Interesting investigation, my colleague and I discovered that the small iced coffee cup versus the large ice coffee cup are exact sizes. It is all an illusion yet they charge different prices. Can we explain that? Prices: I was told prices went up a year ago for the buffet station which I believe is not $8.40 per pound. I find it bizarre that depending on the cashier I purchase from the prices would be inconsistent. I strategically placed a half of scoop of sticky white rice(horrible) with a half a scoop of pepper steak. The total for that all together 4.50 which did not seem right. The day prior my tray was much heavier during lunch and funny enough the price went up by a dollar. Myself and a few colleagues  have decided to no longer purchase anything from Bocca, regardless if it is literally next door.",2,,

In addition they support independent merchants locally based on the products I have seen for sale. Overall Midtown has an abundance of stores that have similar services but very few have the warm hospitality that I have encountered. It's a business first so the friendly demeanor is just an added bonus for people like me who are starting their work day.Great service, great staff and even better business!",6,,

I was casually drinking my coffee back at my office when I noticed there was an ACTUAL RAZOR BLADE IN MY COFFEE. Just floating in it. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?!?!Never get stuff from here. If they don't notice a razor blade at the bottom of a clear plastic cup, then god only knows what else goes on.",4,11,
44,Maria D.,"Sunny Isles Beach, FL",9,4,0,5.0,7/30/2013,I love this place!The food is always fresh and good and the staff is on point and very helpful. One of my favorite lunch spots to-go to. Try the buffet or make your own salad. Simply delicious!,7,,2
45,Eugenia N.,"South Yarmouth, MA",0,1,0,5.0,4/25/2016,"Used Bocca Bliss for corporate event, couldn't have asked for better results.  Received excellent customer service--rep was always attentive, available to answer any questions, and provided honest suggestions throughout the process.  Food arrived exactly on time, everything was in order and as promised.  Definitely recommend using Bocca Bliss when hosting an event!",4,,3
46,Lys W.,"Jersey City, NJ",94,116,0,1.0,6/9/2014,"I have been patronizing Bocca Bliss for a couple of years now, since before when it was Sarah's kitchen.  I come in and buy breakfast and lunch, and order through Seamless sometimes for lunch. I really like them and the staff.The morning staff are all really great, and very helpful, but I had a horrible experience today.I order early this morning through Seamless for 11:30 delivery, which I have done many many times.  I have never had a complaint.  Today, the weather was terrible (i know they probably were slammed with orders), but my food still hadn't arrived as of 12:00 PM.  I called to check on the order, and the lady who picked up (wouldn't give me her name) said it was on the way, and as  I tried to ask if she had and estimated time and before I could finish speaking, she hung up on me.  She did not ask my name or what my order was.  That is fine, I know they are busy, but hanging up on a customer mid sentence was not ok.I called back, and asked to speak with a manager.  The lady proceeded to yell at me that there was no one above her.  I said that I would like to make a complaint about the extremely rude telephone call I was just on with her, and I would like to speak with someone else.  She told me there was no one else, they were too busy to deal with a phone call and that the food was on the way, and proceeded to try to hang up on me again.  I then asked her how to make a complaint, and that I would come in, and she screamed at me that ""FINE, make a complaint, I don't care"" and hung up again.I am planning on going in later today to speak to one of the other managers on staff, but as much as I am in here probably 5-8 times a week.  That's it.  I will go to Olympia, Amish, or Gourmet over Bocca, until this is addressed.",2,1,
47,Sujin C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",13,38,3,5.0,5/23/2014,"So I've been meaning to write a review for weeks, but finally doing it now. Best UDON ever!! Now I'm Asian so I know good soup when I try it. The udon here is really good, with lots of vegetables, and apparently the broth is vegetable broth. Also there's NO msg. The people who work here are always smiling and really nice. The other hot food is really good to. Big variety and it's like gourmet food but without the big price tag. Definitely going to come back here again. And the inspection got an A. Excited to try their salad next time!!",1,,1
48,Kelly D.,"New York, NY",241,294,741,1.0,3/28/2013,"Worst salad I've ever had.  Not sure how it's possible to mess up a ""choose your own ingredients"" salad bar that bad, but they managed.  Ingredients don't taste fresh...like they might have frozen them the night before?  Everything was flavorless (including the dressing).  Salad tasted like water.  yuck!  Not to mention this place is very chaotic!  I've had a better salad from McDonald's if that tells you anything.  If you want a good salad in the area go to Machiatto, Metro, or Equinox.  I can't speak for anything else they have, but won't be back to find out!",4,,
49,Thomas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,317,135,1.0,2/19/2013,"Sarah's Kitchen has changed hands and is now under new management for the second time in the past year. They are renaming it ""Bocca Bliss"" or something or another. Besides changing out the staff (and getting rid of the guy that made awesome Tofu Soup) they also put the buffet station in the middle of the floor. Now there's literally nowhere to stand inside that place. But this is about the Tofu Soup and nothing but the Tofu Soup. I must confess : I'm a sucker for the Soon Doo Boo. I search far, I search wide and anyplace that serves it I shall try. When I finally found the combination of taste, seafood and authenticity from a tofu soup like the one served Sarah's Kitchen I was relieved. It's like finding a nice doctor, someone who's there and you can go to visit when you're in need. I stepped into Sarah's Kit... ""Bocca Bliss"" and noted that the new AZN station is now up front. I didn't see any stoves for cooking/heating up tofu soup. Not a good sign.Me : So...what happened to the other guy who used to make the tofu soup here?Chef : Oh... he's not here anymore. Me : Oh. Well do you guys still make the tofu soup the same way?Chef (Looks to the left, slight pause) : Yea we make it the same way. So I said what the hey and I went for it. It was all bullshit. They did NOT make ti the same way at all. - Soup was super watery and had no flavor or spiciness. - As a result of the above, everything in the soup (including the tofu) tasted like it was just boiled in hot water.- The seafood mix they use was cheap as crap with tiny ass shrimp. On top of it they didn't even give me much. I had less than 10 pieces of seafood. Needless to say this is one of the worst tofu soups I've ever had. Don't come here.  I hope Bocca's Bliss meets a swift end. This place is definitely worse than Sarah's Kitchen. (WHY DID YOU LEAVE?)",3,2,1
50,Gee S.,"Bronx, NY",3,5,0,4.0,3/25/2015,"Always have breakfast delivered, the food is so fresh, you have to be quick about ordering tho, it is first come first served, meaning if you want until 11 am to order a croissant they may be out.

53,Mary M.,"Manhattan, NY",2,36,5,1.0,8/1/2014,"WOW do I hate this place. I used to come here all the time - ever since it opened as Sarah's Kitchen. It was good back then, but Bocca Bliss is seriously just awful. Even still, I'd come out of convenience because it is right next to my work. The food is eh and the salad bar which I usually get is NOT good. But it's convenient so sometimes I'd still go. After today though, I'm done. I have a loyalty card that gets stamped each time you get something from the salad bar. I came in at 10:53 and they refused to stamp it, saying they don't start until 11. Are you kidding me? The cashier even checked with another woman to make sure since it's so ridiculous, to which she said no. The customer service here is honestly abysmal  - I guess I wasn't even surprised. So thank you Bocca Bliss..for making it an easy decision never to come back once and for all.",3,1,

The woman that recommended this place to me always orders from the salad bar.  So I recommend getting something from the salad bar.  I tried the salad today and it is pretty fresh and my palettes had not objections.  So far I had the salad, spicy tuna roll and the deluxe veggie burger.  The sushi is not my fav b/c the rice is not fresh - it's rather sticky.  But the sushi bar is a plus as it is one of my favorite cuisine.",2,1,4
