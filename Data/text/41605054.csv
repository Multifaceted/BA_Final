0,Kyle S.,"Cambridge, MA",398,236,327,5.0,10/20/2018,"My friend brought me here as the go-to-bagel shop in the East Village; he knew what he was talking about. The Jersey (ham/egg/and cheese) with a scooped out Cinnamon-raisin bagel was absolute perfection. We even ordered a third bagel--cinnamon raisin with scallion cream cheese, also delicious. Ordering can be a bit confusing if you're not a regular. You have to walk to the back of the store and get in line to order, then pay at the register--just be sure to know your order before they ask or you'll upset all the locals/regulars in line! Worth the stop for a great NYC bagel.",,,
1,Paris A.,"Chicago, IL",433,55,97,5.0,10/17/2018,"I was with one of my best friends for her birthday weekend, and I ordered an everything bagel with lox, egg, cheddar cheese, and avocado. My friend ordered a french toast bagel with chocolate chip cookie dough cream cheese, and we split the bagels half and half. This place is especially unique because you can watch all the bagels being made while you wait for you bagel to be crafted, so you know it's the freshest bagel around. I couldn't help but jump like a little kid in a candy store when they called my name to pick up my order. The first bite was like a little taste of heaven. They load up the inside of the bagel so much so that the bagel doesn't overpower all the fillings. However, the bagel is still thick enough to delight in all it's flavors and freshness. The bagel was fluffy but not dry. A good bagel doesn't need to be toasted if it's cooked at the right temperature and has a blistery texture on the outside, just as this bagel did. It was dense and chewy but also easy to bite into with the perfect balance of seasonings. To talk on the fillings, there's nothing better than fresh scrambled egg in a bagel when you're used to circular egg patties in Dunkin-Donuts wake-up wraps. The cheese was perfectly melted and dripped through to all the layers so you got a taste in every bite. The lox was an amazing addition to add some more protein. It wasn't fishy and had a great consistency--not cut too thick or too thin. It's hard to come across places these days that are generous in their avocado disbursement, and I definitely did not feel skimped out in that regard. Each layer complimented the next, making for an overall wonderful reward after a two-mile run. Now THIS was bae-goals.",,,
2,Morgan T.,"Cleveland, OH",275,376,142,4.0,10/6/2018,"Bagels,bagels,bagels. I love 'em, I can't get enough of them. Question to the audience, is a New York Bagel better than a bagel anywhere else in the world? It's up for debate, but what I can say is that the bagels here are top notch, and worth the visit. I'd imagine if you come here any given morning, it's busy as all get out, but they have a really efficient system for keeping the line moving. Basically, there's a staff member coming around to the snake-like line, and writing down your order. Fortunately, they have a giant visible menu board making it easy to sort out what they have. After writing down your order, they'll give you a ticket to hold on to until  you get to the register. You'll pay there and your bagel is already ready to go. The obvious downside to this system is that if you change your mind after all that time waiting in line, there's no going back. However, I think in general, it works well. They have a variety of smears, and it's great to be able to watch them prepare the bagels from the giant glass window as you wait. They are most definitely fresh, as evidenced by watching them pour the bagels straight from the kitchen into the giant baskets for serving up. There isn't enough seating here for the number of people coming through, and sadly although there's a lovely looking patio in the back, it isn't open as claimed by the business owners that there's a cranky old man living upstairs that disallows it, but the upside is that you can carry your freshly made bagel to the adjacent park, where there's bounds of dogs and people watching if the weather permits. I found the symbiosis between the bagel shop and the nearby park to be absolutely perfect. I'd highly recommend coming here if you're in the area and looking for a good quality bagel, and I'd definitely recommend it if you have time to enjoy it in the park, making for a proper New York experience.",7,4,6
3,Jennifer L.,"San Francisco, CA",116,306,1171,5.0,9/17/2018,"My go-to bagel spot whenever I'm in NYC! And fortunately for me, super close to my local buds spot whenever I'm staying in LES. There are SO many spreads and meats/loxs to choose from. From the board menu, there's over a dozen combos they've made up for you to choose from OR you can always make your own. I've ended up making my own every time. I'm more of a savory person, so I've always leaned towards the lox and cream cheese options, but the sweet ones always look amazingly appealing too. Note that these bagel sandwiches are MASSIVE. I can never finish my own, and so during my most recent visit, my bud and I shared one. We went with the pumpernickel bagel (personal fav), with garlic TOFU spread (yes, tofu! Super yummy) and lox (the worker picked one for me. Tons of options). Be warned. It's cash only. Come prepared! Love this spot. Kept saying that I wish there was something like this in SF. Bah. I'll be back again the next time I'm in NYC! 5 stars.",2,,

I ordered an everything bagel with a side of scallion cream cheese & iced coffee. I was so pleasantly surprised with how delicious this was.

6,Eboni C.,"Atlanta, GA",21,66,228,4.0,8/12/2018,"This restaurant is located in lower Manhattan. I can in for a late breakfast one afternoon with my partner. The restaurant has a great ambience and air condition which is great for the heat. It separates in to two portions one for signature sandwiches and the other for strictly bagels. They have an assortment of nonalcoholic beverages, pastries, and candies. They are also vegan friendly. My partner ordered the BEC with avocado on a French toast bagel. It came out quickly and was piping hot, which is the way all food should be served in my opinion! He enjoyed his choice. I ordered the Weezer which is chorizo, bacon, egg, chews, and your choice of creamed cheese on any bagel. I left out the egg. The chorizo was not what I was expected. It was a pre ordered slice of packed chorizo and took away from the bagel. The bacon, cheese, and bacon and chive cream cheese were a dream. I wish I would've ordered just a bacon, cheese, and cream cheese bagel. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will certainly be coming back in the future. One thing to note is that they only accept cash!!!",,,

For brunch we hit up this place and they had so much on the menu I couldn't decide what to get. So we picked a bagel we dont usually get and/or couldn't find in California. After we got the food, we had to find a place to sit and its pretty hard to find a spot. When we did, we chowed down on the bagels.Definitely have to try other flavors but maybe at another bagel shop with more seating if possible.",1,1,1

The staff is friendly. Cash only but ATM located inside. Nitro cold brew on draft. I wish they had laminated or print menus to look at when the line gets long.

10,Alexa B.,"New York, NY",164,100,191,3.0,7/9/2018,"I honestly hate giving bad reviews but I was EXTREMELY disappointed of what I was served when I came here last week. I was so excited to try this bagel you have no idea !! I came all the way from the heights and took a very long subway to get here which I wouldn't have mind if the bagel was actually good. Besides the fact it was cash only(annoying but has nothing to do with my review just kind of inconvenient but it's ok) the main issue I had was the bagel. This bagel was bland, stale and cold. I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese with mayo and jalapeños (paid literally almost 10 dollars for this, and in Long Island where the bagels are 10x better you pay at most 4 for a BEC) If I am paying that much for bagel it better taste amazing. The bagel no doubt was stale, it was so so hard to bite into it and I'm not exaggerating. The bagel had the egg on the whole thing, and then the cheese and bacon on 75% one half of the bagel and a small small amount on the other half. I asked for jalapeños and they gave me hard regular peppers on the bagel...how? I was so disappointed because not only did I waste money but my time eating this horrible bagel:( maybe I just had a bad experience but such a let down:( definitely will not be returning.",,,
11,Jeffrey R.,"Washington, DC",5,139,324,3.0,6/17/2018,"While Ess-a-Bagel has always been my go to bagel shop, I decided to branch out and give Tompkins Square a try.  While it did not usurp Ess-a-Bagel, it was very tasty.  The unique thing about Tompkins is their wide variety of cream cheeses.  The Garrett Jones: Your choice of bagel with egg whites, chicken sausage, onions, and spinach.  This was really good and not overwhelmingly heavy like your traditional sausage and egg bagel.  I would definitely go for this again.French Toast Bagel with Birthday Cake cream cheese:  Okay, okay, I knew this was going to be sweet.  But, I found the French toast bagel to be very bland and too tough.  The birthday cake cream cheese really did not have any special taste aside from.... sugar.  No need to try either of those again.",1,,

13,Jamie M.,"Nutley, NJ",244,68,155,5.0,8/6/2018,"Been going here since my freshmen year of college and have yet to find a better bagel anywhere else. I used to think that NJ had the best bagels but now I truly believe that Tompkins Square Bagels is the best (granted I have not tried bagel shops in Brooklyn, I will deem Tompkins the best bagel shop in Manhattan by a long shot).Service is always quick despite the long lines that appear on weekends. The bagels are thick so be prepared to have a lot of bread with the perfect ratio of cream cheese (which means a lot of cream cheese)!You really can't go wrong with a plain bagel and plain cream cheese, but their combos are also great. Things get pretty pricey after you go into the realm of their combos but hey, why not try some insane flavors while you can?!",1,,
14,Stephanie M.,"Brooklyn, NY",52,48,46,5.0,9/27/2018,"About a year ago, my friend raved about this bagel shop. A lot of bagel places make their bagels using milk, or whey, which is a bummer for vegans or like me people who are allergic to milk, or lactose intolerant. Tompkins Sq. Bagels do not contain milk products which was a plus! I got a bacon egg and avocado (since I can't consume cheese) and it was awesome! They took really good care of my severe milk allergy, cleaning a section of their stove top, so butter would not come in contact with my eggs. They used clean utensils to cook with, all during a very busy, down the street line! Next time I will come during an off hour, but I was impressed by their attention to cross contamination.Thank you!",2,,

16,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,2/26/2018,"Our usual weekend bagel spot is Russ and Daughters, and after my visit to Tompkins Square Bagels they remain my champion for lox. However, TSB has some truly delicious cream cheeses on offer.We came around 10:30 on Sunday and the line wasn't bad; we waited less than a minute to order and then five minutes to pay and receive bagels. This was a challenge as the list is massive: expect a dozen each of bagel types and cream cheese flavors, and dozens of different breakfast sandwiches. Cash only. The shop is skinny and seating can be competitive.My cinnamon raisin bagel was good. I don't feel confident that I can distinguish an excellent bagel from a good bagel, but I will say that it was on the chewy side and cut unevenly. Not much of a cinnamon flavor, but tasted good. The saving grace, however, was the espresso cream cheese. Intense coffee flavor offset by tart creaminess with the right touch of sweetness. I would legit buy this by the pound and ice a cake with it. It approached $5.My boyfriend's lox bagel was a mixed bag. Great everything bagel. Good quality plain cream cheese, though far, far too much of it (the salmon was sliding around and squirting out). Decent quality salmon, and good portion though dwarfed by the cream cheese. Far quicker and cheaper than Russ and Daughters (though this still approached $10), but not salmon bliss.Oh, and I also had a mini black and white cookie that I saved for later. Good stuff.",3,1,3

I got a blueberry bagel with three berry cream cheese. The cream cheese had real chunks of fresh fruit and you can tell it's made in-house. It was pretty packed around 11 am so it took a while for our bagels to come out. Overall pretty delicious but not mind-blowing.,,,
21,Sampath D.,"San Francisco, CA",361,136,294,4.0,9/15/2018,"Incredibly tasting and filling bagel, but the process to get it is a little messy. You don't really get a chance to look at the whole menu because it is so huge (so many great shmears and bagel types and sandwich combos) and they don't have little paper menus for you to hold. You kind of have to know what you want or at least what types of bagels you like. Also, the line is ridiculously huge so it takes about 30 minutes to order and get your food. But it is most definitely worth the price. The shmear is top notch and the bagel is also very tasty. Next time, I would probably take a deeper look at all the different shmears.",,,1

Came at prime time on a Sunday around noon to grab a bagel for lunch and the line was basically out the door. This place is cash only and the bagels you get are hugeeee. I ordered an everything bagel with regular cream cheese, lox, capers, onions, tomatoes! Think I paid around $13-14 for this, which is pretty standard in NYC. They put so much cream cheese on the bagels it's kind of ridiculous--maybe next time I'll ask them to go easy on the cream cheese. But the bagel was delicious! I think when you overload a sandwich like this, it's a little difficult to tell the quality of the bagel. But overall, the sandwich was delicious and on par with some of the other highly rated bagels in manhattan.

However, for the challenge I stuck to basics and got a plain bagel with cream cheese.This bagel was quite similar in appearance to the one at Best Bagel & Coffee.

So yesterday, I brought a friend here, proudly and ready to show her what Tompkins was all about. After a pretty long queue we were ready to chow down and found ourselves a nice table inside. The cream cheese for both were pretty good (bacon scallion and cucumber dill) but the bagels really fell flat. My egg poppyseed bagel was so cold I wondered if they'd taken it out of the fridge. Her oatmeal wheat (???) was fragrant but also rather cold, flat, and disappointing. While I might stop back in if I'm in the neighborhood, Tompkins isn't worth a special trip for me anymore. :/",1,,

43,Michelle O.,"Brooklyn, NY",231,9,22,5.0,1/21/2018,"I am a lover of all things bagel, but at Tompkins particularly, I think they're tofu fake cream cheese spreads are a step above the competition. My favorites are the Spinach and Artichoke, Garlic Herb and Tofu Lox with scallions spread. They also have a wide variety of regular cream cheese crazy flavors, but the tofu ones are really good.But the best part about Tompkins is the customer service. Yes, the line is usually very long, especially on the weekends, but that just means you're going to have a really fresh bagel. And while you're waiting in line, you get to watch them making the bagels.If you're interested in the tofu spreads, I highly recommend you ask for Carlos, as he makes the best bagels at Tompkins. He goes above and beyond to make sure you have an exceptional experience and it is one of the reasons I travel all the way to Avenue A from Brooklyn.",1,,

Their French toast bagels are unique and delicious, and can be paired with birthday cake cream cheese for those who have an extremely sweet tooth and like to buy food for Instagram opportunities.I don't let friends come to town without taking them here and you shouldn't miss out either.

Of course, you have your classic bagel and selection of cream cheese and then you have all these other crazy sandwich combos which all looked awesome. I opted for The Chittle (turkey, swiss, bacon, lettuce, onions) which was delish. Super fresh ingredients and it was packed out! My friend went for one of the specials of the day which was steak, egg and cheese. The server recommended this as the beef had been cooked that morning and he said that it was done perfectly... that was us sold! And it was really really good. The steak was thinly cut and just fell apart in your mouth! A breakfast enjoyed by all! Will return.",3,1,1
46,Derrick C.,"Dallas, TX",252,188,376,3.0,1/30/2018,"I wanted to give Tompkins a 4 or 5 star review, but too many issues with our visit. Based on principal alone, I had to give one less star than I would normally give because they are cash only which is something I will never understand in today's age. Less and less people carry cash on them and it is an inconvenience for those to go to an ATM (and for most, they have to pay ATM convenience fees that are not reimbursed by their bank).#1 - the ATM machine in their shop malfunctioned and stopped working when we were there yesterday, 1/29/18, morning. I, and a few others at the time we were there, had to go across the street to the 7/11.#2 - they got our order wrong. I ordered a morning bagel with egg, cheese, avocado, bacon, and sausage. I found out blocks later by foot that they had given me a smoked salmon and egg bagel with onions, which I hate. I had to pick the onions out and eat the bagel with just salmon and egg, no cream cheese or anything. And I paid $11.50 for that.I was a bit ticked off, because by the time I started to open the aluminum foil and start eating it, we were too far away for it to be worth it to walk back, tell them their mistake, and wait for the right bagel to be made again.So based on the fact that they are cash-only, which is idiotic in 2018, and with part of our order being wrong, I have to say that our experience this time was a 4. If they had gotten our order right, I would have easily said a solid 4 stars. The nutella chocolate and toasted almond schmear bagels we got in addition to our breakfast bagels were amazing.",,,

I was just about to ask about it again when one of the employees noticed (he was already swamped with orders) and immediately put down what he was doing to make sure I had what I ordered.

Updated review","This is my FAVORITE bagel shop in NYC.  The bagels here are always fresh and they have a huge assortment of cream cheeses, that resembles an ice cream setup in their cooler.  They also have a large variety of bagels, pastries, lunch sandwiches, etc.My GO-TO Order is = Everything Bagel w/ egg, lettuce, tomato, bacon, avocado & of course cheese.  I can practically taste it, it's so damn good!! The coffee is always good too but you don't go there for coffee, you go there for the bagels!  Having decent coffee to wash your delicious bagel down is just an added plus.The wait may seem long but usually moves very fast.  They do have seating there, but it is pretty minimal, the plus is there is a park across the street that has plenty of benches to chow down on your delicious bagel creation.If only I lived closer I would literally be there everyday.  Hope you love this place as much as I do!!Oh & did I mention, they deliver?!Cheers & Enjoy!",2,1,1

50,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,4.0,10/17/2017,"My first time at TSB, I got an everything bagel with Nutella and bananas. In my defense, I was hurting for that combination of salty and sweet, and, if you haven't tried it, it's quite good. I'm not sure if I would get the same thing in a less compromised state of mind but it fixed me up right. Over the years, my visits to Tompkins Square Bagels have tapered off (the prospect of lugging myself all the way down to the East Village and then standing in line fills me with dread). I have tried the Birthday Cake ice cream - overly sweet, overly hyped - but it definitely makes for an eye-catching social media shot. The bagel at TSB is excellent, on par with Ess-A-Bagel. Much better than the stones they're selling at Russ & Daughters. But I think the unsung heroes of this place are the specialty sandwiches that everyone overlooks in their mad rush to get a bagel, which, funny enough, are named after famous East Village residents. Like Jim Power or the ""Mosaic Man"" who's created so many beautiful mosaics on street poles. Or Jessie Jane, Jim Power's dog. I also really like their namesake sandwiches too, as well as the Scooter & Johnny with mozz and tomato. Out of all the things I've tried, the weaker options are the smoked fish and fish salad - the whitefish didn't have nearly enough mayo (and I say that as the world's biggest hater of mayo) and was pretty dry, while they were a little stingy with the lox compared to other bagel joints. Shoot. Now I really want a bagel. The one downside to getting a bagel here on a weekend is everyone within a five-block radius also feels like getting a bagel (though this is generally true for most bagel places in New York). P.S. I'm one of those people who fall firmly in the camp of toasting my bagel but the staff at TSB recommend against toasting on account of how toasting will affect the taste and texture of the bagel. While I still toast in the privacy of my own kitchen, I have to admit that the bagel's particular chewiness would have been lost.",6,2,6

52,Miriam M.,"Manhattan, NY",311,287,527,5.0,12/1/2017,"Better, cheaper, and quicker than Russ and Daughters IMO. Hands down.Friendly reminder: cash only, ATM located in the back. Have only tried the bagels but the breakfast menu is actually pretty extensive and they have a lot of baked goods and treats behind the glass. I sampled a black and white cookie and it was killer. My favorite is the Moo sandwich on a wheat everything bagel with roasted tomatoes. Hangover cure for sure. The French Toast bagel is not to be missed (I recommend it toasted with butter instead of the schmancy sweet schmears). I will say I was slightly annoyed they have an online order option that they apparently rarely use (at least when I have checked) and when I tried to call in my order they said they don't do phone orders either. Annoying but otherwise the guys behind the counter are always the best :]",1,,
53,Beatrice W.,"San Francisco, CA",143,517,81,3.0,4/27/2017,"I don't know if I got unlucky, but I've had better bagels in NYC.  I'm a purist when it comes to bagels so I ordered 5 different varieties sans cream cheese and lox, to judge the quality of the bagel itself.  Despite there being a line 1 1/2 times the length of the shop on a Saturday morning, not a single bagel I ordered was warm or had that slightly crunchy crust that is desirable in a fresh bagel.  I ate a blueberry bagel immediately and it was kind of dense, not great texture or yeasty flavor.  I froze the rest and have since been thawing them, quickly running them under cold water, and re-baking them, and at least I've been able to achieve a light crust and chewier center, but it's disappointing that my method generates better tasting bagels than they serve fresh.  Too bad, I picked the wrong place to hoard bagels to take back home.My guess is that the great reviews of TSB are from customers who order toppings on their bagel.  My friend, for example, ordered an everything bagel with pastrami lox and cream cheese and thought it was delicious.  I tried a piece of the pastrami lox and indeed, it was spectacular.  So go to TSB if you care for the large selection of spreads and toppings.  If you just want a damn good bagel, I suggest you venture elsewhere.",2,,1
54,Matt L.,"New York, NY",113,544,548,3.0,4/12/2017,"Very hard to justify a rating higher than three stars to a place which doesn't take credit cards.Visited Tompkins square bagels on a quiet morning, so there was no line whatsoever. the layout of the store was a little bit confusing.. basically it seems like you order your bagel at the counter, then move to the left to the cash register to pay. There is seating in the back and everything, so you'll have to head back inside if you decide you want your bagel to stayThere is a fair bit of seating for a bagel store, and even a bathroom. there's an outdoor area which you can look at, but i don't think it's accessible to people other than the staff.the actual bagel here is great. i went with my usual, which was onion bagel with whitefish spread. the bagel was pretty good here, better than the bagels i've had at other places in the city. the whitefish spread however suffered the same problem as many other places had, being too mushy and all. i'm beginning to suspect that most of these bagel places get their spreads all from the same placeCASH ONLY",4,,2

I needed to know this hype that somehow slipped from right under my nose. Prepared with my own cup of Joe in hand anticipating a long dreaded Saturday out the door line, I was curious to see that there was no line at the door and TSB looked pretty tame. Once inside, it was a different story. Controlled chaos is the way to describe it and there was a long line from the front of the entry to the entire stretch of the shop. I was immediately taken by the artisanal cold brew and kombuchas, and 5 different types of just boxed Tropicana juice of varying pulp degree. It was a veritable deli of gourmet fridge drinks alone. Soon as I got in line and transfixed by the hectic but intentional movements of the bagel/sandwich team, I was assisted with someone to take my order. Tompkins offer a variety of bagels, innovative spreads and even cooler customizable bagel sandwiches to boot. I had the Weezer on egg bagel with cucumber dill cream cheese, a bacon egg and cheese everything and a pumpkin bagel with sundried tomato tofu spread. I get it now. Describing it probably doesn't do it justice and neither does 2 visits. They are pricey but for good reason. Good service, a plethora of temptations and a dam good bagel with amazing amazing spreads and meat and egg toppings. The bagels are as fat and dense as any good bagel should be, with a hard crispy crust and sturdy, hearty chew. I prefer the bagel with just CC alone so that you can appreciate the bagel but you just can't go wrong here. TSB plays fair that way- they charge u for it so they are going to deliver. The chorizo sausage is yummy, bacon- of course and their eggs fried thickly around a piece of cheese was memorable- not your run of the mill breakfast sandwich- no sir!Oh, that tofu spread pique your interest as it did mine? It is just perfect and I'm not going to say anymore. You'd have to try it to believe it. I will be coming back regularly, well not too regularly I hope. And the next time it will be for their lemon/ pecan bars and the delicious looking matcha muffins. And of course bagels.",2,,

Updated review","Updating my review because it's long overdue. After an exchange of messages between me & the owner, I've been coming him regularly when I'm in need of a warm bagel! Every weekend this place is packed, and don't be fooled - the 2nd avenue shop is also packed! The owner is here every weekend making sure things run smooth which shows a lot about a business and how they treat their customers. I usually get whole wheat or everything bagel from Tompkins and it's always delicious! Whenever there's a long line, I usually skip it and go to the front counter and ask for the bagels not toasted with no schmear, and they're prepared quickly! I love that.

Especially since they come through the line and take your order so it's ready to go once you get to the counter - for me it was an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and bacon and I happily inched up the line and awaited my delicious, toasty bagel. Unfortunately, New York scripture dictates that you do NOT toast your bagels- something about drying them out. I did not learn of this until I approached the counter and saw the sign proclaiming that all their bagels will be served un-toasted. Call me a heretic, but I like my bagels toasted. A man working there (possibly the owner?) even gave me a spiel about how toasting the bagel is criminal and asked me to trust him because their bagels were so good, I'd take a bite and realize they don't need it. To that I say, what bread does not benefit from a crunchy exterior to contrast it's warm & soft interior? But when in Rome, though - right?

The second time, I ordered the Kaitlyn and added lox.Pros: In addition to the plethora of options available from type of bagel to cream cheeses, the staff is extremely welcoming and friendly. They have their system down to a science and even with the high-volume traffic that flows through, I haven't witnessed an inaccurate order yet.Cons: There's been a long line both visits. It goes fast (I waited about 15 minutes or so) but if you're in a hurry (or hangry), consider other options. Tips: - TSB is cash only but they have an ATM available if you forget your cash money.- Try to glance at the menu and have an idea of what your want before your visit. A staff member will come down the line and take your order. The full menu isn't always visible depending on where you're standing, so it's better to know what you want to avoid awkward hesitation or the dreaded order regret.",,,

The fish was buttery, fresh and delicious. The bagel, the real deal, fresh thick and chewy. The capers plump and rich.

I got the Black Seed Bagel for comparison, and I have to say, bagel-wise, I am more for Black Seed. Reason being, I like my bagels more chewy and dense, and Tompkins was more bread-y like supermarket ones. It didn't really stand out to me.What I was impressed with though, is the SELECTION! This place won't disappoint. I got the pumpernickel bagel with a Figs cream cheese. Sounds interesting right? It had chunks of cream cheese in it. Service was friendly and efficient considering the long line. Top marks here.The bagel just didn't deliver it for me. Bagel texture was forgettable, and I thought the cream cheese was too sweet. It was probably affected by the mammoth amount that they spread on it. The middle section was about as big as one half of a bagel, needless to say, it was too much.I'd be wiling to give them another chance, maybe the bagel wasn't so fresh (although I doubt it) but I would like to try out their other cool cream cheese flavors.",1,,

After two visits, I have not been disappointed.My boyfriend ordered the legendary french toast bagel with birthday cake cream cheese, and it was absolutely mouthwatering. Very sweet, but if that's what you're into, there's not much better out there.I also tried out something more savory, and went with an everything bagel with veggie cream cheese, avocado, tomato, and red onion. The bagels are large and the cooks do not skimp out on the toppings.Keep an eye out for seating you can grab while on line if necessary.",,,

There are some craft sandwiches (the Koch, the Dylan with innovative approaches for a breakfast sandwich). My friends tried the Dylan which is chicken, pesto egg whites, roasted peppers and mozzarella but it didn't seem like a ""breakfast'' sandwich IMO. They have a variety of home made cream cheeses (pumpkin, cucumber and dill, sun dried tomato, etc) but you can never go wrong with their veggie option.It's quite crowded so I wouldn't recommend sitting down here with more than 2 people.

But truthfully, after all the hype I expected to transcend into bagel heaven and that just didn't happen. The bagel is good, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't kick it out of bed. But it's not the best bagel. And the cash only thing is kind of annoying. I ordered a toasted garlic bagel with bacon scallion cream cheese and smoked salmon. When you enter you go straight to the back, where someone takes your order and hands you a ticket, then you head back to the front to wait for your bagel. The wait can be considerable, as many have said. I don't think they toasted the bagel. I mean, it wasn't warm and didn't appear toasty, so I can only assume. The garlic flavor was the strongest I've ever had on a bagel, and that was great. Some parts of the bagel were a little tough, a little too stiff. The cream cheese was pretty mild in flavor despite the bacon and scallion.I would give them another shot, but right now I think they're just OK.",2,,
92,Ruwan J.,"New York, NY",376,678,30534,5.0,3/29/2017,"R. is in the building err, bagelry...i can't believe that i never reviewed this neighborhood gem!a sun-drenched entrance opening into a kaleidoscope of bright colors, warm-toned woods, and matte metals is a perfect beginning to adventures in comfort foods. pieces of art (by the same artist, i think) depict various sights in NYC and adds whimsical feel to Tompkins Square Bagels. the experience here at TSB goes beyond food...it goes towards this idea or goal that everyone is welcome. community matters here. while many places claim this in words, Tompkins Square Bagels puts it into every element of the experience it creates for regulars, newcomers, and all those in-between.PRO TIP: Don't be an asshole. The staff is superfriendly and tries to be accomodating. Be patient and act like a humna being.Tompkins Square Bagels obviously sells bagels--a whole variety of them (plain * whole wheat * sourdough * sesame * poppy * multigrain * salt * garlic  everything * french toast* * whole wheat everything + more) that they make on premises the folks at TSB can talk bagels and how they make them. it shows in the final product crispy/crunch shiny outside + warm soft airy  insides...perfection.  i believe you can re-order gluten-free bagelsthere's so many cream cheese flavors to smooth out your savory taste pangs: plain cream cheese to jalapeno cheddar to birthday cake to wasabi. whether you want a light schmear or cream cheese piled high, just tell the folks behind the counter. they don't skimp and happiily oblige gluttonous cream cheese wants. there are tofu cream cheese options as well.PRO TIP: Don't be that person who says aloud in TSB that you've had better NYC bagels. You haven't. The bagels here are consistently some of the best NY-style bagels.  To each his/her own...BUT...the bagels here are friendly on the wallet and mouth!there's a whole variety of hot/cold signature bagel sando's to be had. my faves are the ""weezer"" (bacon, chorizo, egg, cheddar + cream cheese); ""the koch"" (hot pastrami, eggs, scallion cream cheese, red onion); ""the stantini"" (salmon, cream cheese, cucumbers, tomato); and the ""spicy tuna"" ( wasabi cream cheese, fatty tuna, tomatoes)...so many delicious sandwiches to choose from. OR you can create your own, obvi. i like ordering the ""breakfast burrito"" on an everything bagel as opposed to a wrap.PRO TIP: Before you say ""toast"" my bagel, heed the staff's advice of not toasting it. You'll ruin a perfectly good bagel bc of the default behavior of eating sub-par bagels elsewhere that need toasting. untoasted bagels are pretty much perfect.  outside of bagels + cream cheese, you can order different breakfast items (pancakes, omelettes, etc.), deli sandwiches (chicken salad, egg salad, etc.), bakery bites (muffins, cookies, cupcakes, + more), and don't forget about coffee/tea/etc. there is so much to try, don't box yourself in or out...if you remain unconvinced by the variety of tasty eats and beverages to sip at TSB, then you are likely dead inside. lol.PRO TIP: if you have a question, ask. don't be shy. the staff are all about making your experience at TSB an awesome one. a business that solves a problem is bound for glory. Tompkins Square Bagels does exactly that across its delicious wares, the seamless hospitality, and warm experience. however beyond that, TSB achieves the fine balance of creating a business that creates community in an ever-changing cultural/political/economic/etc. climate of NYC. while it seems it's ""en vogue"" to be focused on our differences, similarities, or being disconnected from the moment via technology...TSB gently nudges you to be aware, act a little bit more ""human,"" and most importantly being in the moment...all the while allowing you to sink your teeth into the most carb-y of NYC's eats with legit creamy cheesey flavors. friendliness and courtesy go a long way here as well as anywhere else in the world. from the weekend lines to the grab-n-go of the morning, pockets of moments have knitted themselves into stories that most TSB regular and newcomers have come to appreciate, and perhaps give us pause to be a little better in our day-in-day-out"" just cuz. that's not to say NYC humor and sarcasm are not appreciated or doled out.drops mic cuz these two-hand bagel sandwiches require one's full attentioni outzzz",24,22,23

They were not stingy with the meat, and ratio of cheese and egg was a perfect balance. I was scared that they would put too much cheese or egg, and take away the flavor of the meat...but they actually knocked it right out of the park!- Sweet french toast bagel with birthday cake cream cheese: The flavor in the cream cheese really tasted like birthday cake flavor. And the french toast bagel had good amount of cinnamon on it to add flavor. The bagel and the cream cheese had really good flavor and you could tell what it was supposed to be. The only problem I had is that the birthday cake cream cheese was so rich, that i had to take some out so that it would be more of a thin, sweet layer.

So that was annoying.We ordered a total of 7 bagels and waited about 25 minutes to get our order during an OFF PEAK time (around 11:00am).  I cannot imagine how long that would have taken had we been there during a busy time.

A friend and I decided to go at an off-peak hour to avoid the line that usually forms out the door. That was definitely the way to do it because we walked right in and ordered. First of all, the bagels are all handmade and the cream cheese selection is nuts! From scallion to birthday cake to almond, there's so many options. Second, there is a ton of selection when it comes to sandwiches, and there's even preset options if you have a hard time coming up with something on your own. Ultimately, I went with a french toast bagel with birthday cake cream cheese to try and achieve ultimate sugar coma.

I can't even imagine the mess it must be when the store is busy.I ordered The Wheezer breakfast sandwich, even though it was hours past breakfast, because the description of the ingredients was just too hard to pass up! I got it with the bacon scallion cream cheese without knowing that in addition to the chorizo, there would already be bacon in the sandwich. Oh well, too much bacon never killed anyone...The sandwich was huge and I could only finish half of it for lunch! It was a little messy to eat, even though it was tightly wrapped in paper, but it was delicious and everything that I could have wanted in a breakfast sandwich. There's plenty of seating in the back of the store, and a patio that wasn't open yet to the public, but that I am assuming will open at some point. If you don't need to rush out, its a nice place to sit and catch your breath! I chose to sit at the front of the store just so I could people watch. :)While I was waiting for my order, I saw the owner offer to buy dessert for a woman who had been waiting for a long time for her order.

It came delightfully toasted, so a little crisp on the outside, but airy and soft on the inside. It also had great flavor...by that I mean it didn't just taste like bread or flour. There was a deeply satisfying sticky and almost buttery aspect to them.  My hubby got regular bagels, the pumpernickel and the everything. We also tried several of their house made cream cheeees...so many to choose from! My favorite has got to be the birthday cake, but also really enjoyed the bacon and herb.

Everything from plain bagels with cream cheese to an everything bagel with lox to a pizza bagel (they're really good) to chocolate bagels (yes, chocolate).  Just about anything bagel, they got it. I love the authenticity of this place. The kitchen is open, so you can actually see them making dough into bagels as you're in line.

Updated review","Gluten free bagels + plain tofu spread. So good. If you have tried the GF bagels here and didn't like it, it's probably because you haven't had crappy California bagels.To a California girl who LOVED bagels pre GF diagnosis, I have had NY bagels before and know that they are to die for. In fact, my last meal would most likely be a NY bagel (regular, not GF since it's the last thing I'm going to eat anyway! :)).I've had other GF bagels from upstate on this trip, and noticed that the GF bagels there are much much smaller than the regular bagels. At Tompkin's, the GF bagels are slightly smaller than the regular bagels, but not by much. Ugh, I just scarfed down the two bagels that I had intended to bring back to Cali, and I haven't even left for the airport yet... :( Can't wait to return to get more! :) the only downside (but worth it since it's such a treat) is that the GF bagel itself is close to $5.00.

123,Albert H.,"Berkeley, CA",252,549,325,4.0,4/5/2016,"I came here on a Saturday morning and will say that this is one of my favorite bagels in NYC. I found Tompkins Square Bagels to showcase a wide variety of interesting flavors and cream cheeses and fillings that other bagel places do not showcase. When I got here Saturday morning, it was pretty packed, so a definite wait. There is also not a lot sitting space, so take your bagel to-go and eat somewhere outside. FOOD: I got two bagels (did not consume in one sitting, even though I could have for how tasty they were!). I got the infamous french toast bagel with birthday cake cream cheese and also a lox + cream cheese bagel as a standard. I will say that the french toast bagel with birthday cake cream cheese bagel was definitely a unique and pretty tasty bagel. I liked the bagel more than the cream cheese, but the cream cheese was not overly sweet or overpowering and complimented the bagel itself. The lox and cream cheese bagel on an everything bagel was definitely standard, but for the price, it is definitely well-priced compared to your other places here in NYC. I would say if I came back, I would go for the french toast bagel again and skip out on the lox. SERVICE: You order in line ahead, so it keeps the line progressing. It is definitely a wait, but not as bad as some people think. Have an idea before you come in knowing what you want or else, you will be holding up the line! Tompkins Square Bagels definitely has risen to the top of my favorite bagel places in NYC. I would definitely recommend if you are in the Alphabet City/East Village area for breakfast to come on over to Tompkins Square Bagels and try it out.",1,,

They hand roll them, and boil them in the traditional old world style. My recco: Get any bagel of your choice and cream cheese. This really let's the bagel be the star. I ordered the garlic bagel and the bacon and chive cream cheese and out of everything we had in NY (45 places) this was in my top 3. However -- we loved it so much we decided to come back the next day and get some sandwiches. I had a standard bacon egg, and cheese and it was just okay. I think because we came on a Sunday the first time everything was super fresh, hot and steamy. If it were just for the bagels and cream cheese 5 stars, the sammies are good, but not what you come here for. Also if you have a sweet tooth, they also have creative cream cheese like: birthday cake, and cookie dough - worth checking out and one of my fav spots in the East Village!",9,1,2

I've had better outside of the east village (think h&h) but inside of this 'hood, Tompkins Square kills it.They will let you taste test any flavor of cream cheese you want so take advantage of it. I hate birthday cake flavored food but their BD cake cream cheese stole my heart!Bagels are fresh and good but the only complaint is that I feel like the bottom half is too hard and tough. When I bite into it, instead of my teeth sinking in, it squishes all the cream cheese out of the sides. Boooo.Again, I've had them a better but from other places I've had nearby, this is a winner for sure.Bagel, egg, cheese, and chicken sausage. Delicious. Man. So good. If you want to indulge in lots of grease (think: hangover cure), this will hit the spot.Birthday cake cream cheese is sweet. I had it on a plain bagel and was a fan but it might have been better on a salt bagel to kick the flavor a bit.My usual of scallion cream cheese, plain bagel, and tomato slices was a solid choice, as well. Still want to remention the fact that when you bite down it ALL comes out of the sides. Seriously. It's a bit miserable...if it didn't taste so darn good, I would be more upset. ;)",12,8,10

I am a die hard bacon egg and cheese on everything fan and it's easily the best I've ever had. The cheese is perfectly melted, they're generous with the egg portions, the bagel is perfectly seasoned and toasted. I really want to try something new but I love my BEC so much that I never follow through. However, the menu is pretty legit and there are a lot of great options to choose from. In addition, the price is fair, staff is friendly and shop is cozy.The only downfall of this place that I can think of is the fact that it's cash only. Kind of annoying to have to use the ATM every time I go, but definitely worth it. Also if you go on the weekends be prepared to wait in a line. They're pretty efficient and it's not as menacing as it looks but it can still take awhile. When I go before work during the week it usually takes less than five minutes.

Staff takes orders throughout and by the time you get up to the register to pay, your bagel is hopefully done or close to being done. While you wait in line, you can peer through the glass at the bagel makers hard at work, like a culinary zoo! A bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel is something I must get every trip to the city. It wasn't bad but not the best I've ever had. I maybe would've considered ordering something else but all the chaos didn't really allow time to peruse a menu.It's cash only and they have an ATM for those that forget. I'm by no means a bagel expert but it definitely hits the spot and it's cool to see them prepare the bagels before your eyes. I'd stick to this place on the weekdays when it's not so crazy.

The variety of cream cheese here, and the freshly baked, warm, crispy taste of the bagels (sesame is my favorite), make this place worthwhile. With that said, the wait here is crazy, and honestly, given that there are other spots in the general vicinity that are equally good  (David's on 1st Avenue is one example), it's sometimes hard to justify the time spent waiting here.

I decided to venture out and get the French Toast bagel with confetti cream cheese...OMG...it was heavenly.  The crunch of the French Toast bagel was wonderful and you can taste a bit of salt that they added to it which just makes it even more flavorful.",3,1,2

Since I wanted to have a full experience here at Tompkins I Ordered a breakfast bagel sandwich (I ordered the Koch) which contains spicy salami I think, egg, onions, and I added cheese. The bagel was quite bland for me actually, i felt like it wasn't salty enough and the only thing adding flavour to the bagel was the salty meat. The bagel actually fell apart. It was already cut in half but that damn bagel was so big and al the meat stuck on one piece and the other side crashed like my dreaaaams of a good tasting bagel. I keep telling myself it could be that because I'm Chinese and our culture loves salty food especially where I'm from, my taste buds don't react much to the bagel. It tastes bland to me and idk the reason why. Debating if I should come back or not, but if I do I'll probably just get their French toast bagel with sweet cream cheese",3,,1

Updated review",This bagel shop is purely average and could make many adjustments to make it better. It's unfortunate that there are problems that could be easily fixed because I heard this used to be a great place. 1) Saturday and Sunday the lines are extremely long and the service is very slow about 25minute waits2) Typically the person taking the orders is rude doesn't explain to you what is offered if you are new to the shop. They should do something like Chopt where they haven menus on the line so you can see what you want instead of having to squint at the sign.3) in regards to cost I compared it with competitors there are many bagel shops that are cheaper but what the owner compares himself to they are in line and sometimes more expensive4) The coffee here is just average as well I think this could be a quick easy fix to change brandsI reiterate my 3 star rating,7,6,7

Although the line was long, my order was taken right as I stepped in line by Frankie- the most welcoming host. I always order the same thing at every bagel shop: a toasted whole wheat bagel with veggie cream cheese. However, this time, I forgot to order it toasted. When I was almost at the cash register, I mentioned to Frankie that I had forgotten to get it toasted and whether or not it was still possible to get it done. Although my bagel was already made untoasted, Frankie was the sweetest and had the guys make me a whole other bagel, toasted. In the end, I ended up getting two bagels for the price of one. Incredible customer service on top of great bagels and cream cheese! Thank you Frankie!!!",,,

The staff takes extra care to avoid cross contamination.  If you have a real sensitivity and not just a dietary preference, be sure to let them know it's a ""gluten allergy"" when you're ordering, though, so that they don't toast them in the same toaster or prep them on the same counter.  [For reference:  I have medium-strong gluten sensitivity.  I definitely can't eat trace soy sauce or condiments with wheat in the ingredient list, though I've so far been okay with the shared fryer at a burger place.]",2,,1

These bagels are made fresh, and don't need to be toasted. they're fresh, and have a great texture and have enough natural toast on the outside. (it's not crispy on the outside, but it has a nice layer of toast). I've gotten the Weezer which I thought was solid, and the Moo which is different for breakfast.All in all, an amazing bagel. I recommend not getting your bagel toasted if you normally do because the bagels here are super fresh, and you're not supposed to toast them - it taints the doughiness of the bagel.  Would I say best bagel? Probably not - there's certainly a lot of hype but I think merited.",,,

You can probably roll in everyday for the rest of the year to try something new and still not run out of options. I will be back to try everything in due time. But there one thing that I LOVE about this place: that pastrami lox. In my opinion, it is far superior to ordinary lox. It's lox smoked like pastrami. What is not to love!? I feel like the essence of New York is wrapped up pastrami lox on an everything bagel. The service is so friendly and fast. I was in and out with my bagel in five minutes.

In the back, they take your food order and up front they take your drink order. I don't like ordering my meal in unnecessary increments at different locations. I found that to be a waste of time, which was extremely annoying. It should just be one central location to order from in the eatery, not multiple ones. And mind you, it was on a weekday.

It was a busy little spot, we got the pumpernickel with pumpkin cream cheese.  Nice chew, it's a good bagel and the cream cheese was good too.  Pretty sure pumpkin was a fall special.  But we kept on seeing people order the French toast bagel and it looked good and well we could eat another bagel so my bf went to go and get one (it's vacation!).  So we got the French toast with the regular cream cheese and dang that sugar crust on top, so good!  You can definitely tell the top from the bottom and save that top side for last because that is the best part! If you are in the East Village, stop by here for the French toast bagel!",,,
174,Alex P.,"Forest Hill, MD",218,1,3,3.0,7/29/2017,"Cozy place with delicious bagels. Got my typical everything bagel with cream cheese and it was good but I prefer copious amounts of cc and they almost gave me that.  Arik got bacon egg and cheese on everything bagel which was very very good, chewy bacon, gooey cheese, egg seemed real. Complaints: You have to see the barista for wifi code.. annoying. They have signs everywhere saying 'do not bring in outside food'.. one would have sufficed, assholes. And THE COFFEE IS STRAIGHT ASS. YOU ARE A BAGEL PLACE HOW DO YOU MESS UP COFFEE. Mgmt needs to get on that asap.Would recommend as long as you aren't a coffee drinker.",,,
175,Alyssa R.,"Brooklyn, NY",652,1111,2729,5.0,9/23/2015,"So what do you get when you take a freshly made french toast bagel, toasted lightly and add a generous schmear of birthday cake cream cheese?  You get one of the best darn bagels I've ever had.No, really, I mean it.  Huge, deliciously chewy cinnamony bagel with fat sugar crystals baked to the top and cream cheese that tastes like a funfetti cake - sprinkles and all.  I was worried that the entire meal might be too sweet - but neither the bagel or cream cheese was too sugary.  I can't think of a better combination.*I need to visit the East Village more often... ----------------------------------------*This particular combination was a total of $5.25.  Bagel was $2.25 alone (less fancy bagels are $1.25 I think) plus a few dollars for the cream cheese.",,,

Next time I'll try a more adventurous cream cheese on the menu.",,,

179,Emily K.,"New York, NY",4,28,0,4.0,9/26/2017,Lines are long but worth the wait! Each time I came here the bagels have been fresh and very filling.

180,Christianne F.,"Long Beach, CA",201,506,1987,3.0,4/15/2015,"Today my heart was broken.  I love their salmon on their excellent everything bagel and I was soooo excited to get it with their scallion cream cheese spread which the worker recommended, but when I peeled back the white paper wrapping, my heart sank to see that there were no scallions and it was too late to go back. Quite frankly, I'd like all the spreads in one bagel because they all looked sooo delicious.    Next time I'll add red onions and capers too.Cash only!",2,1,1
181,Jessica C.,"Queens, NY",144,243,151,4.0,4/11/2016,"If you're coming on a weekend be prepared for a line which is standard for any well known bagel place in the city. They have someone taking your order as you wait so that kind of speeds up the process. Honestly figuring out the prices of things is a little difficult since the line goes around the store and they only have the menu up in the front. So it's good to have an idea of what you want to get! The cream cheese options are out of control and all sound delicious! They also do run out of bagels and toppings so be prepared and have second choices ready.First time i got a cinnamon raisin bagel with berry cream cheese and it was good. I was disappointed the french toast bagel was sold out ]: so get there early ppl. the cream cheese actually had full black berries inside! My friends got everything bagels with either lox with everything or bacon egg and cheeses. Looked and smelled delicious!I went back for an everything bagel with lox, cream cheese, tomatoes and onions. The bagels are warm. they give a generous amount of lox and portions are standard to just a bit above average. The prices are pretty standard for a new york bagel place. Ive had my fair share of new york bagels such as sadelles and black seed but tompkins square bagels are still my go to favorite.",2,,2
182,Nick P.,"Fishers, IN",3,21,1,1.0,5/21/2017,"Very unfortunately, this location has devolved completely in the last few months. The line is physically less long, but they now operate at about 1/2 the speed. The theory of my friends and I is that the sent their best people to the new location. The register is oftentimes left unmanned with a long line. The bagels have remained largely the same, but the toppings for sandwiches has been largely reduced. I ordered a sandwich that came with two, maybe three, thin slices of turkey while my room mates sandwich came with a whisper of cream cheese. These have been very consistent mistakes the last four or five times we've visited.The backorder is so long, you barely have a chance at warm food. The wait is consistently 30 minutes in a line that would have in the last taken 10 minutes. It's very sad to see the place go down like this.My friends and I who live on the block have come here with almost a ritualistic devotion, but lately we are losing our religion.",,,
183,Alyssa B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",69,26,30,4.0,9/25/2016,Pretty quick service- hated getting money out of the atm but what can ya do?? The tofu cream cheese was divine but I wish they had more creative tofu flavors. The whole wheat everything bagel was so fresh and perfect but... no duh... this is a bagel joint... that was expected.,,,
184,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",285,201,532,4.0,3/3/2016,"When people ask me where my favorite place to get a bagel in NYC is, lately I'll say here.  There are plenty of bagel places in NYC, and lots of them are good (also lots of them are not so good) but I feel like TSB has been consistently good, and they have a large, interesting menu.  On weekends they tend to get very busy.  Luckily I've never been there when the line has been out the door, but when I've left it has been. Their ordering system is pretty good, and they have people come walk the line taking your order. Then it's pretty much ready when you get up to the cashier to pay. One complaint though, would be that you can't really see the menu from the line. I can look it up on my phone, but I had missed that they had a new rainbow bagel last time I was there, and by the time I saw it I already had long ago ordered my bagel.. oh well, next time!  They have a variety of bagels and spreads. My original intent for going here was a few years ago when I feel like they were one of the firsts to have birthday cake cream cheese, and I had to have it!  Since then I've been back a bunch of times and tried different menu items. One of my favorite egg sandwiches is the Dylan with pesto, roasted pepper and mozzarella. Soooo good! And it was so big. I def ate half and saved the other half for a little late when I had more room. I don't think I've tried any fish options here.  I'm not really into lox, but I love whitefish, so I should give it a try sometime.  So like I said everything I've had has been really good!  The only complaints are the long lines, which only really prove how good they are, not being able to see the menu while in line, and cash only.  I mean it's a bagel so I'll usually have just enough for that, but generally cash only is a turn off to me. Not enough though to prevent me from going back!",3,2,3
185,Lindsey N.,"Austin, TX",260,47,79,5.0,9/20/2017,"TOMPKINS. SQUARE. BAGELS!!! When my friends and I visited New York, our place was right next to this glorious place. We literally ate this for breakfast everyday. Okay, well besides one day, we tried EssABagel. Tompkins Square Bagels is a lot better, don't go there. The French Toast bagel is to die for, especially with the strawberry cream cheese (which has real strawberries in it, yum!) My friend also got the apple cinnamon cream cheese and said it was good. Tasted like apple pie. My favorite bagel is the Everything bagel, SMOTHERED in cream cheese, which they do a great job at doing. The bagels are THICC and surprisingly would keep us full until even after lunch time. My friend couldn't' even finish all of her bagel some of the times. All we have back at home is Einsteins Bros and it will probably never satisfy us again knowing that we've eaten here everyday for a week. This place is bae goals (sorry, I had to). If you're not from New York, get yo bagels here and don't forget to bring your dolla dolla bill$$$$$ (because this place is cash only).",,,
186,Deborah M.,"Oxford, ME",13,28,22,4.0,4/2/2017,"Bagels were perfection. Slight crunch on outside, chewy on the inside. Little too much cream cheese for my own preference, I like to taste the bagel. The only reason for 4 stars instead of five is the fact they don't take cards.",,,
187,Naomi H.,"Soldotna, AK",52,32,5,4.0,9/30/2017,Amazing bagels. I didn't even mind the insanely long line - it moved quickly. The only thing I didn't like is that the server came to take my order before I could look at the menu - so I had to order blindly without knowing what was available. I would've ordered differently had I known what else was available.,,,
188,Sam L.,"Buffalo, NY",15,48,3,3.0,2/9/2017,"Not the best bagels in NYC and not the cheapest either. I like an airy bagel and these are quite gummy/chewy. We waited 20 minutes for a bagel BLT and another plain bagel. It looks better than it tastes and admittedly, we ventured here based on the pictures we'd seen online. I have a feeling most of the line was composed of the same origin.We were NOT here yesterday or within the last week, FYI.",1,,

One of the guys making bagels was extremely friendly asking if it was my firet time there and welcomed me. Loved that, and also cash only!!",,,
190,Sara S.,"Menlo Park, CA",636,585,967,3.0,3/23/2016,"This place was right across the street from my friend's apartment, so of course I had to stop by here for a good old NYC bagel. I came here twice because I enjoyed my bagels.The bagels and lox are so good but you pay a pretty price for lox. Each time my orders kept coming out to $15 for 2 bagels, but I think you have to add $5 for lox. I wish they were more clear on their pricing, it's not that obvious to me. I had the pretty (but plain) rainbow bagel. It's cool to look at. I also tried the whole wheat bagel which was better. My favorite spread was definitely the sun dried tomato. I tried the scallion + bacon, and then birthday cake as well, however, the scallion + bacon was too salty for me. The birthday cake was surprisingly not too sweet. I originally ordered it with the rainbow bagel for the novelty of it and was expecting a sugar overkill... I was pleasantly surprised-- it's just like a mildly sweet cream cheese with sprinkles. I'm not giving it a higher rating because of the service. Firstly, my friend who lives in NYC forgot her book here and they claimed to have it but then they lost it. Next, the order that they process the orders is questionable. Both times I've ordered, the people behind me got their bagels first. I don't consider my order to be extremely complicated. Then the last time I went, we waited for a longggg time and then they didn't even get our order right. My friend paid $2 extra for avocado and they didn't even put it on the sandwich. So we waited forever and were overcharged, all for the wrong sandwich. Then we had to catch a plane so we didn't even catch the mistake until it was too late. Merp. It's convenient and tasty, but there are tons of bagel places in NYC.",1,1,
191,Matt D.,"Saint Louis, MO",221,5,0,2.0,8/13/2017,"Extremely average bagel, seasoning, and cream cheese. Slow service. I guess it's cheap which is nice but you get what you pay for.

192,Leonard L.,"TriBeCa, Manhattan, NY",758,1415,4087,5.0,2/22/2015,"Tompkins Square BagelNY Manhattan East Village10:30am Sunday 23rd February 2015Five Stars (more like a constellation)There is no great way to get here by subway but we made the three avenue trek from the 6 train to have these fantastic hourly baked bagels. There was long line stretching to their snow covered patio but it moved rather quickly unlike Ess-A bagels from last week. There is no double toasting. Also no outside food or drink (I brought my DD coffee in anyways). We ordered 5 Bagels: 1) The Moo on an everything Bagel: Steak, Egg, and American Cheese (they say steak but it's roast beef).  The bagel was warm, doughy, slightly crisp, and absolutely packed with flavor. The topping was a majority poppy with smatterings of sesame, salt, and onion. The cheese delivered that classic Kraft-single-like taste. The eggs and beef were on point as well. 2) the Moo on a Salt Bagel. This bagel had the right amount of seasoning. The top had a better ratio but the bottom was not too overwhelming. Usually it's too much that you have to scrap the sodium off. 3) FRENCH TOAST Bagel with walnut and raisin cream cheese. This bagel was incredible! It captured all the right egg, sugar, vanilla flavors of its breakfast cousin but in bagel form. Plus it was cooked better than its brothers and sisters because it was crisper on the outside. You cannot come here and not get this hybrid treat. (Next time I am getting birthday cake spread)4) Pumpernickel Bagel with chocolate chip cookie dough spread. The bagel tasted of rye, had a heavier consistency and mildly sweet molasses flavor. The spread was packed with sugary, chocolate-y goodness. I wonder what ratio transforms cookie dough cheese cream to cake icing. 5) Healthy Egg Bagel with Chicken Sausage, Spinach, Egg White, and Onion. It was good. I don't have much to say about it since I dropped half of it on the floor. :(  Overall, Tompkins Square Bagels are the best in the city and no other place has even come close on BagelSunday.",1,1,1
193,Gina M.,"New York, NY",79,180,42,5.0,5/30/2015,"This place is delicious!

195,Anna M.,"New York, NY",247,6,2,5.0,7/30/2016,"So worth the half hour wait. Easily the best bagel I've ever had. Got the Sullivan (gravlax, dill cream cheese, cucumber and lemon on multigrain) and I'm still daydreaming about it. Tbh it was more of a religious experience eating that bagel than anything else. Ask my friends- I went silent for 5 minutes because I was too busy enjoying it to engage in conversation. They asked if I was okay. I didn't hear them. This bagel is that good. You can tell they put a ton of care into every ingredient and there's a ton of options. Plenty of fresh smoked fish, meats, veggies, cheeses, and spreads to choose from. My bagel came out to $13 which sounds pretty steep for a bagel, but it was so filling it carried me through breakfast and lunch so I'd say that's pretty worth it.  Take it to the park nearby to get the full experience whilst doing some grade A people watching. This was an extremely passionate review about a bagel so I may need to reevaluate my priorities. Tompkins, on the other hand, you keep doing your thing.",,,
196,Olivia D.,"New York, NY",258,103,121,4.0,12/23/2016,"The bagels are fresh - but they're overpriced and the line on weekend mornings wraps around the entire store. I give it a 4/5 because I order from here all the time, but lately the delivery orders are wrong, they leave out stuff - it may be because they're moving locations but for the price of their bagels and the amount of time you wait, it should be right 75% or more of the time. Yes this place has a lot of options but it's not the be all end all of bagel places in the east village. If another place opened, like black seed bagels on first, it would take their business once people figured out the bagels are pretty mediocre. Don't get me wrong - if you're craving a fresh bagel, this place is great - but it's not the best.",1,1,1
197,Mike R.,"New York, NY",101,402,2,4.0,5/13/2016,"As a lover of bagels, and also lox, I was told by a few co-workers over and over again to come here and try it. Finally one day I did it. Essentially a small looking deli that's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. When we got there on a Sunday, it was pretty packed with people and we waited in line for at least 20 minutes. Luckily we were able to get a table and eat it there.We got a few bagels as well as a regular lox sandwich plus some tuna one. The tuna one was pretty good but nothing to write home about. I'd probably put the bagels in my top 5, though not number 1, and the sandwich was pretty good too - probably the same rating. Pretty good and definitely above average, though I can't see spending more than 15 or 20 minutes in line for them. They're good but not out of this world good.",,,

199,Alan K.,"Monterey Park, CA",514,701,10,5.0,12/27/2015,"So this is what a REAAAAAL handmade and handrolled bagel tastes like.. FOOD QUALITY:I've never had a bagel that was soft and fluffy inside like fresh bread inside the interior that, with a small crisp outside, also tore easily with a good amount of elasticity. They give a LOT of cream cheese in the center, but after removing the excess of it and adding in smoked salmon and you get a really nice sweet, sour, salty, and smokey meltdown with a nice refreshing touch from the green onions -- all in one bite. The bagel, with all the components together, kind of felt like I was eating a miniature, freshly baked pizza that gives you that  ""yuuuuuuummmmmmmm"" satisfaction.ENVIRONMENT:Cramped. you'll be lucky to find a seat. So eat to go. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a bagel. And I'll be back.",2,1,2
