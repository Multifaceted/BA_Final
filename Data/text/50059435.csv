0,Michael L.,"Brooklyn, NY",260,12,1,5.0,1/27/2016,"I always enjoy my meals from Garden Grill. They have a large and expansive menu that you would expect from an American Diner, and their prices are very fair. The service is always top notch and they are always very warm and welcoming. The restaurant has a strong 'neighborhood-vibe' and everyone is usually in high spirits.  I also order delivery from here fairly often and the food comes very quickly. (usually within 30 minutes although I do only live 3 blocks away)  A great location in the neighborhood.",,,
1,Neil B.,"Brooklyn, NY",575,983,1098,3.0,10/31/2017,"Garden Grill is your standard old time diner. The staff is friendly (if you make the effort to be as well) and the coffee is hot. And on a Friday afternoon, it appeared that most of the customers were regulars from the neighborhood who had been coming for years as everyone was on a first name basis!As far as the food goes, I had a pastrami and cheese omelet and they allowed me to substitute the toast and home fries for a few slices of a tomato that was not exceptional (they definitely came out on top of that trade-off!). My omelet was rather bland but still good enough to eat! My friend has the fried appetizers platter that looked good but not too healthy! :-). The prices are very reasonable for a gentrified neighborhood.So if you are looking for a standard local diner in Williamsburg, Garden Grill is a good choice.",5,2,2
2,Auria C.,"Brooklyn, NY",438,77,29,1.0,2/27/2017,"An absolute travesty. Ordered a Mexican salad for myself. It came with practically whole chicken breast just thrown on top. It's a salad, guys. It's supposed to be easy to eat. The worst part was my husband's nicoise salad. They must think the ppl living in this area are a bunch of idiots. Nicoise salad should include a seared piece of tuna. These ppl literally opened up a can of bumblebee (if that) & threw it on top. It's so bad, it's insulting!",2,,
3,Danny V.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",946,131,34,1.0,2/1/2017,"Came in here for an espresso and an Americano, this proved to be too difficult of an order for the staff to handle. The espresso shot was extremely watery. The Americano was handed to us in a ridiculously tiny glass that was probably about 3 ounces. When we explained that this is not what an Americano is we were told that we were confused because of the small cup size. Nah.On top of all this staff was not apologetic nor receptive. I'll never come back.",2,1,
4,Tara C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",107,1,0,1.0,8/13/2017,"Normally I do not write reviews , I come on to yelp to read other peoples reviews before eating somewhere but I just recently made my first order with garden grill and i am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied. i placed an order for fries, a bagel, and a fruit bowl and i had an issue with each of these items. the fries were not fully cooked, the potatoes were still hard! my bagel was rubbery with barely any butter (it was dry) and i paid $5 and got 7 strawberries in a coffee mug (and they werent even organic). I barely touched my food and still have it with hopes that they would either replace my order or provide me with a refund. I was told no to getting a refund because whoever made my food said it was fine. I will never eat here again. I would not reccomend this resturant. save your money there are better deli's with better food and customer service in the area.",1,,

6,Jia L.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",0,4,0,1.0,5/25/2017,"Just had the worst service experience of my life! The coffee was included on the lunch menu, but the waitress charged me separately for it. When I pointed out the mistake on the bill, she refuses to acknowledge that she made the mistake. She also misinformed me about questions I had on the menu. The manager/owner was incredibly rude, not only he didn't apologize for the mistake, he persisted to argue with me. I understand mistakes happen, a simple apology would of been enough.  All I wanted was a easy casual diner experience, instead I was treated with rudeness and disrespect. Save to say that I would never return to this diner again. And they should definitely train the staffs better to avoid any future confusion!",2,1,

The atmosphere and experience not so much.  I was charged $2 for an extra honey mustard on my sons $11 kids meal.  After asking for 2nds in the sodas we received a nice dirty look from our waitress. She wasn't pleasant at all none of them were.",,,

But I don't have anything other to say than you guys are great. The staff is always amazing and so nice to me.. and when I order online it always comes super quick. Like a lot quicker than I expect. Always. This place been here for as long as I can remember and It's one of the places that never fell victim to gentrification. It's like a little trip down memory lane every time I eat there. All the birthdays and lunches and family dinners spent there. Please don't even close down.,1,,

My favorite thing to order from here are the French toast covered with bananas and Nutella and I add a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I also really like the French fries they're always cooked perfectly, they're not soggy or burnt but just perfect. The onion rings are also good, I guess you can say the food is just good. I only have one problem with the place and it's just that they have a rude staff, I've been here plenty of times and I have not met one nice waitress.",,,
11,Amber S.,"Brooklyn, NY",171,2,0,5.0,7/22/2017,"I have long loved this place, a 10 year Williamsburg resident. I work the night shift and recently tried to call in a breakfast order to Brooklyn Standard 2 via phone. The girl that answered the phone said ""um like okay, we're kinda busy right now. Can you place your order online? ""  I just called garden grill. The cheerful and old school disposition when they answer the phone never disappoints me. It's never a burden. And it's what an a good diner should be. Not everything is a signature frou frou dish but it's good no bs food when you're hungry. I love the staff there and they keep me coming back, delivery or drop in!",,,

But the food is sub par and not very thoughtfully executed. Yes, it could be said that it's 'only a diner,' and yet that's all the more reason the omelet should be better and the tomatoes fresher. On top of it, there's a huge tv dominating the main dining area and music blasting from the stereo, causing the volume to be oppressively loud.",,,
14,Brad B.,"Fairfax Station, VA",0,46,7,3.0,7/31/2016,"I went here on a Sunday morning for breakfast. No wait which was a plus. Immediately sat down and was served complimentary water. A waitress came over and took my drink order, which was Orange Juice. It came with pulp, which was a big turn-off for me. Another waitress came over and got my food order, a Western Omelette with white toast, home fries and sausage. She was obviously overwhelmed and that definitely showed attitude wise. Anyways food came and it was actually pretty good. Everything was perfectly cooked and had some pretty good take-out. A big downside was that the food was served on chipped plates, seriously? I don't really understand why a restaurant would be using chipped plates but whatever. At the end of the meal waitress gave me a second glass of orange juice just because I guess, she ends up spilling the whole glass all over the table when clearing my plate. It didn't get on me thankfully, but just clumsy service.I'd probably come back here whenever I'm back in town for breakfast or something if nothing else around was open.",,,
15,Jessica F.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,10,1,1.0,1/14/2017,"I ordered the Nachos Supreme for $9. Nachos, at the bare minimum, consist of tortilla chips, cheese, salsa, and sour cream. $9 nachos called ""Nachos Supreme"", should have AT LEAST those four things and be large, with a decent chip-to-topping ratio, ESPECIALLY when the description on GrubHub says that all those things are included.I received a large tin of tortilla chips with ONE slice of cold, dry, waxy, cheese on top and a few jalapenos scattered about. There was not any salsa or sour cream --not even in two tiny plastic cups in the bag. I ordered $9 ""Nachos Supreme"", and was given what looked like a poor attempt at a snack made by a hungry drunk person who had just come home to an empty kitchen. If I had wanted a bunch of tortilla chips with a sad slice of cheese on top, I would have bought it at the bodega for $1.50. Yes, I know that it is a cold, wet, Saturday night; but when customers pay for something, than you need to give them what they paid for. If you are out of certain items, than you call the customer and tell them so they can change the order. However, due the carelessness in the preparation, I highly doubt that the issue was that they were out of sour cream and salsa or even forgot to put it in the delivery bag; they were just being careless and lazy.",1,,

I go there somewhat often too, but it's a go-to for a hungover breakfast in bed.Typical diner food, so don't go in expecting haute cuisine, but anything I've had from Garden Grill is good. I am especially a fan of the Italian omelette for breakfast-related items.The only negative experience I have ever had is when requesting jalapenos on a Seamless order, in the comments box (as there was no ""add on"" box), they called me and told me they'd have to charge me an extra dollar, and made sure the delivery guy took it from me too. This was after about 18 months of ordering and visiting from the place, so it's not like I was a fly-by-night, take-what-I-can-get customer.",2,1,

Food was delivered and there was no Snapple, zucchini sticks, or mozzarella sticks, but about 5-10 minutes later the delivery guy came back--- with the Snapple only. Contacted GrubHub telling them about the various missing sticks and they called me back saying apparently this fucking place claims they gave me everything so they refuse the refund so GrubHub gave me a coupon instead. These motherfuckers have some nerve. PS the food sucked too (actually the chicken fingers were fine but you can't mess those up). I'm convinced all of their good reviews are fake.",2,1,

I'm sure that's the case elsewhere but perhaps not always the case in NYC or Brooklyn-Went here for breakfast and ordered french toast with sausage, juice, and coffee. Really enjoyed the sausage (thick stubby links a little bit rounder than a quarter). The French toast was perfect and the portions were appropriate for the price. My bill was just over $8 and I was stuffed. My review is 4 stars because it's a little too cramped. But I was sitting solo at a table so maybe booths are more comfortable. The bus boy kept walking past with the dirty dish bin over the table and the delivery guys were brushing past when they'd run in and out the back of the restaurant.",,,1

The food is good, portions are large, and the menu is extensive so there's something for everyone. The food is not hipster-cool or edgy or experimental, but it's solid. I was at a hipster diner the other day where I ordered waffles with fresh fruit and received one half a strawberry and one slice of melon on top of my waffle. At Garden Grill, however, the waffles with fresh fruit have a towering pile of berries on top of them. Fruit smoothies are made with real fruit and are large and fresh. It's great value for your money. And it feels nice to support a local business that really keeps it real. I would recommend this place if you want something straightforward and reliable.

39,TigersEye M.,"Accord, NY",2,26,46,1.0,4/16/2013,"Are you fucking kidding me Garden Grill? My husband and I gave this place not one, but three different chances and it ended horribly. The first time we went was for an early dinner; I had the Monte Christo sandwich and he had a burger and fries. My Monte Christo was merely ok, and I've definitely had much better. There was only turkey, no ham, and the turkey was very dry and over cooked. Luckily they serve it with cranberry sauce on the side, which I slathered on to try to give the turkey some moisture. My husbands burger was overlooked, but not terribly bad. We also ordered wings as an appetizer, and they were pretty decent. We decided that all in all it wasn't that bad, and the price was ok, so maybe we'd come back and try breakfast sometime.Came back for breakfast, both ordered the 2 egg special. The waitress was a bit overconfident and decided she didn't need to write down our order, but then asked us to repeat them, as she got easily confused. Whatevs, at least the order came out correct. I ordered ham with mine, which was the awful square-shaped, cheap-ass deli ham that no one eats and the deli peddles for pennies; no Virginia and/or breakfast ham here! Since everything else besides the ham was ok, we concluded that maybe this place wasn't so bad for breakfast and we'd be back to try other breakfast options. BIG mistake.The third time was anything but a charm. The waitress took our order fairly quickly, but the amount of time we waited for our food was atrocious. I literally watched at least 3 different tables, all of which arrived way after my husband and I, get served their food before us. If we had ordered something complicated I might understand, but our orders were very simple; a two egg special and pancakes. I could cook the same meal in 5 minutes blindfolded. When we finally caught the attention of our frantic and un-attentive waitress and got her her over to our table to ask what was going on with our food, she quickly, and rudely stated ""yea I just asked the kitchen,"" then literally ran away before we had a chance to say anything else. To be completely honest, I'm convinced that she didn't even out our order in until that exact moment.After waiting another 10 minutes we decided to say fuck it, and leave. Since we're not complete assholes we went to the front counter and offered to pay for just our coffees. The guy at the counter was less interested in what occurred and more interested what table we were seated at. We told him 3 different times, in threes different ways ""table 7, right there dude!"" the table was 4 feet away. At this point the manager came up as he overheard that we were leaving, and stated ""but it's ready, you don't want it?"" We replied ""no thanks, we've watched too many people who came in after us get served before us, we'd just like to leave. Thank you."" Awful, no good, terrible service. Wasted time and wasted money.

The guy who takes phone orders is really nice.I came in the day after Halloween with my friend for a hungover brunch..I ordered half a cantaloupe to start, it was not ripe at all and for $5 I had to send it back..which was not a problem. Our server was a little impatient, but nice at the same time..she was confusing us with her on and off attitude. My food was OK. It was more my friend's order that was screwed up, first off the server got the order completely wrong...she ordered eggs with a side of corned beef hash. Out came some kind of omelet with ham and swiss...sent it back. When the correct one came out, it didn't look very appetizing..and it wasn't. I tried the corned beef hash, which was super bland.

Williamsburg diner fare.After being awoken by the church bells, at around 9:30 on a Sunday morning, the gf and I rose ravenous from a night of drinking late into the evening(early morning). Looking on seamless for breakfast we found the garden grill. seemed to be breakfast-y and would do the trick. Ordered two eggs scrambled + american cheese and sausage. Also got the goat cheese, avocado, and tomato omelette with a side of corned beef hash. The two scrambled eggs were okay with two slices of generic american melted on top. Kraft singles they were not. The two sausages were thick and worth the addition of a $1.50. Home fries were mediocre as well.The omelette itself was slathered in goat cheese. like we're talking 50% egg, 50% goat cheese. I was appreciative of the amount in there but ended up scraping a bunch off to eat with toast instead. It just overpowered the eggs, avocado and tomatos. The fries that came were the kind that comes out of a frozen bag.The corned beef hash side for $4 was well portioned but pretty gross. It tasted of old frying oil, which is quite concerning because it was 9:30 in the morning - so how come it tasted that way? Also, pretty sure this was also of the canned variety.Not the worst, and simply not that great. The Garden Grill will do, as many have said, for the drunk and lazy. Foodies look elsewhere.",,,

Judge if you must.Anyway, the food is essentially your standard diner fare - greasy and comforting. They have delicious omelettes, fries, waffles, pancakes, milkshakes. I'm also a fan of their paninis - the Philly cheese steak, to be specific. It's a heart attack in a box, but sometimes a heart attack is exactly what you want. The Reuben panini is not half bad, either.The strawberry / nutella / banana crepe deserves a separate paragraph for its sweet, gooey, hazelnutty glory.Delivery is usually prompt, except on New Year's Day when it took over 2 hours. I guess I wasn't the only hungover wreck craving eggs and waffles.",1,,

46,Ashlee E.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,54,3,5.0,3/27/2015,"This place is one of my favorite places to get food from. They have delicious food all around. My favorite part of their menu is the breakfast, and it's out of this world. The chocolate chip pancakes are to die for, and their breakfast sausage is amazing. The kitchen staff are also good with making changes to your order, I ordered a couple of bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches and asked for mayonnaise and barbeque sauce to be added on the bread and they did so without charging me extra. They called me just to make sure it wasn't a mistake, because it's a weird request, but once confirmed they had no problem. By the way, you should totally try their bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches with the mayonnaise and barbeque sauce because they're bomb. I know it sounds weird, but they're soooooo good!",,,

The following four points are what made me so pleased: (1)  They had it decorated really well for the fall.  I know that that shouldn't mean a lot, but I like a place with a little flair -- this made it kind of homey and put me into a good mood. (2)  Can I just say that my waitress was FANTASTIC?  She was cheerful, attentive, and accommodating-- I am trying to do this paleo thing since I've been CrossFitting, and she suggested that I swap out my toast and hashbrowns for fresh tomatoes.  It was really sweet!  (3)  I had one of the best omelettes of my life (jalepeno and avocado)... for, like, SIX DOLLARS.  (Omelettes are one of those things that taste so much better when someone else makes them for you.  And this one was outstanding.  AND CHEAP!)(4)  They have really good smoothies here.  I was able to get an all-fruit smoothie and it was just top-notch.  I feel as if diner-like places usually don't have things like fresh fruit smoothies made to order.I will definitely be coming back here.  They had an extensive menu, and everything on the menu is served all day!  (EXCEPT for the oatmeal, I was told.)  Added plus!!  I'm glad I didn't pass it by-- and next time we leave our gas stove on (ha... let's hope that doesn't happen again...)

93,Christopher G.,"Manhattan, NY",22,50,0,4.0,12/31/2009,"The name Garden Grill is slightly misleading. I didn't venture in based on the fact that I suspected it to be some sort of salad shop, or some other leafy establishment wrapped up in pita. Alas, I was wrong. Garden Grill is a fairly typical diner and a much better option that Union Avenue's overpriced and terribly serviced Kellogg's Diner. Everybody here is extremely friendly and knows your name only after a couple of visits. Everybody makes you feel at home, which is always nice. You kind of feel like the mayor walking in, (Bloomberg actually has been here, you can see his picture on the wall shaking the hand of Gus, the owner) you are greeted so well. Speaking of Gus, he is a super nice guy, don't let his brusque yelling of orders into the back kitchen scare you away. The prices are right, the food is good and the portions are perfect. Don't leave without getting a donut, or Cinnamon bun. Their pastries and such are amazing, fresh from an Astoria bakery. Only 4 stars because the coffee isn't great, but no diner coffee is, usually burnt, watery, and bad flavor. The guy who refills the water can be a bit overwhelming at times. He refills your glass pretty much after every sip. If you are lifting a fork to your mouth and your glass has a sip taken from it he will put that water carafe right between your lifted fork and mouth to refill the water as if his life depends on keeping that glass full. Sometimes I feel like telling him just to sit down at my table because he is refilling my glass so frequently. If you come in and just have water to drink you are sometimes given another larger glass of water, but you can never get to it because the guy keeps filling the smaller glass regardless of the fact that you have a giant water glass waiting for you. Something that also bothers me is that Stephanie was fired for some reason. She was the best waitress ever and an awesome person.",,,

97,Kari A.,"Croton-on-Hudson, NY",0,8,0,1.0,3/4/2012,"I have been ordering delivery or visiting garden grill about once a week for about 2 years.  At the beginning, I always had good experiences, but over the last few times we ordered the service has been horrible.  The first bad experience the delivery man threw my food when my dachshund ran out the door barking at him.  I understand a dog is running at you, and you may be afraid... but it's a 10 lb dog, not a pittbull.  The next time they delivered, the delivery guy called me and made come downstairs to get my food because ""my buzzer wasn't working"".  Oddly enough, the buzzer worked just fine right before and after his visit.  After I angrily came downstairs and he said ""your buzzer isn't working?"" and my response was ""it works just fine"" he was like ""oh I would have come up.""  I just chalked this up to an idiot... But this experience today was the absolute worst.  I called and placed an order at 11:30, by 12:30 I called to find out where my food was, and was told the guy was ""just leaving now"".  By the time my food came at 12:45, everything was ice cold, and the cheese in my grilled cheese had congealed.  When I called to complain, I was told another story that the guy had ""four or five deliveries"".  Where were these deliveries?  Cause a grilled cheese certainly doesn't congeal in 20 minutes.  So what was it, was he just leaving at 12:30, or had he been wandering the streets of Brooklyn making deliveries with my food for the past 30-45 minutes?Overall, the food isn't that great to have to deal with such crummy service.  I'll just order from double rose going forward.",,,

Today, however, was very different. I ended up cancelling my order due to their incompetence.Ordered an egg sandwich, coffee, and fries; quoted a 45-60 mins delivery time.  After about hr and a half, I call to check the status and am told it's out for delivery.  45 mins later no food, so I call again.  At this point, they admit that the order was skipped and they'll rush it out.  I get a call about 15 mins after that confirming my cross-streets, so I'm thinking I should have my food soon.  Well, I don't; after another 45 mins of waiting (which brings my total to 3 hrs) I finally decide to cancel.  However, the driver still showed up (he didn't get the call to cancel the order until he was at my door) which meant I was still dealing with this mess after I really just wanted to be done with it. Absolutely ridiculous.  Also, at that point, just comp me my order.  It's a small order and wouldn't have really cost the restaurant anything, especially since they obviously already filled the order.There are numerous other options for the same food. Choose one of those.",,,

109,Samantha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,20,0,1.0,9/27/2008,"Eating at the Garden Grill was a very memorable experience, but not at all in a good way.  We headed over there at around 5pm today, because I had a craving for some cheap diner eats. It was the first time we went there, and most certainly the last.I ordered an egg and cheese and bacon sandwich and a milk shake, and my boyfriend ordered a pastrami sandwich.  The food came out quickly, which would be a bonus if it weren't so terrible.  Both sandwiches were skimpy and flavorless.  The bacon in my sandwich hurt my mouth. My boyfriend's pastrami sandwich was a corned beef sandwich.  Then we got the bill, and that's when things got out of hand.My egg and cheese sandwich was $1.50 more than the listed price, so when the waitress came back i pointed this out to her.  She responded by making some excuse about how she had given me two eggs and that was why she charged me more.  I should make it clear that I never asked for two eggs, she never told me that was what she was giving me, and the menu did not indicate any price difference for that to begin with. With a tone of bitterness, she agreed to correct the bill.  When she came back with the new bill, she had double charged us for the egg and cheese sandwich, bringing an already incorrect bill of $14 to $19.  When we tried to point it out to her, she brushed us off and walked to the other side of the restaurant.  Despite being put off by the experience, we paid what we actually owed, and even left a tip, bringing it to a total of about $17.  We left the place with very unpleasant feeling.  A few minutes later, we were about 5 blocks south on Graham ave. A red car pulled up, and who should emerege from it but our crabby waitress from the garden grill.  She had FOLLOWED us, which is very weird for a lot of reasons, but especially notable because we had stopped off at another store along the way.  She came out of her car, yelling at us about how we had underpaid.  My boyfriend tried to point out the obvious mistake on the bill (that we were charged for the sandwich twice), but she wouldn't have it.  I just kept walking because there was obviously no way to have a rationale dealing with such a person.  My boyfriend made an effort, but walked off in my direction because he realized it was a waste of time.  We were both quite shocked by the whole expereience.Honestly, I would discourage anyone from going to this place.  The food is really sub par, and the atmosphere is bad because of the shitty attitude of the employees.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Not at all worth getting followed home....",4,1,1

As we sat the waitress was pouring our water and asking if we want coffee. 6 seconds later we have full coffee cups. This is just a happy place. The food is great, as is the service. They slide the pick-up orders down the counter to the customers, sometimes. I love the home fries. I didn't know you could still get them like this anymore. They remind of when I was a kid. They come out glowing reddish-orange from the paprika and they are cooked slightly over done.
