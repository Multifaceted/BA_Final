1,Elise K.,"Philadelphia, PA",178,270,14,4.0,10/22/2018,My boyfriend and I liked sitting at the bar area for a football game/TV event. Beers on tap were good and so were the french fries we had. Like the vibe in here for drinks. Liz is an awesome bartender too!,,,
2,Joy T.,"New York, NY",57,5,5,1.0,10/27/2018,"I went to Redemption Thursday night with a friend and was ignored by the female bartender. My friend and I sat at the bar for over 20 minutes and was never waited on. Another customer noticed that we were being ignored and tried to asked the bartender to bring us menus. Despite his attempts we were never waited on. In fact, other customers that came after us were helped. My friend and I finally left. I refuse to spend my money in an establishment that doesn't want me there. I'll never go to this restaurant/bar again.",1,,
3,Belle B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,27,130,2.0,8/26/2018,"I was there around 3pm on a Saturday to watch some game. Bar was almost empty so I could ask them to turn on what I wanted to watch so that was great. Beer list they have is underwhelming and draft beer they serve taste waterdown.. I seriously never seen a sports bar serving Guiness on none-Guiness glass.. and it tasted waterdown to the point where Guinness' thick and creaminess were nonexistent..... no angel-ring appeared after taking sips... Beer companies that distribute to this bar should really do quality control on their beer... 0 star for beer & food, 1 star for just ok service and 1 star for the game I could watch..",,,
4,Laura K.,"New York, NY",143,79,60,4.0,4/3/2018,"Redemption offers pretty good weekly deals and happy hour. We went on Monday which was $5 draft and free fries with sandwiches. The place has a good amount of space for groups, so that's a plus!A few issues: they were out of a lot of their drafts. No IPAs and no stella. Their sangria deal is 2 for $12 (2 for 1), which honestly isn't really a deal because they're pretty small. But they're tasty. The buffalo sandwich was very good. And the happy hour nachos were a huge hit with my friends and I. Overall a good spot, but their selection is somewhat limited with draft beers and their drink deals are good but not great.",1,,
5,Brian M.,"New York, NY",107,249,389,4.0,7/3/2018,Loved it. Great burgers and beers. Dog friendly outside and great staff. A bit loud but that adds to the feel. I highly recommend the place for dinner or lunch you won't be disappointed. Enjoy yourself people watching.,2,,1
6,Ju J.,"Queens, NY",120,35,56,1.0,4/19/2018,"***********DISCLAIMER **********IF U COME HERE ONLY DRINK BEER AND WINESo I came here for happy hour after a long day of work. We were here a year ago and had a great time. Thursday happy hour is only $6 stoli cocktails and draft beer. My order:Chicken nachos;Chicken was bland, the jalapeños were sweet with a hint of cinnamon,cheese taste of like craft, the chips were hard and extra thick.2 for 1 sangria for $12; I got the white sangria and it tasted like piss water no wine no liquor. I don't even understand what's in itMy boyfriend ordered the spicy pineapple mojoito and we received two appetizers and two round of drinks before they even made his drink due to the lack of ingredients and they still was missing an ingredient.I will say the BEST thing here are the sweet potato fries. They're great they're hot their crispy.Ps ; The lemonade drink is good; great lemonade you don't taste any alcohol.",,,

Updated review",On a recent trip to Memorial Sloan Kettering we enjoyed a lunch at Redemption. Monday's special is fries with an order of a sandwich or burger. Additionally they have a $5 draft special but we had to pass on that. I ordered the braised beef grilled cheese and was satisfied with the flavor but not over the top. My mother ordered the chimichurri steak sandwich and was very pleased with the quality of the meat and the flavor of the chimichurri. The atmosphere is casual with televisions playing music videos and only a few patroons at tables and the bar. Another visit to Sloan brought us back here for another lunch. This time we a enjoyed delicious nacho app that was only $6. This time we had the Cuban and a Sante Fe salad. Both were yummy.,,,
8,Anton G.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,59,22,3.0,4/21/2018,"Great happy hour specials for the midtown after work crowd. Sufficient TVs for a sports bar. Food was nothing special. Good seating options at the bar,  high tops or regular tables in the back. Not great for handicap accessibility as the bathroom is downstairs.",,,

10,Edgardo Z.,"New York, NY",30,72,27,4.0,5/5/2018,Nothing special but bar food and drinks. The food was pretty good and the drinks weren't bad either. Good midtown location but you have to get there at a decent time if you coming for happy hour because it fills up quick.,,,
11,Laylee A.,"Mount Vernon, NY",0,3,0,1.0,8/11/2018,This place is basically a whorehouse. The waitresses are super tacky. Service is absolutely horrible!!  The waitresses are too busy throwing themselves at men to get tips. Not a female friendly restaurant. The food was ok but took literally forever to get to us. Not cool.,,,
12,Pavlos R.,"New York, NY",11,15,0,2.0,9/27/2018,Not so good. Beer was warm and they don't have many options. The beef sliders were $16.5 but they were pretty basic.,,,
13,Carl E.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,28,59,4.0,3/26/2018,This was a celebration for my brothers bday. We got there late but still made it in time to enjoy ourselves. I've been here before but for brunch. I was wondering what the night life was about. As soon as I got there with my gf my brothers and friends were waiting for us to take shots. The Dj was on point from start to finish. We were sing and dancing and enjoying ourselves. We didn't make in time for the food but I heard it was great the drinks was well made redemption is a great place durning the day & at night!,,,
14,Gabby M.,"Manhattan, NY",182,20,13,5.0,6/21/2018,"Came here for Sunday brunch. They have a $15 unlimited option and you can get Bloody Mary, mimosa, screwdriver or bud lite for an hour and a half when you order an entree. The waitress was super attentive and our glasses were never empty. all the girls were very easy on the eyes as well!! The short rib grilled cheese was delicious, and melted in my mouth. Madison our bartender was amazing and the managers Isa and Chyna were  so nice!",,,
15,Lindsey D.,"New York, NY",357,159,87,4.0,12/5/2017,Great brunch spot in NYC! Love their breakfast and their unlimited mimosas deal. Can get a little loud but is always a good time with great service! I always get the bacon omelette but unfortunately they do not have gluten free bread - as I have a gluten allergy. I would recommend this place for a Saturday brunch though!,,,

Updated review","If you are planning to grab a quick bite to eat, i do not suggest coming here.  Came with my coworkers for lunch and ended up waiting 45 mins for just our food to come out despite not that many people at the place.  The waitress did notice that our food was taking awhile and offered chips and salsa on the house.  Overall the service is quite slow here.Food:I got the portabella mushroom sandwhich on foccacia. This sandwhich is pretty good since they give a good amount of goat cheese, which i lovee. Had the sweet potato fries which were nice and crispy.  My coworker did get the tator tots which were nice and crispy, but hugee mounds were stuck together. It seemed that the tots got squished together and then friend.  It was not pleasant.",1,,
20,Kasey B.,"New York, NY",65,40,35,1.0,6/12/2018,"My friend and I came in here last Friday night and both ordered our usual drink of vodka sodas.  We took one sip of the drink and it was immediately clear that the drinks were made with water and not soda.  When we let the bartender know that the drinks tasted like water and that their soda might need to be changed she immediately said ""the drinks are just weak, if you want I can make you doubles.""  We said no, that's not the problem, there was clearly actual water in our drinks.  She then used the gun to pour some soda water and there were the tiniest amount of bubbles present.  She pointed at it (without bothering to taste it at all) and said ""see it's fine- there's nothing wrong with it, but I can make you a double.""  When I mentioned she could just re-make the drinks in case water was used by accident she refused and again reiterated that we could order doubles.  It was the most mind-boggling interaction I've ever had.  At that point we said we didn't want the drinks and just preferred to go elsewhere, so my friend asked for his card back.  Imagine his shock when he saw that she had the audacity to charge us for the drinks.  For a quick second I thought maybe it was an honest mistake, but then he realized after the charge cleared that she had also ADDED A FIVE DOLLAR TIP.  My friend has disputed the charge- so I will update this review to clarify whether this ridiculous situation gets rectified.",2,,
21,Mackenzie B.,"New York, NY",191,49,39,3.0,4/14/2018,"Came here for the 2 for 1 sangria deal and honestly was given glasses of white wine with a couple of apple chunks tossed into it, and they only had white and not a red option while we were there. So I'm not sure that was worth the $12 deal because I definitely would be bummed if I payed $12 for just one of those. Service was good and staff was friendly, no complaints there. Decor had a nice rustic vibe to it and there was tons of TVs to watch games on. I got the boneless redemption wings and they were really delicious, and everyone else's food looked really good too. Nothing above average but I had a nice meal and a nice time here!",,,
22,Buddy G.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",2,141,26,2.0,2/20/2018,"Came in here around 11pm on a Tuesday, not much going on as you might expect.  Hip hop on the radio, asked for a prima pils which was on the draft list, but got a bottle instead.  No big deal, except the fact that it was $9!  After a handful of nice craft beers at nicer places in the neighborhood a bit of a surprise.  Shitty vibe unless you're a Redskins fan on Sunday if they win I guess.  They have a frozen daiquiri machine, nuff said.  Whatever place, no soul.",,,

28,Jessyca E.,"Bronx, NY",117,5,0,1.0,2/25/2018,Do not go here!! The food is over priced. The drinks are over priced. You will never get good service because the girls are too busy taking shots or taking selfies. Wont be wasting my money here again! Redemption you are horrible.,,,
29,Tessa D.,"Back Bay, Boston, MA",270,237,584,2.0,6/17/2015,"Stopped by with my boyfriend after he got off work, it'd been a long day so we were just looking for somewhere to chill and have a few drinks. We happened to pass by Redemption as we were walking back to his place, and after a few minutes of standing around we decided to check it out. There was a pretty small crowd considering the hour, but I preferred that. I can handle a busy bar around 10 PM, but 5 in the afternoon? No thanks.First off, the music choices are atrocious. The sound system is awful, and you can't even properly hear what's being played. The table we were sat at was stationed near a wall and I was having some extreme difficulties fitting. I'm about six feet tall WITHOUT heels, so considering I was wearing them that day my legs literally had nowhere to go. And the service is pretty bad, if we hadn't ordered everything we wanted in bulk I doubt we would've gotten more than a beer each. After our first round of beers we got the spinach artichoke dip and the french dip sliders to share. The artichoke dip was pretty good and was probably the most positive thing I can say about Redemption. It does not come with pita bread like the menu says, but with chips. The french dip sliders were absolutely horrendous. My boyfriend had a bite of his and nearly spit it out. I managed to eat one, but had I not been as hungry as I was I definitely wouldn't have. The meat tasted off and the au jus was nasty. The sliders actually turned us off to the experience altogether and we left soon afterwards.",3,2,1

It gets busy on Thursday/Friday evenings and the outside seating area is packed if it's nice out, so try to arrive sooner rather than later.I took up on their 2 for $12 sangria special - pretty decent, and enough to give me a nice buzz. Just know that it's 2 sangrias per person (so you can't split the deal with a friend, it's more like a packaged deal)We also got their nacho fries - typical bar food: not impressive, but nice to have around and enjoy with a couple drinks!",3,,2

32,Tariq A.,"Potomac, MD",167,109,49,4.0,11/13/2017,We were in NYC for the weekend and as Redskins fans were looking for a place to watch the game. This was fun and alive. Service was a little slow but it was a packed house!,,,
33,Barry G.,"Charlotte, NC",264,160,61,5.0,8/30/2016,"One word to describe this place for me: home. Atleast during foorball season this is where I arrive promptly an hour and change before the game, unwind and meditate before I either scream or cheer at the numerous screens avaialble with my fellow Redskins fans. I've had the burger and the pizza and both are great! Beer and specials are nice too! As a product of Richmond, VA, we dont have a pro football team so we cling to the burgundy and gold. There are tons of regulars and it is truly tailgaiting at it's finest, right here in the Big Apple! HAIL! Two thumbs up over here!",,,

Updated review",I've been back twice for dinner since writing my original review. Everyone I've gone with has had great meals.  I would definitely recommend the fries and grilled cheese.  Plus they have a great sangria deal (2 for 1 every day of the week!).  I also enjoyed the throwback music videos they were playing during my last visit.  Redemption has become one of my favorite places in the area!,,,

38,Dan L.,"Darien, CT",4,3,0,5.0,6/8/2017,"My passion for Redemption runs deep. If you're looking for a place to mosey into on a Saturday morning, potentially feeling a big unwell from the night prior, look no further. It brings a smile to my face remembering how many mornings my friends and I would go to Redemption, and have it be a wonderful kick-off to a Summer Saturday in NYC.From the ""Breakfast Pizza"" (Brekky-Pizza), to the aptly named ""Cure"", you will not leave Redemption without a stomach full of tasty food and, if you so choose, mimosas / bloody mary's. And to boot, it isn't a wallop on your wallet, unlike so many NYC brunch options.You might walk in, see the TVs playing music videos from the mid-2000's, hear the speakers playing that music a shade too loud, and think this isn't the place for you. You are wrong, my friend. It is a little slice of heaven, situated in midtown east.In all seriousness, I love Redemption. If you go in expecting Eleven Madison Park, sure, you might not get what you want. But if you want a reasonably priced sports bar, that is easy to roll through with a group of friends without a reservation, look no further.",2,1,1
39,Charles H.,"Norfolk, VA",14,36,21,4.0,8/10/2016,"I'm a die hard Redskins fan and I'm so glad I found this place when I moved to NYC. I think watchin a game here is the next best thing to being a FedEx Field. Noted, I've only been to this bar during Redskins games but every time I come I have a blast. The patrons get rowdy and if you're not a Redskins fan then I'd steer clear during game day. If you are a Redskins fan then I can't recommend this place enough. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because the food. It smells good, looks good, and even tastes good, but it will tear you up every single time. My fiancée and I would get home after games every Sunday and feel like crap and assumed we had too much to drink. One Sunday we didn't get anything to eat and felt like a million bucks when we got home. Since then we never eat here. Also, the DJ had a ton of problems for the 2nd half of the season last year. We'd have days where the audio was in and out and then days where there was no music during commercials.In conclusion, this is an amazing place to watch a Redskins game and drink some beers, just make sure you head over to the pizza shop next door or Lenwich across 2nd Ave if you get hungry.",,,

I ended up not finishing even half of the salad. But then again, I wasn't that hungry. Bottomless mimosas/bloody marys/screwdrivers was pretty awesome deal actually.. I got mimosas mainly and I liked screwdrivers that my friends got as well. The service here was terrible, however, and that is the main issue I had. The waitress was nice...? I guess... but just really bad at coming by. None of the waitresses were friendly and didn't even acknowledge us, and it was just a very weird experience since it wasn't even that busy...! I had to wait for soo long to order because she was helping out mainly the other table next to us- I think they might have been the waitress's friends but it was a little ridiculous how hard I had to try to finally get her attention to order the food and bottomless after sitting for 30 minutes waiting. Even after that, it took so much effort to just catch her at the right exact time to get more mimosas for bottomless when she seemed to actively avoid eye contact.. If it hadn't take forever to get refills, I would have been able to get more! I think the whole place was a bit grungy. The pathway to the bathroom downstairs was really creepy and dark... I liked the fact there were TVs to watch and my friends said they had dinner there the night before and the food was apparently good!",2,1,

57,Jared H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,46,12,1.0,1/21/2017,"I experienced the Trifecta of Fuckery at Redemption.FirstWe were here the other day early on a Saturday evening and got a table. Maybe 3/4 of the tables were taken, so there was no explanation why it took 30 minutes for our order of a vodka soda and a bottle of beer. When our waitress finally decided to work, she of course messed up our drink order. SecondFor my second beer, I decided I needed to have it before Trump starts WWIII, so walked over to the bar and ordered it there. The bartender said to me, ""9 dollars.""  I was surprised that a run of the mill bar in midtown is charging $9 for a bud light so I watched her punch the order into the POS. She punched in $8 for the beer, but told me $9. So she pre-tipped herself. When I saw that, I certainly wasn't going to tip her extra. Fucked up, and laughably dishonest. I've never seen a bar do that before. I walked over to the manager and asked him how much a bud-light draft was. ""$7.25 plus tax, so $8"". So I confirmed it. Fuck. That. It's only a dollar, but have some goddamn respect for your clientele.Third, to complete the Trifecta of FuckeryWhen we wanted to leave (we weren't able to order anything else of course because our waitress wasn't really.. how do I put this gently... doing a lick of work), I had to walk up to our waitress to close out the bill, because of course she came to the table to take orders literally once this entire time (at least an hour). I paid the bill in cash and she gave me the wrong change back, giving me the right bills but rounding down in the restaurants favor and short changing me. At that point, I didn't even mention it - I needed to just leave Redemption as soon as possible.This trifecta is a bunch of dumb things, but fucking hell, it's like everyone working at Redemption is lazy, dishonest, or both. They leave money on the table by having shitty waitstaff and not taking orders more often, and they just lost my business, and of course other business as a result. Ripping me off? Go fuck yourself. There's plenty of other options in Midtown.",,1,

I brought this to the bartender's attention giving the benefit of the doubt that it was an honest mistake. She showed me the bottle because OBVIOUSLY, showing me the bottle must mean I'm crazy and my taste buds have failed me. When I reiterated I know what Jack tastes like and this ain't it, she called a bartender at the other end of the bar and specifically told her to pour me a new drink from the ""bottle on that side of the bar."" This time it was Jack.Don't pull the switcheroo with well liquor because you think the customer can't taste the difference. Don't try to pull one over on them when they call you out on your bull****.

Never mind the fact that I ordered it with nothing on it and got it with all the works. The sever was very nice about, took it off the menu, and swapped it out for mozzarella sticks. Or so I thought they were mozzarella sticks, but they were more like a container of Parmesan cheese was dumped over fried breadcrumbs with barely any actual mozzarella cheese used in the making of them.

My two friends came, and again the waitress with her nasty attitude.... so whatever I love redemptions nachos, so I looked passed it..... After our food arrived our waitress again didn't ask if everything was ok, if the food was ok, if we wanted another round.... I really wanted some water, and so we were looking around to ask and our server is taking shots at the bar.... my friend went up to the server and told her and then the manager Daniela got mad at us for correcting her server.

71,Klarissa L.,"New York, NY",64,165,952,3.0,1/30/2015,"I've walked by this place several times since I live in the area. They have outdoor seating in the summer which is nice.  The space is relatively large with a bar in front and back.  The space looks like it would be good to rent out for a party as the back portion is relatively separated from the front portion. It's pretty much two rooms that they tried to open up into one larger space. Overall the vibe was cool, they played some classics from the 90s which I enjoyed. There are several tvs all over the restaurant.Came here for happy hour on a Thursday night. Happy hour only goes until 7pm. Beer was $4 for Stella and Nachos were $9 (with chicken).  Most places in this area have good beer on tap for $5 all night ... So $4 just didn't seem like that great of a steal! Also, we ordered nachos but there was no price on the menu ... The waitress came back and asked us if we wanted chicken or steak. Of course she failed to mention adding meat was an additional $3. I was actually fine with it bc I wanted chicken and they gave a pretty generous serving of chicken, but I didn't like that she didn't mention the extra charge. I think this place is a little over priced, but the atmosphere is nice.  I'd pick a few spots over this in the area if i were going out again or making recommendations, but I wouldn't be opposed to trying this place again.",,,
72,David C.,"Staten Island, NY",44,78,32,2.0,11/6/2015,"For whatever reason, I had this huge craving for a good burger today, and decided I'd check this place out. Here are my thoughts: Waitresses here are pretty. Notice the choice of words, ""waitresses"" as there's not a single male waiter. Similarities between this place and Hooters can be drawn. Similar to Hooters, I guess this place is mostly frequented by men who enjoy ogling these waitresses. I must admit the waitress/bartender who took my order was very attentive. As for the food (another similarity shared with Hooters) it was absolutely horrendous. I ordered my burger medium, but got it well done. It was the dryest burger I've had in a while. The meat was clearly frozen, and I imagine that it had been frozen for quite some time, given its powdery texture. Better places to order a burger to name a few: Hooters (that's not saying much), Wendy's, Five Guy's. The sweet potato fries were decent, but at an extra $4, it should come with some form of dipping sauce other than plain ole' ketchup. I should've stuck with my original gut instinct, which was to order a burger from Hillstone. The burgers at Hillstone are phenomenal, and one of the best burgers that I've ever had in my life.  Their burgers are expensive, but not much more than the $20 bucks I've spent at Redemption today, which proved to be a disaster. I won't be revisiting this place anytime soon, unless its for beers, and to ogle their waitresses.",1,,
73,Sunny S.,"Philadelphia, PA",136,380,145,2.0,8/17/2014,"Stopped by here for dinner on Friday after leaving Midtown 1015 because I saw that it had some good veggie options.  The place is actually pretty large - with ample seating inside and out.  They have high-top tables all throughout the main area of the bar with stools to sit on.The service is one of the slowest I have ever experienced.  After walking in, one of the waitresses said we could sit down anywhere.  After sitting down for a good 15-20min, we still had nobody approach us regarding a menu.  When we finally asked for food and drink menus,  I had to go find a waitress and actually get them myself because nobody came to drop them off.  Overall, we wasted at least 30min before even ordering our food and drinks.  All the waitresses just stood at the computer next to the bar, hanging out and talking - terrible.We ordered nachos for appetizer, and my friend and I both got burgers.  IF you order an appetizer and an entree here, remember to tell them to bring your app BEFORE bringing your main course.  Our food took forever to come and we were wondering where the nachos were, but we saw the server bring the nachos and both of our burgers at the same time.  There was barely enough room on the table for all three plates, plus our drinks, silverware, etc.  I thought it was common sense to bring an appetizer FIRST, especially when we said we'd have the nachos for appetizer, but I guess here, they don't do that.The nachos were actually very good and I would recommend them to everyone.  It is a ridiculously large portion, so I'd suggest sharing it between 3-4 people...my friend and I barely ate half of the nachos (but that could also be because our burgers were getting cold in front of us).  The veggie burger was...meh.  Wasn't good or bad, but it was really filling.  It's homemade, which is nice, but after eating about a third of it, I just couldn't eat any more.",1,,

This was probably because we had our expectations too high because there was nothing drastically wrong with the service. The food was decent slightly better than average sports bar brunch food Our server was friendly. The only issue was with the bottomless brunch option they were not refilling the glasses as we finished we always had to ask. We aren't the type that go to a bottomless brunch as a cheapskate option we were also buying rounds of top shelf liquor and tipped 30% (we all work in the industry).

When she did finally come back she entirely missed both our glasses spilling water all over the table and our legs/feet/leather shoes since the table was slatted. And no, she nor the bus boy brought over napkins. When our actual waitress came over she was very sweet & friendly. However we didn't see her much and wondered if she was even supposed to be working our table which was outside.

Nevermind the initial ignoring of me and my friend by the hostess and by the waitresses. Nevermind the fact that the waitress took forever to pay us any attention, and then finally came to our table without a smile or even any hint of personality or experience. Nevermind even how the beers we ordered never came. The part that it gets interesting is when we got fed up enough that our beers didn't come, and walked over to the bar to just buy a couple. Tab was $7 bucks, gave the bartender a $20, and she gave the change back AFTER she took a dollar tip. SHE TOOK HER TIP BEFORE GIVING US CHANGE. So much attitude, no gratitude, she was horrible. Flabbergasted, we go back to the table, a long time passes with our order not arriving, and we call the waitress over to get more beer. We tell her that she never brought over the beers we ordered from her. No apology, just a look at us as if to say ""and?"" with no response. Needless to say, we walked out. Don't know the waitress's name, all I know is she was brunette and wore glasses.

I arrive and mush my way into a seat and the waiter comes over and asks if I want something and I love tequila and it's the summer so I start with a frozen margarita ..

So one of my brothers points to their other bar which from the expression on her face looked like she just found out about.. And he asks ""what about that one"" and she says she will check. Surely, she came back with the margaritas which were the most watery margaritas ever.. I must've mistakenly ordered a waterita. It tasted like one of those icy's where they vigorously scrape ice into a cup then squirt some juice on it and say ""Wung Feety my frehn."" Few folks ordered food but I chose not to after the reviews here and my waterita. I had like two shots after that and called it a day. The REAL gem.. Is the pizza place next to it with great slices and they're open late and LITERALLY next door so you can head over in between your wateritas and grab a slice.. I'm hungry writing about it.

Happy hour goes till 7pm. I arrived at 7pm so I didn't score any happy hour deals. The waitress picked a tiny table by the wall, I could not fit my fat ass into the seat because there was another table behind and the girl took up all the room. Trust me, no human would have fit into my seat unless you were a 5 year old kid, or a small dog. I asked if we could sit elsewhere and the hostess let us sit at a different table where a normal sized human could fit.Our waitress was dumb. Just dumb. I wonder if she understands English. We had ordered the 2 for 1 sangria, which cost us $12. The sangria came in small cups. Obviously they took 1 sangria and put it into 2 small glasses and say its 2 for 1. They had the red and the white sangria, the waitress recommended the red sangria so I went with the red. I have never tasted such unique sangria before, it was a blend of cough syrup and nasty boxed wine. Urgh. So disgusting. I didn't even finish both glasses of sangria because who wants to drink medicine?The waitress successfully screwed up every single order, what a record. Where did you hire your waitress? Hint: if you are a waitress who has been fired from every restaurant, I am sure Redemption will hire you. We started off with the wings, which comes with your choice of 2 sauces. Guess what? When we were served the wings, the waitress only brought us one sauce and walked away. I actually had to find her 5 min later to ask where the other sauce was. She claimed that they ran out. Seriously? She should have told us that way earlier instead of just not bringing us our sauce. She offered to bring me another sauce, I chose the spicy ketchup, which tasted like normal ketchup. Never mind, I am not here to teach her the different between normal ketchup and spicy ketchup.I was craving a delicious grilled cheese sandwich. I ordred a grilled cheese sandwich with turkey, with NO mustard. I hate mustard so much, if you put it in my sandwich, I won't eat it. Of course, my sandwich came served to me with lots of mustard melted between the bread and the cheese, so it was very difficult to scrape off. I took a bite and almost barfed. I called the waitress and she took the sandwich back to the kitchen. By the time I got a replacement sandwich, my friend had already finished her meal. The grilled turkey cheese sandwich was the driest sandwich ever. It tasted like horrible left over turkey that had been left out in the sun too long, which was carelessly slapped onto a pathetic piece of cheap bread, with cheap cheese melted on top of it. It was so dry and disgusting that I had to put ketchup on my food just to make it a little more appetizing.If you want to lose some weight, this is a great place to go to because the food is disgusting. Honestly, I'd rather eat at a street cart, some chicken and rice would not only be cheaper but would be much more appetizing.The only reason this place does not have one star is because the people are ok looking. My recommendation is to NOT EAT here, and AVOID the sangria at all costs, unless you want to drink medicine.",,1,1

When I asked if the portobello mushroom was marinated, she answered me with ""it's grilled"" when I tried to clarify I meant prior to grilling, she answered ""yes, they put salt and pepper on it **giggle*"" So we finally get our food at 3:45, it was pretty ok. Nothing to get excited over. Certainly not worth waiting 2 hours to eat (arguably they could have marinated the portobello in that time) Thank goodness the company for this 3 hour journey was fabulous.

100,Evan J.,"New York, NY",207,85,80,3.0,5/6/2013,"Lunch and happy hour onlyMy decision on a late afternoon lunch quest, Redemption proved a great choice. Not only was the burger superb, but the free tap beer with check in was an added bonus. The ""Baller"" burger came cooked perfectly to order loaded with fresh arugula and mouth watering smoked bacon, goat cheese, and aioli. Oh jeez... Food coma approaching... Seriously though, the bacon was just crispy enough without being burnt, and and the goat cheese just soft enough to be heavenly.  If I could review the burger only, it'd be 4 stars, maybe 5.  Unfortunately, this isn't a food cart, so...Sitting at the bar, the service is fine, though they could benefit from being slightly more attentive. Beer selection is acceptable considering it's midtown east. And while I normally avoid this neighborhood like the plague, prior to about 5:30pm it's totally a fantastic lunch place and a great pub.  After 5:30, the Top40 gets turned up, and the neighboring conversations about whether or not you wear Hollister begin.  $4 happy hour until 7pm does not make up for such an appalling excuse for bar chatter.  Needless to say, I grabbed my check and took off straightaway.In conclusion, I was almost tricked into giving this place a 4 star rating.  Redemption, you could be something so much better if you kept the number of lame, douchey patrons to a minimum.",,,

One of the bartenders was dancing on the bar like she thought she was in Coyote Ugly... She was just ugly... Nothing more...Aside from the horrible service we received someone had explosive diarrhea in not one but two of the bathroom stalls I entered. After entering the second I gave up and felt it was better just to hold it in. The state of their bathrooms was a perfect reflection of the quality of beer Redemption serves. Crap. My Stella was flat and room temperature warm. Perhaps a mishap, so I ordered a bottled beer which is impossible to mess up. It was right, aside from being a little too warm. The most disturbing part of this bar must be the manager. His dog-like demeanor to all of the women in the bar made everyone feel extremely uncomfortable, and his bacon grease hairdo was of no aid to him. If you want a bar where you can get drunk with trash while listening to mediocre music and being surrounded by overweight middle aged men then this is where you belong.

I ordered the chop salad with steak ($5 extra for the steak).

I was there for a friend's birthday, so we were all in a big group. The waitress took orders but never asked for cash or if we wanted to start a tab, so I kinda just assumed that either she was doing the tabs by table or my friend had set everything up to be charged together and then we'd divide it up at the end of the night. Instead, some of us got charged really ridiculous amounts - I'm pretty sure the waitress messed up somehow because we did the math several times and it just didn't add up. It caused some drama and many of us ended up paying more than what we actually consumed. The waitress really should've clarified the payment method(s) with everybody early in the night... although I can't even blame her too much because they had her working a party of like 20+ people by herself. It really ruined what had been a good night and ensured that my friends and I won't be returning here, since it left such a bad taste in our mouths.",,,

Updated review","My first experience at Redemption was one to forget, a packed bar with one waitress and a completely disorganized staff made for a disaster of a meal during Friday lunch. Me and my friend decided to go back to Redemption for a Sunday soccer game (mainly because it happened to be the only bar on second ave in midtown open at 11am on Sunday) and had a great experience. Their all you can drink bloody's, screwdrivers, and mimosas for two hours for $15 is a pretty surreal deal. Their brunch menu, while not too extensive covers all of the basic cravings one would have at a manageable price. The bartender was about as cool as it gets and even let us drink under the $15 deal for close to 3 hours, all while socializing with us and adhering to our requests of the sporting events that were shown on their TV's.For $30, i walked out stuffed and heavily buzzed.....not too shabby for a Sunday morning!",1,,

Went on a Monday for happy hour with a friend, and beer selection was your usual light beers with a 1-2 craft options in the mix. Sangria is delicious and always buy one get one free (one costs $12). Never too crowded, and great spot to watch sports.Also went there for brunch. Entrees are priced $11-16, with an option for unlimited mimosas and bloodys for another $15.

But whatever, beggars can be choosers. They appeared to have some unusual kind of fruit punch on the counter-tops. I didn't inquire to the yellow and red froths but they were intriguing.

That was pretty rude, in my opinion. The waitress also forgot to bring a glass for our drinks, and forgot to put in our order of fries.

There, that's better. But...I still need a damn drink!Enter the Redemption Cocktail Lounge.Redemption? There's *none* of that up in here! screamed my brain as I looked over the utterly banal cocktail menu that looked like it had been conceived and printed in 1994. This is Manhattan, I assured myself, although the blizzard had me wondering if I had somehow stepped into a black hole that allows for immediate travel to the Jersey Shore (that's what I get for hallucinating the beach. I'll take the blizzard, thank you very much). It bugs me when non native New Yorkers speak disparagingly of ""bridge and tunnel"" folks, but I'm allowed because I'm a native, so nyah!

I opted for a glass of wine instead of a Sex on the Beach or any other lousy dated cocktail choice from the menu and my friend stuck to vodka/Redbulls.To be fair, service was with a smile (though the bartender was also the waitress and we had to flag her down for service in a bar that was not at all busy).

144,Arielle S.,"Manhattan, NY",418,335,0,1.0,11/18/2012,"The food was bad and the service was even worse. I ordered a sandwich that stated it was pulled chicken with bbq sauce. I got a sandwich with huge chunks of chicken with very little bbq sauce and a bunch of cole slaw on it! I don't know about you but I want my cole slaw on the side, if at all.My friend asked for a well done burger with no pickles or tomatoes. She got a rare cooked burger with tomatoes and pickles. Bc the wait staff didn't bother to check back in on us, she couldn't ask them to further cook it and she could barely choke half of it down.Another friend asked for extra bbq sauce and never got it. He literally had to go up to the bar to ask for it.We all got french fries and only halfway through are meal when the bbq sauce was finally brought to my friend, was I able to ask for ketchup. Any bar serving burgers or fries should have ketchup on the table or bring it with the food. We wrote bad service on our receipt and they will not be getting a chance for redemption.",2,2,
145,Julia K.,"Washington, DC",26,121,0,3.0,12/17/2012,"I've only been here to watch Redskins games, so keep that in mind. Pros: --it's a Redskins bar, so the atmosphere during games is great -- full of fans, the fight song after scores, etc. --the beer is cheap (a huge tower for $15)Cons:--the cheap beer is Coors Light--it's incredibly crowded and the service is kind of slow. Random:--they play music during commercials.  That may be your thing, but I found it annoying. Overall it's a decent place to watch the game, but there are better options (like the Australian).",2,,
146,Ryan D.,"Nashua, NH",264,358,64,2.0,4/8/2013,"Let me start off by saying, this is exactly the type of place I hate.It's small, well lit, crowded, and so straight it hurts. Not necessarily the place's fault; I'm aware that places like this exist in the world, and for some reason, many people seem to like going to them. Still don't know why. The last time I was at a place like this, it was with Rose & Jen at Pride (except we were more in Chelsea, so I felt safer somehow because of that). The minute that place got crowded, we left.I came here because my Joe G. suggested it. I guess he's been here with people after work? I don't hate any option on the east side (it's so random whenever anybody wants to hang out there) so I took him up on it. This was the weekend that St. Patrick's Day happened, so it might also not be fair to hate on this place for being busy and crowded. Many people were out that weekend all over the place.Still, ehhhhh. The bartender was wearing green gloves in the back. There was something slightly offensive about that. Also, we had a nice waitress, but when we came in, we took the only booth there. Which was all the way to the back and to the right. I think our waitress would have checked on us more if she could have actually physically gotten to us. She couldn't, and so we suffered.It was also way too expensive. Especially for where it is, and the time we were there, we kind of got ripped off. Skippable.",,2,

Was gonna do a salad but then the burgers caught me eye. Had the one with goat cheese and arugula and omg I enjoyed it. I did ask for no aioli and it was on my burger when it arrived but easily fixed with a scrape of the knife. Burger was cooked perfectly and they say it's grass fed.

The bar is fine, the service was actually great, and the drinks were fine, but this feels like every bar in the 50s along second ave. I literally went to Opal once for drinks (which is a few blocks down) and coming here I couldn't tell the difference.I came on a Tuesday, and the one thing I do like is that they have a rotating happy hour each day. Tuesdays are Tiki Tuesdays which meant half off nachos, and patron margaritas.  That puts nachos at $6 and the margarita at $7.  The nachos were great actually, big portion that three friends easily split. A good deal for the happy hour.I really liked the bartenders and the waitresses. They were all very friendly, and were pretty good at making sure we had everything we needed.The two for one sangria was very good, and comes in a pint (!) glass.Overall the bottom line is this is a good option if you are in the area, much better than the horrid Traffic, I just wish it had more character.",,,

My family and I came here and my mom ordered a salad with balsamic vinaigrette. check out this story:-She is brought her salad THERE IS NO DRESSING-She asks if she can get the dressing -after TWENTY MINUTES and me approaching the waitress three times, she finally goes and gets the dressing-ITS THE WRONG DRESSING-she goes again to get dressing-ITS THE WRONG DRESSING AGAIN-my mom has to explain to the waitress which salad she ordered and that its not a cobb salad, its a chicken salad, and shes now brought two of the wrong dressings for a salad she didnt even know my mom DIDNT have.-at this time it has taken my mom HALF AN HOUR to get DRESSING. This place is understaffed.

Because all places that had nightlife also served food, so you usually had to filter reviews to see if they were based on their food or nightlife? Well, I ended up at Redemption, a small bar on the corner of ----- and had a fabulous time. Being in NYC in December was pretty chilly, so basking under the heat lamps outside of Redemptions small smoking patio wasn't too bad. Drinks were on average ten dollars, so it was fairly cheap by NYC standards. This place is small but wasn't crowded all. Plenty of places to grove and mingle about. I fell in love with their DJ the Friday night I was there. Pumping everything from top 40's, oldies but goodies, and actually being a DJ. Mixing music well and always had the crowd going. My party of 4 were definitely rocking out. Great music always calls for a great time. This bar made me feel like I never left OC. It was fun, drink prices were reasonable and I got to dance without being shoved around. Definitely a place I would come back to.

They were understaffed. We ordered cocktails and the app platter. The drinks took at least ten minutes. Fine. The app platter, which probably is all microwaved anyway took more than 45 minutes. I got fed up and walked up to the wait station because no one was available to come by anyway and told them that if the food didn't come out within ten minutes to not bother and give us the check. We got the food and it absolutely did not justify how long we waited. If you have at least 2-3 hours to spare, go ahead and come over.

Since it was St. Patty's Day, you could have chosen to be a total stonefaced douche and everyone would've been too plastered to care. Instead, you had a smile on your face the entire time and enjoyed the party as much as we did. No matter how busy things got, you quickly focused your attention on our crew and kept the tequila shots flowing without delay :) And after pestering my friends about getting a car bomb for days, yours totally hit the spot!

WOW the food is good. They give you a LOT of dip and it doesn't harden and turn cold quickly like a lot of other dips. It actually stays creamy and it's really, really good. The chicken sliders were also amazing, and definitely something different. There's an Asian spin on these sliders with the basil, and it's a little sweeter than your traditional chicken salad.

187,Sam B.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,12,0,1.0,9/12/2012,"Terrible dining experience.  I went here with my friend (who has a very serious dairy allergy) and we literally had to each send our food back twice.  To put things into perspective, I never send my food back unless there is something seriously wrong as I know how food service works and I would rather not have bodily fluids mixed in with my meal. I ordered the grilled cheese with spinach and pancetta (standard menu item) and she ordered the veggie burger. After explaining her food allergy to the waitress, she certified there would be absolutely no dairy in the burger.  When we were served, her burger was covered in cheese and my grilled cheese didn't include spinach nor pancetta!  At this point the waitress willingly took our food back to the kitchen.When the bus boy returned with our food, my sandwich still didn't have pancetta and my friend's bun was heavily buttered.  Good thing she inspected it before biting in otherwise they would have surely had a lawsuit on their hands. We complained to the bus boy and he took her burger back but insisted I was lying about the absence of pancetta in my sandwich.  I took a bite to inspect and still no bacon.  When the waitress returned, she said that all the buns come with butter after previously assuring us the dish was 100% dairy free.  When I told her about my sandwich, she put her hands out as if she was about to open my sandwich in front of me to inspect for pancetta.  She caught herself, however, and made me open my sandwich and pick through the glob of spinach to prove to her that there was no pancetta.  Finally, after much convincing, she took it back.My friend ordered a salad instead, which was OK.  When she returned with my sandwich, it still had my bite mark in it.  I let that go. Too much trouble for a grilled cheese that was just lightly toasted bread thrown in the microwave to melt the cheese. When our bill came, we got nothing free and were actually charged higher than the menu price for our fries.  I asked the waitress to speak to a manager and she said she didn't know who the manager was that night.  Finally, the bartender showed up and took the two entrees off our bill (only reason why this review gets any stars at all).  Our satisfaction with this bill adjustment wore off after we had to walk up to the waitress a half hour later to ask for our change.  She was too busy dancing by the bar to realize we needed change -- or she assumed we wanted to leave her a large tip for her great service. Found out the waitress and the chef are both new.  Too bad. Go there for the 2 for 1 sangria.  But that's it.",,,
188,Maggie M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,4.0,10/23/2014,I don't know this place makes me happy. Every spring I make it a point to get here for two things: 1- sangria and 2- their hummus is amazing. As in best hummus in the city. I don't know why it's so good .Overall pretty solid place nice out door seating,,,
189,Holly C.,"New York, NY",409,1256,5,3.0,1/12/2011,"*SUNDAY BRUNCH REVIEW*3.5-4The place is kind of grungy looking, but it still is one of my favorite places to enjoy a Sunday brunch. The selection is small, but delicious! AND you get 3 drinks too? I'm hooked! (3 drinks, app, entree, 'dessert' for $20??? Can't beat that)*LOUNGE REVIEW*2.5-3It's like any other bar, very crowded, and kind of dirty. The crowd was ok. Luckily my friend had rented out the back room so we could escape the craziness of the main floor. The music is a mix... not the best. I personally would not come back here at night.",2,1,1
190,Mark M.,"New York, NY",31,9,1,1.0,9/22/2015,"Tried to enjoy myself and catch the game on the tv here but one of the waitresses with long hair, pants and major attitude ruined it for me when she started arguing with the bartender telling him how horrible he was. It made the whole experience horrible for me as well so I left. Too much drama.",,,
191,Jarred S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,1.0,9/20/2015,"The service is terrible here. The hostess sat us down then waited 15 minutes for a waiter/waitress to even come by to ask for our drink order. Draft beer we got was warm. Either cause it was sitting somewhere for a while or the keg wasn't cold. Then took another 15 minutes before someone noticed our glasses were empty, and it wasn't our waitress. Got some appetizers eventually which were ok, would give more stars but sitting at a table with the wait staff forgetting you're there continuously the entire night is the most frustrating thing.",,,
192,Talar A.,"Los Angeles, CA",78,184,172,3.0,9/20/2013,"Basically this is your average sports bar- nothing really special and nothing terrible. The service was okay, our waitress seemed like she was swamped and annoyed. We had the caliente margarita which was not so caliente, eh I didn't really care for it. The beer was good but beer is good everywhere.  My friend had the lettuce wraps which smelled amazing and said it was his go to plate there.",,,
193,Tara P.,"Marine Park, NY",20,8,0,3.0,4/27/2014,Came here with my husband after the Rangers game.  If you're in collage this may be this place for you. Not so much for us.  Drinks are good and the waitress is attentive  but I'm not sure if I'll be back.,,,
194,Elisa S.,"Maplewood, NJ",48,50,0,2.0,2/24/2011,"I went here for brunch exactly once, and that was one time too many. We should have been clued in by the fact that we were the only people in the restaurant. In spite of our being the only people there, service was painfully slow, and it seems to be the kind of place you should go to at night, when candlelight can mask the accumulated scunge. When my omelet finally arrived, I found that they had forgotten to put the jalapeno I ordered into the omelet itself. It seems the kitchen remembered too late, and rather than remake it properly, they mounded raw jalapeno on top of the omelet and masked the error with two crossed strips of bacon I DIDN'T order over the top of the jalapeno. Now, I believe that nearly all of life's problems can be solved with bacon. Just  not this one.",1,,

It's just too expensive and there are tons of other places in walking distances, just as nice and cheaper. $8 for a Heineken and $1 tip....$9 for a beer? No thanks...",1,1,
198,Brad B.,"Wellesley, MA",0,11,1,1.0,11/3/2013,"Short summary:Some of the worst service we've had in quite a while, drinks were wrong, tab was wrong, food was slow and tasted like something from under the heat lamp.Service:Server was not well-trained or did not seem to be paying close attention. Several orders either wrong or missing, and bill was incorrect.Atmosphere:Beer pong was being played near us, eventually loudly shut down by a manager. There was an air of unprofessionalism here that seemed out-of-place given the higher-end look and feel of the establishment. Despite the small crowd at the hour we attended, the noise level was very high.Food:The menu choices seemed reasonable, and some even sounded like fairly original preparations of classic pub fare. Unfortunately, upon experience, only one of our 5 dishes tasted passable, with fairly fresh ingredients and preparation. The remaining items (burgers, sliders, club sandwich) were all very dry and unflavored. It was clear that the good one (which took twice as long to arrive) was the only one freshly prepared, and the rest had been lying around for quite a while before we arrived.Experience:Our party showed up a little after 11, and we were told that the kitchen closed at 12. We immediately gave our orders so they would have plenty of time (very simple, some sliders, burgers, fries and a club sandwich). 3 of the items we ordered were no longer available, so we compromised due to the later hour and ordered other things. The server came back to our table no less than four times to re-confirm who ordered what, and we had to ask for water glasses and place settings, since we never received any.When the food started arriving, my wife's order was missing. 5 minutes later, the server returned yet again, asking what she had ordered. We waited another 20 minutes for her order to finally arrive, and the server tried to explain it as the ""kitchen taking too long."" Hers was the freshest out of all of ours, so it was obvious what happened: She completely forgot to put it in with the kitchen.Our friend whose drink was never delivered was still charged for it, and so we had a talk with them, and had it fixed, plus my wife's meal was free for having taken so long. We left a 15% tip grudgingly.In the end, one of us got decent food but had to wait twice as long, and the rest of us got food that was just barely edible.Our server was completely spaced-out and clearly needed to write things down better (or at all).I have a strong suspicion that despite the fact we were there during the hours when the kitchen was open, they were trying to close down early and so we got the short end of the stick. Suffice to say, we're not going to risk trying again; we'll find somewhere else to go.",,,
199,Joelle G.,"New York, NY",289,763,71,2.0,4/29/2011,"Place is okay. Server was very nice. Drinks were so-so. Food okay. Nothing to write home about. Not boycotting the place, but not rushing back to it either.",,,
