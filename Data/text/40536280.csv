Good beers on draft and more cans and bottles, including $5 daily specials on Founder's IPA, Modelo, Guinness Blonde, Michelob Ultra, Magic Hat. Friendly Bartenders and a comfy, intimate pub.  Located on 84th, between 2nd and 3rd Ave. This is a great bar to stop in with some friends, great for nightcap. Come here for Happy Hour after work, it's mellow then, a perfect way to unwind after a long day of work. You'll meet friendly people and have some great conversations. There is free WiFi.  It's a captive portal.  Tip, give your real email and you'll get an occasional offer to redeem a free beer. They don't spam, just an occasional message. Love this place, it's a such a benefit to have this in my neighborhood.",

There's a little alcove in the back if you get there early enough, if you're feeling less social or have a small group of friends.Duncan the bartender is a really good guy. He'll take care of you. There's a nice selection of beer and they always have something locak, like Bronx Brew. It also has one of the best trivia nights in town on Mondays (starts around 8 pm). Don't miss it.",5

8,,7/9/2017,3,,"Manhattan, NY",Sebastian C.,1,4.0,46,"Great place. Loved it. I see people discussing here the ""douchiness"" of UES or the ""fake Irish"" bars of UES. Well, probably the same people that prefer to pay unwordly prices downtown at some rooftop for the same stuff and then buckle up and save to pay the rent and utilities. Don't get me wrong, I love some of the downtown places or Brooklyn spots (per my reviews), but they are insanely priced for what they have to offer, especially when the end result is the same, you get tipsy. With that said, I think Trinity it's awesome, because there's no BS. No food, no false advertising or anything like that. It's a good bar, plain and simple, with ""reasonable"" prices (as reasonable as NYC goes). I feel the UES is very underrated. From someone who went out in every neighborhood in NYC.",1

The bartender, Barry, such a nice guy and great bartender. I'll be back for you Barry!!",1

Barry always greets you with a smile, a Guinness and a genuine interest in how you're doing. I threw my boyfriend a surprise party here, and Barry let us decorate the whole place. Not only that, but he helped us cut the cake and was super generous the entire evening - turning off the lights when we sang happy birthday, taking pictures of the group, and generally just being incredibly hospitable the whole evening. This bar truly is a gem on the UES and I highly recommend it for any occasion, whether it be a quick beer or a 30th birthday party :).",

This is everything a dive bar SHOULD be and it's gratifying to see some remnants of traditional NYC here: the locally-owned, locally-inhabited pub that doesn't cater to trends or fads-- this place just IS. Stand-out features include the music - played at the right volume and featuring a solid mix of indie rock / alt from the past decade, the beer list was solid with some really spectacular and unique draft choices that impressed me. Prices were right on point for the bar & location - and the people in the bar itself were friendly and chill. I will definitely come back again soon and might opt in as a guest bartender on a near future Thursday - would be great to host a party there!",1

It's generally outside of the normal areas I hang out (i'm a below 14th street kind of snob, so sad). I actually thought the environment inside the bar was pretty fun. Definitely had a lot of neighborhood folks having one final drink before the night was over. After 4 AM the bartender hopped on the bar and started dancing/singing, which was extremely random but nobody seemed to mind. The crowd also seemed very British/Irish (no surprise obviously)I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here but I think if I lived in the area i'd pop in once in a while.",2

Patrons and bartenders sing along at the top of their lungs. The bartenders are fantastic. When it's crowded, they will help you find a place to stand or sit near the bar and they will most likely remember your name when you return.  Great place to grab a drink and unwind.     There is a small selection of beers on tap, but it is definitely a fully stocked Irish Pub. There is a small nook in the back corner of the bar that's more intimate. Perfect for a small group or date night.  The rest of the bar is usually filled with happy adults of all ages who just want to have a good time. A neighborhood gem.",

Good happy hour prices - $4 beers. The bartenders are super nice and friendly. Last time we came (two weeks ago) was with a group of friends - we had a celebratory birthday drink before heading out for the night. All the girls enjoyed the atmosphere and the drinks. We were able to snag the nook in the back, really nice for moderate sized groups. We felt - VIP- I know, lame but it doesn't take much to make us happy.

26,,6/8/2015,6,,"Manhattan, NY",Frank M.,0,3.0,34,"If you like dive bars, Trinity is definitely an UES hidden gem. Friendly atmosphere with a very friendly neighborhood crowd. It is everything a dive bar should be and provides consistently good service. Its a small bar, shaped like a railroad apartment, which can get crowded. If you are meeting people out, so its best to go here with only a couple people instead of larger groups. Neither good nor bad, it does tend to come alive around 3 AM when people living in the neighborhood are on their way home and decide to grab one more pint within walking distance of their bed before calling it a night.As much as I like Trinity, I'm giving it 3 stars because it is a typical dive bar. Nothing particularly jumps out to make it great, however the place is well worth the visit.",

Despite the crowd being a little weird I always end up having a good time. The bartenders are great, the jukebox is always pumping out the tunes, and that little couch area in the back is just seedy enough for me to never sit in.

Never seems too crowded on the times I have dropped in here for a pint of Guinness, but the bartenders are friendly and the place is welcoming. A nice change from the normal fratty or sports bars in the area. It is a small pub with only a booth and about a dozen bar stools. Seems like the kind of place where everyone knows each others names. Kind of like a mini Cheers kind of place. If you are a fan of cream ales and stouts this is a good spot to relax and enjoy your drink. Accompany it with a shot of  Jameson's and you have a proper Irish drinking experience. The do have a happy hour, good jukebox, and on occasion will have live music playing. Just a nice little neighborhood spot to relax and enjoy a drink among a more adult crowd.",8
31,,10/6/2013,41,,"Fairfield, CT",Melissa M.,23,4.0,166,"This bar has probably the friendliest bartenders in the city.  I'm not talking about when they have only a handful of people to serve...I mean no matter how busy the place gets.  The bartenders try to learn the names of those sitting at the bar, and shook my hand at introduction and upon my exit.The beer selection on tap is not too extensive.  It'd be nice if they had a few seasonal rotations in there, but they have the basics and couple outside of that (like Shock Top or Delerium), so they're trying to make the most of the limited tap space. The mixed drinks aren't bad either.  The greatest thing about this place, outside of the bartenders of course, is the unpretentiousness of this bar.  I feel like if I walked in with a sweatshirt and no make up...even if I scare little children on the street, no one would care here.  It's super chill.  You will find people of all different age groups and walks of life patronizing this place at any point during the evening or night, which is fantastic (if I wanted to be around everyone exactly like me, I'd just stay home and talk to myself).",1

We felt like we were hanging out in the middle of dublin with the beers and laughs flowing all night long.  Chris is a world-class bartender who should be winning awards.  While the door was shut and locked at 4:00am, the bar-top dancing and singing and flashing went on for another full hour.  This is one of the only bars that could get me to stay out past 2am.Absolute perfection.",

I have a much better story about the bartenders. I wish I had a video of The Incident because it is probably one of the best things (the best thing?) I have seen to date in a bar. Let me set the stage for you. It was Halloween weekend. The bar was crowded, but not packed, something like 10 pm. You might be interested to know they were running some unlimited drinks special, something like $40 for 3 hours of AYCD (they are doing a similar special for NYE). I was sitting at the bar next to a girlfriend. There were a couple of bartenders working. One was dressed as Batman. The patrons were varying degrees of drunk, but a very congenial bunch. In particular, there was one especially drunk Banana intent on flirting with every girl there, etc. He was harmless. However, there was one weirdo by himself, a post-middle aged man that I would venture to guess was under the influence of something in addition to alcohol. He was being seriously weird; it's hard to describe. He was standing behind me. I'm sitting there, chatting with Batman, who's slinging drinks and being very friendly when glass comes flying over my shoulder and smashing into the wall behind the bartender. Both of us are lucky we didn't get cut. The drunk post-middle aged man had smashed his glass into the brick wall behind me, and the shattered glass ricocheted across the bar. I can't even tell you how fast, so incredibly fast, Batman raced all the way down to the end of the bar and all the way back up to the front of the pub and pushed post-middle age drunk guy out of the bar (drunk guy's hand was bleeding profusely). Drunk post-middle age guy was furious, but Batman, oh-so-super-hero-ly forced him out and then SLAMMED THE DOOR! The whole bar erupted into applause and started chanting BATMAN! BATMAN! BATMAN!It was pretty epic. This is a no-frills kind of place. Very comfortable, not a see-and-be-seen place. I'd give it an imaginary sixth star if it would expand the beers on tap, or even just switch out the stuff you can get everywhere (like Guinness, Blue Moon, etc.) for a craft brew or two.",14
38,,2/3/2014,23,,"Manhattan, NY",Jaclyn C.,17,5.0,64,"So I'm basically just going to reiterate what a lot of the other Yelpers have said: 1. Great Bar 2. Great atmosphere 3. Great bartenders. What makes Trinity exceptional is that it's an unexpected total blast yet the atmosphere feels so quaint, cozy and chill. The bartender makes you feel like you've been a regular for years (in a good way). There's such a polarizing feel to the bars on the UES - you have frat bars and yuppity bars. Trinity is so outside of the box in comparison.This is the best (almost kept) secret in the area.",5

I do not like noisy places so I kind of hesitated to go in there although I was curious why people love this pub so much. But I finally did go when the place was not too busy. Now I keep going back there! As other reviews say a bartender is so professional. (I only know one guy working inside of the bar.) He is so nice, talks politely but friendlily to the customers, asks for another drink in a perfect timing, and brings another round without asking what we are drinking. He just remembers customers' drinks no matter how busy the place is. It seems like a normal thing as a bartender, but it is actually very hard to get this level of service at the bars or even at the very expensive lounges.

Oppressively hot outside, I opted for a Magners Irish Cider. Served on ice, I definitely recommend ordering this on a hot day.They have a few HD TVs near the bar, but nothing really beyond that.

If someone asked me why I like Irish pubs, I would bring them to this small yet never claustrophobic place with a mid-sized bar with cream ales and stouts on tap and a full bar behind, and one single booth room with buttons in the leather cushions. The first time I went, they had an authentic Celtic band jamming away in there with a small mic dangling from the ceiling to amplify the beautiful sound.Conditions for a proper local hangout fully met by Trinity:*No one actually talks about being Irish, they just ARE. You don't feel left out if you are not Irish or of Irish descent*A tasteful James Joyceian era painting presides over the booth room*The same bartenders are always there and tell everyone happy new year*When I ask if someone is in the women's bathroom, the bartender laughs, ""Pull."" (because I'd only been pushing the door)*An old timer sits at the end of the bar and roars, ""This lady needs a chair!"" When I walk in. He keeps glancing over me and I assume he's just a batty perve until I realize that he is a part of the family there and was earnestly concerned over my not having a seat*The people at this bar are not actual alcoholics juxtaposed with 21+ college students; they are clean cut grown ups who like to have a cold one and cut loose a bit in the safety of friends*The staff gently vetoes songs that SUCK by slyly skipping the jukebox with a remote control*A dude walks around singing every word correctly but out of tune to obscure shanty songs and eighties hits like ""Voices Carry""*Drinks like the black and tan are not on a menu; they're a staple, and all you have to do is ask.*Everyone knows each others' names, but you don't feel sorry for themWell there's no use playing this place up too much more.

I won!""  He gave her the coupon.  A girl behind me asked me what the number was.  When I told her she showed me her ticket.  She'd actually won.  When we brought it to the bartender's attention, he sheepishly took the coupon from his friend and gave it to the girl who actually won the drawing.  Fucking sketchy.",5

There are only about a dozen seats at the bar and one single booth at the far end. However, I've always been able to get a seat here and the vibe is very chill and comfortable.The jukebox has a great selection and you as the patron have the power to change the mood with the click of a button. If Chris is your bartender, I believe that is when the bar is at its best. He is a very personable guy who knows his drinks and even introduced me to one of my favorite whiskeys - Powers. Chris won't have forgotten your name the next time you come in, and it's likely he won't have forgotten your drink either.STAR DEDUCTION: I took away a star because I frequently attend the Trivia Nights on Mondays where the winning team gets a $50 bar tab. Time and time again, the same group of people win Trivia Night and the interesting thing is they always come in together with the guy who writes all the questions. I thought that was a bit shady but I won't blame the bar for this. Be wary; it is likely that your next Trivia Night experience could be rigged.Nonetheless, I will redeem a star because the bar truly is a great joint. It's always a pleasant atmosphere even though it's small, and the people are very friendly and fun. This is probably the best bar in this neck of the woods and perhaps the entire Upper East Side. You'll love the low-key vibe.",1

The bartenders are great, I think they are both Irish (must be a prerequisite to work there). I was offered a taster of beer before I ordered which I love, and it was a healthy serving for sure. The main thing I like about this place is you feel like its a local bar in a small town. You talk to the bartenders and the other patrons but its not forced or awkward. If you want to talk, you have someone to chat with. At the same time, if you want to go for a few drinks after dinner with a date, there is definitely a lot of privacy too.One drawback, the beers were a little pricy for me.

That being said, it's a worthy trip for the camaraderie you get from the patrons and the bartenders. The latter are from Ireland directly, which makes ordering a Guinness feel authentic. The people that frequent the bar are lovely, and are willing to strike up conversations with strangers- something that I love to do.Their buy-back policy is fabulous, too, even if we were a little drunk to know that we were getting the drinks poured for us without ordering them.",
