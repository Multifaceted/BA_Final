0,Michael K.,"Aspen Hill, MD",142,21,14,4.0,9/22/2018,This place is low key and good. They are clean and the food is in my opinion better than any regular diner. Their selection on the menu is also great. Good spot to come to for a quick bite,,,
1,Sandra Chap C.,"Manhattan, NY",20,7,0,3.0,8/31/2018,"We had to ask 6 times for penne pasta with nothing on it and parmigiana on the side for a 5 year old. First they suggested that she would not like it that way. Then they repeated what we asked for and said they would have to ask the chef. We asked for 4 waters and a lemonade. They brought two waters, were not sure that the 13 year old who asked for the lemonade needed water and did not want to give a glass of water to the 5 year old because of the glass but didn't offer a plastic or paper cup. Three of our meals arrived and then they brought a duplicate meal we did not request. They asked us if WE had ordered two replica meals and we assured them we did not. We began eating and 7 minutes later had to ask for the penne pasta- repeating the same process. They asked if we wanted sauce-NO! They asked if we were sure-YES! My mango chicken was not flavorful. But I gave them 3 stars because the portions were large and my three other companions enjoyed their meals.",,,
2,Kendra C.,"New York, NY",51,171,469,5.0,5/14/2018,"Cute little diner type place with a huge variety of food to satisfy any craving. I couldn't decide what to get, but the server was very nice and told me which of each category was favored. From sandwiches to soups to asian platters, the choices were about endless.-Korean bbq beef over rice ($13): this was delicious. Chunks of beef tender and marinated, sauteed with peppers and onions. Served with rice and a salad. -Grilled hanger steak ($14): this was good but not exactly a steak, more similar to the chunks of beef in the previous dish. It came with a delicious mushroom sauce over it, with broccoli all over mashed potatoes. -Side of fries ($4): crispy perfectly seasoned fries, no complaints hereService is quick and friendly, food is delicious, a great spot for any type of food you may be looking for!",,1,
3,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",195,145,221,5.0,5/13/2018,"A little gem I've always passed by but never got the chance to try till now. It's a quaint little spot with very attentive and friendly staff. When I got seated, Linda offered to explain the menu and recommend dishes to me since there was such a huge array. I ended up getting the angus beef burger, grilled hanger steak, and Korean bbq beef over rice.The food came quite quickly. The burger was medium rare like I requested and was quite thick. Very tender and not dry. Quite delicious but the fries were the real winner here. The fries were extremely flavorful and crunchy without it being dry and wasn't small at all.The grilled hanger steak came out medium rare as well. Came with lots of broccoli and a good serving of mashed potatoes. The steak was extremely tender and paired extremely well with the mushroom sauce.The Korean bbq was my favorite. It was very flavorful and good portion sized. Everything was extremely affordable as well. Definitely pop in and give it a try if you haven't yet!",,,
4,H L.,"Concord, Staten Island, NY",25,18,49,4.0,7/24/2018,"My sister suggested this restaurant for a long time that the curry noodle is awesome.  It is a very comfortable place to eat and relax.   When I look at the menu, I don't see any curry dish that my sister suggested to me.   I asked the waitress did they have curry.   She told me that they only have curry beef or chicken over rice.    I was little disappointed because I was looking forward to try the curry noodle soup.  THe beef curry was very good however the portion is little small.   I would come back to try the curry noodle soup next time.",2,1,1

7,Jamie P.,"New York, NY",79,1,1,5.0,6/1/2018,I went in for a pickup. Ordered right when I got there and it only took about 8-10 minutes. I got penne pasta with pesto and grilled chicken and it was super delicious and priced well. Absolutely recommend!,,,
8,Soph N.,"New York, NY",11,105,424,5.0,2/22/2017,"Great lunch salads during the day and curry noodle options at night.

10,Hoyman L.,"New York, NY",248,238,2195,4.0,10/11/2017,"The Malaysian curry or they call it ""Asian Spicy Curry"" is what carries this place. All of the curry dishes are a must try, from the pancakes, to the soups and noodles.  The tofu skin is made on premise and is to die for. Yip Khuan Thye is the chef behind this. She was added into the eclectic mix of food they offer. It's too bad they don't offer bubble tea or Thai iced tea. That would just completely tie this place together.",1,1,1
11,Rachel K.,"New York, NY",291,11,427,4.0,6/6/2018,"This is my second time eating at Mama's. The first time I was here I dined in and this time I took food to go. Both times I tried different salads and both times I was at that level where I was satisfied mainly because of the large portions and not so much for the taste. It's standard food but nothing that my cravings would force me to come back for. I think another reason why I'm on the fence with this place is because their salads are a bit overpriced. Yes, their portions are huge but their ingredients are basic. And I can't justify spending $12-15 on a salad that just doesn't wow me. Maybe their other dishes are better and their salads need more work. I'm not too sure. But I do know that I won't go out of my way to eat here. If I happen to be in the area and something on their menu speaks to my stomach, then I'll return.",,,
12,Sylvia O.,"Manhattan, NY",1,58,1,4.0,1/4/2018,"If you work or live nearby, this is a good spot for an occasional lunch and dinner. I recommend eating here if you're in the area and looking for something that is not mainstream Chinese, Italian or Vietnam (or other specialities that you find in Chinatown). I wouldn't recommend coming out here just to try their food, though. I mainly get the Chef's Salad (TONS of meat, but it's all deli meat), avocado salad (sort of disappointed that they give only half an avocado instead of a whole avocado) or burger (not the best burger you can find/eat, but it's pretty good). Aiming to try their curry and pasta sometime, since I live close by.",,,
13,Susan H.,"New York, NY",306,168,284,4.0,6/8/2016,"Came here for dinner a few times and was surprised to find that Mama serves two menus: one from Mama and one from the Asian Spicy Curry pop-up. My boyfriend ordered from the curry menu and ended up getting the Curry Chicken. Me, being the ultimate pasta lover, ordered Linguine with tomato cream sauce and grilled chicken. We also got a Mama's Sampler on the side. Last time we came, we ordered the Mama's Sample but they forgot our order and closed the kitchen but this time, we finally got to try it. The Mama's Sampler came with a little bit of everything: calamari, wings, mozzarella sticks and spring rolls for around $10. It was pretty decent but I enjoyed my pasta dish the most. They are incredibly generous with the portion size, lots of linguine drowned in delicious creamy sauce. The grilled chicken that came with the pasta was a tad dry and burnt but I just dipped it in my sauce to cover these flaws. The curry dish was also delectable. The curry is most similar to Malaysian curry minus the spiciness. If you are looking for something spicy like a Thai Curry, I wouldn't recommend this. If you like pasta, give their pasta dishes a go!Overall, Mama is a decent spot if you are someone who hates waiting for seating (they have plenty of seats) and likes having a variety of delicious food to choose from. My sister recommended trying their salads so I will do so when I get the chance. Otherwise, you will find me at Mama, chowing down pasta.",2,1,
14,Sabrina L.,"New York, NY",257,85,231,3.0,8/17/2017,"I used to love this place ! I guess my palette has changed, and I'm a little more picky, and aware of more flavors, and what not. But, I just don't think it was the same at all to when they first opened. I guess I also feel like what I normally get, I can cook for way cheaper and a little more flavor. ( I usually get their grilled chicken pesto pasta) I guess it's a good bite when you're at work and need something quick, but not a place I'd recommend, or go out of my way to eat.",,1,
15,Damelis A.,"Bronx, NY",2,17,3,3.0,8/24/2018,"Hmmm..... I have been going to this restaurant during lunch hours for many years and it has gone threw a transformation in the way it services it customers. While the staff continues to be very friendly, they now seat you and you can order from your table. Before, you order at the counter sit at a table and they bring your food to you, very casual. Not sure why they changed it, but this more formal service might not be too attracting. Especially since this sort of service comes with a ""tip suggestion"" at the bottom of the receipt. A place that was so busy you would be smart to order from your office to go pick it up, is now empty. They do have a substantial menu with many options. But frankly unless you know the food.... you might end up with a flop meal. Stay away from the pasta primavera in Alfredo sauce, it's more like penne swimming in milk. Salmon wrap reads good on the menu, but doesn't taste like it. I had to add ketchup for flavor. Their prices have also gone up, but their food has not.",,,
16,Christa Faith J.,"Raleigh, NC",0,14,5,5.0,2/6/2018,"Loved the curry seafood, very fresh salmon, fresh curry. My Desert is always coffee with cream. Tried their bubble tea for the first time ever and loved it. Delicious.",,,
17,Joshua U.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,5,4,4.0,9/22/2016,"If you're craving for curry noodles, this is the place to go.A clean nice place, small but neat. Location is just a bit off the main road, you have to roam a little further in chinatown far away from the hustle and bustle. We were greeted by dull outside lighting but when you get inside it was bright and was halfway full of people.

First of all the staff, they are all super friendly and accommodating, the place is always clean and inviting, they just did a renovation and it's even better now, ok on to the food, everything on the menu is  fresh and delicious! There's something for everybody including salads,sandwiches pasta,steak etc..Even their healthier alternatives are fantastic and flavorful, for breakfast I like to enjoy the whole wheat pancakes with strawberries and bananas and fresh squeezed orange juice, for lunch all the sandwiches are great but my favorite would have to be the chicken hoagie on whole wheat, perfectly grilled chicken with an avocado spread spicy mayo, lettuce tomato on a fresh 9 grain whole-wheat hero, very simple but very delicious, comes with a side of coleslaw fries or salad you're only 9  bucks! Worth every penny, if you're in the area of Chinatown or Little Italy add this place to your list, it just may surprise you!",,,1
19,Min C.,"Manhattan, NY",255,52,72,5.0,5/8/2017,"OHH MY LORDD if you ever want to go straight into a heaven food coma and be happy for a week straight then this is the place to eat!! This place is like heaven for all asian curry lovers!! I always get their seafood curry with the thick noodles (they have different size noodles and flavors you can choose from!) As an appetizer, I got the roti pancake and side of rice (you have so much curry sauce leftover that eating it with the rice is extra yummy), the roti pancake taste extra good when you dip it in the curry sauce. Basically, I will dip anything in that curry sauce cause that's how good it is. When the waitress comes out with the food, you can instantly smell the curry aroma that fills the room. Another great great thing about this place is that it is sooo inexpensive. Each curry dish is around $9 and it is a BIG PORTION, I always have leftover curry sauce. (and yes, it taste just as good the next day if you use it on your rice) p.s. they serve their water in mason jars and I really like that :)",,,
20,Bezel L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,25,1,2.0,3/22/2017,"Been here many times for lunch and food and service is 5 stars. But just tried their breakfast today for the first time and quite a disappointment.Ordered two eggs over easy with a side of bacon and coffee. 1) Menu says choice of french fries or home fries and toast. Well they don't have home fries anymore, but did not update their menu.2) The butter packet was covered in, what I think is, syrup with a bread crumb sticking to it. Kinda gross. Clearly salvaged from someone's pancake/waffle order. It was perfectly sealed so sure, no need to throw it away, but at least wipe it down.3) Bacon is $2 extra. It was obviously ""re-fried"". Dried like leather and broke into pieces as soon as I stab it with a fork. (see pic) Since I took a few bites, I sincerely hope this was not also salvaged from someone else's plate like the butter.Love their other food, but will not be returning for breakfast.",1,,
21,Matt L.,"New York, NY",113,544,548,3.0,8/28/2015,"This place is hidden away next to the park behind Chinatown, so usually it isn't very crowded. When I usually come by either for take out or dine in, the food usually comes reasonably quickly, so this place is a decent option if you're in a hurry.Not specifically a Chinese restaurant, these guys primarily serve typical diner food. However, there are some asian inspired options, such as korean beef or kung pow chicken available. These options are pretty good, and should definitely be tried out. The drinks here are a little bit on the expensive side, so watch out.The one thing I am kind of confused about when it comes to this place is the service. It's not really clear to me if this place is specifically designated to be a takeout place, or a dine in. The service that you get when you dine in isn't really up to par, but then again, it could be a lack of understanding on my part.",,,
22,Alice Z.,"New York, NY",398,237,834,4.0,3/15/2016,"As much as I like this place, the hours are inconsistent. There are times when we go or call around maybe 12pm or afternoon and they're not open despite what their Yelp hours say. Food quality is very consistent and fresh, never had a problem with anything. It's hard to find American food in Chinatown, and this place is definitely a gem. What surprised me the most is how good their bubble tea was! I ordered a peach bubble tea and it was better than most bubble tea joints I've tried. Thank you for that. I love peach. But on a side note, I ordered the fresh squeezed mango juice and I didn't like it at all. It tasted fresh for sure, but it had a really weird taste to it. Also, delivery is incredibly quick (then again were only about 3 blocks away). We ordered about $130 worth of food and it was delivered in less than 30 minutes. The cashier who took our (really long and complicated) order was really efficient.",3,1,2
23,Julia P.,"New York, NY",133,22,0,5.0,12/8/2017,"I live very close to this place, and I just wanted to give them some love here. I am a regular here because the spicy curry is amazing! I get the veggie soup and it's just... perfect. If you get it to go, they package the curry and the noodles/veggies separately. When I first saw that I thought it was such a nice detail. I haven't tried anything else here because I don't need to; trust me, come for the curry and you won't be disappointed.",,,
24,Erica L.,"Columbia Heights, Washington, DC",49,447,136,2.0,4/14/2016,"My team ordered a smattering of salads, sandwiches, and hot dishes from here recently.  I was sorely disappointed.  The hot dishes (salmon over greens, chicken over greens, etc.) looked wilted and lacking in color.  I opted for the salmon nicoise, which is usually a favorite dish of mine, but man did it disappoint.  The salad leaves were a little wilted and old, and not cut right so one piece was attached to 15 others, making it hard to eat.  The salmon was crusted so heavily in pepper it was pretty much inedible, and the wasabi-like cream sauce didn't add much.  Nor was the salad mixed.  It haphazardly included some roasted red peppers, a hastily chopped boiled egg, and olives, but they didn't mesh together like they should in a nicoise.  I begged -- begged -- my team not to order this again.  When I selected the two star rating, yelp said ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""  That's the appropriate description of the lunch I had.",,,
25,Leung T.,"San Francisco, CA",119,532,3325,4.0,12/23/2014,"Another non-Chinese place in Chinatown.

35,Benjamin R.,"Milwaukee, WI",75,1,0,5.0,3/10/2016,I took 13 8th graders from Wisconsin to Mama Eatery. The staff indulged a student with dangerous allergies making a special dish that she could eat. Vegetarian children could find things to eat easily on the menu. The staff was constantly helpful polite and catered to the students like they owned the place. The fact that adventurous students could get delicious Asian noodle dishes while more traditional students could get hamburgers is a plus that could not be beat on top of all that the Asian noodle dishes were truly outstanding. I have lived in Asia for more than 2 years and this was some of the best Asian food I ever had in America. Go to Mama Eatery.,1,1,1

Although the Mozzarella Sticks and Onion Rings and Whole Wheat Pancakes and Smoked Salmon Platter definitely left a lot to be desired, the Fried Calamari was pretty decent considering the reasonably low price, as were the Mama Burger and the French Toast. But the Mama Salad was freak-show, a whole lot of wrong and dry. Raisins and green olives and cheddar cheese and cucumber and crutons and carrots and tomatoes and hard-boiled egg and about twelve different kinds of lettuce, some of which are really bitter.

I even travel from midtown to chinatown so I can get this for lunch!The place is pretty clean and atmosphere is comfortable. The reason why this place gets a 4 is because during the weekday, sitting down to eat is tough. It took 20 minutes for a salad, a SALAD, to arrive at the table. Meanwhile, others who ordered to go and to stay, salad and non-salads, received their food. I ordered the salad when no one was there.

Updated review","STAP WHY ARE YOU SO DELICIOUS?I just want to clarify from my previous review that I didn't like their sandwiches because of the bread they use. Sometimes it's okay but sometimes it's a miss for me. Their fries are addicting. Wish they opened for an extra hr on the weekends. You really can't go wrong here.Breakfast is really awesome here but I have trouble waking up in time for it so it's always great when I can have it. Don""t like their toast though. It's really hard ;(",,,

My first time going there, I ordered the Mango Chicken Salad. It was perfect. the grilled chicken was juicy and flavorful, also the mango was sweet. The next time i went.. my chicken was dry and burnt, also the mango was unripe. The time after that, I ordered it with balsamic vinegar. They ended up giving me some creamy version of that, so i asked them to change it for vinegar.. they ended up giving me the vinegar that you would use for Shanghai buns. -.-But still even though everytime i go there. i don't know what my food will end up tasting..

67,Jacky H.,"New York, NY",111,15,0,4.0,9/13/2014,"Their burgers are so tiny! But it taste so good and surprisingly filling. Definitely recommending the Chicken Burger. Has that mini burnt taste that is needed in every burger. Plus it comes with onions and lettuce that gives a good mix taste. You can choose between a side order of onions, french fries, or cole slaw. The side orders come in a good amount since the burgers are so small. There are usually seats available depending on when you come in. During lunch time, it's mainly 80% cops and 20% business workers. Weekend mornings are usually filled with people from the hotel next door since apparently Mama's made a deal with them. The workers know me by now so they're friendly with me and I can easily start a conversation with them, but there's always that one loud worker who gets on my nerve and makes me want to leave. She once yelled at me for not getting the bag with food (I was wearing earphones and listening to music). Maybe I'm just sensitive or that's her way of having fun with the customer, but I don't really like her.",,,

Their baked salmon sandwich is my fav. It's made-to-order, and dressed with a creamy chipotle sauce that reminds me of the American southwest. Super yummy & delish. French fries are served crisp & hot, in a generous portion perfect for sharing :-) Independent eateries like this cute place deserve our thanks for giving us alternatives to the sameness of Starbucks, Olive Garden, Applebees -- you know, the chain gang.

I searched high and low for something not Chinese in the area and my options included McDonalds and Mama Eatery so I decided to give it a shot.It was raining out and a bit chilly for August so I ordered clam chowder and a salad. I think my total was $16 which was quite a lot for what I received. The chowder was delicious and that's saying something considering I'm from Boston and we all know that's where the best 'chowda' is. My salad was alright. It had a ton of veggies, mixed greens, and goat cheese. Honestly the menu could have said cow poop with goat cheese and I would have ordered it, that's how much I love that stuff! However, the salad wasn't anything special.The service was pretty good. It basically feels like a deli but if you stay in to eat they will serve you the food at your table. It did get a bit crowded after we were finished eating around 1:30pm which says a lot for NYC (usually the lunch crowd comes at noon).I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if I find myself lost in Chinatown now I know I won't be forced to eat dumplings or noodles!",3,,

I am trying to tell myself that what negative feelings I have about this place may be due to my awkward date rather than the vibe of the actual place--so I will try to be a little forgiving in my judgements.The cafe was very well-lit, spacious, and empty; seems like it would be a great place to study or meet up with a colleague to chat. I was a bit disappointed with the limited bubble tea selection. That being said, the hot peach green tea I ordered with tapioca balls was perfect at kid's temperature and the balls were soft, supple, and well cooked. The barista also seemed pretty nice and she got us our drinks quick enough. I'm sure I would have striked a conversation with her if I wasn't trying so hard to brainstorm a date-escape plan. In conclusion and to be perfectly fair, despite the strongest feeling I'm remembering about this place being how horribly awkward I felt being there and how badly I couldn't wait to leave the cafe, I'm still giving it a good review because (unlike my date) the place, drinks, and service themselves were warm, delicious, and welcoming.",1,1,1

I had a BBQ burger that I can't remember the name of, but it was served with mixed greens, onions and cheddar cheese. I also got it with a side of onion rings, but I don't recommend getting those. The onion rings are you standard, cheap onion rings so stick with the fries.The place itself doesn't really have a mood. It's a nice, clean place that is well lit but it's hard to describe the feel other than causal and pretty standard.Anyway, if you're looking for a quick place with good service and good, cheap food...this is your place!

Updated review","I was invited by my favorite group of guys to have lunch at mama's today. Usually, i sit at my desk and read blogs for lunch so actually having a conversation was awesome!We got on line and placed out orders. The place was empty for lunchtime- but it was Noon... No one really eats at Noon, right? the men order their food and then i order mine. We opt to dine and find a table. The waitress comes and to each of the men, hands them a platter of salad. SALAD. And then she leaves to get my BURGER. Me, the lady. A Burger. The MEN around me? Salads. Yup, i owned them at lunch. and we had a good laugh our non stereotypical lunch. The salads are huge tho and from what i saw; Men shoveling forkfuls of lettuce in their mouth like they never ate before- the salads look wonderful. My burger was awesome and my fries were perfect. I couldnt eat all the fries and tried to share them with the boys...but they just ate SALAD- they refused. How did i get stuck with such a bunch of girls! lol. Mama's hardly disappoints.",3,,
82,Michelle C.,"Crest Hill, IL",27,128,9,3.0,12/6/2011,"If you happen to stay at Hotel Mulberry in Chinatown during your trip to NYC, you're bound to end up at this joint. Hotel Mulberry gives breakfast vouchers to each guest for breakfast in the mornings and so on my second day of staying at the hotel, I made my way a few door down to Mama's. I had read reviews on TripAdvisor that Mama's is jam packed full of NYPD in the morning and man - they we're lying. I got in about 9:30am (weekday) and there was hardly a table to sit at. Just as I'd read, the tables were bursting with NYPD. I was confused at first then realized that the courthouse and several other county offices are nearby, and considering that this is the only non-Asian food option around (minus Little Italy two block up), I wasn't surprised. The Hotel Mulberry menu sits on the counter with about 6 different options to choose from. Once you're in line you feel very rushed. You're meant to place your order then find a table to sit at. Trouble was I was so worried about not getting a table that I blanked on my order and just pointed to the first option on the menu, the banana pancakes. I didn't show the clerk my hotel voucher right away (I'd assumed she'd understand I was from Hotel Mulberry since I was ordering off the menu) and she was aggravated that I didn't show her the voucher before ordering (talk about friendly service...). I sat down at a table in the corner that was such a tight fit, I didn't think I'd be able to breathe. My food arrived pretty quickly and was served on a Styrofoam plate with plastic silverware and my coffee was in a to-go cup. Hm. I get it - my breakfast was ""free"" but ultimately I'm paying for it somewhere (in the room rate, etc.), so treat me like I'm a regular customer and give me REAL china dishes with my pancakes. I was a little put out that I didn't get butter with my pancakes (only syrup), but the pancakes were sweet enough that I didn't need much else. The pancakes were thick and good, but served nearly on top of a fruit medley that looked and tasted like it'd come out of a can - not appetizing. The coffee was so-so and nothing to write home about. I wondered if all the NYPD crew got their food for free because I couldn't imagine it being that packed if not. The place is okay but  I wasn't impressed. I was in and out as fast as possible, also considering that my tight table faces a half-wall that left my ""view"" either the Christmas tree or the door entrance. Service is so-so and not really as friendly as it could be considering the volume of service they receive. I would not go back and pay out of pocket.",,,
83,Adam C.,"New York, NY",17,42,0,2.0,4/24/2011,"This place is near my work.  When I am sick of eating Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, etc., but want something quick and in the neighborhood I go here.  Lord knows why, since it isn't very good, or very cheap, or very anything really.I usually get a pasta dish.  They last two meals, so are good if you are eating lunch and will be at the office for dinner, too.  But, they aren't good in the sense that they have very little taste to them.Two things that are particularly annoying about this place:(1) They ask your first name when you order.  Fine.  No problem.  But, I end up repeating myself at least five times.  Seriously, my name is Adam, how hard is that?  Heaven forbid a Margaret or an Ingrid calls.  Usually I just give up and accept whatever ridiculous name the person at the other end assigns me (once it was Justin.  how in the world do you get Justin out of Adam?)  And, if it is hard, if for some reason you aren't good with names or good at hearing or whatever, don't bother asking.  It is not like you ask what my name is when I come pick up my order.  Mine is the only order on the counter behind you.  Geez.(2)  I always order a diet coke.  Every time.  About 20% of the time they forget.  I pay (with a credit card) and look in the bag and there is no diet coke.  I say, hey, I ordered a diet coke, too (realizing that I am now doomed since I have no cash and I am not getting a diet coke).  They respond, each time without fail, ""no, you didn't order one.""  Well, yes I did.  I always order one. I want one.  You, who can't differentiate ""Adam"" from ""Justin,"" either didn't hear me, didn't care, or just plain forgot.  Stop passing the blame.  All I ask is a simple, ""sorry,"" and all I ever get is the same stupid ""you didn't order one.""  Argh.",,1,

98,Min L.,"Newark, NJ",49,22,0,4.0,8/23/2011,"This cafe/diner probably has the best sandwichs/wraps around the chinatown area. They got some good ass fries! Been going there for a few years now. Food is always good, the down side is the prices keep on rising.",,,
99,A H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,5.0,11/9/2013,"It's so cheap! It's Italian food made by Chinese/Mexican people, but it's delicious and so cheap. My bf and I love the fusilli chicken! It has roasted sun dried tomatoes and just the perfect amount of garlic and olive oil. It's not too salty or bland. And the service is great, once, we went like 5 minutes before closing and the cashier still let us order. The decor is like that of a diner. Their sandwiches are huge and they don't skimp on the meat.",,,
100,Mark Y.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",5,6,0,4.0,10/13/2011,"Highly recommend the breakfast menu its pretty good. Great and tasty burgers, pastas and salads. There is always a seat and the food comes out fast. Wonderful and funny staff and lets not forget the big ole plasma TV they have. If your ever in the neighborhood definitely stop by this place and give them a  try. The price is fair and affordable.",,,
101,Tina L.,"New York, NY",106,312,1502,3.0,3/17/2009,"We ordered lunch takeout from here a few times. Staff was quick and polite. Make your own pasta is for the lazy who can't cook their own. There tend to be too much sauce on the sandwiches and burgers. Great for quick, greasy, filling lunch.",,,
102,Gregory P.,"Falls Church, VA",120,28,10,4.0,1/14/2011,You order a burger medium or medium rare and that's what you get.  You get a delicious burger ordered the way you asked.,,,

107,F N.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,87,0,4.0,4/6/2008,"I've never tried their food before but must say they make good coffee!  Coming from a coffee junkie, this says a lot.  The staff is always super friendly that's why I often sojourn here to get a nice-strong cup of coffee.  This cute little place does get pretty hectic, especially during lunch-time when people working in/around city hall stop by.",1,,

109,Mindy S.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,21,2,4.0,1/24/2012,"Love this place. Ive been here way too many times that I'm friends with the staff. Love the atmosphere about this place and the staff is very nice and hilarious. Food is good pretty decent grub. They have a bunch of tasty salads, a wide variety of burgers and wraps, large entrees, and lets not forget a very cheap breakfast menu. Another bonus and thumbs up about this place is the big screen TV. They might have news on at most times since its located near downtown and a police precinct, but if you go up to one of the staffs and ask them to change the channel or put a game on they would!! Cant argue with the prices they are pretty decent and I mean the food comes out good for that price so I cant complain. I highly recommend this place to whoever is in the area and tired of grabbing chinese food haha.",,,
