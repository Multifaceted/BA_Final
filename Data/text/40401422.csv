0,Kris T.,"Queens, NY",0,4,0.0,5.0,9/16/2018,"Popped in last night after a long shift at work.The crowd was full of very.. interesting characters to say the least.Bartender Lauren was killing it. She's got awesome taste in music and really knows her whiskeys. It was pretty hectic as the place is kind of small for the amount of people that were hanging about, but she could hold down a legit conversation and keep the booze flowing. This place is fun and quirky. I'm glad i stopped in and I'll definitely be back soon.",,,
1,Mandy B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,2,0.0,1.0,10/14/2018,"Supports Rape Culture - Disgusting! I've lived in the hood for 21 years, went to this nasty place when it actually looked like a dive, before it's renovation. I walk in Sat around 8pm, tried to order a drink, some very old, scraggly, trashed chic sitting at the bar starts screaming 'fresh meat, fresh meat!!' pointing at me! I tried yelling over her explaining how long I've been in the hood. She yelled back that she worked in that bar for 5 years, she never saw me before. I was disgusted but had faith in the bartender behind the bar - nope, no support!!!  The bartender's response when I try to order a drink and complain about this chic. 'the only voice I hear is yours!' I immediately left. Really?! The bar is so loud you have to yell. And ok bartender you're supporting the rape culture too! 'Fresh Meat?! Disgusting!!!! Everyone should go to Bobs Your Uncle. They'd never allow anyone to scream 'fresh meat!' to anyone!And you will see the owners 'response' to this. And yet he makes another 'excuse'. Look back through all his responses. He never owns anything!! Always makes an excuse!And this this time, of course it's my fault. I don't think so!!! He says I was intoxicated. I was tipsy, but no where near 'overly intoxicated' or even near the level of what the drunk patron/bartender my side of the bar was! Mind you, this was the one screaming 'fresh meat!' and pointing at me! Oh yeah, that's totally something a sober person would do!To the owner, just the mere fact, that you went for the 'you were overly intoxicated' excuse with no apologies and blind belief in what your staff said goes to show you cannot be trusted and you do support rape culture!!! Why would I make up that incident?!When I'm overly intoxicated, I own it! And when I'm treated in such a way that supports rape culture, I will report the facts and that is what I did. Were you there?!",,,
2,Peter K.,"New York, NY",342,478,2495,5.0,8/3/2018,"My friend invited me to come here for his birthday party. I reluctantly entered this small venue, surprised by the eclectic decorations of the bar. I experienced serious culture shock, my dude. The decorations seemed like rejections from a wife who told her husband to return his Pier One/Bed Bath Beyond/Lowes impulse purchases to the store... yet the husband forgot to return them and left them here. Once you acclimate to the Narnia/Stranger Things-like fantasy world environment, the bartenders work tirelessly to keep you here. Olivia, my bartender, witty, funny and charming, made me feel at home. Yes, miss, I'll have another. This has the stigma of a dive bar, but that's unfair. There are several excellent craft beers on draft. Dogfish Head Siracusa Nera, an imperial stout? Allagash Curieux, a tripel? Ladies and gentleman, this dive bar is not f-cking ordinary. Add in your Moscow mules in those cute copper cups and you are the party. Thank you Olivia and Broadway Dive for your hospitality. I will be back.",2,2,1
3,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,5.0,7/15/2018,"Probably the best beer bar on the UWS and my favorite of the Dive Bar trio.  Broadway Dive is dark, narrow space that feels cluttered but somehow homey.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  There are a lot of tables given the size of the space, in addition to a long bar.  There is also somehow a hidden loft space with more private tables up a flight of stairs.  It's all weird and I love it.Cases for beer that can be consumed are up front and towards the back.  The selection is excellent, as is the curation on taps.  Any beer in a case can be taken to go or drank on the premises for a nominal corkage fee; this fee doesn't scale up for bombers, so this is a very good deal.  Beers available range from the accessible (lagers from local microbreweries like Three's, bottles of London Pride) to the eclectic (Dogfish Head Fort from 2015ish, super heavy IPAs).  There's something for everyone.If you're a beer drinker on the UWS and you don't go here, you're not trying.  I don't go everyday, but I always love visit when I have time to.  Get to it.",1,1,1
4,Shelton H.,"Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, NY",44,172,8,4.0,9/25/2018,"Do you like Dive bars? I do. Especially when they're well appointed with giraffes (that's right, multiple giraffes), deer, string lights and every whisky and craft beer you've heard or and never heard of. They have other booze, and they serve food, too. It's tiny, you get to know your neighbor in a good way. It's a neighborhood joint and it's worth stopping in. It's kind of a classy dive bar, if that's a thing.",,,

6,Eitan B.,"Bronx, New York, NY",83,9,1,5.0,7/17/2018,"Great bar for a small get together. Small outdoor seating area when weather permits, sports on the gigantic and seemingly wall-to-wall flat screen TVs, and a friendly and attentive staff (see Erin). BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING - They have some phenomenal, and most importantly, seasonal beers on tap. So often you find small dives that claim to be seasonal and keep up with the seasons and what's trending, but so few deliver. I was here when they had McKenzie's seasonal brew on tap and it was amazing; like a big ol' hug in a class. This was a recommendation by Erin who walked me through my tastes in beer. Needless to say she chose a winner. The ambiance is your classic eclectic crazy-stuff-on-the-walls kind of style but don't let that mislead you, the vibe in the room is chill. 100% worth a stop in for a pint (or 6 - the prices are pretty great too, even for NYC).",,1,

10,Rianna R.,"Manhattan, NY",32,72,95,4.0,6/10/2017,"Every time I've walked past this place, I've made a mental note to check it out. Finally stopped in for one quick drink, but wound up staying a few hours. The variety of beers (and even wine) on tap is huge and so much better than the basics of most dive bars. The music was great, and we wound up talking to half of the people in the place. Most seemed like regulars, and it's clear why you'd want to come back. All in all, the definition of divey in the best way.",,,
11,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",143,726,51,5.0,5/26/2018,"Normally a place has to be amazing for me to give 5 stars but I'm giving Broadway Dive 5 stars to balance out the reviews from the crazies who seem to frequent this place.

I've been to dive bars around the country and I wish this establishment was at home. Erin, the bartender, is just flat out phenomenal! 10/10, I guarantee you I will be here everyday until I fly home.",,,
16,D S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,6/4/2018,"Broadway Dive is a big breath of fresh air! Places like these really help keep the neighborhood vital; they help me forget about all the pointless Chase Manhattans, Pinkberries and boring yuppie bar & grills. Although I point out a few small negatives in this review, I'm still assigning five stars because of the oasis-like placement of the establishment, as well as the fact that I'm currently tipsy on their alcohol and therefore still spiritually indebted to them.The vibe of the place is very well-considered. Cozy, but with just the right amount of New York ""edge."" The extra balcony seating is a cool touch that makes the bar really feel like a clubhouse. The music's generally good, mostly from the 20th century rock and pop canon, but with some more modern stuff as well. Their AC situation is kind of quirky--every 15 minutes or so, the entire place is briefly blasted with an arctic gale. Sometimes it's nice, other times it's annoying. C'est la vie.While the bartenders run the gamut from attentive to spaced out, I've found them to be consistently polite, which goes a long way. Now the first time I came was on a Saturday, and there was a single bartender who was clearly overtaxed by the slightly raucous and demanding patrons. And I'll admit, getting her attention after my first drink was a frustrating exercise. But I get that this is just a part of how the business works, so I didn't take it personally, and I did eventually get served. And the next time I came on a Sunday, the service was just fine. The legal max capacity for this place is about 75 people. On a busy night the attendance seems to be roughly half that, which is perfect in my mind. I really like that the general turnout in this place is robust, but not overbearing. It's rarely depressingly dead, but it's also rarely so packed that you feel uncomfortable. The patrons are mostly chill and reasonably diverse for the area, which is always a plus. Save for the bottled Epic beef jerky, which I love, I have not tried the food. It sounds like basic bar fare. I could definitely see myself ordering some if I were in the right mood. I haven't seen anyone order food here, but maybe that's just timing. In general I don't need bars to have food at all, and if they do, some simple carbs and protein should do. Dive's menu seems to have that covered.The well drinks that I've had are all pretty good. As far as I can tell, they keep their taps clean. While I haven't ever ordered anything that I felt was mind-blowing or even particularly notable really, that isn't what I'm here for anyway, so it's okay.Normally I dislike prominent flatscreens in bars, and flatscreens tuned to sporting events even less so. It's become a trend in this area and it's one that usually mutes the fun of a bar environment for me, but this is one strange case in which it does not really bother me. I think because there are actually multiple random channels on display, it feels slightly more like anything-goes ambience and less like basic bro territory. The sporting channels do catch the most eyeballs in here, but thankfully they're usually not a focal point.Although the nearby Dive on Amsterdam has been a reliable mainstay, I like Broadway Dive much better personally. I've lived in this neighborhood on and off for decades and I remember when even places like Malachy's or the Dead Poet were fun, vibrant scenes; this place picks up the ball they apparently dropped years ago. Overall, I'd say anyone in this area looking for a classic, comfy watering hole to have a few drinks in couldn't do much better than this. Establishments in the area could learn something from the Broadway Dive; we don't need more stodgy family-style ""burgers, baseball and Budweiser"" joints that are empty by 9 pm. We need solid social gathering places, god damn it!The drink list is a combination of familiar and adventurous, leaning appropriately more towards the former than the latter. I had an interesting cask ale and an Akashi single malt one time, a few rounds of basic pale ale the next, and liked both times equally.Check it out!",,,
17,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4006,4.0,11/27/2016,"We were at the corner of 101 and Broadway to meet our friends.  A large neon sign spelled Tavern, so we walked across the street and entered into this tiny shot gun new england movie set of a bar with high ceilings, wood work, Christmas lights, and loads of random tchotchkes with a curious friendliness I might imagine in John Waters Baltimore. We took a round seating area by the window and gathered with a bunch of friends and engaged in easy flowing  conversation. Wines on tap run around $9, but beer is the thing to get here with a large tap selection including high abv craft choices like delirium tremons. ""Who ordered a knish?"" The bartender yelled.It was passed to my friend who ate it with a plastic knife and fork.  ""Microwaved."" he muttered as he struggled with the rubbery slab.""How much did you pay for that?"" ""$3"" he guessed.""The burger is $3.50"" I advised. The knish looked weak, but the food offerings are just basic bar food to keep you drinking, and talking, and drinking, and talking, and you will.This friendly inconspicuous little bar offers some love in the 101 st area.  Go with some friends if you're in the area and plan to stay awhile.Atmosphere - fun old bar with character, and neighborhood locals hanging out.The drinks - large beer selection, sure to please most everyone's taste. Service - down home and no frills fun.",4,,4

22,Me L.,"New York, NY",257,3,0,1.0,3/29/2018,"Wanna-be COYOTE UGLY type of bar - but without the bras and simply just UGLY bartenders""! Oh how we miss Hogs 'n Heifers. That is what the owner 'LEE S.' dreams to be. ""You will never ever ever be anything close to that. I finally saw your face + stature online. You look like you were bullied all your life. I'm sorry for you but you chose to bully right back and that is just simply weak."" (notice how few of the reviews are actually from people from this neighborhood. Mostly tourist, who don't live here and never come back) I am a long time UWS woman who resides here since 1993. We've only come to these bars cause they are open late and near us for a last drink. The latest incidence (which seems to be normal for these bars) is when I walked in with one of my well-known musician friends who just played with a Talk show band whom I sang for as well for a benefit party for the ones in need (we both live up here) and I suggested to go there. Stupid me. What was I thinking! My friend could not believe what happened when I walked into the place. He will NEVER EVER COME BACK and definitely will tell everyone to steer clear from this madness he witnessed tonight. All we heard was a yelling on the top of her lungs screeching shouting Russian bartender - who is always sloppy drunk. She sounded like a witch or siren, the guests all stared at her in shock of how loud she was. There was a Dutch woman before her who also screamed at the guests at the top of her lungs. Almost psychotic, always challenging everyone in the place. So, make sure you don't say or do something they might not like, you'll be banned for life. LOL. Just simply hating on people. Who does that?! Miserable people, just like the owner. It always comes from the top. He simply HATES his UWS neighbors and consumers. He despises and bans people from his bars for years, just to make himself feel better. Damn.. so sad. I never forget when I saw the 96 street dive bar staff, incl. a huge bullying bouncer, kick out a 90 year old true NYker who yelled ""STELLA STELLA"" because that was his only thing in life left to say to be funny. In the bar tender's eyes, just a few too many times, so they had the strong muscles bouncer kick him to the street onto the ground, almost making him fall on his face. WHO DOES THAT!?  Only A-holes! And that is what these people are all about. NON CULTURED PIECES OF * )(*&)(&*W!  If you are a tourist, maybe you are looking for that thrill and thinking they will give you a movie experience?! Sure .. they'll take your money.. and know they'll never see or care about you again! It's like going to the Soup Nazi on 55th street. Rather go there for a Seinfeld thrill. But imagine actually living here, and having to put up with this in your own hood. I'd say steer clear from these ABUSIVE bars and their screeching, frowning and oh so unhappy bar mates who are a bunch of jealous losers who HATE good looking, interesting, wordly, artistic people who actually live here and make an honest living. They are more interested in people visiting from around the world.. thinking they are actually at the ""COYOTE UGLY"" bars in the movies.. ha ha... not even close!  Mostly they are frustrated and failing Comedians, musicians, models ..etc. Wait, they have never actually made it at all, that's why they working there at 40 years old. And their abusive boss.. telling them to keep on kicking out the GOOD, the STRONG and the REAL PEOPLE. How many real actors, comedians, celebrities go there??? ZERO! If they do or ever have gone .. they walk in and sense the NONSENSE! The word on the street is YUCK owner! NYC in the old days would never have aloud these bars to even exist. I know of at least 10 people who are  long time neighbors who have been banned from this disgusting establishment .. some of who are Art directors, Ad agency owners, actors, musicians, bankers... etc. THE REAL UPPER WEST SIDERS. Ask the wait staff where they live - Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, etc... they have no clue what it takes to survive and live in Manhattan and they never will, because they alienate themselves from us.  And the frustrated boss Lee S. (look him up) who actually thinks he owns the buildings he rents the spaces from (sorry you are just a tenant dude) and creates these angry frustrated employees! We are noticing you dude, not in a good way what-so-ever. No wonder you kick out people.. you remind me of those CATFISH guys who create false profiles to trick and hate on people just because you've been mistreated as a lonely neglected child. Because of you own complexes. STOP IT and come clean! Be kind, the one above is watching and noticing your hatred. If it weren't for the hostil and the cheap hotels in the hood with the tourists in the warmer months, you'd be out of business. And you know it! Wait till the tables turn on you my dear, and they will. What comes around always goes around. You are a UGLY HATER! All of you and your staff inside and out. You are banned in our lives.",,3,

She has a very bad attitude with me all the time. I felt like she hates me. But i thought i got a misunderstanding. But there is the reason i stopped visiting there was few months ago. It was one of weekdays and no crowded at the bar. I sat at the bar seat with my friend. Yeah she was there and she saw us when we walked in. She was the only one there who works that day. But she was drinking with few people at the end of the bar. I don't know they were friends or costumers. I was like ok let's wait because she saw us. And when we wanted to order i saw her and she i eye contacted with me but ignored me and then keep drinking and hanging out with them. I told my friend that maybe i look too Asian so you order. He is a Caucasian. He tried to order like me but the same things. Ehh i was so mad at her. She looks like she doesn't wanna sell drinks to me. Anyway I left the bar and we went to another bar near by and then enjoyed there. I usually don't write a review but this time i want you to know about that bartender.

Updated review","Broadway Dive has become one of my regular bars in the city. There are often many Friday or Saturday nights when I don't want to go out, but, by the same token, I don't want to sit around my apartment or the beau's apartment and feel like a loser. (Heheh.) Located one block from where the beau lives (BLESSED), we definitely come here a few times a month for a chill drink. The bar area downstairs is great but occasionally crowded; I don't think a lot of people know about the upstairs area, because it's not very pronounced and usually empty when we sneak up there! It's such a wonderful respite!As always, they have good beers, ciders, and wines on draught. For a corkage fee, you can pop open one of the various bottles of beers and ciders they have scattered in fridges throughout the downstairs. We usually purchase a pint of cider or a well drink from the bar, but we'll occasionally get a larger bottle of cider and split between the two of us; even with the corkage fee, it usually amounts to $5 or $6 a glass per person, and we each get about two glasses worth. Not too shabby! I love the folks that run it, I love the atmosphere, and...what else can I say? I just love it here! I always feel at home and content, whenever I go.",4,3,4

It's a really cosy small bar. I love those.But they had a good beer selection. They had sour beer which i've been having trouble finding even in NYC. They had it! I imagine this is a neighbourhood bar. We were here on a Saturday early evening. Only about 4 people in there. But usually small bars like this are filled with people who know each other from this neighbourhood. Would be a great place I think to meet people if you were new to the area. I'm guessing!",4,2,3

It's definitely the cheapest happy hour around, it has great personality inside, and the staff are super chill and warm. 3 of us ordered cheeseburgers and imported beers and the total was just a little over $20 altogether.

My brother recently visited from VA so I took him, my girlfriend, and her sister to this spot. I'd give the divey appearance and feel of the bar a pretty high score, maybe even a 5. There is a small upstairs area and when my brother and I went up to explore there was a strange couple making out on the couch up there. The bartender was a tall blonde woman, with an accent, maybe Russian or Polish, I couldn't quite figure it out. The service was fine, I wouldn't say she was rude but she was a bit short and had no clue which beer I was ordering even though I was reading it right off the menu. I did ask her to surprise me with a beer and she picked a good one. I don't think they serve real food, but they do sell hotdogs and pickles and stuff like that. They also take credit card, which is a plus. Prices were pretty good, craft pints running around $6 and some nicer ones were a bit more. Can't complain, in midown any pint of cheap lager will cost $6 anyway. Overall I'd say 3.5 stars but I'll round it up to 4. I'd come back.",1,,

56,Darwin G.,"New York, NY",277,966,67,4.0,4/26/2015,"An interesting mix of a bar and beer store. Walking in, it seems like a divey, old fashioned bar, but instead offers a craft beer selection on tap and is surrounded by beer fridges. The beers are for both to go or for stay (with corkage fee). The beer selection is not only the the few fridges at the entrance, but actually all over, in the back, the side, by the bar, etc. The selection is diverse and prices are great. I recommend it especially since you can mix and match beers instead of having to buy a full 4-6 pack of a single beer.The craft beer selection is good, with a decent amount of locals. They do growler fills of whatever is on tap.On a Sunday afternoon, the bartender was swamped. She was the only person working. She was bartending, scanning beer for to go, and preparing bar food in the kitchen. The bar clearly needed more staff. However, she was a kind about the wait and working as fast as she could.",1,,

61,Josh K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",292,1301,45,4.0,8/9/2014,"Nice bar. It's not quite disgusting enough to be a dive bar, but the drinks are relatively affordable - an eclectic selection of pints as cheap as $6 or $5 if you are happy with PBR. You can take home bottles and growlers which is a nice touch, but I rarely avail of such things (buying 6 packs tends to be more economic per fl. oz than filling a growler.) They have good looking food and $6 beer-shot combos. (The beer of choice was racer 5 when I went, good deal, and the shot? Weird moonshine / flavored vodka stuff. Egh, but hey, it's basically a free shot.)It has a neighborhood feel and you'll often find the patrons are regulars who talk to each other, which I always love about bars that don't have that stupid ""I'm here to be seen with my friends"" vibe.All things being equal, this bar can't displace Lion's Head Tavern from that special place in my heart.

Something for everyone, but you won't come here to eat, you'll come here for convo, beer, and maybe to watch a game with music on. the only bartender i've been served by there is super chill.I've been here a couple of times, but most recently it was game 3 of the series, 1st game at wrigley, and the game was on and a few cubs fans were there. I'm a mets fan and could really care less which of these loser teams was going to move on to win the series (kidding...), but they didn't have the audio of the game on but there were captions, and we all watched bill murray sing ""take me out to the ballgame"" and about half ways through, around ""buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks"" someone started to belt it out and then we all joined in and the entire fairly packed bar of mostly disinterested patrons were singing take me out the ballgame together with bill murray and it was just pretty awesome, very memorable, and the crowd i brought there were all impressed with the NYC experience.",,,

It's extremely narrow and can be hard to maneuver around, and the crowd is, well, what you'd expect in the UWS, but the bartenders are generally attentive and kind enough.The biggest pain in the ass about the bar is that none of the bottles are priced, so it means you either have to spend several minutes thumbing through their menu online to check the price of each beer or just be hit with the surprise when you go to be rung up.

We were served by a sweet foreign bartender who let us sample things we hadn't tasted before. I visited again today to celebrate my beau's finishing college. I got an espresso with a shot of Baileys and he got another delicious IPA. We split a giant kielbasa for $5 with homemade chili. What a deal! The ambiance in here is great.

We were in the midst of Linsanity so the bar was decently occupied with people watching the madness unfold. First thing I noticed was that the bar listed the prices of it's scotches, which is a rare thing to see. Second thing I noticed was the pickled eggs on the shelf. Like most reviewers I passed on the opportunity to try my first one and instead opted for one of the many good beers they had on tap. This is the type of place where the bartender really knows every person who comes through. I had the opportunity to chat with the owner for a little while about his beer selection and I was just happy to see a bar owner who genuinely cared about what beers he serves up.

I've been a bartender for several years and it's always been cheapest stuff on bottom shelf, mid grade in the middle, top shelf on top. I didn't even think to ask. Granted, I did find it strange when I saw Four Roses and Widow Jane on bottom, and did find it strange to see Bulleit mid, but I counted myself lucky. I was shocked when my bill came (over $100 after tip for five drinks plus a cider) and I saw that I was paying mid-shelf pricing for what I felt had been advertised for bottom shelf. Maybe this was a simple misunderstanding, but I felt that a bar that had literally announced itself as ""dive"" was misrepresenting itself, should be familiar with UWS pricing traditions, and was selling itself as more like lower east, not upper west side pricing.",,,

99,Danny P.,"Falls Church, VA",307,525,189,3.0,8/21/2008,"I've come in here to drink my blues away when I'm feeling down, and inevitably it makes me feel better about myself compared to some of the clientèle.The dartboard is good as it gives you a lot of room to play, but the front area (where the tables are) can get crowded very easily.Still, considering there's not a lot of options between 90th st and 105th for cheap bars, this isn't a bad option.Though I do have to say, despite the sometimes scary-looking people standing outside, I left my digital camera there one night and not only did no one take it, they put it behind the bar for me to come pick up the next day. Good on 'em for that.",4,1,1
100,JD S.,"San Francisco, CA",23,7,0,5.0,2/13/2014,"I was thrilled to spend my blizzard night at the broadway dive. It was a cold, wet night on a first date and he brought me to this place.

107,Sebastian P.,"New York, NY",34,71,0,4.0,6/28/2013,"THIS is a dive bar with a beer selection. Can't believe it's this small and has this much to choose from. Very good bartenders too and it's nice to have a bar that doesn't charge you a meal to get a decent snack. They even have vegetarian options too. Also, this is the place where I got hooked on pickled eggs. Can't forget that experience. Everytime I come here, I order a pickled egg or two. A bit loud sometimes and might feel crowded, but it's a good place to get buzzed for cheap or hang out for a couple of hours and feel like a local.",,,
108,Carl G.,"Bronx, NY",32,216,30,4.0,6/13/2013,"Had an event to attend nearby, and so ended up killing some time in the mid-afternoon with three or four friends in the Broadway Dive Bar. Very very impressed. True dive bar experience with killer ambiance, reasonable drink prices, and an extremely friendly bartender. Shots and beer. Beer and shots. Bag of chips. What more could anyone want? Everyone in our little group came this close (holds fingers only slightly apart) to ignoring our event and making an evening of it.",,,
109,Walter F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,54,5,3.0,12/15/2014,"The plus: It's a small neighborhood bar with a eclectic selection of craft beers and micro brews. The staff is generally friendly and the drinks are priced well.  The minus: You never really know what you are going to get when you go in here in terms of the crowd. Some days it's an older and more mature (read: Old Man) bar. Other times, it is VERY young, like, undergraduates from Columbia University stupid young. And it's not predictable in any way. The decor is cramped and old feeling. While the selection of beers is excellent, they are scattered around in several old soda coolers that do not have any logical set up, and seems like it was done on the fly and as an afterthought. The bar stools are some of the hardest on one's posterior I have ever encountered. But it's not the Ritz Carleton so you kind of expect that. All in all, though, the pluses outweigh the negatives and I've never been disappointed in the place. Recommend.",,,
110,Walter F.,"New York, NY",0,18,0,2.0,4/14/2013,"This is a dive bar (in name and in actuality) in a neighborhood that actually could use more of them. Sometimes all you want is a beer or a shot of whiskey. In that regard, Dive Bar does the job. Don't expect any more than that though. It's not the kind of place that you want to spend any length of time at the bar. Some of the clientele is very young; others are the hard drinking crowd that are almost exclusively local in nature. I would give it a higher rating except that the bar staff tend to serve some to excess; the last time in there a few months ago one particular patron (the brother of the barmaid) decided to become overly aggressive to a customer and ended up clearing the place out. I'm not going to go as far as to say I'd never go back, but I think there are far better alternatives out there.",,,
111,jennifer c.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,29,0,5.0,10/30/2009,"I don't care if this place is a dive bar, if having the word ""dive"" in its name makes it less of a dive bar, or if this place is really a pseudo sports bar in disguise.I loved going here when I was staying close by in New York. My friend and I would walk here whenever our night was winding down and have a few drinks. I mostly had beer while she had mixed drinks that were quite stiff. We had different bartenders on different nights, but they were all so very nice and attentive. One of them even gave me a free beer despite the fact that I was not even a regular. (Or at least not before that week.)However, there are lots of regulars who hang out here, and there is no pretentiousness whatsoever. It was surprising that people actually came up to us and talked to us because, unless someone is looking to get someone's number, stuff like this does NOT happen in L.A. And I am not talking about babbling, nonsensical drunk talk-- I am talking politically charged, intelligent conversation here! A different world from L.A., I'm telling you.Also: kudos to whoever put Shuggie Otis in the jukebox, and more kudos for the swinging doors in the front. I also love the fact that this place has a huge open window in front that looks out on to the sidewalk. Only in New York? Probably.This place will forever be in my heart, even if it takes me years to make it back.",1,,1
112,Leigh S.,"New York, NY",0,18,0,5.0,3/18/2011,"Small, dark, free food --- what is not to like? I love all the ""Dive Bar"" trio, but this one is the diviest by far. Despite the insistence that it wouldn't be called that if it were actually one, it is one - it's a dive.

113,Neil R.,"Austin, TX",98,37,2,4.0,7/18/2011,"The place IS a dive bar. It's not a place you want to take your friends to show off NYC, it is however a great place to drink cheaply. They had karaoke going on and everyone seemed to be having a pretty good time. There were a lot of foreigners in there from the hostel across the street and I enjoyed meeting people from different countries the few hours I spent there. The beers (which were quality) were $4-6 and I got a heavy pour on my makers on the rocks for $9 which if you are unfamiliar with NYC, are good deals. The place was really busy and crowded, so it was a little uncomfortable but it is a DIVE BAR...so you should be expecting that. Overall, good prices, good service, good people; nothing awesome though...4 stars.",2,1,2
114,Brutus A.,"NY, NY",34,20,0,4.0,1/18/2007,"A night on the town with you was no mere ego bruising; It was battery.  We went to Dive Bar to sip hot toddy's and play our favorite Thursday night drinking game, Six Degrees of Parker Posey.  As usual, I ended up doing double shots of humiliation.You got me with Richard Pryor :(  Never one to perform an act of grace, you gloated in my face and began gyrating to a one hit wonder that blared from the jukebox across the bar.  You shared high fives with those sweaty fraternity types, while I sulked in my stool.  You ordered another drink, and I intercepted the request, telling the bartender:""No more Rob Roy's for her.  This broad isn't drinking anything stronger than coffee.""  I should have known you wouldn't let that slide.""ROB ROY!""  You yelled. ""Eric Stoltz was in Rob Roy and also Sleep with Me...with PARKER POSEY!""  It added insult to permanent injury.",5,15,7

Neither of us live on the UWS, but I found it because it was the only place that popped up when I googled ""where to find a Westbrook White Thai in NYC."" Westbrook is a brewing company in my home state of South Carolina, and I was delighted to find a hidden gem of a bar that has it! They have a great selection of IPAs and other craft beers, and the bartender was so nice. She let us sample different beers we hadn't had before, and gave great recommendations. Very reasonably priced too, and you can take craft bottles and cans to go! We will definitely make the trek to the UWS to go back often!",,,

You don't feel like you need to take a shower after going here. The beer selection is good enough (the house Dive Bar Ale is pretty decent) and the bartenders are friendly. I wouldn't spend a whole night here but going late to unwind before heading home worked out well. They also have some board games you can play with your friends (Taboo anyone?). Not as good as Dive Bar on 96th or Amsterdam 106th, but  not too bad either.",,,
120,Henry B.,"New York, NY",2,7,0,5.0,11/5/2009,"This is my neighborhood local and as such I am biased.  The bartenders are all great in their own unique ways and the place is ruthlessly Darwinian when it comes to staff - if a newbie doesn't cut it with the staff or the regulars they don't last long.About the ""dive bar"" debate: I once walked in on a guy doing a line of whatever off of the bathroom toilet top.  he then ran out of the bar, lit a cigarette and then puked all over the front of the building.  He still comes in every now and again asking if he's welcome back.  Whatever - the ""dive"" portion of the name refers to some diving equipment the owner used to theme his first bar.  I think a racially, ethnically and generationally mixed crowd of hard core drinking regulars with the very occasional threat of bodily harm qualifies under the broad requirements of a dive bar.And they have free hot dogs and a mini Pac-man machine.",,3,
