1,Vyas L.,"Eden Prairie, MN",0,3,0,3.0,9/10/2018,Alone tourist not recommended unless you are going to purchase your pictures clicked by museum folks or you just want to look at the statues. The 4D picture was ok may be meant more for kids.It would be fun if you go in group clicking pictures.,,,
2,Annabelle L.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",498,552,887,4.0,8/29/2018,"I got a groupon for four and we had a fun time visiting the wax museum.  From music entertainer Jennifer Lopez, Justin Timberlake, Calvin Harris, Carrie Underwood to actors Brad Pitt and his ex wife, Angelina Jolie to past US Presidents and international leaders to comic strip characters, you do not want to miss this place.Our groupon deal also came with admission to the marvel 4D movie, which was short film but cute.  My kids had fun here.We were constantly taking selfies throughout the facility.  There are certain areas where you can pose for their camera and they provide you the ticket numbers so that you can purchase the photos later.  The exhibit are on a few floors and there's only two elevators that take customers back down to the exit door.",9,,7

The sign did state they change things out every few months.  So what I saw now, may not be what you will see in 6 months.  When in NYC we will be back and hopefully get another picture with the queen!",2,,2
4,Tanya C.,"Philadelphia, PA",58,72,13,5.0,11/15/2018,We spent the day in NY for my sons 13th birthday. Our first stop was the museum. It was 3 Adults and 5 children ages 3-13 yo. We had an amazing experience. It took us 3 hours to view the exhibits in clouding the 4D Marvel movie. It was clean not overly crowded. I highly recommend going here.,,,
5,Brenda R.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,100,175,5.0,5/19/2018,"Awesome experience! Today we came to Madame Tussauds for the royal wedding watch party and we got so much more! The setup was absolutely beautiful, as if we were attending an actual wedding reception. The wax figures of Prince Harry and American Princess Meghan were so lifelike. From the food & drinks to the décor they pulled out all the stops! We dined on scones, lox, unlimited mimosas as we watched the ceremony on a huge screen. There was even a chef making omelettes to order, amazing!  The watch party ended we toured the attractions, took pictures like tourist with our favorite wax celebrities. When you visit Tussauds, I recommend you try all the extra attractions like the ghost busters virtual reality and marvel 4-D.  I had a blast!Thank you to all the staff at Madame Tussauds for giving us a day to remember!",8,2,8
6,Redner S.,"Jacksonville, FL",969,52,314,5.0,7/24/2018,"FUN, UNIQUE and WICKED COOL! These are three ways to describe this spot. We were walking through Times Square with family and friends when we got offered a great deal to visit this museum. We got tickets for $20 each which definitely seemed like a bargain. It was definitely worth the experience! These celebrity wax figures were stunning in person. They were super life-like that it was almost creepy, but major props to these wax artists as these figures were such a sight to behold in person. The museum offers opportunities to take photos with celebrities such as Calvin Harris, Jennifer Lopez and even athletes and superheroes. Our family and friends had a great time during this experience. It truly is an immersive experience with over 4 floors of wax figures and even a fun superhero 4D movie experience. You will not regret visiting this fun and unique museum in the heart of Times Square!",4,,4

9,Edelyn M.,"Wesley Chapel, FL",6,123,213,5.0,7/24/2018,I had a lot of fun here and I was by myself so I can only imagine going in an group. They had enough attractions sufficient enough to get your moneys worth but to not overwhelm you either. The wax models were very realistic and I loved how they incorporated important facts and famous quotes on every celebrity or historical figure . The fact that they update and add new things to the museum every 3-4 months is a plus too. I also love the location because its in the center of the city where their is so much to do! Very memorable place .,,,1
10,Mita P.,"North Charleston, SC",54,93,181,2.0,9/20/2018,This was my first time at this location. I was not impressed with it the ticket office people were not helpful at all. We had a coupon with 30% off had they said sorry we not take this. So then we got in just paid regular price. We started the tour and some of the wax statue there was a more then few of them where damaged. There was not a lot of the statue cause they were sending them back and forth from there other places. Over all it was good.,1,,

12,Takeshi Y.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",1185,226,5649,5.0,4/30/2018,"1. OVERVIEW: MADAME TUSSAUDS WAX MUSEUM at the Theater District (right by the Times Square) is one of the world famous wax figure museums chains. It is enormously big like a palace with tons of amazingly crafted wax figures and special effects. It is conveniently located in the extremely busy and high foot traffic area with number of major subway stations nearby.  2. QUALITY: The extremely high and consistent quality of each artworks and sensitively for reflecting the ""heroes and heroins"" of the time in their display makes this museum truly a living and breathing unique world class. I bet this museum will not only survive but also prosper, even after the invention of the ""holodeck"" (as featured in the Star Trek: The Next Generation), in the future. Making this level of super high quality wax figure in the life size human figure requires extremely long preparation & production time, resources (including the several truly look-like people for taking a direct casts/molds for replicating the three dimensional body parts in the colored hard wax-- face, neck, shoulders, and the rest of the body to be assembled at the end, after many subtle modifications), and a truly huge budget for them. Creating a wax figure human is truly a unique and distinctive skill and art form today, and the production artists (and models) can demand an extremely high compensations, naturally. In the past, I repaired many such amazing wax human figures as a special effect artist. I am also saying this as a gaff artist and rogue taxidermy artist, who created a series of freak human babies (two-headed baby, three-headed baby, octopus baby with 7 limbs, mermaid baby, etc.) for the Astroland Amusement Park's Dime Museum called ""Freak Baby Museum"", 6-eyed 8-feet big fish-tailed mythic goat monster called Capricorn, winged 5-headed fox-goat called Odyssey Monster, 32-feet long giant sea serpent, 7-feet big 8-legged spider dog, etc. for clients and TV shows.   3. ATTRACTIONS (INSIDE): Many people love taking pictures with celebrity people. If you can NOT do so with the real celebrity people in the real life, then, visiting this wax museum would be your second best. LOL I would NOT argue with your paying $35 for the ticket.  4. ATTRACTION (OUTSIDE): Another attraction, which this museum offers regularly for us all is a FREE ""sample display"" right by the entrance on the street. Here, you can have a small taste of what is expected to be seen inside of this magnificent palace of celebrity wax figures. You can also take pictures with these on the street as well. (see my attached photo below.) Also, the Madam Tussauds gives out the discount coupons by using the ladies in very eye-catching costumes on the streets near by. (see my attached photos below) These festively costumed ladies also show the attentions to the details and quality of what they do behind the door of this wonderful museum. They know what they doing, and I love what they do. 5. ADDITIONAL FEE: This is an interesting business practice here at the Madame Tussauds but an extra ticket is needed to be purchased to enjoy some of the side/extra features. I thought you might wanted to know this.  6. WARNING #1: Sadly, some people cuts in a line for taking photos with the popular wax figure, and they start nasty oral fighting and even light physical fighting here. The well-trained security guards closely monitoring those several ""super popular wax figures"" (Barack & Michelle Obama, Ghost Busters, etc.) usually step in quickly and deal with the situation. I really hated seeing this mess. Please respect others and behave in the civilized manners, so that you would NOT become the part of the problems here. Also, if you face any problems, please immediately consult the security guard instead of taking the matters into your own hands. 7. WARNING #2:This wax museum is a very popular attraction in the Times Square area. Your waiting line may be very long (not only inside but outside as well) sometimes. So, you might want to schedule the off-peak hours, if you can for your better experience. Also, please be very alert for your wallet and belongings. This area is truly infested by dozens of professional wage-earning full time pickpockets, who work as a team of three or more thugs. Just as a relay race, the original pickpocket would passes your stolen wallet to his second thug, and he does the same to the third thug. Police officers will NOT help you get back your stolen wallet, even if you catch one of them. I am telling you this based on my personal experience as a crime victim in the area.      If you are really into taking pictures with tons of celebrity wax figures (real people and even imaginary ones like Incredible Hulk and ET) gathered in one location, this is surely one place you want to visit. For those, I highly recommend the Madame Tussauds wax museum here in New York City. Dr. Takeshi Yamada and Seara (Coney Island sea rabbit)photos attached",29,26,26
13,Christine T.,"WHITESTONE, NY",4,19,7,5.0,10/29/2018,"I don't even know where to begin with this review except for the fact that everyone there are amazing. My son was disappointed with the 4D movie, as where we were sitting we didn't experience the full effects. My son spoke up and Thomas accommodated him by allowing us to sit through another movie. Prior to Thomas allowing any other customer's into the movie theater, he allowed my son and my family to pick out their preferred seats before anyone else can. My family had a great time with the different wax statues especially loved the avengers. My son lost his hat and let me tell you how wonderful the staff and security are/were. They were amazing and even had to deal with my husband in searching. There's no enough words to describe our gratitude and wonderful/amazing experience we had here at Madame Tussauds.  Whenever you're in New York and even a New Yorker having fun in the city, this is a must do on your list.",,,

The added features were a short 4d film and virtual reality game. Virtual reality game was very fun. I did feel that the price for the experience was a little high ($59.99). It was nice to do once.",,,
15,Woody R.,"West Monroe, LA",0,3,16,4.0,11/1/2018,Super pricey for a couple wax figures.  Really realistic people.  5 floors of wax people.  Very impressive place. Ripley's right next door is a good place too.  Very interesting reading and work.,,,
16,Bryan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,141,101,4.0,6/4/2018,My kids really enjoyed coming here and since we are local it gives us new places to visit every weekend. I decided to try Madame Tussaud's since I had seen at other cities but never gave it a shot. Once we entered I continued to be entertained and every section got better and better. I was most impressed with the ghostbusters display and it definitely was my kids favorite part. I am going to wait until my family comes to visit and take them here for some entertainment. The pictures make for great souvenirs.,,,
17,Teisha V.,"Wichita Falls, TX",11,157,477,4.0,9/5/2018,"This place was expensive if you do the Gold package which we did. It was $160 for 2 adults and 1 kid. That was the only down fall, I am excited we came here. It was kid friendly and definitely an adventure. I bought the package where you can fight like a ghostbusters (because my son is soo retro) and the entire family LOVED it!!!! Mom definitely received Gold stars for this one. The ghostbusters section is what I wanted to see most for my son since it's not something we can do or find anywhere. We battled monsters, took pictures with King Kong, hung out with some awesome Adventures. We were a bunch of kids in a candy store. I am glad we came for sure, they have lots to see.",,,

Updated review","Madame Tussaud wax museum is a must when visiting New York ( several locations in the US and abroad).  The wax figures are just amazing!  Details on those wax figures are unbelievable.  The artists got it right on.  A lot of your favorite celebrities, world figures and  past Presidents are there.  My son and I had so much fun taking pics and admiring the  great work ..  Even my son looks like a wax figure !",,,

23,Harjina S.,"San Jose, CA",101,52,202,4.0,3/30/2018,"I've heard great things about this wax museum and when I traveled to NYC, I finally got to experience it! Upon entering there was a DJ that was blasting music to get everyone pumping and boy was I ready! The wait time is significantly shorter when you have a New York Pass, but other than that they had two wax statues up front and a hanging one of Pink when you stroll up the stairs! It's conveniently sectioned off into old jazz artists, current celebrity favorites, Chinese stars, a Ghostbusters section (a personal favorite), and the list goes on! You do have to purchase extra tickets for some of the side features but I figured since I was there to see the wax statues, that wasn't of importance to me. One thing that I wish this place had were assistants or guards that monitored the lines for the more popular wax statues. In this case, the one featuring Barack and Michelle Obama. After waiting in line and excitedly rushing to take my photo so that the rest of the people waiting could have their turn, this family decided to rush in ahead of me for a shot. Luckily my significant other told them about the line and while I was taking photos for him, they began to complain and sighed so obnoxiously that I couldn't stand it anymore. I ended up continuing on in the tour and had to go back just to avoid that whole crowd. After being cheered up, I was able to  continue through the tour but I wonder how man other experiences have been ruined because of that same issue? Any who, when we approached the sports section there was a virtual soccer game that you could play by kicking a soccer ball into the screen but it appeared to be malfunctioning by the time I got there. There was nobody to monitor the display so families were kicking the soccer ball around like crazy. Despite the disorganization of a few things, their gift shop was pretty cool! They also had a penny souvenir machine to fit your elongated coin needs! Overall, the trip was a lot of fun and I definitely recommend it to anyone who's visiting New York with their friends or loved ones! Just don't be afraid to nag some people about getting into line haha!",,,

We arrived around 8:50 and got into the will call line. Unfortunately, no one started working the desks until 9:10.

She was amazing and took the time to do everything we wanted. While doing the wax figurines my toddler daughter had to use the restroom so my husband left to take her. During their excursion he accidentally exited out the wrong door and was locked in a no access area. Jayvon and Tiffany went out their way to help him. They made a very stressful situation less stressful. They escorted both my daughter and husband back upstairs and we continued our journey. Hands down they were some of the nicest people we met while in the state. SN: I skipped the floor where I needed to complete the review. I returned the next day and tried to do it but the employees that day said they could not escort me upstairs, which was understandable. They advised me to do it online.

I went in the summer time and it was some changes done when I went again on Thanksgiving day! Since it is a huge tourist attraction they are usually open on most holidays which is nice if you don't have conventional traditions. Lots of fun facts on the walls to learn about how they make their wax figures and everything that goes into it! Favorite exhibit they have now is definitely the fashion part!

Some of them looked so life-like and true to form!The basic ticket is $35, which could be a pricey proposition for a family, and includes the entire wax museum and the 4D movie.  You can purchase tickets on-line in advance and save about $5.

Entrance fee seems a bit steep at $30 about but you can get 20% off if you check in on Yelp or outside, they're always handing out coupons.The alcohol inside is so cheap (for Times Square). A bottle of beer was only $5 each! Delicious cocktails are also about $10 each. We decided to liquor ourselves up and just have fun taking pictures with all the wax figures! They had some of my favorite celebrities from Tom Hiddleston (fangirl squealing), Chris Hemsworth (more fangirl squealing), Eli Manning, Ernest Hemingway (the one man's name I have tattooed on my body is Hemingway), and Michael Strahan. Super upset that Chris Evans Captain America was off the floor for maintenance. However, all the others definitely made up for it. Some of the wax figures are exact replicas (since I have stalked - I mean met some of these other celebs in real life)! It's creepy how good they are. Some were a bit lacking - guess it depends on the artist.It ended up being SO much fun! We were giggling and just enjoying ourselves. The Marvel 4D experience was cheesy but whatever, we laughed throughout that too. The staff were all super friendly also. The professional photo packages start at $35 (meh) so we opted not to get that especially since we got so many other great photos (I think I got at least 50 with Tom Hiddleston).Definitely a lot more fun than you really think it'll be especially if you get a bunch of those $5 beers in you!",7,5,6

I enjoyed seeing the Presidential wing and definitely the Ghostbusters section.

Once you get through, walk up a flight of steps, take a pic with King Kong and head to the elevator that takes you to the top floor. You start at the 9th floor and work your way down. There are elevators but they seem to be a hassle. If you can walk this is your easiest option. If you have a stroller try not to bring it. The wax figures are spread out and you can touch them and take pictures with them. Some look super realistic and others you'll be trying to figure out who you're looking at. The heat in this place was out of control. I honestly don't know how the statues didn't melt. I'm thinking they keep it crazy hot in here so you can stop at one of their spots to buy drinks located on every floor. There is no coat check in here so try to carry as little as possible. Overall a fun, touristy night in the city with the kids but I wouldn't return. I definitely wouldn't recommend visiting if you're in NY for a short time, there are way better things to do and see. Price is too high without a significant discount.",5,1,3

Worth the stop, walked over from the Rockefeller center (less than 15 min walk). Took about 2 hours to go through the entire thing.

I was actually in awe seeing these incredible wax interpretation figures of these celebrities and movie/music icons! Along with past and our present-day President! Attention to detail was second to none and the special-effects added to this wonderful experience but also the great staff that work here was a pleasant surprise, place was super clean also, wrapping up our experience was the marvel superhero 4D experience which was a short film in a movie theater with super interactive effects u see AND feel! I don't want to give it away but it was super enjoyable!all and all I highly recommend this place for sll to enjoy, my only advice would be to use a coupon and try to go during off-peak hours to avoid the line build up,it's just awesome for all ages!",2,1,1
43,Dave F.,"West Orange, NJ",4,21,276,5.0,11/19/2017,"I went here in August for a date and I have to say this place was truly awesome and worth the money. We came here on a Saturday night and to our surprise it was not that packed so we roam around rampage, taking pictures with all of the celebrities and playing with the props. It was impressive the attentive to details on these wax statues, some of them were so life like which was truly a work of art. I recommend anyone that stop by to get a wax hand made to really capture the total experience.  The molds come in various colors that you can customize and even mix and match and blend different colors and designs. The best part of Madame Tussauds was the Ghost Busters Dimension Hyper Reality Experience and yes it is worth it and unlike everything anything I have experienced. You're fully immerse in this virtual reality simulation as they attached the VR Helmet and body gear so you feel every movement.  It really feels as you're inside of a video game so if you have a chance, stop by here and buy the total package and you will not be disappointed.",,,

We had a blast blowing up ghosts and it truly appeals to the senses. Upon defeating the Staypuff Marshmallow Man we smelled toasted marshmallow! And the 4D film was great! Motion of the seats, air moving in all directions, being sprayed with water and bubbles! This is definitely on our to do list when we visit again!",1,,

Or is it always like this? I only remember that we went at night time. It was awesome!Since absolutely no one was around, we had the entire place to ourselves and could take crowd-less pictures in whatever silly pose we wanted to haha. The wax figures themselves were very impressive (some more than others). I took a ""selfie"" type photo with Carrie Underwood and my friends back home thought I really met her.

Fiancé and I loved it. There were so many wax figures, along with photo opportunities. Just those photos you get to capture are worth a thousand words! Can you believe every wax figure costs about $220,000 to make? That's just insane! If you're in the area, definitely plan a visit.",1,,1

I asked if there was a student discount and was told ""yes."" I asked how much and was told ""$3."" I wanted to clarify if that's how much a ticket was, and he said ""Can you do math? I said 3. 34 minus 3 is 31."" Good to know a security guard can do math but not welcome guests with a smile to begin a pleasant experience at the museum....Went to pay and asked the cashier for a student discounted ticket and was told they no longer offer that. I referred him to the security guard and they spent 15 minutes going back and forth with the security guard and called someone in management about it. We were eventually honored the student discount. There's thousands of better things to do in NYC. Skip this museum!!",,,

50,Matthew G.,"Columbus, OH",16,167,36,5.0,7/26/2017,"The tickets for this place seem steep, but it's New York, and a bargain compared to other entertainment options.That said, I'm not sure this place is worth visiting multiple times. The figures were amazing, I often had a sensation like they were real people holding very still. But now that I've done it, I don't think it would be as good an experience the second time.Many figures in this exhibit were very notable, but there were a handful that I had no idea who they were: some YouTube celebrity, some pop musicians, and foreign film stars (Bollywood). The Bollywood portion particularly freaked me out, because a) I have no idea who these figures are, b) Indian tourists do, and c) some Indian tourists were standing around, making it difficult for my racist ignorant self to know what was wax and who was real.Finally: the presidents. Except for Nixon, I didn't find the president statues as realistic as all the others. They looked like body doubles that are close, but not quite the same. Obama, Bush, Reagan, Kennedy, Trump, they all seemed off. Maybe this is for national security reasons or something?The gift/candy shop in this place is a great place to get souvenirs.",1,2,
51,Kiersten M.,"Buffalo, NY",8,105,59,2.0,3/11/2018,It was creepy for me and I didn't like it. It just reminded me of life sized dolls a little bit. It was kind of expensive for standard ticket. It a nice place to go if you have time to kill. There was a lot of stuff to look at. I suggest coming in on week days or sundays.  There is less people and it's less crowded.,,,

(No. 1 being London, and No. 3 being SF) There are a ton of wax statues here, from historical figures, to celebrities, to fictional characters. It's a pretty trippy experience. Still, it's pretty awesome. It's not the largest place to visit, and you'll be done in no time flat, but it's still a worthwhile experience. There is a lot to do in NY, and I would put this as an experience to be had.",3,2,2
54,Christine V.,"Cambridge, MA",142,192,326,2.0,1/4/2018,"Came here to check out the wax figures. The tickets are quite expensive over $35/ticket. There was only two cashiers available which was painful, we were in line near the door (freezing outside by the way) for approx 40 minutes. I wasn't impressed by the wax figures there and the tour was relatively fast to go through. I was able to buy a drink inside which made the tour more tolerable. Even there there are 3 stories of wax figures there are some rooms with only a few figure and always and stair ma which account for a lot of that space. I enjoyed taking pictures with the windows that overlook Times Square but I wouldn't recommend or go again unless I was stranded with nothing else to do, just ate, and needed somewhere to be inside during the cold weather.",2,,

The display is incredible although I think they could have done a better job on Williams face. We even had the chance to try The Royal Tea experience where you get to have tea and cookies in a roped off area across from the Royal Family. It was so fun and you feel very special in your own area. So much to see and do, definitely allow for a couple hours to see everything.

I didn't understand how a wax figure can be such an accurate rendering of a person. The figures looked so perfect, I really felt like I was hugging Brad Pitt. As you take the tour down through the museum, the figures are sorted by theme and era. The apparel they are wearing is all very high quality and the ambience they added to each of the figures location really set the mood. Your entire visit is probably a good 45 minutes to an hour that's worth every penny. It's worth seeing this spot because it's part of what makes NYC so wonderfully entertaining. The tickets aren't cheap but it's one of things you just gotta do.",1,1,1
58,Sunday P.,"Howard Beach, NY",299,372,3404,5.0,11/18/2017,"I love this place I've been going to Madame Tussaud's wax museum's since the 80s and I've been to all of them including London.The company has become much more lax in letting you touch the wax figures. It's costs roughly about $20,000 a piece to make so I'm actually quite surprised they allow this new practice (About The last 8 years) I think that this new policy has generated more business allowing you to touch the figures and take photos with them like you were with the actual person. I take it as a New Gimmick that Madame Tussauds was basically pushed into because people Constantly touch them and I assume they got the attitude if you can't beat them Join them.I personally look at these figures as art and do not approve of anyone putting their hands on them or showing any kind of disrespect.I love the education behind how every figure is made and if the celebrity was a model or they copied it from a photo and stats. Definitely if they modeled they look identical down to every hair on them of the real person.The lines are incredibly long but to me it's worth the trip especially if you have never been to such an amazing wax museum that has been around for well over 100 years.They are always changing it around and each wax museum will always show the celebrities with famous people of that country like in London they always are changing the royal family or you can see Jack the Ripper and in America we've got several presidents and loads of American singers & celebs some local to the state.They have a pretty big gift shop as well and they have photographers that take your picture with an unusual wax background. They also try to trick you into making you think there's a real person sleeping on a bench or in a chair or dressed up as security guard throughout the museum, it's actually pretty funny and many people are fooled.If you are ever visiting New York, London Vegas or any of the other locations you must must go to Madame Tussaud's!",4,3,3

60,Laura L.,"Mamaroneck, NY",126,90,30,4.0,1/21/2017,"I've been passing by this place for years and finally stopped by with the boyfriend. It's one of those NYC tourist things to do but we did enjoy our time here. We came on Friday night and it was quiet. I can see it being crazy during a busier time. It's about 5 (?) floors of wax figures. They're all arranged and spaced out in a way where you can take pictures with them. Each area has a certain theme and they said the figures change every so often to keep it fresh. A highlight was the Ghostbusters experience. Wasn't really expecting much, but it's a virtual reality 15 minute experience which was pretty cool and immersive. We both enjoyed it. I didn't find any deals online for tickets, but definitely check beforehand. I would recommend this as a rainy day activity. The wax figures are kinda creepy but it's a fun experience to try out once.",,,

I spent about 25 minutes with the Robert Pattinson wax figure. They have so many cool things to see. I only been to the one in Los Angeles. We were searching for Elvis, but found out he is in the Las Vegas location. I have a house in vegas- will take mom there next time. I already took her to Graceland what more does she want. Anyway. They had 9/11 firefighters, woody Allen, my son was holding his nose at Kim Kardashian. My mom was giving Hillary Clinton the finger. I wanted to take that Robert Pattinson so bad! Don't put it past me! I love him. We took lots of funny pictures and every step was coolThe Spice Girls are here. The Susan Sarandon is scary- looks just like her.

67,Kari C.,"Rochester, NY",240,677,2130,4.0,6/4/2016,"Call me a crazy gimmicky tourist if you want, but I love Madame Tussauds. I've only been to this one (now twice) and the Vegas location; however, they are both so exciting and add so much fun to any trip. Ordinarily I wouldn't typically care about life-size wax dolls, but after visiting, Madame Tussauds never fails to bring along a good time. Ironically, adults seem to be the primary patrons of this business. That could, in part, be due to the price point. Madame Tussauds New York is not cheap. Discounts can be found on the website in advance and also on coupons in tour guide books.I loved the staff here. We purchased our tickets from a lovely young lady named Tyneisha (I think that was her name) at the front desk. She was so friendly and personably when we had inquiries about pricing. She is the best, so be sure to ask for her if you're going here. She was able to tell us where to find a coupon online to decrease our admissions tickets. Her small gesture kicked off one of the best nights of our trip. When you're at Madame Tussaud's, the key to having fun is just becoming a kid again and bringing along your cancer so that you can laugh later. Throughout the attraction, they offer photos of guests for purchase. They also have a small 3D theatre.  Overall,  awesome place to visit! I'm knocking off one star for the horrible hours. They close super early, so be sure to check the closing times and plan appropriately.",8,4,5

Everything is quite spread out so no overlapping pictures and sculptures, which is a huge plus. Must say the avengers section was definitely the most enjoyable at least on my end. They also have a 4D mini short film which is definitely cute and worth checking out.Weekdays and days where it's not scorching outside is probably ideal to go.

The superhero movie in my opinion wasn't worth it. I didn't have a 4D experience and it only lasts for 10 minutes. However the figure themselves were really cool. One of the security guards was sitting on a bench pretending to be a wax figure and scaring people which was definitely on of the highlights.

71,Cecilia T.,"Long Island, NY",595,335,1733,4.0,2/15/2017,"My husband decided to have a double date day to celebrate my birthday with another close couple. One of the main events was this wax museum and it exceeded all our expectations. We parked our car in Chinatown and took the subway to Times Square to avoid the parking nightmare. One good tip is to purchase tickets when you get there while checking in with the yelp app to save 20% off the super hero package. We paid 64.46 for 2 people, which was very cheap in my opinion. It includes everything except the Ghostbusters dimension hyper-reality experience but I didn't want to wear the costume nor put goggles over my eyes so I decided to pass. The museum had 5 floors of celebrity wax figures, the Ghostbusters experience, a Marvel 4D (6 minutes) film & experience and a free wax hand sculpture (your own hand). Additional $8 if you opt for the double wax hand and $2 for a design. Definitely a great keepsake for any age. There was excellent customer service from all the employees in this museum from beginning to end. The only negative part was the time it takes to complete the wax hand experience. I recommend doing this activity first when you arrive. It takes 20 to 30 minutes per 2 hands with only 2 to 3 people working when we got there. We had to wait about 90 minutes/ 10th in line but we got the best service from this associate who worked in the Ghostbusters experience department (scaring people with a grudge-like appearance, long hair covering his entire face). He was very accommodating, funny and personable and really exemplifies the best customer service we have ever experienced. Although this wasn't my first time here, I still had a good time and my friends did too (their first time).

87,Jess S.,"Boston, MA",0,39,33,5.0,11/8/2017,"This was a fun place to visit in Times Square. A little pricey, but there are many floors to explore. The statues look so real! At the end of the tour, you can pay to make a wax figure out of your hand.",,,
88,Gary M.,"Columbia, MO",7,72,1107,5.0,3/13/2017,"All of the statues look just like the stars on TV. We parked in New Jersey at the Port Imperial port and took the ferry to pier 79 then took the free bus to 42nd street or as its called Times Square. We found it very  easy to get around, we took the elevator up to the top floor and walked through the museum to the ground floor. We took more video equipment they we needed, it was nice for a couple hours tour and then went on to see other site in NYC.",,,
89,Christa M.,"Mesa, AZ",83,642,1470,4.0,6/22/2016,"This was a pretty neat experience and I am so glad I got to visit on my trip to NY! We arrived at 4pm and unfortunately, we only had two hours to be able to complete this whole experience. (our bus leaving at 6:30) We stood in a never moving line for about 30 minutes, and I mean it by the line not moving at all, not even an inch. It was now 4:40, we were still in line, and we no longer were going to have enough time to walk this whole thing, so we had to leave. As we were walking out the front, the gentlemen at the front door pulled me back inside and asked me why we were leaving. I told him my situation and he gave me a smile and said, ""oh don't worry I got you!"" He took us to the next available kiosk to get us our tickets and plus 50% off!! Heck yeahh! Thank youuu!*I'm not sure what was up with the kiosk lady who I bought my tickets from, but she was very rude. I asked her about the wax hands your able to make and she replied back cranky with, ""Information upstairs"" and then continued talking to her coworker, while never looking at me.We definitely did have fun running around taking pics, and on this particular day, it wasn't crowded or busy! We got a lot good pictures and a couple cute souvenirs! Definitely worth visiting!*The wax figures look so real!!!! A little creepy lol*You must watch the 4D superhero film!",,,
90,Jessica G.,"Denville, NJ",0,8,0,5.0,8/19/2018,"Really fun place! I brought 2 kids 7 and 8, they loved it. We also did the Marvel experience which I thought was a pretty good 10 minute 4D show, my daughter did not like it she said it was too short. Bathrooms were very clean. Very entertaining and they even served beer wine and spirits. I would highly recommend Madame Tussaud's we spent about 2 and a half hours here.",,,
91,Rory M.,"Queens, NY",0,27,0,4.0,7/16/2017,"Got the entire package when I went recently.The wax museum part was neater than I expected but I think I really only cared for the ghostbuster and marvel sections.The marvel 4D movie was alright, animation seemed kinda budget level though. I think smaller kids would love it still.The ghost buster hyper dimension experience (VR) was very cool but very VERY short. It's the main reason why I went, and I was disappointed with how little there was to do in the experience. If I could go back in time I'd probably not spend the money on it but I have to say, the VR headset had a decent image quality (though the game graphics were mediocre at best). All in all it was a nice experience but I paid full price, and you shouldn't if you can avoid it.",2,,
92,Emily L.,"Albuquerque, NM",128,117,36,4.0,8/15/2017,What a cool place! I have never been to a wax museum and have always wanted to check one out.

I got intrigued, went inside, saw the Yelp offer and bam, I bought a ticket. So glad I did. This place was awesome.There is 5 floors of celebrity wax figures and it's pretty awesome!! The good thing about this, aside from being the second largest museum, is that they don't have the same wax figures as they do in Orlando. It completely felt like a different experience all together.The best part about the whole thing was that we got to check out their new 4D Marvel experience. It felt like a Disney ride! It had vibrating chairs (with a little extra surprise), water splashes, lights and all the awesome extras. I really enjoyed my time here and I'm glad I decided to step in. There's snacks inside, there's an area where you can make your own wax hands (same as Orlando), different areas where you get to do fun photo ops and a gifts shop. I think this place is def worth a shot if you ever find yourself for something entertaining but not so chaotic :)",1,1,1
96,Winnie W.,"Manhattan, NY",13,142,860,3.0,12/31/2016,"Madame Tussaud's is a must go place for me, because I am a big fan of Hollywood, hah.. unfortunately, I didn't view the reviews on yelp before I purchased my ticket so as to bought a ticket at full price from the official website. Do yourself a favor and get your tickets from Groupon.First hall I stepped in was displayed some Hollywood stars and two models of victory's secret, one of them sitting on a swing and hanging on the ceiling, I took a photo with Jonny Depp,hah. Then, I met Lady Gaga, Dwayne Johnson and Whitney Houston( the pose is so classic) and some other super star. The path led me to the the sports star part, Yao is so bloody tall, My head is merely on his waist - -...... Go further, there are historical figures, Obama and Michael, Clinton and Hilary and so on. Here is a photo ops that capture the moment when you dealing affairs of country like president on ""president's"" table, you would select your photo and pay bill at the end of tour. Go all way down is the wax figure about America, the Statue of Liberty, Wall Street and so forth, at the same time playing the song of "" Empire State of mind"", as to I feel truly I am in New York now!The feeling is quite amazing to see many celebrities of their real size, (though some of the celebrities are quite different as I expected). Staffs are friendly.",1,1,
97,Neha P.,"Manhattan, NY",45,143,201,3.0,1/2/2016,"I'm not sure why this place is SO popular. The line was a mile long outside the door when we came here on a Friday evening. Thank god we had bought our VIP tickets online, so we skipped the line entirely. I highly recommend buying tickets online (it's cheaper..and faster). It was pretty crowded indoors too. We were taken to the top floor and worked our way down. If it wasn't for the sheer number of people, I think it would've taken us half the time to get through the museum. There were times when we were moving an inch at a time. There were no staff on the top floor to help direct people and make things move faster. I appreciated the art, time, effort behind the creation of the wax figures. It is a very realistic portrayal of the celebrities (for the most part!). For a popular holiday weekend though, I was pretty disappointed by the number of figures that were removed for whatever reason (I'm guessing touch-up of their make-up and hair). Also, the spotlights were often not directed on the figures, but to random parts of the wall ?! - making the lighting not entirely suitable for taking good pictures. If you decide to come here, be sure to watch the 4D Marvel movie - it was pretty fun. Overall, it was an Okay experience. I am never going to be back. If you are stuck in Times Square with some time to kill or you need to escape the cold for a few hours.. then it may be worth going here. The wax figures are impressive, but the museum is quite disorganized.",2,,

Line was long but moved pretty fast even with the two girls at the ticket register. The girl we bought our tickets from gave us a discount, which was very sweet of her (Wish I would've got her name) Thanks girlll xoxoAnyway: The Ghost-busters exhibit was my favorite one by far. It felt very realistic and thats what made it so awesome. I liked how next to each figure they had a little summary which gives you fun facts about each figure. Another good thing is that you literally can TOUCH everything. From their hair, to their lips, to their =x etc So make sure to snap many selfies n cop as many feels as you want haha xDFrom this visit it Looks like things still look the same except for a few new renovations and added on wax figures. Negative: Rihanna honestly looks nothing like herself though & I love her so much that this took away the 5 stars I would've gave. & I think that they should add more celebrity figures. I will be coming back again.",2,1,1
100,Jaclyn N.,"Middletown, CT",460,225,1020,4.0,9/19/2016,"During our weekend vacation in New York, my husband and I decided to take our children to see this tourist attraction. I'll start by saying I was not excited to go. Although the reviews were solid I couldn't see how we would have fun or understand why it is so expensive. My husband pleaded his case and I couldn't say no, it was his birthday after all. The line to get in was really long and it did take a few minutes to get to the counter. They moved the line rather quickly in my opinion. After going up the first flight of stairs and averting the first of many expensive photo ops, we did have to get in line again for the elevator up to the top of the building. Once we got off that elevator we had a very self paced experience. I loved some of the displays and thought that some of the photos I took here were some of the best photos I've ever had. Seeing Robin Williams in life size and extreme detail was such a beautiful feeling. My kids loved taking pictures with Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, ET, and Dorothy! My husband especially enjoyed the sports stars area and taking funny pictures with the athletes he doesn't particularly like lol. Seeing historical figures such as Einstein, Washington, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr was amazing. We really enjoyed our time here and I am so happy that my husband talked me into it! Some down points here are the 2 gift shops, 1 in the middle of the museum, and one at the end. what ever happened to one gift shop? Also, there are expensive photo ops all over and they funnel you in and make you feel like you are required to take the photo, ha, we don't fall for that stuff though. Lastly, the food and drinks here are pretty expensive, we ate before we came and went for food again afterwards so we did fine. Definitely don't go hungry!!",4,4,5

But I did not like it when the people running the wax hand dipping area were screaming and yelling ant my service dog trying to distract him from his tasks to me. All but that it was awesome.

107,John R.,"Warren, NJ",174,1219,345,4.0,8/30/2016,"Came here for the Ghostbusters Hyper Reality Experience. Of course to do that, one starts at the top of the museum and makes their way down through the exhibits to get to the main event. I am not sure how life like some of the figures are but I must say they are kept well considering the fact that they encourage you to take as many photos with them as you wish and really almost all, if not all, are accessible to stand next to or otherwise pose with for those photos you are taking.As for the Ghostbusters experience at least when I was there a good number of glitches were still being worked out. With that said, however, it was an amazing peek into the world of VR and well worth taking in. We had to reset twice -- and surprisingly we did so by going back to the beginning therefore really experiencing a good part of it threes times on one visit and one ticket. The people were great and the waiting to get inside was well worth it. It may be the 'Pong' of the VR to come but run there and check it out.Further down was the 4D Marvel film which was okay at best. Bottom line -- went there for Ghostbusters and everything else was icing on the cake.",3,,1

Its cheaper!Yes the museum was cool to see wax figures look so realistic and accurate but I think it was a bit overpriced for the amount of time I spent in there. It took about an hour to get through everything. Maybe I did not cherish my time there as much because I didn't know who more than half the wax figures were because some were oldies or producers of movies, etc. but ehh. Maybe find a museum thats more interactive. Kids would get bored.",,,

See the wax ""people"" was really cool and made for some awesome photo ops! However, the ""cool factor"" is in the surprise and the newness of the place. This is not a place where you'd want to return again and again. The staff was friendly (for New York City anyway) and the business was clean. Music was too loud and blaring. Also, it's obvious that they're trying to focus on the latest Ghostbusters movie, but they've turned it almost into a spookhouse in several of the rooms - too much!",,,

It's apparently the largest MT location in the US with well over 100+. There are 5 floors of wax figures here and you can easily spend over two hours here snapping away pictures.Only reason I give it three stars is because I feel the Hollywood location is better and has more hands-on interactive wax figures. This NY MT is lacking on props and costumes that you can hold/wear during your pictures with the wax figures. There's a bar inside MT if you want to get your buzz on!",2,1,1

My biggest thrill is discovering that I am actually taller than some celebrities--I talking to you Tom Cruise.  I also get a kick out of posing for a pic next to Jennifer Aniston or the Spice Girls and imaging myself escorting such dream girls on the red carpet. (Hey, I guy can dream).The wax museum has also done a very nice job of bringing many superheroes to life. My favorite is the Hulk; if you stand next to ""The Big Guy"", you get an idea of what the words, ""Hulk Smash,"" really mean.

Nice thing is that the figures were pretty well spread out which helps when all the crowds come through, and especially during the summer.You'll start on the top levels after you pass King Kong on the stairs. First, it's the Hollywood celebrities, and then (in no particular order) sports athletes, politicians including Mr. and Mrs. Obama, and other famous musicians/song artists.I definitely wouldn't pay full price (more like $37 per person normally) but would instead try to get one of the discount passes like The New York Pass, New York Explorer Pass, or others.

134,Sandy L.,"Liberty, TX",0,30,1,1.0,4/25/2018,The museum has a nice display of people. However the room that housed all the presidents was a disappointment. All of the presidents were displayed in a large circle except President Obama. He was housed in a very large area alone.  There was nothing for President Trump. Whether you are Republican or Democrat all should be included and displayed equally.,,,
135,Carrie P.,"Colorado Springs, CO",142,177,647,4.0,1/3/2016,"Came here for the New Years Eve party, it was $119 and included the museum, appetizers and all you could drink alcohol or non-alcoholic drinks. The photo ops were really fun! The staff was friendly, it was easy to get a drink, check our coats and use the restroom throughout the night. The main floor played good music and people were dancing all night. We were able to exit about 15 minutes prior to midnight to see the ball drop, which is an awesome experience! The only bad part was a hungover from the cheap alcohol, not much seating if you didn't buy a VIP table and not enough variety of appetizers, they had a pasta, rice and a couscous option. Overall I'd recommend coming, it was a fun way to ring in the New Year!",2,,

Exactly one person working the ticket line and answering all questions/up selling packages and taking for-absolutely-ever. Had Gray line passes but only his line was for Big Bus passes.

For $5 more you can get a wax cast of your hand dipped in a color dye. Be warned while our wait wasn't too long a sign posted when we got there said it could take up to 45 mins. This is something I would have preferred knowing when we bought the ticket.Several floors of wax figures separated by theme. All excellent.

141,Kassidy O.,"El Cajon, CA",62,1,0,2.0,3/28/2018,"Overall, my experience at Madame Tussaud's was extremely unprofessional. From a customers standpoint, it was apparent that not all of the employees were given all of the same information. When we got there we were put into a line to purchase tickets. The line was moving along swiftly when an employee in charge decided to separate the lines by payment method. Employees directing lines weren't even familiar with the type of payment methods that we were separating into. And because there was 1 employee directing a full house of people, people began going in whatever line they wanted, in whatever line they wanted because everyone was just as frustrated with the organization. I started to think that maybe they were just understaffed and not prepared for the size of crowd that they received, but as I looked around DOZENS of employees were joking around and ignoring their responsibilities. The employee checking the tickets was so in tune with his conversation going on I watched 6 people walk by without even getting their ticket checked. The 2 stars I'm giving this review are for the amazing wax figures. They are very realistic and so fun to take photos with!",,,

If they have good deals on Groupon, be sure to get your tickets on Groupon. Usually they do so you'll be okay. It's so many celebrities, they are missing a few tho :( . I've always gone when it was crowded so there was a wait upstairs to get inside the elevator. You go through all 5 floors pretty quickly, it's like as soon as you turn around.. BAM! You're done The 4D movie was so cool.. WARNING: You get a little wet, If you don't wanna get wet..

It took about 5 minutes to buy our tickets and we were led up the stairs to start off the exhibit. There are about 5 floors of wax figures and each floor with a different theme. You get to see all of your favorite stars! They have wax figures of actors, musicians, athletes, political figures, tv hosts, and even of some famous cartoon characters.You are allowed and encouraged to take as many pictures as you'd like and there is no time limit, so you can stay as long as you'd like. They also have a couple of concessions stand where they serve snacks and drinks. And that day we visited we even got to see a 4D short movie presentation. It took us about an hour and a half to get through everything. Overall, it was a really fun activity and a nice place to relax and stay warm for a couple hours!",,,

151,Robert C.,"Yonkers, NY",252,33,25,4.0,7/5/2016,"This review is based off my experience trying out the newest attraction of the GHOSTBUSTERS HYPER REALITY EXPERIENCE presented by THE VOID at Madame Tussaud's.   ---------------------This is a flawed yet great tease of the glimpse into future gaming and VR entertainment.  It was definitely worth the money to feel immersive VR, something that can't be duplicated with current VR being pushed into homes at an affordable budget, because well, it would be impossible.  From my understanding, these kinds of experiences are being worked on or exist in other states, but if you live in New York City, this is definitely a must see.  So put down your Samsung VR headsets.  This is the beginning of the real deal, at least in an arcade sense (powered by a modified Oculus Rift).  Read on if you want some more details.    The WaitPrepare for a long wait unless you show up early.  I waited about 2 hours. With time to kill you can always drift off to take a dump or eat tourist priced food.  2-4 people at a time participate with around 20 mins in between. Do the math, and consider the potential technical difficulties that will happen.   Participants are given a chance to restart. That's not a bad thing if you get to have an extra 10 mins of VR time.  PrepWhen entering the initial room, you'll be strapped with chest and head gear with gun included.  Use some damn common sense.. You're being strapped with expensive tech, so there shouldn't be any reason you'll be having a WWE match or doing medieval shit once the fun begins.  Then again it's hard to tell that to a little kid or someone who's not tech savvy.The Experience (no spoilers)When first strapping on the headset, things get weird.  Not like bestiality weird.  You're seeing a different representation of the room you're in.  Graphically, you won't see jaw dropping details, nor will you be able to feel the same texture of a brick wall in VR.  Your gun will be in VR, and so will the other participants, and that's when augmented reality kicks in.  Unfortunately you don't wear any hand sensors, so your body will be invisible (from your view).  No hands, no feet, no intimate parts.  There are limitations as to what you can physically interact with, but The Void experience does a pretty good job of placing you in a physical environment that cleverly ""changes"" in a small space without you knowing (check out The Void's web site if you want to get a better sense of the ""magic"" behind it).  I felt like I was in a real elevator just as well as being on a city skyscraper with a broad view of the city.  The use of vibrations, smell, changes in temperature definitely add to this surreal experience.  I never felt any motion sickness, but occasionally felt ""off.""  2 hours of this kind of this experience might get me to puke.  Kids will go into this thing acting stupid.  Some females will scream out loud just because.  As a tech lover and gamer, I quickly ""adapted"" to this half digital world.  I loved the familiar feeling as a gamer, but I knew my limits (half the time.), and it felt similar to playing an early Tomy Clancy 'Rainbow Six' video game, graphically and pace-wise (at least that's how I treated it)  I wanted to be ready for surprises.  I crouched my way into certain areas leading a charge and feeling badass.   I thought ""Whoa, this is going to be EXTREME in the next decade.  Or Earlier.""  I'm ready to dump wads of money in some VR stock!   The Void experience here is Ghostbusters themed, and as you can imagine there will be some potentially scary moments.  I found them mildly scary, but extremely cool, and I'm sure 15 minutes of this experience will be more memorable and original than 2 hours of the Ghostbusters movie remake.  At one point. All hell kinda breaks loose, and I could see the limitless possibilities of experiencing worlds like never before.  That was the  defining moment.  This tech is new and with so much potential, but it's going to be a process before VR is gonna push this experience to the edge.  Despite some forgivable flaws, I couldn't be picky.  I was transported to another world.  I saw the potential.  I felt the thrills.  The future is exciting... and scary.",6,3,4
152,Matthew M.,"Hartford, CT",7,12,1,3.0,8/18/2017,"The wax figures in Madame Tussaud's are simply incredible and stunning, yet I felt that the experience was a tad too short (especially for the entry price). We saw the marvel 4D movie which was well made but could have been longer. You never really get enough time to fully appreciate the wax figures as there are hundreds of people that are waiting or even rushing just to get a photo with the celebrity reincarnations which leaves you uncomfortable and overwhelmed to take a quick photo and move on. Overall Madame Tussaud's was one of those things you wouldn't want to do again but glad to say you have done it.",,,
153,Nicole P.,"New York, NY",0,11,5,3.0,10/29/2016,"I loved the whole museum and all of the attractions and would recommend them to friendsBut my rating is based on service at the front ticket desk. Our ticket guy was a young man about 26 years old, skinny, and kind of feminine. He looked miserable and had an attitude. Its customer service. I work in customer service as well. They tell us that if you can't smile and treat guests nicely, then it is not the department for you. My main issue is that he charged us for an infant. The baby was 8 months and in a chest carrier. He slept most of our time there. I asked for tickets for ""3 adults"" and the guy said ""And one infant.."" in an annoyed tone. I had looked up prices beforehand and did not see ticket prices for babies on the internet or on the screen at the museum. we paid for it but I find it ridiculous to have to pay for a child so young that they won't remember the experience. The child can't even walk or talk yet..I found it rude and the gentlemen clearly did not like his job. Those are the first people a guest encounters when they walk into the establishment. They start off the experience. The museum was amazing. But its a bunch of wax people. The employees need to be told that if they cannot put on a happy face in customer service or be considerate, they need a different job",1,,

The museum itself is actually pretty neat they have some pretty cool displays However, I had some of the worst customer service ever!!!!! Idk if it's just me or is everyone in New York Super Frickin Rude every time I've visited I've always ran into a rude female and I'm from Philly so it's not abnormal. I purchased tickets for a 3-D super hero show similar to the ones they have at Disney. Actually this 1 was way better sorry Walt:( the female working the register was rude as hell at the concession stand and the female passing out the glasses for the show was also rude. I was just trying to figure out who woke up first and decided they didn't want their job because I surely was an unsatisfied customer who wasn't letting it go! I got free $20 game cards to dave and busters next door and free candy (woohoo) lol America has gotta do better!

But at full price I think I would have definitely been dissapointed. Not a ton of wax figures missing several icons I'm assuming they scatter them at different locations to inspire you to go more than once but was definitely fun to take pics with them and see their real life size and height, several presidents including the Obama's fidel Lincoln several celebrities and a cool 10 min 4d movie at the end.

We accidentally purchased tickets to the Hollywood location because the website connected us to Hollywood instead of NYC and when we asked for our options the Manager just said ""Nothing we can do. Call Hollywood on Monday and they will refund you"". No offer of any kind to encourage us to stay and visit. OK - fine - our bad for buying them wrong.

173,Richard S.,"New York, NY",4,141,0,2.0,5/6/2016,"The place is unequivocally a tourist trap and its terrible for several reasons:1. Yeah, the statues are cool, but that is the only reason they get any stars at all. They are certainly not worth the prices that they ask for just for a ticket; moreover, those souvenirs are CHEAPO ""made in china"" and what they want for them is plain crazy. 2. Management sucks the suits upstairs don't know anything about working the floor with the customers they will come down and berate an employee for any dumb reason when they couldn't do the job they are asking of them. 3. The whole ""wax hands"" thing.... its DANGEROUS don't kid yourself. The workers are briefly trained in how to do it. You can burn yourself! And if you are going to do it then fine, but don't let your little kid do it (especially if they cant hold still).4. Back to management.... I don't know why they do this, but often there is not enough workers to main the floor. This causes an issue because sometimes the line to buy souvenirs is a mile long and backs up severely. ITS COOL TO CHECK OUT IF YOU DONT MIND PISSING AWAY MONEY BUT JUST BE FOR WARNED THAT THE PLACE IS THERE TO HOSE YOU GOOD AND DONT FALL FOR THOSE WAX HANDS ITS NOT WORTH IT.",,,1

179,Alan L.,"Brooklyn, NY",276,681,3400,4.0,10/23/2013,"Suggestion if you go buy tickets on their website you will get 20% of the ticket. If you are a New York City Resident you will get 25% of your ticket. You can also check in on yelp and receive 20% off all access pass. This is a pretty cool place with tons of New York flavor to it. A lot of the figures look really real and very detailed, for example Robin Williams. Others doesn't like the person or lacks the features like Oprah Winfrey and Eli Manning. A lot of these figures are really short, I always assume that some these stars are taller, but I guess they aren't. I think my favorite part of the wax museum is the historical section of it. It was cool to see the Presidents and other historical figures that impacted history, for example, Martin Luther King Jr, Ghandi, Princess Diana, etc. Pretty expensive tickets even if you use the 25% NYC resident discount, but I think it's worth seeing it once in your lifetime. If you can't take a photo of your favorite star, why not come here.",,,
180,Sunook C.,"North Wales, PA",0,6,0,2.0,7/17/2017,I cannot get it why it is popular and costs  $37. Maybe my expectation was too high?  No craftsmanship there. All you can see is  the mannequin you can see even in the show window. Really disappointing.,1,,
181,Julia S.,"Westlakes, Bakersfield, CA",106,1,0,2.0,3/28/2018,"So we get there and the line is long, which is understandable. Then one of the workers call out ""if you are paying with any type of card, get in this line"" so my friend and I got into the other line because we thought it would be a little quicker. No. We're waiting and the cash line is just zipping by and it seems like they lost focus on the card line because the people who were standing in front of us were paid and in the museum about 7 minuets before we even got to the register. The workers were rude when people that were waiting in the card line wanted to cut in front of the cash line BECAUSE WE WERE WAITING WAY LONGER THAN THEY WERE, people who had just walked in were paid and through the doors before we were, which is what made us really frustrated and the people around us were saying the same thing. Once I got to the register the worker named Annette was just sitting there laughing with who I think is the manager, disregarding us completely for about 2 minuets, I was frustrated and almost wanted to leave, but once I got into the museum everything went smoothly, it's a beautiful place  but the staff are very unorganized. If I didn't live across the country and didn't only have one chance to see this museum I would have left and came back once every body had their stuff together. It's ridiculous.",,,
182,Shannon H.,"East Meadow, NY",14,91,11,3.0,2/27/2017,"Never been so it was cool to check it out. It was very hot so I would recommend not bringing a jacket in. Plus there is no lockers or anything. Some of the wax figures are very very good & some were not. Couldn't even make out justine Timberlake. The Ghostbusters slime show is so expensive. Went into a short 9 minute movie with 3D glasses was neat. The smoke smell like mint, the seat was vibrating and they had a little surprise poke in your back lol. I wouldn't go every week but it's cool maybe once a year since they change it up",,,
183,Amanda B.,"Petersburg, VA",154,302,90,5.0,1/3/2016,"I went on an extremely crowded night, and I probably shouldn't have.  This place is full of awesome picture opportunities, but if it's crowded be prepared to wait your turn and get pushed in front of by other people who don't know manners.  I didn't get a lot of pictures; mostly because I kept getting pushed in front of by children or other stupid people that can't see the huge line in front of them.  Also, I thought there was an Avengers wax models, but there aren't.  There's a movie thing but I didn't go to it cause 4D makes me sick.  There's a lot of sports figures, politicians, actresses, actors, celebrities in general..  The set up of the store is very nice.  They have a candy store/food bar near the end that has a nice happy hour where you can get good beer for $3.50.  I really wish I would've gone during a not so busy day, I might've enjoyed it far better.",1,1,1
184,Anh L.,"Boston, MA",387,86,255,3.0,1/6/2016,"Don't come here during New Year... Super crowded you cannot even take pictures! Most of the time would be spent waiting in line just to move through the place. We used the New York Pass to get our tickets and still had to wait for a really long time. They don't have too many wax figures here, and a lot of them look really fake. I went to the ones in DC and I like that one much much better!",1,,1
185,Adam B.,"Marysville, WA",7,120,3,5.0,5/29/2016,"Such a fun experience for the whole family.  I was surprised you could get so close to the displays, allowing you to get great pictures for fun.  They have almost anyone you can think of, and an assortment of local celebrities.  They also had some cool action shot stations where you could stand in King Kong's hand for a photo shoot or fly a bike with ET in your basket. Pretty cool.  Its hard not to buy those pictures later. Everyone is so life like, it was a fun experience and we loved it.",,,
186,Monica S.,"Gig Harbor, WA",60,41,17,4.0,5/24/2016,"Totally fun, don't miss it. Buy your tix online they will be a little cheaper. Staff funnels the crowd through at a nice pace so you don't feel rushed or crowded. Don't forget your camera!",,,
187,Tatiana O.,"Colorado Springs, CO",1,11,0,2.0,3/7/2017,"It is funny they are asking to ""like us on yelp"", but they don't honor yelp discount. Typical tourist place. I like the one in Las Vegas better",,,

Posing with the Spice Girls and becoming Asian 5 spice was awesome.Tip- get playful with the statues but don't ruin them.",,,
189,Ally V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0,4.0,8/5/2016,"I can honestly just say my phone was at full capacity with the amount of photos I took, especially with Rihanna, Leonardo DiCaprio, and of course, the queen, Jennifer Lawrence. You'll fan girl over how realistic these famous celebrity wax figures look. But you better have cash because it's quite expensive. Ok, I'm done. (:",,,

But Leonardo DiCaprioDanzel WashingtonAnd Kim kardashian dont look like them You can also rent a locker for $ 5 dllrs. We forward go to Washington & las Vegas wax museum thanks madame in nyc,,3,1
191,Dan R.,"East Falmouth, MA",102,1615,5643,4.0,2/17/2015,"Getting into this wax museum costs a pretty penny, but the museum is totally worth the cost. We ended up stopping here while visit Times Square and before we knew it, we had been here for hours.All of the statues were great and we enjoying taking a ton of photos. Our final thought was that this is a must see for anyone visiting the area.",,,
192,Priscilla W.,"San Francisco, CA",241,606,2235,3.0,9/21/2012,"Madame Tussauds sure knows how to take 5 hours of your day away by looking at wax. Some figures were very realistic, such as Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, and NSYNC. But others like Julia Roberts and Carrie Underwood just didn't cut it for me. Some figures had a greasy sheen to them as well, probably from too many people touching their faces.There were so many figures that I got bored in the end and just wanted to leave already. But for the most part, the museum was organized. Actors on the top floor, musicians in another section, political figures in a separate section, etc. etc.They have an overpriced candy store right before the 4D show and a gift shop right before the exit elevators. If you're not suckered into purchasing from either of those two, take a look at the free discount card selection next to the exiting elevators. They offer discounts to some stores (ie: Dylan's Candy Bar) and other NY attractions (ie: Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises).Purchasing tickets online saves you 20%, so the total comes to about $31 per ticket, where full price is around $40. Still, ridiculously overpriced to just look at (and take pictures with) wax. Then again, visiting Madame Tussauds is something you probably only do once.",1,,1
193,JiHae L.,"Sunnyside, NY",111,168,572,4.0,1/9/2015,Very entertaining! I got a groupon for this since I've been wanting to go since forever!  Glad that I went! Friday night and it wasn't even crowded.,,,
194,Dewan A.,"Haledon, NJ",684,1438,1701,5.0,9/12/2015,Nice spot. 1) Came here with a Groupon which made Madame Tussauds worth it. 2) It is worth coming once in your life. 3) I really liked the 10-minute Marvels Avengers 4D show at the end of the tour.,2,,1
195,Juliet N.,"Broward County, FL",185,189,872,5.0,6/24/2015,"When you live in NY and realize there are so many things that tourist fly out here to see and do, and here we are just sitting around with these great places less than an hour away , you hop yourself on the train and head down to the city. Where do we go to first? why Madame tussaude of course!          At first when I heard the prices I felt like, come on, atleast give us a residence discount, but then we remembered nope, not in NYC. After getting up to the gallery, we passed a huge glass area where you are looking down and around the whole 42nd street. Its absolutely gorgeous and definitely calls for a mini photo shoot! but don't get to consumed in the fun, you've got a gallery to go see!      My first reaction was...hmm okay. there was bright reddish lighting and I thought it was a bit tacky but again I don't know what I should've expected in the first place lol. As you get up close with these AMAZING wax figures you realize, holly crap these people aren't as big or tall as I imagined theyd be in person lol I think the hottest wax person was definitely JLO. They had her an a drop dead gorgeous dress. Walking along, I see my Favorite actor ever! Bollywood sensation Shah Rukh khan. I honestly teared up a little. It was so pathetic because it was then I realize I'm having a heart attack in front of a wax . I was also relieved that I didn't embarrass myself in front of the actual actor lol.      After being torn away we walked into different eras of famous singers, actors, rappers and athletes. Since it was the winter time when we visited, it was really cool that they had a ""NYC"" themed area with a real taxi cab and statue head that you can climb into for awesome photos!     I kept thinking to myself that's probably it but nope there's was a whole entire SUPER HERO section, my 2nd favvvv. They had the hulk who I'm a huge fannn of! I absolutely love this place and I think you and your family would too. Its absolutely different than anything else you'll find in the city!",6,3,3
196,Tiff C.,"Queens, NY",109,702,905,4.0,12/6/2015,"Came here with my aunt, and we had a good time. Not something I would come back to see over and over. I never understood why people were so obsessed with taking photos of wax celebrities -- not like they are the real person. But I understand it's all fun and a good way to pass the time and maybe a touristy thing to do. We didn't really linger long or hang out much, so it didn't take us longer than an hour and a half tops. There are celebrities and important political figures. Depending when you go, it can be crowded and the more popular wax figures will get more attention and more clustering. Overall, not bad.",,,
197,Yvette A.,"Horseheads, NY",0,3,0,2.0,4/22/2016,"Overpriced even with the Groupon. Took my grandson to the city for a fun afternoon to breakup Homeschooling. Thought this would be a great venue for him to see some wax figures of people he may or may not know. Anyway, we got our tickets go in an elevator that took us to the 9th floor. First thought was, wow this is gonna be great there is gonna be alot of things to see 9 floors worth. Well to our surprise when we finished the 9th floor we had to walk down some stairs, OK no problem. Then!!!!!! Passed 8th and down to 7th.....hmmmm. did We miss something? Hubby asks someone at the desk, they say ""OH YOU CAUGHT THAT, MANY PEOPLE DON'T"". So ok they consolidated.. on to stairs again. Hmmmm passed 6th down to 5th.. they did it again, skipped a floor. Then from 5th we thought ok we will go to 3rd then first, NOPE! Here's the elevator  and the sign says the end... WHAAAAT??? Just happened?I am so disappointed with them and the fact that the guy says ""Oh you caught that huh"" don't go unless you want to waste $30 per person.",,,
