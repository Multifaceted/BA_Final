0,Sharon M.,"Jacksonville, FL",54,176,1048,4.0,9/6/2018,"Met Kayla (or Kaila?) at check-out. Too bad she wasn't our check-in person. The gentleman at check-in was fine but Kayla has a super warm personality which is perfect for guest services. Room sizes are fine for NYC. There are a lot of outlets/USB ports to charge your devices at the bedside table and desk. You definitely won't be fighting for outlet space in these rooms. Coffee, tea are available in the lobby. Complementary breakfast is available starting at 6am featuring a mix of hot & cold items. One morning the bananas were a little overripe but otherwise, decent options if you want to grab a quick bite or coffee before you start your day. I think there were to-go bags available at the front desk too one morning. Conveniently located in the Chelsea neighborhood. Penn Station, Union Square, Eataly, Korea town, Flat Iron, Times Square are easily walkable distances. There's a lot of food options nearby on 6th and 7th Avenues including a Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. There's a fridge in the room too.There was a lot of construction out front during my visit making the entrance easy to miss.",2,1,1

2,Jessica M.,"Atlanta, GA",1215,215,367,4.0,8/9/2018,"Def would have rather Stayed at a small boutique hotel for around the same price but that's personal preference and not anyone's fault. Good news is the room is prob a few square feet larger than those cute random boutique ones, and you'd get your reward points. Downsides are there is def no cute or trendy feel. It's like the small random town feel except in smaller space. Housekeeping is good and breakfast is free as always. Friendly staff. My room was a bit moist and smelled like stale carpet when I arrived I almost switched rooms but didn't want to go through the hassle. If it's a cheaper stay and you are budgeting then this is your place, but if you find a comparable boutique place with decent reviews I'd def consider that first for a more Nyc experience. Here I wake up and feel like I'm in North Carolina or Indy or another small town I've traveled to.  Again only real complaint is my room was a bit stale {my friends other 2 rooms were not as such}, just personally would prefer if I'm spending a few hundred a night, to not do it at a chain hotel I've stayed at for half the price in other cities.Coffee is hot and free all day and night. And they even have the fresh cookies in the eve. I saw complaints about the ac being loud but it's Nyc people---and I personally love the loud buzz bc it drowns our the street noise.",1,1,1
3,Chaldea S.,"Murrieta, CA",62,107,315,4.0,5/16/2018,"My husband and I loved our stay at the Hampton Inn Chelsea! It's very centrally located in Manhattan. About 2 blocks away from Madison Square Park (shake shack!) and the flat iron. Lots of food, shopping and great cafes within walking distance! Upon arrival, we were greeted by Carmel. She was AWESOME! So nice, helpful and absolutely a joy to talk to. We were staying in the city to celebrate my birthday and Carmel upgraded us from a one queen bed to a two queen with a city view on the 16th floor. SUPER NICE! Thank you, Carmel!The room was decently sized for New York standards and the view was phenomenal. Free breakfast is always a plus, even if the options were mediocre at best. It's nice not having to worry about the first meal of the day. While the room seemed updated with lots of usb charging ports, fridge, coffee maker and flat screen tv, the carpet was D.I.R.T.Y. and sticky. We felt like we couldn't walk around barefoot in the room.. so that's the reason for 1 star off. Aside from that, great stay! We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NYC!",,,
4,Keta G.,"Seattle, WA",0,2,0,5.0,11/18/2018,This hotel is in a great location and an easy walk to the subway or Times Square. Kila at the front next was incredible and gave us Gabe recommendations. The room was clean and more than a decent Size for Manhattan.,,,

Ugh!!The breakfast room has recycling but though generic signage may meet some city regulation, it is not helpful. Maybe that is why most paper plates marked for recycling still land up in garbage.Some staff members seem rather indifferent, others seem not empowered to help customers. Still a few were really friendly. Thanks, Aminata!Ps. A note to management:  why do employee name tags look like small blackboards with names written in chalk. That looked so temporary that I thought all your employees were just contractors.",,,

8,Alisa G.,"San Francisco, CA",17,26,49,1.0,6/26/2017,"I don't understand where all these good reviews are coming from!  Especially about cleanliness. DO NOT STAY HERE! - BEDBUGS or Flees!!! My legs are covered in ugly red bits. The manager didn't want to do anything about it. He said they need to wait for the pest investigation of the room first and than I will be contacted with the report. I do not care of the investigation, I am already infected and had to go back home to San Francisco with this embarrassing red bits all over my legs. It is itchy and painful now too! BTW, THERE ARE SOME PRIOR REVIEWS FROM GUESTS ABOUT BEDBUGS IN THIS PLACE. I wish I've seen it before booking!! - Sticky, filthy carpet. Had to wear shoes all the time. - Extremely loud AC in the room. Impossible to sleep with, but impossible to sleep without     neither during the summer because way too hot. - Housekeeping very loud in the early mornings. Kept slamming the doors of each room as many times as she had to go in and out... Lasted at least few hours every morning. - Check in took forever!!! The longest check in we ever had. And not to mention, other people in line behind us were saying the same thing. The only good thing about this place is, Location.",8,,
9,Que S.,"New Orleans, LA",222,3,0,5.0,8/14/2018,"After having a below average experience at The Omni Berkshire, we opted out of booking an additional stay at that hotel to stay at The Hampton Inn Chelsea. Ironically our experience at a 3 star hotel outshined our experience staying at a 4 star hotel. First off we were greeted with a smile and warm hospitality. The rooms were modern and had tons of outlets for charging all of your PEDs, and most importantly it was clean. They provide a simple modest complimentary breakfast, and you can expect a crowded area at breakfast time, I mean it is complimentary ;) The gym is very small and only has a treadmill and stationary bike, but if that isnt a huge concern for you this is a great hotel for budget travelers and families alike.",,,
10,David H.,"Falls Church, VA",379,1354,2130,4.0,7/4/2016,"This is the place to stay in NYC. The prices are good for NYC, the staff is VERY friendly, and the rooms are an okay size by NYC standards with comfortable beds. It comes with free continental breakfast which is okay but nothing special, but for free it's not bad and they have 24 hour free coffee.Be warned the hallways are tiny so jackasses slamming doors may wake you up and the two elevators are tiny so it can be a long wait.The location is perfect and close to lots of restaurants, bars, parks and a bunch of subway stations. I'll stay here again next time I'm in NYC and glad I found this place.",4,1,1

Updated review","The King size bed hotel room was clean and comfortable, bathroom was nearly sparkling. Multiple light fixtures, brightens the rooms to soft white. A great sizable room; for reference I would say a decent size for two adults and two children. Not many hotels in the city have this much leg room. During my last stay from a year ago, I experienced loud door slamming noises every morning from 8am until late noon (mostly house keeping going in and out of rooms). This time around I noticed the doors have more resistance while closing, eliminating the slamming noises.The air conditioner vent noise wasn't much of a bother, in contrast, it was like a noise cancellation for the outside street. The service at the front desk isn't as consistent. While I had a great rapport during check out (3/24 early AM), the check in representative wasn't as pleasant; perhaps it was later in the night.I hope in the near future the hotel may consider adding on body shampoo gel options instead of just bar soap, and firmer pillows.",2,,1

14,Chad R.,"Prosper, TX",0,3,0,3.0,8/23/2018,"Probably more 2.5 stars.  Hotel location is pretty good and close to many restaurants and shopping. The rooms were small even by NYC standards.  The gym is essentially worthless - 1 elliptical, 1 bike and 1 treadmill. No weights and some exercise balls but no place to use them. My biggest complaint is the elevators. There are two antiquated elevators that are shared with maintenance and housekeeping. Plan on spending a lot of time on them if you're on a higher floors. Staff is fairly personable.   I stay in NYC several times a year. There are places that are much nicer for the same price.",,,

We booked two city view rooms and all five adults enjoyed it. The perks of staying here:* Location, location, and location. You are 10-15 minutes from  Time Square. I had 4 colleagues fly to New York for work, a month prior to our trip, and they stayed in other hotels and their biggest complaint was noise, traffic, and the streets being overcrowded. You won't get this from this hotel. It is in a quiet street and the subway is around the street. We walked everywhere. * Free breakfast (trust me, you save a lot of money in NY City)* Brand new remodeled rooms with new beds and cushion* New wallpaper and fresh paint* Clean bathrooms that included Neutrogena products* Friendly front desk staff. Our favorite person was Lucy. She was wonderful! She was so kind, informative, smart, and extremely professional. Lucy took the time to show us a map and tell us what her favorite restaurants were. She made our vacation unforgettable. She had a smile everyday. Thanks Lucy! We will be back.",,,

19,Sonivette C.,"Elizabeth, NJ",10,14,26,1.0,1/19/2018,"If I could give negative stars, I would. My husband and me spent the weekend here for the company party. We arrived Friday afternoon, around 2:30pm. We parked our car on the side street and explained to the younger dark skinned women that there was a sign saying "" Commercial Parking Only "". She explained that one of the gentlemen would be outside soon to move our car. We believed her and continued about our day. In between, we couldn't get much sleep due to the heating system, it would turn on automatically and was very loud and disrupting. Fast forward to Sunday morning - check out - the same women confronted us and explained that our car had received a ticket due to them not moving the car in time. We parked BEFORE 2:30 & the ticket time was almost 5! But yet, she had told us that our car would've been moved ""soon"". $150 ticket could've been prevented if this hotel would've been doing their job. This same women explains to us that she already spoke to the women who handles the finances of the company and that we'll be refund by them. Which ultimately doesn't make sense. This is a matter between my husband and this hotel, not the company he works for. 2 weeks later - today 1/19/18 THIS MATTER IS STILL ON GOING. The SAME dark skinned women continues to lie, going back and fourth, saying she spoke to different people from my husband company. when he confirms with his co-workers, not one person from this hotel has reached out. we continue to call and ask for a supervisor, once again, we are speaking to the same women. If she a Manager or the front desk head, this is not the way to resolve a situation. Today, we called once again, she gave us the same story, with such a disgusting attitude, she hanged up on my husband In the middle of their Conversation. Do yourself a favor, Don't book this hotel. Unprofessional!!!",1,,
20,Billie Jo J.,"Lakewood, CA",44,50,13,4.0,7/16/2017,I liked the room we were in but found the floor to be very noisy. Someone was banging on a door for a while before I finally called for security.

The heat/ac/fan in the room can be turned off if the noise bothers you. There is some street noise, I guess, but it's New York City so duh. This is a perfectly nice Hampton Inn in my experience !",,,
22,Kelly M.,"London, United Kingdom",5,10,27,5.0,9/4/2015,"I was booked this hotel after a reservation made through airbnb (my first ever) turned out to be a nightmare.. I arrived quite late in the day and was greeted by a lovely receptionist who gave me my reservation info and swipes cards the entire process took no longer than 4 minutes.  When I checked into my room the thing that stood out was the size of the bed it was huge, warm and inviting and after the hell of a day I had I showered slipped under the covers for an instant rest.... well actually the bed was so comfortable my rest lasted until the next morning.  It was by far the most blissful sleep I have had in ages!!I woke up in time for the free breakfast. .. they say continental but the choice is ample!!!!! In some 'plusher' hotels you would defiantly pay in excess of $15 for the spread they layed out.... waffles, toast, bagels, eggs, bacon, yoghurt, fruits a variety of juices and 4 different types of coffee... did somebody say refills... yes that's right in the plural form... I was stuffed and it was a great way to start the day.Location wise it's accessible to the city and couldn't be more better placed.... free WiFi USB and LAN ports in the room. The value for money is tremendous.This is by no means a luxury hotel however it's a lovely hotel I am glad  I 'accidentally ' found this little gem as I will defiantly be staying here in the future.I was booked into a room which had been adapted for those with disabilities. I don't have any so will not speak on behalf of those who do but I travel with my mother often who has limited mobility.   The adaptation to the curtains and added rails (all pictured) are great, in fact fantastic.  However, the corridor space and layout doesn't really lend itself to a traveller in maybe a wheelchair or someone with disabilities travelling alone as it would take a lot of manoeuvring to get about the room freely and this would hinder their freedom somewhat. (My opinion)Lastly - late check out... this can be very hit and miss and many hotels want to charge!  However, I called down to the desk and spoke to Shelly who extended my room with no hesitation, although this is clearly something that can only be done if they have the room space etc.N.B. The photo of the bed was not my room, my bed was double the size lol. I asked the housekeeping if I could take a picture for the review as when I got to my room I jumped in the bed before even thinking about pictures LOOL....",4,1,1

We were on a long road trip and had our bicycles and a car full of stuff. The manager and her staff were extremely accommodating as we stored luggage, moved bikes around, etc. They were really helpful with the valet parking since the ride was going to last well into the afternoon. Honestly, they were excited for us and other guests who were there for the ride. It was so nice!Our room was great as well. We had plenty of room for our bikes and gear and didn't feel cramped. The hotel is also in a handy location between the Flatiron building and Chelsea. The next time I'm in NYC, this is the first place I will look for an available room.",4,,2

However, with only one of the two elevators working during the entire week that I've been here, it makes simply leaving the hotel during peak hours incredibly frustrating. I left my room at 9:45 this morning, hoping to catch breakfast which closes at 10am. It is now 10:15am, and I am still standing in the hallway on floor 11 waiting for an elevator that is not already packed full of people and luggage.

This hotel was very convenient to TWO major subway stops and right in the middle of eating and shopping. The hallways are very narrow and the rooms are small (I mean, it's NYC). The noise level was VERY low (which I loved, seeing that I needed SLEEP). The rooms were clean and well laid-out for the space provided. All rooms are close to the elevator as the building only has 9 floors and the floors aren't large.The front staff was very pleasant and inviting.

27,Evan P.,"Washington, DC",115,842,0,4.0,6/7/2015,"Great value for your money! The hotel is in a good location just 2 blocks from the subway and close to Union Square, Times Square, and many other places that you may want to visit. The rooms were surprisingly large, had many extra outlets, and were very comfortable (the view could be better, but you shouldn't be spending too much time looking out your window anyways). The staff was absolutely phenomenal! The woman at the front desk was very attentive, welcoming, and friendly. She made us feel like we were honored guests. The staff also held our bags after check-out and also greeted us whenever we returned or left. There are warm cookies ready when you arrive and there is a great complimentary hot breakfast. The biggest drawback, if any, was that there are only 2 elevators so it sometimes takes some time for the elevator to arrive to your floor or bring you to the lobby. Overall, a great stay, excellent value, and will definitely be a place where I stay again.",2,,2
28,Bryan H.,"Carmichael, CA",4,67,22,4.0,7/12/2016,"I'm a long standing Hilton Diamond Member and have stayed at many Hilton Hotels.  I brought my family here for a week long stay and was quite impressed with it overall and would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.The Plusses: -Super friendly and helpful staff.  From the front desk folks to the housekeepers to the maintenance staff- ALL were very very nice-It is in a very quiet neighborhood (I would NEVER stay at one of the Hilton's on Times Square for a multitude of reasons...just read all THOSE reviews.-Very close to subway systems, just a couple blocks of a walk and you can hit a few different subway entrances-Close to tons of great restaurants and just a block away from an awesome place named ""Eately""  That place is jam packed during all open hours and for good reason.  We grabbed food there and had a picnic in Central Park.  YUM-Rooms are clean and tidy-Hotel is clean and tidy-Hotel is small. (to me, that's great because the fewer the people the better haha)   I think there are only like 8 rooms on each floor-Free breakfast includedThe Minuses:-As expected, the rooms are small, but that didn't really matter to us because we were only there for showers and sleeping.  We spent no time in the hotel otherwise so small rooms made ZERO difference to us.  -The room was supposed to have two Queen beds.  They were NOT queen beds, they were doubles.  Boo-We are on an extended vacation and have a few more stops, so we decided to do laundry.  They have a laundry facility with ONE washer and ONE dryer.  No problem with that because they were rarely used, BUT the soap and dryer sheet dispenser was completely sold out and never restocked during our visit so I had to walk to the local CVS to purchase laundry soap.  Minor inconvenience and a little irritating, but that's what I call a ""first world problem""...don't sweat the small stuff",2,,
29,Michael Y.,"Washington, DC",134,68,51,3.0,7/18/2016,"I stayed here for 5 consecutive days and was very, very nervous.  The last two times I've stayed in NYC I stayed at boutique hotels, and everyone warned me against staying here.  That said, while it wasn't terrible, the bad sadly outweighed the good. Pros:- Comfy mattress! And no bedbugs, despite previous reviews.  The room was very clean and showed very little wear.- Free breakfast was included.  It was nothing special, but it gave me the ability to sit down for 10 minutes and fuel up before a long day.- Check-in was quick.  He took care of me in just under a minute, which I needed after a long ride.- Great location!  I walked everywhere I needed to be.Cons:- The room thermostat went down to 68, and I sent it down as low as I could.  However, every night I was sweating because it kept getting SO hot!  The humidity was the big problem, as my clothes actually felt damp from the humidity in the room.- The blanket has a design which, if the top of the blanket touches your skin, scrapes your skin clean off!  Exaggeration, but it was very scratchy and uncomfortable.  The inside was soft and comfy, but that design...- Screeching showers!  Every morning, I woke up earlier than I had to because the shower in the room above me would emit this high-pitched screech.  I heard dogs barking in Brooklyn, it was so piercing.  The consensus?  This is a perfectly good hotel when you're awake.  Sleeping was the real challenge here.  I would stay here again, but only during the cooler seasons.  I would certainly recommend it to families on a budget.",1,1,1
30,Brian M.,"West Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",185,19,27,5.0,8/24/2016,"I stayed at the Hampton Inn Manhattan Chelsea for 3 nights a few weeks ago and I was pleasantly surprised with my stay. To be honest, I had low expectations, but I was totally wrong. Full disclosure here, I chose this location because it was one of the cheapest I could find.I made my reservations through Booking.com and had requested a room towards the top of the building. When I checked in I was placed on the second floor, but was able to get this moved up to the 12th floor, which was perfect for me (it was quite, but I also didn't have to wait for the elevator as long as higher floors). The actual room was clean, the bed was comfortable and I had an awesome view of the Freedom Tower. The building must have been renovated recently and had plugs all over the place, which made it super easy for someone who obsessively charges their phone like me. Oh yeah, the free wifi was really nice too!The breakfast was exactly what you would expect, but is perfect for a quick bite. The lobby also had coffee and ice water available all day, a very nice touch. The location was perfect with lots of things to do within walking distance. The front desk also held my bags for me free of charge for about 10 hours. To sum it up, I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely recommend for someone looking for a comfortable and cost effective place to stay in Manhattan. I hope to go back soon!",1,,

32,Sycho L.,"Frisco, TX",82,4,0,2.0,3/28/2017,"Here's my experience I had, fresh from minutes ago. After a late night flight, I walked into Hampton Inn, New York, Chelsea at midnight. I said I had a reservation and gave my ID and reservation number. While they were pulling it up, I mentioned that I booked through Egencia because I didn't realize at the time that it didnt qualify the stay for Honors points or contribute to Elite status, and was hoping they could make an exception since I'm trying to be a loyal Hilton Honors member. And they said nope. Nothing we can do. Also, we dont have a reservation. Your confirmation number is for an Emil Tenbarge. They would not let me up to my room. I said what are you talking about?? Call that phone number and THIS phone will ring! THIS is the credit card that has already paid for the entirety of this stay! What do you think the chances that someone else named Emil booked the exact same itinerary?? They said its not their fault, it's Egencia's. They were like believe me if it was our fault we'd do something about it! They said Egencia people must have keyed it in wrong, and I should call them and tell them what an inconvenience they have caused me. So i called Egencia from the lobby and after a relaxing long hold, they said they confirmed it was the hotels fault. I watched the hotel employees scrambling behind the desk to figure out what happened and after 5 or 10 minutes they called me up and said it was a mistake on their part. I mentioned what an inconvenience it was and pointed out they said they'd do something if it was their fault. I brought up points or at least stay contribution to elite status and they said they wouldnt give either to me and that they did do something: fixed the error and offered their sincerest apologies. Then they gave me complimentary swedish fish.I'll say 2 stars to account for the fact that I haven't given any thought to the facilities, since I'm still fuming about what just happened: the sheer unwillingness to assist someone who's literally going out of his way to exclusively stay at Hilton properties. Why am I trying so hard to stick with Hilton? They do next to nothing for me, besides take my money.",1,,
33,Tanya R.,"Hatboro, PA",21,22,3,4.0,5/9/2016,"I booked this hotel several weeks ago through Hotels.com.  We opted out of a city view room for one overnight stay with mom.  The location is great.  I am a frequent traveler to New York because of the food, but rarely stay overnight.  This hotel is close to foodie shopping hot spots such as Chelsea Market, Union Square and Eataly. It is also a short walk away from the subway, making it easy to travel to distant neighborhoods.The staff is awesome! Front desk was extremely friendly and accommodating, offering us a list of local eateries and the like.  We felt truly welcomed there.  One of the staff members even had a refrigerator sent up from another room because we didn't already have one.  That was really cool! Delicious hot coffee is available around the clock, and a hearty breakfast is served every morning, no extra charge.  Because of all these positives, I feel bad giving this hotel a three-star rating.The price was great,  but we were disappointed with the view we had... a second-story view of the dumpsters.  Couldn't there have been a happy medium? Hence a star.  The other star because of the beds being uncomfortably hard.  Neither of us had a good night's sleep (something that we'd hoped for from a hotel stay) and I woke up with back pain.  We would hands-down stay here again if it weren't for the beds.",1,,1

36,Jelly R.,"Indianapolis, IN",56,251,176,4.0,9/14/2015,"We stayed at this hotel during a recent 6-day trip to New York. I'd previously been to New York (stayed at the Park Central in midtown, which is also a pretty decent hotel), and knew the hotel room would be small compared to other cities (even other major cities). This room itself was plenty big for two adults, all things considered. There was a dedicated chest to hold luggage (unlike those silly little fold-out luggage racks most hotels have), and we were able to easily fit two carry-on suitcases (side-by-side) and two duffel bags (stacked on top of eachother) on it. Despite there being a desk and two night stands, the room did not feel cramped (then again, we did not spend any significant amount of time in the room outside of sleeping). The room had a small closet with an iron and ironing board in it, and a rod with some hangers on it, and was comparable to what you'd find in any hotel in any city. There were a couple of drawers for clothes in the TV stand, and the drawer in each night stand also had ample space. The bathroom itself was very small, especially the sink area (of which a counter was practically non-existent): There was a narrow glass shelf situated directly above the faucet, but it wasn't really sufficient for holding much more, and would irritate anyone who is not super low maintenance. I'd have rather had a shower stall and more vanity counter space than a bath tub and tiny vanity because, honestly, who really wants to soak in a tub thousands of other guests have used before? In any hotel, especially hotels in NYC and in Florida, bugs are one of my primary concerns, so I read a fair amount of reviews before committing to a hotel, and pack my stuff in airtight travel bags. Other Manhattan hotels, especially many in the Times Square area, had reviews talking about roaches, bed bugs, etc. Eek! Based on the reviews, this hotel did not appear to have any of those problems, so I felt pretty confident booking it. I am happy to report this hotel was bug-free. The room appeared very clean when we got there, and there was a pre-printed Post-It note on the headboard informing us the sheets and duvet cover had been washed prior to our arrival. I thought it was odd, because it seems like a given-- not a bragging point-- that the sheets and bedding be washed between guests. It did not appear that our sheets were changed DURING our stay (since I found my hair on the sheets but under the cover after housekeeping had made the bed). I took down the Post-It note, to see if that would prompt a sheet-change, but it did not. There were also other areas where I felt housekeeping could have done better, but I'm not going to be petty and list them out here. It's not a deal-breaker, but it does makes an otherwise 5 star experience receive only 4 stars. The front-desk and breakfast staff were great. Check-in was smooth and fast, and the front-desk staff were very pleasant every time we encountered them on our way in or out. It was nice that the hotel offered a free breakfast, and kept it open until 10 a.m. for those of us who like to sleep in a little. Breakfast offerings included apples, oatmeal, make-your-own waffles, pre-made omelettes, sausage, cereal, sweet breads, yogurt, juice, etc. There was plenty of seating to accommodate everyone, and the staff kept everything replenished right up until 10 a.m. The location of the hotel was great, being on 24th St. and Sixth Avenue, right by subway stations on 23rd and Sixth, and 23rd and 8th. The neighborhood itself was also good, with plenty of things to do. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area.",5,,1

It was a pretty affordable option for the long weekend which fell on Valentine's Day, and there were several major conferences in NYC plus fashion week. I was happy to get such a great deal.The room was bigger than others I've stayed in in NYC, and very clean. During my 3 night stay, all staff that I encountered were courteous and polite. The continental breakfast is not my thing, but considering what a small hotel it is, there was a great lounge area where I did some work after checking out on my last day. It's also a perfect location. I would go out of my way to stay here again!",,,

40,Kay I.,"Brussels, Belgium",14,137,0,1.0,9/21/2015,"The hotel is clean. It is very expensive for what you pay for but they charge you for the prime location. The continental breakfast is okay and there aren't many amenities at this particular location. The service and cleanliness were great. My issue with this hotel is the mismanagement of billing. I had booked this hotel for 3 nights which in total with taxes would amount to $1340.46. The night before I checked in, my credit card had a pending charge of $446.81, after checking in they authorized an additional pending incidental charge of $1,094.68. So those 2 pending incidentals in total amount to $1541.49. Although they didn't charge it, it was an authorized pending so that amount was held during my stay. Upon checking out, my companion paid for half of the $1340.46 and I paid for the remaining half. When he arrived home, his bank had called to say that instead of being charged the 670.23, the Hampton Inn Chelsea had charged him twice. When he called to resolve this issue they told him that the refund would be released to him on October 1st, mind you it is September 18th. Then when I checked out and paid the remaining balance of 670.23 -- I thought it was fine and done. I return home and there are pending incidentals in the amount of $1541.49 and then the $670.23 which in total for holding amounts to $2211.72. If you account for the double amount my companion was charged and the entire amount I was held for after checking out - both of the charges on our cards were held at $3552.18 which is nearly 3x the amount of the entire stay. When I called the hotel twice, they informed me that I had to contact my credit card and to call back after 10 AM to speak with the accountants. When I contacted my credit card they told me that the hotel had to call to remove the pending incidentals. So basically, if you stay here. budget 3x what you pay for their 'incidentals' which they won't remove even after you check out of the hotel and paid with a receipt in hand. Also, they might charge you twice and hold your refund for 2+ weeks. I really would have given this location 3-4 stars for their service and location had they not completely mucked up the billing and decided that charging customers 3x in incidentals is appropriate. Mind you, I have stayed at other hotels, this is the first time that this has ever happened. Be wary staying here. Watch your credit card and if you are a family that needs the credit whilst you are traveling -- their pending incidentals will eat up your credit so be mindful of that while you travel.An update on this - I called them back after 10 as per the request of Carmel to speak with the accountant to release the excessive incidental charges held on my credit card. Apparently the accountant is out for the entire week so obviously I asked if my funds would be held for an additional week. She then informed me that the general manager could help & I waited for 5-10 minutes. After which point I was informed that the afternoon general manager would call me back between 3PM - 11 PM to speak to me about releasing my funds. She admitted that they had overcharged me for incidentals and had also double-charged my companion because we had split the bill and it mucked with their computer system. However, since she wasn't authorized to release the funds I would have to wait for their call between 3 PM - 11 PM to release the unauthorized funds. Will see if they resolve things and call me or if they plan on charging the 3x to my credit card as well as my companion. Probably will never stay at another Hampton Inn after this. Have never experienced such an atrocious billing nightmare at any other hotel worldwide. Good job Hampton Inn Chelsea. Glad you're billing your customers 3x the amount because they needed to split the costs halfway. Also glad to know that when a customer checks out and attempts to resolve the unwarranted billing you basically don't respond in a timely fashion or release the funds or refund in a timely fashion. Really professional and well done. Might not recommend this location or chain of hotels to anyone. Avoid the billing nightmare.",4,3,2

50,Barbara B.,"Chantilly, VA",4,64,5,4.0,3/5/2016,"What a great value! Finding a decent hotel in NY  under $200 is basically unheard-of. The fact that this hotel is clean, in a great location, and comes with free WiFi and free breakfast is nothing short of a miracle. We stayed in a renovated room on the 9th floor (after being checked in at midnight by the delightful Charmaine at the front desk). Room had a king bed and a decent amount of space for a NY hotel. Bathroom was very clean and thank goodness, had a vent fan (which I think makes all the difference in keeping the bathroom from smelling musty). Bed is comfy and bed bug free. Breakfast is your standard bland Hampton Inn fare: cereal, oatmeal, make your own waffles, but hey, it's free. Location is awesome - a short walk to shopping, subway, and many great restaurants (just do a Yelp nearby search - a bunch of 4 star eats!) Parking is only $65 a day (a bargain). Three nights with parking has cost me about half of what I would have paid five years ago. I don't know how they're doing it, but keep it up! We'll be back!",2,,

The ""Maintenance"" person on site did not know how to change the batteries...  We were given another room and told that the earliest we could access our belongings was 7 am.  New York is a big city and there are many Hampton Inn hotels in manhattan alone, you mean to tell me there isn't a single person who could figure out how to change the batteries in the door lock? The front desk person was rude, did not provide us with any other options, and gave us both the impression that she wasn't going to take any additional steps to help the situation.  We were not offered toiletries, which would have been nice, considering ours were locked in our room.   At one point while we were waiting in the lobby she asks us to ""watch the desk"" while she personally goes upstairs to help another guest, meanwhile we are still without our room.  We have contact corporate customer service and were told that the hotel provided us with additional accommodations, which should be good enough.  We will not be staying at this location or any other Hilton Brand Hotel in the future.  Lesson learned, don't leave anything important (medications, a small child) in your room... you never know when the batteries will die and you could be locked out.",4,3,1

The staff are very friendly and even offer complimentary ice water in the lobby. Free coffee and tea available 24/7 and many many cute dogs. The fellow hotel guests are not the friendliest and may not be eager to converse with you in the elevator, but it's New York. Another down side regarding elevators that comes to mind is the fact that if the door is closing and you reach your arm in to stop it, the door keeps shutting. With all arm related safety precautions in mind, I am confident that you too will have a safe and pleasant stay at this hotel. Great location with many restaurants and shops down the street, but don't put all your eggs in one basket now, folks. Don't put going to a bakery to get gelato on your NYC bucket list just to have it pushed back on the agenda every day of your trip, then on the last day have your flight delayed then moved back to the original time to realize the bakery on the corner is spontaneously closed in the middle of the day and you won't get the one thing you talked about every day of the trip- but who's keeping track??

53,Erin D.,"Annapolis, MD",9,69,34,5.0,11/17/2012,"Full disclosure, I stayed at this Hampton Inn the weekend before Hurricane Sandy hit. I have no idea what shape the hotel is in now, but considering it's on 23rd street, I heard most of everything below 39th didn't fare well. :-(On that note...I LOVED my stay here. For NYC, my room was spacious (believe me, when it's bigger than the broom closet, that's NYC spacious!), and the room was spotless. I stayed on the 12th floor overlooking...well, believe it or not, another building!  I didn't mind, I wasn't here for the view, I was here to wear myself out walking the mean streets!The staff was SUPER friendly, practically falling over themselves to help me. When I achieved feats of strength I didn't know I had and pulled the curtain rod off the curtain trying to close it for the night, they were absolutely cool about it.  When someone needed real milk for their tea (I happened to be in the breakfast nook also grabbing a cup), they got it for her.  We shared the milk and I returned it to the staff.Breakfast was fantastic. Every morning we were greeted with some version of eggs (omelets, scrambled, etc. and they WERE real eggs!) some kind of side like hash browns, yogurt, fruit, juice, make your own waffles, bagels, toast, you get the idea.  Considering I've had worse breakfasts at other hotels, I thought they were outdoing themselves.  The breakfast area is a bit small, but considering you had a constant rotation of people coming and going, it all worked out. I got a seat every morning with no issue.My last night there, I popped by the breakfast nook for a cup of tea (tea and coffee available at all hours), and they had hot cider out for guests. I had spent the day eating my way through the city with my friends (I kid you not), and the cider was an absolutely lovely way to end the night.What was really fantastic about this location? You're close to THREE different subway stops, so you have a ton of options for getting around the city.I will definitely be spending another trip here.  If you have a Triple-A membership use that to get a deeper discount on your room!  I got my stay for under $1K, which, for as close to the holidays as I'm willing to get in NYC, was a steal!",2,1,

When I walked up to her, No SMILE, the greeting was 'WHAT' from her which it should have been  'Hi, how may I help you'?  For the price I paid for this room I expected a lot better customer service than what I received.

The TV worked well.  Apparently you can get a mini fridge if you ask the front desk as we found out on our last day.  I discovered that fun detail as I was inquiring about my cold shower on my 2nd morning there.  They had some issue with their hot water 2 of my 3 days there.  Not cool.  Now let's talk about that bed.  We were given a king bed without requesting so, my reservation was only for a queen, which we thought was nice. However, the mattress felt like we were sleeping on carpeted concrete.  We slept well our 1st night only because it was new years eve and we had enough drinks that we didn't really notice. However I'm writing this review on my 3rd night at 5 in the morning and I'm actually looking forward to sleeping on my flight back to California.  So they do have tvs with cable including hbo channels and the room was clean.  I point those out to try to be as objective as possible, but I was fairly disappointed overall with my stay.  I could nit pick a few more things about this place, but I was afraid I only noticed them due to my lack of sleeping.  I will leave them for the next poster to point out.  I would not come stay here again even at a discounted rate.",1,,

It is one avenue away from all the great shopping on lower 5th Avenue. And if you're a foodie, even closer to EATALY. The staff was friendly and our room was very clean. Like most, I'm kind of a stickler for cleanliness. I think we were given one or the newer, recently remodeled ones. As with most hotels in NYC (even the fanciest) be prepared that the rooms may be smaller than in other parts of the country. There were four of us and two beds and this was pretty comfortable. I mean, if you're mostly planning on being out and about and mostly using the room to rest and sleep. But again, was decent-sized for NYC and good value. My only two minor kvetches are that when they are working on cleaning the rooms, the elevators can be very slow (think they temporarily shut down one of the two). But not a big deal.

68,Natasha C.,"Downey, CA",43,2,0,5.0,11/8/2015,Seriously one of the best hotels I've stayed at and only because their staff is truly amazing. It was my first time in New York and the ladies at the front desk were so helpful in whatever I asked. It's so close to everything and in the center to points of interest. Walking distance to the Chelsea Market & High Line Park! Two blocks away from the subway station. Not a rowdy street. The hot breakfast in the morning was so great because I went on a school trip and call time was at 7:00am so grabbing a quick bagel or whatever they had downstairs was a plus. Also the freshly baked cookies in the afternoon were something to look forward after walking the cold and rainy streets all day. BRAVO HAMTON INN!,,,
69,Casey D.,"Snohomish, WA",144,14,7,5.0,8/25/2014,"We stayed here when we dropped out daughter off at NYU. The room was snug but well appointed and very clean. The breakfast was standard fare but it was well made, quickly refilled and cleaned by a friendly staff. Speaking of friendly staff, every member of the from desk staff was friendly,  helpful and engaging. We needed a screwdriver to make a mini repair... not only did they provide the screwdriver but the maintenance staffmember assists us. The gym area which our daughter used was small but all the machines we clean and well maintained.  We will use this for our future visits to NYU as it is near campus but also near some wonderful galleries and restaurants in Chelsea.",,,

71,SiliconValleyShoeGirl L.,"Santa Clara, CA",6,139,29,4.0,6/14/2013,"I stayed here using hotel points so I might be a bit biased because no actual money was paid, but I still thought this was a nice hotel overall. The room was clean but not the roomiest, but it's standard Manhattan. The breakfast was quite good, and there is a nice clear-ceiling atrium extension from the main dining room in which you can either soak up some sunshine, or as was for me, listen to and view the storm pounding (there was a flash flood warning). The location was probably one of the biggest draws; Chelsea is wonderful. About 3 short blocks away is a Trader Joe's. Though my room did not have a refrigerator, I understand I could have requested one. I'd definitely stay again if I had plans in the area.",2,,
72,Sam H.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,3.0,12/14/2013,UPDATE:THEY CREDITED ME BACK THE MONEY THEY CHARGED ME. And Management offered me a discount on my next stay.

They actually charged me for my bags (I left them overnight) without my authorization and when I got back to the hotel to discover this they treated me like a criminal in front of other guests. ONE OF THE WORST experiences I ever had. There are a few Hampton Inns in the city do yourself a favor and DON'T opt for this one.,1,,
73,Sarah T.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,239,27,3.0,3/5/2011,"Major construction and not-so-attractive construction workers in the elevators and lobby.But overall, the stay is comfortable and works. The hotel rooms are decently sized for Manhattan. There is ample space to walk around the bed. And at the 19th floor, the view was better than what Tom Hanks saw in the St. James hotel in Big. The subway accessibility is great. Since it hits 23rd St, you are one block from the F train and in the vicinity of the N, R, A, C, & E. The breakfast is a fun addition and has a waffle maker!  But the breakfast-on-the-go bags stink. They just include convenient store things like blueberry muffins and processed cereal bars and water. Not a great way to start the day. But the hotel staff is very nice and the cookies at the front desk are great, provided that they don't burn them.Make sure you call the hotel before booking to make sure construction is not going on. Today, I saw a bunch of drywall crumbs in the elevator and the business center was shut down for two weeks. Blech.",2,2,1

Ideal for the corporate traveler. No complaints. I do want to add that when I got home I was missing a case of CD's from the back of my SUV, that I suspect one of the Valet's may have taken.

No restaurant or pool at this site, no business center per se (but there are a couple PCs where you can print out a boarding pass), and expensive valet parking.

Minutes later, I realized I was too wound up with trying to make the reservation taking sooo long that I couldn't enjoy the stay.  I called the hotel back minutes later and spoke to Jessica, the GM who simply said she wouldn't cancel the reservation I made minutes earlier.  I spent an hour more calling the Times Square Hampton Inn trying to get a regional office / someone above Jessica, but they are franchises and owned by different companies. Then calling Hilton corporate and customer service who then called the hotel and THEN Jessica cancelled the reservation.  I wasted wayyy too much time trying to deal with the hotel.  There's loads of other hotels in the area.  We'll stay at any other than this property.

Eggs, sausage, bacon, tea, a waffle station. We made plans to do brunch because they called it a ""deluxe"" continental breakfast (which I imagined was just extra cereal or something but we ended up eating at the hotel and meeting for lunch) Def makes the room even more of a deal at the rate. -Nice modern clean design. -Small but efficient rooms -If you are on lower floors, ask for an upper floor and city view either way. Remember to fill out your card for complimentary muffins and coffee delivery on the upper concierge floor. -Nice bedding, mattress, TV, and bathroom. Shower only. -Excellent view of the real NYC, not just into Times Square -Very nice location, and surprisingly easy street parking on weekends (we didn't pay a cent) Negatives: -None really, other than the lack of a real lobby, and the concierge wasn't always there, but it was nice -Slower elevator -Bar wasn't open when we where there, only storage for luggage being held for later... Overall, HIGHLY recommended for the price. Clientele is smart, younger crowd, business travelers, and euro-families.",2,,

We rang the hotel twice to just keep them updated that we were on our way but we would arrive later than planned.When we arrived the staff at the hotel were very welcoming. We were a little early for check in so they stored our bags and we went off exploring until our room was ready. Our room was a little on the small side but this wasn't a problem our only requirements were that the rooms were clean and we could get some sleep! Staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was a lovely bonus as I know most hotels in manhattan don't give this option. The little touch of coming back from a days sight seeing to hot apple cider and warm cookies was lovely. Over all it was a great hotel, i would have appreciated a better view but I didn't come to New York to stare out of a hotel window. I would like to mention if we had the room next to the ice dispenser I don't know if this review would have been as positive. We were on the floor with the ice dispenser but at the other side of the lift so It didn't bother us at all.  The neighbourhood itself was very centrally located with subway stops very close! Had some lovely restaurants around and there a few 7elevens and fast food places close by. I didn't feel uncomfortable walking around at night.We would defiantly book this hotel again!",,,

They left a complimentary bottle water & snack when I checked in which was a nice touch.The room comes with a complimentary hot breakfast that changes every morning. While they should come with free wifi, but AT&T had trouble with the infrastructure that week - just bad luck with the timing on my part. So, I didn't really penalize them in the rating for something out of their control.The only concern I have is that you can walk straight to the elevator late at night without being stopped by anyone (doorman, reception, etc). Granted that they may recognize me, but an acknowledgment when walking in would make me feel more secure. While they are in Manhattan, they are on a quiet street with literally no pedestrians walking late at night.",2,,

100,A B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,211,5,4.0,2/10/2010,"I actually got referred to this place by a lovely employee at the Millennium Hilton down in the Financial District. I was unable to return home to DC on a road trip from Boston thanks to a freak blizzard, and rather than bum it out on someone's sofa uptown like I usually do, I wanted some alone time and an actual BED. That being said, with a AAA discount I got a room here about 2 hours before I checked in by phone for less than $100. That's already a win.There's ample street parking (at least at night) but it's NYC, you know you have to wake up early to move your car, and with a checkout time of noon and free breakfast til 10am, who wants to do that? I paid $36 for 13 hours of parking time at the adjacent parking garage, which is really a decent price for the city. I was just tired and it was cold, or else I would have gone out of my way to park for free. It's completely possible.Free wi-fi, my room was clean, free HBO on the flat screen...really not so bad. Hair dryer, iron in room, etc. Pretty decent city views from the upper floors (I was on the 15th). Oh, and the bathrooms have adjustable shower heads! I can't stand low water pressure in hotels, but you could adjust it for a stronger more localized stream of water and everything. Love it. Location is good, although if you're not used to the city you might be creeped out by the silence on the streets at night on this block...this isn't times square, after all.Hungry at 2am? Walk about 6 blocks to Cafeteria, and eat well at any hour of the night. There's also corner stores near by open all night for essentials you might need. Wake up again in the morning to some great shopping. You get everything the city has to offer with less tourists and hustle bustle. Great hotel idea for people in town for business or people who just need a place to rest their head for a night before venturing elsewhere again in the morning.Great value for the price.
