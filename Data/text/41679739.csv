I've gotten an omelette and it seemed very oily. Their orange juice is good, however, and freshly squeezed. I would only come here out of convenience and the good prices.",1,,
1,Michael N.,"New York, NY",59,55,210,5.0,3/18/2017,"What else is there to say?! I come here for lunch everyday not just because it is the only eatery on the block, but because of their high standards for food quality and dedication to customer satisfaction. The salad bar is fast, and most importantly the ingredients are fresh. You have the pretty standard option of 1 protein, 1 cheese, and then an additional 3 veggies. Service could not be friendlier- the people here are really good at what they do.Bagel bar in the morning is sometimes a little crowded, especially if you happen to be in a rush.Furthermore, the cleanliness of this place is almost unfair, but certainly is not overlooked and much appreciated. The owner is there everyday making sure everything is spick and span- he has a keen understanding of what it takes to run a successful eatery.It is going to be tough for any establishment to match the perfectionist customer service I get at Frame on a daily basis. Hectic checkout lines are immediately alleviated by the experts behind the counter who take care of ringing up your order in record times. They are especially good about making NFC payments as well!",2,1,

I looked up the report and there is a laundry list of violations such as cross contamination, mice, bugs, etc. I just can't forget all the things I read and it's unfortunate because I used to visit this place everyday for breakfast and lunch. They guy that makes the Sushi/soups is still smoking and going back inside to prep food and this was one of the things the Dept of health mentioned so I'm sorry but no. Some people don't care and keep on going but, I won't be going back ever!!!!!",2,,

Updated review","Don't let the name confuse you.   Nothing gourmet about it.. just another deli serving average food.   I picked a few items from the buffet area and the food was mediocre.   Some items were bland.   Regardless, I won't be making a pit stop here for lunch again.",,,
6,Paley M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0,2.0,2/28/2018,"My suggestion for Frame is to lose the avocado toast display. The avocado sits out all day and turns into a brown pile of mush and looks completely unappetizing. As an avocado lover who might want to order avocado toast from time to time, this display actually makes me want to do the opposite -- and I know I'm not the only one! Just a small suggestion that might make a big difference!",,,
7,D L.,"New York, NY",0,45,9,4.0,6/25/2018,"This review is based solely on my Seamless orders since I've never stopped by their brick & mortar. I ordered from here easily once a week. Their create-your-own salads are so good and such a steal. Generous portions and fresh ingredients. $6 for a good-sized grilled chicken salad which usually lasted me two meals. The last few times I've ordered they've cancelled because they're ""too busy"". Now they're no longer in my delivery range. I live 4 blocks away and can practically see it from my window. So disappointing, but after reading some negative reviews about being shut down for health concerns, I'm totally grossed out. Also, don't bother with the baked goods by Cheryl Kleinman. Very overpriced for the size.",,,
8,Grossberger V.,"Flushing, NY",0,29,1,2.0,12/22/2017,"Beware. Gourmet prices only. 2 eggs & bacon on a roll ($4.35) are ice cold every day because they prepare everything in advance & let it sit out unheated. Very gross. Coffee carts  outside give you a fresh and hot sandwich made to order at half the price. I would say get it from the breakfast bar, instead because it's heated,  but the bar is $11 per pound. .",,,
9,Irene J.,"Brooklyn, NY",148,57,240,3.0,5/24/2017,"After multiple times in this place (as it is right across from my job) I can honestly say that I hope they will shut down.  The quality has quickly and severely went down (not that it was fantastic to begin with).  I am completely and utterly disgusted and disappointed in the bibimbap (I tend to half of the time get bibimbap because that particular line is short or pretty much non existent compared to other lines in the Frame).  I usually get beef for meat and aside from that beef looking like something out of a scary movie, now it tastes like shit too.  Just now I had to throw away pretty much half of the bibimbap due to the meat being unacceptable to eat.  My coworker friend was eating a soup (also from Korean section) and she said chicken was hard like rubber.  So she also had to get rid of a good portion of the soup as it was inedible.At least if the food was worth the money then fine.  But the quality (particularly of the meat they 'prepare') is utterly atrocious.  You are wasting money on the food you can't eat, don't enjoy and end up being hungry on top of it all (because you had to throw it out).  I understand they have to pay crazy rent and it's tough maintaining a business in this neighborhood, but at least make your establishment decent enough so that the customer will continue to come back.  They are quickly turning them away!",,,

12,Elise W.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",30,10,3,3.0,3/31/2016,"Came here after an interview nearby. Really delicious salad bar. Went with five items - avocado salad, beets, egg salad, salmon, and spinach lentil feta salad. Everything was pretty fresh and well seasoned. Coffee is self-serve Illy, tasted fine. As mentioned by some others, this place can get quite crowded and hectic. Queue for what you want, then queue again for the cashier. This was a little on the pricey side at $13. Would be 4 stars if priced better, and 5 stars if they had more seating options and maybe free wifi (would be nice to have a nice sit down casual lunch option in this area)There's not many options in the area but as all the Hudson Yards projects come to fruition, I'm sure many more amenities and dining options will follow. Some quality competition should bring prices down.",,,

There is a guy standing and staring at everyone by the salad bar to make sure no one takes salad? WTF.....also, they charge $0.50 for kale? Sorry guys.....not good business strategy. If you're already charging $10 for tossed salad and your workers are rude as fcuk that they barely add protein (I constantly have to ask them to add more than just 3 little pieces of chicken)....how the heck are you okay with charging an extra $0.50 for kale? I will obviously be back because I literally work there and I need to eat but I'd rather go elsewhere.",2,,
19,Sarah V.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,2.0,7/13/2016,Staff seems frustrated and annoyed with customers. Guy at salad bar has a bad attitude and so do the guys making the sandwiches. Came in at 11:30am and salad bar wasn't ready. Used to work in midtown where the service is fast and friendly. It seems to me that Frame needs to improve its service if it wants to compete with what will eventually be a hot lunch market giving the influx of buildings and thus new people used to much better service.,2,,

I had never seen this place before and it looked like an interesting place to try.When I got there there was one person ahead of me who wasn't being helped yest by the two people behind the counter as they were busy I guess filling out delivery orders or something. When the person in front of me was being assisted I looked at my sandwich options.  I decided to get the chicken fajita sandwich on flat bread.When I ordered my sandwich it didn't take long to get completed. The chicken was grilled.  I can't be sure about the pieces of red bell peppers- I think they were grilled.  There were no onions in the sandwich. When I think of a fajita I think of peppers and onions. There was also processed American cheese slices on the sandwich, which was not appealing at all on a fajita sandwich and they were barely melted.  The sandwich  also lacked any sort of spice or heat which I expect from a fajita. It was a good sized sandwich for the price, especially considering the area.",1,2,

24,Hilary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",344,361,12,3.0,5/20/2014,"Things I like about Frame:- avocado salad (though it does get picked over during the lunch rush)- their premade sushi and seaweed salad- their iced coffee (you serve yourself so you can get that perfect ice-coffee-cream ratio)- they carry Davidovitch bagels and a variety of cream cheeses in the morning- all the cashier ladies are very pleasantThings I don't like about Frame:- they run out of everything bagels by 9:15 most mornings- the hours posted say they close at 4pm but I sometimes see customers still in there after 5 and am generally confused about when the salad bar shuts down- the prices of the salad bar, Korean food, salads, sandwiches, desserts, etc.- no basic spinach/romaine/spring greens/arugula to add to the premade salads- I paid $2.75 for a single-serve fruit Chobani yesterday. $2.75!

25,Sally C.,"San Francisco, CA",1053,413,245,2.0,2/23/2012,"There really aren't a lot of lunch options all the way out here, so I've gotten to know this place pretty well since I eat here at least once or twice a week. It's not a place I would normally choose to eat at, but it's better than a lot of other places in the area (such as the deli around the corner which we have named the Smelly Deli).It looks nice and more upscale than a lot of the places around the area. There is also a cute sitting area upstairs.Pluses: They carry good red velvet cupcakes, macarons and a wide selection of drinks. They also have decent sushi and udon (I like the veggie dumplings). The prepared foods section is also pretty good and what I usually hit up. They usually have some type of baked salmon which is delicious. Minuses: Several coworkers have found a variety of bugs and other things such as glass in their food before. Which is gross. To be honest, there was a panic about the glass but I'm actually more disturbed by the bugs. Despite these issues, I still eat here, which may or may not say something about me...  The prepared foods is charged by the lb and I've ended up walking out with a $18 lunch  more than once.

My coworkers patron this place everyday, sometimes multiple times a day. We have meetings catered from them often. I see employees almost everyday either inside the place or on the subway or walking to work, and they never smile or say hi. They make it seem like me coming there is a pain and an inconvenience for them. The place is also WAY overpriced. One time they charged me $1 for pad of butter. My coworker needed an onion for a shoot, they charged him $1.50.Although I like the idea of a local restaurant that is not owned by a chain, Id much rather have a friendly mcdonalds across the street than this rude place.",3,1,
31,Stephanie L.,"San Francisco, CA",118,47,41,4.0,10/22/2013,"I was a little worried about lunch options in Midtown West being limited to the McDonald's on the corner and the Starbucks downstairs. Happily, I came across this place on my first day and have been going at least 2x/week. The food is amazingly high quality given the volume they are moving every day, everything is executed surprisingly perfectly (nothing is overcooked or undercooked, everything is well seasoned), with lots of tasty and healthy options, as good or better than what I can make at home. I used to work at Google and the hot buffet reminds me of the Google cafe (except not free, ha). I'm especially a fan of their fish and their avocado and hearts-of-palm prepared salad.  Yes, it's a bit on the pricey side but I will gladly pay them to avoid the trouble of grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning after a healthy, homecooked meal and I actually think the pricing is fair given the quality of the cooking and the ingredients. If you want cheap, head to the corner pizzeria for a limp, greasy slice or a get fat on a super carb-heavy sandwich.I also read a lot of reviews complaining about the service.  I am not sure what people are expecting from a busy take-out food court.  If the people at the registers are brusque it's because they are trying to process orders from dozens of hungry professionals during a very high-volume lunch rush, give them a break!  I notice the management staff is always on hand and seem to be overseeing the operations run smoothly.",1,3,1

36,George G.,"Carteret, NJ",24,546,0,2.0,2/22/2013,"I have had the opportunity to try both the breakfast and lunch here using vouchers.Breakfast: Not sure if the eggs served are from real eggs as they appeared to be too consistent. Ended up getting sunny side up just in case w/ bacon and no cheese. These were put on a fresh bagel which by default is plain so I had to yell at them for a garlic one. Of course I also asked for Canadian bacon but I suppose they were hard of hearing and gave me regular bacon. In either case, I also requested some lettuce and tomato. They charged an extra dollar per sandwich for the real eggs (they gave me 2 on each sandwich) and for the lettuce / tomato.Lunch: Used some vouchers (provided by local training) for various sandwiches during the week. These were OK for the most part. I was quite happy that usually they didnt charge extra for lettuce and tomato but sometimes they added an extra dollar for the grilled veggies. Ended up usually combining vouchers with someone else on training and getting a large miso soup, extra spicy. They simply add red pepper flakes which are finely ground, but the soup is quite good. Another oddity is that one time they provided free chips with the sandwich but another 3 times they did not.They also have a salad bar, which is on the expensive side at around 10$ a pound.The service is a bit poor. Having vouchers for 12$ each, each day I usually spent around 9$ which means they made a good amount of change. One day, I had 13$ and a few cents, but they only let me 'slide' after a few minutes of discussion. This is just poor business practice. They remembered seeing me all week (and they know they made money) and then one day they give a huge hassle over less than 2$.I would go here again if it were free, however, there are definitely other places were I would leave my 8$ or so of lunch money.",1,,

Updated review","One of the better lunch options in Midtown West (in the 30s).  Good salads, nice breakfast bar in the morning and good sandwich options.  The drinks in the refrigerated area are almost never cold, let alone chilled.  They once provided free cups of ice, which was helpful, but now charge 50 cents for it, which is silly as you can get they anywhere else in the neighborhood colder and cheaper.  Odd choice.  Still a good lunch option - just don't get your drinks there.",2,,
47,Samira H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,0,1.0,6/15/2016,"I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN. This is saying a lot since I once purchased a carton of milk from Frame and IT HAD GONE BAD! I work nearby and have frequented this eatery several times. Very $$ for what you get but could give it a pass since the ingredients were (somewhat) fresh. They have a salad special: 1 meat, 1 cheese and 3 vegetables. HOWEVER, if you are a vegetarian, you are NOT ELIGIBLE for this special. Tofu is not considered a meat. Although every other salad bar I've visited will give you an additional vegetable if you are not eating meat, this place charges you per topping, making your MEAT FREE MEAL MORE EXPENSIVE than if I had loaded it up with meat. I took it up with the manager, who had nothing to say other than I cannot have the special unless I order a meat. Ridiculous considering vegetables ARE CHEAPER. You are better off eating from a cart or fasting than dropping HALF YOUR PAYCHECK for a mediocre meal.",1,,

49,Emily B.,"Minneapolis, MN",175,320,98,5.0,6/14/2011,"I wandered in here after spotting their sign for Illy Coffee walking by, and it's safe to say that I am kind of obsessed with this place. I attended a week-long conference at the Javits Center and looked forward to escaping its confines every day to hustle over to Frame for lunch. Frame takes the traditional buffet and hot lunch-style Manhattan cafeteria and ups the ante. It's spotlessly shiny and clean, and they serve fresh, crave-inducing foods ranging from salads to sandwiches to sushi to bibimbap. I was a particular fan of the pre-made salad buffet, which is insane to me because in general I find this to be a horribly gross concept ripe for food poisoning. However, I couldn't help but indulge in the fresh salmon, gently-tossed salads, and original combinations of vegetables. I enjoyed some of the salads so much that I typed their ingredients into my phone and have made a few copies at home since my trip. Frame is pricey for lunch--I didn't make it out of there any day for less than $12--but it's also really nice to go somewhere in such a strange armpit of a neighborhood that serves fresh, healthy food. Frame is a delightful oasis, and if you're ever wedged between Penn Station and Javits, I highly recommend you check it out.",1,,
50,Deborah L.,"Manhattan, NY",59,69,10,2.0,3/4/2011,"I've been walking past this place for about a week on my way to work and today we couldn't resist ordering lunch delivered.  Not being much of a salad girl, nothing much jumped out at me from the menu...until I saw they had bibimbap!I was skeptical about ordering it because usually it is served in a hot stone bowl.  I knew it wasn't going to be the best bibimbap ever, but I did expect a hot meal!  How wrong I was.  When you order the bibimbap, you literally get a styrofoam cup full of white rice and then a massive plastic container full of COLD bibimbap toppings (e.g. all the vegetables and meat).  Also no egg, which makes it pretty much NOT bibimbap by any stretch of the imagination.The flavours were on the bland side but relatively authentic.  I would have been fine with it had everything arrived HOT, or even WARM.  The best part of the lunch was the miso soup, which was a little on the salty side but hot and did not skimp on seaweed and tofu.",1,,
51,Allison L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,6/25/2014,"I work at an office two doors down from this cafe and it is so unfortunate that we are forced to place lunch orders from this place just because there aren't other options around. I just called to place an order and said ""Can I get a large chicken Caesar salad?"" The man on the  phone proceeds to put the phone down, not on hold, and begins making fun of me to his co-worker, telling her ""she just said, 'Can I GET a large chicken Caesar?'  How do you get a salad? Her English is so bad, I honestly fell bad for these people."" He then picks up the phone and proceeds with the order like nothing had ever happened. When I tried to confront him about it, he just ignored me and proceeded with the order. I will NEVER order from here again and I will ensure that anyone I work with never orders another catering order from them again. Absolutely horrible and rude people running this place.",3,,
52,C B.,"New City, NY",0,49,0,2.0,2/4/2015,"Yelp's Price Range feature doesn't tell the whole story.  Frame's prices are ""moderate"" on the Yelp scale, but Frame is still expensive *for what it is*.  I head over to Frame once in a while, by no means often, when I'm in the mood for something different than the usual places.  I always remind myself it's too expensive for what it is, and yet I'm always still annoyed when I pay.  Their food is decent, but I wouldn't rate it much or any better than other similar places in the immediate area.  You just pay more for it, possibly because they bring it in themselves from other places all over the city.",1,,

54,J C.,"New York, NY",2,40,0,5.0,5/26/2010,"In addition to the fresh food, this place has BunnyCakes, the best cupcake I've ever had in Manhattan. And that's saying a lot.I was here for lunch today. Had the udon, which was really tasty, and lunch under $10.00 with a can of soda is pretty good. They serve a nice selection of sushi and sandwiches too, although I've only tried the balsamic marinated chicken. There's also a salad bar, where you can choose your ingredients (they'll even chop it for you), and a selection of pre-made salads and hot entrees. If you get there before two in the afternoon (unfortunately, not always a possibility for me), there's plenty to choose from.But the best part about Frame are the BunnyCakes. They are seriously the most amazing cupcakes I've ever had, and that's really saying something in a city that has almost as many cupcake places as there are Starbucks. The cake is moist and dense, but light. The icing? Rich but not too sweet. This is the only cupcake that suits all the picky eaters I know, of which there are plenty.",1,,2

Updated review","Alright, alright, I have to update my Frame review.  They have much improved since their opening.  The salad bar is wonderful, if still a bit expensive.  The prepared salads always taste super fresh, and they go way beyond your typical Ceasar salad.  Think arugula with artichokes and kidney beans.  The sushi and the sandwiches are par.  I had the quiche once, which was delicious, but way too rich for lunch.  I no longer work nearby, but when I did I was glad that it was nearby to grab a quick, healthy lunch.  Needless to say, my wallet did not feel the same way.",,1,
57,erik h.,"San Francisco, CA",43,49,11,4.0,12/22/2009,"Wow, really? So much hate.Maybe they've improved in the last few months since the majority of these reviews were written. Everything I've eaten from this place has been well above average. There's a great range of options, the staff is friendly, it's very clean, there's a decent size seating area upstairs, and the prices are reasonable all things considered.This is also the best alternative to Starbucks that I've found in the immediate area. The espresso isn't phenomenal, but it's a step up and without the long line.",1,,1

59,Michael B.,"New York, NY",59,35,0,2.0,7/2/2009,"I went here on opening day to check it out. I'd been hearing about it for months, so I was very excited. However, my first survey suggested it was a fine place for lunch, but that it would not stand out. They offer soups, salads, a hot bar, and sandwiches that look about as good as other places in the area and are at about the same price points.THEN! Then I found out they have... bibimbap! (Check it out on Wikipedia, or better yet, get some in K-town. It's AMAZING.)So I ordered some bibimbap today.What I got was NOT bibimbap. It was cold, pre-cooked chicken, mushrooms, and lettuce (lettuce? really?) with white rice and some sort of hot sauce served on the side, all in a plastic salad container. It had a half-cooked egg on top, which looks like it was prepared on a griddle. It was a far cry from the amazing egg of true bibimbap, which gets fully cooked from the heat of the other ingredients and the hot stone bowl in which it is normally served.It was basically a salad. In no way did it resemble bibimbap. Granted, real bibimbap is probably nearly impossible to serve as take-out, but if that's the case, why offer that option at all if it cannot remotely be done?$8 and change later, I'm still hungry, disappointed, and the saladbimbap wasn't even very good under the standard of review for salad.The desserts here are apparently incredible...but they're from Sullivan Street Bakery.",1,1,1
60,Paul h.,"Port Washington, NY",0,34,0,1.0,3/1/2013,I had a chicken parmesan hero that was dry and It was repeating on me for the remaining of day. I think it was past its time.   The salads are ok.  This is the type of place you need to pick and choose what's fresh.,2,,
61,Andrea B.,"Ridgewood, NY",151,24,0,5.0,6/3/2010,"I love this place. Midtown around Penn Station has a pretty bad selection of lunch places, and for only a block out of my way I can get a reasonably priced delicious lunch. Today I'm eating a seafood croquette, steamed spinach, Caesar salad and a tomato and mozzarella salad, all for less than $10.Bistro Marketplace, which is closer to my office, is the go-to if I want something a bit cheaper--Frame is only a tad more expensive--and I don't care if it's not the greatest food. I go out of my way to Frame if I want great food that is obviously prepared fresh!",,,
62,Cynthia L.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",198,574,615,3.0,1/13/2010,"If FRAME wasn't so expensive I might give it one more star.  Before FRAME opened last year lunch usually consisted of me bringing lunch, going to the diner or subway.  I still try to bring my lunch but I know if I forget, I can dash down the block to FRAME for a quick meal or to BISTRO on 34th which opened up around the same time as FRAME.  FRAME has fresh food and has pickles from the Pickle Guys in the LES, bagels from H&H (really good with lox) and bread and or desserts from Sullivian St Bakery.  They have a salad section, soup section, a buffet section $7.99/pound, sandwich section and an Asian section with sushi, udon and really weird bimbimp (see Mike B's review).  I usually stick with udon with shrimp shumai.  With tax it's about $8.50.  The sushi is expensive but they do have a brown rice option and if they don't have what you want they will make it for you.  If you ask for all the toppings it's a very hearty meal for the winter. They also sell random organic-ish food such as freeze dried corn and such.  THese items are all expensive.  They also have flowers and plants for sale which are ridiculously priced.  Additional seating upstairs.",,,
63,Jamie S.,"Philadelphia, PA",169,492,170,3.0,7/3/2009,"The high levels of swank that they have going on with the decor is humorous. Options include salad, soup, sandwiches, drinks, udon, bibimbop, sushi, and baked goods. The by the pound tables are currently low on options, I am sure they will fill them up quickly, but at $7.50 a pound(or $3.50 per half pound as they phrase it) its not cheap. Most exciting to me were the baked goods they get from CeciCela and Sullivan St Bakery. I picked up a chocolate tarte thing made by Sullivan St and it was divine as expected. I noticed a rack of breads that looked very Sullivan Streetlike, and I found out that they were, but for now they are just a tease and display only.

65,Althea A.,"Manhattan, NY",243,704,466,2.0,5/17/2011,"I was all excited about this place when it first opened. A gourmet lunch place, right near where I need to eat lunch? Cool!The first time I went in there, I ordered a chicken 'blue corn tortilla' wrap. It tasted so-so, but the real problem was, it wasn't made with blue corn. It was apparently colored with a LOT of food coloring. In the, uh, end, that made for some truly frightening results.After realizing that I wasn't dying of some bizarre digestive ailment, I swore that it would take a bomb threat to get me back in there.OK, sorry, that's a lie.The truth is, it DID take a bomb threat to get me back in there. This morning I was heading to work, and saw a couple of my coworkers amongst a swarm heading away from the building. They suggested going for coffee while we waited for the police to see if our workplace was going to explode or not.So, I ordered a coffee. And the cashier very rudely informed me that they enforce a credit card minimum. This is one of my pet peeves. Credit card minimums are not legal. If you take credit cards, you are required by your agreement to take them for any amount. I can charge five cents if I want to. Anyway, she was rude about it; I wasn't going to get anything, but my co-worker bought me an iced coffee. You pour it yourself out of a big carafe, which isn't very ""gourmet."" It was fine, if unexceptional.I also noticed that no blue corn tortillas were in evidence. Maybe other people complained.They do have a nice balcony seating area, which is good for people watching, and is getting them a star.And my work building didn't explode, which is nice too.",,2,

75,Joe C.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,4.0,7/4/2009,"I went to this place on the second day of its opening (Tuesday - June 30, 2009). I work at the Daily News/AP building on the same street so I had to give it a try of course. At first glance, the place looks gorgeouse with its unique decor and feel. According to the ""34thstreeteats.com"", the owner of this place is apparently a professor of interior design at FIT who had also designed other delis in NYC, including one that was supposedly filmed in a Julia Robert's movie. Basically, you get the sense this ""deli"" is far from the norm that you see scattered across the city. This place appears to try to portray itself as a more upscale goumet type eatery (as its name implies ""Frame Gourmet Eatery""). The place is laid out very nicely from left to right starting with an ""asian station"" that serves bibimbap (something that's not sold anywhere near this area), sushi, and udon. Then you have the sandwich station where the breads they use appear to be from sullivan street bakery and tom cat after asking one of the workers there. Then you move onto the desserts area, where I think this place wins big. They have baked goods that look soooo delicious and they are also from sullivan st and cecicala. I had purchased a homemade version of a ""twinkie"" which was out of this world! I would buy this again and again only if I were not on a diet (arghh). The other selection of pastries looked fantastic and the counter girl there seemed very knowledgeable of the desserts as she had recommended the twinkie to me. Next you have the ""market table"" area where in the morning they serve a hot breakfast buffet and for lunch they have a hot buffet as well. The market table area also includes a cold salad type section which had a wide variety. I had tried the market table lunch and got the pasta and flank steak with vegatables and the quality of the food was much better than any other buffet bar near by. Then you move onto the ""bagel / bread station"" where they have hand made bagels and H&H bagels too. I forgot to mention that this place also serves illy coffee which was very very good. Try the cappucino which tasted great.  In that area of town, there's not much of a selection near the building, so I think this place maybe my new breakfast/lunch spot so long as the food continues to be good. The only cons to this place was that they had limited seating.",,,
