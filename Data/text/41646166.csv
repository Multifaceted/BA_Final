2,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",252,578,74,2.0,9/10/2018,"I was in the East Village thinking about neighborhood transformation and how this thriving immigrant community and center of the tenement movement (outside Chicago, of course, s/o Jane Addams) had now become a hub for fashionistas and tastemaker/influencer types. Not necessarily a bad thing: they've always been perfectly civil and nice to me, but just a jarring juxtaposition from what the neighborhood once was to what it is now.Anyway, I entered Mikey's Burger late at night aware of the polarizing reviews here. A lot of bimodal action: either you love this place or think it's pretty bad. I'm going to go with ""pretty bad."" Burger bun looks like wonder bread that clearly came off a bodega or supermarket shelf somewhere. Chili is definitely certified fresh. You see them making it right in front of you. But that doesn't mean it's good. Too heavy on the beans, too little blending of the ground beef with the rest. It doesn't taste like a unified whole. Nothing inspiring done with the beef, which didn't taste amazing. The place is dirty and not in a ""divey kitsch"" type way. Stay away, especially with strong burger options emerging in the city.",3,2,1

We like the Burger's and Chile chesse fries, so we try to make time to come here all the way from Queens and Brooklyn. But last night was a horrible experience. We put our orders, as we are waiting in the back, There is alot  of FLIES around, my friend points out he also saw a COCKROACH by the cash register. We continue talking about posting this on Yelp and our thoughts. And as we wait, ""I point out that good thing I didn't see a rats"", and low and behold, a mouse walks across the floor from the cash register to the stairs, just as I was thinking it. It is crazy. If a mouse walks about in a well lite area, it's most likely the rat has a disease or there are alot of them in the establishment and they are used to humans. I couldn't eat after that. I waited for the place to be empty to point it out to the cashier, and cook. And I was very professional about it. I let them know that I like the food but after what I saw I would not be coming back again. The guys didn't seem to surprised. I was flabbergasted. PEOPLE STAY AWAY!! I'm sorry Mikey's burger, but you need to step up!! And I say that respectfully as a consumer, I understand no one is perfect, so I expect you guys to get your act together before you are reported to the NYC Department of health!!",2,,2

Then we had an order of cheese fries with some spicy mayo on the side oh yasss they were good oh so good. the only sucky thing was when we got to the bottom of plate and saw how much oil was there... The burgers were good we had the standard cheeseburgers next time i would wanna try the (nfl burger?) i heard good things about it.BUT A MUST TRY is the bacon hot dog! it has avocado and kewpie mayo which makes it a perfect combo. if you in the area check it out!",2,1,2

It was about 11:30pm and I couldn't find a burger spot open, I heard about Mikey's but never gave it a try until I was hungry and in desperate need to fill my burger craving. Seating is small with some tables in the back and a bar seating right in front of the grill. I ordered a regular cheeseburger with bacon and cheese fries which by the way was a very generous portion enough for 2/3 people. Their was definitely lots of grease in that burger but man did it hit the SPOT! I don't know it was but I finished the entire burger which is kind of rare for me because I get full pretty fast. It was exactly what I needed. So don't come here with some 5 star restaurant standards because it isn't the place.",,,
21,Erin E.,"Boston, MA",318,259,9,1.0,3/23/2017,"Went here last night and had a pretty garbage experience.It was nearly empty but for a manager type person and his absolutely blazed-out-of-his-brain cook.  We sit at the bar, the manager gruffly tells us to come wait in line and order with him.  A little weird as he has an iPad to manage orders and could clearly come over to us to take our orders, but OK.  The manager asks if I intend to add gratuity to my $10 order (this is the first thing he's said to me - 0 pleasantry or chitchat), which I do, kind of awkwardly as he stares at me.We sit back at the bar and watch, initially with amusement, and then with increasingly hanger-filled crankiness, as the aforementioned extra from Dazed & Confused struggles to stay upright at the grill.  He keeps adding burgers, moving them to the side, and starting over.  Finally, he gets himself together enough to produce my dining companions' two burgers and french fries.  The manager delivers the order, asking if I am still waiting for a hot dog, which I am.  Fifteen minutes pass as Cheech, or perhaps Chong, continues his hamburger pileup with nary a 'dog in site.Eventually, my friends have finished their meals, and I make my way over to the manager and ask - politely, I swear!  I have 5 stars on Uber and try to be a friendly and understanding person! - what's happened to my hot dog.  He IMMEDIATELY blows up at me and says I don't understand how restaurants work (??) and that I am being unreasonable.  After some investigation and arguing, he actually finds my hot dog, abandoned in its own version of the hamburger pileup.  Goodness.The hot dog itself was actually pretty tasty, wrapped in bacon and with fresh avocado on top, but 100% not worth getting yelled at for no reason.  Avoid this place.",18,14,15

It wasn't that tough, we were just being picky and had my 16 yo nephew with us. We fell into Mikey's Burger, because the hubby really wanted a hot dog and I was being a sport. A cheeseburger is always a good idea at 1am too. The hubby got the shine dog and I got a cheeseburger to split with my nephew. Hubby loved his hot dog. I'm not sure exactly what toppings were on it, but they included jalapeños, pickles, and onions. The cheeseburger was good. Tasted like a good ol' American cheeseburger.

I pass by in cabs and see the flocks of people eating. I've walked pass and seen how congested it gets. I still hear people mentioning Mikey's Burger and I finally went. Such a nice and eager to please host, grant it it was about 3:20am. I heard of this burger, so I wanted to double it up with bacon. Well done, of course. And paired it up with fries. The burger was great. There was a sorta subtle flavor going on. I'm so glad I doubled it and got the bacon as the patties are just about 4 oz. And the fries were fries. The size of 2 shoestring fries put together and cut/fried with the skin on. It was not really packed at the time I went so I got my order pretty quickly.

The burgers are really fucking good.The cheese fries are dangerously addictive.One star for not being crowded on a Friday night: got in, grabbed a stool at the bar, and enjoyed the cook prepare our perfectly cooked and wonderfully delicious burgers in front of our eyes.One star for the people who work here and their great taste in music: sold school '90s hip hop, from Biggie to Dr. Drew, from Pharcyde to Tupac.youtube.com/watch?v=QjsP…One star for reminding me how I miss hanging out in the LES.

We noticed several burgers in the grill that were not veggie. I asked the cook was the veggie burger on the grill yet. He snooty replies by just nodding his head and pointing to a burger about 4"" away from the others. We're not pleased so to keep from complaining, I ask him if he is going to use a different spatula for it. Again, another snooty reply of yes.... He kept looking at us, I think to see if we were watching. He finally picks us a scrapper and only scrapes the spatula and then turns over the veggie patty with the same spatula that was used with the meat. We are now disgusted! I mention to him that he used the spatula that was just used on the meat. He immediately starts speaking Spanish out loud. Which was very rude. We asked the cashier if we could have a refund. The grill guy was so upset, he again speaks out loud in Spanish and then throws the veggie burger in the trash. The cashier walks over and hands my Neice her money. We politely and humbly thank her. She keeps her head down with a frown of anger as well and does not respond. I don't plan to ever return although I love veggie burgers and I'm staying at the hotel right across the street. I wanted to share this info with someone in hopes to teach your employees how to handle these types of situations. Common sense was not used and then to top it off, rude service. You should never cook a veggie burger on the grill with meat. At least ask and then clean the area where the veggie item will go. Use different utensils and change your gloves and wash your hands after picking up raw meat. He did so many things wrong and I'm surprised no one has gotten sick from all the cross contamination.",2,3,1

They even have a great variety of smoothies as well.The burger spot is in an area where a burger will run you 15$ easy. The nearest competition is at 10$. Burgers here run for 6.50$. A noticeable reduction when you factor two burgers at 13$ vs one burger at 15$.Quality and taste are also very good. The burger lacks any ""cool items"" it comes with no condiments (but they have just about all the standard sauces available if you ask). They have standard greens (onion, lettuce, tomato) you won't find any special organic Japanese mushrooms here. The service is exceptional, where I've waited a full ten - fifteen minutes for a single burger, this place will have it served in about 3. Shakes at 6$ are better than others near by with flavors like sesame, peanut butter cup,  black & white etc... Would recommend for a burger over any other place in the area. Would also recommend for a shake over any other place in the area. Good for a lone lunch or a group get together.",1,1,1

Updated review","So I finally got to dine in and my experience was slightly disappointing. I ordered the BLT burger which was juicy. But I don't know... I wonder if I would have liked it so much without the sauces I put on. Moreover, the burger was a lot smaller than I remember. I probably got a double burger the last time so I guess that explains that. Overall, it was a decent burger but not what I expected/remembered.There is this simplicity to this place that I am fond of so if I am in the area I will return.

Burger: I had the double cheese burger with bacon and fries, my boyfriend had the fish burger with cheese fries. My burger was amazing, very juicy and flavorful. My boyfriends fish burger was great too, tender and flavorful. Missed out delivery: They forgot to include the cheese fries with our order, by the time they re-delivered the cheese fries, it was sauggy and unpleasant.

During one of the rare times that I did actually manage to get someone on the phone, he was extremely defensive and said it was out of his hands and there was nothing he could do about it. He claimed he ""wasn't trying to be a dick"" as he berated me for calling to find out where my two-hour-old burger was.This food was NOT worth the wait.

The chili cheese fries were meh, but I take blame for it since it was a pick up order and it was probably soaking up all the liquids. I'm sure they'd be just as good if I had them fresh.

60,Ataru N.,"Hesperia, CA",10,373,181,3.0,10/12/2016,"Passed this place so many times, finally decided to try it! The verdict: okay food, dirty ambiance, surprisingly good service. Not a terrible greasy spoon burger. Not great either, but I am kind of a huge burger snob. I guess I'm kind of a huge [insert any kind of food] snob, I must confess.Anyway, this is not a gourmet burger but it holds its own against any kind of fast casual step-up-from-fast-food food. However, I didn't think the corned beef tasted like corned beef; in fact I wasn't sure what those grey flat chips on the burger were. I finally figured out - by process of elimination, NOT taste -  that this was the corned beef. It's also topped with grilled onions that didn't really taste like anything, mustard, and a piece of lettuce. The bun is just a potato bun from the store or something.The patty was cooked well-done, which is not my preference, but they didn't ask so I assumed they only cook it the one way. But it still managed to be moist and juicy (though the moisture was more grease than juice, tbh). I didn't find the food either too bland or too salty, but the flavor wasn't out of this world either.Like others, I felt the Mikey burger ($6.50) was a bit small. The gentleman sitting next to us had the right idea - his double burger ($12) looked like a more reasonable amount of food.The chili cheese fries ($8), on the other hand, were total overkill in terms of portion. As the food arrived I then understood how the fries were more expensive than the burger. These were not amazing chili cheese fries but they were okay and included a lot of ground beef bang for your buck. The fries were soggy (but of course they were soggy: they had a pound of chili and cheese poured all over them), which is fine with me because I like them that way.The place was a filthy, don't-wanna-touch-anything, flies-all-over-the-place kind of place, but based on all the negative delivery reviews I think eating in is still the way to go. I did not dare try the bathroom. I'd rather pee-pee dance wee wee wee all the way home than crack that door, thankyouverymuch.There was much better service than I was expecting: they brought the food to our table (burger and fries at the same time, no staggered service like others complained about) when I was expecting this to be the kind of place where they yell and you come get it yourself. And then when we couldn't finish the fries and wanted a cover to the container, they not only covered it themselves (right away, no bullshit waiting for no reason like at Master Bao - phrasing), but they also put it into a paper bag with forks and napkins as if it were a to-go order from the get-go. I was astonished. I felt a little bad that we had only tipped 2 bucks on 15, thinking it wasn't a sit-down place and assuming there was going to be little to no service involved.And finally, as my husband and I got up to leave, the gentleman next to us smiled (and not in a creepy and leering way at me) and said ""See ya!"" which was unexpected. I hope he was a regular because he was a sweetheart.I probably would not go out of my way to come here if I did not live here but I might be back to try the hot dog or get a double burger, and will adjust my rating if my next few visits go as well or better.",2,2,

I order from Seamless and they refuse to bring my order to my door because of the building I live in. I have never had this problem before with Mikey.  I explained this was not noted on their restaurant page and I did not have child care to come downstairs to obtain my very small order. It was about 10 minutes later they again called to say they will not bring up the food and will cancel my order.UNBELIEVABLE! I cannot and will not support a company that discriminates against their diners. I hope you think twice about supporting this business morals :(,8,9,8

Mikey's does tons of business from dive bars: Iggy's Keltic and Local 138 because both bars are footsteps away (you can also order delivery to each bar? LAZY! lol)  PRO TIP: both Local 138 and Iggy's Keltic allows you to bring in food from Mikey's as long you bus your table at each bar aka cleanup!their cheese fries though? AMAZING post-booze eats. a meal served in a metallic container with a plastic roof, which transports a pile of  hot fries drowning in cheddar cheese to your mouth and gut...is truly a caravan of carby, dairy heaven! pairs with PBR tallboys so well.the shakes are extra thick n take you back to a time when blood sugar levels weren't important aka childhood. i keep my flavor profiles of delish dairy death simple: either chocolate or vanilla. both of which are excellent.  there a ton of sauce at Mikey's for your burgers, fries and hotdogs...tons to choose from. my friends who ordered the lamb burger sweared by it and the wings. Mikey's is not a sit, eat and camp place. it's pretty small, distressed out, and not fancy. you need turnover and give up your seats in a normal amount of time. don't be those people that camp while a line builds of hungry drunks who need to sit. sides with so many bars on Ludlow allowing you to bring in Mikey's...just enjoy your guilty eats with some brews or booze. support local LES businesses, SON!be good to the folks at Mikey...they are a Ludlow institution in the making. :)drops mic so i can handle these cheese fries while this pint of Guinness handles me.

You never press down on a burger it is a no no, the juice and flavor are expanding as the meat gets hotter. The burger was greasy really greasy so they use a lot of fat in the beef mixture maybe thats why he was pressing down.

Redeemed for a free fries to go w/ the one part of the lunch special -- this one was fresher and much better (and larger, as it was supposed to be a delivery for a regular that was re-routed my way after clearing up some kitchen confusion). Note that their Belly rewards get worse as you go*, so cash out early.*POINTS REWARDS AT MIKEY'S BURGERS - LOWER EAST SIDE10 Wash It Down - Drink With Your Meal Between 2-4pm10 Fry It Up - Fries On Us25 Shake It Up With A Complimentary Milkshake50 We Got Lunch - Burger And A Soda75 Get Your Mikey's T On - Mikey's Burger T-Shirt100 You Choose The Tunes - Pick The Pandora ChannelTransaction Amount $10.00Credit Applied -- $10.00",1,,

The cheeseburger is a little better than what you would expect for a hole in the wall, however, the fries were very soggy. They do provide several options for dipping sauces which was an added bonus. The server/hostess was less than enthused to do anything that resembled her job. She made us wait till she finished talking with her friends to acknowledge that there were actual customers in the restaurant, rolled her eyes while we were ordering and was overall rude. I really hope she was having a bad day and this is not how this place normally treats their customers.",3,3,3

My friend wanted a burger place so we looked on our yelp phone app. Mikey's Burger showed up as a viable option. You order your food through the owner who was working the cash register or through the cooks behind the counter. You should definitely do the chili cheese fries in addition to your burger. My friend had the regular burger and said it was good.  The fries needed some salt so don't hesitate to ask the cooks for a salt shaker. In addition to the regular milk shakes, they had a shake for Vietnamese coffee. I will definitely try it next time.",1,,1
104,Carol B.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",389,822,141,2.0,9/23/2013,"As I am sure that you're all aware, we recently celebrated National Cheeseburger Day. That said, my co-workers and I were in desperate need of an establishment to sling us patties of grilled beef stacked with melted cheeses.Mikey's was the answer.We arrived to find the place empty at lunch time. They quickly took our orders (most of us got the lunch special -- $9 for a burger, fries and beverage. We each tacked on an extra buck for chz) and then we took seats in the back.Interesting vibes in this place. They play lots of band boy tunes (think Maroon 5, Coldplay) and have old concert tickets decorating the walls. There was also a pretty large poster of a woman scantily clad and standing in the middle of a street. If I was a male and owned a quick eats burger joint, it would probably be a lot like this (all killer, no filler).It took a while for our burgers to come out. Like more than 10 minutes. The fries were also staggered, which I really hate (my pal finished her burger and didn't get her cheese fries until about 10 minutes later). The burgers were good, not amazing. I'd say a tad better than Wendy's/Burger King. They don't ask what temperature you'd like it cooked, and I'd probably be a tad uncomfortable getting anything other than well-done from this place. Mine was pretty juicy, but also pretty greasy (as if they had patted down the bun with the greasy spatula).The fries were extremely tasty. Very thin and just the right amount of salt. The portion of cheese fries was monstrous. Please plan on splitting these with a friend.So, all in all...better than Shake Shack? NO.Better than McDo's? Probably.Take your pick.",1,,1

Real potatoes but like all natural potato fries DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO BE CRISPY. They will be soft ans soggy after about 10 minutes out of the fryer. If you ever make fries at home, you'll know those crispy restaurant fries that stay crispy for awhile are not all potato - they add a lot of extra stuff to get the crispiness in there.",,,

108,Michael I.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",104,57,55,4.0,1/15/2015,Mikey's burgers are a staple in the lower east side.

Their prices are very reasonable.Their bathroom is definitely a piece of work so make sure you pop in there. You were planning to wash your hands before eating the burger right?,4,3,4
109,Pereless A.,"Forest Hills, NY",425,10,0,5.0,1/12/2016,"Let's just say.....I am going to explain how to order the best burger!!! First, grab your laptop and lay in your bed. Open your browser to seamless and search Mikey's Burger. Once, you find Mikey's menu....click on it and order: A cheese burger with: cheddar cheese, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and onion. (Bacon must be on burger. It is the deal breaker!) Click the temperature to be medium. For you risk takers, medium rare is a very good option too. Once that is complete, scroll down and order regular fries. You don't need one of their milkshakes! Only, if you had a really bad week and need to unleash, but otherwise just take it easy! (Once the seamless ball texts you that your food is being prepared!) THE MAGIC IS HAPPENING. You better move from your bed to your couch and make sure you have your drinks and tv ready to go. (Delivery is very fast.) Once, that burger arrives there is no turning back and you will devour it. Almost, contemplating a second, because IT'S THAT GOOD! Seriously, the potato bun is a childhood delicacy Mikey's always has fresh! The Potato bun perfectly sucks all the juices from the burger. Making each bite savory goodness. Only thing is the fry situation people! They get soggy quickly, but it doesn't even matter since the burger is yummmm!! I have found a solution if I'm not too lazy. I will turn my oven on high so when the order comes I will stick the fries on a baking pan in the oven for a few minutes. It definitely helps, but I think it is the quality of the fries used. Anyway, let's not get into that....just go order your burger!!!!!",3,5,3

Yes, they're located right in the center of all the bars and can get busy with all those late night munchies kicking in, but for the price, the size of the burger and the taste of the burger, it isn't worth it.He had the Mikey burger and i had the lamb burger. My lamb burger was decent, his was alright, but for $8 a burger and $8 chilli cheese fries, this place is a waste. Not to mention that if you check in on yelp, depending on who you ask, you'll receive the 20% discount. Convenient yes, worth it, no.",2,,

I never write Yelp reviews, but I felt it necessary that people know about this because it could affect their health. I have passed by this place many times. I finally decided to go tonight because I was craving some good fries. I was APPALLED by the lack of food safety precautions taken by the cook. He was wearing gloves, picked up the raw burger patties from the drawer, and placed them on the grill. Without changing his gloves, he then proceeded to touch EVERYTHING else with the raw meat still on his hands. I'm talking burger buns, all the raw burgers condiments, sticking his hand in a bucket of cheese, sticking his hand in a bowl of salt that he used to season the already cooked fries, etc. I feel that people should be aware of this because it is definitely a health violation and could make people sick.

Updated review","Maaaaaan this place has declined. Get it together. Jesus loueezus. I ordered the lamburger and it was salty as FUCK. Overdone to the point that it was like eating a sand and salt shit omelette. Not to mention they didn't even get the order right. I don't know what's going on over there but they also literally delivered more ketchup than burger meat. That's not an exaggeration. Literally meaning literally in the very real and accurate sense. More ketchup than burger. I mean...how? I call back to tell them they screwed up the order and over cooked the burgers anyway (I'd ordered two of them) and could they please just send regular beef burgers, medium rare, with a couple toppings. The guy came pretty quickly with one burger. One. Not two like the order we discussed on the phone that the girl was reading back to me that clearly said two burgers. Holy fuckin stupid. I'm not even mad. I'm amazed. I'm embarrassed for you. How do you fuck up that bad and not think it's maybe a good idea to retain some of your business and throw in a soda or something? Maybe a sincere apology? Maybe a coupon? Maybe anything aside from trying to explain it away when I call you. God damn. Well, I'm hoping you'll correct whatever mistakes made all this happen, but I'm done with Mikey's. If you can fuck that up that bad there's no reason anyone should be trusting you all to prepare food that is going in anyone's body. Seriously, how do you screw up that bad unless you are completely high? If you can mess up a simple burger order that was placed ON LINE, that is to say an order you couldn't even make the excuse was misunderstood for lack of clarity, how could anyone assume you are equipped to face the more complicated and more important challenges that have an effect on the customers like running a clean kitchen? You turned a one-time loyal customer and fan into someone looking for a better burger joint.",1,2,

125,Shawn C.,"Williamsburg - North Side, Brooklyn, NY",296,299,202,4.0,10/16/2012,"I LOVE THIS PLACE!There is a bit of a problem, though. Okay, it's a serious problem. I have only been here when I am completely and utterly wasted. I understand that in those circumstances, anything may taste good - BUT! I remember being unsatisfied with a Five Guys edging on the brink of being destroyed. So, I think my experience, drunken as it may be, is enough to correctly attest to the greatness of this little burger joint.I'm PRETTY sure it's 24 hours. If not, then at least it is on the weekends. I'm not 100% positive about this. But I've rolled in as late as 4 or 5 AM and they were still plugging away. Tons of people here too, so I know it ain't no secret. I just never bothered to ask.Anyway, let's get to the real stuff. The burgers? Insanely good. You will be demolishing these suckers as soon as you get them. They cook 'em to order, come out fresh & juicy and all the ingredients you decide to plop on that sucker. Of course, you aren't just going to get a burger - you're going to grab some fries with that too. And the fries are the second best part. As soon as you're done with that burger, your whole thing of fries is going to disappear. Because believe me, they are as finger lickin' good as finger lickin' good can get. And that's pretty damn good.The line always goes out the door when I get here, but it moves just fast enough. You're gonna be waiting, though. Trust me. Be prepared to put a good 20 minutes in or so if there's a crowd around - and if it's a late weekend night, trust me, there's gonna be a crowd. Cause everyone wants those burgers. It's not just you.The people there are super nice. I've been thanked numerous times just for showing up. I love you guys too!Highly recommended.

127,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1318,10947,4.0,7/8/2014,"Mikey's Burger is pretty fantastic. Especially if your friend leaves you chillin' in a bar by yourself for a half hour to forty-five minutes and you don't know where the hell he went and he eventually comes back with a million and one lame excuses and had ""people"" to call and you just wanted to eat because you were starving and ended up at Iggy's with a vat of cheese fries and various sauces. SAUCES. That was also the world's longest run on sentence, ladies and gentlemen. The space inside is super small. They have a bar stool area for eating. But it just always seems more convenient to take that and go next door for a $2 pbr. Not kidding on those prices. I've had a regular cheese burger, a Mikey's burger: corned beef and hash, onions, pickles and mustard. They also have lamb burgers, turkey, and veggie with wasabi. Interesting options. Cheese fries are enormous and they make it with actual cheddar cheese. Their SAUCES: They don't just dump you with ketchup, but also bbq sauce, and a ketchup-mayo mixture (Puerto Rican sauce). A variety of milkshakes that I think I tried a friend's black/white once and it was insanely thick and good. You can't really go wrong with anything from here and if you haven't eaten anything all day and you are insanely pissed, cheese fries are the best thing on EARTH.",3,1,1

(Disappointed cos it looked really good w ground beef, beans, cheese and my favorite--jalepenos!!!) i hope they fix it and make it less saltier! The hot wings were just the right taste but i thought it fell between not being crispy and not being juicy/tender. The service was only okay becos we had to get up several times to get condiments (they were not conveniently located on the very few tables they had for some odd reason) and there is almost like NO waiter service becos u hafto get up to get ur own drinks and utensils.

My fiancee and I went out for drinks a few months ago, and of course the ""I've had a few glasses of wine"" hunger hit, so we searched Yelp and found this.FOOD: solid and just the right amount of grease. Fairly typical burgers and fries. I had nothing to complain about.PRICES: I remember this being pretty cheap all things considered for the LES. It wasn't super cheap, but I'd put the prices here to be in between fast food and pub type prices.AMBIANCE: so, it's pretty grimy in here and it's probably better to grab your food and go, but we sat at the counter to consume our food. Not too bad, but this isn't really the place you'd want to come for a sit down meal. Again, its primary purpose is to satisfy your post night out hunger.SERVICE: quick and painless.If I'm in the neighborhood and require some grease to balance out the alcohol, I'd pay Mikey's a visit again.

My suggestion (strictly with regard to delivery) would be to reach out to customers and let them know that there are delays and to offer freebies. And when the food arrives, it should be warm.

152,Kurt Q.,"ASTORIA, NY",40,186,5,3.0,10/10/2013,"Well, it's not ""Michael's"" and it's not ""Mike's"" -- it's somewhere in the middle, and so is their food.I think they're trying to have the best of both worlds here. They charge high prices ($7 average for a hamburger w/ their ""special mustard,"" corned beef, and hash), and yet the ambience here is borderline scuzzy. Their atmosphere doesn't match the menu prices. Further, their food quality doesn't match the surrounding Lower East Side standard. So there's a lot of mismatching here that puts a Yelp reviewer into a frenzy.I ordered their signature burger. It was somewhere between ""something different"" and ""good.""Watch your step as you go into their graffitied bathroom because there is no sign indicating the tiny step. You won't twist your ankle because the step is nominal, but if your date is watching you enter the bathroom, you could have an embarrassing little jolt. A bit more about the environment here: It's a constantly negating process. The sign outside makes you think it's gentrified, and the menu confirms that. But as you sit down at their diner style counter-seating, you'll notice that the railroad layout is confining. For example the diner seating and the backroom dining area is cut in half by what looks like an office (the bald owner has his bills strewn about, his laptop, etc.). There's also not a lot of attention given to detail here; they have two shelving units near the front door, which displays year-old health certificates in frames. Someone needs to tell him to put a potted cactus there or something -- this is the Lower East Side.",1,,1

156,Jeremy S.,"New York, NY",23,42,0,1.0,3/10/2013,"We didn't like Mikey's. Here's why:It tasted like there wasn't a grain of salt on anything. If you take a piece of meat and you don't put any seasoning on it, it kinda tastes like the bottom of a shoe.I got the 'BLT' and my girlfriend got the 'Lamb' burger, and they both tasted like the bottom of the same shoe. There was no difference whatsoever in the taste between the two shoes. They were both cooked to death.The lamb burger was supposed to have peanut sauce on it. Still looking for that.The ""chinese bacon"" was kinda cool, but the whole package was more or less flavorless, You can't put chinese bacon on a shoe and sell it to someone for $7.50. You just can't.The fries were aight - if you like In N Out fries these are fine for you. Solid vessel for the chipotle mayo - which was the only thing we tasted there that was remotely decent.In sum, if you're down to drench whatever piece of shoe/bread/fry someone throws at you into perfectly average chipotle mayo, then you will more or less tolerate Mikey's. If you think that's a BS way to approach a meal (which we retrospectively do), then there are better options out there.We live 1.5 blocks from Mikey's and we will never go back or recommend that anybody else tries it. McDonald's is honestly a reasonable alternative (read: I vowed 10 years ago never to eat at McD's again).",3,2,1

190,Henry T.,"San Diego, CA",149,537,37,3.0,1/14/2011,"We didn't do much until dinner, which was at this place called Mikey's down the street. Burger joint. Had a ""Mikey's"" burger, which is basically a cheeseburger with hash and onions on it. Bun was soft, burger leaked and fell apart while eating it, and the bun tasted somewhat synthetic, though that might've been from the hash. The fries were really salty. The chili cheese fries were much more preferable because the chili covered the over-saltiness. The best part of the meal was the black cherry float, which was like a cherry vanilla parfait. Really good.As for the atmosphere? Can't really complain. The place is tiny, but the seating has a bunch of diner-like stools except for the back, which has seating with backs. There's very little space to move anywhere and there wasn't a place to put my coat unless it was at the end of the bar table. Also, the place played more classic rock, which was an interesting choice for a tiny diner.",,,

Updated review","I love how this place is still open at like past 4 am or so.N kept asking for meatballs, but since Wolfnights were out - we came here for some meat, but no balls.N just got the Hot Dog and T and I got the Cheeseburger and we all shared the Chili Fries.Sigh - I felt disgusting eating all these greasy food and past my standard eating time, but damn it - it is fulfilling on a late/early Saturday/Sunday time.",1,,1
193,Michelle L.,"Los Angeles, CA",216,192,22,2.0,8/10/2012,I'm not gonna lie. Someone told me these would be the best cheese fries of my life.Falsseeeeeeee -- good because of the various condiments open for choosing. Bad because the cheese fries tasted like mickey dee's value menu with melted convectional cheddar cheese from the Sam's clubMikey's I hate you,1,1,
194,Holly S.,"Atlanta, GA",6,15,4,5.0,11/11/2014,"Maybe it was the burger...maybe it was the service....but my experience(s) at Mikey's have always been phenomenal. The guys always let me stay past closing to finish chowing down and because I'm the only person in there who actually talks to them, they always hook it up with a free milkshake. I'd say the Mikey's burger is hands down one of my favorite burgers of all time.",,1,

196,Robert N.,"New York, NY",343,225,30,3.0,2/10/2013,"Amazing sesame milkshake! The caramel was a great touch. I can't wait to try the other shakes!I also ordered the lamb burger (it was okay), turkey burger (bland and a bit dry), regular burger (nothing special), and the fries (pretty good, not as oily and salty as mentioned in earlier reviews).Tip: Use the 50% off (up to $5) from Scout Mob.",,,
197,E W.,"Brooklyn, NY",304,310,43,3.0,3/26/2012,"Yeah we ordered Mikey's while linsanity was in effect... Fries soggy yet yummy - impressive combo, I know. They were shoestring, and cooked to darkness so that compensated for the inevitable texture of delivered fried goods. Burger laughably ordered medium rare but this ain't the kinda joint to deviate... Cheese was nice, orange, melty American cheese. Onions sliced too thickLY (yeah i know that bitch 'grammar' and sometimes i use her, sometimes i dont (see?)). White onions = RAWWWW (just wanted to say that). Surprisingly fresh, taut bright green lettuce leaf adorned this otherwise-budget seeming stack of dinner. ~NO PICKLES~ Thankfully (shudder). All in all, an OK burger and fry combo helped 10K X by the spicy mayo, for two, all for $20 ($16.50+tip).Walked by the other night and saw the inside, which was just a burger bar, basically. Felt very sort of... I dunno! NY'y and sweet! Like, simple and cool and copping off the 'bygone era days' look without being cheesy or overtly inauthentic. So if I were to eat there I bet I'd up it a star. Plus, it was dark - JUST LIKE A BAR. Except for pounding burgers not beer. BRILLIANT.",1,1,2
