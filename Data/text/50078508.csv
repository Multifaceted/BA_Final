0,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,293,616,4.0,9/23/2018,"A friend suggested we come here for drinks and apps, and I'm so happy we did. Yes, there are a ton of mixed reviews about the prices and the service being snobby, but if you look past that, you can have a great experience here. You're paying not only for great bites, but a pretty unbelievable ambiance. Just make sure you have reservations if you'd like to sit away from the crowded bar of 20 somethings.To start, we all ordered drinks. Since I'm usually not a fan of super sweet cocktails, I went with the High Tea - tequila, hibiscus, soda water, and lemon. Beautiful presentation and very good. Refreshing.My friends ordered a bunch of small plates to share which was a good idea. Here's what we got:The Grilled Avocado - perfect umami flavors. Grilled to perfection with ponzu and almonds. I can't wait to try to make this at home. Delicious and unique.The Watermelon Tomato Salad - sweet and savory, and packed with a super spicy kick.The Ceviche - I believe this was Snapper, with a ton of mixed berries and pomegranate. Such an interesting combination. One of the best bites of the evening. This isn't featured on the smaller menu so I'm not exactly what this was called.Guacamole with Jicama and Pumpkin Seeds - served with large tortilla chips and great for sharing. Pricey for the portion.Sashimi app - not finding this on the menu either so it must have been on the specials. Served with guacamole and jalapeño for a spicy garnish. The fish was melt-in-your-mouth good.Shrimp & Chorizo app - another special. Spicy shrimp and smoky chorizo served with potatoes, onions, and corn. Very good portion for sharing.I've never been to Tulum but I've seen pictures, and I can imagine it would look and feel like this space. The trees, the decor, and the entire vibe was a little oasis from NYC. Was it crowded at the bar area! Yes. But we had reservations for 6pm on a Saturday and were able to choose a table away from it all so that didn't really bother us.Is it pricey? Yes. Is it worth the experience? I think so.",2,1,2
1,Kelli D.,"Manhattan, NY",182,15,0,2.0,9/30/2018,"Went here with a big group and you know the rest of the story... Walked out getting royally **** by the bill as did everyone else in the group. We each got a couple beers, a shot of tequila and a couple appetizes to share for the table. Spent $125 with tip included. That be fine if I was tipsy or full...I wasn't close to either. I'd say (or actually I know) this is a cool vibes tourist trap that way way way overcharges.",1,,
2,Michael P.,"New York, NY",36,336,6,5.0,9/18/2018,"Yes, it's not cheap. However, the drinks were solid and it's easily the best guac I've ever had. Not sure how people had such issues with the doormen as I'm far from the most attractive person on earth and walked right in without issue. I sat at the bar and thought service was awesome. I'm not one who rushes to get a margarita but they do them right here.Will be back once my schedule slows down",,,
3,Chrys A.,"East Elmhurst, NY",12,85,82,3.0,9/13/2018,"3stars for the attempt to make you feel like you're anywhere but NY. Many drink options. Be prepared to use a fancy porter potty as everything at this place is located outdoors. Decent bar service, many drink options. Did not attempt to eat here bc my friend got sick last week eating here so we only had drinks.",2,,
4,Gina R.,"Jersey City, NJ",388,159,616,5.0,7/28/2018,"An oasis with refreshing drinks, gorgeous marble and wood bar, and it's downtown.  Yess!You will feel transported.  All the lush greenery is incredible.  Misters going, sand and large rocks strategically placed to form pathways, yes, you feel like you're in any trendy boutique hotel  in Mexico.  Which is *awesome* for a M/T/W/Thurs downtown NYC.Food - Go for it.  Guac comes with freshly fried whole corn taco shells, watermelon radishes, jimcama, cilantro, sunflower sprouts lending some new textures to a staple. Ceviche, tacos, sopes round out the basic classic Mexican fare options.  Oh and the grilled avocado!  That one has seeds and nuts ontop as well as soy sauce.  Portions are not meant for a huge sit down dinner meal. But I suppose if you order enough you'd be full.So go.  Don't let the mixed reviews fool you.  It's a hip trendy spot that's perfect for summer in the city.",9,3,9
5,Tian G.,"New York, NY",29,167,267,3.0,8/7/2018,"Came here for a team event, and we got our special menu. We had guacamole as snack, and it was rather bland for my taste.For small plates, we got tuna, quesadillas and lettuce wrap. All small plates were mediocre, nothing special and their meat inside the wrap was waaaay too salty.We then had the roasted chicken, which was the highlight of the meal. The chicken was tender, and it has a good orange flavor added by the orange, which made it more refreshing. The vegetables accompanied along were well-seasoned too. Their salad and corn were not outstanding, but not bad too. Their flank steak was good, but can be a little more tender.We were served four types of cocktails and mine tasted only avaerage. I would give it a 3 Star, saved by its good service and the chicken.",3,1,1
6,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",413,307,542,4.0,7/9/2018,"Haha the polarized reviews are killing me for this place.Things you shouldn't come to Gitano for:- The best drinks ever- The best food ever- A cheap night/day out- To actually literally be in Tulum (buy a plane ticket for that)- A weekend night unless you have money to blow, reservations, and a deep tolerance for peopleTemper your expectations and you'll have fun. My boyfriend and I waltzed right in on a beautiful Sunday afternoon with no problems (I'm as surprised as anyone considering how hot this place is). The space was beautifully landscaped and decorated, and not crowded at all. We were able to get the attention of a bartender and our drinks within 10 minutes of walking in. No attitude at all from him either, as he helped us pick out what looked good and even offered to sub liquors when my boyfriend told him he wasn't the biggest fan of tequila/mezcal.Grabbed a lounge seat that was outside the dining area, right under several palm trees and cold water misters. If you squint a little and pay attention to the music instead of the city noise, you can pretend you're not in NYC and instead have been transported to some tropical paradise (gave me some serious Mykonos beach club vibes tbh). My drink was fine. It was pricey, yes, but not more so than a typical rooftop bar, and leagues above the drinks I've had at some of those or any club in Meatpacking.I seriously didn't want to leave and if we didn't have dinner reservations, probably would've stayed for several more drinks and small bites.They're still in soft opening mode with a limited menu, but we were told that the full offering would be available starting in the next week or two.",14,4,4
7,Quisha F.,"Manhattan, NY",5,41,27,5.0,11/20/2018,"Hard to get a reservation and the food was small and overpriced! Yikes. I've been to the one in Tulum and it was incredible, and this place was exciting at first being in the middle of the city. But they've had sanitary issues and I just can't buy into the hype. I will continue to support Gitano Tulum and leave this one for you guys!",,,1
8,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1637,64809,4.0,6/23/2018,"The really nice space that should've been an awesome Manhattan location of Smorgasburg is now a beautiful outdoor restaurant, an import of a place from Tulum.The point of this place is not the food, which is really all we tried, but the ambiance and the drinking. The dining area is really nice and can't be beat for a fun summertime meal. But the food itself was all just ok, especially considering the exorbitant prices (e.g. $19 guacamole and $27 pork belly tacos). The most intriguing thing was the very millennial pink Tuna Tiradito ($21), which consists of tuna on top of watermelon. The Quesadilla ($17) on the other hand, is a pretty flavorless hard pass.Nobody came here for Smorgasburg, but hopefully for these guys it's more of a fun drinking destination that will maintain the crowds that they have now on the second night. Note that the bar area was already hopping at around 6:30 on a Saturday, but we were literally the only table occupied in the large main dining area.",10,2,8
9,Wenye X.,"New York, NY",273,84,162,3.0,7/1/2018,"Rain forest in the middle of soho? Amazing!I got a reservation here the moment I heard about it. At entrance, we were checked id and reservation before we could even step foot in the restaurant. That shows how popular this place is!The whole restaurant is outdoor. It is very pretty with a safari vibe, but it does get super super hot... As for food, the menu is very short now, only ~10 choices. Two of us got guacamole, taco and a drink. Both are fine in taste, but are pretty expensive. We expected guac to come with lots of tortilla chips, but unfortunate that is not the case- there were only four large round tortilla chips. We walked out of the restaurant a bit hungry. The service was fine tho. The server was pretty friendly. There is even someone in the bathroom waiting to hand you napkins lol All in all, what an experience!",1,,
10,Larry L.,"New Orleans, LA",19,23,2,1.0,8/19/2018,"I never made it past the male twit working the front door. I was staying at the James Hotel right across the street and wondered what the interesting looking happening was on the city block down below. (Clearly some developer will use this prime real estate for a high rise and Gitano will be no more). Anyway, my wife and I walked over just to see what it was and possibly get a drink before our dinner reservations at a real restaurant. Well, the answer was no, ducking no. As we walked up one of the two greasy guys at the door asked if we had a reservation. We did not - it was 5:30. Then he pointed at my sandals, that probably cost more than his entire outfit - most definitely more than his Chinese knockoff Snooki ""fashion"" sunglasses - and said, "" I cannot let you in with those flip flops"".  I said, ""Thanks. Peace, I'm outta here.""Then we looked them up on yelp and saw it was a 2.5-star Mexican restaurant on yelp, and we laughed and laughed and laughed SO MUCH. Coming from a real food and bar destination like New Orleans where the culinary scene sets the measuring stick for good food and hospitality, this place clearly was not worth making it past the front door. Oh, and we went to look for online reservations, they had openings every 15 minutes for the entire evening - Saturday night in NYC. Same for next Saturday night too. Id bet this place won't be open the next one I'm back in town, but who even cares?",5,5,2
11,Alicia V.,"New York, NY",0,7,2,1.0,9/24/2018,"Beautiful scenery but that was it. The food was bland and overpriced. I'm a food junkie so I have no problems paying for food. The service was terrible my waitress had a chip on her shoulder. The dinner selection was horrible, I asked my waitress about the tacos she said they only had pork which I kindly explained to her I didn't eat pork. So I order a couple of appetizers & the shrimp dinner that she suggested, welp there was huge chunks of sausage in my shrimp so I sent it back. The waitress comes to question me and said well if you would have read the description, actually I didn't because you recommended it. If you want great tacos and ambiance go to Bodega Negra. Honestly I wish I would have read the reviews ahead of time.",,,
12,Taylor H.,"New York, NY",366,150,1216,5.0,7/21/2018,"Absolutely LOVE this oasis in Soho. If you're looking toGet away from the city come here! Drinks and food are on par. Drinks are pricey but worth it, and the snacks are made from a Noma alum, AMAZING!",4,2,4
13,Davina F.,"New York, NY",386,199,79,1.0,7/9/2018,"Palm trees do not make up for poor, ill-mannered management.  I attended a friend's party here, and although I was not directly involved in coordinating, it all seemed extremely unorganized.  The quote that was received in a previous email correspondence did not match the in-person estimate.  There were plenty of, ""Let me ask my manager,"" back-and-forths between us and the staff.  The male manager (I think?) is also pretty rude.  When our food was brought out to our table, he yelled, ""GLASSES!"" at my friend because there were sunglasses where he wanted to place the plate.  I can think of at least one way to have better handled that interaction.And, finally: the restaurant demands to be vacant at the stroke of midnight because of a noise agreement between Gitano and law enforcement.  I understand that this isn't ideal and the restaurant would probably prefer to remain open, but once again, it wasn't handled well.  The staff practically shoved us out of the restaurant and then continued yelling at us to move to the corner so the restaurant wouldn't get fined for noise.  We weren't belligerent at all, because we all only had about two drinks due to the confusion with our party's menu.  If you don't want to accommodate guests late at night, maybe operating a bar is a bad idea? The food was tasty and, like I said, the ambiance is beautiful.  But, if you're looking for a fun, relaxed night at a place that genuinely wants your business, look elsewhere. There are plenty of other rooftop, patio, riverside, or just generally polite establishments to check out.  Not coming back to this one.",14,2,
14,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",294,115,135,4.0,7/20/2018,"The tl;dr:PROS:- Make a reservation (thank me later)- Absolutely beautiful decor feels like you're not in NYC- The food was awesome.  Not sure what the other people ate here, but everything had a ton of flavor and was cooked perfectly.  (my friend and I consider ourselves ""foodies"" and qualified to judge in this category based on experience, and I mean that in the most humble way possible)- The drinks were great - we tried four out of six cocktails- The service: our server was Honey and she was a dream.CONS:- THE SMOKING.  Are we serious with this, Gitano?  Not only is this illegal in NYC, but our table backed into the lounge area and I got mouthfuls of smoke to go with my expensive food.  I realize your restaurant is entirely outdoors, but it's still a restaurant.- The prices.  Sticker shock was real when we got the bill.- Not necessarily a con, but it's VERY scene-y.  So be prepared to feel self-conscious if you're not looking trendy that day.And now a bit more detail on the food:- The quesadillas: As my friend put it, ""these are how quesadillas are supposed to be.""  The outside shell was just the right amount of crisp, the squash blossoms inside were flavorful, and the cheese was a burst of savory that completed a delicious combination.  - The ceviche:  another beautiful flavor combination of fresh fish, several herbs and spices, and tons of citrus.  Brought me back to Tulum (I've been to the original restaurant)- The sopes: the chicken was delicious, but the outside shell was a little too crispy to bite into without it being awkward (and impossible to cut with a knife).  I ended up eating the chicken on top and then eating the sope as a chip of sorts.- The fish special:  glad our server recommended this, as Gitano hit it out of the park with this one.  Seasoned and cooked perfectly, tons of juices and flavor locked in due to the banana leaf exterior.  Perfection.- The dessert:  called ""orgasmo"" for a reason.  Passion fruit is normally my favorite, and the crunchy chocolate seeds inside were a great combination of texture.  I wanted three more orders.All in all, I would say this place is a welcome addition to NYC.  It seems they got their shit together with the food since the opening.  I would recommend making sure you have the money to spend here and you should have a good time.  It really is an oasis in the middle of a metropolis.  I would have given it five stars had it not been for the smoking.",3,1,
15,Cyrus P.,"New York, NY",841,876,530,3.0,7/8/2018,"Gitano, I want to love you, but your food is too pricey and some of the menu items are hit or miss. I arrived to meet some friends at around 3:30pm on a Saturday afternoon. They asked if I had reservations, but I did not and stated that i would just be having drinks at the bar. It was a beautiful Saturday and the weather was perfect. I got to the bar and found a seat. I ordered the Gitano margarita and although it looked really nice it lacked flavor. It was kind of flavorless which is very odd for any drink with alcohol in it. Afterwards I stuck with mezcal and lime juice and ordered the guacamole. The guac was very nice looking in presentation, but also lacked flavor. It was pretty bland. When I think about guac I want the pineapple guac from Añejo Tribeca. That's delicious. This was meh. The 3 stars were for service, which was excellent all around, for atmosphere, which was really nice and for the overall vibe. It's a fun, unique space that lures in a very attractive crowd, so dress it up a bit.",5,,3
16,Leisha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",687,194,70,4.0,7/3/2018,"I didn't eat here but I do feel a weird precedent to also defend it - stopped by for a drink on Thursday evening around 10p and had no issue flagging someone down for service. Grabbed a delicious cocktail, enjoyed some bangin music, enjoyed seeing a Tulum pop up in the middle of Canal. LOL @ people who are mad that this is not the same as their beloved memory in Tulum but alas yes, this is in the middle of the city and close to SoHo. Most of the people around me were tourists, so I imagine it was hectic for more reasons than one.I too have enjoyed the Gitano in Tulum and you'll remember it is extremely busy and established, meaning that we couldn't even get reservations when we had initially tried to book a table there - so a pop up is likely to have some issues scaling up quickly.Do not make the mistake of having a sit outside on your way in or out - you will be asked by at least four couples to take their photo in front of the neon sign. Enjoyed my cocktail, thought it was cool. Cruise by on a weeknight after work to check it out - expect slow response on the weekend - aka every bar in the area.",5,,
17,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1177,35,4.0,6/27/2018,"Gitano is a urban oasis on the border of SoHo, TriBeCa and Chinatown. It's amazing how beautifully landscaped the space is with towering palm trees and lush tropical plants. There is a large bar area right in the middle with ample seating as well as lots of space to stand with overly priced cocktails ($16 - $20 each). I tried the Disco Ball drink and was disappointed that it didn't actually include any glitter, as the description said it would. But the drink itself was tasty and the bartenders were very nice. Service is still a tad slow, but I think that's because the place is so new and they're working out the initial kinks now.",4,3,5
18,Amira A.,"Brooklyn, NY",391,741,425,1.0,9/17/2018,"Walked in, sat down, looked at the menu, walked out. My friend is a vegetarian and I try to be a bit more accommodating when we go out. I wanted to do it for the views but we just couldn't justify her spending $20 on asparagus. Lost your damn mind. After asking important questions about the tapas that they were passing off as entrees, we decided together to go elsewhere. The menu was super limited and underwhelming during lunch. We mentioned to our waiter that we were just going to leave and she said we had to pay for the still water, we said okay. It was $7 plus tax for a bottle of water. We laughed, left the money and dipped off to David Burke.",4,,
19,Gina P.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,21,41,4.0,8/22/2018,"A tropical oasis in the middle of the concrete jungle.The decor definitely deserves 5 stars because its such a cool concept and so unusual to see a place so tropical in Manhattan. The drinks were for the most part very good (disco ball is must try) however, the Mojito was pure lemon juice with tequila and it was extremely sour.The food was really good and my personal favorite was the daily special quesadilla. However, the service was slow and the waitress seemed lost but that might have been because its such a new place and they are still working on a routine.Overall, it was a very esthetically pleasing place with good Mexican style food.",,,

21,Fabiola P.,"Union County, NJ",279,97,404,3.0,8/25/2018,Super cute spot! The ambiance is everything but the food was just blah. Nothing to brag about. I got the disco ball drink that had edible glitter on the rim (cute). My drink was yummy but def was lacking the liquor. The music is nice. Lots of people were dressed as if it was a NYC club. The vibe is cool. If I go back it'll only be for the ambiance and to give the drinks another try.,4,3,3

23,Leanne S.,"Linden, NJ",42,75,130,4.0,8/23/2018,"This place is a literal piece of Tulum in New York City. I've been to the location in Tulum so I had high expectations and they did not disappoint. The decor is beautiful and they really give you those jungle vibes that Tulum is known for with palm trees and wooden decor at every corner. There is bar seating, table seating, and lounge seating depending on what you're there for. I made dinner reservations for a Saturday evening just to be on the safe side however they didn't seem too crowded. I've heard later in the night it can be hard to get in so maybe come early or have a reservation just to save the yourself the headache. The views are amazing with the freedom tower just a short distance away. I had the gitano margarita and was sooo good. It had a hint of cucumber which was super refreshing. We stuck to appetizers and the sopes and guac are a must. The drinks and food are both pretty pricey but nothing out of the norm for New York City. Looking forward to coming back before the summer ends!",1,,2
24,DH H.,"New York, NY",90,896,2,3.0,7/28/2018,"Atmosphere is perfect.  They did such a great job.  Staff was pretty great and accommodating.  Food was actually really tasty -- we're veg so did the guac, grilled avocados, and quesadillas -- and they all tasted great.The problems though are just completely fixable and unnecessary and leading to the bad reviews.  People are complaining about the prices, but the prices are normal for the area.  $16 is what a good cocktail costs in Soho, fine.  But the Mezcal cocktails were both very obviously diluted with water which is just stupid and unnecessary.  And, the quesadillas -- oh my let's talk about the quesadillas.  The quesadilla is $15, which would be fine.  A quesadilla is supposed to be about the size of a frying pan, right?  Their quesadilla is the size of a normal small tortilla.  Like basically one taco.  For $15.  So to get a normal sized quesadilla you need to order three.  So their quesadilla is actually FORTY FIVE DOLLARS.  I paid this because I was hungry but I do not feel good about it.  And neither should you.  And neither should they.This place could, and hopefully will, be great. (the Tulum location had none of these issues, so they obviously are capable) If they turn down the income greed by like 20%, it'll be awesome.  Maybe there is a method to the madness because people (like me I guess) were willing to pay, but that's not going to last.",7,1,
25,Enrico R.,"New York, NY",0,5,1,1.0,7/20/2018,"I aimed to please my out-of-towner, Vogue addict guests; and this was high on their list of tourist trappings. Even the 100's of health violations and the bruising eater.com review couldn't dissuade them. For a New Yorker, this is like goin' to Vegas to see the Eiffel Tower. After perusing Yelp and other reviews, I girded for a mediocre food and costly evening. Gitano did not disappoint. What I didn't anticipate was a club atmosphere and crowd; we could literally not exit, the door guys were severely outnumbered, 100 screamers to 1 at 10:30PM. Other Yelpers mention steak and fish?? Maybe main courses are not always offered, the menu is brief 6-7 appetizers. Some items were adequate, all unmemorable and obscenely priced, even by NYC standards. There's a dazzling array of sickeningly sweet drink concoctions for those (see screamers above) who like their alcohol masked and luckily available by the pitcher. There's a decent selection of tequilas, but the pour is really skimpy for the price.  The mostly bankers and basics crowd, turned obnoxiously loud, drunk and way less attractive as the sun went down. The music blew and was ear piercing, I guess they were trying to drown out the honking traffic.The smoke from the grill or whatever was truly epic, get a table far, far away. Everyone smelled like they had just escaped a forest fire, prepare to shower twice after your visit. This is not really a restaurant, it's a bar that aspires to be a club. The staff doesn't look or act happy to be there, I feel for them, I couldn't wait to leave. Hard pass, Gitano.",7,9,1
26,Tiffany L.,"Brooklyn, NY",117,12,19,3.0,7/6/2018,"I decided to pop by this place with a friend who suggested going here for drinks. When we first arrived, we were told that they were only accepting people who had reservations so we quickly made some last minute reservations (surprisingly) on OpenTable and waited for about 10 minutes.Once inside, it's pretty much like a tropical paradise. There are palm trees and little seating areas. Bathrooms were located in trailers. This place is clearly still a work in progress because if you head to the back, there's definitely some unfinished construction there. Otherwise, we got seated relatively quickly. Drinks and food were beyond expensive. I got the disco ball (asbolut, rosé, grapefruit, basil, glitter) and also the guacamole. Both were pretty good but definitely not worth the price. I suspect people come here for the experience and ambience. There are lots of good opportunities for instagram pictures.",,,
27,Kristi V.,"Manhattan, NY",15,27,225,2.0,8/17/2018,"So the first time I came here, with a group of four girls, I was told we needed to wait for thirty minutes on the street bc they were at capacity. To be fair, it was the week they opened. We left and decided to return another night. Tonight (Thursday) we made a dinner res for 9:30pm and upon arrival were asked if we wanted a more lively dinner or less so. We said more lively, as it was just my girlfriend and I. They sat us in the bar area, where there were very few people sitting for dinner, and empty tables all around us. The bar itself however was pretty lively with people standing around talking and drinking. The place is beautiful and completely open air so it definitely feels like you are somewhere tropical. After about 10 minutes of sitting there, a guy came to give us water and told us someone would be there soon to take our order. We then waited another 5 minutes for a server to actually show up and take our order. We immediately placed both our drink and food order since we had been sitting already for 15 minutes and didn't want her to take any longer. The food however arrived fast and was delicious. We had guacamole, carne asada, and ceviche, along with two tequila drinks. The guacamole came with 4 big tortilla crisps and was a huge portion of guac. The ceviche was good but kind of weird with the berries. The carne asada was AMAZING. Cooked to perfection, juicy, and served with delicious peppers. The drinks seemed kind of watered down - it was a tequila and soda drink off of their cocktail menu (can't remember the name of it) and not that amazing. After dinner, my gf and I went to the bathroom which is basically a trailer near the front entrance. Nothing huge but definitely nice for an outdoor space restaurant. I left and waited just outside the bathroom on the steps until my friend finished. At this time, I sat down on the steps out of the way of both the men's and women's bathroom doors, thinking I would be out of the way. At this time, almost immediately, a bouncer ran over to me and yelled at me to stand up. I told him I was just waiting for a friend (and I was clearly not at all intoxicated or making a scene or anything) and he said it didn't matter and I had to stand up. I thought this was very odd, as I was literally the ONLY PERSON over there and just would be there two minutes until my friend came out. Overall, I'm giving two stars only bc the food was so good but honestly the staff and wait time make me want to give only one star. Don't think I'll be returning anytime soon sadly. I'll miss you carne asada",1,1,
28,Monique L.,"New York, NY",394,24,13,3.0,8/1/2018,"I've been to Gitano in Mexico which I think is much better than the one in the city. Yes, It's a great destination on a cheerful bright sunny day but when its hot outside it's not comfy at all. No fans to give a fresh breeze so expect to sweat on hot and humid days. (best to stay away or expect to be quite uncomfy) Not suggested unless there is NO humidity.A small shoppe out front with hippie like finds that are similar to many i have seen in India but priced 20x's of what it should be. If you are a fashionista like myself than you know what i mean. Overall , the location is close to home and I would def go back with friends as it's a tropical lil paradise in NYC and you do feel like you are in the tropics.Food is eh, Drinks are yummy. I have had much better Mexican. Asked for salsa and they stated they don't have it. They gave attitude which as a new yorker, I wasn't feeling. I've never been to a mexican restaurant that doesn't have salsa. It just comes with the territory .......Tulum is in Mexico, right????",2,1,1

Four drinks won't get you even a buzz. The Gitano specialty cocktails drinks are priced at 16 a piece and it's almost as though you're drinking a Capri Sun. They have a full bar, but why would you come to Gitano to get a vodka soda? Of course you try their specialty cocktails! Just be warned you'll be $100 bucks in for one person on drinks that won't do the job.I've gone twice, maybe I will try again toward end of summer, but so far this place is a no no! I've recommended to friends and they thought the same. Seemingly so does everyone else reviewing this place. Do better Gitano - these problems seem like simple fixes!",4,,
30,Jackie V.,"Forest Hills, NY",0,4,1,1.0,7/13/2018,"Where do I begin .... after reading the reviews my friends & I figured we would try it for ourselves BIG MISTAKE. Besides the poorly seasoned food (under seasoned guacamole & over seasoned/undercooked steak) we were seated next to not 1 but 2 Lap dogs while dining - no one asked if we had an allergy or if it was ok with us , they just assumed we would be OK with this . Next up , I ordered a glass of wine that never came when it did it was old and had a foul odor when i pointed it out to the server he said "" all Malbecs have the same wet dog smell, it what they are known for"". FALSE, never come on man , at least be honest and say it's old . The restaurant had just reopened today due to health code violations so I was really surprised at the way they handled everything . DO NOT BOTHER , take a selfie somewhere else and buy a plan tree at Home Depot .",7,2,
31,Tim S.,"New York, NY",1,94,0,1.0,9/30/2018,"A friend and I approached this venue after a day of shopping in Tribeca and Soho.  We were looking for a place to grab a drink and enjoy a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  Gitano looked enticing from the outside, so we both figured, it would be worth the try.  That was my first mistake.We approached the main entrance, which was being manned by an extremely smarmy looking, d-bag with slicked back hair and mirrored sun glasses.  Really??  As we proceeded to enter the premises, he jumped in front of us and demanded what we wanted.  Ummm.....what we wanted is to get a drink as shocking as that might be.  I asked him if there was a private party going on given his hostile tone and his apparent intent to not grant us entrance.  He indicated that was not the case and then demanded to know if we had a reservation.  He physically was blocking our entrance into the space.I looked at this mess of an individual and asked in shock, ""Do I really need a reservation to get in?"" He answered honestly and indicated that we did not.  Then I responded, ""So what's the problem??!""  I was starting to feel oily just speaking with this Neanderthal.He finally shrugged and granted us entrance.  It would have been easier to get into Studio 54 back in the day than to enter this trashy establishment.  My friend and I entered extremely put off after being accosted.  We circled the bar and seating area as this was our first visit, which was packed with drunken wannabes. Nothing about this bar/restaurant was appealing in the least.Ultimately, we did what any sane New Yorker would do in our circumstances.  My friend and I simply decided to go spend our money and time anyplace else but Gitano.If you are in search of a sad, low rent frat party, this is the place for you!  Otherwise, I would suggest going to any of the many much more interesting places that our fair city has to offer.You've Been Warned!!",3,1,
32,Cay S.,"New York, NY",3,42,80,3.0,10/10/2018,"Came for a birthday party with a prefix menu. The vibe and decor was amazing. However the food and drinks, not so much. The portions were extremely small and unfortunately we all left hungry. The service was slow and it took forever to order a drink. While the food did taste great, I don't think a single person had any more than 1 bite to try. When the desert came out, there wasn't enough for everyone. The menu/staff failed to tell us that the single service desert portion was meant for two. Would definitely return to have a drink during a nice night but probably not to eat.",1,,
33,May C.,"Jersey City, NJ",484,663,591,2.0,7/15/2018,"Oh boy, it is quite messy here. I love pop ups, it's a fun concept - bringing Tulum to NYC for the summer. The vibe is amazing and it feels very nice with the palm trees and pool in the back. We first came in and the guy seated us at a lounge, but really it is just a bench with nice pillows with a small wooden table for drinks. He said that we would order with a waitress and our drinks would be brought to us instead of us going to the bar. Okay. Fantastic, I love that. After 10 minutes of no one approaching us, we decided to go up to the bar and order. It was super quick. We ordered right away and received our drinks in 5 minutes. By that time, someone already took our spot so we left and went somewhere else to sit. When we sat down, three different waiters stopped by to drop off drinks to us that weren't ours. And they didn't get it when we kept saying that we did not order those. This happened to us twice. It was really disorganized. They really should just let everyone order at the bar and then find their own seats. It would be much more efficient. It was a nice way to spend the afternoon, but the service is a bit of a turn off and I don't know if I'll be back.",3,1,2
34,Natasha P.,"Knoxville, TN",292,272,609,2.0,7/1/2018,"Okay so here's the REAL. I see how polarizing the reviews are so let me fill you in. YES this place is extremellyyyyyyy gorgeous. There are gorgeous trees everywhere! It really does feel like you're in an oasis or being transported in the middle of Tulum. In regards to ambiance & decor, this place deserves 5 stars maybe even 6.Now, here's why I give the 2 stars. The Bartenders are complete and utter guttersnips. Listen....I've been to the most exclusive bars, restaurants & clubs in all of New York, London & Miami just to name a few so I know how it goes. (I pretty much live in Soho house LOL!) But this place has no leg to stand on. I've never been more disgusted. EVER. Like did you forget you're in the business of service. They are super condescending and they act like you should be grateful that they are even serving you and they're trash. The drinks are basic and apparently the food is trash sooo will see how long this build a bear/bar pop up lasts.....",13,7,3
35,Toya E.,"Queens, NY",97,17,18,3.0,8/21/2018,"Super dope pop up, love the vibe and the fact it's outside gives it a extra bonus, OKAY I didn't dine because everything on there menu was expensive guacamole and chips is 20$ NO WAY! And from what I heard the food isn't all that. Honestly This isn't a spot you come to eat it's more of a spot you meet up with friends have few drinks then really hit the city. There drinks are okay and expensive as well. And if your homophobic this isn't the spot for you. Make reservations if you intend on going.",,,
36,Mari T.,"Williamsburg, NY",278,4,4,5.0,8/25/2018,"A little disco jungle hideaway in the city  the food (esp the guacamole and ceviche) was delicious and the staff went out of their way to accommodate my friends and I! We needed a little energy boost and asked the bartender for an espresso-based cocktail - at first we were told they don't have espresso but then the bartender went off and 5 mins later appeared with two espresso's in hand - just perfect! Also, after arriving and being seated, the hostess came back up to us and showed us another seating area where we could sit more comfortably as a larger group...such nice service  Look forward to going again!",,,
37,Tamara G.,"New York, NY",73,68,156,2.0,7/20/2018,"Mehhhhhhh..... I knew what I was walking into. I knew it was overpriced and I knew the menu was limited. What I did not know was what a pain it would be to get into the place even with reservations. What I did not know was how bad the food would be. Guacamole had no flavor, the 3 tortilla chips they gave us with it were stale. The ceviche had so much acidity it made it difficult to eat. The chorizo wraps were meh, the $25 tacos were meh. The steak was meh. The real kicker was the size of the quesadilla, clearly they were pranking us right? Yea it's nice visually but I have zero desire to return.",2,1,
38,Ashley P.,"New York, NY",0,22,5,1.0,8/29/2018,"Overall, this was an okay experience. I came here with two of my girlfriends for our usual get together and we weren't that impressed. We had read about how great and trendy this place was and when we got there, not only did we wish they had about 50 more fans throughout the place (it's an outside bar), but the food and the service were just not good.We said we needed a minute figuring out the drinks (which average about $17) and the waiter was gone for about 10mins before we saw him again. We were probably sitting for about 20-25mins before we could even get our food order in. Also, I would stick to small apps and shared plates here. The food is ridiculously expensive. Sure it was fine, but for $16 for guacamole...I need a little more than ""fine"". And when we had ordered a 2nd round of drinks, we were asked by about 5 different waiters if we were done with our guacamole and chips. I understand you're trying to clear tables, but we were still drinking and a good amount of food left. With as much as we were paying for this place, I'm eating every last bite. I shouldn't have to justify that with 4 chips and a decent amount of guacamole left that I'm not done.If you feel like blowing through money, this place could be fine for a happy hour. But honestly you can take your money elsewhere in the area and get way better drinks and staff. The margs were not great and they have a cocktail with glitter but that's about the only thing special about it. Still tastes like an overpriced cocktail.Unless they change the pricing and the staff, we won't be back.",,,
39,Ben B.,"Milton, DE",172,1,1,5.0,9/1/2018,Everyone was so amazing here. Our server Kyle went over the top to make sure everything was amazing. My business was very pleased with all the service. Malic constantly checked on us and developed a great friendship with everyone here. The service was amazing and if there's one place you should go to in the city it should be here. A true escape from the city life. Gitano margarita and jungle fever  recommended,,,
40,Ang M.,"Brooklyn, NY",115,107,12,1.0,7/6/2018,"What a joke.  This is a 20,000 sq foot place and they turn people away at the door early Friday. Come on.  I have been to the one in Tulum and they didn't turn people away.  This place doesn't deserve to make it in NYC.",3,,
41,Joanna M.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",0,12,3,3.0,8/29/2018,"Ok so the ambience in this place is amazing. Amazing set up. Love the Tulum Mexico feel. The only problem with this place is that it's a pop up so they are very unorganized. You have to wait in line once you walk up to the door, reservation or not. After that you have to be seen by someone else, then wait again for your table. Best bet is to just go for a few drinks by the bar. Food is ok, but very small portion. Overall this place has potential but like i said, it's a pop up so don't expect too much.",,,
42,Kim X.,"New York, NY",128,55,20,2.0,9/16/2018,"My friends and I went to Tulum this past year and fell absolutely in love. We were so excited to hear about this pop up in NYC, but were very disappointed with the experience. There were two people standing outside the establishment welcoming people in, but they were more rude than welcoming. Also, once we got inside, the bartender barely spoke to us, not even a ""hi"". I'm not sure if being stoic and mean is the vibe they're trying to set, but this was definitely not the vibe we got when we were at the place in Tulum. Also, the cocktails will cost you a arm and a leg.",2,,
43,R L.,"New York, NY",154,459,19,3.0,9/25/2018,"Went for our Monthly Ladies Night.  Cute concept and space.  It's like a really well thought out pop up with super fancy trailer bathrooms, lol.  The wait staff was really nice and the front door staff totally had Shanon Beador's Judgy-Eyes and then some.  LOL There are like three sets of people to go through just to get in, each asking if you have a reservation and make you feel like you're an inconvenience to them because you don't....then you get inside and you realize the place is EMPTY!! You have to treat people nice, it's not cool otherwise.  We had a few bottles of wine and enjoyed the views of the WTC...and the beautiful weather.  Was a nice concept and actually makes me wish Summer were still here.  It's a nice experience, cannot say I will go back.",,1,
44,Marie A.,"New York, NY",48,116,15,5.0,9/11/2018,A killer spot for cocktails with views for days where you'll feel like you're in Mexico completely forgetting that Gitano was a former parking lot - The people watching was amazing and the scene was lively from 6pm till we left at 10pm - Will definitely stop by again before their season ends,1,,2
45,June K.,"Stuart, FL",15,18,5,4.0,7/21/2018,"So much fun! Just like being in Florida! Gitano is lush and beautiful with a creative menu. We just went to see it, so we had just dessert - Orgasmo - which is a yummy passion fruit and ginger mouse with tiny chocolate balls. They are trying out the menu, so it might look different next week. And it's seasonal - moving to Miami in November. Go and enjoy it NOW!",,,
46,Jiho S.,"New York, NY",74,528,127,3.0,7/9/2018,Great spot in soho on what was an empty lot. I believe this is a pop up for the summer so it has limited shelf life before cold weather rolls around. Initially I wasn't impressed given this but seeing how much vegetation they brought here (e.g. huge palm trees) I definitely think it's worth a trip. Keep in mind this place will require reservations. You will not be able to get in without one even to drink at the bar. Just book one on open table and make it happen. The food is outrageously expensive ($28 for 4 tacos) but you're here to see and be scene. Price to pay to get a little Tulum in NYC.,,,
47,Stephanie M.,"Ozone Park, NY",30,29,13,3.0,7/6/2018,"A safari in the middle of soho! The whole ambiance of the restaurant is amazing and gives many photo ops. Ok ladies, do not blow dry your hair to come here! The restaurant is filled with mist from the spritzers. You know the ones that they have for the vegetables at the supermarket. Thank god I had my hair tied up. The mist helps to keep cool. Food-they don't have a full menu. They have about 10 items on their menu. And I must mention pricey, but you kind of have to expect that. We ordered the pulled pork tacos. 4 tacos for $27. We also had the guac, sopes (fav), and the desert was a passion fruit mousse. I will also mention that our waiter was super nice. However, I would just stick to coming here for the drinks. Dress casual... stick to flats due to the sand. Oh and they only have 1 bathroom so expect a long wait.",,,1
48,Joanna V.,"Brooklyn, NY",145,1273,1201,3.0,7/5/2018,"So as soon as I heard about this place, I knew I wanted to give it a shot during the summer. When we walked in, my friend and I were a bit overwhelmed. Overwhelmed by the beauty of the tropical oasis that was created with the gorgeous trees. Also, Overwhelmed by the very clear desire of the people who were here to be ""seen."" This is absolutely an Instagrammers paradise with the plant life and the very expensive average drinks. The restaurant is open but only has a small number of menu items available right now and truly, half the restaurant isn't even complete yet. Just beyond those beautiful trees are piles of construction materials. The area for seating is quite small and the bar area will be very packed. If you are coming to eat, you absolutely have to make a reservation or you will me SOL. The drink menu is quite small, but they do have a full bar. There is a cocktail on the menu that has glitter in it. My friend and I were interested so we asked a couple of girls what it was like. They said, ""well the first sip was....a lot. We thought we made a mistake. But then you get used to it."" That wasn't exactly a stand up review so we went with the margarita with mezcal. It took about 15 minutes for the group of bartenders all talking with each other and not helping any customers to condescendingly ask if we wanted a drink. Great vibe you're putting across.....really....Overall, this is definitely a one and done kind of place. I have no desire to go back. It was kind of a cool and unique experience to have in the middle of NYC so that was cool.",,1,

Cocktails were meh and you can find somewhere else in NYC with a better selection at a much better price, which goes for the food too. Atmosphere - I guess they're trying to make it look like Tulum which, the idea itself is cool, but it basically results in the kind of people who come to the restaurant just to post it on the Instagram, not necessarily savor the food or drink.The one thing that led to our overall bad experience was a group near us that was being really obnoxious, and were clearly drunk and rowdy. They were disrespectful to both us and the restaurant - breaking a chair and glass, dropping an earring under our table and crawling under us to get it, one guy knocking into me and my chair over and over again, constantly shouting and banging on the table. Not sure if anything was said to them by the staff but that pretty much ruined the whole experience for me, don't think I'll personally go back.Honestly am pretty disappointed from seeing all the hype there was around the restaurant all over the place.There are plenty of other more affordable options in New York that are just as good, if not better, with a much better crowd.",,,

Of course it's not, you're in the middle of Canal Street and Chinatown, where nothing nice has ever come out of. What would you expect? People's expectations are ridiculous sometimes. That being said, the venue ois very nice, especially for where it is located. This place has a great vibe and if you can cancel out some of the noise of NYC around you, the vibe can definitely be reminiscent of a tropical paradise. Different from most NYC bars for sure. A place that is definitely more beneficial for the ambiance than cocktails and food. The cocktails and food were fine, nothing great, but fine. But the price point is insane. If you go here for dinner, you're spending way over 100 dollars for 2. Be careful before you rack up a 250 dollar bill like I did.Overall, a great, relaxing spot to get a few drinks and a bite (ONE BITE) to pick on.",3,3,1

I know this is supposed to be a branch from Tulum but to be honest this place is nothing more than a nasty tourist trap. Everything is soooo overpriced and the food is not good at all, but the worst thing is the attitude of the staff and especially the people at the door. Our water was never refilled and we were treated very rudely the whole time. Never going to this place again in New York or even in tulum.

Unfortunately we were brought the wrong food item, and politely sent it back.Later in the evening, we ordered a second round of drinks, and were brought the wrong drinks. We sent them back.When I finally got the bill, it was crowded and dark. I missed the fact that they had charged us for the food item that we didn't order-and had sent back.I ended up paying for something we never even touched.

95,Peter C.,"New York, NY",0,7,2,3.0,7/15/2018,"Fun idea and cool use of space to create a pop up bar, but the line to get in was a pain and the drinks were expensive. The crowd around the bar was a lousy mix of people I normally wouldn't want to be out with, but the cabanas around the sides were nice and offered a cool spot to hang on a summer day.

The wrong plates were brought to our table multiple times which was very annoying, and we only seen our waitress TWICE through the course of our meal.

106,Ivo P.,"Manhattan, NY",331,8,0,5.0,7/16/2018,"What the team at Gitano's has been able to pull off in an empty lot in the middle of Manhattan is amazing!  They have created an ""experience"" that transports you out of the concrete jungle and in to a tropical oasis full of palm trees and a nice vibe with the right music. Kudo's!The food was fantastic!  Now there were some things I liked better than others, but that's in every restaurant.  If there was to be a complaint (and I'm not, cause it was an easy fix), it would be a little more salt in the guacamole; but I really enjoyed everything...the guacamole, lettuce wraps, tuna tiradito, chicken tinga sopas, pork belly carnitas tacos and the Orgasmo dessert (heavenly)!The ""Jungle Fever"" drink is insanely good!  The price is comparable to downtown prices.  I've seen some reviews complain about the prices...if you want $5 drinks go somewhere else.  This drink was so worth the price!  The bartenders were very helpful and learned about my taste before recommending this wonderful green and spicy concoction.The service - our waitress was absolutely wonderful.  As you could imagine, being a new hotspot, the place was quite busy.

The steak was bland, we asked for salt to try to add a little more flavor. The portions are small and everything is over priced. The ambiance, the crowd & the decor (palm trees, disco ball bar) were very nice. But since the restaurant is outdoors it was EXTREMELY hot, humid and very uncomfortable. There's no fans or AC. It was a nice experience, but I wouldn't return. If you do plan on trying it out, I recommend choosing a day when it isn't too hot.",,,

119,Angela M.,"New York, NY",116,4,1,1.0,8/16/2018,"I visited Gitano on a Wednesday evening with 3 coworkers. We had reservations and were seated immediately. Although someone came over and took our appetizer order, it took quite long for 1 of our items to come out. In general service was slow but we didn't make a fuss as we saw it was busy. We then ordered 5 dishes to share amongst us along with a few drinks each. The 4 of us were enjoying our time and food when our waitress came over to tell us we were there too long and they needed the table - we were literally still eating part of our dinner. I was very upset and one of my coworkers asked her if they could even move us to another table as we wanted to finish our food and order dessert. After our waitress asked her manager if this was possible, she came over to tell us no and that we would have to move to the lounge even if we intended to order more food. This is completely unacceptable service as we were paying customers and were understanding to the staff as the restaurant was busy. Service was already sub-par at best since it took a considerable amount of time not only for our food to come out, but to also find our waitress to order food. Although the food we were able to eat was delicious, it is not worth coming back due to the way we were treated.",2,,
120,Travis P.,"Marin, CA",63,2,0,1.0,8/11/2018,Mediocre drinks and really arrogant service. Nothing like the time-and-place magic of Gitano in Tulum. Spend your money elsewhere.,2,,

We did have to wait briefly at the door since we didn't have a reservation, bar was packed, standing room only. Door guy was nice to us, we were nice to him. We were able to quickly grab 3 seats at the bar and to my surprise were greeted by the bartender! Bartender was cool and friendly. We ordered a margarita pitcher $120 (I think) it was HUGE. 3 people on 1 pitcher at that price is NOT bad if you plan to have 2 drinks each in NYC. The crowd was the typical douchy nightlife folks which was expected so that wasn't surprising for a new, hip downtown spot with a concept from Tulum. The design is gorgeous, well thought out, great detail and feels like a jungle. Disco ball is a cute touch! The space is in a residential neighborhood so, I'm sure they have to comply with capacity and noise restrictions. I know they've had issues with DOH but...news flash the space is OUT DOORS and can't be easy to keep mandated time & temperature on what have been the hottest days in the city, certainly not for mishandling food like the Dept of Health would have you believe. I'm still looking forward to having dinner there.",,,

Though I do understand that the place just opened, it still doesn't justify the experience we've had. Disclaimer, unlike many folks that dined there and had to wait to be seated, it was not the case for my group as one of the guys was a friend of the owner an so we got a table quickly. And that....that was the highlight of the evening. Waitress or I should say, multiple confused waitresses who had no idea what was going on, kept showing up and asking if we ordered (we did) what we ordered (repeat and repeat) yet ended up waiting for 45 min for wrong food. How can a place with such a tiny (and ridiculously overpriced) menu screw up this bad?? Food was ok, not memorable and we got overcharged in the end and had to rework the bill. Bathroom situation was pretty gross if the the restaurant shutdown happened because of it, I wouldn't be surprised. But hands down, the worst and the most fantastically awful part was the drink situation. Again, tiny menu for cocktails which is ok - we order one of specials and .....(drumroll)....waitress says ""oh, that bar is backed up so sureeeee you can put the order for this drink but you'll wait like....45 min so I suggest get a rose"". I am still amazed at that sentence. What do you mean the bar is backed up?? Why do you even have a drink menu then if you cannot execute? Speechless and won't be coming back.",5,,

Made a reservation for Sunday @9:00 pm, drove into the city from Queens and as my partner and I parked my car nearby, was surprised by a phone call - it was the manager who was calling at 8:55 to apologize for the fact that the place ran out of food and can only offer us drinks. As he offered apologetically to introduce us to the owner and treat us to a complementary cocktail, we agreed to stay for a drink since we were looking forward to some delicious mezcal drinks. We were led into a beautiful area of the establishment, and were seated at a table that had not been wiped, and the manager walked away to go get the owner. We moved to the table next to us and after a few minutes were greeted by a waiter who brought a menu that did NOT have not even one cocktail with mezcal in it. A minute or so later, the manager returned with a lady, whose name I don't remember, but we assumed that was the owner. She went on and on about how sorry they were for not being adequately prepared for the pride parade crowds in the city that day and asked if we would like a cocktail. We asked if we can have a cocktail with a mezcal even though there were none listed in the menu. We were told that hey are only offering the drinks on the menu - with all kinds of other alcoholic beverages but non with Mezcal!!! The lady explained that she is not sure how mezcal would mix with the rest of the ingredients said that she will see what she can do and walked away. Someone brought two drinks about 5 minutes later and I'm so sorry to say that they tasted disgusting- I'm not even sure I tasted any mezcal in them. WTF?! At that point, after one sip of out drinks, we just got up and left. On top of it all, the same waiter that came to speak to us before the owner walked up to us and asked if we paid our bill!

However the service was mediocre, even though it was empty at our unneeded reservation time of 11:30am. This place is overpriced, the menu is small and basic for a ""Tulum inspired place"". Nothing Mexican about this place besides the rack of tequila. Bathrooms were super clean and the restaurant is very picturesque. I would definitely return mid to late night for drinks with friends but don't bring your empty stomach, just bring your best outfit.",,,
135,Juan Diego V.,"New York, NY",112,1,0,5.0,8/14/2018,"Amazing spot to have drinks, dinner or even to hang with friends. Authentic Tulum feeling in the middle of the city. Amazing vibe and beautiful people. Totally recommend it!",,,
136,Abraham Z.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,8/14/2018,"One of my favorite places to eat, drink delicious cocktails, and enjoy the music. Gitano has brought the unique vibe of Tulum in to NYC, where you can experience and enjoy an open space with palm trees. Worth noting that this restaurant hosts some of the best events with the best looking crowds and big celebs. If you are looking for a vibrant space with exceptional food, drinks, service, and a cool and good looking crowd, Gitano is the place to go!",,,
137,Jim J.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,1.0,7/7/2018,Place is very bad. Small plates. Huge prices. Don't come here. I warned you!!!! so angry that my friends brought me here....,1,,
138,Layla B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,7/6/2018,Yelp is for haters.  My new favorite spot! Have been numerous times and had great food and great service at Gitano NYC.  Vibe is unlike anything in NYC.  Check it out for yourself.  PSA- for those complaining about the hours/door policy- It was told to me that it's due to community board regulations,1,,
139,Nicholas M.,"Westmount, Canada",0,15,0,1.0,7/1/2018,"Do not go. If you do stay for a quick drink and for people watching. Apart from that service is HORRIBLE, they loose reservations and the food. Oh the food. Stay away, I feel like the should refund everyone's Uber and change the name to AllBad.",1,,
140,Jamie G.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,3,0,5.0,8/4/2018,"Best spot in the city. The place is phenomenal. Felt like I escaped the city. The ambiance is great. The best part was the manager, Malic!!!",,,
141,Sarah K.,"Manchester, United Kingdom",3,1,0,2.0,7/6/2018,This is a terrible restaurant to go to. The drinks are fine but everything is premade because it is a pop up. Food is all good and soggy and the chips are stale. I would suggest going only for drinks and ambiance but Dave yourself the $$$ and skip the food.,,,
142,Sonali N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,3.0,7/8/2018,Great ambience. Decent drinks. Skip the food. Or if you are really hungry eat some guacamole and really just skip the rest of the menu. Our servers were really sweet and overall the staff is polite and accommodating. The food just doesn't cut it by New York standards.,,,
143,J. L.,"New York, NY",20,87,5,1.0,6/29/2018,"Horrible. This place is literally outside on a parking lot on a corner of the street in which leads into the Holland Tunnel. This makes for a loud, gross and trafficky vibe. Drinks and food are nothing special. Skip!",,,
144,Bruce J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,7/20/2018,"second visitthe first time we went to Gitano i must say our experience was mixed. it was the second week that it was opened and they were running on limited drink and food menu. service was spotty and the overall experince was mixed. we returned last night for a revisit and were blown away by our experience. the server we had was super attentive and all star. the night wass perfect and the food was delicious as well as well timed and efficient. the menu is a bit limited but all the dishes we had were well done and delicious. it seems like there was an exponential increase in staffing which seems to have helped and they seem to have worked out a lot of the kinks in a ""pop up"" my concern is now that its found its groove it will become too popular and crowded. definitely worth a retrybruce j",,,
145,Freddy P.,"Bronx, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,7/11/2018,Awesome spot! Would return no question about that. Jason provided great services.,,,
