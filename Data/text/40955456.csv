I love to get up early in the morning but I wanted to chill in bed here. Super cool bar / restaurant downstairs. Good food and really good looking people. Great lounge / lobby, which considering the location, makes a big difference. There is no place in SoHo to hang out - unless you stay here. Me gusta mucho.",,,
1,catherine r.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0,1.0,9/29/2018,Was waiting for a girlfriend staying at the hotel in the lobby and the manager essentially kicked me out. Very weird experience and incredibly rude staff. He was very aggressive towards me. My mother in law had a similar experience last winter when she stayed there with the staff being very rude. Unfortunate as the room are actually quite nice and the location very central. Wouldn't recommend staying here.,,,

Even when staying at the Mercer I like having lunch, and hanging in the lounge area. The suites are modern, comfortable, and nice, the standard rooms vary a bit from what I've experienced but always have a fresh modern feel, a nice lounge area, and the shampoo, conditioner, etc that are provided smell amazing.",,,

4,deborah w.,"Rancho Mirage, CA",682,16,2,1.0,2/22/2018,"Hello, we were at the Mercer Kitchen last week on a slow afternoon meeting with friends who were staying there. After a lovely, late lunch downstairs, the heat got to be a bit overwhelming, so while my friends and family finished their coffee and paying the check, I went upstairs to cool down.I went in the lobby lounge to sit and was immediately asked if I was a guest, I said ""no, but my lunch date is."" ""What's their name?"" the young man in a blue shirt demanded rudely.I gave him one of my friends last name which he instantly returned to tell me,""we have no one staying here by that name.""I told them that I wasn't sure which name they had given, and they would be coming upstairs in the next few minutes and they could ask them.""Im sorry, but you can't sit here, you'll have to leave.""Here I am, a small, 63 year old woman with multiple shopping bags, and a heavy coat.""Ok, where can I sit?""""You'll have to stand in the restaurant or go back downstairs.""What?So, I got up, picked up my things and walked into the restaurant, where I told the hostess what had occured, she shook her head apologetically, and sweetly offered me an empty chair while I waited all of three minutes. When my friends joined me, I told them what had happened. They told me that I should tell management. I walked the 30 feet back over to the blue shirt, male, skinny, brown haired, lobby server in his late twenties, that had told me to leave, with my friend behind me as witness.I walked up to him and told him he was rude, he said in an arrogant, ingenuine manner, ""I'm sorry you feel that way.""""Yes, I said, you ARE sorry... And rude and disrespectful, and definitely not a credit to this establishment.""I then asked him for his name, which he refused to give with a smirk. Meanwhile, my family and friends, also overheated from the stuffy downstairs, had headed out on the street to walk. At that point,  I didn't care enough to follow up on his name, or to report him at the time, but my friend said he would do it later. Mercer Hotel Lobby Staff -Rude, arrogant, disrespectful, nothing warm or generous here.",2,1,

7,Mizz G.,"Oakland, CA",0,23,0,5.0,5/26/2018,"My new favorite hotel in manhattan / soho. My regular place was sold out and I wanted something close to my office at bway and spring. The cost was over my budget, but since I've enjoyed the restaurant in the past (Mercer kitchen), I thought I'd give it a try. The rooms are like vaults: High ceilings, thick walls, double paned windows, tight shades. I slept so deeply that when I woke up I thought it was the middle of the night, but in fact, I'd overslept and the sun was shining outside when I lifted the shades. The marble bathroom and deep tub were glorious. I was very happy skipping to work a few doors down. Service is incredibly important to me and can make or break a stay. Thank you to the staff for making my night there a very pleasurable experience. I'll def be back.",,,

I'll be back!",2,,
11,Mia M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,97,5,3.0,6/12/2017,"I'm no longer a New Yorker, so it's very odd to stay in various hotels, but it really is a great insight to stay as a guest as opposed to a visitor for drinks or dinner or visiting a friend who's come to town. I also have alot of NYC hotel experience after working behind the scenes for 10 years. So I can be very forgiving, but also do believe in value.Check in was pretty easy, and the staff very helpful and warm. The standard room is fairly small, with really no where to put your luggage. The table and the chair take up any floor space at the foot of the bed. We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and a cupcake and nuts and a bowl a fruit, which was nice, though the one orange was moldy...as in deep green and fuzzy on the bottom. The light fixture above the table was hanging by a broken ring about ready to plotz at any moment. Upon further inspection, i realized that many things in the rooms are severely dated and are 'rigged' to work, rather than properly installed. I wish I remembered to take a picture.The bathrooms are roomy enough, but no hooks outside the shower to put your towel or robe. Also, no tub; at least not in our room. I used to eat at Mercer Kitchen alot like a decade ago, but since then , the food has become really mediocre. Everything I had (breakfast or lunch - no dinners here) was not very memorable or exceptionally flavored. My kale salad was heavy on the lemon and had nary a crouton in sight, the fish tacos were meh, the fries weren't very crispy. It wasn't awful food, but it did not merit the pricepoints. My greatest complaint and hence probably the main reason for star deduction is their GYM situation. I totally get that they don't have a gym, and that's fine, but 24 hr Fitness is the worst choice in gyms. Not only is the gym absolutely funky and janky, but I was actually told at their desk that I had to pay $30 to work out b/c I was out of state. Why have an agreement with a gym that has that policy? After questioning why I wasn't asked that the day before, the woman barked back at me that it was their policy and that's that. I called Mercer front desk and the woman was in shock and asked to talk to ""the manager"", who then was berating HER on the phone. This all happened as a man walked in to tour the facility and then said to me ""if this is what this gym is like I don't want to be a member here"". THis whole process took maybe 25 minutes. I only had 45 mins to work out that day and 25 mins were taken up by a miserable woman who hates her job and who , in the end , didn't even apologize for her behavior. I cant remember her name, but I will find out and update this review. I really believe that when you're paying over $500 a night for a room, you shouldn't  have to go through a process like this. Why not partner with Equinox - it's just as close. Chelsea piers is the other option (which is great - i used to be a member), but is far. Overall, everything was pretty smooth and I do like the Mercer. It's close and convenient to my old haunts, friends, restaurants and fave spots, so I will continue to go here, but I really encourage them to step up and update a few things and most of all, dump 24 hr fitness!",,,
12,Corey A.,"London, United Kingdom",0,2,0,2.0,3/7/2015,"Nice setting but the food was just poor. Not bad. Just poor. Especially for what it cost. I had the salmon which came out bland tasting of not much other than the mash it was sat on. And a side of asparagus. That basically had been boiled them straight to my plate. Removing all taste. And only 5 full tips for $7 was the greatest side dish rip off I've had in NYC so far. We were also unlucky to get a pokey little table tucked next to the servers register. Handy for getting the servers attention, which I had to do for anything I wanted. I'm sure we were just unlucky. As it seems this place is a favourite for a lot of people.",1,1,
13,Lori J.,"Atascadero, CA",5,37,6,1.0,9/16/2015,"No. Just no. Utterly pretentious, lacks any charm or features worth writing about. Or paying for. A hotel that doesn't even have any signage? Please. Get over yourself. The check-in desk is hidden by - A BRICK WALL. The lobby is so dark, you feel like a flashlight is needed to find the damn elevators. The room is a white, stark box. Nothing that sets it apart. The linens - maybe 300 ct. The mattress? Mediocre. Bath products were nice. Room service came without a tab to sign, so no idea what you paid. The whole thing was just eye-rolling-ly lame, itcould easily be made into an SNL skit.",8,6,1

It's was a nice gesture to receive a whistle when I walked in however I have no idea who it was? So it doesn't really count. Flattered though.

It felt pretentious and, since I was here for my wedding and had family/friends/vendors meeting me in the room, it got pretty annoying to have to reach out to everyone to let them know how to find the dumb secret door.Hate the decor. I guess it's trying to be hip and minimalist, but I thought the rooms just ended up looking like someone had just moved in and hadn't had time to furnish the place. As another user pointed out, the lack of a coffee pot was annoying. Excellent service, as should be expected, but overall not worth the price tag.",2,,

25,Caron W.,"Manhattan, NY",329,5,0,5.0,8/18/2011,"I surprised my boyfriend with a night at The Mercer for his birthday. I loved it and so did he. Check in and check out was all of 2 minutes. When I arrived the hotel concierge asked if it was my first time staying with them and since it was, she said she'd like to show me around. She took me to my room and showed me how to work everything, where remotes and lights were etc. There was a beautiful exotic magenta flower and three different cookies waiting for me with a hand written welcome note. Ahhh the little things.... Moving on, I told her my boyfriend was coming and I was about to give her back one of the keys to leave for him and she insisted on just making another one. The Bose stereo that comes with the room wasn't working and so they sent someone up about 10 minutes later to adjust it. We had a room overlooking Mercer Street and you couldn't hear a sound, unless you open your window of course. The rooms decor is a simple clean finish. The bathrobes are soooooooooo comfy and luxe. We had a couple of drinks at the Mercer Kitchen downstairs. I loved the atmosphere. Low key, not too dark and not too stuffy. In the morning we ordered room service for breakfast and called valet to have our car ready. Everything was seamless and awesome. Stay at The Mercer.",10,,2

Thickest French toast ever and it was amazing. The bowl of yogurt with granola and berries was massive and just as good. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever been in.

The bed is also very comfortable and nice.The breakfast was average, but I did really appreciate the assortment of teas. Also, the Mercer Kitchen downstairs looked really cool and would probably be worth trying for dinner.I feel like this place is really all about their lofts, which are pricey and once housed Marc Jacobs.I'm not sure what other hotels are around Soho but I'm going to look into it the next time I'm in New York.",,,
33,Pinky And The B.,"Manhattan, NY",849,1467,5796,4.0,5/7/2011,disclaimer- it has been several years since I have been here. It has great ambiance and great decor and the famous Jean George restaurant Mercer Kitchen which we have been to maybe 5 times. yelp.com/biz/mercer-kitc…The rooms are uber chic and the beds and bathtubs and in room fire places are all modern and very clean! I only know about the penthouse suites and have only been in them not in the standard rooms. They are large and have a feel of being in a Soho loft. But the penthouse rooms are super expensive but worth it. If I were a tourist and could afford it this would be my choice.The Mercer has a reputation for catering to celebrities. I think they must choose this hotel because the security is great only matched by the Sofitel in midtown and has  a privacy that other hotels seems to escape in NYC.,,,1

37,Simone G.,"Los Angeles, CA",7,59,1,4.0,7/1/2010,"Ignore the paparazzi out front and people in the lobby and focus instead on the bookcase therein to the right of the front desk. Every time I stay here I lament that I fail to clandestinely leave a memento of Salinger's, Seuss's or Exupery's on this rad bookcase. Do yourself a favor and make an intellectual contribution-to your mind, the bookcase, or both-and peruse.Cookies in the room upon check in are yum. (I always wrap them up and hook up the first homeless person I see once I make my premiere  on Prince St.) Bathrooms are sleek, marble, and when in a suite, have a big, separate rainshower showerhead divorced from the oversized  bathtub.  Windows have light canceling electronic curtains which help if you're channeling Hunter S. Thompson, binging or depressed; otherwise, keep 'em open and enjoy SoHo's chameleonizing  concert of sights and sounds. I-pod dock, gucci bedding and fresh flowers luxe out the stay.Low key hallways with benign lighting and full length mirrors spackle any leaks in a punctured ego, inasmuch the ridiculously good looking staff which treats you with deference. The uniforms of the latter are a strike for me though, mildly Jane Jetson-ish. I think you can exude an air of professional style sans the convent-like threads. Lastly, the valets, oft-overlooked, are money, and deserve to be in receipt of yours via a hefty tip. Out of all the staff, they are the most hyper-aware of the deal-making details. To elaborate, after a couple in and outs, they began to recognize my gait and silhouette approaching  (or tripping in my heels in the damn cobblestone streets) half a block away.  Silently bragging via a preempted open door, a smile, and a nod of the head, they will give you a mile if you give them the requited inch of respect and acknowledgment they so deserve.",,,

The hotel itself is wrapped around a small seating area/garden that can be accessed from some of the rooms on I do believe the second floor.The Mercer is very expensive, yet in my opinion is one of the only premium hotels in the city that makes you feel like you are getting exactly what you paid for. Tons of people seem to mention the celebrity factor, which has been my experience, but go for the experience, not the people watching.

Night or day, the lobby always had lovely people hanging out and, oddly enough, everyone seemed so relaxed... or maybe it was just us.

43,Aaron K.,"San Francisco, CA",40,93,0,5.0,10/23/2007,"Location, aesthetic, clientle, staff, and kitchen-wise, this is a top contender for where best to stay in NYC.  First and foremost, the lobby is small, classy and cozy.  Refreshingly small actually, as is the trend w/ a lot of modern hotels (think Gramercy Park or even Ws).  It lets high profile guests slip in and out rather quickly and inconspicuously, but also offers a few comfy places to saddle up and read a magazine.  Or you could just go straight to the Mercer Kitchen, a place that usually merits a reservation.  But if you're nice to the hotel staff, they'll make an exception and get ya in there.  And it sort of goes without saying that the Mercer Kitchen is a fine-fine place to eat; the upstairs feels sort of brasserie-chic, the downstairs a bit more intimate if not formal.The rooms are quality all the way, and the furnishings from the sheets to the toiletries are the result of thought and attention.  I didn't notice whether or not there was a concierge, but even if there was it would have been unnecessary because the staff at least seem like locals and never let me down. And of course, the location is prime.  So what more is there to say?  This place is pure metro-cool, a class act that doesn't overcompensate.  If you want a cool hotel in the heart of cool-town full of coolios, shell out the bucks and go here.",2,,2

I think I didn't even notice a neck. Shortly after the mysterious gentleman had checked in, my friend walked up to the front desk, asking: say, did I just see George Lucas? And them, being the good, well-trained staff that they are, politely declined.Oh, and my room? Let's put it this way: the only tiny unplesant thing about it was that the dimmer made the stylish main light hum at a clear, audible frequency. Your ears might not even hear that, so you can go ahead and give the place 5 instead of my 4.5 stars.",2,,1
45,Devon O.,"Atlanta, GA",235,98,12,5.0,6/8/2010,"At this very moment,  my spoiled baby princess self is propped up in a luxuriously made bed, sipping room service coffee and gazing out onto a bamboo garden courtyard with a small table and chairs placed for my enjoyment.  The morning sunlight is filtered through the soft, thin stalks of bamboo and the city skyline.  It's nearly 1130am and I should be hoofing through the streets, in search of shopping or museums or other high-urban diversions.  But you can imagine why I don't want to leave.I arrived two hours before check-in time but they put a hurry on my room while I tucked my legs underneath me on a blue velvet sofa and had a vodka thyme lemonade.   A small plate of warm cookies and a handwritten note welcoming me was on the table when I walked in.I really could not care less about seeing celebrities or anything like that, but there was some strangely beautiful, spindly-legged girl draped over an armchair while some russian dude read her for trash in the lobby when I came in.  And everyone was staring.  So I dunno. I'm a lucky girl. Oh!  And the shower wand thinger tickles.  I had never seen one before and it startled me when I turned it on.",4,5,7
46,Elizabeth B.,"San Francisco, CA",14,65,0,5.0,10/17/2007,"Great people watching!Whenever we travel to NYC and have and a little extra cash to drop we stay at the Mercer. It's an ideal location if you love to shop because it's in the heart of Soho which is shopping central and close enough to Broadway so you can catch a cab easily. We always, always see celebs in the lobby having drinks so if you're into that you should at least stop by for cocktails. Great rooms, not too small and a nice staff to boot. I feel extra special staying here because you really get the vibes from the city and the flavor from the street vendors. I can't recommend it enough.It's  one of my favorite hotels.",2,,1
47,Abigail M.,"Seattle, WA",19,47,4,5.0,1/15/2008,"Worth every single cent- which is quite a few cents. This hotel embodies, for me, what a luxury hotel should be. -perfect location in the center of SoHo-Friendly reception staff, but not too friendly-beautiful entryway with a very nice lounge-extremely comfortable, large (for NYC) rooms, high thread-count sheets-luxurious shower/bath, love the huge shower head + FACE Stockholm bath products-Great bar/ restaurant downstairs with a bartender who knows what he's pouring and good foodIf you have a few extra $$ to stay here, do it.",2,,1
48,JoAnna S.,"Des Moines, IA",11,24,0,4.0,10/31/2007,"A dear friend recently took me here for dinner. WOW. I had the chicken and it just melted off the bone. The green beans were fantastic. I also had the corn pudding on the side and it was a bit runny...I think I still prefer grandma's version better. Dessert was the real winner. I had some hazelnut type thing...I don't even remember. It was amazing though. Oh and the ice cream that came with the desserts!! oy!! heaven. Riesling ice cream?! yum!! I wanted to order a second dessert. Great service, great atmosphere, and fantastic food.",2,,1
49,Jen S.,"Modesto, CA",21,42,2,5.0,7/22/2010,"I love this boutique hotel! All of the rooms I have stayed in have been perfect and the beds are so comfy! The staff is awesome and they will take care of whatever you may need-they even packed my suitcase one time in a last minute rush to the airport! Even if you cant stay here stop by and hang out in the lobby grab a drink:) In addition, the restaurant has awesome food and good drinks. The shrimp salad and split pea soup are my fav so far!",2,1,1

Very nice crowd, almost like you're at a private party. Great place to relax if you like the 35 and older, ""thoughtful"" type.",,,

54,Scott Y.,"Cedar Rapids, IA",358,472,270,4.0,10/30/2009,"I went to The Mercer Hotel for drinks at the bar downstairs.  The place is pretty nice.  The decor is impressive.  The bartenders are attentive, quick, and know how to mix a drink.  The only real issue that I had was the layout.  Standing at the bar, I kind of felt like I was standing in the middle of people's dinners.",1,1,1
55,Ellis T.,"Colorado Springs, CO",23,25,0,4.0,9/23/2011,"This review is for The Kitchen at The Mercer Hotel... Went there for dinner last night... I was 45 minutes late for our reservation and we only had to wait 5 minutes for a table which I was happy about since I expected to wait longer (on a Thursday night)... The drinks were good and strong. I had a Ginger Margarita and a Pineapple Mojito-both were really tasty! I ordered the NY Strip with Gingered Shitake Mushrooms and Caramel Soy Infused Sauce and french fries. I ordered it well done and it was really pink, but since it tasted good, I let it slide-I have to say there was quite a bit of fat which I didn't love but the sauce it's drizzled in was REALLY good. It came with a few pieces of broccoli rabe which were cooked to perfection and the french fries, were basic. My friend had the Loberster which they liked but thought it could be seasoned a little better. We also got a side of mac & cheese and it was so-so, absolutely nothing special about it and we didn't even eat it all. For dessert, I had the Green Apple Pavlova with Sweet Basil Seed Vinaigrette which I LOVED! It had a meringue cake with what I think was apple flavored ice cream and thin slices of apple on top and it was all in this sweet shell. Overall, it was a great meal, the decor was nice and pretty standard for an NYC restaurant.",,,
56,Sam P.,"New York, NY",1877,875,636,5.0,2/5/2006,"Does anyone else immediately feel like a celebrity when eating here or going to the bar?  I actually have stayed here once with my parents, long ago before moving to New York, and all I remember was that the rooms were somewhat small, but awesomely decorated and that there was a little container on the nightstand that said ""The Mercer: Details"" on it and had breath mints, q-tips, a sewing kit, and a condom in it.  At 14, this was the coolest thing I had ever seen.  Now that I'm a New Yorker (or at least calling myself one), I've eaten here a couple of times and it can only be described as an orgasmic experience.  Unbelievable food and unbeatable, sophisticated, elegance and surroundings.  Expect a wait on weekends, and to pay at least $50/person but it's worth it.  And did I mention I saw Gwyneth there?  Need I say more?",,1,1

59,Nana H.,"Houston, TX",72,441,11,5.0,4/2/2007,"I stayed here for a week while doing a shoot for my work. My boss stays here all the time, so when i booked my room under his name, they thought i was him, I had a bottle of wine and the corner suite waiting for me when i checked in. It was a great luxurious experience, expect when i stayed there were no celebrities.  My room was not small- even for 2 people, our bathroom was a good size and we had plenty of room to lounge in our room. I loved having a little balconey that over looked soho, it felt very european. I had high expectations on their decor, it was a little too minimalist and modern for me. I had dinner downstairs, and our waitress was the worst i've ever had. She didnt know anything, we didnt have water for about an hour, and she fucked up our orders. The food arrived and we were really unimpressed with the favors, and presentation. They did however have good drinks. When I told the waitress to charge the room, she didnt even do that  correctly, because my room never got charged!",2,1,1
60,Sandy B.,"London, United Kingdom",77,557,40,4.0,2/25/2008,"my favorite hotel in new york! i know there's ultraluxury hotels with that old world charm bit, and i like those too, but this place feels like a home away from home. the rooms are done in such good taste, high ceilings, just so comfortable. i like that the lobby is reserved for guests so you don't have a bunch of obnoxious tourists wandering around gawking. the room service is one of the best i've had...so delicious! the staff are all friendly and laid back... not overbearing or pretentious at all. i'd say the only place that needs improvement is their 'concierge', but that's about it. i just adore this place. you just can't beat the location either.",2,,1
61,Lena K.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,9/25/2007,"GREAT location in SoHo, beautiful rooms, best hotel staff, delicious breakfast and a warm, friendly lounge. My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at The Mercer the weekend after fashion week (13-16 Sept 07). The lobby area was a great place to sip drinks while looking at gorgeous people (models) passing by. Kate Bosworth was a guest and Whoopi Goldberg walked by while we were having a nicotine break at the hotel bench outside. Last time we visited The Mercer we had breakfast next to Calista Flockhart and Harrison Ford... I asked for an adaptor at the reception desk and two adaptors were delivered within 5 minutes to our room! It did not feel uptight and stiff as other luxurious hotels can seem, we felt very welcomed and well taken care of during our stay. One of the major Norwegian newspapers wrote a review summer 2007 where they wrote that the only thing bad about the hotel was that the beds were too soft - we don't agree - we have not slept this good with jetlag anywhere else in the US ever. The breakfast at The Mercer is expensive but well worth the money - especially the omelette with cheese and the tiny extremely tasty tomatoes. Yummy! We will definitely go back to The Mercer - just have to save up first!",1,,
