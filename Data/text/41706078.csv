2,Jazmine A.,"New York, NY",54,93,104,5.0,10/3/2017,"Signed up for Au Bon recently for the free lunch for my birthday, but man oh man, they may have stolen me from Panera . Free lunch, breakfast, mug and discounted treats within the span of a week!? Shiiiid lol don't have to tell me twice, plus the young ladies who work at this location are super sweet!

3,Jennifer L.,"Queens, Queens, NY",21,7,1,2.0,9/21/2018,"Not a good experience to me. I once tried the chicken avocado bread at one of the Au Bon Pain and I loved it alot therefore i came to this location for the same signature chicken avocado. However, it tasted no where as good as the one I tried at different location. The chicken shredded was rather dry and messy. I couldn't even taste the avocado since there was only 1/4 of the avocado there. The sandwich was messy but the guy didn't bother to fix it up but just gave me anyways. I will not come back. Sandwich tasted average but not worth the price (almost 12 dollars)",,,
4,Caroline B.,"New York, NY",449,1226,32,4.0,9/7/2016,"I never really thought much of this Au Bon Pain--the only made-to-order items there are the sandwiches, and they don't have a lot in the way of gluten free offerings.  However, today, I had a fantastic experience. For a particular weekly meeting, it is a tradition to have cookies, and I have branched out from our internal caterers to get them from outside sources.  With ABP around the corner, I gave them a try once before, and the team asked to have them again.  When I popped by this afternoon, there were no chocolate chip cookies left.  While I was planning on getting some red velvet, oatmeal, and toffee anyway, I knew chocolate chip should be in the bakery box as well.  The cashier had the head baker come out who talked to me for a moment and then made an entire batch of cookies for me.  I went back to my desk briefly and returned to pick up the fresh chocolate chip cookies plus a few each of the aforementioned flavors.  Twenty cookies plus a satisfactory gluten-free brownie came out to $40--not bad!The staff at ABP went above and beyond the call in terms of customer service, and I was blown away.  Many thanks to them for making this meeting a success, baking fresh cookies for me, and bringing smiles to my colleagues' faces.",3,,1
5,Chrissy L.,"Bronx, NY",367,17,6,1.0,10/13/2017,"What I wrote to the company:Good Morning to all,I am sorry but my comrades and I have had enough of your 59th and Lexington location. I do not even know where to start. This location is never open on time and if on the rare occasion it never has half the store items ready.  The employees throw everything out or put it away an hour early before closing which defeats the purpose of the company having a 9 pm closing time here. I have even walked in on one of your mangers speaking vulgar language and throwing store items at who seem to be a teenage employee while other customers and I were in the restaurant but fled out of fear we would get hit by something.  A lot of your employees here are rude and have terrible attitudes. Today I walked in and paid for a half burnt sandwich because your employee at the sandwich station (at approximately 6:21 am) let my croissant sit in the oven 23 seconds too long. And I know because I counted with a watch! The croissant was obviously burnt but the manager who was nice enough to take it out of the oven (as your employee neglectfully ignored it) still gave me the half ass product. I will not be a customer at any of your locations until this issue is rectified. This store is attached to prominent law firms, this is totally unacceptable. Please hire unto par employees or leave your location vacate so a responsible business can assist the clientele of 599 Lexington ave and beyond. I understand the corporation or management at this location may not be aware so I am writing this statement. Immediate action needs to take place. Good day,Christine E.C. Walker",2,2,

Updated review","This place has such a great staff.  Particularly Crystal who is the most pleasant and quickest register personnel.  She embodies ""service with a smile"".  The only suggestion I would have is that recently a change was made in the way one checks out.  I would say this current method is not efficient time-wise.  It was much quicker, and less of a hassle when you had the register staff swipe your card for you.  Other than that, this place is very nice.  Clean and friendly atmosphere.  There is another female employee who usually does the breakfast, I forget her name, but she is Hispanic and very courteous as well.  Keep up the good work atmosphere, I enjoy it greatly and appreciate it.",,,1
7,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,1116,19810,5.0,6/7/2015,This place is great on a Sunday for a light lunch. The employees are so friendly and fun! The music is great. Seating is limited. On Sunday no need to worry! I ate my sandwich that was fixed special for me due to my allergies. They went out of their way to accommodate. What a nice crew. They gave me the OK to take their pictures to post on YELP. I didn't ask names. Maybe that is good for security reasons. Go in and say hello! They were working hard to keep everything stocked and clean. If you don't want to deal with people you can order by Computer Express. They told me there are two Au Bon Express restaurants. This one and the one at Madison and 47th. Limited seating in the window. I'll be back!,1,1,1

Unfortunately the guy making them overcooked everything meaning everything was dry as a bone (including the eggs). Fortunately, the cashier didn't have a clue either and only rang us up for one sandwich.So my breakfast was crappy, but I only paid half price. Fair enough.",1,1,1

Updated review","This Au Bon Pain has far and away the best customer service of anywhere in NYC--and I've been in NYC for almost 2 decades.  The manager goes above and beyond to thank and greet customers and ensure that they are appreciated, and the rest of the staff is very kind and nice. (I grew up with Chick-fil-A, which is legendary for great customer service, but this Au Bon Pain is much better than the NYC locations.) Plus the food is great; there are plenty of healthy options and wide selection.I like the online pickup option- you just order at aubonpain.com and your order is ready and sitting there, perfectly packed, within 10 minutes, and there's no wait or anything. Perfect.",,,

17,Leslie R.,"New York, NY",109,26,0,1.0,2/24/2017,"I stopped in today to grab a sandwich for lunch.  While waiting at the prep counter, the customer next to me asked one of the men behind the counter (Corey) to exclude bacon from his sandwich.  Corey then commented, ""My mother always told me, 'Do you know what is a Jewish dilemma?  Free bacon."" I was stunned as I didn't order a side of Anti-Semitism with my lunch.  And for those that are not Jewish or don't understand why this is offensive, his comment plays into the stereotype of Jews as cheap (also, many Jews choose not to eat pork for religious reasons.)  Upon getting back to my desk, I immediately called the manager, Christian, who informed me that, ""The customer is always right.""  Christian didn't even care to hear what exactly his staff member had said.  In fact, I had to ask him repeatedly if he wanted to know what the offensive comment actually was.  He finally asked but didn't really understand once I told him.  After going around in circles I finally gave up and informed him that I would NEVER be eating at this restaurant again and would be contacting corporate as this type of discriminatory behavior is unacceptable.",5,,
18,Daniela P.,"New York, NY",135,202,101,4.0,3/9/2016,"I've been to this Au Bon Pain several times. Au Bon Pain is like Panera Bread in that their food doesn't really vary from location to location but the service sure does! This location has got to be one of the best Au Bon Pain's I've visited, because as most others have noted, the staff here are incredibly attentive and nice!As soon as I walk through the door, the cashier is greeting me and welcoming me in! I usually keep it simple (just a bagel with cream cheese and an iced coffee), so I can't really comment on their sandwiches/etc.. However, I have had several of their menu items at different locations and have never been disappointed, so I wouldn't be afraid to try something if I were you. Chances are high that it'll be good!The cooks/food preparers are always friendly and welcoming. They take each order seriously and attend to each customer with patience and sincerity (which is rare). For the several times that I've been here, there haven't been tons of people. The max that I've seen has been around 10 people maybe? They don't have tables, but they do have counters along their windows with several benches, so it's definitely a good place if you like people-watching (but not a good place if you have a phobia of people watching you eat). The coffee area is always organized and clean (along with the entire bakery). The cashier is quick and kind and always says ""How are you today?"" and ""Hope you have a good day!"", which to some people may seem predictable and expected, but with the hustle and bustle of NYC, whenever I hear those words from someone who has to deal with hundreds of people a day, it makes me smile and appreciate them more. It's definitely a good place to visit for breakfast or lunch, if you're visiting or working in the area. Would I suggest going out of your way to come here? Probably not, but that's because it's a franchise. If you're visiting and want a real taste of NYC, go to any deli and get a bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel/roll. Those are the best breakfast sandwiches you can get for under $5. I would mostly suggest coming here for the friendly staff! The food is good and cheaper than most other places, which is a plus. They also have free wi-fi, so high five for that! Also, now they have incorporated the self-checkout Kiosks (like several Panera Breads in NYC), so that's definitely a plus!",1,1,1

So, I was a bit indecisive on what sandwich I wanted; knowing this the guy behind the counter took my friends order looked at me and said she's not ready yet take the next customer (1st rude comment, I let that go). Next, I put in the same order as my friend but changed my bread and I asked for no tomatoes (the guy rolls his eyes). My friend asks for spring mix and he reaches for the lettuce, so my friend tells him ""no not that one the other one"" (which was the mix). The guy looks at my friend and says ""spring mix not lettuce"". By this moment I'm already annoyed by his rude behavior and sassy comments. I also ask for lettuce as well and this is when he tells me ""you should know what you want"".

49,Ashley D.,"Houston, TX",0,23,0,4.0,6/29/2013,"Great quick place, not real seating.  Price is right and reasonable.  No drink selection though, no dr pepper.  Good, healthy, filling food, I am willing to go back again soon.  They do offer a free meal for your birthday if you sign up for their email club.",,,
