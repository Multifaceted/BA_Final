0,,2/12/2018,29,,"Manhattan, NY",David F.,600,3.0,83,"Not much to look at from the outside (or inside), Le Glacier is a place to get a decent albeit unspectacular smoothie or other frozen/cool treat. Prices are average for downtown Manhattan (i.e., would be expensive most other places). There is no seating in the restaurant but it is located in the atrium of a large office building (60 Wall Street) and there is ample seating in the atrium (although tables can be at a premium during lunch time). There's no reason to go out of your way to go to Le Glacier, but if you have the urge for a smoothie while you're in or at 60 Wall Street, go ahead.",
