0,Kyle P.,"New York, NY",163,259,226,5.0,9/6/2018,"New DD opened off west street. Small shop, but fast service, convenient to work, easy in and easy out. Quality service and staff. The new Dunkin just opened last week. I will be back.",1,1,2
1,Doug D.,"Massapequa Park, NY",25,88,15,1.0,11/12/2018,"Come here everyday simply because of the convenience of it and every time I'm here ""every time"" someone's order is wrong . If there are 5 people on line 3 people's order will be wrong. I think it's comical how often people's orders get butchered I lean back and just watch while I wait For my order. Here's the deal there is one lady in there that knows what to do. The other 3 are completely useless they don't even know how to put donuts in a box. You can't make this up.",,,
2,Ariana K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,1,1.0,10/16/2018,AWFUL Experience. I do not recommend this dunkin location to anyone. They made my drink wrong Twice and served a line of 5 people after taking my order . Extremely unprofessional and disorganized. Definitely not returning and I do not recommend this location to anyone. There are two more Dunkin locations 5 minutes away it worth the walk. 1 star because zero stars wasn't an option. Disgusting experience WASTE of money.,,,
