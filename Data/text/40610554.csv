Tacos were delicious, made with fresh ingredients and rich in flavor.Ordered Ground to Glass, tasted Mexican to me, sour and sweet with cilli powder, liked it. Also tried the Guv'nor, really loved it! The exotic fragrance brought by cardamom was definitely a highlight!Would love to try the rest of the house cocktails if had a chance.",

There is a cute little back courtyard with couches & such. They have a good wine happy hour and excellent service.Definitely a good week-night drink place to unwind after work with a glass of wine.",
2,,7/28/2018,56,,"Manhattan, NY",Leng Leng Y.,141,4.0,23,"Food: I have been here several times. It is my favorite place for happy hour oysters which are one of the freshest oysters I've had (especially for happy hour) and plus they are locally sourced. The pulled pork sliders are also great! TBH the entire happy hour menu is amazing!Drinks: I cannot emphasize how good their drinks are! Happy hour drinks are $7 for such beautifully crafted cocktails--definitely the best bang for your buck! I have had all their cocktails which are exceptional, though my faves are the ground to glass and the guv'nor. Service: Attentive but not overbearing. It was never hard to get their attention and love how they offered extra pita bread for our hummus. Vibe: Casual and chill vibe. Love that this place never gets that crowded and the lighting is dim but not too dark. I also like that they have a nice little patio in the back with a skylight for the nice summer days. Whether it be date night or just chilling with your co-workers/friends, this place will fit any situation!",

Plus a nice area surrounded by other cool places to check out. Even if you do not live in the area it feels like your local. I've brought a lot of friends in here and they, in turn, have become regulars.I've been here many times on Sunday when Warren is working and always have a good time. I have also stopped by weeknights and Saturday nights where discernibly busier. Regardless of the time the bar staff are consistent and so are the cocktails. My favorites are the whiskey based Guvenor and John Lee Hooker cocktails but there are many more to try.They have a number of tasty, bar foody options such as burgers. I lean toward the veggie platter which is great option for non-meat eaters. Definitely worth checking out.",1
4,,9/3/2017,18,,"New York, NY",Brittany N.,100,4.0,80,"Love that their happy hour goes until 8! It's quite a small and intimate place. The staff was really great. My friend had ordered the happy hour sangria and our waitress topped her off because they were on their last container so why not!For food we went for the bruschetta, kale salad, meatballs and a pulled pork sandwich. The meatballs where not my favorite, felt very bready. The sandwich, however, was excellent and quite spicy! Also excellent pickles. I would definitely come back for a drink here. Nice ambiance and a late happy hour.",

Updated review",305,,"Vero Beach, FL",Zachary S.,3135,5.0,355,"More than eighty check-ins. I've been coming to The Summit for years, bringing friends and making new ones. When I have a visitor from out of town and want to go to one bar, it's The Summit. It's a bar that works for me on many levels.  As I've said in previous reviews, it is congenial and patronized by some of the nicest people around. The drinks are consistently high quality and delicious. Some are so good, you wind up drinking them too fast. Many cocktail recipes at The Summit were developed  by Greg Seider, and are very different than those found in most cocktail bars. Many are made with agave instead of simple syrup. To the extent that it may matter to you, agave has a lower glycemic index than cane sugar, and is marginally healthier in terms of metabolic and cardiac effects. Some drinks have agave infused with cardamom, cinnamon or rosemary. juices are freshly pressed and some drinks have ground clove or cardamom sprinkled on top along with a garnish of fruit or vegetable. My favorites are The Last Cocktail, The Charmaine Star and The Guv'nor.Happy hour cocktails are $7 (5:30-7:30 weekdays, 4:30-7:30 weekends). Raw bar is half price. I come here for the healthy bar food: tuna tartar on avocado in soy and mirrin sauce (with some mustard oil and wassabi), Veggie patties and the hummus vegetarian platter are must tries. They also now offer a spicy crab roll and sliders. All food is prepared at the bar. On Saturday nights there is a live DJ. But the music is good every night. Unusual playlists and not so loud as to interfere with discussions. I've Shazzamed some really esoteric songs here to add to my playlist. The best part of it all is the lack of any attitude on the part of the bar staff. Some places along Avenue C feel what it's like when you want to get into a club with a velvet rope. The Summit is very welcoming and, I say it again, draws one of the nicest crowds in the city. No hipsters here. They're down the street.",1
6,,12/19/2017,343,,"New York, NY",Erin R.,65,5.0,126,I love this bar. If only it could be picked up and plopped 3 avenues westward. Every cocktail I have tried here has been so delicious and high quality. I also really appreciate that their happy hour is on the weekends as well. Very nice atmosphere inside. Its a great bar to catch up with a friend or bring a date. Hope this place lasts forever!!,
7,,4/11/2018,25,,"New York, NY",Moranda B.,86,5.0,181,I wish leaving emojis as a review was acceptable. The drinks here are on point and the bartenders are all lovely and friendly. The bar snacks/food they provide are all satisfying especially after drinking a bit too much. Love the vibe of this place and will definitely be back.,

He's awesome , he made us some specialty cocktails that weren't on the menu . We'll be coming back just for him ! Thanks so much you truly made our night with your hospitality.",1
9,,1/27/2018,39,,"London, United Kingdom",Kelly D.,91,4.0,82,They may not serve their Moscow Mules in a copper mug but they are still quite tasty! The outdoor space in the back is nice and I love that it's open (it's covered) in Winter plus the happy hour menu was quite good - we enjoyed the buffalo chicken and pork sliders!,1
10,2,9/19/2016,255,2,"New York, NY",Cara B.,932,4.0,382,This place is pretty tiny but its great! If I lived in the area I would make it my local spot!!I went with two friends around 10PM on a Saturday night for a few drinks and appetizers. The place was packed and the atmosphere was great. We found a few seats at the bar and ordered 3 Moscow Mules to start. We took a look at the menu and decided to get the Tuna Tartare and the Pulled Pork Sliders. Both appetizers were delicious! Even the chips that came with the sliders were amazing.I would definitely recommend this place!,2
11,2,9/11/2016,165,,"Manhattan, NY",Cheryl N.,1038,5.0,292,"Great experience here last Thursday night for my birthday. I emailed them about a reservation beforehand and they got back to me quickly. You can reserve ahead for parties of10 or more. At first we had reserved the backyard, but it was so humid so they offered us the back table instead. Both spots are great for mingling. The drinks were superb and HH lasted til 8pm! The watermelon mojito was refreshing. I have to say though, my fave was the Charmaine Star. Shout out to the bartender in the back bar for excellent drinks. This place serves small bites, friends ordered the pork sliders, prosciutto, Mediterranean platter, and the tuna tartare. I have to say the tuna tartare was Amazing. One of the top 5 I have had in the city. My friends and I had a great time and they complimented me on my choice of bars. Special thanks to Shayan for being there when we needed him and making our experience enjoyable and for putting up with the balloon animals :p Great spot for small gatherings and also for date nights!",2
12,,12/9/2016,728,,"Manhattan, NY",Dana H.,1309,4.0,287,Convenient location in east village/alphabet city. Atmosphere is quaint and cozy. Nice for catching up with friends or grabbing a drink for a date. They have a special holiday cocktail that is great and has warm cider in it. Their other cocktails are pretty tasty as well. Price is about $12 per specialty cocktail and $10 for house cocktails. Went on a Tuesday night and wasn't crowded.,
13,,6/19/2018,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Phil O.,0,4.0,16,Great place for a small group and they take reservations. Cocktails are good and happy hour makes it worthwhile. Food isn't bad but to me really a place for drinks,

16,1,11/22/2016,323,2,"Wantagh, NY",Chris T.,122,4.0,344,"In search of a perfect cocktail? Make your way to Summit Bar to treat yourself. The majority of the times I have come here it was for happy hour bc it is simply too good to miss. Happy hour consists of discounted food options, a choice of $7 cocktails, and 1/2 price oysters! Quite the perfect pairing!My favorite cocktail here is the guv'nor which is summit blended whiskey, toasted cardamom infused agave, japanese yuzu juice, and orange juice. Some other favorites are the ground to glass, and the john lee hooker. I can honestly say i've never has a bad drink here.",2
17,3,10/7/2016,847,2,"Brooklyn, NY",Kenny C.,11053,4.0,3176,"Awesome cocktail bar with a modern aesthetic and experimental-within-reason cocktails. I had something pretty good with tequila in it. Don't remember what it was because I was pretty plastered, but the bartender said it was his favorite. Good guy. Their special cocktails were very reasonably priced at $12 a pop.They also have the standard classics for reasonably cheap as well.Seemed like a good crowd too on a Saturday night.",3
18,,8/14/2015,203,,"Manhattan, NY",Hannah M.,22,4.0,201,"The Summit bar was such a nice experience for happy hour on a Thursday - $6 and $7 select cocktails and wines, $4 beers, and oyster specials everyday! Can't speak for the oysters as I'm not a fan, but the cocktails my boyfriend and I had were mixed well and made with quality ingredients! We had the Charmane's Star, a cinnamon-infused cucumber cocktail, and the classic Old Fashioned (pictured below), and the Dark & Stormy. The flavor combinations in the Charmane's star were unique and subtle - recommend! The Dark and Stormy was delicious and almost tasted like a cream soda. The homemade ginger agave made for an interesting, refreshing twist. As for the atmosphere, this place isn't pretentious yet classy; featuring lots of natural light, chandeliers, exposed brick and two bars - one in front, one in the back. Perfect for catching up with a friend or a low-key date. The music selection was great too - cozy jazz The surrounding neighborhood is nothing to brag about, but it's absolutely worth the walk if you're around! Will be back to try their popular ""The Last Cocktail"" drink :)",1

20,,1/4/2018,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Vincent B.,0,4.0,7,"The cocktail menu is very good! I had the Governor and Palumbo and bother drinks were very well balanced, and the one large ice cube is definitely a nice touch! The cocktails I have to say were spot on! I also had the oysters and I believe the cuban press sandwich... both were very good. I highly recommend this East Village establishment if you like cocktails!",
21,,8/13/2016,137,,"New York, NY",Joey L.,495,5.0,283,"Came here for HH and stayed for the great atmosphere. The happy hour menu was your standard fair and cocktails were delicious. The place has a small table up front and a long bar and some more seating towards the back. It was a super laid back and the bartender was great company. He was easy to talk to and made everyone feel right at home. Charmane's star was a nice refreshing summer drink. It was light and that cucumber made it extra cool. The Guv'nor was a stronger drink, but still tasty. Honestly, if I had more time, I would've stuck around and tried more drinks. There's always next time.",
22,1,3/29/2016,101,2,"New York, NY",Kelly M.,280,5.0,154,"This review is based off of my experience at this place for a recent happy hour. So my lovely friend told me about this place since she lives right around the corner, and suggested that we venture here for a happy hour last week. I was v pumped that there was no work on Good Friday and was ready to have a few casual cocktails and enjoy some pleasant company. I had even signed up for a gym class the next morning so that I could start my day off right.Turns out, this ended up being a not so casual drinking experience, and I did not make it to my 8:00 spin class. In fact, my head was spinning until around 3:00 PM, so sad for me.The experience was definitely worth the bit of a hangover the next day though. We started the night off with a great deal on oysters: $15 for 12 large and pretty tasty oysters. We also had the prosciutto plate - $12. Although this was a decent amount of food, it was probably not a substantial enough amount to accompany the 9 drinks we were about to have.They have a very extensive happy hour cocktail menu. $7 cocktails, and I""m not just talkin vodka sodas. I actually had one of the best spicy margs I have ever had on happy hour prices, so that was fantastic. After befriending the bartenders, we found ourselves staying here for 4 hours. Definitely not what I expected going in to the night, but it was truly such a great environment that we couldn't resist! This must be one of the best happy hours around, and I highly recommend. Oh - and they extended happy hour to go until 8:00! It goes until 7:30 on weekends.",2

It's so great to have these bars in the city, which actually take pride in the drinks instead of just serving up sugary, unimaginative mixes that most places pass off as cocktails.The vibe is fun, and not pretentious or hipster. The place also has a cute, albeit very small, candlelit patio at the back. But since the patio is soo tiny, if you don't find a spot at the back, the front bar area is also quite nice with the chandeliers and exposed brick.",

I love places that hire great staff:) the bartender Jose was incredible. He knew everything and made really good drinks. Rarely you see a bartender that loves what he does. The guy also had a surprise for us - awesome magician :) deff go see Jose and ask for his tricks at the bar! Thank you Jose !,
27,,11/16/2017,299,,"Sanibel, FL",Madi D.,0,3.0,15,"Decent drinks but this place is so damn loud all the time you can't have a conversation. It's like standing front row at a punk rock concert every time I come here. Even if I'm not here to have a conversation, I'll stand away from the music and it still hurts my ears. None of my friends will come here anymore because it's so loud. But yeah the drinks are good, servers are friendly and the prices aren't bad for this area. Just bring ear plugs!!",
28,,3/25/2017,140,,"Manhattan, NY",Christine N.,290,2.0,352,"As much as I want to give this place a decent review for being so relaxed (it is in Alphabet City), I can't.I came here and had the governor drink (very good, btw) and we had the tuna tartare and hummus as snacks and I was so ill the next day that I couldn't work.  Since the alcoholic drink and the tuna tartare were all I had the night prior, I think there was something wrong with a part of the tuna tartare.  Otherwise, this place isn't so bad.  They gave a jazz old school vibe and the light bulb covers are alcohol bottles which is cute.  The bartender was also very nice and attentive. But between this place being so hard get to (Alphabet City) and my having gotten sick from the tuna tartare, I won't be visiting this place again.",

Happy hour runs everyday from 4-7 maybe 8 I forgot. The food menu is limited,  but the selections they offer is enough to keep you asking for more. (*****)They have a garden in the back, but still feels kinda cold for the winter even though they covered up. The bathroom was tight and small, but at least it wasn't dirty. (****)",
32,1,10/11/2016,0,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Ximena C.,11,5.0,20,"I had reserved the outdoor patio space for my best friends birthday. At first I only reserved it thinking it would get too warm inside for 20 of us even though we were celebrating in October. In retrospect it was the perfect selection. The space is closed off and has two heating lamps hanging above to keep everyone warm. There's an actual door that separates us from the rest of the bar so it really was like having a private party. Also, the pictures on their site don't do it justice and I of course forgot to take one - but the space is much larger than I thought it would be. With long benches and a table, there was more than enough room for me and my friends. We came on a Sunday when happy hour was in full swing, so it was a nice cheap experience. To top it off, the staff was so helpful! Kory and Warren were working that night. We had a cake that they helped me light, present and cut and even took part in some of the festivities. The ambience is super chill, the staff - reliable and overall, my bestie had the best birthday she's had in a long time. I couldn't have picked a better bar at random to celebrate at. We're definitely coming back :D",2
33,1,10/25/2017,1,1,"Manhattan, NY",Carly M.,0,5.0,1,"This is hands down my favorite bar in NYC. The Charmaine Star is a must - best cocktail in the city. Ali, the chef, makes the experience personal and enjoyable - you have to try his Veggie Burger. It's 100% vegan and has so much flavor. The oysters and pulled pork are also amazing (according to friends I've never tried). I can't recommend this place enough! Perfect for a date night or hanging with friends.",1
34,,1/27/2015,962,,"Yonkers, NY",Amanda G.,4893,3.0,883,"I love the decor and apparently, they're not busy for early week happy hours. Hubby and I came here to pre-game before a bday dinner double date with friends. I really wanted some oysters and remembered seeing a list with the best happy hours in the city. I also recalled one particular place that offered Beausoleils, which are my fave mollusk, presently. The original place that I looked up has since closed down but on their website, they mentioned The Summit Bar as being part of their business family. I immediately called to confirm that they offer my oyster of choice and hubby and I rushed downtown to partake in the ever so inviting happy hour. We arrived and found parking particularly quickly, considering the area. As I previously stated, the establishment was quite empty so we didn't have to worry about seating. The host was very amiable and welcomes us upon our entry. We sat in the back and I ordered one and a half dozen Beausoleils to enjoy all by myself My oysters arrived, freshly cleaned and shucked with a red wine vinegar mignonette and cocktail sauce. I requested some tobasco and was graciously obliged. Good stuff. So creamy and fresh. They taste like East Coast Kumamotos...so good. Hubby and I both ordered some cocktails. He had the Charmane's Star which was half priced and I opted for a Dirty Martini (not included in the HH). If they became bustier than tonight, I could definitely see issues because it took rather long to get our bill and have our bill corrected because despite the three people working behind the bar, only the hostess handled the monies. I would still love to come back. The quality of the fare and the service up to cashing out, was excellent.",
35,2,8/18/2015,352,4,"Manhattan, NY",Kathryn T.,2622,4.0,411,"It's a reaaaaallly good date spot. The patio in the back is prime for romancin'. Trust.The cocktails were good to me -- but not mindblowing. Not on The Nomad Bar's level. I had the Last Cocktail and I feel like the bartender put way too much seltzer in it. He didn't bring out the gin (or didn't put in that much... it was hard to tell). Either way, there is a good balance of what types of drinks you can get here. The vibes were dope. Like I said before, the back patio looks like it's straight out of a basic girl's perfect date night Pinterest board. It also doesn't feel like a pretentious craft cocktail bar -- a welcome change from the places in Gramercy/Flatiron that have cocktails around the same caliber. Having a conversation on Friday night in the bar is a bit of a struggle (and it gets DARK) but sitting out with friends (or a date) in the light is pretty much how everyone should spend a Friday after a long week at work. I'll definitely come back and check out happy hour.",2

Not only were the drinks on point, and the food delicious, but the bartenders were so cool with everyone in the group, that they made the party a million times better. It was awesome! If you're in the neighborhood, definitely pop by here and give this place a try, you'll be happy you did.

I had 4 rounds of oysters and they are really nice and accommodating (also surprised that a small person like me can eat a lot!). The wait for the oysters doesn't take long.

All cocktails were wonderful - and it was so nice to see they also had mocktails on the menu for our friend who doesn't drink!

I reserved that back part of the bar and when we walked in they were even nice enough to hang up a Happy Birthday banner! Hidden in the back was a more intimate private room where we ended up gravitating to. It was a wine and liquor storage room that had a single long table for large parties. The smaller room was technically outdoors but the heat lamps above made it nice and cozy for everyone. At times, it was a little too hot so I recommend only turning on one of the overhead lamps!The really gem about this place was the happy hour from 5:30pm (open) to 7:30pm and it was half priced cocktails and oysters. Non-happy prices were $12 per cocktail and $30 for a dozen oysters and getting half off was a major steal! These were the cocktails I had:The Last Cocktail x 2Born & RaisedThe John Lee HookerThe Guv'norGround to GlassHands down the best one of the lot was The Last Cocktail. Everyone in our party loved it. A friend proclaimed that it was the best cocktail he has ever had in his life! We put the bartender to work ordering so many of them! The combination of gin and prosecco was spot on!! All the other cocktails were great as well. As you can see, I put in some serious work during the happy hour. Greatest deal in the city!As for the food, it wasn't as good. The Mediterranean Platter was decent and the oysters weren't as good if you're used to eating oysters from the Gulf. Nevertheless, I would come back over and over again for those cocktails. I can't wait!",4
49,,7/24/2016,1,,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",Laura Q.,5,3.0,14,I have been here twice in the last month and both times were uncomfortably hot. The first time we had to ask them to turn on the AC. They had just opened so we figured it still needed to cool off from not being on overnight. The second time we came it was well into the evening and a hot in NYC (97F). It was hotter in the bar than outside. I was so uncomfortably hot that it made me feel sick and lightheaded. I wasn't able to finish my drink and could not bear to stay here. I wish they would invest in their air conditioning system. They have outstanding cocktails and a great vibe but I can't stand the heat. I won't be back until the summer is over.,

Secondly, watching the bartender make your drink is like observing Van Gogh paint the Starry Night.  It is a work of art, and you can tell they take their shit seriously. The Old Fashioned - try it - one of my favorites - a lustrous combination of sweet and bitter.  Third, oyster happy hour. 'Nuff said. You feel like a regular on your first visit.  The place is adorably cool. All that's missing is acoustic guitar and card gambling in some corner table under a dim light.",1

I woke up Sunday with a swollen face and my eyes practically swelled shut.  Needless to say, I had a reaction to the seafood.  I'm now questioning whether ordering tartare and happy hour oysters from The Summit is a good idea.",

The selection of artistic chandeliers were impressive. Using whiskey bottles for lamp shades? awesome. I ordered the john lee hooker. I think that's what it was called... I also wish I remembered what was in the drink. I remember big ice cubes, a cold drink, hard (but not unbearable), there must've been bitters, and I remember a splash of beer... what I remember most was an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction. I have to go back for that drink. I wish I had one in my hand right now.Edit: I googled their menu, here's the description of the amazing drink: ""Peet Monster Scotch, Buffalo Trace Bourbon, fresh lemon, orange and sasparilla bitters, topped with Hop Stoopid Beer"" yum.",

And the bartenders are cute to boot.The Charrmane's Star was one of the best vodka cocktails I've ever had. It had a wonderful sweetness, and I could taste summer around the corner. The Gingerita was also really nice and ginger-spicy. Had to dock a star because table-side service suddenly disappeared, and we had to go out of our way to get our second round and the check.

59,1,7/2/2015,127,,"Brooklyn, NY",Leslie G.,28,5.0,278,"Two words: happy hour. I came here with a friend on a Tuesday around 5:30, drank and ate until 9ish, and we each owed about 45 bucks with tip. When was the last time that happened at any cocktail bar? Possibly never.The happy hour menu has a nice selection of cocktails as well as a few beers and several food options. I stuck with drinking French 75s during the confines of the happy hour (5:30-7:30). Not only were they delicious (gin, prosecco, agave, lemon juice), but they were an excellent deal at 6 bucks each. I also had half a dozen oysters for 7.50, which were a nice complement to the summery French 75s. My friend had a couple of Dark and Stormys and the pork sliders, which she seemed to enjoy. Once the happy hour ended, I tried the The Last Cocktail (Beefeater gin, prosecco, rosemary infused agave, pear puree, lemon juice, clove dust), which was an amazing combination of peppery and sweet.I think the layout of the bar has changed slightly since some of the pictures were posted on Yelp. For example, there are no couches anymore. There are a couple of tables in the back in addition to the one in the small ""outdoor"" area, but the rest of the space is the bar itself plus long, narrow tables with bar stools at the very front by the window. In other words, I don't think it's the best space for a larger group unless you want to stand or all sit in a row. It's perfect for two people, however. Additionally, it never got crowded while we were there (granted, it was a Tuesday), and the music was audible (and good) but not so loud that we had to shout.",3

Where else would you get craft cocktails for $6? Yup, this is my new after work drinks spot! I particularly enjoyed the Governess cocktail. They also offer half priced oysters during happy hour.

There is a great little backyard area that is partially covered, and on a warm October Thursday it was the perfect place to enjoy a few cocktails. They have an extensive menu of delicious drinks, some classic like an Old Fashioned or a Moscow Mule, and others that are their signature drinks like ""Breakin' the Law."" The drinks are surprisingly ""affordable"" (about $10-12 per drink, compared to the $17-20 you may pay for the same thing elsewhere). Atmosphere is fun and friendly. Would definitely come back.",

64,2,3/23/2015,209,1,"New York, NY",Allison C.,449,4.0,1624,"I will start off by saying that The Last Cocktail is one of the best cocktails I've ever had. The aforementioned statement is bold but true. Seriously, I could not wait to say it mid-way through this review. I had to come right out of the gate with it. A combination of Beefeater Gin and Prosecco with pear puree and a dash of ground clove took me to another place. The scent of the cloves hit my nose with each sip, contrasting with the sweetness of the fruit and the tang of the carbonation on my tongue. If I didn't just make a Sallie Mae AND monthly MetroCard payment on the same day, I would have gladly dealt out another $12 for that glass of ambrosia. I hope it'll be their menu for a future visit.Okay! Backtracking...I ended up in the depths of Alphabet City for my cousin's girlfriend's big 3-0. I was expecting something divey, not knowing any background about this establishment before entering, but my earlier assumptions were blown away when I entered a sleek, dark, and sexy cocktail bar. The list of well-crafted cocktails was appealing, and it took me a while to finally decide. I did try sips of some other cocktails, such as Charmaine's Star (a popular choice amongst those in my group) and The John Lee Hooker. My hat is tipped to the excellent cocktail scientists behind the bar! Needing some food, too, the beau and I ordered some sliders: the Buffalo Chicken for him, and the Pulled Pork for me. Both were excellent, the pork being especially tender, almost a little too hot from the pot! The housemade chips served alongside of it were stellar; I could have consumed half of my weight in them. They were light and crispy with the perfect amount of salt, rosemary, and lingering oil on them. I did note a lull in the crowd around 8 p.m. after many folks were leaving after their daily Happy Hour specials, but the crowd picked right up again around 9 p.m.; we had the space in the front but moved to the back once it cleared out. Be warned: it does get tight in there, and it does get hot. Thank goodness for a small but welcomed rear covered outdoor section. The fresh air was appreciated. Sucks that I have to travel so far from my nook in Inwood to have The Last Cocktail again. At least it's worth the trip. I'm in love with The Summit Bar, absolutely.",2

Both were refreshing, but the latter was more interesting and more alcoholic (and definitely worth $1 more). They also offer a variety of Absinthes. The bartender was very friendly.",5

You'd be surprised how many places really f&%$ up the classic French 75 but this place made the best one I've ever had. Plus the bartender was super chill.

Updated review",3,,"New York, NY",L. E. S.,1,2.0,52,"Recently went back here and it is clear that Summit Bar has slipped down a notch in terms of quality and atmosphere.  Drinks here are still decent, but I felt the sugar content was on the rise. And the crowd now is a little more crop-tops and jerseys (no pun intended) than it once was.  Plus there must be some secret ingredient in the drinks that made people fart a lot.  It was like a bad Negril spring break party, but with Edison light bulbs.",
70,,12/23/2011,56,,"Forest Hills, NY",Valery C.,9215,4.0,827,"Wonderful, low-key bar way out on Ave C.  Essentially a corridor, walled in exposed brick, a very long black-topped bar with lots of bar seats, overhung with pendant lamps, and a cozy seating nook for a group in the back.  Also a small patio out back that we didn't check out b/c it was cold, but its open in winter.Creative cocktail menu, very appealing.  Classics section and ""Alchemist"" section.  Because NOLA opened my palate to whiskey cocktails, I asked the bartender for a choice with that and citrus, as my favored addition to cocktails is grapefruit.  He suggested their Guv'nor, Yamazaki 12 year whiskey with cardamom-infused agave, yuzu, and orange juice.  Delicious drink where you can appreciate the whiskey and enjoy the refreshing citrus twist.  The Shu Jam Fizz was excellent also, a great choice for someone not looking for a strong drink, but not precisely sweet either.We didn't interact much with the staff as we had a small group and sat in the nook section in the back; my limited interaction with the bartender was good although he seemed new.  Vibe was cool but very laid-back.  Great place, great drinks, well worth the trip.",
71,,1/25/2015,349,,"New York, NY",Seth B.,479,4.0,89,"Recently, I went to The Summit Bar and both my girlfriend and I were incredibly impressed with the attention to detail Summit places in creating unique cocktails. When you walk into Summit there is a large sign, behind the bar that displays their ""Alchemist Cocktails.""  These are basically the special cocktails and considering the extremely limited beer selection basically everyone orders cocktails.I ordered the ""Born & Raised.""  This consists of Honey Bush Tea Infused Famouse Grouse Scotch, Oak Cross Rinse, Dolin Sweet Vermouth, Agave, Summit Orange Bitters.  To be honest, I don't know what half of that shit is, but I like tea so, I ordered it.  Unfortunately, ordering a cocktail because you have the mentality of a dumb sorority chick who ""likes tea"" is never smart and I went wrong here because this cocktail is SO strong.  Of course, I just need to grow some hair on my chest.For the failure in this drink, I blame myself and not Summit.  The bartender who was attentive and kind took extra care in making my drink and he cut the zest of an orange, mixed, strained and shook my drink like he was giving it everything he had.Moving on, my girlfriend ordered the ""Gingerita.""  This consists of Corralejo Blanco Tequila, Ginger, Agave, Lime and Don Amado Mezcal Rins.  She loved it and ordered two.PROS:Nice venue - Summit bar is chill with nice lighting, good music and a classy, diverse crowd.Service - I watched one of the bartenders, who had a ponytail, make at least 3,000 cocktails.  He made every single one with incredible care and attention and he was never once fazed by the absurd number of people trying to order drinks.  In addition, this particular bartender was not only friend, but had great customer awareness.  At one point, he noticed I had ceased to drink and kindly poured me a glass of water.  Although simple this was thoughtful and I appreciated it.Unique Cocktails - Every single drink summit oftens seems to be a culinary experience in the world of alcohol.Food - They serve food all night.  We didn't order any though.CONS:Poor beer selection - They offer like 6 beers to choose from so, you're basically forced to drink wine or cocktails.  Granted, if you're coming to Summit I think you're coming exclusively for their cocktails.Small venue - I like the venue a lot, as mentioned above, but it's quite small and therefore, we were uncomfortably crowded at times.  However, I also did not realize that apparently there is an outdoor smoking area which I would have definitely taken advantage of.Pricey - Each cocktail is 12 dollars.  In the realm of NYC, this actually isn't pricey at all, but additional beer options would be appreciated for those who don't want 12 dollar cocktails all night.OVERALL:The Summit Bar is quite far from the upper east side which is where I generally chill in NYC however, the trip out here was totally worth it.  I'm looking forward to coming back.",2

First of all, who has happy hour on actual cocktails, let alone on a Saturday? This place does, and it is amazing.We decided to each get a cocktail and spilt a half dozen oysters to whet our appetite for our impending dinner down the street. My sister had actually never had raw oysters before, and what better chance to pop her cherry than try them when they are only $7.50 for the 6? They were offering 3 different kinds of East Coast oysters -Malpeques, Blue Point , and Beau Soleil - so we each got to try one of each. We both agreed that the Malpeques was not to our liking, but the others were great. As for cocktails, she got the Lions in London, and I tried the Gov'nor. Never one to turn down a drink with whisk(e)y, I thought mine was perfect. Sort of a mix between an Old Fashioned and a Manhattan. My (still in College) sister was not so enthused with her drink, but that has something to do with her normal drink of choice. Vodka water this is not. No matter, I was more than happy to help her finish. I loved the dark, intimate setting and it was nice being able to find 2 seats next to each other at the bar around 6pm. I imagine it starts to fill up as it gets closer to 7pm. I have already been telling my friends in NYC that we will need to come back the next time I am in town!",1

However something tells me another visit based more on food would easily get the fifth. I met my wife there recently and she waited for me for quite a while alone since I drove from uptown and traffic was hell. She said the servers were so attentive and realized she was sitting alone and waiting for a while so they were paying extra attention to her making sure she was okay. That was three stars right away. We sat in the back in a tiny but cozy outdoor patio which would seat about 10 comfortably and maybe 5 more standing. Smoking is allowed so if that bothers you, heads up. I smoke occasionally so it was nice to unwind with a smoke and drink outside but still in the bar. Happy hour menu both food and drink until 8p.m.! The bartender was friendly and made great drinks, I had two kinds one I forgot, "" ground "" something, and two old fashion. My wife had the same and they were consistent. We had some spicy crab salad slider with chips, very very tasty. The inside seemed very very noisy and a bit crammed. It's a long and narrow space and I'm not comfortable in tight spaces, but everyone inside seemed to be really enjoying themselves. Ages from 20's to 50's and it looked a mixed crowd of after work and friends and dates. There was a live dj at the end of the bar spinning actual vinyls of mixed upbeat genres.

85,,12/8/2014,60,,"Norwood, MA",Dan M.,0,5.0,20,"Okay, I'm going to keep the review short. Summit Bar is the brainchild of Seider, a delightfully narcissistic mixologist. I talked to him shortly after it opened, and he said - paraphrasing to remove the many, many expletives - that he envisioned a bar that could serve world-class craft cocktails but still be packed, rowdy and noisy. Well, he nailed it. It's built without pretension**, and the cocktails are fantastic - the best, by a mile, being the John Lee Hooker.But, now the important part: RIP, Pete! For those who don't know, Pete was a neighborhood fixture - personally responsible for thousands of hangovers and blurry nights across Alphabet City. He practically drew his own crowd to the Sunburnt Cow (oh, the shenanigans in that old dump) and Esperanto, before eventually taking over the day-to-day bar duties at Summit. Well, he decided to leave us behind and return to his native New Zealand this fall. We were lucky to have him, and I don't know that a drink around here will ever be as satisfying (or strong) without him.** Note: this review is based on what I've always experienced at the bar. I've noticed recently that the crowd is...changing. I'm a little concerned about what the addition of 'bros' will do to the environment...",1

The nice part was the bartenders gave two of my friends free shots when they went up to pay, and I think I saw them do it again for some other people. The appetizer dish (vegetarian platter with hummus and tabouli salad) was good. I ordered the governess, which was very good and everyone in my party order their own preferences. The drinks are very unique and was a good balance of flavors. Only minus a star due to waiting for drinks.

When im having a tough day, oysters and a good drink is what a girl needs ... Anyway, this night the bartender was very slow and inattentive which made the experience lackluster.  She served us drinks after about 10 - 15 minutes of waiting and then scoffed when i ordered two dozen oysters. I mean, the Summit is known for their oyster happy hour so - disappointing.  My boyfriend and i had come here 2-3 other times before and it was good.

It's a great mix of sweet and smokey and a big hit amongst the group. One of my favorite things about this bar? The doorman!

I think it is called the crushed glass.  This time there was a lot more space at the top of the glass.  The first time it went right up to the rim.  Also, this time it was made completely differently.  He put in a ton of the red pepper sauce.  so much that It tasted more like a marinade than a cocktail.  I asked him to make it less sweet.  he added a little bit more tequila.  it still tasted gross.  I stopped drinking it.  It just sat there.For our two drinks the price was about $25.   Thats not worth it if one of them is undrinkable and I was obviously not enjoying my drink this time.

The bar, while EXTREMELY busy it was still easy to get the attention of a bartender and they were helpful in choosing a cocktail. The light shades made of whiskey bottles...perfect. The cocktails were well made, the Say Hello was a light refreshing drink, something that my gf loved so much it was all she had. The John Lee Hooker was also well made, I think the cocktails trend slightly towards the sweeter/citrus-y end but all well made, even something 'classic' like a margarita was well made and done quickly.However, I can't give it a higher review because I asked for a Blanton's with a little bit of water and what I got was a pretty good pour of bourbon with about the same amount of water, it basically just killed the flavor of it. A lot of precision and skill in making a cocktail but adding just a couple drops of water into a glass of bourbon and it was all thumbs. I didn't understand that.

Updated review",485,5,"New York, NY",Lauren B.,60,5.0,390,"Oh yes. I give The Summit Bar high marks for the amazing birthday party I thew there last weekend. I was in touch with management via email (they don't have a phone) and told them I wanted to host about 30 people on a Saturday night. They quickly got back to me and announced that they would be happy to help me have a great party. And you know what? They really did. Saturday night I walked in with 5 people and another 5 were already there. I found the manager and he told me he would block off the whole back section starting at 10PM. Perfect. I ordered a Driving Mrs. Davies and went out onto the back semi-enclosed back patio area to enjoy it. More and more people started showing up and at 10 of 10, the bouncer came over to me, introduced himself and said he was now going to block off the back for my party. He quickly relocated everyone who wasn't there for me (hehe, birthdays are so self centered) and as more and more people arrived, we had ample room in the back patio area as well as inside at the back of the bar and back couch. There was a spot for everyone and the drinks kept flowing. People that wanted to smoke could, outdoors, without putting down their drink. The comfortable outdoor lounge furniture meant most everyone could sit and mingle, or just relieve themselves from the torture of heels. I wore glittery flats because hey, everyone should wear some sparkle on their birthday and I don't care if you think it's lame. I had an absolute blast and appreciated the venue staff keeping us liquored up and free of random people. It was such a perfect situation. Perfect drinks, perfect friends, zero strangers and reasonable prices. You think I'll be back? Oh yes, I sure will and if I need another venue for a gathering, you know I'm choosing Summit. hungrychildinthecity.com",13

Bartenders are always friendly; that's a good thing b/c I hate to spend money at a place where I have to be insulted. It's always crowded and you can be sure that you cannot find a seat but I guess who comes to a bar to find a seat? But I feel like if the bar wasn't that narrow I wouldn't have to feel so cramp all the time. I think they used to have a DJ (not sure if he's still there) but I'm not sure why he's there because I notice he plays the SAME MUSIC EVERY SINGLE TIME. They should really just save the money and plug a music player instead.As for the drinks they are pretty decent but I do see that they never update their cocktail list. A good bar will always update their cocktail list. They can keep their usuals and their signature, but they will always have new things on the menu to give a little kick, even if it's limited time.

Summit is the definitive example of this. I'm lucky enough to have tried each of their 8 signature cocktails - and each one has a real uniqueness and complexity of flavour that one expects handing over 12 bucks for a cocktail. As a British expat, the Lions in London is my particular favourite - but you really can't go wrong.Prepare to be very cosy with your fellow drinkers on Fri/Sat evenings, the place is predictably rammed. But for me, this is wholly forgiven with the quality of the cocktails on offer.

I've always been a regular here, though I haven't been for some time. I had an incident there over the weekend which made me want to leave a review. I apparently bought a girl a few drinks but ten forgot about it. She had a crew of guys with her which made me realize that even if I had bought the drinks (12 dollars each) it wouldn't be worth my time. I admit that I can't remember if I had bought the drinks for her was happy that the owner of the bar was cool about the situation, though he took her side and didn't take my side of the story seriously. I said several times that I was willing to pay for the drinks regardless. The owner said that it was alright, which I appreciated, but he had a stupid grin on his face, which I don't mind so much, only as the owner of a place your responsibility is to be professional. The girl had a crew of dudes with her just itching for a chance to make something major out of something incredibly minor. Bored buffoons eager to show off their macho attitudes basically. The two ""cool"" black bouncers (wearing sunglasses at night) immediately seized on the situation in order to threaten me with violence, while some dumbass from the girls crew tried to demand that I pay for the drinks -- not intimidating at all, just wanted I play white knight for the girl, which didn't help the situation at all and was pathetically immature. Anyway I got out of there quick, I'm not one for drama or violence when it is utterly unnecessary. I was happy that the owner was amiable about the (minor) incident, but I didn't appreciate his bias, his attitude, or the way the bouncers came at me like attack dogs for almost no reason. They are likely bored all night trying to be cool as bouncers lol and have the one situation in the night where they can make their lives meaningful. Bottom line, right or wrong, train your attack dogs (bouncers) and take that stupid smug smile off your face when you treat customers. You're immature and arrogant in your approach by taking sides. Learn how to run a bar. Advise dumbass friends of people trying to resolve a conflict to stay out of it so the dispute can be resolved amicably. That's not my job that's yours. It's your bar. You can allow violence or you can prevent it.",5

Updated review",9,,"New York, NY",Aris S.,1,2.0,37,"I've been going to the Summit for a couple of years now and starting to notice that certain things are getting worse. I used to like the energy and professionalism of all the bartenders and the whole experience they provided, but was unfortunate enough to run into a new (at least to me) female bartender that was one of the worst I've encountered in NYC. And that maybe looks like an indication that management is lacking here..The charming tattooed lady that served our two rounds of drinks and a cheese platter, was colder than ice, looked constantly discontent with her job and made us feel uncomfortable. When I leaned over to order our second round of drinks (late at night when she was not busy at all), she didn't even move from the other end of the inside of the bar to make the process easier or show some appreciation for my effort. She strictly said ""I can hear you"", revealing her absolute lack of understanding of the hospitality or entertainment part of the concept. When we tipped her badly to give her a hint, she didn't even inquire about it, but instead, she decided to make a comment about us to her coworker, who gave us a nasty look, lol! Some people are best left out of the hospitality industry and this is a prime example of that. It's not her fault, I guess the management is nowhere around to notice...",4

Updated review",567,8,"New York, NY",Lissa V.,4,5.0,242,"So I'm doing an update as I'd never been to the Summit late night. Well, not only does it deliver for low key day drinking but late night on a Saturday is also a fabulous time. It's a good scene, low key but not too too hipster and there was enough room for our crew of 9 to grab some elbow room. At one point in the night I even got a seat!I love the bartenders here - anyone that gives me 5 shots for the price of 3 to celebrate my friend's birthday is pretty fantastic in my book! The whip up some stellar cocktails:- Born and Raised - this is a good one but it's strong. I can only drink one or two of these bad boys.- The Guv'nor - ""Ello Guv'nor"" (you're allowed to say it like that when you order - tell them I said it was OK) goes down a little easier and is quite tasty with the cardamom. Probably my favorite cocktail on the menu.  - Charmaine Star - I got this one accidentally... I think because the bartender thought the nice British gentleman ordering the drinks said ""Charmaine star"" instead of ""the Guv'nor""... which is funny because you'd think a Brit could order a Guv'nor correctly... anyway, I digress and there was no whiskey to be found in my glass when it was handed to me so I tried this vodka cocktail... refreshing and a funny story nonetheless. - The Shu Jam Fizz - I love this drink... but the problem is it tastes like candy and I could easily guzzle down 5 of them in a matter of minutes... so it's best for my wallet and my liver if I do not order this. I've also tasted some of the classics, the whiskey sour and the old fashioned. Both were good as well, but I prefer the Summit's own concoctions better. Great time to be had by all. They have a patio out back for when the weather gets warmer. The only issue... finding a cab in the EV at 3am on a Saturday.",10

You can fit maybe 2 or 3 rows of patrons between the bar and the wall and that is just about it.  If you swing by Summit Bar late on a Saturday night, good luck trying to find someplace to stand while you drink your cocktail.  Come with a smaller group and your life will be easier.",

All the bartenders are friendly and thoroughly skilled in the art of shaking, muddling, mixing, peeling and spritzing. Last night I had the Cider House Punch, a competitor in the Starr Rum Challenge this month, and it had the feeling of a cider drink, without all the heavy spices of a pumpkin pie that can sometimes confuse a drink. It was perfectly seasonal for the rainy November evening and I hope to return for more of their delicious concoctions. It's definitely on the mellow side and a great date spot.

We were treated so well-- got help with seating arrangements, free shots, quick service.

Citrusy beverage.  Basically, the nectar of the gods.There is a patio area too with a retractable roof.  It's a bit uncomfortable in the winter as the smokers all convene and you're basically hot boxed with smoke.  In the summer, it's pleasant though.  And sometimes, the owners will just grill for you.  That happened one night and it was fricking awesome.  Free hot dogs and burgers.  An amazing touch that makes you feel really welcome.Sometimes, you will get a free shot or two as well.  Not bad at all.  It can be crazy on weekend nights, particularly after 11pm.  Like you literally can't move.  But, it's still a great place.  Just keep it a secret.  Thanks.",2

The ambience is perfect for playing up the real star of the show here: the drinks.If you read this and do not get the Spicy Margarita, most likely nothing will happen to you. But really, there is something seriously the matter with you if you decide against one of these. Since my friend had ordered me one sans menu, the bartender happily explained what I was drinking: chipotle chili agave, orange bitters, hickory smoked salt.... Is this guy for real? Yes, he is for real. And that drink is for real. And it's yours for $12. Not too bad considering the euphoric state that seems to come with it.

Alphabet city charm, a commitment to creative, stiff drinks, and an impressive back patio space Summit on a saturday night was a good mix of buzz and chill. On a weekday night, it presented a great, quiet enough space to catch up with a friend over a couple drinks without having to scream. The space is shaped like an old school telephone receiver, fat on the ends and skinny in the middle where there are bars on each end. We made a reservation for a party of about 20 people in the smaller front area that has a horseshoe-shaped seating area.  We all had plenty of space to stand or sit, and even at the peak of saturday night, we never felt squished. the bartenders, who have the dual task of mixing an impressive menu of creative cocktails and slinging beers and wines, were fast and efficient. the cocktails ran a little on the sweet side for my taste, but there was plenty of variety to make me and my friends satisfied. Do try the john lee hooker though--scotch, bourbon, bitters, and beer--potent yes, tasty even more so. I'm admittedly more of a divey bar guy but I've also visited some of the serious drink bars like raines, death&co, and little branch...summit provides almost the same quality type cocktail in an environment that doesn't require 50-minute waits and nondescript doorways.

197,15,7/9/2011,234,10,"Brooklyn, NY",Laura A.,1231,4.0,344,"There is just one and common ingredient at all Summit bar drinks: The surprising factorIt can be incarnate on a cardamom or cinnamon form at their infused agaves. Or what about a hickory smoked salt rim? did you ever thought about licking this from a glass? raisins on a Rye, or cucumber and even red pepper puree. You can keep counting some others ""out of blue"" elements. The Japanese Yamazaki whiskey that can please all those that are not a fan over the Western Rye, bourbon and whiskeys, is surprisingly a frequent component in their drinks. And for all of them orange and others citrus is a usual companion, and we all know this is a combination that must have been set in heaven. Herbs and spices seems to be the toys that the alchemist like to play with, because he can't be qualified differently. A guy that is also behind Maritime Parc (NJ) and Minetta Tavern's cocktails menu. Knowing this, I find him extremely interesting at this point. Greg Seider, a name that deserves to be remembered. The elements mentioned above are part of the large list of cocktails in The Alchemist menu. But you can also choose among the Classic ones if you are able to overpass the most exciting combinations. I couldn't but got stuck instead in this one, tasting a total of 5 different drinks; you don't need to know how many I did finish completely ...but not just one I can tell you.  The presentation is simple. There is not tricks, garnishments or different textures, something that I admit to be a fan of, but that was not missed in this style of drinks. Rather, I find it perfect to be served in a plain, ""boring"" short whiskey glass to enhance the colors, make the huge ice cube a main character and to be focus on the flavors. Balanced and noticeable all of them. The space is appealing and ""out of blue"" as well for an Avenue C location. Baroque inspiration combined with naked brick walls and naked bulb lights. And hipster style bartenders, or at least to me as they resembled to Williamsburg habitants, that keep an eye on you to quickly attend your, sometimes numerous, request. Although I prefer the Guv'nor over the Born & Raised both where an amazing way to start the evening that end up with the Hawaiian summer rum punch, a Rum based drink combined with Vietnamese cinnamon agave, fresh lemon, Pinot Noir Float and something that I can't find what it is.. Dimmi Italian Cordial .. help? Despite the name this punch was far away of a tiki drink, that I usually find too water-down for my taste, but more like the luscious punch bowls served at Cienfuegos, those that I been a fan of since I first tasted them. Because I think that's the closest flavor profile among all the speakeasies in town for Summit bar drinks. The texture seems thicker at Cienfuegos while Summit offer a clean-liquid drink. But both resembles a similar tendency. And don't be trick by the sweet side, this drinks go down very easily but goes up to your brain maybe even faster. I guess its not by chance I prefer the Guv'nor drink having a Japanese character as is not other that a combination of Yamazaki Whiskey, toasted cardamom infused agave, Japanese yuzu and fresh orange juice.  In the mid time ""The situation"" cocktail revealed how raisins not only goes well with Christmas, Thanksgiving, turkey and bread but is an excellent addition to Rye, caraway infused agave, fresh lemon and Summit orange bitters. The Ground to Glass drink, a tequila based cocktail was maybe the most excentric combination as its a mix of , red pepper puree, cucumber, fresh lime, Summit orange bitters finished by the hickory smoked salt. I read somewhere those are experimental drinks and although I really like that name and will keep using it when describing this drinks, I find it a little bit wrong. Experiments works only sometimes but somehow Greg Seider gets a perfect and successful combination .. every single time.",15
198,,8/10/2012,43,,"New York, NY",Minette Y.,10,5.0,188,"My absolute favorite cocktail in ABC comes from here, and this is a neighborhood that houses Elsa, Death&Co, Cienfuegos, etc. The Ground to Glass: Corralejo Blanco Tequila, red pepper puree, cucumber, fresh lime, Summit orange bitters, hickory smoked salt. That hickory smoked salt is what really puts it over the edge. You get a little bit on your lips as you sip and then come hits of slightly sweet, slightly cool, mostly savory; somewhat thick because of the pureed red pepper. The tequila blends in perfectly, and it doesnt kick you in the mouth at all.Other than that, they have plenty of other carefully picked/mixed cocktails, the classics, and a set of somewhat hard-to-find great beers on tap, making it so damn hard to choose what kind of drink you want to go for.This place is surprisingly nice and a little bit bigger/trendier than other drink spots around Avenue C, so it can get a little crowded or loud inside. If there's room out back, sit in the outdoor space with expansive wooden benches and a low table. The neighbors upstairs ask for respectful quiet, so Summit consistently asks everyone to keep the noise down... good for having an actual conversation over great drinks.",
