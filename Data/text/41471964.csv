It's a short walk from the train and Chelsea Piers. The restaurant is a narrow space, but seating is comfortable. No one's bumping elbows. The decor is very chic and romantic. It's so chic that it's street sign was a picture of a horse. :-) The bartenders were very friendly. They smiled and conversed with the patrons at the bar. Drunken Horse has the romantic dim lighting for a dinner/drink date. But its servers and patrons are friendly, and it's a great spot to hang out with friends and actually talk to other people. I actually didn't see anyone looking at their phone in this restaurant. They were all happily chatting away, which is rare in New York City.My friend and I had the Flor Brava and Mariposa. They went very well with the Falafel appetizer. We chose this app in particular because it has hummus AND falafel. They're healthy, and they soak up the alcohol. You can't beat that!",1

It has local art on the walls. It has a fireplace with a couch and wonderful little snacks and a great wine list. So I took my GF now wife here early on and impressed her, then we came back and across the coffee table in front of the fireplace we were having champagne and snacks watching a young couple vacationing from somewhere checking the price of everything but really enjoying NYC(ok so yeah I secretly paid their check), and finally when we got married we had a bar crawl and this was stop #2 and my friend from High School flew out to be with us bought bubbles for everyone to toast our wedding......So yeah....this place is magical and you should come here so it never closes...I'll post here when I plan on coming in the winter so you can not come because I hate when the couch is taken",

I sat in the back and enjoyed a couple of rose wines on happy hour for $8.  The wine was balanced, served not too cold and was of good quality.The service echoed the churn and burn airport crowd dynamic inherent in its location with a little indifference, bluntness and ungraceful attempts to upsell.The menu also seemed fairly standard with cheese, charcuturie and other small plates.Atmosphere - comfortable hotel lobby Drinks - my wine was of good quality and value Service - efficient but a little impersonal",9

We came here on a Thursday night in the mood for drinks and we were not disappointed.The service here is prompt, attentive and very helpful. Our server helped us choose a great Italian wine to pair with our food. The menu is sparse and limited in scope (primarily Mediterranean) but the food is still decent (nothing special but adequate to accompany drinks). The drink menu is extensive with a great selection of wines, cocktails and whiskey.The ambiance is laid back and casual while still being fun and cozy. There were still quite a crowd there on a Thursday but were able to get the long table in the back to ourselves.

43,,12/26/2014,263,,"Philadelphia, PA",Natalia P.,23,2.0,192,"So, I sort of have mixed feelings about this wine bar. First off, my review may be biased as I found myself here at about 2am when searching for a classy place to eat. It was slim pickings, even in Chelsea, as this place is close to a rowdy night club. In any case, if you are looking sip wine by a fireplace and get an appetizer...this is it. Otherwise, the menu items here are really small and pricey. I had to got 2 appetizers and an entree. Somehow, I managed to still walk away hungry. And yes, who expects to eat a meal at 2am? I missed lunch and dinner. But I would avoid coming here hungry is the point. (Scratching my head...why come at all?)As far as a wine bar, the bottles here are $45plus.

Apparently they had been told by one of the staffers that he didn't ""think it was that hot."" We simmered down a bit and ordered some drinks. They have a decent selection. I had a rose, but there were plenty of other bubbly (and non-bubbly) choices. We ordered hummus, a cheese plates and some fried cheese in phyllo. All very nice. Before long we were moved to a large seating area at the front of the place and everyone was happy. Overall, the staff was friendly and helpful.

They had a good selection but it was a little overpriced, like it is all over Manhattan. Service was decent. It was a fine spot to wait for our table at the Red Cat next door.",
74,1,8/22/2011,128,,"Astoria, NY",Lauren L.,0,4.0,529,"We had some drinks here yesterday, while waiting for our broken-down car to get fixed, and were pleasantly surprised. I had a delicious French rose, which was reasonably priced for Manhattan, although the boyfriend's beer was a tad overpriced. The decor is pretty cute, as there is a fireplace and couches, which kinda makes you feel like you are drinking in someone's living room.The owner was really friendly too, although the music selection as noted by other Yelpers was pretty strange. Overall, I think it's a great option for drinking in the neighborhood, and I'd go back next time I'm near 10th Ave.",
75,,9/2/2011,87,,"Manhattan, NY",Shauna D.,10,3.0,167,"went here for drinks because half king was too crowded.  The service was good and the beer, champ, and wine was good.  The decor was simple americana, with a living room set up when you walk in.  we tried the five cheese deal and it came with hot pita bread cuts and some sweet jam.  we all liked a different cheese and the prices were fair.",

77,1,5/12/2010,11,1,"New York, NY",P M.,1,2.0,189,"One star for the good service. Another star for the wine.This place calls refers to itself as a wine and cheese place. But when we ordered a plate of three cheeses, there was absolutely nothing accompanying it. No quince paste, no mustard, no compote, nothing. I was expecting some interesting and unique flavors paired together as you'd get in Caselulla or Bocca di Bacco. Or any other decent wine and cheese bar. Any place can cut up a few cheeses and put it on a plate. Doesn't make it anything close to a ""wine and cheese"" place. Disappointing to say the least.",2
78,1,11/7/2010,257,,"Montclair, NJ",Jonathan G.,113,3.0,586,"I feel like The Drunken Horse is a work in progress, but one with some definite potential. Not quite the scene of other 10th Avenue hideouts, The Drunken Horse is a small, cozy wine bar with an extremely friendly staff. It was fairly empty on a Saturday night, but that only made the service from the two bartenders that much more attentive. From recommendations to refilling water to friendly chatter, they were most certainly a pleasure.The menu is small, but pungent. From hummus and artichoke dip to sets of cheeses and meats, there is plenty to choose from to feed yourself while having some wine or one of their four beer options. I had a special vegetable pancake which was a little bland, but three cheese recommendations from the staff were excellent and served with plenty of pita bread and one accompanying sauce.The environment is welcoming and with a fireplace right inside the front door it is definitely a nice place to stop into on a cold day on the High Line or at the galleries for a drink and some relaxation.",

I love the wine shelves that enveloped the corner and I LOVE the fireplace up front with the couches. I do think, although, as a wine bar there should be a bigger wine list but it didn't bother my experience at all. The Pinotage was delicious as well as the special italian Sangiovese! Thanks Drunken Horse for your stellar Pandora station, kept the hubby occupied while I savored my wine.",

88,,4/15/2012,272,,"Mount Pleasant, SC",Stephanie H.,315,5.0,331,"Honestly, I'm a regular here and I bring everyone I can to this fantastic bar. It's ""off the radar"" with it's inconspicuous location off of 10th Avenue, tucked between big hitters like Red Cat and Tia Pol, but the great atmosphere, wine selection and perfect small bites menu more than justify a stop in. The bar staff and owner are more than gracious: they go out of their way to make you feel welcome. They are amazing and pretty much the huge reason I keep coming back and inviting more people to join me each time I do. The atmosphere is perfect: darkly lit, fireplace, cozy but not cramped. Usually a perfect mix of patrons with space at the bar. The staff keeps a great mix of amazing music rotating at the bar, and their wine selection is outstanding: just make sure to ask what's ""off the menu"" to get into the really good stuff. Cheese plate is out of this world and they always keep the accompanying warm pita coming. Turkish food selections.....but the drinks come from all regions. Great beer list, too! This place is definitely worth the trip out west!!!!",

Not too crowded.Unfortunately the waiters were hitting on my 2 friends the entire time rather than giving us any service. We ordered another round of drinks, they brought my 2 girlfriends drinks over right away and completely forgot about mine and my friend's drinks.  It was comedic, but on a serious level not very professional.Also, the place lacks character.  The tables, chairs and lighting are all rather generic.  Being situated in the heart of Chelsea's gallery district, it's odd that it has almost no art on the walls.  The one big wall has a decorative print that is far too small for the wall.  The work looks like something they picked up from Target in the same aisle as the clocks and mirrors.  But perhaps the lack of art is a good escape from the visual overload of Chelsea galleries.The one redeeming quality is that it's not crowded and is relatively nice inside, for that I give it 3 stars.",

The bartender was a very friendly Turkish girl, and allowed us to sample a few wines before we settled on a bottle of Malbec.

That's probably how I would characterize this wine bar. The decor and ambience is very cozy.. like I said, comfy couch + warm fireplace + privacy = amazing escape from the cold/rain outdoors. The music was perfect - a little Cure, a little Death Cab, very eclectic but definitely didn't intrude on our conversation. The wine and beer list was pretty extensive - I had the Malbec, while my date had some German beer. The big disappointment was the menu, but I wasn't complaining too much after a few glasses of wine. Casellula this place is not -- they're not trying to be some sort of gastronomic haven -- but do they offer a reasonably priced, cozy, romantic, satisfying experience? Absolutely....",
