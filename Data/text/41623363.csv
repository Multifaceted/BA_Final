0,A L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,43,0.0,5.0,12/15/2017,Friendly staff. Always nice. Fast. Go there almost every day on my way to work. Manika is always so sweet in the mornings.,,,
1,Mike N.,"New York, NY",131,268,51,4.0,7/26/2016,"There's not really much to say because this is a Dunkin Donuts after all, but it's the best Dunkin I've ever been to. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive and the service is quick. Even on the few occasions where there is a line, it moves fast and the orders remain accurate, which I can not say about many other Dunkin locations in the city. It is clear that the franchisee here really cares about his/her restaurant and their customers.",3,,1
2,Carl D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,0,3.0,1/20/2018,Quick service but the last 2 of the 3 times I was there they got the order wrong. Is a small decaf latte with vanilla flavor so difficult to remember? Taste your order before you leave.!,,,
3,Seria M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",73,10,2,4.0,10/26/2017,"Same as most dunkin donuts, the staff is very friendly and quick. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I ordered a dunkin energy drink and got charged 5.01.....but when I go to the dunkin donuts on Lexington near the 6 train which isn't that far at all, they charge me 4.67 for it. I'm not sure why there is a price difference but the food and donuts are usually worth it from here. It's always clean and refreshing",,,
4,Sophie L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,12/28/2017,This is the best Dunkin Donuts location I have ever been to. Friendly staff and the place is clean.,,,
5,Mike D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,43,0,4.0,4/8/2017,"This Dunkin' was recently renovated and is often less crowded than nearby DDs. The service is fast. A large opaque divider separates the entranceway and counter; it allows for a nice flow to the service. Large chairs and a marble bench are available, so you can sit at off to the side, like at a library. Though ""off the beaten path,"" this location is still worth visiting.",,,
6,Caroline H.,"Manhattan, NY",181,153,145,5.0,5/17/2016,"My favorite Dunkin!  Staff are very friendly - they always make me smile in the morning.  Dunkin Donuts' are not always consistent, but this location is great.",1,2,1
7,Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,2243,478,4.0,6/22/2016,i am glad that dd open near my area so when i need my coolata and jelly donut fix i don't have to go far. this new 1st ave dd between 50th and 51st st is a tiny place but it offers everything that a typical dd has. i like coming here in the morning before work cause it's never crowded and it's well stocked with goodies along with a nice friendly staff that keep the place clean all the time. even though there are not tables to sit cause of the smallish size inside but to the left side is a wall too wall counter with about 6 stools to sit eat and drink while reading your newspaper or play with your phone. a welcome addition to the snobbish area.   p.s. excuse me miss stroller mom but please move your stroller away from me cause your baby is annoying me.,,2,5
8,J N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,3,5.0,12/5/2016,BEST DUNKIN EVER!!!! Manika ( I think that's how you spell it ) is an angel. She is so sweet and really makes you feel welcomed there. My order is always quick and correct. I go every morning. Best DD!,,,
