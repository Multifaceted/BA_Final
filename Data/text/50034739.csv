0,Anitha K.,"New York, NY",114,3,0.0,4.0,6/6/2018,"I love this place. Definitely a place you want to keep a secret, like I'm doing now.Come for the sunsetStay for the pretty lights that come on afterLeave before the check comesKidding.I gave it 4 stars because of my allergies. How dare you guys have all this pollen and ragweed flying and trees and clean air while I'm trying to get drunk? It isn't good for my health!",,2,
1,Danny H.,"New York, NY",0,9,0.0,2.0,9/7/2018,"I've been to this place many times because I live very close by. It is wonderful having a place in the park where you can eat and drink, which is why we go back. They have a few interesting beers, served in plastic cups. The menu is limited and the food quality is very inconsistent.Service is a problem. Perhaps the biggest issue is simply that the place is understaffed. But they use the system of having one person take your  order and a different person deliver your order, which may be efficient but is a recipe for customer frustration. Because the people who serve the food aren't the people who took the orders, food often arrives at the wrong table and the server never knows who gets what.The last time I was there, I ordered a medium-rare burger. It was literally black when it arrived, burnt way beyond well-done. When I called the person who took my order over and showed it to her, she said, ""Wow, I would never have served that."" Well, isn't that a basic problem? Although she took it back and a few minutes later someone brought me what I'd ordered in the first place, nobody apologized.Will I go back? Absolutely, but all because of the location.",,,
2,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",278,420,241,3.0,7/3/2018,Honestly way overpriced and underwhelming for what you get. Would not go out of your way to come here unless you happen to be in Riverside Park and really want to sit down and have a beer.Came here on a hot day for a drink and a bite to eat.  Cocktails are $14 and come in plastic cups which is okay considering the venue but are super watered down. Ordered food anyway as we were pretty famished and was also underwhelmed. $14 veggie burger tasted microwaved and came with the wrong side. Service was pretty meh.Would maybe come back here for a bucket of Coronas or something but nothing else. Manage your expectations accordingly or save yourself the trouble and the expenditure.,3,,
3,Scott S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,2.0,5/25/2018,"It's an outdoor restaurant with a pretty deep menu.  That part is great and I look forward to the opening every year.  But year after year, there is not enough service staff.  Don't even think of asking for ketchup, mustard or extra napkins after your food finally arrives.  And when your clientele is predominantly upper west side children, you cannot expect kids to remain calm waiting for ketchup for 15 minutes while their fries get cold. Is it that hard or expensive to leave out some Heinz on every table? Or a large canister we can pour your own, like they have at Pier-I?  Instead you need to chase down an overworked and understaffed server and hope he remembers to bring it.  You may say this is just one persons gripe. But it literally happens every single time I come. Yet I still come as there is nothing else.",3,,
4,Kat S.,"Brooklyn, NY",110,20,6,5.0,10/10/2018,"I've never eaten here, but I have come for drinks on several occasions. Sometimes they have live music downstairs. They also have tetherball, which was a welcomed surprise. The drinks were fine, nothing to rave about, but they don't need to have great drinks. Location, location, location.",,,
5,Lucy C.,"New York, NY",120,101,23,5.0,8/11/2018,"My favorite and a secret gem in the UWS. I normally go to this park to work out and so happy I stumbled upon this gem. I had dinner here with a friend and had a beer and a veggie burger with sweet potato fries. It was honestly really good. The atmosphere and the view was amazing. I would definitely work on their service as it was hard to get a refill on any condiments but besides that, this is my spot. I want to try the other items on the menu. Water is free, the place is perfect for a group of friends, family and just hanging out with a large group of people outside. This is my spot!",,,
6,Karon S.,"Calabasas, CA",60,80,40,4.0,1/9/2018,"I'm surprised Ellington doesn't get more stars. I love that it's not trying to be anything more than it is. And does that well.Great place to stop on your walk, for a drink and a bite to eat. Perfect for a long conversation with a river view. Equally good for time alone.Service is very good. Food delicious. Avocado Toast is a generous portion, enough for a light lunch, reasonably priced, delicious.",1,1,1
7,Diana G.,"Manhattan, NY",80,7,0,2.0,9/21/2018,"The staff is always great but the food is mediocre. And I'm far from picky. Wish the food was better but at least the unique location makes up for it. Plus, it's the only place to sit and eat when I'm there for my son's baseball. If the food improved then it would get 5 stars.",,,
8,Jeff M.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,2.0,5/20/2018,"Excellent space and place to hang out. Very good food. But prepare yourself for a cast or waiters who do a terrible job and don't care one bit about it. It is consistent across the staff, so clearly management understaffs, underpays, and doesn't give a crap about delivering a good experience. If this place didn't have one of the two best spots in Riverside Park, it wouldn't last a season.",2,,
9,Elle M.,"New York, NY",135,9,4,5.0,6/2/2018,Friendly staff! Erin and Kyle were great behind the bar!!!! I brought my dog which is always great to go to a place that allows dogs! They treated him just like a guest! If you're looking for a cool spot in the park to have drinks or lunch this is it!,,,
10,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3285,12680,4.0,9/15/2016,Drinking in the park with a riverside view is just the best way to have a beer!  How can you not love this? It's kind of a hidden gem way uptown on the west side and buried in Riverside Park off the 103rd street entrance. Walk down and over and you will see it overlooking the river.There is a small bar up top with outside seating offering great views. Walk the stairs down and there is another larger bar below level with both outdoor and some covered seating. Also offers great views of the river and sand volleyball courts. You can also find the bathrooms down here too.Decent beer list on tap and in bottles. Friendly bartenders serving up drinks. I was here last night to run a 5K race and was able to hang out and enjoy a post run beer and some eats. They also have a small menu of food items to choose from.So choice and the best thing about this place is that very few seem to know it's here other than those who live in the area  - and no annoying tourists!,16,11,12
11,Enid H.,"East Elmhurst, NY",31,10,2,5.0,6/19/2018,Great little spot tucked away in the park. Food was amazing!! I will definitely be coming back with friends. Great view and peaceful environment if you need somw downtime. Service was great also.,,,
12,Matthew W.,"Manhattan, NY",180,7,0,1.0,7/1/2018,"My husband and I always love to bike over to the Ellington. However things have gone downhill - the last two times we ordered guacamole once had parsley instead of cilantro, the other was a major oilslick. A couple of weeks ago a server walked up and accused us of ordering from the bar when there was a mix-up as to who exactly our server was. Today - we ordered two beers, the waitress suggested a pitcher ($32), The pitcher basically gave us a beer and half each, so 3 beers total. Had we ordered 3 beers it would have been a cheaper $24. When we let the waitress know she was very nice but basically said she wasn't sure why, but no change to the check. So a very overpriced pitcher of beer that we never tried to order in the first place. The Ellington has a monopoly on Riverside Park but COME ON. You can do better.",,,
13,Allison R.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,1.0,5/25/2018,Service is so bad bc they are understaffed. Need to hire more wait staff. With the business they have there i don't see how they couldn't afford it. Also my turkey burger was totally raw on the inside and i couldn't eat it bc I'm pregnant and it was a safety hazard. Honestly would be a hazard for anyone. I wanted a new one but couldn't flag down a waiter and in the end just paid and left. So sad bc this place used to be so nice and now it's a zoo.,1,,
14,Sharon C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,2.0,7/18/2018,"Can't tell you how much I want to love this place as it's around the corner. The view is amazing. The food is barely mediocre with some of it inedible. (Bruschetta was a soggy, gloppy mess. Guacamole was clearly from a can.) The staff is very nice but also mediocre. When they get something wrong the kitchen is all the way downstairs and takes a long time to fix. The mixed drink was watered down and flavorless. Oh, I so wish it were amazing as I'd come all the time. I",1,,
15,J. Karim A.,"New York, NY",59,742,334,3.0,8/5/2017,"A group of us came on a weekday to celebrate a friend's birthday. We snagged a table on the lower level. I had some bbq wings which were fine, though the sauce was a bit sweet. On a nice night it's a fun spot to hang out.",,1,
16,Allison C.,"New York, NY",208,1624,449,4.0,9/10/2016,"The best thing about Ellington In The Park as that it isn't as well known as other riverfront bar / restaurant locations in the city. Thank goodness for that! I remember when I first moved to NYC in 2009, living on 108th and Columbus, and this area now used for E.I.T.P. wasn't what it was now. I used to love wandering this this section of Riverside Park; for a while, there was nothing there at all, then I started noticing food popping up there in the summers. Flash forward to 2016, and here we are! The selection of food and drink is decent! I usually just snack while I'm there, so I go for the chips with malt vinegar and dipping sauce or the sliders. Both are great! The cocktails are a bit on the pricer side, but I can get a can of Downeast Cider for $7, which is all I really need in life. E.I.T.P. is actually two-tiered; there is the section along the main walking path through the park, and you can also walk downstairs to a section closer to the river (albeit blocked by the West Side Highway) that sits in front of a sandy volleyball court with swinging rings. I do recall ordering something from the menu once, sitting in the upper section, and being told I couldn't order it because it's only available in the lower section. Hmmmm...not sure why you can't just walk it up the stairs, but okay...Since it's located pretty deep into Riverside Park, about a 10 -15 minute walk from the 1 Train at 103rd (depending on your speed), I've invited people, and they complain about the distance. Damn New Yorkers and their need to be close to a subway. Ha! Oh well. Too bad for them, and better for me! When all of the other riverfront bars in the city are just too crowded, just make the escape to Riverside Park and find this gem. You won't be disappointed.",6,,1
17,Sebastian T.,"Astoria, NY",27,20,4,5.0,6/2/2017,"Nice chilled atmosphere, attentive servers. Can't talk about their food, as I haven't tried it, but good priced beer and excellent views",1,,
18,Jamel O.,"Jackson Heights, NY",2614,891,191,4.0,5/22/2016,"If you don't know how to find Ellington in the Park, it can be quite the adventure.The park is great to begin with and having a western view as the sun sets is pretty awesome.  The service seems to be pretty good.The drinks are not cheap. However, you are paying to be in the park, no different than a stadium. It is a novelty.On a rainy saturday, things were not that bad, but I am informed it can be difficult to get a table on an amazing day.",9,,1
19,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",280,552,265,3.0,7/27/2015,"This is a very cool venue that can be enjoyed during the warmer months of the year. It's a bit hard to find since google maps will tell you that it's located at the intersection of 105th and Riverside Dr. However, you need to walk in to the park a bit to find it. Look for the red umbrellas!This restaurant/bar has two levels so don't miss out on the lower level that is semi-hidden. The drinks/food is average but you're really going to come here for the amazing Hudson river views. I had the Park burger which is pretty substantive. The fries are delicious in the most grease-er-ific sense. If you're feeling bloated after the meal, feel free to try out the swinging rings just steps from the restaurant. It's an amazing workout!",1,1,
20,Gwin v.,"New York, NY",4,84,0,4.0,6/23/2017,"Ellington in the Park is a great summer hangout. Formerly a concession stand that was run by the Parks Department, now it is a private enterprise that has upped its game. The views are amazing, the staff 100% accommodating, and the drinks are delicious. I didn't adore my tacos, but the other food my friends got was better. I'll definitely be back... though probably just when it's nice out :)",1,,
21,Steve N.,"New York, NY",97,575,23,4.0,9/12/2015,"The upper terrace was perfect for a Saturday afternoon happy hour. This is a lovely neighborhood place. The concessionaires are committed to making this a delightful space. The numerous tables were comfortable. There was a bar created from a repurposed shipping container at the north end. The main cafe, downstairs from the terrace, looked inviting. All the food we saw, looked good enough for me and the GF to want to return for a meal. Here's some deets:Coney Island draft, 7Chips and guacamole, 10 - very good Sauvignon blanc, gls, 9 - fineTOTAL, 35TIP - there are two levels, the main dining area was downstairsBONUS - remarkably clean restrooms - and I almost never notice the restrooms",3,,1
22,Ryan T.,"Manhattan, NY",11,75,95,4.0,8/19/2016,"Although this place is a little rough around the edges at times, it more than makes up for it with the view an atmosphere. A perfect place for a happy hour beer, watching the sunset, and maybe a quick bite to eat...this place is definitely one of the better outdoor bars in NYC. Along with boat basin, pier I cafe, and frying pan, Ellington in the Park is situated with views of the Hudson and is a popular summer bar. However, Ellington tends to be much less crowded than the other 3, which you can end up waiting for 30 mins or more on a nice afternoon to get a seat. They have a decent beer selection (some locals like fire island and Bronx brewery) and solid food. I honestly wouldn't get the cocktails again here as they were pricey and a little watered down.The real highlight is the location: the upper terrace has tables overlooking the playgrounds and the river and the lower terrace often has live music with a similar view. Definitely an awesome spot to chill out with a brew and enjoy the NYC summer....they are also dog friendly as well!",6,,
23,Sarah P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,38,0,5.0,6/3/2017,They let me bring my puppy to the bar and were very nice. I split a fig and goat cheese pizza and lamb sliders. It was a very nice place to spend an afternoon.,1,,
24,Jeff G.,"New York, NY",19,13,0,2.0,8/10/2017,"My companion and I sat down at a table in the lower section of this two-tier bar and restaurant in Riverside Park at 105th Street. For approximately fifteen minutes we sat in fairly peaceful quietude with a little chatter from nearby diners as well as the intermittent laughter of the children playing in the sand of ""Hudson Beach."" It was around 5:30 pm on a very pleasant Thursday evening in August.Suddenly, someone turned on the ""music."" Rather loudly, we were drenched in hits by such classic acts as Matchbox Twenty, Daughtry and The Score (as per Shazam). Our few fellow diners included a couple of middle-aged guys, and elderly couple and a young mother with her toddler. Who was the establishment playing this loud pop drivel for? Some staffers choice probably. The music was irritating and certainly spoiled my visit.The meal, The Riverside (burger) w/Fries for my companion, and Riverside Quinoa salad for me. Both were tasty and substantial enough but hardly worth the seventeen-block walk.The service was friendly and courteous. A waiter went to the upper level to find me a dry vermouth. And, with seeming concurrence, a waitress did ask the bar tender to lower the volume at our request. The only slightly reduced sound didn't make up for the incongruent and stupid pap.",,,
25,Nate C.,"Manhattan, NY",12,211,7,5.0,7/7/2016,"Hesitant to write such a glowing review because I don't want people flocking here, but this is really a great spot. I run by this place frequently and finally decided to stop here on a sunny weekend afternoon. The sun beamed down on me and so did the friendly bartenders. There's a great view of the Hudson, a few small TVs behind the bar if you want to catch the big game, and a quality listing of cocktails. The bar is seemingly never full, but it looks like the tables do fill up. This is just a lovely outdoor bar and restaurant",3,,
26,Katherine L.,"Washington, DC",212,608,546,4.0,6/17/2015,"This is such a fantabulous venue for a small gathering or celebration of life's gifts.  The waterside view and shady arboreal appeal provide the best that Riverside Park has to offer when seeking a watering hole with some decent vittles.  With a simple but fitting food and beverage menu, Ellington in the Park allows you to now stay in the Park for much longer without worrying about passing out from dehydration or starvation if you didn't bring your own.The service is friendly and attentive.  The seating is upstairs or downstairs, shady umbrellas or sunny open seating upstairs and covered open view downstairs.Love the casual atmosphere.  Count me in should I be here in Riverside Park again.",5,,
27,Diana A.,"South Ozone Park, NY",8,204,268,3.0,9/10/2015,Discovered this hidden spot the other day and loved it. The view of the Hudson is great ! Especially with a nice drink. Didn't get to try their food menu however because we had just eaten elsewhere. Next time I'll try out their menu. The park has some cool monkey swinging bars BUT BEWARE.... If your not a pro ..... The next day you'll have blisters on the palm of your hand !!! It's a great workout and nice way to burn calories those calories that you are at the bar/restaurant upstairs. Try it out!... I know that I'll definitely be going again!,1,,
28,Whitney U.,"New York, NY",0,23,9,3.0,4/29/2017,Mediocre bar food with a killer ambiance. Understaffed but kind. Great place to grab a snack or drink to watch the sunset but maybe get your food elsewhere.,1,,
29,Fred M.,"New York, NY",2,25,3,4.0,6/22/2017,Nice place to come eat outdoors near the Hudson River.  Blackened chicken was good according to my Hubby.  Veggie burger was good but could use some sort of flavored mayo or sauce. ( just being picky)  waiter was very cute and nice.,,,

34,Isabelle F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,15,0,5.0,6/19/2017,"My husband and I are regulars and frequently enjoys drinks and grub after a stop at the dog park. We just love the laid back vibe and easy food. So much so, that we just had my son's 1st birthday party on the lower level this past weekend, unsure of what to expect given we were hosting 40 people!  I am happy to say that the Ellington exceeded all of our expectations!! The manager I worked with leading up to the event, Koren, was always timely in her replies and very helpful in ordering all of our platters and securing tables. But, it was the staff the day of our event that really stood out. The manager, Damien, went above and beyond! And his entire staff was WONDERFUL. Despite the unfortunate rainy weather we had, we had a wonderful party. They went out of their way to ensure our guests were happy and we were always cared for! THANK YOU!",2,,
35,Katherine T.,"New York, NY",2,80,0,4.0,5/25/2017,I've been here several times. It's really fun to hang out in a bar in the park overlooking the Hudson. I always sit on the upper level. It can sometimes be difficult to get the waiter's attention. The food is pretty decent though and they have a good variety of drinks. I was sad to see that their frozen drinks have been taken off the menu though.,2,,
36,Tracy R.,"Manhattan, NY",16,21,1,5.0,6/16/2015,"I was excited to learn after some snooping that the Ellingtion in the Park was on Yelp! I was disappointed when I saw only a 3.5 star rating because honestly New Yorkers, this is as good as it gets. So please stop complaining about being an outsider and not being able to get a table quickly and expensive beer list.. this is New York shuffle up and deal. Anyways, my boyfriend and I we are ""park people"" in Riverside Park. We come to the park multiple times every day with our dog and family. Needless to say a stopping for beer midway through walking the dog is pretty much the best thing ever. The draft list is pretty decent for enjoying in the summer heat and the bottle list satisfies your more adventurous tastes. Wine and a full bar, and the bartenders know how to make a drink. Went for lunch on a weekend on the upper part - food came quickly despite runners having to transport the food from the downstairs kitchen. Got the chicken wrap and quesadillas - both good for quick simply park eats. The best part is the atmosphere... dogs are completely welcome, so are families - very friendly, neighborhood/community oriented vibe to the place. Not like the 79th Street Boat Basin. Great people watching onto Hudson Beach with sand volleyball and rings.  AMAZING SUNSET VIEWS. Honestly, I don't have enough nice things to say about this place!",5,2,2
37,Becky D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/18/2017,If I could give zero stars I would. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!

38,Michael C.,"Osprey, FL",0,36,0,3.0,6/7/2015,"I have been here many times and it's all right... Pros: The service has always been good. The black female manager (only using for identifiable purposes) was fantastic. The view is great. Cons: My issue is that there is ALWAYS a problem with something coming out of the kitchen or the bar. The drinks aren't great, and the prices are pretty ridiculous for the drinks. $24 for a pitcher of Coors Light and Pacifico? And the bartender didn't even top it off, so it's way cheaper to buy a beer by the glass.I like this place, and I hope it gets better. I would really like to keep coming back.",4,1,1

40,Victoria S.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",126,12,0,1.0,8/11/2015,"Food was alright but for the price but the most absurd part was the service. The service was slow and we had to physically grab a menu ourselves. The bartender charged us for a full bottle of wine rather than the glass I ordered.The only thing enjoyable was the sunset but it wasn't worth the extra $30 the bartender tried charging us. The sketchy part was he asked if we wanted a shot for the road. My boyfriend said sure and we walked away. When we finally looked at the itemized copy, we realized he charged us way too much. As we were walking back, the bartender sees us and knows that we know he overcharged us.Get your shit together. Never going back even if its a five minute walk from my apartment and will not recommend to anyone in the neighborhood.",1,1,1
41,Jay S.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,4.0,5/31/2015,"When I herd The Ellington had reopened the restaurant in Riverside Park I couldn't wait to go. We went to have dinner there on Friday, the food was great and our server was wonderful for how overwhelmed he was. The one thing that would have me not go back is that we had to fight for our table. With the volume of people they have going there they need a hostess. The server we spoke to when we first got there told us ""you have to grab a table when you see one open up"". So people are just hovering over other people eating and it was a mess. It made it an unpleasant experience. We saw a table open up and two other people came out of nowhere saying it was theirs. I know it has just reopened and the kinks are still being worked out. If they can work out the seating and how people can get a table I would definitely give The Ellington in the park 5 stars.",3,,

43,Paul M.,"New York, NY",9,130,5,5.0,5/24/2015,I was disappointed to see the old Hudson Beach Cafe close at the end of last summer not because it was a spectacular establishment but because it's nice to have a beer in the park on a warm night and watch the sunset.  From the owners of the Ellington in harlem comes Ellington in the park.  They've expanded from the upper terrace to the lower area with a view of the sandpit and rings.  The menu has also expanded with a greater offering of drinks and food.  Prices are comparable to Pier I and if you live in the area I would say it has a similar low key vibe.  There are more students/families with children than the broey crowd at boat basin.  There were actual servers here who were all attentive and yet relaxed about where you got your drinks and food.I had the chicken wings which were only okay and yet I'm still giving 5 stars because overall this is an excellent addition to the area.,2,,
44,Caitlin Z.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",39,58,222,4.0,8/10/2015,Cute place to stop and have lunch while your at the park. The offer traditional American food and also have a bar. Great views of the Hudson River and relaxing outdoor sofas to just have a drink or an appetizer.,1,,

48,Danny F.,"Seattle, WA",85,107,4,2.0,5/23/2014,"The park gets five stars but this little cafe gets two. It has a very limited selection of drinks (their beer menu is just three or four choices of bottles, for example), an even more limited selection of blandly-prepared food (microwaved? there doesn't seem to be a kitchen), but everything is overpriced. The location/view is all there is to recommend it. It'll serve if you want to enjoy the park and MUST have an overpriced bottled beer or whatnot while you're there.Another reviewer mentioned musical events here, but I come by often and I've never seen anything of the sort.",,,1

Also had chicken quesadilla, burger and skirt steak tart - no complaints. Riesling was nice too, My expectations were far succeeded! More low key neighborhood vibe than other dining options in Riverside Park.I only gave it 4 stars because the service was slow - the lovely Hudson River view and ambience masked the wait.",1,,
50,Tim B.,"Parsippany, NJ",0,4,0,2.0,8/2/2015,Good for a drink. Food? Meh.... Come here before 6p or after 8p to get a nice table. Pros:  you can bring your dogs!  Beautiful view!Cons: mixed drinks were poorly made i.e. Bloody Mary was tomato juice and vodka.  Nothing like described on menu.  Suggest only getting beer or wine or shots.  Anyone ever had a fried quesadilla?  Gross.  No grade yet.  After seeing the bartender stick his fingers in the olives...I wonder.,,,
51,Ly A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,9/18/2016,"Location: IncredibleSeating: A fair amount, including lawn couches and covered picnic tablesAmbience: Not so great cover bandMenu: Mediocre selection and overpricedService: Easily the worst I've ever hadThe view is amazing but I couldn't even enjoy it because I was so frustrated with the service.  It took 20 minutes before our order (of two drinks) was even taken and another 20 minutes before the drinks were served. Then, it was 30 minutes before we were checked on again. When we foolishly ordered another round and food, it took the typical 20 minutes for our drinks. But an hour after our food didn't arrive, we gave up, went to the bar and asked them to remove the food from our tab so we could just pay, leave and finally eat somewhere else. To top it all off, after the server took our check and payment at the bar's register, it still took 10 minutes to cash out.I would only recommend this place if you want to enjoy the view and don't care to drink or eat (i.e., loiter).",,,
52,Devin R.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,2.0,7/21/2016,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me five times, shame on me. Every time I come here the service actually gets worse. Food and drinks are ok, but not worth your time.",,,
53,Jeanne J.,"New York, NY",1,8,0,2.0,5/22/2016,"I'm writing this review on May 22, 2016. The weather is not that great. I say this to provide context: this is an outdoor bar and when the weather is not that good, it is not that busy here. I ordered a beer and chips and it took a half hour! A half hour. And no one even bothered to check on my table. It seems well staffed, so I'm not quite sure what the issue is that is delaying pouring a beer and bringing a bag of chips to the table. Good luck in the summer, I guess.",,,
54,Shannon F.,"Manhattan, NY",116,32,7,4.0,8/25/2015,This would be a 5 star rating if only there were fans during this hot summer. Blackened chicken wrap was Delicious and the side salad a great clean finish. Bartender Tash downstairs was really nice and attentive. Enjoyed seeing the manager walking around checking on all of the customers. She even checked on me :),2,,
55,Mark W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,1.0,5/14/2016,Owners have ruined the place this year. As regulars we've tried twice to go there and have got up and left twice. New policies and a refusal to listen by the owners have destroyed what used to be a great spot. Shame on them.,,,
56,Shael S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,6,0,5.0,1/26/2017,The food at Ellington is surprisingly good - one the best places in NYC to eat near the river.  Sunsets are beautiful and dogs are welcome which is a big plus,,,
57,Jill D.,"New York, NY",28,39,4,4.0,9/19/2015,"This is by far one of my fav spots in the city. It's so chill. The service is always good. The food is delicious (though, yes, a bit pricey for what it is). Bar is solid. no frills. plastic cups on the patio under an umbrella with your dog sitting at your feet kinda vibe. They'll even bring your dog some water which he or she will promptly knock over. Lounge upstairs (tends to be more crowded) or chill downstairs and watch grown-ass men try to use the neighboring jungle-gym. Once we had a real ugh experience with a server, and the owner discretely gave us a free round for our troubles. If it were a bit cheaper it would be a 5-star, but I get it. NYC.",1,,
58,John H.,"New York, NY",28,33,2,5.0,5/23/2015,It's actually called Ellington in the park.  Good beer selection and great food.  The wings are great.,2,,
59,Ira G.,"New York, NY",2,8,6,4.0,8/17/2015,"While I don't frequent such places, this seems pretty good.  $6 for a draft beer seems fine.  I paid $10 at a midtown place.  My fave is Shiner Ruby Red(bird).  Tastes of ginger and grapefruit.  Wasn't on online menu last I checked but it was downstairs on the board.  Food passed the test of some more critical peers.  Place seems busy (good).  I'm happy if they are doing well because they put a lot into it.  They might consider misters for those hot days and maybe those CityCharge stations like they have in Bryant Park.  As others say, it is dog and child friendly.  I am biased as I love the traveling rings and love the area.",1,,
60,Marc S.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",7,1,0,5.0,7/17/2015,"We love this place! As parents of a newborn, we love that it is baby-friendly, kid-friendly and dog-friendly, and in our neighborhood. We had limited options with a newborn, because we couldn't go to indoor places which are loud and crowded, so this was perfect. We met other new parents, too. We can show up in shorts and t-shirts, too. It's like sitting in your backyard on a summer day or evening.  The food is great. The music is great and not loud.  Totally mellow and relaxing.",1,,
61,Jess Y.,"New York, NY",608,47,2,5.0,6/5/2016,"I live a short walk away, and have found myself here on three or four occasions in the past month or so.  Lovely location in the park (though I imagine that if this area of Riverside Park is not within your regular walking / running / biking, etc. rotation, it might be challenging to find for the first time), with a view of the water looking west, which, as other reviewers have noted, is particularly lovely as the sun sets.  Prices are fair for what you're getting, which is a view and a lovely space to eat and drink in nature.  They've got a good selection of beers (both in cans & on tap), and I was pleased to see Sam Adams Summer Ale on tap as I'm partial to New England beers.  If sangria is your thing, I recommend Glenda's Secret White Sangria, a ""secret Irish recipe passed on from generation to generation.""  Now, that's probably embellished at best and a plain old lie at worst, but it *was* really delicious.  Their fried calamari is randomly epic.  Server/bartender Matt is great!  Definitely will be back soon, like this week.",1,,
62,Lisha P.,"Toronto, Canada",182,51,0,2.0,8/15/2015,Come to have a drink overlooking the river. The food is overpriced and invariably cold. The service is also inattentive.,,,
63,Vidya M.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",4,6,0,2.0,6/13/2015,"Location is great but food is pre-made, microwave kind of awful. We have tried salads, guacamole, burger, fries, and fruit cup. Every single dish was disappointing and flavorless. Drinks are okay but overpriced for amount you get in the plastic cup. Service is okay but be prepared to work for your food.",1,,
64,Ben F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,9/11/2016,Great extension of the main restaurant on w106 and Amsterdam. This location in riverside park is amazing along with great food and is very pet friendly!,,,
65,Jamie F.,"Manhattan, NY",25,21,4,2.0,5/10/2015,Cute spot. Convenient for our dog run trips. But $5 for a can of soda and a bag of chips? Ripoff.,,,1
66,Bernd E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,2.0,7/12/2016,Great location! But really bad service....they couldn't get a burger to me tonight and two weeks ago. And when I asked where my food was I was just given excuses. I was there for 90 minutes and they could not even get a simple burger done. Disappointing that this great location can't get a decent operator.,,,

69,Bradley G.,"Manhattan, NY",123,6,9,3.0,5/17/2015,Nice location. Beautiful view. They have a pretty full drink menu that they'll show you while mentioning that none of it's actually available. Tonight there was only Coors and Blue Moon on tap and the only wine left (of the 10 or so listed) was the Riesling (inexplicably listed with the reds). Growing pains? Hopefully. Will be back later on this summer to check in.,,,
70,Jennifer B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,1,2.0,6/1/2015,"Oh Ellington - you know better!  You have another restaurant!  You can't claim newness on things like crowd control and drink quality.  You have the perfect location ... with too few tables.  But no worries, just let me get on a waitlist.  Better yet, give me one of those little square 'caller' things - you know, the ones that light up when my table is ready?  Just don't make me and my group stand like seagulls, waiting to swoop in on a free table.  In other words, let us spend our money as we wait at your bar instead of making us vie for tables with the other vigilant and oft aggressive New Yorkers.  Speaking of bar ... how 'bout an IPA on that menu?  And if I have to order mixed drinks, let's make 'em higher quality.  We are far from picky folk, but the three adults at my table couldn't bear to finish the pitcher of strawberry margaritas.  I switched to a mint margarita which tasted like straight lime juice out of the jar.  Then I gave up.  Again, you've had a bar for many years (down the street); you know what good drinks are.  On the bright side:  you have basic, inexpensive food in a perfect, outdoor, kid-friendly location, as well as one very rare NYC item:  kind wait staff.  Get the waitlist going properly and the decent drinks flowing, and you'll be unstoppable.",5,1,2
71,Anita W.,"New York, NY",38,2,0,5.0,7/3/2015,"Excellent place! Great food, great service and management. Such a wonderful addition to the park.

72,EM H.,"Atlanta, GA",4,23,0,3.0,10/12/2015,"The location can't be beat, but the service is so ridiculously slow that it makes me insane. We tried it again today. It was the same. We had drinks and a hummus, which was tasty but came with too much hummus and not enough pita. When we asked for more pita we were told we'd have to order another one. Ridiculous.",,,
73,Josh H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,5/27/2015,"I had big hopes for the Ellington's take over of this quiet spot in Riverside Park, especially since their restaurant on Amsterdam is quite nice, but this place is a contemptuous amateur hour. The service was horrible, food mediocre, and managers rude and detached. I sure hope they turn it around -- it's early yet -- because they have some prime real estate overlooking the Hudson, and it would be wonderful to have decent management of this long-forsaken corner of the park.",1,,
74,Jeanette L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,258,19,4.0,6/20/2013,"A welcome find in the neighborhood. Great little spot to rest your legs after a bike ride. Sip a beer, listen to live music, and watch the set over the water.",1,,
75,Nicole G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,3.0,6/22/2015,"Great location, music and vibe. Service was slow and sloppy. Food was mediocre for the price. Drinks were weak--stick to beer or wine. And they charged us the full $12 for a virgin strawberry margarita for my two year old daughter--ridiculous. Hope they get it together because it would be a shame if they didn't. Best for snacks and drinks, don't expect much else.",,,
