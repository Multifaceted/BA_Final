0,Dane B.,"Arverne, NY",87,16,27,4.0,5/21/2018,I got the Pork with Brandy mustard sauce. It was very flavorful from the carrots to the beans and rice and the pork as well. Very happy with the meal. There's ample space to eat in as a lunch spot although I had my meal to go. Would eat here again.,,,

4,Keith H.,"West Hollywood, CA",0,4,0,1.0,10/11/2018,"Whenever I've gone here in the past, I've gotten great service, but recently I've gone here with a black co-worker, who was treated horribly by the cooks in the back. They told him they were too busy to serve him, and they overcharged him for his meal without explanation. The cashier up at the front didn't understand why the charge was so high, and reduced it to the fair, listed price, so it worked out in the end, but still. That's some bull, and this is NYC. Have a little talk with those line cooks, and maybe then I'll consider returning.",2,,

7,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,3.0,9/20/2017,"I've probably walked past here millions of times over the years since I work fairly close by. It looks really cute from the outside. It survived Sandy, which downtown is an accomplishment for a restaurant or cafe. It looks Eastern European by the name and the design, however, the food is generally just what you would get at any fidi cafe lunch place. Over-priced expensive mediocre sandwiches and salads. I went with a special pre-made sandwich when meeting up with a friend that just started a new job downtown, joining the club. I rarely eat out on lunch and usually bring something from home so it was a different treat for once. The godfather sandwich was thinly layered salamis, pepperoni, provolone, tons of oil on a baguette. Had half the sandwich and was full and saved the other half. But I wasn't eager and heavily anticipating even going after the sucker hours later. My friend went with a make your own salad buffet and it was just meh. Lots of beets ended up somewhere in there. Didn't notice until I sat down that they also have a pasta bar and quesadilla station. Interesting and different. A bit heavy for a mid week lunch but nice options. I feel like there are way better and more affordable spots in the area. Everything is just okay but there is a certain amount of charm about the place.",2,1,1

The sandwiches looked much better as did the salad bar. So as I'm walking to the check-out I grabbed a water bottle only to realize later in the day that the bottle had already been opened. It was super annoying but I took the bottle back to the store and the manager let me exchange it for a new one even though they were clearly closing which was super nice.  I want to give this place more than 3 stars because the manager was super nice but I'll revisit this review after I try a few other items on their menu.",3,1,1

After the delivery was a full 30 minutes late, the delivery guy had the audacity to actually YELL at me on the phone because I missed his call.  He never once buzzed and my phone was on silent. He lied about the length of time he was outside (I know because the time he said, I was on the phone with the restaurant asking where he was and the missed call was exactly 2 min prior to my calling him back). I had even gone out of my way to tip 30% prior because I know it's annoying. If the food was better, maybe I would give it another shot but that's not great either.",,,
16,Josie S.,"Lancaster, CA",18,23,17,5.0,5/25/2015,"Love this place. My husband and I have been here 3 times now-- once for lunch, and twice for breakfast. The staff are really quite nice. The blueberry scone is my favorite pastry thus far, although my husband is quite partial towards the cheese danish. Their coffee is yummy, and a medium (to me) looks to actually be a large--so that's a major plus.For breakfast,  I had the egg snadwich with sausage, and he had the french toast. Both were very delicious, an made fresh to order. They were reasonably priced (total cost for both breakfasts, 1 coffee and 1 danish was $17 and change) which is awesome compared to what we have paid for just a muffin and coffee here in NY :)For lunch, we had the build your own sandwich, pesto pasta, and a large BYO salad as well. All were amazing-- I haven't had a sandwich prepared this well in quite sometime. It was huge as well. We definitely couldn't finish it in one sitting. Husband enjoyed his pasta and raved about it for the remainder of the day. For all we got, it was $26 and change. Still not a bad deal at all.All in all, our experience here is great. I definitely recommend coming here, and want to continue going here for the remainder of our trip.",2,,1

Their ingredients are super fresh and the order never comes short of anything. Pretty much every omelette order comes with home fries which are super good and not soggy and with toast. I also Love the packaging and how efficiently it gets delivered. I'm also a huge fan of their chilled oatmeal which is deeeeeeliiicous. Definitely recommend koyzina if you're looking for a good quality and well priced meal.,1,,1

30,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",369,230,306,3.0,6/28/2014,"Stopped by this place for lunch and was pleasantly surprised overall. Lots of options and several different counters/lines for the different types of food (salad, pasta, sandwiches). It was hard to choose since everything actually looked and sounded pretty good; the pasta bar was especially tempting since you even get to make your own?! But it was ultimately a bit pricey - $9 for even a basic penne pasta or similar. Decided to go with the Mediterranean chicken sandwich, which was decent. The chicken itself was forgettable, but the feta was tangy and the bread nutty, chewy, and soft. This is the blandest review I've written so far, wonder if that says more than what I'm actually writing here? Good stuff, I'll stop by again.",2,,2
31,Jess S.,"New York, NY",58,182,64,3.0,1/23/2015,"3.5 for my first experience!In the grand scheme of things, $5.75 is outrageous for a bacon/avacado/egg/cheese on multigrain sliced bread. But that seems to be the average price for breakfast sandwiches in this area (goddamn it, FiDi, get your shit together), and I've gotten worse nearby for the same price. Review adjusted accordingly.I asked for swiss cheese, but got american (I really dislike american cheese, so that's a shame). However, the sandwich overall was more pleasant to eat than the cheaper alternatives. While others will make me this (correct) sandwich for a dollar less, it ends up dry and tasteless. So I guess the extra $1, the convenience to my job, and clean/spacious atmosphere makes it worth it.There was a LOT of avocado in here (which was my craving, and why I justified $6 for a sandwich). Thank you. I've gotten charged $2.00 for wimpy avocado in my BEC's before. Bacon was thin but not too hard, not too soft. Not a lot. The cheese overpowered the sandwich (no.. my hatred for American overpowered the sandwich).I'll come back the next time I'm craving avocado.",,,

I got the standard issue egg-and-cheese-on-a-roll and it was satisfying.For a place that does a mostly cash business, they should set their prices so they come out to a nice round number with tax.

However; they recently raised their prices about 25%.  These days for a chicken cutlet wrap with ONE PIECE OF CHICKEN CUTLET they charge (with tax) right under $11.  ELEVEN DOLLARS for one piece of chicken cutlet, some lettuce, and mustard on a wrap.  That is utter insanity.  After 6 years of eating there an a regular basis, generally 2-3 times a week if not more, I will need to find another lunch spot.",,,

45,Dweam G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,50,6,1.0,12/7/2012,"We got displaced out of our office after Hurricane Sandy.  This deli is the closest place to the new office.  First off, it's been 2 weeks and while every other place in the neighborhood can process credit cards, they still have a sign that they will only accept cash.  I went downstairs for a cup of coffee at 3:00 pm only to find out that they remove the coffee after lunch.  I thought this was a bit odd since most office drones usually get coffee almost religiously around that time.  So, off to Financier for my afternoon cup $1.50 for a small coffee, but it's really good coffee so it was a nice treat from the more expensive watered down hazelnut Koyzina serves.I went into Koyzina for a soda around lunchtime.  The advertised price is $1.25.  The cashier rings up $1.36.  I asked why.  She replied it was taxable.  Since when is a can of diet soda taxable?  I then informed her that all other stores in the neighborhood don't charge tax and neither does the supermarket.  The rude cashier responds ""we are not a supermarket"" and laughed in my face.  I researched it and yes, even diet soda is taxable, but it was the manner in which she responded to my concern that was very upsetting.  This is not the first time that the cashiers are rude to me.That was it...never again.  Their food is overpriced and not that great to begin with.  The cashiers are rude and clearly do not care about the impression they make on customers.  The only thing I am sorry about is that Pita Press is owned by the same people and I like their food and service very much, but I cannot in good conscience continue to support treating paying customers this way.",2,1,

50,David K.,"Mount Laurel, NJ",268,198,552,4.0,10/24/2011,"GET PASTA YOUR WAY AT KOYZINA KAFEWhether for breakfast or lunch, this place has something for everyone. If  you come here for the salads, soups, or sandwiches,  there is something here for everyone. But what sets this place apart from all of the other wall street cafes is that this place cooks pasta to order.The pasta bar offers 12 ""pastas of the house,"" but the real fun is in making your own dish.Step 1: Choose from 7 types of pastaStep 2: Choose from 9 different types of sauceStep 3: Choose from 13 different vegetable or cheese toss-insStep 4: Choose from 9 different meats and seafoodWith all of those options, the possibilities are endless. Often times I'll try recreating a pasta dish that I had at a local restaurant by rebuilding it off of its ingredients. And I have to say, that of the line cooks from behind the counter could give some of these high-end restaurant cooks a run for their money. Rarely do I tip in cafes because service is usually non-existent. But fair is fair and these guys always do the right thing by me, so I have no problem throwing them a couple of dollars for their effort. The line can get from hairy when a crowd gathers by the pasta bar, but I've never seen these guys ever get an attitude with someone giving them a special order.Seating is scarce, but if you have the time tell them that you'd like your meal to eat there and they will serve it for you on a porcelain plate instead of your takeout dish. My only peeve is that you practically have to beg the cashiers to give you bread and cheese with your pasta. I must have been there 20-30 times for lunch and every single time that I come in there they make me go through the same routine of begging for scraps of bread.After having written this review I'm now getting a craving to go back there again.

57,Cindy C.,"Long Beach, NY",0,16,0,2.0,2/26/2015,"Watch out for the pricing. Started coming here regularly at lunch because it was close to work and clean enough that I felt comfortable getting an, ah ok salad. But I always walked out of there spending twice as much as I thought I would pay.  Don't appreciate the tricky stuff. So at lunch I  started going to au Bon pain on Fulton for a fresh chilled salad. Gave  Koyzina  another chance for breakfast today omelette made wrong and  cashier charged me an extra 2:50 because the potatoes  were put in a separate container. Although $2.50 will not make or break me or most of the people  working and eating down there, it probably goes on all day. I don't appreciate the ""rip off people in a rush"" attitude and I would not recommend this place.",1,,
58,Matt C.,"Los Angeles, CA",158,45,13,3.0,8/13/2008,"This place is not the very best, but it's a huge step up from it's block away neighbor, Taz Cafe. The prices are reasonable and the food is fresh. The inside is very clean, and well taken care of. The real downside to Koyzina is their hours. Why do they close at 4:45 on weekdays???",1,,

61,William F.,"Bethany Beach, DE",0,204,0,2.0,11/8/2014,"We tried this place for a quick breakfast, since it looked decent from outside, but we were disappointed, starting with the lack of clean tables.  The food reminds one of student cafeteria food, but not at student cafeteria prices.  The ambience wasn't much better.

I've mostly come here for breakfast (Bagels, Hot Chocolate, etc), but later in the day for lunch they have a Salad bar, Pasta bar (big portions served), Sandwiches, Wraps, and Soups. Prices are reasonable. There's a lot of seating available and the place is kept clean.",2,,1
67,Andrew W.,"New York, NY",34,371,0,3.0,1/19/2007,"Koyzina is really close to my current office, so it's a good place to go when the weather's bad or I don't have much time, but still want to feel like I'm not going to the cafeteria in my building that  fills the need, but hardly the void. It's remarkably expensive considering that the bulk of their business, average sized sanwhiches, paninis and salads are the same as you can get everywhere else. However, the pasta bar in the back is excellent and where to go here because the ingredients are good and the portions are large. It's still an expensive lunch (usually at least $8-$9 for the pasta), but at least you have that warm, slightly sleepy feeling all afternoon....",2,1,2
68,Julie G.,"London, United Kingdom",674,1000,19,3.0,9/12/2011,"I really would give this place 2.5 stars, to make it a truly ""average"" review.  The food here is substandard to anything else you can get in the area.  This is a great alternative to walking another 500ft to Zeytuna with less options.  The only redeeming factor here is their hot bar.  If you're in the mood for a hearty lunch because you know you won't be eating dinner or just feel like being a fatty that day then I highly recommend hitting this up.  Otherwise, their wraps are pretty tasteless and costly considering.",,,
69,Tom C.,"New York, NY",23,47,3,3.0,7/11/2009,"Let's start with the bad: in 2004 I had my first lunch while starting a new job at Koyzina Kafe.  Shrimp and pasta.  I was vomiting in the bathroom two hours later and had to leave work early.  Not the first impression I was hoping for.I avoided the place for the next 3 years, but I'm glad I started going back.  The daily lunch specials are good portions and good to great food.  Koyzina can be a bit pricey, but it's generally cheaper than Zeytuna and the food is comparable.  Note that, like Zeytuna, the lunch crowd really descends on the place a little after noon.  Also note that paying by credit card takes an extra 60 seconds or so, as they use old swipe machines.  They also have a breakfast setup that is just mediocre.  I usually only go when a fresh-squeezed OJ craving hits.  I especially recommend the pasta dishes.  But avoid the shrimp.",,,

71,Diana N.,"NY, NY",73,646,0,3.0,8/21/2008,"Centrally located in the downtown Wall St. neighborhood, Koyzina caters to the busy professional looking to grab food and run back to the office.  However, if you need to take a lunch break, there are also tables laid out cafeteria style.Like any cafe near office buildings, Koyzina offers sandwiches, wraps, salads, hot pastas, chips, and beverages.  I ordered a Thai Chicken wrap today and it was decent.  It's pretty expensive though, if your office has a cafeteria, that's probably a better bet.",,,

Koyzina Kafe scores on both counts when it comes to pastas! They have a bunch of pre-defined choices which they cook in front of you, but you can also get your pasta made to order (pick type of pasta, sauce, veggies/meat/shrimp, and other herbs / toppings. They have several tables if you'd like to sit and eat there, or you can take it to go. A tad pricey for lunch, but the food quality & quantity are both good.",2,1,2
