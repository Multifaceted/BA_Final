0,Steffi J.,"Brooklyn, NY",289,172,371,4.0,7/25/2018,"What an amazing bar! Really love the after-work ambiance of this place. It's very spacious and there's tables in the back for parties larger than 4 (I would suggest to reserve them beforehand). Came here to celebrate with food and drinks with my friend and we were welcomed by a strong margarita from the bar (definitely try one!). Afterwards, we grabbed a table and ordered some appetizers to start off the happy hour night. I had the Fried Mac & Cheese with Sweet Potato Fries while my friend had the BBQ wings. Cheers to the cook! The food tasted pretty good and came out pretty quickly. One thing I would mention that knocked off a star- there were no take out containers...on a Wednesday! I don't think I've ever came across this kind of problem before so I was surprised when the waitress told us she was serious. Either way, great food and drink happy hour spot!",1,,
1,Naeemah D.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,7/20/2018,"I've been to this place for happy hour a few times over the past year, and eventually decided to have a corporate happy hour that I was organizing for my office. I worked with Hannah and she organized every detail from to bottom. She was truly fantastic to work with! There were a bunch of little things that came up last minute and she handled all of them without issue. Our server was great, really attentive and quick with the drinks. Speaking of drinks, their happy hour specials are AMAZING! The margarita and lychee martini were the faves from the group, but all of the drinks were great and the prices were even better. This is a great place for an event (3 floors worth of space), or just an after work happy hour spot. It's summer so the rooftop is open! #win",,,
2,Liz H.,"Granada Hills, CA",38,22,15,4.0,6/11/2018,Great service at happy hour and a nice little rooftop bar. The cocktails are $7 at happy hour and there is a great selection of them to choose from. Great after work or after a long day of exploring the city.,1,,
3,Rossy M.,"New York, NY",2317,304,983,5.0,9/8/2018,"I'm mad it took me this long to visit this bar! I heard about it before but never got the chance to go until yesterday. The rooftop is small but very cute. We were a big group but still managed to get a table. Loved the ambience, very fun and laid back. Happy hour is until 8pm on weekdays, until 10pm on Saturdays and until close on Sundays. Drinks were great and very cheap ($7), the lychee martinis were delicious! I will def. be coming back to try their other cocktails.",21,10,18

Sat down at the bar, ordered dranks and the bartender was super cool. Everything was great UNTIL this creepy ass weird ass dude was lingering around us and makes a move on my friend. Proceeds to immediately say the following:When was the last time you were with a white guy? It's time to make a New York mistake. She then proceeded to ignore him, cuz ew and become more obnoxious, now asking all of us: When did you last get your hair pulled? When did you last get bang'ed?Insert fake laughter and rolled eyes.We try to ignore him hoping he'd just go away but he didn't so we had to do the: we're just here for girl time, thanks but no thanks kind of thing. Ladies, you know what I'm saying. We were nice but LEAVE US ALONE.He goes away  and I notice that he pretty much does the same thing to any female with a heartbeat in sight. Shock The bartender apologizes for this 'man,' tells us that he's a regular and a cool guy but can be creepy. ‍ Great.This fool comes back, and tries to get my homegirls' attention who's back is turned to him. She ignores him, he starts tapping her shoulder. Then he starts to grab her shoulder. Oh HAIL NO. I told him that he was not going to touch anyone without their consent and that we tried to be nice and we can be mean to him if that's what gets the point across. Surprised he could even see us because his pupils were so dilated, by the way. Goes away for a sec, and comes back AGAIN! I hear my friend say Are you fucking kidding me? And she texted me that it was time to go. He showed her a baggy with a clear looking powder in it, and when my friends reacted, he then gives the baggy to the bartender. As mentioned before, the bartender was really cool and was very VERY insistent on us coming out to another bar with him after. Before we left, I stepped away to the bathroom. While I was in there, the creep comes up to my friends one last time and shows that he's watching Pornhub on his phone. Luckily the security guard came and intervened, and we left.All that I'm presenting here are facts of what happened. My friends and I are grown women who don't take shit from creeps. HOWEVER I share this to remind all my girls out there to always stay alert and aware. Luckily nothing happened to us, and hopefully this can help prevent anything that may happen to any woman in the future. My only regret is I didn't take a picture of his face to post on here. Oh yeah, the margarita was aiite.",,,
5,Mark S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",8,120,201,5.0,5/12/2018,"Even though I haven't wrote a review for Latitude before but I love coming here,especially when the roof is open which it was when I came. I came during their happy hour which has amazing deals for margaritas. Me and my group just kept ordering them and throwing them back one after another. They were strong,not expensive, and tasty all at the same time. The bartenders were friendly and interactive and were quick with the drinks.I also love the social atmosphere here because it's usually a lot of people here just socializing and having a good time.They have 3 floors in total and the music is always pretty good and playing current songs.Definitely a go to place of mine in Manhattan especially in the summer time.",2,,1
6,Jenny N.,"New York, NY",178,200,342,3.0,2/3/2018,"Wow! Easy to get table service and the best part is that they give individual checks! Yay, not having to venmo or figure out who owes who later!!This place is spacious, so you don't have to worry about bumping into other people and there is a second floor too. I got their hot apple cider and it was Hot and tasty. It was sweet like I like it. Our server was nice and friendly. She also remembered what everyone got too! Drinks came out fast.About $12 for mixed drinks.",5,,
7,Mel L.,"Atlanta, GA",691,53,165,3.0,10/13/2018,"Good drinks, bad service at the bar since our bartender practically left us hanging but overall the food was good and the music and ambiance. We ordered the Bleu Burger which was Enormous and perfect to share with one more person. The flavors worked well together and I would only suggest less blue cheese dressing. It kind of took over the sandwich ~ so next time I would do ""light"" blue cheese. The fries were amazing and a perfect crunch to add to burger.",,,
8,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",947,751,3018,4.0,6/16/2018,"It may be located in tourist-central midtown, but this is more of a spot for locals. Latitude is huge, with multiple floors, and...A ROOFTOP! They have a decent happy hour special for $5 wines and $7 select mixed drinks (which happen to be good!). The food is your typical bar food, but it's pretty good too. I had the fried mac and cheese, truffle fries, and calamari. Look, was it the best meal? No, but I'm drinking, too much perhaps, and I need me some fried food to soak up the alcohol. It hit the spot for sure. The rooftop gets packed in the summer, come early to snag a decent spot.",3,,1
9,Jadira Q.,"Passaic, NJ",168,147,1102,4.0,11/21/2017,What a great spot!!Came here Friday night to catch up with some of my sorority sisters and had such an amazing time!! They were able to get a table right away and our waitress was awesome with bringing us rounds of drinks! I would totally go back and its pretty close to Port Authority :),1,1,
10,Jemima C.,"Washington, DC",159,166,158,4.0,2/24/2018,"If you're looking for a bar with good drink happy hour specials and mediocre bar food then this is the place. My friend and I enjoyed $6 Lychee martinis. For as busy as this place got the service was super friendly and prompt. We ate the shrimp and avocado quesadillas. Could have been way more seasoned. But again, bar food. We also had the Thai vegetarian spring rolls. Those were pretty tasty. Overall, great place for happy hour.",2,1,1
11,Karla A.,"Bronx, NY",344,121,136,4.0,12/17/2017,"Despite the heavy traffic on the FDR, my coworkers and I made it here on a Friday evening for a few drinks and apps during happy hour. They had a good variety of drinks on the happy hour menu for less than $10 each. It was quite crowded upstairs and downstairs and we had to wait almost an hour for seats. No biggie, we just hung out around the bar and had a few drinks. I really enjoyed the Pomegranate Fizz and a mango margarita (a bit too strong, but it did the job.) We finally got seated after basically hounding other tables and ordered food as soon as we could. Our server, Star, was very friendly and attentive which made the experience pleasant overall. She recommended the best drink and snack options. I went with the fried mac and cheese and was a little disappointed after seeing how tiny the serving was. No biggie, though. We all had a good time and were more at ease because we were seated. Next time, I'll be making reservations in advance so I don't have to go through the long wait. I'm also looking forward to trying the other food on the menu (*cough cough* nachos.) Overall, I definitely recommend this place for an after work hangout (big corporate presence here), girl's night out, and even a date, just reserve in advance!",3,2,2
12,Ross H.,"New York, NY",347,106,436,4.0,9/8/2017,"Came to Latitude after work for drinks with some friends to watch the football game. Place was way nicer than I expected, and had plenty of space, being as there are 2 floors and a roof.The second floor has a pool table and its own smaller bar, which is where we hung out. They have some great happy hour specials that end at 8pm during the week. $4 dollar coor's lights, $6 dollar margaritas.The food was also better than expected. I was expecting this place to be a sports bar with cheap finger foods, and it ended up having a very solid menu. I would call it high end bar food.The crowed felt like a lot of people came here with Co-Workers. Def was not a dive bar feel at all. A solid option to go watch some sports after work.",,,
13,Ridd M.,"Montclair, NJ",188,73,66,4.0,9/26/2018,"I really like this place to grab a drink after work. It's close to Port/Penn Station if you need to commute back to Jersey BUT doesn't feel like a tourist trap like so many other spots around the area. It's also very big (multiple floors including a small rooftop) so its good for small or larger groups. Even more, their HH lasts until 8pm, a huge bonus considering most are only until 6 or 7pm in the area. I believe their HH specials are $5 for a few beers, $6 for some wines and $7 for some cocktails. The cocktails includes many of their martinis and they have a lychee martini, which is very good! I've gotten a few apps here once and they were okay, nothing that would bring me back. I would stick to the drinks!",,,
14,Joy A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,10,26,4.0,8/10/2018,A fun spot to come after work with coworkers.  The happy hour is always extended to 10pm so you can't beat it!,,,
15,Rob G.,"Atlanta, GA",0,68,1,3.0,7/1/2018,"Rooftop bar is great, even for a sweltering heat wave.  Late happy hour and fairly stiff drinks (albeit limited selection) good too.  But service is terrible and limited seating on the rooftop make this suboptimal, plus the service was not...good.  I had to ask for my drink 4 times and we never got silverware, ultimately went to the bar and got it ourselves.  My wife loved her lychee martinis.  My chicken quesadilla (limited selection bar menu) wasn't great, but she did like her beer salad.  Overall for the price it's worth it for a rooftop seat, but otherwise take a pass",,,
16,Anna R.,"Jacksonville, FL",0,3,3,1.0,10/7/2018,"If I could give this place no stars and still rate them I would have. Bartender acted like he didn't have a liquor and when I order another drink, paid for said drink then noticed he had what I originally ask for he said "" oh we are try to close early."" Horrible drink and customer service.I understand you are in the the tourist area but customer service is still important.",,,
17,Jasmine T.,"Virginia Beach, VA",296,212,732,5.0,4/18/2017,"This place doesn't disappoint. This was my third visit here and only because I have moved out of town and I didn't discover it until right before I moved. If I lived in NYC I would be here every single week because its just that good. The most recent visit was on a Friday evening and I have been on Saturday before. The big draw to this place is the happy hour. They have Happy hour until 8pm on weekdays and 10pm on Saturdays. And the drinks are great so its not just a crappy happy hour.  The prices increased by $1 since the last time i came but that was almost 2 yeas ago and its still great prices. This place offers 4 levels you can hang out on to enjoy great music, good drinks and good food. Hard to believe that a place that is in the heart of Times Square offers something that caters to both locals and tourists alike. There is always a great crowd here and its never too packed due to the multi levels. In the summertime they have a small rooftop and I mean small. The last time I went it was summer and it was too crowded for me to get up there. I do know that if you want to go on the 2nd level where there is a poo table you need to reserve a spot. Not sure if there is a fee associated with that or not. Sometimes there are private events going on so there are some parts you cannot get to but still plenty of other sections to hang out. The only complaint I have with this place was the bathroom. Its unisex and lets face it men tend to miss the toilet for whatever reason. They need people monitoring the bathrooms to keep the floors dry as I shouldn't be disgusted to go into a restroom of an establishment that serves food. All in all a great place to visit and I will be back.",11,3,8
18,Brittney B.,"Sacramento, CA",0,11,0,2.0,9/26/2018,The rooftop set up is nice. The front door people were awesome. My server was horrible. There were only two tables she was serving. Another table was a couple there taking pictures of the food. Then people who clearly were friends with the bartender and server chillin at the bar. Server was more caught up in chit chatting than serving. She walked up to my table twice turned her back and talked to the photographers. All while I sat with no water. I'd rate it a zero but I enjoyed the outdoor rooftop.,,,
19,Jessica M.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",17,321,6,4.0,12/29/2017,"Came in with a bunch of friends to celebrate a birthday. They check everyone's IDs on the way in. They have three floors. The first floor was packed. We went to the second floor, played pool, and got drinks for their happy hour special. Someone spilled wine on me by accident (thankfully white wine), and the bartender gave a new glass for free. I thought that was very kind. We never made it to the third floor. Food is a bit expensive. I had some fries, so I don't want to speak for other items.Plan to return.",,,
20,Fanta D.,"New York, NY",599,28,59,4.0,2/28/2018,Great after work happy hour spot! Drinks start at $4 :) good hip-hop music too and there's even a rooftop.,3,,
21,Pat F.,"Bronx, NY",331,255,1807,3.0,8/6/2017,"I've been to Latitude more times than I can count, but have never made it to the rooftop. Thanks to Sunshine's UYE I had that opportunity.  This place is endless, with its multiple levels and bars located on each floor. Four hours of Happy Hour from 4:00pm-8:00pm is of course their most popular and can get really crowded resulting in a slight slack in bar service. But of course once happy hour ends the crowd lessens, service becomes more tolerable and drink prices resort back to premium. Standard bar bites are available, though didn't get to indulge. The consensus were that the few items ordered, sliders, fries, nachos and whatsitnots were just okay. After a few hours of hanging out on the rooftop, we ventured down one level to find a pool table area, with a small bar, an attentive server and dance music popping. We continued the party on the third level and danced the rest of the evening away...fun times for sure. Sunshine's event turned out great. She had perfect weather for those rooftop activities.  Her crew of friends included one person commuting all the way  in from Philly on a Friday and return back that same evening. Who does that?! Someone who values your friendship, that's who.  Plus a ton of Yelpers showed up and showed love. Good times at Latitude....good times. 2.5 stars - Service and bathrooms5 plus stars - Event",33,20,29
22,Shayna M.,"Somerset, Franklin Township, NJ",305,5,3,1.0,10/28/2018,"If I could give negative stars I would. We came here Sunday around 3pm the place was not busy. We sat down the waitress rudely came over and said what are you drinking. Didn't introduce herself. We only ordered waters. We are then waiting and waiting and had to ask her for menus. She huffed and puffed as she walked away and brought us menus. Finally we order our burgers, and she asked to take a credit card to leave on file. I have never heard of that when you are just ordering dinner. We were not starting a tab, and it make me feel very uncomfortable.  As we are waiting we are sitting at the tables close to the bar, the waitress takes a dirty towel that was laying on the floor and cleans the table next to us. As we are still waiting we look over and she takes a shot of alcohol with the bar tender and some other random worker, not paying attention to any of their customers. Our food finally arrives. Our waitress disappeared. We didn't have napkins or silverware. Not once did she come over to ask if everything was alright. Not once did she come over to refill our waters. Overall it was a terrible experience because we had a waitress who didn't even care about her tables. We are normally very generous tippers, but we gave her a low tip and will NEVER return to this restaurant.",,,

24,Taryn C.,"New York, NY",274,729,37,3.0,7/17/2018,"This place gets points for having a rooftop in midtown.  It also didn't seem to be a tourist trap as most places on 8th Avenue can be in the theater district.  I felt their happy hour was decent and their food was reasonably priced.  We were there for a party for one of my friends, who reserved a table.  It helped well, since we had a place to order our drinks and get our food on.  They served us mini pizza quiches (which were very good!), dumplings and other items.  We ordered some sliders and truffle fries.  The sliders, well, I've had better - they were more like burger ""shots"" but they were OK nonetheless.  Their truffle fries were outrageous though.  Now here's the kicker - my husband isn't the most fashion forward guy, and he wears nothing but shorts and t-shirts.  When we arrived, there was a sign that distinctly said, NO GYM SHORTS, HATS OR T-SHIRTS.  Which was, uh, a problem (my friend who hosted the party never mentioned it).  But the ID checker didn't say anything and we didn't get flagged.  But still, a bar in midtown Manhattan? This wasn't Le Cirque.",,,
25,Shayla C.,"Newark, NJ",366,42,73,4.0,2/26/2018,"This place is cool and has a pretty good happy hour considering it's proximity to Times Square ($4 $5 and $6 drinks) There's usually a good crowd there, although items not really a dance-y or party vibe, it's more so a good after work spot to hit with a group of fun friends.

Came for a private party so we were taken upstairs to the second floor and had a red rope as a barrier for our private space. Drinks were delicious, the raspberry peach lemonade was my favorite and the. the georgia peach cosmo took second place. There's a decent view of the busy manhattan street, view isn't crazy but it still carries that manhattan vibe you might look for. The design of the place is vintage wallpaper-ish and wooden floors. nothing upscale. I wouldn't mind coming back i won't go out of my way. lol.",2,,

31,Marlena K.,"Brooklyn, NY",186,505,1247,2.0,5/4/2017,"$4 coors/bud light $5 wine $6 martini drinks That's basically the only reason to go, during happy hour. They have three flours. First one was crowded, dark, cozy. Second was closed?  The ""rooftop"" which was overcrowded and non impressive was also nothing special. Service is on point. Strawberry basil Martini and lychee martini were okay, really nothing special and not strong at all. The strawberry basil martini was a bit to sweet for me. I would probably not go back for two reasons 1. The firehouse is located right across the street and it is so loud to constantly hear sirens. 2. The music is good but no one is dancing. I personally love to dance when I drink and everyone was just sitting, it was boring. My suggestion is go there for one drink, if thats you're vibe stay, if not go to the east village and get down to Michael Jackson thriller.Cash and credit accepted. Service is on point.

I'm only giving 3 stars because the first waitress we ride we had reservations for 15 people they put us in this small section where people were play pool they were so close to where we were sitting one wrong move would of caused one of us to get hit the head with a pool stick the bartender upstairs told us that we had to come her one by one and order what we wanted instead of getting us a waiter ? So we asked to be moved because that was just ridiculous there was space for us downstairs so I don't understand why they put us upstairs in the first place . Because we were a large group we each had to put a card to the waitress. I would go back here however I would be more specific about my reservation where I wanted to be seated.,,,

I love my lychee martinis they are the best.its super easy to reserve a space to hang with friends  I like the second floor because there  is  a  pool table. And it's a bit easier to get drinks on that level. No hustle and bustle of the crowd.  I love that  they have a reverse happy hour too. I think it's  until 11pm. That is the best thing. It's a mixed crowd food is great. Music is  cool. Place to go if you are looking for a chill time with friends. Pros: reverse happy hour  and also a happy hour.  Pool table because who doest want to play pool while drinking. Food late into the night and positive vibes. Rooftop. Numerous levels to party like a rock starCons unfortunately  I don't have any at the moment guess I should give it 5 stars.,7,1,1

I LOVE nachos, but these weren't that great. I think it would help to use different chips and add a little more flavor to the beans, or make guac instead of just slicing avocado.",,,
40,Maurice A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,26,19,3.0,6/24/2018,"Latitude is a hit or miss sometimes. Not with the drinks or food but with the customer service as well as music. One Friday you can be dancing to the latest R&b hip hop, then the next week you're doing the ho down. It's really that random. The drinks are iffy depending on the bartender (so, guess that is hit or miss, huh?) we've gone here for many years. Just for drinks and food.

I can't think of anywhere in the country that has such extended happy hour times that also sells $5 martinis.It has become a go-to spot for me and my mom, me and my husband, me and my friends...you get the point.While I know I can expect a strong and cheap martini, I've also learned the service has been spotty and the food is just average.  I know to come during happy hour and avoid eating for the best possible experience. My rating would absolutely be lower if food, full prices and late night crowds were factored in.I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they added lychee and pomegranate martinis to the happy hour list. They also have a trendy little rooftop for summertime outdoor drinking.While Latitude is never a final destination spot for me, but it's so great to have a go-to for inexpensive martinis in NYC.",7,2,7
45,Yi Z.,"San Jose, CA",246,56,58,3.0,3/14/2017,"Loved their up to 10pm HAppy hour. Lychee martini was AMAZING for only 5 or 6 dollars. They were delicious and strong. The server running on the floor didn't impress though. She gave us attitude after misheard us for ordering water. We were gonna order drinks from her though. So we ended up just ordering from the bar again. We got a table with a large party on second floor later, ordered some food. Regular bar snacks, nothing impressive. People who were hitting pool kept on invading our space. We had to move around so we are not in their way. Drinks from second floor bar was not as good as the martinis we got earlier from first floor.",,,

This is one huge venue - especially by Manhattan standards! - with several floors and a rooftop deck. Due to their popularity, this bar gets packed. I'm not a fan of absurd crowds[1], and they've got the absurd here.Even though there's a slight fratty meat market vibe inside, Latitude avoids being pretentious. Bouncers aren't douches. Hand a bartender your credit card and randomly point behind the bar. They'll cheerfully get you wasted. For your sake, let's hope it's happy hour.[1] Yes, I know I live in New York.",7,5,4

When I or another member of my party would bring the drink back he would give an attitude and say ""well thats how the drink is made what do you want me to do, make you a new one, not going to happen.""

The drinks are decent too, don't sleep on the Tito's Tuesdays. They have happy hour even on Saturdays. The regular drinks are not overpriced if you don't want house liquor.

57,Candace H.,"Brooklyn, NY",296,246,516,4.0,8/2/2015,Latitude is by far one of my favorite places to go in Manhattan! I've been coming here for about 2 years now. I originally looked into  it as an option for a place to celebrate my birthday but this is a great place for any occasion. I always say I'd be more of a regular if I lived in the area. They have a list of $5 and $4 happy hour specials. The drinks are strong and the food is amazing! The lychee martinis and the cosmos are fantastic! I don't drink much else when I come here. I've never ordered any food here that I didn't like. The Philly cheesesteak spring rolls and the fries with three dipping sauces are my go to items to snack on. The cheesecake is pretty good as well as far as desserts go. I've seen the place get pretty crowded on weekend nights. Like wall to wall crowded; however at other times for instance during the day it's much more mellow. I feel like this place draws in a pretty mixed crowd as far as tourists and locals. It's also a great place to watch any sports games. There are several televisions for your viewing pleasure. The music is always good and adds to the trendy yet laid back atmosphere. There's also a rooftop area open in the summer. Unfortunately I haven't been up on the rooftop yet but it is on my to do list. Service can be somewhat spotty and inconsistent but I totally feel that the drinks and food are definitely worth it every time!,13,10,12

We loved the drinks although they are a bit on the pricey side for the size that they are. We went around 2:30pm which is why it was not crowded but i can imagine that it can get crowded because of the location and that it has 3 floors.",,,

You can tell most people just got out of work... Last timeI went the waitress was really nice. She messed up our order and when we told her about it she just quickly corrected. I only gave 4 stars because I never get the chance to go on the rooftop but it gets crowded and I get out of work too late to catch a good spot.,2,,1

But I vaguely remember them closing the rooftop at 12am. Which is stupid because hello, that's the best spot in the place. I will say there are very steep stairs that make you feel like you're climbing a mountain and when you go down them, it's actually pretty terrifying if you've had 5 shots and 6 drinks already lol. Just be careful! The food was pretty good as well. I'd deff recommend this place for a fun, easy going night.

Our office is a few blocks away, and according to pictures this had a nice roof and cheap drinks. I was not disappointed. The drinks are strong for only $5 (I stuck with the margaritas) and they also had bud, bud light and coors light for $4 until 8:00. My friend got the pomegranate fizz which was champagne with pomegrante juice which looks delicious.The rooftop was SUPER crowded, but I guess every rooftop is going to be for the next 4 months especially after the arctic tundra we just experienced. Not the BEST rooftop I've ever been on, but I don't think there are any better ones in the area and there definitely aren't any that have $4 beers. Overall - this is a great spot for an after-work gathering as it is convenient to midtown offices and inexpensive. I would definitely consider organizing another work event here.",1,,1

But we first didn't get the correct fries, then the bartender blamed us very passive aggressively like we didn't know what we ordered.

The place is nice, good ambiance. My friend ordered a screwdriver and complained that it didn't taste right. It had something of a tangy, sour taste, as if the orange juice was bad. Now, if too much vodka is added, it will be strong, and this is easily identifiable. Too little and it tastes more like orange juice. But the taste my friend described (and confirmed by another in our group) could only mean that something funky is going on. Nevertheless, the bartender was unsympathetic and refused to make it right. I, however, had a pleasant experience. What I'm about to report next may not be the norm, but we couldn't help but notice that there were at least 5 different people that were so drunk they could barely walk. One girl actually puked on the bar. Seems to be a bit of overserving going on here. One of the golden rules of bartending is to cut off those who are visibly drunk. That obviously didn't happen here on that particular night in a few cases. It makes for an uncomfortable situation. Overall, my experience was a bit uncomfortable at times, but decent for the most part. With all of the different places to go in NYC, I will probably choose a different location during my next visit, which I hope will be within the next few years!",4,1,1

Bar up there with some seating and tables. Bartenders where kinda slow and looked totally disinterested. Guess they weren't too thrilled about serving us and the group of button down shirt techie-nerd bro's that were also inhabiting the space.Also, to me the tap beer tasted a bit nasty, as if the beer tap lines had not been cleaned in a while. Or, that could also have been due to the fact that I had to drink crappy beer for happy hour. Oh, and the nachos we ordered were a horrible soggy mess. It is a pretty sleek looking spot with nice decor and clean bathrooms. The rooftop bar is also a plus for those looking to party outdoors during nice weather.

The margaritas were the best, and really good esp. 4 $5. I had a veggie burger.  As with hells kitchen restaurant's, the food was aright and a little more expensive than you'd expect.  We also had some nachos with rice on them... kind of alot of carbs with ur cheese and sour cream.Our table was served by several servers, a couple of them were super sweet and accommodating.It got to be a really lively scene as the night went on.Not sure about for food but I'd definitely go back for drinks-happy hour.",4,,

It's more along the lines of a lounge that serves above average typical bar food. The great thing about this place is the ongoing Happy Hour specials they have. Did anyone say ""Happy""? Yes, I'll be there in a jiffy. Happy Hour is Mon-Fri from 3pm-8pm, Sat 12pm-10pm & Sun 12pm-4am.4/5 stars simply because the music is unbelievably LOUD! So loud that I felt myself shouting the same order over & over again until the waitress decided to read my lips. Also the reason for 4 stars is because there's way too many stairs. The space is decent, lots of floors but who wants to do all of that walking when they've been drinking? Certainly, not I!I don't recommend getting the Happy Hour drinks: Pomegranate Fizz or the Strawberry Basil Martini (barely tasted the alcohol & it lacked the taste I was looking for). Definitely get the Cosmo or the Apple Martini. I also had a L.I.T which was on the small side for $12 a glass (not worth it).We had the small BBQ Chicken Quesadilla, large Shrimp Avocado Quesadilla, and an order of French Fries with extra Cilantro Aioli dipping sauce.

I went for happy hour yesterday with my close girl friends, we sat and ordered some drinks then we ordered our food. the steak rolls we ordered came out COLD, after we bit into the rolls we realized the rolls were too cold to eat! we asked our waitress to take them back and order us a new batch. she had an attitude and just grabbed the plate and walked away. The new batch that our waitress brought us had our bite marks from the previous ones we had. They basically took the cold rolls we bit into and put them back in the deep fryer! THIS IS VERY UNSANITARY AND DISGUSTING! 2/3 of us are servers and we know that is never suppose to happen ! when we saw that we asked for the manager. before the manager came to our table he visited the bar and chatted with the bartender and let her play in his hair for about 5 minutes.... then he came to our table. While at our table the manager looked very under the influence.  I'm very dissatisfied. The waitress at no point apologized or asked us if we needed anything, her service was terrible.",2,2,

106,Karen N.,"Bronx, NY",69,43,123,3.0,4/23/2017,"We came here on a Saturday for our 2nd check in from a night of bar hopping in the city. We were there around 8-9pm and were able to get seating easily. We were surprised that there was a happy hour offer until 10pm and ordered some Lychee Martinis. The drinks were kind of strong so that's a plus for me but not so much for my bartender friend. We also ordered fried mac and cheese and edamame. No comment on the mac and cheese as I didn't try it but the Edamame was pretty awesome and had a decent amount for $7. Some were extremely charred but I ate it anyways :P This is a pretty great place to have appetizers and happy hour drinks with friends and not too loud to be able to have conversations. They were playing some 90s mixes the night I was there - no complaints from me, I was singing along :) There were large tvs so I guess it is also a good place to watch a game and have a drink. One thing I wasn't too thrilled about this place was that I kept having to chase or try to flag the waitress for attention. I wanted to place another round of drinks before 10pm. When I finally was able to flag her down, she told me happy hour was over. I probably took more than 5 mins to try to get her attention. She wasn't really attentive.Now we were a party of 3 people that night and when the bill came, we were already charged 18% gratuity on our bill. My friend and I decided to treat our other friend so we split the full bill to be charged to 2 credit cards. They were fine with this but after a week when the credit card transaction went through, I was charged an extra $6 from my signed charge. I have no problem paying the tip if it wasn't already calculated into the bill but now they charge me an extra $6 for no reason and without my authorization. I really like this place for the food and drinks but if I return, I'll be sure to pay cash to avoid this issue.",1,,

It usually gets crowded towards the evenings but I have never gone past 6 or 7p.They have great drinks and food.  I really like their calamari. It is tender and lightly battered. I usually get the happy hour special drinks and one of my favorites is the Lychee Martini.. Unfortunately on this last visit it was mediocre.. I had to have the bartender make it again.. And the second time it was drinkable but not the best I had from there.. I always ask for extra lychee too. And the bartender was mm just ok.. Took some warming up to her, she wasn't right off friendly.. And for me I feel when you are in a service industry you should at least have a welcoming nature, whether you want to be at work or not.. First Impressions are everything. It can make a person's perception of you good or bad. But mostly the bartenders there are friendly.

From this first experience I noted that the bartenders are pleasant. I ordered a margarita and there was such beauty in watching the bartender being so heavy handed with the tequila.As for non happy hour prices, I'm the type to order a drink, give the bartender my card and pray that the receipt doesn't come back with a ridiculous number. Thankfully the result of looking at my receipt didn't make me want to faint so for that I appreciate you Latitude and your reasonable prices :-)  I especially loved that they serve food until late.

We noticed, that the first bill Totaled $129.00 with a suggested gratuity added which was $21.32. Totaling to $150.32. When my husband sent his Credit card back to be charged, another check was in the book staying that the check was $145.00 with another suggested tip of an additional $23.96. Suggested Total of $177.96...So essentially, our server Brittany was suggesting that we tip her $45.28.  If we had not paid attention to our bill, Brittany would have gotten a darn good tip for serving us drinks. Good try Britney, but we aren't some unsuspecting tourists from out of town!  This is very bad practice, and had us wondering how many people actually double tip at the establishment.

AND, the waitstaff will bring your ""deck food"" up about 200 steps so that's pretty sweet.Our server was polite, even if she was heavy on the ""sweetie"", and the menu had plenty of variety and options. We got the hummus, sweet potato fries, and each got a wedge salad. The food was good - sweet potato fries were the definite highlight. Ranch on the wedge was delish, veggies were fresh, bacon was good. Tortilla crumbles were stale and would have been better left off. Hummus was okay, a little grainy, but the pita with it was yummy.

Drinks prices are what you should expect from a midtown bar on a Saturday night but nothing outrageous.

139,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1851,4.0,5/17/2013,"Latitude is a clean and modern upper-middle class type of bar playing mostly party pop music that occupies 3 spacious floors (I suspect the middle floor is only open for business during busy times). I'm rating this place solely on their happy hour specials and rooftop bar I'd have to give them a solid 4+ stars. Until 8pm they have a few beer options for $4 and a few martini and margarita options for $5. This gets extended until 10pm on Saturday and until close on Sunday. The rooftop is on the smaller side but does have some comfortable patio style benches and a bunch of high tops as well as a small bar. Unfortunately the beers they have on special aren't on tap here so you get less for your money as they pour a bottle into a plastic cup. It's a bit of a turn off that everything here is served in plastic cups (even the martinis) but overall the whole drinking on an outdoor rooftop patio in midtown for $4-5/drink is something not to be missed. They do have a small rooftop menu of reasonably priced food like sliders and whatnot. I couldn't help but notice the normal prices here are just too much, $7 for a Stella, especially when it's being poured in a plastic cup isn't my cup o tea.",1,,1

The drinks are great for happy hour and the rooftop is cute. The crowd is very diverse which I love! People are friendly and approachable and I believe the rooftop does that to you. I never had an issue with service. The bartenders were super cute and friendly. Food was good for bar food, definitely give it a go. And the music is also popping so there are no complaints. I love that is near Port authority too because I live in Jersey and I can walk my drunk ass right to the bus all happy and ish.",,,
141,Alexandra K.,"Philadelphia, PA",504,207,268,5.0,11/18/2015,"Last night was my third time at Latitude Bar & Lounge. At this point it pretty much one of my favorite bars in NYC.The first time I was here was a Saturday night in June 2014. The music was great, the crowd was super-chill, and the drinks were excellent. My friends and I were dancing by the bar while people around us were hanging out and talking, and it was all totally cool. The second time was my first time trying the weekday happy hour. Great prices on cocktails, I'm not a beer-drinker so I didn't mind the lack of choices there. But even their regular prices on beer aren't really high, so it was still a solid happy hour spot for me.And finally, last night, the biggest challenge of all because this involved a group reservation for a charity fundraiser event - from start to finish, it was a fantastic experience. The management was very accommodating right from my phone call the day before to inform/ask permission for the event, and when we got there the manager himself came out to greet us and direct us UPSTAIRS, where we had our own private set-up! It was pretty excellent. It was a great, fun atmosphere and our whole group was into it. The drinks were great (I highly recommend the strawberry basil martini), the food was tasty (we had the hummus platter, two orders of nachos, edamame and quesadillas), and the service was friendly and quick. We had such a good time, I'm really glad I chose Latitude for the first fundraiser of our Cupid Undie Run team to benefit the Children's Tumor Foundation. Great to have an option that's good for events, happy hour AND dancing.",4,2,5

144,Sharon T.,"Queens, NY",850,1051,1785,4.0,8/13/2013,"Sometimes I underestimate just how much a lounge/club can offer. For a Times Square lounge, I have definitely overlooked the aesthetics of Times Square businesses. Latitude offers more than you can imagine: a bar, pool table, no cover, happy hour, friendly staff and a hell of a good time. I first came here with a group at night and while we were disappointed that the rooftop bar was closed, we happily settled for a table downstairs for some shots and enjoying twerks that have made their way to our walls. You can look at this place in so many ways as a bar, lounge, dance club, restaurant, billiard or as a rooftop bar. Either one works because it is about 3-stories high and has a bit of everything. The food is average but no complains. Happy hour here does guarantee a good time, although the atmosphere is like an Applebee's or TGI Friday's. The drinks are only $4-$5 and while you're at it, have some food. Average quality but it's passable as something to go along with your drink(s). I had the veggie burger, which, to my surprise, was not as bad as I had imagined. The sundried tomato spread was probably what made the burger good but then again, I was drinking and eating so I wouldn't know. The fries were limited but amazing. The nachos, you can say, was a ""hot mess"" of nachos and cheese and a bunch of junk piled up. It was average, had it not been for the dipping sauces. I can't say I know too much about bars and lounges in Midtown, but Latitude is definitely one of the better ones, given its surrounding area. Plus, the waitresses are all nice and friendly, even the bouncers!",,,

147,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,3.0,9/3/2014,"Midtown is a dry well for finding neat and relaxed places to chill for happy hour. Usually it turns into a bunch of bros and hos getting their slop on. Like any other place, Latitude is kind of a bro and ho place. BUT when your friend lives near here and you are cheap, you're pretty limited on spots to check out. I haven't been here in years. It was packed to the nines as usual. They have $5 Margs, Cosmos, appletinis, something called a pomegranate fizz, lychee martinis, and strawberry basil martinis. Also, if you are feeling non-adventurous - $4 Bud, Bud Light & Coors Light. What a fine selection of craft beers! I jest. I did try both the margarita and strawberry basil martini however. Both were surprisingly strong.  The margarita wasn't made with that disgusting sour mix most establishments use too often. The strawberry martini had a unique flavor and kick but was just a little too sweet for me. Can't imagine what the cosmo and appletini are even like. This is girl drink drunk to an extreme degree. My friend Anna and I split an order of their black truffle fries with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano for $9. It was decent. I liked the crispness of the fries and there was enough truffle oil, maybe not enough cheese. The side of black truffle aioli it comes with was where it was at. But I don't see this being worth $9. It's a paper cone of French fries. Latitude, it has been awhile, but you are still just A-Okay in my book.",3,,1

Bartender in the corner on the second floor was helpful AND good looking (i feel like its usually either or). If this is your first time in NYC, and you're touring Times Square like the noob you are (get off at Port Authority, did you now?), this would be an excellent spot to spend the evening after walking around the area.Well appreciated - the close proximity of the restrooms, and the sheer quantity of them.

149,T. N.,"Waipahu, HI",274,39,180,1.0,10/18/2016,"This is the worst bar I've ever been to. Walked in around 11pm with three other friends on a Friday night hoping to maybe go up to the rooftop. Asked the cocktail waitress, CAIA, if we were able to go up... ""Um, I'm not sure if it's open, let me check."" She comes back to our table stating that the other two floors are closing at midnight. So FYI - rooftop and other floors closes earlier than the ground floor.For a Friday night, a bar close to Times Square , it was pretty empty... we should have taken that as a sign of WHY it was empty. The waitress nor bartender did not know what ""chasers"" were to shots.. she claims that they don't normally do ""chasers"" at this bar. We bar-hopped everywhere in NYC and this was the first bar that gave us a hard time about chasers. But ok, whatever, no big deal.Anyway, our bill was a little over $100 and they slapped on a Gratuity charge on our bill. Coming from the food/restaurant industry, I can understand if a Gratuity charge was with for maybe a party of 5/6 or more... but there was only 4 of us! Caia said that that's what they do if a check is over $100 since people don't necessarily know how to tip. She proceeded to give us the WORST service any of us have ever received. As a waitress, you should be able to talk to your paying customers in a respectable, professional manner instead of being SASSY. I'm not sure if it was her first day or she had a bad night but still! So, if your server is CAIA, I would ask for another waitress right away!!!",2,2,

Affordable drinks!I've been to Latitude a few times and each time the experience was good to great. The bar is 3 floors, 1st floor is more of a sports-type bar with TVs and plenty of seating for dine-in. 2nd floor is empty space with a bar and a few couches, seats and tables. The 3rd floor is an outdoor ""rooftop"", not huge, but enough spacing for 50 people. They have happy hour every M-F until 8pm and what's great is that it doesn't get extremely packed. There are usually seats on the 1st 2 floors during the evening with the 3rd floor always being standing room. HH consists of $4 Bud, Bud Light, Coors Light and $5 Margaritas, Cosmos, Appletinis and a few other drinks. The food is also excellent, with the fries being extremely addictive! I get them every time and they come out toasty hot, crunchy, reasonably portioned -- not like those greasy limp strings called fries at fast food joints.The music is also fantastic as they usually mix in 80s, 90s and current hip hop/pop. Finally, the service is likewise very good as the waitresses are attentive and come by once in a while to sweep for food/drink requests.

Then you notice that it lives up to its name with multiple floors and a large open level staircase in the middle. It's really pretty cool. We were on the second level, with the pool table (that has seen better days...), and it was more than enough room for everyone. In addition, there were multiple bathrooms right there for our use. Speaking of which...Bathroom: While small, they are clean, inviting, and well lit.Staff: Only really interacted with our private bar tender and she was decent. She seemed a bit annoyed at being there, which I found a bit odd (probably b/c it was just one big tab and no one, except me, was tipping her for drinks), but was not mean or anything. The other staffers also did an awesome job of keeping the food coming at all times.Food/Drinks: They have a full bar and lots of beers, including some specialty ones, and the food was great! We had chicken fingers and little quesadillas (both were excellent), bite-sized pizzas and spring rolls (yum!) and chips and salsa. Everything was very good, which can sometimes not be the case with large party platters.Value: It is difficult for me to speak for how far your dollar goes as everything was paid for the entire time we were there...I have been here several times for other happy hours and always had a good time. This is a staple location for people at my firm and it will remain so into the future.",1,,

Obviously they are more geared towards the work crowd migrations. For a bar they also have a pretty extensive food menu that should cover everyone's tastes unless they're vegan. Even then, I'm sure they could give you some carrots or celery...They have three floors but the second floor is usually just a special/corporate event space. Beer options are more limited other than the first floor in terms of draft so be prepared to trudge downstairs if you really want that pumpkin beer (or any other seasonal) on tap. Setting up a private space is very easy.

174,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1044,25538,4.0,8/18/2011,"Ok, so my friends generally have a penchant for celebrating anything and everything, personally I think it's one of their many endearing qualities. So this night we were celebrating my close friend's 1 year anniversary since she moved to NYC from Miami. By celebrating we did what we do best. Drink (and some light eating). We made reservations for a party of 10 at Latitude in the Hell's Kitchen/Theater district.          I don't often drink or eat in this neighborhood for a variety of different reasons...several places are overpriced and very poor in telling tourists and locals apart (ie. they're money grubbing, greedy jerk faces), tourist traps galore, lots of congestion (both cars and people) and generally clientele is rather douchey...just calling a spade a spade.          Now, my anniversary friend, Rachel, chose this place and since I was surrounded by people whose company I enjoy, I grinned and beared it. Latitude is a very trendy bar . So drinks their signature drinks were a little on the pricey side ($10-12 which I think is a lot for the atmosphere, I mean who are we - a hotel bar? No.) but their happy hour (which I only enjoyed for about 25 minutes since it's over at 8pm) was GREAT!! $3.50 house margaritas, $4.00 cuba libres, $4.50 cosmos/apple martinis and $3.75 bud/bud light/coors light. Since I checked in on FourSquare my first cocktail was FREE...free drinks always make me smile =].          First I had a vodka tonic, it was meh, rather weak. Then I sampled one of their crazy concoctions, I really wish I remembered which drink I got - it was white, frothy and REALLY stiff and was served in a large martini glass. My friends opted for one of their sweet, candy inspired cocktails that even came with a rock candy stick inside - this drink, albeit sweet, also contained a generous amount of alcohol while the males in our group were pleased with their beers (and YES, bartenders can indeed fuck up beer).           As the night went on it seemed to me like the music kept getting louder and louder at this place. DJ spun mostly top 40 pop/hip hop such as Beyonce, Ke$ha, Britney, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga - you get the picture. Now I can get down with top 40 pop divas, but my friends and I were practically screaming at one another to get heard - this is especially annoying because I'm sitting 5 inches from someone and still shrieking. This is definitely not a first date place or a bar to have any sort of serious and/or meaningful conversation at - but it's excellent for spur of the moment group sing-a-longs and putting your dancing skills to use.           So now we have the munchies. My friend ordered their grilled marinated chicken tenders served with cilantro aioli. For $8 dollars the serving was pretty small (she got 2 orders after realizing this), but they WERE delicious and the aioli was not too oily, awesomely rich and the chicken was extremely flavorful and well seasoned.           I tried my luck with the Pizza Margarita (also $8) this was described as being a ""homemade pizza topped with marinara, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil"" - I picture that someone ran home to their ""My Easy Brick Oven"" popped a little pizza in there, hopped on a Vespa and brought it to my table. I won't sit here and say that this pizza did not taste good, because it did - but this pizza was really small - think 5 inches wide. A typical bar pie is 8 inches wide so if you're going to go the smaller route, give me 7 inches. Girls often say things like ""size doesn't matter, girth is more important"" - well this pizza could have used more in the 'girth' department. Also the basil could have been a little fresher, just sayin'. The cheese and sauce was great though and the crust had a really nice consistency - crispy, but not hard.          Our server (I want to say her name was Sarah, but don't quote me) was really awesome. She made drink recommendations to everyone in my group, provided really fast service and always made sure we were taken care of and happy. In all, I might come back here for a quick jaunt if I find myself thirsty in this neighborhood - but if I need a real dinner I would take my wallet elsewhere.",15,11,11

We were met with inattentive bar staff who finally deigned to take our order. When we went to settle the check, the bartender conveniently ""forgot"" to charge us the special football game prices and we had to remind her and have the bill changed. The overall experience left an unpleasant taste in my mouth, as I am quite sure she knew she was overcharging us and just seeing if we were dumb enough to pay. Even for a Times Square area bar, this was bad. The tap selection was decent but not good enough to get me to return here.",,,1

177,Prasad J.,"Jersey City, NJ",119,52,34,2.0,1/9/2016,"It's very good for groups..  loud music and good food.. they also have pool table upstairs.. I would recommend upper area is better.. they also have rooftop bar which is open in summer.. This place has a coat checking at basement, which no one told us until we found out ourselves.. taking 2 stars for food.. they could have better offering in food.. also waitress charged us regular price during Happy hours which is weird....",,,
178,KMan C.,"New York, NY",0,22,310,4.0,9/15/2015,This place is pretty big (the entire building). It fits large or small groups. Go to the ground floor for the usual bar scene and meet the crowd. Go to mid-level if you like it more quiet. Go to roof top to enjoy the city views. There're some cheap happy-hour drinks and the food is good too for a bar.,,1,

180,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1898,816,5.0,8/28/2013,"Latitude is an awesome bar that midtown desperately needed! I've been here a few times for birthdays and gatherings with friends and have always had a great time. The rooftop is poppin and the happy hour is quite popular - it's $4/$5 beers and margaritas and an assortment of cocktails. I had the pomegranate fizz and it was delicious. Someone in our party got sliders and fries, and someone else got a vegetable and hummus plate. There are a couple floors between the ground floor and rooftop that were as empty as a haunted house so it's kind of funny walking between those and heading to the crowded rooftop. Anyway this is a great place to hang with friends. There's no dancing fyi. Overall, it's a nice space to gather with friends, have a bite, and drink some drinks. There's no cover, no line, bars, and a pool table (not on the rooftop).",4,2,1
181,Ebony Z.,"New York, NY",4,13,9,4.0,11/22/2015,"Awesome place!!! Very nice, cozy atmosphere and the music mix is wonderful! I have been twice during happy hour. I love the $5 Lychee Martini's and also the Fried Mac&Cheese. The staff is great! Victoria and Brittany was amazing!",,,

183,Neil J.,"Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco, CA",104,15,0,4.0,7/2/2015,Happy hours are pretty fun and relatively cheap. The Rooftop is pretty cool if it's nice out. Good place to start your night - or evening - if you're trying to just chill out with people after work. Waittresses/bartenders were pretty good with getting orders and were friendly.Haven't been there for anything but happy hours so can't comment on that yet. Only thing I was disappointed by was that they didn't have pitchers.,1,,
184,Benjamin L.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",1,27,18,3.0,10/16/2016,"Rooftop view was mediocre (don't waste your time), but alcoholic beverages were great and price was reasonable and I liked the vibe more like a older bar but new bar feel with higher ceiling and older booths styles.",,,
185,Jerome B.,"Midlothian, VA",242,15,0,5.0,2/20/2015,"Went this past weekend with my wife visiting from VA.  Went on a Friday night and got there in time for the happy-hour which was awesome.  The 3rd floor bartender was funny, friendly, and did an outstanding job.  I can't remember her name. We ordered the sweet potato fries and the calamari.  Both were awesome.  The bartender made me a custom margarita that I enjoyed all night.  Definitely a must go if you are staying across the street at the Hilton Garden Inn like we did.",5,2,1

187,Malcolm M.,"New York, NY",142,36,6,3.0,7/20/2014,Latitude was the venue for my sister's birthday party.  I had my doubts but I was generally very pleased with my experience.We spent most of the time on the rooftop. The rooftop has a bar that serves a limited menu and the views are less than spectacular.  The staff was very attentive and the happy hour until 10 was and added benefit.The rooftop closed at midnight so we had to relocate to the less than desirable second floor.  This is the venue you go to with big groups.  There was not a lot of dancing going on and the bar was pretty empty.,,,
188,Jay L.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,0,4.0,11/13/2016,Dropped by on a Sunday night and it was fairly packed. They had happy hour all day with drinks ranging from 4- 6$.It is dimly lit and service was fairly good. The drinks were strong which ensured that you really got what you paid for.They were playing a few college football games which attracted a decent audience. I would definitely come back for cheap drinks.,,,
189,Nikia C.,"Atlanta, GA",165,87,133,5.0,2/8/2015,"During a trip to New York to visit my sister for our birthday, we were trying to come up with something to do on our actual birthday, and there's no shortage of places to choose from in a city like New York. My sister came across a Groupon for Paint Nite, an event held at different bars and restaurants in different cities where an instructor guides you through creating a painting while you sip on the drinks and eat desserts that you can buy from the establishment. The Paint Nite we went to was held at Latitude Bar & Grill. The bar was pretty nice, and the food and drinks were reasonably priced. Our waitress was nice and made sure we were taken care of. Our dinner was the large shrimp and avocado quesadilla plate that we shared because it came with 8 pieces with a side of hand cut sweet potato fries that are served with chipotle maple aioli, brown sugar chipotle ketchup and cinnamon maple aioli. The quesadilla was awesome! Best quesadillas I've ever had. Seriously. We also had a Cosmo with our dinner and another one while we painted. It was happy hour, so why not, right? For dessert, we shared the chocolate lava cake, which was decent. Not something to write home about, but it was ok.    I would love to go back during my next trip to New York, especially during the warmer months to experience the roof top area of the restaurant.",4,2,2
190,Ashley B.,"Oceanside, NY",370,5,0,1.0,2/12/2016,"This was the worst bar I've ever been to in my life. The MANAGER TOM was wasted and kicked out people who he had just given a beer too. Deserves to be fired, never coming back again.",2,3,1
191,Shayna M.,"New York, NY",257,7,0,2.0,1/26/2016,"Door guy checking IDs is hilarious and very sweet. Place is really gorgeous - great stairways and long bar with plenty seating. Free coat check downstairs, but don't expect to be acknowledged by the two girls sitting in the corner of the coat check on their phone. When you do say, ""excuse me, hello!"" don't expect a smile either. What you can expect is for the unenthusiastic employee to warn you against losing your ticket. Now, as a person who grew up working coat check, I know it can be especially crazy when someone's lost their ticket and you have a mob of other responsible ticket holders waiting. This isn't the case in this coat check room. Space for 70 coats, max, with not one but TWO women to work it. Child's play. I don't need the warning. Luckily, there was a coat rack in our private room, so I promptly took my coat from downstairs upstairs. Our friend was having her 30th birthday party upstairs in the private room. We were early, so we got a great view of the spacious room and great seating. Very spacious and perfect for a private party. Now, let's start with what we saw as the worst part of the evening. When you are scheduled as the only bartender to work a large private party, you shouldn't scowl at your patrons or be short about their orders. I would smile, be courteous to the close-knit group of guests and bank as much tip as possible! Word got around the bartender was rude, and a select few of us would leave the party just to get our drinks downstairs from a lovely gentleman I cannot recall his name. Even the birthday girl had to complain.Food was awesome for bar food, music was just ok - dancy and top 40 and not much else.Needless to say, the place is a good choice for a private party but maybe the employees need some pep talk before their shifts to get in the spirit of SERVING PEOPLE.",4,1,2
192,Sharon L.,"Beverly Hills, CA",3,67,15,4.0,9/19/2016,"Very pleasantly surprised! Came in on a super slow Monday night at around 10pm. I had a great server, the Caesar salad with steak was awesome, and the price was definitely worth it. As for the salad, the steak was perfectly cooked! I would have never imagined getting such a properly cooked steak in a bar. I could have done without the croutons - but I'm a crouton snob, and picky when it comes to them. Based on the service and the salad, I would definitely recommend the place.",,,
193,Dione D.,"Atlanta, GA",104,514,298,4.0,2/26/2013,"I walked into Latitude because I needed to pass a few minutes between work and seeing Avenue Q.  The crowd was 'after-work,' but young-ish and diverse.  There were businessmen, but not super old or stuffy looking ones.  Multiple people came up to say hello and ask if I were okay while I was waiting on my friend.The music was blasting -- Ne-Yo, Swedish House Mafia, Calvin, Harris, Rihanna and Bruno Mars, club-style.  I immediately started bouncing and singing.Latitude's happy hour special is $4 beers and $5 martinis.  I enjoyed a very strong lychee martini (my fave!) before heading out to the show.I was only there for about 20 minutes, but I enjoyed the atmosphere and I will definitely be back!",5,1,2
194,Mike L.,"New York, NY",64,6,11,2.0,3/10/2016,"Got here at 8 pm and they were checking for i.d. Great atmosphere. Music may be too loud for some. Seat your self restaurant. Waitresses seem like they could care less about there customers. I started off with a ginger beer/whiskey, pretty small for $13, but hey, had a little kick, so I can't complain. Ordered hot wings and a Gruyere Caramalized Onion Burger. They did not ask how I would like my burger done and that should have been a warning sign. So I said I would like my burger done medium and the waitress said ok. So my wings get to the table, wings were not fresh. I get wings at every restaurant I go to and these were definitely sitting around a few days beyond the expiration date. But there was still hope, the burger gets to my table and of course my burger is Well Done although I could of sworn I asked for a medium cooked burger. They had the nerve to tell me the CHEF said he only makes burgers Well Done. I'm sry but why do you have someone in the kitchen who can't even make anything but a well done burger. So this is my warning to all of my burgers Bros out there, this is not the place for you. Stay far far away. Not to mention I asked for another drink and when my 2nd drink gets to the table they left my empty cup right in front of me lol. It was just a horrid food experience. Well it gets 2 stars because the atmosphere was great and the drinks were decent. Food is awful. Waitresses are lifeless, probably because there tip is already included. Will never come back. I might even come back and give it one star when it all sinks in.",2,,

It can be a bit overcrowded on a Friday or Saturday night if you're just popping in. However, for birthday gatherings they will give you a section and make sure you're taken care of.. definitely a plus!The music is top 40, so there is something for everybody to groove to.

197,Pjpaz P.,"Morristown, NJ",1,30,2,2.0,4/27/2016,They get as high as 2 stars because the wait staff is friendly and efficient. Both draft beers (Sam Adams Summer and Checkered Can) tasted like vinegar. The silver came pre-encrusted with food. Stay away.,1,,
198,Omar S.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",5,4,0,4.0,9/2/2015,"Went here last nite with an old friend for happy hour. The indoor decor was pretty nice and had a industrial kinda feel.  Rooftop bar was a lil small but felt cozy (could use some more tables/chairs).  The drinks were strong and were relatively cheap for happy hour. My friend had the Calamari in a sweet chili sauce, which was pretty good. It came with a peanut dipping sauce which was good by itself but a little too heavy for the calamari. The bartenders and waitresses were really nice and quick. Our waitress Viktorya was especially great, kept me and my friend nicely hydrated (or dehydrated?). Would definitely go back for the happy hour :)",,,
