1,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1898,816,4.0,6/12/2018,"VBar is a very intimate space that's a mix between a cafe and a bar, hence the name! It's unlike most places I've been to though. I love how you can get either a wine or a tea, I love how you can relax solo and read a book or meet someone here for a quiet conversation, and I love how you can get cozy in your own little nook by the long wooden tables, or you can sit by the bar. It lacks the comfort you'd see at a tea lounge (due to its rigid wooden seating), which will keep you from procrastinating, but it's got the genuineness and rustic vibe that'd make it ideal to meet someone at. You've also got board games in one corner, and romantic flowers and candles on the tables. So many dichotomies in one place! They have happy hour on wine ($6) and other items, like nuts and pastries. I got the jasmine tea, and I could tell it was authentic. The smell was so strong! I really enjoyed it. If you're down for a Village-y place to grab a drink or beverage, this is a place I'd suggest! Just be wary of how quiet it is - it might make your conversation with your company slightly awkward!",7,6,8
2,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4421,4416,35730,3.0,9/3/2017,"On our first evening in New York City this past summer, Jamie W. and I had some daunting dietetic challenges because we were in the city that not only doesn't sleep but also eats around the clock and some decadently delicious stuff to boot. Anyone up for the Halal Guys cart at 53rd and Sixth at 2AM? Our first meal took us to Brooklyn where we tried some very good vegan comfort food at Modern Love (review: bit.ly/2ewUQcy), and then we came back to Manhattan and strolled our favorite park, Washington Square, where anything and everything happens under that beautifully lit arch that begins Fifth Avenue (review: bit.ly/2vE54Ts).It was on a stroll through the village that we discovered this place which turned out to be a coffee & tea place during the day and more of a wine bar in the evening. We begged the hip server if we could have some tea, and she looked at us like we just ran over her cat. My response was to give her my world-famous pouty face until she was willing to make two $3 cups of Ginger Tea (photo: bit.ly/2eUDSFH). However, she wouldn't let us sit next to the front window at a table for four even though the space was pretty empty, so we sat at the big communal table. Regardless of the extra effort, the tea hit the spot and was a satisfying substitute for any sweet tooth temptations we would have otherwise considered.TEA - 4 stars...the ginger tea was most flavorfulAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...very villageySERVICE - 2 stars...its glaring wartTOTAL - 3 stars...all things considered",8,7,9
3,Michael V.,"Manhattan, NY",331,99,310,4.0,5/30/2018,"I really love this place! The vibe is always good here. There isn't a whole lot of seating, but there is free wi-fi. I love that it is essentially a coffee-shop that turns into a bar in the evening hours, or if you wanted to work/study and have a beer or wine (rather than coffee) that's totally your prerogative here. You could find a seat at a table, or there are also seats close to the bar. The bartender/barista was friendly, and was telling us about some of the different espresso drinks available. Cool vibes, would definitely come back.",,,
4,Jared H.,"Los Angeles, CA",317,27,43,4.0,4/13/2018,Great indie bar and coffee shop in Washington Sq. park area. Quiet and charming during the day and great place to get work done. Coffee is reasonably priced.It is very much a Greenwich Village coffee shop. Not the pristine wooden tables and counters you would find at a hipster coffee shop in Brooklyn. More of a dive bar feel.,1,,
5,Richard K.,"New York, NY",5,97,126,4.0,2/15/2017,"Loved this place! Its a genuine coffee spot with sweets and treats that slowly turns into a bar with beer and wine and what not.

Sitting in an area with many great coffee spots (third rail being my fav), Vbar definitely made itself stand out by serving one of the greatest pastry selection, and the rustic feeling that nowhere-else has.Though they do not carry skim milk, my barista was super nice and offered to substitute with almond. Kindly note that there's a 10 dollar minimum for card.Nothing could beat the moment of holding a cup of warm latte, sitting next to the windows, and enjoy the city view!",9,5,7

Updated review","Nice little coffee shop with a full bar right around the corner from Washington square park. The drinks are reasonably priced with usual items like coffee and tea but also mimosas, wine and beer on tap. There aren't too many places that offer free wifi so if you have some work to do but want to sip on coffee or a beer while getting it down, this is a nice place to be productive but to also enjoy yourself a little.",,,
8,Leena T.,"Secaucus, NJ",48,216,196,2.0,3/10/2017,"Vbar is everything you'd expect it to be.. from the exterior. Something about it just draws you in- it's cozy and inviting with a calmness that can't be described.These warm fuzzy feelings are amazing, until you attempt to place your order. Everything my boyfriend and I wanted to try from the wine menu was no longer available, and the ""similar alternatives"" recommended by the bartender had such off putting notes it was genuinely hard to believe we wer in a wine bar.Not sure why we continued to stay, but out of frustration we just quickly asked for the house wine, which wasn't any better than what we'd already tasted.The bartender also continuously left the bar (to smoke?), so getting the check when we were ready wasn't too fun either.",3,,
9,Tammy D.,"Queens, NY",51,51,3265,4.0,1/24/2017,"This is the perfect cafe (and bar) to drop in for a rest with treats for adults AND children. They offer coffees, wines, beers, and light pastries. There is one large communal table in the center room, a couple of smaller tables near the windows and stools surrounding the bar. I believe there are time constraints when you can use your laptop in the cafe, but that's essentially due to limited space for when the cafe turns into a full-on bar scene. I came during an early afternoon and had a great time catching up with relatives and friends based on the quiet and relaxed atmosphere. There was only the one bartender working, so we had to order and retrieve our drinks and food from the bar and take it back to our seats. He tried his best to refill our waters, but we had to pick them up from the bar. There was no waiter. I appreciated his chocolate latte art for the kids in our group, which was such a sweet touch.If you're in the neighborhood and need a more relaxing cafe with more seating (than Third Rail), I highly recommend coming into VBar.",3,,2
10,C B.,"New York, NY",6,34,4,1.0,5/15/2017,"Nope, will never go here again. The bartender told my friend 2 minutes after I paid for my drinks and went back to the table that ""your friend only tipped $3 on two glasses of wine, I live on tips. That is only 10%."" First of all, I tipped 12%, and she served every other table but told my table that we had to come to the bar to order. Twice afterwards, she came to our table and told us to return our wineglasses to the bar when we finished because there was a ""wine glass shortage."" The place wasn't even full of customers. She made us feel unwelcome and I will tell everyone I know to never go to this dumb place.",6,1,1

13,TJ H.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",0,24,12,2.0,3/25/2018,"I visited this place a year ago and it was a cozy place to walk into.  The bartender serving us wine knew exactly what he was pouring as well as the wines on the wall behind him. Very friendly and great music. I recently went in there again last week and it was a completely different experience. The ""bartender"" was completely absentminded. She didn't know any of the wines, misguided us on what was considered happy hour for wine so ended up paying double of what we thought the happy price was. We had to remind her of water we ordered only minutes earlier when there were only a handful of people in the place. Def needs to step up its game since it's billed as a wine bar.",,,

15,Jason R.,"Indianapolis, IN",44,48,41,4.0,5/29/2017,"A great little (and almost hidden) coffee shop near Washington Square park. This is more than a coffee shop though, they also have a selection of beer and wine for those who cannot stand the primary drink of the gods. They also have some basic pastries and whatnot. While they do have most of your usual coffee asks they're not on the Starbucks level, but they're also not Starbucks prices. Although one thing to keep in mind is if you're not paying cash you'll have to make a $10 purchase. This is also a good spot to study and you'll see several local college students drinking coffee (or beer/wine if they're stressing out over a term paper) but there are not a lot of plug ins for electronics if you need that. Overall though a really neat spot.",1,,1

17,T L.,"Berkeley, CA",21,51,0,1.0,6/24/2017,"TL;DR. Do yourself a favor and go to Third Rail or walk a few blocks to Kopi Kopi . If you read the 1 star reviews, you will learn that the bartender/owner is VERY rude and will tell you that you are not spending enough money to stay in his establishment (even if it is empty, hah, wonder why). ***I've been thinking about if I should write this for a long while now. But because I decided to end my relationship with VBar, I thought it necessary to mark the end of this once beautiful relationship with a letter.Dear VBar,I'm a big fan of your black coffee and the fact that you toast your croissants. It has to be said that a ham and cheese croissant paired with black coffee served by the exceptionally attractive guy behind the bar (I think he's there nearly every afternoon) is the best way one could spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. It started out as lovely as any of the other days I come here, adding to a nearly spotless record in my book, until approx 6:30pm. I ordered my beloved ham and cheese croissant sandwich with a large mug of black coffee. I settled into the corner and decided to finish reading a case for class. Around the time when the lights dim and the laptops are asked to be put away, I was faced with a very unpleasant conversation with a different man behind the bar (there seems to be some kind of switch around 6). He asked me if I wanted to order anything else. I looked at my mug, noticed it was still half full of coffee and decided that I'd probably leave soon anyway, so I politely declined. He then said that he had been there for nearly an hour and all he saw in front of me was a very cold cup of coffee. He then made it a point to tell me that rent on Sullivan ST isn't cheap and they can't afford to just be my library. PFT, well excuse me for living. I had only been there for a little over an hour, which was definitely less time than the others that were still around me with THEIR single mugs of coffee (and you for some reason, you did not make it a point to tell THEM that you needed to pay your bills. Do I look especially bully-able?). I also finished eating right before you switched onto your shift, so there, I had more than a coffee. But even then, who cares! You don't need to talk to me like that regardless of how unsatisfied you are with how much you've profited from my presence. As a local business owner, I think you should care about how you treat your customers, and that was really not cool.Truthfully, I understand the point you were trying to get across, but I think it's unfair for you to be so presumptuous and single me out for who-knows-what-reason. Why me, and only me, and not the other 4 people there? [The only difference I saw between me and the other people present were that they were white and I am not white. They were all men and I am not a man. Otherwise, we were all sitting quietly, we were all seated alone, we all had one drink in front of each of us, and 3 of us were reading a book. I've thought about the moment many times overs and I still don't understand why you tried to admonish me and only me. ] You had absolutely no idea how long I had been there or what I had ordered. But regardless of if I had spent $3 or $30, you really didn't have to be so rude about it. And honestly, I wasn't taking a space from anyone else; the place was empty, only 5 people (including me) were present. I was pretty much warming a seat that no one else wanted. That being said, there are MANY coffee shops in NYC that wouldn't at all mind me regularly visiting and being a paying customer. Plus, I don't know what you can expect being located one block from NYU Law School; you're definitely going to get a student who wants you to feed/caffeinate them and let them sit and read for a while.It really sucks for one cook to spoil the whole pot, but I don't want to go in every time wondering if today is the day that some jerk is going to tell me that I'm not spending enough money to satisfy him. I'm not interested in paying to feel extremely unwelcome. Goodbye VBar.",9,,1

That's fine we'll get another Cabarnet... oh wait its also out.The bartender then recommends us something similar that we might like... it was bitter, then he recommends us another wine... that was bitter too.We end up getting the house red.

My most recent trip brought me in for lunch. Got a croissant warmed up ($3), a bowl of nuts ($5), and a glass of the house red ($8). Amazingly chill and comfortable place in the afternoon, as I enjoyed my meal with no disruption. Solid tunes playing from the corners and attentive service really makes this a go-to spot.

They should probably change the cafe hours on their website to clarify and not have their own laptops out on the bar while telling customers to put theirs away, but I guess it doesn't matter because I would never come back.Here's the website hours- cafe hours should probably be changed because every other 'cafe' I have been to allows laptops:""HOURSCAFEMon-Fri: 9am-8pmSat-Sun: 10am-8pmBARMon-Thu & Sun: 11am-2amFri-Sat: 11am-4am""Also, my glass of white wine was warm and overpriced.",3,,

Updated review","Vbar&Café was a stumble upon stop thanks to my agitated and thirsty Mother and Yelp. She clearly was done with my walking, shopping and talking and, therefore, requested wine. It was more like CARRIE I WANT/NEED WINE. Without hesitance I whipped out my iphone that has the magical app called--Yelp. If you don't have it, get it. If you have it, add me and enjoy my spits of wisdom and rants. I promise you'll enjoy my excerpts just as much as I adore crafting them. Anyways...Back to this adorable finding of mine. This wine bar that they call Vbar& Café is quite the find. Owned by someone who has a fetish for what looks like voodoo art and/or African themes. My kind of person--I have an obsession with voodoo and magic yet I have no idea why. When I looked the bar up online they actually mention Karma, however, in a total different context than what I imagined. The bar offers a ""Karma Board."" This board allows you to gift someone with store credit/karma credit which they will find next time they visit the bar, and hopefully they continue the deed. The original board which has become a local's favorite, was the subject of a research conducted by students at NYU. Super cool, right?!  Who doesn't like doing a good deed especially when it has to do with WINE!? Wine Talk...Vbar& Café offers a rotating selection of over thirty wines from around the world, many of them organic and by the glass. My Mom and I purchased a bottle of white wine crafted in New York State--Can't remember what it was because I FORGOT to take a picture of the label...If you would like to take a gander at the wine bar, please go to 225 Sullivan Street and tell them I sent you!",1,,
29,Samantha A.,"Rego Park, NY",24,71,2,1.0,10/12/2015,"So in reading the other reviews apparently I'm not the only one that was at the mercy of the horrible bartender, and I'm here to echo all those before me: STAY AWAY. Walking by looking for a place to have a drink ($4 happy hour drafts), and this place looked cute and cozy. There were 3 of us and we took a high table by the window. Nice ambiance, and we enjoyed ourselves until one of us had to leave. Within minutes the bartender came up to us and asked us if we were waiting for someone else and how long they were going to take because that table was reserved for 3 or more. There were tons of open tables around us and it was completely unnecessary to come over like that. If it got crowded, of course we would have moved to a smaller table or the bar. Then he asked my friend if he could get him something, since he had just finished his drink, heavily implying that he better damn well order something else. My friend ordered a beer and went up to the bar after a bit to get it. He accidentally left his wallet on the table and only had enough for the drink. He came back to get money for the tip and said that the bartender refused to give him his drink without tipping. (He planned to come back and tip him anyway, but that is completely out of line to refuse.) The bartender also kept berating him saying, ""I don't know where you're from, but we tip in this country."" My friend is from Brooklyn and has lived in NY his entire life (with the accent to prove it, so clearly the joke was on the bartender if he couldn't figure that out). We downed our beers and left immediately, even though we were planning on having another friend meet us later. A clear example of how a total a$$hole bartender made VBar miss out on customers ready to drink the night away. I hope they fire this guy, but it doesn't seem likely if the owner is also a jerk.",15,1,3

Clearly intrigued, we walked in, and discovered it was both a coffee shop, with tons of pastries and caffeinated drinks, along with a bar, with beers on tap and a large selection of wines - talk about heaven? We ordered two glasses of wine - Sauvignon Blanc & Riesling - and were pleased with both of them (reasonable prices too, ~$11 per glass).

Well, all was well for a while. We sat in the corner of the bar and enjoyed drinks and a cheese plate (it's a small but cozy place). Suddenly, a man squeezes in behind me and shoves our coats to one side of the window (where they were resting) -- basically, he pushed himself into our space and handled our belongings VERY disrespectfully. We were shocked and annoyed but laughed it off to each other. The man actually then tried to ask what we were laughing about defensively and demanded to know my name. WHAT??? I told him to NOT mess with me and to just continue socializing with his friend (who was with him) because I was not interested in having words with someone over something so silly (or period). Plus, he was a man and I'm a woman. I found it very uncomfortable. But he kept demanding to know my name (as if). Turns out it was THE OWNER OF THE BAR. He was HORRIBLE to us and the bartender (who was quite lovely and friendly before this) suddenly became very UNfriendly and said, ""He's the owner. Don't you know who he is. You're out of line.""They were both disgustingly rude and obnoxious. It was almost comical. Why would you disrespect people who are paying for a service in your bar and who had been there for almost two hours having a lovely time?I heard from two other friends that they would never go there again because they had bad experiences. Wish I had heard about this before going.My friend and I left and went to another bar (there are hundreds of them in the Village!) and had a great time (and I didn't have to worry about being attacked by the owner of the other bar).STAY AWAY or take your chances.

It's dark and personal, even though you are sharing long granite countertops with the rest of the people there. Just find yourself a spot and sit down facing your date and whisper sweet nothings into their ear while you sip whatever kind of wine suits your fancy (there's a good selection). My favorite night cap spot in the Village. This fact may also be clouding my judgement as I don't believe I've ever entered this place completely sober before. But that's the BEST kind of night cap.",,1,

41,Justin J.,"Scholes, United Kingdom",0,3,0,1.0,11/9/2015,"Bartender needs a lesson in BASIC etiquette... At the very least, he's cost Vbar our custom.Some friends and I popped by the Vbar & Cafe for a few beers. On arrival, The bartender was not particularly welcoming, he did not smile or attempt to build a rapport with us. Nor was he a particularly great bartender, it took him three attempts to pour a good pint- he probably wasted a pint to pour a pint.At the time this did not bother me; the bar was comfortable and cosy and the crowed were pleasant and talkative. I was having a pleasant time, and his service had not added or subtracted from that.I paid the price given and rejoined my friends. I am not from the states so I'm not really on top of the tipping culture, but even if I had known I still would not have tipped- there was nothing special or above avarage about the way my order was executed. Again, not even a smile. About half an hour later the bar tender came to our table... He asked where I was from and I answered. He then proceeded to tell me how not tipping him was disrespectful and how I better remember to tip my waiter in future, and that I must never give the amount asked for. Not only was his outburst immature and disrespectful, it was unprofessional. Everyone at the table felt uncomfortable. We had planned to buy at least another two rounds- more than enough time to work on cracking a smile and building a rapport. However, after being chastised by the bar tender we decided to leave. No matter what the issue, where possible you should find a respectful way to raise it with your customers. Tip: a more appropriate question would have been to ask if I was happy with your service. Good service = a tip. It is not an entitlement.",13,2,3

There are boardgames hidden under the side shelf space fyi :DAfter like 10ish, there will be a huge crowd coming in. I guess thats what you call rush hour. THe place can get loud and annoying since you felt obligated to leave for that poor person waiting outside to get drunk like you are.

Ever.  If he was had a problem with my lack of a purchase, he should have addressed me directly.  Though this would also have been rude and insulting, especially to a potentially regular group of patrons, at least it would have been directed to the offender.  To add insult to injury, the coffee was awful (to be fair, it was fine on my first visit). It tasted as if it had been sitting for hours. No amount of sugar or cream made it palatable. I couldn't drink more than two sips.Needless to say, we will be finding a different meeting location from now on.  Hope the $2 was worth it, Vbar.",11,3,

58,Dilyn M.,"Golden, CO",0,1,0,2.0,4/2/2015,"Okay - truly the horrible bartender at this Vbar has inspired me to FINALLY create a Yelp account and give a review.Let me first say that I adore Vbar on 1st Ave and St. Marks. My favorite waitress in the whole world is there - the woman with the long dark braid who knows everything and remembers my group of friends every time we walk in. She's brutally honest and incredible at her job.Tonight I went to the Vbar on Sullivan street for the first time, as a pre-birthday get together with my friends. The space is adorable, I love the communal bar-table and the ambiance.The bartender who was working (late 20s? Shot dark hair, wearing a light blue t-shirt with a UK flag on it, pretentious brooklyn hipster entitled guy vibe) was immediately rude. I waited for my friend, who arrived about 5 minutes after I got there. He stood behind the bar and yelled, ""Hey - you gonna order anything?"" I smiled, apologized, and told him we were waiting for one more, and he rolled his eyes.I'm a young woman, and he treated me like a child when I went up to order the Lagunitas IPA. He said they were out and that they had Goose Island, followed with, ""Do you even know what an IPA is?"" Yes, thanks, I ordered an IPA, I know what I like, I know what an IPA is. Our friend who arrived late went to the bar to order, and came back shaken. The bartender gave her a cider (after belittling her for asking if they had a draught version) and she paid in exact change, $6, because that's what was in her pocket. As she was digging through her purse to find an extra dollar to tip, he snapped at her, ""You know bartenders don't make an hourly wage, right?""I've worked in the service industry for six years now, and am absolutely appalled that anyone would think it was appropriate to snap at a customer for not tipping. Especially when she was still standing at the bar, with her drink, clearly looking for something in her purse.He continued to be horrible for the remainder of the evening. He was clearly in a bad mood, did not want to deal with customers, and was resentful of every person in the bar. He took our glasses when they weren't empty and rolled his eyes when I asked for the check.Please don't employ bartenders who snap at customers and act entitled and rude. I'm not coming back to Vbar on Sullivan, even though I loved the vibe and the menu, because of this particularly terrible bartender. I'm sorry I tipped at all. 2 stars only because I like the place, but wow the service killed it. I've never felt less welcome in a bar.",9,,
59,Nathan W.,"Manhattan, NY",42,47,7,4.0,1/2/2014,"This place is one of my favorite wine bars in the village. I've never been in the daytime, but at night this place is one of those quaint neighborhood places that can belong in nowhere else but New York. The vibe at night is perfect for meeting up with people, since the noise level doesn't drown out your conversations. Although it's a small place, fitting at most maybe 20-25 people comfortably, it's never too long of a wait to snag a seat.The bartenders are friendly and always have spot-on wine recommendations -- plus, they play awesome music. There's a decent rotating draft beer selection, as well as a much wider bottled beer list. Wine-wise, there's guaranteed to be something that fits your mood, and they're all fairly reasonably priced. Most times when I go, it's no more than $10-12 a glass -- about average for the area. If you happen to go on an empty stomach, the prosciutto, cheese, and pear panini is delicious here. The only downside is that the kitchen closes relatively early, but they do allow outside food afterwards.",2,1,1

Saw Vbar and stopped in. This place is small, but intimate and everyone seems pretty familiar with each other. I ordered a few coffees to start. The guy behind the bar wasn't too keen on me using a 20 bill to pay for a few coffees that added up to only 3 bucks so instead of making him make change I bought a glass of wine. One led to another and before I knew it I was 4 wines deep. At first I thought the guy behind the bar was a bit smug, but the more I hung around I really started to give him props for his real vibe.

Here goes, my friend and I went there to work for a bit. My friend immediately ordered a coffee, but I (since I was in the middle of a very urgent call) couldn't. There was a guy sitting next to me with his computer working (just like any other customer) apparently he was the owner of the place (which he somehow expected that I would be able to guess). And when I didn't order right away he aggressively turned to me and told me that he found it very rude that I wasn't ordering anything. I explained to him my friend just ordered that I was in the middle of the call, but of course intended on ordering something after the call. He started becoming even more aggressive telling me he was insulted. I did get something eventually just so that my friend and I could pay by card (they don't accept below $10) and just leave. I went up to him after, to just explain to him that he CANNOT be that obnoxious with customers. I have been in the service industry before and I know that there are bad days, and that his cafe's policy is absolutely his decision, but his behaviour was absolutely way out of line. But he was condescending and went on to explain that in 'his country' (I live here, but originally from Asia), not ordering right away was rude.

So I went to the back which was still empty and found an empty chair by the bar. I took off my coat and was about to put it on the chair when two girls sitting in the middle of the room came over. One started to grab the chair i was about to put my coat on. I asked what was going on. She said that they wanted these two chairs because they were fleeing the noisy crowd. So i told her that I got here before her and was about to sit down. Then she said they had been hours here before me. I pointed out she was trying to swindle me, because they had been in the bar earlier but not at the spot I was. She said those people she was escaping from were annoying and since they were my friends -- she made that up -- i should join them. I don't care about chairs or stools. But her lying and swindling was simply an affront to anyone with a modicum of principle and self respect. So i curtly told her to fuck off.She started to complain to the bartender that used curse word. I told the bartender of her arrogant behavior which deserved the asshole appellation. Obviously he either knew them or was on their side. So he started chiding me for using curse words that one hears daily in NYC, even at work. I'm a big man. So I told him he had a point that my telling her to fuck off didn't help resolve the problem that she brought onto me, fully knowing he was being partial.So the girls were emboldened and tried again. I turned around and politely told them they were behaving presumptuously. Neither knew what the word meant. One seemed to be from the former eastern bloc. So I spelled the word to them. The bartender was watching and seemed really annoyed, for reasons still unclear to me. Maybe I made him inadequate. He started calling me asshole and asked me to ""get the fuck out of here."" I asked him why he used curse words when a minute before he faulted me (unfairly) for using them. He offered no answer and asked me to leave.I told that the bartender that it was his place (for the night one shall point out) and i wouldn't want to stay anyway and left. I couldn't help feeling contempt for the three.So you have a hypocritical bartender without principles and presumptuous, arrogant customers ready to bully other customers with impunity.

Paninis are rather simple and small for the price (around $7?), but aren't too bad.Unfortunately, I usually pack up and leave once the afterwork crowd trickles in, but I would definitely love to check the place out at night-- would probably make for a very cute date spot.",,1,1
89,AJ L.,"Williamsburg, NY",48,30,5,5.0,11/1/2014,The cosiest wine bar with the best music. The bartender is very cute and lovely too. I highly recommend. Good for date nights and causal reunions.,,,
90,Molly L.,"Surry Hills, Australia",26,207,0,5.0,10/3/2011,"Vbar is like the superhero of local establishments. By day, it's a typical neighborhood coffee house. By night, it's the perfect, cozy bar.I came to Vbar on a rainy Friday night. After dashing in from an unexpected downpour, my party of 3 sat down at the big table in the middle of the room. My friend said he takes all his first dates here. I can see why. With the low lighting and intimate atmosphere, it's a good place to chill out and converse with a potential significant other. The music is amazing. I'm told the bartenders get to pick the music. We had a great mix of alternative songs from the 80s and 90s. What really sets Vbar apart is that they have a good selection of craft beers AND a decent wine list. It's had to find a bar that offers a good selection of both wine and beer, but Vbar nails it.I highly recommend Vbar. By day, bring a book. By night, bring a date.",2,2,1

There's a panini, breakfast and dessert menu if you choose but I haven't tried them yet.Seating wise there's 7 bar stools at the bar, about 12-14 seats at a long high table and two smaller 2-3 person tables by the windows.

It took minutes for us to be helped even though it was nearly empty. The guy looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for more hot water for my tea. Upon paying the check, he realized that the person who served us had left and was incredibly rude and accusatory having assumed we lied about what we got.

My experience has primarily been the daytime scene, during which you'll feel out of place without a laptop. I've seriously been here a few times when the place is full to the brim with folks click clacking away in library-like silence. Those times, I get annoyed. Especially when I'm looking for a coffee shop to chat with a friend over a latte or to get cozy with a book. The high seats, cramped quarters and limited menu makes Vbar a bit uncomfortable to spend much time. And if you do decide to visit during the daylight hours, expect some eye rolling and angry bag-packing up if you want to have a conversation with a friend. The coffee is decent and the menu is brief, definitely a great place to get some work done.",8,4,3

It's one of the few places where the baristas really do make an effort to learn customers' names. The atmosphere is friendly, relaxed, and congenial. Oh, and they're totally down with laptops. They play music all day--generally classical or jazz/blues--which I love. At night, it morphs into an equally classy but relaxed wine bar--rare for the neighborhood.

The quaintly decorated environment can range from serene to light chatter-but never ever meets the hectic nature of a bustling Starbucks. People come to type away on their glow-boxes in peace, or  chat with friends in duos or trios. A long, asymmetrical table seats the majority of customers on stool-chairs.As for the edibles, their regular coffee has a clean taste and is more than affordable. The speck sandwich, however, is what keeps my stomach going back. A simple yet brilliant combination of speck meat, truffle oil and fontina cheese... Just thinking about it makes me salivate. The PB & Nutella sandwich also works for a sweet-fix.Finally, the ever-important customer service is great. With 1-2 consistent staff hands, they're always prompt, kind, and maintain the place wonderfully.Leave your desk, and get your work done here. A great atmosphere and tasty morsels can do wonders.",4,4,4

But if you're looking for a place to hang out either alone or with a few friends, this is a great place. I'm giving it four *s based on the wonderful atmosphere. I thought the latte was okay. The tomato and mozzarella panini was awful. The tomato was too old and bland. There was just no flavor to the sandwich. They used a rather strange bread for the panini (it tasted like Hawaiian bread). The sweetness of the bread and the blandness of the mozzarella and tomato just made for a strange combination.",,,

I also liked that it serves beer and wine, somewhat more like a european cafe. I only wish I could have ordered a Kaiser-Mélange.However, even though it added to V-Bar's uniqueness, I would prefer not to have the stools and bars seating throughout the place (which is very small, hence the need for that sort of seating). It isn't very comfortable. Furthermore, when I was looking for a cafe at which I could loiter and use the internet on Saturday night, I ended up circling this part of lower manhattan for two hours, unable to find such a combination. I had hope for V-Bar & Cafe as it seemed great for that earlier in the day. But, since it serves beer and is located in the heart of the village, that makes it a defacto bar on a weekend-night, and when I walked by after dark the people with laptops and books had been replaced with loud drunk people.

There were small groups of people enjoying themselves as well as the occasional person studying or reading. The baked goods looked delicious, and the fresh sandwiches smelled wonderful. We were in it for the beer, so my friends and I didn't actually get any food treats.V-bar was a great spot to relax, enjoy a good conversation, and sip some inexpensive beers.

Finally, he led me down a small street with minimal traffic and we entered V-Bar.It's extremely tiny. And quiet. And cozy. It was classy without being snobby, and exactly what we needed in the 3-degree weather. There's a bar with wine and beer. They have coffees. They also have food, like cheese and olives, and yummy soups.Their bathroom was clean, their wireless was free, there was a convenient power supply near where we sat.

151,r m.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,39,2,4.0,1/1/2009,"In the day, nice and mellow spot, with fresh coffee smells and good taste in classical music. Around dusk, it turns into a gothic werewolf and the music they start to play is just as awesome as people start drinkin up the wine. No, not gothic, what I mean is that it shape-shifts - that's what I like about this place (aside from the wonderful owner and his great taste in staff) - is that it's like 2 or 3 places in one, based on the position of the planet in relation to the sun.Pretty sleek yet cozy design, even elegant by night, yet totally down-to-earth and unpretentious by NY standards, and even has a de-pretensionizing effect on the few snobs who occasionally wander in unawares that this ain't that kind of place.I can't afford most of their exotic wines, so I ask for their ""house cab"" -it's only 5 bucks. It's a good glass for so little.During the day, it's a great place to work for two hours or so. Hard bar stools are actually comfortable. One drawback - at night sometimes it gets insanely loud as it gets jam-packed. The noise level tends to rise and fall significantly over the course of an hour. All it takes, because of the acoustics, is one obnoxious loudmouth to raise the noise level so that the rest of us have to yell. Other people don't seem to mind as much as I do. I get really damn mad and want to tell that one person  to shut up, or leave them some snotty note about ""negative versus positive freedom"" and the social good. But that's slightly my problem, not the VBar's.I should qualify, though, that if you're with friends, and not working into the wee hours as I often do, the noise level is actually ok. It makes sense that a gal with a lot of work would get distracted in such a place - the candlelit atmosphere at night is not meant to welcome in the workaholics. I guess it just says a lot that the bartenders make you feel comfortable with staying there alone to work your but off while a coupdl next to you launches their romance. It's rare that businesses tolerate such a mixed crowd.Anyway -- Guaranteed good work place in day, guaranteed good time with friends at night.",3,1,2

During the day, it's a cozy cafe--they have board games and a small library on one wall, and the decor is really comfortable. The space is small, but laid out nicely so that people can find a little nook to claim as their own. There's a narrow communal table snaking through, as well. At night, it becomes a fairly popular neighborhood bar, complete with a wine board, although they continue to serve pastries, cafe drinks, and snacks, making it a great place to go if you have non-drinkers in your group. The chai is delicious (they even made it soy at no extra cost), and the cherry danish was perfectly flaky and buttery. Bonus: free wifi!

I only wish they served whiskey instead of just wine and beer but that wouldn't make them a wine bar I guess. This spot feels like something you'd see San Francisco. I'd say this place is probably pretty romantic. The bartender was playing a good mix of music too not stickly granola rock or ambient stuff but a good mix of alternative loungey stuff something like Stereolab would go good w/this spot. My only complaint is that the wooden table in the back is too wide and people have to move in order for you to have to sit in the back, everyone get's interrupted because you have no choice but to climb out of this bar when it's time to go somewhere else.",1,,

I was able to make my 2 hour stay part of both worlds. I headed there around 5:30 on a Friday evening to work a bit on my portfolio before heading home to change for the night out. It was fairly crowded by the time I got there (I work in the area...) but I was able to find a tightly-squeezed seat at the communal table. I got a glass of their $7 wine and sat down to 'concept.' The wine, first off, was delicious, especially at $7/glass. The bartender was really friendly even though he was incredibly busy due to the fact (I later found out) that his buddy had overslept and was late to his shift. The atmosphere was nice, the ambiance dimmed down at about 6pm - literally. They turn down the lights and put tea candles out on tables. So at that point it was a little hard to see my book...but then again, I was pretty much the only one left doing work on a Friday evening at that point. It also gets a lot louder at night than during the day...expected. So I left shortly thereafter. I went back mid-day today and was pleasantly surprised to still have the great, friendly service from behind the counter and the same vibe throughout the cafe. The cup of joe I got was delish and even cheaper than my normal $2/cup! A lot of seats were filled but there were a couple open options. The turnover rate is also higher than at night, so a table is likely to open up sooner than later...Love the fact that the decor of V-bar is old library books on shelves, grandma's china cabinet filled with pint glasses and a million mirrors on the walls.

There is no such Brewed coffee in Europe.Sometimes I spent more money on coffee than food, which I can never get used to.

And for that he scored an extra tip, also for educating me on their gift certificate policy and Tila Tequila's brawl with her bf last month. They seem to have a lot of regulars there. I would definitely go back.",1,,
192,Casey R.,"Chicago, IL",129,54,13,5.0,7/29/2009,I went here with a couple of girlfriends for a chill Saturday night and must say that I was quite impressed by the laid back yet nice atmosphere I was faced with.  It's dark but nicely lit with candles.  Everyone there seemed to be in their late 20s-mid 30s and there was nothing obnoxious going on whatsoever.  I get tired of packed bars where you can barely even move on a Saturday night so it was a really nice change in pace!  I will definitely go back for another chill night!,1,,1
193,Arnab M.,"Los Angeles, CA",276,619,238,5.0,6/16/2007,"This bar (others like it in the neighborhood) makes me want to move downtown so badly. Tali A. and I stepped in here while waiting to the Sullivan Room to open, and to get some coffee, yes, at a bar. It was excellent coffee, and the bartender was sooo cute and sooo nice. It was really laid back and relaxing to sit here and talk and not feel rush and stuffy like one usually does in most NYC locations. They had a newspaper and magazine sections as well a bookshelf which was really cool. It's a really clean place too for a dive bar, i suppose, which is always a plus. I'll definitely be back here.",7,,7
194,Frank W.,"New York, NY",187,307,14,4.0,8/1/2008,"Nice.  Laid-back cafe meets bar,cafe bar even!  Good beer list, reasonably priced, the coffee stuff ya want + board games and a relaxed vibe.  Baked goods look a lil sad but to be fair I did not try.   Nice barkeep, books, and beer sold by the normal pint or half pint if you feel like just 1/2 more like I sometimes do.",5,1,4
195,Deanna S.,"Portland, OR",157,17,15,5.0,7/17/2008,"for the longest time, my only experience of vbar was in the evening... drinking a glass of wine in the dim and romantic lighting (depending on your company of course).  then one day i was walking by and realized it was open during the day!  i was surprised that it's actually one of those places that still looks really cute and cozy in the daylight.  i love to go in there when i'm in that mood to just sit by myself with my laptop and enjoy a great latte and granola bar.  there's always quite a few people sitting at the communal tables... and although they are usually alone and focused on their laptops... i've always had friendly responses when i have to interrupt them to get my computer charger into an outlet or to ask what the password is for the free wi-fi.  it's the perfect place for you to be alone, but with people.  i love that.",4,,3
196,Cesar R.,"New York, NY",39,92,19,3.0,1/18/2010,"The ambiance at V-bar is very cool. Go here for a good beer, to catch up with old friends, for a decent cup of coffee, for a late-night glass of wine, or for the free wifi. I've taken my friends here at the wee hours of the evening - it's a good place to wind down in the otherwise hectic Greenwich village. Seems like this cafe is often frequented by a bunch of locals and NYU law students. However, I've found it tough to find a seat during the day on my own, or during the evening with a few friends - it gets crowded very easily and is a major drawback, in my opinion. Regardless, good beer and good classical tunes.",,,
197,Christina F.,"New York, NY",99,706,2,3.0,1/12/2010,"nice atmosphere, though i was unimpressed with my ""speck"" panini. unpleasant taste, and looked like something right out of my ( albiet lovely) george foreman grill. :(though perhaps i should have guessed this place would be better just for a cup of coffee, glass of wine, or pint of beer... it is a bar, after all!",,,
198,Lamb J.,"Manhattan, NY",7,79,0,4.0,3/11/2009,"A nice place to sit and chat with friends -- though it's a bit small so we got creative with the seating arrangement. Friendly bartender and reasonable price for drinks (a tall pint was $6, though some can get pricey.) Bonus points for still serving tea/coffee late at night.",2,,1
199,Phyllis K.,"Austin, TX",257,230,4,4.0,3/2/2007,"Crazy crowded on the weekends, but in a good way.  Pretty good beer selection and great selection of whites.  Also a pretty decent cheese plate.  Only downside is that is you order a Guinness, they don't pour it properly.  I ended up with a 2-inch head on mine!",3,,2
