0,AB B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,48,4,5.0,4/7/2016,"I had the opportunity to check out this highly exclusive club when I attended a great event sponsored by Citi. The event was held in the Screen room on the main floor; open bar and appetizers were provided at no additional cost. After the event ended, I got a private tour of the club. It's tastefully decorated with modern art, it has with a large bar, restaurant, private dining area, a lovely dining patio, a spa, exercise room etc. The club offers impeccable service, privacy and exclusivity. The atmosphere was lively, it didn't feel like a stuffy club with old men. There was a mix of couples eating dinner, ladies enjoying drinks on the patio, business men chatting at the bar, college kids living up their elite life. While the membership cost of $65,000 greatly exceeds my entertainment budget, I would attend again if given the opportunity.",3,2,1
1,CJ S.,"Queens, NY",1,66,27,3.0,9/28/2017,"Located directly across the street from the Friars Club, blink and you can easily pass it. Overall, I found the Core Club to be more sizzle, and less substantive. I guess perhaps the great thinkers and business mogals were not present the evening I attended. It appeared more like the generic UES crowd, drawn to this milieu. The screening room is well done, and quite comfortable. There is a first rate photo exhibition adjacent to the room. On my next visit, I would like to see the library.",1,,
2,Elizabeth J.,"San Francisco, CA",599,658,789,4.0,4/7/2015,"Came here for an art event. Beautiful inside, looks like a normal mid-town spot on the outside. Various levels are filled will awesome pop art.  Really cool theater, nice for movie night / presentations. Very comfy chairs.  Bars/restaurant is beautiful. The apps we had were perfect bites --crab cakes, cheeses, some type of veggie dumpling.   The bartenders definitely know how to mix a cocktail.  I've been to a few members only clubs in the city and this one had a nice edge to it, felt very similar to the Ritz in how the staff greeted and treated all the guests.  Great experience.  If you are looking for a members only club this is definitely worth looking into.",8,,

4,Katie V.,"New York, NY",26,29,6,5.0,4/20/2016,"Was invited here by a friend. Very nice, classy, high end place. Food was delicious, but the portions were really small so make sure to order a few items. They also have movie room, library, bar, and many more. Overall I liked it! But personally I wouldn't pay thousands of dollars per year just to be a member",1,1,
5,Gloria F.,"New York, NY",109,323,60,5.0,5/5/2014,Core club is where the hitters go in midtown.  End of story.  Am I such a lucky person??? Nope but fortunately have a friend who is a member so have gone a couple times for lunch.  What can I say? The staff is beautiful and they know all their members by name. Don't even think about gate crashing bc they will stop you at the door. The restaurant has impeccable service. I must say portions are puny. Maybe that's how people stay beautiful??? If you are lucky enough to score an invite - it's a must go.,6,1,1
6,Armin T.,"Manhattan, NY",123,6,0,5.0,12/25/2016,Top club. Their mission is to encourage accomplished people from all walks of life to join.,2,,
7,Anna L.,"New York, NY",112,238,703,5.0,9/14/2016,"When I received my invitation to The Core Club, I was made to understand that the invitation was a special one. The design is intentionally subdued; so as to allow for the current zeitgeist be the light of conversation. You will meet well known people, recognized by the main stream. The event I attended had a celebrity quality to it; a bubbly, happy, warm, and friendly vibe. I hear the gym is great ... Might be fun to spin with Dr. Oz on one side, Dr. Phil on the other and then to see Oprah walk in. My first curiosity, naturally, will be in regards to their current gym shoes.",3,3,1
8,Victor W.,"San Francisco, CA",351,781,166,5.0,1/19/2013,Gorgeous private club that you would never notice if you didn't know it was there. It's a modern design filled with art and book. Food here is great though a tad pricey as expected in such a nice place. Service though is impeccable and they seem to know all their members by their first name.,4,,1

13,Kate H.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,28,2,4.0,7/30/2015,When you walk into the building its hard to believe it houses the Core Club. We enjoyed a three course dinner - the mozzarella was amazing! The flourless chocolate cake was also just the perfect size and delicious!,1,,
14,Adam Y.,"Miami Beach, FL",186,128,271,5.0,11/13/2012,"The only missing amenity is the trainers aren't doing your crunches for you. Considering I was allowed to indulge in all that is Core Club on a guest pass thanks to the generosity of family, the experience was even more special for not having to shall we say pony up. When I first arrived I meet the crew who sits at the front to great members and immediately the hospitality began to flow. I was given a guided tour of the club and introduced to the equally hospitable all male staff of Chris's who man the changing rooms, where were top notch. When I started to think, ""what else could they possibly have?"" I was escorted to the top floor where they have in house estheticians and..wait for it...in house plastic surgery, ok, this place is for sure a cut above the rest. The food is also excellent, I enjoyed a generous portion of the tuna tar tar on my last day, of three, to the club. It was delicious!!! One of the best I have ever had. Overall, Core Club, while different than the Breakers, Four Seasons and Soho House was a completely different experience one that takes the top of my list for a posh club environment. Remember after a power lunch, and a workout, relax and get a few emails sent out in the library upstairs or stop to look at the amazing artwork or coffee table books.",6,,
15,Niomi M.,"East Bronx, NY",54,51,7,5.0,3/1/2013,"I came here for a film screening a couple days ago, and was blown away by how accommodating everyone was! Front desk didn't grill me for hours (I've had that happen to me). Food and drinks were awesome too. There was swift service at the bar area, resulting in a couple trips there. I also had more sno caps, wine and popcorn than what was probably appropriate. Also, this is totally unrelated to anything, but the bathrooms were insanely nice. Usually the term ""public bathroom""sends a shiver down one's spine but here it was actually quite nice. Looking forward to more screenings!",3,1,

Updated review","Core Club - do not waste your time or money. It is not at all selective; if you can put $40,000. On your Amex your in but don't bother just look good and walk in the staff does not stop you particularly if you are women. It is a sleek well designed club but filled with 60 year old guys trying  to meet  young women. It doesn't have the cache of the old monied clubs aka Yale club but is not as hip as Soho house. Soho house is much more selective and not filled with suits.",3,4,2
19,Cynthia M.,"Manhattan, NY",353,1226,25,4.0,7/22/2014,"Luckily I was invited to attend a Chivas 18 event on the terrace at the Core Club. The building from the outside is your typical midtown building, but the inside is quite chic and the terrace is lovely (though only on the second floor). Service was quite friendly, attentive and helpful and the bathrooms are pretty (note, the door opens inward). Lovely event and I will definitely try to score more events here in the future.",1,,1
20,Megan C.,"New York, NY",3986,825,977,4.0,5/7/2007,"Private ClubJust when you were thinking that the Soho House was tough to get into... along came the core club.  With both space and luxury in mind time will only tell how long this members only place will last.Their art collection alone is enough to make a modernista drool.  Delicious eats, excellent place to entertain a small group or organize a mid sized affair.  Complete with screening room and spa services this location has it all. Love the fire place and the VERY friendly staff.  Date Rating: 6Pick up Scale: N/A (depends on what you are here for and what time of day but most people seem to be fairly private and come here to mind their own business)Strong suggestions: Have a cocktail, kick back, relax and enjoy the show.",13,2,5
21,Stefania L.,"Secaucus, NJ",8,20,0,5.0,6/21/2011,"THIS PLACE IS THE DEFINITION OF CLASS!Everything from the food, to the service, to the ambience is perfection in this place. Well worth the gazillion dollars to enjoy such a great membership. Unlike many other clubs, you are allowed to look at your phone here!! lol. Food is amaazing, had some sort of truffle mac and cheese creation which is to die for and also haad the roasted half chicken on Friday. Always pleasing!!!!",4,,1
22,Oleg J.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",430,131,31,5.0,5/23/2013,"I have only been as far as their screening room, but i have been there a bunch of times - this facility is great!! The staff and the manager are super friendly and professional. The seats are most cosy and all the AV are in place and working flawlessly. Perfects for private screening events and Q&As.",4,,1
23,James R.,"New York, NY",877,196,56,5.0,6/17/2009,"Been a member here since before it opened. Love the food, love the atmosphere.  More of a lunch place for me, though both breakfast and dinner are good, too.  No tie required, can look at my blackberry, etc. Unpretentious, uncluttered and the opposite of dusty.Outstanding staff; some of the most attentive in the City.",16,2,3
24,Vicki Y.,"Paris, France",168,171,78,5.0,6/3/2009,"Piggies are suckers for good service, and CORE: epitomizes good service at its finest, IPHO (that would be In Piggy's Humble Opinion, naturally!) (^(oo)^)vtwo mornings ago, a horrifically late, rather disheveled and somewhat flustered piggy presented herself in the CORE: reception area!  egads . . . . how embarassing, wouldn't you agree? (*(oo)*)did the friendly receptionist recoil in horror after giving the aforementioned piggy the manhattan onceover?  no, she did not.  instead, she gave an understanding smile and thoughtfully offered to take not only the piggy's umbrella, but also her jacket - brilliant!  she then directed the happily unencumbered piggy to the second floor.  there, an equally friendly hostess knew *exactly* who piggy was meeting for breakfast - amazing!throughout my visit, the service was ideal - calm, serene and excellent in that it all blended together to enhance the experience . . . . it's difficult to explain, but it's that magic balance between having someone or something appear at the moment just before the need arises vs. the type that interrupts the flow of things by intruding at the wrong time, if you get my meaning?piggy would like to request a CORE: in san francisco please!

25,Melanie Rose P.,"Boulder, CO",753,193,22,5.0,9/18/2008,"Well. Well, well, well.I have to start this by first telling everyone that I'm not a member, if that wasn't obvious enough. I do, however, have much interaction with the Core Club staff. Besides basic reservations/appointments, I've coordinated a handful of events for my boss (the member), and even been lucky enough to lunch in their dining room. The place is beautiful...if you're into that kind of thing...which I am. It's very art deco, modern, streamline, futuristic. From the moment you walk in (that is, if you can find the place, since it's unmarked) you realize this may not be what you'd expect from a midtown exclusive club (at least I didn't).The first floor has a screening room, where they premiere movies and is also suitable for business presentations (I've done this with great feedback). The lounge/bar/dining room is always my first choice to send my boss when he needs a quieter business atmosphere. They recently renovated the terrace (it looks beautiful), and on any given warm day during lunch, THAT is where all the members are. As for the food, it was tasty, but the things that stand out most in my mind are desserts. 3 words: Rhubarb Goatcheese Cake. Or is it Goat Cheesecake? Either way, it's 3 words and it was unreal. I don't even like goat cheese.I haven't gotten to experience any of what goes on, but I've seen the spa, salon, gym and relaxation rooms. This is when I start wishing I was rich enough to be a member. The gym is pretty sick. Small, but they have all kinds of state of the art equipment (I don't even know what these machines are called, but they're awesome!). The cardio stuff is planted in front of a mirrored wall with flat screen TVs built in. I'd probably want to go to the gym more often if I went to this one.The library is my favorite part of the Core Club. It's filled with art, books, art books, etc. It's a great place to relax or host a cocktail party. There's also a private conference room tucked away in the back corner of this floor. Basically, considering all of the amenities and the good experiences I've had with the staff, if I had the extra $XXXXXXXXX/year, I'd totally join.",7,6,8
26,AJ D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,4.0,2/29/2012,"This is where we got married, it's a nice club with a great staff. The food at the restaurant is amazing. The outdoor is perfect for drinks and lunch or dinner in the summer. They have a lot of screening, i have never attended but the media room really looks good and comfy. This is a club I recommend joining.",1,1,
27,Ron S.,"NY, NY",13,111,0,4.0,12/16/2007,"Great place located discreetly in the thick of Midtown. When you walk into the all-white lobby, you'd never expect what's inside, unless you catch a glimpse of some of the huge and beautiful artwork around the bend. I went here to meet my boss for lunch, and have got to say the place is pretty impressive. It has some great amenities, including screening room, excellent modern art collection, locker rooms and restaurant. The restaurant is laid out in a great way, curling around the main reception/bar area and opening up into a huge high-ceilinged area for you to enjoy your meal. The service is impeccable (it seemed like every member of the waitstaff new my boss' name) and the food very good. While I wouldn't confuse it with any of the numerous Michelin restaurants throughout the city, it's a great place to go to have a business lunch in a setting away from the normal din of Midtown where you can get some great service, great food and actually hear yourself think. Definitely recommend it - not sure what it costs to be a member, but I can safely say it's not a little bit of money.",6,,2
28,Morin O.,"Manhattan, NY",198,142,2,5.0,9/23/2011,"This place is incredible. Uber chic, it's like stepping into an oasis and escaping from the madness of the city. I recently went to an event there that was hosted on 4 floors of the location, what a fab time! The service is first class, ambiance is top notch and drinks are great!",,,
29,ryan b.,"New York, NY",21,37,2,5.0,5/6/2010,"Service is best in class, events are incredibly curated, and the membership is wonderful.  Steam, work out, get a massage and a haircut, have a meeting, enjoy a dinner party, see a film, listen to an amazing band--All in one club.",,4,2
30,David R.,"New York, NY",1,26,8,5.0,5/19/2008,"The Core Club is not for everyone, but for what it is, it is the best. Conceived of as an exclusive, private club for modern business moguls, it was a reaction against the stuffiness, rules and old-line social atmosphere of New York's more traditional clubs. At the Core Club, ties (and jackets) are optional, business papers and cell phones (even laptops) are welcome, and the membership is heavy on PE, VC and hedge fund denizens. (Note that it is not open to the public.)The service, as has been noted by others, is beyond superb. Members are recognized by name even before their fingerprint is scanned at the door, and everything is automatically charged to one's account without having to see a bill or sign anything (yeah, if you have to ask...)While the screening room is gorgeous, the food superb, and the gym state of the art, perhaps the least known fact is that the club's spa is THE best in New York, and rivals the world's greatest destination spas. And, oh yes, in the summer the club takes over a giant mansion in the Hamptons and has invitation only performances by big name stars.While all the money involved in and around the club is rather obscene, that is really the only negative. The staff is wonderfully attentive and nice, the members are all of a type so there's no snobbery, and the services are absolutely the best in the city. If you're ever invited there for lunch or an event, by all means check it out.",12,,3
