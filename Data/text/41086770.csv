1,Laura C.,"New Hyde Park, NY",753,759,1634,3.0,10/12/2018,"Came here for a private event, which was hosted on the second floor. Prior to the event starting, I ordered a hummus wrap at the bar. It was a bit disappointing and felt a bit... empty? Anyway, I shrugged it off, a hummus wrap at a sports bar was probably a poor choice on my end, but I needed something light and reasonably healthy after noshing on fried food all weekend.As mentioned, the party was on the second floor, which was fine. It's not the greatest layout, there's a side area where a good chunk of us were and it feels so cut off from the rest of the party. When the night started winding down and people had left, we made our way over to the main area, the part with the bar, to engage in our festivities. The bar staff was always nice and attentive.",3,2,2

Naturally vivid indigo colored by botanicals - butterfly pea blossom!!    Fantastic and fun service by Kathryn aka grown up Merida from BraveCute clean establishment with patriotic flare and a wide selection of bar favorites & comfort food. Didn't have a chance to fully review menu or try healthy options but enjoyed what we had and look forward to coming back! Cheers!,1,,
3,Ricky Z.,"New York, NY",202,103,20,4.0,10/25/2018,"Wings were above average for NYC in my opinion. Great deal at $10 for 20 using Yelp too! Picked the wrong night to go as the were having a wing eating event, and announcer of the event was obnoxious. However, once the event ended it was a pleasant place. Wouldnt probably come besides during HH, but it does HH well!",,,
4,Gatangalie S.,"Queens, New York, NY",429,286,2949,4.0,1/1/2018,"Stitch Bar hosted the largest New Year's Eve singles party in 2017. I totally had a blast here ringing in 2018 with hundreds of total single strangers. Great bar with excellent taste in music. Seriously the music was jamming ridiculously non stop - cheers to an awesome DJ that night.There are two floors in Stitch. I gather the top floor is more for table services and that cozy VIP services. However, there is a mini bar as well and one can have a nice view of what's happening on the main floor. I personally fancy the main floor simply cause you have an option to sit at the bar, stand or grab regular seats in the back.Stitch is perfect for partying it up on a late night especially Friday night into the weekend. I like how the location is convenient to the public train station and not to mention a ton of cabs desperately waiting outside.Considering New Year's  Eve was super busy, I noticed folks didn't wait that long for a drink. In fact I was trying to order a glass of champagne and one of the managers actually took my order. Totally appreciated that.I'm looking forward to go back to Stitch again in the future and take advantage of their must have wings!",5,2,4
5,Steffanie B.,"New York, NY",260,353,80,2.0,8/27/2018,Pretty average in terms of service and bar food.  I did enjoy the sangria nevertheless. Plenty of seating.  Restroom was decent enough.,1,,1

Happy hour lasts until 7pm and they have a $5 draft beer and food specials. I got 20 wings for $12 - yum! They let you choose multiple sauces and I got buffalo and teriyaki - both good.The waitresses were nice. My only complaint is our first waitress was hard to find before happy hour ended. And at the end of the night they gave us a bill with automatic gratuity even though we were only a party of 3.,1,,
7,Gerard P.,"Staten Island, NY",276,372,5,4.0,10/4/2018,"Great Midtown bar, albeit a little difficult to find. The main selling point is its wonderful atmosphere, which incorporates the fact that it's located within the Garment District. It's also incredibly spacious, and not overpacked like the typical Midtown bar. Well worth visiting if you're in town, or even if you're a native.",,,

And all of the servers were very courteous and helpful.Although it was super packed on the second floor there was still enough space to move around, get food, mingle, get drinks, etc.I'd definitely come back here for another event because the service was great, as well as the food and drinks.",3,1,2
10,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",517,988,6100,3.0,3/27/2017,"Finding new places to get drinks is always challenging specially when it comes to certain areas this happens to be one of those areas. I recently came across this place as it was suggested by a friend. We were seated at the table by the window, drinks I had a Bacardi & Diet Coke pretty good my friend had a Jack & diet good as well. First time around we got an order of the Curly fries very good fries nice tasting & crispy. Next time we had the Calamari, not bad good dipping sauce Calamari could be better as was a bit over fried.As for the place it's pretty big two floors seating & private party area upstairs. Big space, good size bar with table & bar seating, Typical bar decor. So far service has been good waitresses are nice & friendly.

11,Kenya M.,"Rockville, MD",60,177,584,4.0,3/2/2017,"I have to be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this bar & restaurant. It took me a while to figure out what to eat. I decided to get the grilled chicken quesadillas. They were delicious! Really! The chicken was tender and the cheese, probably pepper jack, had a little spicy kick to it. Really good. That's all I had so that's all I can comment on :)",3,1,
12,Paul L.,"Lancaster, PA",3,51,20,1.0,1/15/2018,"I went to Stitch for a quick bite to eat. The food was okay but what surprised me was the welcome or rather no welcome I received upon entering. There was a gentleman sitting at the host area,eating and drinking and hanging out with a friend. It appeared as if he was perhaps a customer sitting in that area. I wandered around try to discern if I was supposed to see him or just take a seat and I finally decided that he was just a patron eating there and that there was no host on duty since he totally ignored me and and since I didn't want to disturb a patron eating and having a good time with his friend I just found a seat on my own. This person was there the whole time I was dining. After about 45 minutes and I had finished eating and paid the bill, this gentleman walks by and demands that I put my feet down off the chair next to me. Which was empty since I was the only one at the table. Now my feet were not on the chair but I had my legs supported on the chair since I had been walking all day at a trade show. ( I was sitting right next to him the whole time I was there in this exact position) I didn't immediately respond because I was not sure I had heard correctly, (I was so amazed) so he stops and glares at me till I responded to his command. I was soon ready to leave and as I left I asked the gentleman if he worked there. He had just gotten another dish of food and was sitting down eating again. He assured me that he did. He said his name was Dave. When I mentioned that I would leave a review of my experience there his reply was ""knock yourself out"".....as he went back to eating. So will I go back or recommend that you do.....probably not.",2,3,
13,Arlene R.,"Rahway, NJ",297,239,138,3.0,11/24/2017,"My fiance and I stopped here while heading back to Penn Station after a brief visit to NYC. This was not the place I had intended to stop and eat, I actually thought it was a different place. Oh well. Sat down at the bar area and a waitress stops by to ask for a drink order. She says it's currently ""happy hour"" and gave us some drink specials of which one was a Moscow Mule. Ok, sold 2 mules. After what seemed an eternity she comes back with two glasses. Um, where are the copper mugs?  And they were the weakest mules ever. Had 2 and could easily have balanced on one foot on a medicine ball which is on top of a see saw balanced on a marble....I ordered the gator bites because I wasn't too hungry. Fiancé ordered a pulled pork sandwich. Food comes out pretty quickly and my gator bites were actually better than I expected. Not tough at all and the sauce they served with it was not too bad. But again had to wait forever for the waitress to come by to ask if we wanted a second round of drinks. Overall was not impressed with the beverages and the service. I'm rather disappointed I didn't make it the the place I had wanted to go to in the first place.",3,3,3

19,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,85,26,4.0,6/5/2017,Came here for happy hour and it was good. The specials were great between food and the drinks and they were delicious.

One of the best Happy hours in the midtown area and this is a place I would definitely come back to visit,,,
20,Patra C.,"Queens, NY",80,234,349,2.0,10/23/2016,"Was at a bar nearby,  but it was too packed and tables were full so we decided to check this place out. Saw the rating on yelp and was hesitant. However, seeing that this place was spacious and relatively empty (especially for after work), we walked in anyway. Found ourselves seats towards the back area.  We ordered wings (already part of the HH deal so no need to show the check in), curly fries and nachos. We asked our waitress if they can put beef on the side instead of smothering it on the chips, but she said they don't do special requests. After ordering, we put a menu to the side in hopes of ordering more, but she asked us to give all of them to her since she wanted ""to protect them from getting dirty"". Within less than 5 mins of her taking all the menus from us, a lady next to us completely spilted drinks on the menus on their table.Food wise, it was average at best. Drinks were run of the mill bar drinks, nothing special. The place is really hot, felt like sitting in a sauna.",1,,

It's a huge area with a long bar, and tables with waitress service on the sides by the wall. I especially loved the ambiance. It's dark and modern and classy, which makes it ideal for work hangs and dates, and it's not too loud. Hanging by the bar with colleagues, I got a glass of white wine to share with someone. I wish I got some food, because it looked pretty great. I'll definitely be back!",6,1,2

Updated review","Came back here for lunch and had the wing special. It was 20 wings for $10. I havent had good wings in a while. I was happy to get outside for lunch and was looking forward to it. It was a small lunch between a coworker and I. We ended up splitting the wings he had 10 hot and i had the 10 mild. Just the right amount of wings for each since we bothhad a small bfast. Definitely hit the spot. I recommend the place for its wings and happy hour prices. The ambiance is great, place is clean and neat. I'd come back again :)",4,,
23,Marna H.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",192,380,189,4.0,5/16/2016,Not my favorite beers but a very friendly bartender. Very big bar! I had no idea is that big from the street. It would be great to bring a big group of people here,2,,
24,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,3.0,12/27/2015,"Went here for an after party following a holiday party. It was pretty packed by the time we got there, but we managed to snag 2/3 of a table and overspill into some of the seats at the bar. Apologies to the two ladies who were the 1/3 of the table, I'm sure we seemed obnoxious to you. Although really, who goes to a crowded bar at 10pm on a Friday night for a quiet dinner? Anyway.The server was friendly and adept at handling orders from a large group of people who kept circulating. I only ordered mixed drinks, which were pretty standard and hard to mess up. The place looks really popular with the after-work crowd and people on their way to and from Penn Station. Not a bad place to hang out if you happen to be in the area (which honestly, I wouldn't be if not for this party).",3,,
25,Amette N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,10,5.0,4/3/2018,4/3/18: love this place! first time. Happy hour goes till 7pm with lots of drinks to choose from. Reasonable prices.

Trains near by which is a even bigger plus!,,,
26,Steven G.,"New York, NY",111,57,4,3.0,3/3/2017,"This review is based only from my lunch time experiences here, I have not yet been here at night. But I have been told that at night the bar gets very crowded and rowdy.I come here during lunch hours often, they have a pretty awesome happy hour. $5 select beer of the day, $10 for 20 wings, $7 wines. You really can't go wrong! During lunch, it's usually not so packed. The bar can sometimes be completely filled, but there are tables if you're trying to dine in. The favorite has to be the service. There is a bartender named Tiffany, and she is quick and very professional every single time I'm there.For lunch, I think it's one of the better spots in Midtown. The wings are to die for, you have to try them!",,,

31,Katie V.,"Buffalo, NY",101,110,173,1.0,5/12/2015,"I hesitate to be overly critical of a place, in case my experience was atypical, but I wouldn't even risk trying this joint. I didn't eat here; I met a friend for drinks in mid-January. However, the quality of the food could never compensate for the disgraceful quality of the customer service. First, I requested a sea breeze with Absolut citron, and I explained that it is Citron vodka with equal parts cranberry and grapefruit juice. I was presented with a virgin cocktail, and was polite in asking for a corrected one. The waitress returned with what appeared to be straight Citron vodka diluted into a glass of water. Whatever it was, it was not what I ordered. Not even close. This is a drink that most experienced bartenders should know how to make, or at least have the presence of mind to reference if they don't. And restaurants in this part of town should only be hiring experienced bartenders.Finally, I decided to make everyone's life easier and order a cocktail off of the menu. I finished the cocktail, and my waitress, who seemed overwhelmed by the whopping 4 tables she was servicing, copped a major attitude with me when I politely asked for another drink. She threw her hand in the air, and with an exasperated sigh and roll of her eyes, she said ""well, what are you drinking?""I flagged down another waitress and requested the manager, who evidently was not present or otherwise unavailable at the time. There should always be some form of authority available to listen to formal complaints. Always. At the least, someone could have given me the manager's contact info. This waitress happened to be very sweet and sympathized with my frustration, but she stated an inability to help due to being new.I've worked in kitchens, have a thorough knowledge of cocktails, and have been a server in a diverse array of environments. I'm pretty understanding when it comes to mistakes, slow service, and an overwhelmed server. However, nothing excuses an inability to concoct a sea breeze with Citron, or my server's attitude. I sure hope that nice, new server was a positive influence on the rest of the staff with her professional conduct, or found a better place of employment.",7,1,

Updated review","I work in midtown. And as far as places to drink there is no shortage of selections. Stitch is by far my favorite. It's close to the PA. (Two blocks)The service is quick. And most importantly the bartenders are really friendly and cool people. Anna  is the best bartender I have ever met! I adore her! And both Anna and Lena are extremely knowledgeable in their drink creation. I have never had to order a refill and the attentiveness is hands down the best that I have received. If i can recommend one place to grab a drink after work, or in the evening, this would be the place. The people are great and the place is spacious. Food wise, I have never ordered anything that wasn't good. Double clap for Stitch.",,,

Updated review","Me and a friend came here yesterday unexpectedly around 6PM because I called her to say we needed to meet up.  In other words I needed a drinking buddy.  She told me she wouldn't be drinking much when I called her. We each had the beer of the day.  After a while one server came to check on us to see if we wanted anything.  We were ok but contemplating the Buffalo wings. Within ten minutes another server asked if we wanted anything and by that time we had decided on Buffalo wings. We were asked if we wanted mild, medium or hot. We chose medium. We were going to order 10 but there was some special on 20 so we got that.At one point my friend ordered an Appletini.  It was served in a martini style glass without the stem.The wings were served with blue cheese and celery but no carrots which I found unusual.  They were definitely spicy but not over the top blow your head off spicy.  While we were eating I wanted another beer. I asked for a Corona but they didn't serve that. They had something similar called Sol. I said fine.  That was served.  Indeed it was similar in taste.We couldn't finish all the wings so they gave us a to go container and took the untouched blue cheese dressing.  When the check came I think were both surprisingly shocked at the total.  I paid the bill and asked for change once the tip was included.All in all I think 3 people served us since were sitting at on of the tables by the wall because the bar was full.",2,1,

My friends ordered water to start with. The blonde bartender essentially kicked them out of their seats because they had not yet ordered an alcoholic drink. Then she proceeded to say how this was her livelihood and basically if they wanted to pay $6 for water they could stay. This is NOT customer service.

If you're going before an event, order food early, as it will be a bit of a wait!They have a nice upstairs lounge area that's a nice place to hold a private party. They'll put out larger quantities of ""catered"" food. Seating is ample with chairs, couches, etc, and they have a small bathroom up there so you don't have to go back downstairs.

She ignored half of our requests, gave wrong drinks, and gave us our bill while we were still eating because her shift was ending. As a business owner myself, this was absolutely horrible service. You don't give a customer their bill and to make them pay while they are still eating. Also, I paid 15 dollars for a burnt burger when I asked for medium well.

About a mile into walking to our spot (trains still weren't working) we realized uhhh power outage=no electricity=no credit cards. Crap. Well since we were already almost there we went just to make sure they in fact weren't able to accept credit, and sure enough no luck. We then had to walk all the way uptown again and by this time we just wanted to eat, and someplace cheap and with drinks and didn't care where. That's when we found Stitch. The prices looked acceptable, had happy hour drinks, and wasn't overcrowded. Sold. We were seated right away. Drinks were good. Ordered the sampler platter which was awesome and saw someone elses Nachos and we ended up getting those too.

Our bartender waited on us quickly and she was very cordial. Drinks are reasonably priced and mixed fairly strong. All in all, this was a great find. For a while...However, right around 12:10... The twenty-somethings arrived. One came running through the door literally SCREAMING at the top of her very shrill lungs. She was screaming and running to such an extent that we almost expected to see a guy wearing a hockey mask and carrying a chainsaw right on her heels. She continued to scream every couple of minutes. It was very reminiscent of those old video clips of the young girls at a Beatles concert. And they kept arriving. It was full of them in about 10 minutes. Then the bartender didn't even bother to come over for a re-fill, despite that we all had already bought two each and tipped nicely. They were all busy at the other end of the bar. Oh well. We left.

99,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",230,582,505,4.0,9/18/2012,"I love Stitch. I first discovered it on a Friday night a few years ago, while driving across the city during rush hour to get to my parents' house in New Jersey. I was sitting in my car, pouting about the Lincoln Tunnel traffic, and looked out the window to see a bunch of people having fun in the bar, Stitch. I wished I was sitting in the bar, relaxing, having a cocktail, instead of strategically blocking a Pennsylvania-plater from cutting me in the line.So I finally went to Stitch for their happy hour, and had a great time every time. Their wings are delicious, and if you get there early (before 5:30/6pm), you can easily get a seat in this spacious bar. But let's be clear: Stitch is a Happy Hour bar for the Garment District/Lower Midtown West work crowd. It's close to Penn Station, not an Irish pub or an annoying touristy dump, and so it gets crowded and sometimes unmanageable. This is the same problem with places like Blind Tiger... fun bar and setting, but too popular for its own good.My latest experience with Stitch was extra special though, and one of the reasons I'm so fond of the place. I had a daytime wedding in the city that ended at 5pm, and needed a place where all of our out-of-town friends and family could gather and unwind together. It had to be on the grid (easy for directions), it had to serve food, it had to be casual, and it had to be close to the family's hotel near Bryant Park. Stitch fit all the criteria. I worked with their event person, and he was so accommodating and easy to work with (which is much appreciated as a bride coordinating everything else). I gave him an approximate number of people and a food order ahead of time, and Stitch had the back area of tables reserved for us. The waitresses were aware of everything, and asked when we wanted the food to come out. There was no confusion, plenty of space, and my wedding guests all had a great time.",2,,1

We sat at a high top table toward the back but there were also booths available. The picture on their website of the large area with booths and cushy chairs is upstairs, I think for private parties. But we were comfortable nonetheless. The service was fantastic! Very friendly waitstaff, very attentive and fast. Every time I ordered a drink, it came in seconds. We got the spinach and artichoke dip, chicken tenders, and nachos. It was all very tasty. I especially liked the dip. The inside was clean and rustic-looking. The ambience was friendly and comfortable, a little loud but that's ok. The clientele looked like a young professional crowd since we were there at happy hour and this is a popular after-work jaunt. I enjoyed my visit and I hope I can go back again!",2,,

Also, the food, prices and the bartender! - all impressive.The place has high ceilings so you don't get the stuffy feeling of most bars, and there is a great selection of beer.Definitely would return, definitely would check out their sister (brother?) bar, Houndstooth.",2,1,1

One of the staff, who was happy to tell us his name was Keith, was rude and unnecessarily abrasive after my friend tried to confirm why they were closing early and just stating that their website had posted a different time for close of business. I still can't believe that that happened in a bar between a customer and an employee! His yelling at the top of his voice, his mocking disrespectful tone and gestures, his laughing in our faces, his Fist pounding, his approach to one of my friends as to literally start a fist fight after my friend said ""don't talk to my wife like that"". This was utterly ridiculous and unacceptable. This man was clearly drunk on the job and the other employees sat there smoking cigarettes IN THE BAR!? Is this not illegal in New York State?? What an awful place. If this man's name isn't Keith, he was apprx 6' 2"" dark skinned African American male and the cigarette smoking bartender was a foreign (maybe Ukrainian) slim woman.

The bartender was going through menopause and was pissy from the start throwing money back at my friends when giving change. Then she claimed to give my friend his credit card back when we were all arguing he never got it. Turns out she gave it to some other random dude at the other end of the bar. Not only would she not admit she was wrong she kept arguing we got the card back. Aren't u suppose to sign before getting your card back?Yo lady I know we are all Asian and look alike to you but get your eyes checked that doesn't mean we are the same person.

The Bartender, JJ, was friendly and efficient.All I ordered was water but he was very attentive about refilling it when it was close to empty . He muddled the crap out of oranges and cherries for some sort of pineapple punch concoction that he made a second time when a patron wasn't happy with the first one, which is a nice gesture. Not to mention he had a great smile that he never was without- even when the girls next to me were being Cuntous Maximus for no reason. For food, I got the caprese salad. No meat or anything. Just great quality ingredients; and that is all you need for success! The mozzarella was quite notable and the tomatoes were nice and firm. I added a little EVOO and Balsamic just for taste. I highly recommend it for lighter fare- really hit the spot! I am moving to this area soon, and will DEFINITELY come back.

But I guess it is a bar, so I'm not sure I expect much differently.My favorite thing about Stitch is the cocktails. Pricing is similar to other bars in NYC (ie not cheap). I'm a big fan of the Raspberry Beret and Candy Apple Stripe. They're super girly, sweet and delicious!Food is pretty good too. Out of everything, the fries are my favorite, which we order pretty much every time we visit. Sliders are pretty good as well, the meat is juicy and not overcooked. I prefer the upstairs area, it's much better for groups since there are bigger tables up there and it has its own less-crowded bar.

She didn't want to switch out the drinks but after much hesitation she finally did.  I should mention that she even tried charging us extra for her incorrect drinks!!!  The food was nasty. It's usually on point but for whatever reason it sucked! The  guacamole was sour and tasteless!! To add insult to injury the bartender brought us the wrong appetizers. When we tried several times to get her attention to change them out she was a total witch about it. She said it was our fault for not telling her sooner and refused to correct the order or even comp the bill when this was obviously her mistake. To make a long story short, after much fighting I ended up having to pay for it...and I was really upset about the whole matter. So when I asked to speak to the manager regarding her rude behavior I'm told he's not there and won't be in until the next day. She wouldn't even give his name!! I asked several workers that day what was the name of the manager and if he was around but all gave me the same response. When I called for the manager the next day...of course he was no where to be found...and never called me back to discuss what happened!!! So rude!!! But the kicker to this story was that these jerks charged my debit card 2xs with 2 different prices. I called my bank and it was all resolved through them...but never again!

Updated review","I have a personal vendetta with this bar that I will not go into here, but even beyond my own revenge fantasies, I had to knock this place down a a star. The last few times I've been here (even after SWEARING I would never return) have been not so great.I mean, when you're pretty much the only game in this part of town, you start to get cocky. Then you start pouring weak drinks and charging more for them, and then your bartenders start giving attitude (come on ladies, you work at a bar near Penn Station, get over yourselves), and then you become overcrowded with douchebags.Sadly, it's still the best option 'round these parts, but I think they need to step up their game big time if they want to keep people coming back.",9,6,7

Come to stitch!- $7 drink specials?- Bouncer that hides in the corner and fetches you out for ID- Dirty glasses that taint an otherwise decent beer selection- Non-local baseball gamesThe only thing, after multiple visits, that this place may have going for it is its ample space and loft area great for big parties or a large gathering, and a decent DJ spinning everything from Malcolm McLaren to your 80s and 90s favs.The taps are clean and the bottle selection quite expansive, but be wary of the bottom of the glass where things tend to go foul.  Not only are you nearing the end of your beer, but you're getting closer to the area that the dishwasher consistently misses.A miss in my book. Sorry Stich, you had so much potential.",6,7,5

155,Ben O.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,11,1,3.0,8/3/2009,"We were here Saturday night for a friend of a friend's birthday party. The vibe here is awesome - Dark, dim lighting, lots of dark wood and leather, uber-long bars and comfortable seating. There's an upstairs too, probably usually reserved for parties, with it's own slightly smaller bar and a small dance area. The drinks were a bit on the hefty (read: expensive) side (but hey, it's NYC) and the music was slightly above comfort level for having anything but scattered bits of shouted conversation. The bartenders are slightly....what's the word...wooden, but vaguely polite.All in all, we had a pretty good time here. I'll definitely make a point to come back here because of the cool chilled-out vibe - Maybe we'll try for a weeknight when the music's turned down just a bit. We'll be back.",1,1,1

I was waiting for my date, so I was by myself at the bar, and I began talking to the gentleman next to me. Him covered in tattoos and long hair and piercings, and me, high heels and a v-neck, started talking about a recent UFC event he had attended in Vegas with his wife who is a make-up artist, specializing in zombie-esque make-up. I was enthralled.  I am now a loyal fan of UFC.Seriously, the fact that this place could attract such contrasting groups of people says a lot. I hate going to bars or restaurants, only to find that everyone looks as if they've been literally cut from the same mold. Stitch has a good beer selection. The inside reminds me of the Ginger Man, without the unbearable crowds.  I work in the area, so it's nice and convenient in the desert of cheesy joints that is Times Square.",3,,3

Music definitely could have been louder because they played some good stuff, but not many people were dancing. Except for my friend Becky dancing alone in an 80's glamour outfit.

The drinks ARE over priced and VERY weak and the bartenders think they're working at some really hip and trendy spot...which this place is far from it. The good thing about the bar is it's spacious and it wasn't too crowded when I went there for a happy hour, but I know why. The food was average and the crowd was mixed...tourists, college kids (since school's out) and office people.  There was also a live band that night that was average (they played cover songs). I would not recommend this place to anyone. If you decide to go, be prepared to spend a lot on drinks and don't even expect to receive any buy backs from the bartenders.",2,1,1

I bought a drink and was sitting at the bar by myself, when my friends came he Came up to me soo Obnoxiously to tell me that it was  a private party and I must have lied to him to get it in. Firstly , come off your high horse. If you were doing your job correctly and were at the door to tell people it was a private party I would have never come in, the drinks weren't free there was nothing I had to gain from being at a miserable corporate event with unattractive people taking up a quarter of the bar. Secondly don't come up to me and accuse me right away of lying to you when I never saw your face.  I had to leave my full drink at the bar and leave.

OK that last bit was a lie)However, Stitch neither made nor broke the occasion. Well, they could have given us a bit more room, and the drink ticket bit was just silly, but the food was fine and the drinks were fine. I guess given that it's the garment district and slim pickings for good spots to hang out, this place is fine. I doubt I'd go out of my way to end up here.

And that was only the guys. It was hard for me to notice what the girls were like -- I mean, it's not the first thing I look at ;-)The atmosphere was nice -- it had a second level that you can rent out for special parties. It was, however, loud. They turned up the music so high, you couldn't hold a conversation. They didn't seem to understand that this isn't a dance club.

I was there on a Wednesday night with a group of friends - Lena our server was good - but when I asked for a pen to a server named Maria it was like I insulted her! She didn't answer to me so I asked again and SHE YELLED AT ME BECAUSE I WAS INTERRUPTING HER CONVERSATION WITH A CO WORKER. I was shocked, but my friend stood out for me and told her to calm down, it was even worse. MARIA YELLED BACK AT MY FRIEND AND USE THE F WORD MANY MANY TIMES saying that she wasn't our f***ing server. I thought maybe she was off the clock and had a bad day... but no... she was working. I've been on her side many times, but never in my life have treated a customer like that.. I would just get fired! I sincerely felt bad for Lena and her other co workers...
