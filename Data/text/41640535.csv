Starbucks: familiarity, long line, lack-of-seating, impatient workers, general aura of unrest, limited, over-priced food options, burnt-tasting coffee ($2.12)Balducci's: no line, pleasant service, spacious counters that are perfect for people-watching, excellent (hazelnut) coffee (2.06), surprisingly good sushi Skip the stress of Starbucks and hit up Balducci's for a soothing cafe experience.",2

Staff seem happy and are friendly. Place is bright, clean, and has window bar seating with maybe ten stools, I had no problem getting a seat at 1:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. Coffee is lacking by that time of day, it seems, as I sampled two kinds and neither were hot. Note there are no ceramic cups so if you won't drink espresso from paper this isn't your place.",

You pick your base and then you can add as many toppings as you like. Proteins like chicken and turkey cost extra but you can get a very affordable, large salad at this gourmet deli. Their sandwiches are good but they feel expensive for what they are. There's decent coffee here too but I really only go here when I want a salad. Very few seats along the window but most people get their food to go.",

To me & my husband they were just meh. It's a beautiful place, clean, lots of pre-packaged options and a coffee bar. I was really excited to try it. Great presentation of the food. Perhaps if I had gotten a salad or the coffee I would've liked it and given a better rating, but my husband and I were not impressed by the sandwiches at all. After having Pret A Manger, I was expecting that level of quality and taste. The tuna tasted very fishy and the sandwich was more bread than anything. Same for my husband's chicken sandwich. He said it lacked flavor and was mostly bread. I'll just stick to Pret when I'm back in town.",2

I highly suggest this cafe if you need a quick but healthy lunch. There is also a nice seating area if you can stop and take the time to eat. I like that they don't do a million extra charges for toppings on your salad. All in all great experience.,

Although their pesto tortellini does look sinfully decadent...but until I try it, I'm sticking to 3 stars.+ Selection: So I hate to describe this place as a ""bougie deli"" (I'm lying, I don't really hate my description), but it's a ""bougie deli"". You know how some businesses add the word ""gourmet"" to anything so that they can justify ripping people off? Nope, not Balducci's! To be honest, their edible delights are gourmet and they DO use top of the line ingredients, but my problem is that I'm just NEVER a fan of pre-made food. If I'm paying for overpriced food, then I want it custom made, fresh and made just for me. + Bakery: Everything in their bakery section looks freakishly good. Their macaroons ARE delicious, but alas they're not up to Ladurée standards in the least. They still are the best macaroons I've ever had and yep, I've munched away at the original Paris location. I've also purchased a slice of their cheesecake for a friend who loves, loves, LOVES her cheesecake and whole she ""liked"" this one I could tell she was being nice. I kindly reminded her that I didn't make it and wasn't going to be offended (and even had I made it, feedback is good! lol) and she confided that Starbucks makes a better cheesecake...that would've saved me like $3-4, hah!This isn't an awful place to hit up if you want a fancypants lunch, made skillfully and with fantastic ingredients, if you don't mind the pre-made food thing - or if you want to get a quick snack...but I usually do prefer other things in the neighborhood...like Bread & Honey cuz yanno...they'll make me a sandwich or wrap to my specifications, charge me $4 less than Balducci's and Boar's Head meat is a-okay with me :].",2

I wish I worked closer then I could try all the really tasty-looking sandwiches and sushi but alas I've only had the salad. Gotta say, at 9.49 it is quite a value, as long as you don't mind skipping on the meat proteins. You get unlimited THATS RIGHT UNLIMITED premium quality toppings for that price. I don't know many salad places that do that. And this includes cheese! And quinoa, which is usually extra in most places. And edamame, also extra usually.  And their omg mouth watering candied pecans. Ingredients are fresh and don't taste canned. Value. It's a seriously delicious, gigantic salad. Yum!Plus the place is really clean and neat and very pleasant and generally not a mob house. Only downside is the salad container is made of carton which is flimsy but I suppose more eco-friendly.

I know, a lot of money for a salad... if you usually like your salad minimal.I get it all - grapes, peppers, corn, tomatoes, nuts, cranberries, cheese, etc. I always get the chicken salad on top. The works! They put it in a huge bowl and mix it up and it tastes so good you don't even need any dressing! It also provides me with enough food for two meals, so you could say you are buying two salads for $6, which isn't bad!I've looked over their other food options and it's just too expensive per pound for me to touch it... plus, I really love the salad.This store is really small so they don't have much else in terms of selection. They do have a mini bakery section though up front with lots of scrumptious looking goodies. I have only sampled a mini pumpkin pie in the past that was pretty good.The customer service is fine, quick check out every time I've been there. You can sit at the bar facing the street and people watch while you eat or browse your laptop. I've always been able to pick up wifi but I don't remember if it belonged to balducci's or not.TIP: Parking is abysmal around here! Come on a Sunday!",1

It's NYC, isn't it the city that never sleeps? Yes it is, everyone is up and they want into this place. I could understand if they were located downtown, but this is on the west end of midtown, or as some would call it midtown west, while others say there's no such 'hood. In any event, whatever you call it this area is teaming with locals and tourists alike way past 8 p.m. Tasty lattes, awesome crepes, salads and sandwiches. I will admit you'll find their prices very NYC even if their hours our not. So why am I such a fan, the stuff is good and the selection is good. A few people can go here at the same time and find something they want to eat.There's also a nice selection of packaged items to take home, or back to your hotel for a late night nosh.Pretty please stay open later, trust me your registers will be ringing.",2

It is always fresh but I have to say that they don't understand anything about customer service. Here are some of my customer service experiences;They close early during the weekend and several months ago I entered the store 10 minutes before the closing hours. I was shout by the store manager ""We are closed"" while there were still customers in and unlocked front door and at least 10 more mins. I know he is the manager because I found a piece of wood in my salad once. When I went to return it, he helped me and instead of apologizing he kept blaming the farmers not packaging the salad with attention. When you try to get tea, croissant, or anything from the counter, they never looked at your face and they just chat with each other. I go there at least 4 times in a week for last 2,5 years and maybe 2 or 3 times I receive ok customer service. Their uniforms are always dirty.

I have been working at my new job for a little over 3 months now and have had Balduccis for lunch almost every single day since i've started. The food is pretty good if you know what yo get though. The sandwiches are mediocre at best. There are much better sandwich shops around Columbus Circle that are cheaper and taste better. The salad though is where its at; a bit pricey for a lunch place but its Hell's Kitchen so what would you expect. Unlike many other salad shops you get as many add ons as you want at one flat rate instead of charging you per ingredient. So if you like adding a lot to your salad this is the way to go. I think by the end of it i have about 8-9 things in there(Candided Pecans are awesome.) The soups are great too as long as you get the right one. The clam chowder is pretty lame, tons of potatoes and not enough clams. The turkey chili which i like is pretty lame as well; they have too many beans in there and the turkey is minced so tiny. If you are looking for a bowl of hearty chili this is not the place to get it(Mr. Business Owner if you are reading this please change your recipe.) All the other random stuff inside is pretty good too.Service there is great, most of the time, I wish i knew the name of these 3 African American woman so i could give them a shout out. They work there most days. They are so friendly and we joke around while i'm figuring out what i'm getting.

McDonald's is just across the street and happy meals are around $7, so perhaps that's where one could dine if so inclined.  I personally find Balduccis to be the best salad, sushi, sandwiches, and coffee in the Midtown West neighborhood and the generous window seating looking out onto the 8th Ave passerby traffic is a treat all its own.",2

However, its the pastries that attract most customers.The tea selection is lacking and the coffee is just a notch above Starbucks, but overall it is a decent breakfast or lunch spot.Beware: It can become impossible to sit at the laptop bar during lunch and they do not deliver (you must brave the snow for a Balducci's lunch during the winter).",

The ingredients are fresh and delicious, especially the feta cheese and pecans I always throw in. The lime chipotle vinaigrette is light, tasty, and doesn't drown out the flavors of the other ingredients. It's a bit pricey, but they give you a LOT of food.

My typical salad order: Spinach, onions, cherry tomatoes, goat cheese, chickpeas, fennel, avocado, cashews (sometimes), croutons, cucumbers. It's gourmet, it's good, and it's only like a dollar more than the other salad places in the area, which definitely don't offer a lot of these ingredients. The only downside is it gets super crowded. Either go before 12:30 (advantage: croutons haven't run out!) or after 1:30 (if you don't care about croutons or are a weird carb-avoider) for the shortest wait time.The sandwiches are all right, but are a little pricey, and quite honestly, I prefer the sammies at Pax. And I haven't tried any of the other stuff, although I do feel they're taking up a lot of space with their gourmet goodies displays--$8 for a container of cookies?
