Our bartender was so super cool...enjoyable to talk with and knew how to make a good drink! He was able to give us good dinner recommendations (we decided on Eataly) we made friends with other folks at the bar (all about our age..which was nice).once we were wrapping up...we headed to the roof to finish our drink and just check it out up there...glad we did.I would absolutely return to this place...later that evening we told our local friends that we came here and they also told us its their favorite bar in that particular neighborhood.,4,3,5

One plus was there was no cover!We had to push our way through the crowd of obnoxious under aged students screaming about their friends throwing up. When we finally got to the rooftop, there were no views or heaters. The beer was good. That is all.",,,

It looks like their cocktails change from time to time. I had a drink called the purple punch and it was tasty. However, I asked the bartender to make me something pink and he made a drink that they used to serve, Becky's Lemonade (which he told me he called Patty's Lemonade). That one was amazing! It's great for people who like drinks that are fruity but still somewhat strong. The bartender took a lot of care in each drink that he made, and they all looked beautiful. The only downside is that the drinks are slightly pricey (around $13 for a cocktail) although that is typical for this area.",5,1,3

Not only is this untrue, but it is also illegal. However, I didn't want to ruin the amicable mood of a fun night out, so I said it is fine and paid for a bottle.Meh. I've (definitely) experienced better.",1,,
5,Caroline Y.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",92,66,17,4.0,7/21/2018,"This bar is pretty fun! The place is three stories high, with a cool rooftop bar on the top level. However, there is only a bar on the first and second levels, so you have to go downstairs to get a drink. There is plenty of seating on all three levels, and fun dance music on the first floor, if that's what you're looking for. The place is pretty much occupied by young guys who work in investment banking, and the place is a little bit of a sausage fest - so ladies, lots of men here!! The security guards are good at their jobs, while still being nice, and the bartenders are quick and very nice. Have been here a few times and will definitely go back!Edit: Lee is THE BEST BOUNCER I HAVE EVER MET. Bars are so often full of flirty guys that think they can do whatever they want to the girls there. Lee really takes his customers into consideration! No seriously, a guy inappropriately grabbed me, so I let Lee know and Lee was on watch for this guy. He noticed the guy do this to several other girls, and low and behold, he was soon removed from the bar. I am happy to support a place where I feel safe!!",3,2,1

Was thrown out and manager using foul language all because she got sick In bathroom. Was not drunk just wasn't feeling well. Maybe could have been the food. Been going there a few years and no reason to treat these adults in such a manner. Out of the 20 people there there were a group of 15.  Would never go back as my time and money would go to a better establishment and there are plenty others to choose in NYC.  Why would I want to go and give business to such rude people.

We followed them up to a rooftop bar which was really nice but very crowded haha and loud, so we went downstairs, was very spacious but kind of dark (which was good to watch the game though haha). The drinks were good but tiny so I wouldn't say it was really worth the price haha, but it was good to just sip on to watch the game. After the game, the music was pretty decent, I might just come back for more (pretty decent crowd that was around the bar just chilling)-we'll see !",1,1,1

The beers are well-varied and priced decent enough and the cocktails were strong. The atmosphere is low-lit and cozy, which fit the vibe for the storm perfectly.

Seconds later two women took stools to sit at the bar and he didn't approach them about it. When I approached him about being more polite he told me ""I can throw you out.""I come almost every weekend and must have spent over a thousand dollars here.

I ordered a $10 well rum and coke that was 95% coke. A person I was with also had this same issue with their drink so it was not an isolated incident. We then got a round of shots that were also $10 each. But at least they weren't watered down! The interior is quite nice with 3 different levels and I wanted so bad to like this place. Oh and they also have security guards walking around shining flashlights everywhere. The whole time I was just very put off by the vibe.Don't go because the drinks are watery, don't go because the security guards are obvi power hungry, and don't go because they try to be classy and they aren't.

No one on the staff would answer any of our questions, and we were looking for him everywhere inside. My friends who are locals were so disgusted by the staff's behavior and won't be back again.

Chicken fingers were over fried and was rather hard to chew, fries were okay except it was a bit soggy. Just thinking they maybe have been ill prepared for a 2pm game (in terms of food).

This is a winter review though.Stop by Brass Monkey after a disappointing experience at another place. I needed a beer. I needed food. We go in and are immediately seated. Staff is friendly and attentive. We talk towards the back and are provided a pleasant walk through the nearly all wood decor. This place really gives you the beer hall feel. You'll notice that patrons come from all sorts of places. You've got couples, groups of guys, groups of girls, and small families all in one place. A football game plays in the background behind the bar and tons of Christmas tree balls hang from the ceiling.We order a couple of beers and some food. I order a BLT. Everything comes swiftly. The reason we left the other place is because the food NEVER came. Brass Monkey is putting a priority on making sure you're fed. Staff came by and checked on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed and to make sure we were happy. Maybe cause they wanted the table? I don't know, but they were great and I appreciated it. The amount of food we got was great and I'd have taken home half of my BLT if I wasn't such a fat slob =)Brass Monkey seems like a great place to go chill if you wanna see a game, if you wanna relax with some friends, or if you just need a quick bite to eat.",1,,2

Rooftop was really pleasant and casual, but it's a lower building so not much of a view. Was annoying that they wouldn't serve us tap water alongside our drinks. If you wanted tap water you had to go downstairs (can only buy bottled when you're on the rooftop). Beer selection also felt pretty limited, which was sad as I feel like a tasty local craft beer would really have completed the casual rooftop scene for me! Guess it's probably more catering to the post work crowd who are just going for straightforward basics. We ended up ordering the rose cider which was tasty.",2,,

We all got here at around 12am and the place was PACKED to the point where it felt like you couldn't breathe. Too many elbows being shoved around and people pushing one another. They kept letting too many people in especially after 12. The vibe in this place was off the whole night and the crowd just wasn't good.. Lot of people getting really fucked up to the point where they collapse. They were also letting in a lot of underage people and too many frat dudes. Some people in the crowd were just REALLY rude for no reason as if they want to pick a fight with you. There were also some really creepy dudes standing in the corners and eyeing down girls. The drinks were very watered down to the point where it felt like I was literally drinking water. The DJ played hits of mostly hip hop and pop music but the entire area was like a dance floor.

OVER WATER!! Apparently he did not like the way we asked for water. Which was- hey, could we have some more water please? He started yelling and shouting at us, saying we were d**** and would not serve us because we were rude?!? For asking for water?!? He ended up yelling at a bouncer to come throw us out. That bouncer seemed to be the only decent member of their staff that night. Not only did he listen to us and go get his manager because hey we just paid $$ for drinks we did not drink. He was also the only person there who apologized. Hear that brass monkey? That's how customer service works. When you treat people like crap, at least have the decency to apologize to them and not say ""perception can be skewed"" and ""our bar is very busy and sometimes things happen"". Your bar was not busy.There was no one else waiting to be served at the barIf you had a problem serving four BROWN people who walked in on a Saturday night, you shouldn't have let us in in the first place. SIMPLE. And the bartender, what ticked you off? The fact that we were being responsible?

She was immediately defensive and absolutely nasty. Most notably, she lacked proper customer service and management skills. I am unsure if this is her natural attitude or due to a lack of training.

What started as a fun night was quickly ruined by the service on the rooftop. One of the waiters dropped 3 beers on to the table and walked away. Not knowing who ordered them, they were each claimed and we moved on. A few minutes later a woman (who I assume to be the manager) tried to rip one of the drinks of of my friend's hand. She said that we did not pay for the drinks and could not have them. We pointed out that her waitstaff dropped them off to us and didn't ask for a card or tab. She did not care and proceeded to take the drink out of my friend's hand AGAIN. When we said that they had already started drinking them she said ""I don't care, I'll pour them out"" so instead of allowing patrons to drink your alcohol you're going to throw that money down the drain??? We ended up giving her our bar tab just so she would leave us alone. Next, another friend ordered a Corona and had to wait 45 MINUTES before finally giving up and just asking for her card back instead of the drink. The waitress cursed her out ( ""can you fucking wait"" ) and turned away from her. Insisting that she just wanted to close her tab and NOT ordered another drink, my friend was again cursed at and disrespected by the waitstaff. Finally, when trying to close tabs at the end of the night, it was like pulling teeth. The waitstaff couldn't be bothered and had no sense of urgency in assisting customers. My friends and I generally love going to the Brass Monkey but after being treated like this I'm not sure we'll return. It's a fun bar but they need figure it out on the rooftop before summer really begins. Maybe open up the bar up there so customers don't have to wait around for your incompetent staff.",4,4,

To say the least she was extremely rude and loud while I never lost my composure and complied with her every request. She went on to demand in a very inappropriate manner for us to leave, threw my beer away, and did not even let me close my tab. I was willing to pay at least for my friends beer since he drank it. This is ignorance 101 and what she did is actually considered harassment by law. We left 2 seconds later. Will never go back there and honestly neither should you unless you want the worst customer service around the meatpacking district (which has also been my neighborhood for more than 2 years and I'm wellversed regarding venues around here).Brass Monkey owners do not know how to take care of their clientele.

The music is also pretty calming. It's definitely a place worth checking out if you're in the area!,,,1

WHY!?!?The taste of the juice was so bad I was left speechless.  To screw up one of life's greatest inventions to save a few cents on pickle juice ... an unforgivable sin.Bouncers who overstep, a velvet rope and line outside for no reason, horrendous loud music... I can deal with those.  Ruin a pickleback ... there are no words.This ... was not the cream of the crop nor rose to the top.  I'm sad.",,2,
48,Stephanie M.,"Leonia, NJ",155,252,204,3.0,5/22/2017,"Stopped in the Brass Monkey with a couple friends last week. We were looking for a nice rooftop to watch the sunset from but didn't find it at Brass Monkey. Though the outdoor patio area is a nice place to sit and have a drink, it's very low height-wise and the one side of the patio with a view of the water doesn't have seats. We had to ask special permission from the bouncer to stand there and snap a couple photos. We ordered some cocktails which were pretty basic. Not horrible but I have extremely high standards. Size was pretty good, came in a big mason jar with a handle. Would have been better off just having a beer here for the quality of the drinks.Didn't try any food. I would definitely come back on a nice afternoon/evening to have a cold beer and enjoy the patio and some food.",1,,1

54,Chantal A.,"Miami, FL",801,1,0,1.0,8/10/2017,"tl;dr racist, sexist, underrated bar. Go anywhere else Giving this restaurant a full star felt generous. I have never been so disrespected in my life. I was harshly told, after attempting to order a second drink, that I was no longer going to receive service. There was already a tab open and I patiently waited for my drink from the bartender. He heard my order, acknowledged me with a faint smile and proceeded to make drinks for his white, male customers. I hate to pull the race card, but when you're the only black woman in a male dominated bar, things tend to seem targeted. I am a very blunt person, so as soon as my bartender walked by, I made an aggressive comment about how rude it was that he served three people before me. He responded to my comment by saying, ""I don't have to serve you."" Of course I was shocked, because I am a paying customer who pointed out an observation. I sat at the bar and waited another minute or so, very clearly annoyed and he walked by again and said, ""I will not be serving you.""I pulled myself together and went back to a table of friends and explained the scenario. They calmed me down and told me to just order a drink from the other bartender. I walked to the other side of the bar and of course, I am told that I am ""cut off."" I asked why and she really had no answer, so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager claims she was told I had too much to drink. As we stood there, having a coherent conversation, in the middle of the day on Thursday, she still claimed there was nothing that could be done. Cheers to having a crappy location in the city and even crappier service! You guys have outdone yourself! P.S. Great for underage teens who don't want to be carded cause they didn't care about that either!",10,2,

When there was music we were actually enjoying, it was promptly changed back to the most depressing music ever.   Music has a big effect on your atomsphere.  With that being said, the ""new playlist/horrible music enthusiast, has killed this place.   Your clientele looks bored and your staff looks miserable.   Not a place I or anyone wants to stay too long.Seriously, what happened to this place?  Has it gone through a management/owner change?  I can totally see why no one comes here anymore!

For an after work drink or prelude to other festivities, however, the Brass Monkey delivers a solid mix of pleasant service, potent potable and eats. Beer is the main attraction here but I've never actually ordered one nor felt like a lager. Instead, the short list of cocktails has always piqued my interest. After three blueberry bourbon smashes, you may not have the hand eye coordination left to smash anything.The food menu is typical for this type of bar, with bar snacks in the salty and fried family. Speaking of fried, the french fries have always done a fine job of increasing my thirst, while the flatbread pizzas are certainly a step above Mama Celeste's. Finally, for a small dose of protein, be sure to have a look at the slide selection.The first floor is a mix of bar stools, communal tables and smaller communal tables. On a quieter day there shouldn't be any difficulty claiming a spot for your licentious liquor lust.Large TV's above the bar remind us of the importance of sport in the modern world.

We told her and she goes ""well you already ate it"" and walks off. We were in shock. We called to speak to the manager, and she was even worse. My friends who was very angry at this point told the manager that her attitude was basically telling us to ""fuck off"" even though she got us the wrong order. The manager stopped him right there and lost her plot that he is abusing her or some nonsense. She walked off, came back and in the worst way possible told us that the fries are now off your tab. My boyfriend then went to talk to her in private, very very nicely, so she doesn't feel cornered. Here comes the worst part, she cornered him with a couple of bouncers and said ""you and your friends need to finish your drink and get out of here"".  Needless to say we left in the next five minutes.

The second floor was more of the party floor with current popular music. The first floor was the biggest and had more throwbacks. The drinks were good and I enjoyed my pumpkin beer.

We chose to just stay on the first floor because of this. Also, there is no actual bar on the roof so that's just silly.This bar seemed like a nice respite from the rest of Meatpacking. my family and I really enjoyed ourselves.

Here comes the best response ever, ""Don't talk to me in Spanish you Latino motherfucker."" I. Was. Amazed. I did not react to it but just grabbed my drink and walked away.In the end, I went on to close my tab and called in for the bill. And for obvious reasons, I did not want to tip this guy. As soon as he saw me write $0.00 for the tip, he called the bouncers who grabbed me by the neck and threw me out of the bar lolol.My card was left behind at the bar, my coat was at the coat check and I was taken out violently and made to wait at the door on a freezing night. It was only after my friends got out who got my coat and my card back.The staff is immensely rude and racist. Latino or not a Latino, I would not recommend this bar to anyone.

Each time we've come the folks we met have been really chill and awesome to chat with. Bouncers and bartenders are great as well. They're so far from pretentious given the area. I mean yeah the place isn't fancy pants like the rooftops and clubs in the area so they're more lenient about dress codes and etc. I always pay in cash because the bars do get awfully crowded and I don't want to deal with that if I had a tab and wanted to close it.

When 5:30 came around, they told us we had to leave because there was a Google party and our seats were reserved (would've liked to know this when we first sat down!). If that wasn't annoying enough, I left a ring in the female restroom when washing my hands. It was really important to me. By the time I realized, it was 2 hours later and I was on my way out of the city. I called numerous times and no one would answer. I ended up filling out a form online and that was the only response I received. Sad to say, the clientele of the bar (or someone at the corporate party) ended up taking the ring with them! Sad day.

All of the tables were filled so we just stood around having drinks and talking which was fine. After an hour or so we went upstairs to the middle floor but it was so hot and crowded we moved up to the rooftop. I know a lot of people say the rooftop is too small but I actually enjoy it. The only annoying thing is that you have to catch a waitress to get you a drink or get your drink from the downstairs bar then come back up being that there isn't a bar on the rooftop itself. While on the rooftop I started getting hungry and saw on the menu downstairs earlier that they have macaroni and cheese so I wanted to order it but the waitress said they don't have it on the roof? Thought that was a little strange but ended up getting mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers. The chicken fingers were good but the mozzarella sticks could be better.

However, I was there 2 weekends ago and was disappointed greatly. The night started out decent, with having to wait outside at 1am for 30 minutes to get into the establishment. I decided to open a tab at the bar since I figured there was a minimum. This went fine. But when I ordered the second drink, they claimed to not have my card and told ME that I ""did not order a drink down here since it's just us 2 bartending,"" and scoffed at me as if I was an imbecile. They asked for my license and supposedly found it. However, I ordered 3 drinks after this one and this same exact ordeal happened each time. Claimed to not have my card, then asked for ID and eventually made my drink.The next day I realized that I didn't have my card and must have not closed the tab.I called Brass Monkey 5 times and got no response even though it was during open hours.I then emailed the office email and was told that any credit cards would be in their safe and mine was not found, and if it was there more than a few days it would be 'destroyed.'This was complete BS, because I never signed the tab or closed it out, yet my card was charged $56 at 2am that night. They had to have had my card to close out a tab. I am a bartender and know that you have to swipe the card to authorize the final bill...I put a block on my card and a couple days later went to my bank to get a new card. Only to realize that... the charge from Brass Monkey was changed from $56 to $90!!!!!!Bartenders went back into the system days after and changed the charge on my card.I am disgusted by this behaviour and will never go back to Brass Monkey.How can you change the charges on someone's card who never personally closed it out in the first place?

Hated the tray my sandwich was on because it was way too small and I felt like I was making a mess. Overall, this place was okay, I just expected more because I had heard so much about it.

The furniture looked like it was hand made with bits and pieces of metal and wood.  There were cool Edison string lights, potted plants, a sweet view of the Hudson and just a very casual vibe.  We had a round up there ($7+ for draught beers) and then went down to the first floor and snagged a booth for round two.  The food looked and smelled enticing but all we ate was an order of fries that the 4 of us pretty much happily murdered quickly.  (think 5 guys, salty, brown, crispy)The staff was sweet and efficient.  The ladies rooms were nice in an old timey sort of way (cool tiles, cute stall doors).  I would definitely check it out again.",4,2,3

There was some dancing upstairs but the music was really loud and it was hard to even get up to the bar to order drinks. The bartenders were a little abrupt but understandable given it was 11pm on a Friday night. I'm sure this place is great in the daytime and once the rooftop is open.

She sent security for us and we were escorted to our own private space with a server for only us. We had food and enjoyed a couple of beers when we were done we asked for the check but the sever informed us that it was all taken care of.She managed to turn around an experience that could have prevented us from coming back to one that made us loyal costumers .That being said this is HOW the hospitality service should be handle.

Meat packing is Meat Packing- Obnoxious Long Island and ESPECIALLY Jersey d-bags all trying to flash their Black American Express cards (we appreciate your business by the way lolol) to the bouncers promising 1k bottles for the privilege of being ushered into the front door.This time was different. Yes I had to wait online in 9 inch heels (my own fault bu they make my legs look awesome) to get in, then wait online to get upstairs. The bartender was so nice and never gave me the normal ""ewww why are you ordering a club soda and not alcohol"" look and was super fast with my order. The rooftop is actually super nice and my friends had a table for the night. The server was great and soo nice with us. The music was low enough were we could hear it but didnt have to scream at each other to converse. Plus because of my friend's foresight getting a table we got to sit the whole night and enjoy the night. Such a nice set up upstairs. Now best time to leave is about 2:30am or 3am, the kids start getting frisky in the corners and staff has to start flashing powerful light at them to quell the hormones. Plus its easier for your uber to find you if 100s of drunk people are not trying to hop into yours.

The experience started off poorly with the 2 bouncers at the door who had an attitude from the start. They were more interested in the young, scantily clad women trying to get in than anything else. They barked at us about our bottle of water that was nearly empty and would not let us in until we ditched it, though they didn't have a trash can. We should have walked away then. Inside, we decided to sit at the bar, which was completely deserted vs. going up to the roof deck. Unfortunately, the drunkards from the roof deck started coming down to order more drinks - not sure why given that there had to be waitstaff up there. More people had come to the bar area and it was about 1/2 full. The roof deck crews showed a blatant disregard for the fact that people were sitting at the bar and leaned through sitting groups of patrons to order more booze. The bartenders did absolutely nothing to get them to move to an area of the bar that was open, and continued to serve them though they were well past a reasonable amount of alcohol.

136,Kenneth C.,"Manhattan, NY",8,23,23,5.0,5/8/2016,"Let's have a look at the Brass Monkey!                          Firstly, I expected to see a higher rating than 3 stars! When I see 3 stars average I get very annoyed! Realize that NYC is becoming a corporate shopping mall and if you continue to push out the creative independant business people with your whiny 'yelps' you will be sitting an TGI Fridays come next year and it will be deserved.    Showing that someone found a great space, had a good idea and the idea took off!  Down to earth, approachable owner who cares about her people and the customers' experience. The personality of the Brass Monkey is multi sided and changes according to the time and day. Also as in life, it is what you make of it.    How anyone can give the Brass Monkey a negative review is ridiculous. Some say that they return many times but give it 3 stars? 3 stars means not so good. It insults the owner and people working there. I'm betting that most ""Yelpies"" live with their moms or at least subsidized by them because they have no clue what it takes to make your own way here in the city. . I mean running a business. What would constitute 5 stars? When you walk in, the red carpet and everyone bows to you?  Nothing positive to say?    The place is totally awesome? maybe...but more like very good 5 star good.  When you see an owner of a business go out of their way to make a nice space such as planting flowers for the roof garden, adding touches of eye candy and personalization to the atmosphere....dont try to knock the wind out of their sails because you didnt get laid or went out during the most absolute busiest times and expected fast seating, your favorite drink waiting on the bar and a 20 minute conversation with the waiter. This place has the practice and organization to handle crowds and does so pretty well. Try respectful tipping...Throw the bartender at least a $20....that helps!  I love outdoor spaces so keep that in mind...When there I walk right through the Brass Monkey to the roofdeck....    I recommend this place as one of the best spots in Manhattan. Period.   The area is great. No midtown buzz with frowning suits and times square tourists. You can find parking, go in the club, meet a beautiful buzzed girl, take her out for a walk in the park right across the street,  bring her out to the water, the full moon, whisper closely into her ear and let her know you are 100% into her.......location, location, location.  Try coming here in the early afternoon on any weekday and enjoy a cool outdoor space. Yes nightlife is good but there are other things. People say the Brass Monkey is crowded, loud etc. but stop in on a regular day early on, for a late brunchtime snack and enjoy a nice quiet, unrushed sitdown on a rooftop cafe with a great view of the river and NJ across the river. This place has plenty of opportunities to enjoy for many tastes. You can have a relaxing quiet lunch on the roof (instead of sitting in the park and being harassed by Mr. ""What...t's a public space"" for a dollar) You can have an informal or even formal meeting with potential clients, your office mates or whatever....again, on the roofdeck dining area.                       You can go out to the Monkey and mix it up with the crowds, prowling for some little hottie...and meet the girl of your dreams....  Do whatever it is you like to do at a bar or club. Choose between different rooms and scenariosEat food.   Manhattan Rooftop Garden Dining:    The rooftop garden, with nice trees, evergreens and a very very cool ""vertical garden"" that has a chic and in style reclaimed wood wall with small flower planters used to separate the dining areas from the utility/staging rooms. The wood they used possibly reclaimed from the same building when they renovated. Clever and effective use of design and repurposed everything, even the planters for the trees. The roofdeck feels personalized and comfortable.       At Brass monkey they see a use for things, repurposed more in the Brooklyn outdoor space tradition of simplicity and bang for the buck  Using old industrial tubs for planters, likely left behind in the building by the previous occupants. The motorcycle:   Id really like to get my hands on that BSA (a classic british motorcycle) that is just taking space out front....I can fix it and have it running...really... I got it like that. Food: It is fine. I have had food truck stuff that was great for cheap and then very expensive food that sucked...So The Brass Monkey has decent food. The food here is fine, price is ok too.  I would add some images but dont see the option.    Thanks for reading.",6,6,6

Came here on a Saturday in the middle of the day during the post-brunch day drinking rush and watched the bouncer turn away girl after girl for being too drunk or dress inappropriately, and let every single guy in. You are a bar. With a roof. In Meatpacking. There are going to be LOTS of drunk people coming to your establishment to spend their hard earned money on your overpriced drinks. After all, Brass Monkey, don't you pride yourself on having scantily clad, drunk girls in your establishment in the first place? (not so) luckily, I was let in. When I asked the bartender if they had a specific type of beer on draft, he rudely told me to ""look for myself"" and scoffed at me. I was scoffed at. By the bartender at Brass Monkey.

The bouncer asked if I had a picture of my passport, trying to help us out. I did and reached for my phone to present it, when an incredibly rude lady, presuming some sort of manager, interrupted and told the bouncer it had to be the physical document in a horrible tone, without so much as look in our direction to speak to us or explain, which we would have understood.

As far as regular bars go, this place is very mediocre...I came here on a Friday evening, around 8 before it gets too crowded. The lower levels were pretty empty, but I guess since the weather was really nice, the outdoor patio was pretty crowded. We were wandering around trying to find an empty spot and a server pretty quickly found us to take our order. She told us that she'd bring us our drinks, but we had to stay put. Ehh, we were hoping to wander a bit. It seemed like they were pretty busy, so it took some time before our drinks came out. We managed to snag a table in the corner, where it was less crowded, and ordered some fries and sliders. The sliders were pretty bare bones. Nothing really to rave about. One thing that's really odd is that while they should have a lovely view of the Hudson, they've instead blocked it off with potted plants. Additionally, it looks like they have a bouncer to keep people away from the edges. A few people asked if they could take a picture in the one spot that wasn't blocked off by the potted plants (it's a nice view when it's not obscured by the trees) and the bouncer said ""one at a time"". Seems like a waste to block such a view!",2,1,

A few friends and I went here last Friday night to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. We were drinking and dancing on the second floor. At some point, some random guy bumped into my boyfriend, causing him to drop his drink. My friend and I went to the bar to politely inform the bartender that there was a broken glass on the dance floor. We asked if a janitor or someone in maintenance could possibly help clean that up. We were literally only looking out for the everyone at the bar; we didn't want anyone to get hurt by the glass. The bartender (blonde, manbun), for no reason whatsoever, responded incredibly disrespectfully. He mocked us by repeating everything we said in a belittling, condescending tone (""oh your friend's drink dropped? oh there's glass on the floor? tell me more?""). I responded saying ""you don't need to be so rude"", and he continued to mock me, saying things like ""i can't hear you, it's loud in here"". Unless you were there to see his facial expressions, his body language, his tone of voice and his VERY intentional mockery, it would be difficult to understand the level of disrespect we were shown. I can't fully translate onto plain text how pathetic this man's behavior was.I asked for the manager, who was honestly no better. She was so flustered and scatter-brained, she didn't even properly apologize. It seemed like it was her first night on the job or something because it truly seemed like she did not know how to handle the conflict at all. She was all over the place. She said things along the likes of ""this is a high-stress job, I don't know what to tell you, there's so much going on"". It was ridiculous. THIS is Brass Monkey's manager? Really? Her? Wow. Looked more like a helpless baby deer caught in headlights to me. Manager? Of what? How? Couldn't even manage a small situation. Must suck to not know how to do your only job.

So I talked to the barman, she didn't do anything, I talked to security (it turns out that he didn't worked there but he was friends with few of the security guards so they did nothing and started saying that they saw the situation - when they wasn't even there- and that his hand was ""just there""). Finally, I talked to the security manager and when he went to talked to the guy, he started being aggressive,  he yelled at me, threatened me, insulted me and nobody did nothing (beyond grabbing him so he wouldn't punch me) but they let him stay there and get away with it. That's what really bothers me, we live in a world where it is ok to do that, a guy can easily get away with sexual harassment and I ""shouldn't have said anything and act like nothing happened"", the best part is when he tried to say I was a ""crazy girl"" making stories. I think that if the guys in charge of ""security"" don't care about people's security in the place... the place should be closed!",,,
180,Bernardo C.,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",535,161,54,4.0,4/9/2016,Fun bar on a Friday good for dancing moderately priced drinks good atmosphere several floors and good location in meat packing. Overall lit atmosphere,,,
181,Hayley J.,"Manhattan, NY",167,93,3,2.0,11/8/2015,"Came here on a Saturday night when this bar was in full on club mode.  Perhaps I should preface this review by saying that I'm not really a clubgoer.My friends arrived at 10:30 and got in fine.  I had some transportation issues (THANKS MTA) and didn't make it until midnight.  The line was ridiculously long.  I would've turned and left had my friends already not been inside already and having a really good time.  The line was hardly moving except when large groups of people got tired of waiting and left.  I was about to do the same when the bouncers finally let me in.  Took about 90 minutes.  People kept cutting, and I'm pretty sure people were also pay to get in.  I'm not mad that they let people willing to pay get in cut the line, amusement parks do the same thing.  After finally getting close enough, though, I was able to see small groups of really pretty girls walk up front and they were let in.  That was frustrating for me because, there I was, all by myself, but I still had to wait.  Guess I wasn't cute enough!The people inside did seem to be enjoying themselves.  It was packed, as one would expect a club to be on a Saturday night, and the music was so loud I had to wear earplugs.  My friends had found a little corner table in one of the bars in the way back, same room as the DJ (aka a guy with a MacBook.)  I was able to get to the bar and would've had no problem ordering, but after my experience getting in, I didn't want to give that place my money!  I just wanted to dance!  It wasn't super packed in that particular area, but there were people so drunk and spilling things, it made dancing difficult.  We kept getting backed into the wall.  Oh, and we got to watch a number getting thrown out for reasons unknown.  Not so much fun.I think I spent more time waiting to get in than I did inside.  At least, it certainly feels that way.  I'm not sure if I'd return.  I definitely would recommend arriving early, that seemed to be the consensus I overheard on the line.  Get there by 10/11 for an easier entry.",1,2,1

183,Mindy T.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",484,714,614,2.0,10/22/2015,"Came here for drinks with a small group on a Friday night, but early.. around 7pm.  The roof was pretty busy, but not overcrowded.  Everyone was at a table.We had a few friends that we were meeting up with that were already there.  We waited a good 15-20 minutes before anyone came over to get our drink order.  One of us was on our way down to the bar when someone finally showed up.  After she took our order, it took another 15 minutes before we got our drinks (just beer and wine, nothing crazy).Service is EXCRUCIATINGLY slow when you are waiting for drinks on the roof. My suggestion is to get a drink at the bar on your way up to the roof. And then order from your table server.  Because then at least you can enjoy your drink while you wait for your next one or food.Location is great and popular among the young crowd.",1,1,2
184,Saeesh B.,"Edison, NJ",0,2,1,1.0,9/11/2017,Very slow service on the rooftop .. There need more waiters.. They need to hire more people to serve. We had to wait for a long time to get a hold of the waiter.. They did a good job once they were able to get to the table.. But slow service in general .. More staff needed,,,
185,Victor B.,"New York, NY",4,183,0,4.0,9/2/2017,"Great bar in the Meatpacking area. The drinks are reasonably priced, has a very young crowd, the bartenders were friendly and efficient and spans 4 floors. The 4th floor is a rooftop which has a nice view of the city.",,,
186,Bruce L.,"Manhattan, NY",163,30,13,3.0,7/14/2014,"I want this to be my go-to rooftop bar, but no dice. It's fun, but it's your run of the mill dive bar. There are 3 floors which all seem to have a bit of a different crowd. I've been here when there were events which seems like a good idea. The one bright spot is this ridiculous drink called ""The Lunchbox"" which is a mixture of two sugary drinks - probably a liqueur and a energy drink. What makes this drink fun is the bartender lines up 5-10 pint glasses filled with one drink and a shot of an other standing on the top rim of the glass. A little push and the drinks come together like a horizontal sake-bomb domino. This place is fun and a decent rooftop spot.",2,,1
187,Lina K.,"Edgewater, NJ",432,561,63,3.0,9/9/2015,Came here on a Friday night and it was packed.  It was too crowded to go out on the roof so we hunkered down in a booth by the front door.  Our server was very nice and drinks were pricey but good.  I would like to try this place out on a less crowded night to give a better review.,2,,1

Updated review","I would say to try to pregame or go to another bar before coming here because it's sometimes really hard to get to the bar depending on the day and time you go ( mainly because of the amount of people). The crowd is generally 20s to 30s. I like the fact that the place is really big and can accommodate to different vibes. For example upstairs ( the top floor) is more of drinking, talking and hanging out. On the main floor towards the back they have more of a dance floor with mainstream music. Would go back again on a  Friday or Saturday.",,,
189,Dylan M.,"Sydney, Australia",126,14,3,2.0,8/19/2015,"Nice place, the rooftop has a great vibe at sunset! However... Either very badly understaffed, or just bad staff.Apparently there are $7 drafts on the rooftop. Where is the bar? Oh, it must be the area where people are bringing drinks from. Oops no, staff only. Oh - it's table service? We've been sitting for 20 minutes nobody approached us. 10 minutes later we finally catch somebody. Another 10 minutes waiting for drinks. 10 minutes waiting to ask somebody for the bill. 10 minutes pass, still no bill. Ask somebody, waiting another 10 minutes for the bill, they forgot to bring back card. We pay cash, wait for card and change for another 10 minutes. Finally, we can't wait any longer and need to walk into the staff-only area to get attention, and demand card and change.Nice place, but customer service on the roof is a complete waste of time. I think we spent about 90 minutes there and only managed one drink...",2,1,1
190,Chrissy K.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,2,0,1.0,12/3/2017,"I chose this bar for my birthday night out on a Friday and I so terribly regret it. The night started out great, a few friends and I showed up around 10:30 pm and got in with no line and secured a table on the second floor because many more friends were going to join us. More and more of my friends started coming, they were playing great music, and I thought the vibes were great! Then right around 12 am/midnight chaos happened: a bouncer was yelling at my group of friends for putting our jackets/bags on our table, when we had at least 6-8 people sitting around that table at all times watching them. Then the main event: from what I remember and from what at least 15 of my friends confirm: someone dropped or threw a drink near me and the bouncer blamed me and asked me to leave. I couldn't understand why so I was asking for an explanation but they wouldn't tell me. One bouncer said to my friend ""Does your friend not speak English, she needs to leave."" Another worker was warning people about the broken glass and I said something to him (I admit I don't remember what) that apparently warranted the following response from him: ""If you're going to be a b**** then you're going to get kicked out."" I am a nonviolent human so I really don't know what I could have said to him to elicit that response. So I went outside and all of the bouncers continued being mean and not explaining anything to me and they wouldn't let me back inside. I proceeded to burst out crying and continued blubbering like a baby all night - so embarrassing and so terrible for my birthday night out! Such a great night quickly turned into one of the worst birthday nights out I've ever had, all thanks to this establishment. And for the record, I have verified these events with all of my friends that were there with me - including the main point that it was NOT me who dropped/threw the drink. ALSO after telling this story to other people, I've heard 3 other stories of extremely rude staff experiences. I will never be going back!",,2,
191,Sophie M.,"Miami, FL",323,1,0,1.0,6/12/2016,I will never return here. The bouncer did not let any of us in and we are all 22+. We googled best rooftops in Chelsea and this came up. Only chose this place because of what we researched. Bouncer was condescending and told us he didn't feel like letting us in.,6,3,1
192,Chary S.,"Brooklyn, NY",313,260,145,4.0,7/24/2015,"I had this bookmarked for thee longest and stumbled upon here when my girlfriend and I decided to grab drinks after the Whitney - art followed by booze is always an ideal date for me.Came here when the weather was peaking - rooftop season, baby! It was fleet week as well so all them sailors were mingling - not my point.First - it gets crowded AF. After a certain hour - I would say 9 close to 10ish pm there is a slight line trying to get in and that means there will be a delay for getting your drinks as well. I left the bar around 1ish and there was a tremendous line.....I mean... a LONG LINE. Anyway, drinks are decent price. I highly recommend going anyway in New York during Happy Hours because NY is expensive as it is, right people? We ordered small bites - fries and chips - surprisingly great guac and salsa! Not many places can really capture the Mexican dips (that's just my personal opinion. Chiptole don't count, y'all).Service is a bit slow due because it's not really a dining place - more of a casual drinking spot. There are full bars on every floor and if you're at the rooftop, there is service. I like this place because of the vibe and energy. It has a lot of lively feels. Music playlist comes in waves. They play Taylor Swift, and I'm cool with that.",2,2,1

198,Evian D.,"New York, NY",409,239,432,3.0,5/27/2014,"Brass Monkey really was a great space to catch up with my friends. This is basically close to the water but in Meatpacking so it has so many places nearby. We had arranged to begin our night at this spot, and see where we went from there, but honestly, it was pretty cool and we could carry out conversation pretty well so there was no need to go anywhere else and be packed. We sat on the second floor, and even though pretty spacey and not much people, it felt very warm (almost uncomfortably warm) and the servers would constantly disappear form view. When they did appear, they were very nice and brought the drinks out pretty quick. I did not taste the food, but I can say that their chicken wings and drumsticks are pretty good size for the price. Same with same some of their other fritters they offer. They have the angry Orchard on tap as well as Magners, both, my favorite ciders. I also had a margarita even though not the very best I have had, it definitely was not the worst. This place is possibly one of the better spots I have seen to actually meet up with friends and relax. The lighting is dimmed and the wood focused décor makes you feel cozy and relaxed. Great space!This is a good place to catch a first drink with a first date before heading out to dinner at a nearby Meatpacking restaurant.",1,1,1
199,Monica Z.,"Queens, NY",256,27,9,5.0,1/26/2017,Ive come here on several occasions & it's either hit or miss crowd wise. Bartenders are great & it's  usually fun on weekend nights.,,,
