I do my very very best to be on time but I got a little twisted around in the subway--they understood as they mentioned they too still get lost on the train. When I arrived I needed a drink to unwind a little--can you guess can you guess what it was? Ginger beer, right, you all know me so well lol. My friends ordered a round of beers as well, except theirs were brown in color--perhaps fake beer? Haha. We all had a great time laughing, catching up, snapping photos, making weekend plans and drinking beer. They also served popcorn apparently--I did not partake but my friends did. They seemed to like it but the salt made them more thirsty.",9,5,6
1,Casey D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,3.0,11/9/2018,Solid bar.. Brooke is one of the best bartenders I've ever met. Absolutely fabulous. Not so fabulous? The ridiculously uncomfortable backless stools and expensive well drinks. I've brought TONS of fiends here and they all say the same thing.. Expensive wells and backless stools are a bar ruiner.

4,Sonal U.,"New Hyde Park, NY",174,131,177,4.0,10/14/2016,"Okay now when you first enter whiskey rebel you think of the potential of it being rowdy or closely packed in because it is a small place BUT you must push through to the back. I was first introduced to this place by my close friend from college Liz who always has amazing recommendations! Aesthetics- dolla bills hanging from the ceiling, drink specials board for all day drinks, seats in the bac ( comfy and secluded ) and a large table to host big party of people.Warnings:1)if you do sit in the back, a waitress will be serving you drinks rather than getting drinks at the bar.  2) during football games it gets super packed in the weekend as with every bar 3) they do NOT have food other than popcorn ( which I think is awesome because a lot of bars don't give freebies anymore) BUT you can order food from other places with this apparent tax that you have to give some to the waitress ( it may just be a joke but I tend to be uncomfortably gullible with awkward situations) With that said , this is my go to after grad school tests place to wind down Oh yeah the music is on point",1,1,

The prices are right, the bar hot dogs are everything, but in my humble opinion, the biggest draw is definitely the staff, specifically Katie the bartender! They will make you feel right at home, and being a seasoned New Yorker, it's rare to see such hospitality. Don't miss out on this bar!",,,

Easy on the salt there though ladies, not trying to OD on sodium. Seriously tho, this makes me happy.Decent place to watch sports. $5 pickleback shots too (altho the jame-o tasted a tad watered down when I had em...)They have ginger beer! I love moscow mules, so this makes me pretty happy too. Music is pretty decent as well.My only real gripe is:Whiskey is in your name and your whiskey prices kinda stink.

12,Kristina L.,"New York, NY",1,2,0,1.0,12/23/2017,"This place WAS good until the bartender irresponsibility gave my card to another patron who left with it. I could maybe, MAYBE, understand if this place was filled wall to wall with patrons, but there were only a handful of people in there. What's worse is that she swore the other patron was a ""regular"". Meanwhile, I'm trying to understand/comprehend how, if she was a regular, you don't know her name/the right name on the card/tab.  In addition, once the manager decided to show up to discuss the situation, he didn't even care (much like the bartender) and only blamed it on an ""honest mistake"" rather that the irresponsibility of his careless staff. Never again will I go to this place, a place that doesn't even take responsibility for their own actions and missteps. Because somehow they made it seem like it was my fault the card was lost; meanwhile I gave it to them, TRUSTING THEM to be careful with my personal property. Beyond ridiculous. Do not ever go here, unless you don't want to get access to your money again. If I could, this place would get zero stars for the irresponsibility alone. No special can cover up the flaws in this scam of an ""establishment"". Never again will I step foot in this place. True con artists, at best.",1,,
13,Sophie F.,"Maplewood, NJ",194,233,15,4.0,1/2/2016,"Let's preface this review by saying I am old and staid these days. Got that? Good.ANYWAY...I have a girlfriend who is enamored with this bar and a few others in this area. So when we were too lazy to look for a place for drinks, we fell back on her favorite dive, Whisky Rebel. We came here on a Tuesday. In my opinion, you avoid the crowds and a-holes in general when you do things on a random weekday in NYC. Meaning Mondays and Tuesdays only. People are still recovering from the weekend and the start of the work week on Mondays and Tuesdays but they are ready to start it all over again come Wednesday. We mainly came out to have a few drinks and catch up. The same thing we talked about 6 months ago was the same thing we talked about that same night. Nevertheless, it was still good to get together and Whiskey Rebel on a Tuesday evening was the perfect place. Drinks were reasonable by NY standards, the place was not quite empty, but it was far from crowded. We were able to talk without shouting and most importantly, I did not have to take drastic measures to get a damn drink. All I had to do was approach the bar, find an opening, get my drink, and pay. Took me about 2 minutes. As a bonus...the music was good. I mean, who doesn't like hearing the Top 20 and other mainstream music while drinking reasonably priced alcohol and catching up with girlfriends? Well if you don't then i have no words for you buddy. No. Words.Aslo as others said, there is free popcorn. Is it delicious? I have no clue. There are some things I just won't do. Like nuts and popcorn at a bar. To sum it up, this place was perfect for what we had in mind.  I will be back..maybe (on a random weekday, of course).",3,,1
14,Lauren B.,"New York, NY",485,390,60,3.0,12/21/2015,"Are you interested in a bar that is rank and dank and dimly lit? Very little space, themost disgusting bathrooms ever in life and very little air conditioning? Yes, this place has it all. But I don't mind it. There are a couple redeeming factors in play here that are important to note.The free popcorn is tasty! And FREE! So all you cheapos out there, rejoice. The bartenders are super nice and super speedy. They are great at handling throngs of people pushing up to the bar and being cool, nice and swift to hand you your beverage. They do buy backs! Actual, honest to god, buy backs. We were there about three hours one night, a group of about 10 of us, ordering beers, vodka and shots. They bought us a round of beers. Awesome touch. The final thing that I like about this place is the music. It't great! It's all 90's hitlist and 2000's hit list. I got to sing to Britney, Spice Girls, Eminem, ect. This of course made us dance around, stay longer than we should have and order more drinks. I'm not usually in the mood for this sort of vibe, but when I am, this dive delivers.",1,1,1

You feel twice a drunk when you're stumbling around in fog, points for that.The crowd was awesome, very friendly people. Easy to make friends, no creeps. Cheap beer, decent bathrooms.They might have the BEST bouncer in the whole city. I know I got his name but it's lost now, however he's a really friendly, funny guy who could definitely have a side job bar tending if the mood strikes him. My only peeve was that the bartender kept turning off the jukebox when she didn't like the songs we pit on. It was after midnight on a Saturday, at which point the DJ or whoever packs it up and the people pick the music, but she wasn't digging rock. She was still sweet, and she wanted to get people dancing, but I think it's nice to have a balance in a sports bar anyway. Great time overall, will be back.",,,

Drinks are reasonably priced and for being a crowded bar they made a very satisfactory version of my favorite go to drink: a mojito. They don't sell food, but do provide bowls of delicious popcorn AND allow you to order outside food to eat there. Kind of an interesting scheme which ordinarily I would have found very clever, but if you show up hungry like we did it's disappointing to not be able to order any apps right away.

Stumbling upon this place by happenstance on a Friday night at around 11 p.m. It was surely destined to be...People were ""dancing"" (some with lesser amounts clothing), the bar was packed and the aroma of butter and whiskey filled the air. Without hesitation, I ordered a whiskey at the bar. ""$8 dollars"" she said, I must be in heaven. Jack Daniel's here was inexpensive and it only became cheaper as I ordered. At this point, I didn't need free popcorn, no disco lights, just show me the way to the whiskey.The Whiskey Rebel reminds me of a college bar filled with patrons of all ages. Rammed to the door with the suits of the financial district to the young, naive, and belligerent young ones who just turned 21, this place is definitely for those who don't  mind a bit of free entertainment. With a stable, decent DJ on rotation the Rebel was definitely bumpin' on a Friday night. Cheap drinks, cheap whiskey, plenty of TVs for sports, and a field of drunken women and men, there isn't much more I need to have a good time. I'M SOLD!!!!!",2,2,1

It's absolutely not a dive, it appears as such but inside there's usually a fun atmosphere. Free popcorn, fireball/pickle back shots and hilarity. Bartenders are generally these cute, fun girls. Alessia (sp?) and Anna are my fav ladies! They are very kind and spunky. The tuesday girl (I forgot her name, she's a floater, I think she's mainly at the sister bar Whiskey Trader) is also great. Makes a fun old fashion. A few of the girls are kinda blah, this one chick asked my bf ""do you want a shot?"" and he said ""sure"" and generally that means it's on the house but he got charged.

We visited NYC during the coldest week EVER, and were desperate looking for a way to warm ourselves up. Our answer: WHISKEY SHOTS!!! The first time we stopped in it was in the middle of a Wednesday afternoon, so we were the only ones in the bar, understandably. The couple times after that we came on Friday and Saturday evenings, and this place gets pretty packed! They serve free popcorn, too, which is definitely a plus. $5 shots of Jameson with a pickle back (how come I've never had this before? It's AMAZING!!), and $3 PBRs.

51,Alina G.,"New York, NY",202,108,26,4.0,1/11/2012,"A few days ago I found myself on the block of Whiskey Rebel for reasons that did not involve wanting/needing a drink....or at least having the ability to do so. But I must say I was intrigued by the name. On a block filled with interesting curry spots, I was drawn to the whiskey by an unknown force. I did a walk by at least 3 times and decided that the scene was a little too frat for me and explored onward. Couple hours later, I gave up and went in anyway.Immediately I noticed the amount of tvs up. Some football game was on that was holding just about everyone's attention. The bar was filled with what appeared to be suburban out-of-town jocks so I made way to the rather small back area. My friend asked if there was a food menu and we were informed that while there was no kitchen, ordering take out from outside the bar was A-OK. That is pretty darn cool in my book. They had a collection of menus from which you can order. Later on in the night, another patron ordered Chinese so it smelled quite heavenly. Nothing quite as rich as Chinese take out smells.All in all its a pretty ""chill"" spot. No one gets in your way or looks obnoxious enough to even want to. I imagine its a very nice spot to watch a game if you are into that sort of thing. There were 2 arcade games near the bar but I didn't see anyone playing them. I came there for an impromptu group meeting for work and in retrospect that was probably not the place for it as it was wildly loud. It did make for loosening up, though. Ah yes, it must also be noted that they give lots of free popcorn! Totally recommended if you are looking for a casual bar.",2,2,2

I had noticed it opened a couple months back, and it's the only bar on Lexington Avenue until you get further north (Bro Jimmy's). Given most of the action happens on 3rd Avenue in this area, it's nice to have one small spot open up. It wasn't terribly crowded on a Thursday night, and I like that they opened up the windows to let the cool night air in. The TVs are well-sized and placed, and you get free popcorn (always a plus with me). Beers are priced standard for Manhattan ($6 for an Amstel Light), and overall it's a very chill mood. The one thing I didn't like was that they blast the music too loud...if they're going to have it that high, they need to get better speakers, because I could barely make out what was coming out of them besides a bunch of loud noise.All in all, this is a nice addition to the neighborhood and definitely a nice place to check out if you're looking for a couple of drinks and looking to take it easy.",1,,

Overall, there is nothing off the charts about this spot, but it is consistently a laid back, good time!",,,

I don't think a whole lot of whiskey gets poured here, at least not the good stuff. The crowd was also unexpected. Not the crowd my Whiskey joints in Portland would attract at least. The vibe was very young, the music was Loud club music. I think they had happy hour going so there were a lot of ""foo foo"" shots going out. Bartender looked us funny when we ordered Manhattans. Ha ha. Guess we'll do a round or two here and move on, i think comically. Cocktail waitress was extremely friendly. Complimentary popcorn is brought to the table. If I was looking to really turn it on for the night, this would be a great place. Where me and my drunk friends can order shots and yell at each other without looking like as*holes! Unfortunately, we were trying to grab a nice cocktail and have a good conversation with a friend who lives in the City. So we downed our Manhattans and shoved on.

I'm somewhat of a professional, functioning alcoholic with a drinking acumen focused on the customer experience.  In my 20+ years of research... I've never seen another bartender with the keen awareness of her customers... And a bias for action when I'm ready for my next drink.  Either she's from the future and employs a terminator-like ability from the other end of the bar to ascertain when my glass is tilted at a 78% angle (signifying .5 to 1 ounce left) OR can see through aluminum cans.  In addition... She has incredible peripheral vision and can be serving someone with her back to you... And then turn right around and begin getting your next cocktail ready.  On one occasion... I even calculated her average response time between drinks... And it was @ 20 seconds...without me even asking or signaling for another drink!  Recently, I saw her working solo during a World Cup game.   Easily over 100 people in the bar... And I barely saw an empty glass in the joint.If you want my expert opinion... And feel the need to get a few drinks in during the day (sadly... She only works days... Wed-fri)... Run!  Don't walk to the whiskey rebel!... Then stumble home.  She also works weekends.   My one gripe about the WR is that she doesn't work Monday or Tuesdays... Or nights.   If I was the owner,  I would make her work from open til close... 7 days a week!   Or clone her.I'm confident that you will be hard pressed to find a better bartender in NYC...

It's not too large and imposing, but not too small either, it's just right.

I complained to a bartender who claimed to be the manager who sided with the bouncer (out of obligation in my opinion).  I will never go back to this bar after this experience and their bartenders will not have a chance to allow me to tip them my typical 50%.,1,2,1
