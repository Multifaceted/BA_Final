0,Nicole L.,"Jersey City, NJ",23,21,9,5.0,6/21/2018,"My sister and I were looking for a place near the passport agency, and we stumbled upon Le Pain Quotidien across the street. This is a cute little place that's a hybrid of a walk-in cage and a full-service restaurant. My sister had the chicken and mozzarella tartine and raspberry lemonade, while I had the turkey club with Caesar salad and iced matcha latte. Both of our food was really good, and the blueberry cheesecake for dessert just topped it all off. Glad we strolled upon this awesome find!",,,
1,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1523,1489,3.0,1/17/2018,"This has been a place where I usually get a quick breakfast to go. Tuesday afternoon however, decided to try a sit-down lunch considering the interesting menu options.After getting a nice seat near the window, went through the menu and ordered the Turmeric Latte ($5) and the Butternut Squash/Goat Cheese Frittata ($13). Certainly on the expensive end for lunch-time; this was actually one of the cheaper entrees on the menu. Latte comes out first - a foamy layer on top and a thick brew underneath. Was expecting more of a turmeric punch, and the consistency reminded me a lot of matcha lattes. Frittata comes out a few minutes later - a slice of baked egg with squash and goat cheese mixed in. Not too filling and easy to eat. Side salad was negligible and the bread was a little tough.Service here started off well, yet getting the check took some time. Fine enough to try, but will stick to getting morning pastries rather than sit-down lunches.",4,1,1
2,Ran F.,"New York, NY",91,13,0,1.0,10/13/2018,Updated: 30 mins later. Worst decision of this weekend was stepping foot in here with my children.  RVEIEW: Worst LPQ in the city from a service perspective. This place is operating with barebones staff and can't handle 30% occupancy...can't imagine what this place looks like full. Just close on weekends guys....such a painful experience.,,,

French wine!I ordered the 3 bean chilli, and it came within 5 mins...I'm charging my iphone now... they have a few conveniently placed outlets.Forget about nasty bartenders who ignore you, forget bars! Come here instead!! To a French bakery!They were playing Nancy Sinatra/Sinatra duet (""Something Stupid"")... in French!!This place is a simple bakery but it's making me swoon!!Only thing is they close early (8pm)... I'm not leaving until then, having 2-3 glasses wine...",,,
4,Soraya R.,"Miami, FL",120,20,32,5.0,3/11/2018,Super delicious place! I had the Ham and Gruyer Croissant along with a Cappuccino and it was magnificent!,1,,
5,Yu W.,"Morristown, NJ",102,403,502,3.0,9/29/2017,"it is a nice​ and relax​ place​ for an afternoon chat with friends. The seating setup​ is appropriate​, not too tight. My iced coffee is actually​ ice in coffee, even I have emphasized: ​ ""not too much ice!"" The coffee itself is​ very good though. I do not understand why people complained about the long line and etc. It is a grab-and-go place after all and maybe I was lucky​ that day.",2,1,1
6,John B.,"London, United Kingdom",214,380,1321,2.0,4/23/2016,"Gets the second star for our server, who was apologetic and polite.Oh dear LPQ....you're a brand I hold in high regard....this was a shambles.Long wait, for drinks and food, no atmosphere, bread sent back as it was clearly yesterday's (you're a bakery at heart no..?)2 blocks away from me and I wanted to use you regularly, I won't be.The guy who served us was good and held up your brand, the rest was really sub standard.",3,1,1
7,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",757,900,1561,4.0,1/5/2017,"Like all Le Pain's, it's the perfect cafe to grab small bites or beverages on the go. I've come here countless times in the mornings to grab a cup of tea or some of their pre-made breakfast sandwiches, to which there are many. I specifically love the almond butter and jelly sandwich on grain bread. They also offer a wide variety of coffees and other beverages for whatever mood you're in. There is a decent amount of seating and it's generally not on the noisy side, making it the perfect place to do some work and have a private conversation. Not too much to say here as Le Pain is a place of convenience. You can always find one in Manhattan and you can expect the same amenities and options at all locations.",4,3,5
8,Sarah B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,8/13/2018,Their service is slow AF. Given them a couple chances and am always super disappointed in how long it takes to get food.,,,
9,The Bee Cove® T.,"New York, NY",1,103,28,5.0,1/2/2018,"Affordable, clean, healthy large portions.  High volume low calorie meals. Rich coffee, tea, friendly and conveniently located across from the passport office.",,,
10,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",748,432,173,4.0,9/20/2016,"When this Le Pain opened up, I knew my wallet was in trouble. I also knew my diet was in trouble. Pretty much everything I made a resolution to do in the beginning of the year was in trouble. But was it worth it? YES. Le Pain is my go to for several things. First of which is the Avocado toast. So much that I've tried replicating it at home, only to give up and then just buy some from Le Pain the next day. Hands down, this is the easiest, simplest, satisfying meal offered. Le pain is also my go-to for midday sweets and coffee--you can always find something in their baked goods display to appease your midday lull. Personally, I enjoy their croissants and danishes to carry me into all of my 2pm-meetings-that-could-have-easily-been-emails. So yeah, this Le Pain? Bad for my New Years Resolution, but good for everything and everyone else.",,1,
11,Jennifer G.,"Westchester Square, Bronx, NY",11,16,10,5.0,5/25/2017,"Amazing location. To sit down and get work done. Staff is always friendly and always have a smile on their face, I came in all the time and they know me by name!! Its nice to be known. Stop by if you want a warm welcoming place to get work done and have a Cold Brew and get there early for the Baked Eggs!! Amazing!!!",,,
12,Isaac M.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",78,5,0,1.0,9/7/2017,"I'm only leaving 1 star because no stars isn't an option. I never leave reviews for places cause i really don't care, but I just had to for this place. FIRST OF ALL. The short bitch at the counter, was exactly that. A BITCH. not just rude beyond belief, but a full blown bitch. She has NO manners, she was extremely impatient with me basically rushing me to order. this was my first time visiting so i wasn't familiar with the menu, and she was getting rude with me giving me attitude cause i was looking at the menu and mind you, there was no line. literally just me, and her damn attitude. when i started ordering she would cut me off. then, she has the damn nerve to ask me if i was gonna leave her a tip!? NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. you don't deserve a tip. I'm extremely dissatisfied with who you guys choose to represent your brand. this place looks super nice and fancy, but the service offered by your associate gives you a TERRIBLE name. never again will i step foot in your establishment, not as long as she's working there. i'm not paying for overpriced coffee and pastries to be treated disrespectfully.",1,,
13,Rio H.,"Denver, NY",30,12,1,1.0,7/11/2017,"They have low ratings every where in NYC as you may check it out yourself. Horrible experience at this particular branch . Manager Peter . Not helpful had to buy a  cup of coffee to be able to use their restrooms poor Customer Service Never again step my feet  on any of their brunches . Stick with Starbucks for sure,",1,,
14,Jessica L.,"Flushing, NY",245,158,1909,3.0,4/11/2016,"It just opened up, went to check it out with some coworkers. Its a big place but i find it rather overwhelming with the way it is set up. You place an order with the cashier and then you stand on the side while another person completes the order. Similar to starbucks I guess, but at least Starbucks has a waiting area. Not complaining really, coworkers and I got the giant chocolate chip, chia muffin and large brownie. They're OK. Next time I will try out their sandwiches, they seem to be the popular/known items.",,,
15,Christina M.,"San Diego, CA",219,60,293,4.0,4/16/2016,"I stumbled upon this location ( I didn't even know there was one here). Waiting and waiting, I was getting a little impatient for my order. The manager came and apologized as he could see I was a little bugged. I was informed that they just newly opened. So that would explain the longer than usual wait for an easy order. He did all he could to please me and insure that I'd come again. Understandably so, there will always be hiccups in a new restaurant. A chocolate chip cookie on the house was also a nice way to show appreciation for my understanding. Good luck to them and I'll be back.",1,2,1
16,Hayden F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",446,9,0,1.0,7/12/2016,"Disgusting. They already overcharge for their half sandwich that was pre made and decided to refund me and make me over pay for a salad, which I had to settle for their terrible, nasty stale bread. Then they presume to try and ""make it up to me"" by offering a coffee on the house which I refused. Totally rude. Do not waste your time!",1,,
17,Inna Z.,"Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, NY",36,8,0,1.0,11/20/2016,"The worst location ever. Poorly trained employees who are always rude and mess up orders all the time. There have been 4 instances of lack of attention to detail on my orders - where I requested gluten free and was given regular bread, messed up soup orders and poorly assembled salads and tartines. Yesterday I had brunch with my sister and sat at the table services by Rasheeda. I have never been treated this rudely by a server. No greeting. We sat at the table for 10 minutes before I had to flag her down and was given a dirty look. When she finally mate her way to our table she asked "" what do you want""? Wow. How rude. We ordered and waited way too long for food to finally be brought out. She places the soups carelessly and spilled hot tea without any acknowledgment. Told us there are no clean soup spoons and brought us tea spoons. What??? This is not a diner. We come in to eat healthy food and have pleasant service. When I tried to get the check and tried to once again flag her down again she just ignored me. I had to go to a counter and demand a check. I watched her continue her rude tirade to all other tables. Granted she was alone servicing all tables. So you have a location that is understaffed and staff that is very poorly trained. This location is close to my job but I will never return. It's awful when you spend $50 on lunch and are left with such an unpleasant feeling. ------------------------------------------------- iPhone8,1 ios  10.0.2- app version 2.2- email signed up with : innasensedesign@aol.comSent from my iPhone",1,1,
18,Christina Y.,"New York, NY",1,46,2,2.0,5/22/2017,Terrible service! The rudest cashier ever. I asked for a brownie and the lady gave me a packaged one. I said I wanted the fresh one that wasn't packaged and she gave me a rude look and said it would cost more money. I said I was happy to pay. She didn't even acknowledge me after that and just took my money. Two stars go to the brownie but zero stars to the staff. Not coming back!,1,1,
19,Eva N.,"Manhattan, NY",2,25,0,1.0,4/17/2017,"The special was a salad with mangos and cashews - I love mangos and I love cashews so I ordered it. There were 5 cashews but I couldn't find a single sliver of mango. ""Where are the mangos?"" I asked. ""Oh,' said the manager, ""we don't have any mangos today. none of them are ripe."" THEN WHY THE HELL IS THAT THE SPECIAL FOR TODAY????",1,,
20,Brenda B.,"Inwood, Manhattan, NY",5,16,12,1.0,7/14/2016,"Second time here. The first time I was completely ignored until the manager instructed the waitress to take my order. Today, I walked out after the waiter seemed to have forgotten about me as he took several other orders. Both times were fairly empty. Extremely disappointed and won't be back.",1,,
21,Erica H.,"Manhattan, NY",29,47,36,5.0,7/25/2016,"Went this morning and had breakfast with my boyfriend. I have never been to this restaurant before, but menu looks delicious, everything looked fresh, and our service was exceptional. Even my boyfriend, who is extremely grumpy in the morning, said that our waitress had a very pleasant vibe about her. I'm not sure what her name was, but she was a young very pretty black woman with teal nail polish. She was great. We'll be back",,,
22,E. S.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,2,0,5.0,2/21/2017,"While other times that I have come here service has been quite slow, Crystal/Kristen has made a noticeable difference to the quality of the place and has been an absolute delight. Food and drinks are always good and I like the ambiance here!",,,
