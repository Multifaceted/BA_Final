0,Shannon F.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",154,173,23,4.0,7/17/2018,"Debated coming here after reading conflicting reviews, but seeing the amount of comments of how good the wings were sold us and we had to try it. Came in on a Sunday evening around 5:30pm. There was a couple of tables but not overly full. The waiter approached us very quickly and got us seated and we got our drinks relatively quickly. There were only 2 employees working on the front end, so we were more patient knowing they were running around, plus we were not in any type of rush. We ordered the combo platter appetizer and a cob salad to share. Bottom line... we didn't leave any food on the plates. Everything was super good, the wings were very crunchy on the outside but moist on the inside, the buffalo cause was just the right amount. The potato skins were very full and tasty, the mozzarella sticks, well those are hard to mess up and these did not disappoint. The only negative is we got 3 dips with the appetizer and no explanation of what they were (they were all bomb though), however we would have liked to know what they were rather then us guessing. The salad was perfectly dressed with a kick, the toppings evenly split between crunchy and soft and it was the perfect size to share with the combo app. We live in the neighborhood and can't believe how long it took to come in, but we will be back.",,,

She was a superwoman and did a good job trying to keep everyone happy. No, this review is about the food. I sought to re-live some pub-like memories residing  in the UK during my formative years so I ordered the fish and chips. This proved to be a mistake, as the fish was badly burnt, and hard as a rock and basically splintered into small pieces as I tried to cut it into manageable pieces. More like stone and chips!

My friend and I came for an early dinner and I kid you not, not a soul was in the restaurant. Thankfully, a few people came in after us and sat at the bar. It's a small place but plenty of tables. Fills up quick at prime dinner time. Service is nice, fast and friendly. We ordered a grilled chicken club sandwich and spinach, cheddar, bacon omelette to share. The sandwich was just okay. The bread was a bit harder than I liked and it was semi-cold. The fries were overdone in the oil. You could taste the super fried taste. Omelette wasn't bad but tasted like it was left on the table for awhile. Cheese was melted inside but hard. It wasn't bad but I've had better, warmer, hotter food.",1,,

They have a good variety of food if you are looking for a good lunch spot. The waitress said that the grilled chicken club was the most popular item on the menu, so I ordered it. My two friends ordered the burgers. The burger was really good. It's thick and was over-cooked but it had a ton of flavor! The fries were a hit and miss. Some fries were soggy, over-fried, crunchy, and under-fried. It's like the fries were cooked one by one since they were so inconsistent. The grilled chicken club sandwich I had was nothing special at all. Literally just chicken, lettuce, tomato, mayo set up with three slices of bread cut into four pieces. The chicken had okay flavor, could have had something that would have made it different. It's something you can get anywhere so I would stay away from this item on the menu. Stick with the burgers!",,,

23,Nick B.,"New York, NY",16,6,2,1.0,10/18/2015,"Bayard's is one of those places you keep going to thinking 'well: I had a terrible experience there last time, but it's a cozy Irish pub, how bad could it be?' And then you have another terrible experience.The first time I went there, my laptop was stolen out of my bag. No one's fault but the thief's, but it did set a certain tone.Then there was that time I had an awful first date there and the bartender forgot to put in our dinner order. I told her not to worry about it. It was more important to just get out of there. The bartender insisted that she'd put it in right away. I said 'no really, don't worry about it. Could we just get the check?' When the check came, she leaned in and said 'don't worry: I didn't charge you for the burger.' So: there's a bright side. If they forget to ever give you food that you ordered, they won't charge you for it. The height of courtesy!Twice, I drank beer there without anything unpleasant happening.Then, last night, I reluctantly returned (it's a cozy Irish pub, how bad could it be?) and was given a dramatically over cooked burger that the waitress shrugged off as not her problem. I was forced to move twice during the act of attempting to eat it so that the staff could access the basement. (Something that would have been ok if it came with an apology.) And the two harrowed waitresses who were staffing the entire place were impossible to grab to get your check or your order.How bad could it be? Pretty bad. Head up the street to Tavern on Jane or Dublin 6, if you want a cozy Irish bar. Or down towards w 4th and the host of places down there. Bayard's is well worth skipping.",,1,
24,Nina K.,"Manhattan, NY",246,73,29,3.0,4/27/2016,"I love this area for strolling and grabbing food/drinks in nice weather. I happened upon Bayard's doing just that and had a pleasant meal with solid bar food here. There was a decent selection of beers on tap and the crowd was pretty lowkey on a Friday for a late dinner.I enjoyed my cheeseburger -- a bit greasy but good bun and fries and the kind of taste/presentation you'd expect from this kind of pub. We definitely did not overpay for anything which I always like. Our service was a little off, as our waitress didn't know anything about the alcohol she was serving (she recommended a Yuengling to the customer at the next table who asked for suggestions for a sweet cider) and forgot a few things about our order too. I hate to hold that against people or businesses, but it was a bit off-putting at an ale house.All told, a good enough pub in the area. Not dying to return but won't take it out of the rotation in the future either.",1,,

The space itself is small... not much standing/sitting room. However, people still managed to squeeze their way inside. We were lucky enough to snag a high chair at the bar. I knew my Guinness was going to be poured proper when my bartender greeted us with his thick brogue. We got to chatting about Ireland and he was very familiar with the University I studied abroad at! UL represent! It was great chatting - he was such a welcoming guy. Everyone working there were so friendly and we even met some new people along the way. Great way to end the night.

My wife and I sat at the bar and ordered our typical bar food. She had the chili taco fries while I had the buffalo wings. The fries were loaded with cheese and quite bit for 1 person, even 2. It makes a great group appetizer. My hot wings weren't too spicy, but were just enough and flavorful. The chicken was well prepared and fell of the bone. Quite a few TV's for watching the games.",,,

That must be unsanitary and I'm glad I didn't have anything with a lime in it.Would I come here again? Probably not.

There were four other gents inside, and upon entry we were greeted not only by the bartender but everyone else. It was a welcomed considering we were from out of town. The selection was moderate, and food was still available. I found the conversation to be relaxing and the bartender to be quite interesting. We learned he was in the tech sector as programmer/engineer and had taken up simpler means of life for conversations like the one we were having. The rating here is partial to the atmosphere, cleanliness, and demeanor supplied by the staff. I would recommend this place for such things, although I see mixed reviews on the food (below).

If you're lucky enough to come on a Monday night, they also have $0.50 wings during Happy Hour. I took the liberty to jot down all their beers on draft so that you could appreciate what I have, a good selection with Weihenstephan being one of them:- Blue Moon- Weihenstephan Hefeweiss- Delirium Tremens- Radeberger- Duvel Green- Old Speckled Hen- Belhaven Scottish Ale- Goose Island- Blue Point Toasted Lager- Newcastle Brown Ale- Kronenbourg 1664- Guinness- Smithwicks- Six Point Bengali Tiger IPA- Six Point Sweet Action- Yuengling- Stella Artois- Miller Lite- Sam Adams- Sam Adams SeasonalIf wheat beer isn't your thing, I recommend trying the Old Speckled Hen or Belhaven Scottish Ale if you're looking for something smooth without a bold, bitter taste.Bayard's is a dark-lit cozy bar with about 14 stools around a very small U-shaped bar. If sitting at the bar isn't your thing, they do a good job at laying out the tables around the perimeter of this corner bar to give it some privacy. Bartenders are extremely nice and cheerful, always ready to strike a chat. The music never gets too loud nor does the crowd, so it's neither too eerily quiet nor too loud to hear your neighbor. If you're looking to catch the sports game, this isn't your sports bar as there are only two LCD TV's, which usually is tuned into sports, but the crowd here usually has more interesting things to talk about.I tried their Burger with Bacon ($10.95), ordered Medium, which came out a little overcooked. The burger was a bit bland, but the 2-3 slices of bacon were crispy and not too fatty, delicious. The fries were extremely good, perfectly seasoned and fried just right with a crispness on the outside. I also tried the Mini Burgers (4 for $8.95) which were definitely a lot better than my burger, moist and full of flavor. Why couldn't my burger be like that? However, I got over my burger pretty quick and found myself going back to the $4 draft beers, which only raise to $6 after 7pm.

40,Max H.,"San Jose, CA",0,2,0,1.0,12/22/2016,"I have been in the hospitality industry for seven years working for restaurants that range from your neighborhood joint to working for Michelin starred chef's serving celebrities. I've seen it all and am also one of the easiest and most understanding patrons out there because of what I have been through. This was my first time at this bar and will definitely be the last.I was here last night catching up with some old friends over beers. There were 4 of us having a good time until about halfway through our second beer, the waiter walks behind me carrying a plate with a full ketchup ramekin on it. Some lady standing at the bar threw her hands up while telling some story and knocked the ketchup straight onto me. I'm not exaggerating when I say it was all over my jacket, my shirt sleeve and my jeans. She turned around and drunkenly apologized but I could tell she didn't really mean it and I knew she was drunk so I just ignored her and started to clean myself up with my own hands. The waiter never apologized. It took him a few minutes to bring me, get this, a small stack of paper napkins soaked in water. I looked at him in awe. I had ketchup ALL over me and that's what he brought?! I had to get his attention again and ask him for a glass of soda water and a towel. He brought back the soda water and a DIRTY bar towel. I couldn't believe this but clearly wasn't getting anywhere so I just started cleaning myself with it.Meanwhile, one of my friends goes to my defense since clearly the staff didn't give two ***** that I had ketchup all over me. He first just tried to order me a shot of tequila as a condolence. We waited several minutes, it never came. He asked again, never came. Asked a third time and the waiter finally had the balls to say that he had been told not to serve us by the owner. This was INSULTING. We were the victims and had caused zero commotion of any kind. I asked where the owner was so I could speak with him, the waiter responded that he ""hadn't seen him in a while."" Unreal. We went to the bartender to try and talk to an adult (the waiter was a kid and had no ability to handle such a situation). She just kept smiling at us saying ""these things happen. I'm sorry but these things happen, it's a bar."" She then told us the owner left...She bought us a round of shots after we started getting really irritated at how we were being dismissed. I don't really care about the shots, and honestly the ketchup spilling sucks, but it's not the type of thing that ruins my night. What I was so pissed about and the reason I am writing this is because of how poorly we were treated. The waiter never apologized or even brought me a clean towel to clean myself with. The bartender was extremely dismissive. The owner who we never saw cut us off. Not the lady that caused the whole spill who was CLEARLY drunk. And then he left without speaking with us. I don't expect free stuff out of these situations. Accidents happen. I expect respect from the staff and for them to care that one of their guests has been spilled on by one of the servers. I kept completely calm during this entire thing simply asking the staff for explanation as to why we were being treated like this. Just dismissed. Unbelievable how terrible the hospitality of this place is.",1,,

42,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,4.0,4/3/2013,"Bayard's Ale House is probably one of my favorite Irish bars in the West Village area. Unlike a lot of the other surrounding area pubs, it's energetic and thriving, but it's usually less congested and noisy, and you're guaranteed to find a seat or table. They have plenty of domestics and a good list of craft beers on draft. There is sufficient window seating, bar seating, and the space is laid out well. It's a great locale for an after-work happy hour as they have some deals running until 7PM. There are also some TVs along the perimeters of the bar so you can catch that sports game. The crowd is generally mixed and diverse but never obnoxious. Expect to find the locals, professionals, older to younger folks, etc. The space has plenty of natural lighting coming through their large windows by the front while at night, the lights are dimmed. The few times I was here, there was always at least one of my favorite craft beers on tap. Last time I stopped by, they had Six Point Sweet Action and Allagash White. They carry all your domestics, draft or bottled, as well. Pricing is generally average, about $6-7 a pint, but as stated before, they run a happy hour until 7PM (I believe $4-5 for drafts and 50 cent wings). The food here is also good. I've had mainly bar food/appetizers, and they serve rather sufficient portions that are great for sharing. Between my husband and a friend, we had the Bayard's Combo Platter which pretty much contains everything -- wings, skins, rings, tenders, sticks and dips. On one other occasion, I had the corned beef sliders which were actually crazy good. If anything, you can't go wrong with any of the apps, but they have a full menu of main entrees and desserts. I will also point out my appreciation to Bayard's attention to the appearance of their space. On certain holidays or occasions, they decorate this place rather nicely. Last time I was here for St. Patrick's Day, they adorned the ceilings with little paper shamrocks and lights. It wasn't tacky or over the top decorating, and it really added to the atmosphere of the place. To wrap it up, I'd highly recommend Bayard's if you're looking for a good Irish pub in the area that has decent food, friendly service, and a great atmosphere. It's a reliable spot just to kick back with some friends and enjoy a good beer or two while catching a sports game. It's also in proximity to many positively rated restaurants and other bars. While the area has an active nightlife, it's still controlled because it's by residence. Try to check it out before 7PM to take advantage of their happy hour.",,,1

They have a pretty good beer selection and the food is surprisingly good. The burger and the ruben are both great. This place is small but has lots of tables, so it's perfect if you're looks for somewhere to sit and chat with friends. It's a little dark but the ceiling is covered in lights which give the place a little character. Overall, this is a great spot to stop in for a quick bite or to grab drinks with friends.",,,

The service was good, waitress was very accommodating. However, 2 tables which sat after us both received their food. One only ordering salads, which made sense and the other ordered burgers. We were the only black people in the place. No one could explain why we hadn't gotten our food yet. When it finally came out, I refused it and the bartender then told me I HAD TO PAY FOR IT. As if that made any sense. So we paid for our drinks and left. I was extremely shocked but my boyfriend wasn't.  Racial discrimination isn't something I expect from THE melting pot, New York!

It just didn't taste that good. I had the grilled chicken and guacamole Sandwich on a hard roll. The fries and the soho were good.

51,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1142,623,2346,3.0,8/5/2012,"I ended up at Bayard's Ale House after a night of drinking w/ my friends. My companions and I had been out for a night on the town and were still in the mood for a few cocktails... plus, we had the late night munchies!! At any rate, Bayard's was on our path home, and a friend suggested we stop in to satisfy our cravings. All in all, the experience was good--they served tasty drinks and good bar food, and the service was fine. For drinks, we all ordered cocktails from their specialty drink menu (a couple of us got Margaritas, one person got a Mint Julep, etc.). All of the drinks were tasty enough (although they could have been a little stronger), but I think next time I'll stick to beer. (This seems to be the general consensus from other Yelpers as well). For food, I ordered the Bayard's Combo Platter appetizer for the table to share. The platter consisted of chicken wings, potato skins, onion rings, chicken tenders, & mozzarella sticks. And, even though it was obvious that most of the items started out frozen, they were tasty enough--i.e., your typical bar food. Nonetheless, we gobbled it all down, and no one had a complaint. =)If you're expecting a fine dining experience, this is not your place. The atmosphere, food, and drinks are more tavern style. But, if that's all you're looking for, Bayard's will certainly fit the bill.",,,

Come in, watch a game, have a few Belhavens and some fish and chips. My good friend used to live up the street, so I pretended to be her. Just call me Pam. The pub menu is pretty diverse - almost kooky: shepherd's pie, nachos, Asian pot stickers and tuna club. I had the latter two.

In other words, really undercooked.  Burger and fries were good. PS the orange juice they served was so unlike orange juice - fizzy! - that I had to ask if they'd served me a mimosa instead.

Updated review","Hmmm...came back with a large group as we couldn't fit at the 2 places we'd hoped to go to (following a surprise party)...while I'd wanted to avoid this type of divey bar at all costs, we knew they had a fair amount of seating along the side of the establishment and therefore would be a safe bet...The dirties weren't that great, but our collective bill was under $100 (well, for a few rounds of shots and a few drinks - for about 10 people at that point since we lost a fair amount while searching for a place which could accommodate us, so maybe they undercharged or split it up and it wasn't as great a deal as i'd thought at the time..)Not my type of place, but if you have a large group on a saturday night and want somewhere low key where you can all sit together it does the job...also if you like divey bars, this could be right up your alley.",,,
106,Brett W.,"Los Angeles, CA",221,194,17,3.0,6/27/2009,"THREE STARS, and I'm going to break it down in three easy steps.1. I like the actual set up and environment. My friends and I had a nice window seat in which we could gaze out into the street whenever conversation lulled (juuust kidding). They have TVs playing sports but it wasn't a raucous sports bar, thankfully. Just another thing to watch when conversation lulls (joookes). 2. No fries with my $9.25 chicken club? You are dead to me.3. Despite #2, the chicken club was actually very, very tasty. But is my only ""side"" really just a pickle? I don't know . . . I could finder a cheaper sandwich--granted, maybe not as good--that comes with fries. Just an OK place. Thus, three stars.",4,5,3

That makes absolutely no sense especially since they had it posted on every table that Happy house was until 7pm!! Maybe I wasn't the right skin color for this restaurant. Manager Matthew, was terrible as was server Marija who didn't even know what was served (Irish Carbomb...oh no, we don't have that!) Will never come back to this place and I suggest the White Horse which is half a block away.Where tradition & Good Service nerve go out of style...what tradition are they supported is my question...Guess if I was an ""Irish"" patron or a ""regular"" customer, I would have been treated properly.

There were just a few early birds at the bar and one other table occupied.Despite the lack of customers, our waitress seemed flustered and was a little slow. Not excruciatingly bad service, but it could've been better.My friend had a cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg on top, which was so big he took a picture of it to send to people. Cutting it in half and smooshing the buns made it manageable.  I had a standard club sandwich--four triangles of turkey, ham, bacon, tomato and lettuce. It was good but gone too fast, especially since neither dish came with fries or any sort of side. I ordered dessert, their blueberry crumble with whipped cream. It was deeelish. Warm and gooey. It was kind of a lot but I ate it all (due to smaller than expected sandwich).

116,Megan S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,4/7/2013,"We, my husband and I, have been going to Bayards every weekend for about 10 months. We've enjoyed the tasty food, friendly service, and great atmosphere. Throughout our time living here, we've brought a great deal of new, visiting friends to this bar.   However, literally about 4 hours ago, we were hanging at Bayards, drinking some beers and cocktails.  Our lovely waitress-who is NOT at fault-said that complaints were made about our table discussing ""areola""-Yes, a body part! Confused, we explained to our waitress that our conversation had nothing to with that, but of our friend changing her name to another name that sounds somewhat similar. Therefore, we lowered our voices and changed the topic, despite feeling upset. As we left, vocalizing that the situation was ridiculous, the bartender told one of our friends that she wasn't welcomed back , along with the bartender vocalizing that we were ridiculous.I was thoroughly upset and pissed about the whole situation, considering we are paying customers almost every weekend and brought new friends to support the establishment. With this, the accusations were unwarranted and untrue, and I don't appreciate the attitude we received. I'm sadness that this occurred, and I appreciate our waiter listening to what ACTUALLY happened and sympathizing with us. However, no children were present in the bar, and I see no reason why discussing a body part would have been upsetting to anyone, unless they were completely immature. Regardless, ""areola"" was not being discussed, and I don't see why this became an issue, as we weren't discussing anything to do with this. I'm most upset with the patrons and the  bartender who weren't mature enough to mind their own business and worry about the conversations they were having instead of the convos we weren't having.. While my husband and I enjoyed coming here, we feel extremely upset by what happened and unsure if returning is worth it.",1,2,3

Every bar we'd tried until now was closed. We stumbled in here with the hope of getting one last beer and a hurrah as our final goodbye to the city. The few stragglers seated at the bar when we opened the door cheered as we walked in. Clearly,  all shit-faced. My friend and I were instantly charmed by the only 2 females in the place, one being the gorgeous barkeep and the other being an equally cute off-duty bartender with an English accent. About half an hour later, the two of them managed to kick everyone out and lock the place up. With the 2 of us still inside. Now how fucking cool is that? We sat on our barstools and shot the breeze with these two awesome chicks while downing shots and a few more beers on the house literally until the sun came up.

124,E W.,"Brooklyn, NY",207,322,59,3.0,11/7/2010,"So, I'm reading some of the reviews for this place and it seems like some of the reviewers are getting their knickers all in a twist because they expect that when they go into a bar in the West Village, with a French name, no less; said bar should have good music; fantastic food that's also cheap; hot, friendly bartenders; and maybe get a little hand-release too...Well, I got news for ya...Places like that don't exist.  And if there's one thing I've learned from my trips to Bayard's, it's that they could really give two shits about what you think about them.  Which, as someone who could really give two shits what you think about him; I can honestly relate too.  One of the two bathrooms is usually out of order; ordering beer is a crapshoot (which is to say, kegs might be empty, running out or in dire need of a change); the music plays like a Bargain Basement collection of: ""NOW That's What I Call Shitty Mucic! 12"" (on one recent visit, we heard: Third Eye Blind's ""Jumper,"" Jason Mraz's ""Remedy,"" Crazytown's ""Butterfly,"" and a host of other songs that would make you question what year it is, and then question your sanity); the clientele usually leaves something to be desired (hell, on that same visit, there was a cutting room floor reject from an episode of Jersey Shore, wearing a wifebeater, with a scarf around his neck talking to a zaftig young lady with curves in all the wrong places); and I could go on.  But Bayard's as all about managing your expectations.  If you walk up to the dimly lit corner bar and expect bottle service and Blue Ribbon quality food and for your waitress or bartender to be interested in the boring minutiae of your day, then yeah, you're probably going to be disappointed.  Although the odds are equally as good that you're a moron.  But...If you walk up to the dimly lit corner bar and instead think to yourself, ""My buddies and I can get a half dozen decent wings here on a Sunday or Monday night, for three bucks; knock back a couple pints and be left the fuck alone,"" then maybe this is your kind of place.",1,3,

When I asked our server if she had brought me a house margarita rather than the one I had ordered she insisted that it was the right one. So, I asked her to check with the bartender because I didn't think it was. She never asked the bartender nor did she ever come back to confirm or deny that I had the correct one.

150,D F.,"Marietta, GA",0,1,0,5.0,2/15/2011,"I stopped in here with friends on a Sunday night for a few drinks. It was a very laid back atmosphere, perfect for catching up with old friends. The drinks were just strong enough and the servers were friendly. While we were there it was announced that trivia was about to start. I didn't know what to think......bar trivia..... no thanks! My friends convinced me to stay. It was a blast! Who knew? The trivia hostess is hilarious! We ended up meeting some very interesting people over the course of the evening. This is not the standard West Village hot spot, but who cares. It's comfortable and fun! I highly recommend this bar.",,,
