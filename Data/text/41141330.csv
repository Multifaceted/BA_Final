0,Kristine D.,"Virginia Beach, VA",1253,504,4918,4.0,11/12/2018,"Small bagel shop among hundreds in NYC! It was our first stop after our bus arrived on a Monday morning this past May. We needed a place to relax for a minute, and refuel! We walked in around 6am to a fully stocked view of bagels, bagels, bagels, breads, salads (for lunch I assumed.)Toasties offers bagels, sandwiches, and salads. The place is long and narrow, with only minimal seating because most definitely, people just grab-n-go, such is NYC living/working, right?!Staff - very friendly - I like that many people coming in, knew workers by name and vice versa. Prices - AMAZING. Two bagels with Lox Cream Cheese and a small coffee....DRUM ROLL... $8.71! Everything was delicious as well.I wish we (in Virginia) had Toasties! It definitely hits the spot! and I LOVE me a great bagel and this place serves them for sure!",23,14,21

There is very limited seating so it's not good for groups, only families of 4-5.I ordered an iced coffee and egg wrap. There was nothing special about the iced coffee but it was actually pretty good. The wrap was also nothing special but it was good. They have all kinds of things to choose from including lunch options and snacks.",,,
2,Gwynnie P.,"San Francisco, CA",745,1015,75,5.0,11/4/2018,"A great option for breakfast, especially if you're staying next door at Radio City Apartments as I was! I kept getting a bagel and cream cheese every morning, but another super handy thing they have is cut up fruit, so I got some of that and kept it in my fridge. It was good and fresh....also a great place to pick up bottled water and other drinks. Great iced tea, tried that a few times.Can get zooey on weekday mornings, but nice and quiet on the weekends. Never tried it for lunch but I would if I was in the hood. Very reasonable, nice staff, all fresh and good, what more do you want?",1,,2
3,Courtney C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",481,39,180,5.0,9/25/2018,"Hands down my favorite place to grab lunch in the midtown area. I've been going here for years and they have never failed me. Toasties is a true gem. They have a salads, a wide array of sandwiches and a little known hot bar in the back. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING I've ever eaten from there has been delicious. My favorite sandwich is the Palta. It's grilled chicken breast, which are juicy and flavorful, cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo and guacamole.....mind blowing! The hot bar is definitely worth a try. The herb roasted chicken is a mainstay and is always fresh (they even put whole garlic cloves INSIDE the chicken breasts), so tasty. The veggie sides are always cooked to perfection and seasoned well. A tip, go early as they are always busy during the lunch rush and stay away from the Mac and cheese.",3,,

Updated review","YES YES YES and YEsssssssss So I started this new job in manhattan (50th and 6th and 7th) and my coworkers were raving about how good Toasties was and how awesome the French toast is. After a horrible experience at another restaurant, I figured today I would give it a try!!!Today was a rainy day and I wanted something comforting to eat and this breakfast was just what I needed. The French toast was AMAZING!!! I also got a side of fried egg and ham (both were tasty) ham is a little bit salty but paired great with the sweetness of the toast. The wait is a little long, as it should since the food is great, however be patient because it will be workth iI will definitely be back this week for sure :-)",,,
5,Flora L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",206,366,545,3.0,7/11/2018,"My coworkers always say how good this place is so I decided to give it a try for breakfast this morning. I ordered online through grubhub since I know there is always a line. This place is always crowded so you have to push through people to get to the back where the pick up area is. They don't have a designated sign for 'pick up' which is kind of weird considering they have 'order here', 'pay here', etc. I ordered the breakfast platter with scrambled eggs, home fries, sausage, and toast. My boyfriend got the breakfast wrap.Everything just tasted mediocre at best but for the price, especially for midtown, I guess you can't really complain. I did find huge chunks of egg shells in my egg which I was not too pleased about.All in all, this place is just okay. My coworkers rave about the sandwiches so maybe I would come back to try those for lunch but otherwise, I would pass. Although pretty cheap/good pricing for midtown, the food does not live up to the hype.",1,,
6,Rachel V.,"Pontiac, MI",4,5,1,4.0,11/2/2018,"The food here was sooo good and pretty cheap for the area! The servings are also really big, I was starving when I came in and stuffed when I left! The signage telling you where to go or how to do the line isn't that great, we kinda had to just figure it out pretty simple though. Just work left to right. Â They have signs for where to order and pay but not where to pick up, it's exactly where you pay, just wait for your number. There was a kinda weird smell when we first came in, I don't really know how to describe it but you get used to it after a few minutes so it kinda goes away. We got our food really quick and it was great! Definitely try this place if your in the city and don't want to spend a lot for breakfast!",,,
7,Mi Gusta B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,97,16,5.0,11/12/2018,Amazing sandwiches despite the B rating. Their ordering system works well and the place gets packed quick with people waiting so be patient. Very accomdating with special requests and always a thank you after ordering.,,,

9,Zhen C.,"Miami, FL",568,127,86,3.0,7/26/2018,"TLDR - Wasn't worth the long, wrapping line I came here to try one of my all time favorite combos: lox, onion, tomato, on an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese. Hadn't been back in New York so was looking forward to grabbing a good bagel. It's not that it was bad in any way. Just think that with the amount of options around, they could step up their bagel game a notch. The cream cheese was also very bland, and there was no crispness or fragrant taste in the scallion. After waiting in line for about 20 minutes to order and get my food, I wish it was better.",,,
10,Deanna L.,"Manhattan, NY",11,167,28,3.0,7/5/2018,"Beware, this place is jam packed in the morning, it's so busy you will feel like you're back on the subway as you order on one side, pay on the other side and struggle to get out of the way as you wait for your food. Also, for egg and avocado wrap - why did it take so long? This place does great bacon, egg and cheese, something melting and buttery, definitely great at the classics, bagel and butter, etc. But the healthier options, less fatty and more nutritious are ultimately lacking flavor, there isn't that unctuous sauce or really fresh veggies that could dress up eggwhite and avocado. If you want a simple BLT, go for it, if you want something a little more updated, with a twist, low calorie or a healthier protein, go to another place. Also, what's with the mountain of plastic bags on the counter, eliminate the plastic waste, save the planet!!!!",,,
11,Jennifer N.,"San Jose, CA",233,171,74,1.0,5/2/2018,Food was mediocre and my bagel was overly burnt. Not just a little... OVERLY. Cheese was not even melted and spinach was not cooked? Not sure that that's a thing they do but I would assume it would be at least cooked with the egg or slightly stir fried. Will not return.,2,1,1
12,Courtney S.,"New York, NY",4,89,6,5.0,8/19/2018,Best egg sandwiches in the city! I'm a Long Island girl so it's hard to find an egg sandwich to compare to the ones on the island. This one is by far the best I've had in the city. Super clean place and always a nice and quick staff.,1,,

14,Sydney B.,"New York, NY",55,285,4,3.0,8/7/2018,"A sandwich from Toasties won't necessarily inspire, but it will be fast, fairly big and a decent value for midtown.Efficient service with a large menu of sandwiches, salads and more. Busy at lunch. A little seating.",1,,
15,Nicolas J.,"Long Beach, CA",660,267,460,5.0,9/5/2017,Was visiting from Los Angeles California for a music festival and spent 4 days in New York City so of course I was trying my best to eat like a local and try a new spot every day. I came here with a group of friends whom enjoyed their meals as well but this is my review not theirs ;)I had the western omelette for my meal which came with some potatoes as well with an orange juice on the side. The orange juice is all natural straight from the fruit and you can taste the difference in quality due to this. Considering my meal was $6 and in the city I figured it would be small or lacking flavor. Not only was my meal delicious it was actually filling! I would definitely recommend this place :)The pricing on the other items isn't too expensive either and the wait for the 3 meals we ordered was no more than 5-10 minutes so we were in and out quickly.,1,,
16,Heather R.,"New York, NY",212,248,234,4.0,3/31/2018,"They have the best turkey club sandwich! In reality though, it's all good here. The place was close by my old office and a walkway from us, so we would rush to beat the lunch crowds... get there early to avoid the lines. It gets a little confusing when it's so crowded, but make your way to ordering the sandwich, then move to the two girls to pay and then... the waiting begins. We would stand along the wall with the 25 other people waiting for our numbers to be called. The wait is worth it. Sandwich is big enough to split. Salads are good too.",,,
17,Elise H.,"New York, NY",528,197,839,5.0,6/26/2017,"I think I have found my sandwich soulmate here at Toasties. I came here for a quick lunch in the Midtown area. Food came out within 5-10 minutes of ordering, which is amazing considering the amount of people that were in the shop. The Popeye sandwich is, in my eyes, the perfect chicken sandwich. Picture this: thinly pounded chargrilled chicken topped with fresh red cabbage, earthy alfalfa sprouts, romaine tossed in sweet honey mustard, and melted mozzarella. Smack that goodness in between two perfectly toasted slices of whole wheat bread and there you have it- a balanced blend of savory, sweet, crunchy, and chewy to brighten up the rest of your day. I am thoroughly impressed at the quality of the sandwich considering the traffic and short wait time. Can't wait to try the other sandwiches at this spot! Would recommend getting here a little earlier for breakfast and lunch, as the place is pretty busy.",11,5,7

20,William J.,"New York, NY",8,39,201,2.0,9/23/2018,"Very overpriced salad! I usually eat at cafe Olympia 55 which is 3 blocks away. One time Â I went out with my coworkers to see what's available here.I chose exactly the same salad as I always do, but instead of paying $7.02 I paid close to $12. Over 60% difference!! Here I got much more salad and very few toppings. When I usually ask for mushrooms, I get 3, maybe 4 sliced mushrooms, here I got MAYBE 1. I got MAYBE 1 ounce of cheese, while I usually get 2 oz+.. toppings are priced in groups and every single time you add something it adds to the cost. All other places in the area let you choose however many toppings you want for the same price. I know for a fact (I often buy breakfast there when they prepare the food for entire day) that other places have fresh toppings and of food quality, so I'm not buying the story of 'here it is fresh, the other guys have questionable quality.'The best thing? Ready? In the end they charge additional dollar for having it chopped. $1!!! For 5 seconds of chopping!! No thank you, I'd rather cut it with plastic knife for free. Never have I been charged for chopping the salad. Never.Unless these things change, go somewhere else.",,,
21,Christian G.,"Silver Spring, MD",56,208,54,4.0,1/19/2018,Went here the other day while in NYC. I was very happy that this place was open early on a Sunday because well I like to eat. They has a good selection of foods and I got an energy wrap. It was really good and just what I needed after eating every unhealthy item in sight the previous day. Price also was very reasonable for NYC. I tried a bagel and it was good but definitely not the best in NYC. With that being said you will be very happy going here on a Sunday morning seeking breakfast.,,,

24,Sophia B.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",431,222,188,4.0,5/12/2018,"This is my absolute favorite place to pick up breakfast before work when I feel like having a full on breakfast. Â They have a great variety of breakfast options, and I love getting their omelettes. Recently I've gone with their spinach and tomato omelette and skipped the cheese, which also comes with their great breakfast potatoes. This place isn't fancy, it's not going to be the best omelette you've had in your life, but it tastes like the BEST omelette you could make for yourself. And their breakfasts usually cost under $6, which means I'm here on more mornings than I'd like to admit. For lunch I've had some of their sandwiches which are solid, and they always have a crazy line so I know they're good...but what really shines is their breakfast menu for me.",2,,1
25,Michelle M.,"Dublin, OH",243,163,233,3.0,12/3/2017,"I ordered online for pickup because it was during the busy lunch hour, and it was a good idea too because when I arrived the place was absolutely packed. I didn't see a clear pick-up area, but since I was about 10 minutes early before my expected pickup time I waited around the front of the restaurant where everyone was waiting for their orders. When my pickup time arrived I managed to push my way to the register to ask about my order, and she actually told me that pickups were at the very back of the restaurant. Would've been good to know! My order was of course ready so I was able to grab it and head out. The sandwich was great - packed with a lot of food and the bread was excellent. Overall the food was pretty good but my pickup experience was a bit confusing.",1,,

Â Apparently not for this place.Even when it's breakfast rush hour, it should not take 15 minutes to make a simple breakfast sandwich as I had ordered. Â Not only that, but the sandwich wasn't even done right. Â No salt, no pepper, ketchup was given in packets instead of on the sandwich, and the bacon was disgustingly overcooked. Â And just to make things even better, the cashier I worked with was the laziest worker I've ever seen in my life. Â Stands to the side doing nothing, chewing gum and repeating ""it's not ready yet"" while the rest of the kitchen is busy.

34,melanie l.,"Union City, CA",133,158,540,4.0,1/12/2017,"(May 2016) This review is long overdue but I miss New York City so much and as I was going through my pictures I couldn't help to notice that I didn't leave this cute little place a review (so here I am 8 months later lol).This is such a good place to grab breakfast goodies. FYI Do not let the line push you away (it goes super fast I promise). My bf and I Came here on a busy Friday morning to catch a quick bite before our Â flight to Canada. We yelped a few places but this spot caught our attention, I mean come on 'Toasties' for a breakfast/sandwich place (it sounds so yummy and warm).Popeyes sandwich:My bf ordered this and seriously I wish I ordered the same sandwich. It had Grilled chicken breast with melted mozzarella cheese (should I go on...) lol with spinach, alfalfa sprouts, roasted red peppers, shredded red cabbage, romaine lettuce and honey mustard to bind the sandwich altogether. It sounds like a lot but it was delicious! All of the flavors combined to perfection at every bite. At first though my bf and I looked at each other about the red cabbage but it was not bad at all if anything it gave that extra crunch to the sandwich and it worked. Must try!!!! You won't regret it I promise lol.Breakfast Sandwich:After drinking and partying too hard the night before I wanted to grab an ultimate breakfast sandwich lol. I ordered an everything bagel with bacon, egg cream cheese and cheese. Nothing special about the sandwich it tasted like a bagel sandwich with exactly what I ordered. The egg was too over cooked for my liking but the bacon made up for it I guess. The grease and the melted cheese (oh man it was delicious). The minus star is for not having cream cheese in my bagel (I specifically ordered it with regular cream cheese inside) but there was none. When I went up to the counter to tell them they said cream cheese was extra and I honestly didn't mind paying for it cause I ordered it to begin with.. but they were super nice about it and they just gave it to me for free. I highly recommend this place (they have several locations) so check them out!! I will definitely come back for more (this time Popeyes sandwich I'm coming for you) lol.",1,1,1

Â When I went in I just had this feeling that all of it was unsanitary. Â Looking at how they make the salads, where they are preparing things it all just looked dirty to me. Â For some reason they didn't have the restaurant inspection information in the window at the time so I decided to do a little research online and I was horrified when I did. Â If you look over the past two years they have horrific health inspection ratings. Â I will say at the time I am writing this review they do have an ""A"" with only one major violation of: Â Filth flies or food/refuse/sewage-associated (FRSA) flies present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. Filth flies include house flies, little house flies, blow flies, bottle flies and flesh flies. Food/refuse/sewage-associated flies include fruit flies, drain flies and Phorid flies.However, if you look back even two months prior to this inspection on 6/8/17 when there as an ""ungraded inspection"" they had severe violations like:1) Hot food item not held at or above 140Âº F.2) Evidence of rats or live rats present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.Stay away from this place. Â For the longest time it had a ""B"" rating as well. Â It is very hard to get a ""B"" rating in New York. Â The worst part of these violations is most of them seem to be repeat violations or they get better for a little while then go right back to having problems.Aside from the sanitary issues, the service is horrific.

Though I may be editorializing a bit on the latter part of that statement, it was heavily implied and well deserved. Though it may look and feel like any of the normal cookie cutter deli's that populate midtown West, I have not yet found another deli that manages to make such a delicious chicken parmesan sandwich (an attribute I later discovered was due to the butter they covered the chicken with before parmigianing it). The tomato sauce was not just a normal parmesan topping, but had a unique taste to it, sweet and savory all at the same time.

We both got a Saturday Morning, but instead of a wrap we got it on a bagel. I love having that option for a nice bagel sandwich in the morning!It was pretty cheap since it was only about $6, but still filled me up for a quick meal. The homefries in the sandwich is such a good touch and completes the typical brunch flavors you get from the eggs, cheese, and bacon. The salsa they put on the side is actually really good too! It has a little spicy kick to it and pairs well with the taste of the eggs and fries.",1,,1

The omelette is huge and it uses fresh ingredients - I loved it. The only concern is that they had my order wrong - ham that I ordered wasn't in the omelette, but they put tomatoes and peppers that I didn't ask for. It was already past their busiest hours so it was strange that they got my order wrong.

I completely understand that they were now prepping for lunch and couldn't make me an omelet, but I just wish they were a bit more understanding and chill about it. Another issue I have with this place is that the tea and coffee were cold. They weren't ice-cold, obviously, but far too cold for coffee and tea. All that being said, the food was great. I ordered the Eat Your Greens Sandwich, and it was divine. It was wrapped well, put together neatly, and tasted amazing. (My mother kept complaining it had no cheese and how that was a deal breaker but I disagree). I'd definitely order it again. The prices were also very reasonable.I recommend this place for a quick bite on your way to work or as your lunch break, but it's not a great sit down place.",,,

Updated review","What a wonderful little breakfast spot. We were walking from times square to Rockefeller and needed to grab breakfast. Husband had a bagel with lox tomato and onion, a bagel with just cream cheese for my daughter. I had an omelette platter. All very reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. Great quality home-cooked tasting and good coffee. Will visit again when staying in this area.Made a 2nd stop here on our last day. Food again was delicious. One thing I didn't like- the iced cappuccino had too much milk. If you like mostly espresso ask them to do a double shot in the small cup.",1,,

I was, however, disappointed with how the potatoes were prepared. I wish it was more on the crunchy side like hash browns or potato tots but it wasn't. But it was good. To order, you basically stand in a line, order what you get and they'll give you a receipt, where you will then be on line until you reach the cashier to pay. The employee who I paid for my wrap was very friendly but the one who gave my order was rude, giving me the bag as if it had germs on it... I didn't like her attitude. Maybe I'll check other Toasties locations.",2,,1
77,Misha T.,"San Francisco, CA",642,4075,105,4.0,10/23/2016,Pretty standard NYC deli with pretty standard bacon/egg/cheese bagels.

Finding this was sort of a blessing, they have really great and filling egg wraps and everything's pretty customizable which I love. You order at the counter and go to the cashier to pay, and then wait for your # to be called out which helps speed up the process during the busy hours. There's also some grab + go options but the sandwiches take a short time to make in comparison to some other places in this area, they have their assembly line down really well!

81,Pinky C.,"New York, NY",524,482,1140,4.0,6/11/2015,"This is one of my favorite spots for lunch nowadays. Â The food there is cooked fresh and it always smells so good once you walk in. Â When you eat this food, it's almost like yo mama cooked it for you with homecooked love. Â I can't believe this gem is in this area -- not a lot of places make their food like this! Â I have had the roasted herb chicken and it's not overcooked or anything. Â The mashed potatoes are to die for and the gravy is real meaty flavored -- how it's SUPPOSED to be. Â If you eat stuff like boston market, forget that completely because this is what comfort food is. Â  Their brussel sprouts are also cooked well and seasoned just right. I also ordered their bbq chicken sandwich another time and it was also very tasty. Â The bbq worked really well with the other flavors. Â What I was disappointed with was the weird seamless order when I got the sandwich, they didn't add spinach when I clicked to add spinach to the order -- so I got charged extra cents. Â They're lucky the food was good!!! I am a cheap woman! haha.

Â I have heard stories from co-workers that they found caterpillars in their salad and there are still pictures of similar incidents that you can google.2) The Staff is HORRIBLE - unfriendly, rude and never get your order right.3) Non efficient process - it's remarkable how bad they are at coming up with a process that allows you to order, receive food and pay within a reasonable time frame.

86,Anthony K.,"Islip, NY",28,74,4,5.0,4/20/2017,This place gets absolutely mobbed for lunch.

You could probably try something different on the menu every day in a week and be completely satisfied they have roasted chicken The mac & cheese I tried it was delicious. Also had the chicken Parm on a wrap. Anytime I need something to eat i'll definitely try and make my way up here as long as I get lucky and they'll catch a long wait,,,

Â I'm not a fan of holes in my cheese, so I order my Reuben's with Cheddar. Â Besides, everyone must know by now that Cheddar makes it better.The sandwich is so good, it's annoying. Â Whenever I order it, I want to eat it for the next week, but that's a fat girl's thought process (sorry for generalizing fat girls). Â I have to say I was not as impressed with the hot bar, but that was because the mac & cheese was a bit soupy. Â I'm more of a baked mac & cheese chick, but that's my preference.

Best sandwiches I have had (Chicken Cobb ordered on a whole wheat wrap is delicious) and the price is not too bad. A sanwich will run between $7 and $9, depending on the bread. Ordering in a wrap or on a hero gets you a very big sandwich.Breakfast there is nice, they use H&H bagels and cook up custom egg sandwiches to order. They also sell tasty muffins all day including a banana chocolate chip muffin that is very good. Salad bar is very good, too but can get expensive especially if you elect to have your salad chopped (as I always do, begrudgingly handing over an extra dollar). But their sandwiches are what keep bringing me back.They have some very interesting sandwiches and the ingredients seem to always be fresh. They are also very accommodating to customizing their sandwiches which may not seem apparent due to their large and extensive menu of pre-selected ingredients.Pro Tip: Ask for a frequent diner card. They don't make an extra effort to tell you about it, but it gets you a free sandwich on your 10th visit.",1,,1

I was a first timer and didn't understand the ordering system, but thankfully it wasn't hard to figure out after going to the wrong station at first. Only downside, the coffee is terrible.

To fill you in - he called twice between 10:44 and 10:51, I was downstairs at 10:57 when I called back. Thanks for waiting for 3 minutes (I assume it was 3 or less since I waited outside for 10 for him to get back), it takes a little longer than that to go down 4 floors and then up a flight of stairs. To make matters worse I called the restaurant and was put on hold 3 times so of course I was upset, when the manager finally answered he started off yelling at me - the customer, who just had her food thrown at her by a rude undocumented delivery boy who could hardly speak english. By the ends of the conversation he had his attitude in check but by this point my mind was mad up that i would never have food from here again. I ordered a breakfast wrap with avocado and turkey bacon - received ham cheese and bacon instead.

It's called the ""Bird's View"" and it changed my life forever. Every bite of that wrap was a life-affirming moment I want to experience again and again. The wrap was massive in size, a borderline torpedo from WWII, so when it came to eight and a half dollars, it felt justified. The fact that this Toasties is located in midtown Manhattan cranks the price up too, unfortunately. The whole place runs smoothly. Every customer in there is a businessman or woman on lunch break, aka people know what they are doing aka are not tourists (I won't start on tourists in this review). Â Toasties has a huge sandwich/wrap menu (bread source is interchangeable for all items), as well as ""comfort food"" (lunch entrees) and create your own salad. I'm excited to try the salad, the toppings looked awesome. Someone mixes and it chops it with an awesome round knife (for a dollar extra), similar to Saladworks. I am excited to come back to Toasties, home of everything good.",4,6,6
173,Katie L.,"Central Valley, NY",130,6,0,4.0,6/22/2016,"Super good sandwiches. Place is always packed, but it's never too much of an issue for the good food. Service is quick minus line-time, and the food is always filling.",,,
174,Daman K.,"Queens, NY",11,28,2,4.0,3/16/2016,"So happy this place exists because its one of the few places that I actually like in the area. My absolute favorite sandwich and probably the only sandwich I'll ever order is the Palta. It's grilled chicken with guacamole, pico de gallo and lettuce. I skip the cheddar cheese and add some ranch and chipotle sauce. It's amazing and costs less than 10 bucks. I also recommend their breakfast options. They're good and reasonably priced. I usually make breakfast, however if I ever want eggs on a roll or a bagel, this is the only spot I come to. I have to say I'm not a fan of their salads. I once got a cajun chicken salad and the chicken was dry and overly salty. There's not too much space to sit, but if you come after the lunch hour rush, you can usually sit down and eat.",,,
175,Greg G.,"Alexandria, VA",20,240,18,3.0,1/8/2015,"I went to Toasties once for breakfast. Â I had an egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich on an onion bagel. Â My sandwich was OK, but it was light on eggs, the eggs (scrambled) were overlooked, and the bacon was just a bunch of broken up pieces. Â The bagel was fresh and toasted.",,,
176,Terry H.,"Chandler, AZ",3,77,1,3.0,2/23/2016,"Needed a quick place for a quick bite for breakfast & this was perfect. Â Not many choices that are not McDonalds, and this was fine. Â Would go back for a quick breakfast again!",,,
177,Alison P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,4.0,6/29/2016,I got an amazing veggie sandwich from this place during prime lunch hours! They still managed to stack 10 different veggies in a very clean manor..important! thanks guys ill be coming back,,,
178,Jennifer M.,"Yokosuka, Japan",14,16,3,5.0,2/18/2015,"While staying at the Crowne Plaza I was looking for a breakfast spot go avoid paying $30 for the standard hotel breakfast. I am so glad I did!! The selections are great, the service is fast, and the food is WONDERFUL!! Not to mention, I was able to get breakfast for 3 people for about $15! I will definitely put this on my list of favorites for the next time I'm in the city.",,,
179,Cassie P.,"Tampa, FL",261,493,308,4.0,12/10/2012,"Stopped in here while headed to Radio City Music Hall and was pleasantly surprised! Even though the place looked completely packed and kinda small- we decided to give it a try.Sandwiches are huge and well priced! And they were ready super fast. Â They were well organized and moved everyone through pretty quickly. Â Fresh salad bar, cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches and even a section for comfort food! Â Everything looked delicious.Would recommend this for a good lunch spot!",,,

182,Bobby B.,"East Bronx, NY",0,1,0,2.0,5/29/2016,"I'm just tired of lazy useless people. Curious mostly as to why a no energy, slow and just blah person (female) is allowed to answer the phones and take orders. This morning around 8:40am I called to place an order for pickup. The girl who answered spoke low and slow.....Zzzz I don't know if she said hold on or what but I apparently was finishing my order to dead air. After 90 seconds I hung up and called back. 7 attempts later here I am writing this. This is not the first second or third time something like this has happened but the food is good and majority of the workers are great.",,,
183,Terry C.,"Horseheads, NY",0,3,0,5.0,4/14/2016,There aren't enough stars! This place is possibly the best find I've ever found in NYC! Food AND coffee for 3-$20! Delicious,,,
184,Chris G.,"Spring, TX",5,9,10,4.0,1/6/2016,"Good, fast, and cheap. This place actually is all three. You need to be ready when it's your turn to order, and they won't ask you if you want anything you don't ask for right away (including drinks), but that means they handle the lunch rush beautifully. There's minimal seating, but they wrap the sandwiches well, so they'll stay warm (provided they start that way) until you get where you're going. I also appreciated the hefty portions.",,,
185,Lyla D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2,47,1,5.0,1/30/2016,"First off, there is seating! And enough of it! Food was great, hot and made to order. Service was also great. I had the omelette platter, the french toast, and a wrap but i forgot what it was called. Portions were great as were the prices! Definitely pay this place a visit dudes and dudettes.",,,
186,Geoffrey B.,"New London, CT",4,2,0,5.0,4/21/2016,Had bagel breakfast sandwiches and the Saturday morning wrap. All were great and at a reasonable price. Will definitely come back.,,,
187,Jacky Y.,"New York, NY",2,2,2,5.0,1/20/2016,"Offers online orders for takeout delivery on Yelp and dine-in. The dine-in is not that big, but has a couple of tables. It's almost always packed for breakfast and lunch. Luckily, I ordered via Yelp, a bacon and egg with ketchup and hot-sauce. It's completely customizable down to the last drop of sauce and includes all prices for any additions. The order system via Eat24(?) is simple and efficient and you can grab lunch rq without any hassle. Had it a couple of times with absolutely no problem. The sandwich had a few, good pieces of bacon and a great portion of egg - standard, but quite satisfactory. I'm super satisfied with the quick and reliable service and the filling sandwich!",,,
188,Stevie C.,"Manhattan, NY",343,42,1,5.0,10/27/2014,"I wanted to try this place for so long and I finally had the chance. Scrumptious sandwiches, perfect size, and a huge menu for any taste.The line/ordering process can be a little confusing during the busy midtown lunch rush.",,,
189,Keval S.,"New York, NY",38,57,6,3.0,12/4/2015,Sandwich was whatever. Good options but tasted too bland for my liking.,,,
190,Alex N.,"New York, NY",1,19,2,2.0,12/16/2015,"Good luck getting any customer service here. Lost my sandwich. Stood waiting for 15 minutes for a barely decent meal. No apology, nothing. As if to add insult to injury, the rudest of a few women behind the counter had the audacity to exclaim 'you're welcome' once I finally received my order.",,,
191,Amari B.,"Mammoth Lakes, CA",0,10,2,4.0,1/13/2017,"Ran here for breakfast one morning and was totally satisfied! Such a good breakfast bagel, it was a great size and very filling. Great way to start off your day! Â price wasn't too bad either",,,

194,Matt W.,"Birmingham, AL",103,2,0,5.0,12/5/2015,Service was terrific! Breakfast was even better. Definitely our go to when in the city!,,,
195,Colin M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,37,4,3.0,1/4/2016,"Nice spot, Â decent food, friendliness is ok but not worrying as you are usually only passing through.Worth a visit but note - don't bother with their ""loyalty card"" that gets you a ""free"" meal. You have to buy 10 to get 1 free yet eat meal has to be almost $8 and can't be combined with water or whatever else your buying. This is a cheap shot which put me off as you can only get a sandwich for your free meal so your more than covering the cost really. Aside from that, decent spot in town.",,,
196,Nicole V.,"Palm Harbor, FL",110,21,8,5.0,8/18/2015,Great little place for breakfast! And very inexpensive for the area! Will be back next time I'm in town and try lunch!,,,
197,Betty T.,"Orlando, FL",10,38,15,3.0,9/20/2015,"I was not impressed with the bagel at all. Â It was small and way too toasted. Â I had Best Bagel yesterday and this didn't even compare. Â The breakfast platter was good, but not outstanding. The orange juice was good. Â They have cups of it by the register. Skip the Tropicana in the cooler. The menu is reasonably priced and they have unique wrap options. I would just not recommend this place if you want a good bagel. The coffee was so so. Â If you want a good bagel look up Best Bagel. Â You won't be disappointed.",,,
198,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,20,29,1.0,11/1/2013,"I just ordered a breakfast on seamless. (A few bagels cream cheese, tomato, etc). After over an hour I called to ask where it was. They claimed they came and gave it to me. I said they didn't and then went to look at the door and it was just hanging on my door knob. When I called back to ask if they were sure they handed it to me they said they were. On top of everything, my bagel came in pieces. I had to cut the bagel, spread the cream cheese, and put all of the extra side toppings on. They didn't even offer a decent apology. Just kept telling me I was wrong and that it got delivered. Terrible customer service.",1,1,
199,Leah D.,"Saugus, MA",5,5,4,4.0,7/12/2014,"Here in a New York for the weekend and we went to Toasties for breakfast. The line was quick, food came out quick and delicious. We got the Saturday Morning Wraps, and we also got iced cappuccino. The wraps were great, but the coffee was just ok. The coffee cost as much as the wrap, so next time I would probably skip the coffee. Overall great place!",,,
