Updated review","I love this place, I really do... but you have to be careful and keep an eye on how they're cooking things sometimes. Every once in awhile depending on who's in the kitchen, I'll get chicken that tastes like charcoal or like it's just been cooked on top of other burnt items. It sucks cause I'm a huge fan and have been eating at this spot for years but over the last year it's been a bit dicey. I only get delivered as well as the new location isn't the most aesthetically pleasing spot to sit down and have a meal Update: 10 trips to muscle maker since last review, 9 times burnt chicken...",,,
1,Alexandre F.,"Mount Hope, KS",35,3,0.0,1.0,10/14/2018,"I was very disappointed and disgusted by this place. First they don't say hi when you come in, then they give you plates with residue from the previous persons meal, then they didnt have any clean forks and knife and gave me some in plastic. And to top it all, the food was really not good.Dont go there.",,,
2,Rob A.,"New York, NY",687,118,607,2.0,7/4/2018,"I'm a big fan of a healthy fast food chain so I've been wanting to try muscle maker grill for a while.  Came here the other night for dinner and was a bit impressed by their healthy menu options.  When I first walked in I realized it was one of those places where people order out more than a sit-down location.  Don't get me wrong, they do have a good amount of seating for people to eat their food but it's not the nicest looking restaurant and was pretty empty when I came.  The service was friendly once I got someone's attention which took a minute since they seemed real busy with delivery orders and the phone.  Decided to go with their XXL turkey burger wrap which comes with one side (I went with the vegetable medley).  Since I saw XXL, I was expecting a huge wrap, but I was sadly disappointed.  The wrap is alright but nothing to brag about and size of the wrap is where the disappointment came in.  I wasn't even impressed by the portion of veggies I got for a side.  For $10 plus I guess I was expecting something a little bit more worth my dollar.  Despite me being disappointed by my wrap, I still like that there's a healthier option for people in the Chelsea area.  I'd maybe come back here to give one of their other options off the menu a try, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to do.",3,1,1
3,Christopher G.,"Los Angeles, CA",390,1,0,1.0,11/8/2018,"Food was average, however while I was eating the manager for some reason thought it was ok to totally cuss out his employee right in front of me. Terrible way to enjoy a dinner, would not recommend dining in here.",,,
4,Jariel L.,"Bronx, NY",0,12,3,1.0,8/2/2018,I went to this place again today and i notice that when i order the TURKEY CHILI Entree bowl THEY added yellow rice and it was hard ! the menu says brown rice !  i also order kale & quinoa wrap and instead of putting it in wheat wrap like the menu also says they gave me the white wrap i am very disappointed wraps are good but they dont follow the menu,1,,
5,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,4.0,8/10/2017,"I've been to two other locations of Muscle Maker Grill (the one on 104th St and the one in the Bronx). This location is more similar to the one in the Bronx in terms of how they do their menu, but I've learnt that no two locations of Muscle Maker Grill are exactly the same.The staff here is incredibly friendly. One man working here in particular stood out and recognized us about a week later when we saw him outside of another Muscle Maker.The veggie wrap here was great, as was the steamed spinach. I stole some sweet potato fries from the person with me and they tasted good as well. The atmosphere is as casual on the inside as the other locations but has a courtyard on the outside that adds something to the experience.I'd definitely recommend this place for a healthy meal!",1,2,1
6,D J.,"New York, NY",1,73,2,5.0,6/28/2018,"Food was solid.  Just watching this place on under-cover boss, been here a few times.  It is healthy, don't expect super-creamy sauces, etc., but fresh meat and veggies not frozen and healthy, it has hit the mark -- thus far.",1,,
7,Michael B.,"Park Hill, Yonkers, NY",23,7,2,4.0,9/17/2018,You can either choose it to go or stay in and be served your food. The low prices are great for the area and you get a free side with the wraps. Definitely worth it for those who want more protein in take and a full meal at a cheap price.,,,
8,Nicole V.,"Staten Island, NY",1012,130,297,5.0,9/26/2017,"On a diet so coming across this place was a lifesaver. I had the taco salad, my father had the chicken Caesar salad, and my friend had the cheeseburger salad. All three were delicious and fresh. This place has an outdoor area and I highly recommend for those in the area.",2,1,1
9,Sara F.,"Phelan, CA",0,42,7,5.0,8/22/2017,"So stoked to find this place on my work trip. For somebody who eats clean and simple it's sometimes hard to find something delicious, quick and easy in pizza filled New York. But this place really hit the spot. Definitely bookmarking for future trips to NYC. The godfather is great!",3,,
10,Wolfee W.,"Edgewater, NJ",23,24,0,2.0,8/15/2017,"Its ok. not the greatest and the Special low fat sauce they use is not really all so special and low fat as they say. Basically its a thousand island dressing,So yeah the chicken is rubbery and my wrap smelled like feet which was really weird. I think next time I will just go else where",1,1,
11,Kirk S.,"Washington, DC",226,748,24,4.0,12/12/2016,"This place is like my dream sort of restaurant, but unfortunately it misses the mark in a few key areas.Muscle Maker Grill is basically the best idea ever: super healthy food done quickly.  Think grilled chicken with spices, brown rice, carb-free entrees, tons of veggies, and no junk food whatsoever!  It's what I've wanted for years, and I couldn't check this place out faster.Problem is, Muscle Maker Grill's food is only just okay.  The Terikyaki Stir-Fry was okay, but the light sauce lacked the kind of punch it needed to really take the dish to the next level.  It's good to lightly sauce an entree - hell, it's healthier - but it should never be done to the point where taste is compromised!  The Honey BBQ Nuggets (lightly sauced chicken nuggets that are grilled, not fried) were equally kinda meh - the chunks were far too big and dry, meaning that the sauce:nugget ratio was a bit off.  Had they simply cut the chicken thinner, it'd have made a world of difference!All in all, I love the idea of this place, and wish it the best of luck - they should just avoid sacrificing taste for health!",4,,3
12,Alex B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",45,79,0,2.0,9/24/2017,"I was here about a month ago, so this is an overdue review. I was in the Chelsea area and stopped in.I had a burger calle d the premium burger. Nothing premium about this, folks. It was over cooked and dry. The bun was grilled to death and hard. The side order of pasta salad and the little tray it came in made me feel like I was in grade school. My friend had a chicken dish that she said was not good either. The staff was very friendly, but I would pass on muscle maker grill",,,
13,Laurie W.,"New York, NY",310,484,603,5.0,6/30/2015,"After a gym session, you really don't want to eat something fatty and gross and honestly, I was way too pooped to cook anything (my class ended  at 9 and I work at 7am in the morning, do you see my dilemma?!) After some searching around on Seamless, I found this gem and I thought to myself, why not? If it's bad, then I'll never come back. Looking through my options, I opted for the 32oz chocolate shake (with 44g of protein!! And its huge!) and the Rocky Balboa wrap (how irony).  I picked up my order around 9pm and they made my shake on the spot and not premade or had been sitting on the counter waiting for me to show up. The chocolate shake - its more frothy than I would have liked it to be, like it tasted like....chocolate foam.  Even though its 32 oz and I'm walking around Manhattan with this big cup of chocolate protein shake (and I'm 5'1!!?!?!), it didn't feel like 32oz of drink.  The shake wasn't bad though, a bit chalky but not nasty.  I probably would skip it for the next time, better off with my chocolate protein drink from work. The wrap - this wrap is the grilled chicken with meatball and cheese.  IT IS FREAKING DELICIOUS!!! Like I thought it would taste like crap ( all healthy places generally are).  I am not saying THIS IS THE MOST HEALTHIEST THING I COULD HAVE EATEN, but my god, it is good..I'm hungry for it again.  The meatball has a very mushy texture, not the traditional crumbly texture but it was flavorful.  I found myself scooping the meatball to eat alone.  The chicken took most of the cheese with it but it was a bit dry but nonetheless, well seasoned.  All this goodness wrapped in one for me to eat...what more can I say! Also, I got a side of steamed broccoli...and with broccoli..there's not much you can say about steamed broccoli...like the aroma of steamed broccoli? Yea no.... Not too bad on the pricing and I feel full with half of the shake and the full wrap and broccoli...but I'm a big eater.",4,2,1
14,Akhila R.,"New York, NY",788,141,240,1.0,5/13/2017,"Ordered a chicken dish from here once, never again. The food just doesn't taste good. I tried to bear through and eat it since I didn't want to waste food, but I couldn't do it. The food is so bland and tastes old, and I got a stomach pain from eating it. Definitely not eating here again.",,,
15,Samantha W.,"New York, NY",269,246,133,2.0,11/6/2017,"Came in here over the weekend to pick up an order I had called in earlier. As I've been to two other locations and both times the food was pretty good, I expected similar in terms of what I would be getting at this location. I had the Godfather bowl and granted, I microwaved it today for lunch instead and my goodness, it was VERY VERY dry. Yes, I know microwaving it could have been a cause for how dry it was. BUT I did the same thing for the yelp elite event I attended in Gramercy and it was totally fine and still appetizing the next day. I was also charged  $13.40 total and that took me by surprise a bit because I don't remember it being that much at other locations unless I'm totally mistaken. I looked up the menu photos on other pages and it says $10.99 so I guess the differential was tax, but still. The rest of the bowl was good with the sauce, broccoli, etc. Could have had more mushrooms though.",,,
16,Royce W.,"Clinton Hill, NY",2073,131,131,5.0,3/5/2016,"Love this place when I'm in Chelsea.  Plenty of options, obviously healthier then your average restaurant. Priced pretty fairly. The meal I got with a drink is about 15.00.  They have plenty of employees and always give you quick service.  I have q couple of things here.  They off vegetables as sides and cook them well unlike other places that act like a side is just a garnish.  Couple of TVs there too. I had the El Mexicana I think, it was that or the Arizona, either way I'm not a racist.  They're very similar. I have a picture up, but delicious grilled chicken with rice and beans and salsa and cheese.  Not the healthiest thing you can get there, but wasn't bad at all.",1,,1
17,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",731,1659,151,3.0,1/31/2016,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat around 10pm on a Friday night. There weren't too many others there since it was so late so we were able to order right away and find a seat inside.After perusing the Yelp page, we decided to split an order of the chicken tenders and I ordered the rocky balboa wrap.The chicken tenders, which we got with teriyaki sauce, were tasty, but the chicken itself was overcooked and a bit dry.The rocky balboa wrap was pretty huge and stuffed with meat, but it lacked a lot in the flavor department. I would have loved to have some sort of spicy sauce with it, but I just made due with how it was prepared.Overall, the service here is friendly and the food comes out pretty quickly. Everything is marketed as super healthy, but I feel like it comes at a cost of flavor.",1,,
18,Izabela R.,"Long Beach, NY",5,7,4,1.0,10/15/2015,"I used to love this place. It's been a long time since I ordered from them, because it's so much easier on seamless and they're not part of it. But just ordered my usual Tucson  and a shake and it came in the tiniest container. I could never finish it in one meal before; and now it's the size of an appetizer. I mean for $15 it's not even close to worth it unless you get 2 dishes which would add up to 30 ish. Might as well done out.",1,1,
19,G O.,"Lawrenceville, GA",0,24,115,5.0,11/8/2015,"First of all, the food is really good!  I ordered the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken Stir-Fry and it was great. The staff is also very friendly.

20,Daniel D.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",21,44,11,1.0,3/26/2017,"Just came in to eat. My boyfriend was looking at the menu at the counter and I used the bathroom. Upon returning to ask the boyfriend what he wanted to order, the employee at the counter immediately told me I had to buy a $3.25 beverage for using the bathroom as they're only for patrons. Hello? We were there to be patrons. I bought the water and left.  Will never be a patron now.",2,2,
21,Ethan L.,"New York, NY",181,1,0,1.0,6/26/2017,"My order NEVER got delivered to me!!! After waiting 90 minutes for an order that was estimated to be delivered in 40-50 minutes, I called the restaurant for an update and I was told that my food was on its way and it should be arriving shortly. So I waited for another hour. Then, 2.5 hours after I had initially placed my order, I called the restaurant again, but no one answered the phone even though the restaurant was still listed as open for business! I called back periodically for the next 30 minutes that the restaurant was open, but no one answered. My food never came. I ended up walking around at 11pm to find something to eat, 3 hours after I placed my order at Muscle Maker. It was probably the worst experience I've ever had ordering food for delivery in my entire lifetime.",,,
22,Adham A.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,7/4/2017,"I'm not sure if they had a change in management or anything, but this place went from good to bad. The shake was literally flavored water with crushed ice and the food tasted old. I'm really not sure what's going on with regards to delivery, but my GF said they were an hour late to deliver her food. She also said the food tasted old. Someone needs to send health inspectors over there",,,
23,Christian A.,"Brooklyn, NY",672,199,205,3.0,6/22/2016,I stumbled on to this place after an exhausting workout and the name of the place Muscle Maker Grill drew me in. They have a very diverse menu of healthy and tasty looking meals. On my first visit I had the Low Carb Caesar Wrap with chicken (steak is another option). Every wrap comes with a free side and I opted for the cucumber salad. The wrap was very tasty and I enjoyed the cucumber salad as well. I'll be back to try some of the other delights I saw that captured my eye.,1,,
24,Jean S.,"New York, NY",2,16,0,4.0,4/10/2017,"I come hear often after working out and I've never been disappointed. The food is healthy, tasty,  and simply made. The service is prompt and friendly. I'd definitely recommend this place to someone looking for yummy, healthy meals.",,,
25,Krista P.,"Orlando, FL",19,3,0,1.0,5/30/2017,"I went in hoping to get a nice protien shake. I can't have dairy and have had MANY different kinds of shakes and flavors. I can honestly say this shake was aweful. They just put a powder mix in with water. I spent almost $20 there on 2 snacks, a shake and a water and everything was subpar. I wasn't able to eat there Foo but the skies were not good at all.",,,
26,Adam S.,"New York, NY",1542,292,2047,4.0,1/25/2015,"Muscle Maker Grill is a healthy faster food chain - and quite honestly I have a few options here I love and that are mainstays in my book.  The Chelsea location used to be located on 8th ave before it was washed away by Hurricane Sandy and the shoddy construction of the building in which they rented space.  Opening up only a few blocks away and practically a year later, they have a fresh, new location, and is doing very well.My favorite foods: The turkey meatballs - Sooo good.  I usually get them in the...Rocky Balboa wrap - no words, a must try.I also recently tried a special wrap - the ""Holy Guacamole Wrap"" with tilapia, rice and beans, salsa and guacamole.  Also great.They have many many sides to choose from, including sautéed spinach, steamed broccoli or cucumber salad - or even an ""upgraded"" side of the guacamole and yep, those turkey meatballs.  I kind of stick to what I like here, but there are many many good dishes to try.  Keep in mind - ""healthy"" food doesn't always means low-calorie as there are many guys and girls out there are looking to gain weight/muscle and need their various foods to reach their goals.  That said, unless you're trying to impress your date with a quick fast food eatery serving healthy-oriented food in a bright red interior, this is not a date type of place.  This is an after-workout or just an I'm relaxing-at-home-and-don't-want-to-cook-so-let-me-get-something-quick-that's-healthy kind of place.",3,,
27,Shea O.,"New York, NY",0,14,0,5.0,2/21/2017,Very impressed with the steak-had it with the GodFather and it was delicious.

I went in on a late afternoon on a Friday. Very friendly guy took my order. I went with the Arizona, which despite having rice, bacon, and chicken, topped out at under 600 calories.

29,Andrew W.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,3.0,4/1/2017,"Healthy food done quickly - love the idea!  The food is decent (the signature sauce is yummy), nutritional information is clear, and generally good value for money.The new location is larger and a nicer space but a pet peeve is in the winter where there is someone coming through the patio door every two minutes.  I generally don't stay long to eat but the cold gusts of air are annoying and I'd certainly never dine socially here.  Should I have to wear a coat to eat indoors?",,,
30,Jaime G.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,42,6,2.0,8/15/2016,"Two stars for food only. For a restaurant that seems to do so much of its business from online deliveries, Muscle Maker Grill needs to step its game up. I placed a few **future** orders in the morning for lunch time delivery, specifying that it should be delivered at 12:00 PM (some for 12:30 PM). Each and every time, Muscle Makers confirms my order seemingly as soon as it opens, and then prepares and delivers my food as if I placed a normal order, completely disregarding the bold, red, and capitalized font on the seamless receipt instructing delivery for 12:00 PM. It arrives consistently at 11:00 AM am then forced to choose between a cold lunch or a warm second breakfast. I will say that the two intended-lunches-turned-second-breakfasts I have had were quite good, but this is starting to become a deal-breaker - would rather order from a place that can follow simple directions.",,,
31,David C.,"New York, NY",243,13,14,3.0,2/16/2016,This is not worth $30. I ordered extra steak and I got more lettuce than steak. Pretty disappointed but still tastes good.,1,,
32,Andy R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,33,8,2.0,1/28/2017,"The food might be decent, depending on what you get here, but the operation is run unprofessionally. The owner closes this place down whenever he feels like it. If you're coming anywhere within the last hour of the ""advertised closing time"" then you might as well save your effort and head somewhere else. They start wiping down and cleaning way before closing time, and in the last 30 minutes they won't even let you inside. Beware that the operating hours posted on the door are false.",,,
33,Amy P.,"Manhattan, NY",44,19,0,1.0,4/10/2016,"We ordered delivery and it was terrible service. They didn't bring a drink we ordered, spilled a milkshake and made nachos with meatballs instead of chili. We called and they were apologetic and offered to resend the shake and drink. (At this point we hadn't opened to realize the nachos were made incorrectly.) after not getting things redelivered in an hour and a half we called back and the person said that we would get a refund. Before I could confirm what would be refunded he hung up. I called seamless and the manager lied and said that the delivery driver confirmed the shake had not spilled...the shake was in a stabled paper bag inside of a tied plastic bag. How could the driver have possibly confirmed this? And the shake was half gone with a broken lid. To add insult to injury, the food we did get was mediocre. The meatballs in the wrap were more breadcrumbs than anything.",,,
34,Bernardo G.,"Bronx, NY",6,6,0,1.0,12/19/2016,"Went here with my girlfriend after a light hearted evening of looking at pets to adopt. Big mistake...The owner I assume,  a middle eastern man in his late 30's with a receding hairline was SCREAMING over the phone. Once he had his fill with that,  he started screaming at the top of his lungs at one of his employees over a minor issue. The rest of the staff including a teenage girl appeared visibly shaken.Our awkward dinner was interrupted repeatedly by this maniacs' shrieks. We both ignored his cheery ""have a good night, folks"" on our way out. Unbelievable. If the owner reads this, get professional help/lay off the powder, jerk. DON'T COME HERE!!",,,

39,Alex O.,"Queens, NY",113,216,22,2.0,1/29/2015,"*TDLR: This place serves high school cafeteria junk. If you want quality, don't eat here!* I should have done my research, but my yearning for a new place to order took over. As a result, I paid dearly (and for utter crap too). First off, I ordered at around 9pm and the food arrived at the tail end of their estimation 30-45 min. This is fine by me, I just typically expect an expedited timing if I tip well (tipped ~12%). When the food arrived, everything was neatly packaged and in one bag - perfect. Felt warm, good. Made sure everything was there that I ordered which it was. I ordered Nuggets, Loaded Baked Potato, Premium Burger, Penne & Reduced-Fat Vodka Sauce with Chicken, Muscle Brownie, & a USDA Steak. My first impression was, ""Wow, I just paid a whole lotta money for a whole lotta nothing."" The portions were despicable! I have posted photos I took shortly after taking the items out of the bag for reference. I think when anyone thinks of a chicken nugget, they instantly think of the style that McDonald's ones look like, crispy and rugged oval shaped. Not to say this is the ""right"" way to prepare nuggets, but they were nothing like this. To me, they were more of an excuse for a nugget than the McDonald's ones and were just cubes of chicken doused in some horrible ""Texan"" sauce. Gross! I bit one and could not continue. Onto the potato, it was this sad thing with cheese and broccoli crammed messily in the middle. Also very unappetizing. On the flip side, the penne pasta was OK, but really close to microwave dinner quality at best. The chicken they used in the pasta were nearly exactly the same as the nuggets which was even more pathetic. The absolute atrocity of the whole order was by far the burger. It was a limp, slapped together soggy piece of junk that barely looked like a burger. It tasted how it looked - bad. The only decent part of the meal (perhaps because I'm a red meat fanatic) was the steak. I envisioned in my mind a small slab of steak, but instead received 5-6 shavings of steak paired with a few lettuce stems. Again, massive disappointment. Finally, was the brownie. I thought before ordering that this too would be something resembling a brownie (fluffy, warm, and square). Nope, this was a pre-packaged brownie that tasted like absolute crap. It was harder than a rock and barely chewable. To end my rant, overall the whole order was disgusting and terrible quality. I'll admit that sure, I maybe should have done my homework in regards to what kind of place it was, but put my faith in the ratings/reviews which seemed promising. For all those who are in search for a good quality meal, pass up on this place! Keep looking because I have had much better food for about the same price ($60).",2,1,

46,A M.,"Manhattan, NY",4,71,1,5.0,6/3/2015,This location always has quick delivery. I work in the neighborhood so it's convenient. But I live near the Midtown East location and they always take an hour or more.,1,,1
47,Dane M.,"New York, NY",280,85,57,4.0,3/23/2014,Pretty consistent healthy food option in the neighborhood. I order from here a few times a week when I get in late from the gym. It definitely gives the body what it needs after a good workout. The shakes are really good too!Food: Great healthy optionsService: Delivery is usually super fastAtmosphere: I haven't visited the actual location.,,,
48,Raymond D.,"New York, NY",0,8,1,5.0,8/5/2016,I eat here often and they don't disappointment. Healthy food for a good price! Definitely recommend.,,,
49,Sevon B.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,31,51,3.0,2/9/2015,"Okay so I thought I would try out this place being that I've received mixed reviews. I tried their vegetarian garlic and herb wrap  with tomato onion peppers and low fat cheese; without mushrooms. It came with a free side of broccoli. Let's just say I have had way better vegetarian wraps. The service was more a 2 1/2 out of 5 since the man behind the counter was distracted on a phone call, taking care of me wasn't first priority. Price okay I payed 8.50 but again I don't think it was worth it. Flavor of the wrap did not thrill my taste buds. Maybe I would try something else but not likely",1,,
50,Mike T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,3/11/2016,"the most DISGUSTING MEAL IVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have been to other MMG's but this one is the worst ive ever seen. I ordered a chicken teriyaki stir fry and it came out in literally 2 seconds, COLD.... I'm not sure how long this establishment is going to be here but it is PATHETIC.",1,,
51,C C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,27,1,4.0,4/14/2015,"Muscle Maker is a go-to, but only if you are literally ""going to"", as their delivery service is sub-par! Recommended dish is the Arizona - can't be beat! Next time you're in the area and looking for a protein heavy/healthy meal, grab a bite!",,,
52,Mustafa M.,"New York, NY",286,30,15,5.0,1/25/2016,Great food I always order in and let me just say the food always comes in early and on point love it all. And If you happen to go in you will love the owners who actually serve you very very nice picked the right place for a healthy place and a great service.,,,
53,Louis R.,"New York, NY",1,28,1,5.0,6/21/2014,"CALORIE CONTENT IS LISTED FOR EVERY PIECE OF FOOD THEY HAVE!!! In terms of the review saying no calorie content mentioned, I would suggest reading their menu.This is the best place to get food at in NY. I used to eat at the one on 8th ave until Sandy destroyed it.Just walk in and see. Rudy treats every customer better than he treats himself. One woman's food was taking a little longer to make, and her tablemates got their food first. He didn't want her to be without food while her friends ate, so he decided to give her a free side. The free side the employee made had meat in it, but he had heard her mentioning(WHILE HE WAS PREPARING FOUR ORDERS AND DEALING WITH OTHER CUSTOMERS) that she was a vegetarian. This was mentioned to her friend, not even to Rudy(the manager). He changed the free side that the employee had given her.You don't get attention like this when you spend $75 on a meal, and he is giving this level of attention to people who are spending nine bucks. That is what makes this place special - the people working there are beyond amazing. It's run like a place that cares about the people coming in, and the food is the best. Signature wrap with a salad is my favorite, and the turkey meatballs & tuscany meatball soup is the best.My work is on 1st Ave and 12th, I routinely walk here after I close, past every place to eat in the east village, at the end of my work day, for my meal. It is worth it.",,,
54,Josh S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0,5.0,9/9/2015,"Let me set the scene. It's 10:52pm. I'm leaving SVA and rushing home to Park Slope, where all our food options have closed. My girlfriend is annoyed at me for staying way late at the studio, yet again. There's a downtown 2 train arriving in 7 minutes, the next one another 13 minutes out. My iPhone battery is at 2%. Oh, and, further limiting our options, my girlfriend is GF & dairy-free. As I'm hustling to make the train, I pass Muscle Maker Grill for the thousandth time, but this time something is different. I walk in. GF options clearly defined on the menu! And, when I inquire about dairy-free options, the man behind the counter goes to great lengths to figure out whether the marinade will work for me! (It does.) Keep in mind that the place is about to close. Anyway, I order my grilled chicken entrees. My phone dies. Somehow, the order is ready lightning-fast. I bolt out the door and literally run to 14th St., catching my 2 train just as it rolls into the station. My girlfriend is thrilled. The chicken is delicious.",,,
55,Rose O.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,10/31/2015,"bad experience every time.  come at least 40 mins later than promised, order is always wrong. even had a time when they never showed up. called them back and got attitude from the woman take-out cashier- still never received a re-order. absolutely not worth your time.",,,
56,Frank N.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,1.0,8/18/2014,I placed an order through seamless almost two hours ago. Seamless estimate waa 30-45 minutes. Who knows when it will get here but nothing is worth that wait. Their explanation was basically that theyre busy.,,,
57,Priscilla C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,5,0,3.0,4/13/2014,"i'd like to give them a better review BUT they are one of the very few restaurants that show up for ""lo-cal"" BUT they don't bother to list the calorie content which makes me suspect...the meal i received seemed very ""rich"" and YET the portion was ridiculously small SO what's the deal muscle maker? gave three to give benefit of the doubt BUT will wait to see what they do...probably nothing as people in search of lo-cal take-out are suckers (me)..OR rather..want to believe...AMEN",,,
