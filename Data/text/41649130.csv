0,Yessenia R.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",4,29,83,5.0,11/11/2018,This place is amazing. I'll admit it's pricey but the food was great. Bacon is usually undercooked or over cooked in most places but the bacon here was great! Home fries amazing! Waffles great! Coffee great! Mimosas great! Grilled chicken great! I will admit it's a super busy and loud place. I did see families there but it was def packed for Saturday brunch. Our waiter was great and never left my cup of coffee unfilled. This is probably one of my new fave places!,,,

2,Laurie Y.,"Honolulu, HI",20,200,629,5.0,11/8/2018,"The Smith is very convenient if you are in the Lincoln Center neighborhood.  My daughter goes to Fordhman University at Lincoln Center so this is her ""go to"" place if she is taking someone out for brunch!Very nice and bustling place!  Lots of good energy!So my daughter ordered the Eggs Benedict ($16) and it was delicious! The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was excellent, not too rich!I had the French Toast ($17) made with Brioche bread!  OMG, the crust was crunchy and the inside of the bread was so soft and buttery!  It was the best!  Served with cinnamon bananas!Her girlfriend go the Ranchero with Scrambled Eggs ($16) which she couldn't finish!  We were all happy and satisfied!  Will be back again for that French Toast!  If there is 2 of you, order the Eggs Benedict and you can share!  We did!  Such a complete satisfying meal!Remember to make a reservation so you don't have to wait as it is a popular place!",,,
3,Derick D.,"Plantation, FL",204,210,1256,3.0,10/23/2018,"I've been here twice now and both times have just been alright. Both times were for brunch. Service is slow. We had a simple menu modification that they wouldn't cater to. However, they did cater to another modification, but it ended up being wrong when we received the meal. Tables are rather close to each other, especially the tables accommodating parties of two. The food is good. I had the Short Rib Benedict and the Lobster Roll. Both had really good flavor and were presented nicely. I've definitely had better lobster rolls. The homemade chips accompanying the lobster roll were really good. The ambiance is great and there is plenty of seating indoors and outdoors.",1,,1
4,G R.,"Chicago, IL",218,860,1159,3.0,11/7/2018,"A solid A-OK, upon walking in I got the sense of ambivalence, and the reply of back, ""just one?"" I said, yes one, leaving out the just. It took awhile for my server to get to my table, maybe a good ten minutes without any acknowledgment, perhaps he was on break or they didn't tell him they sat his section. Personable enough, since I knew what I wanted upon recommendations there wasn't much chatter. I order the Mac & Cheese as planned, very good and large, I couldn't finish it all. A few people around me had burgers that looked good, huge portions of fries. I'd go back here with a friend if I had a M&C craving, and get a salad to go with it. But overall, it was a largely lackluster experience, I wasn't asked if I wanted a warm up on my coffee, or if I wanted dessert, or anything. Walking out there was no thank you or have a nice day.Lackluster, I guess they feel they don't have to try.",16,6,11
5,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,5.0,9/5/2018,"The Smith always takes my breath away, be it through customer service, ambiance, or food. If you're coming on a Saturday night, be sure to make a reservation, and you'll be seated immediately. Got a corner table, which was just the best experience. Our waitress was such a sweetheart, chatted us up, genuinely asked us what we thought of the meal, brought us everything on time, and never delayed on checking on us, taking our order, or bringing the bill. Don't remember her name, but she looked just like Amy Adams. Food didn't disappoint at all. I got the lobster salad; every bite was unreal and worth every penny. The lobster was plentiful and cooked so well. The actual salad was so diverse in ingredients, and so flavorful and fresh. It was one of my favorite salads ever. Friend got the salmon, which was cooked so well. The salad it came with was citrusy, which was refreshing. Dessert - got the sticky toffee pudding. It's hot, has got a lot of caramel on it, and has plain ice cream on top. Comes in a little skillet, and is the perfect way to wrap up a gorgeous meal. Ideal for just about any occasion, including an impressive date, a catch-up dinner with close friends, or a nice family meal, The Smith is a place you just can't go wrong with.",3,1,3
6,Alix A.,"Leawood, KS",3,61,46,4.0,10/30/2018,"I went here before a show at Lincoln Center last week. I made reservations just to be safe, even though it was just me. I like that they gave you bubble water and flat at the table. I was on vacation so I went crazy and got myself an appetizer and an entree. For appetizer, I got the calamari. It was very well-cooked and crispy, but it was really bland, even with the tomato sauce. Once I added salt, which I rarely do, it was better. It was the reason I gave 4 stars. I would give all the stars to the sea bass I had. It was pan fried with crispy skin, brussels sprouts, leeks, and spaghetti squash in a dijon cream sauce. It was the BOMB! I would definitely go back if I were in the area again.",,,
7,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",229,142,835,4.0,8/26/2018,"First time having brunch at this Smith location and all I have to say is, make a reservation. I made a reservation on OpenTable and was seated in 5 minutes. The people without reservations were all lined up and waiting. This location is busy, especially for brunch. Once seated, we ordered the mac and cheese, the supreme burger, and the short rib hash with jalapeno grits.The burger appears small at first but it's actually the perfect size. The rosemary gravy that it comes with is amazing. The fries, although heaping and plentiful, were cold so they've definitely been sitting around. The mac and cheese was standard but still delicious. The short rib hash with jalapeno grits were amazing but heavy. We had to take it to go. The Smith is a great go to regardless of the location.",1,1,1

9,Hannah V.,"Flushing, NY",222,232,687,3.0,8/28/2018,"First time having brunch at the classic Smith and I gotta say it's just like what I thought - average. My friends and I waited around 20 mins on a Sunday, not too bad at all. This location is huge with both indoor and outdoor seatings. The menu offers the most basic brunch staples you can think of like egg benedicts, omelette, steak... I got myself a Mushroom, Egg & Cheese on ciabata. The mushroom is cooked well but a bit too sour to my taste. My friend likes his Johnny Benedict tho. It comes with crab cake and home fries on the side. The price is pretty standard. Wonderful service. Cute restroom with a photobooth. WARNING it takes pictures right after you swipe your card so be prepared haha.",,,
10,Alexia G.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,417,136,3.0,10/14/2018,I came here with a large group of family a few months ago. The family mainly ordered burgers and I had the mussels. The mussels were good. The food here is good but they have a jackpot because of their location. I went to the bar to have a drink last week before going to the movies. I love seafood but I believe the bar shouldn't smell like fish. It was almost like oyster juice was rubbed all over the bar. I think this is what pushed me to write a 3 star review. The bar has a wide selection of draft beers and beautifully named cocktails. I wasn't surprised they do not have a happy hour special but it would have been nice if they did.,1,,1
11,Lydia C.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",55,46,9,4.0,11/18/2018,"I went to The Smith on Wednesday night, I called the day before for a 7:30 reservation. We arrived early and had a drink at the bar and our table was ready at 7:30 exactly. The staff was friendly and helpful. I got the burger and it was amazing! I also got an old fashioned that was pretty good. I don't think the price was ridiculous. $15 for the drink and $18 for the burger. We did get a salad as an app it wasn't as big as I thought but it was good. They also have tap water and seltzer to ever table with bread.",,,
12,Seth W.,"New York, NY",6,180,127,4.0,9/20/2018,"I feel like if someone asked you to describe a typical New York-American restaurant / menu, The Smith is what would come to mind. I am not a fan of their brunch, but dinner is definitely a winning ticket. Burgers are great, and a lot of the appetizers are nice for sharing in a small group.Huge restaurants with rustic-chic ambiance. Great for groups and dates.",1,,

Updated review","Update: The Smith is still a brunch staple. However, I went here for dinner Tuesday night and was disappointed. My gnocchi was wonderful, buttery, potato pillows of sunshine, the blue cheese chips were a wonderful mix of crispy and creamy, but the service was not up to par for this area. Not having made reservations, my friend and I sat outside. Our server came by, and seemed okay. He asked if we were ready to order and if we had any questions.  When he came by the next time, my friend asked about the tomato soup (amazing), and I asked what mushrooms were in the bucatini. Our server did not know. I told him that was fine. He asked if there were any mushrooms that would make or break my decision. I told him no, I just love morels. He told me ""It definitely doesn't have those."" And then prompted us to order. Normally this wouldn't bother me, except I LOVE mushrooms, and would have likely ordered the dish. The server also never did find out what mushrooms were in the dish, although he said he would even if we ordered something different.  As my friend and I got to talking, someone came by and asked if we'd like bread. I said yes. I received a piece of bread wrapped in a paper bag, and a small butter dish, and then he gentlemen quickly walked away. Not offering my friend anything, nor giving him any bread. It was strange. By the time a server came by for us to ask, our starters had arrived. Our food was good. The server quickly dropped off the bill, we asked for our extra food to be packed up. We were done eating, and my friend needed to get going to a show, so we handed our bill off to someone else. A manager?  The server came by to pick up the bill, and we told him someone else had grabbed it.  He responded, ""Good. Have a goodnight kiddos!""This was bizarre. Not only am I not a ""kiddo"" (it's likely I'm older than the server.), I also found this behavior inappropriate for a casual/upscale restaurant near Lincoln Center. I love the Smith for brunch, but this was such a turn-off, I'm not sure when I'll return. Maybe if you appear older and buy a few drinks, you won't have the strange service my friend and I had.",,,
14,Christine B.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,11,0,5.0,11/6/2018,"Last night, my boyfriend and I stopped by The Smith to have some dinner for date night. I'd mentioned to him earlier that day that I was craving a burger and The Smith popped into my head. I'd never been before but I'd heard many great things.We got a seat immediately in a cute corner table and were greeted by our awesome server (didn't catch his name, unfortunately). I ordered my burger (medium!) and waited in anticipation. When it arrived, I noticed it was cooked pretty much to the point of well done. I'm usually not one to send food back but my boyfriend knew how much I wanted that burger so he stepped up to the plate and mentioned the error to the server. The server, without question, picked up my plate and went to fix the mistake. In the meantime, he had a side plate of cauliflower (delicious!) delivered to our table on the house. The burger came out again very promptly and was much, much better! Honestly, one of my top 5 burgers in the city now!We packed up our leftovers to leave and then a food runner brought us over a bag of cookies to take with us which are, amazingly, my FAVORITE dessert!! What a kind gesture!I'm a server part time, as well, and this was one of those experiences that just goes to show that good service, willingness to fix mistakes, and the act of going above and beyond makes everything worthwhile... AND makes me want to recommend this place even more. Thanks again to that amazing server who made our night. I'll be back to The Smith!",,,
15,Lana M.,"Yonkers, NY",0,11,5,5.0,11/2/2018,"Another fabulous girls dinner at The Smith. The ambiance is always fantastic. I've been here for brunch and dinner but this review is solely for dinner. They were able to seat us right away without reservations. But then surely enough, started flooding with people. They have plenty of seating, indoors and outdoors with heating! I wish there was more variety on the menu but the choices that they do have are delicious. We had the tartare for starters, which was phenomenal; So flavorful and pretty great amount for two people. We followed with the smith burger, medium; also great tasting. We had two double shots of baileys and the s'mores for dessert. It was so rich, creamy and perfect layering of marshmallow, chocolate and cream. This place is always a go to if I just want a good meal with drinks and something sweet. The service is fast, the place is loud and full of life, and overall the food is always delicious. I highly recommend.",,,
16,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3646,951,2085,5.0,7/30/2018,This place continually amazes me. Since there are multiple locations I expected it to be a little gimmicky but it is far from it. Salads are the way to go... actually any dish is the way to go. Food comes out quick and delicious. They understand that people are there for 30 min lunch during work. I loved the caesar salad and the shisto peppers. Come by you will not be disappointed.,15,4,14

Updated review","Another great visit, the hot potato chips with cheese just keep calling my name- still delicious, perfect starter. I also tried the mussels and they were good, the flavor is delicious. My friend tried watermelon salad and liked it - he also really loved the fries, which I agree are delicious.",,,
20,Kristen M.,"Glastonbury, CT",13,139,241,4.0,8/14/2018,"Went here for dinner tonight with 4 other ladies for a nice dinner out. Although it was busy, we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. We were brought water immediately, both still and sparkling. Our server was friendly, and we got our drinks fairly quickly. Once drinks arrived and we ordered our meals it took quite a while for our food to arrive and they do not give you any bread or anything unless you order an app.I had the short rib pasta and it was delicious! I wanted more! The other ladies in my group all ordered the chicken meal with mashed potatoes and liked their meals as well.Location of restaurant is easy to get to and service was pretty quick. I thought the pasta portion was kind of small for a $26 meal.",,,
21,Melina S.,"Livingston, NJ",157,64,200,3.0,3/25/2018,"My boyfriend and I made reservations for 7:30pm on Saturday evening, March 24th, 2018. When we walked in there was a group of people waiting to be seated, luckily they sat is within two minutes because of our reservations. A gentleman walked us all the way to the back of the restaurant which stunned us because we were not expecting the place to be so large! Our server Cameron instantly came to our table with still water in a bottle and seltzer water in a bottle. He told us about the specials of the day and gave us a couple minutes to think about what we wanted before he took our order. When he returned, I asked him a couple of questions about the menu before making the order. The Spicy Duck Wings we were told would not be spicy, but sweet with a little hint of spice so I ordered it as an appetizer. I think Cameron got it wrong, it was more spicy then anything else! My boyfriend ordered the Hot Potato Chips with Blue Cheese Fondue since we had seen it on their Instagram. He was in shock to see how different it looked from the picture - there was almost no blue cheese fondue to accompany even half the chips in the bowl. For dinner I ordered then Brick apresses Chicken and I have nothing bad to say about it. It was lovely! On the contrary, my boyfriend ordered the $25 Burger Supreme medium well and it looked more like a sushi burger - IT WAS SO RARE he couldn't even finish it! Our dessert was lovely - warm apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top (we substituted the almond ice cream for the vanilla ice cream). The restrooms are located on the downstairs floor of the restaurant and there is a cute little photo booth for pictures! My boyfriend and I wanted to do it as it only cost $5, however it wasn't working. Wish they posted a ""out of order sign"" before we wasted five minutes trying to figure the photo booth out. We came here for the first time because we saw how delicious the food all looked on their Instagram and we wanted to celebration an important occasion. I was saddened that it wasn't all the it looked online!! I rated this 3 out of 5 stars because my boyfriend and I expected more for what they post online and the server was incorrect about the spicy-ness of the wings and gave my boyfriend a rare burger instead of medium well.",1,,1
22,Geoff S.,"El Segundo, Los Angeles, CA",0,63,32,3.0,10/11/2018,"I had been looking forward to dining at the Smith. I always liked the street-side outdoor seating. However, I found the staff was not very warm or welcoming. Simply professional and executing their responsibilities. As far as the food is concerned, the menu has a nice range to it. But it seems a little showy but not tasty. For instance, I had the tomato soup appetizer. The presentation was lovely, very much like a melted cheese-covered French onion soup. But the soup itself was bland and unremarkable. The same thing happened with my grilled chicken sandwich. It has the currently-obligatory aioli (basil) along with a tomato ""jelly,"" that sounded interesting. While the sandwich was pretty to look at it was quite bland. Simply the typical slab of chicken breast, with the condiments--but not much flavor. Lovely location, across from Dante Park, but not so tasty or welcoming.",,,
23,Beheshta B.,"Reston, VA",124,41,38,5.0,9/28/2018,"Had breakfast here before leaving New York on Memorial Day weekend. The service was excellent and the food was delicious! We sat in the patio area of the restaurant, the seating outside are fairly close to each other, however, as busy as they get i wouldn't really blame them. Ended up having steak and eggs, the sauce that came with their steak was very tasteful! I would most definitely recommend The Smith to friends and family and would go back when I visit New York again.",1,,
24,Kimmy U.,"New York, NY",220,378,1226,3.0,3/1/2018,"LOTS of tables inside and outside, but there always seems to be a little bit of a wait. This location is right across from the Lincoln Center, so I didn't mind a wait on a nice Sunday morning/afternoon. I've been here for both brunch and dinner, and I prefer the dinner options. Their prices seem a bit more worth it compared to brunch. A lot of the brunch items seemed quite heavy and I wasn't really up for that.I do love their fries when they are fresh and hot -- SKINNY fries FTW. But when they get cold, they become stale pretty fast.- Mussels + fries: HUGE portion of both!! I'd come back just for this- Smoked salmon toast: comes with a side salad. Nothing special here, but one of the lighter options for brunch",1,,1
25,Arthur G.,"Scarsdale, NY",47,131,112,5.0,7/11/2018,"We ate at The Smith a  restaurant  on Broadway at Lincoln Center and while the food was excellent, the service mediocre, their restrooms were AMAZING! In all my years of going to restaurants, I never experienced the joy of walking into a bathroom that had a actual photo booth in the common area where both men and women wash their hands! I'm not sure if this is something that is in all of The Smith's restaurants but it's a great way to celebrate and commemorate a special event in New York City.I tried, unsuccessfully, to get my wife to come down to the restrooms and pose for photos but maybe you'll have more luck with your friends!",1,1,

Each time patrons dotted the side wall and never once did it appear there was even one table not filled. As a result on a Sunday, I made my way to the Smith. There was a plate of pancakes on my neighbors table that looked ready to be photographed for a magazine but I went healthier with the breakfast taco option. As we sat on the side walk as I had watched so many do, it was crowded and I literally could hear every word of our neighbors conversation and there was no way they couldn't hear my words. The tables were inches from each other and the food's presentation which was 5 star worth wasn't matched in taste. The service was excellent but I've crossed this off for brunch in the future.

This place was a bruncher's dream.Their menu is extensive of what you crave in the breakfast lunch combinations. Everything from a raw bar to eggs to waffles to bloody Mary's and mimosas.The bloody Mary's here are no joke. The spice is stronger than average so it's like you're getting a kick in the throat like good morning let's begin the day! I loved it. (Basically it's really spicy) I ordered the Benedict Johnny and it was phenomenal. Poached egg on top of chicken sausage on cornbread holy yum. The flavors were amazing. I wanted to cry like literally shed a tear because I knew every Benedict after that would never compare. My boyfriend was hungover and ordered the simple breakfast with scrambled eggs. He didn't have a lick of food and I wanted to kick him for missing this opportunity and making me look like a wild boar for eating both our meals. Delicious, everything.Super cute and lively joint.

31,Sharon S.,"New York, NY",2,98,131,4.0,2/10/2018,"Came here with husband after furniture shopping so to say that we were over hungry and had decision fatigue would be putting it mildly.  There was a 15 minute wait for a table and although there was no place to sit while we waited I do appreciate that there is adequate in door waiting space (not something that many places have).  Once seated we were immediately greeted by our waiter who told us the specials and I think that we must have had the deer in the head lights look about us because he told us that he would come back in a few so that we could settle in. I LOVE that they set down still and bubbly water and just keep refilling it for you.  That is a wonderful touch.  I don't love that everyone around us got bread and butter but we were never offered and even when I waved to the bread guy he looked through me as though my trainer had called him ahead of time and told him that I was off carbs and no matter how much I begged I was not to be offered bread.That aside we still could not make up our minds about what to have.  We shared out dilemma with the waiter and although the restaurant was fairly busy he suggested that we sip some of our cocktails, have a few oysters and then, once the alcohol kicked in perhaps then ,we could look at the menu. We thought this was an excellent idea and did just that.  I had a wonderful dirty Martini and the oyster of the day which was perfect and eventually we decided to share the vegetarian bimbimbap and a crispy salmon roll.  We were nervous that this would not be enough food but the portions were really generous and although we were pretty full we were feeling deprived of the bread and so decided to share a dessert (perhaps this was the plan all along?)We had the smores in a jar which was all that you would imagine it would be.I will be back.  For the food, for the service, for the drinks and maybe even the bread!",,1,

We had our family coming from abroad and after our daughter baptism, my father paid for the 10+ people dinner as a gesture; but few days after he went back in our country he realized his card had been cloned. He had many charges on Uber and iTunes made on days he was already home. Customers, if possible ask them to run your card in front of you. Mostly if you have a card from abroad, which seemed to had been the trigger to this fraud. Dear management at Smith, somebody at your staff is doing this.

40,Ronit M.,"Jericho, NY",87,209,706,3.0,12/23/2017,"Nice dining spot to venture to after seeing a film at the Lincoln Plaza Cinema. I went here for a a bite since I didn't eat lunch or dinner yet.  My sister suggested we stop here because they have a lot to choose from on their menu. Originally, I was craving a small salad and a cappuccino.  I found myself ordering a rosé cider with the burrata.  Both were delicious.  The burrata was a tad on the salty side, but only its excréments/exterior.  I think they sprinkled a tad much on it. The tomatoes were peppery, but they paired well with the innards of the burrata cheese. The chicken paillard had a great salad, but the chicken was ferociously gross and rubbery. I don't know why we ate it but we did. It felt like chewing on cartilage.  As a recommendation to the restaurant,  if by any chance you're aware that your chicken or any other meat or dish isn't up to par, it'd be best if you informed the waitstaff to let the customer choose another option from the menu. Customers respect that, honestly.  The drinks were all delish. I forgot the titles of the other two. My sister seriously wanted their French fries.  But due to the fact that we each had a meal,  we decided not to order anything additional,  not even a cappuccino to end the night.  The starter bread and butter was yummy too. It was the perfect density for smearing and biting.  The wölffer was very tasty. Not too sweet and on the dry side. It even contains the apple peel inside. Yummm! The waiter was helpful and competent. Brought over two bottles to start us with the options of flat water or sparkling water. No extra fee for that. T'was a new experience for me. The place was busy and therefore loud. I'm soft spoken, so it was a small challenge to get my vocals up a notch.  Overall, it was a great time with good people and pretty good food. Happy eats!",,1,

The Smith seemed like a good choice to satisfy us all; I had heard good things and the Yelp reviews seemed decent. We had a party of 6 and it took about an hour to get sat. Totes forgot that the NYC marathon had happened earlier and this location was in the heart of it, so there were tons of runners and their loved ones dining here. It was cool to be able to congratulate all the runners we saw. Back to The Smith, the service was a bit slow, but the staff was friendly. The oyster selection was awesome and tasty. The mac and cheese was flavorful and delicious. The chips with the blue cheese was good. My ribeye was a little salty, but cooked perfectly. My friend's chicken with potatoes was prob my fave dish. The brussel sprouts were good. The s'mores in a jar was damn good. My glass of pinot noir was on point. I'd come back again, if I was in the area.",1,,

Updated review","I came here again with a friend of mine and the food was not to disappoint. We had drinks and the waiter noticed I was slow to finish mine. He asked if I didn't like my drink, to which I said I'm just a lightweight (truth). He said if I didn't like it he'd be happy to take it off my bill, which was super nice of him to consider!They did forget one of our appetizers, but quickly rectified it by giving us a dessert on the house. The Smith is continuously a favorite place of mine in the city :-). The food, atmosphere, and service, it's always nice!",,,

I ordered the grilled shrimp entree. It was delicious in a sweet potato coconut curry. I thought the dish was really unique. The only downside is that it costed $29, and I finished the whole thing in one sitting (I'm notorious for taking the second half of my meal to go). Overall, the ambience was really nice, the service was friendly and prompt, and everyone in general enjoyed their meals. It's a great place for a large group.

Now let's talk food. Apart from the fact they serve Stephen Smith Teas -one of the tastiest yet quite pricey- their menu makes me long for a place like this in LA.    Maybe there is, though, and I haven't discovered yet.... The entire menu makes me want to try everything.   I didn't have a huge appetite and chose their tomato soup. Now there's tomato soup and Tomato Soup.This definitely ranks high on the list for the latter.   Think Tomato Soup and grilled cheese sandwich: well, you will find this in a bowl..... all created to perfection.    This in itself is a meal.   I ordered the avocado and poached eggs on toast.Two properly toasted whole wheat toasts with avocado.And I should say ""proper"" avocado because they didn't smash the life of out it.  Topped with perfectly poached eggs.... and it's not over yet!    Topped off with my favorite lettuce: curled endive and -yes, you're guessing right, that perfectly thinly sliced red onion. I know: that's a lot of ""properly and ""perfect"" in this review.   But you know what?   This place deserves it. From the moment one walks inside till the moment one leaves.    It's not cheap, but it's good. And in my book it's absolutely worth every penny. Will return. Will recommend. Will miss.",1,1,1

Love it that you can order the number of shellfish you want versus a fixed amount. Gives you the flexibility to start small and add on. An added bonus?

It turns out my concerns were unfounded.

Great place to catch up with old friends and to drink rosé on a sunny day  Food is a little pricy, but big portions and excellent quality make up for it!

55,Lu H.,"New York, NY",288,552,1933,5.0,9/8/2017,"I was very skeptical given multiple locations of the Smith, and in particular this Lincoln Square location seems to attract a lot of tourists, hence it's got all the ingredients of a typical ""tourists trap"". However, we decided to come here and give their breakfast/brunch a try. We arrived shortly after 9am on a Saturday morning, and were seated right away. There's no ""breakfast"" menu, only brunch, maybe breakfast is only served during the week? I got the breakfast pot pie and my husband got the benedict Johnny, also I was craving sugar so we got the monkey bread to share. I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised. Everything was delicious. Monkey bread was cooked in a griddle, crunchy at the bottom and topped with toffee glaze. It will definitely get you a sugar high, the very good kind. My breakfast pot pie was cooked very well, pastry on the outside was crunchy, and inside was popping hot, with sausage,  bacon, and mushroom filling. My only regret is it's too much food and I couldn't finish it. My husband's benedict Johnny had perfectly poached eggs, very flavorful home fries. The cornbread at the bottom was an interesting choice and his only complaint was cornbread was a bit dry in the end and didn't soak up the egg yolks and any meat juice as well as an English muffin would. Overall, very yummy breakfast. Service was fast in the beginning but slowed down a little when we were leaving as tables around us began to fill. Speaking of tables around us, someone ordered Vanilla bean French toast next to me, it smelled and looked amazing. I think next time we come back here, I'd order that.",8,6,8
56,Natalie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",145,158,892,5.0,9/29/2017,"It was packed! The wait was half an hour long but we decided it must be good if that many people were there. The lovely hostess took my information and promised to call once half hour had passed or table became available, which ever came first. We walked around a bit and returned to the restaurant to find an even longer line than we had left. We didn't received promised phone call but it had already been more than 30 minutes so we went inside. Our table wasn't ready but would be in 5 minutes. That's all good, it's a beautiful Saturday morning and I'm not in a hurry to anything. The overall atmosphere was great. Buzzing with liveliness, lots of beautiful families having Saturday brunch and the aroma of delicious meals permeating the air. We were given a nice table in a not so busy corner of the room. Our server immediately comes over to greet us, offered us water, free sparkling water too! And set our menus down. Everything looked good. We went for the classics. Let me remind you, this is a huge restaurant and it was crazy busy and had long a waitlist. From being seated,  to ordering, to our meals being delivered was less than 20 minutes. I was impressed! What was even more impressive was the service we received from every single staff member and even more how freaking amazing the food was.

I ended up ordering a side of fries which the waitress mentioned that there could be issues with cross contamination.

I've heard good things about this place, but I was really taken back by the entire experience as a whole. Service, food quality, pricing and decor all killed it here and I'll start by saying you should definitely go if you're on the fence.My friend and I made a reservation for 12:30 on a Sunday. When we arrived almost every table was taken, so I'd recommend booking a spot if you know you're going to come here later on. They have both outdoor and indoor seating (we got indoor). The decor on the inside is modern and tasteful. It's an open feel type of restaurant so you definitely don't feel cramped in any sense (even though it was packed).We were seated after a small wait while our table was being prepared. The server who waited on us was extremely knowledgeable. He gave us a brief run through of the menu, and let us know about any specials that were going on that particular day.  This spot is ideal if you're trying to have a relaxed brunch with great quality food. I opted for the Sicilian Baked Eggs after scouring pictures on Yelp for what looked best. The dish was so flavorful, you could really taste the burrata and tomato sauce in the dish and the artichoke was light enough not to overpower the other flavors. The dish was also accompanied with extra bread which made for good use in scooping up all the leftover pieces (Yes, it was THAT good).Overall, I left this place feeling satisfied in every sense of the word. Staff was great, food was amazing and reasonably priced, and the atmosphere was also welcoming. This place is great to catch up with a friend, bring your family, or even go alone and people watch near Lincoln Center. Put it on your list of must-try chill brunch spots in the UWS.",3,,

The waitress came quickly and took our drink and food orders. The food came out quickly as well. We ordered two servings of mac n cheese and their smashed garlic potatoes. The mashed potatoes were a good texture, perfectly garlicky, and delicious. We mostly came here to see the hype about the mac n cheese, which I heard was the ""best mac n cheese in NYC."" The mac n cheese is good but it's not the best in NYC. It's super cheesy and comes straight out of the oven but it's slightly overrated. Despite being overrated, it is still good mac n cheese and I would eat it again.At the end of our meal, we still had plenty of mac n cheese left over. It's listed as a starter but it is the size of a full meal. We both had about half of the plate left over so we took it in a box to go (it was still good the next day). The issue with this place being so big is that it can be difficult to find your waiter when you need them.

I understand location, location, but for $29, the grilled shrimp scampi didn't manage to even really fill me and only included 6 shrimp. The quality is definitely there, but I'm not sure if the price is worth the size. Secondly, we were told that they'd be able to seat a party of 7 in about 35 minutes and it ended up taking a little over an hour.

Updated review","I have to give The Smith 2 because it has changed! I've been going to The Smith for years and this is the first time my burger is so small - it use to be huge. And what makes it worse the favor is gone with the size. The service wasn't any better than the food. Disappointing to say the least. I miss the old The Smith. There are better restaurants to spend your money on, skip The Smith or maybe this location. **UPDATE** The Smith is back to how great I remember them to be! The burger was yummy and the service was great! So happy whatever changes were needed it was made. I'm on burger cloud 9! 4 stars :)",,,

For entrees, my boyfriend got the eggs benedict served with breakfast potatoes. He can be picky, but he loved his meal and pretty much licked the plate clean. I had the avocado toast, which was listed as being a lighter option. It was huge!! It was a simple and delicious plate, but I could only eat like half of it. We enjoyed our meal at the Smith! The menu is extensive enough for everyone to find something they'd enjoy. It's pretty much a no-frills place and you can get a good basic meal for a decent price!",1,,

I order the fried green tomatoes with a sauce that reminds me of apple butter that was not sweet at all, a great compliment with the fried green tomatoes. The main entree that I decided to order was shrimp and grits which was yummy even the next day when I ate the leftovers.

I've always had good experiences at other Smith locations - I usually go to the one in NoMad. Anyways, tonight we sat at the bar since the wait was vicious. We had to set our meal ourselves. The server threw us silverware and a bread, and cups, and we had to beg for water. The bread was stale, so that was a good way to start the meal. We ordered calamari to start, gnocchi and a burger. The calamari was cold and some parts were uncooked. The fried part was also terrible. The gnocchi was good flavor. However, the gnocchi was served cold / lukewarm at BEST, and they gave me 10 pieces total. Ten. That's it. For $20+ dollars... that's garbage price. Let's not get cocky; The Smith isn't that upscale nor is it a Michelin. They don't need to short their entrees by that much. Lastly, the burger was pretty good. Everything was cooked right, with the right taste overall. It kind of tasted like a Big Mac, but no problem with that. The fries tastes like a pound of salt, but I guess that's not surprising. Throughout this visit, not once were we asked how our meal was nor did a server once stop by. Tipped fairly but now in retrospect, not sure why when service was nonexistent.",5,1,
79,Heather B.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,81,61,4.0,2/6/2018,"Came here for brunch with two girlfriends before the women's march a couple of weeks ago. It was a crazy day because of the march so I'm not going to be difficult about the service which was a bit haphazard and forgetful. The food, however, was excellent as were the brunch cocktails. I loved my smoked salmon poached egg toast with lemony marscapone. One of my friends had the same as me and the other had the breakfast pot pie which she liked as well. Even though the service was a bit forgetful they were all pleasant and I'm sure on a more normal day, service would be much better. I would definitely come back again. Food is pricey but to be expected for this area right by Lincoln Center.",,,
80,Gabriela H.,"Manhattan, NY",247,25,99,4.0,1/3/2018,"I've been going to The Smith consistently for a few years now. They seem to always have locations in the right place and I know I can always get a great meal. I went recently on a Saturday night to the Lincoln Square location and it was PACKED. Luckily, I had a reservation and was seated right on time. I love the look of The Smith - its a large restaurant with big, beautiful bar running along the wall of the front room. If you walk towards the back, there's an additional dining room to house more hungry patrons.Depending on my mood, i either get a glass of red wine or one of their craft cocktails (they make a great Manhattan). Now, lets get to the food. ALWAYS ORDER THE MAC AND CHEESE. It comes out pipping hot and cheesy in a small cast iron skillet. I recommend getting it as an appetizer to share with the table. My favorite entree items are the filet mignon with peppercorn sauce and the braised short rib cavatelli. The steaks are always cooked just how you want them and the peppercorn sauce is delicious. The cavatelli is tossed in a 10-hour extremely tender short rib ragu with marscarpone on top. There's also a truffle gnocchi that is incredible.  I have yet to try dessert (probably cause I eat mac and cheese and then cavatelli beforehand) but I've heard great things about the s'mores in a jar.",1,,
81,Agta B.,"New York, NY",4,83,171,4.0,1/17/2018,"We went for an early, pre-Lincoln Center Show dinner on a Sunday. Unfortunately, they had a transitional menu - very limited dinner menu and a few brunch items. Beware if you are going for an early dinner. We were expecting the usual large menu. Fortunately, the chef was able to accommodate an extra request from the regular dinner menu and made us the side we wanted. Food was good - the tomato soup with a cheddar melt was perfect for a winter day. The burger with the raclette cheese was delicious and juicy and yummy. This was our first visit to The Smith Lincoln Center but it was on par with the locations. The decor was consistent and simple. The place was jam packed and super busy. It was pretty loud but by the time the brunch crowd left it was much better. Service was very pleasant and definitely went above for our group.",,,
82,Jordan B.,"New York, NY",245,20,8,3.0,7/10/2018,"Brunch and Burgers are A-OK. For dinner, save your money and walk up Columbus Ave.I've been to The Smith for both brunch and dinner, and I believe it's important to provide you with some insight into whether the restaurant is deserving of your money. While The Smith near Lincoln Center offers a pretty outstanding brunch menu, its dinner menu is lacking and overpriced.  A Chicken Paillard salad for dinner, which goes for $25, is somewhat plain and plated with ~$3 worth of chicken. Almost every entree dish, hold the burger, is above $25. If the quality was there, maybe the dishes would be worth their prices. Service is inconsistent and mediocre, and the craziness of the restaurant's crowds is off-putting.I do recommend The Smith's brunch and its burger. The restaurant offers variety of delicious and interesting egg dishes at common NYC brunch prices. The restaurant's burger is a shining light on the menu; it's large, juicy, savory, and comes with a mountain of awesome fries.",,,
83,Minty M.,"New York, NY",0,40,9,4.0,7/9/2018,"The food here is surprisingly good for a big, bustling chain restaurant that is usually full in the evenings. We've also had good experiences with the wait staff; everyone is spot on and very friendly and there's a fun, convivial atmosphere.The spicy salmon tartare app of minced salmon on crispy rice is delicious, as are the brussels sprouts. My table mates both liked their short rib cavatelli very much. My chicken paillard with arugula salad was very healthy, but I wasn't a fan of the slightly sour lemon dressing, or of the three large orange pits I discovered, mixed in with the salad (sadly I ate one... ugh!). A simple dessert of ice cream and sorbet was perfect.Appreciated the open bottles of tap and sparkling water brought to the table, right when we sat down, at no charge. The trend of restaurants trying to get patrons to pay for fancy bottled water is annoying; so this was a hospitable gesture, as were the chewy pieces of baguette and amazing unsalted butter, also brought without asking. For these reasons, and because the menu has options for all kinds of picky eaters, The Smith has become a regular when meeting friends or family for dinner.",,,

85,Harry S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,21,1,2.0,11/4/2018,"I've always wondered why there is a dearth of eateries around Lincoln Center and 'the Smith' is emblematic of the problem. High prices and 'meh' food. We were looking for a quick pre-concert meal so figured (against our better judgement) that the Smith would do the trick. Not. First, it was packed, but owing to its large space, accommodating. Loud? Of course. But I digress. We wound up sitting outside (yes, it wasn't too cold last night and the 'al fresco' is somewhat heated), because indoor was full. Our server was prompt, but oh so put upon or was it that she sensed we were not going to order a $40 special. Anyway, we ordered burgers, a beer and Chardonnay. She took our order, but wait, does it come with cheese? 'Yes' our server responded. Whew, good thing we asked. But it took a few tries to get the server's attention to find out what kind of cheese. Not missing a beat, she again responded, Cheddar. Cool. The burgers arrived in a timely fashion, cooked as requested, and presented much like a Burger Deluxe from days-of-old. We finished and then requested the bill. Wow! $18 for a burger, $16 for glass of Chardonnay (yes, one can buy a bottle for that price). I guess the beer was reasonable at $8. Paid and left, vowing never to return and never to eat in the area (we had a similar experience at Fiorella's a few years ago). Yes, shame on us. But this time we will leave sufficient time to eat in another neighborhood. Caveat Emptor.",,,

The soup came with a thick layer of cheese on top and bits of bread in it.We also got the rib eye steak medium rare, cavatelli with beef ragu, moules frites and cod dish. Everything was decently large sized portions except for the cod. The steak was very tender and flavorful and came with either a large salad or fries. The moules frites were huge and the fries were soo good but the mussels were lacking a little in flavor.

It was divine and I loved it, so if you enjoy a light but tasty option, do not look any further. The complimentary bread and butter was good as well. We had a Pinot Grigio and a mojito. Pinot Grigio was served in a tiny ""bistro style"" dinky little cup... ummm... why not a wine glass?!!? Server told us that wine glasses with a stem are typically used to serve guests who order a whole bottle of wine, not a glass. Let's be real, that's dumb, and nobody wants to drink a pricy glass of wine out of a dinky a** cup. Server offered to change the glass, but it wasn't necessary, just a poor decision on management to serve wine like that. Mojito was really tasty, although it tastes like hardly any alcohol was in it, but I did enjoy it. Refreshing on a hot day. What turned me off about this place was the server. Not friendly and pretty rude, with slow service. Tipped him well, because it's the right thing to do, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. I been a server, and I generally tip more for effort/hustle than actual service, but at LEAST be friendly. That's the main reason I wouldn't return here or recommend to a friend.",,,

It also has a huge side of salad (which was dressed but not salted) 3. Egg scramble with bacon and potatoes. The potatoes were so crispy and well seasoned. Bacon was medium cut and also crispy (slightly burnt on the ends which I loved) 4. Side of chicken sausage. A bit sweet for my taste 5.Maple cream apple waffle was soo soo good.  Great way to end the meal. Even though it's busy. The wait staff is very attentive.

101,Stephanie T.,"Chicago, IL",380,177,748,4.0,4/3/2017,"One of the bigger restaurants we've been to in NYC so the wait wasn't too long and they tucked us in a corner table so it wasn't too loud. I'd definitely recommend asking if they have a corner table if you're trying to catch up with friends rather than competing with  the sound of the surrounding tables. They had an outdoor patio seating area complete with heat lamps that warmed guests up before they even ordered. For my entree, I ordered the smoked salmon toast, which came with lox and poached eggs with onion on top of ciabatta bread with a side salad.  The dish wbas mostly nice and light with the salad adding a healthy green to add on top of your bites of benedict. The outside crust of the ciabatta was just a little burnt for my personal preference. But the inside of the benedict was nice and ruby and the salad and salmon tasted fresh. Note for people who come from places like Chicago where their smoked salmon benedict does not mean lox with onions and capers but rather just salmon: you should know this dish has all of those things in addition to the smoked salmon.  So if you don't want the onion and capers, you should ask for this dish without.",1,,1

Overall, great experience: drinks (porter beer was the best), entrees, freshest oysters. SERVICE - five stars.

Most recently (on a Saturday night) it was BAD. The server was friendly and respectful, but he made bad recommendations, was all over the place and not attentive, brought out the dessert with the ice cream melting/missing an extra requested scoop, brought out a cold cappuccino, replaced it very late with the added extra scoop (after the dessert was practically in the 2nd stage of digestion.)I was too hungry to send anything back, and there were long periods the server would not be anywhere nearby even if I did want to modify anything. So the most recent visit was a poor one. Previous few visits have been rather good. As a customer I do not think that ""it was a Saturday"" is a valid excuse for poor service. If that's the case then give us discounted ""Saturday"" pricing.Again, would rate lower if this was my ONLY experience here.",,,

Debating between a regular burger ($18) and the pricer short rib burger ($25) our helpful waiter steered us towards the tasty short rib. Much to our disappointment the short rib burger was dry and absent of any taste or flavor. If you're craving a burger go for the regular.

Nevertheless, it was a struggle to hear the three other people at my table. Our leisurely dinner was cut short because we wanted to leave as soon as possible.

The macaroni and cheese is amazing.It's always quite crowded before a show, which can be okay or bad.The last time I went, my girlfriend and I were seated in the somewhat large back room where tables are a mere inches from neighboring guests. I had to endure listening to the low class guest at the next table give a loud soliloquy to her friend about her educational achievements and how important she was. Go here is you are willing to risk being put on the equivalent of a terrible date with the table next door to you. Dear The Smith, I realize the neighbor I sat next to was not of your choosing, but I recommend that you have a communal table for people willing to risk such a situation and a bit more distance between tables for people who value peace of mind.By the time I left The Smith and got to Boulud Sud on the same block, I felt like I had arrived in Shangri La.

It's pretty big and they hold a lot of people outside. The outside seating wasn't that appealing due to the scaffolding and exhaust from all the cars on the busy street.  I had the benedict johnny which was good, but not great.  The home fries were seasoned well.  It was a nice twist on your traditional eggs benedict by having the corn bread instead of an english muffin.  Boyfriend had the crispy catfish sandwich which he said had a lot of breading and not enough fish.  Our waitress was pleasant but clearly busy so her time at our table never lasted more than 15 seconds.

I ordered the Sicilian baked egg and my friend ordered the breakfast pot pie, and we were both really happy! I didn't think the Sicilian baked eggs would be very filling (because the menu description makes it sound like just eggs) but it actually ended up being the perfect amount of food. I love the tomato sauce they use, and the textures and different tastes all work really well together The breakfast pot pie is even better than what I ordered. Really unique and tasty. I don't recommend going to dinner.... the food just not worth the price and there's nothing special that you can't find elsewhere for cheaper and better. If you go for dinner, I recommend getting a mac and cheese to share... some of the best mac and cheese I've had and it's perfect for sharing!I'd give it 5 stars, but it's a little more expensive than it should be and the dinner is just average.",2,,2

The open door/window into the sidewalk concept created a lovely environment. I really loved the ambiance. You also get sparkling water on the house.",,2,
123,Sunny Y.,"Buckhead, Atlanta, GA",210,59,158,4.0,7/14/2017,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday, and man oh man was it crowded!! We had a reservation but one person in our party was running late, so we had to wait for her to get here before we could be seated. However, they were surprisingly able to sit us as soon as she did arrive despite all the other people that were constantly flowing in and waiting! Once we were seated, the service was great and fairly quick. They even provided sparkling water (as well as normal still water) free of charge, which is very rare!Now onto the food, we ordered the Benedict Johnny, Steak & Eggs, and the Simple Scramble. The Benedict Johnny came with chicken sausage served on top of this delicious cheddar cornbread. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that's looking for a special twist to their typical eggs benedict! I didn't try the steak & eggs, but my friend said it was very good! I did, however, try the waffle that came with it and it was made from potato... SO unique and scrumptious!! The Simple Scramble is your all-American breakfast - scrambled eggs, potatoes, BIG juicy pieces of bacon, and a side salad. The ""home fries"" that came with both the scramble and the benedict were delicious diced potatoes seasoned to perfection and very very addicting! The place itself was huge! There are so many tables inside AND outside, which is great for how busy they get. They also had the outside door open (garage style), so it felt like we were sitting outside (minus the summer heat) even though we were inside, which was awesome! I'd love to try the other locations for this restaurant in the city!",3,,

Pot of Mussels was also delicious, the iron cast pot keeps them nice and warm the entire time. Enjoy with perfect fries! Huge portion but still bit pricey.

He gave honest recommendations and didnt make us feel rushed to leave after we paid our bill. I had the classic eggs benedict. The eggs were cooked just right and the hollandais sauce wasnt overwhelming. The potatoes, cooked with onions, were seasoned nicely.

Located right across the street from the Lincoln Center, the Smith is a friendly establishment with plenty of seats and a variety of dining options. My friends and I came here around midnight on Saturday after a show, and there were plenty of tables open (they're open all night!). We mostly ordered drinks and a few snacks to share, so I can't comment on their main entrees. The fries were perfect -- crispy, salty, thin, but still potato-y. We also had an order of the toffee pudding with ice cream which was delicious but a bit too decadent. Another friend ordered the sundae which was humongous and looked straight out of the cartoon you loved as a kid, I swear. So picturesque. I'll definitely be back to try brunch!

They have a big crowd, nice ambiance, and a well rounded menu.The reason I'm knocking stars is because we ordered the vanilla bean French toast and it had so much potential but was pretty dry. We ended up asking for extra syrup on the side, and noticed someone sitting next to us did the same thing. The other reason for knocking stars is because our waiter pretty much neglected our whole section for 40 minutes.

It was a busy time of day, the restaurant was packed, but the staff was still always very attentive!I shared an order of the calamari appetizer with a friend, which was fried and had marinara sauce on top.   I also got the lobster roll with fries.   I had a special request for each, for an ingredient to be left off, and both plates came marked with a little red flag.  This makes me confident that those people with allergies and other special requests are listened to and taken seriously, which is great.They have EXCELLENT fries here!   They are very thin, almost shoestring-esque, and nicely salted.  The lobster was beautifully cooked and very plentiful on my lobster roll.   It was a little on the mayo-y side for my liking, and I wasn't a fan of the little chopped raw onions which I had forgotten to ask about.   For an onion-lover, I'm sure it would be totally fine though.  There were small diced tomatoes in the dish which I enjoyed. Everything was fresh and nicely assembled on the plate.   The brioche bun was buttered and fantastic: nice and crispy!   This was definitely a knife-and-fork sandwich.   :)My friend got the bar steak and absolutely loved it!  Perfectly cooked to her liking.This was the perfect spot to go with such a large crowd.   Everyone was pleased with their lunches, and many enjoyed the s'mores dessert which was quite unique and beautifully plated!While I wouldn't get the lobster roll again, I would recommend it for those liking mayo and onions more than I do.  I would definitely go back if given the opportunity, and would be eager to try more of their unique menu items!",,,
135,Samantha Y.,"Ridgewood, NY",147,17,58,1.0,1/19/2018,"Normally, I don't like writing bad reviews about restaurants. My experience was so bad, I feel I have no other choice. The only positive things I have to say is the atmosphere was nice and our waiter was very kind.I was served an under cooked pork chop. I nicely explained that it was undercooked (medium rare to rare in the middle) to the waiter and asked for him to take it back.  Moments later the Manager came to my table. She explained that there was absolutely no way it could be over or under cooked because they use a thermometer. She gave me a matter-of-fact/ disgusted expression. I said ""hey I understand the outside looks cooked. But the inside isn't. Maybe it was measured a little too close to the end."" She then said ""Sorry you think that."" I asked her to look down at the actual pork chop and she refused. She also implied that we didn't go out enough to know what a pork chop should look like and this is how we serve our pork chop. I wasn't looking for my meal to be comped or to get over on anyone. I simply didn't want to get sick or pay for something that could potentially give me food poisoning.I asked her to take the item off my bill. She then walked away without a word.  She stood by the group of  hostesses... who began staring at us. She ended up standing mid-dinning area...a couple feet away from our table for the rest of our meal. I've never needed to talk to a Manager or send back my food any other restaurant.

143,Sandi H.,"Beverly Hills, CA",191,115,54,4.0,1/20/2018,"I used to go to The Smith in the East Village years ago when I lived in NYC, but I've been gone for seven years and just occasionally visit friends. I was delighted to see that The Smith has expanded to several locations throughout the city -- including one near Lincoln Center, where my friend and I were taking a tour for her birthday. I suggested it as a lunch place, and she was excited and said she always takes her out of town friends there -- and although I used to be a local, I am now one of those ""out of town friends.""SERVICEWe loved our waiter, Cameron. We had a great time with him and found him charming and funny. He kept the drinks flowing and was knowledgeable about the menu. He even put a candle in our dessert to help celebrate the special occasion of my friend's birthday.We didn't really encounter anyone else in any meaningful way, but we both left the restaurant praising him and telling our other friends later in the day how great he was.FOODWe split the burrata appetizer, which was a generous portion and good for sharing (but probably too much for one person unless you're a real ""cheese head""). The cheese itself was what I consider a perfect combination of a somewhat firm exterior and a goopy center (with some garnish I couldn't quite identify, perhaps an herbed oil or some kind of subtle tapenade) -- not a big ol' gloppy, soupy mess as you sometimes get at other places. It was served on top of a small salad of roasted tomatoes and arugula and accompanied by really delicious lightly toasted ciabatta bread. A great start to the meal.My friend liked her butternut squash and goat cheese salad, an entree that was good-sized and with generous dollops of goat cheese throughout. I opted for the tomato soup appetizer as my meal, not realizing that the ""cheddar melt"" on top transformed it into a French onion soup-style creation, served in a small white crock. Everything about this dish was amazing, though I think it would be too much as an appetizer and the dish is a bit too small (and the cheese a bit too melty) to properly share between two people. I'd also ordered a side of the garlic spinach for an extra injection of vegetables, and my oh my was that good -- the perfect amount of garlickyness, not overcooked, and set off nicely with some shallots. My own personal ""hack"" was to put the garlic in the soup, which was so thick and robust that I ended up eating the whole thing -- from the cheese melt to the tomato -- with a fork. The soup mellowed the garlic out and the spinach spiced up the soup. I would recommend anyone and everyone do this!Since the monkey bread is only available at brunch and this was a Friday lunch, we rounded out our meal with pumpkin bread pudding served with cinnamon ice cream and mascarpone. Absolutely stellar (and not just because my friend got to blow out a birthday candle). DRINKSI ordered the ""Dirty Jane"" because it's supposed to contain a pickled tomato in it (and I am a pickle head) but unfortunately they were out. Since it was lunchtime, I settled on a couple of glasses of wine instead -- a perfectly nice rose and a surprisingly good and drinkable Cabernet Franc from the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York.I don't love how the wine is served in short, stemless glasses -- not even wine-shaped glasses -- especially because I know how the shape and size of a glass can change the experience of the wine. In the case of wine, beer, and spirits, the vessel really does matter. I do love how you get the choice of flat or sparkling water -- both complimentary -- at the table, and Cameron gave us one of each since my friend and I don't agree about bubbles in our water. We also loved that they left the water bottles on the table and swapped them out when they ran low or were emptied. (My friend drinks A LOT of water.)Our espresso drinks -- her cappuccino and my latte -- were OK flavor-wise, but the foam appeared to be created by a novice barista. Considering the time and care put into everything else, it was kind of surprising that coffee was not a strong point.OVERALLWe had such a good time that we're going back today (the next day!) for brunch... and monkey bread.

Updated review","This place sadly is slipping. Visited The Smith pre Lincoln center as in the past. The noise level is still deafening and the tables are still on top of each other. However, the food has slipped. Tuna Tartare was a mess. One plate of tuna and another of what was supposed to be ""grilled ciabatta"" that was REALLY disappointing. Our other appetizer was the Honeynut squash and goat cheese salad. There wasn't much goat cheese and the salad was cold except for the honeynut squash cubes that were hot and basically just thrown in. Entrees were the salmon and the braised short rib cavatelli. The salmon was good. The braised short rib cabatelli was not. The pasta was nicely cooked but the short ribs and marscapone were very unpleasant. I've had similar dishes at other restaurants and they were delicious but this one was disappointing. Dessert was the hot fudge sundae which was just OK. This place, pre Licoln Center at least, feels like a glorifed diner with diner service at ""fine dining prices"". On the other hand, it's one of the few places in the area that are affordable and, given their location, their rent must be astronomical so I'm appreciative of that. I really want to give them 3 stars, but I gave them 3 last time and they've slipped. So, Sorry ""The Smith"", 2 stars this time.",,,

157,Emma T.,"New Orleans, LA",370,161,251,3.0,12/19/2016,Went to the Smith with a New York local who called it a classic NYC brunch spot. The inside is very classic and large. We had a reservation but still waited 20 minutes - it was packed! Finally sat down and it was so loud could barely hear waiter. The food itself was good. Really large portions so you definitely get a good meal for what you pay for. But it's pricey and I didn't think the menu was that unique to warrant the prices! Overall I think the Smith is a bit overrated for the sub par service and prices - but it's certainly a solid spot to go.,,,

159,Alice W.,"Fairfax, VA",518,755,2372,3.0,9/9/2016,"Popped by the Smith for a quick brunch. We were seated outside on their patio. It was a bit tight seating-wise, but it was a lovely day out so we braved it. If you're not a fan of being practically elbow to elbow with a stranger, ask to be moved somewhere else on the patio or inside. We were squashed between two small tables with the register right behind me, so it was difficult for me to get in and out of my seat. Also, be prepared to hear everyone's life stories as you're all in earshot of one another. The women next to us were talking about a surgery in excruciatingly detail, almost to the point where I did not want to eat anymore. So just a heads up that you can hear anything and everything.    We ordered the mac and cheese ($15) as a starter. It's big enough for two people, and we weren't even able to finish the whole thing. I couldn't resist ordering the avocado toast ($17). Although it's a bit pricey for avocado toast, it's a hefty portion. I got two large organic multi-grain slices of toasted bread topped with chunks of avocado, two poached eggs, and arugula. I believe they sprinkled some red pepper flakes and lemon on top of the avocado toast, so there's a slightly tangy flavor. Pretty good and they definitely didn't skimp on avocado! I was so full I couldn't even finish my second slice (although having and mac and cheese beforehand certainly didn't help). Still for $17, it's a bit much for toast, eggs, and avocado.Great service! Our server was very prompt and friendly despite the mad onslaught of folks that came in for brunch. 3.5 stars.",7,,4

Very upsetting I later received an email stating my reservations were canceled which lead me to believe they didn't even check to see if I did place a reservation.

164,Cindy R.,"Littleton, MA",46,217,174,5.0,5/18/2018,"I loved everything about this visit to the Lincoln Square location of The Smith. I went with my sister, my niece and her husband last Saturday evening. We had a reservation for 7:30 and arrived about 15 minutes ahead of the appointed time. Sis and I arrived first and checked in and went straight to the bar where we ordered a pinot noir (Sis) and a Manhattan (me). The place was banged out and bustling all around us as we enjoyed our drinks while waiting for my niece and her hub. They arrived just before 7:30 and had time to order a drink at the bar before we were escorted to our table. Once seated we were promptly attended to by our terrific waiter--he was a total pro: attentive and convivial. We started our order with a half dozen of fresh and delicious Wellfleet oysters. They were so good we ordered another half dozen! Very fresh! We opted for several shared plates rather than individual entrees and it was a nice choice for a casual dining experience. We got to sample several items, all of which were very tasty and well prepared. The standouts were the amazing spicy salmon tartare, creamy jalapeño grits (my niece's favorite), the flavorful kale and quinoa salad with roasted chicken, and the perfectly textured and very tasty gnocchi. We enjoyed an excellent sampler of The Smith's offerings. We topped off our meal by splitting the sticky toffee pudding, which was delicious! As noted, the entire restaurant was packed so its advisable to make a reservation. Will definitely return.",,,1
165,Richard L.,"New York, NY",1,49,4,5.0,1/27/2018,"On this very mild winter day I happen to pass The Smith and craved Mac & Cheese. So...headed in and got a takeout. What a treat!!I didn't think they would pay close attention to detail for a take-out order. However I was impressively mistaken. It was perfectly made, they even put the dish under the salamander and crisped up the top. Total yum. Sat behind Lincoln Plaza Cinema for a picnic.",,,
166,Christina W.,"New York, NY",187,7,6,4.0,2/12/2018,Love it here! Usually good steaks and I love their short rib cavatelli. Tried the Mac and Cheese skillet and the brick pressed Chicken dish and they were both so good! The Mac & Cheese came out still bubbling and there was a ton of cheese pull action. Could be heavier on flavor but regardless still good with the crispy top. Chicken was tender and flavorful with a nice layer of mashed potatoes under. They're a bit pricey but it's a good place to go once in a while!,,,
167,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",280,552,265,3.0,4/24/2017,"This is a decent spot in the Lincoln Center area for brunch or dinner. Lincoln Center doesn't have many average-priced dining options. For example, this area is home to Lincoln Ristorante and Boulud Sud which are $$$$. The Smith then is a nice contrast when you just want something casual and affordable. Dinner will set you back between $25-$35 and Brunch is in the ~$20 range. Their menu is pretty extensive and you can always find something of interest whether you're in the mood for pasta, steak or shrimp scampi. They even have a vegetable bibimbap on the dinner menu! They're like a jack of all trades but a master of none. Everything is solid, but nothing stands out as excellent. Thus this place is great for a casual meal. When the weather is nice they open up they have a really large outdoor space right along Broadway. You can feast with a view of The Metropolitan Opera, Lincoln Center fountain and adjacent concert halls. It's one of the nicest squares in all of Manhattan.",1,,
168,Matthew N.,"Thousand Oaks, CA",281,95,192,4.0,11/22/2016,"Came here for brunch with some friends and we ordered the avocado toast (17$) and chicken pot pie (24$). The prices were pretty steep for what we ordered, but after receiving our food, I could see why because their portions are HUGE.For the avocado toast, it came with two large multi-grain slices of toasted bread topped with chunks of avocado (they are not cheap with how much avocado they pack on the bread), two poached eggs, and arugula. In addition, they sprinkle some red pepper flakes and lemon on top to add more seasoning. Overall, the avocado toast here is great and is really filling.But what was even more filling is their chicken pot pie. It has a nice flaky crust with a creamy interior filled with mushrooms, chicken, and onions. It was really delicious, but I thought that it was a just way too heavy and should definitely be shared.In regards to their service, it was eh. During our visit, the staff weren't particularly attentive and it took a long time to get our food and get any service.",,,
169,Lanny N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",429,39,28,3.0,10/8/2017,"Good food but quite pricey. The mac and cheese and the pot pie was great. They are definitely heavy meals, so try sharing different items.",1,1,1
170,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",251,239,2100,3.0,3/29/2017,"Think of The Smith as a very sophisticated diner. There are a few locations within Manhattan strategically placed around bars and go-to entertainment venues and each of them with their own extensive, over priced menu for breakfast, lunch, brunch and dinner. I've only come for breakfast (once) and dinner on a few occasions but my decision to dine here has literally been because it's near my gym and I was just starving!The best experience at The Smith is breakfast. A friend and I are 6:30am spin class warriors and wanted to squeeze in a leisurely breakfast before work. We walked in right at they opened around 7:30am and the doors were unlocked but no one at the front. It felt incredibly awkward until a waiter spotted us and offered any table of our choice, since we were the first customers of the day. Mulling over the menu, I wasn't thrilled at the cost of an avocado toast (~$16) and the only cost friendly item was their yogurt parfait with fruit ($9). My friend had a heavy breakfast with sausages, potatoes and cheese - which suited him well! I ended up with the avocado toast because not only am I #basic but I was craving it and loved how it came with two poached eggs and what looked like two avocados. We both had coffee but despite knowing what I ordered I felt like I could've paid less somewhere else. That silly dilemma aside, the venue was so peaceful and when we took pauses in our conversation to eat all we heard were glasses gently clinking, plates making thuds against the table and new customers arrive. For once, the service was fast unlike dinner..Dinner can be enjoyable if you plan ahead of time and if you have good hearing. The UWS location has several tables and a couple of booths which makes for a very noisy place. My recommendation would be to eat outside where it's easier to hear and the heat lamps make up for early Spring/Fall weather.  Inside, nearly everyone is raising their voice and I would assume it's partially because they're frustrated with why no one has come to take their order or offer still or sparkling water.  But if you can handle a noisy venue, then you'll have a great time because the dinner menu is pretty enjoyable. Of course, the food is overpriced but there are plenty of appetizers, sides, mains, salads and daily specials (that are actually worth the price!). There's an extensive drink menu as well. The only thing that seems to be tiny about The Smith is their dessert menu but that's for the best since they have fairly large servings that are easy to share amongst 2-3 people (depending on the dish).  I'll definitely come back, but only if I'm starving and can't decide on a cuisine or don't want to leave the UWS.",2,1,1
171,Sam M.,"Austin, TX",1,12,4,1.0,6/8/2018,"Gnocchi is fried. I requested medium well burger, and got well done. The tables were ridiculously tiny and no one bothered to clear the plates when our entrees arrived.",,,
172,Julia E.,"Chestnut Hill, Chestnut Hill, MA",153,9,20,5.0,7/8/2018,Second time at The Smith in a week! We tried out one of their other locations this time but had the same great experience.

173,Cindy A.,"Marietta, GA",79,208,207,4.0,5/14/2017,"We were visiting my daughter in NYC over Mother's Day and she took us to The Smith for brunch. This place is much bigger than it looks and dice we had reservations we were seated quickly. The staff was super friendly and helpful!  We started with the monkey bread for an appetizer - just do it!!!  OMG. It was life changing!  Each of the four of us had a different main dish and all the food was delicious. So if you are looking for a good brunch place, give The Smith a try. You won't regret it!  (And get the monkey bread!!)",,,
174,Alex L.,"New York, NY",31,54,0,3.0,8/28/2018,"The Smith on Lincoln Square is an interesting place. It is both fun and a bit of a disappointment. The dining room is welcoming, though very loud, but we expected that: it is very fast-paced and appropriate for small groups or a friends' reunion - not a romantic dinner. The service is very friendly. The food is okay, seeing the many people that need to be served at the same time; yet, in view of the prices, The Smith could, IMHO, do better. The hummus was maybe a little too spicy by middle-Eastern standards, the tuna tartare was good. There were three of us, and we each chose a different sauce to accompany our NY strip steaks. Unfortunately, all sauces were mediocre; the steaks themselves, although we had asked for three different levels of cooking, were all cooked identically; the quality was medium, not worth the price. The desserts, on the other hand, were typically American and deliciously rich! I imagine that The Smith might be more attractive as a place for brunch, but the dinner experience let us reasonably satisfied but less than enthusiastic.",,,
175,Jessica L.,"Boston, MA",51,363,32,5.0,3/12/2017,"Phenomenal brunch.  Wanted to order everything off the menu!  We ordered lattes, the fried green beans with ranch dip, poached eggs with polenta and crispy potatoes, and Sicilian eggs (similar to Shakshuka but with artichokes and spinach). Everything was delicious. Perfect brunch spot.",2,2,
176,Tunaidi A.,"Manhattan, NY",498,1418,10,4.0,10/30/2017,"The Smith is a pretty decent brunch spot. The food is great, the variety and options are great, service is great, and prices are reasonable. The fries are delicious and they use gourmet ketchup. There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The catch is, even with the large seating areas, waits are still expected, and sometimes their estimates for waits can be quite off. It's a gamble, so if you have time, The Smith isn't a bad option.",,,
177,Jessica M.,"Norwalk, CT",0,58,3,2.0,5/24/2018,"I have never wanted to get out of a restaurant faster. Loud ambiance. Which is fine, but there should be more attention paid to where you sit your patrons if you have a loud group of youngsters and a lot of open tables in the back, and you have a reservation, why would you sit a number of couples around a loud group of 10-15 kids drinking and loudly celebrating and totally unaware of how loud they are. It made the whole meal totally unbearable. The food was ok, though a deep challenge to remotely enjoy given the terrible ambiance. Outside on Broadway was more serene and quiet. Seriously. SERIOUSLY.",,,

179,Beatrice W.,"San Francisco, CA",143,517,81,3.0,4/26/2017,"In a city with such innovative and diverse cuisine I cannot understand why you'd dine at The Smith.  They have a ton of menu options, which some people interpret as something for everyone, but in my book means none of the dishes will be truly outstanding.  I opted for a ""cheap"" light dinner: the $15 mac n cheese appetizer and an $8 beer.  After tax and tip, I had to fork over almost $30 for that!  Quite absurd.  Now that said, the mac n cheese was baked in a 6"" cast iron skillet and pretty good and was actually a meal sized portion, but it still wasn't mind blowing enough to justify the price.  It also could have benefited from some bread crumbs for extra texture.  After my meal here I had second dinner in the East Village - spending only slightly more money for much more creative cuisine.",,,
180,Abigail R.,"New York, NY",2432,271,957,4.0,9/21/2017,"I been to two locations and both times I've had a great experience. This is a great place for cocktails, appetizers and dinner. It is rather loud because of the multiple conversations going on. However i usually com here to talk with friends or for brunch so i don't mind it. I been here multiple times to the upper west side location so i will mentioned below everything i have tried for appetizers I had the mac and cheese (one of the best in the city ) , hot potato chips blue cheese fondue was amazing as a starter also. For the main courses ive tried  the Lobster roll it was ok a little to soggy for my taste. Also had the smith bar steak this was good however it had seasoning to it that was not bad but different i think i prefer just something more simple.

186,Kelly E.,"New York, NY",124,399,56,2.0,2/22/2017,"I do not get the appeal of the Smith. Overpriced and under quality food, plus you'll always find yourself waiting for a long time before you eat! I came here on a few different occasions and every time I wound up waiting at least 45 min for a table for 2. Come on, seriously? Once you are seated, there's nothing on the menu that's really outstanding. I've had the burger here and it's over cooked and clearly overpriced. I left hungry. Hot potato chips were okay but it's a small portion for $9Chicken Pot Pie is bland and more importantly there is not enough crust! In general, the restaurant is way too loud (seriously, acoustics were rough), it takes forever to get the server's attention for anything (INCLUDING getting the check.. which may explain why you wait so long for a table), and the food is only mediocre.Pass",2,1,
187,Joel S.,"New York, NY",35,639,14,4.0,4/29/2018,"Pleasantly surprised by this ginormous restaurant near Lincoln Center.  The restaurant is cavernous and noisy.  There was outdoors seating but it was a bit too chilly.  We were concerned at first because the restaurant was running late and we had a 6:15 reservation followed by the Philharmonic.  We were seated by 6:30 and all proceeded smoothly.  The front of the house staff were cool under pressure and the waitstaff were very nice.  Cocktails were good. There's a solid beer selection and all wines are available by the glass, carafe and big-ass carafe (I'm paraphrasing here). We were running late and split an order of shishito peppers to start.  I'm glad they have become a thing, because they're good.  All of the main courses were above average to excellent. We tried the fancy ass burger (paraphrasing again) which was good, but maybe not 33% better than a standard burger.  The vegetable bibimbap and paella were really good.  One friend improvised with a kale salad topped with salmon and was very happy.  Coffee was good.Don't panic at the crowd with torches and pitchforks milling around the hostess station.  They will get you through the experience in one piece.  Will be putting the Smith into our pre-Lincoln Center rotation.",,,

The service was quick and positive even during busiest morning houses We loved having the option of ordering breakfast specials too! We ordered a mushroom toast and avocado toast and they both were amazing. The mushroom toast was something I've never seen anywhere and I know I'll be craving it again and again.

Instead of fries, ask for the home fries - amazing. Overall: great place to eat. A tad noisy and the service was a little rough (waiters are scrambling to keep up, so simple things like drink refills go unnoticed - happened both times).

I got the burger that was okay, I really dislike when people ask you what temperature you want the burger at and no matter what you say it ALWAYS comes out Medium to Well-done. It just doesn't make any sense to me, if that is how it's going to be just give me whatever you were going to make in the first place.

I had a friend who worked here and during my first week here my boyfriend and I decided to visit her because we also did not know what places to eat in New York. We fell in love! PLEASE ASK FOR VINCENT. He is an incredible server and I cannot say enough things about him. He is funny, attentive, and makes going to The Smith an enjoyable experience! I brought my parents here and my parents loved everything about this place. My dad LOVED the Shepard's Pie and said it was the BEST meal he had while visiting me. He talked about his meal the rest of his trip. Even when I bring it up he still raves about it. Dinner: When I go I usually get the squash/eggplant rings. Depending on the season the rings change vegetables. Either way they are always fantastic! The mac and cheese is the best I've had in the city. I am a super freak about mac and cheese and seek out restaurants that have mac and cheese to try them all. This one is my number one spot when I am craving a good mac and cheese. Drinks:I am working on trying them all. They are all delicious especially the cocktails. Brunch: I have also come here for brunch and it is also delicious. There is a short rib has that is to die for. GET IT! They also still serve the mac and cheese... *nudge nudge* Overall:Make a reservation so that you can enjoy this restaurant and all that it has to offer. It is always clean and full of people. I love the atmosphere. You can also sit inside or outside. I personally like sitting inside and close to the front of the restaurant especially in the summer when they have the doors open. It makes for a great place to take someone on a date or just to sit around with friends. ASK FOR VINCENT! He won't let you down!",,1,1
