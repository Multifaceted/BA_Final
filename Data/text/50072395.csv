0,Fernando O.,"Manhattan, NY",129,8,0.0,3.0,8/28/2018,"This isn't a gourmet restaurant or some chain food spot. It's basically a corner deli so you should know that's it's not great in terms of food or going to provide exceptional customer service. However, if you want a quick bite to go for a very cheap price, then this is the best spot on the area. Cheap prices and quick (almost too quick) service makes this worth it. But don't expect any sort of ""experience"".",1,,

Since it's really the only place to pick up a warm breakfast without going out of my way,  I've learned that they can make a good basic sandwich but may fumble with custom orders as simple as ""Salt but no Pepper"" simply because they were moving too fast or multitasking with another order to realize.",1,,

My buddy got the chicken ceaser wrap and not only was it the size of a McD's breakfast burrito(tiny), he said the dressing tasted super sour and didn't even finish it.

5,Eevie S.,"New York, NY",5,2,0,1.0,4/26/2018,"I made an online order on April 26, 2018 for a bagel with bacon and cream cheese at 827am. The app I ordered on said 20 minute for my pickup, which I found excessive but still gave me time to get my food and be on time for my 9am meeting, so whatever.  Upon arriving 20 minutes later at 847am and asking for pickup, one of the ladies yelled ""pickup"" and continued to ring up their clients, without saying anything else to me. I waited and asked her if it wasn't ready since she didn't say anything to me and rung up several customers -understandable morning rush. Her counterpart, ringing on the second register, yelled at me and asked what I ordered. 1. This angered me bc it meant they did start on my order, placed now 25 mins ago. 2. I don't need to be yelled at, I'm an adult that very well understands both her English accent and what she said to me in Spanish. 3. What is the point of placing an order 20 mins in advanced and still having to wait on the line of people ahead of you, totaling 30 mins. 4. She angrily told me I owed her $3.80 - she tried to charge me again for something I already paid for via app.5.  I asked for a free coffee, something, ANYTHING, since I had to wait 30 mins for a bagel with cc and bacon but of course - She was yet again rude and nasty and told me I can ask her to be thankful. Thankful for making me late to my meeting? Which again, it just so damn rude. This was my first time going to this establishment. I tried to talk to a manager and there apparently is not one available at regular hours. Only 730am-8am, which doesn't make sense to me. I tried calling over the phone to speak to a manager and when I asked his name, they put the phone down and left me off the hook.Learn how to treat your clientele.",3,,
6,Steven S.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",2,31,1,2.0,6/6/2018,"A coworker turned me onto this place a while back and I was wowed by what you get for the price. I've been here over a dozen times since. Sadly, over the course of these visits I have become more and more disheartened. (Though the staff are rather pleasant.)Here's the food breakdown (best to worst):Salad | 3/5They give you a few choices for salad between the spinach, green leaf, etc which is nice. Decent selection of add-ins and they aren't that pricey. You can get away with spending under $7 for a salad with a few veggies which is nice. Dressings are all supposedly fat free but I'm sure if that's true they just load it with salt and sugar (like most fat free dressings do). They mix it up in a bowl for you so the dressing is evenly spread. Minus points for the cross-contamination and thus not strict vegetarian friendly. It's a decent, cheap salad all-in-all. Tuna melt | 2/5The bread they use is nothing special -- not stale -- just not melt in your mouth delicious. The tuna salad is fine and not too mayo-ey which is a plus. Veggies are fine. Cheese is okay. Nothing wowing about this. Lost points when they couldn't melt the cheddar cheese enough. If for some silly reason you decide to order this go for a slice of cheese instead as it melts a little better. Pizza | 1/5Oy vey what a mess this is. Recently added to the menu and advertised out front, but this pizza is so awful it reminds me of the frozen crap you find at rest stops. No, wait, worse than rest stop pizza. The owners must be thinking ""well, we use NY water, we got a pizza oven, what else do we need?"" Hmmm, idk, maybe someone who can actually make decent pizza? Fresh ingredients? Or, idk, DON'T because you're not an Italian restaurant???Baked Ziti | 1/5Goodness. Another Rockwell's catastrophe. Let's keep it simple. The sauce is bland af. There was barely any cheese. The ziti was beyond overcooked. And ... wait, no, that's it, 3 simple ingredients -- all terrible. TL;DR: If your stomach and wallet are on a diet it's the cheapest salad you'll find downtown but go literally anywhere else for anything but that.",,,
7,Marci A.,"Manhattan, NY",55,317,179,3.0,5/6/2018,"Some things here are great, some are simply okay. It truly depends on the day that you come and what food they have.

One of my coworkers has an amazing burger and the other complained about her sandwich. I say give it a try but maybe ask around to see what's good and what isn't before you commit.",,,
8,Eric G.,"New York, NY",1,5,4,2.0,5/11/2018,"The prices are pretty high.  The food is typical NY deli food.  Don't eat the burger.  They pre-cook them, and have them sitting in some kind of liquid (water?) until somebody orders one to keep them from drying out.  When you order one, they put it back on the grill and when you get it, it tastes like a car tire.  Twice, I asked for a fresh burger instead of the pre-cooked one.  Once, they claimed that they didn't have any more fresh ones.  I think it was a lie to get rid of the pre-cooked ones.  And the second time, they still gave me a pre-cooked one anyway.  I didn't notice it until I got back to the office when I thought about how quickly it ""cooked"".  I should pay more attention.The staff is not great.  They could use better attitudes.  At least pretend like you are happy to be there.

13,Melissa B.,"Moraga, CA",0,62,0,2.0,3/9/2017,"Good option for cheap grub in a part of town where that can be hard to find - but you don't want to eat the food on the premises. Sandwiches are average, they have an ATM machine and many drinks to choose from. You can get all the typical options for deli sandwiches, breads and meats and the usual NY fare. But... this place is FILTHY. Not because it's a hole in the wall joint in an older space, but because surfaces haven't been wiped down in days, it's obvious they don't mop the floors regularly, etc. it's like no one has a checklist to clean things up at the end of a shift.",1,1,

I'm spending a lot less than what I could easily be spending somewhere else for a lunch burger. Unfortunately, I found out quickly that I was paying for exactly what I was getting.Right off the bat, the burger was bland and not attractive at all. The patty was pretty flat on 2 plain old sesame buns. I had American cheese and pickles added to the burger, but it didn't really help the flavorless patty much. As for the fries, thumbs up for that at least. I'm not sure if they're fresh cut, but the slices were pretty thick and they weren't half bad. However, in the end, I was paying for the burger and not the fries so if the burger wasn't good then the meal was a failure. Beware of the burger special!",3,1,1

Everything's dirty, broken, leaning and by a trash can--they have multiple ones close to the cooking areas. You walk in and you want to immediately walk out. Shame on the owners or management for the condition of this store.But the service is quick and actually quite nice. And the pushover in me didn't want to say this place is too dirty for me to buy anything from, so I tried it and my egg, turkey bacon and cheese sandwich wasn't half bad.

The ""for the money"" and ""in the area"" part may seem suspiciously qualifying, so let me put it in more universal terms: Rockwell's sells a sizable, juicy, satisfying burger for $3.75, and for a few bucks more you'll also get bacon, fries, and a soda to go with it. I know I like to exaggerate, but seriously, that would be good pricing even at McDonald's, in the suburbs, in 1982. For a restaurant located in the happiness-and-money black hole that is the financial district, it qualifies as a goddamn miracle.Beyond the burgers, Rockwells sells any number of tasty lunch items, all for similarly reasonable prices. Okay, so the deli-meat sandwiches are pretty sub-par, and I have similar suspicions of the salad bar (not that I've tried it, or ever will, because as we all know, you don't win friends with salad) but everything else I've had here has ranged from good to pretty damn good. The grilled reuben, especially, was a delicious, greasy, enjoyably sloppy standout, similar to cigarettes in that it will in no uncertain terms slowly kill you, but man, will it take you to flavor country.From me, four stars is usually a signifier that a place is worth going out of your way for, and while Rockwell's isn't that, it is however a Godsend of a cheap, tasty lunch counter to have nearby your haplessly located place of business.",9,5,1

I will try more from this place",,,
50,Lisa T.,"Chicago, IL",161,291,1,3.0,1/6/2013,"Standard mom-and-pop deli in an otherwise dead food zone (especially after Sandy). These guys bounced back and are serving with a smile. Place gives you a much better vibe than anything else I've seen around. Prices are better too, I would say, especially if you take advantage of their deals. I've only done eggs and sandwiches, will try soup and salad soon.",1,,
51,David B.,"Manhattan, NY",45,367,4,1.0,1/28/2013,"1.5 stars. Ordered spicy chicken parm which was not spicy at all, it also was not true chicken parm. It was cut into many portions and had little flavor. The mac n cheese was not good either and the mashed potatoes were average as the sides. I would not recommend this place but the portions were big.",,1,
52,Jersey G.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,23,0,4.0,8/15/2013,Service is really fast  if u r in a hurry.Tabasco chicken platter is out of this world. The sauce is awesome.  Generally they have this on FridaysMy other all time fav is chipotle chicken panini with avocado.,,,
53,Ira M.,"New York, NY",29,219,28,3.0,1/18/2013,"Not the best deli in the area, but certainly not the worst either.  Sort of middle of the road.  When I come here I usually get the spicy chicken in a wrap.  Sandwiches come with a bag of chips and fountain drink...so I guess you could call it a good deal.",,,
54,Jonathan S.,"New York, NY",41,159,19,4.0,1/19/2011,"Tuna Melt! I've been hitting up Rockwell's since '04 and it hasn't changed. The space is clean and efficient much like the service. The food is decent and fairly priced. You're not going to be finding any of their menu on the Food Network but their Tuna Melt is a great standby. It's not fancy or particularly special, it's just a good, honest tuna melt. The bread is soggy from being browned in what i can only imagine is butter and stuffed appropriately with tuna and cheddar melting out the sides. One negative, watch out for peak lunch hours, it can get busy.",,,
55,Shaney W.,"Brooklyn, NY",157,78,288,1.0,2/16/2014,I would order from here every other day  usually the veggie burger with fries the last time my bf went and they gave him a turkey burger tried twice to fix it the cook argued me down I will not go back the owners are nice though smh,1,,
56,Kelly A.,"Seaside Park, NJ",40,11,0,3.0,2/20/2013,"I came here for lunch today, it was quite good! I got a quesadilla, pretty standard chicken and cheese, but I liked that it came with rice, sour cream, salsa, and guacamole. I would eat here again, I would like to try their sandwiches and other menu items.",,,
57,Big B.,"New York, NY",257,686,16,2.0,7/30/2014,Their for was meh and the place is just so so. But I have to say that the guy who makes sandwich is working really fast and really passionate about his job! This is good!,,,
58,Billie F.,"Mineola, NY",63,230,6,3.0,2/24/2012,"The food here is...OK. Its a deli/sandwich place. Tons of these in the area. Great for a quick on the go breakfast. They'll make basically any breakfast sandwich however you want it, which is nice. I tend to always go for the healither option, egg whites, swiss and turkey sausage on a roll. They make it rather fast as well. Since this place is literally right across the street its a good option.",,,
59,Dan M.,"Dallas, TX",4,16,3,5.0,8/26/2008,"5 Stars for Rockwells!  Yes, we aren't talking about gourmet food here, but for the price you can not beat this place.  They have lunch specials daily for $6.45 that include a bag of chips and a soda.  Most of the specials are wraps, but you can ask them to put the same special together with a roll if you prefer.  Becareful of the spicy thai chicken, it is quite possibly the hottest wrap I have ever experienced, and I normally like spicy food.  My absolute favorite is the burger.  Best hangover cure available.",3,1,3
60,Renee M.,"New York, NY",128,342,21,3.0,11/4/2008,"Alright so i know that one can not expect much esp in the finance district in the hours of 12-3 AKA Lunch suicide time...Well Rockwells is what you can expect semi-yum food for a reasonable price for the area so i agree with the peeps comments before me BUT and this is a big BUT...the service from the psycho lady manning the cash register is hilarious!!! and unncecessary.....She practically grabs your food from your hands thrusts it into a bag, yells at you to sign your reciept and then proceeds to call you MAMI get yo dang reciept when you leave...It was both a frightening and funny experience for me. I wasnt 100% sure whether to ask if she was on meds or run for my life. I chose the latter.So if your looking for a place with decent wraps and burgers come here ....",3,3,1
61,Chris J.,"Manhattan, NY",215,231,0,2.0,7/12/2007,"Someone should nickname this place Houdini because it switches up on you like magic.Let me preface this review by saying that I have eaten here a handful of times and have consistently had the same experience.My experience through the first three bites of my sandwich- 5 star (as I am SHOCKED by the value of food I've just gotten for such a reasonable price at a place so close to work).My experience halfway through the sandwich-1star (you start to get that feeling in your stomach, like, I just had a Rockwell's sandwich, and everyone at work sees the drastic change in my demeanor and just laughs and says, ""You just had a Rockwell's moment.""  I just laugh as I hold back the vomit in my mouth, knowing that I've fallen again for this Houdini of sandwiches).Rockwell's is right across the street from where I work, so it's often times a no brainer. I've been there on several occassions because the prices are so reasonable.  I justify each rotten experience by telling myself that I just haven't found the right 'thing' on the menu.  A good thing is that they have lunch specials and all that other jazz.Ehh it is what it is (my stomach is churning).   Not my go to for lunch around this area.",1,2,2
62,Gabe F.,"London, United Kingdom",12,92,8,3.0,6/12/2007,"I've had lunch here a few times and ordered dinner many times.  I wouldn't classify it as the best food but it's very good for the price, it is cheap!  The portions are large, especially for the dinner selections, and they have a wide variety of food to match the mood you're in.  A favorite choice of mine is the cajun grilled chicken sandwich. It's also one of the few places that carries offers Dr. Pepper as a soda choice.Note:  I've mostly ordered from Rockwell's through seamlessweb.",,,

64,Wendy W.,"New York, NY",3,149,14,4.0,11/3/2010,"I made a delivery order the other night and it came super fast and piping hot. Fries were fresh from the fryer and the grilled cheese hit the spot. The cheeseburger was alright but left a weird aftertaste. Though for $4 it was fine. Another added bonus, I did a seamless order and that took off 25% from the bill. Food plus tip came out to just $10 so I will definitely be ordering from here again! =)",,,
65,nybiggurlchaser b.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,23,13,1.0,7/1/2010,yuk  dirty  they use the same towel to wipe down counters to wipe the knife cutting your sandwich workers are real rude and aprons are dirty,1,,
