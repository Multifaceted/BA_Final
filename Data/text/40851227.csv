1,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,4.0,3/20/2018,"I haven't been here in years and I'm not entirely sure why. Happy hour is cheap. Happy hour exists on the weekends. Things I didn't know when meeting up with an old friend for a pint on St. Patrick's day. I feel like we hit the jackpot as far as crowd control goes for these kinds of things. There were no assholes in this bar. It wasn't packed. Plenty of seating in case it did get packed. Several decent beers on tap for under $4-5. Guinness, Magners, IPAS, Genesee ale, Narragansett, etc. Find the little round tables in the back funny because it looks like a set up for a divey diner but there's no food sold in here. You can bring some in, which I did with my loaf of Irish soda bread.",3,1,5

4,Arthur S.,"New York, NY",64,49,52,4.0,3/7/2017,"You swiped right. So did they. You propose meeting face-to-face at the magician. They agree. You exchange several messages before deciding on a day. The night-of arrives and neither of you have ghosted each other. You arrive during happy hour and order a $3 well drink . It's cash only, but there's an ATM just outside. Your date arrives 15 minutes late. You exchange an awkward hello. They ask what you do for a living. You feel dead inside. The small talk continues. You think about leaving, but it's only 7:45 and happy hour goes until 8pm. You order another round. Suddenly, you're both feeling tipsy. Your date tells you their father just died. The funeral's tomorrow. You don't know what to say. You walk away and never text them again.",4,13,2

6,Roy B.,"Huntington, NY",396,472,325,3.0,9/18/2016,"After a work function on Saturday, we weren't ready to go home just yet so we decided to wander the LES looking for a quiet place to have a drink and wind down. We had gone to several places in the surrounding area and for the most part on a weekend night, they were so loud that you couldn't hear yourself think.Enter the Magician, like heaven to our auditory systems. We came inside and although there were quite a few patrons, the music was at a tolerable level and we were able to hear each other talk well enough.Spartan in its decor, Magician doesn't try to be something it's not. The bar along the right wall is big enough to seat perhaps 20-25 people and in front and along the left side there are smallish diner tables. Think 1950's Formica and chrome for the effect. The chairs are distressed painted and fairly comfortable for a ladder-back style chair. The walls have very few nondescript pictures on them and if there is a theme, it has escaped me. Surprisingly, the place is very deep and I wouldn't be shocked if you told me they could house 175 or so people.Drink prices were fair for the city and the bartenders were quick to fill an order. On a strange note, I for sure noticed someone at the bar having food delivered from somewhere else. Whether they worked there or not, I'm not sure. Nor am I sure if this establishment serves food. I can only tell you that we for sure would go back to have a drink if we were in the area.",10,7,6
7,Mike B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",184,1505,174,4.0,6/12/2016,"it would seem that I checked in to the wrong Magician bar on the mobile app. was it excitement, was it exhaustion, or was it sleight of hand? the world will never know.The Magician is my kind of bar. inexpensive, laid-back, casual, and surprisingly spacious with ample seating (it looks small, but there's a whole big back room). happy hour goes until 8. the music isn't loud. the bartenders are friendly.it's unpretentious, and a reminder that not everything in this damned city has to be a $15 drink made with artisanal locally-sourced fair-trade organic honey. sometimes you just want to slam down Jameson and Rolling Rock without breaking your wallet, and that's the greatest trick of them all.",9,3,5
8,Mallory F.,"Leesburg, VA",124,15,0,5.0,3/13/2017,"I was visiting NYC with friends and had a great time. The happy hour is great, the drinks are good, and the atmosphere is fun. It's a simple bar that isn't trying to be anything except, quite literally, a bar. They don't serve food and it's cash only so be forewarned. The real highlight, though, was the bartender. We didn't catch his name (very sadly) but he was a really friendly guy who made conversation, gave good recommendations, and was totally willing to roll with our weird cocktail requests. We got him McDonalds and he was one of the highlights of our trip.",2,,3

Awesome place, very relaxed laid back bar. Fyi no matter how old you look, make sure you bring your id. Lady checking ids doesnt play around. A beer & a rum and coca cola $6.50. Omg what?!?! Awesome. The bar is large and there is plenty of seating. Tables in the front, alongside the bar and the back. I am so happy I found this place. Btw it is cash only. So come prepared to have a great time. I'm definitely going back.",1,1,2

15,Denise F.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,123,17,5.0,3/16/2016,"I have a soft spot for the Magician. Its my idea of the perfect bar, with its tiled floor, low lighting, low key vibe and exceptional 90s Jukebox.  This bar fell out of my happy hour dreams with $3 wells and beers.You can walk by it a thousand times and not walk in but its perfect for groups and just by yourself. I celebrated my 27th here last year - fed the jukebox $7 before I realized the Garbage album I wanted to hear was in fact missing (i hope its replaced!).Come for the happy hour, stay for the Jukebox classics.All thats missing is some skeeball in my opinion :)",,,

You simply cannot beat $3 well drinks (we also got $3 tequila shots). It is a laid back atmosphere. The bartender was so cool. She looks like Carol from The Walking Dead. She made pretty decent drinks, the place was clean and makes for a good pre-game spot because again... you can't beat $3 drinks. It's cash only and there's no food here but ""Carol"" told us there's a pretty good taco place nearby and she said we could bring food in which was fairIf you want cheap drinks in this area this would be your go to spot",1,,
19,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",748,432,173,1.0,2/12/2014,"The moment when you thought you found an awesome new place, but you take a sip of your drink and it tastes and smells like urine. To be specific, it was a Magners Hard Cider on draft--which is normally reliable--and it tasted like the glass was dunked in a toilet prior to serving. Needless to say I did not finish my $3.50 glass of cider and proceeded to loiter for 2 hours at a table instead. It would have been a nice place to sit and chat with cheap (cash only) drinks, but sorry I will not be returning as to avoid drinking another glass of urine.",2,2,
20,Yifen J.,"Kyoto, Japan",318,358,165,3.0,5/11/2014,"Solid divey spot that's surprisingly spacious for its LES location.  They have $7 beer and shot specials, and they are quick and efficient even when the place is  filled to the brim. If you can snag a table in the back, you're a winner- you are now out of the way of main foot traffic and can sit and chat (relatively) undisturbed.  Staff will occasionally walk around to collect used beer and shot glasses to make sure their bar doesn't run out of glasses. Help the nice people out and bring your used glasses back yourself.",1,1,
21,Hanna C.,"New York, NY",275,24,0,4.0,12/19/2016,"As a cash-only place, with limited bar options, the Magician has a really chill and hip atmosphere. The lighting was dark red and the low music allowed for different groups of people to chat at round tables and enjoy the cozy atmosphere. I went with 4 others and since the space isn't very big, I would say a larger group might find it too small. The pleasant atmosphere provides a nice space for couples and smaller groups. I would definitely recommend if you don't want a huge and rowdy atmosphere. Cash only is a tiny bit of a pain, but it was a nice place to go and I would always recommend.",,,
22,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1578,1618,380,3.0,8/25/2014,"Good option to know about if you're in the 'hood during happy hour, and in need of a cheap watering hole.  Mind you, outside of happy hour, and/or if you have more mid-to-top shelf tastes, not that different pricing from most midtown/outer-borough spots.  However, awesome that a dive bar has some nice top shelf options.  And the bartender was super nice, accommodating, and gave no judgment when I asked for a Hendricks martini with a twist (and it was made quite nicely, with the rim properly rubbed with citrus).I liked the open space in the back.  The crowd tended to go toward one demographic, but everyone seemed to be quite welcomed.  Though, yeah....it gets eerily odd when that jukebox stops going....(drop them dollars, son!)....And, most importantly, Magner's on tap!!!  ALWAYS good to know (ran $7/pint).",,1,
23,Anna P.,"Manhattan, NY",152,20,1,1.0,8/29/2015,"I second the review that said the bartender checking IDs doesn't play around.  I'm of the legal drinking age and have never had a fake ID in my life, but she asked to see it twice, told me I didn't look like my picture, and then, when she came over to check my friend's, said, ""At least this one has a picture that looks like you.""  Either kick me out if you think it's fake or drop the subject, but don't take my money and continue to say things like that.  It was (and is) a real ID and I don't really know what a bartender expects you to say to prove it.This is, for the record, the first bad review I've ever written of any establishment.  I used to work at a restaurant and have great sympathy for people in the service industry, but I almost left because of this.  I would advise women 21+ who look young and don't want to be insulted to stay away.",,2,
24,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",956,918,1252,4.0,4/26/2013,"No-frills hangout! We stumbled in after being unamused by some dive around the corner (Motor City?) that was gross and way too loud. Disregard the neon signage in its window; the Magician is nothing like that. The space is dim and a little divey, but bare, with high ceilings and hex-tiled floors - a little more Brooklyn, a little less Detroit. It's perfect for a small group, or people who want to do their own thing and are neither out to be seen, nor interested in seeing anything. That sounds negative but it's not. Want to brood in solitude at the bar? Sure. Want to get up and dance like it's nobody's business? No problem. Want to PDA it up in a corner with your sweetie? Go ahead. Want to bring your Magic (ha! ha!) cards and calculate manna into the wee hours? Actually, that's perfect.The woman checking IDs inside was super friendly and came by our table to give props to our friend who had zoned out of our conversation on consciousness and collective vaginas and was swaying in his chair, groggy-eyed, to the music....The music the whole time was the opposite of what I wanted to hear (Warm smell of colitas-! rising up through the air-! ...and then... Lola! El oh el ay Lola!) but it was jukebox-regulated, so my fault for not commandeering the thing.On a Friday past midnight it wasn't too hectic - people hover at the tables near the front/bar, but there's a whole roomful of more tables toward the back. Drinks are surprisingly cheap (well + whiskey were $13 together) and not weak. Bartender was attentive and speedy with no need for flagging, which is awesome considering how crowded the bar area was and the fact that I seem to be perpetually obscured by beer taps.Come with: cash, good company. There is an elementary-school-cafeteria feel to this place, so have your posse on hand.",8,5,4

27,Tina C.,"Queens, NY",1966,4132,9742,2.0,10/22/2010,"It was not a magical experience for me here at the Magician. Recently I've been notoriously well known for being late in keeping with appointments; social gatherings, events, and including on the job.  However, the one time when I arrive early the honored birthday individual was a disappointingly ""no show"" as I appeared evasive circulating the whole venue inquiring ""are you Shannon?"" Thus, I moved onwards to met with a good friend who was available for comfort from a ""no show"" planned event.A full-service bar only serving patrons who are of age as the female gate keeper shrew fully inspects valid photo identification in compliance with New York State legal drinking age limit.  N.B.

29,Patrick N.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,7,3,4.0,4/15/2015,"I rated this place 4 stars only because they are cash only.Aside from being cash only, me and my friends absolutely love this bar. It's one of those few bars in the city where you generally want to start if you're bar hopping. It's generally quiet and empty and you'll want know when to head out when it starts getting crowded. They open at 5pm and it usually gets crowded around 7pm. It thins out again later when people start going for dinner but I've never been around to catch when that happens. They have happy hour right as they open which is half off shots and beers. They also have a special for $7 beer and shot. Outside of the happy hour, I'd recommend migrating to your next location.",,,
30,Lucy C.,"New York, NY",131,1173,43,2.0,6/11/2014,"Cheapest mixed drinks I've ever seen in Manhattan. But I really wasn't feeling the place, which felt like a large, abandoned saloon. Perhaps I went on the wrong night, but no one was there and I don't even remember if there was any music. Be warned, it is cash only which made things really annoying.",2,,

The Magician?""The Magician is a standard, no frills bar that happens to feature relatively cheap drinks and a large space. The crowds that frequent the arena are of the more chill and laid back variety. The happy hour is one of the better deals in the city, and even moreso for the LES. I would recommend this spot as somewhere you would want to take a couple friends and enjoy a chill night with a round of drinks; as long as you're in the 5pm-8pm bracket. The space definitely allows for it and it is not so loud or overcrowded that you can't maneuver. Can be a little bit crowded when it's late Thursday-Saturday nights.***CaSh OnLy***",1,,
32,David W.,"Manhattan, NY",2,8,2,4.0,7/24/2014,"My friends and I stumbled onto this magical place (har har) a few years ago and instantly fell in love. Cheap drinks (when you compare it to everything else in Manhattan) during happy hour and barely anyone inside. It is one of the best kept secrets in New York even after The Gothamist decided to write about it. Despite that, The Magician has maintained its charm.It's a shame, and a blessing, this place isn't more popular. There will be times when it becomes packed and you can barely move. There will be even more times when it's just you and your friend asking for a beer and the bartender has to go and change the keg and comes back up with a black eye due to said keg falling on her.After a few drinks, you may find yourself hungry. You can leave and bring back outside food. Or, why even leave? Just get another round of drinks, order outside food and watch as everyone else in the room become confused when you and your friends are scarfing down two pizza pies brought in by a delivery guy.Don't be mistaken though. This place is a complete dive: the bathrooms are a bit dingy, the music people put on the jukebox can be terrible, the decor is non-existent and the service at the bar is on par with every other location in the Lower East Side, but all of it make up the experience of The Magician. Don't be a jerk to the staff and they, in turn, will be indifferent right back to you. Just pay (cash only) and drink. Win-win.",1,1,1
33,Christina F.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,289,11,3.0,4/21/2014,"Came here for happy hour and stayed long enough to see the crowd shift from the hh crowd to the late nighters. Fun 1950's decor, functioning jukebox with a nice selection of songs, great happy hour specials ($2.50 canned beers, $3 wells, and $3.50 drafts)...what wasn't there to like? Pluuuus, I read that they apparently don't care if you bring food from outside there to eat so my hungry ass got a side of medium McDonald's fries and tore that shiz up. People may or may not have been giving me judging looks, but was it the Mickey D's? Were they just hungry too? Who knows.The bar almost felt a bit too big at times, and I would've appreciated a smaller, more intimate space in addition to a smidge more light, but not that big of a deal. The crowds that find their way there (at least for the night I was there) were less rowdy and much more chill. They were there to hang out and drink in what seemed to be moderation...but perhaps this changed after the midnight hour. I guess this is good to keep in mind if you're wondering where The Magician falls in your evening drinking schedule.Also, if you manage to snag one of the two booths by the front, the shadows cast  from the street lights and wooden blinds that cover the storefront windows make you feel like you're in a deeply intense film noir movie.

It's a simple, no-nonsense joint with clean decor reminiscent of the kinds of bars you'd find in a working-class town in the early sixties minus the wood paneling and neon Stroh's sign.

When my friends and I left Rockwood to go to a place called ""The Magician"" in the LES, my first thought was ""ooooh this place is going to be dark and mysterious"". That's what you think of when you hear the name, right? I was fooled! We walked into a diner with Barry M and Neil Diamond playing on the jukebox. The old-school barstools resembled an old ice cream shop. I felt very uncomfortable walking in at 1am! The bathrooms were repulsive, with toilets that refused to flush and doors that didn't lock. There was only one bartender working in this packed joint too!I was expecting red velvet curtains, dark walls, gold ropes with tassels holding them back and top hats. I pictured a security guard with a wand, rabbits and cards! I guess my imagination runs wild when I hear a name such as ""The Magician"" but I felt totally duped! When you open a bar on the LES and call it a familiarly descriptive name, you need to be careful. I might have liked it a bit more, had it been called ""Duke's Parlor"" or something along those lines (a bit). The only plus: we were able to get 15 people in easily, sit at a booth in the back and hear each other talk. Sorry, but no magic will bring me back to this place.",2,2,

45,Mark A.,"Austin, TX",251,158,81,3.0,2/25/2012,"Never have I had to do so little work to win over the love of a bartender. My normal strategy at a bar is to be as unnoticeable as possible. This means making minimal eye contact, ordering drinks succinctly and without any friendly chit chat, paying promptly and then disappearing into the back of the bar so the bartender doesn't talk to me. This is a horrible strategy, and I have no idea why I follow it, but it's all I've got. So imagine my surprise when I ordered a round of beers for our group, left a $1 tip per beer, and was immediately told that we were the best customers they'd had all night and that we could do pretty much anything we wanted. The bartender was also impressed by the fact that we all had sleeves on our shirts. Considering it was 35 degrees outside I didn't really feel like we had gone out of our way to class things up, but that was before I saw the dude wearing a Cosby sweater with the sleeves ripped off. And he was one of the more normal characters in the bar. There was definitely a weird crowd in the bar that night, but it was big enough that there was enough breathing room between groups to prevent any weird interactions or unwanted shirt sleeve ripping.Between the super nice (if a bit tired looking) bartenders and the unbeatable low prices ($3 or $4 for a draught beer), I can't really find anything to complaint about with The Magician. It is cash only, so be prepared for that.",3,7,2
46,Nick K.,"San Francisco, CA",473,639,61,3.0,2/5/2010,"Pros:- Happy hour ($3.50 pints, $2.50 well, cheap bottles) until 8 PM- Free trail mix!- Excellent neon clocksCons:- Debating whether to tip or withhold the 50 cents- Trail mix can be super salty- Usually empty and quiet (if no one is feeding the juke)Verdict:Cool name but not necessarily a cool place. Make sure to get here for happy hour and leave shortly after. The beer selection isn't bad and the well drinks are dirt cheap. The tenders can be a bit on the sassy side, but it's what you expect from a bar that caters to cheapskates like me.",2,2,2

The people behind the bar are always friendly and there's a jukebox. The selection isn't quite as current as I'd like but when I put on Sweet Caroline you could hear the merry singing along from various patrons in the bar and that's ultimately what you want with a jukebox right? Oh - super bonus - the several coat racks throughout the bar. With the room they have, it's so much nicer than hooks on the wall in 1 place.It's a great go-to bar for me when I'm in that area :)",,,

I've just never seen anything like it. I'm hoping she was just having a bad night, but I saw her being like this with every person that went through the front door. Then again, if I was a middle-aged woman that looked like Scary Spice and was working the front door at a bar, maybe I would be bitter as well. Regardless, I really hope management has a chat with her about this attitude, because honestly my group and I were so put off by it, we'd rather just go to Fat Baby across the street. I know a 10-second interaction shouldn't seem like a big deal, but it really sets the mood for the place and lowers the expectations.The bartenders and other staff are great.",,,

Although the crowd was still consistent, the music was cranked up to 11 and when you can't sit at the bar, your relegated to some super lame seating. Sorry, but the 50s diner chairs aren't cutting it. I'm not saying the should redecorate this place in hipster dive bar chic, but there are better options. Beer selection is great. Prices fair.

Whoa.  Even though this was a pub crawl so we were only supposed to have one drink at each bar we ended up staying at this bar longer and each having two drinks.The bartender was really nice and came over to our table to check IDs even though she was the only one working.  Also she warned us that the happy hour ended at 8 (it was around 7) and there would be a mad rush for the bar around 7:45 so we should plan accordingly.  What useful advice.  She was really nice and I would certainly go back here for a night of (cheap) heavy drinking.,1,,

Why's that a problem? It's an issue when inevitably my friends and I huddle around while one or two people of our people are sitting at the bar. Inevitably we're in the way of everyone trying to get by and everyone gets all frustrated and mad when all I want to do is have a drink and chill.Poor layout for getting people to the seats and back.

You can't complain about this place. They also give out these bowls of homemade Chex mix that if the owner has any business sense, should pre-package and sell retail.The only thing that's stopping this place from getting 5 stars is that my bartender was male and I didn't get to make crude comments and then apologize profusely to look endearing.",,,
69,Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",719,1501,1720,4.0,3/12/2008,"The Magician is a real bar where you can just kick back and relax. Attitudes are left behind and this is a place where anyone can fit in. You can bring your own dinner in, you can snuggle up with your boo as if you were the only ones in the room, you can dance to your own beat when no one else is dancing, you can get sloshed, or you can just have a few drinks and catch up which is what me and my friends ended up doing.Damn drinks were cheap! Seriously, you could drink 2 for the price of 1. $5 drinks and no cover. Plus plenty of seating. I could have stayed here all night. With good company and good drinks, it could never get old. I don't really understand why the bar is called The Magician. From the checkered floor to the jukebox to the round tables, it was a cross between a saloon and a 50's diner. But it didn't matter because all that mattered was that we had stumbled upon a bar that was comfortable, inviting, and cozy. Plus you can have a decent conversation without yelling. The lighting is perfect and the service is quick. There is no waiting or pushing through at the bar. The bouncer is friendly. He has a comment for everyone who walks through the door.

Of course, you can always buy a paper bag and bring your 40 to Port Authority and you'll find a seat there too.Okay, I'm getting a little worried that you'll read this review and think I'm some pretentious hipster who doesn't like this place because it doesn't have a theme or great interior design or something.

98,Eugene G.,"Jersey City, NJ",7,4,0,4.0,3/15/2010,"Just one caveat before I begin: I've only been to this place once.I can summarize The Magician in 2 magic words: Cheap booze.I met some friends here on a Friday night for happy hour which, if I'm not mistaken, runs from 5-8. I got a generous helping of vodka on the rocks (I don't know what brand it was, but for $3 it could have come from their bathtub and I wouldn't have cared) and the service was quick and friendly. Amazingly, the bar wasn't that crowded and there was plenty of room to sit, even at about 8.I should note that the middle-aged bartender (we'll call her Edith) garnered some complaints from two of my companions after they asked her for multiple drinks right before the end of happy hour. I won't hold that against Edith because she always served me quickly and helpfully and because, come on now, that's terrible bar etiquette. Besides, the drinks only went up to $5 after happy hour.I would describe the decor as ""Your Grandma's Kitchen"" chic, which is to say there are some crappy tables on old tiles and they turn the lights down and booze you up to the point where you don't notice or care. If you're looking for atmosphere, though, you're at a LES happy hour where you're getting drinks for $3, so don't be ridiculous. This is the perfect place to unwind with friends after a long week, particularly one that has drained you of your hard-earned cash. The Magician understands, and it's here to help.",,1,

The place was empty except for one couple sitting at the bar. A nice change from the douchebag laden bars in socal. The bar tender was the coolest person I met in New York. I think just as soon as he put Robert Johnson on jukebox we decided our choice was good. He was so easy going and fun to talk to we ended up staying hours longer than we had planned. We enjoyed plenty of fine beers from ""across the river"" and laughed till it hurt listening to his stories of storming the beaches in Nebraska. It was the best way to end our trip to New York. I totally hate California now.",,,

In an age when every bar has some sort of gimmick going, The Magician refreshingly and perhaps ironically doesn't have any tricks up its sleeve.There's plenty of seating at the bar and there's a back room for larger groups as well, which is where our posse of fifteen or so positioned ourselves this past Saturday.  What's cool is, since they don't serve their own food, you can bring in food from other places that are nearby;  we had food from a Middle Eastern joint, a pizza place and a Japanese vegan eatery! You'd think I'd be able to do dry cleaning as well... Both of the bartenders on duty were totally cool but more importantly could pour a stiff drink. At one point in the night, one of my friends didn't have enough cash so the bartender said just come back when you do? WTF, in a good way (my friend Ranit went to an ATM and came back 30 minutes later to pay off the tab, and the bartender replied that she just set the tone for good times for the rest of the evening). The jukebox is a treat as well, and I managed to get on a good mix of Bowie, The Beatles, Bill Withers and The Cure for my two bucks.  I could go on, but this is already a lot to write about a pretty regular, unpretentious bar, so I'll just end the review just like that.",5,2,4

But I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was, it had that grungy bathroom-tile floor and long bar on the right with tables just about everywhere; it's definitely a group spot. whoever was selecting stuff on the jukebox was an idiot, but they had some good stuff (it's a digital one). I had a problem, and like a lot of bars in the LES nowadays, with the crowd. You had some cool cats and kittens and whatnot, but seriously what's with the yuppies. I couldn't fucking stand them, they were heckling my shirt all night and I totally went up to one of them and was like you got a problem, then we've got problems.But more hilarity was when one of our friends came a little later, and I was talking to my friend, and when they greeted, they just started making out, I'm talking she came up to him, and it was like two vacuums going at it, it was so forceful she was leaning backward like face-grabbing forceful. the rest of our group was like, uh what the forkfuck. I guess this had been going on for a week or two already and it came to a head.At least he made out with another girl by the time the night was over. Mike you are a player, the most unkempt player ever.Anywho, the other embarrassing point in the night, and I don't know why I always am a self-defeating SOB, but this girl who actually liked my shirt was like:""what if i gave you my shirt to wear, and I wore your shirt?""me being an idiot, for some reason the first thing that came out of my mouth was, ""well, uh, my boobs are fake.""She responded with, ""Well, so are mine""and of course, I ruined it for myself.

The guy at the door checks my ID and I'm cool and takes a look at my friend's... he said she looked too dressed up for her ID pic, but let us in anyways.The interior is pretty laid back. They have the bar section, tables and chairs in the front, and a ""lounge"" area in the back. We sat at the bar at first, then switched to the tables when the rest of our party arrived. The drinks were cheap. 5 bucks for beer is good for me! We didnt order any mixed drinks, but the price shouldnt be too bad. The bartender was real nice and the atmosphere was cool. Music was pumpin, and within a half hour the placed got PACKED!!

The place wasn't hopping when I got there either time; but was filled to the brim by the time I left. Not annoying so. It has charm and it has atmosphere.The bartender (a woman, I wish I could remember her name- she reminds me of Andy Barcley's mom in Child's Play 2) is amazing. She mixed tequila with fruit juices into this amazing unnamed concoction which makes me forget everything but my first name.

I just know my beers were $3.50 until around 8pm. Interesting selection of beers given the size of the place, besides your standard Brooklyn (draft) and Stella (bottle), they also had some more unique ones (for me) like the Victory Pilsner, Peak Organic Pale Ale & Southhampton Double White. They also serve a nut mix as a bar snack, which I'm told is a hallmark of a great bar by M. Friendly bartenders and relaxed patrons. Not sure what this place is like on a weekend night, but it was a perfect place for a little catch up with E.",,,

S.,"NY, NY",24,179,1,4.0,8/13/2007,"I'm always disapointed by the Magician - everytime I go, the bartender never EVER pulls a rabbit out of a hat.  The best she can do is pour me a beer in exchange for some of my presidential collection but for 5 dollars, I can't really complain.  I probably shouldn't have made a joke that has been made 1 million times before. Ah well.The Magician is the perfect bar for groups.  The room is split into two sections with the bar in one and a large back room covered with tables that are easy to move around and chairs for the hundreds of internet friends that you drink with every day in your head.  The jukebox is filled with good music that's sure to get you drunkenly swaying along to late 90s goo goo dolls or your favorite mid 90s apple commerical.  The booze is cheap and cocktails are only 5 bucks though the bar tender does take smoke breaks and the bar shuts down then because they only seem to have 1 person on staff at all times. The bouncer at the door checks everyone's ids so if you're old and you get carded, you don't look young - that's just something they do here.  And if that hurts your self esteem, there are some kick ass cupcakes (or so I heard) down the block so feel free to fill up and bring some back to the bar for your friends.  They'll appreciate it.",,1,

147,Margarita V.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,133,0,4.0,4/26/2007,"This is a good, basic, affordable bar suitable for casual group outings.  There's a terrific happy hour, spacious back room, and decent juke box.  The only odd thing about this place is the tiled floors; they give the space a slightly clinical, antiseptic feel.  I wouldn't go as far as calling this place a dive, though.  It's not as rough around the edges as, say Iggy's or anything.",1,,1
148,Nick P.,"West Hollywood, CA",379,178,41,4.0,10/19/2008,"Very relaxed, mellow place with cheap drinks and a nice outdoor patio. Could have done without the Woody Guthrie on the jukebox though.",1,,1
149,Lisa Y.,"New York, NY",32,101,3,3.0,2/10/2008,"It's your no-frills bar with a lot of space, rarely crowded, and a few tv's to divert attention from your lackluster friends/date.  This is a good pre-bar-hopping spot.",1,,
150,Lani P.,"Providence, RI",0,20,0,4.0,10/1/2009,"Cheap drinks and a good crowd.  Relatively spacious and I didn't have to wait that long for a drink.  I'm not a regular or anything, but I would go back.  Pretty chill, but still decent people watching.",,,
151,Jeannette A.,"Raleigh, NC",323,162,7,5.0,1/28/2011,i love the magician - mostly cause the bartenders are AWESOME.,,,
152,Euphrosini S.,"New York, NY",211,160,3,3.0,3/24/2009,"i feel like I shouldn't be reviewing this place since all I remember about it  is noting the name so I wouldn't be made to go back. So you can take that into consideration for the very low rating but if I'm that drunk and not having a good time... it can't be that great.EDIT: I changed my mind... mainly because I met friends there for Happy Hour and well drinks were $2.50 which is pretty impossible to find in the city.  Especially in a place with working bathrooms, lots of seating, and pretty clean in general.",,,
153,Liz B.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,4.0,1/15/2006,"Everyone I know who's been to this bar likes it or loves it, and it's been repeatedly publicly loved on by the Gawker crowd.  Yet, it's often sort of empty, especially on weeknights, and even during the dirt-cheap happy hour ($2.50 mixed drinks).  Even on Friday sometiimes!  Why do I like the atmosphere so much?  Is it wrong to say it feels like a day spa (except that it's a nighttime bar)?  Black and white tiled floor, lots of tables painted all crazy-like, cool people, lovely music/jukebox.  Of course, everyone says how it's never crowded, which will make lots of people go to check how how uncrowded it is, which will make it crowded.  Whatevs.",,,1
154,Leanne L.,"New York, NY",11,49,0,4.0,1/16/2009,"This is a fun, unpretentious little place. I like the café tables and the tiled floor. It is definitely big enough for groups and there is room to dance to the jukebox in the back. Drinks are cheap, but it is cash only, so prepared.",,,
155,Erica Jade L.,"New York, NY",26,263,1,4.0,9/13/2007,"A friend had a party here a while back. We took over the whole back room and had a rockin good time doing it. The bartenders were great - didn't give anyone dirty looks for ordering water and they didn't give us shit for bringing in cupcakes and candy (ahem, Luca Lounge). Took off one star for the fluorescent lighting. Reminded me too much of work.",,,
156,Carson E.,"Brooklyn, NY",79,185,5,4.0,12/9/2007,"The only reason it doesn't get five stars is that it is cash only. This is a fantastic bar. These guys run two other bars with a similar vibe. All three have great jukeboxes, friendly bartenders, and reasonably priced drinks. Friday and Saturday nights can be a zoo...just like anywhere else in NYC. But the majority of the time, this place is chill, cool, reasonably priced, and fun. When my friends want to go out, it's one of the first places I think of to suggest.",,,
157,Bobby F.,"New York, NY",48,33,0,4.0,2/27/2006,"Good jukebox, chill atmosphere, friendly bar tenders, cash only. That about sums it up. No pretension, no hype, no Ms. Pacman, just drinks and good times. Probably the least trendy place left on Rivington. Enjoy it while it lasts!",,,
158,Jeff M.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,296,1,2.0,10/9/2008,"After years of hanging about the place, I relented. The gimmick here is cheap drinks, of course, and it delivers on that count. Luckily I've got haunt potential joints far closer to me, like Boat, that compare more favorably but I'm glad the blogosphere (for which this place has some magnetic attraction; must be the slave wages) has this, all the same.",,,
159,ben h.,"Austin, TX",15,130,0,4.0,7/1/2007,"way cool bar in alphabet city. laid back crowd, good drinks, and not freakin bling bling expensive. no pretension just people getting down to what we all need to do more of. drink, be merry, and drink more. the music selection was all over the place and i like that. the staff was incredibly nice and embraced us even though we were outsiders. they also helped us out w/ some way cool recommendations as to our next stops for the evening.",1,,1
160,Maiko K.,"Brooklyn, NY",49,38,3,4.0,10/29/2007,"This place has amazing happy hour deals.  It's something like $3 for a well drinks and $2.50 for beer til 8pm every night.  I love the checkered tiles and neon clocks on the walls.  It's very spacious with lots of tables in the back and the best part is, it's BYOFood!",1,,1
161,Colleen L.,"New York, NY",2,20,0,4.0,7/12/2006,"i just had my birthday party here (after having been here a few times before)... such a great, low key place.  even when it gets crowded with its hip, yet unpretentious crowd, you still feel like there's space to move around.  great music selection, good drinks, and i absolutely adore the black and white checkered floor and vintage-style tables and chairs!",1,,1
162,Peter G.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,72,0,5.0,8/18/2008,"A wide-open, spacious bar in the LES with a killer happy hour, good jukebox, and efficient staff.  One of the rare places where a very large group can congregate in total comfort.  The Magician stands out as unpretentious in a sea of otherwise dicey local spots.",1,,
163,Seiji C.,"San Francisco, CA",371,340,0,4.0,5/8/2008,"it's spacious, cheap for happy hour, and great for groups",,,
