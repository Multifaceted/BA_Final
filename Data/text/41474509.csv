0,Abe B.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",5,5,2,5.0,9/20/2018,"Y'all. This shake shack is stocked with some of the nicest employees in Manhattan! Smiling. Laughing. Talking to you as you order! Talking about what you order and wearing and everything. Super relatable. I literally never go to a shake shack in the city and have a good interaction as most employees say ""what do you want to eat?"" As where here they are FUN. From the registers to those prepping food, they all seem to have a good time. Way to go.",,,
1,Danan R.,"New York, NY",886,1843,43,4.0,9/13/2018,"This is a hidden Shake Shack gem with both indoor and outdoor seating that is spacious and friendly staff.  The line moves very quickly and it is typically much less hectic than the other locations.  Seating is also pretty easy to find which is rather rare in any other location.  It's a block away from the Cinepolis so great for grabbing a bite before or after.  The fare is your standard Shake Shack fare although I did notice that the burgers here are more carefully assembled and the bacon cheese fries are nicely loaded with a very sizable portion of bacon pieces.  Friendly and fast service, great food, and seating with a short line!  This is a Shake Shack that has achieved execution greatness.",2,1,1
2,Trisa T.,"New York, NY",199,402,586,2.0,9/5/2018,I love Shake Shack but this location is the worst when it comes to indoor seating. There's no where to really stand when you're waiting for food and it's always a mess in the outdoor eating space. The only good thing is the people are really nice,1,1,
3,Janice K.,"Manhattan, NY",36,53,84,4.0,10/31/2018,"OMG these crispy (processed) gooey cheese on fries. Eating wonders of this fatness. I always get these. Apparently this style of processed cheese-whiz is called ""american cheese"". We dont get them often in canada so they do wonders on my palate! YUMMMMMMMMM",2,,1
4,Nancy H.,"New York, NY",231,814,2139,5.0,7/19/2018,"Shake Shack bacon cheese fries are everything you ever dreamed of. The crispy chicken sandwich, a god send. I ordered to go and they packed everything up from the liquid cheese to the burger all in a box and a handy dandy bag.Eat the fries first and honesty, I liked the sandwich better when it was cold. Perfect cheese and bacon portions. Get some ketchup too. So good. Crunchy, salty, mmmmmm it was just amazing. Total of a little over $12, Shake Shack price point is on point. Water tap is around the corner from the cash registers. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Bathroom code is at the bottom of the receipt. Bathroom is always busy by the way.",3,1,2
5,Jenny L.,"San Francisco, CA",2,44,24,3.0,11/3/2018,So unhappy twitch this location!!!! They have the worst customer service and they put way too much salt in my burger ! Also they forgot my fries. I'm at home and I'm pissed off! Ruined my lunch !,,,
6,Marissa L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,187,388,5.0,8/4/2018,"Shake Shack is everywhere these days, but I still think this location is one of the better ones in Manhattan for a few reasons. The staff is friendly and quick, the line usually seems to be shorter and faster than other locations, and there is a lot of seating outside so it's much easier to find a table than at some of the others. It's just a more comfortable experience all around. The food quality is usually pretty standard across most Shacks, although I did think the burger assembly on my last visit here surpassed some recent visits to other branches. I got my usual - a single Shack burger with onions, pickles, and cherry peppers added, plus fries - and it still remains one of my favorite meals to order. Quick, efficient, and a great burger and fries - pretty much everything I'm looking for from Shake Shack!",,,1
7,Tani S.,"Bellevue, WA",33,492,182,5.0,6/24/2018,Having lived in California for a number of years as many reviewers have we compared this to our experience at In and Out.  For me this won hands down while my husband enjoyed it but still favors In and Out. The line was fast on a Sunday afternoon and loved the indoor/outdoor area for the location we chose.  We both had the Shackburger.  I loved how the outside was crispy and almost caramelized without the patty being dry.    The cheesy was delightfully gooey and I easily finished it off with the yummy crinkle cut fries.  After that many calories it was good that we were heading to Central Park afterwards!  My husband found the cheese to be too gooey and for this he prefers In and Out but conceded that their fries are much better...  Quite excited that they're opening an out post in Seattle..,,,
8,Hillary M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",37,7,1,4.0,11/7/2018,"The food is always great here!! Every time I come here I get a burger , French fries and a milkshake ! The wait is not that long but usually it gets busy and it's hard to find a place to sit inside . Overall I recommend this place if you happen to be on the upper east side .",,,
9,Priscilla C.,"Pasadena, CA",16,155,441,4.0,10/10/2018,"In my honest opinion, this place still cant beat the flavor of the burgers from In-n-out. However, just rating Shake Shack alone without comparing it to In-n-out, the burgers and fries are pretty darn good. We got the cheeseburger, the crispy chciken burger, and thr fries with melted cheese. I really enjoyed the crispy chicken burger, it was extremely crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside and quite flavorful. I devoured that thing in under 5 mins lol Good thing we beat the crowd because once we ordered and found a seat the line started forming out the door! If you're ever around the area, i would recommend giving this place a try. It's worth it.",1,1,1
10,Sean D.,"New York, NY",248,25,4,5.0,11/7/2018,"Whether it's cheat meal, munchies or the perfect cure to a hangover shake shake have always been there. The burgers are always delicious and consistent, same with the fries. Shakes too if you're going that route. The food always comes out fresh, fast and efficient. The customer service is always extremely professional I've found. I've seen them have to deal with so much inappropriate behavior from middle school kids and other teenagers screaming. They never break there cool though. They smile and take the order. The team there is very good about keeping the tables clean so customers don't linger and other people eating can sit down. This place can get packed and there's constantly traffic going thru open to close. Everyone loves shake shack.",,,
11,Da X.,"Philadelphia, PA",221,268,134,2.0,8/2/2018,"I've tried pretty much all the burger chains except a few, unfortunately, while the burger is good, the price is not. There is a fine line between taste/happiness and dollar (as you'll see below). Unfortunately, the amount of happiness I get from eating at shake shack meal versus other chains is about the same, but at a much higher price point.How much happiness do I get from a double cheese burger, fries, and fountain drink and how much will it cost me?

As you can see, In-N-Out, Chick-Fil-A, Shake Shack, and Five Guys all give me a happiness rating of 8, however, Shake Shack is nearly 2x the price and Five Guys is nearly 2.5x (though I do admit Five Guys does have a bigger burger, but even a single patty meal would still cost 2x as much as In-N-Out and Chick-Fil-A).So what gives me a happiness rating of 9? Glad you asked, it's Gordon Ramsay's Burger in Las Vegas! While sure it'll cost me a few blood donations, it's well worth it!",1,2,1
12,Christina F.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",15,72,221,3.0,8/8/2018,"Personally I don't get the hype about this place. It's good, but definitely far from the best. Way over priced for what it is. The burger was very greasy and the fries are okay. The decor and setup of the establishment are nice. But not enough for me to be back. The outside setup next to this location is nice if you work close by and want to sit down for a quick lunch.",1,,1
13,Angel F.,"Madison, WI",0,18,8,5.0,7/20/2018,"We love Shake Shack. We have never been to this location but already prefer it to the others. The line moves fairly fast and there is more seating then some of the ones we've been to. The burgers are always good and made to order. The fries came out piping hot, crispy and perfectly seasoned. I tried bacon on my burger this time and yum! It was crispy and smoky. We also tried the crunchcrete which was really good. Definitely recommend it. Will have to make a return visit while we are in town!",1,,
14,Simon C.,"San Francisco, CA",212,285,1990,4.0,2/12/2018,"My friend who just moved to NY from CA kept telling me how Shake Shack is better than In-N-Out. Being a always pro-CA guy I have never thought a single bit that this statement makes sense - but after I visited there and tried it for the first time - I have to give Shake Shack the trophy of ""best burger chain store"" I have ever had!* * * EXPERIENCE * * *Of course there are a lot of stores in NY, my friend just brought me to this particular location since we just finished visiting the MET which was around the area. It was pretty packed - and I was surprised this place sold beer as my image was it's just another In-N-Out! The burger menu was quite simple and straightforward.* * * FOOD * * *Double Shackburger: AOnce you take the first bite, you will immediately find the difference. For In-N-Out, I feel like a big part of their success comes from the sauce - that sauce is extremely addicting and you always want more. But here in shake shack it was the meat quality that was phenomenal. Like that freshness.... it's hard to describe but I always believe that if the food source is excellent, your food has 70% chance of success - it's pretty clear that the beef used was with such a good quality that the juiciness in it completely trap your soul. Because the burger was so beef-centric, I couldn't really taste the ""Shacksauce"" claimed to be added in the burger. I guess I have to try it more carefully next time.Shroom Burger: A-I'm a big lover of mushroom so I had very high expectation to this burger - and although this burger was also superb, I found it lack the mushroom freshness, perhaps it was overpowered by the ingredients around such as the cheese and the sauce etc. But overall it was still a very nice veggie burger option. Sometimes you just want less meat on your diet.Oh, how can I forget to talk about the fries. The clear winner is In-N-Out. I'm just not a big fan of crinkle-cut fries. I mean, the flavor was good, but when you combine the texture/shape/uniqueness, In-N-Out fries are hard to beat.And for the beer, burger+beer was a new concept to me, I wouldn't say they are a perfect match especially on a sub-32F winter day but I guess I will have to try it again in the summer and see.Now, I have to disclaim that I'm not betraying In-N-Out and rush to the Shake Shack court - I still love their sauce and their fries but when you put a Double-Double and Shackburger side-by-side - I think I will start picking up the Shackburger from now on.",2,1,3
15,Fateha A.,"Queens, NY",79,224,462,3.0,4/18/2018,"The cheese burgers are good. They come with onion, pickles, tomato, lettuce & obviously  cheese. I prefer the Shackstack tho.The service was good. The staff is courteous & polite.",,,
16,Nelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",81,159,322,5.0,6/21/2018,"So, full disclaimer: this is 5 stars for the FRIES alone. i don't eat meat, so i'm afraid i can't opine on the beef burgers. The veggie burger i had was pretty good.Nevertheless, and ALWAYS the more: crinkle cut fries just taste better than regular fries. Don't try to debate me, because, science! Their cute little valleys are a feat of culinary engineering that are just the perfect surfaces to temporarily house your condiment of choice, thereby elevating your fry-eating experience! Plus, my friend from the UK who's wayyyy carb conscious (madness), couldn't get enough of them! i was smothering my fries in ketchup and hot sauce, and she was smothering her ""chips"" in mayo. And we both lived happily ever after. Still craving fries though.",2,2,3
17,Raina A.,"Mississauga, Canada",78,116,91,5.0,7/6/2018,"I don't think Shake Shack could mess up enough for it to warrant a negative review from me. The burgers are always fresh and delicious! I always get the single Shack burger which is  a must try. Soft and fresh burger buns, tasty and fresh meat, the shake shack sauce.. a must try! In fact writing this review has got me craving another burger..The fries here are also good. Crinkle cut, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The milkshakes are good IF you like your milkshakes very thick and sweet. Shake Shack please come to Canada!!",1,,
18,Amanda C.,"New York, NY",156,115,278,3.0,7/12/2018,"Good not great. Definitely hyped up but it's fun to eat here every once in a while, especially when friends from out of state visit! I always get the shack burger. It's good, the ingredients seem fresh. But for the price of the burger it is not very big- one of the reasons I don't want to give 4 stars. I do like the fries, they are usually a perfect amount of crisp. Salted caramel shake is good too! Vanilla shake with caramel-simple, hits the spot. Very creamy. Fast service, I managed to get my burger in about 5 minutes. A lot of seating outside. Overall good burger place, just not the best value for fast food.",,1,
19,Margo A.,"New York, NY",0,14,7,3.0,11/1/2018,Good food. This place is always very crowded. Difficult to find  empty table. And long time waiting for food.,,,
20,Denay W.,"New York, NY",308,226,736,4.0,1/12/2018,"When I think of amazing fast-food in NYC, I think of Shake Shack. However the quality of Shake Shack is much higher than your typical chain featuring the Golden Arches or a Royal mascot. Like most locations in NYC, the UES spot gets busy however the line moves rather quickly and when the weather is nice you can try to snag a seat in the large outdoor space. In the winter it's much harder to find a seat though because it's quite limited indoors. Obviously the go-to here is any of their burger options. I usually only go for the single patty since that's more than enough for me once I throw in some of their amazingly delicious crinkle fries with cheese sauce. I could eat just the fries for a meal even though it would be a lot of calories - speaking of which, if you're counting calories they list them on the menu board. Round out your meal, or just stop by, for a delicious milkshake as well! I am in love with their salted caramel shake, but they often have special flavors available depending on the season and week. Definitely check some of those out too!",,,
21,Daan K.,"New York, NY",19,71,40,2.0,10/23/2018,Had a bad experience here. I like the location at Madison sq park but this didn't even come close. Bad Burger and sad sloppy fries...,,,
22,Chintu D.,"Redmond, WA",77,111,4,4.0,10/24/2018,Consistent food quality and good people working there. Clean place as well given the amount of people they get thru their doors. They loose a star as the wait can be long after you order the food and they can do better there.,,,
23,Brandee N.,"Manhattan, NY",4,6,0,5.0,10/26/2018,"I'd like to compliment the entire team of employees at this Shake Shack! Particularly, the young man that greets customers and passes out menus to those waiting in line to order. He was extremely friendly and has the BEST smile. Thank you so much!",,,
24,Audrey L.,"Steinway, Queens, NY",181,79,204,4.0,12/16/2017,"The Shack Stack. Every time. I try to make myself order something else but I just can't. The Shack Stack has everything you want in a good burger. Warm bun, a juicy and smoky burger patty, Secret sauce, lettuce, tomato, and a giant fried portobello mushroom that oozes cheesy goodness when you bite into it. Cheese fries= yes.Custards are good but can be too sweet, depending on the flavor of the day. If you are not a custard person, sharing with others might be a good idea.Half and half is perfect for me in terms of sweet & sour balance. People tell me they like the other items on the menu as well, not that I would know.",,,
25,Nikole F.,"Secaucus, NJ",9,144,25,5.0,8/20/2018,The female manager here is so friendly and accommodating. I just left (Monday at 6:30pm) and due to my order being incorrect she quickly fixed it and apologized. She was professional and handled the situation quickly and appropriately. I didn't have to wait either. Thanks E86 Shake Shack!,,,
26,Prasiddha H.,"San Jose, CA",341,104,82,4.0,5/27/2018,I was walking back to my place where I was staying in NY and felt quite hungry as it was hitting almost 9pm. An avid burger lover I have always wanted to try shake shack which I found close to where I was staying. When I arrived at the store there was quite the long line but the line moved quite fast. I ordered the following:Shake shack burger- this burger comes with everything a cheeseburger does but also includes the fried breaded portobello mushroom stuffed with cheese. I must say this was quite delicious and I enjoyed every bite of it! The fact that the cheese is so gooey really hit the spot with the meat in the burger. If I went back to NYC I would definitely have it again!,,,
27,Annie M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7,93,673,4.0,5/23/2018,"This place is usually packed so I will only come in if the line is not out the door. There's indoor and outdoor seating. I easily found seating on their ""quiet"" day. When I arrived, the line was only half way down the flight of stairs. Outdoor seating can be a little gross sometimes. Not maintained very well. Not going to bother talking about their food, because we know it's just all around delicious. Remember when the company changed their fries from crinkle-cut to hand-cut then back to crinkle again? Lol. Should've just stuck to crinkle. Way better.",,,
28,Andrew S.,"Queens, NY",299,618,1198,4.0,3/22/2018,"This is actually one of my better liked atmosphere for a Shake Shack and it is one of them that has less of a line but still quite full in capacity with customers usually. I have been to at least half a dozen Shake Shack locations including the original. You get the same quality burger and everything else from the chain. This location just seems larger in space with the outdoor seating area with a handicap accessible ramp. The indoor seating area is actually medium sized with table seating in the main area and near the restrooms. They keep the place pretty clean but it's still a bit messy in there. I don't think they can help it with all the business that they get. Every time I walk down those stairs I get the feeling that I am walking into some place a little special or good. The wait for my beeper to go off makes it feel like they are making it on the spot.There's a free water dispenser with cups, ketchup, mustard, mayo and bottles of the Louisiana brand hot sauce as side condiments to the clean tasting burger and those crinkle cut fries.I think like so many of the chains writing a review for one goes the same for them all, but just putting my 2-cents in for this location because it's one I visit the most and like the most.",8,2,3
29,Renata R.,"Avon, CT",13,165,179,5.0,4/21/2018,"My husband has been talking about this place for a while, since we are in the city every weekend we try to eat at different spots.The line was a bit long, but the young man at the door handing out menus said it was 10-15 min, not so bad. Line did move fast, as we got closer I managed to get us a table. Hubby got one of those buzzers while we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. He finally went up to the counter and asked one of the girls she said our order was coming up. Ok, so he stood there for 10 min, and waited some more. When he finally went back to the register to ask for a refund, the general manager Matt, was very apologetic. Clearly there was a mix up, but he didn't want us to leave, and be unhappy. He asked us to have a  seat, made sure our order was made immediately and brought it to the table personally, with another apology. I must say, mistakes do happen, and this was not intentional, but the food was definitely worth the wait. We both had the double Smoked Shacks and milk shakes, our daughter had a double Shack burger and a coffee shake, all was delicious! We will return. Thank you Matt for caring, and addressing the issue so professionally.",1,,1
30,Margareta S.,"Manhattan, New York City, NY",0,7,8,1.0,10/22/2018,"Honestly, I can't understand the hype behind this burger chain. The burger wasn't really tasty in my opinion and the fries were normal. Wouldn't go there again. It's not even cheap. Additionally, I found plastic wrap in my burger patty.",,,
31,George L.,"Clarksville, TN",17,219,452,5.0,9/25/2017,"A very solid burger.  Nice sear on the outside with a slight crisp.  Beef was just on the oily side, but very flavorful and hot.  I like how the meat was not overshadowed by the toppings.  I still prefer In 'n Out, but this is a very good burger. We took ours to go, as it was very crowded here.",2,,
32,Mandy H.,"Minneapolis, MN",183,53,220,3.0,7/12/2018,"Such a highly recommended and hyped up place. Came here to check it out while I'm in NY for a couple days since every raves about it. Walked it and it's a pretty clean atmosphere considering how busy it is. There's some nice indoor seating and outdoor seating. It's a fast paced environment so definitely decide on your order before you go up to the cashier. I got the hamburger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and shacksauce, fries, and a strawberry shake. Honestly, it's a bit overpriced for what you are ordering. Mine came to a total of about $15. Took about 15 minutes to get the food. They just give you a buzzer and it goes off when your food is ready or else they'll call out your name. Presentation is simple. You get a tray with all your food on it. Burger is good but honestly can't even taste the shakesauce. Fries are fried to perfection. The shake is really good, thick and creamy but the cup is only about 2/3 full which is disappointing. Overall, enjoyed my experience but probably won't seek it out next time.",2,1,2
33,Jon P.,"Falmouth, ME",96,190,328,3.0,11/12/2017,"We always have to hit up a Shake Shack when in the area.  The cheesy burger, crinkle cut fries, and shakes make this establishment near the top of fast food burger chains.  My only complaint about this particular location was the burgers were more greasy than other locations and the bathrooms were a mess.  Hopefully this was due to the fact they were extremely busy and is not a common occurrence.  For these reasons alone, I could not give this location a 4 or 5 star.",,,
34,Michael V.,"Manhattan, NY",331,99,310,4.0,4/29/2018,"Shake Shack definitely lives up to the hype. Since I've lived in New York, all of my friends have recommended this to me, and it's always been so busy, but I never made the time to go in. However, I wish I had visited sooner! Definitely a great, quick, inexpensive burger - with a great reputation! The fries are great, and the burgers are really tasty. There is kind of a touristy vibe, although I'm sure many locals eat here too. The atmosphere was bright and clean.",,,

I don't even need to add fries. The only problem with Shake Shack is the seating culture.

They also had beer and wine plus a small menu for dogs! I typically don't eat burgers out too much, but I'm glad I got the burger from here. It was so good! Everyone got a burger, and we kept eating even once we were full because of how tasty it was. I'll definitely be eating at this restaurant again while traveling.",1,,1
38,Molly N.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",12,84,81,4.0,7/9/2018,"Review of new Veggie Shack, ordered vegan (without cheese). Beet, rice and bean patty: good flavor, nice crispy sear. Standard burger toppings (pickles, onion, lettuce, tomato and a vegan mustard-mayo) provide a classic burger taste and experience. Areas for improvement: falls apart and dry flavorless bun (like a shitty gluten free tasting/feeling bun). All around a solid, respectable vegan fast food option.",,,
39,Rachel W.,"Redwood City, CA",262,256,457,3.0,5/7/2018,"East Coast // West Coast battle right here. We were in NY so obviously we had to try Shake Shack. I'm sorry, but I felt like something was missing. I thought the decor of this place was nice, it was downstairs, and wooden panelling inside. Their menu is basically a la carte, so byom. (Build your own meal)They serve shakes, which I didn't have the opportunity to try, beer and wine (WOAH) and then burgers and other food items. Their burger that we should have tried apparently was the mushroom burger.But we tried the spicy one and their shake burger.Like I said, it felt like something was lacking - the cheese was a good quantity, I liked the variety of toppings but there was like, no sauce or not flavorful enough haha.IT was pretty busy at lunchtime but the line moves fast enough! You get a buzzer then off to wait. Seating was scarce and then a lot of people seemed to be chilling/socializing rather than eating and movin' along lol. We swooped the bar seats. Overall good experience, but don't hate me to say I wouldn't prefer to eat here on a regular basis.",12,11,11

44,Colie R.,"New York, NY",58,156,279,4.0,11/10/2017,"Everyone in New York knows there is nothing better than a burger from Shake Shack!  This is a nice location that has a lot of outdoor seating that is enjoyable when weather is permitting.  What I have found, like most places in New York, when it's super busy (which is normal) they are very quick and you can be in and out in 10-15 minutes.  When they are slow with no line we have actually waited 20 plus minutes for a burger which is ridiculous.  I have had better experiences than not though so I still love this place. My go to choice is a Double SmokeShack which is a cheeseburger with all-natural smoked niman ranch bacon, chopped cherry pepper, and shacksauce with a side of fries. If you are here I highly recommend that you try a milkshake.  My favorite is the Coffee Milkshake.  Another popular one is the peanut butter one, which tastes exactly like a peanut butter cup.  I tend to freeze my milkshakes and they also make perfect ice cream for the next day!",1,,

This Shake Shack has indoor seating as well as a nice outdoor seating area that wasn't packed (it's also available to the public in general) so I opted to sit there and enjoy my usual Shack Burger & fries. They always have the softest buttery buns and juicy beef- ironically I have yet to try a shake at any location! I normally visit the Shack in Madison Square Park but this one is a great option if you're on the UWS. The line wasn't long, I actually didn't wait at all to order during dinnertime. I was given a buzzer and after a few minutes my order was ready- the workers were all friendly and offered to bus my table while I was outside. Bonus: it's near a Lush and Sephora!",9,6,7

WTF Shake Shack   I came to this location because it's the closest ( I live in the Bronx)  I was also in the area. I stopped in for what I thought was going to be a delicious treat( we all know burgers and fries isn't the healthiest; let's be real) I ordered two chickn' Shacks,one Shack Burger and three order of fries. Service was pretty fast and my cashier was friendly.. that's all thats Positive. I received my order and once I left the building it took me 2 hours and 10 declines from cab drivers to get this food home. I was expecting a delicious bite from all that hustling....BOY WAS I wrong!My burger is barely a burger. It looks like a ""chopped cheese"" with zero flavor... Raw on the inside and tasteless on the outside. I'm higly pissed. I wasted my time and money. Tomato is soggy, the lettuce is wilted. Just all around disgusting. This isn't the first time I've had a problem at this location. Fool me once, Shame on me. Fool me twice, Put the blame on me. Fool me three times, F*ck the peace sign and let bad reviews rain on you! Horrible! Bad enough I didn't eat ANYTHING all day. SMH this was so bad, I'm considering going Vegan... Thanks #ShakeShack",,3,

Really?Im a picky eater so maybe its just me but its mediocore fast food.I would do Five Guys anyday before this.Cheese fries are wack...your better off going across the street to that Papaya/hot dog spot for *strictly cheese fries*.I was starving so i had 2 of those 'double burgers' which was kinda slim meat pattys. If your a big dude you can eat 3 of those 'doubles' with no problem.The inside is kinda dirty and if you sit outside the homeless people always begging for 'a dolluh'. Overrated if you ask me.,1,1,

70,Jamie M.,"Nutley, NJ",244,68,155,5.0,1/12/2018,"Best NYC never for the price. I can get a burger I can completely eat due to their smaller party! And I usually hate mayo sauce but their special sauce is so good and they do not put too much on the burgers. All their ingredients are fresh and their buns are perfect for preventing spillage and having the patty slide around. The double burgers are also great if you have bigger portions or are just hungry! 10 dollars for fries and a single patty burger just makes me so happy! Such a great price for a great meal! I love the restauranteur's approach to food, and Shake Shack's quality of food and service really shows through his personal mission of giving people something that they truly love!

Most of the staff are cool and polite. And of the stores I usually go to, this one seems to be the one that has the most seating available on a consistent basis.

81,Paul A.,"New York, NY",256,402,462,4.0,7/3/2016,"All shake shacks should be like 4 stars or above. You get the deal, so instead of a normal review I will do my fav Shake Shack tips:1) The custard here is godlike. Definitely rock it but, ironically, the shakes are the WORST way to get it. Go with the concretes (specialty is a black and white cookie version here) or get a cup with your choice of topping (caramel is awesome)2) I personally feel the Chicken Shack is superior to the Shack Burger. Definitely personal preference, but if you come def give the chicken shack a try. It is easily better than the same thing at Chick-fil-A.3) No one seems to realize that there is a C-Line at all Shake Shacks. In the C-Line, just to the left of the big line when you walk in, you can get any frozen dessert and any beverage you want. Just no hot food. If you are rocking my first tip and that's it go with the C-line. It will save you half an hour. 4) Fries are meh",5,1,1
82,Danny L.,"Fountain Valley, CA",291,180,517,4.0,11/14/2016,"Well what do you know, here I am on the east coast eating shake shack. I had wanted to try this since eating it both at the airport and in Hollywood (and was disappointed). HOWEVER, the actual Shake Shack location on the east coast isn't too bad! I'll always be a fan of a certain west coast chain, but I did like that the burger wasn't soggy at the bottom and dripping. I like that the bun is closed on one end to prevent this. I do think that it needs a bit more differentiating texture [like crunchier lettuce] and perhaps a sauce to accompany the burger (to add more flavor). I will say that it's a well-presented, flamebroiled/charcoal-tasting burger, and the fries are crispy, hot and thick! I got the Hamburger, so note that the shack burger does have a ""Shacksauce"".There was a lot of outside patio seating, and the workers were attentive to cleaning the place up.",,,

The kitchen staff of over a dozen workers really didn't seem to do much to alleviate the backlog of customers waiting in a crowded corner for order fulfillment. I ordered a strawberry cheesecake shake and waited for about 7 minutes before my buzzer rang.More disappointingly, the $6 I paid only bought me 10-oz. cup, which is both smaller and more expensive than a Starbucks Tall (12 oz.). The strawberry cheesecake shake apparently has no actual strawberries or crumbs.

84,Peter V.,"Torrance, CA",932,199,914,3.0,5/25/2016,"Okay, I can finally say that I've had Shake Shack in the East Coast before (or Shake Shake from what I've been calling it during my entire NYC trip) HAHA.Since I'm from LA, all I had growing up was In-N-Out (and I'm not complaining whatsoever haha). When Shake Shack decided to branch out into West Hollywood a few months back, I was hesitant to try it at first because I wanted to try it at the prime/original location...which was New York. Since it was my first time being in New York a few weeks back, I did everything a tourist would do in New York for the first time and going to Shake Shack was definitely on the itinerary haha. This was the closest Shake Shack from where I was staying in NYC at the time and on the first day, I decided to get something from Shake Shack. I really like the cool vibe inside Shake Shack. I immediately saw their alcohol list and I was pleased with that. My one huge criticism about Shake Shack is how expensive their food was. Compared to In-N-Out, In-N-Out is significantly cheaper and I felt like I was paying for overpriced, fine-dining type of burgers. I ordered the SmokeBurger (which has crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce) and a side of fries. Total cost came out to be around $11-$12. Wtf. That is like ordering 2-3 burgers at In-N-Out, honestly. No bueno.The burger itself had a lot of flavor, which I enjoyed. The beef patty itself is really moist and juicy. The fries were alright. It kinda reminded me of the fries I would get back in elementary school. But for the price that I paid, I was disappointed with the outcome. The burger itself wasn't that big honestly and I finished it pretty fast. I think Shake Shack is pretty much overhyped and I'm just glad that In-N-Out is only exclusive to the West Coast. During my trip, I didn't realize how common/frequent Shake Shake would appear in New York...it made me miss In-N-Out because In-N-Out does not appear as frequent as Shake Shack does. Definitely not missing out whatsoever. At least I know!",4,,

Everything in NYC is expensive so it wasn't a surprise when my meal came out to be 17$. The burger was nicely prepared, juicy bacon and they dont skimp on bacon. They also didn't skimp on the peppers and it was all clumped in one pile so I had to scoop it out cause it was excessive. The cheese fries were okay, I had many burnt pieces but also many crunchy pieces, but I most likely wouldn't order cheese fries again because for an extra 1$ it was just not cheesy enough. The orange creamsicle float was delicious, something I don't see other chains offer.The service here was friendly and they always had a smile on their faces despite the bustling amount of people. Also if they see you done with your food they will offer to clean up after you! Something only done I've only experienced at In-N-Out, Chick-Fil-A and now at Shake Shack.

Yes these burgers can be found in Shake Shack.I'm from California, so I tried IN-N-OUT burgers numerous times. Some say IN-N-OUT is better, and some say Shake Shack is better. However, I say they both are good in different ways. Just as you can't really compare orange with apple, I don't think I can compare shake shack with IN-N-OUT because they have totally different theme/ moto I guess. As mentioned, Shake Shack burgers has it's own distinctive stand outs- They have really juicy meats, their ingredients were very fresh, the melted cheesed absolutely looked gorgeous, affordable, and most importantly, tasted phenomenal. Comments to this particular store: I really appreciated the fast service and a clean service.

95,Clare L.,"Indianapolis, IN",137,321,66,4.0,2/2/2017,"Shake Shack: worth the hype, but NOT as good as that other cult favorite on the West Coast, in my humble opinion. I came on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and enjoyed the ShackBurger (a single is more than enough) and fries. Is it just me or are crinkle cut fries just better than regular fries? I didn't opt for a shake this trip - though a lot of the desserts sounded great. Next time I'm in a city with Shake Shack, I'd definitely return to have a shake and try the Shroom Burger. This location on the Upper East Side seems like it is a popular location to get your food to go, as there is pretty limited seating inside. Maybe 20 tables max? In the warmer months, eating on the patio, which is tucked far enough away from the street, would be relaxing.",1,,
96,Joy W.,"San Jose, CA",216,495,3697,3.0,2/9/2016,"Shake Shack, you're alright, but seriously overrated. This is the first Shake Shack location I had ever been to, and I found the food underwhelming. I recently revisited and I still feel the same way. It gets pretty crowded and dining can feel uncomfortable. However, they do have a nice outdoor patio with heating lamps for the cold winter days.I've tried the ...ShackBurger ($5.29) - cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce on potato bun,ShackBurger Double ($8.09):A single is small. Get a double. Depending on how hungry you are, or how much you want to spend. But the prices are rather high for fast food. So I can only assume it is a fast-casual chain. Things I Actually Like:- Cheese melted over patty- Leafy lettuce, not the shredded variety. - Toasted buns which is nice, but still didn't have much crunch. I prefer buns to be toasted to a slight crunch. Otherwise, what is the point of toasting? At least the buns aren't soggy.Still, a lot of burgers have these same qualities, so I don't think Shake Shack is all that special or outstanding.SmokeShack ($6.84) - cheeseburger with Niman Ranch bacon, chopped cherry pepper, ShackSauce:This has too many cherry peppers and overpowered the taste of everything else in the burger.Cheese Fries ($3.99):The lackluster tray of fries covered in melted cheese is very simple and over-priced.The regular crinkle cut fries are usually very mushy to me, but I think someone made a mistake and fried them twice, giving them a nice crunch this time.Frog's Leap White Wine ($7.89) - 6 oz:Mr. Joy was thoughtful and ordered me wine. It was okay, but tasted odd paired with everything else. The plastic tumbler has a divot for your thumb. Nice touch I suppose.I still think Shake Shack is a good option for relatively inexpensive food. It is just not the amazing, great burger touted by many others, costs too much as a fast food option, and doesn't live up to the hype.",2,1,2

I had this for the first time during a visit to New York at their original Madison Square Park location as well as in Vegas when the New York-New York casino opened one up. Being from SoCal, the comparison to In-N-Out is inevitable because... well, this is the local awesome cheeseburger spot with multiple locations. That being said, they're two different animals with different styles. (Animal style. Ha.). To me, for what you're paying, it's worth it. And what you're paying adds up quick -- but at $20 between my fiancée and I, for the quality of the food, I was happy with it.On to the food: I got a ChickenShack, she got a ShackBurger, and we split a large coke & cheese fries. ChickenShack was good but I'd probably get it once! Its use of cucumber was refreshing. Wish I had the hot sauce from Chick-Fil-A instead of the Louisiana Hot Sauce they had. ShackBurger was.. exactly what I expected! Great! Cheese fries were on point! Almost enough to take on my childhood favorite -- Nathan's Famous. And for what it's worth I thought the cheese fries tasted better here than in Vegas. So if you didn't like it in Vegas, give it a go here in its hometown!",1,,

Shake Shake is even better! I fell in love a couple years ago when I had it for the first time. The bun is so soft ans almost tastes like a sweet Hawaiian roll. The lettuce is crisp and green, the cheese is perfectly melted, the patty is not greasy or too large, the sauce is tasty and creamy and don't even get me started on the pickles. I also love that their fries are crinkle cut. The cheese fries are covered with a cheese that tastes like velveeta. I didn't get the custard on this trip but that is also amazing and reminds me of Wisconsin! Since we don't have froEn custard is California.

They also have massive amounts of custard shakes, Ive so far only tried the vanilla and I waned to drink three more vanillas and try each custard shake on the menu. I usually hate food chains and I've never had shake shack before so It was great to step out of the comfort zone. Staff is very friendly and helpful in regards to making sure you get exactly what you want, and very helpful in your decision making if your confused what to get. This location has both indoor seating and outdoor heated seating which is very cute.All in all, get a milkshake and a burger and you will not be disappointed.

112,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",230,582,505,4.0,9/11/2015,"Shake Shack has slowly become an NYC staple, expanding from the modest hot dog stand in Madison Square Park where runners would supply the burgers from haute Eleven Madison's kitchen, to McDonald's successor as the international burger kingpin. The restaurant on 86th Street just happens to be my local spot.I honestly think I frequent Shake Shack more than necessary just because when I leave the subway station, they pump the beefy burger fumes out on to 86th Street. It's a cruel, yet effective marketing technique for those of us who should have went to Chopt instead.The burgers are consistently fantastic. The beef has a perfect, almost caramelized quality to it, the cheese melts right in, and the buttery potato roll is one of my favorite elements. The juicy tomato is consistently ripe, and the shake sauce transmits the same umami found in really good quality mayonnaise. I'm not a huge fan of crinkle cut fries, but they do hold up pretty well in transit to my apartment out near 1st Avenue.The unbearable crowds that plague other locations in the city aren't as big of a problem here, though the strollers on weekend afternoons and loud, bratty teenagers on Friday nights can get annoying. The adjacent public park, equipped with picnic tables, is great for accommodating the hoards, but is rendered useless in the winter, so I try to go in the summer or do takeout.I feel pretty lucky to have a Shake Shack in my neighborhood.",2,,2

You're joking.   The manager steps in and then says he'll get it done quickly.   Well when we did get our food, they missed the bacon on my sons burger.   So there I go back to inform them of the mistake I need rectified and guess what the girl at the counter now does to me...she ignores me and pretends to start cleaning and pays zero attention to me.   It seemed like she was flat out avoiding me.   Finally the manager catches my eye and fixes the burger.   So 30 mon after my order was ready, we get to eat.   Bottom line, I'm listening to my gut and not coming back here again.  No thank you!",,,

The reason why I would come back is the general happy atmosphere of the employees. The majority are cordial, funny and on the night I came in, there was a gentleman walking around asking everyone sitting if their food was ok and if there was anything else we needed. Any table that was not 100% satisfied he went out of his way, from getting them a new milkshake (me) to getting a different burger, napkins, condiments to other tables.Forget the long ass lines, the fact that their burgers are greasy as all get out and are flat with no taste. Or that you get no lettuce/tomatoes/onions (the basics!) on your burger. Or that their cheese fries have fake cheese on top or that their milkshakes are so freaking sweet but also offer no taste.

Then I tried Shake Shack and my heart is SO confused. So I'm going to be very diplomatic about this. They are different burgers. There are so many minute different components between Shake Shack and In N Out that you cannot really compare them. What they have in common is that they are both delicious. Shake Shack is good. The fries are incredible (sorry In N Out, Shake Shack is the clear winner there. Cheese fries take over animal fries. Please don't hurt me.). The fries are the right amount of crispy. It we could mix Shake Shack fries with In N Out sauce, that would be perfection. The burger is solid. It's a good chuck of beef, delicious ripe tomatoes, earthy lettuce, and their sauce wrapped in a delicious egg bun. The bun is arguable one of the best things about the burger.

The meal for 5 people (3 adults and 2 kids) to get burgers, fries, and shakes (which were delish!), was over $70. Not cheap to say the least... In the future we'd prob share one or 2 orders of fries and not get FIVE- since we couldn't finish them all. And in hindsight, a regular (not a double) burger would have done me justice just fine.

Updated review","Fast food is typically a atmosphere where you get in there, get your food and service is kind of a foreign concept. Timothy Lewis, the manager at Shake Shack takes that concept and has turned it upside down.  He checked in repeatedly with all the guests at his restaurant to make sure they were having a good time and to see if he could improve the experience in any way.  He went even as far to remove the empty tray from the table when we finished dining.  It is so refreshing to see a leader show an example to his staff that permeates the whole place. I am sure that Timothy will be moving to corporate to improve all the restaurants in the Shake Shack chain soon but while we have him here it is a true blessing. Will definitely be visiting again soon.",1,,

The place is spacious, there is an outdoor seating section which is nice for the summer and the day I went, I saw De Blasio. But, as much as love Shake Shack, not all locations are as spectacular. The UWS and the Madison Sq Park are my two favs. The food here, while good, had some inconsistencies that bothered me. I guess since I have been to Shake Shack so many times, I have a certain level of awesomeness that I expect and it wasn't met at this location.The food:Shack Stack- Cheeseburger and a 'Shroom Burger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce. This and the Shack Burger are my two go to's. The Shack Stack here had good flavor but the beef was overdone and the 'Shroom Burger was greasy. My friend thought the burger was on the salty side as well. The two previously mentioned locations are perfection. This was good, but not great. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Cheese Fries- Topped with a special blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. The fries were noticeably different. First, the portion, it seemed like they skimped on the portion, the fries were noticeably less. Second, the flavor of the fries were somewhat of a let down. It didn't have the love and care I have come to expect from Shake Shack.Black and White Shake- I was happy with this shake, it did the job and the flavor was nice but the chocolate was the predominate flavor. I would get this again.",5,5,3

One bite took me right back to my childhood and this little roadside stand called Just Hamburgers. The meat patties are so thin that when cooked they are almost crispy on the outside. Crispy, salty meat gristle-mmmm! And there is so much cheese that you can taste it! For me, the only downside was the secret sauce. It was described as a Thousand Island sauce, but it tasted like horseradish. I don't like horseradish. Next time, I'm going commando. Plus one star for awesome food.The restaurant itself is very clean and efficient. We had extremely friendly service and we found a seat inside. The restaurant also abuts a public ""park"" with plenty of outdoor seating. Plus 2 stars for awesome service and a clean shop.Finally, everything was reasonably priced. I think we paid about $5 or so for a burger? You really can't beat that. Plus one star for pricing. When in NY, this is a must eat.",,,

The truth is is that they are both two completely different burgers. The Shake shack burger uses better tasting meat for the burger, but a little more simpler. I always order the cheeseburger with fried shallots. The shallots add a fine crisp to the burger. The only downside to this place is that one burger is usually not as filling as opposed to in n out, where you could get full just off one burger alone. I recommend ordering a side of fries. Overall it turns out to become a $12-$15 meal which to me is a bit pricey for a fast food joint but well worth it. Their custard and ice cream shakes are delicious as well, with alternating flavors each week",1,1,
153,Angel H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,2,5,1.0,5/14/2018,This shake shack was not worth getting the cheese fries. They give you this big soufflé cup and put so little cheese in it.

The burger tastes good overall, with good crispiness from the bacon, but wasn't anything too special. For almost $10 for a meal, Shack shack definitely pales in comparison to In-N-Out in terms of both tastiness and amount of food given. Seating is also hard to find during crowded hours. On the bright side, Shake Shack is coming to the west coast so now we have the best of both worlds! Yay!",1,1,1

In-N-Out still wins by miles, and I'm not just saying that because of west coast pride.I had the SINGLE SHACKBURGER r and it wasn't anything particularly memorable. The patty was well-cooked and pretty juicy, but it was just an average burger and lacked any unique flavor. I had to keep adding ketchup because it was so plain. The burger was also pretty small for the price, which came out to be $5+ including tax. In comparison, In-N-Out's patties may not be as juicy, but the burger is bigger and cheaper and the sauce is much more distinct and memorableI also had some of my friend's FRIES, which were subpar. They weren't crispy and crunchy like you'd expect from fries of that cut.I might come back again to try the Mushroom Burger, which my friend says is amazing, but otherwise, not really inclined to come back. Overall, it's an average burger place at best and not worth the price.There's limited indoor seating at this particular location.

167,Matthew A.,"New York, NY",1,17,19,5.0,4/6/2018,"This is definitely one of the best places in the Upper East Side area where you can grab a decent (in this case amazing) bite to eat. I've been to Shake Shacks all over Manhattan, as well as the one at Citi Field. But this one has a special appeal to it. The ones on 77th St and 40th St seem to be excessively crowded, and the one out in Queens? Forget about it. But 86th and Lex seems to have more seating areas to minimize lines. They have a nice outdoor dining room as well. But don't get me wrong. This place is still going to be packed. If you come at lunch hour, get here a little bit on the earlier side. Anyway, the food is delicious. The burgers, which I believe are a MUST to have if you come are out of this world. The meat is great, but I believe the secret lies in the bread. A delicious bun indeed. And the fries too. Crinkle cut, and better than Nathan's can do them. Not to mention the scrumptious hot dogs. They are a perfect alternative to the burger. Heck, if you're hungry get both! You won't be sorry! But remember to save room for dessert. Everything is amazing on the dessert menu. It includes milkshakes, custard, and concretes. Concretes are interesting contraptions that consist of thick custard and mixed in toppings. I recommend them all. So, if you're in the area of 86th and Lex. (Or the area of any of the aforementioned locations) pop on in to Shake Shack if you're in the mood for a quick bite. New customers will be amazed, returning customers will experience the same great place if they come to this location.",,,

I ordered a ShackBurger, fries, and a strawberry milkshake, and when I took a bite of that burger, it tasted just like what Heaven might taste like. Basically, AMAZING. The patty and the bun were perfect by themselves, the veggies were fresh, and the sauce was divine. The fries and the milkshake were on point too, both perfect sides to the burger. The outdoor seating area was cute and whimsical in my eyes, and tolerable to sit at on that cool day.

174,Katie H.,"Boston, MA",346,425,86,4.0,1/2/2016,"I find that people either love Shake Shack or think it's overrated. I'm of the former, so every time I go to New York, I need to get my Shake Shack fix. This was my first time at the Upper East Side location, and my boyfriend's first time at a Shake Shack period, and it didn't disappoint. Since we had planned a long day of eating, we ordered sparingly. I got a regular shackburger while my boyfriend opted for the gingerbread shake, a seasonal special that he couldn't pass up.The shackburger was as tasty as they always are. Quality ground beef smashed to get that perfect crust, fresh veggies, a healthy amount of cheese, and of course, that buttery potato roll. Always seasoned so perfectly that it doesn't even need ketchup (and that's coming from a ketchup fiend). Happiness in a bun. My boyfriend, on the other hand, thought it was just alright. He had just been to Steak n' Shake a few months before and didn't think it was all that different from a typical Midwestern fast food burger. He liked his gingerbread shake more, and I liked it an awful lot too. The gingerbread flavor was stronger than we expected, and it bordered on too much when we got to the bottom of the cup, but we LOVE gingerbread, so this was a dreamy delight. If I wasn't so into my burger, I would have fought him for that shake. As usual, I think the prices are steep for what it is. A single shackburger disappears in 6 bites and costs $5.29. A single shackburger and fries, which makes a light meal, is over $8. A double shackburger and fries is over $11. Maybe I'm just cheap, but in this city, that can buy me two meals easily. The other thing I didn't like was that it was hard to find a table both inside and outside when we went around 1PM. We were lucky enough to find someone leaving after waiting 5 minutes for a table, but I'm not sure where we would have eaten our food otherwise. On the plus side, the line looked super long, but it moved quickly, and I do enjoy the convenience of the buzzer system. All in all, a nice stop if you want a good burger.",,1,

The employees always clean up after me even when I clean up after myself! Plus they hold the door for me which is super sweet.

They also have great milkshakes and this location offers beer. I recommend stopping here for a reasonably quick meal before going to one of the two movie theaters within a block of the restaurant.

Don't get me wrong In-N-Out is good, but fries are too bland there and there's no variety on the menu! The double with cheese fries and a shake is the go to. I feel like a double is a huge step up from the single here, definitely worth the extra coin. The crinkle fries by themselves are rock solid, but just amazing with the cheese melted on top.

Much better than the burgers you get at sit down restaurants for $10. The mushroom has a crispy fried shell and there's melted cheese/sauce inside that explodes in your mouth. That's on top of the juicy patty that is also included in the stack. Excellent taste, great temperature, awesome.Their shakes are also really good but I tried a single dip custard cone this time, the flavor of the day was Caramel Walnut. Not the greatest custard, I'd stick with the shakes if I were you. Or maybe the Caramel Walnut wasn't very good",1,,
183,Cel C.,"Scottsdale, AZ",1,11,0,3.0,8/29/2017,"I had expected the shake to be a medium or large size, given the $5.75 price I paid.  It was definitely a 'small' size when the shake finally made its appearance.  I got the cookies and cream which was really a chocolate with a few specks of cookies and cream on the top.  While the chocolate was rich and good, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  More importantly, I am giving 3 stars because of the steep price for a smallish shake.I did not sample the burgers or fries, so cannot comment on these.",,,
184,Thomas E.,"Fort Worth, TX",283,236,225,5.0,11/17/2016,"The burgers here are fantastic. So well seasoned and flavorful (my usual order is the double smoke shack). The chicken burger is pretty great too, but a bit expensive for the size. All in all, it's relatively cheap, fast service, and delicious food. I love coming here and definitely think it holds its own vs In-n-out (California) and Dick's burgers (Seattle).",,,1
185,Daniella F.,"New York, NY",210,37,11,4.0,7/10/2017,"When going to shake shack, this is my go-to location. My boyfriend lives on the UES so it is very convenient. I always have great service and the staff is always extremely friendly. There is usually a line but it does g by pretty quickly. I love the shack burger and fries and most importantly in a well balanced meal, their shakes! The mint chip is one of my favorites. I also love the outdoor seating as the inside isn't the largest. The decor is very modern and nice as well, but lets be real, you don't go to shake shack for the decor. Whenever i'm in the mood for a treat, this is where we go!",,,
186,Becky P.,"Angeles, Philippines",0,5,4,4.0,2/23/2018,"My favorite hamburger in east coast. This location doesn't need to wait like the main location. Right next to the store, there is a public seats like a tiny park, costumers can take a seat.",,,
187,Jeff N.,"Tampa, FL",57,35,7,5.0,1/1/2017,"Ate here last week on a rainy, cold day.  If it was a nice day, the substantial outside seating would have eased the crowdedness, however, it was not.  So, you had dozens of parties trying to get about 15 tables.  As other people have commented, if you want a table, you're going to have to awkwardly hover over someone else eating - which can be uncomfortable for everyone involved.  So, that being said, let's talk about the food.  Went with my wife and boys, and we all had burgers, fries, and a shake.This was the first ""fast food"" burger I had that was not cooked well done.  It was REALLY REALLY good, and I get sick from greasy burgers from places like 5 Guys.  I don't know if I could have handled a double, but the single burger was really tasty and good (I did not get the Shakesauce on it).  The fries were good and crisp -- nothing to make them stand out, but nothing bad whatsoever.  The vanilla shake I had was REALLY good as well.Staff was friendly and patient.Would I go here again?  If it was as packed as it was when I went, probably not.  The food was really good, but it's not worth making people uncomfortable just so I don't have to sit in the rain.  If there was a place to sit - absolutely.  I'm a fan.",,,

189,Janice C.,"Fullerton, CA",0,202,0,1.0,5/9/2017,Not sure what all the hype is. Its like for ppl who's never had a decent burger ....... the bbq bacon fries were whatever's nothing to write home about. Had their hamburger ... honestly $6 for just soft cold bun with a slice of meat. Yes the meat was juicy and alright but that's all there is just two slices of bun and patty. No veggies no lettuce no tomatoes no sauce nothing. Not worth the $6. The shroom burger was a little bit better but definitely not worth $8. The buns were cold also. Only the deep fried portobello mushroom was hot. I asked about it and they made a new one but buns still all cold. Don't think I'd ever come back here again. In n out beats this place hands down. I can think of at least two dozen other places that serve better fresher burgers at a lower price. But they all in cali,,1,1
190,Jay Y.,"Houston, TX",714,1022,1836,5.0,8/23/2014,"Is this actually classified as fast food? By Jove, all fast food chains should follow Shake Shack as the role model then!Well, except for the wait. If you are dining in Shake Shack, you have to wait a bit longer than you would with other fast food but still much faster than ""normal food"" places. Do expect awesome burgers, shakes, and hot dogs though!Coming from Texas, I thought Whataburger served the best burger until Shake Shack slammed that belief with its own burger. The Shake Shack burger is smaller and isn't enough to fill this big boy up, but man, the beef patty is too legit! How I wish I can go back to NYC for the solid burger again.Because I'm a glutton, one burger ain't enough for me so I ordered the dog meister, which is hot dog with cheddar and fried scallions. Nothing out of ordinary, but it's still pretty good. Whatever you get though, get the shake! Best shake ever. I mean it's the place's namesake anyway.Excellent stop to get a quick, cheap eat if you are exploring Central Park or the Met! Like I said, I don't care if you get the burger or the hot dog; you have to get a shake! Did I mention that Shake Shack also serves food for dogs? Yes I mean the kind of dog that woofs. Dammit, I wish I brought my dog to New York so I have an excuse to go there for every meal...",1,,
191,Cindy C.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",117,446,174,4.0,8/12/2015,"+ THE FOODI knew Shake Shack was good but i didn't expect it to be THIS good!! I ordered the hamburger, and even though it was a really simple burger, it was so juicy and rich in flavor!! I liked how the bun was connected at the end because the burger wouldn't fall apart like that. What I really loved were the crinkle fries!  They were nice and crispy on the outside, but fresh and soft on the inside, just the way I like them! Lightly salted, these fries were easily one of the best I've ever had. I ordered a bunch of different burgers for my family to try and they said they loved the SmokeShack because of the slight spiciness and the ShackStack.- THE PRICESWhoppingly expensive (ShackStack was $9 + tax!!) but really worth the try. A group of 7 easily spent almost $90 on lunch!",2,1,1
192,Steven H.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,2,0,1.0,1/27/2018,"This is the only Shake Shack location where I've gotten ill after eating there (twice, and twice for my companion). At the other locations, that's never happened to me. Stay away from this one. Take the train down to Fulton or Brooklyn. You'll probably get your food at the same time anyway.",,,
193,Sandy G.,"Napa, CA",52,49,87,3.0,8/11/2016,"Very tasty but a bit overpriced for the portions you get. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries and still had room for more. Also, they hardly put any lettuce on my burger so make sure to ask for extra if you are like me. Can't complain about the service. Also, there is always a wait and limited seating.",2,,
194,Allison B.,"Smithtown, NY",156,106,337,4.0,10/26/2015,"Shake Shack is always a pleasant experience!Do not be alarmed when there is a long line at the Shack, it goes by super quick. You'll be at the front counter ordering in no time. Plus its worth the wait. The 86th location's line can be a discouraging because its mainly all stairs so it looks like you'll be standing there forever but you really wont.For my visit, I ordered the shroom burger ( I dont eat meat) and cheese fries. YUMMY! Shake Shack always deliver. The Shroom burger is my new hot food item lately. I think the fact that it comes with its own Caution: Hot label is everything! While it is hot, the cheese that oozes out of the deep friend mushroom burger is heaven....even if it does burn a little part of the roof of your mouth. I am so glad this location went back to crinkle cut fries because they never disappoint. Always crunchy and flavored just right, the cheese on top was really like whip cream on ice cream. Who doesn't smile at that thought?The location is small so it does feel very crowded. I do wish it was a tad bigger but the outside dining does provide some relief. Not sure how the winter visits will go but stay tuned!",,,1
195,Danny G.,"Congers, NY",134,53,4,4.0,7/11/2016,"After reading the negative reviews...because let's be honest those are the ones that we really read...am I right or am I right? I have decided to put their reviews to the test. Ok your going to pay Manhattan prices, let's not deduct points for that. If you did you're an idiot or must have been lost and thought that you were in another city. The name of the restaurant is called Shake Shack. If you thought that you were walking into an In-N-Out burger once again you're an idiot. So let's judge them on the merit of their food not against another burger that I can't taste unless I live 3000 miles away or maybe I should just compare their burger to a kangaroo burger that I had in Australia because to me that's what you're doing.  If you're doing that you're an idiot...ok my rant is over.  The burgers are juicy and packed with flavor.  They add the right amount of toppings and not one topping overpowers the flavor of the beef. The fries were just ok and I feel like they underfilled the baskets. The lemonade was overly sweet for my taste, but it wasn't anything a little water couldn't fix. The burger I would give a 5 the rest of my order brought the value down to a 4 star rating.",2,3,1
196,Amanda L.,"Braintree, MA",117,137,272,5.0,9/7/2016,"we have a shake shack in MA, actually we have multiple, but I've never been to any, and neither has my bf, he lives in RI and they don't exist there. so figured we'd make a pit stop in NY for our first go at shake shack. he got the shroom burger and I got the bacon burger. he loved his, he expected a burger topped with mushrooms or something but instead it was mushrooms sautéed and then like fried or something together, regardless of how they do it, he loved it. I'm literally obsessed with their French fries! I love crinkle fries! the seating area outside was a plus! it got super packed inside and there were no available seats. thank goodness for the nice weather, or else we probably would've had to take our meal to Barnes and nobles next door haha.",1,,

198,Maricel V.,"New City, NY",159,68,17,5.0,6/18/2015,"Ohhh my lord never have I ever loved a burger so much. I have tried smashburger, five guys, zinburger and all the other fast food/chain restaurant burgers and I just don't think they can compare. Other places are good, but this place is great! It's totally worth the impending heart attack ( knock on wood), but furreals, its my favorite burger EVER!!I love their shack stack. There's a surprise that I won't spoil for you when you bite into it. Just find out for yourself! The burger was moist and all the healthy components were fresh and healthy...dang, I wanna go back now...I'm more of a straight fries type of girl, but for some reason I will gladly take their crinkle fries with a side of cheese please! con: kinda expensive and painfully small. I finished everything in like 5 mins. I realize what a fatty I sound like, but I say these things because it's that good! Also, I'm not fat. I'm average ;)Ambiance: great! Although it gets packed, I like the environment and the decoration. It's very modern and hipsterish. If u can, eat on their outside patio. What's more romantic than good burgers and a picnic amongst the leaves?(I'm exaggerating, but it is very nice!)",4,3,4
199,Samuel B.,"Irvine, CA",14,39,162,3.0,7/8/2015,"Sigh I heard a lot of good things about shake shack. But I was disappointed. The menu is definitely colorful and jam packed. I love the inclusion of alcohol and hot dogs, the variety is not too overwhelming. The service was great too and I love the feel of the place. However, I was put off by the price. My cheese burger was small and cost me about $6.00. And when I say small, I mean, size of my palm small. The lettuce was so big in proportion that it was sticking out of the bun like a leaf. I was expecting something bigger. All in all, I got a shake, beer, and burger, and I paid over $10 for everything. Should have been cheaper, plus the shake was pretty small too. I love the idea of it, but if I have to pay $5 for a burger that small, I would preferably go to McDonald's and buy a grilled onion cheddar off the dollar menu.I probably wouldn't come here again anytime soon, solely cuz of the price. The food was good, but not good enough to choose quality over price.",2,2,
