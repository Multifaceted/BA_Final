Had the first lazy hangover, so drunk, needed a burger, in quite some time after 3 drinks at ASC. much better place to go dancing than at the ritz. drinks come more often, there's less fog, you're not as afraid of entering the restroom, there's a back room, you may even see fake Elton John and discuss with half the bar if he's the real deal. If you're looking for a good time, you've found it. just watch yourself with those drinks, not sure if it was the quality or a stiff pour.",,,1
1,Rossy M.,"New York, NY",2317,304,983,3.0,9/15/2018,This is a cool lowkey spot for happy hour. The special goes from 4pm to 9pm and it includes $4 draft beers and 2x1 well drinks. You basically buy one at about $8 and then get a ticket to get the next one for free. The bartender was really cool. The place itself is very dark so I probably would've never went in if it wasn't for my friends lol. They play good music and there's a lot of space in the back. Only thing they should work on is their cleanliness as the bathrooms were pretty gross.,22,12,17
2,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4006,4.0,4/1/2018,"Atlas Social Club almost sounded fancy, but at the door it was clear the place was seedy.  The doorman asked for a $10 cover but we haggled and got 2 for $5.The long narrow space went way back passed a vinyl booth of speedo clad dancers to a dark curtain at the end with a casual guy standing guard ""I just figured out what this place is.""  My friend piqued with some curiosity.Dancers approached us to go in the back for a lap dance.  There were many of them without much to do on a slow Wednesday night, and they were cute for sure.  Something about the place felt fringe, which is a plus. This gay bar with lots of hot dancers that gives lap dances almost feels like old New York, it's dirty, in your face, and a whole lot of fun.",5,2,5
3,Tony L.,"Brooklyn, NY",621,344,587,3.0,4/2/2018,"This place is meant to be that New England yacht club sort of feel...but with gay white men instead. Oh well, we came anyway.It was a Thursday night and the beginning of a staycation for me, and I decided to go out for a round of drinks with my roommate and his coworkers. All bar seats and the front tables were filled by 7PM, to which we found out later, was due to the Ru Paul's Drag Race communal viewing that happens - quite an experience.The bartender was this Anderson Cooper looking silver fox with bigger muscles and eyes who was surprisingly attentive and kind, as opposed to most gay bartenders who pretend you don't exist. Service was quick and prompt, and you got a free drink voucher with every wellie you ordered until 9PM, a deal I made sure to capitalise on.Overall, this place is good for having a cheap drink with friends, just don't expect quality cocktails. I didn't feel the creepy older-white man vibe from anyone there, so that was a big plus in my mind.",1,2,

5,Jason G.,"Washington, DC",860,1025,501,3.0,6/26/2017,"My friend and I went to Atlas social club for late-night drinks, and overall, it was way too hot and cramped in here to really have a good time.It was not extremely busy for a Saturday night, but the layout of the bar is very claustrophobic and no matter where you stand you're always in the way of someone. It's very hot towards the front, so I went to the back where there is more of a dance floor area. However, it was midnight and people had their computers out in the middle of the dance floor. It was very confusing.The music was subpar, and throughout the bar there are these TVs playing music videos from the 90s and early 2000's - they should've just played those songs instead of the techno that nobody knew interspersed with an Ariana Grande song.They also had a random go-go dancer in the front area, but I kind of felt bad for the guy because this is more of a lounge/bar and everyone was ignoring him. Overall, I don't see a reason why I would go back. There are better dance bars or gay clubs all around this area.",3,1,1

Dancer followed me around even to the ATM. This happens to be my bday week as well and they didn't care. Furthermore dancer said he would hold my phone while I was getting ""mugged"" by the dancer. I was pissed and flabbergasted. Furthermore the drinks are pricey and bartenders are rude. Please learn proper customer service and treat customers with respect.",3,1,

Service was a bit slow and annoying... trying to explain to a drunk bartender over music what you want to drink has its challenges.. and thankfully the other bartender made my Cosmo and it was spot on.The night I was here the music was all 80's and 90's, and I couldn't have been happier. From Tiffany, Irene Cara, Donna Summer, Toni Basil and the Bangles, I sang along with the best (and the worst) of them.. and just as I was thinking it..

Updated review","Live nearby now and go in here often, many of the staff are extremely friendly. It's a great date bar because you can always get a seat in the early evening and hear each other talk and there is a fantastic happy hour till 9pm. Well recommended.",,,
11,AJ H.,"New York, NY",889,7,0,1.0,3/17/2018,The bouncer is a nasty old jaded gay man. The bartender was wasted and making out with patrons. We couldn't even close our tab because he was so drunk or on drugs.,1,,
12,Jared L.,"Riverside, CA",0,1,0,1.0,6/23/2018,"My boyfriend and I came here for the strip night hosted by Adonis Lounge. We go to a bar in LA that also has strip night hosted by Adonis Lounge pretty often so we were really excited to experience it here. But instead we had to deal with a forceful and rapey stripper that cornered us into letting him dance on us. When we first got there it seemed fun and similar to the one in LA. We got drinks at the bar first when a dancer named ""Miguel"" came up to us and greeted us by grabbing our butts. Cool, he starts small talk and flirts. I presumed this was just him trying to flatter us into getting a dance from him. He grabbed both our penises through our pants. I could tell this made my bf uncomfortable so I told the guy ""maybe later"" when he asked to dance. That's only the beginning of the harassment we dealt with from this guy. We were there for about an hour and this man came up to us 4-5 more times even while we clearly looked uninterested. I brushed him off every time, told him I didn't want to dance, and walked away. Each time he came up to us he would grab us pretty inappropriately and kiss us on the neck. I realize this is a strip night but this would never happen at the strip night in LA and we've never been made to feel so uncomfortable from any dancer. Anyway we were obviously not interested in this guy at this point. Later in the night we got a dance from a different dancer. As we go into the private room, the creepy one Miguel follows us. I didn't realize until we were in the room and ""Miguel"" was standing next to the door watching and told our dancer that he would ""take over from here"" and immediately tried getting on top before the other guy was finished. My boyfriend and I were both scared at this point and worried he'd force a dance on us. We got up and walked outside the room to pay and that's when ""Miguel"" cornered us into getting a dance. He was super pushy and told us ""come on you'll like it"" and ""I gotta show you what i have you'll love it I promise."" We were both extremely annoyed and frustrated and creeped out by this guy. There were tons of other guys in the club he could be hitting on but he decided to harass us. He was pushing us towards a private room and continued saying ""come on, you'll like it, just one song."" We both looked scared and sad and this guy didn't care at all. My bf asked him if we could just pay him for the dance and leave, so he hands him a $20 bill. He takes the money and then continues telling us to try one song, while grabbing his dick and telling us we'll love it. I knew my boyfriend was even more uncomfortable with him than I was so I decided I'll just do the one dance with him and get it over with so we can feel safe enough to leave. We go in the room and he gets on top of me, pulls his penis out and molds my hand around it. This really shocked me because no stripper has ever done this to me before. In LA they're very strict about no touching. He starts humping my hand and it becomes clear to me he's trying to get off. I take my hand off and he puts it right back and lifts my head up by my chin aggressively to look up at him. I take my hand off again and he puts it right back and then tells me ""no like this"" and forces my hand to hold it tighter and he keeps humping. I'm looking at my boyfriend while this is happening and just hoping it ends soon. He grabbed me by my chin again and made me look up to him. I felt so scared so I just gave up and sat there waiting for it to end. My boyfriend asked him to stop and he said ""you jealous?"" before he backed off and we finally left. I felt so disgusting and violated. After we left I felt so mad so I went back so I could talk to the bouncer in charge while bugged by another bouncing asking me to prove that I was in there earlier. I started to tell the bouncer about the dancer who was being really pushy and gross and before I could say anything else he starts yelling at me that I should've came to him to stop it and that I actually wanted it or else I would've told the security. I felt old enough to be able to deal with it on my own until he cornered us, at which point going to security wasn't an option. We both felt trapped, and this bouncer didn't give a f***. One of the worst experiences in my life. I'm writing this review so that people are warned and so the same thing doesn't happen to you. Unless you're into being aggressively felt up, bothered with a reminder to get a dance every few minutes, and cornered into a room and basically forced to jack someone off. I never felt more dirty in my life. Avoid this place.",2,1,
13,Lisa A.,"Lodi, NJ",446,371,543,4.0,3/11/2015,"I randomly came here with my friend because we went to an art show in the area.  A sign outside caught our eye for 2 for 1 happy hour from 4pm- 9pm which was great for a Sunday!At first I just thought it was just full with really good looking guys, but then I realized it was a gay bar which immediately brought it up 1 star in my book!  The drinks were cheap and the bartender was really nice and friendly.  No sassy NY attitude here.  They were playing great music and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves... this place actually got pretty packed as the night went on.  The place itself is kinda dark and on the dingy side, but there's plenty of seats around the bar and a large window in the front to people watch.My only complaint is there's a $20 minimum on cards so we ended up drinking more than we really wanted to. But now that I'm thinking of it, was that really such a bad thing?!  On a plus side, the crowd was great so we ended up making some new friends!   I'd definitely go back- good music, cheap drinks, fun crowd!",6,1,6

15,Sarah C.,"Palisades Park, NJ",417,114,64,1.0,11/16/2015,"I have never felt so unwelcome at a spot before.My friend and I stumbled into this place bc there was a 30 min wait for a seat at Briciola. We saw a sign out front for 2 for 1 drinks and were immediately sold. The second we walked in, we noticed there were zero women and soon realized it was a gay bar. What could go wrong, right?I have never received so many questionable stares in my life. They ranged from curious to straight up disgusted. One of the guys noticed how lost and uncomfortable we looked, so he took us under his wing to explain the drink special to us and help get the bartender's attention. He seemed to be a regular and was the only person that was warm to us. Thank you, Kind Sir :( We ordered Manhattans bc it was on the sign outside, and after one sip we were ready to die. We had no idea it was a whiskey cocktail and were struggling to down the drink. I explained our mistake to the bartender and asked him for a splash of sprite in our drinks. Bartender looked annoyed but he obliged. While I waited for our watered down drinks, one of the guys looked me dead in the eyes and said ""THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T FUCKING COME TO A GAY BAR"". Wait, what...? Should I be offended right now? Or was he being sarcastic? He then proceeded to roll his eyes at me like the rude MF he was, so naturally, we got the fuck outta there.Stay away from this spot if you are a heterosexual female and/or looking to have a great time.",11,18,3

I am not saying that there is anything wrong with those quantities; I would just expect a little more variety on ""the scene."" So, ASC quickly went on my ""only come here if every other bar in nyc explodes"" list. HOWEVER, I recently returned on a Monday a few weeks ago and had a blast. One: the bar was not super packed (no pun), which is a plus in my book. Two: they were having some type of Musical Monday thing, similar to the now defunct Splash Bar and Pieces musical nights, going on. So, clips from various Broadway shows, musical DVDs, and even famous monologue/dialogue clips from television shows were shown with the crowd singing and chanting along to them. The DJ (I guess VJ) was really cool and took requests, which is rare at these types of events. Plus, the clientele was pretty laid back and relaxed aka NO DIVA ATTITUDES. The drinks were about 8 bucks a piece but the bartender did make them pretty strong. The bar has old school boxers' training gym type of theme going on with random sofa in the back. Oh, I guess there were go-go boys dancing (my memory is somewhat foggy from all of the martinis). So, if you are into a more laid back outing, I would recommend coming on a Monday after 9pm.",1,1,1

I was happy to visit the new establishment on its opening day this past Friday. Decorated to look like an old school boxing gym, you'll find plenty of cool retro gym ads plastered along the wall and boxing memorabilia hanging from the ceilings. Drinks were your standard neighborhood pricing and gay bar alcohol/chaser ratio (4/5 alcohol to 1/5 ice). Bartenders were friendly and attentive, even with the crowded space. The owners were also present and I appreciated that they were actually doing a lot of the work around the bar - bussing tables, restocking supplies, etc. Sadly, A.Cooper was nowhere in sight. Sadzies.There was a DJ spinning and lots of folks gathered along the couches lined against the walls. There's also a small back room which is is great if you're looking for a more intimate gathering with friends.Still very early in its development, but hoping it gains some great regulars in the next couple of weeks.",12,2,2

Last night, my best friend and I had just finished dinner at Arriba Arriba, an old time favorite, so we decided to head across the street and have a beer at ASC. The evening was meant to be low-key. ASC was pretty dead. We ordered a couple beers and were chatting at the bar when we were accosted by three heterosexual patrons, two women and one man, who were almost definitely on a LOT of cocaine and definitely looking to start something. One woman accused my friend of talking trash about her, even though we hadn't even noticed her up to that point. We ignored her until another woman came over and started to pretend ""dancing"" but repeatedly elbowed me square in the mouth despite my asking pretty politely (considering I was getting elbowed in the mouth) to stop doing that. Eventually, after I took a hard hit the mouth which drew blood from my lip, I grabbed her arm and pushed it away. I don't hit women, but at the same time I'm not going to allow myself to get beaten on by some crazy. Her friend lept at me with a flurry of punches while the woman who was elbowing me hit me over the head repeatedly with her bottle. I kept my hands up to defend myself and deflect the blows I could, and at no point did I retaliate. I've never been in a bar fight in my goddamn life and I wasn't about to have one that night. Meanwhile, their male companion stood in back and egged them on as they attacked my friend and me. Eventually, patrons pulled the crazy heteros off of us. Here's the amazing part: the management kicked US out! Yes, you read that correctly:Despite the bartender backing up our story; despite nearby patrons backing us up; despite the freakin' go-go boy telling the management that we were the victims. The women were literally attacking the staff and even the bouncer, repeatedly trying to get back inside while we stood stunned. At one point one of the women tore away, lunged back at me, and tried to steal my bag. But we were sent out on the street with these crazies, because that's ""policy."" I ended up with a bruise on top of my head, cuts all over my neck, a ruined jacket, a bloodied lip, and a sopping wet bag. Both of our overpriced drinks were spilled and money down the drain. Did management contact the police? No.Did management apologize? No.Did management try to offer compensation? No.Management at Atlas Social Club instead SHIELDS apparent would-be GAY BASHERS and kicks the actual gay patrons out of their bar. But the owner did offer to let us come back another night.

It's forgettable, more hype than anything else. Want a sports bar? Boxers. Want a dance floor? Industry, XL, etc. Want a dive bar with friendly staff and patrons? Posh is around the corner.

There are only a few people here and we are all engaged in what appear to be solid conversations however the music they have playing is the polar opposite of what one would find conducive towards such conversations.

If you're coming with a group of friends it's probably decent because you'll be left alone, but other than that, not worth it at all. Won't be coming here again given the numerous options in the area.",1,,
37,Susan G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,5/26/2017,i don't usually post reviews in my home town but this place!... the good part is that the bartender was hot and friendly. the bad part is that the other patrons where not easy on the eyes. and the really bad part is that this place is hostile to females. yes it's a gay bar but can't i as a woman enjoy a drink with my gay friend? i guess not at this place. when my friend went to the bathroom an older unattractive male sat himself down on the barstool...no excuse me is this seat taken... i said my friend is coming back and he gave me an eye roll and when he got his drink he called me a cunt. really....? so we left ....and trust.... my friend was the only hot one in the place. just a bunch of middle aged and unattractive gays...stay away...not a fun place,,1,
38,Brady G.,"New York, NY",31,8,0,4.0,11/22/2013,"Hold on to your seat!No really.. every time I've been there the barback steals the seats away without asking the minute you move your butt off or get a drink.  Other than that, quite pleasant!",2,2,1
39,greg w.,"New York, NY",16,412,1,5.0,5/7/2016,Not sure why the reviews are so low.  I live around the corner and every time I have been by I have had a great time.  I think I'm this bars defense when I read some of the reviews the bad ones are either someone that got into a fight or someone that would possibly be a few blocks to over from where they belong.  Apple Bees.. Lol,2,,
40,Alex C.,"San Francisco, CA",0,42,0,1.0,12/5/2014,"I opened a tab and bought two drinks, came back to close it and found I'd been charged for a third. I was adding a tip and getting ready to sign, thinking my friend had put one on my tab. But then I went and checked with him just to make sure, and he said he hadn't. I went back to the bartender and explained it to him. He became angry and yelled, ""Fine. There's a twenty dollar minimum anyway, so take three dollars back!"" And he threw a couple of singles at me. I thought this was extremely rude behavior, especially since I had not even raised my voice to him.I will not come back.",8,,
41,Chris B.,"Manhattan, NY",12,8,0,3.0,1/19/2015,"Vibe is totally different here, but not in a bad way. The decor is interesting. Crowd is a little older, but still really fun. Great place to start the night off and meet friends. But you'll want to venture off elsewhere to find a better dancing spot or more energy. They also have a min amount to spend on drinks to use a credit card, which kinda sucks.",4,2,
42,Carlos R.,"Woodside, NY",14,8,0,1.0,8/19/2014,"Been to this bar 3 times. Nice space but nothing spectacular except for some interesting decor. I was there Saturday and the owner blamed the other ""idiot bartender"" for closing out my tab by mistake, mind you they added to it to make the $20 minimum. Then he told me I should just go to the ATM. I told him the ATM was $3 and that I shouldn't have to pay for his mistake, so he offered to take the fee amount from my drink order. I ended up not leaving a tip on the card (which had already been overcharged anyway) and leaving my tip in cash instead, even though my friends thought I was being too generous considering the whole damn ordeal. I just checked my bank account and those jerks closed my credit card tab with $25. I'm calling my bank first thing in the morning. I don't care about $5, but these guys are really pushing it. Never again.",11,,1
43,Will P.,"New York, NY",7,137,1,3.0,4/30/2016,"I like this place, great music, staff can be a little on the slow side, but the drinks are made very well which makes up for it. It's basically your typical Hells Kitchen gay bar.",,,
44,Leo B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,33,1,1.0,8/10/2014,Worst gay bar in Hells Kitchen.I went in one night and the stripper was only mingling and talking to the straight women. I'm not joking. Really glad I came to a gay bar for that.Also it would be nice if they didn't have soft core porn playing with the windows wide open and could respect the community - children are walking by!,3,,
45,Ryan W.,"Phoenix, AZ",13,24,0,2.0,9/30/2013,"Let's see....boring jaded guys staring at their phones- check. Indifferent bartenders- check. Monotonous music- check. Overpriced drinks- check. This latest, greatest  HK hangout maintains the gay New York nightlife status quo, unfortunately.",10,4,1
46,Axel R.,"Los Angeles, CA",94,45,39,5.0,9/24/2014,"Fun bar with a cool concept and even cooler crowd. The music was really neat, not top 40 bullshit, and even had some cool house in there. Very non-pretentious and a great hotspot to meet cool people. Asi, one of the owners, is always there making sure things run smoothly and is very involved, he does a great job. The space is actually impressively large for a small bar in Hell's Kitchen and the parties held here are a lot of fun, too!",2,,
47,James A.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",0,9,2,1.0,9/20/2013,"I had high hopes for this place when I read the owners yammering on about how Hell's Kitchen needs a bar like the ones in Brooklyn or the East Village. Went this Friday night and the music was terrible, predictable crowd of 30-45 year old guys standing around thinking their having a good time when they're really not. Ogling the gym-tits on the shirtless bartenders and gogo dancers. Probably talking only to the friend(s) they came with, which is totally cool in my book, just rather do it in a cooler place than this Chelsea bar in East Village clothing. I hope they make the music less gay ghetto lowest common denominator and attract a cooler more interesting crowd at some point.",7,6,
48,Garrett P.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",89,9,2,1.0,10/25/2013,NOT impressed.  Watered down cocktails and the bartender was focused on his buddy at the bar NOT the patrons.  Not even one star.,7,,
49,Kevin Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",142,9,16,4.0,10/8/2014,"Came here for an event tonight during happy hour briefly. It's a nice bar with cute bartenders. I generally drink a lot, so outside of my normal bar, other places usually tell me to slow down and be careful with my drinking. This place is pretty awesome as I don't feel judged for my drinking, I think my drinks became progressively stronger as I ordered more drinks and the bartender made an adorable comment about how they are sorry my cups apparently have holes in them and they keep having to refill. A shame I was a bit in a rush, will try this place again soon with reinforcements haha!",,1,1

He did not have anything to say.when all my friends were there (7 total) He told us that he was going to allow only the other 6 to go in not me.well, we left...f...the place and that idiot.bad for the bar he lost at least 2-3 drinks each.plus we decided all no to go there..So I never went in and I will never go if this is the way they treat people.and just a friendly remind: you do not own the sidewalk!",4,1,
51,Garry P.,"Chicago, IL",3,9,0,2.0,11/3/2013,"Just will never get the concept that guys go to a bar because  bartenders are hot and walk around half naked. The place was packed last night with a good looking crowd; hence the bartenders were very busy. However it takes half a millisecond to say thank you when tipped and actually less to make eye contact when handing back your change. You get the feeling the bartenders were there to be ""serviced"" by the customers than the other way around. The Decor?  Nothing fancy and not even worth mentioning.The crowd? Good looking and actually pretty friendly.The Doormen?  Full of attitude and not very friendly.Will i go back?  Yeah probably, but will tip the ""Peacocks"" based on how polite they are.",4,,

53,Jay S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",5,11,5,3.0,7/8/2014,Friendly staff but sometime way to grid my with other people that they take awhile to serve you or completely ignore you a good 15-20 mins.,1,,

57,George M.,"San Diego, CA",84,93,67,3.0,10/20/2013,This place was ok; not great but ok. Kind of a nice neighborhood bar in a big neighborhood. No complaints but nothing to rave over either.,2,,
58,Brian P.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,41,0,2.0,1/22/2015,Nope. Cheap beer is great but when your non-drinking friend is charged $4 for a coke. (Same price as my beer) it is time to move on to another place.,4,2,
59,Don E.,"Williamsburg - South Side, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,40,1.0,11/7/2013,"On a late September Friday night, I decided to check out the new Atlas Social Club to see what Celebrity & Experience could create in the new Gaydom of Hells Kitchen.  I walked in about 10:30.  First feeling & impression, disappointment. Just inside the front door to the left I saw a small tufted, trying to look vintage, red leatherette sofa with matching chair and a cocktail table covered with empty beer bottles and spent drinks. There was a crowd of customers about eight steps in. I walked six steps forward to what felt and smelled like the exhaust side of a bathroom fan. The bar was hot, humid, and needed a diaper change. That was enough, I turned around and left. I walked a block south on 9th ave and stopped thinking, maybe it's the wrong place?.. Maybe I'm missing something.. maybe once I got past the crowd I'll discover the gem. With an open mind I returned. Back inside,  the cocktail table was still covered w empty beer bottles and no improvement with the ventilation. The scene, crowded 20s-50s stand & model, why are we here? vibe. I made it through the crowd to the back.. A tight nothing memorable space with a DJ and small dance area. The back Sofa'd room has a Merrick Long Island finished basement sans wood paneling feel.  A window ac unit did keep that room cool. I made my way back to the front. Looked at the bar and bartenders. The bar has the same finished-basement feel as the back room. The shirtless gym-bodied bartenders just look.. shirtless,  out of place even. The look how hot I think I am so tip me attitude is as prevalent as the lack of friendliness, good customer service and graciousness. The walls are painted red, black, or decoupaged with stuff from the Internet. The vintage looking boxing/wrestling ads and announcements on the walls have a printed from google images and dipped in tea to look old feel.  Light fixtures, industrial single bulbed thick glass, think Poseidon Adventure boiler room, you know the ones. An almost adequate sound system complete the lack-luster space.  A forced nonchalant isn't this masculine & cool without trying to be, permeates throughout. As a throwback to a prohibition era masculine den hangout, Atlas Social Club flames out. 1 Star",1,1,
60,Justin S.,"New York, NY",26,37,0,4.0,10/4/2013,Beautifully designed bar with a lot of thought in the details. Great lounging furniture for more chill intimate hanging with friends. Good music when I've been there. This is my first choice for an HK bar.,1,,
61,Mike M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,4.0,12/12/2013,"Well I use to live in Chelsea and with all the new bars in the area it has a ""barracuda downtown feeling "" to it that I like - it's not a huge place by any means and that's what's nice about it - has a smaller neighborhood feel to it where some other places can be a but overwhelming and too loud - music is eclectic - mix of older music mixed w current and different genres as well - so if ya wanna hear house music this isn't the place for you but if ya want a chill, laid back spot to hang then I would recommend checking it out - beats going to boxers across the street trying to get a drink while the straight bartenders chat among themselves - they should go work at a Fridays for Irish pub dive bar lol And I'm through",,1,

63,Dennis A.,"New York, NY",3,1,0,1.0,11/8/2013,"Been a very long time that I have felt compelled to write a bad review, but...terrible. Rude bartenders, watered down liquor, and not only is it watered down but it sure as hell tastes like they are pouring well vodka out of top shelf vodka bottles. Incredibly blah and horrible music played so loud it makes you want to dance, but wait it's not a dance club. And when someone In our group asked the bartender to turn the music down just a hair,  his response was to throw shade and actually turn it up. No desire to go back.",7,,1
64,Matthew Y.,"White Plains, NY",0,42,0,2.0,10/14/2013,"Based on the Instagram page this place oversells and under delivers. Sorry to say but i was expecting so much more considering the A list celebs that have been there. Bad lighting, basic uninviting benches against the wall and ottoman's, bathrooms on the dance floor are in an awkward place and the sound system is average at best. I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and the bartender said ""we don't have that but we have 2 for 1 tap beer"". As if that would be my second choice from wine? . The decor, trying to feel ""vintage"", just feels old, like the bar has been there for a decade or more. I figure it will find a niche in the local crowd maybe but not a place i'd travel into the city to visit.",5,,1
65,Paolo M.,"New York, NY",4,158,0,2.0,12/28/2013,"Nothing special and I suspect without the Anderson Cooper's boyfriend connection, this place would be easily overlooked.

67,Ron J.,"Manhattan, NY",7,19,0,1.0,5/25/2014,"I had the worst service experience here. It was a Saturday night and the bar was moderately busy, but the service was pretty bad. I had been using the short blond bartender to the left of the bar, but he spent most of the time talking to his friends and giving out free drinks. I had a tab open, and he kept ignoring me and getting the order of people in line mixed up because he was busy talking to his friends. I eventually switched to the tall, more muscular bartender on the right, and he was more attentive. However, when I closed out I was told 20% gratuity was added to my card. I asked if this was standard, and the bartender said the owner told him to do it. I asked who the owner was and he said it was the blond shirtless bartender. He then admitted that he was the bar manager and not the owner. It's not good service to ignore your customer then add an unauthorized, unannounced tip and not even tell the customer until after his card is charged. I will not be revisiting this place, and I recommend that you avoid it.",7,,1
