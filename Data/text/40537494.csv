The chicken soup was perfect , the Jewish rye incredibly fresh, the corned beef lean and tender , and the pastrami defies description. And what NYC deli trip would be complete without a shared slice of NY cheesecake? Also so fresh and lovely, it brought tears to my eyes. The staff were friendly and didn't mind us hanging out over our après meal coffee and tea until the rain let up and it was time to head over to the Broadway Theatre. Ladies: the restroom was spotless, no line and on the ground floor too!I had to resist the French style macaroons, maybe after the production.....",

2,,2/26/2018,346,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Nick H.,751,4.0,306,"Not sure why these guys have such a low rating - it's a very solid NY quick serve deli. They're open late and they serve a mix of sandwiches and hot foot including pasta, burgers, and hot sandwiches.Really appreciate how late they're open - the guys are friendly with that touch of NYC attitude. They heat the sandwiches using an oven and not a panini press so the sandwiches toast nicely and the cheese melts. I haven't had a bad sandwich here yet and I'm aiming to come back for the hot brisket.Also - their burger grind is pat lafrieda, if you appreciate thatUPDATE: The hot brisket au jus is a great sandwich. It's pretty large and they're generous with the amount of brisket. The brisket is perfectly juicy, fatty, and gelatinous. Perfect in a sandwich really. Comes with some very solid coleslaw that is a nice crunch counterpart to the rich sandwich. The sandwich also has some cheese in it. It is a little on the salty side.Also, I don't know how many people care/appreciate this, but they've got great pickles to go with the sandwiches.",

The food was of extremely poor quality.There was hair in the chicken pesto sandwich and instead of apologizing for it, the servers argued and got defensive and were very  unprofessional. The cappuccino was very badly prepared. The macaroons were stale and sickly sweet and prices of the extremely bad quality food was sky high. I am definitely never stepping foot in this restaurant",

They have all kinds of options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, whether you want to eat there or take it to go. They have coolers with refrigerated items, fresh pastries/bagels and snacks, sandwiches, salads, fresh fruit, beer, wine, and a grill where cooks prepare the  hot dishes. They're right across the street from the Sheraton, so a lot of their guests come here for a more reasonable meal. I just had a bagel, a side of bacon and a coffee this morning for $10.72, and I'm wanting to try one of their sandwiches. They sound great! Like a real Jewish deli. I noted regulars coming in too, so they must be doing something right!",2

They even had a few vegetarian options, which I was happy to see, as they are rare finds at delis. It's fairly expensive for what you get, but here in central Manhattan that's pretty much par for the course (gotta pay that sky high rent somehow!). I had the California veggie burger (requested no onions) with fries. They got my order down perfectly, and the fries were thick, fresh, and delicious!",

I ordered a sandwich and a cannoli and the total was about $12, which was an absolute steal compared to the other places I went, AND the food was filling and tasty!

Also about five coffees and lots of bottled waters, juices and sodas Service is place-your-order at the counter (on a Tuesday afternoon there were 6 to 8 workers behind counter so things move fast). Plus, if you're in a hurry there's a ton of sandwiches freshly made and ready to go. The service terrific, fast and friendly. Once served, it's either take out or take it to the clean tables right there.My spaghetti and meatballs was fine although I would have preferred a little thicker sauce. Meatballs were big and very tasty. Companion's salad was made to order and excellent. Add three bottles of water and it's$36 which is crazy but reasonable in midtown Manhattan.

We showed him his price on the board that was clear as day. He was extremely rude but gave us our $3 back. I read other recent reviews of this deli and people complained about being overcharged.

46,,12/7/2016,0,,"Lafayette, CA",Aaron P.,0,1.0,2,"I had the horrible misfortune of eating at the 810 Deli about 9 months ago. It was arguable the worst ""restaurant""/food establishment I have entered and I was so mad about my experience, I decided I should cool down before writing a review about it. But over the last 9 months, I still have nightmares about this place and cringe at the thought of it. Even hearing the word ""deli"" or the number ""810"" brings back terrible memories of this place. It's so bad that I made this account on Yelp just because I knew I had to write a bad review of this ""deli"" in hopes that I can stop someone from making the horrible mistake of eating there. Long story short, I'm writing this review now because I don't think I'll ever ""cool down"" about my opinions of this place, and would like to do everything I can to help a future customer avoid this shady establishment. First of all, their prices are OUTRAGEOUS. That said, I understand the tourist trap of the location and needed a quick bite to eat, and decided to proceed anyway. I expected to at least receive half decent food, but boy was I wrong. They microwaved my friend's $12 tiny dish of pasta on a STYROFOAM plate and my small $16 corned beef sandwich was arguable the worst within 50 miles of the Hudson river (once you get about 50 miles out, it starts to gets worse... sometimes a lot worse, I'll give them that).The worst was when they tried to ring me up at the register. I watched as they DELIBERATELY inputted the incorrect prices for each item (all a few dollars higher than the normal price) to try to drive up our bill. I was with 3 other people and they did this on all of our items. In total, they were trying to increase our bill by by about $10... on top of the already ludicrous prices. I told them I saw them input the incorrect prices and asked to see the receipt before I paid. They looked confused and tried to tell me that they were out of receipt paper. I responded that I could see an entire roll of receipt paper and watched them print a receipt for the last customer. They finally agreed to reenter the prices, and THEY DID IT AGAIN. At this point, I was at a loss and almost walked out the door leaving the food behind, but they finally agreed to charge us the actual prices. I was furious at the scam of the business they were running, but proceeded to quickly eat my food, still being in a hurry. THEY WERE EXTREMELY RUDE DURING THIS WHOLE ORDEAL AND THE WHOLE TIME I WAS THERE!As I was about to leave, I noticed that they were doing the same thing to another group of customers! Each item they bought, they deliberately inputted a higher price and pretended to be confused. If you're wondering if I was looking at an outdated menu, they even told me the original price before I bought any food and then proceeded to input a higher one when checking me out when they thought I wasn't looking. When I saw this happen to another customer, I shouted at them that they're a scam and that they overcharge people as I angrily stormed out of the establishment. Please don't go here. No business like this should keep their doors open. There are plenty of honest establishments that are trying to make a decent living and the 810 deli takes away business from these places, while STEALING money from their customers. Whatever you do, I strongly recommend you avoid the 810 deli.",3

54,,10/22/2016,3,,"Lenexa, KS",Grace R.,12,1.0,50,"Really bad sandwich place. We were in a time crunch and didn't have time to wait in line for the Carnegie deli. Bread on all the sandwiches was old and stale, and the chicken was rubbery. The pastries were horrible. Macarons were too thick, and there was way too much filling that had way too much artificial flavoring. Lobster tail filling was bland and too eggy, and the puff pastry was too dense. Biscotti was not good either.... don't stop here...",

When I walked in, the place was empty. I asked the front counter person if I can order a toasted bagel with butter. He doesn't say anything and just points to the back. So, I walk to the back and ask the BACK counter person for a toasted bagel with butter. He looks at me and doesn't say anything. So I ask again. Kid you not, he just stares blankly in another direction and doesn't answer.  I just walked out and got a bagel down the street. So weird and service horrible.  Save your hard earned money and go somewhere else.",1

I hate to eat at an empty establishment. The corned beef was good but slightly  dry. But the good thing this place will give you mayo on your corned beef , that is a win.  But i was charged for the full sized when i ordered the smaller version but i was in a hurry . Another thing because  it was so empty it seemed they were starved for conversation.  I dont like when people ask where you  from , like im from here idiot .",
