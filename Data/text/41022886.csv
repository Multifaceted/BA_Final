Disappointing return.  Hostesses indifferent, felt like I was bothering them to discuss table options as they chatted...ultimately bellying up, the bar staff was arguing, burger was just ""ok"", my guest had vegetarian omelet - but they forgot to add cheese - so they brought out a ramekin of melted cheese on the side after the fact...enough on this review - won't be back.",1

Drinks were well priced, although the cocktails were a bit too sweet for my preference. One of the cool thing was that they had not one, but two, functional little CRT TVs on the back of the bar.

They have a pac-man arcade loaded with lots of other classic games. Plus, it's free to play! The food is great too. I'm not sure where the food came from as it was delivered through the front door.

(and who knows if he really even was the owner?!), SERIOUSLY JUST LEFT AN ACRID TASTE IN MY MOUTH....YUCK!!!!!  DISGUSTING STAFF!!!  CRACKED OUT!!Honestly I've never encountered such rude behavior as that from the Spanish bartender and bearded dark haired owner(or so he said he is).  Dramatic much?Went here with my famous older Jewish accountant on a Monday and was rudely thrown out by the shittfaced owner and his vociferous blonde girlfriend who accused us of ordering 4 drinks for the two of us when in actuality they mistakenly heard the two other people order the two other drinks and oddly enough didn't know who to place the drinks with but with us?!  It was an empty bar besides like 8 people total which is what's weirder.....Please bartenders, for the sake of less drama in NYC, stop drinking and getting high/drunk while on the job. I say this as the blonde gf kept repeatedly going behind the bar and bringing back drinks to the bar area for her and her owner BF.It was probly a case of miscommunication but they basically screamed at us to leave for ordering 4 drinks and not wanting all 4, then followed us to Tropical 128 where they proceeded to tell the bartender not to serve us!  Seriously, do you really have that much time on your hands or just have very meaningless lives?! It was just super bizarre because when 2 well to do dressed people in suits and a nice biznas dress come into your establishment looking to spend money on your services, meanwhile upping the atmosphere of this rather divey spot, why would you start a fight, chase us away and run after us-basically bullying us just because you cannot get outta your mindset that perhaps you were wrong and can't admit to it?!  Who does that?!  Those people should really be ashamed of themselves and for all the revenue I'm sure they lose for that hotel bar.  Not the smartest staff choices apparently.....Never ever have I been treated so poorly and it really just goes to show you why I've never had the inclination to step into such a low brow type of place with terrible people running it.  Bad energy!  This spot totally brings down the neighborhood and is clearly the weakest link of all the places on Broome st.",33

They seem to want you to try their cocktails, and they look great in the Yelp pictures, but then look very different and are far more watered down when you actually go there. Hmmm.Came here late late night, after Randolph Beer next door had closed down. We were all forced to move house to Randolph at Broome, which sort of slowed things down, I guess. Not the worst thing, but it was clear that we would have preferred to stay at Randolph Beer. Anyways, we had a decent time since we were all mostly decently sauced, so I can't complain too much. I actually did like the space a lot, but there just happened to be more of it at Randolph Beer. The nice thing is that they do have outdoor space, so it should be a pretty decent place to hang out when the weather is nice.We got a couple cocktails, although I can't quite remember what they were. I only remember that they were packed with ice, sort of watered down, and that they cost $15. I can kinda understand that it was the end of the night, but that's pretty rough, and doesn't compel me to try the cocktails during a normal hour. Didn't try the food, although the kitchen seems to be open pretty late. Food menu seems to be right on par with Randolph Beer, with mostly salads, sandwiches, burgers, and general pub fare.Service was pretty attentive and friendly throughout, although again, didn't appreciate the watering down of the drinks. However, I did like the 2 big ice water dispensers at each end of the bar, which made it easy to keep (relatively) hydrated throughout the rest of the night, without needing to ask the bartender for a glass. More bars should have that, honestly. Prices are easily on the expensive side for cocktails and beers, but the food seems like a relatively good value. Perhaps I need to try it during happy hour, when the drinks are less expensive. But for now, I'll stick to Randolph Beer next door for my happy hour needs.",54

But this warm quinoa and kale salad topped with grilled shrimp was a banger! I ate about half of it before I was stuffed and had to ask for it to be packed. The shrimp was grilled really nicely, but the quinoa was the real winner here. It was soft, and cooked in an oil with spices that made it say ""Hello!!"" in my mouth. My friends ordered the ribs, and each plate came with a heaping pile. The ribs were super soft and the meat fell right off the bone. The ribs had a sticky glaze to each of them too.

One of my friends did the same thing and the other ordered a few sides as his meal. We were in total disbelief when our requested food came in to-go boxes. We were instantly confused liked anyone else, as we were intending to stay for lunch. As we expressed our confusion to the bartender, she simply replied, ' that's how it comes"" and walked away. Our entire bill was over $50 - I at least would've loved my food to have arrived on a plate, like it normally would for anyone staying IN for lunch. But who's complaining? The reason for the two stars was for the conversation my friends and I had. They are hilarious - my time was spent well. What was probably the biggest nuisance of the entire lunch was when i went to the bathroom. There wasn't any toilet paper. Not even a wall mount for it. It was weird. Where do you guys have your toilet paper? There was also no soap in the bathroom (I checked in both bathrooms), and it was weird, because under the mirror there was a ""employees must wash hands"" sign. Thank goodness for the sanitizer bottle hanging off my purse. Thank you sanitizer gods. I should've known something was up. It's in the middle of one the busiest neighborhoods in lower manhattan (and yes, I'm a New Yorker and not a transplant) and it was weird to see that place empty. This place is forgettable.",1

Every time I've been here people are standing around and it's super easy to grab a booth for a group of friends. The only thing I hated was the ridiculously loud music.

We had a reservation but something got messed up in the system and we weren't on the list. The staff however, was very apologetic and was still able to put together a table for us. They had to move two ladies who were already dining to do so, which was a little awkward as we would have waited, but they women weren't too bothered so it all worked out. Our server Lou was excellent. To start, he offered immediately to split all of our checks as we were a large group so that was highly appreciated and made checking out at the end much easier. They have a huge beer menu and although most of us had no problem ordering, a few people were overwhelmed and had trouble picking a beer, but Lou was very patient and answered all their questions and helped them select a beer. If Lou is you're server, he'll take care of you!Food was good. Nothing really blew me away though. I had their cheeseburger which came with fries for $16, not too bad. Also tried their corn off the cob which is seasoned to taste like chili, it was really good. We also ordered a few bar pretzels for our tables, they came out super hot and really crusty, not too salty, I definitely recommend those. At the end of the night I think I paid maybe $35ish for dinner, beer and an app which is pricey for me, but for NYC it's what I was expecting. If I'm hanging out in the area, I'm glad to know there's a really decent restaurant I'd be happy to go back to.Ps, their brunch menu looks really amazing, and very affordable.",

But this is The Randolph at Broome and not some obscure leftist political fantasy pun spun by my mental wanderings.I was in Chinatown and needed to kill some time before dinner. Where to go for a cocktail? Enter The Randolph and a very special feature- happy hour.Not just any happy hour but an epic happy hour that lasts from 8am - 8pm. And a happy hour that applies to cocktails that usually cost $14.I mean, let's be honest-- cocktails can cost a lot so cutting the price in half makes me twice as happy, to save money and drink more. It's as if economic frugality married alcoholic irresponsibility.And the cocktails aren't just some run of the mill mixes but rather the offspring of Milk and Honey's Matty Gee.The interior can best be described as exhibiting the look of gentrified divedom. As in, let's try and reproduce what a worn, time tested bar looks like but include the creature comforts of wifi and general cleanliness. It's a small space, maybe a little bit bigger than my apartment and includes a few booths and..a piano.

I liked the presentation and taste of candied ginger on a toothpick draped atop the glass. The cocktail itself was light and refreshing, the kind of drink that doesn't really pack a powerful punch so as to make longer lingering at the bar possible.

I am a little cautious to give it such a rave review for fear that it will become crowded and difficult to grab delicious mixology style cocktails for $8 during happy hour, but i really do love it here.The house cocktails are fantastic, especially the gin based ones!  However there aren't any that I would not recommend.The manager is also awesome.  He takes A LOT of pride in his establishment and cares about every drink he pours, which is very refreshing.There is also a good amount of outdoor seating - which is a huge plus.",6

Bartenders are a good time, the Dj was playing good music, and everyone was having fun. The cocktails were good and flowing. The tequila shots with a sangrita back are a lot of fun.

46,,6/10/2013,18,,"San Francisco, CA",Jeff L.,9,3.0,144,I met a friend here for drinks during their happy hour. Their bartender was working very slowly - though partially because the drinks are relatively complicated - and there was another bartender there (my friend is regular and he pointed him out) who wasn't making drinks despite many people waiting for drinks.  Maybe they don't feel like making $8 cocktails is worth their time? The drinks themselves were okay - more effort seemed to be in the presentation of the drink than in the taste of the drink.The bar emptied out after happy hour ended because the price of drinks went up by $6 and we left for dinner shortly thereafter.It suits its purpose - it's a decent place to get drinks that wasn't too loud.,
47,2,4/18/2012,159,3,"Los Angeles, CA",J R.,378,3.0,245,"We were walking around the LES on a Sunday evening to grab a drink and stumbled into this bar. They had outdoor seating in the front and an empty wooden bar inside with a motorcycle on display. From the looks of it, they serve coffee and bagels/muffins earlier on in the day and then transform into full bar mode at night. What a clever decepticon.The crowd was pretty chill, seemed like everyone was grabbing their last drink before the work week began. The bartender with a 5 o'clock mustache, plaid short sleeve shirt and boat shoes was a bit pretentious and in his own little world. The bar was nearly empty and he took his time coming around to us. I asked what the happy hour cocktails included and he said the cocktails on the menu. Then he quickly asked the girl next to me what she wanted before I could say supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. My follow up question was the happy hour price because the menu listed the cocktails at $14/each. After going to a myriad of fine cocktail bars, I know where to spend my money and where to say, ""hold up, wait a minute."" Later, he told me they were $8/each. The cocktails were made carefully, tasted fresh and were strong. We ordered a bourbon based drink and a gin based drink. Both were quite enjoyable however I wished the bourbon based drink came with large ice cubes rather than crushed ice. In the summer time, I could see this place getting packed. The street it's located on is fairly quiet. I'd recommend coming here on off days during happy hour when it's nice out to catch up with an old friend, hang with friends or even bring a casual date.Happy hour runs until 8 PM, only includes cocktails and there's no beer on tap, only bottles. I've said my piece. Peace.",4

My americano was good and the place was empty so if you have a large group and want to get breakfast, this might be the place. Didn't have any of their food though. Or if your interested in doing work in the morning and want an empty spot to drink coffee. I imagine it gets crowded at night.

52,,2/6/2012,27,2,"Brooklyn, NY",Mike C.,0,5.0,65,"The Randolph, or Rando (trying to make that happen), is my favorite bar in New York.  On Saturday afternoons when people are strangling each other with knit scarves to get seats at any other coffee place in Soho, the Rando is empty except for one dude tapping away at a macbook and me and my awkward friends playing bananagrams. During the day, Rando serves up excellent and expensive coffee cocktails made with foolproof beans (Intellegentsia, Counter Culture, Oslo etc.) as well as a happy hour so generous it's almost philanthropy. It's half priced cocktails ($7) til 8PM and lesser deals on beers and shots. The catch is that the full priced cocktails are not worth it; they're good but not Angel's Share/Little Branch/Milk & Honey good. The best part is that the Rando is willing to entertain any experience you want to have. If you want to come alone and bend an ear the beardy bartenders got sass but it's all in good fun, and seem generally cool. If you want to read or work, it's the only bar I've found in New York in which you will not be out of place (at least until 8PM on weekends). If you want to get wild, late nights can get that way though some days are inexplicably quiet (consult your almanac).

We were not seated before long before they served our drinks and some wonderfully aromatic coffee to warm us up. I ordered the kale hash with sweet potatoes and a fried egg, served in a cast iron pan. The bbq sauce on top was apparently homemade and perfectly balanced, salty and sweet. Thanks to the cast iron pan it was served in, my meal stayed warm for a long time (which matters when it is 10 deg F outside!) Our favorite part of the experience was the service. One of the house managers (Andrea) took great care of us. She was interesting/engaging to talk to, and brought us free pizza popcorn while we hung out at the bar. We got deep into conversation with some new friends who were sitting next to us. They didn't rush us out, even though we had stopped eating/drinking and they were busy.

There are a couple of wooden booths, each usually decorated with well-dressed hipsters (an oxymoron, I'm aware) or a seemingly well-meaning business professional or four, and of course your occasional New York douche if it's a bit later in the evening. This is a dive without being a dive, do don't come here expecting an assortment of beers on tap. If I remember correctly, which is unlikely, the co-owner/bartender is from Austin. Everything is an obvious extension of this, minus a cheesy burnt orange UT banner. The bartenders are friendly and will pay attention to you and your cocktail if it's not super busy. They focus on ingredients here, too, but are careful not to refer to themselves as mixologists when asked. If you're in the area and want something with a relaxed vibe, give this place a go. For what it's worth, everyone I have brought here has come back again on their own. For what it's also worth, I almost never bring people here that are not originally from Texas.",3

I strolled in here on a drab weekend afternoon, in search of a fancy coffee. I'd heard that the bartenders here craft speciality coffee drinks with all the rigor of a cocktail. I wasn't disappointed: my coffee contained french-pressed Intelligentsia, brewed right in front of me, agave-and-sasparilla syrup, just-shaken cream poured over the back of a spoon so it rested on top of the coffee just so, and a few drops of birch essence and salt. It was, in a word, sublime.About the price: the ""augmented coffees"" are $7 without the alcohol. But think of it this way: in this area, you'd pay $14 for a cocktail, and what you're getting here for half the price is a coffee cocktail. And on a Sunday afternoon, it's so much more appropriate to get drugged up on caffeine than alcohol.(For those of you looking for something simpler, you can get a range of freshly pressed coffee for $4. Don't come asking for espresso though--you won't find it here.)So far, the bar remains empty during the afternoons, and the bartender admitted that most patrons don't really know about the Randolph's coffee element.

As for the drinks, they have great summer cocktails AND great winter cocktails. I love the seasonal element and ability to always find something unique to drink there, regardless of the mood.

Wherever you choose to install yourself, you'll probably stay for at least one round longer than you intended.As if all that weren't enough, I had the best bathroom queue vibe of all time on a busy Friday night. A handful of gals and guys waited for the two bathrooms, positively bantering; I (in a characteristic fit of brattiness) was grumbling (to ""myself"") about having been on my feet for 10 hours and just wanting to sit down, and the lass ahead of me in line offered to let me go first.

Once past the velvet ropes of this easy-to-miss bar, we walked in and were immediately pleased with the casual vibe and not-too-crowded feel.

My bartender, Justin, made us some concoction that I wouldn't even be able to follow direction if I tried to make it myself. I think it had rose water, orange, vodka, cucumber? I have no clue but it was so good. Forget about the other wanna-bes with their overpriced menu choices, this is IT. Luckily they have happy hour specials or I'd spend my whole paycheck here. :)",2

128,,1/5/2011,2,,"Denver, CO",Mathew M.,7,4.0,21,"Stopped here for a cup of coffee because of a NYTimes recommendation (and was staying just upstairs at Sohotel). I can't speak to the Randolph as a bar, but as a coffee shop it was a... singular experience? An interesting take on what a coffee can be. Maybe I was a bit unprepared, but my ""augmented"" coffee didn't quite sit right on my palette. An A for effort though, and for shaking things up a bit.",

131,,1/16/2012,3,,"Los Angeles, CA",Ly N.,0,2.0,8,My boyfriend and I were killing some time before we got a cab to the airport. We decided to grab hot chocolates from The Randolph as it was next door to our hotel. The hot chocolate tasted so bad/weird and watery. We couldn't finish them. So gross. Liked the ambiance of the bar though and it is probably cool at night. Scared to think what the coffee tastes like. Probably safer to order an alcoholic beverage next time.,1
132,,3/24/2010,136,,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",Christian R.,24,4.0,350,"I went here on a Saturday night with my friend and was delighted.  A bit hesitant at first because of the curtains- which signaled that it might be a over-poshed club with bouncers and a bag check, but complete opposite.  Hip, film crowds held sway. Great lounge relaxed aura- standard beer selection and great, friendly, bad ass bartenders.  It just seemed like everyone was having a good time.",
133,,8/26/2010,16,,"Monmouth, NJ",Scott V.,3,5.0,6,"We have now become regulars at the Randolph and make it a point to visit them when we are in the city.  The drinks are intoxicatingly good followed by the bartenders who are passionate on making you an excellent cocktail whether it be of there menu or just tell them what you like.  You must try the pickle back shots when you go there, they are by far the best, trust me!",

136,3,4/7/2008,13,4,"New York, NY",Kevin P.,0,3.0,21,"It took us awhile to find the place as it has no markings or numbers what so ever on the outside.  Bouncer man was somewhat difficult.  Upstairs was typical bar-lounge average.  Downstairs is definitely just a frat basement painted black which is fine by me.  The randolph seemed ten times better after drowning myself in hoegaardens.One star for decent music and crowd.  Two stars for serving hoegaarden on tap.  Three stars for being the starting point of the story below:So after the typical drunken depravity, we find ourselves sitting on the steps of the west 4th subway station waiting for the train to take us somewhere to pass out.  We're probably on the 6th or 7th step up from the bottom, and i start to hear what sounds like water being poured on the ground.  I look over to see my friend ""joe"" (yes the same ""joe"" from new years at roseland ballroom; look it up) and, lo and behold, what do i see?  I see Joe sitting there with his man piece firmly gripped between his hands pissing all over himself and down the stairs with a diabolical grin on his face.  He was waving his member back and forth like a firefighter trying to put out a fire on the steps below.  I couldn't see from the tears in my eyes and i almost fell into the train tracks i was laughing so hard.  Joe was so hammered he demanded to stop at 3 pizza places on the way home ordering slices of pepperoni with pee soaked pants.  Thanks randolph!  He's going to kill me one of these days for posting all of this shit on yelp.  Oh yeah, watch were you step if you find yourself at west 4th subway station.",1

138,1,11/10/2007,10,,"New York, NY",kawan t.,0,2.0,80,"so i came here for a birthday party for a friend of a friend, so i sort of walked into this place apprehensive because i didnt know anyone yet excited because it seemed like a pretty cool bar--but its in weird place down in the lighting district/little italy/chinatown area with not a lot going on. what was awesome is that we saw heath ledger right before we walked in, so that made it fun already!its really small. the bar takes up about half the width of the place and the seating along the wall makes it awkward to have to stand because you're right in the way of everyone trying to get by. the music was a little too loud and the mix of songs was really strange, from bell biv devoe, boys to men, to kanye west. anyway so the bar was packed, and it took a while to get a drink. overall the experience was less than mediocre.but, everyone there was gorgeous, guys and girls, but cant tell you if it was the normal crowd because it was for a birthday. bottom line, will i go back? not too likely.",1
139,,11/14/2011,0,,"Boston, MA",mike s.,0,1.0,13,"ok, so i somewhat agree with a previous reviewer, Andrew.  The bartender was inadequate and unfriendly.  The coffee is listed for one price but they charge another (allegedly costs more to have coffee to stay).  Too much competition to be rude when serving coffee or liquor.  I disagree with Andrew regarding his nasty bully name calling (a bully doesn't stand up for himself when frightened, either, just name calls when he feels proetected).  Sounds like Andrew might have some 'hidden' inadequacy himself !!",

145,,7/23/2008,1,4,"Brooklyn, NY",Jessica H.,0,4.0,21,"I feel it necessary to start my review by saying that I went here on a Tuesday night.  And regardless of what the Sinatra song says, New York sleeps on Tuesday night in Nolita.  This bar was no exception.  Definitely did not encounter a bouncer or attitude.  What I did find was a bar that was totally unmarked from the outside, with the exception of some very lonely red velvet ropes, and maybe 5 people were inside. I went with a group of girls and we were treated very well by the bartenders/waiters.  It was a great place to end the night and talk and drink.  Mellow vibe and good drinks.  They even threw in some shots.  The bartenders pride themselves on figuring out a drink you'll like (just ask them to ""surprise you"").  At least from the menu it looked like the beer selections were very limited.  That was okay for the night since I was drinking liquor, but on another night I might not be so happy, since I love my beer.  The menu didn't have prices that I could tell (I was a little tipsy so maybe it does and I couldn't focus long enough to see), so we were happy when the bill came and was very reasonable.  Also, ask the bartenders about the ice - supposedly they freeze all of their liquor and glasses which makes the ice last longer.  If it's true, it's a nice touch.  They love their ice, man.",
