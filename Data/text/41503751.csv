0,Jason T.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1397,103,54,4.0,11/14/2018,"Went with friends and it was for sure a nice social chic yet established feelIf you want romantic and privacy (not your spot) as tables are super close- too close downstairsWe shared small plates - oysters, cabbage, taquitos and lettuce wraps oh and dumplings -All great - dumplings should of been warmer - cheese was a bit congealed. Whole bronzino and chicken and waffles (waffles so gooood) chicken was just ok.Finished with donuts- fresh and warm. Sauces seemed bottled. Overall 4.3 stars. Nice friends meet up spot",1,,
1,Kim M.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,78,47,5.0,10/21/2018,"I met a girlfriend here for drinks and dinner on a Friday night. Stanton Social did not disappoint! We made an 8:15 reservation but first grabbed a drink at the upstairs bar. The space is beautiful and has great ambiance. Downstairs has high ceilings. The upstairs bar isn't huge -- it felt intimate without feeling too crammed. There's also a lounge area and some tables where folks were eating up there. There was a happy hour happening ($9 red wine and a special cocktail) but I needed something a little stuffed and had an overpriced Manhattan instead ($18). The bartender gave us recommendations on the food so we were ready when it was time to eat! When we went downstairs for our table, our server was warm and friendly (and easy on the eyes!). We shared four of the small plates and couldn't even finish it all. The salmon ceviche is incredible. I could toss back two orders of those babies. The French onion dumplings were unique and tasty but I wasn't as blown away as other reviews have raved. The meatballs also really hit the spot! Get them!!! We also had the chicken and waffles sliders, which were just okay. It was a little dry. Maybe it needed a drizzle of maple syrup (not sure there was anything on there besides just literally chicken and waffle). The chicken had good flavor though and was cooked well.I highly recommend this spot. I can't wait to go back!",,,
2,Melissa D.,"Near West Side, Chicago, IL",165,37,85,5.0,10/12/2018,"Visiting from Chicago, this place is exactly what I would have pictured for a typical NYC dinner restaurant. It has a sexy and sophisticated interior and has incredibly flavorful mix of shared plates. The menu is a hodgepodge of different types of items, from pierogies to chicken n waffles to the famous french onion soup dumplings (a must try here!). I went with a group of friends and our eyes were definitely larger than our stomachs and we ended up with too much food. So good luck trying to settle on just a few items because everything legit sounded amazing and it was!They course the plates out for you. We got started with the Beef & Broccoli-one of my favorite things we had. It was a sticky rice cake, covered in the most flavorful braised short rib and a broccoli puree. YUM!My other absolute favorite was the French Onion Soup Dumplings. This is a MUST TRY when you come here. I think I saw every single table had ordered this and with good reason. They come in a mini crock pot type style dish covered in melted cheeses. They are a little tricky to get out but worth the trouble. Absolutely fantastic and love that it is a twist you won't see anywhere else. The Social Mac & Cheese was fantastic as well. Crazy cheesy and covered in bread crumbs with a kick in it as well. We also tried some of the sliders and also the meatballs (good and flavorful but other things were much more intriguing).Overall, a beautiful restaurant with great service and an amazing selection of fun foods with a twist that you most likely won't see anywhere else. Next visit back to New York, this place will definitely be on my list!Tip: You should definitely make reservations to ensure you can get in. Reservations open 30 days beforehand, which I booked on Open Table and time slots were starting to already booking up!",1,,
3,Sampath D.,"San Francisco, CA",361,136,294,5.0,9/15/2018,"Incredibly unique brunch experience. Instead of each person ordering their own dish like in traditional brunch, people share small breakfast dishes (like tapas), both sweet and savory. It is very affordable relative to other brunch spots in New York City.For dishes, we split the Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies, the bruschetta, the doughnuts, the oreo pancakes, and the vegetarian slider. the pierogies were easily the best dish with the goat cheese being extremely rich. The bruschetta was also really good with great tomato sauce and a great serving of scrambled eggs. The vegetarian slider was pretty standard - kind of overpriced considering you only get one. The best dish was easily the oreo pancakes (we actually got two of them). The pancake itself is really good - very sweet and rich with a great light oreo taste. Then you mix in the cream and little oreo pieces and syrup (just a little though) and it is like you are walking on air.Would definitely recommend coming here in the future and hopefully I can try to come here next time I visit NYC.",,1,
4,Manna C.,"New York, NY",300,130,421,4.0,8/15/2018,"Bit conflicted about Stanton Social. It's been on the list for so long for those french onion soup dumplings but I wasn't that impressed. It's rather difficult to pull out with just the toothpick and had to use my fork. The cheese hardens quickly. Don't get me wrong - I like french onion soup but it really didn't blow me away. Nice to try though. Chicken taquitos did not win me over either. I should have realized when the waiter thought I wanted tacos instead. Mac and cheese was ok but I probably wouldn't get it again. What I did like though were the pierogis. They were yummy, especially the sauce that came with it. My favorite part of Stanton Social would be the lounge/bar upstairs. Amazing happy hour upstairs Sunday to Friday from 5PM until close. $5 beer, $7 wine, $10 cocktail of the month (mango margarita atm) and $4 snacks/sliders. I'll probably be back here for the happy hour. Another thing important to note - the portions are relatively small. So if you have a big appetite, then don't be surprised by the larger bill.",2,,2
5,Stephanie A.,"Plantation, FL",123,99,389,4.0,10/15/2018,Very cute spot. All appetizer styles entrees . The food was pretty good. Only issues was that it took long to be seated. It was a large party. Our reservation was at 9 but we were not seated until 9:30. Just stood around in a very tight spot even though all 8 of us arrived on time. My favorite thing was the drink called strawberry field. Best drink I had at a spot in this area . I had three and they were all consistent.,1,,1
6,Johnny G.,"New York, NY",192,228,220,4.0,8/9/2018,"Invite your mom, dad, neighbor, supervisor, your poker buddies, the homeless guy from the train; the more the merrier. This place is not only made for large groups it's encouraged. The menu is based on creative, American style tapas to share amongst the group. We had a group of 8 for restaurant week so we got the fixated menu as well other popular items and cocktails. You such a family feel - you passing plates around the table, taking which one you enjoy, yada yada yada. I assumed because they were tapas if wouldn't be filling but they were surprisingly a lot of leftover. The only tapas i could careless for is the blue cheese waffle which came with the Nashville fried chicken (super dope!) but the waffle tasted sour. I feel probably get shunned by Stanton Socialist but the French Onion soup dumplings were too sweet and concentrated. The hard shell tacos, taquitos and Nashville chicken was by far my favorite bites. The doughnut holes are the perfect way to end a meal.",1,,
7,Carmen K.,"New York, NY",12,150,179,5.0,10/2/2018,"This is my go to for brunch when the weather sucks, when I want to impress anyone, or just basically when I wanna brunch. Super chic place where you feel really comfy, but also really feelin yourself. The food is amazing and on point, as well. You need to bring people here, this is tapas, you have to get everything on the menu and share and try them all.",,,
8,Lindsey S.,"Queens, NY",178,20,102,5.0,11/11/2018,"I've come several times and always had a good experience. The upstairs bar/lounge area was unfortunately closed this most recent time for a private event so we were unable to grab a drink before sitting to eat. Came with two girlfriends to celebrate my birthday. I love that it's tapas style food so you get to try lots of different things without feeling like you've over-eaten. And of course the bills adds up -- but worth it. Definitely make sure to have the French Onion Soup Dumplings. It's there signature dish, and for good reason! The flavors of all the food are great and each time just leaves me excited to come back again soon!",,,
9,Yeni D.,"Naples, FL",28,123,390,4.0,9/8/2018,"Chic, somewhat upscale & sophisticated, lounge type restaurant. This place screams quintessential NYC to me. Dark ambiance & all plates are essentially tapas made for sharing/tasting. Upstairs offers a bar. Overall was 3.5/5 for me.",2,,
10,Kristy B.,"New York, NY",202,215,342,5.0,9/5/2018,What can I say!! The stars speak for it all. I really like it when a place tries to excel at all spheres and provide you with the best of an experience. They had happy hour all night for Tuesday's with great drink pricesss...$5 wine and beer I think ( and the quality wasn't compromised). Now let me talk about food coz that was the highlight of my day. The food here is so delicious and their happy hour menu is so extensive that you could try many different dishes. They are so delicious. They have a restaurant downstairs and a huge lounge cum bar upstairs. We had the bar all to ourselves on a Tuesday night which made it even better. Not crowded for a change.,1,1,1
11,Sheena K.,"New York, NY",327,79,96,5.0,9/14/2018,"Obsesssssed!!! The food, the service, the ambiance = all amazing. We made a reservation for 9 and it was a bit of a wait but luckily they have a bar upstairs which was a great past time I barely felt like I waited. When we got seated our waiter was very sweet and attentive. We ordered the tuna tacos, fish tacos, French onion dumplings and the goat cheese pierogis. The tuna tacos were amazinggggg as well as the fish tacos. I enjoyed the French onion dumplings, I think the concept is cool, but I personally don't like the flavor of French onion soup although I still think this is a special dish and everyone should try it once. But the life changing dish was the goat cheese pierogis with truffle creme fraiche on the side. I WISH I could've taken that creme fraiche home I would put it on everything. Great experience here and def excited to try other things on the menu!",,,
12,Cesca T.,"Detroit, MI",10,61,155,5.0,5/22/2018,"I've been to Stanton Social twice now, and both times I've not only been super impressed, and totally sated, but I've literally gotten food drunk. The small plates-style menu is supremely appetizing, and expertly executed.  The hardest part about going to Stanton Social is winnowing down your choices from a menu where EVERYTHING sounds so good.  And the wait staff couldn't be nicer, and more pleasant.  Everyone is friendly and welcoming. I've had an amazing, Friday night dinner here. Where the atmosphere is stylish and sexy, up on the third floor where the music plays loud enough where you have to lean in and get close to talk, and the incandescent lighting lends itself to a modern romantic atmosphere. And each craft cocktail tastes better than the last. I've also had a lovely, leisurely brunch where sunlight fills the main floor dining room, while delicious dishes like the croque monsieur satays and pillowy goat cheese pierogies fill my belly.  From the high-brow taquitos to the sherry-tinged French onion soup dumplings, each dish impresses without pretension.  It's food that most everyone would want to eat, done with the level of precision that stuffier restaurants boast, in an atmosphere that is young and fun. One of my favorite NYC restaurants.",1,,1
13,Paul N.,"Cincinnati, OH",293,59,13,4.0,8/5/2018,"So Chris Santos is one of my favorite celebrity chefs from food network. Whenever I see Chopped After Hours, I just like his style of cooking. It's always comfort with a flare. So when I saw his restaurant on Best Things I Ever Ate, I was sold and had to go. The restaurant has a good flow of guest, so definitely advise bigger parties to get a reservation. We just decided to go upstairs to the bar for their happy hour special even though we had a reservation. I LOVE the bar area, it's definitely more of a lounge with wrap around couches, cool intimate lighting, and also great music selection. We ordered a few things and drinks to start. First, the drinks were meh. I would have expected better flavors, but it seemed watered down. So disappointing there, but the food was awesome. We had the French Onion Soup Dumplings, the Beet Salad, the Salmon Ceviche, Raw Oysters, Meatball Sliders, and Grilled Shrimp Sliders. I would say the best items were the Shrimp Sliders, the Meatball Sliders, and the Beet Salad took the win. But overall, all the dishes were delish. Everything is served like tapas style, so the concept encourages little bites and socializing. So no questions for me, Stanton Social is a hit spot to visit while in NYC!",1,,2

Updated review","this is one of those places that has a lot of hype and you are just not sure if it is hype or the real deal. Based on my experience, I can confirm it is the real deal. Now let me preface the review with the fact that it isnt inexpensive but you have to pay for quality and in my opinion is well worth it.We tried a whole bunch of stuff. The cheeseburger sliders were ridiculous. The tuna tacos incredible. The korean tacos were probably my favorite item. I also liked the buffalo cauliflower because they had the great buffalo flavor as well as a nice crunch. Food was insane. Thats all I can say.  The only thing I did not care for was the flatbread. It had a little bit of a funky taste to it. The drinks were not up to par to be honest. I ordered an old fashioned and it was NOT made correctly. I switched to a regular mixed drink after that. The people I was with liked the cocktails they ordered off the menu but seems like if you steer away from the menu they struggle.Overall, this was a great experience. The decor is modern and I feel like the food has improved since the last time I was here. I will definitely be back.",5,,4
15,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,1.0,2/11/2018,"This place is a DISASTER! I made dinner reservations for my friend's birthday and it was also winter restaurant week. We were 15 minutes late. So they decided to seat us by the freezing entrance area. I specifically told the waiter that it was a friend's birthday (from opentable too) and that I wanted a candle on her dessert. They COMPLETELY FORGOT. HUGE embarrassing moment when we had to get up and tell the waiter that he forgot. So he brought out an extra cupcake WHILE we were eating dessert WITH THE CHECK. who in the right mind does that?I was furious. He kept rushing us to finish and we didn't even get a proper celebration. First course:- Chicken taquitos: Boring. - Potato & goat cheese pierogies: My favorite but I love cheese and potato. My friends hated it. You could barely taste the truffle as described. - Fish tacos: Missing the ""creamy avocado"" Fish was like a puree. Couldn't tell. It tasted decent. Second course: - Fried chicken & waffles: Chicken was nicely fried and spicy. The waffles were very dry.. no one touched it. - Brussel sprouts ravioli: PLEASE DO NOT GET. It came in 3 tiny pieces. I felt that it was undercooked. I love brussel sprouts and this dish just didn't work. - Sesame spiced salmon: The seasoning they had on top was extremely salty and the fish itself was bland. The sprouts did not help and the sauce tasted like big mac......Third course:- Chocolate panna cotta: Tasted exactly like jello's chocolate pudding. - Guinesss toffee cake: The baileys ice cream was very good. The toffee cake was spongy and sweet. - Les doughnuts: What is the hype about this? The donuts were like microwaved hot and the sauces extremely sweet and not memorable.",7,1,
16,Mark R.,"Double Oak, TX",4,100,2,5.0,8/13/2018,"Chicken and waffles. Yawn. Chicken and blue corn waffles stuffed with blue cheese? #KaPow! Maybe it's the neighborhood, maybe it was the Restaurant Week thing, or maybe it was the extremely fantastic food that made this one of the best meals I've had in NYC in awhile. We started with goat cheese pirogues, beet salad and fish tacos. All three were great. Seriously large portions. Would have any of them again in a heartbeat.Then we moved to the baby back ribs, salmon and the previously mentioned chicken and waffles. Again, excellent portions and amazing flavor. Finally, the orange creamsicle shot, lemon panna cotta and les doughnuts. I never order panda cotta--and now I definitely won't order it...any where else. It was so good I know I'll just be disappointed anywhere else. The Stanton Social ruined me for panna cotta. The doughnuts were as good as they sound and the orange creamsicle shot was tasty and novel. Service was solid, atmosphere was fun. Not a single negative part of the entire experience. Rare. Appreciated.",,1,1

Our server, hostess, really everyone that we interacted with was extremely pleasant.Even for a Monday evening (MLK day), the restaurant was impressively full. Prices are high, but I'd say worth it.

18,Nadia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,229,916,5.0,7/5/2018,"I came here to celebrate my birthday and I must say I had a great time.  It was a last minute decision and I was able to score a table for two at 7pm. As soon as we arrived we were seated at a booth where I could view the entire restaurant. The lights are dimly set and the appearance of this place screams sexy. Our waiter Joe was 5*. He was extremely polite, attentive and gave great suggestions and was able to answer our questions. To say the least he was simply amazing. We were offered an amuse-bouche that was a cold watermelon gazpacho. It was very refreshing and had little pieces of cucumbers. Very goodCocktails:1. Sage Advice- the sage was present in this drink. With the sweetness of the mango2. Mi Gente- for the mezcal lovers. This was refreshing with the use of cucumbers.3. Strawberry Fields- more on the sweet side. Almost like a strawberry daiquiri. It was good and not overpowering. 4  Lost In Polanco- hope you like jalapenos because this is a spicy drink and also really good. As you can tell I love spicy things. The food is mainly served family style which is great so you can get a taste of everything.Food:1. Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos- the tuna was so refreshing. The wontons were crispy. The mango and avocado gave it a sweet and savory  taste. I would get this again.2. French Onion Soup Dumplings- if you love French Onion soup you will love this dish. The dumplings are filled with the onion soup. And topped with baked gruyere cheese and  skewered baked croutons on top. It was good nice and cheese with a pop of the dumpling in your mouth releasing the onion soup onto your taste buds. I wouldn't order it again but I did enjoy it.3. East and West Coast Oysters- very fresh. There was a tequila ice like topping, a mignonette with the regulars. It was really good. I will definitely reorder4. Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas- this dish made my taste buds do the happy dance. The chicken was seasoned to perfection. The avocado and the jalapeno were so good. I didn't think it was overly spicy. It was just right. I would order this again in a heartbeat.5. Spiced Sesame Salmon- this was made to your desired specifications and it was cooked to perfection. The flavors were great. Unfortunately, the radish and cucumber were a bit salty underneath. I'm not a salmon fan but it was good and I would recommend it.I definitely enjoyed this place. The atmosphere, food, drinks and service were all on point. We were given a drink on the house due to the saltiness in my salmon dish. It was a great start to the weekend and I will be back to try new dishes.",1,,

20,M N.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,23,16,2.0,10/2/2018,"Service here is SLOWWWW. It took 20 min to get a stale glass of wine that I ended up sending back, waited 10 min for the next one, which was even worse. Ended up just drinking vodka soda.The space is quite tight; if you're tall you wont have any leg room to actually relax and getting up, forget about it. I had to wait for my party to get up so I can move the little table without squishing anyone feet or legs. got the ahi wonton tacos, they were salty.Also, asked the waitress to start a separate tab for myself to make it easier when the bill comes since I showed up last, she added mine to the original and they weren't even able to split it 4 ways...what I was trying to avoid in the first place.

She smilingly took our orders and brought out drinks and food quickly. Most of the food  items we tried were pretty good. We went through a whole lot of fries and the chicken and waffle! You definitely shouldn't miss them. Didn't like the shrimp slider as much, but the salmon ceviche and fish taco was really good. The $1 oysters didn't feel to fresh but we still found them decent and ordered quite a few of them. The mini burgers, mac n cheese were also pretty good. I think more than dining this place is perfect if you have a big group. The food items offered are perfect for comfort food and even taste good. I liked the happy hour menu and would highly recommend staying in the bar area if you are looking for some place nice and happening and yet reasonably priced.",4,,2

29,Katie B.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,187,15,5.0,3/2/2018,"I came here on a Thursday night to celebrate my birthday.This place is best with a party of about 5-6 who are willing to try a variety of dishes. I came with a party of 5 and was advised to order about 10 dishes. We did, then got more and it was way too much food, but it was fun and delicious all the same.The SPOT:When I walked in at 6:30, it was totally empty, but by the end of the meal the place was totally packed. The location is great and the interior is super trendy.The SERVICE: Our waitress was awesome, super helpful with suggestions and attentive. The only real issue we had with the service was that they attempted to switch out our plates for fresh ones in the middle of one of the courses. We declined, but allowed them to do it before the next course started. They cleared our plates, but then the food was dropped off and we still had to wait for our new, clean plates. Womp womp. Also, our waiter had a trainee waiter following behind her. I assumed that was the story, but some of the people in my party would've really appreciated an explanation earlier in the meal. Oh well.The FOOD:1. Potato & Goat Cheese - what could be bad about these? Plus the truffle creme fraiche it's served with was delicious and I totally used it on my lolli-popcorn shrimp. (See # 8)2. House Salad - The avocado green goddess was herby and fun. (On a personal note, the beet salad sounded way more interesting, but others at the table don't eat beets,) but overall it was a nice salad with great depth of flavor.3. French Onion Soup Dumplings - They warn you these are hot. You should listen. I didn't and it burnt my tongue, but being the birthday girl I got to have the leftover dumpling and have a redo. They're really yummy. (Much preferred to the Beauty & Essex sister restaurant version of the tomato soup with grilled cheese croutons.)4. Crispy Barrio-Style Chicken Taquitos - I didn't have high expectations for this dish, but it wound up being one of my favorites. They look like they're sitting in a pool of sriracha, but it's actually a very mild red sauce. The avocado and crema on top really compliment the dish.5. Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas - As someone dating a Venezuelan, I have high standards for arepas, which I suppose on second thought isn't super fair of me. But these weren't at all what I was expecting. These were more like tacos. I liked them, but they totally aren't mini-arepas.6. Korean Tacos - these have a very subtle kick. Everyone was worried about the heat from the kimchi, but again the kimchi was super mild. But these have a nice sweet tang to them. I enjoyed it immensely.7. Beef & Broccoli - this was one of my favorites of the evening. The broccoli puree is barely noticeable. And the short rib is super tasty.8. Lolli-Popcorn Shrimp - definitely my least favorite dish, but they weren't terrible. The shrimp was just a bit tough to chomp on. I also wasn't crazy about the different dipping sauces, but that truffle creme fraiche was bomb and I was very happy to still have it on my plate.9. Old School Meatballs - These were so yummy. So, so, so yummy. I haven't had a meatball that compares to these in a very long time.10. Chicken n' Waffles - The chicken is spicy. It does say that it's Nashville hot fried chicken on the menu, so maybe we should've been prepared, but as it was not drenched in hot sauce like I am used to, I wasn't totally prepared for it, but it was yummy. The waffles were soft and tasty, but my favorite part was the pickle garnish, heheh.Now, without realizing this, I had made a reservation at a restaurant that one of my dining companions had a familial connection to. What a lucky coincidence! He sent over two more dishes (and dessert!)11. Brussels Sprout Ravioli - I looooovveee brussels sprouts and cranberries. These were excellent, but very rich.12. Social Mac & Cheese - This was excellent, but definitely rich and a bit spicy too. Plus mac n cheese topped with breadcrumbs seems like a wasted opportunity for cheesy goodness, but I still liked this dish a lot. It's nice to hide veggies in. And if this was more of a traditional resto I probably would have ordered this as a side to what we were eating, but when there're so many other goodies...Dessert was super fun, I had to get the birthdy cake milkshake shot, which is lined with birthday sprinkles. Fun! Cute! Boozy!They brought me a birthday cupcake, which didn't look like anything exciting, but the cake was so decadent and it had key lime icing. YUMMMMM!They brought out two chocolate panna cottas, super delightful and rich!And the LES doughnuts!!! Yummy. Plus the waitress made me feel vindicated when she said everyone winds up eating the accompanying sauces with a spoon when they run out of donuts.Overall, super fun night. Can't wait to return.",2,,2

I cross checked with my trusty Yelpers, and it did not disappoint. It was super easy to make a reservation through Open Table, and they called the day before to confirm. I had a vodka martini (extra dirty, of course), the scallops (which were out of this world!), the salmon filets, and one other dish that wasn't too memorable.Although they are tapas style/small plates, they were pretty generous in portions in comparison to other similar restaurants. I came pretty hungry, and although the waiter recommended 4 plates for two people to share, we only had three along with a sorbet dessert....you have to get the peach and also the coconut flavor! We left totally full. Would come again, thanks Stanton Social!",2,,

The time between each food was brought out was either very well planned or they got lucky. We had a wonderful time eating and chatting. What disappointed me was that they did nothing to fix one of our wobbly tables. In addition, the cocktails were horrendous. We sent back the one that tasted like Red Bull with cough syrup. I'm sorry but when you are a decent place and charge 15 for a drink make it well. Don't just throw something together and expect people to drink it for the sake of it. The food is just yumm! So is their coffee. The donuts with fudge sauce were warm and delicious and their sugar on top was just the right amount. Their banana pancakes were delicious. I loved their beef burgers (more like sliders). Nice flavors and good bun and meat. There was a breakfast bruschetta as well. I mean you cannot go wrong with this right! Nice eggs on top, nice seasoning, tomatoes on a toasted bread. We did order some dessert. None of them wow-ed me really. Except maybe for the chocolate souffle. I personally don't like oreo cake pops so won't comment. The almond spice cake was extremely cinnamon-y. Will I go back here? Just for food, definitely. Don't spend money on drinks or desserts, and you will love their food and ambiance etc. Extremely nice service too!",1,,

We had change our reservation to the day of the superbowl ans they could only have us at 3.45pm, which has fine, until we got there and found out the kitchen and restaurant were closing at 4pm. They honored our reservation, but I didn't understand why they even had that time slot open. They never rushes us and the service was excellent but we felt bad keeping the entire staff there as we finished eating, the only remaining patrons too. It was awkward but thank goodness the food was beyond amazing. Everything we has was next level good and the table set up with high booth was really a great experience.

Quick notes:- They serve their meals family style.- They require a $400 minimum for large parties reserving a table in the upstairs lounge. - For a $15 drink, their house whiskey was trash. - They serve sliders individually. WEIRD. However, I had the lobster roll slider and was impressed with how stuffed the roll was. It also came with chips that were seasoned with what tasted like Old Bay seasoning. It was $11, and I think that price was comparable to full sized lobster rolls. - I tried that infamous fig cocktail and thought it was pretty good. (All specialty cocktails are 16.)They should definitely remove a table from the restaurant area. That place is way too tightly packed.",1,,

The ambiance is dimly lighted but the decor is very classy and chic.Favorites:Tuna Poke Tacos (5/5): my favorites of the night. Love the flavor of the tuna and how the taco shells are wonton chips. Great blend of flavors and textures. Order this!Ribs (5/5): these ribs were delicious. Very moist and the meat falls off the bones. Great flavors.Lobster rolls (5/5): keep in mind that these are 1 per order. Plenty of lobster and the flavors were delicious.Strawberry Fields cocktail (4/5): good cocktail if you like something fruity and sweet. Pieces of strawberry at the bottom could be stuck in the straw, which was kind of annoyingOthers:-French Onion Soup Dumplings (3/5): while these are supposed to be the signature dish here, I didn't find them particularly amazing. They were good, but not my favorites.-Pulled Chicken Arepas: interesting, but not my favorite-Sesame String beans (2/5): this is very similar to the oily vegetables served at Chinese take-out restaurants; would not recommendOverall, I would recommend checking this place out.",1,,3
38,Mike N.,"New York, NY",131,267,50,2.0,1/29/2018,"Given the hype around this place I came in with very high expectations. Unfortunately I left pretty disappointed.Went on a Sunday night for dinner. Made a reservation but didn't seem to need one as the place was about half full. Nice atmosphere and decor, and all the staff was friendly, attentive and overall above average from a service perspective.Now for the food. As it is a 'small plates' style place we went for 4 plates and dessert. We got the Korean style tacos, the french onion soup dumplings, the chicken arepas and the goat cheese pierogies.Far and away the best dish was the goat cheese pierogies. These were phenomenal and came with a truffle dipping sauce which was spectacular. Unfortunately, after the pierogies which came out first, the dishes were downhill from there. The chicken arepas are a pulled chicken with a green salsa and a jalapeno. Outside of the hot pepper, these seemed to lack flavor and was a tiny portion for the $15 price point. The korean tacos weren't bad by any means, however the steak didn't have a very noticeable marinade or flavor, so the steak was somewhat overpowered by the kimchi. And for the french onion soup dumplings, this is a really cool concept and looks awesome. I just didn't think that the actual taste matches up anywhere near the visual aspects of the dish. What I personally enjoy about soup dumplings (the typical kind) is the explosion of broth when you take a bite. These soup dumplings are breaded so the broth is mostly absorbed by the bread, so it doesn't feel too much like a ""soup"" at all. Also the cheese was mostly burned to the point of being hard, so it also lacked the gooey gruyere aspect of french onion soup that I love. Overall, I think that this dish is super unique, but unfortunately from a taste perspective it just wasn't there for me. This place is undeniably unique, and the service / attention to detail is well above average. In my experience, however, the food simply did not match up to the price point and reputation of the restaurant.",1,,

The chicken arepas were very good but the chicken taquitos weren't anything special. The Korean tacos were a little spicy but very good. The Mac and cheese was a heavy disappointment it could have used more cheese on top. The green beans were good. The cauliflower was crispy it was my favorite side. The Philly cheesesteak sliders were on point. My favorite dishes were the ahi tuna poke tacos which had a nice crunchy shell and the cheesey French onion soup dumplings!

Updated review","Had an excellent meal here with a few friends! Everything was perfectly shareable between three people (there was often three of the thing on the plate), so if you have more than that I'd get two of some things. Here's what we had:+ French onion soup dumplings (duh)+ Cobb salad bites+ Crispy fish tacos + House cut fries+ Baby back ribs with mango slaw+ Wild mushroom ravioli + DoughnutsThe dumplings are a must. Cobb bites were good but not too exciting. Tacos were excellent but left me wanting - super small bites. The fries were great, the texture was tougher than usual which I know isn't a great way to explain it, but it was like they were fried more - anyway, it worked. Ribs and ravioli were amazing and the doughnuts were out of this world. Edit 5/2017:As amazing as my first time. Had a boss tweed gimlet and strawberry fields for my cocktails (both amazing), and shared the beef Wellington, French onion soup dumplings and potato and goat cheese pierogies. That beef was pure perfection, and of course you've got to get the dumplings. The pierogies were awesome, too. Our waiter was great.Edit 7/2018: Returned with a few friends and shared the French onion soup dumplings, because duh, as well as the following:+ potato and goat cheese pierogies+ tuna poke wonton tacos+ crispy barrio-style chicken taquitos+ beef and broccoli+ hand pulled chicken arepas+ old school meatballs+ ghost chili kissed buffalo cauliflower + social mac & cheese + LES doughnuts+ banana cakeThe pierogies, meatballs and cauliflower were probably the standouts for me this time around. Desserts were as fabulous as always.",2,1,2

First off half our party was 10 minutes late but they were ok with that and let us head up to the bar to wait. It had a really cozy lounge area. Once our party arrived and we sat down our waiter told us the specials. We were so distracted because he looks like someone but couldn't put a finger on it. He totally looked like Dr. Hunt from Grey's Anatomy.Food was served family style and we tried:Tuna mango taco's : everyone's favorite Potatoes and onion piergoies : my favPopcorn shrimp : smelled and looked amazing but I didn't have due to allergies.The salmon dish : decent liked the salad it came withZucchini ravioliSpiced almond cake with ice cream : omg so goodDoughnuts with 3 flavor dipping saucesOreo cake pops: lol I don't know it really didn't fit in the menu but was goodOverall it was good and we were super stuffed.,,,
44,Bruce G.,"Cross River, NY",1,95,5,2.0,5/29/2018,"When Stanton Social opened a few years ago, it was among the trendiest in the city. The crowd was young, attractive and affluent. The food was creative and trendy. Reservations where hard to come by. Alas, those days are over and Socal has fallen into the eventual abyss of older, not so attractive and still affluent clientele. The food is creative but varies between dishes in quality and the trendiness? Gone. The signature Tuna poke was good as were the French onion soup dumplings. Those are the most common items ordered on their menu and they're still still solid and fun. The Korean tacos were also good with a defined kimchi flavor, good. The charred octopus was awful, we left most on the plate. It was  overwhelmed with discordant flavors including a lamb and lime flavor. Not good. The chicken (fried) & waffles had a mushy layer of breading that was nothing more than a mask for overcooked meat and further mushy waffle. While the service was good and the server was young, fun & beautiful, I can no longer recommend this LES/SoHo classic. Every dog has it's day, Stanton Social's day appears a memory.",2,,
45,Cindy U.,"New York, NY",276,412,694,4.0,2/17/2018,"Number of visits: 3If you haven't had their French Onion Soup Dumplings, you're missing out. This is a super addiction and I crave it pretty often, just haven't found the time to make it over. There's almost always a wait, always a crowd so it's definitely recommended to make reservations. You may still have to wait a little, but it is definitely worth the wait. Came for an early dinner, later dinner and drinks - both food and drinks are amazing. Loved the lobster roll, kobe beef sliders and pierogies. Super romantic location which is perfect for date night, girls night out and a small group get together. Tapas are definitely a great share and I would recommend trying everything on the menu! Service can be a bit slow when it gets a little crazy so patience is really needed.

46,Craig C.,"Jersey City, NJ",143,380,138,4.0,11/28/2017,"Some of the tastiest food I've eaten in NYC, hands down. After searching far and wide for the perfect restaurant, I took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner earlier this month. They've got a lot of space with multiple floors, but even on a Wednesday night this place packed out, so I was happy I made a reservation. KEEP IN MIND: portions here are small, especially for the price. They recommended that we order four dishes for two people.The Stanton Social is the product of Chef / Owner Chris Santos, who some may recognize as one of the judges on the Food Network show Chopped. The food is creative and consists of small plates that are meant for sharing.My girlfriend and I decided we would do things a little different and started with the "" Birthday Cake Milkshake Shots"", which consisted of birthday cake ice cream and Maker's Mark bourbon in a tall shot glass, topped with sprinkles. They were tasty, unique, and got things started on the right foot.For our mains, we went with the French Onion Soup Dumplings, Old School Meatballs, and the Beef Wellington. Everything was fantastic - the French Onion Soup Dumplings were steaming hot, topped with melted cheese, and were basically flavor bombs once you bit into them. The Meatballs, in my opinion, were the least remarkable. They were certainly tasty, but there was nothing too special about them. The Beef Wellington was far and away the favorite of both my girlfriend and I. The flavor was astounding and it was made perfectly. I hesitantly accept that The Stanton Social has made me a huge fan of Beef Wellington, while also acknowledging that I won't be able to find it often and when I do, it'll be expensive.This would definitely be five stars if not for the price. I completely understand that it comes with the territory - a popular Manhattan restaurant run by a celebrity chef. That's why we saved it for a special occasion. I know the dishes are meant to be shareable, but they're expensive for the portion sizes. I will know that I've made it in life when I can charge $16 for two meatballs. Despite that, great experience, a great birthday dinner, and a restaurant that I'll recommend to everyone.",1,1,

Waited 40 minutes for one drink and then another 40 minutes for our order to be taken and then another 40 minutes for the food to START to come out. By the way the drink was a mimosa nothing complicated. Came for a late lunch (2:00PM) so the major lunch time rush was over and there were plenty of empty tables so the slow and poor service was not even justified. Our waiter never even came over to check on our table to see if we needed anything else. Our entire brunch took almost three hours because of how slow and inattentive and the servers were. Was only able to order two drinks in three hours because it took about 40 minutes for my order to be taken and the drinks to come out. Then, they had the nerve to tell us that they were starting to set up for their dinner service so we'd have to give up our table shortly. RIDICULOUS.

I came here for my mom's birthday with the fam and we all participated in the $42 3-Course Dinner Restaurant Week menu. To start off, we ordered the Crispy Hard Shell Fish Tacos and my brother opted for the Crispy Barrio Style Chicken Taquitos. I didn't try it (it's one taquito sliced into 4 pieces) but the tacos were out of this world. Super crispy indeed and so delicious! Definitely recommend.For the main course I had the 'Chicken and Waffles'. The presentation was beautiful, definitely not what you'd expect but still so yummy. The chicken was juicy and the waffles complimented them well. I wasn't a big fan of the blue cheese on the bottom but it didn't ruin the dish whatsoever. My parents ordered the Sesame Spiced Salmon which had me wishing I had ordered it myself -- unbelievably tasty! Only thing I'd say about that is don't expect for it to be filling, as the side is some sort of veggie noodle type of thing that was no more than a spoonful. Finally, for dessert I had ""Les Doughnuts"" which were so soft, warm and went perfectly with the 3 dipping sauces. My parents got the Guinness Toffee Cake which tasted like a super chocolatey brownie (aka divine). The restaurant was beautiful, they offer coat check and the music choice at the time didn't seem too fitting (R&B/Hip Hop) but best believe I had no complaints! Our waitress was so sweet, sadly I don't remember her name but I thank her for such great service.

I highly recommend making a reservation and sit at a booth to enjoy people watching, there are beautiful patrons. The ""dress blues"" is a delicious cocktail that is heavy on blueberry jam.

You would figure that $40 would be nothing for this place however, it certainly looks like they needed the $40. Will never go back to this place again.",,,
65,Tiffany O.,"Newark, NJ",309,503,1365,4.0,1/31/2017,"Just be forewarned that even if you make a reservation, you will wait. I should've seen this earlier through the reviews. I was pretty hangry, but putting aside my bitterness this place has delicious food. So I'll give it the rating it deserves. So two must do's: 1) Make a reservation, and 2) Make the reservation for a time thirty minutes before you actually want to eat. Then grab a drink upstairs at the bar and chill in the dim and loud ambiance.Atmosphere: Restaurant Week, Winter 2017. My birthday always falls during these weeks so I use it as an excuse to treat myself to a nice but still relatively affordable meal. Made reservations for a Monday night at 7:30. Get there on time, am told they're backed up and it'll be 15 minutes. Go upstairs to hang out in the bar, come back down 15 minutes later. Still waiting...and waiting. I made an agreement with my boyfriend that if they don't seat us within 45 minutes of our scheduled reservation, we're dipping and indulging in pancakes at Clinton Street. 43 minutes later...we have our booth. You almost lost us, Stanton Social (Clinton street, I'm coming back for you soon). The place is dim, packed, loud and tiny. But the lighting and the decor is awesome. Food: Here's where this place makes up for my hangriness. It's all tapas style sharing. Our restaurant week choices were as follows: Potato and goat cheese pierogis: probably my favorite food out of all the ones I ate that night. The goat cheese was light and creamy, the creme sauce was an added delight, and the damn caramelized onions provided a sweet overlay on top of the pierogis. Just really, freaking, delicious. Fish tacos: three mini hard shell tacos, filled to the brim with fish and other fixings. Had a delightful citrusy and mango-ish kick to it. Chicken and waffles: That balsamic spiked maple syrup though ugh, it needed to be drizzled all over that is. I also wish the chicken could be a little crispier and fried, but the waffles were yummy and soft in the inside and crisp on the outside.Torchio Bolognese: pasta is pretty dense and heavy. If you like lamb, you'll love this. A little too lamby for my taste though. But that ricotta salata and mint was a delicious touch to the dish.Warm doughnuts: the donuts are standard and fluffy/warm sugar doughnuts. What makes up for it are the three sauces that complement the dish: chocolate, caramel, raspberry. The raspberry by far was my favorite, as it was rich in flavor and tart. The chocolate was really dense and strong in cocoa and the caramel was standard but albeit delicious. Guinness toffee cake: my word, I had a moment the first time i bit into this. The cake in itself is so moist, has a crunch around the edges, and was perfectly complemented by the cold ice cream. Bits of toffee explode your taste buds and the Guinness sauce on the side is addicting. It was so good I didn't even realize I spilled some on my shirt. I'm an embarrassment. They also gave us complimentary falafel crostinis which were tiny and tasted like fresh hummus on a cracker. And they also gave us a decently sized portion of salmon ceviche (on four Asian noodle soup spoons). The salmon ceviche was filled with fresh salmon and a lot of ginger. It was dope. Payed about 54 per person in total. A decent price for the amount of yummy and creative food provided. Restaurant week gives me life! In any other event I think each dish ranges from $17-30 so we def saved some cashé.Service: despite the long wait, the service is friendly, quick, and accommodating. I like it here, just fix your time management, please!",5,2,2
66,Aunnie T.,"Morgan Hill, CA",156,175,500,1.0,7/30/2017,"We came here for a bachelorette with 12 people 7/28/17. We had reservations at 9pm and we had to wait for an hour to be seated! Reservations...please define what that means? The one star was for the food which was yum, but  took some time to come out. We had a prefixed 10 course meal. The service was tremendously atrocious. It was very disappointing to experience since we have heard so much about this place and all the yelp reviews we have read. The biggest upset was when the check came and they handed the check to the Bachelorette!!! WTF! When looking at the check, they charged extra for champagne that was not ordered. Because it was a bachelorette party, it almost seemed like they probably thought we would not notice. Upon speaking with the manager, she was not at all helpful and was not understanding with no customer service. Of course, not wanting to ruin the Bachelorette's night, we end up paying and move on. We thought this would be an experience for the Bachelorette dining at a well known restaurant. We also thought that when we have a large group eating with a special occasion being celebrated, we would've been taken care of considering the amount of money and gratuities we were paying for. Worst restaurant experience we have ever experienced in New York... especially for the first timers visiting from California!",6,1,2
67,Christopher S.,"New York, NY",13,127,72,5.0,5/7/2017,"One of my favorite places in Manhattan. The scene is electric, the food is extremely innovative/delicious and you never know who you'll be sitting beside. There are a lot of must-try's at this restaurant. The potato & goat cheese pierogies and french onion soup dumplings surely lead the way. Additionally, the kobe beef burger sliders, wild mushroom ravioli, and hard shell tofu tacos are amazing. Be sure to try to the cocktails as well - plenty of great options. Keep in mind that even with reservations (which are hard to come by themselves), you'll likely have to wait once you arrive. Thankfully, there is bar upstairs that you can grab a drink at (and even eat) while you wait. Keep in mind that it is a younger crowd and if you're not up for loud music and large crowds, this may not be your place. Definitely recommend though for those looking for a scene and good food.",,,
68,Vaibhav S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",612,224,58,4.0,9/2/2017,"Small plates and brunch doesn't seem like an amicable combo, but Stanton Social definitely lives up to the expectation. We went for bottomless brunch and loved the number of unique mimosa-esque options that were available to be chosen. It sucks that they don't refill your cup whenever your empty and instead have to flag down the waiter every time you need a new glass. The coffee was my favorite of the bottomless cocktails. The food was great. Unfortunately the French Onion Soup Dumplings weren't vegetarian because I think I saw that in every single review of this place. We settled for the Oreo pancakes which were amazing. We went with 4 people and having 5 pancakes was not ideal but we made it work. Definitely get the pancakes when you are here along with the dumplings if you aren't vegetarian.We also got the cinnamon sticks and the goat cheese pierogies. The pierogies were also absolutely great. A bit hot at first but once it cools down, they are amazing. Finally, to at least fill ourselves up, we ordered the Smoked Tomato Pizzeta and the two meat-eaters in our group ordered another pizzeta. The pizzeta is perfect to split with one other person and gets you full. Ordering at tapas places is hard and with 4 people, 3 small plates and two pizzetas seemed to be enough food. There is still a lot left to explore on the brunch menu, but being a little pricey, I don't know how many times I will be back. I enjoyed everything I ate, but wished that the drinks were filled up a little faster over the course of my meal.",1,,1
69,Sunny T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",335,128,27,4.0,3/15/2017,"The Stanton Social is definitely a place to dine if you feeling bougie. The atmosphere makes you feel fancayyy and luxurious, but the food can be a miss at times. Came here with my parents and we ordered a few dishes ranging from their most popular options, to some items we thought sounded 'exciting' and 'new': The Charred Octopus Salad, Thai Style Salmon Ceviche, Rhode Island Lobster Roll, Charred Kobe Beef Burger, 'Beef and Broccoli,' and the much-raved French Onion Soup Dumplings. While this may sound like an insane amount of food, each dish is fairly small since they're tapas and meant to be shared. All the dishes were well executed, however, majority didn't have me raving. The Thai Style Salmon Ceviche was really unique with the slight sweetness from the coconut milk, and refreshing kick from the lemongrass. I'd recommend this dish if you're looking for something different than your typical spicy-salmon-on-top-of-fried-rice-balls option. The stand out were the French Onion Soup Dumplings. These babies are no hype--literally an explosion of comforting soup encased around a thin wrapper, served with a charred crouton on the toothpick and smothered in glorious melted cheese. Truly heaven. But the most memorable of all the dishes was the dessert. Specifically the Warm Doughnuts. These aren't just your run-of-the-mill Dunkin Donuts. They're perfectly fried and crispy on the outside, but incredibly fluffy on the inside. And I kid you not when I say you can eat like 5 of these and not feel weighed down--the lightest of all doughnuts I've ever eaten. They come served with 3 dipping sauces: caramel, chocolate, and berry. Divine. Would I come here again just for the doughnuts? You bet. So I'll be back, not just to satisfy my sweet tooth but to also try their several other tapas options. But perhaps only for a special occasion or when my parents are in town (so I don't gotta pay, know what I'm sayin'?).",1,,

75,Gary R.,"San Diego, CA",825,720,1894,1.0,12/26/2016,"It's been awhile since I've been so utterly aghast and disappointed in a dining experience. I've had Stanton Social bookmarked for a couple of years, and I was thrilled that I was finally going to get to experience it with friends. Unfortunately, nearly $200 later, we all left there unimpressed and hungry. First of all, the restaurant itself is beautiful. It's dark and chic, and has the perfect playful ambiance for an evening out. It has three levels to the space, with a 2nd bar on the 3rd level. Stunning layout.When we first arrived I had to use the restroom, so I began to approach an employee. Seemingly knowing what I was going to ask him, he pointed upwards as if to signify that the restroom was upstairs on one of the other levels. So, I made my way upstairs and still could not locate the restroom on my own. I then approached one of the employees near the upper bar area and asked for assistance in finding the restroom. Without saying a word, he pointed towards a corner of the room. I guess Stanton Social employees are too good to be bothered with basic customer service interactions.To start, we ordered the following:Hand Pulled Chicken Arepas ($15) - These were tasty, but the portion size was outrageously unacceptable! The total circumference of each ""arepa"" was less than the size of a half dollar piece. Moreover, these were NOT traditional arepas; rather, they were more like a deconstructed version. Basically, each one of these cylindrical bites cost $5. Pastrami Reuben Quesadilla ($16) - Again, these had great flavor, but the portion was shameful. French Onion Soup Dumplings ($17) - These were very good. Served piping hot, as soon as you bite into them you get an explosion of French onion soup in your mouth. Albeit very tasty, they are still woefully overpriced.Our friends ordered the Veggie Burger which had to be sent back because the flavor was offensive to everyone at the table. They also ordered the Lobster Roll and Goat Cheese Pierogies ($14). Again, portions were small.I realize Stanton Social is tapas style, but when your table orders 6-7 plates, drops $200, and everyone leaves starving something is dreadfully wrong.",8,4,4
76,Sarah T.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,192,387,5.0,8/18/2017,"About last night... It was the last night I could enjoy Restaurant Week. I was scouring the restaurant week website, looked through menus, and not just looked through the menu for restaurant week, but on my phone, checked out the yelp reviews for the place. I aint going anywhere that my yelpers don't approve of. Hell no.  Settled on The Stanton Social  (duh). Ooh.. the place is faaaancy. I was seated right away. Since we wanted to try food that wasn't on the restaurant week menu. we chose that we did 1 of restaurant week menu, and then ordered stuff off the regular menu.What we had: - Cobb Salad Bites: A little bit of yumminess that had bleu cheese, bacon, avocado.. ahhh.- Tuna Tartare tacos - Loved them! The fish was really fresh, and this was one of my favorite dishes. I want one NOW.- Chicken and waffles. Sounds so simple that I didn't want to order it. Although after reading reviews, I tried it. Best chicken and waffles ever. This is not like drumsticks and those typical waffles. This is chicken breast, on top of a delicious corn spread, on top of waffle yumminess. It was so balanced. A bigger portion than the other foods, ooh, I want one of that too like right now. - Beef wellington - The outside was perfectly crispy pastry dough, and the mushrooms inside were so good with the perfectly tender meat, cooked medium rare.- French Onion Soup Dumplings. Again, Dumplings are my thang, but never have I had dumplings like these. They come in a little bowl with 6 holes in them. I'd think it was made for deviled eggs or something. With dumplings filled with onions cooked for hours. They can be really hot, so be careful. This is something special. A must order!- Doughnuts with dipping sauce for dessert. So good. If I wasn't so full, I'd just dip my fingers in the sauce and finish it even when I was done with the donuts. The donuts were soft and delicious. Oh, and of course, Drinks. I had the Lost in Polanco - a spicy choice. It is Jalapeño-infused Maestro Dobel, blood orange juice, fresh lime, Cointreau and Smoke Signal, which is also spicy and acidic. So good. Ok. I gotta go back there.",1,,

Despite reservations, we still had to wait a bit - but they have a texting system, so we just wanted to a bar around the corner, so not a major issue.  We were promptly seated once getting the table-ready text, and here's the run down:Apps:Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies - Boom. I may be obsessed with goat cheese, but even if you aren't...these are goddamn tasty. Not ordering these when here is a sin. 4 pieces...you should probably get at least 2-3 orders. MinimumCobb Salad Bites - pretty substantial for a salad dish, pretty good!Crispy Hard Shell Fish Tacos - lovely, the creamy avocado and spicy mango salsa really made this app special. Mains:Chicken n Waffles - really really delicious take on the dish with corn pudding and balsamic maple syrup. This was my pick...and I'd do it again 1000 times.Torchio Bolognese - I tried some of a friends - delightful, deep flavor, just yum.Desserts:Warm Doughnuts - Like the pierogies, these win the round.  Chocolate, caramel, and berry dipping sauces...which are great, but the doughnuts could be happily consumed with a side of bark.Guinness Toffee Cake - quite nice, particularly with the Bailey's ice cream!Orea cake pops - your standard cake pop, which is not necessarily a bad thing (they are generally quite good), but nothing too out of the ordinary.Drink - The Hunt.

Ambiance, food, drinks and service all get 5 stars, but knocking off one because every time I have gone the check-in process is a zoo. The entrance is always packed, and each time I'm told it will be a wait of about 30 minutes past my reservation time and that I should go upstairs and have a drink at the bar. But is always a treat to come here. This past time my best friend and boyfriend were in town from Boston and we wanted to show them a solid NYC night out.  We had some great cocktails, my favorite being the Notorious FIG with bourbon, fig, pear- cinnamon syrup and fresh lemon. We were 4 people, and we were more than full with 7 plates + dessert. The waitress recommended 8-12 for a group of our size, but being veterans we knew that was a bit much.The standout was the potato & goat cheese pierogis - they were to die for! And I don't even really love goat cheese! The French onion soup dumplings are what they are known for, and they were superb.Another interesting standout was the Korean tacos - so good!! We also had the smoked tomato pizzeria (great), meatballs (good) and the taqutos (nothing special).

I'm a huge french onion soup fan and these did not disappoint. The ratio of cheese, croutons, onion, and broth was perfect. I have been dreaming of them since. That was the best dish by far. Other than that, the dishes weren't anything incredible. The tuna tartare tacos were pretty good but I've had better tuna tartare. The popcorn shrimp was fun but again, not the best I've had. Lost a star for the cramped atmosphere. We got lucky with our own booth, but it seems, in general, the seating is pretty cramped. I guess such is typical for the LES, but I'd still be wary if coming here for a formal date night or special occasion.

The crispy hard shell fish tacos were very standard; you could get these anywhere. Same goes for the shrimp tempura sticks that came with three dipping sauces- very standard nothing outstanding.

Let's start with the positives! Great location in the heart of LES. Every dish we ordered was super unique, a creative take that you'll likely never get to try elsewhere something similar, and each one was mastered. French onion soup in a dumpling! Yes it's possible and they freakin nailed it! Ceviche in wonton spoon. I hate ceviche but date wanted to try it. Guess what. Nailed it! The flavors were very complex with different spices and it was a real treat to eat slowly and savor the various flavors in the ceviche. Tuna tacos were good but nothing crazy honestly. Chicken and waffles were another unique choice you can only get here. Also done very well. Truly enjoyed almost all their dishes.As far as service, Waiter was super accommodating and helpful. We had a 10pm reso on a Friday and we had to wait 15 min at the upstairs bar. I'm easy going, but I've read other reviews and that seems to be an ongoing issue, the seating staff needs to get their ishhh together. Now for the negative! One word: desert. We ordered Oreo pops, milk shake shot, and doughnuts. I don't even want to delve too far into it, because it was such a disappointment to a perfect dinner. But Oreo pops tasted like they were premade, refrigerated, and dropped on your plate for $16 for 3. Literally can't believe they serve these here. Doughnuts were just pieces of friend dough. Some chocolate and caramel dipping sauce. Common guys! Where's the flavor and creativity! This is not Stanton social. Milk shake shots were a weird combo of whisky and milk shake - they didn't work.

91,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,3.0,10/29/2016,"3.5 stars. Maybe my expectations were too high for Stanton Social. The number of reviews, the incessant hype, the seemingly creative menu...I thought we were in for a treat. As it turns out--and this is the moral of many, many stories--looking pretty on the outside is not enough. If execution falls flat, the buildup all seems pretty silly. All in all, Stanton Social is a fun venue with tons of energy with solid cocktails but overpriced, underwhelming food. Reminded me of Beauty & Essex (in vibe, presentation) but significantly inferior. Came here at 8:15pm on a Friday night. As expected, the place was loud and bustling. The decor here is gorgeous--glamorous and creative, beautiful lighting fixtures, sleek design overall. This is definitely a good spot (in theory) for a girl's night out or a big group dinner. Would definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand, especially if you're a large party. This place is busy 24/7.Stanton Social boasts a pretty intriguing cocktail menu--I actually found the drink execution to be much better, as a whole, than that of the food. To kick off the night, I opted for the Sage Advice (Botanist gin, mango, shredded sage, lemon), which I'd definitely recommend as a starter drink. Though it's listed under the ""Savory"" heading, it's actually quite sweet. Heavy on the mango, but I have zero issues with that. Huge mango fan and don't see it enough in mixed drinks. Be careful though--though you can't really taste the gin here, I assure you, it exists. My second drink won the night though (both in taste and in name)--the Notorious F.I.G. (Bulleit bourbon, fig, pear-cinnamon syrup, fresh lemon). Now here's something that's worth the hype. My bf typically doesn't like whiskey and even he agreed that this drink was a winner. Cobb Salad Bites: shaved brussels sprouts, bacon, blue cheese, quail egg, avocado (B+/A-)These were *almost* fantastic. Something was just a smidge off with the flavor and I still can't really place it. Still, these were fun, inventive and a great first dish of the night. The creamy avocado on the inside held all of the other goodness together and not surprisingly, paired wonderfully with the bacon. That combo isn't really a stretch, though (the ingredients of a Cobb Salad aren't exactly a secret). I'm not a huge blue cheese fan, so that might've been the issue for me. Overall, these were Willy Wonka-esque and definitely woke the palette up. Nori-Spiced Tuna Poke Wonton: cilantro, avocado, crushed wasabi peas (A-)One of our better dishes of the night, and very reminiscent of my meal and Beauty & Essex a number of months ago. Three wontons (WHY MUST THESE PLACES ALL SERVE THEIR APPS IN TRIOS?? The Cobb Salad Bites also came as a group of three.) topped with bountiful avocado (think your dish needs more but coming to a standstill on how to make it better? Put an avo on it!) and those yummy wasabi peas. The poke craze has made it to New York and we're all going crazy for it. You're dining as a duo, someone's gotta take the high road and concede the third wonton. French Onion Soup Dumplings: B-These are apparently the ""signature"" at Stanton Social. I've never been a fan of French onion soup, but our waiter raved and raved about these babies so we gave into the pressure. We needed one more dish. Unfortunately, these were collectively the least favorite dish of the night. It's entirely possible that this just isn't a food that I like. Simple as that. It's perturbing to me given my love for just about every food out there, but ya can't have it all, I guess. Just can't get behind these. Maryland Crab Cake Corndog: AWe seemed to be confronting a visual theme of general brown-ness across presentations. These were cute/creative/actually really tasty, but at this point we were tiring of breaded-this and battered-that. Just a small gripe. The flavors were fantastic, though. I will never tire of crab cakes/literally any dish featuring crab, and these didn't disappoint. Again, we were only served three! At least these are a bit easier to split (relatively). House-Brined ""Pastrami Reuben"" Quesadilla: swiss cheese, sauerkraut, mustard aioli (A-)Pastrami reubens carry a lot of nostalgia for me. Cold cuts with the Jewish fam every Sunday was a big tradition in my house growing up. Though I enjoyed the flavor profile of the dish (pretty hard not to if you like reubens), these felt a bit too dainty for me. Reubens are supposed to be falling apart at the seams with pastrami and these were a bit too weak for my taste. But when you're looking for this type of style (light, easily shareable), these are a great take on the reuben that don't require as much commitment as a Katz's sandwich does. Our total for the night was something like $140. Considering the quantity and the qualify of the food we received, that's simply too much. I get that a person comes here for the experience more than anything, but I was still disappointed. At least the service was great?",4,1,1
92,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",119,301,527,3.0,2/11/2018,"My husband and I came here for dinner and it was a nice experience but there were only a couple of standout dishes-tuna tacos*: amazing, wish we ordered 2 orders. The tuna was so fresh and the flavors were great-fish tacos: the fish was too ground up. I was picturing a chunk of fish rather than it being puréed. I wouldn't get this again.-beef and broccoli: cool concept but the beef was way too salty. We weren't able to eat the whole dish-French onion soup dumplings*: these were great. They're a little hot at first but the caramelized onions and cheese are a perfect combo.Beef Wellington: it is definitely a hard dish to make and the beef was cooked well but the dough was still a little raw on the inside. Also the sauce and mushrooms were very salty-crab cake slider: nothing special about it, bacon tasted like it was caramelized and didn't go well with the dish -birthday shot: cool concept, don't think I would get it again-doughnuts: amazingWe also really enjoyed the drinks (strawberry fields, mulled wine, old fashioned) although a little pricey",,,

95,Grace L.,"Boston, MA",614,396,520,4.0,2/4/2017,"I was mentally writing my 1-star review while waiting for our table, as I'd made a reservation for my birthday dinner but had to wait an hour. Upon checking in five minutes early, the hostess informed us that they were running 15 minutes late and they would text me when our table was ready - we went upstairs to the bar to wait. 45 minutes later, no text, and came downstairs to investigate - pretty sure the hostess simply forgot but she didn't even apologize. Instead she said that they were getting our table ready (at this point it was 9:30 PM on a Monday, and tables were emptying anyway). I was FUMING and hungry. They must've noticed because two dishes came on the house, which was a nice gesture. The first dish was unremarkable, but the second was a crispy shell fish taco-type dish that had some delicious raw fish. My partner and I ordered the restaurant week menu, plus the french onion soup dumplings, and all combined it was a TON of food. We left perfectly satisfied, somewhat forgetting the beginning of our evening, as a result of our great waitress, good seats (we got to sit in a circular booth for just the two of us), and decent food. Not a huge fan of the french onion soup dumplings or ravioli, but my partner seemed to enjoy his food. I loved the Oreo cake pops and the birthday cupcake though! But overall, the main reason this review ended up being 4 stars is the great waitress we had - thanks for making an otherwise almost-mediocre birthday dinner special!",,,

99,Amit J.,"Jersey City, NJ",1601,197,543,3.0,4/22/2017,"Visited Stanton Social during a Saturday night in the Lower East Side, our first on a night out bar hopping. Heard great things about the bar, so decided to visit. - Music: My favorite aspect about Stanton Social was their music. Track after track was great and well-mixed with hip-hop, 90s hits and more. This is the main reason I'd want to come back here!- Drinks: The drinks were good here, I mostly had the Moscow Mule (~$16) which was delicious and my friends had other mixed drinks that they said were good as well. - Atmosphere: The bar/ lounge area was much smaller than I expected, and with the table section blocked off for a party the place was tiny! Still had a nice laid back vibe to it where you can still have conversations with friends and the music isn't too overbearing or loud. Overall, had a fun time and glad that this was our first stop. It's fairly relaxed, small and has great music! I'd come back here if I was in the area but wouldn't go out of my way for it.",6,1,4

The vibe is very relaxed and social, which lives up to its name. We got their famous French Onion Soup Dumplings -- a classic, with a cheesy twist. It was a bit salty but I would get it again as it went well as a side with our booze. I rarely come back to any establishment twice, but this place is just so convenient and great for any occasion. It's really reasonably priced in the Lower East Side compared to its other competitors (brunch-wise) and that is enough of a reason to bring back a friend.The service was great! Awesome place.",,,

103,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",914,269,1028,3.0,10/19/2016,"Came here for a social brunch with bottle service - advertised as 7 courses but more like 7 small bites (think hors d'ouevres size). Highlights were definitely the latkes (yummy, although not really latkes - the Gentile next to me made some sort of comment about them being ""really good latkes"" and I almost strangled her), the tiny reuben panini things, and the doughnuts. Courses I could have skipped were the egg ""taco"" things (basically hard-to-eat breakfast burritos) and the flatbread (fine, but nothing special). The food was pretty decent, but the service was SO slow and unexceptional. We were there for a full three hours. Now, I've had 2.5-3 hour meals before at some restaurants, but for some reason because of how small the portion sizes were at The Stanton Social, we finished our bites in about 10 seconds and then had a LOT of sitting around time waiting. Didn't really like the vibe for brunch. There was a DJ upstairs playing pretty loud music, which was kinda bizarre to have in the background while a table of girls sat and chatted. I DID like the whole ""social"" concept, though, in that I liked the tiny, shareable bites with ample drinks and kinda a communal-casual feel to the tables. I just think The Stanton Social can't figure out if it wants to be a unique tapas joint, a club, or an upscale brunch place.The food was good, but I won't return.",2,1,1

It was crazy good. If you go on a Saturday be prepared to feel like you're in a club with loud music blasting, waits for your reservation and feeling of exclusivity....but go on a cold Sunday night and it will be much less noisy and busy.

So I got totally screwed - how am I supposed to find a place that has more reasonable pricing for such a large group a few hours before the dinner in NYC? BOOM. In comes Stanton Social with the save.]Customer Service: The event planning team is so friendly, so helpful, and just great to work with. They waived my cake slicing fee amongst other things b/c everything was so last minute no thanks to the restaurant that cancelled on me.Food: Solid 4 stars. Some dishes were better than others. We had a set menu that I selected beforehand since our party was so large; they accommodate vegetarian options and other dietary restrictions and will sub out plates even if everyone else in the party opted for a different dish on the pre-fixed menu! The kobe beef sliders were amazing. I loved the pierogi as well. Salmon was also great!Drinks: I'd give it a 4.5 if I could. The cocktails are delicious and they have a wide variety.Ambience: Of course, as you'd expect, it's very trendy, more upscale (not stuffy).

I am the type of person who doesn't like to share and I will eat a huge over portioned meal when I go out. For restaraunt week when you can go to a restaraunt with bigger portions that is a better option so you get your moneys worth. The place is pretty crammed, I always bumped into a waiter or the side of a table in the main room. Its also noisy in the main area, the lounge was more quiet and looks like a nice place to have a date. Our waiter was okay, nice. The appetizers weren't anything special. I liked the fish tacos better then my friend 's chicken taquitos. For the main course we both had the chicken waffles which was really good. The chicken wasn't too greasy/fried and was really juicy and the combination of the blue corn waffle really made it. The dish had a little spice which I liked. Definitely never had a spin on chicken and waffles like this. And that is what you expect at a tapas place like this, small plates with a spin on the conventional. The dessert was good too, I liked my almond spice cake a lot. The cinnamon ice cream was alittle icey but still really good.",,,

Came here with 5 other people, had a 7:30 reservation and coming from Jersey we got stuck in traffic for over an hour. Called the restaurant explained to them our situation and was informed to just get there when we could. Finally arrived at 8:30 and the hostess was nothing but amazing. Not only were they super understanding about the traffic but they also sat us within five minutes. Once we were seated that's when the fun began. The food here is hands down some of the best I've had. I'm a huge fan of tapas style food because I like to try a little bit of everything so coming here was perfect for me and my group. We ordered the chicken and waffles, French onion soup dumplings, beef and broccoli, social mac n' cheese, and the chicken taquitos. I can't say out of all that food one thing was bad. One thing was better than the next. My personal favorite was the mac n' cheese and the chicken and waffles. I probably talked about this place for a solid month after my dining experience here. The place gets crowded so I would highly suggest a reservation. Also, I have to say the music they play while you are dining is fantastic.",5,3,4
109,Nicole P.,"San Francisco, CA",2,12,4,2.0,9/16/2018,"This place used to be something but if the quality of the brunch today reflects a permanent change, that explains to me why the place was half empty today. Dishes that had previously been amazing (croque monsieur, onion dumplings) underwhelmed significantly. Waiter was less that interested in us, he stood chatting in the corner with fellow colleagues. This used to be a ""must visit"" for any trip to NYC. Frankly, it's a definite skip now. Time to find another place.",,,

Food was off the charts and the decor is nice. Beef Wellington was phenomenal and the appetizers, you could make a meal on themselves, we ordered more of thefrench onion dumplings cheesesteak to come out with our dinner because of how goof they were. Doesn't have the greatest curb appeal but you'll get over that quickly once you get inside.

112,Majel C.,"Berkeley, CA",43,38,1,4.0,12/14/2017,"Four stars rather than five:- You know the feeling when you walk into a restaurant and it feels like that restaurant and its staff take themselves very seriously? Stanton Social positions itself as a fancy dining establishment, but that posture felt a little fake/contrived.- You really and truly cannot get a healthy dish in this place. I have to eat out a lot when I'm in NYC, so I try to eat pretty clean -- soups, salads -- to avoid the inevitable ongoing feeling of Oh-my-god-I-can't-believe-I'm-still-full-from-last-night's-meal. At SS, I ordered anything that sounded vaguely like a plate of healthy veggies. What I actually got was either deep-fried, or packed inside of little donutty pastries, or covered in cheese. If you are trying to not overeat, go somewhere else.- Holy heck does it get loud. We arrived on the early side, right when they opened. By the time we left, the place was completely packed and we were shouting at each other to be heard. If you need to have an intimate conversation, go early and leave early. If you don't care, then go have fun.Those are the drawbacks. On the positive side, man is the food good. Everything we ordered was better than expected. It was absolutely delicious, and my two companions agreed. There were a lot of the take a bite and then eyes widen kind of moments happening at our table.",,2,

The service here is impeccable and the drinks are superb. When anyone left their seat to use the restroom, they came back to a folded napkin.

114,Sky K.,"San Francisco, CA",217,2,0,1.0,3/1/2018,"Great food, cool atmosphere, but boy do they have no idea how to treat their customers. This is obviously a super popular place because it was extremely busy when we went on a Saturday night recently. I went there  with five friends (six of us total). We had made a reservation for 9 PM a few weeks in advance. We got there at 8 PM and went upstairs for some drinks. 9 PM rolls around and we hear nothing from the hostess. After 10-15 minutes we went downstairs and they didn't really tell us anything, just that they would text us when the table was ready. Fast-forward to 9:45 PM and we are still upstairs and we still haven't heard anything from the hostess. We were finally seated around 10 PM an hour after our reservation.This normally wouldn't bother me too much as long as the hostess/server were gracious and apologetic but they were not apologetic whatsoever. They gave us each a shot glass full of carrot soup on the house but it was brought out by a bus boy and there was no acknowledgement of the fact that they had kept us waiting for an hour. I could be wrong but I think making a guest wait for an hour deserves a bottle of champagne. If they had done something like that I would never be writing this.There were also some other issue. After all of that the table that they sat us at was at the very front of the restaurant. The restaurant was packed so it felt like there was a crowd standing around us for most of the meal. It was also so near the door that it was constantly cold as people went in and out (this was in February so it was in the 30s outside).Between the six of us we ended up spending $250 on drinks upstairs and another $550 on the meal. With that kind of cost I expect more.",,,

116,Lauren A.,"Minneapolis, MN",134,73,111,4.0,2/3/2018,"To tell you the truth I was really looking forward to this place, but I think we approached it all wrong.We made reservations and were going to miss their popular ""Socialite Brunch"" which I think would have been the way to go. But we really wanted to try this place so we got a cozy booth and asked our waiter for his opinions on what we order. He told us we could split 3 or 4 things between the two of us and that would be enough. So we ordered three things to split between us (we each got a slider, the croquet monsieur and the French onion soup bites). We also both got drinks, I order the mimosa and my friend got a coffee drink.Her coffee drink was incredible and I would highly recommend, but I didn't care for my mimosa (gasp...I know...right?). The little ham and cheese sandwiches and my burger slider were also phenomenal, but I wasn't a fan of the French onion soup - but that is just a preference. Because our food took so long to come out they also brought us some small potato pancakes which were perfect and crispy.Overall I thought this place was cute, but nothing to rave about for lunch. Like I mentioned I think we did it wrong by not going to the Socialite Brunch, but maybe that will just be an excuse to go again in the future!",,,

We ordered a few things to share and everything was really good, but didn't blow me away. This kind of place would be difficult with a really large group, but it is perfect for 2 people who like to share different things for dinner. The lobster roll sliders and the tuna wonton tacos were my favorite. Also, the doughnuts with the 3 dipping sauces for dessert were AMAZING, I'd highly recommend those.

It was relatively empty with only a few customers. My friend ordered the Mac & Cheese and I ordered French onion soup dumplings. We also ordered 2 Vietnamese coffee at the same time. For the slow time in the restaurant, we waited quite for a long time.For the food, I would give five stars. I tasted my friend's mac & cheese and it was one of the best I have ever had. The crunchy texture on the top goes well with the creamy mac & cheese in the middle. It was rich and smooth. My French onion soup dumplings took longer time to be served, but they were fantastic. Soft onion soup texture was covered in crispy dumplings with cheese on the top.For the service, I would give one star. The drinks that we ordered did not come out for a long time and when we asked about the status, it turned out the server forgot to get them ready. He came back with only one drink when we clearly specified that we ordered two. He probably suffers from short term memory loss. He went back to the bar one more time to bring another one. It was not even busy in the restaurant. He also constantly talked to one particular customer at the corner. It looked like they knew each other or he felt the need to pay special attention to that customer, while the service at my table was suffering. He could have been more attentive.",,,

Bads: too noisy, almost impossible to make conversations, mediocre service.Good*1: Basically if you read Yelp carefully and step-by-step follow suggestions, you would not end up with wrong dishes. French onion soup dumpling, red snapper taco, scallop risotto were musts. Believe they spent lots of time recreating traditional western dishes and adding new elements into it. Good*2: many fruity drinks that were suitable for girls - my friend and I loved our strawberry/grapefruit cocktails.Bad*1: oh my. I think about 90% time when I was trying to communicate, I had to shout really hard to make sure that my friend could hear me. Very unorganized. Bad*2: no one came to us during our dinner and checked on our food and stuff, really felt like we were being left alone.To be honest I don't really care about service, so long as food itself could justify its fame.

128,Chuck P.,"New York, NY",58,64,176,2.0,8/30/2018,"This review is based on tonight's experience (08/30/2018). When you go to a happy hour you expect to pay less than the original price, that's what happy hour mean right? I saw the big sign outside of the restaurant says happy hour from 5-12 and also quote from one of the hosts ""there is a bar area upstairs and we have happy hours all night long."" We went to upstairs and get seated, the tricky thing is the cocktail server did not mention anything about happy hours menu, we just ordered few drinks from the drink menu, in some cases, you order drinks from regular menu and you pay a different price. Or the server should've warned you or bring you a special happy hours menu. I had learned that they only have margaritas on happy hour's list. Seriously? They expecting me to pay full price for the drinks we should've paid for less. If I want to pay full price which was $16 dollars each , the I would go to somewhere else. It's kind of misleading people, no wonder why it was no busy at all. I think the drinks were pretty good, but I wish someone could've warned me about it, and my friend did.

Even the brunch is served like tapas, so I would recommend ordering more dishes. I was content after sharing two, but could definitely go for more food. Out of the two dishes we had, my favorite was the chicken and waffles. They served it with this magical sauce - the perfect combination of savory and sweet. After reading the other reviews, I'm questioning whether or not I should come back for dinner. If you haven't been here before, I'd definitely recommend trying the brunch first!",2,1,1

131,Kathryn T.,"Manhattan, NY",352,411,2622,4.0,4/9/2016,"Let's clarify - I've been waiting to come here since I saw this spot on the Food Network at age 17.Then for my birthday, many years later, here I am.I'm going to say it: the french onion soup dumplings are hype. They are definitely more dumpling that soup which is disappointing and threw off the flavor. All of the other bites range from above average to delicious but you won't be missing out if you pass on the dumplings. The best thing here, hands down, is the goat cheese pierogie. My friend and I could not believe how incredibly flavorful and well done they were. You HAVE to try it.The vibes are really what Stanton Social are known for. It's a trendy place with a good place list. The crowd is younger and it's fun to kick it with your friends in this very New York, LES spot. The service varies depending on the night. But that Notorious FIG - one of the best cocktails that I've had in Manhattan. I recommend stopping in to try it. Also, the birthday cake shots are wonderful. If you're looking for a good date spot (reserve ahead first!), Stanton Social is an option. Probably not a first date though - the wait for a table might be too long for the awkwardness.",8,1,6

Updated review","We came here again. We got the goat cheese pizza vegetarian, fish tacos, salmon mango ceviche (out of this world), the Mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had (we got vegetarian they usually put meat). We also got the French fries (amazing) and salmon which was pretty good. The ravioli was alright nothing crazy. The only negative is it was a Saturday night and took an hour extra with reservation. The place is packed, but it's definitely worth the hype.",,,

We also ordered the French onion soup dumplings, egg bruschetta, and perogies. Everything was pretty buttery and felt fattening...so this isn't a place for you juicers.   Crowd was very basic Manhattan - People being there because they feel like this is the ""it"" spot.",1,,1
134,Lillian Z.,"San Francisco, CA",773,173,56,2.0,4/24/2017,"Food: 3/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Service: 1/5Value: 3/5Note: I really downgraded my rating for this place because of the poor service. Came here for a birthday brunch with a group of 10. I picked this place bc it was one of the few that actually allowed group reservations without a prix fixe, which was much appreciated!! The restaurant is dimly lit and has a super fun going-out-y vibe even for brunch, and it reminded me like a toned down version of Beauty & Essex for those of you familiar with that. Overall the food was decent, but the portions were definitely small.. we had the Mac and cheese, huevos rancheros, fish tacos, fries, Oreo pancakes, cinnamon sticks, french onion soup dumplings, fries, and a few other things. Oreo pancakes and fish tacos were the highlights; everything else was good but nothing special. I was just incredibly disappointed by the service... our waitress was incredibly haughty and un-friendly, and when two dishes came out that we definitely did not order, she just seemed really disgruntled and angry with us when it was obviously not our fault the kitchen sent out wrong dishes. Also, we had some gluten-free members of the party who ordered specific dishes which NEVER CAME OUT! When we pointed this out to our waitress, she wasn't accommodating at all, didn't offer to send out the dish, and seemed to blame us. Also, brunch cocktails were $15, which was just so overpriced. Some of us wanted to do the bottomless 1.5 hours for $25 but that's only allowed if the whole table participates :( our drinks also came out SUPER slowly. I understand that a big party is tough to serve, but I was just really disappointed in the attitude along with the poor service.",,1,
135,Yara F.,"New York, NY",126,259,340,4.0,5/1/2018,"Planned a weeknight work event here a few weeks ago in their semi private upstairs room, which is a wine balcony. Had a good experience working with the planner for the space, I was tasked with planning an event for Wednesday the Monday before, and she was super accommodating and responsive and we figured everything out easily even though it was pretty last minute. The fixed menu for groups is a pretty great deal, and everyone will leave full of delicious food. Some highlights were the ahi tuna taco's, the french onion soup dumplings, and the philly cheesesteaks, but honestly everything we got was delicious, fresh, and largely portioned! The cocktail menu is also great, and they had a nice wine selection, so everyone was happy with the drinks. My one frustration and reason for removing a star was that we had one waitress for a group of 15, and there were multiple times where she seemed unable to handle the amount of stuff going on. Not her fault at all, and there were a few people who helped her serve a couple times, but as we were an active and lively bunch, I felt at least having an assistant waiter assigned to assist her regularly would have been helpful. There were a few times where we had to wait a slightly annoying amount of time for drinks, to order drinks, or for plates to be cleared, and when spending a couple thousand at a restaurant you reserved an event space in I expect more. She was a great waitress and was very nice throughout the meal so I cant blame her. Overall I would certainly return for the fun and delicious food/drink menu!",,,

We ordered the fish tacos , meats balls, lollipop shrimp, French onion soup and a few other choices and everything came out perfectly. They have a specialty strawberry drink that was great as well.

The staff are warm, friendly, very helpful, and they take their time explaining the menu. Let me start by saying, I wasn't impressed with the French onion soup dumplings. I don't find them to be fresh. However, everything else I had was amazing. How about crab cake corn dogs, say what? Yes, they taste as good as they sound. The potato and goat cheese pierogies were ridiculous (and I meant that in the best possible way). We finished the night with the warm donuts which were delicious.

It may seem like not a lot of food  and portions are tiny in the beginning but once we were done eating all through the prefix menu, we were full. Everything was delicious but I didn't care for the french onion dunplings, mac and cheese, and tacquiotos. I did not drink but everyone else ordered one mimosa and said it was weak.

And everything was just ok and some even didn't taste very good. We tried the octopus salad, salmon, ribs, chicken and waffle, fried green beans and everything was just all right. The chicken and waffle was actually event bad..just very dry and bland.. The french onion soup dumplings was probably the best tapas from the night. It was served in this ceramic dish and topped with cheese. Pretty flavorful. Service and the ambiance was great. Overall, definitely a letdown given the how expensive and all the buzz this place gets",,,
141,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",548,270,1485,2.0,3/11/2016,"Glad we tried.....but would not go back. Found it loud, dimly lit, overcrowded and over priced. Too bad because we read a lot of good reviews on Stanton Social (which I am really surprised by) but they certainly did not live up to them for our group.Our reservation was for 7 PM, but when we got there on time, the table wasn't ready. That's not too uncommon so we waited patiently for our table. The hostess directed us to the bar upstairs until our table was ready. The bar upstairs was extremely loud, crowded, and HOT. I was dying - I would have rather waited outside in the rain, but thankfully our table was ready in 30 minutes. We went back downstairs to the main area excited to be seated and away from the crowded bar. The hostess proceeded to take us to the back of the restaurant, up 3 more flights of stairs - where we admire the beautiful décor of the restaurant from above, but to our surprise.... we just ended up back in the bar area. Just why? Disappointed cannot even begin to describe what I was feeling. The atmosphere upstairs was a bit unpleasant for a good dining experience. It was too dark, even to see the menu, and too loud to have a conversation. We literally had to use the light from our iphones in order to read anything off the menu. The server recommended 2 -3 tapas per person and we found the food to be inconsistent. A few of the small plates were great - including the Red Snapper Tacos ($11) and Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies ($10), but the others were less than stellar. Their signature dish of French Onion Soup Dumplings ($14) ended up being cold, heavy and lumpy - we didn't see what was so ""signature"" about this dish was. The Rigatoni Bolognese ($18) was a complete miss as well - it was completely bland and had a strange mint taste to it. Wasn't a fan. Overall, portions were tiny and food was way too expensive for what it's worth. I didn't find the dishes to be good enough for the cost and didn't enjoy being crammed in an extremely loud and dark room.",3,1,1

It makes me always have it in my back pocket as a home run when someone needs a recommendation. I've been coming here probably since 2009, and it's never let me down. Dinner and brunch are both equally delicious. I love the small plate approach that chef Chris Santos started here and brought to Beauty and Essex. He eloquently put together each plate, while small, flavors are big and well thought out. Love the french onion soup dumplings, potato and goat cheese pierogis, mini lamb souvlakis, chicken and waffles, and birthday cake shots among many other things! Yummmmmmmy!",1,,
143,Thomas L.,"Victorville, CA",12,91,130,3.0,8/11/2017,"When I booked this place, I had such high hopes from all the reviews. Sadly, I think the hype far outweighed the reality. To start, we showed up on time for our dinner, only to be told that our table was not ready. When I asked how long it would be, I was told that there is no definite time. To make matters worse, there was a private party at the bar upstairs, and we couldn't even get drinks or food up there. When I asked what we can do about food, as it was already late with several of us hungry, the hostess suggested going somewhere else to grab a bite until she texted me to signal our table being ready. WHAT?We decided to tough it out for 30 minutes for the upstairs bar to clear the private party. 45 minutes later, the security guard let us up, but even though we were the first ones going up the front stairs, the bar was not empty (curious). The music was not just loud--it was oppressive. When I explained our conundrum to the lead waitress, she appeared sympathetic and stated we can order but didn't offer us a table to sit down. In the meantime, the music got LOUDER, much more than in a club, but our orders of appetizers did show up, along with drinks. A while afterwards, the music level went back to the initial level, and our table was ready. We sat in a plush cozy half-circle couch of a table. The music level in the main dining room was more bearable, but still loud. We still had to raise our voices to be heard across the table. The food, while innovative in concept, was often poor in execution. Our waitress also forgot about our drink orders in the middle of the meal for well over 30 minutes. Here is a rundown on the food:Lobster slider: taste ok, found two shells in the roll. We let the lead waitress know.  No response. Goat cheese pierogi: this was a good dish. Very tasty. French onion dumplings: innovative presentation, not special in taste Kobe beef sliders: couldn't taste the quality, came out medium rare Korean tacos: neat concept, spicy and good Chicken arepas: spicy and very good, but the portions were literally bite-sized for each of us fourBeef Wellington: had high expectations and was very disappointed. Ordered medium rare as recommended, came out medium well and tough Social mac and cheese: slightly spicy, good but not special Oreo cake pops: slightly better than StarbucksOverall, there was so much promise, as another friend (not one in this party) was so impressed and said we can now boast of having been here.  Even though the concept was sexy, both in terms of the setup and the food, the actual experience was disappointing for us. In summary, this place is for you if you:-don't mind waiting with a reservation -like the idea of eating in a dance club-don't mind shouting across the table to talk to your friends-enjoy mostly average food in small portions I guess I am too old to be hip and would prefer a more traditional fine dining experience.",1,,1

Honestly, I think this place is best when you go with a few other people. Since they serve a variety of small plates. It gives you a chance to try several different things. ONE OF EVERYTHING PLEASE! Stanton Social doesn't come cheap like other places in LES. This place is popular for their tapas and I guess the trendy atmosphere.

It's a beautiful restaurant that is perfect for a date and if you want awesome oysters for $1, I recommend you hit the bar upstairs for Happy Hour (5-8). Can't wait to come back. Those ribs......ahhh. One funny thing though. Waiter said to NOT order the twinkie for dessert. It's dry and he doesn't even know why it's on the menu. So why is it still there?

151,Julia F.,"Brooklyn, NY",109,186,45,5.0,2/4/2016,"My mind would have never dreamed up to fill a dumpling with French Onion soup and cover it in a crispy shell of Gruyere, but this is one of many reasons why I crush Chris Santos' cuisine so hard. On a bleak and rainy Wednesday evening I sought comfort from the wind and lack of umbrella etiquette in those very dumplings. Waiting at the bar upstairs, I ordered the Hemingway - a gin based drink that tasted like perfume with a refreshing after glow of grapefruit. I seriously would have made out with strangers just to share the experience with them. The table gods were kind and after a few minutes of sipping upstairs we were led to a booth on the lower level with plenty of space to order to our hearts delight, which we OBVIOUSLY did! Dumplings aside, the mac and cheese with spicy sausage was more comfort in a small tureen, as were the charred octopus salad with bits of feta and the crispy chicken taquitos. Another round of Hemingways and intense ""girl talk"" led us to order the final comfort food of the evening, the Warm Doughnuts with three kinds of dipping sauces. I was tipsy and dopamined out of my mind when suddenly a birthday cupcake appeared with a single lit candle. Oh, Chris, you shouldn't have!!! Two bites in and I knew this wasn't a Chris Santos creation; however a girl can dream!!!! That's exactly what my ass did all the way back to Brooklyn.",1,1,
152,Derek M.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",441,175,271,5.0,5/12/2016,"WOW. This meal was amazing. What I really like about this place is the tapas styled meals. I came here on Tuesday night for a business dinner and we ordered around 7 dishes along with a few drinks. While we were searching through the menu for what to order, our waitress brought out some free potato soup samples for us to try out, which was very nice of them and made us even more excited to try out the rest of their dishes. What entrees I recommend based off what we ordered - Wok Charred Edamame (spicy edamame), French Onion Soup Dumplings, Wild Mushroom & Spinach Ravioli, Social Sliders - Philly Cheesesteak (AWESOME). I also had ordered myself an ""Off the Cuff"" cocktail, which contains Hennesey and tastes sweet. Desserts entrees - Warm Doughnuts, Movie Theatre Sundae and Birthday cake milkshake shots. ALL amazing, my personal favorite was the Movie Theatre Sundae, almost ate that whole thing by myself haha. The Birthday Cake Milkshake shots were nice and tasty and made a great dessert for my sister's birthday. Definitely will be returning! Thank you Stanton Social!",,,

155,Jason L.,"Brooklyn, NY",105,226,728,4.0,10/21/2015,"Came here on a sunday with a reservation.  It was probably not needed.  They have an upstairs which is lounge seating and a downstairs which was a little more formal seating.  We ordered many dishes since it was tapas style.  The most memorable were the social mac and cheese, stanton social beef wellington, wasabi pea crusted salmon, and potato and goat cheese pierogies.  The mac and cheese was tasty and flavorful.  Not too overly cheesy.  The beef wellington was great.  The pastry that it is wrapped in went incredible well with the steak inside and just melts in your mouth.  The salmon dish was kind of a surprise.  I expected it to tasty fishy and a little weird with the wasabi but it turned out pretty good.  Didn't really have a strong taste of wasabi and the soba noodle were good.  The pierogies were pretty good and placed on a unique looking dish.  Overall this is a nice tapas restaurant.  The quality of food id good and service was great.  Just a little pricey and maybe a little over hyped.",3,1,2
156,Emily R.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,11,0,4.0,9/28/2017,"The beef and broccoli will blow your mind, thank me later. I've been here twice and never have left disappointed, the food/bites are incredibly delicious and full of flavor and texture. The food is meant to be shared, and it's one of those places where you'll have your bite/small serving and instantly regret not having more to eat. For example, the salmon ceviche in coconut milk - served in large spoons - it's like a little bit of you deflates when your spoon is empty. This ceviche is inventive and nothing like what you'll get at traditional Mexican or Peruvian restaurants, it's all it's own. Get it.The cobb salad bites in little mini bacon bowls, wow, get them. Again, all the flavors are so rich and you just get a few bites and it's rather tortuous. We also ordered the BLT flatbread that comes with lamb bacon and arugula for the lettuce. It was maybe the only menu item we had that was a bit lacking, as to what, I'd say some sort of creamy sauce, like perhaps a twist on a tzaziki sauce would have been a nice a touch. It just needed a little more pizzazz to stand up to the other items. Oh and back to the beef and broccoli - this is absolutely delectable. The beef (braised short rib) is so tender and melt-in-your-mouth quality, the broccoli is pureed and then the rice is shaped into little chewy discs as the conduit. Okay and lastly, the pierogis are so rich, like you feel as though the center is a thick buttery cheese filling, which it essentially is.For drinks - I'm sorry I don't have much to tell you, have only had glasses of wine that are suitable and fine. I'd say get a cocktail which I'm sure are better than the glasses of wine because they will be crafted in a similar manner to the unique menu items.One thing I can't figure out is, why on a Friday night at 10 you can just walk-in and get seated but the majority of the other restaurants in busy LES have long waits. That's a mystery to me, after my second time going I'm surprised. Perhaps it's the shareable menu and the items are tapa-sized? Lots of different cuisines packed into an inventive menu, can't go wrong, I think you should go. Shoutout to whoever makes the playlists too, love the mix of tunes, even heard Despacito.",,,

160,Rima P.,"Montclair, NJ",0,5,0,1.0,9/3/2018,"The food I will honestly say was delicious and I would definitely go for the soup dumplings at another sister restaurant. However, the service was incredibly disappointing and the reason why I would not return for any group event due to multiple incidents. First, upon making a reservation we were not informed that it was expected that with large groups they would like us to do a pre-fixe menu. After we were seated and had drinks ordered, this was told. Naturally, 14 girls out to celebrate a birthday did not want to have a four course meal suddenly. This took over a half hour to sort out with the waiter going back and forth with the manager and the manager never taking a second to personally speak with us. Second, multiple people ordered drinks and had to ask repeated times for the drink to still not receive it. For example, I asked for this prior to the meals arriving and did not receive it till much after the food was over. People ultimately started going upstairs at the bar for drinks personally. Third, nearly an extra hundred dollars was added accidentally to our bill. One or two items is understandable on a busy holiday weekend, but 6 items is unacceptable and very unprofessional. Fourth, after several unprofessional incidents, the server had the nerve to pull aside the birthday girl to say that 15% tip was not enough. That is very rude and uncomfortable for her when we clearly were paying for her and the experience was terrible. This was meant to be an enjoyable experience to celebrate a birthday and instead was unnecessarily stressful. With multiple unprofessional incidents, the manager did not even take the time to speak with us. I was very disappointed and I am hoping this review would incite some review of the professionalism of the staff.",1,,

Once we got to Stanton Social we opted out of Restaurant Week and chose to eat from the regular menu because in the end you weren't saving much (Which is what Restaurant Week is supposed to be for, upscale restaurants that regular Joe's/Jane's can't afford).   Anyways, Stanton Social is an upscale restaurant where Chef/Part-Owner Chris Santos created tapas style diverse unique small plates, case in point one, one of the appetizers we got was the French Onion Soup Dumplings and O-M-G it was AMAZING. I'm already obsessed with French Onion soup and having the taste of a soup in a dumpling it just took it to whole new level. Another favorite of mine was the Mexican Street Corn Ravioli, tasted just like the Mexican corn and I wanted more. So sad that for three pieces of raviolis it cost $18. We both got the Strawberry Fields, tasted same as the ones I made when I bartended at the bars of JetBlue at JFK Airport.

After we were seated at a bit over 9PM, we ordered the beef Wellington, ceviche, potato fries, pasta and branzino. Overall the food is good but I am unsure if it tasted good because it was really good or it was because we were extremely hungry. Since it was my friend's birthday, we received a complementary cupcake and we got ourselves 3 birthday shots as they look too cute to pass up. Overall, I had a great time here but I just wished they would honor our reservation better as they specifically called us to not be late the day before.",,,

Cocktails average to about $15 each so obviously paying $25 for the unlimited feature makes more sense. The food ranged between about $14-$25ish for literally the smallest portions. Understandably, seafood is pricier than anything else, but the Lobster Benedict came with two little things of eggs for $22. The chicken taquitos were a few dollars less but came with like 4 bite size pieces... I'm still so confused by their pricing system. * The drinks. The bottomless drinks option for 1.5 hours was cute but the drinks themselves weren't that great. You're given a limited selection of drinks and like 75% of them were sh*t. The ""bittersweet"" mimosa was pretty much just bitter and we had to chug it just to get rid of it. The Bloody Mary was just awful; we had to send it back. The Bellini was decent (but I feel like anything would've tasted good after that damn Bloody Mary). The coffee cocktail was probably the best one and I really liked that they put actual coffee in it. * The service was neither here nor there. The hostess and our waitress were friendly for the most part. However going around our party of eight, she took everyone's order except for mine and was ready to start collecting the menus... so there's that. I was worried that it would've been a struggle to flag her down to refill our drinks before our 1.5 hours were up, but she was pretty good about it. The food took quite a while but taking into consideration how busy it was and how pretty our plates were, I wasn't mad about it. So I guess this is more of a 3.5 star review. But I rounded down because after spending so much on brunch, I can't afford to pay the extra half star. #sorryboutit",6,4,2
166,Loren M.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,36,3,3.0,7/22/2017,"DO NOT order the ""chicken and waffles."" You will be sadly disappointed. They should just call this ""chicken nugget on soggy bread."" It's basically frozen chicken nugget on a soggy waffle over a can of cream corn. Truly disgraceful to the name Chicken and Waffles. The fish tacos are good, small, but yummy. This is the type of place you go get drinks and be extra for no reason.",,,
167,Melissa S.,"New York, NY",10,161,12,4.0,2/4/2018,"I came here for restaurant week with a few co workers and were very pleased with the ambiance, accommodating staff, and amazing food!!The restaurant week menu was very filling! However I am not sure if I would come here without the RW promotion. It's quite pricey for the amount of food you get. For one small plate of meatballs (2 I believe) it is almost $20. If you can afford that, then go for it, bc I'm sure they are amazing meatballs! But that's not in my budget. Space is very tight downstairs. There are restrooms on first floor and on the top floor! The top floor is much more spacious, FYI.",,,
168,Samuel O.,"Brooklyn, NY",217,28,14,5.0,10/8/2017,"If you have some money to blow, come to Stanton Social. You will get your money's worth. Located at a prime location on the LES, it does not disappoint. I came here with two of my buddies for brunch and we all had their bottomless brunch option, which was 25$ for each of us and we all had to do it. It was 1.5 hours of drinks. We all had pomegranate peach bellinis, strong and delicious, in which they were very attentive with refilling, so I must've had about 8. The food itself was pricey but delicious. Everything in here is served family style, apologies to selfish people. We had about five entrees between 3 of us and every single one was amazing. French onion soup dumplings were just unbelievably good. The chicken n waffles were better than your average chicken n waffles, both chicken and waffle. The hue is rancheros soft tacos were a dream. The social Mac n cheese was unique and amazing. Lastly, the crispy-Barrio style chicken taquitos were on point.After entrees, we had the milk shake shots which were amazing and I could not tell whether it had alcohol or not!Bill was around 60-70 per person with the bottomless option, but we left all feeling completely satisfied and like we got our money's worth. I'd recommend this place to any group on the LES that wants to try a variety of well made and delicious foods.",3,,1

I would recommend the pirogies. So delicious. I would also recommend the potato latkes! These we're BOMB!  If you look for a solid Bloody Mary when you're brunching, I would not get one here. It's made with beet juice or something. It was just not the same. The place was pretty busy, so I would recommend making a reservation. All in all, good brunch spot!",,,
171,Jenny Z.,"New York, NY",37,145,536,4.0,7/29/2015,"OMG, Amazing (the food part)! Came here for my bday dinner, I've never been here but based on friends' recommendations and yelp reviews - I made the right decision! Due to the size of our party, we had to pick from their pre-fixe menu, which had most of their signature dishes and generous portions - $64 per person and we were completely stuffed!!!The Kobe Beef sliders, Lamb Gyros, Chicken and Waffles, Fried Dough, Potato and Goat Cheese stuffed Pierogies, and Reverse Chip Cookies were absolutely divine! BTW, I even took the left over reverse chip cookies home - I could eat them ALL DAY :) The French Onion soup dumplings were good, but maybe my expectations were set too high from reading the reviews or the fact that I am just not a big fan of French Onion Soup or maybe both, it was just OK to me. Though, I loved the cheese crust and pretty much ate all the leftover cheese! The scallops were my least favorite, in fact, most of us did NOT like them at all! I'm not a picky eater by any means, but they were SO FISHY - yuck! Aside from that, all the other dishes were awesome (even the fries and kale chip - YUM!).The staff was nice, but I did feel like we were treated a bit like a production line (could be because we're a large group and they already know our orders). it was just collect empty plates, gather the leftovers onto one plate to make room, and bring the next round of food. I don't think anyone came around to ask how our food was, if we needed anything (besides drinks), or our experience... Would given them 5 stars if they did. I would still come back, so it's still a happy story after all :)",5,1,1

We got a few sharing options: banana pancakes, fish tacos, Oreo cookie pancakes, Kobe beef burgers, mac & cheese and boy we were stuffed.Tried the lemonade which was very nice and refreshing with Sunday brunch. The restaurant was very busy, we went upstairs for a drink and the music was cool, bar was busy. I would definitely recommend Sunday brunch @ Stanton Social.",,,
173,Kristina O.,"Manhattan, NY",1,55,12,2.0,2/8/2018,"Pro tip--stop by your local diner and order a cup of French Onion Soup, it'll save you $15! Seriously everyone----there is NOTHING spectacular about these ""famous"" French onion soup dumplings. If anything, it's a massive rip-off. Small little spoonfuls of the soup we alllllll love (or didn't realize we love so much, apparently) in little escargot dishes. My husband and I laughed hysterically, and I'm sure the owner does, too, that people could possibly go apeshit over a little twist on a recipe. Rest of the food is just good, great ambiance, a tad more expensive than it should be, and that's that.",,,

176,Jenn S.,"Point Lookout, NY",524,755,1299,3.0,9/25/2016,"Way back when in my mid 20's I had a sizeable bday bash here...thought the service and food were excellent. Though I may have been heavily intoxicated then...possibly under some influence of some non prescription substances or two as well...but I digress. Ambiance is still as beautiful as always. Staff is also pretty to look at as well as the presentation of their dishes. But it ends there really. On the surface this place has it going on. But dig deep and the results are just as mediocre as some of the diners in the area. Ordered off their brunch menu. Doughnut dough hadn't been proofed long enough so although the exterior was nice and golden brown the interior was raw and gummy. The oreo pancakes were just Ok, the cream layers was reminiscent of an oreo but the rest was not and our oreo crumble on top tasted stale. The French onion soup dumplings were ok, nothing to really write home about and the chicken and waffles were the star of the meal but wished the waffle was a bit crispier. Our server apparently was ""too busy"", though there were plenty of open tables, so someone else took our order and then they all kept disappearing. We had to chase them down for water, chase them down for our check then chase them again to take our payment and process all the while when the restaurant wasn't busy. Odd.Great place for a party, for drinks, even some of the food items but service needs major help.",1,1,
177,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",446,371,0,2.0,9/22/2016,"This is one of those places that thinks it's cool to be rude to customers and judge them upon entering, decide that they're not really cool enough to be here, but let them in reluctantly so they will spend lots of money on very little food. When I entered I was judged by the 2 hostesses and then some of the waitstaff.The food itself tasted pretty good, but for the price everything is so, so small. The vibe and crowd = meatpacking trying to be lower east side and the reverse at the same time. Oh and it's very, very loud. Like I can only hear people directly to my left and right loud (not the person across). If this all sounds like fun to you, then you should definitely come here. And oh, we probably wouldn't get along.",1,1,

180,Katie P.,"Marina del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",118,237,209,4.0,7/9/2015,"Came here on Saturday as a group of 4 with a reservation. We were seated right away in a nice circular booth on the first floor. The place is decorated very modern supper club, and has a cool vibe inside. Our server was friendly and gave us some great suggestions for dishes. He suggested 8-10 small plates would be enough to feed our group (most plates come with 3-4 pieces). We ordered two of his suggestions: French Onion Dumplings and Potato and Goat Cheese Perogies. As well as:Littlenecks on the half shellRed snapper tacosCast iron shrimpCrab cakesHamachi tartareGrilled Caprese pizzaMini lamb gyrosI personally don't eat meat, just seafood, so some items I didn't try, however, everything I did eat was delicious. My personal favorite were the snapper tacos, and my fiancé's vote goes to the pierogies. The only dish I wasn't crazy about was the pizza. Not bad, just wouldn't order it again with all of these other amazing dishes on the menu. We all left full and happy and with a fistful of Stanton Social matches that are up for grabs on the way out. Not a bad night. I highly recommend this place for groups (leave the picky eaters at home), but I think it'd be a great place to come just as a duo with a hefty appetite.",3,,1
181,Aaron B.,"Rockville, MD",0,3,0,2.0,2/12/2018,"This one is conflicting because the food was actually very good and the atmosphere was lively. I have to give two stars however because we were seated an hour and 15 minutes AFTER our reservation. The hostess, although she was clearly being pulled in 10 different directions, was very rude to us. We kept  being told we would be seated shortly every 20 minutes and told to wait upstairs because it was too busy downstairs. Well it was too busy upstairs as well and the drinks that we begrudgingly bought during our wait were very expensive. My guess is that management knows exactly what theyre doing, in that forcing people to wait and buy expensive drinks and order more food once seated because of the additional hunger.I would definitely not go back on a weekend. I would consider a Monday night only because the food was good but I will not stay longer than 15 minutes past my reservation.",,,
182,Richard W.,"Harrison, NJ",72,248,90,3.0,3/18/2017,"The bottom line with this place is: the food is very tasty, beautifully presented, and the service is great.  However, I just can't swallow the price for the portion size.  To that end, I would almost eat something before coming here to make sure you are full enough by the end.    The bottom line is: don't come here expecting to be full in any way.  The end of the meal is somewhat anticlimactic without the arrival of an entree.  But, unlike dimsum or proper tapas, you really do want and need that entree.  You need to think of coming here as if you are buying tickets to a show and the show also comes with food (sort of a really extended amuse bouche).  That way, you'll really enjoy yourself rather than be sad at the end.",2,1,1

188,Kerry G.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,226,323,4.0,11/22/2015,"Ordered: Oreo pancakes, Eggs benedict, Potato and goat cheese pierogies, Ricotta fritters, and French onion soup dumplingsPros--The Oreo pancakes were fluffy and its syrup made the pancakes melt in your mouth. It had the perfect amount of sweetness from the Oreo cream and Oreo cookie crumbles. The ricotta fritters were creamy and came with a great raspberry cranberry sauce. These would be the only two items I would reorder.Cons--The pierogies were okay. The goat cheese flavor wasn't apparent which was needed to lighten up and balance the potato. They were also oddly garlicky. The French onion soup dumplings squirted out the soup which wasn't expected or visually appealing. The dumplings' flavors needed to be simpler as well. The flavors were too overpowering and the dish was in need of an ingredient (like sour cream) to lighten it.",,,

194,Linn G.,"New York, NY",23,6,7,4.0,1/8/2018,"One of my favorite restaurants in New York! I usually suffer from debilitating indecisiveness when presented with a menu, and thus small plates restaurants like Stanton Social, where you can try a little bit of everything, are ideal for me. I also tend to love anything created by executive chef Chris Santos, who has an incredible gift when it comes to combining flavors. I've been here countless times and tried most of the vegetarian items on the menu, plus some of the non-vegetarian items modified (for example, you can get the mac and cheese without the Italian sausage). My absolute favorite thing on the menu, which I get every single time without fail, are the pierogies. They come with a truffle creme fraiche that is delicious beyond words, and are a definite must-try. Other favorites include the french onion soup dumplings (I was skeptical towards these and didn't try them until my third time here, only to regret waiting so long!) and the ravioli (especially the Mexican street corn ravioli, as they tend to rotate the flavors depending on the season). For dessert, I have the birthday cake shot every single time, though the other desserts also look amazing. I've heard people complain that this place is pretentious and 'sceney', and though I personally don't find it that way, they do play the music quite loud which makes it a little difficult to carry a conversation. I've also had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table on several occasions in spite of being on-time for my reservation, which is annoying only because they make you wait upstairs in the bar area and I'm not a huge fan of traipsing up and down precariously steep stairs in high heels. However, at the end of the day, the food is so good that it's more than worth tolerating the overly loud music and potential wait time for.",,,

The pacing and order that they brought out the dishes was also well done. 4 stars because the service was quite slow, and they even forgot a few of the dishes we ordered.

These were great - Put these on your short list: Lamb Gyros, Red Snapper Tacos, Crispy Brussels Sprouts - Pass on the following: Meatballs (slightly above average), Sour Dumplings (meh), Mac & Cheese, Hanger Steak - Dessert - worth saving room for dessert",2,1,1

The atmosphere and decor gave off an elegant appearance without being too trendy. The Tao Group usually does a great job ambiance. Good service from the staff. As far as the food, it may be more for those with an acquired taste. I like to try new and different meals but my girlfriend is a very picky eater, so the way the food was prepared didn't quite meet her likings even though she still enjoyed the experience. I ordered the ""Rhode Island Lobster Roll w/ fries"", ""The Staton Social Beef Wellington"", ""Social Mac & Cheese"", while my girlfriend had the ""Dry Rubbed Barbeque Heritage Baby Back Ribs"". For dessert we had ""Birthday Cake Milkshake Shots"" and Oreo Yodels (which I believe is no longer on the menu). Even though I enjoyed the food, I didn't care for how the beef Wellington is prepared. It pastry seemed to have too much space between. I'm accustomed to the pastry wrapping being ""tightly"" baked around the steak filet. So I ultimately just broke the pastry from around the steak and ate. The barberque ribs were very tender and would fall off the bone. I thought that they were good but my girlfriend (the picky eater) thought that the texture was too soft and kinda grossed her out. I still ate it!!!!...LOL...With that being said it's just best to know what you'd DEFINITELY enjoy eating and how it should be prepared. But like I said, we both STILL enjoyed the service and felt it was still worth every dime. We plan to visit again.",,,

Fried wontons with raw tuna inside it.Lamb Osso Buco Arancini: Melt in your mouth lamb.All in all, all the items were unique and great tasting.
