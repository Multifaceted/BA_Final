1,1,10/24/2018,600,1,"Manhattan, NY",Sheila R.,3238,3.0,84,Stopped in on a Friday night after a ballet show. Dj was cool playing top 20 and some old reggae/techno. Very spacious and you can either grab a seat on a small couch if you're there early or sit at the bar.,2
2,,3/5/2018,117,,"New York, NY",Jake B.,1,1.0,5,"I was there this past Saturday.PROS:1. Friendly crowd2. Friendly security guy at the doorCONS:1. They charged me 16USD+tax per tequila shot. I could buy a bottle with this money. Their ""cocktails"" have less than 2oz, you get a small glass filled with ice. Total rip off.2. My friend (who happens to be a girl) was getting free drinks and flirts from the same waiter that was giving me a cold shoulder. 3. The place was hot and stuffy. Everyone was sweating and the other guests left early because it was getting disgusting. Even from the pictures u could tell they are sweaty. _Never again.",
3,,1/6/2018,210,,"Manhattan, NY",Farah A.,0,1.0,19,"This place doesn't even deserve a star but yelpWon't allow a lesser rating. Both the bar ""bouncer"" and the hotel manager were rude and condescending to my friend. The bouncer did however let in a group of drunk idiots, one of which who threw-up curb side.  Never coming again. Makes me embarrassed about my city, NYC.",
4,,4/4/2017,6,,"Palm Springs, CA",Abhishek P.,2,4.0,78,"Came for a get together and the place, while very well decorated, has your typical bougie NYC feel to it. Very dimly lit, nice bar, seductive furniture/lighting and ambience, with less than optimal drinks and cocktails. It's like being in the meatpacking, without having to trip over cobblestone in heels or deal with the superficiality. Cool place if looking to be fancy or have a large group to cater too. Would certainly come back if needed to, but not likely to be a self driven decision. It's certainly a place that I will recommend to a certain group of friends I have and completely avoid for others.",
5,,5/25/2017,38,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Julia S.,145,5.0,148,"Cool bar to have a drink and some snacks with friends, and also dance! The place is really nice and spacious. It has a very huge area with a counter and tables, and another smaller room for dancing. Great for a Saturday night!",
6,,1/8/2017,17,,"Hoboken, NJ",T T.,42,2.0,276,"It's a trendy place but also feels really worn. The drinks are very expensive, as other people have noted. It's a hotel bar/nightclub. Three separate areas. The nightclub area is so dark you can't see anything and you will need to scream at your friends.Sadly, our bartender elena tried to jip us by $10. It was hard to get her attention after she left us the reduced amount. When she did finally acknowledge our effort to have her come back she gave the money, didn't offer an apology or even say a word, she just walked away. And she doesn't give you any physical coins back, and rounds you down in her favor.  Bottom Line: I would watch your change here. So consider using a credit card but I wouldn't leave an open tab.",8
7,4,11/18/2015,2144,2,"Manhattan, NY",Allene T.,3204,4.0,1291,"I came here for my birthday gathering a week after it had... reopened, I suppose.  I made a reservation for a table in the back for 20 people and there was absolutely no fuss.  Not even a minimum spend, which I was surprised... maybe because it wasn't all too packed/popular yet?The space was great - theres plenty of floor and seating space.  A bar up front, seating all around the sides, and a dance floor in the middle.  The area we sat at was comfortable and not too crowded, though the lighted floor was almost too bright for us.The crowd was all sorts of people - the rowdier crowd, the ""chiller"" crowd, etc.  All kinds of people from all sorts of places.Drinks - the drinks here are huge.  A single was poured like a double, and a double filled the entire glass.Music was excellent - old stuff, new stuff - great DJ that evening.Great place by Columbus Circle.",13
8,,3/8/2018,176,,"Brooklyn, NY",Jordan C.,1,1.0,53,"Incredibly rude service this evening. The bar tender forgot to make my order twice, then when I called him out on it he challenged me that I even ordered at all. The correct thing to do would just have been make the drink.",
9,,9/13/2017,35,,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",Lauren C.,3,5.0,83,In the middle of it all is this gem. Pricey but worth the drinks and the memories.,
10,,11/12/2016,213,,"Manhattan, NY",Daniela L.,4,4.0,10,"Pros: The decor is really nice and I would feel comfortable bringing friends here. It's not too crowded so it's easy to find seating and avoid the claustrophobic feeling of East Village and Meatpacking.Cons: The drinks are not that good, so I would recommend just sticking to beer or ordering off the menu. It's not that great for dancing because of the music and the lack of people (so it's easy to feel out of place if you dance there). The DJ when I went (11/12/2016, a Friday night) was not that good-- as far as I'm concerned it was just a spotify playlist with throwbacks set to transition into one another.",2
11,1,1/8/2016,130,1,"Oxnard, CA",Mallory L.,1172,4.0,495,"This is my favorite of the three bars in the Hudson. It's spacious enough so everyone has somewhere to sit, but the atmosphere is still intimate and romantic because the seats are far apart and you have privacy. Drinks are pretty pricey, so be ready to spend some serious dough. Or come on a date and have him pay, advised my friend.",2
12,,5/26/2016,53,,"New York, NY",Kimberly T.,10,4.0,385,"Time and time again a solid stop for cocktails with a girlfriend and her mom who were visiting. I'm back here often and stopping one of the many Hudson Hotel options. The Hudson bar doesn't disappoint. Spacious, not overly crowded and attentive staff.",
13,,12/4/2016,18,,"Garden Grove, CA",Dennis D.,0,2.0,10,Nice atmosphere but the drinks are very pricy ($30 cocktails).  Service is mediocre.  A quick drink with a cool view and bounce. Not a place I would visit twice.,1
14,2,8/6/2016,0,2,"Los Angeles, CA",Andrea C.,0,1.0,14,"Completely ridiculous dress code, they only allow 'hard shoes'. Which means guys can wear whatever shoes they want including tennis shoes; but girls have to wear heels, or closed toe shoes. No open toe sandals, and no open toe flats, Which is totally crazy in the summer when that is what most people wear.",3
15,,11/5/2016,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Rebecca Z.,0,4.0,5,"Nice classy place to meet up and have a few drinks before heading out for the night. Lots of open space and comfy couches, good for catching up one on one or with a larger group. Bouncer was awesome and gave a free drink voucher for having the same birthday! Came in handy as the drinks, while strong, are a bit overpriced.",1
