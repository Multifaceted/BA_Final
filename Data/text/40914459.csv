My bf and I knew that we wanted to go to a Comedy Cellar show on our trip to NYC, and since reservations at the OG location are instantly booked out, I made reservations at the Village Underground. This venue is still an intimate and charming little place, and the show was just perfect. I had made the reservation for Halloween night, and knowing that there's a Halloween parade at the village, we headed out extra early. Our show was at 7:30 and we made it there around 6:50, and since we were a party of two, we were able to get a front row table! We were literally an arms distance from the comics. Of course, you get made fun of when you sit in the front row but that made the whole experience extra fun! You might not know everyone in the lineup, but they are really all so good. The service here is also really top notch. Even though it's such a packed venue, they manage to discretely take your orders without disrupting the show. Not to mention they're all super friendly. Overall it was an amazing experience. I'd definitely come back and I recommend this to anyone in or traveling to NYC!",1,1,1

The lady sitting on the desk said we have to wait 7 minutes before she can add us to the ""paper"" waiting list. After the seven minutes passed, we went to her then she pointed us to a bouncer eating at the bar. I went to him gave him my name at 6:45 and he asked me to come back at 7:30 since am the first on the list. We came back at 7:28 and then he asked us to go out to the curb. He came out looking me in the face and called bunch of people infront of us. He called ""kaleb"" and when I asked the bouncer said he called me 4 times and I didn't answer U said u called Kaleb and bunch of people walked to you. He said now am the bottom of the list cause I didn't answer. Went back to the girl she said not their problem and if I want I can wait for the next show.I told them they called the wrong name but I guess it doesn't matter cause my name is not a typical name that matches the ""club policy""",2,,

The comedians were high quality, realtively known names, and diverse in person and comedic style. They interacted with the crowd without being caustic, and the host was quite funny as well.Food was fine, unremarkable (note that there is a 2 item minimum per person, which seems like a lot) The place gets packed, and it can get really snug in there. However, I'd still recommend this place without reservation. Looking forward to bringing some friends back soon.",2,,2
3,Emily F.,"Torrance, CA",275,127,349,4.0,1/3/2018,"Came to New York for the second time with my boyfriend and everyone recommended to check out comedy shows, especially at Comedy Cellar. We first made reservations online for the 9:15 pm show, which don't ensure you get a seat. You also don't pay for tickets until the end of the show, so you're just reserving your spots. AND you'll still need to check in and grab your tickets an hour ahead, like 8:15 pm.There was a sister bar next door, which we hung out at for a bit. Once it hit 9 pm, we walked over to the venue and got in. Because we had picked up tickets so early, we were literally seated in the front row, so close you could see every pore and detail of the comedian's face. Too close for comfort and we were crammed in a tight spot with the other folks. But ah, they can't help it. They need to utilize every inch of the space. The waitress was super attentive; she kept coming back to check up on us. The venue seating was pretty uncomfortable, but the jokes were hilarious. I haven't laughed that hard since I saw Kevin Hart at the ComedyFest in San Francisco. I'll definitely come back again to laugh my ass off.",2,1,1

6,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4581,2941,8893,4.0,1/25/2018,"You know why I love comedy shows? Because I like laughing. Like most people, if online dating profiles are to be believed. If you don't like laughing, you have bigger problems than reading this review can help you with. The Village Underground is a solid venue. The ceilings are low, the crowd is usually out for a good time, and the size of it means you can come out with larger groups than you can't get into a lot of venues. Speaking of, you should know walking in that despite the association, it's not the Cellar, so the lineup probably isn't full of the heavy hitters you've heard of. Dave Chappelle probably isn't going to be a last minute addition, so temper your expectations.But that doesn't mean you aren't going to see some great comics. Sure, the lineups can sometimes be a little hit or miss, but this is still NYC, so you're going to catch some seriously hilarious people. And if you really don't like them, you can always just drink until everything is funny.There's a two-drink minimum (standard), so you want to be getting your money's worth anyway. The food is just food. Order some fries to soak up the alcohol, and have some laughs.",13,14,11

We went on a Saturday without a reservation, put our names down about 30 min before the show started, and managed to get two seats. The line up was great, varied in quality and style of course. When there's a comedian who only tell clean jokes, always a fresh breath of air. We ordered some beers and a cocktail. service was as good as one can expect in such a crowded space.

10,Sarama D.,"Buffalo, NY",84,232,564,4.0,9/9/2017,The show was great. Me and the hubby went to see Hassan Minaj during our recent trip to NYC.  I actually really like the space at the village underground more then the actual comedy cellar tbh because it's more spacious and I like the different levels and seating options. The cellar always felt super cramped to me in the past.And cuz the hubby doesn't like being front and center we got a perfect spot in the small balcony portion that was just right for him :)The only thing I would say could have been better was a more clear description of how to actually get to the show space/ where to check in. We arrived about 15 mins early as the email said to do and it was very unclear where to actually go. Since you enter thru the actual bar maybe just make that clear in emails you guys send out. It def wasn't just us either.  It seemed to be atleast 6 different people that were waiting on the street very confused from 7:45 till 8:00 all asking each other what to do.  Eventually we asked the guy at the door to the pussycat and went in thru there.,2,,
11,Lorelei Y.,"New York, NY",274,325,141,2.0,12/12/2016,"Like many other reviewers, I came here for a Comedy Cellar show. The show itself was actually quite good (with the exception of one comic whose humor veered into unvarnished racism, which was a little awkward, especially as I'm a member of the ethnic group he was directing his vitriol towards), but the venue is a little lackluster.First of all, thanks to nearly non-existent lighting and bare stone walls, the vibe of this place is less ""cool basement"" and more ""terrifying underground dungeon,"" so there's that. Second, it's freezing in here! I wound up wearing my coat as a cape to keep myself warm. It's also incredibly cramped between tables, so expect to be bumping into other patrons, and vice versa, when people try to get in and out of their seats.Third, the food is pretty terrible. The friend I was with got mozzarella sticks, and they tasted like cafeteria food. She also wound up with a pretty terrible stomachache shortly after we left the show, so I'm pretty suspicious about the kitchen here.Drinks run a pretty standard $14 for cocktails (nothing exciting here, I'm sad to report; I got a gin and white tea cocktail, which was decent) and around $6 for generic beer and cider.The upshot: come for the comedy, not the eats.P.S. Random observation that doesn't really have a natural place in the body of the review: they're really into old America's Funniest Home Video clips here. A weird mash-up of AFV clips and weird 80s/90s dance videos greeted patrons as we entered and waited for the show to start; kind of odd.",8,3,1

The place is organized and well kept which is a nice being NYC. The show was great, it was good line up.

The comedians (all but one) had hilarious material that was executed perfectly. There is a 2 item minimum per person. The menu had snacks, some sandwiches, beer, wine, cocktails, martinis. It's a very small menu, but it was perfect for the venue. (I just had 2 Stellas so I can't comment on food).

Updated review","So I was sad to find out the house band wasn't performing on Saturday nights anymore and turned it to a comedy club that night.  I then gave it a try because I heard good things.If you have ever been to VU in the past for the band, it looks EXACTLY the same.....just filled the dance floor with tables.  So here's some tips:- Reservations are important....do it weeks in advance if you want a specific time.  They have different time slots starting from 7:15pm to 12:15am...check out their website.  I came to the 7:15pm showing and I went to the front doors at 6:30pm and they gave me my tickets and asked what area I wanted to be seated at.  It's first come first serve so we chose the front.  We pay everything at the end of the show.  Depending on the time you choose is how much you'll pay for a cover charge...mine was $20pp- There's 2 locations - There is a 2 drink minimum.  If you want munchies the calamari is pretty good.- If you sit in the front, bring a shawl or sweater....the air is pretty much on you and can get a bit nippy.- I had Marina As our host....she was fantastic - 5 comedians....I had 2 faves Greer Barnes and Leonard Outzs - They offer 25% off your food and drinks at the bar next door (The Fat Black Pussycat....gotta love the name) AFTER the show...they give you this offer card before the show begins.It was a great time.  The reason for 4 stars is because I was really cold in the front.  Now that I know I will definitely bring something to keep me warmer.",5,1,1

I have to first give a shout out to Liz F. - my experience here couldn't have been better.I'm not sure how this differs from CC, but as you've read they are sister venues. We had a really great view of the stage. In all, about 5-6 comedians came on; expect to spend about two hours here. They tell you to come 15 minutes prior and not any sooner ; it's really not necessary to come early. The food and drinks were perfect for the ambiance and the sangrias - just wow! Ordered a few pitchers for our table. I did think some of the acts were a bit strange... one girl was sick! And she even made jokes about her being germy... well by all means rest and get better, no one wants you to spread your germs. The people sitting in the front are generally going to be the butt of most jokes made. The last act was definitely a comedian that we all recognized (totally blanking on the name, but he's in some bigger comedies) - he was great.

Drinks and food were reasonably priced, providing an assortment of beer, martinis, and fried bar foods. The acts, although can vary depending on when you go, were great! I'm sure they their homework in ensuring the acts are sufficiently laughable. I would highly recommend making reservations when going as it is more than likely they would be sold out on a weekend night. I saw them have to turn down a number of people who didn't make reservations given the full house. This is definitely a great venue for dates or just a group of friends looking to laugh their faces off at someone else's own emotional expense.",,1,

45,Wesleyan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",416,318,25,4.0,4/26/2015,"I wouldve given them five stars, but te seating arrangement was ridiculous. (ill get to that at the end). The performances were jaw-dropping! Some were so entertaining and comical. I even gave one performance a standing ovation - that woman with the violin killed it!!! There were some performances that weren't that great, but nobody sucked. The host was even entertaining, as well as the house band!!Now to the reason why i dropped a star. We made reservations beforehand and was told that we would have a table. What they left out was that there would also be a party of 5 joining our table as well. (it was a total of 8, including us). It was not comfortable at all, because whoeever was at the end of the table had to keep getting up to allow those in the back to use the bathroom. All this annoyance for a $15 cover charge? But honestly, the performances were worth it, and i will be returning in the future, although not the immediate future.",6,2,

The boyfriend and I were looking for something to do during our vacation on a Wednesday night and I stumbled across this on yelp. This is a great hidden gem -- it's located under the Fat Black Pussycat (or whatever it's called.. What a name huh?). The fact that it's underground gives it a cool vibe! Wednesday night was actually perfect -- no cover fee!  There is a ""2 drink minimum"" per person but our waitress told us that it actually means two items. So I ordered a drink per recommendation of our very helpful & friendly waitress, cheese sticks, and the bf ordered a pineapple martini and chicken kabobs. The drinks were stronger than I expected but that was good because the price for it was not on the cheap side. The food was whatever. Best part of this place is the house band!

48,Sierra B.,"Queens, NY",603,115,246,5.0,3/16/2016,"--Sunday Night ""Ron Grant & Friends"" Open Mic Review--**In November 2015, after over 16 years, Ron Grant & Friends ended its run at the Village Underground and is looking for a new venue. Like many fans of this weekly mainstay, I can't wait for it to return!**Sunday night at the Village Underground is a legendary experience that transcends race, generation and occupation. Host Ron Grant, a veteran soul singer and talent scout, is an indelible force; his powerful vocals and stirring showmanship is the wind behind this very special evening. Frequent co-hosts Melonie Daniels, Cheryl Pepsi Riley and Kimberly Nichole are also enormous talents in their own right. Celebrity guests frequently take the stage or are spotted in the audience. Folks like Chaka Kahn, Prince and Jamie Foxx have been known to stop by. My mom once sat at a table with Mariah Carey! As Diddy would say, ""Take that, take that.""As an audience member, all you need is a love for soul music, a lil praise for the Lord and positive vibes to share. But if you're going to take the mic, make sure you've got a voice for the gawds, please; the lineup often totes multi-octave vocalists with impressive stage presence. This is not a place for American Idol rejects (aka the William Hung's of the world...you remember him, the ""She Bangs"" guy). This is also not a place for studio singers who do not know how to perform and harmonize with a live band.The night usually begins and ends with a riveting number from Ron himself. A bewitching rendition of Marvin Gaye's ""I Want You"" is one of his staples. Performers come from all over the world, with unique sounds and styles. I've never come here and had a bad experience (and I've been coming here since I was a child). On occasion there might be a lot of gospel singers, and if that's not your genre, I suggest waiting it out. 70-90s R&B, Funk, Quiet Storm and Neo Soul tunes tend to be the crowd pleasers.Details about the show: The show starts around 9:30 p.m. and is usually packed. Typically, a line begins to form outside of the venue around 8:00 p.m. Early arrival is necessary for large groups. Admission is $15 and seating is first come, first served, with the exception of reserved booths in the front. Drinks and bar fare are moderately priced ($7-15). There's usually a performance break around midnight, which allows for some of the audience to leave and seats open up for the late crowd. The show usually ends around 2:00 a.m. Singers sign up to participate in the beginning and play with a live band. The band is just as talented as the singers and one of the most adaptable and in-tune group of musicians I've ever come across. They deserve a bow.My experiences at the Village Underground, and at Ron Grant & Friends, more correctly, is an enduring part of my experience as a native New Yorker and I am thankful for them.",9,1,6

I love the live music and the down to earth feel it has. The one night we went the band was playing music as if we were in the heart of New Orleans.

There is still the 2 item minimum but I saw people getting 2 bottled waters so that may be my strategy next time, anyway the show was great as usual and aziz ansari was the special guest trying out some new material, there were maybe 5-6 comedians before him and they were all pretty funny, you get your bill when the show is ending and included is your cover and whatever items you get which needs to be stamped before you can leave, good spot to go to at least once, I know that sometimes there is live musical entertainment here so check the schedule before you go",2,,

My friend made reservations early around 9:30 pm and we were one of the very first groups to arrive but the place started to fill up pretty quickly.  There was no cover because we visited on a Wednesday.  The band that night was their house band and they were absolutely amazing and so talented.  They were so talented i forgot all about my problems and just enjoyed the very moment. Service for drinks was also great and our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  They do have a 2 drink or 2 item minimum per person and we easily met that minimum as we were there to kick off a fun filled weekend.

You can order food or drinksCons:1. Cover charge with minimum of 2 drinks2. Very loud - although there are booths as seating areas, you can't really have a conversation with your friends because it's extremely loud3. Waitresses took a very long time to take our orders4. You can't buy from the bar if you have a table - you have to order your drinks through the waitressNote: 1. I went on a Saturday and the band was playing cover songs. Anything from 80s oldies to present day hits. 2. Although the place is very casual, the drinks are somewhat pricey for the amount. I bought 5 tequila shots and paid $10.50 a shot.Tip:1. Reserve a table through the site before you go. You won't get charged extra and you'll definitely get a table. I reserved a table the day of - about three hours before to be exact. It was an easy process, I was with a group of five and as soon as we got there we were seated.",13,,
56,Cass A.,"New York, NY",1708,19,54,2.0,9/24/2016,Beware! I was there with my cousin visiting from San Fran for the Saturday 10pm show. The entrance was through the side entrance of the crowded Fat Black Cat bar next door. A big heavy set black man blocking the door told us it was $15 each cash only so we paid him and gave us a seat card. We enjoyed the show and got the 2 drink minimum. When we got the bill at the end of the show we were charged another $15 each on the bill. When I told the waitress that we paid at the door she said that no one collects at the door. She brought the manager over and he said none of their staff would do that and we were scammed by someone at the door pretending they worked there. Go there at your own risk and prepare to be scammed! There's no way good natured guests could anticipated this scam unless they're warned. Best to avoid this place altogether!,8,1,

59,Kayleigh K.,"Orange, CA",18,24,18,4.0,1/27/2014,"Such a fun night! We came here on a Saturday for a double date. Arrive early! We arrived 15 minutes before the 7:15 show, which ended up being perfect timing as we were seated in an amazing booth in the middle of the room. The room is seated from front to back, so if you enjoy sitting in the front and don't mind being a part of the jokes, come early. Being a student, I'm pretty price conscious and was worried we were going to be spending a ton with the 2 item minimum on top of the $20 cover fee. However, the menu turned out to have a range of options at various price points. The 2 item minimum includes food, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Food ranged from $2.50-$9.50, while drinks ranged from $5.50 (bud lite) to $12 (premium martinis).  Note that the suggested tip on your receipt will be calculated off the total, including the cover charge, but you should only tip for your drinks & food.As for the show, the comedians were great! We were laughing the whole night.  The jokes are very, very non-PC, so just be aware of that.  Service was not great - it was a bit hard to get our waitress's attention.  The alcoholic drinks were mixed - beers were fine, but some of the martinis were quite syrupy and pretty lackluster.  The food was terrible - some of the worst I've had in NYC, or anywhere for that matter.  So try to eat dinner beforehand :)All in all, it's worth going, but only for the comedians.",7,,
60,Ajay R.,"Brooklyn, NY",614,620,398,3.0,12/7/2013,"I came here for a comedy night since the Comedy Cellar expanded into this venue.  My only gripe with this place was the bill.  I find it pretty sleezy of management to include the cover charge along with the food and drinks on one bill... then calculate the suggested tip based on the full total.  Tips are for service, not a cover charge.  Exactly what service did you provide when I paid you to let me in the door?  I know it's just a ""suggestion"", but management knows full well the psychology of this... and I'm pretty sure they've been enjoying the effective 30-50% tips they've been getting on their food and service now.  I just find this very underhanded.  This place is already one of the most expensive comedy nights out in NYC (at $20 pp + 2 item minimum), so trying to gouge your customers on a tip at the end is just poor form.That aside, the comedy and the atmosphere are great.  Just pay extra attention when the bill comes to your table.  I really hope management corrects this soon.",30,3,4

The solos make you wonder how ""artists"" we hear on the radio make it to our stations but powerful and talented people like them play in a bar.

We stood in line for 20 min, had Ids checked, moved to the bottom of the stairs, by were not given a card and were sent back up to the beginning of the line after being denied admittance. They then resat us at two tables after we waited in line again. A couple of the comedians were mediocre, however, the headliner was great and made up for all of the annoyances of getting in.

The singers of the group had amazing voices and sang a number of covers that had almost everyone in the audience singing along. Toward the end of the night, the dance floor was filled with people having a good time. We didn't have to pay cover on a Thursday night.

Natural flair. That's the Village Underground.My friends were looking to find a bar/dance club with fairly reasonable prices in the village last weekend. With the help of my Yelp Community, I found this place. The line wasn't too long out the door, but the place looked bumpin'. In case you didn't know the Village Underground is connected to the Fat Black Pussycat. The FBP is a lounge (free of charge) but the VU you have to pay $15 to get in. Not rediculously pricey, considering you can go to both locations. Okay I have to admit, I am a NYC nightlife newbie. Ask me of some good places on LI and I'll drop some names, but Manhattan is a different story. So bare with me here peeps.When walking in, I saw a wall of celebrity pictures from Ray Romano to Derek Jeter. So I thought to myself, hey this place must be good. We all headed straight downstairs and BAM. I heard the smoothest, funkiest, soulful music I've ever heard in my life. People were dancing and jamming to the live band. It's actually not that big downstairs. I would say it's split into two... half seating, half dancefloor and stage. The band that was playing, I wish I remembered their name however, I will not forget their sound. There was a man and woman singing along with the sickest guitar player. I mean that guy had SKILLS. Those rifts and those vocals, wowza.The only thing I wish differently about this place was the size of the dancefloor. People were having fun but it was person against person, (not my fav.) The live band switched on and off with the DJ who played everything from rachet to pop to hip hop. And a little bit of old school (well old school for me). Drinks are of course pricey... $12 for a whiskey ginger or a jack and coke. But trust me, they're not watered down in the slightest. If you want to try something new and a positive change of scene, I would HIGHLY recommend this place. Give it a shot and feel the music, I had a blast and hope you do too.",15,5,5
72,Veronica A.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,13,0,1.0,1/24/2016,"Solid five stars for the comedy show, but 1 star for the RAW FOOD I was served. The dim lighting, set up and size of the place makes for an enjoyable atmosphere. Arriving just before the 8:30p show without any reservations, we were accomodated without a problem.  We were seated at a booth in the back where they sat 6 people per table. This was a little cramped and I suggest installing bag hooks underneath the tables to maximize seating space. But I get it, these comedy undergrounds are often closterphobic, so this wasn't surprising at all. The comedians here were great and it was truly one of the most enjoyable shows I've seen in the city for the price. However, I have one substantial complaint: DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN SKEWERS. Everything was going well until I bit into severely undercooked chicken skewers. For $2 per skewer, I ordered two of these chicken skewers. Wary of the unusually tender meat I had bit into (for chicken), I cut open the next chunk. To my horror, the chicken in the middle was straight up raw, not pink, RAW. UNCOOKED. I immediately notified our waitress who apologized profusely. Since we were in the middle of a comedy act, I didn't want to make a big deal it. Can you imagine if I had eaten two skewers full of raw chicken? Thank god I only ate one piece and didn't end up sick.",,,

81,Stan S.,"Manhattan, NY",152,134,606,1.0,7/24/2016,I've been coming here for every. I can not believe there not going to be no more open mic.  I would have never ever thought this would happen.  This was the best place in nyc for good music. Where do I go now. The Groove!!! It's the same. But not the same.,,,
82,Ebony C.,"Brooklyn, NY",338,495,140,4.0,12/8/2010,"When you want great live music...Im talking about hearing great Chaka, some Stevie, Lenny K, Nirvana, and even a lil of MJB. This is the place to be on a Friday night. The house band is one of my favs..They can do any and every thing! You might run into a few celebs who just want to to hear other musicians or join the jam session. I went one Friday night and John Mayer just walked and joined the band......HOTTTTTT!! On Sunday & Monday nights it's open mic night. Sundays are with Ron Grant, and Mondays are w/ R&B Great Vocal powerhouse Cheryl Pepsi Riley. Don't fret you wont just hear someone who definitely sounds a mess. You will definitely be treated to some of the best musicians NYC has to offer. One complaint: Service is not the greatest, I'm talking about a waitress disappearing for like an 1hr. But it can't keep me away I love music and understand that some people just really hate their job...LOL! You will not be disappointed... You'll probably even see me there singing my heart out!!!",4,1,
83,Ivan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,131,17,4.0,7/25/2016,"This is an older review, but a well worth one. Came here many many years ago roughly in 2005 to 2010 time frame. I came here by mistake the first time because I thought it was the FBPC room that was new. But I found out it wasnt and it was something different. Of course I was reluctant to pay 10 bucks to enter a bar or so I thought it was just a bar. What I found was something better. Music loud and enjoyable. Crowded but had a blast. Came here again for a friends bday and we just turned up til 4am. One of the better secrets of NYC.  And I put that its not good for dancing because they way the location is set up, it provided little wiggle room to move. But an overall enjoyable place.",,,

Definitely come check this place out - you never know what amazing talent you'll get to see.",,,

I love live music and when I moved to the city almost a year ago now I scouted Yelp and asked friends for recommendations on places to go, and this was top on my list. I went on a Friday night with a friend and had a blast! I made reservations online which I guess helps guarantee you a seat, although based on advice from other Yelpers my friend and I arrived about 20 minutes before the 10:00 show. We were seated in comfy booths in front of the stage but spent time alternating between singing along with the band, grooving in our seats and dancing on the floor in front of the stage. The energy was so live and everyone seemed to be having a good time!The musicians were entertaining not only with their songs, but also with the jokes and comments they'd make between songs. In the middle of the band's set the DJ played popular songs and kept the crowd up and dancing. I will definitely be back!Pros:1. Prime location off the train W 4th st2. Great /energy/ambiance3.

I book reservations online 2 hours before, it was $14/pp plus 2 drink minimum. I had been drinking earlier and had work the next day, so I pretty much ordered bottled water and a beer. If you don't meet your minimum 2 item requirement/pp, they will pretty much as you to. Otherwise the lineup was solid, they had a live band, I would definitely go back.

The comedians and musicians were great, but the staff overshadowed what would have otherwise been an enjoyable night. It was my friend's birthday and she took out her phone to coordinate plans with other friends. Granted, phones are - apparently strictly - not allowed, but instead of politely asking her to put her phone away, the staff harassed her during and after the show and made her feel horrible. She offered to let them see her phone to show she hadn't taken any photos or videos and they said ""I don't need to see your phone."" It was just a power trip. I don't ever post reviews, but when people ruin my friend's birthday, my protective side comes out. If you love your friends, don't bring them here!",1,,

The band sung various genres, so there is definitely something for everyone.Guests should definitely arrive early. A friend  booked a big table to accommodate our large group, so that was a plus! The drinks were blah and I was disappointed that we were made to purchase 2 drinks per person.  I refused to pay over $10 for another cocktail, so I went for the water. $4 for a 16oz bottle  Also, bring cash!!!

Updated review","It's pretty crazy when you can say the BOUNCERS are much nicer than the staff at a club/lounge in NY. I have to give this place one star for the unprofessional treatment I received this past weekend. My sisters were visiting and requested I take them to a lounge and I figured they'd love the Village Underground. This place was packed to the gills which is usual and if you like constantly being pushed up against and crushed then this place is for you. If you'd like a place to sit and actually enjoy the place, you got to come early. I get that I get that. . We paid $15 and went downstairs to find there was NO WHERE to sit. While we stood there looking stupid the staff ignored us and we were again being pushed up against and molested by the foot traffic. We thought there was a vacant table and as we sat down and were prepared to order, you know SPEND SOME SERIOUS CASH we were rudely told that the table was reserved. Of course, there was no sign or anything on the table so I guess we were supposed to telepathically know that.  Confused I try to ask around for how to get a table but the staff was again unhelpful and after taking our entry fee money obviously didn't care. After standing around and being asked to move out of the way by another rude staff member (Move where!!?) I was annoyed, angry and over it. My sisters tried to enjoy themselves but a look at the compacted orgy fest of people dancing up on the stage wasn't our cup of tea.  We took our money and our good vibes to Iguanas which is FREE by the way.",2,,1
100,Jaclyn P.,"Queens Village, NY",15,37,38,5.0,4/6/2014,"I cant give this place anything lower than 5 stars being that I'm here almost every week. I used to go Wednesday for the band, which is fantastic. Now I come on sundays for the open mic and cant believe the talent that goes up there! I thought these people had to audition to perform at the Village Underground but one of the singers told me he just had to sign up. Its a mix of showtime at the Apollo meets the voice, except I swear the singers are some of the best i've ever heard.  Many times the singers are repeat performers which is great because it would be a pity to only see some of these performers sing only once. I'm Going again tonight and bringing my family, last week I  brought friends. To the review saying something about not being able to find a seat, it should be said that you get to see what the venue looks like before you decide to pay the entrance fee. So if it looks too crowded you get the option of walking out before paying or sucking it up and standing. Its worth it for me either way.",3,,
101,Yuliyan D.,"Quincy, MA",73,17,1,5.0,2/16/2016,Amazing drinks! Great performance from all the artists! Would definitely recommend for a date night or even when you would like to lough and relax... Don't ask for a front raw table if you can't handle it... Amazing experience love it!!!,,,

My friends and I sat at the bar, it wasn't close to close or anything but the bartender very rudely pressured my friends to order at least one drink if sitting at the bar. What if my friend was sober? Also important to mention there were PLENTY of open bar seats. The place was dead to begin with. I had ordered one drink but we were so insulted at his insisting that they pick something or leave that we left.",,,

Mon-Thurs has free admission and you don't know who you might see...",5,,
105,pamela j.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,32,22,5.0,4/18/2014,A special friend took me to this location.  FANTASTIC!   The live band was outstanding. I had a great time. The crowd was live and the band played from pop to reggae.  I strongly recommend this underground spot. There is also karaoke on the upper level.  Lots of space.  Open till 4am. That's what's up.,2,,
106,Chris B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,15,0,4.0,7/27/2014,"I came here with a group of people last Saturday night.  I have to admit that seeing live bands and dancing isn't my thing (I'm much more of a dive bar guy), so I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of fun I had dancing to a band that seemed to know exactly what I wanted to listen to.  The beers weren't too expensive (about $7), which helped fuel some of the fun as well.It was $12 to get into seeing the band -- it was totally worth it.  Honestly, I don't know how often I would go to this place, but I wish I had discovered it earlier during my time in New York.",1,,
107,Tonya R.,"Inglewood, CA",276,147,47,3.0,10/7/2013,"Went last night for their legendary open Mic night. First thing MAKE RESERVATIONS! I had reservations but tried to bring extra and the guy at the front was a total jerk about letting them in with us. Ended up speaking to someone over him and getting them in with no issues.  If you don't bring enough people to fill up a both or table you will be sharing with a random couple or group.Its open Mic night so anyone can hop on stage. its hit or miss. There was a washed up singers collective there so we had to site though all 5 of them performing individuals but as back up to one another. I was ver that after their 3rd person. There were a few great performers as well as the host is amazing. I'd go for the host.Food was ehhhh. Considering theres a $15 dollar cover Id like more generous drink and food portions and options. I had the Calamari which was okay, not the best. My boyfriend had the Fire Island martini which was delicious, I'd order that again. Will be back just not sure when.",4,,1
108,Elliot L.,"Queens, NY",412,216,204,4.0,2/27/2016,This place is a gem . The live music is awesome . The cover band really puts on a good show . There's a cover charge but it's worth it .

110,Chantel H.,"Brooklyn, NY",407,169,122,4.0,9/4/2013,"So I've been here a few times and each time it's been a pleasurable experience.I usually go on open mic night (I guess that's what they call) when Cheryl Pepsii Riley host. She's very entertaining and keeps the show running smoothly.This is the perfect spot for date night, girls night out, poetry junkies (like myself) and live band fanatics.If you can't attend the show, they have live web viewings (yesssss, now I can watch Monday night open mics while in my pjs!)The drinks are OK, nothing special.The atmosphere is very laid back and trendy.Parking sucks unless you park in one of the parking garages or just practice patience (not gonna happen!) and wait for someone to move their car.Overall: Cool spot, will return soon!",4,2,1

112,Chirag G.,"Manhattan, NY",251,43,7,5.0,5/4/2013,"I was here for a friend's birthday last night and had a blast! A bit skeptical about paying a $10 cover on a Friday night but it was worth every penny.  Amanda Brown  blew up the stage (YouTube her, she was on the show The Voice) as did the other singers.  During the moments when the band was on a break, the music was really a nice mixture of 90's, R&B, and pop.  Also, the crowd was so diverse! It was the epitome of what it means to be in New York City: combining people of all ages and races to enjoy phenomenal live music.  Don't hesitate to come.",13,,2
113,Roy B.,"Huntington, NY",396,472,325,4.0,4/30/2013,On Saturday Night our party of four went to the Village underground to catch the comedy--- and they delivered!!!!  Almost al of the comedians were from some TV show you've heard of and they were fhilarious!  I can't remember the last time I cried while laughing so hard. Two drink minimum and $20 for the show and it was all worth it for a really funny time out on a perfect spring night in the village. I'd recommend it highly and will be back myself for more soon.,8,5,7

115,Lvl B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,4,4.0,1/4/2013,"I LOVE This place!!It is great for a group of friends. I am not the clubbing type, but I love lounges and live music- this is the perfect in between.They have booths that face the stage. You can order a drink and some bar food and relax and enjoy the show, or get up and dance to your favorite tune.Cost: I usually go on Friday's which is $10 to get in and two drink minimum. Some may say its pretty steep, but once the music is going you'll forget all about it. Drinks/Food:The drinks are great. Try their signature martinis (only two allowed). My friend and I tried three one night and seen why they only allow two. The food is regular bar food which is OK.Band: DOPE DOPE DOPE. Amanda from the Voice performs with the band and she Killlllssss it honey chall. Cheryl Pepsi Riley comes to sing from time and to time and kills it as well. Really all the band members do their part to put on a great show. Sometimes their version of a song is better than the original! I have been here a lot and I have seen everyone from Wycleff and John Mayer come to rock out with the band. The only thing I find annoying is the reservations. if your doing it online, make sure to call and confirm. There were times I come with a group and they don't have my information and I have to sit in nose bleeds land (and that's no fun). P.S. if you get tired of the band, head right upstairs to Fat Black Pussycat. They have great music and nice decor.",,,

My wife and I were able to get a corner lounge seat to the left of the stage and it was perfect. The host was funny and entertaining. It was my wife's birthday and he sung happy birthday to her... That was really special. The band and talent was amazing! Music from the 90s and back. The only bad thing about that night was hearing the Sunday show will not be there for very long. So i am planning to go back soon before they move. Overall this place is excellent and is the perfect spot for dates, birthdays, or just a night on the town.",1,,
118,K.R. R.,"Jamaica, NY",3,18,17,4.0,5/12/2014,"I came here with my boyfriend for my 22nd birthday, and had some good laughs!My issues were...1. We had a reservation, and showed up literally 2 minutes late and had to wait in line to 'see if they had space left.' -_- Um, it's not that serious, but I mean we got in less than 15 minutes afterwards which is what matters, but did not like that I was told I had to wait without knowing if they would have enough space. If you come here make sure to arrive EARLY! They recommend 15 minutes. 2. Due to our ""lateness"" we got sat all the way in back in these super long booths that we had to share with two other parties, which I suppose is our fault for not arriving early, but just definitely not a fan of the whole set up. I can understand them trying to make the most of their space, but I did not enjoy having to share the seating, it was awkward, and tight, and had to yell over the other people for my waitress to hear what I wanted to order. 3. Service was not great, but the place was so packed I guess I can understand it, it took my waitress to walk by at least 6 times before she noticed that I was trying to get her attention. Which could also be because we were sat all the way against the wall.4. We decided to order their pitcher of sangria, which was listed on the menu for 8 people lol. My boyfriend and I had about 4 cups each, and just barely got a buzz on. Welp. LONG STORY SHORT: If you come out for their comedy show make sure to come early so you don't get shitty seating, or shitty service. And if you get the sangria, definitely ask them to make it strong! Other than that, you're in for some good laughs!",,1,

But nevertheless, I'm definitely coming back here!!!",,,

Their main lounge is very crowded, with a 2-drinks minimum per person requirement to get a table. They also have a downstairs section that acts as the dance floor. It had a $15 cover, and was absolutely poppin'. My night was a blur, so I can't offer too many useful comments, but the live music was extremely fun. The lead singer, with his 2 backup singers/dancers, really got everyone involved. While I may not remember much, I know I had a great, fun-filled night.",5,,2

It was a full house so we danced in place most of the night but no one minded and almost everyone did the same. I will say if you want to have a conversation with anyone, the music is VERY loud, so prepare to dance but not speak. Also, it takes a while to get drinks at the bar.If you're lucky (which we weren't) you may have a Prince and his entourage sighting. He is known to frequent this nightclub.",,,1

I loved the house band and all the songs they covered. I'm usually the awkward, shy person at shows like these, sitting down and just sipping my drink. However, this place and the band had me bopping my head and moving up and down my seat. This is THE place to go if you feel like dancing up a storm and singing along to covers of Prince, Lauryn Hill, and so forth.There is a two drink minimum! That may not attract those looking to save money since drinks are pricey, but having seen the martini selection I think I had about three or four.",2,2,3
126,J T.,"Manhattan, NY",341,216,12,4.0,3/24/2013,"Great place to have fun with friends and live music.  Cover bands did a great job keeping the crowd entertained!  At least on the night I went it was a mix of Hip Hop, R&B, and some classic 80's music.  Talented group of performers!Only thing I would say is that the place gets extremely crowded and it's not exactly a huge place to begin with.  Music was at times a little too loud to the point you'd have to use sign language or morse code to communicate with your friend sitting a foot away from you.  Regardless, I had a great time here!",2,,2
127,Naa Ama M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,14,0,5.0,11/30/2012,"YES amazing wings like everyone says. I took a friend and we were in LOVE The band works so well together people change in and out, its great everyone is on such a cool vibe what a relief. LOVE the music you. On this night we were graced by Chrisette Michelle who BLEW it up. I remember pinching myself like am I really here, me and my friend looked at each other like OMG for 10.00 worth every minute of it. Monifah was there too she was so great and amazing to see how laid back they were.",4,,2
128,S C.,"East Hanover, NJ",21,391,46,5.0,3/8/2015,Came to the 9:15pm show Saturday night and it was fantastic! One of the comedians was super funny and has us cracking up during his entire segment. $20 cover charge and two purchase minimum on food/drinks which were just ok. Would definitely return here again.,1,,1
129,Liv K.,"West Newton, MA",2,73,0,5.0,7/17/2016,"We went to the 11:15 p.m. show on a Saturday night. We went with another couple, and had made a reservation earlier in the day on Saturday. We arrived at around 10:30 to check in, and we're very nicely greeted by the door staff. We then took a walk around the neighborhood, and returned closer to the start of the show. After waiting for the staff to clear out the prior show attendees, we went downstairs and were seated at a table very close to the stage. I believe that all four of us had an absolutely amazing time listening to 5 very funny comedians, some more famous than others, and enjoying some reasonably priced drinks. The service was quick and efficient, and did not interfere with our experience. The Comedians were all working very hard to make us laugh, and succeeded! Some people have complained that this location is unfriendly or expensive, I did not experience anything remotely unfriendly, and as to the expense you are a New York city so you have to manage your expectations.",,,
130,Caroll W.,"New York, NY",278,35,43,1.0,3/2/2013,1 star cause I have too. Walked in tonight with a group of 10 half and half. We had a table reserved got there at 945 we were suppose to be there by 930 and in by 10. I text the host to let get know we were going to be late. Our table was given away but WAIT there was a table for ten open yahoooo. The twist was that the owner tells us that since we were late we lost our table but the table open was free he says it is for my friends.So let me get this straight I amComing in with 10 people about to spend over 1000 in your club and you can't give us a table? Ok needless to say we walked out with our hard earned money.Oh yeah the band was horrible the girls sounded like they snorted an 8 ball and the guy was talking all the lyrics. Which I can do at home,2,1,
131,Jane L.,"New York, NY",96,25,10,4.0,12/17/2012,"ABSOLUTELY AMA~ZING BAND!!! I went there on a Friday. I had a little trouble finding the place because I'm clueless with directions but it's right across the Blue Note on W 3rd Street... Two entrances: left side is the live band and the right side is the bar (which I didn't check out yet) Butto speak for the house band.... I was BLOWN AWAY! There were about a dozen people on stage singing all kinds of genre from rock n roll, r&b, tango, to broadway... and some traditional jewish songs occasionally (i think they sang it because it was hanukkah)..  I heard from my friends that Amanda Brown from the Voice Season 3 used to lead there and will be performing this coming Thursday. I would def go if I wasn't getting my wisdom teeth pulled out... What I'm trying to say is they are mad talented and funny!!There is a $10 cover for housebands - but it takes all the poor college kids away (no offense, I was one too). The crowd is mid 20s to early 40s I would say... Service is 3.5/5, food was 3/5, drinks were 4/5, and the atmosphere was 5/5... so 4/5.It's great for a group of friends to go get a table, with some munchies and plenty of drinks and enjoy! They also have a small dancing area right in front of the stage. Def a must go!!",2,,2
132,Sid W.,"San Diego, CA",2,184,0,2.0,9/6/2013,"Well, for a $10 cover, they could have treated us better. Offering us a dark corner table while saving the cozy ones for others didn't agree with us. The live band they had turned out to be Meh, we should have given it more thought before entering. The 2 minimum drink policy for a table was fine, but it was kinda expensive for a west village place. Service was okay, we had to wait quite to bit to catch attention of the servers.",,,
133,Melia P.,"Bronx, NY",237,285,332,4.0,12/6/2012,I went on a Sunday night which is an open gospel/RnB Soul night. The band is amazing! A few artist went up and played some of their music and the band immediately began to play with there. The host is extremely entertaining; he has a great voice and sense of humor. I would recommend for a date or a small group gathering. My friends make reservations for table and there is a 2 item minimum. The menu is typical bar food and the wait service kind of sucks.,2,,1
134,Cheree A.,"Bronx, NY",61,13,0,4.0,2/17/2013,"Yess I am a fan!! Been here twice and shall go back many more times!! Good price to get in, great when you have reservations, which I had the 2 times i've been there. The DJ is live!!! The band is sooo talented and a crowd pleaser!! A whole range of genres played, good mixed crowd. Drinks are good!!The only reason why I didnt rate this spot 5 stars is because of how crowded this place gets. This place is well spaced, plenty of seats and a dance floor. But towards the middle of the night, its a struggle to get to the bathroom. Not much space to dance...or walk anywhere..even for the waiters.I went of a friday night. And Saturday, 2 nights ago on 2/16/13. I had a blast!! Went with a group of 4. I danced w/ my Lady. They do have coat check. My only con is the place gets extremely crowded. other than that...this place is the BOMB!!!The bathrooms are lovely, very structured, their is a worker in there who turns on the water, put soap in your hand & hands you paper towel to dry. Lotions are also available for use. & they shouted out February birthdays...said my name & age!! That was fun!!",1,,2
135,Kimberly M.,"Hoboken, NJ",144,290,9,2.0,8/4/2013,"I could have done without the $15 cover considering it was Saturday night and the ""band"" totally sucked.  Otherwise, seems to be one of the less crowded and chaotic spots in that area.  Possibly a cool place when they get the music right.",,,
136,Anika Z.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",239,4,299,4.0,4/13/2012,"I'm giving this place 4 stars just based on their awesome live music. We were there on a chilly Friday night for someone's birthday party. Well we just used that excuse to check this place out for the first time and I'm glad we did. The ambience of this place can be divided into two. Upstairs, it is well lit and everyone is everywhere--walking, talking, drinking, sitting down (or making out). A few looked bored. Maybe it was the drinks or the lack of it in their system.Downstairs, it is darker, but really upbeat. There is food and drinks, and there is live music. I was amazed by each and every musician's talent that night. They were phenomenal in their own ways. No matter who you take with you: a friend, a date, or that creepily hot neighbor of yours, you are bound to have a great time.So grab someone and go. You won't be disappointed.",13,8,10

We was deep, rollin in a limo, feelin like we on top of da world LOL Came out to a night i wont forget.The vibe was hella kool, laid back, dark lighting, live music, good drinks & food. Everyone came for a good time, no BS no drama. Grown folks type of spot.Matter of fact we got lucky there was some people from the music biz in the house that night. Kelly Price, Michelle Williams (Destiny's Child), a few producers (forgot who, kinda faded, LOL), and some upcoming amateur talents who put it down. Plus it was my homie's 30th bday, so we was doin it real big!The host was an old skool type of kat, had jokes, sang pretty good too.He made sure everyone was showin love.... no hatin allowed.I will hit this spot up again on future trips to NY.",4,6,5
138,Allen Y.,"Manhattan, NY",94,361,1,5.0,9/28/2012,"Looked up this place on Yelp and went in purely because of the high rating. Definitely a great place. Things we liked about it, in general order of significance:-AMAZING wings. Seriously, some of the tastiest wings I've ever had.-Decent size = no wait on a Thursday night.-Long martini list; our favorites were the French and the Fire Island Iced Tea-Cool ambiance (lounge feel) with pretty good music (but it's pretty loud)-Very nice service-Decent prices: every item we got (drinks, wings) was ~$10.",2,,1
139,Camille W.,"Hackensack, NJ",130,50,35,5.0,12/19/2014,This may be one of my favorite places to go in the city. The village underground band has found true talent to entertain and please the audience all night long. I have was so impressed my first time coming here and lovrd it even more the second time. You will not be disappointed if you enjoy watching or dancing to live music. I wish all members the best with thejr careers.,1,,

142,Chris T.,"Missouri City, TX",16,122,30,5.0,5/20/2014,Where to begin.... my experience at Village underground was Amazing! We were there for Sunday open mic night.They suggest you arrive by 9:15 for your reservation. I arrived 5 mins late and was nervous that we wouldnt get a seat. We were able to get a seat in a back booth that still had good views of the stage. The booths in back are long and you will have to share with other parties. We were a party of 3 and were paired with another party of 3. The others were cool & funny so it was a good time. By 9:30 the booths were full so i suggest arriving early! Chicken wings were good. Fries were plain (I wish they had seasoned fries). The berry martini was gross (cough syrup?) The green apple martini was good and gave me a lil buzz.The music is what's important right? The band is phenomenal!! I loved grooving with the band and they seemed so happy doing what they do. The singers were all outstanding. I was intimidated by the voices in this place. How do they find this much talent! They do two sets with a break in between. During the break the host walked around to chat it up at each table. I appreciated this. We felt very welcomed. Overall we all enjoyed the night. We would definitely return and recommend!,3,,1
143,Amy W.,"Edison, NJ",19,25,0,5.0,9/8/2014,Love this place. Don't be put off by the $10 cover and drink minimum - the band is excellent and plays a wide range of genres. $10 to hear the vocal bliss of Sasha Allen and Amanda Brown is a straight-up steal. Both those beautiful ladies can sing like nobody's business. I wish I came here more often.,1,,2
144,Ana S.,"Boca Raton, FL",5,5,0,5.0,12/29/2014,"We bumped into this place by accident. On mondays they have ""BlackVelvetMonday"" which is an open mic / R&B band that kills it.  What an amazing experience, highly recommended. Recomendation: Dont be cheap! The cover (12$) is totally worth it. Culture, music, food, drinks, what else do you want?",,,1
145,Keith L.,"Seattle, WA",280,171,41,3.0,4/1/2013,"I recently went to The Comedy Cellar at the Village Underground - the larger space around the corner from the Cellar - and had an amazing time. The lineup was hilarious (as usual), and the space was massively spacious. I think it was the first comedy club where I didn't have to sit on a stranger's lap (not that there's anything wrong with that). Our group of 8 was actually given a reserved lounge area right next to the stage.The staff was great and the drinks were moderately priced - about $7 for a Bud Light.Definitely a good alternative to the usual comedy joints in the City.",,,

149,Helen L.,"Queens, NY",1122,690,1175,1.0,9/27/2011,"Honestly, I was about to give this place FIVE stars. I had a blast!!!But, I won't hesitate to put a place on blast for shadienss!Rules to follow if you decide to come here:* DEMAND for an itemized bill!* If you open multiple tabs at one table, DEMAND itemized bills for every tab!* If you pay in cash, DEMAND for proof of payment (somehow)!* Compare your itemized receipts against each other's before you leave your table!* Save your receipts and don't dispose until you match it up to your credit card statement!THEY ""DO"" DOUBLE CHARGE WHEN THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT!!!(Skip to the last two paragraphs for details.)A ten buck cover is not much to ask for a live band. The band wasn't spectacular, but they were good and they were fun! They covered a wide range of genres and they did get me to dance. Amanda Brown...mesmerizing! Rahj also stood out for me...he sang, he beatboxed, he rocked it!I was there with a friend for her birthday. She reserved a large booth where we all fit comfortably, even as our group grew. My birthday friend did get a lil' wasted, but the rest of us were fine. She had given our server her card at the beginning of the night. Some of us paid in cash directly to our server, Giovanni (young, attractive male server, possibly Latin or mixed ethnicity). Some of us had our own tabs. ALL of us knew exactly what we ordered! The next morning, my birthday friend (who BTW is very, very, very meticulous when it comes to accounting) realized some drinks that were already paid for were kept on her tab. Of course, she emailed the club. First, she was told we may have been too drunk to know what we ordered and that no one paid in cash. Then (in a later conversation with someone else) she was told that Giovanni suddenly remembered one cash payment, but nothing else. Long-story-short, the club only refunded her $30 and a free entry for her next visit. The $30 was all they could account for during their ""research"". The fact that any discrepancy could be found shows that shady practices were in place and had we not mentioned anything, they would have gotten away with it! Whether this shadiness is standard practice of the club or just the server, I don't know.My other friend was the one who closed the tab, both for herself and the birthday girl. She failed to demand for an itemized bill for herself, but she did demand for an itemized bill for the birthday girl (knowing how anal she was about accounting). Yes, she had to demand for an itemized bill, as our server only wanted to give us a credit card receipt showing only the total. The others at our table also failed to demand for an itemized bill...and that's how the club could ONLY account for $30 worth of discrepancies. BEWARE!!!!!",34,10,9

In reading the reviews, I called in to make a reservation as was recommended. Our party of 4 arrived shortly after the house band came on, and we were promptly seated with another couple front and center. The house band was very entertaining, and played many genres of music. We enjoyed their set and their jokes and stage pranks. The drinks were on the pricey side, but worth it when all as said and done! I would recommend a visit and I would go back to drink and dance there again. The $12 cover and two drink minimum are well worth it. I totally agree with the 4 star rating also!",1,,

At $25 per pitcher (7-8 drinks per pticher) it was delicious! The service was fast and great. The music: it was a mix btwn a DJ and a band but the band was AWESOME!!!!!!!!  They were so good.

It was my birthday and we were there with 8 friends.  The show was great but the staff was very unprofessionally. Apparently you can not have your phone out .. which I get and respect. However there were no signs and no one let us know. I am sure they get this all the time and are annoyed with ppl being on their phone when you should enjoy the show.. Totally get it. I was trying to coordinate some friends that night during the show , so i kept looking at it. The staff kept yelling at me and at the  end show of the made the doorman come up to our table. I offered him to look at my phone since I didnt record anything but it was just like a show off. Then the manager came up to us and completely flipped out.. I have worked as a server and bartender but one thing I have leaned always approach someone in a nice way. Don't come up to my group and yell and make this a big deal. I am sorry if the manager had a bad day and the staff but have you ever heard of customer service? I don't think so. All of them handled the situation so unprofessional and that was the most disappointing part. Never again would i go back. I never write bad reviews but this one is deserved. I am sorry..

Some lady asks me if I have taken salsa classes before! No ma'am!

The musicians and singers were very talented. They played all types of music from hip-hop to soul to rock from the 60s to the 2000s. The crowd was very diverse and the best part is that you can freely dance up front or anywhere else in the place. They even had a belly dancer. I highly recommend.

If we are in a agreement and no one on the table is complaining why make us uncomfortable? Well the whole point was for the bill to be split up a certain way. MIND YOU they sat another party of 2 to make it 10 while there was seating on both tables aside from ours. Smh... Adding to frustration the Hostess was very rude and did not want to hear anything any of us had to say. I tried asking her a question about the seating to learn more about there system and she kept saying "" THIS IS MY CLUB... MY RULES!""

Anywho, many legendary guests have graced the stage including Chaka Khan, Patti Labelle, and the elusive Prince.  The night I was here, R&B newcomer Chrisette Michele performed an impromptu number.

172,Donna A.,"Brooklyn, NY",338,486,212,4.0,2/1/2013,Amazing cover band!  From ABBA to Jay-Z.  Why did I just discover that they have amazing wings?  Can't wait to try them.,2,,3
173,Augusto L.,"Oakland, CA",188,107,16,4.0,11/29/2010,"Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, dance!!!!Yes, this place is awesome for dancing! I'm not sure if my first sentence clearly conveyed that.The music delivered by the live band surges through you like a cocaine binge (I wouldn't know personally but so I have heard - GULP)! The rappers and singers are intoxicating and possess an amazing talent! The drinks leave something to be desired by the palette.  The sangria was not bad and their martini's were ok. The prices are a bit steep but I guess I am willing to pay for it since the musical talent is so frickin' amazing!!!The staff was helpful and quick. The club is spacey in regards to sitting but as for dancing, it could use another floor or two. How do patrons resist dancing?!?! The music that the band pumps out is energizing!!!The lighting is dim but not to the point where you cannot see who you are dancing with! That could be no bueno at the end of the night!!! GuLp!I came here one time and fell in love with it. When people ask me what I loved most about NYC, The Village Undergound is one of those things that I must mention!",2,2,3

175,Deniz B.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,7/8/2015,Who works with this place is totally awefulll! Be carefull about your bill! They try to charge twice more than what you actually drink. I have to pay 35 dollars for 2 cin and tonicks tonight.Because they have no idea about their real checks.Musicians are ok but it dosen't worth it!This is the first comment on yelp for me.imagine how much I Annoyed!,,,
176,Da D.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,5,7,3.0,2/16/2014,Really cool place to hang out. Went there with a friend on a weekend night. A live band was playing pretty good music. Didnt order any food but the drinks were awesome.,,,
177,Arthur A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,14,0,4.0,6/7/2012,"If you haven't read it already, the house band is something else. Will they be world famous? No. Will they make it onto a late night talk show? Nope. But here's what will happen. At some point in the night you will end up:1. raising your drink in the air (spilling about two sips worth of alcohol down your sleeve) look directly at the singer, drummer, or guitar player, nod your head and slowly yell ""yyyyeeeaaaahhh"".2. start dancing like you're in your  friend's living room when your pre-gaming has gone too far3. men will start dancing with a stranger on a strictly platonic level4. women will dance without hating on the other women5. at some point you will randomly remember that this is really effing loudThat's about all I can say. The vibe that I got was that this place is focused on you having a good time. If you manage to meet somebody that you didn't come in with then good for you. If you leave with them then hey, do your thing. But if that's what you came here for then you're probably going to miss out on what carefree fun is all about. Why not 5 stars? cover charge and drink prices. But the atmosphere will cancel these things out. You wont be running back and forth to the bar when you're on the dance floor, but its still a factor. Surprise..... I wont be back soon. I'm afraid that if I make this a regular go to spot then I'll become spoiled. You don't have steak or lobster for dinner every night.",7,7,4
178,J S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0,5.0,1/2/2013,"My favorite place in NYC -- been coming here for eight years. Talented, funny, entertaining, versatile and well-rounded band, knows how to work the crowd and get everyone dancing. It's small and intimate, the staff are wonderful and welcoming. It's the one place I feel confident introducing to new people, because it is consistently the most fun night out. Lots of locals and a mixed crowd in terms of age, ethnicity, sexual orientation. It's unpretentious, and you can go casual or dress up. No matter who you are, bring a smile and you will fit right in.Great spot for anyone who loves music and/or dancing. And you can get a table so your tired dancing feet can rest! A+",2,,
179,Millbrae R.,"Millbrae, CA",0,11,0,1.0,7/11/2015,"Went there on Wednesday July 8th. The entertainment was great. Unfortunately we left after a half hour due to whomever was the bartender that night. Serving garbage for drinks at a high price is the fastest way to see a place empty. Drinks are expensive and that's OK if you make a good drink. But when you can't even taste alcohol, screw that. I sent mine back the first time and they added a splash. Did it again the second time I ordered a drink and we walked out. Maybe that's why your place empties?????",,,
180,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",45,548,18,4.0,4/18/2013,"They do Comedy Cellar shows here now too. Not sure the schedule but Comedy Cellar is one of (if not the) best standup in nyc (and hence the world, imo).  This place smells a bit like wet feet tho. Someone needs to seriously change their socks more frequently instead of rewearing yesterday's pair.",,1,1
181,Sandy C.,"San Francisco, CA",1244,429,2059,4.0,3/29/2010,"It's another New York City moment when you get a text from a friend to meet you up with you. Our cell phones have become modern tracking devices to connect with friends.....""Where you at?"" ""What are your coordinates?"" ""How long you gonna be there?"" ""Who you with?"" ""Come thru."" I get the text, ""We're at Village Underground. We have a booth by the bottom of the stairs.  Come through."" There's a $5.00 cover, but no table minimums. No table minimums in New York? I love it. The drinks and food are CHEAP! I bought a round of 6 drinks for $30! The service is impeccable. No attitude, no bs.  If you love music, you'll love this spot.  The Village Underground located in Greenwich Village used to be the basement of ""Gerdes' Folk City"" in the 60's where greats like Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel, John Lee Hooker used to play regularly in the 60's. Today, it's an eclectic live music venue that hosts bands and open mic nights where you will be blown away at the amateur talent that graces the stage. This culture in this place is amazing. Here's a sample of what you can expect from the Village Underground: youtube.com/watch?v=daCZ… Truly a great find for live music. Full band, and you can sign up to sing, but beware the talent is fierce! The people who sing here will blow you away. We went upstairs for a drink at the upstairs bar, and my friend turns to me and says, this is where the karaoke bar for the people who can't sing. But there was a group of girls singing better than I could in my dreams. I loved the Village Underground. I can't wait to go back again. FYI. If you sign up on their email list on the website you get a free round of drinks!",9,4,5
182,Al L.,"Toronto, Canada",987,856,1076,4.0,7/21/2013,Its just as good as the original Comedy Cellar with better seating and cheaper prices.,,,
183,Richard S.,"Mountain View, CA",2,15,2,5.0,10/21/2011,"The band on Saturday night is amazing and gets the whole place moving. Along with hours of great live performance, including Latino salsa, late 70s funk, R&B, and great rapping, they did a live cover of 'Jump', and that song is so much better live, and these singers knew the whole rap. The band was full of talented musicians: a great guitarist, a funky bass player, a cool drummer, and a great keyboardist.I love dancing, and the drinks there were $11 each, but you only needed a couple to get the blood pumping. 2/3 of my table was $133 including service, plus $60 for the covers ($15 each that night), so in total we had an amazing night in NYC, right next to the subway, for roughly $48.25 per head. We ordered several baskets of onion rings, mozzarella sticks, and lots of cocktails. Considering how much fun it was, and how memorable that birthday party will be for all of us, it was a great deal! I highly recommend it!",,,
184,Garrett P.,"Anchorage, AK",3,140,0,2.0,7/7/2011,"The band and live music are worth a 5.$21 for an Amstel Light and a Bud are worth a 1.So, I'll settle on 2. Even though it could be 3 since there is no cover charge.",,,
185,Jessica S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,45,8,1.0,2/7/2015,Not funny comedians. They all talked about shitting the entire night. Horrible drinks to accompany the cold favorless fries. Hopefully the real comedy cellar is still funny because this place sucks,,1,
186,Iliana P.,"Los Angeles, CA",444,94,49,5.0,4/3/2010,"I think I may just give NY a chance and not move back to Cali solely because the Village Underground is so amazing! I've been here twice already and I cannot get enough of their music. The band plays any type of music including hop-hop, funk, R&B, alternative, classic rock and event salsa and cumbia! There are about 10 members that alternate every night and every one of them is incredibly talented. I guarantee that you will not stop bobbing your head the entire night and you will not be able to stay on your seat. There is no cover charger before 10:30 and only $5 after, but there is a 2 drink minimum regardless. The drinks are about $10 each, but if you get a pitcher of sangria for $27 you're good for 2 people. The sangria is not the greatest so you may just want to pay extra for their very tasty martinis.",5,,2
187,Sharee R.,"Berkeley, CA",107,160,0,4.0,8/3/2011,"The band was awesome! I'm usually not a fan of live bands that cover shitty outdated pop songs, but they made it work - and how!The only problem I had with the place was the price for the drinks. I guess this is Manhattan, but I really wish the drinks weren't so expensive. HOWEVER, the drinks were made pretty strong. I had a Devil's Tale. It was tasty.",,,
188,David L.,"Manhattan, NY",77,38,79,4.0,6/9/2013,"Rahj and the Mash are the bomb on Sat. nights. They are a must see. Fun for all!  The crazy thing was that they were playing stag films(fifty nudy films). But it added to the vibe of the place. My wife and I had a blast and my friends and family were parting like rock stars in the place. awesome night. If your in town on sat. you got to go. Drinks aren't a deal and cover is $15 so go with some cash or just drink before you get there, but get there.",,,

191,Ken V.,"Jersey City, NJ",31,36,124,4.0,1/7/2011,"I went to The Village Underground for their live music last Dec 30th. It was a Thursday, no cover charge before 11pm ($5 after 11pm). It may not be an ordinary Thursday since it's a holiday the following day. There's about 9 of us and we got couch and tables few minutes after our arrival (we got there about 9:30pm).We didnt reserve a table because no one likes the idea of putting a credit card in to run a single tab, which is required.The band was AWESOME! It was first time for all 9 of us and my friends liked the band as well.The only downside was, there were a lot of people for the servers to attend to. We got our 1st round of beers at least 15 minutes after ordering it. Boy everyone was really thirsty! It took another 15 minutes or so to get our 2nd round + the wait time for the server to get our orders.Tip: sign-up in their mailing list online, and get a free drink! Go to thevillageunderground.comWill definitely go back and bring other friends.",,1,
192,Nikki H.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,271,223,5.0,11/29/2010,This place is amazing. I went a few weeks ago to the Sunday night Open Mic and there was an abundant amount of talent there. Melonie Daniels is amazing and her vocal range is sickkkkk (in a good way),,,1

All of my friends had a great time and the band is so good. I liked the diverse music and I think all of the seats were pretty good. The drinks are about 10 each which is reasonably priced for Manhattan and they are tasty. I recommend the cherry bomb and lip smacker if you like sweet drinks that get the job done. The food was very good! Overall, great experience and I will def be going back. Totally worth the $10 cover charge.",,,1
198,Samantha L.,"Forest Hills, NY",60,75,2,4.0,12/6/2011,"How did I forget to review this place?!?!I went here at the suggestion of my friends parents (don't worry, they cool) over the summer with a few friends, and we had an awesome time! There was a small cover (something like $5-10 I think) to go downstairs for the live band, and they were pretty freakin' sweet. Drinks were pricey, but it's to be expected in the city. The only gripe we had about this place was after waltzing around and bar hopping all night in pumps, the bouncer told us there was a two drink minimum to get a table. After two drinks, he wouldn't let us sit because of some horse bukkake reason that we couldn't hear because the band was just rockin' out, but hey, as someone else mentioned- get a receipt. Apparently your wallet, and in our case, feet- will be very thankful. Do check it out, we all need to hit a few shady bars in our youth so we can tell our grand children good stories, right?",3,1,3
199,Chris K.,"Chelmsford, MA",0,6,0,3.0,7/2/2013,"Went here for a comedy cellar show. The comedians were great but the food wasn't great and there was a very limited choice on beer which i found surprising when you have a bar upstairs. We also had an issue when we left. They apparently request you to bring your receipt to show at the door before you leave, no one told the customers as several people had to be turned around to get their receipts. It was done in a rude way and would have been avoided if they told the customers of the policy. Go for the comedians not for the drinks or food.",,,
