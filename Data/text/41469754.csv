The place is amazing to what and capture or enjoy some time with your loved ones at this place. You can actually see the entire Manhattan skyline from this place. The one tower, the Empire State Building and everything else. Beautiful place to visit",,,
1,Sanjay G.,"Parsippany, NJ",321,385,7494,5.0,9/23/2017,"""Best spot to see New York skyline (Manhattan)... Hoboken/ Brooklyn comes after this..."" - I never leave a chance to make a visit here. Whether it's day or night...for me, I can get the best view of Manhattan from here... I am not into running thing but I can encounter 100s runner every time I make a round of boardwalk... so are the bikers and dog lovers.aah...world trade centre... see my pic for it... is there any best place to get this view.Hoboken provides you with the view of empire and WTC both but clear picture perfect view, only this place can offer.right there, there is WTC memorial and a piece of twin tower iron bar.Hyatt and other big hotels are right on the boardwalk and so are restaurants.must visit, that's all i can say..!!",2,,2
2,Jonathan T.,"Cupertino, CA",450,414,419,5.0,8/19/2017,"This place is beautifulTake the red or green PATH train from the WTC for just $2.75. It's so worth it for just one stop away.The views of the lower manhattan skyline are just amazing. Come here for sunset, or if you're crazy like me and willing to get up early in the morning after 3 hours of sleep just to get here before the sun rises.. that might be even better too.. depending on which direction the sun rises at the season you visit.",4,,2
3,Quin S.,"Manhattan, NY",114,99,388,5.0,7/8/2017,Kudos to hunny for such a great idea! I've never seen the July 4th fireworks in person til this day.  It's a big deal. Stage- performances- giveaways- fun people and Food!   The whole area is filled with excitement and great energy.  Koop & the Gang performed - the fireworks were amaze and the choices of food fulfilling. We did a Veggie Burrito and Funnel Cake- both big enough to share. Got some flashy trinkets and enjoyed the festivities. I'd do this again for sure for the water front and to explore the area more,2,,2
4,Santanu B.,"New York, NY",96,204,147,5.0,2/11/2018,"This is an awesome place to capture the view of the Manhattan skyline. The WTC, Goldman Sachs building etc. present themselves to the viewer majestically, with an aura of pride. This is the spot for tourists to grab some clicks for their memories, or for the regular folks around, to admire the beauty that's Manhattan. The Hudson River and the ferries and boats and yachts on it add to it. The water my stink. If you can ignore it, and walk along the river, you should be fine.",1,1,
5,Jeannette L.,"Jersey City, NJ",1436,781,2455,5.0,3/29/2017,"The Waterfront at Exchange Place is one of my favorite places in Jersey City. There's something about being so close to the water and looking out at the views of the Lower Manhattan. The skyline is beautiful. The boardwalk is great for walking. Locals also run and bicycle on the boardwalk. At night, sometimes skaters show up at Exchange Place, too. Along the boardwalk are benches facing the water, but there are also tables on the pier near the PATH. At the end of that same pier there is a pagoda type of structure where groups do Tai Chi and Yoga. There's also the area by the Colgate Clock. There are a few places to eat, like Potbelly and all the food trucks that set up shop during work hours Monday to Friday. Aside from the Hyatt, the rest of the buildings are offices and a few condos/apartments. Exchange Place is safer than other places in JC and you'll see people walking around all hours of the night. I think the NYC skyline looks the most beautiful at night time. Check it out!",19,13,18
6,Nez B.,"Manhattan, NY",271,239,368,5.0,10/24/2015,Beatiful view of the NYC skyline from a peaceful and clean boardwalk.Only steps from the PATH train with parking along nearby streets and nearby bars and restaurants. 911 memorial alon the boardwalk and plenty of public benches to relax on.Great for a long walk.,1,,
7,Carolyn L.,"Vancouver, Canada",125,1169,10568,4.0,7/13/2015,"I do love the view of the NYC skyline from across the Hudson River. There are plenty of benches so you can just chill there for a while. Bring your lunch/coffee and a book, or you can always people watch too. I must confess I got a bit dizzy watching the waves in the river. It is a busy river as there are ferries which will bring people over from Jersey City to Wall Street and vice versa. There is also a 9/11 memorial. It is pretty much right in front of Freedom Tower (across the river, that is).At the Exchange Place, it is a busy hive of activities with people taking the train (light rail), the PATH and buses, getting to places. The most prominent building will be Goldman Sachs and most people will know it when you mention that.",1,1,1
8,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3175,11030,4.0,7/8/2016,"You know what people say the best part of New Jersey is? The views of New York City.Now, I'm not saying I necessarily agree with that sentiment. What I am saying is that the views at Exchange Place are top notch.Between the Katyn Memorial statue is... interesting, if not a bit depressing. There's also the 9/11 plaque, so you can really take the PATH from one 9/11 memorial to another.That's about it, really.",,1,

10,Steve K.,"New York, NY",3,195,2,4.0,9/3/2015,"I live in Manhattan and I've spent my entire career working here but I recently started a new job working in Exchange Place.To be honest, I miss Manhattan but Exchange Place is not without its charms. For starters, the PATH station is clean and modern. The promenade and pier at Exchange Place are beautiful and great to walk and relax on during my lunch break.The views of Manhattan, needless to say, are gorgeous, especially at night.There are many modern towers - both residential and commercial - in the area. There is also a ton of construction and renovation of old buildings going on. You get the impression that Jersey City is moving in the right direction and in a few years the area will look much different and be much more crowded.I also noticed that, on average, many of the professionals I see working here tend to be on the younger side.Exchange Place still has a bit of a cheesy New Jersey vibe to it.  However, living or working here is not the end of the world.",1,3,2
11,L. William W.,"Springfield Gardens, Queens, NY",29,231,35,4.0,9/1/2014,"I wanted to take a picture of the new World Trade Center, but I didn't want to spend the money to go to the top of the Empire State Building or the Top of the Rock. Instead, I took PATH and the Hudson-Bergen Lightrail (PATH doesn't serve Exchange Place on weekends or holidays. Epic fail) to Exchange Place. I then walked to the waterfront. I was very impressed with the views. The new World Trade Center will never be as good as the original, but it is a sleek and svelte building. Jersey City also has a tribute for all of the Jersey City residents who lost their lives on 9/11.The area is full of office buildings. It's like a mini-Lower Manhattan. However, the tall buildings (plus scaffolding) create a bit of a shadow. I wish there was a little more green space (i.e. Union Square).",1,1,1
12,Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",858,1500,1260,5.0,5/12/2014,"I really love this place. Its a perfect place to come with good company or alone to enjoy the beautiful NYC skyline. They have plenty of seats and space so you will never feel crowded.You will see a lot of families, couples and singles just enjoying the view.",1,,1
13,Vineet S.,"Jersey City, NJ",1848,971,1636,4.0,3/1/2012,"Exchange Place located in  Downtown Jersey City offers some really nice views of NYC's skyline.I come here a couple of times in a week due to my work commitments. The neighborhood is very well connected via public transportation(Path trains,Ferry and  Light Rail). This hood is also referred to as ""Wall Street West"" due to the concentration of financial concerns which have offices there. Almost all the biggies have their offices here(Citibank, Brown Nrothers,Morgan Stanley etc).The namesake is a square of about 200 feet long at the foot of Montgomery Street at the Hudson River which was created by landfilling of the shore at Paulus Hook and has been major transportation hub since the colonial era.There are a couple of options to eat around out here. I would definitely recommend coming here late evening to enjoy the awesome view of New York's skyline.",8,1,4
14,Carl L.,"Hoboken, NJ",30,101,14,5.0,1/7/2015,"Exchange Place actually has quite a bit going for it, if you can believe it. In my mind, it has one of the best views of the World Trade Center that one can find. There's a lot of picnic tables to eat your lunch on the pier and there's the Starbucks/PNC Bank/PATH/HBLR only steps away. Here's the issue...it's freezing almost always due to the fact that you're either on the water or over the water. I'm not built for the cold, but it's a great spot in summer or fall. During lunch hour Monday-Friday on days with good weather, there's a ton of local office workers eating their lunch and enjoying their views and each other. It's a beautiful thing. Check it out if you're in the area...it's just freezing in January!",1,,1
15,Wai W.,"Waldwick, NJ",121,459,216,3.0,9/26/2013,Clean even when there is so much foot traffic.  Unfortunately escalator is still being worked on.  Perfect for where I work.,1,,
16,Davis J.,"Chicago, IL",540,426,259,3.0,7/29/2012,"Hittin up the PATH! Make sure your timing is on, or else you will be waiting. It takes you to WTC (or Newark/Penn if you go the other direction).FYI, the people watching is great here. There is also a fantastic view of Manhattan from the river here.Taxis are waiting here too.",2,2,2
17,Matthew C.,"Hoboken, NJ",153,147,124,4.0,10/8/2012,"A great area to work and it's right on the Hudson River.

There are also a few nice restaurants and bars in the area as well.",2,,1
18,Constance A.,"East Orange, NJ",147,423,757,5.0,5/24/2012,"I simply love Exchange Place. I came here for the first time on 9/11/2011. I was here to take pictures of the Tribute in Lights. The view of lower Manhattan from Exchange Place is gorgeous! I remember thinking to myself, ""this would be a great place to come here with a boyfriend."" A few months later, it came true. My then boyfriend brought me here and asked me to be his girlfriend. It was really nice. This was in January. Because of the cold weather, it was completely empty. It was just me and my guy enjoying the view ^^",3,2,1
19,Alex X.,"Wiggins, MS",1051,745,1251,5.0,3/24/2014,"Tracking back in time I found this beautiful place by the Hudson while tracking down Indian lunchtrucks right outside but not listed on Yelp cus I forgot to list them. From Exchange place it is almost as beautiful a view of Manhattan as from Brookyln except this is Jersey City. Nice to walk indoors even if it can be a busy transportation center. A few shops inside. Next time I hope to be in the warmer seasons so I can enjoy the  Manhattan view outdoors and a bit longer. I wonder if I can bring my beach chairs and an umbrella. You know I would, too! Haha",4,1,3
20,Salimah H.,"Jersey City, NJ",85,117,173,4.0,10/22/2013,"Exchange place is a stop along my daily commute these days. I appreciate the convenience of the PATH, Light Rail, & bus stops all converging on this place. It makes getting wherever you need I go fairly easy. The area and PATH station are both fairly clean, surprisingly so, given the massive amount of people that travel through here on a daily basis. It gets super cold here in the winter, due to the water and the wind. I'm looking forward to that part of my commute in a couple months.",,,
21,Hector S.,"Jersey City, NJ",17,78,79,4.0,7/21/2012,"If you can't get to the beach, its a great place just to relax, hang out, think about stuff, and enjoy the great views of NYC. Also a nice, cheap place to hang out with that special friend with lots of restaurants, and food trucks/carts to eat from.",2,,1
22,Jerett G.,"Woodmere, NY",38,350,108,4.0,8/6/2010,"This is an extremely work oriented area with office buildings and the PATH making up it's landscape. Their are minimal places to grab a bite to eat and few, if any are open on the weekends. The one great pleasure of this area is the pier which jets out into the Hudson and provides a picturesque view of downtown Manhattan. If your lucky enough to work on the promenade the view alone can make up for most of what Jersey City lacks.I give this place four stars on view alone and I recommend you pack a lunch and take advantage of the many sitting areas.",2,,
23,Elizabeth M.,"Medford, NY",23,33,0,5.0,12/26/2015,"My husband is a retiree of Goldman Sachs.  In August we received information that said that he would have to choose a new Medical/Prescription Plan.  Goldman Sachs referred us to AON Retirees Exchange and with their help he was able to choose a new affordable plan.  There was an error regarding the new premium that will take effect Jan 1, 2016.  He called the Benefits Department each week for four weeks and was repeatedly told that ""it is being worked on.""  As the end of the year approaches he was getting more and more agitated.  He called one last time this past Thursday and spoke to a young woman named Kim.  She was professional and told him that the problem was corrected and gave him the new rate.  Thank you Kim for rectifying this problem.  You are an asset to Goldman Sachs.",,,1

25,Lauren C.,"Wood-Ridge, NJ",33,88,4,5.0,11/26/2007,"Adding this area primarily so that it can supplement my  ""Best Views of the NYC Skyline"" list.  The Exchange Place is located at the foot of Montgomery Street at the Hudson River in downtown Jersey City.  According to wikipedia, it is also referred to as Wall Street West though I have never heard of anyone around here calling it that.  This is actually my favorite place to go to when I want my fill of the NYC skyline because once you walk out towards the water, you have a direct view of Manhattan.  It is amazing at night and you have a wide area to walk around and benches to sit on when you want to take a break and just enjoy the view.This makes a great place to take a date or you could be like me and take a walk down there every once in a while just to check the view out.  Be warned though, it does get crowded during times when the weather is good (summer, etc.)  This area is actually where the Exchange Place PATH station and the Hudson/Bergen Light Rail is located so it is very easy to get to for those who are looking to venture in from outside the immediate area.  It's also the location of several other places such as the Hyatt hotel, the Goldman Sachs Tower (tallest building in NJ), and Au Bon Pain for those looking to grab a coffee or hot chocolate to stay warm by the water.  Make sure you dress warmly if you venture out there during times when the weather is less than stellar.  Because you're on the water, it can get very windy and cold!Best part of it all?  Cost = FREE!Source for some of my info:  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex…",8,,2

27,Lovet O.,"Jersey City, NJ",293,592,347,5.0,7/15/2011,"Exchange place is a ""professional"" environment. This is where the Goldman Sachs building is as well as other corporate/financial buildings. Exchange place is close to the Hudson river and at night, the view is incredible. The PATH train, as well as the NJ Transit Light Rail, offer transportation here.

29,Tom M.,"Newark, NJ",388,616,358,4.0,10/7/2011,"Beautiful and scenic area of Jersey City that overlooks the Hudson and lower Manhattan. The area is home to Goldman Sachs and other financial institutions corporate offices. PATH and the light rail is here also. Nice place to relax and people watch.

30,Kira M.,"Bronx, NY",15,29,22,4.0,9/21/2012,"Exchange Place has some epic views of Lower Manhattan! On a nice summer day this is a great place to hang out with friends or family and take in the sights. The only way to get here from Manhattan is via the PATH train which you can catch from World Trade Center or from the ""Journal Square"" line which runs from 33rd-23rd-14th-9th-Christopher Streets (you'll have to switch to a WTC bound train at either Newport-Grove-Journal Square stations). During the summer months there are street fairs, music on the pier and other events during weekdays and on weekends. Food options aren't as aplenty as in Manhattan, but my favorite spots are Vu at the Hyatt (American), Sky Thai (Thai), Markers (American) & Amiya (Indian).",,,1
31,Irene F.,"Pleasantville, NY",688,1833,7,3.0,11/26/2007,"Exchange Place annoys me because we have an office there and it takes forever and a half to get to and it involves taking the PATH train, which I am most definitely not fond of. Also, when the weather sucks, Exchange Place sucks. It's a mathematical equation, I can send you the proof if need be.BUT. That being said, it is also a nice view of Manhattan when the weather is good.",4,5,1
