0,Peter K.,"White Plains, NY",118,218,168,4.0,6/29/2012,"Great place to get a quick cup of coffee. The lines move fast, the staff is professional and if you want ice cream, you can get that too!",3,,1
1,Roselyn L.,"Leesburg, VA",0,3,14,1.0,6/16/2018,"9:20, stopped to get a bagel.. maybe even a donut. All the chairs were up, stood by the register with no one in sight while I repeatedly said excuse me to no avail. I finally get a yell back, ""yeah! I'm coming!"". Then some shit talking under her breath as she approached me, I asked if the store was still open and she said yeah. I asked for a bagel.. ""we ain't got none"" how about a donut, ""not at this time, you only getting coffee"". I just said thanks but I'm good. After driving 5 hours from VA to NY, you'd think you could just get something simple.",1,,
2,Victoria V.,"Stamford, CT",10,25,6,1.0,11/6/2017,"For some reason, this Dunkin Donuts location charges more for a small iced coffee than other locations.  A small costs $3.24, when it is $2something in every other location I've gone to.  Also, the staff isn't friendly at all (the older Caucasian male named Anthony who is always there especially).  He doesn't know how to give back proper change.  The staff just kisses up to the police officers who come inside.  You don't get thanked, and I made the mistake of saying thank you only to be ignored.  This Dunkin Donuts needs training in customer relations and not ripping people off.  Terrible business; I'll go to Tuckahoe Rd. instead..",1,,
3,Kyra F.,"Yonkers, NY",0,10,2,3.0,4/24/2018,"Great place but also more expensive than other dunkins which is odd. Also there is a man who works there who is super creepy, not sure if he's the manager or an employee but either way weird",1,,
4,Kyle V.,"Grand Rapids, MI",195,523,784,2.0,8/25/2016,"Breakfast was good but the service seems rude and rushed. The store was trashed as well. The trash was over flowing inside as well as the trash out front. Trash was literally building a tower on top of the trash can. As we left, we heard the manager tell an employee to change the trash but they should never let it get to that point.",,,
5,Stefanie J.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",1,31,4,5.0,10/21/2017,"This is the only Dunkin Donuts in the area from which I will buy glazed donuts because they actually make them the right way and glaze BOTH sides of the donuts. That's how they should be made and how they have always been made since I was a kid, but so many of these Westchester franchises have gotten cheap and skimped on the glaze. You won't find skimping on the glaze upstate NY nor will you find it here. Glazed donuts are the only thing I buy consistently and the real, fully glazed ones taste SO MUCH BETTER than the half glazed cheap ones you will find elsewhere!!!",,,
6,Alan D.,"Yonkers, NY",0,40,0,2.0,3/31/2016,"I gave this place 2 stars only because the coffee is good and the staff was quick but, I buy their coffee 4 bags at a time this is the only place I have ever been to that does not give 4 bags for 29,99 (buy 3 and one free) when asked why they do not participate in this promotion the cashier stated that we never do. Can I dare to say rip-off why rip-off your customers at this location does the owner need the money that bad.please folks hit'em where it hurts just go some where else I will.   REVOLUTION",,,
7,Lovy E.,"Yonkers, NY",9,46,7,2.0,4/12/2016,I've been coming to this dunkin donuts for as long as I can remember and I have never had any issue with their staff until today. JayR is rude and has extremely poor customer service skills. It is tasteless as an employee to argue or go back and forth with a customer. I suggest the manager throughly inform his employees that when they aren't used to a customer getting served in a particular way that the customer is accustomed to; don't take it up with the customer. Instead take your concerns up with management. I defitenly won't be coming here where I see JayR behind the register a complete turn off!,,,
8,Carmen O.,"Manhattan, NY",110,285,77,2.0,5/26/2015,Wow this place is insanely slow. There wasn't even a long line and still I had to remind them I still didn't have my order.,1,1,1
9,Katie H.,"Bronx, New York, NY",1,10,4,1.0,8/14/2015,I have now tried going here 3 separate occasions recently and on all 3 they have been closed before they were supposed to. I've even tried calling before going both the last time and the third and they won't even answer the phone. I find their lack of professional courtesy to be very disrespectful to would be customers.,,,
