0,,7/27/2018,200,,"Manhattan, NY",Lyndsey R.,54,4.0,23,"Not sure why Bocado has 3 stars. The quality of food is excellent and everything I've had in the cafe and/or gotten delivered has been great. I've chosen to give it 4 stars due to the most recent delivery - my fries came pretty overwhelmingly soggy. Some sogginess is to be expected, Bc it's delivery and it's summer, but this was almost to the point where I couldn't eat even one. However - the turkey club was ON POINT.

2,,6/9/2018,11,,"New York, NY",Camille V.,1,5.0,10,"Probably one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in NYC. My sister picked out this place for a family dinner after we had spent hours walking around the Met. I was already entranced by the warm Christmas lights and hip/rustic yet sleek ceiling lighting fixture that caught my eye from a block away. The place is very clean and has an intimate yet casual feel to it. It was moderately busy, pretty expected for a Saturday evening in the Upper East Side, but my family and I had such an excellent time.Our food order was taken promptly by such a genuinely kind and friendly waiter. He was tall and very sweet. Our food was brought out with perfect timing from appetizer to entrees and there were no errors. I noticed that the wait staff to customer ratio was very appropriate and the staff were all helping one another throughout the hour or two we were there for.The food itself was amazing and they have some unique items on the menu. I wanted to try everything! I ended up having the lamb burger which had some greek yogurt dressing on it. I also love how they plated the fries in a mini frying basket. Plating was well done and the food was all delicious. They have great desserts too - especially the cheesecake and chocolate mousse (which had a citrus taste to it)!Also, I would just like to thank the host or manager? His name is JR and he did such an excellent job of working with the other staff and making sure everything was running smoothly. He was also very friendly with the customers and my family, showing a lot of respect and courtesy.I'll definitely be back for some drinks at the bar or brunch. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu and to see the staff again. Thank you for such a wonderful dining experience! It's something you'll rarely find anywhere else.",

Good food-especially the fries-and generally good service. The one caveat being that after I told one of the waiters that I didn't want a second drink, I was served one anyway. I know this doesn't seem like a huge issue, but to me, good service hinges on listening to the customer/client and being attentive. That reservation aside, I do think this is a good restaurant/cafe.",
7,,3/9/2018,188,,"Brooklyn, NY",Emily C.,102,4.0,56,"Bocado Cafe is an absolutely adorable Italian cafe. The ambiance inside is very sweet, calm, and intimate -- the perfect place for date night or dinner with family. The waitstaff is also very attentive and pleasant, which made the meal that much better.Their food is also very, very good and actually blew my expectations out of the water. I got one of their specials as an appetizer -- a spinach and quinoa soup, which was chicken broth based and also contained a medley of peas, carrots, and onion. It was delicious! A little lukewarm, though, which was a bit upsetting. As an entree I got a simple Mediterranean Salad ($16) with all the usual fix-ins, and added chicken (for an extra $5). It was topped with a caper and lemon vinegarette, which added a wonderful note to the dish as a whole.My companions got a chorizo flatbread to share, which was small enough for an appetizer, and the spinach linguine with seasonal vegetables and the crab cake burger. They said both were excellent, and I don't have any reason to doubt!The next time you find yourself on 87th and Lex, definitely give Bocado a try!",

At 12:30p, there was no wait, seated and served without any wait.. The server was accommodating to seat preference and available at the right time. Food: I ordered the NY steak and eggs. The food was efficiently prepared and well plated for a simple meal. My only critique was the medium-well steak I ordered was more just medium. Overall the meal left me full and satisfied.  This place is good find for someone on the run and looking for a time-out for brunch or lunch.  If in the area will come back",

Since we came on a Monday afternoon, we got seated immediately with no wait. The waitress was very friendly and she took our order and brought out our food pretty quickly. We all ordered different items and everything was absolutely delicious. I went with the eggs benedicts which came with a side of home fries and it was amazing. I did wish the home fries were more crispy, as these were the soft potato kinds which are not my favorite but the flavors went together amazingly. One of my friends got a nutella crepe with bananas and it was super good, the crepe itself was filled with nutella and there were slices on banana on top. Overall, the food here was solid, all my friends loved their dishes and I could see myself coming back here. My bill came out to be around $18 with tips and tax which is pretty standard for a NYC Brunch.",2

We had friendly service while seated at the bar (they were able to accommodate us even on Father's Day). Both the meals we ordered we delicious -- I was initially skeptical of an $18 omelette and $20 veggie burger, but it was worth the price. A fun plus point was their brunch deal of one complementary mimosa, Bellini, Rossini, coffee or OJ per person. I would be happy to go back here.",

I ordered the avocado toast and it was delightful, served with a fresh side salad. They brew intelligentsia coffee which is a personal favorite of mine.

Nice service the lady that's supposed to show us the way just stood there and not very welcoming although she was nice to all the other white couples for some reason. Went there with class, a professor and 5 college students. It's not a fancy restaurant but it's a nice interior and decent atmosphere...guess we weren't wearing anything nice or they think we are just a bunch or kids that won't order or pay much. My professor tipped them 18% for us 6. The waiters are all very friendly and welcoming though. Quite a few seats and not full at all so it's nice and not loud and noisy at all.

It felt like a relaxed cafe while the city bustled around outside. One of the less expensive restaurants we ate at during our time in NYC with still very generous portions and gourmet tasting food. We had the pear salad and the crispy chicken sandwich both were wonderful and full of flavor. Loved seeing manchego cheese on the menu! Service was very great. Everything came out quickly and correctly. Would absolutely recommend this place for breakfast lunch or dinner you're guaranteed to have a great experience.,2

It was decently crowded, but we were able to be seated right away.To start off, we went with an order of the hummus. The hummus was decent, but nothing to write home about and was not a very large portion for the price.For the main meal we decided to split the chicken paillard salad and the chicken halloumi sandwich. The salad was decent, very fresh and a decent size--but again, not the most memorable in terms of flavor.The chicken halloumi was probably the most interesting flavor combination of the three items, but still the flavors sort of blended together and the chicken was a bit overcooked.Overall, this place serves up some decent food, but I felt like the pricing was a bit high, especially considering the portion sizes. In addition, the food took a looonng time to come out (close to 30 mins) and for lunch, that's not acceptable.",

Updated review",58,,"New York, NY",Colie R.,279,2.0,156,"I ended up going back to Bocado for Brunch and two of us got the Chicken Quesadilla with Fries, after confirming with the waitress it is a good choice.  The Quesadilla was HORRIBLE. In my life I don't think i've tasted a more flavorless meal.  It tasted like nothing, and both of us had the meal prepped as is so it had peppers, onions, and cheese in it.  All things that should have given it flavor.  It still tasted like nothing.  The peppers and onions weren't even fully cooked.  At one point we started to use the chipotle mayo dressing from someone's else's dish in an attempt to give the meal some flavor, not even that could help it.  Nor could the salsa that it came with.  It ended up being a very expensive, and non tasteful meal.",

We came here for a weekday brunch, so we didn't get free drinks but they did have a breakfast ""special"": $14 for two eggs, fruit, toast, breakfast meat, home fries and coffee. Honestly, the coffee was the best thing I had here.We also had the huevos rancheros.... which I'm sorry but the name doesn't fit the dish. It was two pieces of tortilla with eggs, beans, and guac. It was filling but it definitely tasted like something we could EASILY make at home.The service was great and the decor is so inviting, but nothing can make up for the poor food quality. It's also not the best value for what you get.

Reservation was a good call overall though because all tables were filled the whole time we were there. We were seated within 2 minutes of walking in the door and greeted by our server right away. Such a cozy and warm vibe, the staff was very smart and attentive, and everything was delicious. Had a great alcohol selection with a long wine list and nice beer options. Two of us had really nice wines and the third had a beer. We didn't do any apps because we were a little short on time but they gave fresh bread which is always appreciated.For our entrees, I had the Spinach Linguine, one friend had to Margherita Flatbread, and the third had the Burger Burger. All entrees were fantastic and we loved the wide variety of offerings. I was able to substitute my pasta for gluten free due to an intolerance which was a huge plus and very accommodating (also why the attached photo is a different noodle than linguine). The Margherita Flatbread had really fresh basil and was the perfect size but also could have been shared well.

Although it took a little bit of time for the foods to be served, the wait was definitely worth it. The egg benedict wasn't very special in terms of recipes- nothing special compared to other restaurant's egg benedicts; however, the quality of the benedict was excellent. I loved how the poached eggs were cooked, and how the hollandaise sauce turned out. Mushroom pizza was very fancy: the texture of the mushroom was excellent and the balance between the truffle scent and the mushroom was fabulous: I was able to sense&taste the truffle oil, yet wasn't overwhelmed by it.",1

I did call it to attention to a waitress and she said it was really like a fig glaze and when I said are you sure because again I couldn't see or taste it she said you really can't taste it.

It wasn't the best eggs benedict but it wasn't bad. It was good enough to fill me up and satisfy my eggs benedict craving. The brunch menu also comes with a glass of either mimosa or orange juice.

My friends said that their entrees tasted pretty good and mines was pretty good too. However, I felt like the portions were huge! My friends have been here before and just ordered appetizers and thought that was too much. So, definitely share entrees unless you have a hearty appetite.

Yes, there are numerous brunch restaurants in the city and I have hopped around pretty much every ""famous brunch spot"" to find my favorite. To my surprise, or it may not be, Bocado, located in UES, became my favorite brunch place because of numerous good memories I made with my friends and families. Bocado Cafe serves breakfast/brunch, lunch, and dinner. I have only tried their Brunch, but I am sure their dinner's good. What I really like about Bocado's Brunch is complimentary drinks that comes with delicious food. I normally get truffle flatbread pizza. It is so rich in mushroom/truffle flavors and comes on a long wooden plate, right from the oven. My sister, (who I normally come to Bocado with), almost always gets mushroom egg Benedict (I guess we are mushroom lovers). It comes with rich Hollandaise sauce and house fried potatoes. We both love how well both dishes are made & served. All the servers are friendly and nice. They really know how to make your Sunday morning a happy one.",1

Not enough for the price though.2. Bolognese linguini - plenty of meat, taste was a bit sweet which tasted different and good3.

When I told the hostess we hadn't seen a waiter she said she'd take care of it. Nothing. When we got the attention of the bartender who was now taking the order of the 3rd couple who arrived after us, and we told him so, he didn't apologize but smirked and shrugged his shoulders. On the way out I told the hostess who apologized again, which was at least courteous. We live in the neighborhood and used to come a lot (food is good) but not anymore. The service delay happens, ok, can get over that. The bartender's behavior, not so much. We have been back a few times. Service is still a little lacking but not bad. Food is good and always fresh.",

84,,10/5/2015,13,1,"Manhattan, NY",Joe K.,89,3.0,80,"Okay, I'm giving Bocado three stars because I've been there several times and I generally like the place. But at the moment I feel like giving them just one star because they are in my doghouse for overcharging me. The sign outside their restaurant says ""Join us for breakfast and enjoy a complimentary coffee or tea with every meal"". Seems pretty straightforward, right? Heck, the Yelp page for Bocado Cafe even shows the same offer, right up at the top.So, why then, when two of us went for breakfast (not brunch, actual breakfast before Bocada begins their brunch service), did our waitress insist on charging us for the cup of coffee and tea that we had? And this is not a small nitpick, it's $3.50 a cup for each of them. Plus tax. Our check was nearly $8 more than it should have been. When we pointed out what we thought was an error on our check, she told us that the free coffee/tea only came with the 'breakfast special' (eggs, toast, coffee and juice, or some such combo thing.) By that logic, one could claim that the eggs are free with the special. Or the toast is free. Or whatever component of the special one cared to single out.Doesn't matter, anyway. Their sign clearly says ""complimentary coffee or tea with every meal"". Pancakes aren't a meal? An omelette isn't a meal?A couple of days later I saw the same offer on their sidewalk sign. While I was taking a photo of it for posterity, a restaurant employee came out. I told him why I was taking the photo and he said he would talk to the waitress about what happened. Then he went back inside. Didn't seem too concerned about my $8. So, thanks for that, Bocado.",4

I felt very happy and my friend even bonded with our waiter JR over The Walking Dead. He was very attentive, but just to make sure it wasn't for show I observed how he interacted with other customers, and it was consistent.

We have called multiple times to get this taken care of and no one ever responds or shows even one ounce of acknowledgement that this needs to be fixed. At this point it is not about the money, but about an establishment (that we were previously loyal to) having some basic decency and customer service. If you come here just be warned they have terrible customer service if there is ever an issue and only pay cash because they will scam you and not refund it.Edited to Add:The owner reached out after this review was posted and stated that he wanted to refund us for the overcharge and also offered us a complimentary brunch to make up for what happened. The refund was processed very quickly and we were FINALLY able to get this resolved.",2

I ordered the zucchini burger ($15) and it was complete mush served on a thick, dry bun. The whole burger immediately fell apart and did not taste of any particular vegetable. I tasted my friend's penne a la vodka and that too was underwhelming, with the sauce hardening into a thick, rich paste by the end of our meal. In another friend's pasta dish, her capellini had random penne pieces strewn throughout it, somehow transferred from someone else's order into her own....not a problem except that it just doesn't represent high quality dining.For the price, it was absolutely not worth it.",3

After looking at food coming out of the kitchen, I started felling peckish and decided to try an appetizer- Brussels sprouts with chorizo sausage. Sprouts were crispy mixed with strong chorizo flavors and covered with Parmesan cheese. Really like the combination.

Always saw this place when I got off the subway but never ventured in. Right off the bat i fell in love with the decor. As a fixer upper (ok, joanna gaines) fan I felt like i was inside something she decorated. Subway tiles,open shelving, exposed brick ... shiplap! (maybe not real shiplap) Anyway, i loved it. It was also larger than I anticipated. We posted up at the bar & enjoyed some delicious brunch. The croque madame was delicious but the bacon & egg pizza was to die for. Everything great about pizza & BEC combined in to one glorious flatbread! I personally like crispy dough and this was perfection. I was so pleased with brunch that I came back with my parents to try dinner. The decor is even more amazing in the evening! They light candles all over and it's adorably cozy! The food, unfortunately, was not great. It actually was not even good. Bocado Burger - this was actually OK but it's really hard to mess up a burger. Decent size, good quality meat, and cooked how it was ordered. So no complaints. If you are here for dinner, play it safe & order this.Frutti di mare - I always order squid ink linguine when it's on the menu & was excited for some seafood. Unfortunately nothing about this was good. The linguine lacked any flavor and all the seafood tasted off. I think it was overcooked. I ate a few bites of linguine & ended up tossing the rest. Day boat scallops - really over cooked and a bit rubbery. Grilled salmon - this wasn't terrible ... kind of tasted like salmon that I make myself at home (which isn't that great and certainly not worth almost $30!) The kale/quinoa was tasty ... but overall the entree was pretty meh. No one finished their meals (except the burger)Looking back at my review i'm wondering if seafood just isn't their thing. It's worth noting that both times the service was great! Friendly staff and short wait times.",

Highly recommend the French toast, flatbread pizza and Parmesan gnocchi. Keep in mind they don't have a liquor license so if you really need a Bloody Mary with your brunch or a cocktail with your dinner this isn't the place. Service could be better, at times it has been slow even when the restaurant isn't crowded. Some of the tables feel very close together and a little uncomfortably crowded when the place is busy. Overall, a great place to eat right off the 4/5/6, I moved to the area last summer and plan on returning here often. Great for a date or a girls night, or a lunch/brunch with friends.

Tired and hungry, we both quickly ordered pastas. While we waited, we received bread like any typical restaurant. Decent, nothing special. I ordered the linguine Bolognese which was a classic meat ragu sauce. The size of the dish looked like two fists full of pasta which looked like a decent size. I was pleasantly surprised after taking the first bite. Unlike your typically soggy/oily pasta, I thought the dish balance between sauce, pasta and meat. My friend got the penne alla vodka and said she loved it. It had a really strong and tasty creamy tomato sauce. She recommend it with two thumbs up! The seating is kinda like a café/bar/restaurant. Depending on time of day, you easily request seating to match your mood. Also, although I didn't get a wine, there's clearly a huge selection so its an easy way to fancy up your dinner.

With solid EVOO, I enjoyed the garlic dinner roll, sesame bread (had a weird chewy thing going on, though), then the wheat and white baguette.Bf had a better meal with a cup of really creamy (perhaps cheesy) split pea soup, and a Mediterranean salad which was beautifully plated with olives, feta cheese, and tapendade wrapped among a sliced cucumber and bed of lettuce.

It was dry, bland, not held together very well, and the bacon was overcooked and dried out, leaving no flavor. I've added a pic of it. They don't have any pickels. Instead of ketchup ok n the table they give you half a ramiken of ketchup with your burger. Not enough for the fries, which come in a cute little basket. Similar to the larger one used to drop fries into a deep fryer. The service good. I'm not one to need nor want a waiter constantly at my table, just to take me order, empty plate, bring me the bill and ocassionally refill my drink when it's low. The lemonade was semi - sweet and quite good. Will I return,  maybe, if I'm with other people or on a date, but I won't order the burger again.",

159,,11/1/2016,0,,"New York, NY",Jake M.,0,2.0,7,"We decided to try Bocado because it was nearby and looked like a pleasant neighborhood type of bistro.  It took a while to get the waitress to come to the table. I'm guessing about 10 minutes before someone showed up with either water or information. Two of our party wanted to share and ordered the 12 oz strip steak-frites. They asked the waitress if the two levels of doneness could be accommodated. Med Well and Med Rare. The waitress says no problem, but returned a few minutes later and says the chef refuses. They speak with the manager and he says they are busy with take out orders, and it's too much trouble. The dinning room was at half capacity.  They did eventually cook the two halves to order, but didn't bring out the plates at the same time, so two of the guests waited about 5 minutes before the med-well steak came out. Needless to say nobody ate until the third plate came out, so the med rare steak was cold and the gnocchi in a truffle mushroom cream sauce developed a skin. You are supposed to serve the entire table at the same time. They also had a salmon special but the waitress didn't bother find out when asked where the salmon came from. Farmed or wild, or what locality. She just came back and asked if we were ready to order. I also saw the same waitress step all over a scarf that fell on the floor, only to return five minutes later to pick it up and drape it over the seat back. The gnocchi was quite good, despite the lack of truffle flavor, and the steaks were average. I do have to point out that the manager did comp a chocolate mousse desert, which was also pretty good.Ambiance was average for a NYC bistro-ish venue, the wine list was acceptable, and the decor is industrial chic with paper napkins. Service was okay and acceptable, and they gave us space and time. Would I go back? Probably not, but maybe it's because I'm not in that neighborhood that often. Maybe a different waitress and a different time might yield different results.",

176,6,7/10/2012,4999,3,"New York, NY",Phil H.,12703,3.0,3287,"I really wanted to like this new bistro / cafe / wine bar that opened up recently in my hood, but after taking in a meal here this past Sunday afternoon I could think of only one word to describe my feelings of Bocado.Underwhelmed.It has a great look and the decor is upscale. Brick walls, dark woods, rustic cozy feel, nice bathrooms, lots of seating. Large wine rack display on the wall in the main dining area. Small coffee and bakery area to the left. Decent enough sized menu for a cafe style place. Friendly staff.Still, I feel there is a disconnect here. When I was here on Sunday I was handed a brunch menu. The menu is a bit limited, and seems a little pricey for the quality of the food. You do get one drink with brunch. I ordered the steel cut oatmeal which came in a large bowl sprinkled with a few candied walnuts and sweet dates. It was good but not $7 good. I also had  the roasted vegetable omelet. It had an ok amount of zucchini and squash in it but I felt like I could have easily made this at home. Came with some decently seasoned potatoes and a few pieces of bread that were hard as a rock. Again, for $12 it was just ok but a bit overpriced. It did not help that I was not offered any butter or jelly for the bread. I had an iced tea at $3.50 which was served in a large goblet and tasted good but was never asked if I wanted a refill, and I purposely placed the empty glass at the edge of my table so my waitress could see it. Nope. I was not even offered a glass of water. Definitely not a satisfying meal for $24. I know it's expensive to open a new restaurant but I think they have overestimated the clientele in this part of the neighborhood - we ain't all wealthy or up-to-do around here. The staff here seems pleasant enough, but it feels as if they are a bit untrained and on the younger side, so maybe a little more experience would help. I was never told about the wines or handed a wine menu. Since it is also a wine bar I was wondering why I was not asked if I would like a glass. Also, no wifi here at all. Seems kind of strange since this is a cafe and they are serving coffee and pastries here which I noticed most were getting. The iced coffee is really good here, but again at what they are charging for a large at $3.25 it seems a bit overpriced. They do have a nice selection of pastries, baked goods, wraps, and  though available in the display cases.Personally, as compared to the many diners, Le Pain Quotedien's, and now Panera Bread close by I think Bocado is a nice addition to the area that should get better over time. It offers a nice alternative to these other dining options that is sorely lacking up here. I'll give it a few more tries before a final verdict but for now it's more like a 2.5 star kind of spot to me, but I'll round up to 3 stars for the effort and that I like to support new biz in my hood.",8

She had stopped by earlier in the day, knowing that we needed to choose a place to go for dinner, and she spoke with the manager who later brought us free dessert when we returned later that night! My cousin loved that they can make any of their pasta dishes with gluten free pasta. They have a wide selection of entrees to choose from and some interesting appetizers. Their bread basket has this cinnamon raisin roll which was delicious! Their Russian Red Kale salad is amazing (i got it both times). You can also add shrimp, salmon, chicken or steak to any salad. The second time I went, I was with my mom and boyfriend. She got the Chopped Mediterranean salad and he got the Oven Roasted Rosemary Chicken (I tried it and it was so good! Perfectly cooked and seasoned)Anyway this is a great place and conveniently located right off the 4/5/6 at 86th street. They also have excellent customer service. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I feel like while everything tastes really good, nothing is out-of-this-world amazing. I am kind of picky about my 5 star reviews (and try to reserve them for super interesting/different restaurants) but this place is definitely worth going to and has become one of my regular go-to restaurants on the Upper East Side.

Service was a bit slow, the waitress was nowhere in sight until we finally asked a busser to send her over. All-in-all, it was an okay experience.Two weeks later we decided to give it another shot. We ordered the same breakfast pizza, as well as an eggs benedict. This time, the pizza tasted like it had been covered in salt; semi-edible but nowhere near as good as last time. Then I sliced into my eggs benedict, expecting a warm runny yolk, only to find the ""poached"" egg was hard and way overcooked. We agreed we probably wouldn't be coming back, but I wanted to at least give the breakfast potatoes a shot. I had a few bites and was satisfied, until I looked a little closer and saw a thick, dark hair. I poked around and found three more strands. Four pieces of hair. In my breakfast potatoes.

I still enjoy going in to eat but wouldn't recommend ordering delivery - especially since the bread they serve is really good and it apparently isn't included in delivery orders.,3
