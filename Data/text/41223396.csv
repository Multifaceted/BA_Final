First off, can't thank the staff enough to let us hang out here every alternate week and have our meetings etc.We usually order breakfast here, but happened to be here one day even for lunch.Ordered a delicious and rather expensive $35 ""Original DB Burger"". Nothing amazing or worth $35 about it though. Tasted like any other $17-$20 burger.Service is amazing.",2,1,3
1,Charlie E.,"San Diego, CA",159,202,48,2.0,7/28/2018,"Unbelievably mediocre.  My grandmother hyped this place up- perhaps it used to be something.  I got the $35 burger and it was soggy and lacked flavor.  The fries were McDonald's quality but a bit crispier.  The bread was quite good- and the butter was served on a cold stone.  I thought that this was a nice touch.  The service sucked.  The waiter picked up my girlfriend's plate prior to our party finishing.  Awkward.  Overall the entire experience was very underwhelming.  Top this with a long wait time, and I cannot see why anyone would regard this place well.  Steer clear and eat anywhere else nearby.",,,1
2,Joe B.,"Mill Valley, CA",33,72,17,5.0,10/26/2018,"This is one of our absolute favs in New York. Daniel Boulud is world famous for a number of deserving reasons. In our party of six, our variety included an amazing tasting menu, the best steak an poivre I've ever had, duck confit ravioli, escargot, beet salad, the famous DB Burger (hmmmm) and some of the best desserts ever (molten chocolate cake, pumpkin creme brûlée, madeleines). While I'm usually here for a swank night out, this time we took the family and the staff could not have been more accommodating, engaging or nice. WE LOVE THIS  PLACE!",,,
3,Kimberly D.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",103,356,1545,2.0,1/21/2018,"I was super disappointed with this experience. It's my second time at a DB restaurant and it's the second time I've been let down.I came here with my husband, who was so looking forward to trying the infamous DB burger stuffed with foie gras and black truffle. We sat down and ordered a cocktail each. I went for the Lie in Wait (bourbon, allspice, lemon, honey, angostura), which was a fantastic drink for winter - the allspice was the perfect touch. Hubby went for the Louis XIX (rye-based) and he enjoyed his. We also had a bottle of Sky Zinfandel which was quite unique and tasty ($89) from Napa. The cheapest bottle of wine on the menu was $65, btw. The wine took a while to get to our table, but I have a feeling something was going on that night:The table next to us was complaining about their wait time for their meals, as was the table across from us...The bread was yummy, and then out came the amuse bouche. They were little fried potato bites. They were a little salty, if you ask me, but otherwise tasty. My scallops were cooked well, with squash and fennel, but..... now we get to the burger debacle. For a $35 burger stuffed with foie gras and truffle, I'd expect something amazing. Here we go:1. It was cold. 2. Truffle is a VERY recognizable smell/taste. I'm not sure it was even in this burger. Didn't smell it OR taste it.3. The piece of foie gras was almost unnoticeable, compared to what is shown in the pictures (see mine for comparison!)4. The slices of tomato were so cold, they were almost frozen.5. Hubby asked for the burger to be medium... but... it was raw.On any other occasion, I would've sent this meal back. BUT, it took its time getting there and we were catching an 8pm show. At this point it was already 7:25 so I knew we'd never make it. But, it didn't matter because our waiter, although very nice, NEVER came back to the table to even ask us how things were going. I wouldn't have been able to send it back if I wanted to. Cheese plate for dessert was good. Kind of hard to mess that up..So, between the shit burger and the long wait, maybe they felt bad? They gave us some cookies on the house in addition to the petit fours that everyone gets. So, DB restaurants are 2 for 2 with bad experiences. Probably not going to try a 3rd.$220 got us:- burger- scallops- cheese plate- 2 cocktails- $89 bottle of wine",3,,1
4,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2403,4794,4.0,12/21/2017,"My mission: The db burger. A beef burger stuffed with short rib, foie-gras, and black truffles.I planned a nice day for my wife & I last Sunday. Come into NYC, see the tree at Rockefeller center, have a hot chocolate and walk around before our early reservation and jazz show. I gave my wife the full NYC tour, we had the best time! Then, we head towards DB Bistro Moderne. The restaurant opens promptly at 5, we sat at the bar and ordered drinks. I ordered for my beautiful Brooklyn-French-Canadian wife a French wine and I ordered cocktail. We're having our drinks and then our table is ready. The waitress takes our order and we started with the lentil hummus. Insane! The hummus tasted light and airy, it really was chef'd up to another level.My wife ordered the Atlantic Cod and I ordered the db burger. My wife loved her Cod. The skin was crispy, the fish was cooked amazing, go team!The famous DB Burger? Yeah.. .It didn't knock off the Minetta Tavern Black Label burger as the best I ever had, Sorry Chef Daniel Boulud. The meat blend was amazing. They created a pocket and stuffed the patty with the short rib, foie-gras, and black truffles. It made the burger as a whole complex and it didn't gel together. When I took my first bite, I had the onion roll, beef patty, short rib meat and foie-gras. I had to deconstruct the sandwich to appreciate each component. It was good, don't get me wrong but for $35 bucks I expected it to be the king of all all burgers. I was not.DB Bistro Moderne is a Chef Daniel Boulud establishment. My wife and I had a great meal here and will return for future events in midtown. From the cocktails to the appetizers and main courses, Chef Daniel Boulud has another great restaurant under his umbrella.Mike Charlie (Mission Complete)",9,7,9
5,J. C.,"Arlington, VA",0,17,12,1.0,11/10/2018,This was the worst breakfast we had in New York. We had high hopes given the connection of this restaurant to Daniel. Yikes! It was sub par food that felt almost like a free breakfast you'd get in a Holiday Inn. Very very disappointed.,,,
6,Cynthia A.,"Malibu, CA",7,144,149,2.0,9/16/2018,"So disappointed - it's been a few years since we'd enjoyed a wonderful dinner. Came for brunch - a little early for our reservation. Only a few other couples (seriously, only about 3 other couples max) here for brunch at 10 am. But they seat us at a tiny table for 2. and there are several other larger tables available. During the entire hour we're there, only one other party arrives. So clearly, there was room to put us at a larger table. We ordered the french toast, side order of sausage, and The New Yorker (bagel with smoked salmon, cream cheese). They offer you choice of plain, sesame or ""everything"" bagel. I order the sesame bagel. The server comes back and apologizes that the sesame bagel is unavailable. Really??! It's Sunday brunch (10am!!) in NYC and you only have plain or ""everything"" bagel? You can't find any other bagels in NYC? It's not like these are awesome bagels either. The plain bagel is good, but seriously, I had an awesome bagel at Zucker's deli and they're not even the best place in town. The smoked salmon is good, but again, not anything special. This is DB - isn't everything supposed to be amazing?? I'm seriously disappointed. The french toast is a beautiful thick cut slice of brioche type bread, but while I don't like french toast dry or overcooked, this is slightly too moist in the inside. The sausages look good, but they don't taste fresh and juicy - slightly off. I don't mind splurging for an exceptionally prepared meal, but this was very mediocre and not worth it.",,,
7,Joe P.,"Huntington Beach, CA",100,1635,6291,5.0,11/3/2017,"I had been to Daniel Boulud's restaurant in Vegas, and really enjoyed myself.  So, when a client suggested we meet for dinner at DB's bistro near Time Square, I was happy to do so.  They offer a 3 course prix fixe menu, and also an ala carte menu.  We started off w/ a complimentary tomato confit to go w/ our tempranillo wine ($18).  The starter and wine was a nice way to whet our appetites for the main courses:  4 Stars.For our mains, we had the foie gras terrine w/ green apple ($24), and the agnolotti w/ brown butter, butternut squash, ricotta, and sage ($31).  We ended up sharing both plates.The foie gras was amazing.  A terrine is like a piece of art, and it really takes a skilled chef to prepare one. The exec chef here has been trained very well bc the terrine ate like a meal.  I don't believe foie gras is available in CA any longer, so when I see it on the menu, I indulge:  5 Stars.Likewise, the agnolotti was well thought out.  The ingredients paired expertly together.  Brown butter is an art, and again the exec chef has been trained well.  This dish also ate like a meal.  I was thoroughly satisfied visually & gastronomically:  5 Stars.For dessert, the complimentary petit fours was a nice surprise.  However, the gateau w/ figs & pistachio ice cream was excellent.  The ingredients were unique and paired excellently together.  It was a fantastic way to end the meal:  5 Stars, Regarding the ambiance, its a small place that is good for a before theatre meal.  Nonetheless, it didn't feel too cramped our loud:  4 Stars.  However, what really stood out was the excellent service from our waiter, José, and the Mgr, Carmelo.  José hails from Ecuador.  He was super friendly and attentive:  So was the entire team.  Our water glasses were constantly being refilled, and the crumbs were swept away after the mains.  Carmelo stopped by and I informed him how good the service was from José.  He took my card and added me to their mailing list:  Thats excellent customer service!The experience here hit on all cylinders.  The presentation and ingredients of the dishes were well thought out.  In addition, the excellent service from the manager down to all the waitstaff made for a very pleasant experience.",35,27,34
8,Alex K.,"Arlington, MA",19,134,236,5.0,6/7/2018,"Five stars. Nice place. Good everything. I had the coq au vin and escargot sans shells (seems the NYC way as housing is limited) and GF had the steak frites. She asked for the medium well but it came rare. No bueno, but I think this place believes in rare meat for max flavor -but the diner should have their say not the chef. The food was well made and service was excellent (properly clearing and serving dishes and attentive too). They even have a ""somnambulist"" for the wine. I see this place gets some neg reviews but my experience was great. They tossed in some freebies as well. Peep out this place, YELPers.",,,
9,Sammie W.,"Brockton, MA",104,4,2,4.0,10/28/2018,"Our first dinner spot in NY, and we were blown away by the amazing service they had. The server knew the menu inside and out, and suggested good choices. We had "" The Original DB Burger"" and the ""Steak Au Poivre"" which were cooked perfectly. The seating arrangements were not the best, as we we were located in the corner only two inches apart from a party of four. We have to push the table out just to be seated and to leave. I felt bad as my body was particularly on the other parties table while I was trying to leave. Everything else was amazing, from the set up on the table, the bread, the food and the service.",,,
10,Sandy T.,"San Diego, CA",131,95,23,2.0,7/28/2018,"Underwhelming to say the least. As soon as I walked in I noticed a strong bleach smell. When we saw the menu, it was the brunch menu, it was rather bland. Nothing seemed appetizing. I ordered the flambee and it was a glorified flat bread with tiny pieces of bacon. I'd, honestly, rather have a flatbread pizza from Dominos. My boyfriend had the burger and my grandma had the French toast. The French toast was the only decent dish. Overall, our bill was way too expensive for the subpar dishes, the underwhelming atmosphere, the mediocre service. Sadly, I am severely disappointed.",,,
11,Eric C.,"Katy, TX",280,459,2304,4.0,7/8/2017,"In this week's episode of #BurgerQuest, my travels brought me to DB Bistro Moderne, arguably the birthplace of the modern ""haute"" gourmet burger craze.  Chef Daniel Boulud's DB burger is like a Cadillac of beef, stuffed with short rib, foie-gras, and black truffle - and I knew that I just HAD to try it while I was in NYC.I dropped in for lunch and pretty much immediately ordered the DB burger, although some of the other items on their menu sounded quite tasty as well.  Whilst I waited for my burger to be delivered, I was provided a complimentary basket of fresh baked, tasty breads and some nice, salty butter - perfect appetizers to nosh on whilst I eagerly awaited the main course.When my DB burger arrived, I probably spent a good 2-3 minutes taking pictures of it on my iPhone, much to the bemusement of my server.  This thing was born to be an Instagram star, with its rich layers, hefty beef patty, and toasty parmesan bun.  Post this on your social media account for an instant +100 likes.  The burger came served with a platter of nicely crispy pomme frites (if you're eating a gourmet burger stuffed with foie-gras, you might as well call them pomme frites instead of French fries) and 3 different dipping sauces.So the burger looked amazing, but did it TASTE amazing?In short - yes and no.  I think the burger patty itself was spectacular - the beef was extremely high quality, cooked perfectly medium-rare, and was quite filling.  The short ribs added a lovely ""gamey"" taste that I thought complemented the beefy patty nicely.  But the other ingredients didn't really ""gel"" with the burger into a cohesive taste.  I thought the foie-gras felt out of place, as if it was just forced into the burger to make it more expensive/gourmet, and the burger itself was pretty huge and ungainly to eat.  The parmesan bun was nicely toasted but didn't do a great job of soaking up the burger juices.Ultimately, I felt like the individual ingredients were all spectacular - but they didn't combine or complement each other extremely well.  Hence, it was a great burger - but my quest to find the best burger will continue elsewhere.OVERALL: 4/5.  Definitely a fantastic experience, and for all its shortcomings it's still a great burger - well worth a stop if you're a burger lover, just to say you tried the famed DB burger!",5,1,2
12,Jinny C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",2,49,290,4.0,1/30/2018,"Another great place to try for RW! It is so close to the heart of Times Square yet you don't feel like you're in the hectic area at all and can really wind down with a good friend over good food.Food 4/5:Apps:Kale Salad- the salad is light with some delicious candied pecans! I did find the blue cheese fairly strong though so definitely need to assemble the bite well to get the right flavors.Venison & Pate- different from other pate I've tried as it didn't come out with any accompaniments (I like to spread it over some nice bread or crackers); though there was a phyllo type crust around the venison & foie gras, the flavor wasn't really great. Also there were a few parts that were too gelatinous...The chef did send complimentary cauliflower amuse bouches which were nutty and delicious too- just a nice little bite.Mains:Famous DB Burger- After hearing so much about this amazing burger, my friend and I knew we had to try it (even with the $14 supplement). The sirloin meat was tender and cooked medium- no complaints there! And surprisingly the short ribs filling was super prominent in flavor. Meaty and juicy, this was quite the burger BUT I must admit I couldn't really smell or taste any truffles or even the foie gras...Lemon Sole- ordered a light fish dish to balance out what we knew was going to be a heavy meaty burger. And this dish turned out to be amazing!!! The fish was super flaky and soft; served over some rice in a tantalizingly subtle lemon sauce.Desserts:Coconut Gateau-surprisingly this was the best fruity dessert! Perfect amount of creamy and crunchy and tart and sweet! Definitely tasted the pineapple, passion fruit, and coconut in perfect harmony.Chocolate Mousse- the chocolate cake/mousse was good but nothing spectacular. The ice cream dollop had a gold flake on top, which was of course so very pretty.Ambience 5/5:The place is bigger than it looks and has a very calm and chic vibe. I love how you can actually have a conversation here over a bottle of wine! The bottles offered for RW were decent too. And the waitstaff were all courteous and polite! Never had to look long for some assistance.",2,,
13,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",255,802,1189,3.0,1/23/2018,"3.5 stars. Solid option considering the midtown location and the pre-theater/post-work/tourist clientele. Crab crostini is meh, and scallops are grossly overcooked, but the escargot fricassee is truly a delight, despite a very misleading menu description where (1) the size suffices for an entree and (2) I still have no idea what chicken oysters are and why there is pasta in the bowl.",1,1,1
14,Esther L.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",85,148,408,5.0,1/15/2018,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience at DB Bistro Moderne. The service and food were excellent. It was a wonderful way to celebrate his birthday. When we walked in, the hostess, manager, and coat check attendant welcomed us. We were immediately whisked away to our table. Our waiter Chuck E was wonderful and attentive. He asked what water we preferred (bottled, tap, sparkling, etc.) It's a common courtesy to ask for water preference in Europe so I was surprised when he asked but found the gesture to be thoughtful. My boyfriend ordered the War Flag and I ordered Jack's Hard Cider. The stout was delicious and was rich with coffee and chocolate. I normally prefer sweet ciders and while this cider was not very sweet, it was perfect for the course of our meal because it complimented what we ate.We began our meal with a delightful bread basket. There were two dinner rolls, a pretzel roll, and two thick pieces of brown bread. The pretzel roll was lovely. You must smell the brown bread. It smelled divinely of rosemary and tasted exactly like rosemary. The butter came on a small plate and was very high quality butter. With the way we were greeted and with the bread and butter alone, we were excited to progress with our meal.We then ordered the chicken liver mousse and hummus. The hummus had raisins in it and incredibly flavorful and unlike any hummus I had ever had. It was accompanied with pita triangles. The chicken liver mousse was incredible. It was so smooth and rich. My boyfriend had never had chicken liver mousse and while he was interested in trying it, was nonetheless hesitant. He said that it was wonderful and was astounded by the flavor. The chicken liver was bordered with butter and came with crostini. We then were given a complimentary amuse bouche. It looked like a meatball but consisted of potato with a red pepper sauce. For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the diver scallops and I ordered the Original DB Burger. He said that the scallops were very flavorful and light. While he feels that they would not have been filling on their own, by the time he finished his plate he felt content. I set out knowing that I wanted the DB Burger. I wanted to know what a $35 burger tasted like. The reviews on Yelp suggested that the DB burger misses the mark. I sadly have to agree with the consensus. It was a gamey burger which I liked but the foie gras and short ribs did not add flavor and it fell flat. If you're looking for a greasy cheeseburger, this is not it. But if you're looking to say that you've an incredibly expensive and fancy burger that is massive and that you have to eat with a fork and knife, one that is filled with foie gras, short ribs, and black truffle on a parmesan bun, then this is it. But if you're looking for a burger that is flavorful and is half or a third of the cost, you might be left feeling unfulfilled. The surplus of fries that came with the burger were great. For dessert my boyfriend ordered the sorbet trio and I ordered the sticky toffee pudding. The sorbet flavors were green apple, dark chocolate, and coconut. He said that the sorbet was amazing and would come back for it alone. I was expecting a bowl of sticky toffee pudding. The pudding that came out was more on the deconstructed side. While it does not look like a regular sized portion of dessert, it was rich and delicious. Our meal ended with complimentary petit fours that came in flavors of Irish cream, peanut butter, and I believe what was sugar covered apricot jelly.I had noted on the Opentable reservation that this was for a birthday. When our dessert came out, Chuck E presented us a bowl of madeleines. They were warm, light, lemony, and covered with powder sugar. The plate had ""Happy Birthday"" written on it. It was very kind of the restaurant to add to our celebration. I very much appreciated that they took note of the Opentable remark. We also appreciated that they kept the birthday quiet and tasteful and did not make a spectacle of it. Between meals, Chuck E cleaned off our table. Cleaning off the table and delivering complimentary bites is what I think makes a restaurant be from great to excellent. While we cannot come here as often as we'd like, we will remember that we had a wonderful dining experience and appreciated every second.",2,,
15,Victoria A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,35,41,1.0,2/4/2018,"Earlier this week, I ate at db Bistro Moderne for restaurant week, and I have a lot of mixed feelings about it, so here I go. We came here to try out the restaurant week menu. Our reservation was for 7:30, but I arrived at 7:00 and was seated anyway, which was great. It was really cold that night so I didn't want to be waiting by the door. Unfortunately, the table they seated me at was against the opposite wall from the door but it still somehow ended up feeling drafty. All night, I was trying to figure out how it was possible to feel a draft so far away from the door, but it didn't matter-- I had to sit there with my winter coat draped over my shoulders all night. While I was waiting for my boyfriend to join me, someone came over to offer me water. I took this opportunity to ask what options on the restaurant week menu were dairy-free. Instead of answering, he explained how the restaurant week menu works. I told him that I understood the concept of restaurant week, but I needed to know which menu items didn't have dairy in them due to dietary restrictions. After hearing this explanation he.... continued to explain the restaurant week menu all over again. This came off as extremely condescending. Since that man was of absolutely no help, I waited to ask the waiter (a different man) when he came around to take our order. This time, this man actually scoffed and said ""Everything has dairy,"" gesturing to the whole menu. Disappointed, and taken aback by this response, and said ""Okay then, what am I supposed to eat?"" At this point, he then started singling out certain menu items like the fish and steak saying that these items would be safe. If he knew that these items (the fish & the steak) would be safe, why did he originally tell me everything had dairy? Laughing and giving a sarcastic answer is probably #1 on the list of bad customer service ideas. Off the restaurant week menu, I ordered the Baby Kale Salad (without the gorgonzola), the Hanger Steak, and the Dark Chocolate Marquise. The dessert did have cream or milk in it, but I do take lactaid pills so I decided to take the risk. The waiter did offer pineapple sorbet as a dairy free alternative, but I was so cold, I didn't want to be eating a frozen dessert. While we were waiting for the appetizers to come out, we were given bread for the table, and a little dish of cauliflower that was roasted, maybe? The cauliflower had a crunchy coating on it with a balsamic drizzle underneath and was really good. The bread was not. I tried cutting into a roll with my knife but the bread was almost so doughy and stretchy that the knife did nothing. As much as I tried to break off a piece, I was only denting the roll with the knife. When I finally ate a piece, I immediately regretted it. It was chewy and bland and just not worth it. The Baby Kale Salad was pretty standard-- nothing to complain about but it wasn't outstanding either. The Hanger Steak was actually very good and probably the highlight of my meal, though it sat on a really sad bed of lettuce. There's just no other way to describe the lettuce that was on the plate with the steak. It was wilted and sad, and as soon as I looked at it, I knew that was exactly how it needed to be described in this review. I didn't eat any, obviously. The entrees were served with a little cup of french fries and ketchup, and the fries were really good while they were still hot. The dark chocolate dessert was pretty standard. Finally, when the bill came, we split it and put it on our cards. We both signed our receipts, and then my boyfriend went to the restroom. The waiter came to pick up the receipts, he abruptly asked, ""Where's the second receipt?"" I said, ""It's not in there? I know he signed his and I put mine in there too. I'm sure it's in there because I saw him sign it.""  Waiter says, ""Well obviously he didn't because I only have one receipt. When he comes back, you need to make sure he gives it to me,"" and walks away. I'm not saying he was wrong for needing the receipt, but his attitude (throughout the whole night) was appalling. When my boyfriend returned from the restroom, he still must have forgotten to slip the receipt back into the folder because we were halfway out the door when our waiter came rushing after us, saying, ""I told you to have him leave the receipt! You need to give it to me!"" Completely unprofessional. Originally, I was planning on giving db Bistro Moderne 2 stars for the supremely rude and unhelpful staff I experienced. I thought 2 stars because I did enjoy my steak a lot, but our waiter really ruined the experience. However, after writing this review and re-living the experience, I'm only giving 1 star. I really wish I got the waiter's name because he left such a bad taste in my mouth that I'm angry about the experience all over again. There are so many truly great restaurants to experience in Manhattan... db Bistro Moderne  just isn't one of them.",,,

17,Vera L.,"Atlanta, GA",297,241,405,3.0,7/3/2017,"I met a few friends who flew in from out-of-town and wanted to grab dinner before their musical that night.  I hadn't really heard much from this place, but my friend said that it was pretty good.  French food is always a favorite although not necessarily my go-to, and I was looking forward to trying somewhere new, especially in the Theatre District since I tend to stay away from this area.  Two things that I got to try were their cheese table crackers and their seared scallops.Cheese Table CrackersPROS- very tasty: gruyere was the cheese of choice and it was on point- not ridiculously dryCONS- small and tiny, not enough to satisfy the craving-------Seared Scallops: this is probably one of my favorite ways to eat scallops.  I normally don't favor this one particular seafood because it tends to have a certain flavor that just doesn't feel quite 'fresh' to me.  However, if they are done well, I really do enjoy a great seared scallop entree.  PROS:- well plated, if you're into amazing plating- not overcooked: this by far would have failed the dish for me if the scallops turned out rubbery.CONS:- I'm not sure if I like just having four scallops as a main entree.  Those vegetable bits didn't quite do it for me as an accompaniment.  All in all, it wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't terrible.  I think there are other and better places though if you were to throw down money, especially for seared scallops.  The service was great, everyone was very attentive and we never had a dry cup.  I just wasn't amazed by anything.  I wouldn't turn it down but definitely so many other places in NYC to go to.",1,,
18,Lakisha J.,"Fishers, IN",52,79,225,5.0,7/29/2017,"I found this place with a quick Open Table search and saw that it had very high reviews and plenty of availability for when my friend and I wanted to go. When we walked in, I was surprised to only see a couple of tables of people there! But, then again, it was late-morning on a Friday, so most people were probably working while we were on vacation. Anyway, the food, as I found was usual for NYC, was extremely good. We both ordered a fairly simple meal of bacon, potatoes, toast and a mimosa, and though nothing overly exciting, each of our dishes was seasoned and cooked to perfection. For us, it was a nice, quiet break before some additional sightseeing, and we ended up staying longer than we expected just to chat and relax. Our server was just attentive enough to make sure we had refills and anything we needed, without interrupting our conversations. I'd highly recommend this place for a quiet brunch experience!",,,

The foie gras burger is a hefty $35 so definitely not an everyday burger (which should totally be a thing) but instead a nice, occasional treat. There is a more than adequate amount of foie gras in the center of the meat. It's tender, delicious, beautiful (yes I said beautiful) perfection. The only reason I knocked off a star is simply because the burger comes with mustard and to be frank, I am not a fan of the condiment at all. Rather than that I don't have any complaints. The pommel frites were amazing as well, but how can they not be? The service was very friendly and helpful too.

22,Jay I.,"New York, NY",250,682,190,3.0,12/5/2017,"When you see a restaurant in the city that participates in both lunch and dinner (and then on Sunday), there is a reason why, and it doesn't matter if Daniel Boulud's name is on the sign.  We were looking for this place for  a weekday dinner in the city during restaurant week, and this place came to my attention.  This place was often featured as serving one of the best burgers in the city, which also helped make my decision.The scene was vibrant.  There were a lot of people in the restaurant partly because it was restaurant week.  We were seated on the bar area (maybe because we looked too casual?... not sure), which was not bad.  They had restaurant menu which included the burger, but of course, the burger had extra charge which made it almost as expensive as the original price.  When we had the burger, it was humongous, first of all.  It was juicy and cooked medium well as i asked, but somehow it really lacked the it factor which might have impressed me more.  It was a good burger, but not good enough to say this is one of the best in the city.  Overall, it was not a bad night, but I doubt I will go there other than for restaurant weeks.",,,

We were seeing a play in the area and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to pop by DB Bistro. I am not above paying $30+ for a burger especially if said burger includes fois gras, my favorite food in the world. But it has to be good. This burger was totally lacking and I was crestfallen.First, the roll was stale. It literally crumbled. That was so disappointing. The fries were ok and fois gras was barely there. If I were to return, I would surely skip the burger.Service was fine and the place was busy. We were in and out in time to make the play. Bread basket was the highlight.",2,3,2

A wonderful sommelier (and delightfully funny as well!), food that amazed, great service. It was a memorable meal, and one of the best I had had in Manhattan. Fast forward to tonight, and I am sad to say that this place has absolutely taken a dive. Tonight was sub-par in almost every way. The service was absurdly slow... we didn't order food until 40 minutes in, and the waiter only saw us twice in that time... and the food was just not good. The brussels sprouts were somehow simultaneously raw and mushy on the outside, no crisp. The lobster salad, which I had been in love with a year ago, tasted mainly of vinegar from whatever dressing they used. And to kind of top it all off, every table around us received an amuse bouche at the top of the meal, except for us. Not that it's necessary, but seeing that aspect of the neglect we felt really drove home my disappointment in this experience.",,,

Updated review","So, Update.I put comment about how bad DB burger was.DB Bistro put the comment under my review and said, ""please, email your email or number and we will contact you.""

29,C K.,"Saint Helena, CA",83,28,14,2.0,2/5/2018,"THIS REVIEW IS STRICTLY FOR THE ORIGINAL DB BURGER. 5 Star for Service, 2 star for overhype, 1 star for burger- probably the most overrated burger I ever had after DB sold me on his preparation of this infamous burger. I'm sure the quality went down since he first put this out years ago but I agree 100% with Kimberly's review on the burger below. Why advertise truffles if you don't put any, and if quality of truffles is the case, at least mask it with truffle oil. If memory will serve me right, it will go down as the coldest burger I ever had, that came out fresh. Tomato confit? Tomatoes aren't even in season and had no taste. Foie had to be less than an oz as they just put a sliver in the middle to showcase it, and short rib had no flavor. Ordered burger med rare and it was surely raw, not even rare, in the middle. And to putv the cherry on top my buns were burnt. Basics, cmon- even Mcdonalds doesn't burn their buns for their $2 burger. I paid a decent amount of money so I forced myself to eat around this but my mom told me not to take more than you can chew and maybe this is a great example DB! Quality and consistency control please!",1,,

32,Anthony I.,"BAYSIDE, NY",148,8,25,5.0,10/22/2017,"My girlfriend and I celebrated our 6-month anniversary here before a lovely night out on Broadway and DB Bistro Moderne couldn't be any more amazing!  The service was spectacular, the food was delicious, and the restaurant ambience was wonderful. We selected our meal off the pre-fixe menu. The menu was full of great choices. My girlfriend had the lobster salad, steak frites, and chocolate dessert. I had the frisée aux lardon salad, the sweet potato gnocchi (it was SPECTACULAR), and the pecan macaron. And the meals came out in a timely fashion so that we had ample time to walk to the theater. Oh, and I should mention that the restaurant gave us a complimentary dessert in honor of our anniversary celebration! What a wonderful gesture!My only critique, and I do hope restaurant management reads this: DB Bistro Moderne should offer a more diverse non-alcoholic drink menu. For example, my girlfriend and I wanted mocktails and asked to have some of the custom fruit cocktails without alcohol. We were told that wasn't possible because the alcohol was already mixed in to the drinks, so I assumed that there was a batch of these drinks. Then I asked if the restaurant had non-alcoholic sparkling apple cider, like Martinelli's.  They didn't have it either. Not that it mattered because we ended up getting our usual seltzer and iced tea. However, I do hope the restaurant will be more accommodating to people who want to enjoy a night out.Otherwise, I definitely look forward coming back here and recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice solid meal before they head to the theater.",,,

It was OK.This is the kind of burger designed to by photographed and instagrammed - not eaten.It's the width of a slider but about 4-5 inches tall - impossible to eat like a normal human being.The burger was cooked perfectly, but the stuffed shortrib and fois grois don't add anything tastewise to the burger, only to the price tagAt a whopping $32 for a burger and fries, I expected something that would surpass the Minetta Tavern burger. Didn't happen here.I swear chef's are just too scared to add salt to dishes anymore (and there was none on the table), so the full flavor of the meats weren't able to come out.Luckily, the dish comes with decent fires (they don't have anything on the Minetta tavern fries though) so it adds a bit to the value.Service was pretty good, and your meal comes with a complimentary ""bread basket"" with 3 nice pieces of of bread and butter.Overall - i'd recommend only burger fanatics to try it once just to add another check mark to their ""Best Burger in NY"" bucket list",4,1,

I've been coming to DB Bistro Moderne for the past 3 years and I must say, my dining experience never ceases to meet my expectations. Unlike my previous dining experiences at DB Bistro Moderne which usually consist of a fish entree, I decided be a bit adventurous and order meat. Now if you know me in person, you'd know that I haven't eaten meat in years but today (until recently), I decided to take the plunge (after having a wonderful steak at a steakhouse in Toronto, but I digress). At this point, if you're someone who's quite fond of eating meat, you're probably wondering ""Why here? There are better places to have an entree that has meat?"", and you know what? You're absolutely right but the way I look at it, you've gotta start somewhere so why not at a restaurant by chef Daniel Boulud? For my lunch entree, I had the hanger steak frites which came with fries, while accompanied by a nice bottle of red wine (can't remember which one though). As usual, the service was excellent. The waitstaff were polite, professional, and well informed of the food menu as well as wine pairings for the meal. I look forward to coming back again soon.",,,

43,Steve A.,"Orlando, FL",249,1181,3443,4.0,3/27/2016,"We really like db Bistro for late night dinner after the theatre. It's a short walk from Broadway, and an 11pm reservation is no problem.The interior  is stylish and well lit, and quite late in the evening, although I'm sure it can get loud earlier.Service is friendly and efficient, and the menu offers a limited but interesting range of choices. The burger is famous, but because it is stuffed with short ribs and topped with foie gras, it is very rich, and should only be attempted if you are very hungry.On this visit we started with some seared shishito peppers, these were smaller than usual and nicely seared, served with a soy dipping sauce.My peekytoe crab appetizer was pretty, but didn't have a lot of flavor. However the sunchoke soup was rich and full of flavor.Amish chicken is tender and succulent, and served with an interesting pickled cabbage slaw that complements it well.An nice variety of wines are available in 5 or 8 ounce servings.",1,1,2

I feel that the most appealing part of the DB burger is the impressive amount of substance between the buns. I was not impressed by the actual taste of the burger.The other dishes were underwhelming.

We asked to sit in a booth and was told it was ""reserved"". Asked for a table in a side room, also ""reserved"". When we left an hour and a half later no one had come to those tables.

54,Cydnee R.,"New York, NY",99,41,10,3.0,4/16/2017,"Pardon me while I shake myself awake after this rather dull dining experience. The overall experience was really a three, but most of the food was good enough to earn a four star rating. Make no mistake, there is nothing hip, cool, or fun about this place. Don't let anyone give you that impression. This is straight up ""business lunch"" or ""let's venture down from the UES and live a little!"" Whomever is describing this place as ""laid back"" or ""casual"" needs an enema. Not that there's anything wrong with boring. I was just expecting a little more pizzazz. We visited on Easter Sunday and both ordered the pre fixe. I'm usually pretty mature about restaurants not always being family friendly, because not every restaurant can or should cater to kids, but if you're doing a holiday pre-fixe, consider for 30 seconds that families may be interested, and a little kids menu or kid-friendly item might be a welcome addition. So my kid ate $12 monkey bread. It was that or a $10 sausage link. As for mom and dad - we both started with the potato and leek soup. I've had better on airplanes. I also can't stand when restaurants don't put salt and pepper on your table. I might need it when you forget to use it back in the kitchen.  For main course, I had the Atlantic salmon with dill and horseradish sauce, which I enjoyed. Found the salt for that one, they did. My husband went with the steak and frites, except the frites were just roast potatoes and there were two eggs on the steak. He loved it, but please deliver the item on the menu, merci. He has celiac disease so the only option for him for dessert was ice cream, which was made of cream and also frozen. Vanilla, coffee, or chocolate were his options. SNOOOOOOOZ. I had the carrot cake, which was outstanding. Let's talk more about the icing. I'd like a tub of it to sit in later. We also enjoyed a nice bottle of Sancerre, as all wines were 50% off for the day. Coffee was fine, despite arriving at the table about halfway through dessert. All in all, food was good here but the atmosphere was duller than a crayon. I also loathe when restaurants have no waiting area in the front of the restaurant yet don't greet you when you're forced to stand/sit at the tiny bar, and staff makes you feel as though you've just put your feet up on the table. Do away with the stupid ""communal table"" if you need space for your guests to wait.",2,1,

Three different cheeses, accoutrements, bread, and raisins. The cheese selection featured a variety of different types (soft, hard, etc) and flavor profiles. The portion size was also great.I had the famous DB burger. A prime dry aged beef burger stuffed with short ribs, Foie gras, and black truffles on a homemade brioche bun.

The accompaniments were OK.The cheese course said it all:  It consisted of just two cheeses, one excellent blue, and one Italian something or another, neither description was offered.The table (I know it's supposed to be bistro) was small and uncomfortable.The highlight was the excellent $80 Vacqueyras, and the great stemware- the sommelier was friendly and very competent.",1,,

It sure isn't now. I'm sure DB himself hasn't set foot in it for years.  Among the sad experiences: a lobster appetizer with an $8 surcharge that tasted as if it was from a frozen batch of shelled lobster meat bought in bulk. In other words, tasteless.I guess the fussy dessert was the best thing. Some sort of ""deconstructed"" chocolate thing geared towards pre theatre tourists who would deem it swank.  I'd love to see this place get a gentle slap-in-the-face reboot because the location is good, the service staff nice.",,,
73,Steve L.,"New York, NY",131,269,1043,3.0,12/31/2015,"I should first point out that I came here for a business lunch, which placed some restrictions on what I ordered - normally, I would have gone with the much-raved about burger, but to avoid looking like a greasy-faced mess while discussing business a partner...we both ended up for the 2-course lunch (Menu de Marche`). We both had the arugula salad (with apple chips and crutons), which I thought was alright, but was dressed with a bit too much oil and didn't have enough dressing (brown butter vinaigrette). For the second course, I had the Flank steak with spätzle and carrots. The steak was nicely cooked - no complaints there, but thought the spätzle made the dish a bit too heavy or should have at least had more carrots. Someone else had the Tilefish, which looked great and came with a nice chickpea and cucumber salad.While the food seemed a bit underwhelming, the service was fantastic and the staff was very attentive and helpful. That said, I'll reserve some judgment of the DB Bistro until I come back for the famed burger.",,,1
74,Jonathan D.,"New York, NY",13,53,210,3.0,2/3/2017,"I caught an early (5pm) dinner table with the hopes of matching it with the happy hours; unfortunately the latter is only available at the bar. Another trifle was the actual restaurant week menu not matching what was posted online. Also unexpected, but very welcome, were the complimentary cheese puffs with Béchamel sauce. These tiny bites might be what I best remember. Next; the Salmon Rillade appetizer was a simple, clean, and tasty dish, especially if one considers that the workaday American equivalent of this plate is a tuna fish sandwich. On the staff's recommendation, I choose the seafood Bouillabaisse. A bowl of Hake, shrimp, and mussels arrived; my server then poured in a clear saffron broth. Kudos for presentation there! This was another well-executed dish, but maybe a bit too thin for the day's sub-freezing temps. My dessert course was the chocolate brownie. This was really good. All of  its' components were warm and fudgy, yet each preserved a distinct 'layer'. A hint of fruit filling and the sorbet topping cut through it all artfully. To sum up, the dishes were classic: not bold or inventive, but all done well.",,,

76,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,3.0,3/7/2014,"During Restaurant Week, restaurants usually wind up doing one of two things: (1) They use the opportunity to give diners a chance to experience the restaurant at its best, showcasing a true dedication to their clientele and the quality of food and service offered or (2) They relegate the few weeks as a period without profitability and make a half-hearted attempt to present the minimum. DB Bistro Moderne, unfortunately, falls into the latter category.I wanted to like it. After a wonderful brunch experience at Café Boulud, I was excited to try another restaurant under Daniel Boulud and eagerly made reservations here for a group of four at the start of the season. I have no complaints about the service, either. Our interactions with the host and our server that evening had were on point, and we never had an issue with getting a glass of water refilled or getting the attention of a staff member when needed. My main complaint lies, unsurprisingly, with the quality of food served that evening coupled with the effort the restaurant made to create a whole new menu specifically for Restaurant Week.To start off, my Broccoli Vichyssoise was far too watery to be called as such. It needed more cream to help offset some of the bitterness in the broccoli and the small pinch of ricotta cheese on top wasn't able to help the dish much. I was similarly unimpressed with the Pork Duo that followed, which consisted of several slices of pork tenderloin and Viennoise Sausage on top of stewed French Coco Beans. The tenderloin was pretty dry and I was unable to taste the Horseradish Gremolata that accompanied the dish. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the savory flavor of the sausage and the coco beans were cooked perfectly.Dessert was a fairly safe ending, as I opted for the profiterole - a scoop of mocha ice cream sandwiched between a choux pastry ball garnished with crushed hazelnuts and topped off with mocha cream. Not overly sweet, well-portioned, and served chilled, it was easy to clean my plate. I stole a few tastes of my friend's Brown Butter Cherry Tart as well and appreciated the acidity from the red wine cherry sorbet against the richness of the brown butter.In the end, I have to agree that DB Bistro Moderne is ""A-OK"". The food, at least during Restaurant Week, is satisfactory, but similarly fails to leave a strong impression. It's not a bad option if you happen to be in the area (good dining options in the Theater District are second to none), but I doubt it's worth a return visit.",7,3,3

Their ""escargot"" tastes like they picked it up from the alley and boiled it. Horrible!Drinks: dirty martini - yuk! How can you go wrong with a dirty martini? Easy- bad olive juice and olives! Oh and the waiter gave me an attitude about it, he walked away leaving me talking to he air and brought the wine list. Mind you, I was polite the entire time! I'm always polite even when I'm unhappy about food. My friend had the chicken which was burned, sauce heavy, dark and just bad. But we were starved so he ate some of it. His side dish- some type of pasta- was tasteless, bland, literally no flavor! They must not believe in salt. My orecchiette (Italian pasta nevertheless) was so bland!!! I could have eaten my napkin and that had more flavor! The grumpy waiter noticed I wasn't eating my food, he offered to change it for something else. I appreciated that but I was already so turned off I wasn't sure - but he suggested the ravioli ( again....Italian!) I went for it. Aaaaand even worse than the one before! Are you kidding me??? Over cooked ravioli, the ricotta oozed out, topped with heavy cream, and still lacking in flavor. Ridiculous! I took one bite and left it. Dessert?? They asked- heck no! Bring me my bill!

81,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,6/23/2014,"KenScale: 8.0/10DB Bistro Moderne is a long-standing bistro from the acclaimed chef Daniel Boulud in the Times Square area. Due to its location, I've always viewed it as more a tourist trap than a serious restaurant notwithstanding Boulud's name behind it. On my recent visit, however, I did like most of the dishes I tried. I started out with a couple of appetizers. I liked the texture of beef tartare that came with quail egg and peppers that gave a slightly spicy kick. Escargot fricassee, a dish of chicken oysters, parsley and hazelnuts, was also quite tasty without being overdressed. The restaurant is perhaps best known for its Original DB Burger, a massive sirloin burger filled with braised short ribs, foie gras and black truffle, so obviously I had to try it. While I would still consider Minetta Tavern's Black Label Burger the best burger in town, the DB Burger is definitely not far behind, a sheer decadence that was very juicy and well cooked. Perhaps because I was stuffed from the burger by the time we ordered desserts, but I was underwhelmed by the both items (Rhubarb Clafoutis and Cafe Brulot) compared to the delicious dishes that came before.The restaurant has that modern vibe that seems to cater to tourists hanging out in the Times Square area. It has a full bar with extensive wine collections (not surprising from a Daniel Boulud establishment). Getting a reservation isn't particularly challenging here. I do think DB Bistro Moderne, once you go there with fairly modest expectations, can offer some nice surprises. Just wish the location is a little bit out of the tourist trap zone.",1,,

They offer a good wine list, with a nice range of options.Service was decidedly lackluster, and I'm being overly generous...much like the level of salt in every dish we tried. For example, I'm used to my waiter switching out the white napkin for a dark one when I'm wearing dark pants. Not here! Most importantly, our waiter went missing for much of the dining experience--to the point that one of the other waiters came over a couple of times to ask if she could help us. Okay, now on to the less than spectacular:This place, despite repeated assurances when I called ahead multiple times to check, is most definitely not vegan-friendly...at all! First, there was not a single item on the menu that was vegan! Then, both the waiter and maître d' seemed completely flummoxed by the concept. I'm guessing a similarly clueless discussion went on behind the scenes before the three-course meal emerged (after an extensive delay), consisting of a couple of salads and three scoops of sorbet. With a month's notice and a reminder two days and one day in advance, surely we can come up with something a little more creative and interesting than...salty salad for $160! What is this? The 1980's???  This was a total fail, especially given their assurances BEFORE I ever made the reservation!!If you're in the market for oversalted loup de mer or a rib-stuffed burger garnished with lettered wooden dowels, and care little about service, then this might be your spot.

While we waited for the burger , we were given complimentary polenta with tomato paste and it was yummy !! We also had complimentary bread and butter. When the burger came out , I was impressed by how nice the presentation was. The burger tasted really great because of how unique the patty was.

For our entree, we split the DB Burger and the Kimchi Dumplings with Duck Confit. The former was just alright--the meat was cooked pretty well, but it kind of lacked flavor since the sauce on the bun was the most predominant flavor. The foie gras was pretty unnecessary as well since I barely noticed it in the meat. The duck dish was a touch better; the duck was well prepared and was interestingly paired with the slightly spicy dumplings.The service was decent and the ambiance pretty nice, although it's a bit cramped and you are sitting pretty close to other parties at the restaurant.

91,Wahed K.,"Astoria, NY",669,759,1573,2.0,7/6/2013,"I came here to try the burger cuz I was intrigued by the $32 price tag. The last burger that I splurged on was the Black Label Burger at MT and I am big fan of that burger albeit that was a few years ago. Daniel Boulud is a respectable name in the business, so I figured why not?The good things about this burger are that  1. it is very juicy and 2. the parmesan bun is delicious. However for a burger that is probably one of the most expensive in the city, it falls short - way short of expectations. The sirloin isn't that flavorful. Bland even, compared to some dry aged burgers but somehow does manage to completely overpower the tiny amount of foie gras that's in it. What's even the point of the foie gras if you can't taste it? To a lesser degree, this also applies to the short rib. I only got one or two bites where the flavor of the short rib was discernible.The other issue I have is the way the burger is put together. You know the scene from The Mask when Jim Carrey's jaws literally drop to the floor? I  think I may need a pair jaws like that to bite into this burger. What it lacks in width, it more than makes up in height. Why not make the buns wider and the burger flatter? Guess that would make life a little too easy.At then end of the day, its' not a bad burger but it's simply not good enough to be priced at $32.

A restaurant with a pedigree like this, they fell short a few places. We came on a Monday night, and it was surprisingly busy. We ordered to start the octopus and the appetizer portion of the burrata tortelli. The octopus was tasty, but served completely luke-warm at best. When the dish is called ""charred octopus"" you expect it to be hot, not room temperature. The tortelli was ok, but there was nothing special about it. Basically 6 little tortellis with minimal,'if any sauce at all on them, for $18. It was not worth the $3 per piece. For the mains, there was a vast improvement. We had the veal and the stripped bass. The veal was rolled and cut into slices, so it was like veal wrapped veal. The outside had a texture like pot roast, just falling apart, and the inside was ground veal. It came along with a fried meat fritter of sorts and sweatbreads. I loved this dish. Wifey had the fish, which had a nice crispy skin and felt very in season with the butternut purée. For dessert, we had the caramel apple, which was both light and unique in presentation. The service, however, was very lacking and not attentive at all. When we receives our check, it was missing the savored discount. Overall, for what this place costs and the pedigree, food should be hot when served, and service should be top of the line.

103,Tony A.,"Chicago, IL",518,32,22,3.0,1/27/2015,"6/10To be completely frank, I am not sure why everyone is raving about this place/the burger here. It was disappointing, and also expensive for no reason :( Dont get me wrong, if the food is good, I am willing to pay a substantial amount of money, but this foie gras burger was not worth it at all. First, my burger was not all that warm. When it came out (it is already cut for you), I was initially impressed with the color because I like my burgers medium rare/medium (some restaurants in nyc dont even know how to cook a burger). However, when I took my much anticipated first bite, the burger was barely warm. I am not sure how they prepare these burgers. Let them rest before serving? Cook a bunch at a time and then reheat to order in the convection oven? Nor sure, but in any case, they should definitely have monitored the burger temperature a lot more. I expected more out of a Chef Boulud restaurant. I thought the short rib inside the burger was very nice and added a different flavor profile than a regular burger (a more chewy texture, reminding me of a pulled pork sandwich). Lastly, the foie gras placed in the middle of the burger was tiny and I did not taste truffle at all. All in all, I came here to try the burger, and decided it is definitely not worth the trip or the price tag. The restaurant itself has a cool ambience. There are two areas connected by a narrow walkway which is probably why some people think it's cramped. I thought it was perfectly fine and cozy. The place looks somewhat retro with the tables and lighting. I enjoyed the ambience and the wait staff.",3,,1

We had a drink at the bar, then were shown to our table prior to our reservation time of 5:30. Delicious food, great service. 4 drinks, coffee, appetizer, entrees, two desserts, coffee. Healthy tip. We sat talking for a bit afterwards. As we were five minutes from leaving, a gentleman (manager?) came to tell us a group was waiting for our table and asked us to leave. We planned to go anyway, were shocked at the approach and request, and walked out. A block away we regretted leaving as we did, regretted not saying something, regretted going in the first place. Lovely experience squashed.While I'm not likely to put down the restaurant without provocation, you can bet money DB will not be mentioned as a meal possibility while in the theater district, or at all, when asked by friends for recommendations. Unprofessional and dismissive at best, and a restaurateur's absolute no-no unless a guest is severely inebriated. We were not.",1,,
108,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1637,64809,3.0,8/4/2012,"The burger here is true food porn, in every way imaginable - it even looks like porn (yelp.com/biz_photos/R15b…).For $32, you get a smallish burger, but it is stuffed with a couple cubes of foie gras and some braised short ribs. It is pretty delicious, but $32? I would much rather they get rid of the foie gras so they could charge a lot less for it. You can barely detect the foie gras anyway, since there is so much going on with the delicious short ribs and the parmesan bun.I got it medium rare, the way they recommend it being served. This is not a good recommendation. I don't mind a slightly bloody burger if the meat is high quality, which it is here, but the problem with getting this burger cooked so bloody is that it made the bottom bun completely soggy and ruined. By the time I was finished (which was very fast since I inhale my food), the bottom bun was almost completely disintegrated, which was pretty unpleasant. My wife got her burger medium well, which looked like a much better option in this case (if you want a rare burger done perfectly, try the lamb burger at The Breslin, which is served on a delicious and more sturdy bun that can hold up to all of the juices running out of the meat).The fries tasted like fancy McDonald's, which is always good, but they weren't nearly hot enough.The burger is definitely the only reason to really come here, but let's discuss the rest of the stuff while we're at it: the complimentary bread is weak, don't bother wasting yourself on it. It is not hot or even warm, and is not soft or very flavorful at all. For dessert, somehow they said they didn't have the Peanut and Banana Napoleon, which looks really good, so we got the Profiteroles instead. These were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.The place is located in a hotel, and it has a very nice, classy atmosphere. The service was actually pretty good too.If you are a true burger fan or can appreciate a good over the top burger, you should definitely come here to at least once to try the burger. Other than that, this place is a little pricy and is probably not worth the trip.",4,1,1

However, I wouldn't say it's worth the money (not even the restaurant week deal) because portions are small and the food is forgettable. I got the tomato soup, which I wasn't feeling, I guess because it was cold, the cod, which was good, but something I could have made myself, and the chocolate peanut gateau, which was no more than 3 bites.

In my mind I was thinking seared foie gras atop of the sirloin beef, but I'm no Micheline chef, so lets dig in and see what all the fuss is about. I tried my first bite, which was a bit difficult without doing the burger smush method, as the burger was presented cut in half and towering high. So, after flattening the burger  to a height I think I can manage, I take my initial bite with an expectation of going to burger utopia. But, instead I ended up in a not so pleasant place of somewhere in the middle of Times Square with a bunch of tourist walking and then quickly making a dead stop stop right in front of me instead of walking off to the side out of my way to look up at a Broadway neon sign or something. Now pissed, I scream...'It's NYC dammit, don't you know we're all in hurry up mode and you need to get the fuq out of everyones way?!?!!'...Then I scream asking my fellow NYers...'How the hell do I get out of Times Sq and to a place better known as foodtopia?!?!?!?'........As I slowly come back to the reality of being  seated in db bistro moderne and completely underwhelmed with this overrated burger, I quickly form an opinion that if given the opportunity to come back to this restaurant I will definitely try something other than the burger.

Very bland!For our entree we asked to split the infamous foie gras burger ($35).

Updated review","Since we're all about trying new foods (and honestly taking the best food photos!), we had to order the famous burger! It is a Sirloin Burger filled with Braised Short Ribs, Foie Gras (WHAT?) and Black Truffle (YES!), served on a Parmesan Bun and served Pommes Frites (fancy fries!). This was one of the best burgers I've ever had! The Foie Gras is mixed within it, so you don't feel like you get a huge chunk - the richness is incorporated very well. The condiments are served just as fancy as you'd expect in a restaurant of this quality. I'd recommend splitting with someone as it is a lot for one person to handle. We also split the Lamb Ragu Pappardelle. It was absolutely fantastic. The sauce was rich and the pasta was al dente. The bread is super yummy to dip in it as well!The pasta was part of a prix-fixe lunch (two courses for $32). None of the appetizers were speaking to me, so I got the Warm Chocolate Fondant - aka fancy lava cake - and MAN it was SO good. Sachiko said she isn't a huge dessert person and she loved it...at least the part she was able to get from me! We each got a cappuccino to go with it - yum!This is a great spot for a business (or  blogger) lunch. Delicious food and you can get in/out within an hour. GET THE BURGER AND WEAR A BIB!",,,
121,Richard Y.,"San Francisco, CA",183,86,19,4.0,8/26/2015,"This place was really conveniently close to our office and a favourite place to entertain clients / visiting dignitaries. Also had quite a few team celebrations, and you can also order from here on Caviar! Needless to say I've engaged with them more times than I can count.DB Bistro, started by the same famous Daniel as the eponymous Daniel on the Upper East Side, serves a more casual / modern variant of ""New America""/French cuisine. Although it carries traditional dishes such as foie gras, patés, steak and such, it presents them with bolder and more innovative flavours -- and in a good way. One of my favourites though has got to be the DB Bistro burger -- it's a massive piece of work, with a freshly-ground burger stuffed with foie gras that is just oozing with juicy deliciousness. I've rarely seen a burger taken to this level before and it's something that my colleagues enjoy a lot as well.Also great wine by the glass/carafe here, very good value and quality. They make a pretty nice Old Fashioned as well.",1,,
122,Robert O.,"Monroe Township, NJ",0,83,0,4.0,1/30/2017,We ate here before seeing a show this past weekend.  I ordered from the $42 restaurant week menu and my wife ordered ala carte.  Ala carte wasn't much more than the special menu if you didn't want desert.  Our starters (Fennel salad and Mushroom soup) were both excellent.  The scallop entree featured perfectly seared giant sea scallops and the beef bourguignon was tasty though the meat was a bit dry.  The madeleines for desert were delicious.Service here was very good and the atmosphere is that of a busy NYC restaurant - nothing extraordinary but pleasant and not too noisy.   We had no problem finishing our meal with enough time to catch our show (figure 90 minutes).  We would likely come back here before another show but wouldn't go out of our way to get here otherwise.,,,
123,Stace C.,"New York, NY",622,302,2086,3.0,11/5/2014,"So disappointed with my group dining experience here. I came last night with a group of 8 people Simply for their special fall menu offering of the stuffed pumpkin drawn by my natural curiosity and the photos. Completely misled, the pumpkin was bland and lacked flavors, the idea was there but lacked execution. I was also let down by their signature burger with Foie gras and short rib- it was juicy but lacked real flavor. The worst case is if a restaurant has mediocre food but good service maybe 3.5 stars?

125,Carmen L.,"New York, NY",8,226,2214,3.0,8/18/2012,I had wish I can be seated inside do that I can see the interior of the restaurant because it looked kind of classy when I first entered. Sadly we were seated at the corner. The waiter introduced the special which were the scallops but we had a different thought and went for the burger and something new on the menu which was the Australian rack of lamb. Our order came later on. The sirlion of the burger tasted tender and not too greasy. It looked too pretty to be a burger. The fries didn't tasted like anything special. One reviewer was right it can be compared to McDonald's fries. The rack of lamb was cooked perfectly but it didn't create no spark in my mouth. For a price of 44 dollars for three pieces of lamb and a 32 dollars burger I would expected some more to it. The service was good. Water was always refilled. Napkin was always folded when we left the table and food was scrapped out of table when cleaning up. :),,,

This is the more affordable bistro version of Daniel (as Boxwood at THE best London hotel, West Hollywood, is of Gordon Ramsay's Michelin-rated venture). (The London in NYC pales in comparison to the LA one with the rooftop pool and balconies and people who read me know that generally I think NYC beats LA in almost every respect, but their London doesn't touch my hometown's location). This is located in the City Club Hotel, a terrific place I refer out of town friends because some of the year, you really can get a deal through booking.com. Beware: bed tax in NYC is a horror. I never stay in hotels but the one time I had to, I was stunned by the 35 or so tax on a 131 room normally 279. Thank God I have the use of an apartment rent-free three months a year!

128,DJ L.,"Woodhaven, NY",5,9,49,4.0,12/27/2015,Went here for our first year wedding anniversary.  The staff was attentive and courteous.  The food was amazing.  My husband had the DB original burger and I had the Coq Au Vin. Both was cooked to perfection. Highly recommend going here for celebratory occasions without breaking the piggybank. Bravo Daniel Boulud!,,,
129,Amy K.,"Maple Shade Township, NJ",4,29,7,5.0,5/20/2016,"My husband and I walked into DB Bistro at 5pm on a Saturday after taking a peek at the menu outside. My husband is familiar with David Boulud and was excited to finally be able to dine at one of his restaurants. I expected to be turned away because we were dressed casually in jeans, t-shirts, and sneakers and even explained my reservations to the hosting staff, but they welcomed us in. Because we didn't have a reservation, we weren't able to be seated at a normal table, but there was an eight seat hi-top table in the bar that we were told had the same menu and service as the normal tables, so we were quickly seated there. The service was impeccable--not too overbearing, but not distant either. We were treated to a lovely bread service and a special breadstick plate, which had two small breadsticks served with a basil aoli and an olive teppenade--the basil aoli was out of this world!My husband ordered the Singapore Sling, which was well prepared. It wasn't to my taste, but he enjoyed it greatly. At $17, I would say it was overpriced, but a) this is new York and b) we were celebrating his birthday and we didn't get any appetizers so I let it slide. My husband ordered the skirt steak, which was incredible. It was well seasoned or marinated (I'm not sure which) and was one of the most tender steaks I've ever had. My husband and I agree that it outshines the twice-as-expensive steaks at our local, high class steakhouse. I would definitely order it the next time we go, if it's still on the menu. It was outstanding. When we were originally seated, our waiter informed us that we could order anything off the prix-fixe menu a la carte, so I ordered the Curried Carrot Risotto. Again, the chef knocked it out of the park with this surprising entree. I was a little hesitant to order it, as I was worried that the curry would be spicy (I don't do well with spicy foods), but there was no spice whatsoever, just a mild yellow curry flavor. The risotto was creamy and cooked to perfection, topped with shreds of chicken confit and chickpeas. The portion was generous and since I have a small stomach, I wasn't able to finish the dish, so the remainder was packed up--I had intended to eat it on the train back to New Jersey, but it was gone long before we left the city. As a final treat, the host staff arranged to surprise my husband with a complimentary birthday dessert--I had mentioned we were celebrating his birthday when we originally arrived at the restaurant, thinking nothing of it, but they decided we were going to celebrate with dessert too!! My husband was brought a decadent chocolate torte with olive oil marscapone and olive oil powder (yes, powder!). The flavors blended together perfectly. The torte was rich, but not overly so--between the two of us, we were able to finish the dessert without feeling overly stuffed or weighed down by the chocolate.Our total came to $88 before tip, which is INCREDIBLY reasonable for an upscale restaurant in New York City, in my opinion. I made sure to thank the staff repeatedly for making our night. My husband and I are still talking about our experience a week later and are eagerly awaiting our next trip to NYC so we can return.",3,,

This is just like that guy (or gal) you went on a date with, who was just so great on paper.  Mr. (Or Miss) Great-on-paper is tantalizing to read about, and ignites your imagination with anticipation of the wonderful experience to come.  In fact, NOT dating this person could only be a cruel deprivation, an opportunity missed.   You can't walk away from this place without ordering this burger, right??  So you go in with great expectations.  When the let down is finally undeniable (after the second limp bite, devoid of flavor), after you've confirmed your taste buds did not temporarily go numb, you start to think, ""Maybe my expectations were too high.  Maybe it was me, not Mr. Great-on-paper.""  No.  It's not you, it's the burger.  This burger would have shattered the lowest of expectations.  The fact that it was $32 (or a $14 supplement to the RW menu) is hysterical.  One possible reason why this burger was so tasteless was that all of the salt that should have gone into it must have somehow ended up in the sauteed skate.  I love skate, and was particularly saddened and dehydrated by the immense amount of salt in each bite.  An expensive restaurant that does not know how to cook and season food properly - just another spectacle in midtown Manhattan, wanting your vote and your patronage, leaving you feeling mislead, lied to, and ultimately, jaded.",13,16,9

The hostess was hospitable and our server was attentive. We (or rather, I) ate all the bread rather quickly and even though we had said no to another serving, we were given another (no complaining here!). My lunch consisted of:Charcuterie Tasting with Cherry Mustard, Pickled Vegetables - very pate-y, but good.  I'm not a mustard connoisseur but as I had described it to my lunch buddy, ""it was aggressive, but not pushy. Like a date who asked to kiss you at the end of the evening, instead of just ramming his tongue down your throat"".

The food however, was mediocre at best. ""The Original"", when presented, made me scratch my head and wonder what all the hype was about. To start, this ""burger"" is tiny! Bun and all, this thing can fit in the palm of your hand (Pictures give the illusion of some colossal burger and folks, it is not!). It was good, but forgettable. The accompanied French fries, for me, resulted in the same monotonous reaction.  The service was very good consisting of a ""main"" waiter and few assistant waiters constantly checking on your dining needs. All in all, an ""A-ok"" experience. Probably would not return here only because the attraction for me was, ""The Original"", burger which, in mho, did not live up to its reputation as, ""one of the best rated burgers in NYC."" Have had much better tasting burgers at other establishments at a fraction of the cost.",3,1,2
139,Sean L.,"New York, NY",59,152,349,2.0,9/1/2013,"Does anyone watch How I Met Your Mother and remember the episode back several years ago when Marshall is on a quest to find the best burger in NYC? I was hoping to relive that at DB Bistro after reading about the crazy burger here, but was ultimately disappointed by the experience.The DB Burger is a combo of  foie gras, short rib, and sirloin. It is pricey, but you feel compelled to try it out because it's part of the standard burger repertoire in Manhattan along with Spotted Pig, Minetta Tavern, etc. Burger size is pretty small, even though it is relatively thick. Furthermore, the burger I got came out relatively cooled (and same with the fries, which tasted rather stale). In terms of the flavoring of the burger, it was nice having the foie gras and short rib add incremental oomph, but in the end the burger was relatively plain. The sirloin didn't taste like much, and even though the meats were moist and juicy, there wasn't a spaz-tastic moment for me. Not salty enough? Need more MSG? There was just a lack of umami sensation.Service was sort of intruding actually - our waiter (manager maybe?) kept on trying to upsell drinks, different appetizers, and the specials. I got the impression he wasn't happy we got as little food as we did...Anyway, a lot of people talk about how awesome the duck confit is, and maybe people should be coming here for the traditional foods instead of burgers.",2,2,

141,John D.,"Manhasset, NY",0,23,6,2.0,1/31/2016,"Having dined at Daniel Boulud's flagship restaurant ""Daniel,"" I had high hopes for this restaurant. Sadly, it was mostly a disappointment. A friend and I attended DB Bistro for the restaurant week menu. Judging from the other tables, most customers had the same idea. The first thing I noticed was the restaurant week menu was different from what was listed on the website. Some appetizers and the desserts were the same, but the main courses were completely changed. I was about a half hour early for my reservation, and decided to take a seat at the bar/lounge area in the entrance of the restaurant. My beverage order was taken quickly, but it took 20 minutes for the drink to be brought to my table. By the time I received my drink, my friend had arrived and my table was ready. It would have been nice to have my drink shortly after it was ordered, as the bar area was not busy, and customers who sat directly at the bar, yet arrived after my order had been taken, were given their drinks first. Once we were seated, one of the first things I noticed was a lack of music. There was simply nothing to be heard other than the loud chatter of the patrons, and the footsteps of the wait staff throughout the cramped dining space. Our server was very attentive, and was possibly the highlight of the evening. I wish I could say the same about the food.Amuse-bouche: Cracker with goat cheese spread. It was fine. Nothing much to say. Simply fine.Appetizer: House Made Terrine. Underwhelming to say the least. Tasted like a cold slice of lunchables meat, with a bell pepper coulis hastily spread across the plate. a frisee separated the two slices on the plate, which combined were smaller than a post-it note. Main: Roasted Pork Loin with Bok Choy. The pork was incredibly well cooked and tender, the onion soubise was acceptable, albeit a bit salty. The Bok Choy was the best part of the course, and was perhaps the finest I've had. This was a hit, but resembled more of an above average home-cooked meal than one from a Daniel Boulud restaurant. Dessert: My friend got the grapefruit pavlova, which was delicious based on the one taste I had. I wish i ordered this, instead of the dark chocolate gateau. There was simply no texture to this dessert. Coffee mousse which had surely been sitting on the now soggy ""biscuit"" for some time. This exemplified the feel of the entire meal. Judging from the courses coming out to other tables, I would say the kitchen had been preparing and plating a lot of these meals ahead of time; the restaurant week menu being the kid brother to the ala cart. The whole service had the feel of a mediocre wedding reception, where each diner was presented with an uninspired version of what they believed to be ordering. We also received an assortment of petit fours after dessert. I was excited to see a macaroon, as they are my favorite French pastry. With disappointment, the macaroon fell apart before I could eat it. The filling  was not settled, and must have melted as the top half of the meringue slipped off the second i picked it up. It was also extremely chewy, and lacked flavor. My friend had the other two--some vanilla cake and citrus gummy-like cube. She said it was ""fine"" and ""very citrusy."" The final one was a chocolate candy filled with caramel, which was quite good. From beginning to end, this was just a lackluster experience from a DB restaurant. I was awe struck at the difference between the 2 michelin star flagship, and this midtown mediocrity. I will not be returning anytime soon.",,,

143,Marqus R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",1512,3605,16316,4.0,7/26/2011,"DB Bistro is really a first rate totally French food, rather smallish bistro with top quality service, a delightful menu and, considering where it is located and what it offers, high but not totally unreasonable prices. It's a favorite of the New York law firms to take their guests and clients for lunch. So, if it can satisfy them and they consider it good enough to impress their clients, you can be assured that it will most likely do the same for you. One caution about the place is that it is small and your chances of getting in during the noon hour lunch rush without a reservation might be slim. The wine list is extensive and one of the most well thought out of wine lists that I have ever come across.I particularly enjoy the superb preparation of their fish, though the portions are on the small side.For what ever reason, maybe because this is America, you'll find a good number of patrons order hamburgers. Why anyone would go to a French restaurant to order a hamburger, I haven't the faintest. It could be just to cover the meat with mayonnaise and ketchup which would be sure to appall any true blooded Frenchmen.",1,2,1

146,Waz W.,"Portland, OR",19,246,320,3.0,5/12/2014,"During Cassie's visit, we had brunch at Daniel Boulud's DB Bistro Moderne with Alice, one her close friends from Taiwan who also happened to be in NYC for work. DB Bistro offers a modern, masculine space with clean lines and chrome finishes. I really wanted to like this place, but it seemed caught somewhere between an approachable bistro and an upscale restaurant. It also doesn't help that it's in Midtown, and I got all grumpy as I was dodging people around the Times Square area. Ugh.DB Bistro has a prix fixe brunch menu with two courses for $26. However, we decided to order a la carte, which had a number of vegetarian options for me to choose from. I decided against a brunch cocktail as $16 for a drink seemed a bit steep. Our waiter brought out warm bread as soon as we had ordered our entrees. The black olive baguette was very good, especially with a little bit of butter.Alice ordered the Coq au Vin ($29), which included bacon, pearl onions, farfalle pasta. I assume it's homemade pasta. Don't know much about preparing Coq au Vin, nor can I remember the last time I've had it. Nicely plated, and Alice seemed to enjoy it.Cassie ordered The Original DB Burger, a $32 monster of a burger. Sirloin burger filled with braised short ribs, foie gras and black truffle. Served on a Parmesan bun with pomme frites on the side. I don't mind if someone around me want to order a burger. It's all about personal food choices, and I realize that vegetarianism or even flexitarianism isn't for everyone. That said, man, this was an intense burger. A meat eater's dream, perhaps? It was too rich for Cassie, and she even gave up on the bun. The pomme frites were great though. Quality potatoes, nice and crispy, very addictive. However, they were most likely fried in some kind of animal fat, which would make them not truly vegetarian. I ordered the Poached Eggs ""En Cocotte"" ($19) with creamy spinach and oyster mushrooms topped with toasted bread crumbs. The eggs were perfectly poached. The mushrooms were flavorful and the breadcrumbs were nice. Unfortunately, the spinach wasn't creamy at all, just some sad wilted spinach sitting in green water. When I was done with my meal, I had more bread and also helped Cassie finish her pomme frites. Overall, a decent brunch experience, especially if you want to catch up over a meal. You do have to brave the Midtown crowds to get here though. The service was good. My entree was a fairly tasty little dish (minus the spinach), but for this price tag, it just seemed somewhat underwhelming. Probably won't be back, especially as there is an abundance of brunch options in NYC.",,,

We had ordered... ~foie gras torchon:super cute on the presentation, it was up to standards, but nothing to give me a mind blowing revelation about food. i'd have preferred to have gotten a nice fatty steak of foie gras, but.. ~legumes de (i'm assuming décembre since that is when i went) again, super loved the presentation, although this salad consisted of two mushroom shavings, two radish shavings, an inch of green bean that was cut in half, half a baby beet, quartered... you get the point. what made this salad awesome was the sauce-- i can't call it a dressing cuz it was so thick, but whatever the sauce and the crumbly stuff was in it, it was super delicious. (photo:: yelp.com/biz_photos/db-b…)~brussel sproutsthey were all tiny and came in this cute little pot ^_^ vbut otherwise.. nothing to write home about. we had actually ordered ~grilled escargot en cocotte as well, however, after waiting... and waiting... and waiting some more... it never came. and at that point, there was enough downs in the service that my date was fed up and just wanted to leave  ours was one of the small tall tables situated on the second tier, next to the host podium.  so we got to watch as ALL the other customers came in and had their jackets. scarves, coats, etc. offered to be hung (which we did not, and as a result, had one hell of time trying to fit all our stuff into the tiny space we were allotted... hell, it might have been a bit easier had ANYONE bothered clearing any of our finished plates.. ok ok, exaggeration. they cleared one or two after 15 minutes of trying to flag someone down.. which is funny when you think about since we're sitting in a prime foot traffic spot. it seemed as if though everyone would pass by our table walking sideways with their back towards us.  so basically we spent the time being ignored. took us minimum 15 minutes to get anyone's attention without being loud and rude, and they forgot one of our dishes.

But I've always wanted to try his other places--eventually I will go to Daniel, but for now, db Bistro Moderne it is. I was taken here for a pre-Broadway show dinner by my boyfriend, and it was a great experience overall. We arrived right on time for our 5pm dinner reservations, and the hostess greeted us courteously before showing us to the coat check woman. She took our coats and handed us a plastic ticket to pick it up later. I'm impressed at how she manages to keep everyone's coats in order, since she took two other couples' jackets at the same time. We were seated in a corner table, with one side being part of a long booth. We were right next to the door that leads to the labyrinth that takes you to the restrooms. Our waitress was professional and prompt. She allowed us ample time to decide what we wanted to eat and drink--no hovering, which I appreciated, even though we took a significant amount of time to choose. We started off with 8oz of Malbec each--$24/mini decanter. The wine was good quality, and I enjoyed it very much. Once we placed our orders, we were given a ""welcome"" dish from the chef--two tiny cubes of mushroom quiche. For appetizers, we got the bone marrow, pumpkin crostini, and tarte flambee. The bone marrow was served on the bone, with toasted bread on the side. The marrow was rich and delicious, but was difficult to pry off the bone. The pumpkin crostini was refreshing, not too pumpkin-y, and the perfect mouthful. The tarte flambee was sort of like a mini flatbread pizza and was also well done. For his main course, my boyfriend got the bacon-crusted halibut, and I got the mushroom risotto. Both choices were wonderful, though they took a while to prepare. Luckily, the wait staff was understanding when we asked them if they could push our orders up since we had a 7pm show to make. The halibut was cooked to perfection, as was the risotto. I've only had better risotto in France, where I think just about everything seems to taste better... But this risotto was creamy, and savory without being overwhelming or too heavy. I could have eaten another serving, easy. For dessert, they gave us three miniature pastries--a blueberry jelly, an orange macaroon, and a little cake. The space's décor was pleasant and offered a mix of contemporary chic (the ""moderne""), and traditional dining. The chic aspects included a triptych of close-up photographs of a bicycle in black and white with accents of bright red that matched the walls. The traditional was present in the carpeting and the mirrors everywhere. The layout of the place is intriguing. Once you walk through the 'exit' door that leads you to the bathroom, you can see through the glass to the tables on the other side of the hallway. But trying to get back to the side entrance is a doozy. I had to help another woman get back to the main part of the restaurant.",4,1,1

The service was great - very attentive but not overbearing. I appreciate the amuse bouche and petite fours that came with our meal - things I always look forward to when going to fancy french restaurants.Appetizer: We shared the artichoke dip which was good. They didn't skimp on the dip, which meant we could use the rest of the bread from our bread basket to polish it off.Entrees: I had the coq au vin and I'm a fan! It was so delicious and savory, and the meat fell off the bone. I would get it again. My boyfriend got their famous burger, which he said was ""good but it's not for people who like burgers"". I'm not quite sure what that means. I guess don't get it if you're a burger lover looking for a good burger. Dessert: We had previously been to Daniel Boulud's other restaurant, Boulud Sud, and I remember the desserts there being very good. DB must really like his desserts because our desserts here were equally delicious and beautifully presented. I got the raspberry and nectarine bellini: so light and refreshing! Not too sweet. Perfection. My boyfriend got what we joked was a fancy smore, toasted marshmallow with dark chocolate and graham ice cream. He liked it though.

To be honest, as you'll see in the earlier reviews, the burger looks more special than it tastes. I wouldn't recommend ordering it unless you are ravenous and want to impress your friends (who will probably think you're disgusting for eating the whole burger).Anyway, I ordered the Lobster salad and it was deliciously light and fresh, as expected since it was a Tuesday. I recommend ordering an appetizer size and pairing their salads with a side of mushrooms or asparagus! The service is great here - I have no complaints.",,,

So we scheduled a return visit over our week get away to take in some shows. We were not disappointed, in fact we ended up going for dinner, then returning the next 2 nights just to try the desserts. On the 4th night after the NYPO, we tried Boulud Sud for dessert after the Symphony.Service was fast, correct and pleasant. Decor was as you'd expect in this class of place in the theater district. If you are expecting Daniel, then this probably won't be your cup of tea. Coat check was quick and efficient, and drinks delivered with speed and the accuracy I would expect. Food was excellent. My wife had some trepidation about the white truffle raviolo with egg, but absolutely loved it after the first bite. I had the beef two ways and it was spectacular.  Apps were small but lively and seasoned just perfect. On our previous visit I had the duck confit. My favorite dish. I must say it was probably one of the best dishes I have ever had. Desserts are out of this world, and the mint ice cream and concord grape are so tasty we had each 3 night is a row. DB bistro will be on our short list for all of our NYC visits.",,,1

Updated review","I went back last night with a couple of friends and the food was excellent as always. However, it was incredibly noisy. It was packed and we had a group of seven people on one side and a group of five on the other. Each table was rowdy and kept getting noisier the more they drank. This isn't a place for that kind of behavior. We asked the Maitre to kindly ask them to keep it down and consider the rest of the diners, to no avail. We spent almost $300.00 ( we were 3 ) so the least we would have liked was to hear one another's conversation. That was very difficult to do. But again, the food is excellent. Maybe the clue is to go during the week.",,,

For some odd reason I keep forgetting the palce exits which is probably the only reason I don't stop by more often. In my last outing to DB my guest and I ordered identical lunches (no fun in that). My otherwise Kosher friend and I ordered a couple of tarte flambes (think think ultra thin sliced onion pizza with bacon and what seemed to me as butter. No red sauce here. Its almost as though one took a pasta carbonara and sans pasta and placed the carbonara sauce on a matzo. But it seems to me that the cold dishes are served at room temperature and the hot dihes are served warm. More on this next time as I will be thinking Yelp review and thus will be far more observant. The staff was very friendly and attentive perhaps because they had little else to do? Wonderful ambiance but after a second visit it becomes evidently more and more dated.  I'm not ready to give-up on DB yet so I'll stop by a few a few more times once the restaurant week madness is over.",,,

It's extremely easy to miss if you're not looking for the slight vertical sign outside, but I would recommend finding it! Came here with a group of 4 on a Sunday afternoon for brunch without a reservation and they were super accommodating in seating us right away. The interior is bright and inviting. Our waitress was very friendly and had no problem in explaining every item on the menu. We all ended up ordering from the Menu du Marche (two course meals). I got the fruit parfait which was outstanding, along with the eggs any style (I got mine scrambled). The eggs came out either extremely runny, or with an added ingredient that I could not quite pin point. I probably would not suggest ordering that way, however someone else in my party got them sunny side up and they were fine.

All six at our table were looking forward to their burgers and after the meal each shared the same sentiment ""I didn't want to say it, but that really wasn't great"".

We came here during restaurant week and perhaps that was a mistake but I expect a restaurant of such caliber to serve the same quality of food during restaurant week that they would during ""regular"" days. So here is a review of the food:1. Lentil soup- ummm bland....tasteless....I didn't even finish my bowl it was so bland 2. Halibut with vegetables- fish was dry....I can't believe it dry....flavor was nice but good flavors can't save dry fish :(3. Chicken cordon bleu- this dish was actually good! The pastry/breading was crisp and the chicken inside was moist with the blue cheese and ham having a subtle flavor. Overall an excellent dish (why the rest of the food couldn't taste like this I don't know)4. Peanut butter chocolate ball dessert- whatever it was it was terrible.....my friend took one bite and pushed her plate away it was so bad. It was basically peanut butter on a plate Service was great and our waiter was very pleasant. The ambiance though is also a huge let down. The restaurant looks like its stuck in the 1980's and looks old and tired...it needs a facelift!!

No truffle oil, not even a hint. More of a whisper of a suggestion. The only nice things about it were the toasted potato buns. Fried were good, yes, but as some dining companions said, we'd rather have had five Shake Shack burgers and McDonald's fries than this. 2. Service: We had a dour-faced waitress.

For starters, I was not asked if I wanted my coat checked (there is a coat check) and then it look more than a few minutes to get water...in fact I only got it after I asked for it. I value service and did not find DB Bistro Moderne very welcoming or friendly.But getting passed that, I will say I enjoyed the drinks and food. The pineapple mojito and the pear drink (the name escapes me) are fantastic. Both seem like they would be super sweet, but they are well balanced. Started with their version of the salmon tartare. It was average - fresh and good, but just average. Definitely try the crispy duck confit. I usually prefer roasted duck breast, however the confit was perfectly crispy on the outside and unbelievably moist on the inside. It was like magic!  The pears and mushrooms were wonderful with the duck.For dessert we tried the lemon tart which was a great palette cleanser - quite refreshing.    Overall, not a bad place to dine or wine but be ready for a pretentious staff.",,,

I had the warm lobster salad (25) dollars, which honestly was tiny, should have been a lobster cocktail, and it was Super SUPER sweet which I was shocked out because it had a chili vinaigrette, think it was going to be tart or spicy but no. Then thinking outside of the box of my norm,  I wanted something that sounded good. I usually dont order fish at restaurants unless its rare fish, but I didn't want steak nor did I want salmon, so I ordered the halibut, and this was the epic fail for me... the halibut was over cooked that it was tough and dry, then the fennel and artichokes vegetables were steamed to DEATH but charcoaled on the outside, so it was was eating crunchy water with no taste, and then the saffron sauce that lined the plate just tasted like mustard, I was sorely not happy but I didn't want to be a diva and make a big deal, so I ate it and thought I need to order something else cause this did NOT hit the spot.So I told the bartender my dilemma and he suggested the foie gras, and to be honest the texture was great, soft/silky but it had no depth of flavor at all, AT ALL. it was flavorless, and the apple-like gelatin sauce on the side was cold. To be honest, I think it would have made the dish 10 times better if the sauce was warm, have luke warm bread, and cold foie gras, and cold sauce, it leave you wanting some flavor profile or pow of surprise that was missing.The bartender apparently told one of the managers (a very nice brunette lady) and we had a nice chat because we both work in food so we got along.

It was such a nice afternoon treat. The place itself is modern and simple - a little cramped in layout. For high-end dining the staff was very friendly and seated me before my father arrived. We had excellent service. To start our meal, I got an extremely fresh Atlantic Salmon Tartare. The portions are, of course, small but I thought this was perfect. I loved the crunch from the brioche with soft, smooth salmon. I chose the pork loin & pork belly duo for my main dish. It was delicious - cooked well, nice flavor. I couldn't justify eating the entire layer of fat, but I did have one bite and called it quits. Fat tastes amazing, duh!My dad chose the salad and Silver Hake. He always ends up choosing fish and he liked it. It was flavorful, light, and satisfying. For our desserts, I chose the Grapefruit Gateaux, delicious honey ice cream - a nice change from regular vanilla. The cake itself was nothing to rave about. Pink grapefruit is my favorite fruit so I did enjoy the little refreshing pieces for topping. Dad had the brownie, typical but good.

(Dish Rating 50%)yelp.com/user_local_phot…yelp.com/user_local_phot…Pretty good burger, but also one of the most disappointing.  Despite use of more elaborate and expensive ingredients, the balance of flavors were off and felt overall the execution was lacking.  Balance doesn't quite work, because the use of over-seasoned short-rib overwhelmed almost everything.  At times it seemed as if I was eating a short-rib sandwich instead of a burger, and the short-rib wasn't very good either.  I've had other burgers that used short rib much more effectively.  While the sirloin beef patty wasn't bad by itself, it was a tad muted in flavor.  Foie gras was excellent, but it wasn't evenly dispersed and the portion appeared to be more on the modest end.  If black truffle wasn't left out entirely, it's presence wasn't noticeably at all.There are some good elements to this burger.  The sirloin beef patty isn't great, but it isn't bad either.  Ordering the burger rare, the ends did come out with a noticeable char.  The beef appeared to be cooked consistently, with a good portion of the meat prepared nicely rare.  Texture of the beef was tender, but the flavor of the meat wasn't particularly high on flavor.  I do not feel a more subtle tasting beef patty like this can work with any condiments that are more robust condiments, which seemed to be the case here.  Juice levels of the beef patty were low, but it was also very low on grease as well.  Sauce of the short-rib was there in abundance, making it almost a messy burger.  The stuffed foie gras is by far the best part of the burger.  If it were just foie gras and the beef patty together, it would have been a much more satisfying dish.  The foie is stuffed inside the beef patty, instead of being placed on top of it.  The quality of the foie is good, quite juicy, soft, and delicate.  The flavor and texture blended well with the beef patty.  Unfortunately, the foie didn't appear dispersed evenly.  Biting into the burger, some bites will yield a good deal of foie, and those bites were the most satisfying.  Most other bites yielded much more of the poorly prepared shortrib, and those were lackluster.  If the burger had no-short rib, it would have worked much better.  Unfortunately the short-rib isn't easy to remove, being stuffed into the beef patty, as opposed to being placed on top. Horseradish mustard was a nice touch.  There was just enough of it to make add a subtle spicy kick to the burger.  I felt it was the second best condiment to the burger.Greens and onion were largely unessential.  There really wasn't enough of it to make a statement at all, especially against the other components of the burger.  It served the purpose of being nothing more than garnish.Bun used is a brioche like bread with poppy seed and onion.  The bread was more dense than I would have liked, and didn't seem to compress too much.  Given the larger quantity of beef, the meat to starch ratio didn't seem off balance.  This was a very filling burger.  It's already larger than your average gourmet burger.  It was heavier, given the foie & short-rib stuffed inside and the denser bun.  I imagine it could be shared by two adult.  It's not the best burger, but it is hearty and satisfying despite the shortcomings.Value is moderatly below average.  I don't mind paying $32 or more if it justifies the enjoyment of the burger, but here it fell short considerably.  ***Other thoughts***The terribly inept service, inappropriate even for a Denny's chain just didn't help at all.  It was without a doubt that the waiters who worked here were far from professional, often disappearing for 10-15 minutes at times, despite the restaurant never being over 1/5 full.  Working on some of the organization issues would really help.",3,1,1

Water glass never went unfilled, servers were very aware and attentive to every need from the start of the meal to the end of the meal. Amuse bouche- Parmesan Crisp with whipped goat cheese. Delicious but teeny tiny. Appetizer- Mushroom Crostini- Slightly under seasoned and 3 small crostini. Not sure what kind of mushrooms were used but the dish was interesting. Typical small bistro portion. Entrees- Braised Lamb Pappardelle was tender, creamy and delicious. Salmon and Diver Sea Scallops were cooked perfectly. Both dishes were slightly under seasoned however we have come to the conclusion that all French bistro fare is under seasoned from Paris to New York. So, perhaps not a critique of DB but of all French bistro fare. Scallops were not quite as hot as I would have liked but were delicious none the less. We did not order dessert as we planned on having dessert after our theater show. Coffee however was delicious and we were pleasantly surprised with complimentary petite fours (cherry gelees, vanilla caneles, yuzu chocolates, and pistacio macarons).

Very nice choice of items on the prefix menu - btw it is different from what you can find online, but the difference was for the better.I had arugula salad, grouper with brussels sprouts and milk chocolate passion-fruit.Arugula salad was good, nothing special, it's arugula after all. But i also tried other appetizers - charcuterie tasting, and fois gras (this one was for extra charge), both were very delicious. The grouper was great, not dry, very juicy and fresh and the side of brussels sprouts - the sauce was amazing. And the dessert was another great dish. The ambience was nice, and service was very good and prompt, too, even though we were a group of 10 people. Very pleased!",,,
