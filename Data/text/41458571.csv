I say ""X"" because, if you didn't already know, Westville is a small local chain with locations in Chelsea, FiDi, East Village, Hudson Square, Dumbo, and the West Village (duh).If you eat out a lot in New York City, you know it can be tough to get your veggies in. When we feel this way, we know a cure is to be found at Westville. Whether for brunch, lunch, or dinner, our favorite thing to order here is a plate or two, or three, of 4 market sides to split with the whole table. We've had just about every fresh veggie on that list, and the seasonal rotations are great too. I am not a die-hard vegetarian or vegan or anything like that, but these veggies are just _that_ good.When we are looking for something else on top of the veggies, you can't go wrong with their Mac & Cheese or Burgers, but seriously, get some market sides too.Only downside is that the prices, while not super high, are not super low either.",3

Not that these are all good things, that's just how it is.*** FOOD ***Pretty good for the price. I'd say the healthier options are more worth it. After all, you should order what they do best. And at Westville, that's the market veggies. The beets and fresh peas and bacon were my favorites.*** DRINKS ***Great selection of refreshing beers and cocktails for the summer and I'm sure they'll transition to a similarly good spread for the fall/winter.*** SERVICE ***Can REALLY be hit or miss.

Everything is extremely fresh and cooked right. I haven't had anything mind blowing but I've also never had anything terrible. Considering the fact that choices in Dumbo are limited unless you want to fork over $40+ for lunch ...Westville is a solid choice at around $15.,1

9,4,9/24/2018,4712,2,"Culver City, CA",Christina P.,3963,3.0,2086,"Things I really enjoyed at Westville:- Most of my meal: I loved that there were so many interesting veggie options and I had a hard time choosing my four items for the market plate. I went with the fried plantains, the Brussels sprouts, the soy long beans, and the mixed mushrooms and all were pretty good. I also had the mango lemonade which tasted nothing like mango, but it was still a pretty tasty lemonade. - The outdoor seating: it was a perfect evening to dine al fresco, and it was a peaceful patio away from the touristy hustle and bustle of the rest of Dumbo. What bugged about Westville:- The lady they had greeting people at the front on a recent Saturday night. I walked in with a smile and a 'hi,' and without making eye contact she snapped 'you can talk to her,' gesturing to a (much nicer) lady standing behind her with an ipad. Then after we checked in with the nicer lady, the mean lady had the awful job of having to show us to our table. There's a glassed-in area that leads to the outdoor patio, and she made a vague gesture from inside to one corner of the patio saying 'you can sit there.' I asked her where she was talking about specifically since she was so far away as to not be helpful at all, but she made the same general gesture, so we just headed to the empty table that was in the vicinity of her rude hand gesture, then she yelled at us from her spot that we were in the wrong place. Ugh! Just an unpleasant way to start the meal. - Though we made a reservation online and came right on time, I got a scoldy email that night saying that we never showed up for our reservation. I responded via Open Table that we had in fact showed up, but all in all the host situation is not on top of their stuff at all, which is really unfortunate for a place that seems to get so busy. So though it was a nice enough meal and there are other items on the menu that I'm eager to try, I'm not so eager to go back to this specific location.",11
10,,7/29/2018,229,,"Brooklyn, NY",Charles B.,42,4.0,223,"What a nice place!  Inside, outside and outside covered dining options here. Deliciously fresh and mostly healthy menu AND they still know how to dish up a tasty spicy margarita and buttermilk fried chicken sandwich with avocado, arugula and chipotle mayo on a Portuguese muffin. My girlfriend decided to make her own market bowl consisting of four vegetables - cauliflower with tahini, artichokes with parmesan, zucchini with cherry tomatoes and mozzarella, and brusells sprouts with honey dijon.  It was quite difficult for her to choose a favorite when I interrogated her for purposes of writing this review, so then I had to sample the array and I completely understood her dilemma.  I would say all were great and that you wouldn't go wrong with placing the very same order.Service was very polite, mostly efficient, and made us very comfortable in the enclosed, but semi-outdoor seating area.  Next time, weather accommodating, we will sit in the fully outside seating area.",

You tease me with your too-hard-to-pass-up-on happy hour menu (not to mention the generous 4-8pm HH time frame). You're humble with your cocktails but damn, your 'BERRY ROADS' is off the chizainnns good; that raspberry purée really hit the spot with the ginger beer. Your 'TRUFFLE FRIES' are legit truffle fume bomb and for that, I'm eternally grateful (you guys, they don't skimp on the truffle so it's the real deal).

As it was a nice day, most of the outdoor seating was already gone, so we opted for inside. Got some eggs benedicts, and you could get it with mixed greens or potatoes, but they never asked. I didn't realize until I got my order and had the greens with it, was kinda craving the potatoes, but decided to just keep it! The Benedict's were on like hash brown potatoes already instead of classic English muffins, and I enjoyed the hash brown potatoes. Food was tasty. The St Germain pitcher of mimosa was not well mixed at all though as the top was quite bubbly and the bottom was very OJ. They could've done better on that.",1

I placed my order for pick up online and popped on the subway and it was ready when I arrived. The interior of the restaurant is lovely: kind of beachy and has a California vibe that is light and airy. They also have an outdoor area to sit and eat as well. I came around 12:25PM and it was pretty packed.My food was waiting for me when I arrived and was already paid for online. You have the option of paying cash when you get there if you'd like as well. The Mac and cheese was divine: so rich and creamy with a crispy ness on top from being in the oven. I loved the cheeses used. It just had such great flavor. The polenta was excellent. The kale was married perfectly inside the grilled polenta which had a kind of nice Smokey flavor from being grilled and was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. This was an excellent meal and the portion sizes were large so I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow! I'm stoked!",

HOWEVER, the food was not good! It was not the warmest because of the tardiness, but it was not good at all! I ordered a turkey burger that came as a blob of meat and I guess asking for avocado literally means put an entire, uncut avocado on a sandwich. Fries were dismal. Utterly disappointed and still hungry. I use Yelp a lot and really read the reviews and I wish that I had seen a review like this in regards to delivery. if you must, go in to the restaurant yourself and skip the delivery.",

It's in a convenient location in DUMBO and there are many tables inside and out. We got to sit at the covered patio (there's also an uncovered patio) and it was lovely! We decided to share the market plate (4 items) plus one a la carte.. We chose the asparagus (with parmesan), mushrooms, sweet potato fries, Ientil hot dish, and cauliflower covered in tahini (as the a la carte).. Everything was delicious and you can tell the quality is fresh and the ingredients are good. We felt healthy after a lot of NYC foodie adventures so it was a great way to reset.

The meats were yummy, but the vegetables were truly the best I've had at any restaurant and the star of the show. Perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious sauces. I'm still dreaming about my zucchini. We left full and super satisfied, but not bloated.

Just to offer more convenience...Well having that said. I have never had such a basic cobb salad void of creativity or love. Just greens, chopped bacon chopped chicken some blue cheese and half an avocado  thrown in... THATS IT!! No union not a single cranberry. My friends from Europe were happy with their burger, so I am happy. The grits were a new thing for them and they loved it. But my salad ..... but i ABSOLUTELY love the staff.

I went to Westville with my two young sons (ages 6 years old and 9 months old) and two friends to have lunch there today. Towards the end of lunch I took my infant son to the restroom for a change. There was a short line, about 5-6 people ahead of us. While waiting online I was approached by a worker of Westville and he suggested that instead of waiting online I should go use the public bathroom down the street. He made the assumption that I was a non-paying customer and I should use someone else's facilities. He decided to approach the one person online that had a regular to-do t-shirt and shorts while holding his infant son -- very classy.The worker's manager told him that I had been eating in the restaurant already but the worker never apologized and continued to give me instructions to the public bathroom down the street. Mind you, I live in the neighborhood and would frequent this spot -- but not anymore.The food on the other hand was ok. Not sure how you can mess up burgers and fries!!C ya!!",

It was a very nice day out and everyone was at Brooklyn Bridge Park so I would assume this place be very busy (it was). It was a cute place with a lot of seating and a great outdoor space and screened in patio. I was told it would be a 20-30 minute wait but was pleasantly surprised when we really only waited 10 minutes. We were seated quickly, but the quick service aspect stopped there. Granted, the restaurant was really busy but it took nearly 10 minutes to get water, another 10 to order and 20 minutes to get food. When the food arrived, there were no utensils and it took a long time to flag down someone to get them. The food was also not super spectacular. Their chicken cobb salad and fried buttermilk chicken sandwich was really good. However, we were just not too taken with the other dishes. A bit pricey as well. Overall, 2.5 stars.

When we went, we ordered the poached eggs on a kale salad and the roasted brussel sprouts with cucumber lemonade to wash it down. All was really good. The only thing to note is that the brussel sprouts come with a more intense sauce than you'd think. It is layered on there thick and a tad too sweet.For families, it's the perfect spot.

This was on a special brunch specials menu that was separate from the normal menu so I'm not sure if it's always available.The food was amazing. The fried chicken and waffles came not only with those two and its gravy, but it came with a fried egg and gravy on top, with a few green apple slices attached to the side with a toothpick so you can pretend this is a health meal.

Firstly, the amount they served was way more than we expected. It turned out to be over full for both of us after finished all the food in our plates. Secondly, the food here is so fresh and heathy. And my husband love the homemade mango lemonade here, so cheer up drink in hot summer. The atmosphere is neat, it's up to you to choose to sit indoor and outdoor.  Overall, so good experience!

Updated review",383,,"San Francisco, CA",Joanna M.,129,5.0,83,If you're looking for healthy and want to forget that what you're ordering is healthy then you have to try Westville. It's the guilt free restaurant with fresh market vegetables grilled and presented beautifully. I'm a sucker for their Cobb salad with their house vinaigrette. Their market salads are amazing and you can try up to four for a yummy plate with variety like zucchini and tomatoes with mozzarella. I always come here because the food is consistently good and tastes fresh. I've brought my male friends who prefer to eat large quantities of not so healthy food and they love the weekly specials which sometimes include salmon tacos and healthy c. It's a crowd pleaser and doesn't break the bank.,
33,,2/10/2018,194,,"Chicago, IL",Serena S.,204,4.0,98,This restaurant had a great happy hour. They let us add flavors to our margarita so we had mango and strawberry and they weren't too sweet or too strong. They were delicious. They have tons of vegetarian options we had cauliflower chicken wings and veggie chicken nuggets. We also had the sliders and tacos. Every dish was done well and was full of flavor. The owner brought us a free dessert in the end which was a cookie cheesecake. It was a yummy dessert and an overall good experience!,

I would come back if it weren't so expensive.We came on a Sunday night around 6pm, plenty of seats, lots of families and kids running around. They have a lot of options on their menu but we all got the honey chipotle salmon stir, which was a bunch of stir fried veggies over rice with a generous quarter of an avocado and a giant chunk of salmon. Salmon was yummy and crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. Avocado was perfectly ripe and delicious. Stir fry was great, but the sauce kind of felt like the cheap sweet and sour sauce that you get from chinese take out. I wish they used a different sauce but it was still fine. Our individual bill came up to $28 for one bowl of salmon and veggies which imo is expensive but to each their own. Their drinks looked good but we didn't get any.",3

Others at the table also really enjoyed their food, except for the chicken quesadilla. It was nearly impossible to eat, and contained almost no cheese.

This place was such a great find!It's a very small and intimate place with a limited menu. Tables are a bit too close together but once you settle in you don't seem to mind at all. It's a very romantic atmosphere and perfect just for couples not large groups as it's a tiny place. I ordered the cuban sliders and my boyfriend ordered the battered fish and chips. I loved my sliders they were perfection! I tasted my bf's meal and the fish was so fresh and clean in taste! We also ordered two glasses of Chardonnay which was fantastic!Service was excellent, friendly and speedy. I have no complaints about this place.",5

This place is a short walk from the Park, so I took my order to go and headed back to eat by the river. I ordered their new Salmon salad and asked for the tomatoes to be removed. I was pleased when taking my order not only did they agree to this substitution but offered to replace with with cucumbers. I was offered water as I waited and told I could sit at the bar and they would bring my order to me. The salmon was really good and the dressings that came with it made the salad an even better compliment. I'll definitely be returning.",
54,,8/16/2017,199,,"Brooklyn, NY",Suanne L.,810,5.0,956,"Westville is a food haven for vegetarians and vegetable friends. With a menu focused on seasonal produce, I always leave here feeling refreshed, full, and inspired to cook. There are plenty of options for carnivores, and I think this is one of the few places that can please most palates. Cuisine tilts American, with nods to many other cultural spices and flavors. I've been a fan of their Alphabet City location for a long time, so knowing there is a new Westville in Brooklyn makes me an automatic fan. Hubby and I came for an early Sunday 5:30 pm dinner and were seated immediately. The place was actually about half full already and completely full when we left around 6:30 pm, with a small wait out the door. There are three seating areas: the main indoor dining room, the covered patio, and the outdoor patio with picnic tables. The indoor and covered patio areas are best for strollers/wheelchairs, although they may make your table neighbors feel a bit squished. There are two or three neutral bathrooms, one especially large for families and changing tables. I think Westville is nice enough for a casual date or to bring your out of town parents. It's not pretentious, but its bright and charming and very much a neighborhood staple.Service is good, with helpful waitstaff that know the menu in and out and a good attention to allergies. They check in often and are pretty friendly. We always had water and plates were cleared quickly. In addition, the kitchen turn over is great, I remember getting our dishes very quickly. The food is the best! I love love love their market plate, where you pick four different veggies for $17 (as of Aug 2017). The vegetables are super varied, from tofu, to roasted beets with goat cheese and walnuts, watermelon with mint and feta, zucchini with mozz and cherry tomatoes, kimchi cucumbers, dark leafy greens, tofu, potatoes, lentils and beans. The market veggies change seasonally, so it will always mix up if you come frequently. I also like their crab cakes and they make a decent burger and mac and cheese. They also offer cocktails and wine.",1

It was ready on time, so no issues there. I also got to take a look inside and the place is great. Lots of natural light and comfortable seating.The entree came with two sides. I got the roasted beets with goat cheese and the chickpea/eggplant stew. The beets were good but were hardly roasted. Tasted like the kind you get out of a can. The eggplant stew was much better, but not very aesthetically pleasing. Quite the opposite.I'm willing to give Westville another shot, but... maybe on the company's dime.",1

The cheddar & gouda grilled cheese was one of the best I've ever had... and I looooove my grilled cheese. The slider burgers were flame broiled and very fresh. Fries are very good too. My only gripe was they don't have ranch dressing which I love dipping my fries/chicken in, but they made up for it with a garlic aioli (great with the fries) and a chipotle mayo (great with the chicken fingers).",

We were seated promptly, though my violent hunger was not pleased at the promises of ""cauliflower"" and ""kale"" written on the windows since it felt as though I would only be satisfied with a five pound burger and cheese fries piled to the size of a small animal. Luckily enough, I was in for a surprise.The service was excellent - we asked to wait for another friend to show up and ordered drinks in the meantime. They were out of the watermelon juice for one of their signature cocktails, but the pineapple margarita special was a good replacement. Naturally starved by then, we placed an order for the Westville Market which is where you choose four of their freshly made veggie sides that come piled separately on one huge plate. Our choices: brussel sprouts (amazing and whatever sauce they are in, I could swim in it), artichokes with Parmesan (amazing because cheese), roasted butternut squash (cooked perfectly but little seasoning - could've done without these), and zucchini with mozzarella and tomatoes (like a warm veggie salad with cheese - so good, favorite side).There was a little confusion about who was our waiter/waitress because multiple people checked on us, but that simply meant the service was very attentive, and they were patient when our friend took an extra 20 minutes to show up. We finally ordered our mains, and after stuffing myself with delicious vegetables, I didn't leave much room for a huge main so I opted for the Greek salad which comes with balsamic lemon dill vinaigrette (where can I buy this stuff, it's light but flavorful and heavenly), and a grilled baguette with goat cheese which turned out to be the perfect accompaniment - the other salads come with meat instead but I was on a veggie kick. And this was no small salad - it was a big bowl, the size of a small animal (so no need for cheese fries). So if you're feeling like you need to force yourself to eat something green but can't bear the thought of choking down some mysterious green juice, come here, and you'll be satisfied with fun takes on veggies and some fabulous, large-and-in-charge salads. And so my only recommendation to Westville is to get rid of the boring-sounding vegetables written on the windows and write ""yes, this is healthy ,but yes, you will be happy.""",1

Only giving a 4 star this time because the salad I got (cauliflower BBQ quinoa salad) wasn't as good as my regular order (market plate with 4 veggies).

It was definitely a step up above your normal bar food, but it's still pretty much bar food.
