Everyone is very kind to us and hands down they have the best rotisserie chicken around. I can't believe what I'm about to write but it's way better than even Cosco.   And, make a point about checking out specials. Plus being from the Midwest their prime rib is well worth the price. However, the best thing by far are the side dishes. The only problem is trying to decide which sides to get with your main dish. Still can't believe the deal with the Thanksgiving meal. Anyways my only wish is that there would be more Boston Markets.",

I'm just getting off from a long day at work and picking up dinner for my family . I go to place my order and the young lady is speaking so low that I have to keep asking her to repeat herself and every time I do she starts to get an attitude . And as I am about to pay and ask just to verify  if the gravy was in the bag she replied in a sarcastic tone that it was in the bag . I didn't have the energy to say anything in response to her rudeness but it's just annoying having to deal with ppl who can't even smile or say thank you. I just wonder how these employees acted when interviewing because their attitudes suck. But overall I can't complain about the food , it is what it is .",

The young lady who prepared my online order was pleasant, and helpful. Unfortunately the food was cool by the time I got back to my office, which is a 5 minute walk from BM. How they keep the food open during preparation attributed to this. Hopefully they'll work on this issue, because I prefer a hot lunch without having to microwave it.",
7,,3/30/2018,51,,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",Jon F.,0,1.0,26,SCAM ALERT! I got there 45 minutes after they started serving prime rib and they were out of it.  Clearly they're cooking very limited quantities of this particular product hoping that after you've waited on line you'll have resigned yourself to eating there and order the everyday dried out chicken.  Everyone on the line in front of me fell for it but I walked and won't be back. I also noticed that nobody in the restaurant was eating prime rib so one can only wonder if they cooked and at all.,
8,,9/22/2015,97,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Julia W.,62,4.0,125,"Good ol' Boston Market, where everyday is Thanksgiving. I have missed you and your fresh ingredients. The turkey was tasty and stuffing savory.

After paying for both of our meals, the total came out to be $15. I was in shock, considering I've spent twice as much only on myself in other restaurants. The serving sizes were pretty good, too! The mashed potatoes and corn were standard. The stuffing was pretty bland. Overall, it was very unmemorable, but in the best way possible. I don't think I'd ever go to a Boston Market regularly for food, but I wouldn't be opposed to coming again in the distant future. If you choose to eat downstairs, you will find yourself in what feels like a medieval dungeon.",2

At times it didn't taste too fresh but nothing too serious. So today when I ordered food to go I had a bogo coupon buy one meal with a drink and get one meal free. Boston Market has the nerve to charge .25 extra for creamed spinach, yams, glazed carrots and Brussels sprouts. Their new marketing strategy sucks and I'm sure they will lose customers. The yams and the creamed spinach are the better sides to order.They are out of their minds. That is ridiculous. The mac and cheese is gross . I have never gotten their veggies because they look so bland and watery. To think that now I might have to pay extra for regular food which they are calling premier. I thing I might just eat only their chicken forget about the sides.",

14,,9/20/2017,0,2,"Flushing, NY",Jamie V.,0,1.0,5,"Decided to catch a late lunch before going to work with my friend and should of never came here. Chicken was not cooked well, it was pink. The mac and cheese lacked cheese and had a lot of water in it. As I'm getting rung up the girl lets me know my cousin isn't it good but she lets me me know in a nasty way. I felt really uncomfortable. You don't talk to people like that, especially customers. Who is hiring people these days, it's like they're getting them from off the street. This place can't take direction. I asked the girl for BBQ sauce on the side for my chicken and when I sit down I see that she gave me beef gravy. I approach the front counter to let them know that they gave me beef gravy instead of BBQ sauce and three workers look at me without any reaction or even an apology but I still got my sauce eventually. They're hired to serve in a respectful and honest manner but this Boston market lacks it. I am never coming here again, both me and my friend were disgusted with the service and food and the overall stupidity at this Boston market location.",1

The meal prices weren't bad at all - especially compared to Chipotle or other high-end fast food. The coupon though really made it worth it.I ordered an individual meal and it was stunned at how much food they gave me. It was way too much for one person. The chicken was so fresh and really good. They were literally carving the chicken fresh for each order. It came with two sides. I got my favorite Boston Market side ever - creamed spinach - which was quite good. I also got the loaded mashed potatoes. They were OK but too salty for my tastes. I would certainly go back, especially given the relatively low prices and generous portion sizes. I've seen other comments complaining about the service but I had no problems at all. There were plenty of people working there and they were all hard at work and friendly.",1

The sides are tasty (we favor corn, mashed potato, veggies, and cornbread).  But they failed to give us gravy (really?) and initially gave us the wrong pickup order so we had to go back.

Not even close!! Imagine what would be served at a homeless shelter... And then lower your expectations from there!! And no cranberry?? It can't even count as a thanksgiving meal without cranberry.. What were they thinking? Stuffing was from a box obviously, and a generic brand. Turkey was flavorless and rubbery. Mashed potatoes without any flavor at all. And the gravy was some weird yellow, clear liquid... Didn't look or taste a thing like gravy, no idea where it came from. I feel really sorry for the people that ordered a whole meal from here for their family! So if you want a traditional holiday meal, steer clear of this place!!",1

I can tell from the expressions on their face while serving me and their demeanor. I asked for a chicken carver sandwich at first but the girl taking my order did not know what it was.... I explained that its on the menu and pointed to  it. She said ""ohh"" and started to flip through the menu book on instructions how to make my sandwich. I said forget it and order half chicken instead.The chicken I had ordered was still very pink inside and I asked for a replacement. Even the only older worker there agreed with me and asked her co-worker to replace it. She seemed reluctant to do so. Paying for my food is where I got really pissed off there were 5 people on their cell phones in the back. Trust me I counted. Yet despite all this, they told me I had to wait for a cashier to pay. WTF!! Finally one of the people playing on their phones stepped over to ring me up. THE ONLY REASON I stayed was because I had just finished working out and wanted some quick protein, NYSC is right around the corner. I swore to never come back to this piece of shit BOSTON MARKET ever again.Management is really just better off firing everyone of those guys who are not motivated to do anything. I can just tell that their attitude at BOSTON MARKET translates into how much effort they put in at school or at life in general.

38,1,5/18/2013,3,1,"New York, NY",Michael S.,2,3.0,29,"This restaurant must have recently gotten a new manager/owner or new strategy as there is this very over-the-top customer service that is pretty annoying. The staff is forced to go around interrupting everyone's meal to awkwardly ask everyone if they are enjoying their meal and if there is anything they can do. It wouldn't be so bad if the staff weren't clearly so untrained in how to talk to people normally and not like a customer-service robot. Instead of training them properly behind the scenes, the manager interferes with everything the staff is trying to do, just complicating things unnecessarily. The next time I was there, the stuffing was incredibly dry so I called the manager over who was the one questioning customers that day and he was quick to replace it with new stuffing that was ""just made,"" which was very moist. But it makes you wonder why someone wasn't noticing how dry it was as they were scooping it out instead of after I ate it. Gets three stars for attractive atmosphere and typically great food, aside from the spotty stuffing.",
39,1,4/18/2010,17,,"Xinyi District, Taiwan",Nat B.,543,4.0,111,"I've been going to Boston Market locations for over 10 years and I can't think of any bad experiences with the food quality. It's not something you want to eat every day, but it's a tasty fast food take on home-cooking. And for cheap.Tip: Always check their website for printable coupons. Often you'll get $1.00-$2.00 dollars off and individual meal. But they had a coupon for buy one, get one free meals this week. I got 2 half chickens with 5 sides and 2 cornbreads for $10.34. This location tends to suffer from lackluster customer service, usually they are just slow. The longer the line, the slower they move. It's irritating to see your food sitting there getting cold while waiting to pay. But for the price Boston Market is still a great value for food options you can't get elsewhere. It appears they've recently restructured their menu options for individual meals. You pick the meal at a base price of $5.50 for 1/4 chicken or $6.50 for 1/2 chicken which includes the meat and cornbread only. Each side for that meal is $1.00 additional. The previously standard 2-side meal will still come to around $7.50 - $8.50, so prices didn't go up necessarily. I actual like the option for additional sides for only $1.00 each. This might be part of why over the past year they've refused to let me ""split"" my side into 2 items.Just a final note, I hate the door handles here. They are the Boston Market logo, but the material makes it always feel sort of sticky. I have to use my sleeve to open the door.",3

My review is based on a visit on Saturday around 5pm.The charmless prison staff they seemingly imported from directly from hell will not only not even say hello to you, but will respond with scorn depending on your demographics (yes, I observed the uneven treatment of customers).  The gentleman in back of me got his order taken first for no ostensible reason. The staff genuinely seemed funereal and disdainful... maybe a better way to describe it would be to say that they exhibited a simmering bitter anger.  In an ironic twist, I actually got slightly more food than I ordered.  Though the bill did seem slightly inflated.  Oh well.My suggestion is that if you want Boston Market, go to the one on Tenth Avenue near West 57th Street--the staff is MUCH MUCH MUCH better, and the environment is far less toxic.I felt really unhappy at this one on 23rd Street, and will complain to the corporate office.",3

Is actually really good. So much so that I don't think I've ever had a bad experience eating here.I went here sometime towards the end of last year and ate way too much food. Realizing I hadn't eaten all day, and wanting to go to Borders to rack up some rewards points/free coffee, I decided I should come here because it's not that far from Penn Station. I was a little more reserved with food choice this time - I just got an appetizer sampler with Mac & Cheese, Corn, and Stuffing - they give you cornbread, too - and it was fantastic. Add a water and a take home slice of pie and it's just over $9.00. I consider that a bargain, man.I'm going to try to come here more. Know that I'm back at my apartment and I'm pretty much satisfied.

46,1,5/18/2009,45,4,"Brooklyn, NY",Kai B.,63,4.0,116,"Boston Market, with only two locations, is extremely rare in Manhattan. The location I visited was directly outside the 23rd Street Station of the 8th Avenue Subway (C,E).For Manhattan fast food restaurants, this Boston Market was extremely clean, far more than I had expected. The presentation of the main dishes and sides was extremely appetizing. Granted, calling Boston Market fast food is almost an insult. It, along with chains such as Panara Bread, are positioned somewhere between that class and casual dining.Boston Market, like many other chains, has recently lowered its prices, with many lunches and dinners now costing around five dollars. For a mere $5.23 (including tax), I received half a chicken sandwich, a decent serving of stuffing, and a medium beverage (free refills). However, a friend of mine, an experienced Boston Market guest, did note that the serving size has decreased over the years. Nevertheless, my lunch cost me a good three dollars less than I expected.Boston Market also provides catering. This card on the table provided for some good laughs. Note the primary upsell item of the different packages is the level of dinnerware included. The Silver Package comes with disposable dinnerware, the Gold Package comes with ""upgraded disposable dinnerware"", while the Platinum Package comes with china.

51,,3/29/2013,29,,"Brooklyn, NY",Wendy C.,99,2.0,144,The line here is ridiculously long and they seem to always be running low on the sides. I come here for convenience and because there arent much boston markets in the city.,
52,,11/20/2010,176,2,"Manhattan, NY",Evan B.,0,3.0,20,"Boston Market is dope. It's so cheap and you get wicked-sized portions. Don't get me wrong, Boston Market is by no means a ""good"" restaurant, but good is often synonymous with expensive and I am a man of little financial means. It's fast food that's not too fast-foody.I can't compare this location to others because it's the only one I've ever been to. Actually I didn't even know Boston Market existed before this place. But I will say that it's fast, nobody on the staff has ever been a dick to me and it's cleanish. A lot of sleazy folks seem to come here and sit for long periods of time after they're done their meals, but this is New York City, I've seen the same thing happen at Radio Shack.",

Upon walking in, there was a spilled drink all over the floor that seemed to go unnoticed until we were about to leave.  However, we pressed on and ordered the sliced turkey with a couple sides.  The turkey was rather flavorless.  The macaroni was actually pretty good (in that low end restaurant kinda way), and the spinach with garlic wasn't too bad.  Overall, for about $10 a person, you can really find MUCH better food nearby.  The place really just has a grimy vibe to it.",1

58,,1/22/2009,23,,"New York, NY",Evelyn M.,10,1.0,64,"When I think about my experience at this Boston Market, I want to roll my eyes and hurl, at the same time. Here's why: 1) Lack of food: my boyfriend ordered three menu items and was told that all three were out of stock, one of them being BREAD. How is this location staying in business with no food? 2) Poor quality of food: I ordered a half chicken, macaroni and cheese, and veggies. While the chicken was moist and tender, the mac and cheese was very artificial; I could do better at home with a Kraft's Mac N Cheese box. The veggies were the worst: stale, dry, and reminded me of the paper and glue kids used to eat in preschool. My boyfriend's dish included stuffing that had a mushy, yet sticky consistency and corn that looked like it had been left out under a heat lamp for hours. We were highly disappointed and I quote my boyfriend when he said, ""I'm gonna need a protein bar"" post meal since he was still hungry despite the plate of food in front of him. 3) Customer Service: the line to order was LONG and moved slow. It took us 20 min. to order and the servers/ cashier were rude. We barely left on time to catch our movie across the street. Thumbs down, thumbs DOWN!",2

It's not like McD's or BK where if they run out of french fries you just up and go to the next place. No, if they run out of chicken at 7pm on a weeknight, you sit in line and wait 15 minutes for the next batch to finish.That seriously happened.",1
60,1,1/4/2011,92,,"Brooklyn, NY",Betty B.,1,5.0,46,"Best fast food place, my favorite! Yes it is a fast food place, but a slightly more upscale place than other fast food restaurants and healthier since it's not fried. I love that they serve the food on real dishes and metal utensils, not plastic cutlery. The service is always great, very friendly. They even offer to bring your tray to your table if they see you need help such as when you go there with children. And they have a nice sign on the table saying ""We hope you are enjoying your meal, leave the cleanup to us"". Almost like having waiter service. Now to the food, we always order the half chicken which is always cooked to perfection. Never had a bad meal here! The sides are also great. Love their mashed potatoes topped with delicious gravy, string beans, mixed vegetables and mac & cheese. The prices are very reasonable, it's only about $20 for 2 people. If you want to try some really good rotisserie, I highly recommend you give this place a try!",1

The food has all the flavor of Boston Market which is amazing. Great sides, great chicken, great gravy. I'd love to give them a 4 or 5 but when I get a warm home cooked type of meal I'd prefer a warm home styled service which they just can't provide at this particular location. Will definitely be back though.",

As soon as we arrived to pick up our food, five minutes after the suggested time even, we discovered that not only does the staff have lousy attitudes, but they don't even bother to check their online orders. They didn't see our order until we asked about it at the register! After that, they took their precious time getting it together and couldn't make a single apology to try to make up for their mistake, proving that customer service isn't any kind of priority, which would normally be fine since Boston Market isn't some fine establishment or anything, except for the fact that by that point, we had been waiting for our food for 20 minutes when he had ordered it nearly an hour before then. The icing on top of the cake: they left out a couple of sides, meaning we wasted money. Not going here again.",1

Okay, a slightly more upscale version of those two since it sells Vitamin Water and has a display case for sides. But it's no Applebee's or TGIF's. In any case, Boston Market is known for its chicken so I got the quarter chicken with veggies and potatoes which was a good sized meal. The chicken was pretty good. Downstairs we had the whole space to ourselves and it was pretty spacious, albeit a bit claustrophobic. The bathroom on the first floor was kind of gross though and I wish they would've had a bathroom downstairs.",

72,,6/18/2011,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Kim C.,1,2.0,13,"I've eaten here several times. The table area is never clean. I've had to ask my table to be cleared and wiped down several times before I could sit down. The bathroom is a diaster. A new issue is you don't get trays to take your food to the table, so you're screwed if you have several items in your hands. And consequently since there are no longer any trays, customers just leave their dishes when they're finished.  Considering the other issues at this store, I'd bet upper management did away with the trays because they didn't want to have to clean them (go figure) and save money.  I've written to corporate a few times and made suggestions-- the staff is overwhelmed, they need someone soley responsible for cleaning the dining area and keeping the bathrooms cleaned, but the store managers are too tight to spend the budget on hiring people just for these task; and it's stupid because they're losing business due to these issues. Someone from customer service always writes back saying they'll address the issues, but  everytime I go to the store, it's the same messy place. The food is mostly ok. But if the area the public is eating is is that messy, what's the cooking area behing the wall like? Staff quality is variable: from surly clerks, to just ho-hum. The only thing nice is the eye candy walking outside the store when you are in the window seat. You see some hot guys walking to or from David Barton's gym up the street.",
