0,Mery I.,"Berlin, Germany",1,10,4,4.0,9/18/2018,"It's a really pretty place with yummy food but I find it pricey. My favorite thing to get is Zoe's market plate ($17) and I looove it! I get it with poached eggs. The only thing missing in that plate would be Tahini or Hummus. That would make it perffffect in my opinion.My husband likes the banana bread, which I think isn't moist (I know a lot of ppl feel uncomfortable with that word but it had to be said) enough. The coffee is good, my friends say the lemonades are too.",,,
1,Isabelle C.,"New York, NY",439,99,348,2.0,10/24/2018,"2 stars for 2 hands :'-{i should've known what we were in for when the hostess gave us an eye roll within minutes of arriving. after seeing several parties who came after us get seated before us, my friend simply asked to confirm that we were in the queue. we were scoffed at and dismissed as if our question was so unfounded, only to realize a half hour later that our table had in fact been given to someone else. now i can understand a mix-up, but the sass was quite unnecessary!not sure why i chose build your own breakfast ($9), because it only included eggs + toast and the cost of the add-ons was so ridiculous that it would've more than doubled the price to make a regular sandwich. because of this limitation i opted for minimal toppings (bacon + feta), which still managed to total to $18. and what this money got me was embarrassing: hard bread, a single bacon strip, and some leaves scattered over a yellow blob, with not even a knife to cut it. i'm not even trying to be sarcastic, but in all honesty my 10 year old cousin could have prepared it.my friend got the acai bowl ($12), which tasted fine but was nothing more than what you can get at your local deli. i'm not normally a stickler on presentation, but previous yelp pictures show the seeds and fruits arranged in parallel lines while she got a bunch of things sloppily thrown into a bowl. not the hugest deal, but still represented laziness and also made it difficult to tell what was in it. i'd give 1 star, but our waiter was really nice.",3,,
2,Coco D.,"Winters, CA",3,11,24,4.0,9/14/2018,"Came here and got avocado toast and paired it with a latte. Toast was toasted well, crispy but not burnt, and avocado was fresh- ususally the first thing I go to critique with avocado toasts. The toast had added flavor from spices.It gets crowded here as it is a well known restaurant but it creates a fun culture.",1,,
3,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3651,952,2091,4.0,7/26/2018,"The granola was very good. They toasted the granola which added a great flavor and they had a delicious yogurt that accompanied it. I was a little confused on how to eat it because there wasnt that much yogurt and they had milk on the side. Nevertheless, it was delicious. A fun trendy little place where I would return. Looking fwd to trying other items here. Bathrooms were also pretty clean which is always a plus.",12,1,8
4,Ruth U.,"New York, NY",33,175,227,1.0,10/29/2018,"The food here was in a nutshell: disgusting. Waaay overpriced and clearly overhyped on the 'gram. Thought it would resemble Bluestone Lane, which I love. Far from it. Ordered some pesto sandwich dish that tasted bland. Presentation wasn't that great either and my bread was super soggy. Service was slow but not abysmally so, however, waitress was extremely rude and gruff. Would I return? Absolutely not.",,,
5,Kimberly L.,"Denver, CO",28,83,51,4.0,9/9/2018,"Parking -- I mean, is parking anywhere in New York fun? Do people actually drive in New York? This is an easy walk from the subway.Service -- The wait staff here was good, not the best I've had but they were attentive enough. We were seated really quickly (~15 minutes) on a Saturday and we snagged a seat at the window. It was sort of a bar area. It was nice for people watching and preferred this to cramming into a table in the middle of the place. Food -- I've had acai a couple of times in New York and each time I've been disappointed. No one seemed to get it right. That is, until I ordered a bowl from Two Hands. This acai bowl might be one of my favorite ever. It didn't use fruit juice and it wasn't topped with bananas which are huge wins in my book. The texture was just right, not icy and perfectly blended throughout (no chunks!). And it went on for days! This bowl was well worth the price for its size and taste. When I'm back in New York, you'll definitely catch me running here for a bowl. What I won't be ordering again? The chai. It was way too milky and not cold. So maybe skip this and just get an acai bowl!",1,,

9,Annabelle V.,"Brooklyn, NY",272,139,312,5.0,5/5/2018,"Not over-hyped as people say! It's fresh, good quality food made pretty simply. Yes, there will probably be a wait on the weekend but when you have good company you don't mind. The corn fritters are super tasty- two big fritters layered with guacamole and topped with sour cream plus a fresh side salad. I added bacon since they have super thiccc, juicy slices of it there. Definitely try the bacon! Though if you like crispy burnt bacon this won't be for you.As an Australian cafe, they do real AKA fantastic flat whites- even with oat milk. They also have great iced lattes and any other coffee drink.Staff is very friendly and chatty, plus the environment is chill and great for a simple brunch with friends. Come by to enjoy the food and conversation- the aesthetics of the place are just a bonus.",,,
10,Noor H.,"Washington, DC",19,67,113,3.0,7/5/2018,"This is a hip, trendy spot to get a good brunch. My friend and I were visiting nyc and wanted to check this place out and we waited for about 20/30 minutes on a saturday morning for a table. The servers were all friendly, and the avocado toast I ordered was nice, light, and refreshing. It's a cute place to check out if you live for aesthetics like I do, but honestly if you miss out, it's not the end of the world, the food is just alright.",1,1,1
11,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,4.0,4/15/2018,"TLDR: cute breakfast spot with fresh ingredients; friendly staffWas recommended this spot by multiple friends, so finally decided to check it out on a Friday around 10am. The place was somewhat busy, but there were still a few open tables when we walked in. The vibe is bright and fresh, with cute light wooden tables and chairs.My friend and I both ordered the avocado toast ($9) with a side of chorizo ($4). Compared to other brunch spots in NYC, prices were pretty reasonable. The avocado toast was simple yet delicious--a generous amount of smashed avocado seasoned with lemon, olive oil and red pepper flakes on a hearty wholegrain pullman. The chorizo was spicy and flavorful.Overall, enjoyed my breakfast here and would recommend this cute cafe for a quick morning bite.",,,
12,Gloria F.,"New York, NY",109,323,60,2.0,7/1/2018,"Beyond terrible service!!! After a 40 minute wait for our food we said we were in a time crunch and the response was ""it's busy and you need to wait another 10 minutes"".  In Australian time, our waitress said. ""You only ordered 15 mins ago"". Nope. ""We waited for 15 mins for our coffee"" which is a big thumbs down for the cold brew.  On top of it all we a group of 4 ended up waiting for 30 mins for a table because so many two tops kept opening up and maybe 5 groups of 2 were sat first. One would think they could have scooter over two people at a 2 top and we could have been sat. The food was quite good in the end. My banana bread was over the top and they did apologize (finally and comped our drinks).   I upped my rating from my original 1 star because the food is a solid 4 star quality but dings all around on service.",1,1,

14,Hayley T.,"Atlanta, GA",160,40,14,4.0,3/14/2018,"I really loved our brunch at Two Hands! I had been itching to visit for weeks because I wanted to try the banana bread with espresso marscapone. We waited about 45 minutes to an hour to be seated, which is one of my only complaints. This place gets a lot of spillover from SoHo tourists and definitely attracts people with their instagram feed (I mean, have you SEEN their instagram?), so expect a crowd (yes, even on a weekday). I had sourdough with a poached egg, smoked salmon (which came shaped like a rose--it was adorable!), and of course the famed banana bread. Like all NYC brunches, it was pretty run-of-the-mill stuff (except for the banana bread, which I have tried and failed to replicate at home--it was awesome), but simple can be great if done well, and Two Hands does it well! Come for the aesthetic but stay for the solid food.",,,

16,Shelby W.,"Washington, DC",135,149,159,5.0,2/18/2018,"Two Hands looked so good on IG that we had to give it a try on our recent trip to New York.  We woke up pretty early Sunday so we got to the cafe rather early, which was nice because they do not take reservations and we beat the morning crowd. My husband had the Breakfast Roll and I had the Avocado Toast.  Both were excellent.  The lemon really went well with the Avocado Toast.  Our latte and tropical juice (a mixture of cucumber, pineapple I think) were good as well.The service was good and the atmosphere really sold the cafe.  Light and airy decor with amazing food and service.  Two Hands is a must try!",,,1
17,Cassie P.,"New York, NY",223,61,329,3.0,6/23/2018,"I love Two Hands. The vibe is great and the food is delicious.Unfortunately, our lunch experience wasn't the best. We didn't order anything crazy (I got sweet potatoes and one egg) but our food took FOREVER to come out. I mean like 30 minutes. We had 5 minutes to eat before having to go back to work, so it was hard to enjoy the food.",,,1
18,Drew L.,"New York, NY",361,59,87,5.0,7/21/2018,"Please bring back the corn pancake things!! I love them so much. The menu is not the same without them. I would also like write a love letter to the banana bread. For those of you who don't know, the banana bread is super dense and rich and topped with a coffee mascarpone. ITS HEAVENLY. The coffee is average, but the matcha lattes are really good. I would say always ask the waiters for a recommendation because they are never wrong!",,,
19,Hoa Hong N.,"Gaithersburg, MD",160,22,1,4.0,8/26/2018,"Had the avocado toast and chili scrambled egg sandwich, both were flavorful. A tad over priced, can find the same quality level of food elsewhere for a better price. Relaxed and cute set up with good service.",1,,

We came very early - got in the door at 10am on a Saturday. We got one of the last tables for 4 people. The staff were friendly but the menu options were pretty limited (there were 4 versions of avocado, egg and bacon + bread that seemed pretty much the same). The brunch was also on the pricier side, with 15+ for a plate if you wanted meat and egg. Overall it was definitely a cute spot but it started getting really full when we left. It was also pretty chilly in the restaurant. The food was nothing special but pretty good.",,,
21,Alina V.,"New York, NY",237,246,591,4.0,1/23/2018,"My friends and I came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. There was about a half hour wait but they take down your number so they can text you when the table is ready which was great because we could walk around while we waited. To start we got a banana bread to split and it was absolutely delicious! I also ordered a latte which was presented beautifully and tasted great as well. For my meal I got the avocado toast with a poached egg and also added prosciutto. I really enjoyed it, however I do wish the bread was a little softer. The egg on top was cooked perfectly!My friends also tried their market plate and sandwiches as well as sweet potato fries and we all enjoyed our meals. Prices are what you would see on average in the area, and the service was really great!",,,
22,Kimberly T.,"New York, NY",47,123,407,3.0,4/19/2018,"I think this place is fine/pretty good but nothing I'd go out of my way for. It's not expensive at all, and the food is fairly simple. Cooked well, not overly inventive or different. The vibe inside is super casual.",2,,1
23,Sophia Y.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",200,23,22,4.0,6/13/2018,"Came by once and the line was too long, but luckily the second time around the wait was not too bad so my friend and I were able to have brunch here. I remember the first time I saw this restaurant on a must try brunch website and wanted to go because the decor was cute and their açaí bowls looked good. Ironically, I didn't order that because it was a cold day and I wanted something hot. My friend and I came by on a Saturday around 12pm and had a 40 minutes wait time. We went around the area to do some window shopping and by the time we finished our table was ready. The restaurant is a bit small so it was a bit cramped, but one can still move around. The decor on the ceiling was really cute and I wondered if the big fan really works. I ordered the Zoe's marketplace which consisted of sweet potato, avocado, egg, and mini watercress salad. For my eggs I had them sunny side up. My friend ordered the a flat white and corn fritters that came with beets and arugula salad with avocado. Our dishes looked very appealing with an assortment of vegetables on the plate and it tasted as good as it looked. Each part of the dish was well seasoned. However, I did think there was a little bit too much olive oil on my egg which may have been for the salad. Overall, we both enjoyed our meals and were very full for the next few hours despite it not looking like there was a lot at first (for myself, but truth is the plate was big and had lots on it). I would go back again to try the other dishes they offer and the acai bowls. But I wouldn't go with too many people since the place is a bit small and the wait would be very long. And I may also try coming on a weekday when it may be less crowded.",,,
24,Marie T.,"Queens, NY",331,49,45,5.0,8/18/2018,"Schoolyard bowl w/ smoked salmon and ricotta hotcake are two hands down the best thing on the menu ; ) This place is so adorable and pleasant, you feel like your a 1,000 miles away on a lush blue island.",,,
25,Lindsay F.,"Baltimore, MD",743,112,88,4.0,4/24/2018,"I went here last week after a friend raved about the coffee and food. After going I realized she proabably enjoyed how photogenic the food was, than how good it actually was. From the avocado toast, to the lattes, they are all picture perfect! That said, I am used to cramped spaces in NYC, but this was almost too small. Not sure if the Saturdau afternoon crowd is always as loud, but it was too loud for us to handle. We only stayed to drink our drinks and then we were off to eat elsewhere. If you can stand the noise - def a good spot!",1,,1
26,Taylor R.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",548,2,4,5.0,5/9/2018,"If you get a chance to visit this restaurant, YOU MUST GO! My roommate had been raving about this place and insisted we go there for brunch. We went on a beautiful afternoon and everything was perfect. From the food, to the Prince pandora station being played- everything was AMAZING. The service was also nothing short of amazing!  We started off with almond latte's and the banana bread (perfect size to share), which was delicious. And for our meal, we had avocado toast, with a side of bacon and eggs. YUMMMM!  Look, I could go on and on about how awesome this place is, but you need to just go experience it for yourself!My new favorite spot.",1,,
27,Trisa T.,"New York, NY",199,402,586,2.0,10/6/2017,"I totally agree with Morgan G.: ""The food and service at this Aussie café did not live up to its thought-out interior design.""The place is unbelievably cute and has so much going for it. But the service - lacking. And the food - OK but not for the prices! Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Don't be allured by the trendiness alone.

28,Kimmy U.,"New York, NY",220,378,1226,3.0,9/28/2017,"I had high hopes for Two Hands and had been wanting to come ever since I saw someone post a beautiful instagram-worthy acai bowl. If anyone knows me, they know my love for acai bowls, and Two Hands just didn't deliver. The only reason I bumped it to a 3 is because I love the restaurant's decor and vibe. Relaxed atmosphere, tidy set up, but a little cramped. However, 2 stars for the acai bowl. First off, why does mine look different from all the pictures!! I wanted the neat rows of crushed coconut and chia seeds.. but as you can see.. I got coconut flakes, a bed of granola, and a bed of chia seeds. BOONot only was presentation unfortunate, taste was just alright. It was very ICY.. which I've never experienced with an acai bowl. Usually they are similar to a smoothie consistency, maybe slightly thicker. This one was blue in color (also a first) and icy in texture. Not downSorry, won't be coming back for another bowl, but maybeeee possibly something else on the menu",1,,
29,Sophie P.,"Boston, MA",1017,406,1692,3.0,8/2/2017,"This cafe is very, very small & cramped. It's pretty unique in the Little Italy neighborhood, but you will find plenty of cafes more worth your buck in SoHo! ACAI BOWL: For $10, this acai bowl was totally not worth it. Because the acai smoothie is so cold, the granola immediately freezes and is almost inedible (it might be because it is gluten-free too). The smoothie mix of acai, blueberries, banana, and cacao is a dark blue/gray, staining your teeth. Beware if you're on a date! Also, taste-wise, this was really nothing special. They skimp on the fruit but definitely provide plenty of chia & hemp seeds.TWO HANDED BLAT: Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato on whole wheat sourdough is a great deal! For an additional $3 (!!!) you can add a sunny side egg. There is a small side salad that comes with the entree, making this a very complete brunch option perfect FTB (for the boys).+ OUTBACK CAP: A mocha latte accompanied with the Aussie-famous Tim Tam! A unique drink to accompany your brunch that I would come back for.The staff are really not friendly here and do not explain their menu options well (for those who haven't traveled to Australia before, you may have a lot of questions about their drinks).

31,Emily G.,"New York, NY",3,127,18,4.0,7/29/2018,"Not sure what all the bad reviews are about, especially in regard to the service. I showed up around 12:45 on a Sunday -- peak brunch time -- with a friend and had a great time. Yes, we had to wait 45 minutes, but given the popularity of this place, that's to be expected (and about an average wait time for a popular brunch spot on a Sunday at a place that doesn't take reservations). They have a text-based waitlist, so you can walk around the neighborhood to kill time, or sit on the benches outside. They'll text you when your table is 10 minutes from being ready, so you can amble back over when appropriate.Inside the atmosphere is as nice as everyone says it is, and our service was standard. We weren't in a rush, but it certainly didn't take longer than I would normally expect. Given how busy it is, I thought we were going to be rushed through our meal, but I was happy to see that they let us be, enjoying the food and conversation.Between the two of us we enjoyed a latte, flat white, watermelon mint iced tea (yum!), a Brassicas Bowl, and Zoe's Market Plate with scrambled eggs. All were very good and at reasonable prices for NYC brunch.I would certainly return!",,,
32,Ariel D.,"Montreal, Canada",14,144,95,5.0,3/28/2018,Cutest little coffee/restaurant I ever came across. The vibe from this place is just lovely and their açai bowls are out of this world.

35,Jessica S.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,9/9/2018,"Used to love this place. Used to set meetings here all the time so I could go often. Last time I went there the host was so rude. They had nothing available (it was still earlier in the day) apparently a number of deliveries hadn't arrived. We tried to order different food. Still things are unavailable, then the host proceeds to tell me that if I want those things I should go next door because they are cheaper. When I asked why he doesn't want to serve us, I could not get an answer. Me as a customer was being flexible to a restaurant that I wanted to remain at, because I liked. Them: not being hospitable at all to the point it ended with don't come here again. I have never felt worse about an NYC restaurant. So sad that aussies like that are also setting a terrible example for hospitality. This was honestly the rudest and most aggressive service I have ever received.",1,,

I got the avocado toast with a poached egg which was pretty good but a bit bland. But I especially liked the whole grain bread it came on. Make sure to ask for your poached egg runny because the first one I got had a rock solid yolk. I also got the cafe mocha which was delicious and perfectly made.

We went in January and I swear they didn't have the heater on, so we were freezing the whole time. Also, they forgot to include the smoked salmon in my dish, but they quickly fixed that.

My go to beverage will always be the fresh squeezed orange juice. The ladies decided on Sweet Jane (also freshly made), and the turmeric chai latte. I entertained my inner Crocodile Dundee minus the crocodile meat with the Two Hands Beef Burger (M), added avocado - it was absolutely fabulous! The other ladies enjoyed their Corn Fritters with an added poached egg, and Zoe's Market Plate. How I wished there was room left for the Banana Bread. I suppose that will be for my next visit.  In regards to their Tribeca location which is my normal stomping grounds, the Nolita location provides an atmosphere of relaxation and rejuvenation minus the booze to get you in tip-top shape for your Monday grind.  Thank You Two Hands Nolita - Hats Off to You!     P.S.

45,Jennifer L.,"Manhattan, NY",187,359,460,3.0,12/2/2017,"I always passed by this cafe, and now I know why.  There is always a wait here on weekends.  The crowd is usually your average millennial out with a group of friends for the weekend brunch fare.My friend and I stopped by around 2pm on a Sunday, and we had to wait 20 minutes.  We were seated in table that was quite crapped.  If you any semblance of privacy, this is not your place.  You will inevitably end up listening in on your neighbor's conversation, and you can expect the same from them.  I ordered Zoe's market place ($15), which was a plate of quinoa, greens, yams, tomato, avocado and two eggs.  There was nothing on the plate I couldn't make at home without skill needed.  The price is a bit ridiculous for the amount of food, and the fact that it didn't even include any meat!  The food was okay as it tasted exactly how it looked.I just don't understand the hype of this place.  I guess people are obsessed over the ""healthy"" type of food establishments where they can feel better about their Sunday cleanse brunch after their shelled out $20 for an acai bowl and coffee.",1,,

I can't recommend you a time but that Monday afternoon we went, we got lucky and only had two people waiting infront of us. It was about a 10-15 minute wait. The cafe is very aesthically  pleasing but small. Perhaps I hyped it up a lot in my mind before coming so I expected more from the food but it was ok. The guac on my toast wasn't amazing, the veggies were good though. There's a  banana bread that didn't make the picture but it was very tasty, probably my favorite thing from that experience. I think I have to play more with the menu and get some bowls? I want to love this place. Also, the tables are really close to each other it gets kind of weird because we could listen to other people's conversations.",1,,

There was only 4 blueberries and 2 raspberries in total.  The drinks were okay; one of the drinks, the body & soul, is apple, cucumber, lemon and ginger.  I've had better, because this one had too much cucumber and lacked some of the other flavors so it felt over powered.  Same for the sweet Jane drink as it was a mix of different fruits, but I mainly felt like I was drinking pineapple juice.  Overall, everything was good and the service was great.  We were in a rush so we were glad our food didn't take that long, and the service was timely.",1,,

58,Gabby U.,"New York, NY",37,47,36,3.0,7/17/2017,"(I'm giving them 3.5 stars)I wasn't expecting to find this place in the middle of Chinatown/Little Italy! It's interior design is on-point: there are pink and blue hued watercolor paintings on the walls and relaxing twinkling lights above you. They thought every little thing through from the exposed brick to the iron beams to the little post card they attach to your bill (ours had a calming watercolor on it). My roomie and I ordered acai bowls which come filled with yummy toppings (their granola is so freakin good--it has pistachios which is always a win for me). The only complaint about the bowls themselves is that the consistency was not what I'm used to. They were a bit runny, but the flavor over all was pretty good. The one thing that upset me a bit was the fact that their prices on their online menu (which seemed to be up-to-date) did not match the prices in the restaurant. Online it says that the acai bowl is $10 and that the banana bread is $4 but when we got there all the dishes were about $2-3 more expensive (I knew that $10 was too cheap for an acai bowl in nyc). They should really update their online menu (reason why I knocked down half a star).  Regardless, I think I'll definitely come back again, specifically to try their banana bread and one of their lattes (both look so good on their website).",2,1,1

Yes it looked pretty and had some yummy healthy toppings like chia seeds and cocoa nibs, but the acai itself was totally liquidy. It needed to be WAY thicker. I could have drank it with a straw it was so thin. It needed to be colder too. It also could have used some nut butter on top and maybe a bit of honey drizzle.  It was close to being amazing but missed the mark big time. It didn't hit my acai bowl craving. I also got avocado toast which was super yummy. Lots of avocado on there which my son loved. It's his favorite food. The chai latte was pretty too and on point. Loved the cinnamon across the top.

Also, it's much better for YOU to wait for ME than ME to wait for YOU."" Are you kidding me? Is this how you talk to a customer?

We were lucky to be seated immediately, because after maybe 30 minutes, there was a wait for tables. INTERIOR:Super basic vibe. I'm pretty sure we were the only people of color here. On the walls were art prints, with basically just small sayings, which ended up costing at least $99 a piece. But seriously, everyone around us was white.SERVICE:There was something off putting about how nice our server was being to us in relation to how basic the rest of the shop was. She was super friendly, but I think genuinely so. FOOD:My sister ordered a refreshing watermelon juice, which was delicious. My flat white was huge - I think it was a 16oz, which I had trouble finishing in one sitting. We ordered the acai bowl, which was also enormous. It was both of our first experiences with acai in bowl form, so we weren't sure what to expect. Our server assured us that it was delicious. It wasn't delicious, but it was definitely a tasty new experience. It filled us up before we could even get to halfway through, but the insta-friendly shot of the acai bowl was so worth it. It even inspired me to learn how to make my own acai bowls. Toward the end of the bowl, we struggled to finish it because of the consistency and how it looked without all the colorful and pretty toppings. Our server judged us for not finishing the bowl between the two of us. Overall, the experience wasn't bad. It was an unexpected find so close to Chinatown.",4,3,2
88,Cassie J.,"Richmond, Australia",462,59,88,5.0,3/27/2017,"Came here to rave yet again about an Australian cafe - how un-original of me. Don't even care - I loved this place so much. Make sure to get ready for a wait, so if you're super hangry, then don't come here because you'll 100% have to wait at least 30 minutes! My friend lives right above it, so she strolled down to put our name in as we meandered over from the East Village and it was exactly 30 minutes from entering or name to being seated! Very efficient. The food and ambience are NON-PRETENTIOUS, which I really appreciate in a Nolita Aussie cafe, as I think a few of the others are starting to become that way. Now on to the eats: - Banana Bread (contains walnuts): You're absolutely doing this wrong if you don't get this to share for the table. The thick, beefy slice (sorry for using the adjective beefy to describe a sweet item, but seriously this thing was LARGE) was enough to split between 3 people topped with sweet mascarpone and candied buckwheat. I really wouldn't recommend this as your main dish as it's pretty heavy, but hey to each one's own. Pairs nicely with an almond milk flat white :). - BYOB (build your own brekkie): I got poached eggs w/ salmon and avo - perfect and filling. Amazing salmon and the poached eggs were DEF egg-porn worthy. - Chorizo breakfast Sammie: You gotta be a big chorizo fan to enjoy this because the spicy sausage overpowers most of the other flavors, but it is indeed delicious. Could have done with slightly less bun to sandwich ratio, but if that's the worst thing about this sandwich then they're definitely doing something right. Other things that looked good - Acai Bowl, BLAT If I can brave the wait again I'll be back! THANK YOU TWO HANDS! Ily.",1,,1

I arrived on a late Friday afternoon and it was very crowded, but luckily I got a seat with no problem. Service is pretty on point and great here. The staff are super friendly.Matcha Latte -  served in a mason jar, no surprise there. The matcha latte was unsweetened, but very refreshing and great to have on a warm-ish day. It tasted slightly like cinnamon because there was cinnamon sprinkled on top of the matcha latte.""The Good Life Salad"" - baby spinach, carrot, chickpeas, quinoa, golden raisins, sunflower seeds, and avocado with mint pesto.The salad was a little pricey, but very good and super filling! The avocado mint pesto gave the salad a refreshing, but also creamy taste to it and the combination of avocado, mint pesto, and sunflower seeds gave the salad a nutty flavor it. Loved it!Overall, I guess dining solo at Two Hands wasn't so bad after all and in fact, I want to return soon especially this beautiful weather. Two Hands is focused mostly on creating healthy, simple, and delicious food. It's definitely a place worth coming with a friend or someone that enjoys healthy, delicious food along with a relaxing and mellow atmosphere.

And you know what, if you kick in earlier in the day, the wait would be minimum!We essentially got everything that were so ""famous"" online - banana bread, Acai bowl, avocado toast, and the latte-art flat white. Gym rats, please come and order the calorie-friendly blueberry Acai, so refreshing and not sweet whatsoever. The banana bread was a bit mediocre at the first bite, however started to present a scent of banana taste afterwards, love it! My favorite dish was the avocado toast - with the help of pepper on top.Everything was cute and perfect!",13,7,14
94,Betül Y.,"New York, NY",10,13,14,1.0,6/2/2018,"Waited here 1 hour for food which is maybe my fault since I didn't ask what's going on until the next table received their food and these people sat 15 min earlier. Then finally ask what's going on? Learned that our waiter didn't put our order to the system. He got the order again, still waiting. Ask again, still wait for 10 min for food to come out. Total of 20 min after he got order 2nd time. They suggest us to eat free but my husband with principles refused it and I left the place, sad and hungry.",,,
95,Danielle R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,9/21/2017,"I ate at Two Hands on 9/20 for lunch and had a very pleasant experience. Scene / Atmosphere: Quaint, charming Australian cafe. I know this place fills up very fast on the weekends. Drinks: I had an Iced Americano with Almond Milk. The coffee was solid and the almond milk was Califia Barista Blend, which is my favorite brand of almond milk. Food: I had the avocado toast and added a poached egg and heirloom tomatoes. The bread was incredibly fresh and the avocado toast had red pepper flakes, lemon and olive oil, which made it very flavorful. Service: My server was very attentive - I have no complaints. Price: It ended up being $20 for a coffee and breakfast, which is pretty good for an NYC brunch without alcoholic drinks. Overall: I'd definitely recommend Two Hands for lunch - It was a pleasant and relaxing dining experience.",1,,

I got the market place because it looks so healthy and good. It is. It's also fulfilling because it has avocado smash, sweet potato, and healthy. My friend, who gets the most famous acai bow, thinks it's just alright. She feels like drinking smoothies. That's it. The avocado is also famous. But you'll need to add the egg by yourself. Come for the cute place.",1,,
97,Zoë M.,"Rio Rancho, NM",69,31,13,4.0,1/9/2018,Food was good but this is not the place to get an açaí or matcha bowl if you're allergic to nuts. We figured we could substitute almond milk for regular milk to only find out we couldn't. We got the breakfast sandwich and the açaí bowl. Both were $12 each and were good. Açaí bowl mix comes pre packaged so it was still pretty frozen when we received the food. The sandwich had a different taste to it but in a good way.,,,

Only reason not 5 stars is because they have the option of a sandwich with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella and tomato and no balsamic glaze/reduction/dressing. Pretty dumb to not have it as an option, seeing as how cliche and instagramable this place already is. Also as I write this useless review I remember this place doesn't have ANY booze, get a beer and wine license it's not rocket science. So this place is realistically like a 6.5/10.",,,

They don't take reservations, wait was about 45 min. They text you when your table is ready. I'll give the ambiance 5/5, super cute brunch spot with lights hanging from the ceiling. The servers were also super sweet and attentive. We ordered the acai bowl to share and we each got our own entree. When the food came out, we were so excited. Spent like 10 minutes taking photos. Trust me, you'll do the same. Very instagramable. Then when we finally started eating, we had second thoughts. Let's just say, the bread that came with our dish is hard, and tasted stale. I had the egg/bacon/avocado on a roll, my friends had their dish served on sourdough bread and toast and they all complained it was so hard that it was painful to eat. The acai bowl did not impress us either. Food here definitely looks better than it actually taste.",1,,

109,Monica F.,"Manhattan, NY",157,177,127,4.0,6/24/2016,"This place was great! It's really small and not really room for waiting, but luckily we came around 2 for lunch so we didn't have to wait long at all. They have a full breakfast menu including pastries and drinks (coffees, tees, juices) that you can buy a the counter, or you can sit down and order a full meal!The tables are really close together and there isn't a ton of room, so if you don't like that, this place isn't for you. The decor was really funky and unfortunately the menu was in a font that for some reason was SO hard to read! However...The food was fantastic! I got the corn fritters, which were an extremely unique blend of tastes (came with mashed avocado, sour cream and pickled beets on top). I was a little unhappy that they didn't mention it came with crushed red chili pepper as well, which I would have asked them to leave out had I known! But it wasn't too bad. The portion was pretty big for $13 and I had enough left over that I was able to take leftovers home.All of the juices sounded really good, but unfortunately I'm allergic to some vegetables, so my options were limited and the one I chose (cucumber, ginger, spinach and lemon I believe?) was sold out, which was a bummer. But they sounded really good and refreshing!Would definitely come back to try something else or would even get the same thing again!",,,
110,Maggie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",120,174,310,4.0,6/23/2016,"The decoration of this cafe is so cute! I love the cloud lights. I was so tempted to touch them.Came on a Saturday around 12, and there was a 1 hr. No big deal. Just walked around Soho for a bit.There was 3 of us, and we got seated at a square table. So cramped :( But I guess that's what happens when you go to a such a popular cafe to eat.I got the Blat. It was much better than I expected it to be. The apple cider vinaigrette was surprisingly tasty, and I am someone who finds the smell and taste of ACV gross. However, the sourdough bread for my sandwich was so flimsy. Could not really hold up my sandwich to eat, so ended up taking it apart so I could eat it. However, still tasty. Just wished it wasn't so messy.For my drink, I got the Sunday Morning (watermelon, mint juice). The watermelon was perfect for a hot day, but the drink could've used a bit more mint. Also, the drinks were served with a paper straw. Dumbest idea ever, because it was all soggy before I even finished my drink. I had to drink it without the straw towards the end, and those mason jars are not fun to drink out of. Ice fell out and smacked me in the face :( Or maybe I just don't know how to drink",,,
111,Christellane O.,"Warren, NJ",70,1,2,3.0,2/15/2017,"I've seen so many photos from this place on Instagram so I thought I'd give it a try. I tried going here on a Friday and there was a long wait. I went back on a Monday around 1 and there was no wait at all.I saw so many photos of the fake clouds on Insta but when I went there, they didn't have them.  The interior is still really nice though. Anyways, the food is great here. I had the avocado toast and it was perfect. I ordered an iced latte too. I asked to make it sweetened and they brought us syrup. The syrup made the iced latte taste so much better. Overall, the food and drinks are great and I'd definitely come back and order those again.The only bad thing about my experience is that we felt really rushed. The waitress kept looking at me and my friend like she wanted us to leave. But the thing is there wasn't even alot of people in the restaurant. It was just so annoying that she kept on looking at us as we were finishing up our drinks. There were other people there who were just drinking their coffee and taking their time but she didn't seem to mind them. Please next time don't rush your customers!",,,1

Naturally,being the most 'grammable brunch spot in NYC, Two Hands has been on my list of places to check out for a while.And everything was pretty much perfect - unless you're just grabbing coffee to go, be prepared for a pretty long wait. Once you're in; however, waitstaff are super friendly, and service is as efficient as it can be in a tiny cafe. Even still, waiting for food isn't the worst in such an aesthetically pleasing cafe.We tried a bunch of their drinks - the flat white is ON point. This was also my first experience with matcha, so I didn't really know what to expect, but I didn't hate it. I did, however, get the idea that it's an acquired taste, so stay tuned. The food was equally good. I absolutely loved the avo toast - the lemon and red pepper flakes added a lot to the flavor. Next time I'll have to try it with an egg, as well. The açai bowl was also incredible - but be warned, you'll have to floss after you eat it!Ultimately, the only reason I hesitated to give Two Hands a five-star rating was the price - they're good, and they know it, and they charge you exorbitantly for it. Even still, this place is worth the hype, and I can't wait to check out some of the other notorious brunch places in the city.",3,,1

Would recommend coming here on a weekday, because lines on weekends can get a little bit long and the space is small, so it gets cramped. The staff are really nice and accommodating, the coffee drinks are all food, and the food is pretty damn good (and while fairly expensive, is cheaper than similar places). My only complaint is that I would have preferred more toasting when ordering avocado toast (if the toast isn't super fresh and crisp, it just feels like a bunch of mush) but beyond that, no complaints.",,,

He was hosting, seated us, brought us our menus, AND took our orders. The only thing he didn't do was bring us our check... It's like he was working the entire cafe front. The other waiters and waitresses were mostly disengaged.The food overall was pretty good. The chefs are doing alright. I split the avo toast, ricotta toast, and acai bowl with my friend. The avo toast was sadly disappointing. It was very average, nothing too special. I appreciate the pepper flakes but something was missing. The ricotta toast was light, sweet, and picture perfect. My friend was hesitant about trying the ricotta toast but it ended up being her favorite of the 3! The acai bowl was refreshing and the toppings were on point.",,1,

So we found this place on Yelp and they have pretty good reviews so we wanted to go and check it out. The place is cute and love the decorations but the place is a little small. It was pretty full house that day so we waited for like 20 minutes before we get seated.  After we seated, we have to wait another 15 minutes for the servers to come and get our orders. Maybe they were busy so We didn't really care at that time so we just chit chat while waiting for the servers to come. We ordered two sandwiches and two smoothies. The food were  good but not great. It was a little pricey for sandwiches and smoothies. Anyway, I enjoyed the smoothies a lot. Will I recommend my friends to come? Yes, to try and for Instagram lol! Will I come back again?

I loved the ambience and the music--felt romantic in some sense but still so chill and hip. I was excited to try the acai bowl and expected my second time at trying an acai bowl to be just as sweet and awesome as my first at a cafe near NYU Langone. Also ordered the Little Italy sandwich. However, the acai bowl was beyond my expectations and tasted really bitter-added sugar from the box on the table  (that was really meant for coffee and latte) before being able to continue eating it. There were too many nuts in the bowl and not enough fruit, and you could barely taste the flavor of the yogurt. Overall was quite disappointed.The Little Italy sandwich was really good and had some avocado, mozzarella, tomato, and kale leaves. The side salad was really salty and savoring, but the bread was a bit burnt and too hard. Still definitely preferred this over the acai bowl.This was another place where the aesthetics and photos of the food/drinks won over the actual taste of the items.

Just super chill, a lot of natural light and very inviting/trendy. With a lot of cool design (see pics)The SERVICE was top notch. Servers were super friendly and helpful, especially for a first timer. They recommended their favorite dishes and even helped me decide between a couple.FOOD was great. I was just in the mood for some ""normal"" breakfast so I got their breakfast croissant sandwich and loved it. Wasn't the best I've ever had but I'd go back and get it again! Next time I'm here I'll probably be a little more adventurous though and get something out of the box.

Did I mention that this is an Australian themed cafe/restaurant and the waiters/waitresses seem to fit the theme aka they are all from Australia? Hello Aussie accents! ::drool:: Anyway, how could I ever resist avocado toast on a menu? So of course I ordered it. It definitely met my expectations for AVO toast, but it wasn't an ""OMG I need to come back here everyday"" moment. Would I come here again/would I recommend?

But every time I pass by Two Hands, I always get discouraged by the line out the door. I finally decided I'll do the wait with my best friend and we waited for a good ten minutes across the street until we were seated. This place is packed! The service was very rushed and it shows when the waitress rushes you with the menu or takes the plates/bowls as soon as you're done.I had the acai bowl and it was picture perfect and tasted great. The consistency was exactly how it should be (not watery at all) and the right amount of sweetness. My friend had the avocado toast and it was a little tough to eat. My flat white took a while to get to me. I couldn't help but notice that the table next to us got their drinks immediately even though they arrived later. My coffee didn't have the lovely latte art I expected but it was still a great cup of coffee.Overall, cute cafe but I feel like the crowd and the rushed service didn't allow me to enjoy it fully.

Updated review","I wish there was an option to give half stars to places because they'd get a 3 1/2 but oh well, 3 it is.

Nope (I prefer Gitane).Do the striped, paper straws accomplish anything aside from being photogenic and annoyingly dampening while you're still only partway through your iced matcha latte? Nope. So why the 3 stars? The food's solid enough, the space is charming and bright, and the waitstaff are friendly, albeit slow at peak hours.

134,Vivian H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",311,1,1,3.0,8/25/2017,"Overhyped. I was very excited to come here after seeing so many of my friends post cute flicks of the cozy decor and instagramming acai bowls from here but I was disappointed. I got the two handed blat(based off reviews) and the bread was extremely hard and I had to eat everything separately since I couldn't eat it as a sandwich. It was also a little messy to eat; if you were looking for a cute brunch spot to take cute pics at, this is NOT the place- unless you order something a little more neat. It was not worth $16 in my opinion; tasted like a regular overpriced sandwich. My friend, on the other hand, got the corn fritters and liked it. *Also, the prices were pricier than stated on their online menu.Service was okay but could have been better. At times I felt like the waiters were ignoring me e.g when I tried to order and raised my hand, they walked right past me. I did, however, appreciate that they refilled my water.",,,
135,Jade J.,"Brooklyn, NY",378,174,803,1.0,7/18/2016,"Been to the Mott location about 3x but my last visit was super disappointing. This is the place that put me on the whole acai bowl craze. (I've since bought my own acai powder to make acai bowls for a fraction of the price. And my own avocado toasts too.) As such, I opted for the Vernons sandwich instead. The sandwich itself is okay, small but filling. The side salad was composed of yellow and wilted veggies that are way past their prime. Super gross.  I showed the waiter the expired salad and told him that he should let he kitchen know and that is like the check. The poor, clueless guy stuttered that he'd tell the kitchen and left. No apologies. No real acknowledgement. He probably didn't tell anyone anything. Look, I'm not looking for comps and freebies, I just thought the kitchen should know and not serve subpar food to people. I did expect some of know of acknowledgement on their part. But the staff are all Abercrombie-looking youngins straight out of college who moved here from some small town trying to make it in the Big Apple. Yeah, y'all real friendly and smile a lot, but keep it professional. Hey management, I don't need the people around me to look good, I need my food to look good.",6,4,2

It would also be accurate to say ""good looking food by good looking dudes"" ;]I love how generous they are with all the dishes on the menu that feature avocados. They must go through thousands of avocados every day; it's a mystery how they can acquire and store such a large amount of simultaneously perfectly ripe avocados! Someone must have the Midas touch with avocados at Two Hands, which is a trait that I highly covet. The avocado toast is obviously a must (especially with fried egg and roasted tomato). The corn fritters was our waiter's favorite, and it was delicious. I loved the marriage of flavors and textures in this dish, and of course everything tastes infinitely better when avocados are delicately perched atop. The acai bowls are delicious, but make sure you're eating with someone who isn't afraid to tell you that you have little seeds in the nooks and crannies of your teeth. That's the mark of a good friend.expect at least a 30 min wait on the weekends",2,1,
137,Stephanie W.,"New York, NY",210,41,72,4.0,8/19/2016,"I went here on a Friday afternoon and got a table for one. At first, I awkwardly took the seat facing the wall but then moved to face the middle of the cafe. The tables were very close together and I tried not to give the table next to me, too much of my butt as I scooted to the other side of the table. That is when I noticed the cute strung up lights and fluffy clouds hanging from the ceiling! I ordered their famous açaí bowl and a latte. I got both pretty quickly - latte was delivered first of course and it had the standard flower latte art that I love. Then came the beauty, the açaí bowl which was looked more like an art piece than a healthy snack. There were perfect stripes of different toppings like granola, shredded coconut, coco nibs,  chia seeds, raspberries, and blueberries. The açaí part was pretty good, probably the best one I've had on the east coast. I didn't like the dried fruit in the granola though. It was pretty tough to chew and it kept getting stuck in my teeth, among the chia seeds. Overall, I really enjoyed the bowl and each bite was different from the last because of the various toppings. I also cooled me off a bit from the heat. The servers were all very nice, especially the female ones who were super smiley and nice.",2,,

It's very standard health halo food like avocado toast, quinoa with roasted veggies etc. It's very much a place to be seen and see others. Very trendy... lots of very young people...The food is simple, nothing complicated but also done well. It's not sourced perfectly (I'm sorry if you are charging 14$ for scrambled eggs, they can be organic).",1,,

The atmosphere is very modern and cool, but the wait for service and the amount of people was ungodly. I am usually a big fan of matcha lattes and chai, but their matcha was slightly bitter and mostly milk and their chai was mediocre. It was very cinnamon-y and not very sweet at all (if you like sweeter chai). The atmosphere is incredible, but they could work on their drinks. Also, a waiter yelled at me for using a water pitcher for my cup of water instead of the spout...I didn't see the spout until he yelled at me. He could have been nicer about that encounter.",,,

After we were sat, our waiter was super sweet and very helpful. He recommended me the market plate. Excellent choice. The ingredients were fresh, filling, and super delicious. My friend ordered the avo toast, which she says was basic, but what other ways can you serve avo toast? My only issue with avocado toast is that it could be quite difficult to cut, leaving you to get real messy picking up the entire thing and taking a bite out of it! We ordered some matcha lattes which were also great! The vibes were really cool and relaxed, the decor was incredibly cute, well thought out and executed. I only wish that there was more space in between tables, as it was quite tight, and there were awkward walls sticking out that made it quite uncomfortable to sit against. @eyeofshe",1,,
142,Morgan G.,"Manhattan, NY",606,244,720,3.0,7/17/2015,"The food and service at this Aussie café did not live up to its thought-out interior design.Two co-workers and I trekked down to SoHo to try this place for lunch since this place had been on their radar for a while. I was taken aback by the lay of the place - it was designed like a showroom, with fake clouds covering the ceiling and paintings of pineapples garnishing the walls. It was a masterpiece aesthetically. The menu seemed pleasing enough at first glance, especially the drink menu. I was extremely satisfied with their smoothie selection and when the smoothie came out it was what I imagined it would be- smooth, well-blended and delicious. My only quip with my drink was the paper straw it came with - although its stripe pattern is fashionable, its material is not plausible at all. Who decided making straws out of paper was a good idea?! My satisfaction mostly starts and ends with the drinks, since my drink was done before we even ordered. The waiters here had no regard for time. Despite several attempts to grab their attention, we did not order food until at least 10 minutes after this. Each of us had trouble deciding what we wanted, but upon further inspection, we realized something: how simplistic the menu really was. As one colleague put it: ""Put pepper flakes and olive oil on anything and you have half the cafes in New York."" Not to say that food wasn't good - all of us devoured our meal happily. It just wasn't anything unusual or worth an arduous trek. The prices weren't ridiculous, but again, these were all dishes I could make at home (avocado toast, scrambled eggs, etc.) I enjoyed my meal, especially the smoothie, but I don't think I would actively seek it out again.",2,1,1
143,Annie W.,"Two Bridges, Manhattan, NY",260,57,60,3.0,9/18/2017,"I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant. My friend and I had a reservation for 12PM on a Sunday and we understand that restaurants are busy during brunch hours. We waited until 12:20 and asked about our reservation. They said it would only be 10 more minutes. Alright. We sat back down. Then at 12:40, we were starving. We asked again. They said that it was hard to get people out... I pointed over at a table that has been empty for 20 minutes and they finally gave us a table. We got the Gardeners salad and the Avocado toast also the sweet potatoes fries. The flavors were enjoyable but the sweet potatoes fries were soggy which was strange since it should be crispy if it came right out. The salad dressing had a weird pink color that wasn't extremely appetizing. It does taste good but the color was much like pepto bismol. The food did take a little longer than I expected and the price was high for the quality we got. I was expecting a better result and a much better service.",2,,
144,Marielle A.,"Stockholm, Sweden",62,16,3,5.0,7/25/2017,DELICIOUS!!! Had the available bowl and the avo toast with poached egg. Was truly a great breakfast. The acai was a bit too sweet and thin for my taste. (I am used to the thicker ones in Hawaii),,,
145,Norma T.,"Boston, MA",274,97,249,4.0,7/17/2015,"Don't know why other people had such negative experiences here! Maybe I had such a delightful one because I was just stopping by for coffee. Their food seemed intriguing and If hungrier, would most likely have tried the avocado toast or acai bowl, even if it seemed a little overpriced (isnt that just new york though?).Sat down in a cute table for two and pretty quickly, was greeted by a waitress that handed us two menus and water cups with a water pitcher for the table. After she gave us some time we asked for two iced lattes and asked if we were just stopping by for coffee or planned to order food. We said coffee and she did not seem at all annoyed but just removed the menus since we no longer needed them. Iced latte - $4. Would seem pricey to some, but having a starbucks medium latte (the size comparison equivalent of these) being around the same price or higher I am more than happy to receive an iced latte that frankly tasted better which is most important, but also came in a very cute glass mason mug and their signature swirly straw with a cute table to sit in and savor the moment. I can see how to some people, this place would seem like a gimmick. But to me it's being what it intended to be exactly right. A hipster, trendy, aesthetically appealing coffee shop that offers some food options. Don't come here for lunch expecting ample room and choices. Come for a cute coffee date (since limited space and seating, not good for big groups) and order some coffee and share a dish.Will also point out, after we ordered our coffees and received them our waitress did not bring us the check until we asked for it. Which I personally appreciate it. We did not feel rushed to leave and actually could enjoy our time and have a conversation with our afternoon coffee enjoying the cute decor and ambiance.Would certainly come again!",1,1,2

The reason i only gave it a three star was because the BLAT that i ordered was on a bread as hard as a rock. The sandwich itself was good except for the hard bread. My friend ordered an avocado toast and the toast was too hard also. She was struggling to just cut the toast in half with a knife. I also ordered an iced chai latte and it was great!,,,
147,Steph S.,"New York, NY",315,167,422,4.0,5/23/2015,"After constantly seeing two hands on my instagram and how dreamy the place looked with cute mason jar cups and fancy acai bowls. I finally made the trip down here one day. The place definitely reached all my expectations, It was definitely beautiful inside and bigger than what I expected it to be. However, I thought it was a place were you order at the counter and bring it to a table but its not. You do get a server. Unfortunately, our server was not nice. She saw that we were having a nice conversation with the people next to us and kept coming back a lot to take our order. It wasn't crowded so I felt like she didn't need to rush us. When she took our order for juice and we had questions to ask, she didn't know and felt annoyed when asked her. Also, a minute after we ordered our juice my friend got up to go speak with her to change our order and the server rolled her eyes at my friend. At the end of our meal, she tried to make up by being nice after she saw how unhappy we were with her attitude. Like no honey, you already ruined it. The juice and the bowl were like half full when we got them. The juice is mostly foam with juice at the bottom. But since I'm guessing its cold pressed and it could have been more. The flavor we got was pineapple, apple, cucumber, and mint. It was very tart and not sweet which I liked. The acai bowl was absolutely delicious, a little on the small side but still very good. I would be giving it 3 starts if there were similar places in New York City, but since Two Hands is different and does offer a nice experience I'll give it 4.",29,16,26
148,Bekah C.,"Leicester, United Kingdom",76,38,53,5.0,7/18/2016,After living in Melbourne for 6 months you realize why this place is such a hit in NYC but would be a pretty standard cafe in Australia. So glad it's here though! We had a group of 5 and they were able to accommodate us (and pretty quickly too I might add). I got the Avo toast and the Acai bowl. Probably their two most popular dishes and now I know why. Super good atmosphere and service!,1,1,1

150,Meeyeon P.,"Vancouver, Canada",1,43,17,2.0,7/23/2016,"Avocado toast - the toast was way too thick and the bread was bland and I would say near stale on the crust. The avocado portion was the right balance between skimpy and overkill but the seasoning was a touch bland. Over easy egg was cooked to perfection, but overall, the flavors didn't combine well at all. This avo toast is no where near the quality benchmark of By Chloe.

But once you're inside it's like a peaceful oasis from the city.I ordered the acai bowl, which totally fueled me up for the day. Not only did I feel good after eating it, but I had energy for way longer than I usually do with my at-home smoothie. Paired it with a cappuccino, but next time I'll probably get the flat white. Total came to $14, so it was a little pricier than your average spot, but worth it as a treat4As the other reviewers have noted, the waitress here isn't the best and tends to be flighty.

I know we waited for over an hour to be seated, so either come really early or come after the rush hour between 4-5pm when everyone is at work... They offer a variety of coffee and brunch type of food... avocado on toast, soft scrambled eggs on toast, acai bowl, fruit bowls, granolas,GF Banana bread etc.. I didn't get a chance to try out everything but I've been there at least once a day to get my outback cappuccino with a tim tam cookie (life is complete). The coffee is really smooth and cookie is perfect size to dunk with. I always prefer almond milk (.50 extra) over milk any days... They once did it with milk because I forgot to mention that I wanted almond, but they were generous enough to make me another one. They are super nice people (at least 99% of Aussies are anyways). I love the quotes that are hung up and all around the cafe. Fairy like lights are strung on the ceiling with cotton clouds to make it look dreamy... It's really cute. Being from the south... I tend to eat with my hands and pick up my food and most of them here don't - as rustic as it looks. All gals and guys eat their toast with their forks and knives and I'm using my fingers... I just refused conform to such etiquette that is not instill within me. :P",3,1,3

For starters the place was small, not too small or cramped though but it definitely could've been bigger, however it's not a major issue. The decor was really nice though, very tasteful and had a light and airy feeling to it. Also the staff was very polite. I ordered their famous acai bowl and an iced chai tea latte. However, my latte was forgotten and everyone else at my table received their drinks and food long before I received my latte. When I did get the drink, I was disappointed, as it was way too far on the milky side and unfortunately lacked substantial flavor. For $5 I would've expected better. When the acai bowl ($10) came I was very excited. It was presented beautifully, with fresh fruit and I couldn't wait to dig in. However, this was yet another disappointment to me as it was flavorless and watery and the fruit did not taste all that fresh. I've had better at Yogo Delish. Overall though nothing about this place was particularly bad, it was really just lacking. The staff was okay and the place was cute and clean but the food did not taste at all like what I would've expected from the prices. I would probably come back only to try the hot coffee (which I hear is their specialty) but I'll  probably pass on the acai bowl next time.",,,1

There's about 8 two-person tables, tables in the middle, and a tiny bench looking out (which is where I sat). Was a fan of the decor on the inside as well!

The second time around, we just said screw it, and decided not to use them lol.ANYWAYS...We ordered the Avo Toast, Ricotta Toast, and Acai Bowl. Honestly, I have no idea what was so special about these items lol totally not worth the hype I saw on yelp. The Avo toast just tasted like basic avocado, with a hint of spiciness on a bland chunk of bread (you could definitely make this at home if you really wanted to). I recommend getting your egg scrambled on top of the toast because you get a larger portion!I also thought the Acai Bowl wasn't that special either....it definitely looked pretty but tasted very basic (like I said, you could probably make a better one at home with a lot more fruits and toppings). I've had way better Acai Bowls...The Ricotta Bread was okay and I liked the hint of sweetness.I have nothing against this place, even though this review sounds a bit harsh lol.

It was just okay- the bread was really burnt and I couldn't taste the sriracha at all which was disappointing.

Updated review","Really cool little place. Kind of randomly located in China town. Sorry, but reviews gotta be honest! The food I had was just not very good. My fiancé and I got the avocado toast and the ham & Swiss croissant. It wasn't anything unique. I guess toast should just taste like toast, but I was expecting more. I feel like a bad judge on ""Chopped"" but I would have sent the cook home if this was their submission. On top of that, the cost of the meal was too much. Toast with avocado shouldn't be anything over $5. There's a chance I might have just been here on a bad day. Good place to get coffee and just chill though!Good luck!",5,1,1

173,Nelson W.,"New York, NY",453,537,935,3.0,2/3/2015,"An Australian presence in downtown Manhattan is always a welcomed sight.  Certain aspects that are guaranteed from my experience with Aussie establishments would be awesome accents, some version of avocado toast, and great coffee. The popularity of Two Hands shows that this model is definitely working for the masses in this neighborhood, and they are here to stay. With that, hype and expectations are not always met with desirable results. The staff is great but at times the baristas speak as if they are high when making your Americano or Flat White. The avocado toast was good but I would certainly prefer the one at Little Collins in midtown or Cafe Gitane. The coffee beans are supplied by Cafe Integral, which I know to be amazing in its own right.  But whatever the process is in making the drink, the espresso and coffee lack the richness and flavor from a cup made for you directly at Cafe Integral, which is only a few blocks away!With that said, a speakeasy cafe is always a beautiful thing. I have heard complaints about pretentiousness with its vibe and price points, but its nothing that isn't typical Manhattan in my opinion. Besides, who can hate on an establishment, which has a name inspired by the amazing Heath Ledger?",5,2,1

It's free and you never know when you're gonna come back so might as well get the stamps or give it to a friend who lives in the city :)Very cute spot! A great place to meet friends and study! It can get crowded and super busy. My review is for the acai bowl. It was my first time trying the acai bowl and omg! Amazing! So refreshing and it doesn't make you feel bad after eating it. Super healthy and a great light snack! The blueberry and frozen bananas mixed with the acai powder is great and I love the hint of the cacao nibs! The granola adds a great crunch and everything works so well together! The coconut shavings are great too cus it's not the sweeten coconuts but it's light and crunchy. The fruits give a great texture to re dish as well! I love the hemp and chia seeds as well! I was in NYC for two days and during my stay I made sure I went here again before leaving :PI also tried the bacon egg roll with my friends and that was okay. Not as good as I expected but it's not bad. The salad or arugula that came on the side added a nice tang with that dressing it had on it :)The staff is super friendly and easy to talk to! They were so helpful and I can't wait to go again during my NYC trip! :) love this place!Also a friend I went with said this acai bowl was better than the acai bowl she tried in Cali.. So  two hands!,,,

I, myself, am guilty of coming here because I saw the restaurant featured on @new_fork_city, or one of those famous foodie instagram accounts, but BOY WAS THAT A MISTAKE. When I walked in all I saw was middle school and high school aged Long Island-type girls with there phones hovering over their avocado toast. Oh, some  were aggressive enough to even bring a professional camera.     The restaurant itself is understaffed. One male waiter (blonde), even tried to take my plate from under me, while I was still eating. We arrived at Two Hands on a Saturday at 2:30 in the afternoon. Subsequently, the wait for the mediocre, overpriced food (including very undercooked eggs), I could have made myself, was over 25 minutes. I would never return to Two Hands.",6,12,1

178,Jasmine C.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,202,282,5.0,1/3/2016,"I got the avocado toast with a sunny side egg (extra $3), and it was so good! You get a bunch of different flavors, from the lemon to the sweetness of the avocado and then the spicy red pepper flakes, but it's such a good combination. The portion of the toast was also perfect, not too much or too little, perfect for one person. The acai bowl is also really good, I honestly didn't think I would've liked it because it seemed so healthy. The smoothie was really cold and it had banana flavor in it which was good, and mixed with the nuts and the berries. I definitely will be coming back, I'm already craving the avocado toast again.",4,,1

Service was admirable and quick. Good vibe and ambience.I had the avocado toast with a sunny side up egg and it was delish. Also ordered a macchiato but that didn't keep me awake for long...Would I come back? Probably,,,

181,Lorraine C.,"New York, NY",17,14,8,2.0,4/1/2016,"Party of 2 came at 12:30pm on 4/1 Friday and was seated right away. Rock & roll juice - watered down with too much ice. Not worth $6. Prosciutto sandwich - too little prosciutto, tomato, and mozzarella. Lots of thick and hard baguette. Not worth $7. This was the only item on the menu that had meat in it. Avocado toast and acai bowl were delicious and filling though. When a line started forming, 2 waitresses kept pacing back and forth and walking up to our table,  in an obvious attempt to rush us. This place was worth a try but I will not be returning.",,,2

183,Gali D.,"Manhattan, NY",18,16,0,1.0,6/21/2017,I never write reviews but this time I HAD TO. If I can put 0 stars I would put 0 I just had a terrible experience I was looking to go to this place as I heard good things about their food. Didn't get to taste the food as they were closing in 20 Minutes. They were at least 4 tables already sat down that did not even touch their food. The waitress wouldn't even let us sit to have a drink and asked us to order drinks to take out when we still had 20 Minutes...!!!! Now the order: we decided to order to take out despite the rudeness of the waitress and ordered an almond latte : she filled my latte with 100%milk when I am allergic to milk and got a reaction. The second drink was not even filled up with what they call fresh juice that is sitting there all day. Terrible! Do not go there awful service plus it closes at 5pm who closes at 5pm in Manhattan?!! Do not waste your time and go there. Very very disappointed!,1,1,
184,Natasha B.,"Manhattan, NY",39,114,166,3.0,4/18/2016,Waited 1.5 to try this place but it was mediorce and smelled ALOT inside. The eggs and avo toast was average.,,,
185,Raul G.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,4,0,1.0,2/26/2018,"I heard good things about this place. I kept my order fairly simple, my coffee came on time. The couple next to us received their food before us, mind you we were there earlier, that didn't bother me. When I received my food, my plate looked sad. I don't think the waiter even paid attention to my order. He then offers me me a side of avocado or soda, to make up for it. By this point, I'm actually laughing at this twat. The waiter had the guts to charge me for the food. I had to complaint to him, he said he could only do 15% off after talking to his supervisor. Now that was BS. Out of frustration I had to ask a different waiter who easily voided the food. Our server aka twat was really pushing it? Man! Screw this place.",,,
186,Nicholas R.,"Harrison, NJ",223,222,36,3.0,2/20/2016,"Came here on a Warm sunny Saturday with my girlfriend after she begging me to go for weeks.  We love checking out atmospheric brunch places (our favorite meal) in gorgeous New York. Upon arriving to this Australian Cafe,  we see a line out the door... Oh I bet this place is gonna be great! The wait was 45 minutes to an hour for a table for 2..the wait ended up being an hour and twenty minutes. No worries,  they take your phone number and shoot you a text when your table is ready.  This innovative solutions makes it possible to go around shopping while you wait. We finally get seated and ordered a green tea latte... It was delicious! The service was spectacular, servers super friendly and attentive.  We ordered the avocado toast with a sunny side up egg,  an acai bowl and the eggs and toast Combo.The avocado toast seems to be their niche.. Everyone orders it. It's actually a clever idea that's proving to fair well in the market... So you're probably thinking,  why the 3 stars? Well the inside is cramped. Little leg and movement space. I understand it's a cafe in NYC, buy I'm 5'8(short) and I have zero room to move.  Also the prices were laughably high. My two eggs on a single piece of toast with 3 small strips of bacon (one was all white and fatty) was 12 dollars. The acai bowl, is 10. The acai bowl was not that flavorful. It was thawing out and tasted overly watery. My eggs were half raw (looked like the white part of the egg totally uncooked)... I found myself deceiving myself to like the place more because of the environment and concept,  but ultimately, it just isn't a great go to.",,1,1
187,Sadia A.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,75,55,3.0,1/15/2017,"Lovely decor, cozy space, and friendly staff. Had the acai bowl topped with uber-chewy granola, but still decent. Will be getting the avocado toast next time!",,,
188,Annie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,5,4,4.0,12/30/2015,"A great brunch place to eat and catch up with friends! My friend and I waited about 30mins to be seated which wasn't as bad because we expected a longer wait since there were a group of people before us. The place is not that big but it was nicely decorated. The food was delicious and healthy! I had the Avo Toast, a side of smoked salmon and a cup of hot latte. It was one of the best toast I had. I'm not even kidding! The toast was filled with flavors.  It was spread in crushed avocado and seasoning which gave off a spicy taste to the bread. The portion was enough for me to eat and not have leftovers. I thought the side of smoked salmon that I ordered will only be the most two pieces,  but surprisingly it was a generous amount. Overall, I really like this place and I think if you are looking for a brunch place (or just a place to grab food on the go)  you should definitely try this out! I can't wait to go back and try more food from their menu!!",1,1,
189,Anna L.,"East Village, Manhattan, NY",2305,212,646,4.0,11/24/2015,"We got the avocado toast, which was great but I still think the toast from Chalait is better! It was pretty good but very average. Even with the sunny side egg. My friend got a flat white but put too much sugar. The order took about 10 min, not much crowd when we went Tuesday at 10am! They had Aussie accent which was cute. I want to come and try the ACAI bowl next time ! It looks delicious.",2,,1
190,Jessica G.,"Manhattan, NY",118,5,0,2.0,3/6/2017,"I have been wanting to go to this establishment for some time but never had the chance so going in I had some high expectations, especially due to the promotion of Two Hands on Instagram.The food looks better than it tastes and is overpriced. I got a salty version of a bacon egg and cheese (that they didn't bother to melt) on some very hard bread for $15. It wasn't very clear on the menu either that adding a cheese and a meat is separate ($4 and $3 each to be exact), which is a bit outrageous. So basically the bread with egg was $8 alone. The waitress also got my drink wrong giving me black coffee when I asked for a latte and I didn't even get an apology. Overall not worth it at all if you're looking for good tasting food and not just Insta pics.",,,
191,Caitlin C.,"Barcelona, Spain",0,20,6,4.0,8/2/2016,"After hearing all the hype about this place (aka seeing all the Instagram posts of avocado toast), I decided to check it out. I stopped by early on a Saturday morning, and found the place surprisingly quiet. I settled on Zoe's Market Plate and a Flat White. Both were delicious. The market plate was served cold with a nice mix of roasted veggies and eggs. Not a breakfast dish I would have ever thought of, but I enjoyed it to the point where I'll even try to recreate it at home! Service was quick and attentive, but I didn't feel rushed even though prime Saturday brunch time was fast approaching.I will agree that the menu is overpriced, however it seems to be pretty in line with other ""Instagramable brunch"" places in the city.",,,

It needed more honey in my opinion (or be a little sweeter) but i fixed that with stevia (MUST add a little stevia)My friend enjoyed her acai bowl. Acai bowl was sweet/not sweet (i expected it to be sour/tart).I would recommend the ricotta toast- i tried the acai bowl (i would pass on it) it was cute but i like tart stuff and it didnt meet that expectation).Would i come back?Yes!,,,

194,Celeste M.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",211,146,81,2.0,10/5/2015,"I came here after brunch on a Saturday to grab a chai tea latte. The place was extremely busy and there were people waiting outside to grab a bite. My friends and I were only there for beverages so we decided to take our drinks to go. We ordered at the counter and it turns out they were out of chai tea! I'm not a huge coffee drinker so I had limited options. I ended up ordering a spiced rooibos tea that was very good but basically still boiling when I received it. The place looks really cool and the tea was great so the reasons I'm giving this place two stars are as follows:1) If you're out of chai tea, please offer me a substitute such as their spiced matcha green tea latte. If I had know that was an option, I would have appreciated that beverage a lot more than plain hot tea.2) Please have the entire party finish ordering before leaving to make half of the party's beverages.3) Do not have your customers restock items. The counter with all of the creams, sugars, lids and stirrers was out of lids. When we let the barista know, he pointed us to the lids under the counter.Overall, it was a decent cup of tea although I was looking for a tea latte. I don't think there will be a next time as New York is a big enough city to never have to repeat a business if you think you've visited on an off day.",7,2,4
195,Erina W.,"Brooklyn, NY",162,324,175,2.0,3/2/2016,"I was very excited to try this tiny little Aussie cafe in Nolita/Chinatown. I have to say my expectations were high and my boyfriend and I knew it was going to be a long wait when we planned to head over there for brunch on Saturday morning. We were told that it would be an hour wait. We decided to wait but the wait turned out to be well over an hour. I would say about an hour and 20 minutes. Very disappointed that we were misleaded by the wait time and already left a bitter taste in our mouth. Once we were seated, we noted the place was tiny. Decor was nice but you will literally be brushing elbows with the table next to you. I had the green tea latte with almond milk. It was delicious and easily the best green tea latte I've ever had. Points for that. However, it goes downhill from there. My boyfriend and I had an acai bowl to share. He has scrambled eggs on toast with bacon. I had the avocado toast with an over easy egg on top. They were all delicious but why in the world in eggs over toast ($8) and bacon (has to be a side, so $4) amount to $12??? There were no sides like a salad or potatoes. My avocado toast with the egg came up to about the same. Overall, our entire meal with tip and tax came about to $60. Outrageously overpriced for what we had. Such a shame, so much potential. If it was cheaper and had no wait, would come back. Maybe I will return for the novelty of it, but it leaves a crazy dent in my pocket.",,,

I got the bacon and egg sambo but subbed everything that wasnt bacon and egg for avocado - excellent choice but would maybe get it on a different bread. I dont love when my bread it thin and hard but all in all delicious. Their acai bowls are also AWESOME and made beautifully. Saw a few delicious looking muffins and scones also, would definitley come back.

But this place is too noisy and you can always smell the oil from the back of the kitchen. I hope it will be better when the weather gets warmer so that they can open the window.Acai bowl is good. Nothing special you can make it yourself. People come here for ambience and relaxation with healthy food option. Might come back.,,,

I would've given this a higher star if not for the wait time. My friend and I waited for like 40 minutes for our food, and it wasn't even that busy. I then saw other people who came later than us already got their food before we did. They also didn't get my cappuccino at first, but then I reminded them. The staff is nice though. I also feel like the food is a lil overpriced for what you get. Both our portions were pretty small and not very filling. I got the Zoe's Market Plate and it is not worth $15.

199,Aimet M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,20,103,3.0,8/3/2017,"I have wanted to try Two Hands for over a year now and it was just now I realized it was next to my favorite ice cream shop. I've wanted to try their acai bowl strictly because their photos on yelp make it look so appetizing and Acai bowls are honestly one of my favorite foods to eat. However, upon sitting down and reading the menu I realized - along with my brother in law we were going to be a bit disappointment in the quality of the bowl. The presentation is beautiful and esthetically  pleasing - but the fact the acai is powder and now pulp really disappointment us. The consistency was great. Everything about it was tasteful except that since they don't use pulp in their mixture for the acai bowl it tasted weak and watery and seeing that the both of us have expectations of Brazilian acai it was somewhat very disappointing. The bowl looks great but the acai taste was not good for us Brazilians.",,,
