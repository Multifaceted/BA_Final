1,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",517,982,6061,4.0,10/4/2018,"What did we just walk into? This place looks like something u run into while u are on vacation not so much a place u think u would find in midtown Manhattan... First thing I notice is the great happy hour specials decent options for $8 Rosé & Prosecco even better deal for the $6 shots all day JD honey & Fireball good but dangerous options Lolll ! We came in & sat at the bar started with a Pitcher of Lagunitas great beer hard to go wrong this followed by some Fire ball shots later on made for one fun night.  All the drinking of course makes u hungry that Popcorn completely hits the spot so good hard to put it down. Second time around we sat on top where the comfy couches are this time we gave the Rosé a try not bad at all.Service at the bar is quicker, sitting down not bad prices are great during happy hour. Interesting vibe in this place work place meets the frat house, it's loud, rowdy with decent music playing overall a cool place to hang & get drinks.",6,,4

It is super divey and not something I would pick to go to. They serve popcorn with their drinks but it was kinda stale so I didn't eat much. I think they had beer specials during happy hour but I'm not sure because I ordered a vodka soda and it wasn't that cheap and definitely not tito's like they said it would be. Nothing totally wrong with this place, but also nothing great. It was too divey for my taste but some people like that vibe so I can see why it was busy. Also, there aren't too many sport in midtown east for casual after work drinks.",3,2,1
3,Mabelle L.,"Queens, NY",280,284,1513,4.0,8/10/2017,Came here with some coworkers last night. It's a pretty cool bar. Price came out to $60 for 5 of us so the prices weren't too bad. Some pros:They offer unlimited freshly popped free popcornThere's a golf video game half floor below2 Beer pong tables in the basementOverall it seems like everyone has a good time here and it's a nice hang out spot with some friends. It's decently spacious so I never felt too cramped. They also have sitting down tables half flight up. I never had a problem getting the attention of any of the bartenders. Definitely would come back again.,2,1,1
4,Nicole R.,"New York, NY",258,119,4,3.0,1/30/2018,"I somehow always end up here when I'm visiting the city...We got together on a Wednesday night. We got lucky and were able to find lounge seating on the upper level. The beer pong area downstairs was crowded for the entire night. In fact the entire bar only got more crowded as the night went on. When we left at midnight it was full of former frat bros in suits. Surprising for a Wednesday.Snafu offers cheap shots, which makes it a great place to start a wild night. Pitchers, which you might want to buy to make use of the beer pong set up, however, are surprisingly expensive. Too expensive, but I guess that's New York.Ordering at the bar has worked out pretty well for me in the past. Sitting and getting waited on was another story.  A friend of mind can't drink alcohol for medical reasons and so ordered a ginger ale. The waitress brought him a vodka tonic and then argued with him when he said it tasted funny and wasn't the right color. Eventually we got it sorted out, but what a headache!Knowing me, I will probably wind up back here. Definitely a dive, but pretty fun!",1,,

The location has tables and couches upstairs and the lower level has a bar and small tables. Not really getting the theme here, but they scored with the ultra hot Russian bartender.

I immediately noticed it didn't smell like it used to.  They sanded the nasty floors, and overall seemed much scrubbed clean that I remembered. What really helped was the gracious bartender.  Marco. A super attentive guy who completely turned my whole perspective back on what it used to be my favorite neighborhood bar.  I hope Marco's good work just keeps going.  There's more competition coming into the area, and I'd hate to see this legend go.  Oh.

We had a great time catching up and drinking and planning future trips to NOLA and Barcelona and maybe a few other places I can't remember due to the alcohol consumption.  The bartenders were friendly, attentive and happy to keep the drinks flowing.  Seriously though, this place has great specials in the evenings.  $5 shots of Jager, Fireball and Jameson picklebacks.  You can't beat that!",5,7,6

Despite the insanity of the crowds, it was pretty empty inside. My tequila sodas were heavy on the Don Julio, which helped take the chill from my bones and put some color back in my freakin' face. They also had the heat cranked up, which made us never want to leave. Maybe it was the alcohol content of drink number one or their desire to communally eat, but having to flag your bartender down to make you a second drink when it's that slow kind of made wanting a third one an impossibility. Good for a quick strong drink and a fierce hug good bye from my girl at the coat rack!",1,,

Honestly, it was a little dingy/cramped down there, and I preferred being upstairs. BUT there were beer pong tables, so that was nice, I guess.They had happy hour when I was there, so I got a glass of prosecco for 8 bucks. The reason I took off 2 stars was that I didn't realize there was a waitress designated for our group, so I went upstairs to order, to which the waitress came by and sternly told us that we need to give her our orders. I didn't see what the big deal was, because I could've just told the bartender I was part of the birthday party. So when I went back downstairs and needed another drink, the waitress was no where to be seen. I gave it about 20 minutes before I gave up and went upstairs to flag her down.Overall, they have a decent happy hour, but service is pretty subpar.",3,1,1

I have never been to any other bar where people will scream at you to get out just as soon as you walk in the door. Either they hired their staff straight out of the asylum, or psychotics who escaped the asylum pretend to be bouncers here, screaming at you to leave. I came in here to meet a friend. I sit down next to him, and these aforementioned psychotics start whispering to him, like a bunch of high school girls.

He said that the waitress said that as long as the guy didn't do it again he could stay.Seems to me this establishment doesn't really care for the safety and well-being of their staff.

I loooovve sangria so I started with a white sangria and should have ordered prosecco. The sangria was not good at all.....the taste nor size wasn't worth this $10 happy hour price.

I'm not really a big bar guy, so a bar is a bar to me, but the music playing was like they stole my iPhone....I loved that.

If we ordered at the bar, the waitress would inform us we need to order through her since we have a tab with her. Two waitresses were watching us what felt like all night to ensure we ordered through them. I wanted a pitcher of water and the waitresses were nowhere to be found, so I went to the bar to ask for it. The bar back told me I need to order that through my waitress...and asked if we were going to use water for beer pong? It was even an issue to get water! At one point we were all having a great time playing flip cup in the downstairs area and the waitress kept coming to tell us we're only allowed to play beer pong. Not flip cup. Then said if we want to play we had to keep ordering drinks. It really made no sense since flipcup requires more alcohol. There was a group of about 20 of us ordering drinks all night, we shouldn't have gotten that level of service.  For the managers knowledge, we were there Friday August 25.",1,,
34,B S.,"Williamsburg, NY",0,29,0,3.0,12/1/2016,"Scam alert! Last night went with friends and the bartender totally tried to pull some kind of scam. First she overcharged my buddy $0.50 on a beer above the menu price. Nbd, he paid. Then when we got our bill after a few hours of drinking it was an extra dollar on each of my four cocktails. Again no big deal, but the menu said $12 and they charged me $13. Thought it was a mistake and told them. They said it wasn't a mistake and that ""when you get a drink on the rocks it's an extra $1.""  That was when I got pissed and realized this is some kind of scam. First of all, I've drank all over this fair city and never once been charged extra for a drink on the rocks. The entire concept is ridiculous. Second, even if that was the asinine policy of this bar, it isn't on the menu or written anywhere else. So: my belief is that the bar staff last night has a scam where they overcharge people above the menu price and then pocket the extra. Official prices are listed on the menu - that's logic and the law. Anyway, complete bs. I've been to Snafu probably like 5-10 times over the last few years and always liked it well enough. It's a good find in the neighborhood for after work drinks and it's usually pretty low key at the after work hour. Popcorn is also good.

Went there on a few different times, and my last was this past Thursday.The bartenders themselves have absolutely no personality.And completely unskilled. Ladies, you have TWO hands and could probably service faster if you used them both.The male-to-female ratio is probably a 10:1, maybe 15:1 - I WISH I were exaggerating.I was being served bombay sapphire and tonic for $8.50 - great! Wait, why is the well $7.50 then? Wouldn't it make sense to push the well if its $7.50 since its more profitable?Oh right, cause I'm being ripped off, and at least one of my drinks went directly into their tip bucket.I get it, it's a dive, but not a fun one. With the bartenders they've hired (so far I've only seen female bartenders. Is the owner/management sleazy, really using this dated technique or a woman deliberately keeping sexism alive?), its the WORST kind of sausage fest - white collar, old pervy men that want nothing to do with their fellow company and just want to flirt with the blonde bartender - who thereby ignores everyone else.Only feel bad for those coming here and thinking this is a decent dive - its not, but that's likely because there aren't many left in this area of Manhattan or its cause of the tourists. I'd rather hit a pub in the area or go one subway stop south. While I was hoping, REALLY hoping this place would be cool - cause I'm a bartender in the area who has a few happy hour shifts, its also REALLY not happening here when there are phenomenal places elsewhere in Manhattan.",4,1,

It was the perfect pairing to our drinks, and the waitress would bring us another bowl each time we ordered more drinks :) Definitely a great place to check out if you're ever in midtown east!",,,

56,Jai S.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,186,3,1.0,1/22/2016,"Wasn't fond of this place at all. I think it's a place that only wants certain clientele to come in here and frowns upon anyone who is not a part of their ""in crowd"".With that being said, it's mostly men working in the area who hog the bar area so you have to be pretty aggressive to get a drink. With that being said, you'll get dirty looks from the guys because they think it's their spot. I just got one drink....a $5.50 Budweiser, not bad for the area...and left. The bartender seemed friendly enough though, and she waited on me despite how busy it was. I guess she was worth the only star this place gets.",,,

This was my second time ever going here so it is about time I get a chance to write a review on it. Drinks and shots are pretty cheap considering it's a bar in New York. Decent beer selection and the bartenders are nice and very attentive. My bartender made my friend and I two pretty good Irish car bombs. Bathrooms were also pretty clean which is always nice. In general ..this place is actually pretty big. It is also very dark...feels like nighttime even during the day which I did not mind.There are three floors.The top floor is more like a lounge with a fire place, cozy couches and TVs. They also have a server going around to see if you need any to drink and she will bring it right up to you which was very convenient. The middle floor (where you enter the bar) had a standard dive bar like look to it. They have strobe lights for nighttime. The downstairs is big with a pool table and a couple of video games. I did not see anyone down there really. I personally think they should redo it and make another bar down there ..keep the pool table and get rid of the games because I have yet to see anyone playing them. Just a personal opinion. I am considering having my next birthday party here because of all the space this place has and I really liked it. So it is safe to say I will absolutely be back for another visit!",2,2,2

We arrived around 9pm and found it full of people but not yet crowded, which quickly changed between the hours of 9pm-10pm. They have a pretty substantial selection of drinks, including a 16-year old scotch for my professor and one $5 Jack Honey shot for me (just kidding, I had 4!)They don't serve any food, but there was always a bowl of popcorn nearby if you needed a snack. We hung out by the bar on the first floor because it was lively (and had close proximity to more alcohol) but the restrooms are a half-floor down where I saw there were also a handful of arcade games. Another half-floor down, there was a pool table in what appeared to be a quieter lounge area underneath the main bar. I thought it was really clever how versatile the space is!I love love LOVE that the music they played ranged from Queen to EDM to old-school hip hop so there was something for everyone.

This was when we were young and we went to bars in the Midtown area. Always funny to walk in already greased and run into people from college.These last few years it's a great place to head to post-work. For me, a place that couldn't be more different than Monkey Bar, St. Barts and all the typical suit and expensive joints in midtown.Yes this is a dive bar. There is Golden Tee and a pool table downstairs. Waitresses dressed in skimpy outfits. Great happy hour specials ($3 Bud Lights all!!) and FREE popcorn. Probably more male-dominated crowd (it is a bit strange to see the suit-clad men in this dive...but we know they are there for the bartenders) but a mix of all sorts of people and professions.Until Snafu closes down, this will stay on the 'Go To in Midtown' list.",,1,1

My boyfriend and I got our drinks (my jaw dropped at the prices) and then we headed to the way back where there are WEIRD leather chairs and velvet couches and we sat down.

78,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,3.0,3/7/2013,"Snafu is considered a dive bar, but it's more of a mix of dive and lounge; one half lounge and one half dive bar -- a narrow space takes up the front portion of the bar while the back has 2 mini floors. One floor leads to a lounge area upstairs while on the bottom floor are the pool tables and arcade games. Both spaces in the back are not huge, but it's a retreat from the noisy large crowds.You'll find plenty of TVs, a disco ball with smoke machine (although Snafu is not a good place for dancing), okay mainstream music blaring on the speakers, and a very loud and lively crowd at this place. Snafu appears to be an after-work hot spot. A big selling point for Snafu is the happy hour deals they have all week -- $5 martinis, $5 shots, $3 Bud Lights until 8PM plus unlimited free popcorn that you can snack on. I believe the shots may run all night, but the drink specials end at 8PM. I find it difficult to find a happy hour that run past 6-7PM especially around midtown, so for this, Snafu gets a big two thumbs up. When you enter, expect to see a large and noisy crowd of mostly corporate men. The front portion of the bar is a bit narrow and claustrophobic, especially when you have a swarm of people around this area, but if you're looking for some breathing space and elbow room, there is the back upper floor that leads to lounge seating. This area is pretty nice and retains more privacy. They have cushioned seating with small tables plus TVs. It's a lot less noisier, and it's a good place to just sit back and chill. This is a pretty good bar in the midtown east area with a positive vibe and decent happy hour deals. I would come back here again with my friends and/or coworkers especially after work hours. Otherwise, it has a particular crowd with not a ton of diversity that may or may not turn off some, but Snafu retains an atmosphere that is more interesting than many of the generic Irish pubs/sports bars in midtown. The service is also great, especially if you plan to sit in the lounge area of the bar. My friends and I actually sat in the back lounge, and we had a waitress personally come to our table every so often to ask if we needed more drinks, and we never once had to get up to get our drinks. Overall, fun place to just hang out and get a little boozy.",2,,1

If you're a solo traveller definitely pop in - you're sure to meet new friends.Snafu seems to attract people passing through from all over the world - it really is a multi-national place. The last night I was there I hung out with a software developer from Seattle, a senior Avon executive, a Brooklyn based anarchist on his way home from California, and a couple of jet setters from Dubai, before joining a couple of girls from the United Nations for cocktails.And then there's the staff - I have to say they are so friendly. When I ran out of cigarettes not only did the barmaid offer me one of hers but she took her break early and kept me company out front in the beer garden - exceptional Ukrainian hospitality in Manhattan.

Back then, they were more non-descript and lowkey, not too many people knew about them so the bar wasn't too crowded. I loved it that way! It was hardly an issue to find a place to sit at the bar or along the wall, music wasn't too loud, everything was so chill and relaxed.Fast forward a few years. It's gotten way more popular as time passed, so while I'm happy for their business, I'm sad for me because it meant I'd have to endure the crowded bar scene I try hard to avoid. So I stopped coming here because I would get so annoyed with the overcrowdedness. I started coming here slowly again this year but only occasionally (even more rare is me going out - I've become domesticated and don't really barhop anymore in my old age!).The space consists of:- main bar area with a jukebox, TVs, small side tables with high stools along the wall. This part is divey-er than the back part.- back lounge. This part looks way different than the main bar. It has couches (& ottomans, I think), a fireplace (not sure if it's a real or fake one), a booth or 2. Primarily for private parties.- downstairs with a pool table. Also where the bathrooms are. There is also 1-2 tables right by the bathrooms.The only food they have is free popcorn - yummm!! But they do let you bring your own food.They do have happy hour specials, like $5 margaritas or well drink specials, $5 tequila shots, etc. You can have a pretty good time here and get pretty toasted in the process.They have waitresses (for you men or sapphic women out there, they are all hot and model-esque - try to control your drooling!) if you sit at any table throughout the bar (including the upstairs lounge, downstairs tables by the bathroom).All the bartenders and waitresses have been super nice and friendly.Also, they sometimes have a bouncer who checks IDs upon walk-in.

As my friend and I walked up to the guy ( Hispanic) said we must be with the birthday party because the girl is black and we could ONLY be here for that.  We laughed it off and let it slide but I did let him know when I saw him again that he was dead wrong. It was a birthday party but he had the wrong black girl and I added that he should be careful with those comments. Don't know who you're going to offend. This is America. More importantly NYC. The melting pot of the universe. If you still think black people only party with black people you are sadly mistaken buddy. Anyways. The waitresses were pretty nice. Attentive. They come around and take your order and drop your drinks off. They're pretty good with it too. We received everything we ordered in a timely fashion and she made suggestions. They also have this yummy popcorn they keep out for everyone. Typically I don't like popcorn but when you have this crunchy buttery little puff in front of you you can't resist. I would like to try this spot on another night. See how the crowd is.  I had a pretty good time here.",1,,
101,Blake B.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,180,78,4.0,4/24/2013,"Nice little dive-in bar in midtown. Came here by mistake and ended up staying for while. They have a pool table downstairs in a lounge area. On the main floor there's a long bar. Good selection of beers on tap, including seasonal beers. They have great specials on mojitos and margaritas, $7,  and different flavors.The bar has about 10 flat screens, so you can catch games on. The bartender was really nice, friendly and pleasant. Service was excellent.The only thing is this bar doesnt have food, but you can bring in outside food. They do, however, serve all you can eat pop-corn for a drunk snack.",3,,1

The waitress was hot and cold with the service but in the end was super chill and had shots of patron with us. Martinis were good: dirty ones were strongggg, and the mango was yummy ($5).

I'm THERE.Snafu is actually a really awesome bar, that I would highly recommend for anybody interested in popcorn, cheap shots, or sports. I loved it. So we came here after hearing about the free popcorn, just to check it out, but right before we went inside, we saw the sign for $5 shots--ahh, how could we resist?We ended up spending quite a bit of time here watching 3 march madness games that were playing, which was awesome. Getting the attention of the bartenders was pretty easy, and they served you quickly. There was endless popcorn, and it was AWESOME. Great great time. I'd recommend it!",,,
106,Mike I.,"Detroit, MI",38,168,35,4.0,2/17/2014,What can I say I had a great time at Snafu on my first ever visit.  This is a classic dive bar so if you are looking for an upscale place go elsewhere.  Our group found a seat in the upstairs portion by the television and hung out there for the night.  We had a great time.  The servers bring endless popcorn from the popcorn maker they have on the end of the bar and they have a decent selection of drinks.  The guest control the music on the jukebox and the price of the drinks were not bad either for NYC standards.  We got to watch the Knicks game on the televisions around the place and a couple of people in our group headed to the lower section by the restrooms to bum around the pool tables and arcade games.  The employees were very attentive to keep our drinks refreshed even though we were in the upper section away from the bar.  Overall if you are looking for a fun dive bar to have some an awesome time then this is the place.  If I'm in the area again I will look to make a pit stop here.  Worth a trip!,,,

The music was all over the place. There was a loft area that had a bouncer. I'm not sure if it was VIP or a private party or whatever. A dive with a private area? There also appeared to be a pool table and video games in the lower level. The crowd was also a very weird mix. I can't say that I would go back intentionally.",,1,

I had to keep waving her down or ask a bus boy to please get her because she barely paid us any attention. As a waitress, you're suppose to deliver exceptional service considering the fact you primarily rely on tips, and I know this being a waitress myself at a sports bar in Times Sq. I had closed out my first tab and then reopened a new tab with her, and I ended up leaving after that, but then later returned realizing I didnt pay for the second tab because I had a bit much to drink. I came to close out my second tab and they attempted to overcharge me and not only that, Natasha left with my credit card and there was no way for me to retrieve it back. I called the managers the next day, and they are giving me the run around about my credit card. My experience SUCKED. This establishment is unprofessional.

The barmaids were very nice and polite, drinks were inexpensive and once again given the location. Place was crowded, good selection of music, we ventured into the bsmt as they do have a pool table and more privacy, also it isn't as loud so better yet to have a conversation at an average tone of voice. The free popcorn given also keeps you tummy happy, they do provide you with menu that you could order from outside of the establishment which is pretty cool. I invite you to come and check it out.

It somehow blended in cozy, hole-in-the-wall style bar with trendy lounge scene. Typical bar and flat screens for a place of that size, they watch plenty of European soccer matches as well as local baseball, football, etc., games.At the back of the bar, a set of stairs leads up to the lounge area or downstairs to a pool table and an array of bar video game favorites, including a Big Buck Hunter game that, for some reason, is very popular among the bar scene crowd. The clientele is a mix bag of 9 to 5ers, tourists and regular barhoppers and the bartenders are knowledgable on top of being fabulous eye candy.

So I yelped, of course ""strong drinks"" in the area, and this little place came up. Once I seen free popcorn and strong drinks I was sold. The margaritas were $8 and shots $5, not sure if that's an everyday thing or if it was just because it was Halloween (a Friday night). Drinks were good the mango margarita was nice! They kept the popcorn coming too!! Our waitress was adorable and very friendly. I loved the fact that there were two floors and a good amount of seating; the upstairs section is cute, they have sectional lounges and tv's so that is a plus for the atmosphere. Downstairs was like a game area, with a pool table, which we loved! The music was great (there was a DJ)!! As far as the crowd, it was diverse and I love how friendly everyone seemed, no one seemed afraid to interact which was also a plus! There were ALL different ages from mid 20's to pushing 40 LOL. It was never really crowded which I found weird, on a Friday night in an awesome bar.  As far as food goes there isn't any there, HOWEVER they did have a menu from a place that delivers to them, which wasn't bad because it took them the same amount of time to come with our pizza as it would if they were to make it there. The pizza was good and only 15 for a large pie I believe. Definitely coming here again!!",2,1,

Early in the evening, there's a good amount of young business professionals to mingle with. Later on you get more tourists, young new Yorkers and people who just stumble in, that's how I found this place a few years ago. The DJ gets there around 10 or 11. Music is mainly Top 40 but he will sometimes take requests. The bartenders, the best part about this bar! Arun, Rene and Kat. So friendly and easy to start conversation. They are very attentive! One tip, well not just one but make you tip them and be nice to them, they'll be good to you.

Went here for the first time and many more times to come, last Saturday. Had a margarita and a mango mojito...BOTH very good and inexpensive ($5 each)...can't really beat that.

Updated review","OK I have to admit my initial enthusiam has waned.  But for good reason.I went in one day, ordered a beer as I placed a $20 on the bar.  The pleasant young lady in short shorts came back with some bills and coins.  Yes coins!  She explained the POS system was having a problem so it was charging tax on top of the normal price.Oh, so I pay tax on top of the price that previously included tax.  Geez, the man is really taking it out of us! I wonder if they actually sent the double tax into the state revenue office . . . .Anyway this continued.  But then every time I ordered a ""Bud Bottle, Please."" I got a bud light - sometimes even a draft!?  Now, I speak rather loudly and clear and the bartenders were very capable of understanding English.  Also, I am no kid and already rather skinny.  Light beer is no necessity for me.Anyway, this continued with the aforementioned double tax issue until I suspended my patronage.I recently returned to order a ""Bud Bottle, Please, "" as I laid a Jackson down.  There was only one other patron as I took a long draught on the bottled.  To my surprise, I noticed the bottle was mostly gone when I put it back down.  The dainty quality of Bud Light went in volume unnoticed down my throat.  Damn.  Seems whatever I say, I look like a Bud Light drinker.I saw my change was a $10, four singles and two quarters. Yup, the new price is now $5.50.    If you still want to go, make sure to dig into your kid's piggy bank for loose change.  It will come in handy.P.S.  It was mid day, a time when empty bars either have happy hour or just have cheap prices.",,,

129,Dana A.,"Philadelphia, PA",32,45,8,3.0,6/24/2012,"I am so indifferent about this bar.5 pm: My friend and I stopped in because of the $5 margarita and mojito special. We were also waiting for the sushi spot a few doors down to open. We'd spent so much money on drinks the night before and felt we'd hit a gold mine with this place. The drink was pretty strong so we decided we'd go back that night to pregame before heading elsewhere. 11:30 pm: As soon as we walked in, I felt like I'd walked into a Jersey shore bar. The crowd looked mostly underage and top 40 hits were blasting from the speakers. I had two choices: run or get drunk fast. I ordered a shot of Patron silver ($7) and a margarita. It became clear to me that this was not somewhere I wanted to be completely sober, ever, but the drink specials were too good to walk away from. If you're looking for a budget friendly place to dance, feel old at the age of 26, and possibly get hit on by men over 50 this is your spot.",1,3,

What I found weird is their non stop advertising of blow job shots.  I mean literally every wall had a cheap ass computer made sign that said ""4 dollar blow job shots all night.""  Even in the mens bathroom.  Are your midtown finance patrons really that douchey that they will take blow job shots because you advertised it above the urinal? nevermind, thats an obvious yes.",3,5,2

For $2 a game, it wasn't that bad. But the table was not well maintained the the pool sticks, the only two they had, were cracked and slightly warped. Not a place to play your A-Game but we made the most of it anyway. Very dim lighting.The waitress was very quick in bringing our drinks and changing dollars for quarters.

140,DeShaun C.,"Brooklyn, NY",370,245,30,3.0,7/24/2011,"Hm, Yelp classifies this as a dive.Several reviews classify this as a dive.I don't. It's too nice to be a dive. I mean, sure, there is a dive-y element about the front bar + jukebox. However, taking a few steps upstairs exposes some seating and candlelight that is definitely not dive decor. There's even a faux fireplace up there. There are some dive staples like TVs showing sports, one of those Golden Tee games downstairs, and a pool table, but I'm gonna say it's just over the ""dive"" line.I came in with friends to continue celebrating a birthday, and well...it was dead. It was a Saturday before sundown, so that's to be expected. We took over the upstairs area and had some drinks. Despite the advertising all along the walls, our bartender informed us that we couldn't have the blowjob shots that early. I'm gonna have to contend that it is never too early for a blowjob.A lot of chatting and a lot of free popcorn later, and I guess the bartender deemed it late enough. The shots were good. A kamikaze I had after that wasn't, though.I'm reading a lot of reviews stating how the place gets really crowded, so I can imagine it being bad for after-work hours.

If you're in a group or with your man and friends this might not be so bad as a casual hangout spot, but definitely not a place I could plan to frequent. There's far too many older men watching freshly-minted-21-year-olds get drunk and dance on a ""dance floor"" aka the space between the wall and the bar stool. The drinks are strong here, but for the ambiance not really my thing. Didn't even make it to the back of the bar (where there are TVs, the DJ stand and a seating area) since I wasn't brave (or rather, drunk enough) to tackle the mosh pit of people it took to get there.

I went out here with some colleagues after work and was immediately accosted by a group of guys from Jefferies attempting to impress me with horror stories of investment banking life. (""I haven't slept more than five hours in six weeks!"" ""Yeah, well I worked 72 straight hours and passed out at my desk last week!"" ""Well my associate threw a deck at my head today!"" etc etc). The male-female ratio after work here, at least when I've been there, can most generously be described as skewed. On the plus side, good drink specials, especially for Midtown.

Considering its location, it may be considered dive bar-ish but nothing one may find in the lower east side. It had the customary distressed wood bar and back wall papered with signed and doodled dollar bills. The sound system is top notch but the music selection is odd, jumping all over the place.They have a good selection of booze and the servings are fine but not 'cheap'. The 'Specials' are on until 9pm. The prices were normal ($8) and for those keeping score, no buy backs, which sucks. The girl behind the bar was a really cute blonde Russian/Slavic, with these daisy duke shorts, from Russia with Love.In the bar area they have this crazy disco light ball thing. It bathes the area with little light beams and not to be out done they also have a fog machine. The Dyno-fog II. And even at 1am it will be used. Its very effective confusing drunks. They had a popcorn machine going in the back, it seems everyone is wet over 'free popcorn'. Who gives a shit? You want popcorn? Duane Reade sells Pop Secret, knock yourself out. Bars are for drinking.This place is a good option if you are in the area, great tvs if you need to catch the game. Because they don't have buy backs, I can't consider it a 'go to' spot..",2,,1

We took advantage of their drink specials.. $3 Bud Light Draught, $5 Jameson Picklebacks and I really enjoyed the $5 Pear Martinis. The Martinis were strong but yummy, and definitely did the trick! I don't think they serve food here, but we were offered a big ole bowl of popcorn to munch on. The bartender who was wearing short shorts and a vest was pretty on point, and kept her cool even when things got crazy in there. I wouldn't call this place a dive, because they have a nice lounge area upstairs with couches and flat screens and more seating and a pool table downstairs. After a $24 tab and a serious buzz, I would say Snafu is a great spot on 47th for happy hour or just reasonably priced drinks!",1,,1

Went around the bar and came back for some more drinks after a few minutes.....guess after she didn't get a drink out of me the first time she obviously refused to pay attention to me and my other girl friend. When we decided to leave due to the horrible service from her, didn't leave no tip. Well guess what!!! She decided to tip herself on my card and my girl friend...

This place isn't going to win any awards, but it's a great place to get cheap drinks after a long week's worth of work. The popcorn is so damn addictive, too; they load it up with a fair amount of salt and butter, and you can't stop eating it once you start. There's a nice area upstairs for groups, or you can head downstairs and shoot some pool or play Buck Hunt (a favorite of my coworkers). The waitresses are pretty good about coming around and making sure you're filled up, so you won't have to go dry for too long.

I have been here numerous times and this time the door guy gave me a problem at the door saying we arent aloud in because of a private party. I was shocked. This never happened before and I told him a private party my @ss, my sisters and my friends are in there already how come you let them in and not me? So he let me in finally after I complained and I started drinking and buying shots for my 2 friends. Well at the end of the night my card was declined and I couldnt pay. Apparently I drank a little 2 much but I left my card there and I said ill come back tomorrow to pay it. I left, I went home. The next day I called snafu 5 times and left messages each time. They NEVER ANSWER THEIR PHONE OR RETURN A CALL!!!!  I told them I was on my way to get my card back feom the night before. Well when I got there the bartender gave me my bill and it was 200 bucks plus!!! I was like whoaaaa!!!! So I asked them why is it sooo high??? The female bartender gave me a list of what I ordered. I had 2 makers and coke, a long island, a vodka and cranberry and get this 21 SHOTS!!!! I was immediately upset and angry!!! I never ever ever order shots like that. If I do shots ill do 3 tops!! They tried to charge me for 21 shots!!! I was very angry at this. I asked to speak to a manager and ahe said shes a manager. I was kinda shocked because I had no idea she was a manager, shes a bartender so it took me by surprise. So I told her I wasnt paying 200 dollars. She ended up charging me 83 bucks. I was satisfied with that but with them trying to over charge me, crappy ass door men, no management calling me back I can honestly say I will no longer ever visit this place. Very disgusted by the management.....no apology either. I used to love this place....its a shame they have crappy workers. I praise that bartender that toom care of my bill.

It's all a haze... a sweet cosmopolitan induced haze. The drinks are strong. Did I mention that? They're also almost always cheap... did I mention that? Chicks always end up on the bar dancing... that's worth a mention. There used to be this bartender who would get trashed and want to make out w/ every chick there, she was hot too. I never made out with her b/c she was skanky and I don't do that. But she was pretty hot...

194,D L.,"Manhattan, NY",5,6,0,3.0,9/20/2012,I live around the corner from this place and wow it is a completely different scene every other weekend.  There are some real 'sketch' and 'wtf is going on moments' to be had here.  Go for cheap beers and shots after work but get the f- out before the crazies show up.,,,
195,Jennifer Y.,"New York, NY",184,618,2,4.0,2/5/2009,"Kick Ass happy hour.It's always packed with tons of people, mostly in finance (sorry, we're just all over this city!)Drinks are cheap, bartenders are super efficient and everyone ends up having a grand old time.  It's not even as divey as you might think although it'd never make Urban Daddy's Sexy list.",2,,
196,Annie K.,"Boston, MA",99,385,12,4.0,3/22/2011,"Cheap drinks and popcorn?  I should give it 5 stars, but I'm going with a 3.5, I think.  I guess I feel like rounding up today.I came here on a Thursday night after work for a going away party for a co-worker.  It's definitely a dive bar, yet there were a bunch of guys in suits walking around...maybe for the servers in their tiny booty shorts and tanks in the 20 degree weather?  Was sort of a mixed crowd, though.  Saw a lot of older people, suits and people who looked like they'd been hanging out all day.It was super crowded (and the place is small) from the time I got there till when I left around 9.  Luckily someone had reserved a couple couches in the back.  There were two people on a date sitting next to us, which was a little strange, since it is not a date place at all.  Looked like they barely knew each other, too.  Our server was okay...kinda flaky/forgetful, but maybe she was busy.  Jukebox was key after the cheap drinks kicked in. :)",1,,1

The free popcorn is nice--reminds me of places in the Chicago area that do that. I thought bars in New York were too ""cool"" to do something like that, but I was happy to be proved wrong.Beer selection is a bit too mainstream for my tastes; the most exotic thing they had was Brooklyn Lager. The music was played a little too loud. I had a hard time talking to my coworkers. It's weird when places like this play music too loud. It's not  the type of place where people are going to start dancing, so what's the point of jacking up the volume?",2,,1
198,Marilyn S.,"Manhattan, NY",20,78,2,4.0,4/15/2011,"Apart from the trashy uniforms of the staff (which some might say is a plus) I found this place to be fabulous.  Comfy, sexy, loungy upstairs, pool and video games downstairs, happy hour on the weekends.  Yay!",1,,
199,Allison G.,"Brooklyn, NY",244,356,10,4.0,6/5/2007,"I was in the area with some friends, looking for a nightcap. In this area, everything is SO expensive! So, it was exciting to find Sanfu, home of FREE POPCORN and reasonably-priced drinks. (We'd just passed up on going to a super-overpriced diner where ice cream was $9!)The atmosphere wasn't too exciting. It was dimly-lit, and the new James Bond film was showing on the TV. Snafu kind of had a divey feel, but I noticed a sign on the door that they will soon be enforcing a ""dress code."" I guess they are trying to class up the Snafu just a little bit.",1,,2
