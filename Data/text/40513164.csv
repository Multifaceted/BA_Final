Dimly light with the music loud enough where it isn't over bearing, but still can have a conversation.I prefer the wings and the three cheese Mac with bacon. The wings were okay (kinda disappointed me in bar wings), but the Mac & cheese is what saved the entire meal.The portion of the Mac and cheese is definitely something that can fill someone up! The bartenders were really nice and attentive, definitely made sure I was comfortable. The Pineapple cocktail I had was delicious and it was strong not a bit overbearing at all !",

I'm pretty sure I went here when I first moved to New York and they didn't have any of the stuff they now have all over the walls in honor of the show. But also I think the show had just started and the fandom was nowhere near the level it eventually grew to. They even have bus tours stop here to check the space out. Which is annoying but I digress. I came to kill time here last week before an event and grabbed a pint and a whiskey. Their house ale is pretty good actually and one of the beers on their happy hour for around $6. It kind of tasted nutty like a cross between a brown lager and red ale. The whiskey ginger I also had (cheers to you Robin, you scotch/whiskey drinking Canadian, you) was impressively strong and also only around $6 on happy hour. I do enjoy how they have a similar booth set up. When you look around, you're like . . . . yeah I guess I can envision MacLaren's being almost like this place. I can't speak for the themed food and cocktails. Yes, they have some of their menu named after stuff from the show: ""woo wings, the bro code combo, tedmobyisajerk. com (Chicken Jerk Wrap), The gay pirate, Daddy's Home, Wait For It, Robin Sparkles, Barney's Blackout cocktails priced around $13 and under, which isn't terrible. Chuckles. Last but not least, definitely take a picture of the cardboard cutouts of Barney & Robin. It's a must. I didn't really scour the bar to see if Ted, Lilly, and Marshall were there but it amused the hell out of me.",2

We got here and there was how i met your mother stuff all over the walls, there were cardboard cut outs, and the menu was based off of some of the episodes/characters. There were a couple of people who looked like they were there for the himym stuff, but it seemed like a majority of the crowd also was made up of tourists (given the location near times square).Overall, it was a pretty cool pub/bar, pretty much what you'd expect. I thought that the pub food was way overpriced and average, but I guess since it's near a touristy area it makes sense? My friend ordered one of the cocktails off of the special himym cocktail menu and absolutely hated it. It honestly looked like a vodka with cranberry juice you'd get from a promoter's table at a club...not something you'd actually want to pay for. I would say it's not the kind of place where you should order dinner/lunch, because there are sooo many better places to go eat in the area and the cocktails didn't look great at all. It's honestly a place to just chill and get beers and maybe appetizers! Tbh besides the himym theme, which actually wasn't that overwhelming, i'm not sure why anyone would really choose to come here with so many other great options in the city.",

The idea that I would pretty much be going to MacLaren's with my group of friends definitely sold me but when I got there I was a little underwhelmed. It had a few things here and there that made it seem HIMYM-y: pictures on the walls, some merch, and of course some drinks and items on the menu based on certain episodes, characters, or catchphrases from the show. Other than that...it was just a normal pub. IDK what I was expecting tbh. Food was ok, but on the more expensive side. It could just be the avg price of food in NY is higher, but I'm not sure. I don't recall the drink I ordered being particularly strong but at least it had a cool name and was decently tasty. Overall, I'd probably recommend this just as a quick stop for a photo op but not much else if you're expecting to be super wowed.",

Hello Tourist Stop but I'm ok with that!  DH insisted on coming here since we are such fans of the show! I knew it wouldn't really look like anything like MacLaren's, but it's nice to be in the aura of what inspired the show. It's your typical sports bar, TVs long dark wooden bar, dark floors. The servers are friend and the food was average, the cocktails were named according to the show so it was a nice kitschy touch. It's a fun spot to go if you're a fan and check off on tour bucket list but this your average pub!",2

McGee's along with other bars were all inspirations for the writers of HIMYM to create McGee. But I think that McGee is the only one still in business. Inspiration at this pub is the large mural on the back wall. That's right, McGee has a nice bar and booth but the layout is not 100% identical. The pub is still HIMYM themed and has a special cocktail menu based on the show.I tried the robin sparks and pineapple incident. If you want something straight up with more juice, go with pineapple incident. If you want some alcohol flavor and not just you, Robin sparkles. Enjoy!",

The staff were very friendly and attentive, the drinks were quick and well maintained.  The ceased salads came out with the wrong dressing, I could not finish mine as the dressing was not to my liking at all. The cheese burger was great, made to order and cooked to perfection. Ask for extra ketchup, they provide a lot of fries.

We came in knowing it was loosely based on this bar (not a mirror image). You're not going to come here and think you are on the set of HIMYM, because well, you're not. I loved this atmosphere here. It's very laid back, was decorated really nicely for Christmas and of course it's cool to drink where the idea of the show was thought up. The bartender Kevin gets the award for best bartender in NYC. We loved talking to him, he gave great recommendations and was super friendly. Love the HIMYM themed drinks. I tried the Pineapple Incident. It was too sweet for more than one, but I loved it! Can't wait to come back and try some others. I can't speak for the food as we didn't eat here, but the menu looked great! They also have a HIMYM trivia night and I believe a night where they play the show on the TVs.",

10,1,4/23/2018,208,1,"Philadelphia, PA",Andrea F.,27,4.0,339,"Fun fact: I've never seen an episode of HIMYM, so the theme of this entire place was lost on me.  But it still seems like a pretty cool place to hang out.We came for a quick bite to eat around lunchtime before a Broadway show, and I'm so happy we decided to come here.  Luckily at that time, it wasn't packed and we were able to snag a seat in a plushy round booth right up front.  There's a bunch of memorabilia for the show hanging up, if you're into that.  I also noticed a coin-operated breathalyzer on the wall, which I thought was...interesting?  Is that from the show?  I have no clue. Anyway, they have a pretty decent draft and bottle selection and kitschy cocktails with names that I assume are callbacks to the show, but we just stuck with some ciders.  For food, they had a really wide variety of pub fare, from burgers to Irish cuisine like bangers and mash.  We both got the fish and chips.  Food came out super fast and nice and hot.  Fries were like old school thick-cut diner fries and super crunchy and salty.  Fish was battered wonderfully and came with a tasty tartar sauce for dipping, plus an oversized lemon wedge, which is always a nice plus.  Overall, we were very pleased with our choices and it hit the spot.Hostess was very friendly, as was our server.  I would've liked to hang around a while longer at the bar if we had more time.  Overall, I would come back for a drink and some more pub fare if I was ever in the area again, although I would say it's pretty steep prices ($20 for fish and chips!) for what is ultimately just another Irish pub.  But that's New York, right?",2
11,2,3/30/2018,155,3,"Henderson, NV",Cynthia H.,71,5.0,71,"How I Met Your Mother is one of my favorite shows; therefore, it was a must to visit the bar that inspired the show's creators for MacLaren's, the bar that the series primarily takes place at while visiting New York City. Everything about this bar makes you feel like Ted, Lily, Marshall, Barney, and Robin are about to walk in and occupy a booth at any moment from its red colored booths to the dim lights and dark furniture. There are even HIMYM pictures displayed throughout the restaurant and a themed menu with names referencing the show such as ""Ducky Tie"", ""The Slutty Pumpkin"", and ""S.O.B"". We visited the bar on a Wednesday evening around eleven. Despite the fact that it was slightly busy, the bartender was attentive to everyone (as the Celtics and Jazz were finishing up a game). We solely ordered two alcoholic beverages on our visit; however, I wish that we ordered more! Both the ""Creamsicle"" and the ""S.O.B"" were delicious. Even with a high alcohol tolerance (thanks to living in Las Vegas), my boyfriend and I could both feel the effects of the alcohol in a good way! I would highly, highly recommend this bar to anyone who loves to drink or loves the HIMYM series. I will definitely be back during my next visit to the city!",2

Other than a special drink menu with drinks named after famous quotes or episodes in the show and a couple of pictures from the show hung on the wall, it would be just any regular bar.

So it was cool to be in there for me cause it was a show I enjoyed. On to the food. I was in a rush so I just kept it simple. I had the Mcgee burger with fries. Let me tell you this, by far one of the best burger I've had in a long time. It was so full of flavor and juicy even though I ordered it medium-well. (Yeah yeah I know) the fires were very good as well, not soggy but not hard just right.  Sorry I forgot to take pictures of my food, again I was in a rush trying to finish up with a customer.

For eats we kept it simple to a shared plate of mixed appetizers despite the larger menu looking interesting.  I didn't want to fill up before the show so that had to suffice.  This consisted of chicken fingers, wings, potato skins and mozzarella sticks.  The regular options on such a dish and while most were good I did find the wings to be a little sparse on their side.  I've had places where the wings were larger and tastier so this part of the dish was my least favorite tonight.  There was an open WiFi to use for check ins and to make sure the time was correct for the show and at the end of the day the price was not over the top.  Again its NYC and these rents are high.  The place was chill and the vibe comfortable and should I be in the region again looking for a place to go I will consider them for a return go round.  Enjoy.",

Everyone was a relatively good mood considering the first place we wanted to go was overpacked, so we settled for this place that seemed pretty empty.Our waitress, a middle aged irish woman, was fairly nice and started us off with our drinks. We each ordered a different beer & they came pretty quickly. We all sat in conversation as we sipped our drinks and one of our coworkers noticed their beer was flat. Being fairly shy and non confrontational, he took a few sips to power though the flatness (took maybe 3 sips). We had politely informed the waitress that the beer was flat & thats when he was told that he was wrong and the beer was fine. When a few of us chimed in saying we had tasted it and confirmed it was flat, she attacked with ""well the beer was half drank"" (it wasn't) and he was going to get charged with it. The woman got very defensive and gave us an attitude like we were trying to get a free beer out of it (lady, the beers are $9, if we're paying that much for them, they should certainly not be flat.) Our coworker didnt even want another beer after that and just opted for a glass of water. Just her presence made our lunch unenjoyable. That was until we got our food, and then our food made our lunch unenjoyable.Mac and cheese had uncooked inedible bacon crumbles on the top. the club sandwich did not taste good at all, and the roast beef french dip was very tough and chewy and came with a tiny side of au jus. I will however give credit to the sweet potato fries. Once salted, they were delicious. Overall the awful attitude of the waitress, the flat beers & the overwhelmingly mediocre food made us realize why the place barely had anyone in it especially while the world cup was on.

It was chicken with the spinach infused inside which was weird to me personally but it still tasted good.The environment was busy, crowded, and loud.

Our waitress took quite awhile to get to us (we were sitting for awhile before she approached and asked us for our orders). She also seemed pretty unhappy.

They have pictures of the cast visiting the bar, so that was pretty cool (which means my soles have now touched the same floor that their soles have touched, life achievement unlocked, haha). So they served your normal midtown priced foods and drinks, although at a slight maybe 1 or 2 dollar premium on their cocktails with fancy HIMYM inspired names (which is fun to point at). I was hoping to get that drink named after Robin (the one that Marshall created, but Robin ordered it most of the time?), but I didn't see it on the menu.I guess I was a little disappointed that I could not imagine the interior to be like McLaren's, but I came in knowing that already. Regardless, they do have nice decor and a good layout.  It's a nice cozy little spot with booths and a second floor (not the spacious rectangular style as we see on the show though).The food was eh.. nothing super tasty, but for bar food, I'd say it is what it is and not bad (large portions though).I am not disappointed, but I can't say I had the time of my life.

However, under no circumstances would I recommend venturing outside of any happy hour drink or one of the themed cocktails. A Ballast point (normal sized pour) ran me $10. I'm no stranger to paying too much for beer, but not for your run of the mill tap list. To put this in perspective: a 24oz beer at Madison Square Garden, a place that also has a pretty straight forward beer selection, is $14.50. A 16oz beer here is $10. Let's look at it by $/oz:$14.50/24oz=$0.604/oz$10/16oz=$0.625/oz It is less expensive to drink at MSG than it is here. The food is fine, nothing extraordinary, but definitely solid.

However, it's just a fun sports pub with heaping piles of good food altogether. If you're looking for a shareable, look no further than the stacked chili nachos for about $16.

If that's your sole reason for coming here, I have to warn you that you really shouldn't expect it to look anything like MacLaren's. The bar area somewhat resembles it, but that's really it for the ground floor. If you go upstairs though, there are several booths that sooorta look like the show, but you'll really have to use your imagination.

I've done my fair share of fangirling!Unfortunately, I am really not a fan of the drinks! They have a special HIMYM drink menu with HIMYM-inspired cocktails (e.g. Tantrum, The Naked Man, Robin Sparkles) which is super cool, but these cocktails are some of the most weak and watered down I've had in NYC! For $8-$10, totally not worth it. I can't speak for the food as I've not tried them, but they have something called How I Met Your Mother Mondays where they serve HIMYM-inspired dishes like the ""Bro Code"" Combo (buffalo wings, chicken fingers, potato skins, and mozzarella sticks), ""The Best Burger in New York"", the ""Suit Up Sandwich"" etc. I haven't had the opportunity to try the food yet as I always go after having dinner somewhere else. But if friends from out of town ever wanna go to McGee's in the future, I'll definitely suggest going for dinner on a Monday so that I can try the food.

If you know the show well, you must expect this place to have some resemblance to McClaren's. Unfortunately, it does not. It looks nothing like it whatsoever. Well, if you count how dim the place is, then yeah. There is plenty of seating when I arrived and propped myself to the bar on a freezing Thursday night. There are plenty of TVs surrounding the bar so it's a great place to watch games. It pretty much looks like your run-of-the-mill bar with wooden tables, bar games and booths.Their menu consists of drinks based on the show, such as Robin Sparkles, The Pineapple Incident (spoiler: a deleted might have revealed why that pineapple was next to Ted's bed in that episode. Look it up.) and the drink of my choice, the Naked Man. The drink consists of Bulleit Rye, ginger ale, club soda and lemon juice. In the show, the move works 2 out of 3 times. I guess the same can go for the drink, because it wasn't that great. It barely had enough alcohol and it really tasted watered down. I was very disappointed with a drink with such a legendary name.In the show, Carl really provided the bar with pretty good service. I wish I can say the same for this place. It wasn't that busy and it took a while for the bartender to get my order and give me my check. Wasn't sure what was really going on, but I expected way better service with a well known bar such as this one, especially when it wasn't that busy.

Not only were we kicked out by a man not on duty, but the man also made some outrageous racial accusations. Me and some of my friends went to this bar last year and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. However, me and three friends went to the bar for some drinks again and an African American male approaches us and says, ""I'll get these empty drinks for you, I don't work right now, but I will do it,"" as we had some empty drinks set on the table. We all say ""okay, thank you,"" a little confused and the female friends I am with move their phones from the middle of the table, since drinks were surrounding them to avoid spillage from the drinks onto their phones. The man then says ""you grabbed your phones right when I came"" and then after explaining why my friends had moved their phones, the man says ""and you know what else, we have Donald Trump as a president."" My friend, calmer than I, goes to speak with the man, while I go ask the bartender to speak. I ask the bartender why this African American man is implying that we are racist. He then says ""I don't know he works here on the weekends."" I explain why we are upset and that the man blind sided us for being racist just for moving phones, quite expensive objects, as to avoid liquid damage. Then the other man who said he was security on the weekends says, ""I never said you were racist,"" as if making a scene for moving phones and bringing up trump has nothing to do with racism.  This man, who had taken our empty drinks, comes closer and grabs me and tells me to get out of the bar, to which I look at the bartender and say ""how can he kick me out he isn't even working I am just trying to understand why he is verbally attacking us?"" Then the bartender looks at my friend and says ""really only $1?!"" as he examines the tip left from my friend obviously after how we were treated. I am moved towards the exit of the bar, since a man not on duty is physically grabbing me and removing me from the bar. While I wait by the exit, my friend still tries to speak with the man making racist implications towards us. As we wait by the exit, the bartender comes over and says ""I don't know why he is being like this, he works here on the weekends, I have never seen him like this, he drinks girly drinks, you have nothing to be worried about."" I reply saying ""I drink girly drinks too,"" as a man myself.  The Bartender then replies saying, ""you had a beer,"" as if this man who works at the bar as security, and does not drink beer, is allowed to make racist implications because he drinks girly drinks. Also, the bartender completely disregards making a rude comment towards my friend about the tip and tries to play it off, like the off duty man did nothing wrong. Somehow, because of what you drink (not a beer), you are excused from making racist accusations towards customers when not on duty and allowed to physically remove customers from the bar. This is an absolute mockery of an establishment.",

The local pub upon which McLaren's was fashioned, there is full fledged HIMYM regalia throughout the joint and you'll find drinks named after episodes. Case in point: I ordered Daddy's Home (scotch and soda...emphasis on the scotch) and my friend got the Naked Man (works 2 out of 3 times). McGee's has the classic pub feel with two full bars, old wooden tables, dart boards, and bar food. I got their veggie burger with sauteed mushrooms and served with sweet potato fries and it was pretty good. The burger wasn't too mushy, the 'shrooms provided additional flavor, and the fries were crispy and fresh. The bun wasn't toasted at all whereas my friends was nicely charred but hey, you don't go for a five star meal. We all found the food to be satisfactory and will warm you up on a warm night (along with the scotch). Because of its association to the TV show and as it's in a touristy part of the city, you'll find families in there with kids. It always catches me off guard to see kids in a bar but here, it's to be expected.

The bar definitely does not look like HIMYM. They do have pictures of the cast around the bar. And they have food and drinks based on the show. So if you're looking to see the actual HIMYM bar setup, you're out of luck! The show is based around the bar, not the other way around. We were not there for food, only drinks, so we don't know how the service for food was. We ended up being upstairs because the bar downstairs was filled. Good choice. We met the bartender Kevin and he was very educated in his drinks. He was phenomenal and had awesome customer service! If you ever go here, make sure to chat with Kevin!

The decor is similar, with pictures of the cast and crew everywhere. The creators carter bays, and Craig Thomas use to come to this place after working for the Letterman Show, and together they came up with the idea of HIMYM here so the magic is still there. They have a pretty creative menu with references to the show. I had almost all the drinks on it. One thing that kinda irritated me was a bartender that worked there didn't watch the show, and was flat out insulting the show. Workers should know a little about the theme of the bar that they work at, and if not at least show a little respect. Great place to go if you're a fan.",3

We were sent up to the third floor where it was freezing cold and they require a $20 minimum spend per person so I was forced to get their onion soup ($6) without all the cheese and was actually looking forward to trying their chicken pot pie (a favorite of mine).The onion soup was loaded with salt and came with the tiniest piece of bread ever. I had to throw a bunch of water into my soup just so I could drink the broth with the onions - that's how salty it was. Skip it - def not work $6.The chicken pot pie was just chicken, potatoes, peas, carrots and sauce in a small container and a floating pastry puff was just placed on top (not baked into the dish). It was basically getting bread on the side. It was okay, nothing special.My boyfriend had the shepards pie and said it was ok, not great. He also had their expensive $8 beer. Talk about price gouging at this place.The trivia itself was okay. Super hard, but for the most part enjoyable. Although the hosts of the show seemed to not like their jobs so much or like they've been doing it for too long. There were lots of snarky borderline rude comments. Thankfully it was their last day on the job (maybe that's why they seemed so disenchanted).To top it off at the end of the night an 18% 'service fee' was tacked on to my bill and everyone else's (according to the waitress). It wasn't a suggested tip, however there was no mention of this so called mandatory charge on the menu or on the phone when I called to make my reservation. They need to disclose things like this because it was already an expensive night for 40 mins of not so great entertainment. At least they did the right thing by removing this mandatory tip so that I could leave a tip that I thought was fitting - the only reason I gave them 2 stars.

I understand if you only accept an American ID or passport, but there is no excuse to be rude, specially because of a real ID. I was with 4 other European friends with European IDs and they had no problem. I said that I was leaving the place and I didn't want to stay there anymore and he said to hold on. He looked at my ID again and gave my friend and I a menu of drinks. Later he came and asked me what I wanted to drink and I said ""nothing, thank you"". I was only there for my friends and to have a good time. And he was already ruining it, so I didn't feel like drinking. After that he look away and said ""fascinating"" and started complaining to the other costumers about me. Totally disrespectful. I am very thankful I didn't spend any money at the Pub.

We told the hostess we would go stand by the bar, and to let us know if a table opened up. She seemed irked at our request but agreed. We stood at the very end or the bar and ordered drinks, only for the bartender to send someone to get us chairs for us. Gave us great recommendations on the food - was honest about what was great and what was sub par. After getting our food, the hostess came by and told us a table was available if we still wanted it. Shocking to us, as we figured she would just blow us off. After staying for a round or two, we left very impressed with how nice the entire staff was as we interacted with them.

I walked into our table with a guy eating some food from the kitchen, where all the customers could see them, a lady that was not interested at all in helping anyone in the restaurant, and another one that was working very diligently. This inconsistency with service is what bothered me, and I was appalled that they would even allow for this to happen.The atmosphere was very cool though, and there were tons of picture depicting HIMYM and Friends, and that was primarily the reason why I choose this restaurant.

I was there the other night with a few buddies around the bar and one of the waitresses legit shoved my friend out of the way and said ""move!"" while he was paying. Beyond rude. The bartender on the second floor was also extremely pushy and just down right unfriendly. So many other amazing bars in the city with amazing bartenders & staff. Don't waste your time here. They sell themselves on HIMYM and you will be left with nothing but disappointment. It's your standard Irish Pub with barely any resemblance to the bar in the show.",

Make sure to go there on a night that Ronan is working, he turned what we thought would be a dull pitstop into a very fun night. Great way to end our trip. They have a lot of fun drinks related to the show but me and my girls are jameson and beer drinkers so we didn't try any of them",
191,,2/2/2017,298,,"Sacramento, CA",Arti S.,0,4.0,14,"Came here because it is the bar that inspired How I Met Your Mother! Doesn't really look like the one in the show, but they did say ""inspire"" so I can't complain too much. I really liked the atmosphere and the food and drinks were pretty good! I loved that part of the drinks menu was named after things from the show! Will come again next time I'm in New York.",
192,,1/26/2016,1,,"Alvin, TX",Morgan T.,37,3.0,53,"Like many people we came here solely because of How I Met Your Mother. We made reservations online and didn't have to wait at all. The food was unreasonably expensive so my whole group just ordered salads and a HIMYM themed drink. I liked the touches like that - the photos and HIMYM menu - it was cute. The salads were good, but as I said, overpriced. Good atmosphere, but not worth it.",

194,,11/6/2015,81,,"New York, NY",Morgan D.,203,3.0,138,"As a big fan of how I met your mother, this bar was similar- cheap food, good beers on tap. I think it's a pretty fun/cool divey bar in the 50s. Good place to stop in if you're in that area.The orange cream-sickle is a little funky, I would stick to beers!",
195,,12/12/2016,0,,"Peoria, AZ",Kerry M.,0,5.0,9,"The atmosphere of this bar is perfect with two stories of fun. Our bartender Kevin was by far one of the most personable people I have ever met. Not only is he just awesome , he has a fantastic accent and shared many great stories about Ireland. Kevin is funny, sweet, and made me a fabulous drink. Kevin made sitting in a bar stool enjoyable and fun.",
196,,6/14/2015,1,1,"Austin, TX",Liz A.,0,2.0,10,"I don't recommend this place at all. It has little resemblance to HIMYM.Service: Super slow. We spent 2 hours there and only had 2 drinks & 2 entrees. Served lukewarm tap water with no ice. We had to ask for the check twice, and it took 10 minutes to get it back after I walked it up to the waitress.Food: Sliders were slightly burnt with absolutely no garnishes. One long slice of a pickle on the side. Fries were nothing special.",1

The bartenders are always pleasant and the drink prices are very reasonable (between $9-11 for drinks with a decent amount of liquor in them) Plus, If you are a 'how I met your mother' fan it makes the visit even more fun. Highly recommend.",
198,,7/5/2016,7,,"New York, NY",Ana C.,2,2.0,4,Drinks were okay nothing special for the price. My reason for the 2 stars is because of the food. We order something simple as Nachos and the meat was so under cooked my friend got sick. I understand things happen but we didn't even touch our food and the staff never bothered to ask if everything was okay. I can find a better Irish bar in the area.,1

Show "" how I met your mother "" .... it has 2 levels ... pretty noisy on both levels ... tvs at the bar area both up stairs and down ... I would say nothing really that special about the food but cool hang out place ...",
