Seemed like a few regulars were hanging out and watching the World Cup. Our bartender was attentive, but not overbearing.While they have an extensive menu to be a sports bar, I went with the Turkey Cuban Panini. I was a bit skeptical about it being too dry, but they made it perfectly and the fries had just the right amount of crisp.I wish I stuck around long enough to play some board games, but I'll save it for next time. Dark Horse has the perfect ambiance for any occasion. A+ all around.",2,,

It was very meh, and the fries were just fine.  The food here is really just to keep you balanced while drinking it would appear.  I did like the very large and well stocked and well accommodating bar area so I'd stop back in to drink and watch some sports again I'm sure.",1,,

It had a fun and relaxed ambiance.  Happy hour was great $6 wells, and huge beer selection. The bartenders were quick and attentive even though we were sitting in the bar area and not right up at the bar. Drinks we're a great price. The food was very good for a sports bar. Had the chicken fingers with the Thai sweet and spicy chilli sauce. I had a grilled shrimp salad on their specials menu which was over greens and came with ranch.  The Caprese Panini was AMAZING! Delicious Proscuitto, with fresh mozzarella and tomato.I would love to come back to this bar again!",1,,

Updated review","An excellent if casual Irish American bar. A truly extensive beer selection and a liquor supply that rivals the Brandy Library. Food is standard American bar fare made well and served piping hot. Clientele is always an eclectic mix of locals, workers and tourists. Plenty of tv's and sports coverage but not noises and always a decent sound track. Events periodically including the award winning comedy club on a Saturday. And that is a good craic. Continued expanse of spirits and the beer is always fresh. Good vibe. Lots of sports and not too loud music. Slainte!",,,

27,Adam D.,"México, D.F., Mexico",2028,1424,1934,4.0,6/24/2016,"This may sound implausible, but there aren't that many solid pub options in Tribeca. Dark Horse is one of the few and this Dark Horse pulled through in a time of need. That awkward transition during the week between breakfast and lunch when you don't quite want breakfast but a lot of places aren't yet open for lunch. Dark Horse was open before 11:30 so three of us went there and were the only ones in the joint.Our authentic Irish server was very pleasant and refused to tell me her name so I could give her high praise in this review. How humble. Or perhaps that's because she bent the rules on the Yelp check-in deal by giving the third drink free after the purchase of two, even though I didn't have two or planned to drink the third.The Dark Horse burger was huge, tasted fresh and contained a unique seasoning I can't quite pinpoint, though mine was served with red onion as opposed to the haystack onions advertised in the menu. It also was served with Jack Daniels Jameson gravy, but the burger was so good on its own, I didn't need any sauce. At $14, I thought that was pretty reasonably priced considering the location and the side of fries. They also have a pretty solid draft selection of about 20 or so options.I've previously been here only one other time, which happened to be on St. Patrick's Day. The place was nuts, but that's to be expected. I can't speak for what it's like under normal circumstances though I have to imagine it's an attractive lunch and happy hour venue for the Wall St. crowd.",11,4,7

30,Jenn P.,"Manhattan, NY",284,130,874,1.0,4/11/2016,"I actually use to love Dark Horse, until a recent event which left a bad taste in my mouth - so needless to say, I probably won't be back.On Friday night, I was meeting a friend at DH for drinks and maybe snacks (the food is pretty good).  I was waiting outside for my friend when, of course, my phone died.  I went inside the bar and found the nearest outlet, plugged my phone in, and texted him with where I was and that I was going to wait inside instead.  To be honest, I didn't think ANYTHING of this.I had been standing there for no less than thirty seconds when an employee of the bar walks up to me and asks me if I would like to place an order.  I explain to him that no, I'm OK for now, and that I'm waiting for my friend - when they get here, we will order together.  He then proceeds to cop an unnecessary attitude with me, telling me that I can't use their electricity if I'm not going to order anything.I'm standing here, pretty dumbfounded, especially seeing as I already explained to this guy that I was going to order shortly.  If you're at a restaurant, do you order food before your whole party arrives?  No.  When you're sitting at a bar, if you say you're ordering when your friend arrives, do they make you get up?  No.  I felt very singled out.  It was awkward.  Additionally, I was sober and polite, so I didn't think he had any need to mistrust me.  I considered explaining to this person that I've been to Dark Horse probably 10-15 times, so I'm a pretty good customer, and repeating that I had a friend coming... but the truth of the matter is that the damage had already been done.  Why are you accusing me of just using you for electricity, and then basically calling me a liar when I explain the situation?I unplugged my phone and waited outside for my friend.  When their cab got there, I got in it too and we went elsewhere.  Huge fail.",12,5,2

That vibe permeates the place the moment you enter. But it's also a pretty good tavern for reasonably priced grub and libations in this part of town. With the rain coming down before our walking ghost tour of the Brooklyn Bridge, it was a haven for us.Though the menu had some great bargains as far as American dining goes, we three opted to get a large appetizer sampler instead. I'm not sure the array of comfort favorites like mozzarella sticks, Buffalo wings, spring rolls, and chicken fingers really showcased the chef's culinary chops, but FWIW, we had no complaints. The bourbon drink on their cocktail menu was not available and the Old Fashioned they made was kind of weak, but I'm no OF snob...yet.Probably deserved a 3.5 from this visit, but the charmingly curt waitress bumps it up for me.

Service was great and the bartender had a smile on the whole time. Last but certainly not least, the food.

I've passed by this place many times but never actually ate inside because I could never tell if they were open or not. The windows are darkened. So I was excited to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised to see this was a legit pub, good selection of beers, a real wooden long bar with real stools (not a short plastic counter trying to be trendy bar with fancy stools) with sports on the tvs. The booths in the dining area were wood too.Our server was nice and paid a lot of her attention to the coworker who was talking about yelp. I can't blame her since she wants the restaurant to get a good review. I just hope she pays attention to people who don't review on yelp.I ordered the sierra nevada and their signature dark horse burger. The burger itself came out fine, and the fries were a bit on the colder side. The burger was a pretty large size and the Jack Daniels gravy was not really that good. I thought the burger wasn't that interesting and not as good as I was expecting. The menu did a good job. The chef also forgot to put the onions on the burger as stated on the menu and I didn't realize it until I was almost done with the burger since I was too busy stuffing my face. I didn't bother telling the server because she was nice and I didn't want them giving me a discount.Overall, good place to drink beer. Just don't expect this place to have good food but a cold beer will likely make it better.",,,

I shared the promo with everyone around me and made them download the Yelp app, lol.I ordered the coconut shrimp and a side of sweet potato fries.

The waitress is super nice and sometimes she gets sidetracked, you can't really blame her since she's one of two people working and she has a very positive attitude.Last visit, I got the Dark Horse signature burger which was a monster of a burger with a fried egg and bacon on top. Heart attack city, here I come. The runny egg definitely is good though, and it comes with fries to sop up any runny yolk leftover.Overall, this is definitely one of the go-to post-work bars in the area.

Loved listening to Eamon and Anna's Irish accents.We stopped by late on 4/22 and had another Irish Coffee and enjoyed their company once again. We'll definitely be back next time we're in NYC.",1,,1

There were 2 girls and 1 guy. One of the girls order hot water all night and the other one complaining about her Jameson and soda ""was too weak"") Anyway... we had sliders, nachos, calamary, WINGS, and lots of drinks because one of the bartenders can't drink cause she is pregnant so I drank for her . Everything was on point despite being crazy busy, and everyone on staff did a great job. Thank you guys, we had a great time and we'll see you soon.#WaterIsForQuitters",2,3,2
58,Ken C.,"New York, NY",0,103,3,2.0,12/2/2017,Decent taps but service is very spotty.  Buddy and I ordered beers - I got mine but the bartender then disappeared without bringing the second beer.  No one was behind the bar for the next 10 minutes.  Finally a second bartender appeared and she apologized noting she was supposed to be off shift 2 hours earlier and she was hoping the bar would empty out soon and she was just smiling and hoping for the best.  Ok.......   In any event we were there to watch the Big 10 and ACC championship games.  Instead they show some cheesy CBS sitcom rerun on Saturday - oh well.  So bizarre.,,,

The food is quite good, and I'm a big fan of their chicken pot pie. They're one of the few bars which have Newcastle, which is another big plus for me. The only thing is, some of their TVs are old or need repair because the quality of the games we were trying to watch were very high. The staff were nice and attentive though, and I'd return if there were a good game on.",,,

Updated review","Erin has the most beautiful smile!! I went twice in one day just to see her gorgeous smile and have a very reasonably priced Laphroig old fashioned.My second go round, there was a male bartender that wasn't nearly as welcoming but I feel for him. He was dealing with some spiteful women down the bar that kept talking about how much they hate everything and everyone. Once they left he was way more chill. I get it dude, those women sucked at life but don't let them dull your shine!The barback was also pretty awesome, a bit OCD which was wonderful! I've barely ever been around someone as OCD as myself! My placemat, napkin, silverware, coasters were all level and parallel! I love that guy!Gotta visit more often!",,1,1

The app was good, but the steak turned to be better than we expected of a steak place with $$.You might be sensitive to beer odor when walk in, or you might don't expect too much of the modest sign outside, - but the food and service definitely worth to try them",,,

His Irish brogue adds to his charm which did not need any adding too. My wife and I had salmon and prime rib and there may be better but only open to interpretation.   Televisions to watch the various games were plentiful and of good quality. Nice decor, safe neighborhood, and plentiful parking makes this a triple threat.",,,

Updated review","I'm late on this review. My view has a more positive vibe this time around. Came here again with two of my coworkers who are regulars, I came back a few other times too but I keep forgetting to review. But, I remembered getting a chicken sandwich, I can't remember exactly which one, with fries. It was delicious, I couldn't complain or I would've left a review. I forgot to write this review.

68,Calvin W.,"Lansing, MI",125,3,0,5.0,9/12/2016,"My wife and I came to Dark Horse because we were visiting from out of town and needed a place to watch a football game. We went in got a couple drinks and soon realized we made the right decisions. The game we wanted to watch was already on, but the bartenders made it clear to us that if we wanted a game that wasn't on, they would switch to it for us.The drinks were great, and the bartenders made for a laid back and welcoming environment. Aslo, shout out to Sean and his awesome music mix (we bonded over our love of Justice and Daft Punk).Anyway, this is a great place to go to catch a game, hang with friends. I wish we lived in NYC to come back to this place more often.",,,
69,Rebecca T.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/16/2017,"The first few times I went to this bar I loved it. The bartender Fitz (I believe his name was) was so welcoming and kind. I had really great service. The most recent time I went we had a new server, Eamon. He was EXTREMELY rude to us. He would come to the table with an attitude, didn't smile or really interact with us at all. When he would bring us food, he proceeded to slam it on the table. I'm never coming back to this place because he was absolutely terrible. The foods good for a reasonable price and they have cheap happy hour specials, but it's definitely not worth it to me",,,2

For a moment, there were as many servers as customers. As it was the place never had more than eight people in the whole place. We were looking for a place to have a cold beer in the a/c after humping across the Brooklyn bridge and back in late summer humidity, and the Dark Horse fit the bill nicely. We chatted with the bartender about her impending Colorado trip, traded some tips, and talked about local transportation. We each bought one beer, and each got one for free. Four beers for under $10 in the FiDi? Sounds like I'll be back.",2,2,1

Typical Wednesday night - tables and booth are reserved for customers eating dinner and food, which is understandable (real estate is expensive.) The waitress / barkeep was welcoming and accommodating and that is almost an extinct trait in NYC.  I like that the volume was moderate and you can have a conversation here with the person sitting across the table from you without yelling.  This is just simply a normal down to earth bar.  No fancy cocktails, no romantic candles, no obnoxious preppy bankers.  Beers were cold and perfectly carbonated - believe it or not, in the area this is not something one takes for granted.  Good happy hour specials and friendly bartenders. As with all places in NYC,  have a little patience when they are busy and you will be taken care of.  First time here and I wouldn't hesitate to come back.",5,3,4

First off the service is wonderful. Eamon was a great bartender and a very attentive server. We never had an empty drink, food was prompt, and we had wet naps before we could think to ask for them. We got wings, loaded fries and the bruschetta. They were all great. The bruschetta had a unique bbq taste to it, the wings were plentiful, and you can never really go wrong with fries.The atmosphere isn't for everyone but I enjoyed it. It has a divey feel and plays music for an older crowd. I like that kind of music and I don't mind dives so I had a good time. I'll be back if I'm in the area.

They even have a phone charging station with various cables behind the bar to charge your phone for you!! Though they didn't have many stouts or porters on tap, they did have a great variety.  What's best is their check-in offer: a free drink with a purchase! Okay, sold :)Sara discovered they had Delirium Tremens on tap and was in heaven, and I got the Blue Point Toasted Lager.  Yum!  I also got an order of hot wings (and the sauce was actually really spicy.... novel idea, eh?) and Sara got the coconut shrimp.  Both were very tasty, but the best part was that everything was well priced.

Our server did come over to explain the health inspectors were there but never explained that it meant the kitchen would be shut down during that time. When the manager came out, she paid no attention to us. After an hour, we finally reached out to the manager and she finally came over to explain the situation. She claimed there was miscommunication and she thought we knew the kitchen was shut down in that time. She clarified that it was on its way out and that she would buy us dessert. I explained that I would rather have our bill comped for all the time we waited. Her response ""oh yeah, absolutely but I still want to buy your dessert."" Well fast forward to after dessert, we get our bill, mostly to check what the total would have been for tipping our server, since it wasn't his fault. We explained to our new waitress that we were told the bill was going to be comped. She went to check with the manager who came right over and said she had explained she was going to comp our desserts. We tried explaining that she said she would get the bill. She again claimed there was miscommunication. Luckily, she quickly just said she would take care of it and wished us a good day and tried to throw in that it's been a crazy day. Not our fault the health inspector showed up. But nonetheless, the food was EXCELLENT. Just needs work on management and communication!",,,

The quesadillas and wings did not disappoint but luckily one of us was hungry enough to order from the entree portion of the menu because Sean presented her with one of the best roast beef sandwiches I ever tasted. Speaking of Sean, he is what made this review 5 stars. On a hot day after making a trek from the WTC to Chinatown and back the last thing we wanted to encounter was a rude or disinterested server. Sean was not only polite and welcoming, he was engaging personable and very affable AND he had what every good barkeep SHOULD have, a go to move! The ladies with me weren't to particularly interested in the printed cocktail choices and asked Sean for a recommendation. It's moments like these at a bar where the situation turns all Seinfeld, the analytic neurons start firing, the pupil becomes the holy inferno.

We sat at a booth and ordered our drinks and an appetizer sampler to share. We weren't looking for high quality food so the standard mozzarella sticks, spring rolls, buffalo wings were edible. What really made this place suck was that towards the end of us being there, I caught my friend's eyes looking at the floor. I knew that couldn't be good and I thought he saw a rat. Instead it was a roach just running out lively towards the bar area. That was it. We paid our check and left.

I stopped in for a 1pm Mets game and redeemed a free beer by checking in without a problem. The beer selection was strong. If I see a Lagunitas IPA on draft, I won't complain. The bartender, Cassie, also poured a perfect Guinness which earns her points immediately. I had some wings with the Jameson chipotle sauce. The sauce was delicious and the wings still had a crunch. I wasn't hungry enough to try more just yet but when I do, maybe the 5th star will be needed. I also really was intrigued by their cocktail menu. As I said, I will be back.",1,,

Last time in, I had the nachos (meh, not awful, but not good) and the buffalo chicken strips (not good- dry chicken, tasted as if it had been frozen for a long time, weak sauce... Not like a figure of speech there- the sauce was pretty weak and not tasty). My companion first ordered a Blue Moon that tasted really off (like even worse than a Blue Moon usually tastes). Sent it back in favor of a Sierra Nevada and, again, tasted off- kinda watery and flavor was muted. Neither were as cold as they should have been. So with two beers not quite right, I'm thinking their system is off or they're not cleaning the lines.I'd like to really like this place- no pretension, good mixed crowd (harder and harder to find in Manhattan), comfortable...

The tid bits were in separate small slices of bread which made it extremely easy to eat and it was delicious. For entrees we split the dark horse burger I believe it's call and the Italian sandwich. Those were both very good. A great place to eat and drink,,,
107,Don F.,"Leominster, MA",0,2,0,5.0,8/14/2016,Had a great time at Dark Horse last night. Food was great and drinks were expertly made by Sean and John the Irish bartenders who also provided great conversation. Thanks!,,,
108,Annika K.,"Colts Neck, NJ",0,4,0,2.0,4/8/2016,"Came here after seeing the numerous positive reviews. Pros: - friendly wait staff who replaced our skunky drinks without any problemCons:- after being seated, it took us 15 minutes to order our drinks and food- dirty beer taps/old, flat draft beer (there was mold in the beer) - asked for a medium cheeseburger, it came out well-done and the cheese wasn't melted - fries tasted old",,,1

113,K. S.,"Fairfax, VA",23,82,4,3.0,12/7/2014,Ate here after we went to the 9/11 museum/memorial after wandering around on a late rainy evening (everything else was closed). Wasn't sure about this place after we came in--it is pretty dark inside and has a pretty loud crowd. Ordered a Panini and I was impressed...as I didn't expect much from a bar-type place. Would recommend if you are looking for a reasonably priced place to eat in the financial district.,1,,1
114,Wickerlady V.,"Seattle, WA",2,152,14,5.0,7/9/2014,"Went here for the world cup semi finals, and what a roar that was! The place was packed but not uncomfortably. The waitresses were attentive and yet left us alone to enjoy the match. The food (veggie burger and wrap) were surprisingly good, and so were the veggie spring rolls. Yelp check in was painless and the waitresses didn't mind at all that all 3 of us used our free drink with check in coupon.Love to go here again",3,,1
115,Julie B.,"North Arlington, NJ",0,28,0,4.0,7/27/2016,"Pleasant experience from start to finish. Good, varied menu. I had a pulled pork sandwich with a salad substituted for fries and it was delicious! Reasonable prices (especially for the area), good drink specials, friendly service. Happy hour runs all day, which is great! Good pours on the drinks too. The only thing that makes me not give 5 stars is not including any wine in the drink specials. The house wine has a good flavor. It would be a big benefit for wine drinkers to include one house white & one house red in the drink specials.",,,

118,Glen N.,"Baltimore, MD",0,54,0,5.0,6/2/2014,"Opened my account today to sing the praises of Dark Horse, the great food, and its hilarious bartender Eamon. The place is in the financial district, so it is clearly more of a weekday/happy hour bar, but if you are going to the 9/11 memorial on the weekend, like I was, and want to grab a bite, this is literally a five minute walk.I don't want to set the entertainment bar too high, because the place was not busy when we decided to visit, but we were greeted by the Irish bartender Eamon, who I would actually be friends with as he was friggin' hilarious. The place was clean and after telling Eamon how annoyed we were with all the crap lunches we managed to stumble upon over the weekend, he promised the food was great.Eamon was 100% correct! My wife and I got a range of food, from salad, to sliders, to cheese covered gravy fries. Everything was excellent and tasted polished, seriously!Look, I am not some fufu food reviewer who rates my food on how properly the potatoes were blanched prior to serving, if that is even a ""thing"" people look for...I do know that I paid a butt load of money, for a butt load of food, at five star restaurants this weekend, and the only place I am leaving a review for is Dark Horse.I left feeling like a happy fat kid who just ate a bunch of awesomeness!",4,2,1
119,Josh F.,"New York, NY",68,2,0,4.0,1/16/2016,"Great beer choice, some fun cocktail choices, good selection of scotch and whiskey, and a relatively good menu in terms of choices.

124,Denesha R.,"Ithaca, NY",173,39,13,3.0,3/16/2014,"I went to a comedy show here, didn't know what to expect but went with an open mind.  The bar/restaurant has a good ambiance and I could see that it would be a decent place to hang out and have a couple drinks and some food.The comedy show area is located below in the basement section.  The place is small but neatly arranged with tables, chairs and it's own bar. We were ushered in and helped to our seats, the staff seemed pleasant but not overly so.  Drinks and food are a little pricey as is expected for this kind of event, the best thing is we didn't have a long wait for our drinks or food. The food for me was meh......hot wings were indeed spicy which was a plus.The show itself was a hit and miss with the comedians, it was a bit brutal to watch some of the comedians who came up and just didn't deliver.  This made me think that this was a hell of a job to have and  to excel in.Overall the place is clean, neatly arranged, has a good vibe and can provide you with decent enough entertainment.",4,2,2

At this point, there were probably 15 people. Went to the bartender and was told that service at the booth will be horrible so to the bar we went.It took at least 20 minutes to get a drink (not packed. Around 20-25 people). Order food or beer and get a grunt & an abrupt ""ok"". We never received an apology for the long wait or the neglectful attitude.The food itself was decent. 3.5/5. The hot wings were actually hot. Beer prices ok for the city. If the service was better, it'd be a solid sports bar to watch the game.--Apparently I was called out at the bar for my review, called a liar & malicious. Found out that the ""service would be horrible"" was miscommunicated. The situation was completely mishandled - after clearing the air, the bartender was super apologetic.The strangest and most emotional experience I've had at a bar (talking tears - not kidding..) - not to mention the Giants were getting killed..

Also respect the fact that they let the Yelp! buy one get one coupon apply to Delirium Tremens, event though its $10 a pop! Definitely has the feel of a local bar that isn't out to nickel and dime you.Will say its more of a bar atmosphere than I was expecting based on the reviews, set up like your standard long and narrow pub with the bar along one wall and a mix of high tops and booths along the other and in the back. TVs line the walls in a single row a bit above eye level all the way around, very nice feel over the standard one wall with as many TVs as possible crammed in to it.Overall happy I stopped by and will be back at some point or another.",2,,

145,Andrew S.,"Manhattan, NY",143,90,2,4.0,9/19/2013,"The Dark Horse knows how it do it right, especially if you're looking for a perfect place for your Fantasy Football draft. They provide free Wifi, and the many tables and open spaces promise to give your group plenty of space to spread out and get setup without worry of other patrons hitting your computer.You'll find the food here is solid, with a few items that are great, and a few lackluster. On the great side, the Dark Horse burger is a shining example of deliciousness. It's a monster, and contains everything from Bacon and fried egg to gravy sauce, all served with any toppings you could want. The only thing missing is the kitchen sink, and it's wonderful. On the not so great scale, the wings have an odd aftertaste and feel like they could be the type of frozen food wings you could find at the local grocery store and fry yourself. It could have just been our batch but I'd shy again from them as the rest of the menu holds up well.Beer specials are abundant, and the service is always quick and ready to provide a refill to keep you going as long as you want. Around happy hour time the crowd picks up, but never feels as crowded as so many other places in the area. If you want to mix it up a little, or watch a game and feel like you need a few more screens in your life, I recommend stopping by.",4,,

Updated review","Comment to the owner Gavin: My family and I were vacationing in New York at the time and I actually talked them into going to dark horse for lunch. I thought the ambience of the restaurant was great. We went on Saturday December 6, 2014 at about 2pm. The restaurant was 3/4 empty at the time. After the fact, we went to another Irish pub in time square and it was fantastic. What really made our experience at your restaurant horrible was the waiter. I don't think your customers and guests should be treated as though they are eating for free and that your employees are doing the customers a favor. I'm sorry but, Bad for business. Waiter had a heavy accent, didn't catch his name. Bus boy was very nice.",,,
168,GarGuPi L.,"Flushing, NY",86,495,1595,4.0,3/23/2013,"As promised, I avoided the St Paddy's crowd and visited a pub this weekend instead. Oh, what a difference! The pub was quiet, serene, and mellow on a Saturday afternoon.  Much the contrast from last weekend.  Situated on a quiet block near City Hall, it is also right next to one of my favorite Japanese bakeries, so brunching there today was like killing two birds with one stone. Score! I made a reservation (really for the points) and this was my very first time to see a ""reserved' sign rested on a booth table.  Wow! Talk about special treatment. Only two waiters were on call, but we were still adequately attended and my waiter was a friendly lad with an Irish accent.  Sort of felt like transporting back to A Dublin pub...aside from the blaring sport games on the numerous, surrounding TVs. The brunch menu was an excellent deal.  You get your entree plus an alcoholic beverage.  Mom chose the turkey club sandwich (plus a side of fries) for only $10! The portion was really enough to share, but she soldiered on and cleaned the plate.  Its not gourmet sandwich, but the kitchen was definitely very generous with the turkey breast, bacon, and freshly fried potatoes. The only nitpicking is that the white bread toast got hard when cooled off. But that's expected.  I've heard accolade about the spare ribs and that's what I chose.  Basked in a sticky, sugary BBQ sauce, the meat was fall off the bone, but the sauce was a bit too heavy and thick.  Instead of sweet potato fries, we went for a healthier route and substituted with steamed vegetables. The waiter was happy to oblige my request.  Now don't expect the kitchen to skimp on the vegetables despite this being a pub. No sirree, I even got two stalks of asparagus, diagonally cut zucchini, broccoli florets, and crinkled-cut carrot slices.  The plate looked so gourmet that you would suspect it came from a higher graded kitchen.  To further add inches to my waist, we closed the meal with a chocolate moltenlava  cake with a scope of vanilla ice cream.  I was not expect JG's eponym and ours proved to be too cooked, lacking the runny flow that we yearned.  No matter.  Chocolate is still chocolate. Not something that we would leave it resting there.  Even my coffee was strong and hot.  Yes, even better tasting than Starbucks.   Once again, I enjoyed my relaxing brunch moment and so glad I made the decision to visit DH.  I can't comment on what it's like during Happy Hour or the wee hours, but during the off-peak hours, it's an adequate for some affordable grubs along with some inebriation.",4,1,4
169,Sue H.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",81,104,28,4.0,2/1/2015,Came here to watch the superbowl! Great food and friendly staff. Loved that it had seats upstairs and downstairs to accomodate large groups. Will return again!,2,,2
170,renje g.,"Brooklyn, NY",291,1038,4,4.0,2/26/2014,"+++- Free beer with Yelp! check in, and you don't have to purchase anything++- Personal TVs at a few tables if you're lucky enough to get them- $5 beer happy hour even on weekends+- Environment is cool and laid back- Staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu+/-- I wasn't served for awhile after sitting, the plus is because they didn't bother me if I just wanted to come in and watch the game, the minus is if I happened to want something at the time- Seems like a cool place to hang out and watch a random game, but didn't seem like the kind of place people go to watch particular games. I was looking for a place where everybody was cheering and booing for the same game, maybe it was me, but I didn't get that-- Only one server; could probably get frustrating when really busy- TVs didn't have sound, music was playing over everything",,,
171,James A.,"Brooklyn, NY",579,26,49,1.0,5/20/2015,Standard pub for a quick drink. The bartender was nice but at 5:30pm on a weekday they charged me $8 for a draft. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap which was pretty gross. It's a sports bar but the TVs are pretty old and small. Don't see any reason to go here again.,1,,
172,Sean M.,"New York, NY",3,4,1,5.0,2/10/2015,"Grab yourself a great IPA, chill out at the bar, watch your choice of games, and most definitely devour some Jameson Chipotle wings!!! Out of this world! One of my favourite downtown spots, and friendly staff and regulars!",2,,1

Updated review","Finally had a chance to see what the ""Happy Hour crowd"" vibe was here and wasn't disappointed.  You know that large office group that kind of takes over a huge section of the bar and might be getting a little too loud, but you're happy for them b/c they are having a great time and it's a sign that this is ""their"" place?  That's what was going on, and it created a fun energy.My original plan was to belly up at the bar, but my friends and I had to grab a booth in the back.  I'm glad we did b/c it opened up a whole new world to me.  Each booth has their own personal TV and the booth felt just the right amount of isolated so my friends and I could talk, enjoy the game, and get great service.Our server Ann was so spectacularly fast that I almost couldn't believe it, b/c she was working hard w/ the above mentioned office-happy hour.  I never had to wait for a drink and she had great food recommendations.  The wings and sliders remain excellent.  The calamari had good potential but came out slightly (ever so slightly) under cooked.  All in all a good time was had.One point deducted b/c the need to update their website AND scrolling advertisements on their in-house screen.  Both said they still have their Wednesday Prime Rib deal but that is no longer true.Side note....Really bummed out about Leah J's review below.  I hope management sees it and addresses it.",1,,1
174,Trina T.,"Seattle, WA",37,126,142,5.0,6/10/2015,"We were seated immediately and greeted by a friendly waitress. As a family, we ordered the fajita, dark horse burger, the entree special of sautéed chicken, fish and chips and pulled pork sandwich. We also shared calamari as a starter. We enjoyed everything we ate. The calamari was fresh and had a generous portion. The entrees were large portions too and we finished everything off our plate. We can imagine this place being a popular night spot, each booths had a TV screen and this makes it a great place to watch sports.",,,1

I have trouble leaving this place.If you want to watch a game they are always happy to put your team on one of the many screens.It's become my second lounge room! The Steak Frites and Chicken Franciese are my fav's on the menu. Great finger food as well if you want to soak up the drinks in a booth.",2,,

I had a couple of beers w/my bf and the chicken quesadilla. Totally delish and worth the gaming experience!I highly recommend this is a go-to sports bar in the area.,1,,1

186,Janet T.,"Flushing, NY",1,13,0,4.0,3/16/2013,"Two phrases: ""Rib Night"" and ""Prime Rib Night"".  What else do you need to know, other than the former is Tuesday and the latter is Wednesday?  Get going!Seriously, the food here is great, along with the choice of beer.  You can get the usual pub fare such as buffalo wings, cheese burgers, fish 'n chips, and all are good.  My personal favorite here is the pulled pork, but I'm there on one of the aforementioned nights I'm sorely tempted to get ribs or steak.  For the price, it can't be beat!Whether you're there for a specialty night or just there to hang out, you should find something to enjoy here.",1,,2

192,Kim B.,"Manhattan, NY",128,58,0,3.0,6/21/2013,"3.5 starsI came across a special at this restaurant while browsing the internet. $9.95 for Ribs and Prime Rib on Tuesdays and Wednesdays respectively. We were not expecting great food because prices like that in NYC are pretty much unheard of.Well, we were pleasantly surprised! The waitress said the ribs come in 5, so we made the mistake of thinking they would be small and also ordered wings as an appetizer. The portions were large and the food was really tasty!The place was very quiet so didn't have much of an atmosphere. But I can imagine it's a great spot to watch your favorite sports game as each booth has their own individual TV.Our waitress was pretty attentive for the most part but got a bit lazy and disinterested towards the end.So, great food, good service and fantastic prices! Thumbs up.",1,,

Fried, cheese, bacon with a side of ketchup and gravy. Can you say heart attack?Bartenders were ok, just wish they would smile instead of looking like they don't wanna be there.",,,

I would definitely recommend this place and would come back over and over again.,1,,1
