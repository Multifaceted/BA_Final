At least what I remember of it was great, because most of the time I was lost in an alcoholic haze, fueled by frequent trips to the bathroom to powder my nose. The place was primarily frequented by upper west side sleazeballs, and they knew how to round out the early morning hours.Glad I don't live there anymore. I got out while I was just about alive.

I think the core culture of the actual Columbia probably belongs to its glorious undergrads. But I felt like observing NY college students life,since I was more in the UK college scene. I gotta say some little folks were quite dodgy .. (its a clusterfck college bar unlike the better organized College bars like Oxford Unions etc.) binge eating fast foods at college cafeteria was very weird too. It was also hard to meet people who can discuss business/technology like at Stanford. Occasionally met some non dodgy people. cheap drinks tho.  Don't mean to attack on Columbia people, which include some great folks , like my professor.

First of all we all know what they're low key REALLY trying to say, second of all why does a shitty dive bar have a dress code?And it didn't stop there. I went to the bathroom and on the women's door there was yet another offensive sign indicating that the ladies room is for women only and no men are allowed (see other pic) I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt that they are trying to prevent cisgender men from harming women as there have been some incidents in the city of women being assaulted by men in bar bathrooms HOWEVER this combined with the other sign...

These older creeps hang out at this bar because it is populated by Columbia students, many of whom are under age which is deliberate because that's what kind of girl the owner likes; this place is packed Thursday through Saturday night and does not do anything to prevent people from leaving in states so I need created that something may happen to them once they leave the bar; they don't care!

There one bar tender that very cool he's usually there during the day. Other than that I think people only go there because the college is so close and there aren't many other places in the immediate neighborhood.

Sure, it's cheap and easy and unpretentious, but there is absolutely a false pretense of exclusivity that they try to create with the line. The most disappointing part is trying to sweet talk the bouncer to let you in, fail 5 times consecutively, then FINALLY get in only to realize the whole bar is half full.",1

The customers and locals make their own rules and other new customers are just suppost to follow. Waited 2 hours to play pool with my friend, put my money in the table and then here comes a rude customer saying I must play with him because he won last game and thats the unspoken rule of the bar. How is that even fair. I payed money and waited for a stranger to play with me for free.

I'm not alone in this opinion. I had to convince my friends to go last time. And they were right: everyone was brusque, and unfriendly. From the mega evil eye stare from the bouncer; urban outfitters ""edgy"" type bartender futzing with her phone instead of taking orders; and the undergrads sitting on the nice old pool table, which used to be so well kept, now it's all covered in beer... and then they closed very early (~1am)! Saturday. No heads up that it's coming. ""Last call."" Now in my experience last call works like: you can't order anymore beer, but you have like five to fifteen minutes to finish your beer. Particularly if it's without any warning at all. That's how it works everywhere on the planet. But within a minute they're yelling at us to get lost. Last call! Get out! ""Really? I misunderstood I guess. Can I drink this really fast? I literally just got it and I wouldn't have ordered it if I'd known you guys were gonna close up early."" Nope. It's get out now or we have a problem. Straight to physical intimidation, when I complain about the awful service...Oh well. So yeah, I'm done with this place.",6

You can never find seats because kids are always making out on them, or 1 person is hogging a booth all to themselves, or there are come super creepy clearly-not-students preying on poor freshmen, whose fake IDs couldn't fool a squirrel. The place is grungy, sticky, the bathroom is reminiscent of a used sponge, and sometimes it gets so crowded I contemplate ending my own life.

I said that's fine, and he poured my drink quickly. When I went back to the bar after the first round, he glimpsed my face and asked another IPA? and then when I nodded, he asked my name - Sarah? - and held up my card without even me mentioning that I had a tab open, let alone my name.  Definitely will be back for a fun and laid back night -  that's guaranteed to have no frustration at the bar.",2

I enjoy going for a whiskey ginger on a Sunday evening - Tuesday, or during off hours on one of the other days. Wednesdays are senior night for Columbia which involves mass college shenanigans that make the dive-y bar unbearable. The floor is sticky, the cushions are basically sponges for beer, and you cannot find a seat to save your life. Don't get me wrong, I've been there at these times and have competed to get a drink from one of the lovely, young women tending bar, but it is not easy. I personally prefer the bottom of the barrel prices on quiet evenings and afternoons to meet up with friends and share a good brew. They have recently added in USB outlets next to the booths which are great for those of us with horrible battery lives. The drinks are all pretty standard, nothing too fancy. I usually order the whiskey ginger, which is always quite stiff and delicious. The wine is pretty basic, and the margaritas are only on ice.

They show odd things on TV sometimes (in a good way).The beer selection is limited compared to some of the newer places that want to have 70 beers on tap, but I've never found myself wanting for beer. They usually have staples like Brooklyn Lager and (if you like it) Yuengling.Best of all, you can get good and drunk here on a budget and still tip the nice bartenders well.There's a gigantic TV on the back wall that is surprisingly unobtrusive and they have a dartboard that's dangerously close to drinkers when the place is full. A final observation ... As far as college bars go, this one isn't the slightest bit ""fratty"" and has an air of laid-backness that separates it from some of the other swilleries in the neighborhood.

So you show up early because classes ended at 4pm, order your $3-4 beer and colonize a booth, and wait for the Columbia crowd to overtake the regulars-- mostly middle-aged single men in solitary worlds who are watching whatever porn or mainstream movie they're showing on the TVs.The bartender is sufficiently creepy (but nice) and, I think, drunk 97% of the time. I enjoy the vibe here, except when whatever annoying men at the pool table (there always seem to be gross hotshots at the pool table) decide to hit on my girlfriends and I when we're just looking for a quick drink in the neighborhood after work. This once devolved into a really circuitous argument between me and a guy I'd patently rejected (I'm a lesbian, duh) about how he didn't believe homosexuality happened in his country (India). I haven't been back to 1020 since then, but I don't blame the establishment; it just attracts some lurkers on a weekend night, and if you're a gay person looking for cheap drinks in that neighborhood, you're much better off going to Suite, which is a 2-minute walk away.",3

Once the dive bar that was maybe second or third on everyone's bar lists, 1020 has become one of the most exciting hang outs near campus (even more so than the Heights), which is a sad development for students. The good things.. it opens late (until 4am or later) and the beers are dirt cheap compared to elsewhere. The selection is not bad either. It's a pretty chill hangout and good place to meet people or get together with friends.The bad things... it can get really crowded, and the later you go, the drunker people get. Being in a crowded bar full of drunk frat boys is not that fun. Worse, sometimes there are very drunk older men (e.g. random 40-year-olds) who hit on the young college girls, and that is just unsightly and disturbing. The girl's bathroom can also get pretty disgusting as the night wears on, with the lines wrapping around the nearby pool table. 1020 is basically everything a dive bar should be.If you're short on cash, as most college students are, and you don't like to dress up for nightclubs, 1020 is a good place to hang out.  This is a nice place to hang out for a chill night, but after a few months, every night seems the same, and it gets old pretty quickly.  I'd recommend venturing out of the neighborhood rather than settling for this bar.",3

Everyone is nice, but don't come here to play darts or pool.  The dartboard has decayed to the point that nothing sticks near center.  The owner must not be a pool player.  The felt at one end ripples about 1/4"" off of the table like ruts in a mudded road for about the size of a rack.  I have never seen anything close to this in any bar in the world.  You have to shoot around it.  The locals say it is like playing on a wrinkled ""old lady"".",1

103,,10/6/2011,0,1,"Manhattan, NY",S. Z.,0,1.0,1,"I'm a Columbia student and I've been coming to 1020 for years. It was always a relaxed place to go on a work day or a convenient night out on the weekend; however, for better or worse I can say 100% assured that I will never patron 1020 again. (Imagine this last statement italicized for emphasis.) The story is long, but I will give you the short version. I wind up at 1020 on the eve of my birthday. I've been to plenty of other bars in NY where bartenders will hook a someone with a birthday up with a free shot or reduced-priced drink or at the very least take the smallest amount of energy to pretend they care enough to stomach simply saying ""Happy Birthday."" At 1020, the bartender's reaction was the complete opposite. He seemed completely disinterested and actually seemed kind of annoyed that I mentioned it was my birthday. When I ordered a Manhattan, he complained grumblingly that I was making him do too much work. He proceeded to serve every other customer at the more or less empty bar - it was a quiet Wednesday night - and when it seemed like he was finally coming over with my drinks, it was only to tell me he had forgotten my order. The cherry on the cake came when I mentioned how long it had taken him to serve me and he burst out at me, telling me in an unnecessarily chastising demeanor that I had in fact never given him my drink order (a blatant lie.) At this point I told the bartender that I would prefer not to have that Manhattan and I would go to another bar where they would be at least a little enthusiastic that it was a special day for me. To this he responded, and I quote: ""The more you say it's your birthday, the less I care.""Following this incident, I tried to contact the management on half a dozen occasions via phone and by going in to the bar to inform them that they might want to think about changing up their hiring qualifications. Perhaps, including friendly in their search description. I was never able to get in touch with anyone other than other bartenders manning the place.All that said, I hope the fine folks at 1020 see this and reconsider certain bartenders on staff and that any Columbia students that want to hit up a local bar that's relaxed, but not to the point of rudeness, to check out some of the fine places on Bway.",2

You can score 2 dollar pints of red hook during happy hour which is a story that pretty much writes its self.  The place changes significantly when the late night rolls around. Mostly becomes drunk college kids / grad students who didn't feel like making the trek downtown. A great place to have available.,

After a few repeat trials, the crowding and rampant making out and bad movies kinda becomes your thing, regardless of your previous opinion on divey ass places. Perhaps I no longer regret being too lazy to walk to La Negrita. And girls can pretty much expect with certainty to be massively hit on, I think.",1

And if you go to Barnard or Columbia, you're going to spend 50% of your nightlife time here. It's like some weird magnetic pull - towards the end of my time at the 'nard, we would start out the night saying we wanted to go anywhere BUT 1020...and 3 hours later we would always end up there. The crowd is a pretty nice mix. On Saturday nights it can be overwhelmingly Columbia people, but usually it's a mix of pretty attractive locals and the school crowd. There are definitely underage people (I may or may not have been one of them), but they've gotten stricter about that, and it's never overpowering. The young ones usually camp out in the back near the bathroom for some reason. Yes, the bar is miserable when it's too crowded. But there's often this perfect din where it's crowded but not packed, and there's music going and people playing pool and suddenly you're in the middle of a 2 hour discussion with some random guy about Plato. Or nachos, or something. It doesn't matter. This bar just kind of brings groups together.",

With a group, head to the back where you'll find a projection screen, usually showing a sporting event, and a kind of secluded 'VIP' area with low couches and a coffee table.
