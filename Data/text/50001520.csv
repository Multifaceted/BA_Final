0,Michael D.,"Santa Rosa, CA",153,114,6,5.0,11/18/2018,"Yeah, I know. Hotel restaurants? Many are ""meh."" Some are pretty good. Then, there's Friedman's. In a word, ""Wow.""Friedman's is not just a really good hotel restaurant. It is a stellar addition to the Time Square/theater district neighborhood, and a worthy successor to its still-lamented predecessor, known affectionately by many locals as ""The Polish Tea Room.""Friedman's does great breakfasts, and serves them all day. (The Nova Benny, eggs Benedict with lox instead of pork and potato pancakes instead of English muffins, should be available all the time, everywhere.) They do great sandwiches and entrees. (The cheddar waffle topped with a quarter of a deliciously fried chicken and a sweet-spicy syrup on the side? Again, wow.) Their breakfast pastries and dessert pies are equally impressive. (The key lime pie has no meringue, because it doesn't need one.) The place is friendly to those with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. (The signs promoting the restaurant declare its love for gluten-free people and food, and the servers we had asked about allergies each time we dined there.) The staff is uniformly friendly, professional, and helpful. Oh, and the space is open and inviting, with murals near the ceiling that echo those in the lobby of the Art Deco-era Edison Hotel that houses the restaurant. (A great place to stay, by the way.) And yes, Friedman's has a full bar, one of three in the hotel.To paraphrase the denizens of my former hometown, ""Friedman's? Go. Eat. You'll love it. What's not to love?""",1,,
1,Sarah S.,"Alexandria, VA",50,53,122,5.0,11/16/2018,"I was in NYC for work and happened into Friedmans! What a find. Can you imagine a place where you can order what ever you want and not get sick? Most people would say ""yes"" as if it's no big deal, but I have to be very careful.We were there for breakfast: my colleague and I (who is also allergic to gluten) ordered tea. She had the yogurt, fruit, and granola. I had the scrambled eggs with lox, tomato and GF bagel. They don't have dairy-free cream cheese, but they should add that option. Everything was fresh, well-made, and served promptly with a smile.The place had a nice diner ambiance and was very clean.AMAZING menu choices, food, and staff.",1,,
2,Vijay S.,"Providence, RI",255,768,1066,4.0,11/7/2018,"Good place for breakfast near Times Square. They have a few locations, this one's located within Hotel Edison.Got the fried chicken and waffle along with the house made granola and yoghurt both of which were pretty good. The habanero honey that came with the waffle was good. Bit expensive but large portion sizes. Also their fresh pressed juices are quite good. Overall good experience.",4,1,3
3,Matt G.,"Massapequa Park, NY",249,186,265,5.0,10/26/2018,"Had a little business trip in Manhattan this week and stopped here for breakfast and had a great experience. Was by myself so i sat at the bar where i was greated by a very friendly bartender. I ordered the pastrami hash with sunnyside eggs and rye toast. Everything was amazing. Pastrami was cooked perfectly as were the eggs. Portions were nice and hardy. Plenty of food for me and im a big eater. The pancakes and avacado toast also looked very good. Atmosphere was nice and open, typical Manhattan feel. Definitely recommend!!",1,,1
4,Jonathan B.,"Mountain View, CA",24,117,542,4.0,10/14/2018,"This review is for breakfast/brunch/lunch but I suspect you'd find the same for dinner.The food near Times Square is usually dicey (at best) but Friedmans is an oasis in a food desert with lots of surprises. Surprise #1: It wasn't that busy at 11am on Thursday. We were shown to a very small table for two but they relocated us to a larger table when we asked. Surprise #2: Virtually everything on the menu is available gluten free. In fact, the server told us there were only four things on the menu that couldn't be made gluten free (one of them is matzo ball soup). Which leads us to ...Surprise #3: All of the servers are really friendly (Are you sure I'm in NYC?). The manager on duty even delivered some of our food when things got a little busier.On to the food:Blueberry pancakes: The gf pancakes were good but not great. There aren't blueberries IN the pancakes but rather a blueberry compote on top of the pancakes. The syrup seemed authentically Vermont maple. Pastrami hash with sunny-side eggs: Yum. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a large portion with lots of tasty pastrami. I tried but I couldn't finish it all.We also ordered a side of scrambled eggs which were delicious. The server later told us that they are scrambled with heavy whipping cream. Definitely something I should try at home.Both the iced latte and the iced chai latte were tasty. (It's Colombe coffee, for those of you who care about that stuff.) There aren't a lot of reasonable food choices near Time Square but Friedmans should be high on your list.",,,
5,Janet D.,"Denver, CO",2294,2394,17898,5.0,9/7/2018,This is a few steps away from the W Hotel. Highly recommended by hotel staff and yelp. No kidding!Here I had their Steak and Eggs. The kicker here? It comes with a few perfectly cooked yuca. Different and so good! The skirt steak was tender. The two eggs were perfectly cooked. The Pastrami Hash? Get this too! Portion and taste you can't beat these two dishes! $21 and $17 respectively. Busy but the service was great. It is inside a hotel. Highly recommend!,6,6,10
6,Frank R.,"Pharr, TX",16,50,19,3.0,9/10/2018,"Hi, Friedman inside hotel Edison has a nice classy old time feel to it. The ambiance matches the Hotel. Waitstaff and all staff in general were very friendly and welcoming. I made the choice of getting the fried chicken and waffles it was goodBut the chicken was a little cold like it had been sitting there for a while. I like my fried chicken hot and fresh.",1,,
7,Ekta S.,"Farmington, CT",10,108,107,3.0,9/14/2018,"Ok so this place is quite right on Times Square, and quite nice for one in such a crowded area. The staff is polite and accommodating. I took my time deciding what to eat and the poor server had to come back thrice. She did so with no complaints. The menu is nice, and would do perfectly for brunch, lunch or a coffee. I had the avocado toast, and instead of regular eggs I asked for egg whites. I guess it's my fault that the eggs felt a little oily; that's what happens when you scramble egg whites only. But toast was alright if a bit chewy, and the avocado was fresh.I am taking off the starts because there was zero seasoning on the eggs, the toast was chewy and prices are a little crazy for the product on offer. I might go back, but only because its convenient and because the staff is nice in a generally busy city.",,,
8,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,4.0,8/20/2018,"On Sunday 11am this place was packed which was no surprise since it's at the heart of Theatre District. For a party of 3 we waited about 20 minutes. The ambiance was classy with plenty of space, comfortable seating, bright lights and high ceilings. Nova benny - The poached eggs were a bit too well done. I felt that the potato pancake was too salty which did not go well with smoked salmon. The hollandaise sauce and side salad were great. Tomato soup - Phenomenal! For $5, the cup size was enough. It had great consistency and texture. I loved that it wasn't overly sweet or creamy like some places. Just perfect. I devoured it along with the perfect toast they provided. Prices seem a little high but portions were decent. Our waiter was super attentive. He checked up on us a little too much though. I will return to try dinner!",,,
9,Tracy D.,"Bartlett, IL",49,91,123,4.0,8/1/2018,"On a last minute trip to NYC my husband and I contacted my cousin to meet us up for brunch and trusty yelp led us to Friedmans. I was pleasantly surprised we were able to find a quality brunch place with hardly a wait on a Saturday near Times Square.The servers were were friendly, attentive and very accommodating even when my cousin ended up being an hour late. Just be aware they will not seat you unless your whole party is present. I ordered tbe waffle and it was fantastic! Fluffy on the inside with a nice slight bite on the outside. Topped with a giant dollop of whipped cream and fresh fruit! I also ordered a side of potatoes and they were seasoned well with a good crisp to them too! My husband, although he liked the pancakes, he did say he has had better at cheaper places. My cousin really enjoyed his brisket hash and demanded a bite to see if everything else was just as good as his meal was as well!All in all a great place for brunch that wasn't too pricey in Time's Square!",1,,1
10,Rebecca L.,"Baltimore, MD",69,293,700,5.0,10/17/2018,"Great location - super close to Times Square.  We came here for breakfast 2 days in a row due to their gluten free options!  The Acai smoothie was amazing.  Super thick, but so filling and delicious.  The eggs benedict was tasty, and their Mexican breakfast nacho (that's not the name) was delicious!!!  Would absolutely recommend to those with allergies!",,,
11,jonathan G.,"Belleville, NJ",243,44,84,5.0,9/14/2018,Best place for pre or post theater. Staff is attentive and quick. The food is fresh made to order and delicious. The avocado mash is my go to here. It's very creamy and pairs well with the tostones for dipping. They are friendly to dietary restrictions. They also make awesome cocktails and have a cute sophisticated bar. The location is beautiful and has a great atmosphere. I always come here for pre theater and they have never disappointed.,1,,1
12,Courtney C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",481,39,180,5.0,7/1/2018,"Went here for lunch as it's directly across the street from my job. Perfect choice! Literally, perfect for lunch. The decor is beautiful, so grand, but still manages to feel quite quaint. The dining room is massive with gorgeous fixtures. I had the turkey burger which was juicy and flavorful. It has jalapeño peppers inside the patty, but the taste isn't overwhelming. My coworkers had a range of things from the grain bowl to the French toast. (I sampled them all...yum!). The French toast had the prefect crisp outside with a moist, chewy inside. The grain bowl while sounding boring was anything but. I will definitely be back.",,,1
13,Barbara G.,"Capitol Heights, MD",3,21,5,4.0,10/25/2018,"The menu isn't extensive but what's on it is excellent. We were seated in under 5 minutes on a Sunday mid morning which was surprising. But we noticed a crowd about 39 minutes later so I guess we timed it perfectly. They were very amenable to altering menu items. I had an egg white omelette and asked for tomatoes, capers, ham and feta. They have me red peppers instead of tomatoes, but it ended up being really tasty so I didn't send it back. All in all I'd definitely go back for breakfast or brunch. Not sure about their lunch and dinner food. They do offer a discount for theater patrons with their ticket stub. I was a little upset that we couldn't get that deal as we were on our way to a show.",,,1
14,Alyson Y.,"Manhattan, NY",372,153,214,4.0,5/19/2018,"Love coming to this brunch place in the Theater District. It's a bit hidden now with all the construction going on. They have dinner options but they're mostly known for brunch. Service is EXCEPTIONAL. Super kind and friendly and one of the best I've had! Their chicken and waffles are apparently amazing but unfortunately I've never gone in with the appetite to try it.Egg white omelette: It's with farm fresh vegetables but they are super accommodating if you want something else. The fries can also be replaced with sweet potato fries (delicious) or hash.Hash: Potatoes, meat with 2 sunnyside eggs on top. Very well seasoned. Blueberry pancakes: Very dense and fluffy. Moist and not dry at all. All of their food looks and tastes delicious so you can't really go wrong.Average NYC prices but the portions are definitely enough to fill you. I would definitely come back and bring others back to try this place!",2,,
15,Caitlyn C.,"New York, NY",298,199,318,3.0,5/20/2018,"I didn't realize there was a Friedman's in Times Square until recently. I was pleasantly surprised to only wait a few minutes to be seated despite coming at a prime time to a busy area. This location of friedmans is huge and easily accommodate my group. The food at any friedmans is always high quality, fresh and delicious. This location was no exception. I was a little disappointed in our service however. Our waitress was friendly enough when she came to our table, but overall wasn't very attentive. She also messed up one of the orders that we explicitly spoke to her about when ordering. I think I would come back to this location out of convenience if meeting visiting friends in the area, but otherwise would stick to one of the other locations. I much prefer the cozy, small business vibe of the others.",,,
16,Sakoun P.,"Providence, RI",231,109,124,4.0,8/10/2018,"We unexpectedly came here on a trip to the City. We looked up nearby brunch restaurants and were surprised to find this restaurant in a hotel. It wasn't too busy on a Saturday morning, and we were seated promptly. Upon first glance at the menu, everything looked farm fresh and delicious! I ordered the French toast which was tasty, but I could've done without the berry compote on top. The service we received was excellent. This is a little on the pricier side for breakfast food, but I thought it was worth it.",,,
17,William G.,"Torrance, CA",2571,1691,3976,4.0,7/15/2018,"Brunch at its finest! My friends and I came here for brunch on our second day of extensive NYC exploration. I found this place on Yelp, so here we came.We walked in and found this place to be nicely decorated. It was a fairly busy morning for them, which is understandable as it was a Sunday morning, and this place sits not far from Times Square.We sat down and ordered some coffee. The coffee took a bit longer than usual to get to us. Same can be said about the food. However, we were pleased to see that the food was prepared well.My steak and eggs were delicious, although I wasn't a fan of the yucca. I ordered some bread on the side to make up for this.My friends enjoyed their meal as well, and we were left satisfied and ready for the long day ahead. Our waiter was friendly, and stopped to chat with us a bit as we paid the check. Although slower than usual, the place does prep some pretty good meals. If you have the time to wait for good food, give this place a try.",16,11,22
18,Rebecca C.,"San Francisco, CA",666,791,1951,4.0,3/9/2018,"Love this spot. Came here twice when I was staying at the Marriott marquis around the corner. I used to go to Friedman's near ChinaTown and this place reminds me of it. (Different ambience but still Great food.)Open classy area. Super fast and friendly service. Tomato soup is solid. The bowl portion is huge (enough for the family).  Cup portion is more than enough. I really like the avocado toast. Poached egg tops the avocado toast. Perfect texture so it doesn't becomes runny completely and still stands atop the toast. These little details are pretty spectacular here. Recommend a bit more salt on this to your liking and a squeeze of lemon. Also a cold remedy that completely saved me on this trip. Get a ginger shot (ginger, lemon and honey) and put inside a cup of hot water. The best thing for a cold. Ask for extra hot water to make it hot...",3,2,3
19,Rosanna W.,"Rockville, MD",113,268,907,3.0,7/25/2018,"Not very impressed with this place. It is in the hotel and you walk in and it's right there. We went in and got seated right away. I ordered the avocado sandwich and the chick sausage on the side.There was nothing impressive about the avocado toast and the chicken sausage was so dry and didn't have a good taste to it. The cost of the avocado toast was not worth it. My friend got the granola bowl which actually was flavorful and filling for one person.  The blueberry pancake was pretty good, fluffy and warm to bite into it. I think I only enjoyed the pancake. It took forever to get the waitresses attention after we got our food.",,,
20,Jonathan C.,"Jersey City, NJ",30,8,5,5.0,10/22/2018,"This was one of the best breakfast/brunch places I have had a chance to eat at. It's no secret that this place is expensive but you get what you pay for. My experience The bacon was cooked perfectly leaving a very juicy and tender taste. The scrambled eggs looked fake because of how perfectly they were cooked. The chai tea was just the perfect amount of chai and not too sweet. My main course I ordered the pastrami brunch meal (I don't recall the exact name) and everything about that meal tasted great. If you are looking for a great meal and have a little money to spend, I deff recommend this place. Best size would be for 2 or less. It was pretty packed when I was there and it took me 5 minutes to get seated but if you had a larger party you were looking at about a 15 to 20 minute wait.",,,
21,Tamira G.,"Brooklyn, NY",22,96,146,5.0,7/19/2018,"I definitely enjoyed my dinner here. I've always wanted to try dinner at Friedmans since I had heard good things about it. I came here last Thursday evening and it was pretty empty. The decor was very classic. Our waiter was pretty attentive. I ordered the daily special which was the ribs with shoestring fries and my friend ordered a salmon. She enjoyed her salmon alot and the rib were great; the meat fell of the bone and the meal was really filling. We enjoyed our meal that we actually ended going to another location this past Tuesday, haha.",,,
22,K K.,"Philadelphia, PA",8,44,56,4.0,6/27/2018,"Friedman's breakfast was everything I needed and more before getting on the train back to Philly. The chilaquiles was amazing mostly because the salsa verde (also the chicken was juicy!). I'm from Arizona and I thought the salsa verde at Friedman's definitely held its own compared to an authentic one. The portion was also enormous, plenty to share and I was starving! This is good because the prices are a bit high (about $20 for each). The chai latte was amazing and I loved that they had the dirty chai on the menu. The service was great aside from the fact that I called before hand and asked if there was a wait and was told no. We walked over not even 10 minutes later and then had to wait for a table. The hostess felt bad and apologized but it was annoying since we had a train to catch which is why I called initially. However, the service thereafter was spot on, everything came out super fast even though it was packed. The waiter was so nice and made good convo and also ensured we got out of there with plenty of time to spare. I would come back again and I would without a doubt order the chilaquiles.",2,,
23,Ariel A.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",208,17,6,5.0,11/9/2018,"Superb breakfast. Had the egg white omelette, with greens.  It had asparagus and red peppers.  Servicenis great, in and out in 20.  Highly recommended.",,,
24,Shari C.,"Manhattan, NY",14,66,205,4.0,2/23/2018,"This is a great spot to grab brunch, especially if you plan on seeing a matinee Broadway show.We came without reservations on a Sunday. We actually called ahead a few days before; however, we were informed that they only take reservations for large parties. The wait overall wasn't too bad.Friedman's offers a diverse selection on their menu, from salads, sandwiches, burgers and many appetizing brunch dishes--french toast, waffles, omelettes! We opted for the Pastrami Hash and the Chicken Chilaquiles at the suggestion of our waitress. I highly recommend trying either dish!Our food was delicious, flavorful and fresh. The service was excellent as well. IMO, some of the dishes are a tad pricey for brunch, but this place is worth a try if you're in the area.",,,1
25,Max C.,"North Andover, MA",2,11,0,5.0,11/10/2018,"I came here with some friends on Veterans Day Weekend. They were slightly busy so we had to wait for 20 min. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. We ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Wings for an appetizer which were absolutely delicious though very sticky. Then for our main meal we got the Meat Loaf Mash, 2 Strip Steaks and a lone hamburger patty (don't ask he is VERY picky). They were all very good and filling. Overall a good eat and good service. Would come here again when in NYC.",,,
26,Alexander E.,"San Diego, CA",2,28,15,5.0,9/23/2018,Pastrami Hash with a side of Bacon is the Perfect hangover food right now. Oh! And a cup of Chicken Matzo Ball soup. So delicious! I have the urge to destroy my liver again tonight just so I can eat this again and have the same experience.,,,
27,Caroline N.,"Queens, NY",37,235,1745,4.0,1/21/2018,"Convenient restaurant if you are checking out any nearby theaters.  If you don't mind sitting by the windows, it allowed us to be seated faster than wait 15 minutes for a seat inside the restaurant.The waitress was quick to take our orders since we had a limited amount of time.  The orders came quickly and were still hot.  Chicken Matzo Ball Soup: use to the soup coloring being more yellow than brown so it could be me.  The soup was a bit salty with the matzo balls which were small.  This was our least favorite dish.Appetizer: Avocado Mash with tostones and pickled pepper.  The avocado mash was awesome!  I highly recommend it.  The tostones on the top were perfect especially with the mash spread.  Though forewarning: the tostones on the bottom of the plate were a bit greasy on one side with the oil soaking in it.Friend Chicken and Cheddar Waffles: was fantastic.  Try for yourself!Sides: Market Plate - we picked 3 vegetables: sauteed spinach (not enough but there was a lot of brussel sprouts so it made for up for the portions), brussel sprouts and charred broccoli rabe (had a kick but if you can't really eat spicy...it isn't too bad.  Though I am used to the rabe having a crunch while chewing, this was soft so believe it was overcooked but not mushy).  Otherwise, the vegetables we're pretty good especially the brussel sprouts.There wasn't enough space on the table.  At one point, I put the water bottle on the window sill and the busboy must have picked it up while cleaning another table.  They are quick!  At other times, it took a long time to obtain an extra utensil.  Overall it was a great experience!",,,1
28,Rai R.,"Ashburn, VA",17,245,92,4.0,9/9/2018,Huge inside so don't go by the outside and while it has a decent menu it's not a cheap breakfast. Oatmeal orange juice and an omelette $52 without tip. Offers free WiFi. Good service .,1,,

For dessert you will need to see the Photos. Staff was very attentive and friendly. They made great suggestions. Decor was modern with a trendy ambience. How can you not eat in this place? Where Thomas Edison Turn on the lights for this building.  Must see and eat if your in the area.",,,
30,Eric B.,"Boston, MA",199,16,0,4.0,11/3/2018,"Great spot for brunch in midtown. Attentive and accommodating service. Creative dinner menu. While I will miss the old Broadway charm of the Edison Cafe, I'm glad this historic space as a tenet like Friedman's. Love the Benny Nova - a fantastic twist on Egg's Benedict; also appreciative they offer a single pancake on the side - great to split with a dining companion when you need just a bit of sweetness to go with your brunch.",,,
31,Nancy T.,"Wilmington, DE",58,145,1232,3.0,6/15/2018,"Before ending out short little vacay we decided to have breakfast here. I ordered the avocado toast which was 2 pcs of toasted baguette with mushed avocado poached eggs and flaxseed. It was served with some micro greens and a charred lemon.  Wasn't bad, I think it was perfect for a lite breakfast. My fiancé ordered the Acai smoothie which was mediocre but his pastrami hash was good. A bit salty but that's fine, we had plenty of water to wash it down. His dish came with choice of toast and eggs. Simple breakfast, service was nice, food came out quick. Price wasn't ridiculous for NYC, and inside was clean and welcoming. We would return if around the area!",,,1
32,Kathie Z.,"Fremont, CA",417,18,12,4.0,7/20/2018,"Friedman's is great place if you want to have a solid brunch experience. They're really reliable, and always producing great food. We got the avocado toast, side of pancakes, and two eggs any ways. The pancakes were definitely the star of the brunch. They were light and fluffy, but not to the point where they were falling apart on your fork. I took off one star because while it's a great place, you can get this type of brunch food at about any brunch place in New York, and theres nothing particularly special about it. The prices are a little high too because it has a good reputation and is a chain.If the main Friedman's is super busy, I recommend some of the smaller branches! They serve the same food and usually the wait isn't as long.",,,

Staff were professional and helpful. The waiter reminded me of 'Erik' from 'True Blood' but he was very helpful and wonderful with providing service to us. The food was great and worked well for my kiddos (at that time 11, 4, & 1). My husband had his first experience with chicken and waffles, which he enjoyed very much.Pro: The food is very tasty. Service is great.Con: It can get busy and wait time can be a challenge, but it is worth the wait.Overall Experience: Create memories with loved ones while you're there.",,,

35,Brad G.,"Summit, NJ",0,24,0,2.0,8/31/2018,"I like Friedmans generally but they are getting kind of jerky with prices. The Happy Hour had many things at the same price as the regular menu. A rip off. The other locations actually have decent happy hours Had a Moscow Mule at the happy hour price of $10 (happy for them) but it was undrinkable as ginger beer was off or just terrible. I told the bar tender and she told me ginger beer has different flavors in a very bitchy way in a very high voice. She never even tried it to see what crap she is serving. Skip this place and go next door to the Rum House. They actually make the best Dark n Stormy, I have ever had. Or Friedmans for Snark and stormy - rip off on happy hour and gruesome drinks made by crap bartenders. Shame as you can and have done better!!",,,

No it's no second ave deli, but if you're visiting nyc and want to keep the brunch crowd happy while still getting your meat sammy time on - friedman's is the place for you.You can order coffee (free refills on drip) and if you're so inclined you can also order full food service at the bar area as well.The bathroom for this location is actually in the main hotel lobby which was a bit of a walk, but at least they provide a bathroom!",2,1,2

This restaurant was open, not very busy, and I hoped to have some good NY deli food for my last night in NYC. The host offered me seating in the front area by the windows or in a large area behind the bar. Since the back area seemed cavernous, I choose the window seating. Then I waited and waited for a server. I tried to catch the eye of a waiter two tables up to no avail. Evidently the host didn't consider taking control of the situation, although I don't know what he was doing. Then came my server came around the corner from the far end of the restaurant. In a foot cast. Seriously?  I'm no restaurateur, but why would you subject an injured server to walking the furthest?The pastrami Reuben was okay, but not spectacular. And for $20 to getpotato chips? This place resembled a Denny's, not a landmark NY deli . The follow-up service by my server was non-existent. Then towards the end, the waiter who ignored me earlier, suddenly decided to overwhelm me with unnecessary attention.  Too little, too late.  I won't be back.",1,4,

45,Chilly P.,"Boston, MA",46,226,215,3.0,1/11/2018,This place gets crazy busy during the holidays. The employees are accommodating and friendly among the madness. I came with a large party with reservations for brunch. We were seated fairly quickly when we arrived and it didn't take long for food to come out. I got the chicken and waffles for $25 which was a bit overpriced. The cheddar in the waffles was a bit much for me - I would of preferred a regular one. My latte was good but needed to be hotter. I did enjoy the overall service and atmosphere.,1,1,1

It really has helped but it is challenging to eat out. For my trip to NYC I diligently searched for gluten free restaurants in and Friedmans was on every list. The menu was so impressive I had to ask twice if the entire menu was truly gluten free. With sandwiches and dishes that come with toast, you are given a choice between gluten free bread or traditional bread. I had the waffle with berries. It was amazing! My husband commented that he'd never seen me eat an entire dish when at a restaurant. I was full about halfway but it was so good that I just couldn't leave any of it! Even my husband (who doesn't do gluten free) commented on how good his pastrami Ruben was. Everything was well prepared, delicious, fresh, well presented, and the service was superb. The ambiance is lovely too! I will keep Friedmans on my must NYC list every time I visit (every year).",,,

With the big chain restaurants and fast food places this was a wonderful change of pace in the area. Food tasted outstanding and the service was friendly. Not one thing didn't taste good and we had a lot of food. The highlights were: the ribs were fall off the bone and so tender. Chicken and waffle were a huge portion and the chicken was so crispy!

She was friendly, attentive without being intrusive, and she knew the menu well.The atmosphere was very nice. Upbeat music playing at a low enough volume that it is truly just background. High ceilings, plenty of room between tables, really interesting architecture (take a look at the ceiling!).The food was just excellent. I ordered pastrami on rye, and it was fresh, moist and tender, and the mustard had a nice kick to it, too! The serving was generous without being overstuffed like Carnegie used to be. You'll be able to finish it in one sitting, which you'll want to do because it's so delicious. I started with a cup of matzoh ball soup, which was fresh and hearty, with a fluffy, good sized matzoh ball and pieces of white meat chicken, too. Glad I only ordered a cup, as it was a very generous portion, and a bowl would've been too much with the sandwich.I did save space for dessert, and I'm glad I did! I asked which of the several pies she would recommend, and she suggested the cherry pie with vanilla ice cream. This was a great suggestion, and I in turn can recommend it to you!Side note: flat or sparkling water is free, and they keep a full bottle on your table. Nice touch for someone like me who drinks a lot of water and prefers not to have to wait for refills. Another plus!",1,1,1

I was surprised that there was a nice brunch place that isn't a chain right at Times Square, but here it is :) We came in with no reservations on Saturday around 11ish, but were able to get seated within 5 minutes for a party of five. Their chai lattes and cappuccinos are wonderful! I don't usually like chai lattes, but theirs were really creamy and not too strong. I ordered blueberry pancakes and shared food with my friends. Highlights - their rosemary fries and pastrami hash! The fries were so good and perfectly crispy. My blueberry pancakes were severely lacking in flavor. I'm not sure if this is different type of pancake, but it was very bland, even with the tart blueberries and syrup on top. I really could not finish it or even have another bite. Overall, I would come here again since it had great atmosphere and seating was comfortable. Service was great as well!",5,1,8

We were there for brunch and the 10 of us  all of our dishes! The gluten-free pastries were delicious! The gluten-free pancakes and french toast were divine!

These are the best GF pancakes and waffles I have ever had, and I have tried many! The roasted beet appetizer with horseradish mustard was a creative and welcome spin on an already yummy dish. My husband said the lox bagel is as good as the ones his Jewish grandmother gave to him as a kid and also that the potato pancakes are the most authentic he has found anywhere (they come with both an apple sauce and a sour cream). Mimosas were nicely balanced, but ginger shots vary greatly (one time spicy, another time very mild). Came here for dinner only once, as it was just okay. Too much mayo on the fish tacos, and the vinegar chips that came with my husband's veggie sandwich just tasted plain and were kinda stale. Sandwich itself was also okay but nothing special. Might give it another shot sometime just since brunch is so great. Service is quick and friendly. They serve free water that tastes and smells good.

They reassure you there's no cross contamination in the kitchen. They have deep friers reserved for gluten-free items so yes, you can eat anything your heart desires without any worry! And they don't eliminate bread items, they have their own gluten free bread items. Hallelujah! I was informed that the owner has celiac disease creating a conscious environment.  Celiacs know the terror of wondering if the kitchen staff remembered to make their plate gluten-free... no worries here, they put a cute little toothpick flag in the food to keep everyone informed including you! Yay! I just ate the falafel burger and fries. Only $16 (and I'm essentially on Times Square!) It was spicier than I imagined but delicious and well plated! I can't stand hovering wait staff and here they won't bother you unless you make eye contact. I will be back for sure! The table next to me got gluten free chicken and waffles! Omg!

I walked in and told the hostess that a table by the window was not necessary and I would sit anywhere. I followed her only to realize that the restaurant extended all the way back. It was gigantic. I was seated, given a menu and asked about a drink. I got a cup of coffee which came quickly. I looked at the menu and decided to order the grain bowl which came with the choice of brown rice or quinoa [I got the quinoa], bok choy, Japanese eggplant, carrots, bean sprouts, edamame, with a sesame line vinaigrette. There was also a choice of tofu-$3, chicken or steak-$5, or salmon-$7. I got the salmon. I didn't anticipate for this to come out hot but it did and it was delicious.

We were sat near the front bar by the exit door (where the fire alarm is) and there are ants..lots of ants. 2.  Service is HORRIBLE! Unbelievably slow (& it's not currently busy).3.  They don't have basics like chocolate milk or brown sugar.  4. Requested regular white bread toast and the poor waitress doesn't know what that is. She said sour dough was the whitest bread they have rather than saying we don't have white bread. What the heck! 5.  The chicken sausage has to be one of the worst things I've ever tasted in my life. It was literally ground chicken with minimal sage that was just seared until it was dry as cardboard.  It was so bad I sent it back & had it removed for my bill.6.  The French toast was flavorless. As if I was just eating toast with awful compote slathered on top.  I can tell it wasn't soaking in the custard long (or even at all).,,,

The food was really good too! Classic brunch staples with substantial portions. I ordered the pastrami hash ($17), which included two sunny side up eggs on a pastrami hash with whole wheat bread. I thought that the pastrami hash might be too salty, but it actually wasn't at all! I think that it could have done with a greater proportion of potatoes, but there was a nice tang to it that kept the dish from being too heavy and made me come back for another bite after bite. Definitely filling--I still had some left in my dish by the time I was full. Also, apparently this place is a really good option if you're gluten free, which I thankfully don't have to worry about. I thought brunch was on the pricier side but maybe that's because I'm used to Chicago prices, not NYC ones. Overall, pretty satisfied with my meal!",,,
97,Karen H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,7,8,5.0,3/1/2018,"So glad we found this bright and yummy cafe in midtown on our last morning in town!  Food was delicious and our server, Jesse, was so personable to chat with and attentive.  Our espresso came with a , leaving us with the best taste of NYC in our hearts!",,,
98,Kisha N.,"Grapevine, TX",4,6,3,5.0,1/28/2018,Really loved the food at Friedman's! They were open early which was great. The portions were large and the taste was excellent. I ordered the French toast and chicken sausage and my friend had the avocado toast and granola. We enjoyed the lattes and felt the environment was nice and inviting. Would definitely recommend this place!,,,

Friendly and efficient waitresses and waiters- a bit of a wait whichever way you come in, but they are pleasant and you don't mind. Coffee is strong and GOOD. Creative breakfast selection available but my standard 2 egg 1 pancake was delicious! Family enjoyed as well. No negatives. Hubby had BELT- yumo!!!",,,

However, I do not think that the steak + eggs is worth the money as a comparison to the other dishes. On the other hand, definitely get the pastrami hash! IT IS SOO FLAVORFUL! The grilled chicken swisswich is also very good! It is juicy and the bread is amazing. I did not think that the food would be very fulfilling as it did not look as big. However, after eating half the dish, I was definitely satisfied. I live in LA and currently craving the the pastrami hash... lol ):",,,

109,Lisa L.,"Atlanta, GA",0,20,15,5.0,12/23/2017,"This restaurant exceeded all of my expectations. We were looking for brunch near Times Square that wasn't a chain, a diner or fast food. Yelp listed Friedman's as the number 1 restaurant near our hotel. We had a party of 5. We walked in the door and the easy sound of live music. The decor was classic and the food was excellent. We ordered, Steak and Eggs, Chicken and Waffles (awesome ""hot"" honey) Chicken Chiciquiles- so many good flavors in that dish, and the French Toast. Everyone enjoyed their food. We saw the Blueberry Pancakes go by and wish we had ordered them just to try them. Our server was very attentive, and didn't rush us into ordering even though it was our first time and we had a difficult time making decisions. Love this place and would definitely eat here again and send my friends.",,,
110,Chrissy S.,"Peoria, IL",34,5,8,4.0,3/12/2018,I ate here twice during my trip with a friend who had a gluten allergy.  She was thrilled to have so many options.  I had the The Friedman's club for lunch and the chicken and waffle for dinner.  It was all good.,,,

112,Jason R.,"Lake Mary, FL",0,12,0,2.0,6/5/2018,"The food wasn't very good. IHOP food has a better taste. Their pancakes and waffles taste funky. The bacon was burned and the kitchen has a belief that they are a 5 star restaurant so if you ask to change an item on the menu they just tell you no. Lastly, the manager Katarina brought over our food that was burned initially and didn't ask us any questions.She plopped it down on the table and walked away.She even treated her wait staff like they were her servants. She made them walk across the restaurant to listen to her command. Ridiculous!",,,
113,Jennifer G.,"Philadelphia, PA",184,11,1,5.0,7/31/2018,"The chicken and waffles is incredible! Came here before a show on a busy Sunday and we were seated at the bar fairly quickly. Apparently our bartender thought she took too long to take our orders (we definitely were waiting for a bit but it was packed so it was completely understandable) as she comped us our first round of mimosas which was a really pleasant surprise! I came here with my boyfriend who has celiac as other reviews said there were a lot of gluten free options- he was expecting the usual egg/ omelette breakfast options but he was very happy that they could pretty much make almost dish gluten free and he was really excited to actually be able to get waffles. A lot of places even if they have those options are hit or miss but he said they tasted great! And if you are not gluten free I 100% recommend the chicken and waffles. It is extremely filling but is so incredible. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the cheddar in the waffle was a nice addition but the star of the show was the kick in the habanero maple syrup. Just enough spice/kick to take it to the next level but not too much that it was over powering. Overall it was fantastic food and service!",1,,

Such a upbeat waitstaff!! Kudos to you guys! Will be bringing our Nana here when she visits for thanksgiving weekend!! Ooh wait y'all wanted to know about the food?

The waiters and waitresses were really nice and we had no problem with anything. Food was incredible, one of the best waffles I've ever had. My mom got the eggs with style but instead of sausage she chose bacon. She said it was really good especially the hash browns (She's very picky so when she says it's good, it's good - trust me.) 100% recommend going here for breakfast/brunch",,,

132,Allan C.,"Manassas, VA",57,15,0,1.0,7/8/2018,"As per my usual visit to NYC i always have to stop here. Its one of my all time favorite places to go for brunch. I usually go to the other location as its less busy but i was staying a block from this one so we went there. Waiting time was only 10 minutes for a party of 4 which is actually really good for a popular nyc restaurant. Once we got seated was when it all went down. Maybe its because we were all young gave the waitress the impression that we dont tip well or something??? But service was terrible. I noticed that she would pour the water on the cups for all the other people sitting around us so i expected the same but no, we had to do it ourselves. After we got our food it was all delicious but we needed more water. The waitress never came back to check on us, and when she finally did come it was to bring the check. I know this is my fault for forgetting to tell her it was all split. But after i asked her if there was a way to split it in 4 she gave me a really nasty attitude and told me that splitting it would take her about 20 minutes and she didnt have the time. She walked away and came back with a pen and told us to figure it out. The food at this place is amazing so i do recommend it. But if you go i hope you dont get the red haired lady cause she just doesnt know basic customer service.",1,,

I absolutely recommend trying this place or going back if you've already been.*there was a patron with a service dog at the bar, the staff repeatedly came over to ask if the dog needed water or a snack.

They forgot half of my order one day so I called them asking where it was. They just...forgot it? It was on the Seamless ticket but somehow they just didn't make it. I'm literally one minute away from them and it took over half an hour to get my food to me and it was cold. I have no idea what's going on over there but they haven't gotten their shit together yet.

I asked if I could get a table inside, or if any table are leaving soon, as it is very cold for my old folks to sit by the door, with the occasional blast of wind when the door open, without checking, he said #2 ""no, you have to wait 15 to 20 mins"". I asked where is the restroom, he gave a #3 sloppy instruction and I brought my old folks to the restroom which is the shared restroom with Hotel Edison. #4 When I came back, he gave away the table by the door, and I asked ""you gave away the table?"" He said ""Cos you left"" in the most rude and condescending manner. I asked for his manager. He said #6 I will ask for my manager and you can stop screaming. The manager gave me a table at the back of the room and offered free pancakes (separate note, water and coffee came after the pancakes were finished, then the order is taken - imagine the pace) It is really a nice gesture and for the sake of my old folks who would like to sit down and rest, I caved, otherwise I would have left. It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I will never step into this restaurant again, nor recommend to anyone else. The 1 star was for the manager who try to fuse the situation. The extremely rude host should have apologized for being rude and if i am the owner of the restuarant, I would never tolerate such staff. The waitress at my table is nice and I gave her 18++% tip.

163,Sophia V.,"San Diego, CA",45,28,26,5.0,12/18/2017,"I'm used to the Farm to Table restaurants in Cali but this was a first for us in New York. The service was great, such nice servers! I had the steak and eggs which had a jalapeno cream sauce that was light and so tasty. We sat by the window so had a little people watching but the rest of their restaurant looked lovely as well. This is one place that I wish we had visited a second time on our trip for breakfast!",,,
164,Sdot W.,"Abingdon, MD",5,13,19,4.0,2/6/2018,The food was good. My server Sophia was kind of rude and impatient. However another guy and I don't know his name (sorry) was very kind and fixed the mistakes that she made. It was very spacious inside and the decor was nice!,,,
165,Shay D.,"Columbia, SC",0,4,5,5.0,3/4/2018,So this has def been my favorite Brunch spot in the city so far! I found this place on yelp and saw that it was located near my hotel in Rockefeller plaza.  I thought why not I'd love to ty it out and I did not regret it! The place is very beautiful and elegant but also has a laid back atmosphere that I love.  There was a bit or a wait but I was able to be seated at the bar immediately.  My server Jess was excellent! She was so nice and helpful and the mimosa was awesome!  I had the chicken and waffles with a side of Mac and cheese and all I can say is wow!! Everyone was so friendly from the guy who offered me napkins to the server who helped me with my sauce choice! This will be on my to do list for years to come! Thanks for an awesome experience!,,,

Enjoyed everything from the ambiance, amazing service, and comfortable booth as well!We will long remember the yummy gf Belgium waffle with berries and the huge dollop of fresh whipped cream on top ! The gf potato pancakes were delicious with fresh chopped apple sauce! The gf grain bowl was great too! The organic coffee was also so good! ( they even have almond milk to add to the coffee! ) Anyone who has gluten issues would totally appreciate this Gourmet and healthy restaurant menu! We will return one day!",,,
168,Kelli R.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",4,15,0,3.0,12/17/2017,"Let me start by saying, Friedman's was exactly what we needed on a cold day in midtown with out of towners (+kids). What's important is that we had a good meal, where we didn't feel rushed and the kids could be kids. Overall, great option for midtown dining. The menu was a good mix of healthy food, comfort food, and all day breakfast.The wait for a table for 6 at 1:30pm was reasonable. Our first server forgot some of our drink orders. Our second server (there must have been a shift change) was very welcoming and explained the kitchen was backed up when we checked in on our food. Our meals were tasty but not as hot as we would have liked.",,,
169,Caitlin G.,"City Center, Miami Beach, FL",135,21,0,4.0,2/10/2018,"It is fun to come here for drinks. The interior looks classy, so I came in looking for good wine, but I didn't find any. Still glad I came.",,,
170,Steven P.,"Grayson, GA",0,12,17,4.0,2/9/2018,Today me and my girlfriend landed in New York looking for a good breakfast and brunch location and this spot didn't disappoint. I had a steak and eggs which was really good and tender with the yuca which I love came with some sort of like jalapeño sauce. My girlfriend had the eggs with style which she found great and her favorite was the bacon was thick cut and really crispy. Price was a little high the steak was 21 and her eggs 15.,,,

Great food, great atmosphere And AMAZING service! Our waiter Zero was friendly and attentive, which is hard to find in NYC! The Mac and cheese, turkey burger and fish tacos are to die for! If you are looking for great food and good people in the Time Square/Theatre District, this is the place to go! I wish we hadn't found it on our last night because we probably would have tried it for breakfast, lunch and dinner!",,,
173,Vinay K.,"Marlborough, MA",0,4,0,2.0,12/24/2017,"Good ambience but poor service. Be prepared to wait for  Sunday morning brunch. When asked to check, got an extremely aggressive answer that we are busy. Doesn't sound convincing when tables get seated after u and leave",,,
174,Elizabeth H.,"Worcester, MA",54,19,0,5.0,12/19/2017,Busy place at breakfast time but worth it. Especially good for those who have to avoid gluten. Everything on the menu can be made gluten free. Service was great. They had us in and out even though they were busy. Gluten free waffle (can't remember be last time I was able to have a waffle) was great!,,,

Manager was good, apologizing because one of the party's order did not get put in. He gave a $15 credit, but this is by far the worst food experiences in NYC on this trip. And $50 for two orders of eggs and bacon was ridiculous! Never again!",,,
177,Lynn L.,"Tujunga, CA",0,17,0,5.0,6/13/2018,"The food here was amazing!  I love the happy hour menu- great options if you are vegetarian.  The vegetarian potstickers were great, as well as the crispy artichokes with aoli dipping sauce.  Good wine selection.  Wonderful staff- beautiful architecture and interior design makes this place some kind of wonderful.",,,

181,Ashley F.,"Fort Worth, TX",118,3,0,5.0,12/9/2017,"We were in NYC for 5 days, and on our last day we stopped here. Should've made this our first stop. Our server Zero was FANTASTIC! (We ate out a lot during those 5 days and the service was all horrible to mediocre at best) He was all around great. Highly recommend Zero and this place for brunch :)",,,
182,Scott B.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,1,0,5.0,4/6/2018,Really cool place! Love the building and the energy. Had the Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich which was terrific. The spicy honey they serve with it makes the sandwich.,,,
183,Sarah L.,"Philadelphia, PA",230,8,1,5.0,4/1/2018,Great atmosphere. Great service. Delicious food. My boyfriend and I had lunch here today before we had to catch our bus back to Philadelphia. They held our suitcases for us in a room while we ate which was great. Highly recommend this place!,,,
184,Luis R.,"Miami, FL",1,57,1,5.0,3/30/2018,"Be ready to wait since the location is very close to Times Square but our wait was about 20 minutes which is not as bad as we expected.  We had the pastrami hash, waffle, steak and eggs and French toasts.  All four dishes were great.  My favorite was the pastrami hash.  Place has a grand hall decor, music and a buzzing atmosphere.  Host and waitress were very friendly.",,,

Big place so I hope next time I go I will be able to get in without a wait, I am not good at planning ahead. One note, not sure why it says bkfst and brunch, I went for dinner and drinks!",,,
186,Taylor A.,"Old Bridge, NJ",0,49,3,3.0,4/18/2018,"Visited today while touring the city and I have to say I was very pleased with the prompt service but overall could have had a better experience. The water that was brought to the table was in a glass bottle and was warm. Water didn't contain ice or lemon like other places. My boyfriend and I ordered the egg white omelette which contained mixed veggies I guess it is a different variety of veggies each day because our waiter informed us today it is asparagus and tomatoes. The plate presentation was nice, sliced avocado on top of the egg white. It also came with french fries? Why not home fries or some type of potato pancake it is breakfast food..I don't think the taste of the food was extraordinary for the price $16...maybe 2 eggs on my plate. I see other photos posted on here and think maybe I could have just ordered the wrong thing. Would give it a try again if I had the opportunity, I really liked the environment but I reside in NJ!",,,
187,Allen L.,"Sudbury, MA",0,39,0,4.0,3/4/2018,"Solid breakfast. Delicious and great service.  Located adjoined to the Edison Hotel. Large restaurant, plenty of seating so we were situated quickly. There is seating by the window, at the service bar and a dining room to the rear.  We were seating in the dining room.

189,Amy D.,"Washington, DC",0,7,0,1.0,4/29/2018,"DO NOT GO HERE. Here are a list of better brunch spots in HK: 44&X, Eden Local, Rustic Table, Print, Bea. After adding my name to the list and waiting 35+ minutes, I watched the incompetent hostess seat multiple larger groups, the hostess then informed me and my guest that we'd need to wait another 15 minutes or so or that we could eat at the bar with a stool right next to the front door. This is the second time I've been asked to wait for 30+ min to get seated. Not sure if the food is good because it was impossible to get a seat both times. How is the hosting staff so incompetent?",,,
190,Jenna T.,"New York, NY",83,45,22,2.0,1/5/2018,"The only reason I gave 2 starts rather than 1 is the food. The food was good, not great. I called ahead to ask about the wait time for two and they said about 15-20 minutes. It was definitely closer to 20-25 minutes. We ended up being seated right next to the door so it was miserable. It was so cold we could barely enjoy our meals. On top of that when we sat down it was at least 15 minutes before we even saw someone come near our table. She breezed by us saying I'll be right with you, then disappeared again for at least another 5 minutes. She finally brought us some water and took our drink orders which took another several minutes to get to our table. The food came quickly enough but our waitress was so in-personable. Then she brought our check 15 minutes after we got our food making us feel like she was trying to get rid of us. On top of that, I had to ask 3 different people for directions to the restroom because it is located in the hotel lobby. Then they had this woman singing jazz which did not fit with the mood of the restaurant, it was very loud, and honestly just distracting. She sang well enough, but it hampered my experience. Overall, because of the location and because the food was not amazing, I will not be going back. If the service had been better and we had not been seated next to the door in 10 degree weather I probably would have had a better experience and been tempted to go back.",,,
191,Priscilla A.,"Montebello, CA",125,7,0,4.0,3/2/2018,Great customer service! Exceptional chicken chilaquiles... A must have! Our waiter James was very friendly and have is wonderful service. Definitely will come back if we're ever in NY again!,,,

193,Irina S.,"Manhattan, NY",15,9,0,3.0,12/25/2017,"I've been to Friedman's at their other locations; this was my first visit to this particular location.  While the staff attempts to service the diners with their best intentions, they are not knowledgeable about the menu and there is a disconnect between the manager and wait staff.  When we asked what vegetables came with the egg white omelette, we were told it was butternut squash, zucchini, and spinach.  The omelette came with lots of cheese (which we didn't ask for and wasn't described on the menu) and no vegetables! We called the waitress and she went to the kitchen to check what vegetables they actually had; came back and voila they only have asparagus. Really, so we now downsized market vegetables to only asparagus. Manager came over and said actually we have zucchini, spinach, and asparagus and I'll have the omelette remade with those and NO cheese. Some time passes and they bring back the omelette with some limp asparagus, plenty of cheese, and no zucchini or spinach! Really, come on now.. They did take the item off our bill but at this level of incompetence which was good and at the same time I will not ever be going there again.  Also,  grilled cheese is actually french baguette style with very little cheese so it's actually french grilled baguette with tidbit of cheese.. I suggest to avoid this location  unless you want to see what Incompetence at its best.",,,

My mom recommended we try Freidman's, what a name right. It looked classy, organized neat and clean. It was spacious it would be good for a party. The restroom was in the hotel, it was clean and well lit. Our waitress was very nice, the service was very good, we thought she was friendly, no complaints. We had an assortment of foods kids like: The Mac and cheese was not only tasty but cheesy. The fries had a good seasoning that was unique. We even tasted the cheese on the burger. Yes, we left room for dessert; we had the peach pie, nice and sweet. We had their.... The marshmallows were toasted. The vanilla ice cream was served with raspberries, yum!",,,

She ordered a side of ""thick cut"" bacon for $7 and received a few slivers of paper thin, crumbled matter. Coffee was rancid and lukewarm. My chilaquiles were edible but definitely didn't sit well. Cost for breakfast for 2 was $65 before tip. There are far better places to be patronized in the area. Get ramen for breakfast instead.",,,
