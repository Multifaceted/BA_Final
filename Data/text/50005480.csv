Good flavor, and real friendly wait staff(surprisingly) Sometimes with places that are ""old school""they have cranky people. Also got the crabcakes, the picture is eh but it was good too! Not a lot of filler, a lot of crab.  Decent beer selection but I would order the burger again. It's a cool spot and the steak to the table next to us looked good. Thanks Hudson Malone! Bobby the server was great",,,1

Updated review","I came here a few times a while back. Start off by saying they have great music! Old fashion style decor and perfect bluesy tunes to go with it! Very nice atmosphere especially at night with the cozy lighting. The bartenders/ servers are serious about their whiskey and even more serious about the delicious food! Definitely more upscale than I expected so I was pleasantly surprised by the creative choices. Although, we did get a chatty server one time - it was getting a little awkward for me (I'm pretty sure she was flirting with my date at the time....)  Bathroom was upstairs and could use a little sprucing.Overall a pleasant spot.",2,,
2,Kristi B.,"Winter Garden, FL",38,93,215,4.0,9/11/2018,"After running around the city all day, we realized that we hadn't grabbed dinner and were starving. As it was close to 11pm, we had limited options in the midtown Manhattan area. We searched on Yelp and came across Hudson Malone's. The joint is a mix between a speakeasy and grandma's home. There is eclectic collection of items all along the walls. I ordered the lamb sliders cooked medium and they were delicious. The fries were perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and tender inside. My boyfriend ordered the roast beef sandwich. He said the bread on the sandwich was perfectly toasted and paired really well with the roast beef. I ordered the Sinatra smash as my beverage. It wasn't quite to my liking but overall was an enjoyable drink. My boyfriend ordered a rum and coke. The rum selections were limited but we found this was the case in most places with in the city. When he ordered a second one he asked if they had Cruzan rum and the server told us they did. I watched the bar tender make his drink and he made it with Myers instead. We immediately called him out on it and was told he didn't have Cruzan. Perhaps there was a miss communication Between the server and the bartender. But the bartender did come over and let my boyfriend sample a different rum that he had which is what he ended up going with.",2,,1

Updated review",Several years in the game and still knocking it out of the park.  Still the epitome of a classic NYC bar experience. Well stocked bar to get cocktails going while you decide whether to start with the chillerTiger prawn cocktail or dive right into the dry aged 3rd Ave El burger.,2,,3
4,Barbara B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/20/2018,"My family came to this restaurant last weekend after a show.  We were seated right away & our drink orders were taken & brought to the table quickly.  We ordered appetizers & entrees.The waiter brought my grandson's burger (even though he ordered an appetizer) & my son-in- law's French fries (which were part of his entree order).  I asked why were these items brought out before the appetizers.  The waiter said the kitchen had them ready. I told him only to bring the appetizers out & wait until we were done to bring out the entrees. He brought the appetizers & then not 2 minutes later, out came the entrees. I was furious. This is not a fast food restaurant, nor is it inexpensive.  Any decent restaurant knows that appetizers are brought to the table first, and when finished, the entrees come out.  This is not some new concept. This is ""Hospitality 101"". My son-in-law, who ordered a steak for 2 at a price of $63, to share with his son, had asked for it medium-well.  It was served to him very rare.  He ate it (not really liking it that way), but my grandson could not eat his portion like that. My daughter asked to have the steak cooked some more. When it returned, the steak was very hard.  It must had been microwaved.  My daughter ordered a salad with dressing on the side, but the salad was brought with the dressing on it.  It was not an enjoyable meal.We were barely done with our food & the table was being cleaned.  I could understand if the restaurant was busy, and a table was needed, but there were only 2 other people at another table in the restaurant.  There was no need to rush us. I would never return to this restaurant again.  With all of the good restaurants in NYC, there is no need to put up with the type of service we received, especially after spending over $300.",,,

The bund was dry and rubber like and hardly No salad or other condiments. The mashed potatoes and the Beetle was good. The price for the burger was a $23 tag. And the beer $8. I renamed the joint never Neverland. I wont go there again. The one star is for the mashed potatoes and the service.,,,
6,Alexandra T.,"Jersey City, NJ",322,351,303,4.0,2/25/2018,"Hudson Malone is right by my office and one of my new fav places in midtown east. Came here with a group of 5 girls for dinner at 8pm on a Friday. When you walk in, you immediately feel like you were transported 100 yrs back in a speakeasy. Loved the relaxed and chill vibe from the beginning. We were brought to our table upstairs and were a few tables from the live piano music. We started off with 2 orders of the veggie Arancini and an order of burrata on crostini. The burrata was bomb. The arancini has a great crispy outside with perfectly cooked sticky risotto on the inside, but overall not a ton of flavor. The dipping sauce on the side was quite light/runny in consistency too so it was hard to put on the arancini. We each ordered drinks throughout dinner...I went with the Hudson Malone red which was like a cab. It was decent. One friend ordered chardonnay and enjoyed it. The second glass she got winded up being sauv blanc but the waiter realized he messed up a few minutes later and brought out a new chard. Others all got cocktails...Moscow mules and vodka sodas. They noted the drinks were really strong.For entrees, 2 ordered the mushroom ravioli special, another two for the Bolognese pasta and I ordered the angry cioppino special. This cioppino was delicious! So much seafood packed into the enormous bowl. This literally could have served 3 people and came with practically an entire loaf of bread...no complaints. Really enjoyed dinner here and the fact that we weren't rushed at all. Dinner took around 2.5 hours as we were talking and catching up and not one did we feel like our table was trying to get turned. The waiter also brought us out some Hershey kisses at the end and showed us some magic tricks. Great service and super friendly staff. They make you feel like an old friend.",,,
7,Danilo F.,"Miami, FL",11,91,91,4.0,1/6/2018,"Nice spot. Had a great late night dinner here a while back. Landed in NY and headed straight here on a recommendation. The service was good, environment was nice and the food was very good.",,,
8,Marissa O.,"New York, NY",11,34,90,4.0,5/18/2018,"Really like this place ! The ambiance is amazing, the owner is awesome, and the food is very good as well. No bar food at all, and beyond what I was expecting. I've had mussels, lobster ravioli, oysters, crab cakes, and creme brulee here and it was all amazing! I did have the Mac and cheese once though and hated it, go figure the only bar foody type item on the menu sucks lol. Just go for the nicer quality items I guess. I am a little disappointed with the drinks though. I came here once and the owner was making my drinks all night, and they were mostly amazing! I found 1 I really like and came back again and it did not taste the same. The other times were regular bartenders and the drinks just tasted a little off. My friend didn't like hers very much either. Just very strong alcohol taste and tart in the drinks. That's the only thing taking a star away. For a speakeasy the cocktails really should be stellar and consistent, and I'd expect there to be strict mixology training at a place like this. I've gotten the same drink be different colors even depending on who made it. It's a shame.",1,,
9,Carlton G.,"Sunnyvale, CA",0,5,0,5.0,10/26/2018,"""This place has magic, baby!"" was a quote I heard from someone who has experience with the place and I have to second that emotion.  Yes, it gets busy and it can be hard at times to find a place to sit, but that's not entirely a bad thing, right. I've met captains of industry here, global financiers, and just neighborly people out to have a good time. If you want a great meal, a fair price, a sunny atmosphere, personal service, and an opportunity to mingle with other talented professionals, I suggest you make a stop to Hudson-Malone, A New York Joint. Oh and it's probably not a bad place for date!",,,
10,Cinthia K.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",227,637,296,1.0,2/3/2018,"I hate to write up reviews that are less than 3 stars, but I just had to write up about my pretty bad experience here:Came here for brunch last weekend with the bf. Even though the restaurant was pretty empty, our service was rather slow and I felt like our server was actively avoiding us (when we walked into the restaurant, she glanced at us, and turned back to what she was doing instead of offering us a seat). Once we were seated, I noticed that she seemed to be more interested in chatting with her friends, who appeared to be in the table just adjacent to ours. I don't blame her, as I'm sure I would feel the same if I was working as a server in a restaurant, but you're still at work. When her friends did vacate the restaurant, though, I did see that the server would disappear to the back, or if she was near the bar area, she was just on her phone.I decided to get one of their special brunch offerings for my meal, which was basically an eggs Florentine, along with a coffee. Our food took a while to get to us, and by the time it did get to us, my food was a bit on the cold side. I would normally flag down the server to let them know, but she was nowhere to be seen, and I did a rather foolish thing and ""sucked it up"" and just ate the crappy food. I wish that was all that was bad about my experience, but after drinking my coffee for a little bit, I noticed that the bottom of my coffee cup was just full of grounds. Our server only came around once to refill our water glasses after we were basically done with our meals, but I at least eventually got another fresh cup of coffee.I'm not sure if this server had something specifically out for me because my bf had no problems with his meal at all. I felt like I may have been singled out. Whatever it was, I feel like this bad experience was enough for me to never want to come back here again.",5,,

Updated review","Doug,Belligerent behavior?  Cutting us off from drinks at the bar?  An elegant Melanie whom you wish to see again?  Dude- you do realize my friend Melanie is UNDERAGE AND YOU AND YOUR BARTENDER WERE SERVING AN UNDERAGE GIRL AT YOUR BAR ALL WHILE TRYING TO HIT ON HER?  Shame on you and your typical older male behavior; you could be arrested for not checking her ID and serving her champagne outside of your restaurant in the middle of the street. As far as my underage friend is concerned, she is not interested in coming back to your sleazy establishment with macho wannabe bartenders and older men like you trying to hit on her.Just stop- you're making yourself and your establishment look horrible and are only adding to exactly how I described my experience at the bar: older men trying to assert their dominance on younger females and being immature.

This place seems like a solid neighborhood joint for drinks and food. The wine list was solid - I had the malbec and my friend had the chardonnay. The staff was friendly and the decor was a eclectic mix of mid 20th century pin up girls. The staff was friendly. There is also an upstairs area, so I imagine this place would be a good spot to throw a dinner party. Will have to come back and try their food next time.",,,

The bartender pulls a bottle out and shows us a Japanese label with a whole snake in it. He didn't know what spirit it is since the buyer made a large purchase from Japan and decided to throw one of these bottles with the order.  Needless to say it was interesting, see photos.The taste profile: mildl and sweet aroma, initial taste was also mild and sweet, as if a cross between bourbon and dry sake. The after taste was a little fishy, perhaps from the snake.The bar has two floors. Second floor has another bar area and bathrooms.  There are a few flat screens at the bar.",2,1,2

18,laura o.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,8/7/2018,"I have never written a review on yelp, let alone a poor review but after my lunch experience with my coworkers today - I felt the need to voice my concerns. Myself and 4 other coworkers decided to go to Hudson Malone after hearing rave reports from our colleague who is based out of Chicago. It was our coworkers birthday and we arrived at approximately 1:15pm when the restaurant was packed for lunch. We ordered our smalls plates, drinks, and meals at the same time - since we were pressed for time and on our lunch break. Our appetizers came out without any problems - and we finished up our small plates while we waited for our main course. At this point, the restaurant had totally cleared out and the waiter only had two tables remaining. After clearing our small plates, the waiter came over and rattled off what he thought were our orders - i.e. you had the caesar salad with chicken and my colleague corrected him that he did not order chicken, my other colleague corrected him that she did not order her steak medium rare. Given that it was lunch time, we had assumed he placed our orders before the small plates and that would be finished up lunch in a timely fashion. When he came over to DOUBLE CHECK our main orders, more than 40 minutes after we sat down, it became clear that he had not put in the main course yet and my colleagues decided realized they needed to leave since they had a call at 230pm. My colleague and I let the waiter know that we would like all of the items boxed to go since the rest of our party had to return to the office. Cut to 30 minutes later and the food runner comes down carrying 3 salads (despite the fact that there were only 2 people still remaining at the table). We then explained that we needed all the food to go and the waiter proceeded to flit around his 2 other tables paying no mind to our time sensitive needs. Despite being there for almost 90 minutes and not receiving our food in a timely fashion, we were not offered any complimentary items or any real apology. To be honest, the waiter had ZERO hustle. He didn't even seem to realize how frustrated we were that half of our party (including the birthday girl) had to leave without getting there food. When we got back to the office with our 5 salads ( 3 steak salad specials, 1 caesar salad and 1 beet salad) - we realized the order was COMPLETELY WRONG. My colleague had chicken on his salad despite correcting the waiter when he confirmed the order. The steak salad was one of the most anticlimactic, disappointing meals of my life. It was literally 4 pieces and lettuce and some congealed steak. If you want to spend 90 minutes, $200 and still feel hungry - I'd suggest going to this restaurant.",3,,

From the moment I walked in the hostess was friendly and professional. This place has been successful in remembering the guests' names, something they take it very seriously. This is something good to know because you want to go to a place where everybody knows your name like that sitcom ""Cheers""! My friend ordered cioppino, the Italian seafood dish. It was huge! You can eat this for 2. Since it's the 2 of us, this dish is perfect! It was served covered in a big bowl then was opened before serving. There's no carb, only the seafood in red tomato sauce.

Luke was great company.I wandered in again in August when the crowds around 5th were a little too much and enjoyed chatting with Jack will having lunch and enjoying a few cocktails. I love the old-school New York vibe in the bar, but greatly appreciate their modern cleanliness standards.

The positive: wasn't crowded on Saturday at 7:30pm. My beer was delivered to the table quickly and tasted like it should. The no so good: Mac and Cheese, mussel pot. I'll start with the latter. I got a few crunchy mussels which makes me think these were not cleaned properly. The Mac and Cheese was not traditional which I'm fine with and while it came out very hot the cheese was a bit soupy and the pancetta not crispy at all (I actually think it was chopped up Canadian bacon). Very bland. Place is a bit pricey. Maybe if you just stick with ordering a burger it will be a better experience. But, wth other good burger joints around I'll spend my money elsewhere.",3,,
50,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",785,817,371,4.0,7/27/2015,"One of the best nights of my three-week trip was the one spent at Hudson Malone. Go Wednesdays so you can hear the tremendously talented Michael Garin on the piano upstairs. He's at Hunt and Fish on Friday nights 7-11 with his spectacular wife, singer Mardie Millit. Michael is one of those longtime New York musicians that makes the city my favorite place to be. Opened by Doug, a beloved bartender at PJ Clarke's, Hudson Malone is unlike anything on the East Side within three or four subway stops in either direction: an upscale pub-like restaurant with terrific food, reasonable prices, and a neighborhood vibe. I read some of the reviews complaining about the prices, but it's less expensive than PJ Clarke's and if you stick with small plates and/or sides, you will get out of there for 25 or less per person just for food. Portions are generous, so splitting is an option. My asparagus gazpacho (with a hint of cream) was delicious. I encouraged my calorie-conscious friend to go with the chicken pot pie rather than the chicken paillard because I could tell immediately it's the sort of place that understands traditional comfort fare. I was of course right; he loved it. But the menu offers more than burgers, mac and cheese, and chicken pot pie. The pork chop (14 ounces) sounded terrific. The young server efficiently recited from memory the specials, some of which were fairly elaborate. My mac and cheese (a small plate) was a bit bland but that's because I asked them to leave off the pancetta. I'm told that much money and thought was put into the decor and have no trouble believing this. The upstairs has the feel of a place as old as PJ Clarke's or Neary's, another old-school restaurant a little further north and east; the red walls, woodwork, and photos on the wall look authentic.

But then we were told that if we brought in two Kosher meals to accommodate the religious requirements of two of the party attendants, there would be a $40 fee. In addition to being discriminatory, it is bad business to turn away a large party during a time when the restaurant tends to be quiet because you want to alienate and tax people who can't eat their food for religious reasons. Over $40, they've lost several hundred dollars as a result of our canceled reservation as well as any future business from our group. We were really disappointed.",3,,

From hand shaking waiters and owners to bartenders that treat you like they used too, like a man. I've lived and worked in the area for 20 years and frequent the restaurants every week. There aren't many that I'll go to on consecutive days but once you walk into Hudson Malone you will want to as well.  On the weekend you can meet Jack at the bar. Non stop energy and laughs. Be sure to ask him about his book and sit back, relax and just wait fo him to explain the specials.  Doug during the week is amazing.  From first walking in and being greeted he friendly hostess who makes you feel right at home to Doug shaking your hand and telling you a story of the local grind.  The food speaks for itself. Delicious. Try the lobster appetizer. Awesome.  I've had about everything on the menu and look forward to more. From dinners to appetizers with this place you can't go wrong.

I'm pretty sure their pasta and sauce is homemade, but having made both myself I feel validated in saying that something about their pappardelle bolognese ($17) was off. I suspect the noodles were rolled too thin and trimmed too wide and the sauce wasn't as meaty-flavored as it could have been.The jumbo asparagus were indeed jumbo, but they were simply grilled and minimally seasoned.Lastly the papa doble was tart. It was well made, but I asked the waiter to recommend a sweet drink.Service was great: prompt, attentive, properly servile. The waiter even returned to provide us with separate receipts. Then again, we were a fairly large group of five on a relatively empty Friday night. Despite the large screen TV, screening soccer, and the bar, this place felt more like a restaurant. This place especially feels like a restaurant with the prices, but the quality of their food doesn't stand up to it. Everyone in my party ordered at least an entree and a drink, and we all ended up paying at least $35. There wasn't any loud music playing here, still I'd rather get a drink at Crimson and Rye and a burger- elsewhere.",1,,

Unfortunately our friends ended up on the wrong train (new to NYC - we've all been there) and it took them about 2 hours to actually meet up with us. Anyhow -- most places require the entire party present before they seat you, even though there were two of us (requesting a table for 8) they seated us and when we learned our friends were going to be VERY late- we offered to give up the table. Our server was not pushy AT ALL and said he didn't care if there were 2 of us who weren't even going to order food - he'd be happy to let us stay there there all night. We opted to give up our table any way and he still went out of the way to serve us in the high top section of the bar. I wish I would have gotten his name because he was THE BEST. He continued to take care of us, giving us drink & food recommendations and everything was spot on. Per his rec we went with the Bruschetta appetizer. I'm not kidding when I say this was by far the best Bruschetta I've ever had. Something so simple but done incredibly well. Mozzarella was plentiful and FRESH, with just the right amount of sweet balsamic glaze on a perfectly toasted baguette, truly divine. My sister and I were full after just the app!  My sister has frequented Hudson Malone solely based on the service itself and I can happily agree it was on par.

Prices are a little steep but that sort of comes with the territory and the neighborhood, IMHO. Negative reviews seem to stem more from dining and table-based experiences.

74,Christopher K.,"East Brunswick, NJ",896,694,903,5.0,2/28/2014,"Hudson Malone has earned what few establishments earn from me - a glowing 5-star review. Granted, I have only been here once, and I rarely give any place a 5-star review without trying it multiple times, but I'm making an exception here.Several colleagues and I had just finished up at an early morning event promoting the Sochi Olympics at Grand Central Station. It was just after noon on a Sunday and we already had a few morning cocktails in us from the event. We were starving. Upon learning that my usual standby, the Oyster Bar, was closed for renovations, I quickly reached for the Yelp and starting hunting down a good brunch spot in the area. Hudson Malone quickly surfaced to the top with great reviews, though I found it interesting that there was a real split of opinion among some of my most trusted Yelpers. But hell, It was a gorgeous day out, perfect for a stroll in the City, so we decided to go for it and walk the ten or so blocks uptown to try it out. Since we were 12 people, I called ahead and was pleasantly surprised when I was told they would have no problem seating us when we got there. This can sometimes be a bad sign, of course. But alas, it turned out to be a great sign for what was to come.We entered the dark confines of Hudson Malone and were quickly escorted to a rock star table toward the back of the room. They are definitely rocking the saloon vibe here, which I really like. There were very few people inside. We pretty much had the place to ourselves, which I frankly find a little weird given it was the height of Sunday brunch. But soon the next round of cocktails started flowing, and I stopped thinking about such things. I recall having some delicious twist on the Manhattan, while my colleagues sampled their other speciality drinks. Everyone was feeling really good by the time the food start coming out of the kitchen.The funny thing about breakfast/brunch for me is that I am generally a savory guy. I prefer salty and spicy over sweet and sugary in the morning, which is why I rarely ever order pancakes, waffles or French toast. While the brunch menu at Hudson Malone is properly-sized with only a few key items to choose from, the variety could not be more perfect. We ended up starting with the NY Mini Cheeseburgers and the Rustic Burrata. The sliders were nothing short of perfection -- cooked right on the edge of rare/medium rare, seasoned wonderfully, and not too much bun. The quality of the meat was excellent and had that awesome crunchy/bloody taste and texture that we carnivores so crave. As for the burrata -- well, you know what I say about burrata: a creation made by god himself -- it was splendid. And it was served exactly the way I like it -- lightly dressed with EVOO and balsamic and served with sliced tomatoes; a few cracks of salt and pepper atop each bite. I could eat this all day long.Moving backward from this lunch-like fare, our next course was breakfast. I was in the mood for something sweet, and this was the perfect opportunity to order the sliver dollar buttermilk pancakes. Although I'm not a big pancake guy, these were great!  Not too fluffy, not too heavy, and a little bit on the crisp and crunchy side, these pancakes were the perfect transition away from our first course. But the real star of the second course were the sides of breakfast sausage. I usually prefer bacon over sausage, but I'm glad we went in this direction. Perfectly-sized links, a little sweet, a little spicy, and a nice crunch on the outside -- they were the perfect companion to the pancakes. I don't know for sure, but they tasted so good I have to think they were made in house. I absolutely recommend this pairing together.Other folks in our group tried the Madame Crunch -- Malone's decadent version of the Croque Madame. Loved it. No complaints whatsoever. The others tried the Eggs Delmonico, which is essentially Eggs Benedict. Not my thing, but my colleagues went bonkers for it.We ended up sitting at the table for over three hours, maybe four. Service was excellent and the drinks never stopped flowing. Needless to say, it was a long train ride back home to Jersey afterward. I slept very well. And of course, all of this fun and great food came with a hefty price tag. But it was money well spent for a fantastic afternoon in the big city. Kudos, Hudson Malone. You guys are running a great operation in my opinion.Just a warning that if you run out into the sunlight after being inside the darkness of Hudson Malone for a more than a few minutes, your eyes may very well burst into flames.

The meat should of been aged a little longer. The creamed spinach was way too creamy, and the mashed potatoes were very dry, not moist at all.

First as far as the bar aspect, the bartender has that ""old fashioned"" neighborhood style where he acts like everyone is his best customer, calling them babe, etc. -- definitely comes off as a little slimy to me but there were a bunch of regulars there who clearly liked him. Food wise, the menu was annoying -- huge but nothing had descriptions (""beet salad"" and that's it) so especially as someone who doesn't eat meat, I felt like it was a guessing game. I ended up getting a salmon salad that was a special and it was really disappointing -- $18 for literally 6 bites including a few tiny pieces of salmon, some walnut pieces and blue cheese. My dad had the chicken pot pie and said it was decent.",,,

87,Steve O.,"New York, NY",7,79,4,2.0,6/20/2015,"I wanted to like this place. A midtown bar styled as a speakeasy, with a fake storefront name 'Eva's Dress Shop' could have been cool. The other Yelp rev's are generally positive. So, it turns out, I am with the minority. There is nothing special about this restaurant or bar; and despite the styling it is better as a mid-tier restaurant than as a bar.Cocktails are haphazardly made. I tried two different standards: perfect Manhattan and rye Old Fashioned. Neither were particularly good, and the Old Fashioned suffered from being too sweet and too little booze. These guys miss the mark by a mile. And my bartender was slow and lumbering at his job -though he did ask us six or seven times if we wanted yet another.  The atmosphere is perfectly boring midtown. The bar is long and uncomfortable. Even on the off-night when I went, the din of noise made it hard to hear.  Ever hear of acoustical engineering? It's a good investment for a bar and restaurant, generally -and certainly for a 'speakeasy' (but you can't, or you won't be heard). At the bar, you can sit on a padded stool -but there are no seats with backs. Tables we were told, even at 10pm, were reserved for dining (they have no idea what dining is). The attempt to laden the walls with mid-century or older memorabilia just made it look kitchy. There was really no coherent theme. Cost is usual or a bit high for this style of bar. Really, it's no better -and in some cases worse- than a midtown irish bar. And it seems there are no 'buybacks' -if I've bought three drinks at a bar (and I had), I expect the NY rule to come into play. So between us, I spent over $70 just on the booze and beer for a mediocre product, with a loud and less-than-appealing atmosphere. As the Yelp saying goes 'Meh. I've experienced better.'",2,1,
88,O C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,81,0,1.0,2/1/2015,"We walked into this place on a cold afternoon - after a busy day where we had nothing to eat all day this self-proclaimed ""New York joint"" appeared to be everything we were looking for: cozy, warm, varied menu, 3/4 full.But that changed soon enough:First, they have a ""B"" grade from the health inspector.  I dismissed this as a bad break or unlucky timing.  We ordered soup, latkes, onion rings and two 3 El burgers.  The burger is $23 so I was expecting something amazing.  It was average at best:  the special blend was flavorless, bacon seemed to be flaccid and undercooked, the carmelized onions and cheese were indistinguishable in flavor and texture.  Awful! Go to Del Fresco's and get a far better burger for a buck or two more.  My friend didn't enjoy her undercooked burger (medium rare came out rare) so we ordered fried chicken: 2 drumsticks and a wing for $21.  No acknowledgement from the waiter that 4/5 of her burger was on the plate and we asked for something else.The worst is yet to come:  We head directly home from the restaurant.  90 minutes later (at 8:30 on a Saturday night) I say I'm not feeling great and lay down.  At 9:30 I wake up knowing I have to vomit but I'm in that state where you wait it out.  9:45 - bathroom for violent vomiting10:00 - back to bed, shivering under the covers10:50 - wake up again, having to vomit immediately11:00 - back to bed...12:00 - another trip to the bathroom  this went on EVERY HOUR UNTIL 5:00 am - that's eight trips to throw-up $200 worth of awful food.  The 4:00 and 5:00 trips were 100% dry heaves so you know something wasn't right.

I don't really care what they look like honestly, i just had to throw that in there so you could visualize their attitude. Their staff is over all rude.

The dishes I saw go by were unimpressive and nobody at my table had much to say about the food. The cocktails are poorly made and watery, as a few others have mentioned.I was here with a group. Several in our party clearly ordered small plates as their main course; all were delivered with the appetizers. The main courses began to be delivered nearly 40 minutes after the appetizers; a few dishes here and there, with everyone else left to wait. Some folks were done eating before others got served.The killer for me, however, was when a plate was delivered to a table near me and sent back a few minutes later. To my utter amazement, I watched as the server removed the plate and then attempted to serve it to ME at my table. When I told him I wasn't going to eat a rejected plate that had been sitting on someone else's table for five minutes, he apologized and offered to have the kitchen fire a new one. I canceled my order instead.I was able to have two drinks at Hudson Malone. The server forgot to deliver my third and then never came near our end of the table to take another order.

She was very unaccommodating when it came to splitting the bills or keeping our tabs separate (which, for drinks, shouldn't be that hard). She also did not return one of the credit cards--which we were told she needed to hold our table.For the overpriced cocktails that were just okay, it was a real bummer of experience. Adding to that, I went to go retrieve the credit card the next day and was told I needed to come back four hours later, at which point the bartender could help. I took to Twitter with my complaint: one week later, I received this response: We sincerely apologize for your inconvenience and poor experience. That particular evening we had some challenges upstairs.We hope you'll stop in again.  We only aim to please and to provide our guests with a great night out.With zero incentive offered.

104,Kate S.,"Brooklyn, NY",165,38,1,1.0,5/9/2014,"I'm not really sure where to start. First, the good things: ambiance was good and food was yum.Everything else was pretty awful. First off, we had about 12 people in our group. Of the 12, the waiter messed up our drink orders for 8 of the people.We ordered shots. Forty five minutes and a reminder later, no shots came.We asked for a tab. Half an hour later, no tab. We had to flag down a different waiter.Since we were a big group, we asked the waiter to let us know and cap our bill at $300. This did not happen. When our bill came, it was $650.We approached the manager and asked to see an itemized bill. We were a big group, but we had only ordered two rounds of drinks and found it hard to believe our bill could be that high. We thought that perhaps our bill was high because the waiter didn't subtract the drinks he brought us as a mistake. Not only did the manager, Doug, refuse to show us our bill, he said that he wouldn't talk to us because we were drunk. While it was true we had been drinking (surprise! We were at a bar), none of us were. However, even if we were drunk, that doesn't mean we don't have the right to see what we were being charged for. One of the people in the group got upset and told someone Doug was being a piece of sht. He became angry at that, and at that point, asked us to leave. We thought this was unreasonable...yes, it was rude, but we still have a right to see the bill we were charged for.There are lots of excellent bars in this area, and I know this place has gotten some good reviews. However, the complete lack of respect from the manager/owner and inability to reason because he was emotional was incredibly disturbing.

But this is just a watering hole packed full of people after work. The place is decent. Doug, the owner/bartender is pretty much obnoxious calling everyone ""Baby"" (even the dudes). Cocktails are 101 classics, that use well spirits for $16 each. If you want a proper call, as the basic recipes call for, it's a stiff $19. Seriously? The best mixology and cocktail bars in Manhattan don't charge more than $16 for their best cocktails.

110,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,4.0,1/26/2014,"Hudson Malone is a great new addition to the midtown East area. This could easily become your favorite bar. Perfect for after work or casual, intimate meetups, the crowd has a very good mix. Dim lights, tin pressed ceilings, dark wood furniture, polished bars, make for a chill and romantic ambiance. The owner, Doug, and his posse of cool bartenders are very personable and sociable folks. Service is great and consistent with each visit. You'll feel at ease and welcome every time. Hudson Malone is only steps away from the train station. If you see a sign up front that reads 'Evie's Dress Shop', you're at the right place. Walk in, and you'll be greeted by an immediate warmth. The atmosphere captures and evokes an old Manhattan feel, as though transported through time. While their cocktails are consistently well-made, one should consider trying the food here. They have a standard selection of bar food items. In my past visits, I've managed to try the Stacked Grilled Cheese (cheddar cheese, tomato, bacon, sourdough bread, hand-cut fries), NY Dip Au Jus (campagnola tomatoes, sautéed onions), and the NY Mini Cheeseburgers served with hand-cut fries. Stacked Grilled Cheese was great, super substantial, and an item worth getting. As for the mini cheeseburgers, wasn't personally fond of them as they were rather ordinary and wimpy in portions. For only 3 small sliders, and for $16, you could perhaps skip this one. The NY Dip Au Jus wasn't all too bad, and I'd say it was a second favorite alongside the Stacked Grilled Cheese. In terms of their fries, they're very crispy and well-seasoned, a nice side addition to snack on as you drink.All in all, Hudson Malone is a great midtown spot that will make you want to come back many and more times. The staff is wonderful, and the owner is a very nice guy. It's considerably on the pricy scale, but one has to consider the location and the fact that this business is new. Regardless, Hudson carries a special charm that separates it from many of the other midtown bars.",15,5,9

And the other concoction Luke (I think that was his name) made up was equally as fantastic. Taquila and ginger with other yumminess...what's not to love?!?!!! Another note worthy point adding to the greatness of this place is that they have great drinks, great beers and common beers!

124,Matt D.,"ASTORIA, NY",109,6,0,3.0,3/17/2014,"Came here on Saturday night with a few friends.  They arrived before I did, and had a few appetizers already ordered, all of which were pretty good (risotto balls, mac and cheese, and calamari).  Beer selection was good, though a bunch of their taps were switched over to Guinness only for St. Patrick's Day.  Waiter was extremely friendly, though a few issues.Dinner cost them a star.  Asked what the ""Caligula Style"" steak was.  The waiter didn't know.  He said he could ask the bartenders, but they wouldn't know either, as only two people would know and neither of them were there.  How about asking the kitchen, since they have to know how to make it?  Missed the chance for a serious upsell there.  Chicken I got was good enough, but the creamed spinach was yech.  It was literally spinach dumped in some cream/butter type concoction.  Way to rich and undermixed.  Went pretty much untouched.  We ordered all three sorbets and I ordered an Old Fashioned.  Wasn't until the sorbets were served that they told us they were out of the coconut (would have been nice to know that sooner).  And my O.F. came out pink in color.  Why, why, why do places insist on putting grenadine or cherry juice in the drink?  Just sugar, bitters, rye, and add a cherry.  No need to color it up, completely changes the taste.  Anyway that would be just .5 star but Yelp doesn't allow that.  I'll be back, but not often if it's the same type of experience.",2,,1
125,Nathan L.,"New York, NY",256,282,5,4.0,2/9/2014,This was a fun date spot the other night.  The decor of the restaurant is great with the main bar attracting most of the action.  The drinks are well made and the food is really good as well.  We split the mussels and sliders.  The mussels were average compared to most of the other mussels that I have had recently but the sliders were awesome.  I definitely recommend trying them.  This is a great after work spot that you should definitely check out.,2,,1

Unlike the people of Ireland, the bartender and waitstaff is always on point and working hard. While we enjoy drink in Bulgaria, we are still able to slaughter the Mongols. In Ireland though, they just lay down for the English. What kind of a country are they? Dubliners may as well be loyalists to Constantine Tikh.

The staff was friendly enough, but they were clearly overwhelmed once the crowd got big. My first cocktail was fine, but my second was served without a twist. The waitress seemed surprised when I asked if she could  bring one. That's not a capital offense by any means, but it was a surprising lack of attention to detail. I was hoping this place would focus on serving really excellent cocktails, but maybe my expectations were just too high. Still better than most of the alternatives around midtown.",2,,

There's this great big wooden table in the back that's good for a big group, but reserve it! Alot of character. And the owner Justin is super nice guy.The food is very good - burgers, sliders, onion rings, fries, risotto balls - all yum. Can't wait to continue drinking here and trying everything on the menu.

Simply put; Hudson Malone is an average midtown bar with overpriced drinks and food that's memorable if only for it's mediocrity.

Had we stayed at the bar, this would have been a better review.We sat down to eat, 2 people at first and then were joined by 3 more friends. The food was good, not great. Standard bar fare.  The waitress made it obvious she was annoyed at our growing party despite it not being busy at that time. She was short and rather inattentive but some waitresses are.The bill came and and I was horrified to see that the 2 glasses of white wine SPRITZER (wine watered down with seltzer) were a whopping $21 a glass. All the wines listed at the bar averaged about $14, so I must have gotten the top shelf seltzer. I asked about it, but didn't make a scene. She was unapologetic at best. I let it go, lesson learned.The bill was paid, 2 people left cash - 2 of us paid with cards. All was right in the world until my friend looked at her bank statement today to see that the entire transaction was posted to her account.  Not sure what happened to the cash we left or the money deducted from my account but she's now placed a call to the bar as well as her bank.If you go, go with cash stick to the bar and keep your receipts... or just save yourself the effort and get charged for over-priced seltzer elsewhere.",8,,

The food is edible, the cocktails are a bit watery, and the clientele is largely male and uniformly white collar.

He failed to address the situation in a respectful manner, would not serve the other ten of us at the bar unless all 20 were under the same tap. First thought he was joking, but he was clearly on a mission - and that was to make our failure repeatedly transparent to us and have us leave his floor. It's beyond me how somebody like this ended up in the hospitality business. Nobody of us was intoxicated, impolite or impatient.

179,David E.,"Mission Viejo, CA",0,26,0,4.0,8/24/2014,Classy NY bar. Atmosphere cool and best bartenders in business. They make you feel comfortable and care. What more can you ask for.,,,
180,dari s.,"Manhattan, NY",56,17,0,2.0,6/17/2015,"Decided to stop by on the way home from walking my dog.. Asked how long it would take for a burger and fries. Placed the order ; came back in the alloted time. NO order was ready.. The waiter kept reassuring me, the food was ""on its way"". code for the Cook hadn't put it on the grill.. Finally 25 minutes after the initial order and 15 minutes after the promised time: I was handed my food.. the order was WRONG. how hard is it to mess up a burger and fries?? Got home to the worst commercial burger/patty that I have had in a long time.. bland and tasteless.. made even more horrible by the ommission of ketchup..all this for $17..Next time I will go to Mickey D..Perhaps since the sign outside indicates a dress shop , the owners should think about tailoring their orders/cooking in a different way..Even though I live across the street.. this place is not convienint enough to warrant a repeat visit..",1,1,
181,Patty B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,5.0,10/24/2015,"Just brought my very picky in laws to dinner at Hudson Malone and everyone left with completely clean plates. Appetizers were delicious - the tomato soup never disappoints and we got special endive salad and artichoke heart starter. We had the special burger, hangar steak and pork chop and kids shared the sliders and everyone was more than happy. In a word, YUM. We'll be back.",,,
182,I S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0,5.0,7/24/2014,"I've been only during ""off hours"" but on of my trio of visits, the drinks were strong and well crafted and the food was a step up from the typical bar fare. The bartenders have smiles and have been attentive, though again, unsure how it's like during peak hours. It's a bit on the pricier side, but it's midtown, and the quality is good, and for what else is out there in the area, I can't imagine there are many better pubs around.",,,
183,Lesson L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,27,5,1.0,3/18/2016,"I have visited this restaurant/bar a few times (no more than five, individual visits) over the past two months. On each visit, the bar staff seemed to engage in sleazy behavior. For example, on one visit, I was three-quarters finished with a pint, when another one appeared. When I advised the bartender that I did not order the additional pint, he simply walked away. I then refused to drink the pint and asked for my bill -- upon which the additional pint appeared. They refused to remove the pint from the bill -- so, I paid without tip. Despite this experience, I came back for another visit (around 9:30pm on a Friday night). This time, the bartender asked me what I was drinking, to which I advised that I wanted to see a menu first. The bartender simply repeated, ""what are you drinking?"" Refusing to be bullied by the bartender, I told him, somewhat more forcibly, that I wanted a menu. Unlike the previous visit, on which I was served and charged for a pint I did not ask for, I actually got my menu. At this point, I will not return and encourage visitors to carefully review your bill before paying.",2,,1
184,David R.,"New York, NY",0,5,2,5.0,11/24/2013,"A great bar run by the ultimate bar-man Doug Quinn! Impeccable service, positive energy and moody lighting make 'the joint"" a real gem!",1,,
185,Enchanted o.,"New York, NY",2,48,1,4.0,1/3/2014,I really like this place. Our drinks could have been colder but the burger is delightful. I will definitely be back. Chill the champagne for me will ya?,,,
186,Lucky U.,"New York, NY",1,56,2,4.0,12/20/2013,"Hudson Malone is located in the old Tammany Hall aka the old Black Finn.  Prime location for the Midtown East corporate crowd.  Doug is an amazing bartender and I was lucky to visit the bar before the NYP review.However, I went again last night and it was a complete and utter sh*t show.  Doug and another man was behind the bar and there was no way they were keeping their orders straight.  First drinks we ordered were on point, second round the vodka was different, and finally on the bill they charged us for a drink we didn't even order.We didn't argue because we love Doug and we love the bar, but they really need to either hire more people or figure out a way to deal with the enormous popularity of the place.A good bartender is hard to find, so I hope this place figures out how to handle all its fans before people start getting fed up.",,,
187,John L.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,4.0,1/23/2014,Service was really top notch! The menu was filled with a lot of good comfort foods..try the Grilled Cheese. Nice to have a place in midtown east without the attitude and isn't a Frat boy scene. Made me feel like I was in an old time New York Saloon. The communal table in the back is great for getting acquainted with your fellow NYC imbibers,,,
188,RB W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,1.0,3/12/2014,Terrible $22 burger. Service OK but it was dead at lunch. My friend's creamed spinach was cold and inedible.Won't be returning. If you are mainly into booze I am sure it is great.,5,,1
189,D A.,"Davenport, IA",0,9,0,5.0,5/18/2014,"Excellent place for dinner and drinks.  Awesome atmosphere, great service, tasty food, outstanding drinks.  Don't miss this one!",3,1,
190,Sam B.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,3.0,7/1/2014,"Nice looking place on 53 and reasonably friendly staff.  Crowd was a typical midtown amalgamation of suits, summer interns and general NYC phonies.  I am a NYC professional who eagerly anticipated hanging out in places like this while struggling in my early 20s.  Fat forward a decade and I cannot accept that 2 decent cocktails and 1 bourbon (Jefferson's) cost over $60 + tip.  Places are free to charge what they wish and I begrudge them nothing given their location, clientele and renovated space.  I would advise that anyone looking for an authentic NY experience of truly great cocktail or liquor selection seek out something else.  This appears to be primarily a place to be seen and strikes me as an midweek after-work/weekend bridge and tunnel place masquerading as a cocktail bar.",2,1,1
191,Jillian W.,"New York, NY",1,126,0,5.0,1/10/2014,Amazing! Best bar service in NYC. Beautifully made cocktails. The bar was packed last night after work---yet no one was waiting for drinks. The staff and the customers are all happy and having a wonderful time. I haven't tried their food yet--but looking forward to doing so soon. looking for a midtown spot? Put this high on your list.,2,,
192,Ro M.,"Del Mar, CA",0,4,0,5.0,12/22/2014,"Wish we lived closer. Hudson Malone would be our regular watering hole. Fantastic, consistent service with equally good food & drink. Doug Quinn was the reason we frequented PJ Clarke's. We look forward to our next visit. Hudson Malone is the quintessential New York Joint! Cheers!",,,
193,Emily C.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,1/6/2015,"This place is really horrible.  I am not moved to write reviews very often, but I feel compelled.  We held a private party here and the woman helping us plan it had the most awful attitude of anyone I have ever dealt with -- she acted like she doing us a favor, it was pulling teeth to get any information out of her, and when we finally called her out on her attitude, she was incredibly rude and disrespectful to us.  When we complained to the owner, he was just as rude and disrespectful.  We were shocked at his reaction, to be honest.  No wonder he got fired from PJ Clarke's.  They have a nice cocktail menu and the bartenders can make good drinks, but the food at our party was not good.  A ""cheese plate"" with slivers of cheese so thin you couldn't even pick them up, NO crackers or bread to accompany the chese, sliders that didn't even appear until halfway through the party when many people had left... etc.  it was a big disappointment, especially since they charge so much more than anyone else in the neighborhood.  I throw a lot of group events and if you're planning a cocktail party or private party, I'd highly recommend one of the other lovely restaurants around that charges much less and will treat you much better.",5,,
194,Kristina M.,"Williston Park, NY",0,3,0,1.0,7/7/2014,"Went on dead July 4th  afternoon. Loved the comfy décor, but that was the only thing we loved. There we maybe 10 people  inside but the gruff bartender was rushing us with the order. The mojito my friend ordered was terrible; served in a short glass, filled with mint, tart and bitter. We ordered fried calamari -- what a mistake. They serve it frozen and not freshly made. It was NOT the worse frozen fried calamari I ever had, but parts had that papery freezer burns taste. When I asked the bartender about it I was told ""I have no idea how they make it."" Wow, when you serve food at the bar you are supposed to know what you are serving and how it is being prepared. People will inquire. The Caesar salad advertised to be served with anchovies came with globs of commercial dressing and 3 pieces of anchovies on a side. They did not even chop the  fish so I could mix it with the salad. The hamburgers were ordered: one medium well and one medium. They arrived-- one medium and one well done. While the beef was acceptable, I'll go back to PJ's if I want a juicy tasty little burger. We had 3 cocktails, 2 glasses of wine and the above food -- the tab was 120.00. Never again. As a New Yorker, even though I know Midtown prices are well above average, I think this is far too high for the poor quality we received. The only good thing was, we were not charged for the horrible mojito. July 4th is a quiet weekend and one would think they want to accommodate and be nice to customers. There were no crowds waiting to get in.",5,,
195,Lisa C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,2,0,5.0,12/17/2013,"uptown bar with a downtown feel. cozy feel, great ambiance and a perfect martini. and a bartender that remembers your name. what else could you ask for??? i'll def be back there.",2,,
