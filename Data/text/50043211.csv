We didn't use the gym, but we did view it and it was a good size with updated equipment. No microwave in the room, but there was a mini fridge. Complimentary tea offered at night and coffee in the morning. The staff was also very friendly and very helpful. I highly recommend staying here.",,,

Updated review","I sent a complained to the the business department, and to no surprise, there was no response from this hotel.Stay away. The customer service is terrible, the managers could care less. It's not worth it.",3,,
4,Kiki K.,"Lincoln, RI",76,145,390,4.0,6/28/2018,"I had a very enjoyable stay here. Everyone from the concierge, doormen, bartender and through to the housekeepers were extremely courteous, hospitable, kind, and to my surprise, quite charismatic and hilarious. We practically made friends with each and every staff member that we interacted with. There were no requests that went unfulfilled and no questions that went unanswered. The room, while small (though expected in the heart of NYC), was quite chic (and total side note but umm, the lighted bathroom mirror was fabulous). With the friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere, it took me all of two seconds to feel at home here. With that said, this hotel does not stand without some slight cons. Our view was nonexistent, as we landed a center room with a window that lent sight to a bare ""courtyard"" and some bricks on the other side of the hotel, though with curtains and a full schedule this wasn't much a bother. The only other issue was the mini-fridge, fully stocked with non-complimentary refreshments. This would not have bothered me so much if there were maybe *some* room to store maybe one water bottle? But all of the real estate was taken by overpriced bait. You'll have to temporarily relocate the items yourself, or you can have the hotel do it for a cool $50. Overall, the staff and environment of this hotel make up for all else otherwise. Oh yeah and the beds are super comfy!",,1,
5,Michael J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,10,1.0,4/27/2018,"I booked this hotel because it was available and the cheapest (but not cheap) option. Check in was easy but it was also almost 9pm. When I got to my room I thought I was in a closet. The room has a queen bed with about 3 feet of space on the sides. There is no closet just a rack screwed to the wall. The mirror is leaning against the wall and the only outlet is a power strip. The first night the toilet flushed every 5 mins and you can hear every word of conversations in the hall. I stopped at the desk and told them the toilet issue and it was fixed when I got back. The bed is lumpy, the AC is loud and woke me every time it went on. After waking up the second morning I used the bathroom and found a half drunk cup of coffee on the sink. It wasn't mine. Either the maid or maintenance guy left it here. Not a great place to stay won't stay again.",4,,
6,Vince M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,0,2.0,9/7/2018,Buyer beware - my room was the size of a decent closet.  Almost $300 for literally the smallest room l've ever stayed in.  Called to ask if this was standard size and was told yes.  Absolutely no check in until 3pm - period.  Problems getting internet passcode.,1,,
7,Howard B.,"Miami, FL",152,407,914,3.0,5/10/2018,"The Ameritania is A-OK and a good value for the money.  I might have rated it a 4 if I had been given a room on a higher floor.  Unfortunately, I had a room on the 3rd floor and I need to deduct a star for too much street noise.  Now, onto the positives.  The lobby was great.  The bar was better than average for a hotel and Javier the bartender was very nice and also efficient.  The staff at the desk were courteous and helpful.  Rooms were well decorated and cleaning services decent.  The rooms are on the smaller side, but typical for NYC.  The location was really great on the North side of Times Square and on Broadway & 54th.  The Ed Sullivan Theatre where the Beatles played in the US for the 1st time and where The Late Show with Stephen Cobert (the best!) is done now is literally next door.  I was in town for a conference 3 blocks away at the Hilton and saved money staying at the Ameritania.  I would go back if the price was right.",1,1,1
8,Melly N.,"New York, NY",29,2,1,1.0,12/15/2017,This hotel is terrible! The rooms are dirty. The Staff is disrespect. Nobody wants to help you. The food is disgusting. Just an overall bad experience. Only good thing was the location. Never again,3,,
9,Sloane A.,"Lompoc, CA",0,5,0,5.0,12/20/2017,"Overall we were very pleased with our stay. The location was very cool for checking out time square and the Rockefeller tree. Also Rupert Jees Hello Deli is just around the corner. Hotel is definitely in the tourist hustle and bustle. Next time we might look for something a little more out of the way, but we really like the hotel and room. Also, Jeff the doorman was super nice!! Good job Jeff! Pros - clean rooms-updated space - down blankets that were super comfy - nice pillows - cool rainfall shower - door men were so nice and attentive - great temperature adjustment in the room- fun decor and space Cons- desk staff are not super overwhelmingly friendly or informational for tourists  - had some issues with the bar next door being a little loud at night.(but the three monkeys bar right outside the hotel was really cozy and had good drinks and food.  Wings and flat bread were great. Bloody Mary not so much.) - fridge in the room is full to the brim with mini bar supplies. So full that you cannot use the fridge at all... unless you pull things out of it. - no coffee maker in the room. MAN! This place would be great if they just gave you a little coffee in the room.",2,,1
10,Tee M.,"Bronx, NY",3,34,47,4.0,1/24/2018,My stay here was good. I have no major complaints about anything. The only thing that was annoying to me was I booked this through booking.com & payed for everything but when I got here ready to check in they charge an additional $100.00 deposit fee like wtf? Why not mention that. And you have to pay for it because canceling the room would've been another charge smh. Other than that the room was ready & I got checked in with no problem. I booked a deluxe queen room and the room was super small but clean & the bed was super comfortable. They mentioned that they charge $18 for breakfast per person but I wasn't interested. Checkout was a breeze nothing complicated. If you're looking for something spacious this is not for you. I hate the surprise fee they charged me at the last min so I wouldn't be coming back but other than that it was cool.,1,,
11,Eric M.,"Akron, OH",46,64,2,5.0,11/27/2017,"Chose this hotel for my wife and daughter's girls weekend in NYC. Great location, great customer service, modern design that helped set the mood for the girls and a great value.",,,
12,Maria M.,"San Francisco, CA",1563,289,2131,4.0,1/21/2017,"Perfect location in Hell's Kitchen. I always stay in this part of midtown it's close enough to Times Square where I can just walk to watch my Broadway plays and close enough to Central Park where I lime walking around. Hotel slightly dated but still has a fun, vibrant lobby and bar. Small breakfast room... my room did not come with breakfast it was an additional $11 for breakfast but hey I'm in NYC I could walk to any corner and get a great cheap breakfast. Great staff! Check-in was at 3pm but since I got in on the redeye they were kind enough to check me in. Got a room with 2 double beds. Very spacious and comfortable. They later on moved me and my boyfriend to a room with a queen size bed on a higher floor but room was much smaller. Still nice and had all the comforts for guests. Free toiletries always a plus. Had a safe, ironing board, hair dryer and even a umbrella in case we needed it. I love the thoughtfulness of the hotel.I would always wear socks since I felt the rug wasn't clean. A complaint was the hallways smelled like cigarettes even on non-smoking floors. Hopefully they do a deep cleaning of the rugs since that's where the smell comes from.Either than that I still like this hotel. It was clean, comfortable, location was great and it was a hip and fun hotel! Four stars!",5,3,3

He never made eye contacted , he talked towards the desk. He also spoke with aggressive manner. Not what your first impression of a hotel visit should be . Especially since I am a paying guest. Honestly the rest of the staff was great , aside from this rude Guest clerk.",3,,
14,Chantal M.,"Atlanta, GA",10,104,30,5.0,7/24/2017,"Upon booking, I checked the reviews and was a bit hesitant as some people mentioned the hallways being musty and small rooms, dirty carpets etc... so I was expecting the worst. Well we booked a small room, however, Johnny was kind enough to upgrade us and give us a King room for no extra charge! That was $50.00 savings per night. The hotel was clean as a whistle, the elevators were plenty and the LOCATION was amazing!!!!! We walked to central park and times square from our hotel! Internet wasn't free but we were so busy we didn't even notice! This will be our GO TO NYC hotel. Loved it 100%.",1,,
15,Tiffany D.,"Garden Grove, CA",501,7,4,4.0,12/28/2017,"I am surprised that this hotel has fewer than an average of four stars. I recently just visited New York for a few days and booked with The Ameritania due to the nightly rates and its close proximity to Times Square and Central Park. You do get what you pay for, so keep in mind that this is no 5-star luxury hotel.Pros:- Clean!!- Walking distance to Times Square, Central Park, Starbucks, subway stations- Conveniently located next door to The Three Monkeys (a bar that is open until 4 a.m.)- Modern bathroom always restocked with extra toiletries- Cozy lobby, provides water and coffee - Friendly concierge: Greets and opens the door when you come and go, happy to help store your luggage in the storage room, makes sure that you have transportation to the airport Cons:- Overall small room and bathroom- Overpriced and unimpressive breakfast- No complimentary wifi",1,,
16,Rosalie O.,"Islip Terrace, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/23/2017,"The hotel itself was nice and clean.  However we stayed on the second floor and around 4am someone started playing the trumpet! We complained at the front desk upon check out the next morning and were told that had we called the desk at 4am, they would have moved our room. Umm, no thanks. Who would want to pack up and move at 4am. Not a good solution. Then the clerk told me that it was a transient resident that was doing this. Of course we were not told there were transient residents in this hotel. The staff were very did not seem to care or think this was something that should be disclosed to guests. I informed them there are plenty of other places to stay in Manhattan and the Ameritania hotel would not be one of them. Such a shame as they have a great central location.",3,1,
17,Linda R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,4.0,7/3/2018,This is a great place to stay with a super location! The only reason I didn't give it more stars is because the a/c could not keep up with the 95 degree temps outside.,,,

20,Melissa R.,"Charlotte, NC",65,19,21,5.0,4/27/2017,"This hotel is in an awsome location. The rooms are modern and have plenty of space for an NYC hotel. Reasonable price for where it is. Bathroom is really cool.  There's a little deli a few doors down that was on point. They have a stocked mini bar in the fridge with liquor, water and sodas. Also little snack trey and some other interesting items available for purchase  ;)Check in was fast and the staff were nice. Beds were super comfy and overall the room was very clean.My only complaint....the air conditioner is loud and rattling.  Its annoying but they do provide ear plugs in the bathroom which I thought was pretty smart.",1,,
21,Chrissina H.,"Gaithersburg, MD",0,1,0,5.0,12/14/2017,"Great hotel. Recently stayed there for a visit. I was not sure what to expect. However, must say how professional the staff was. Decor modern and beautiful. Best part,  it was clean as a whistle! You can really see how the staff/owner cares about ensuring guests are in a comfortable, clean environment. Room was bigger than I expected (especially for NY). Price was Great. I DONT usually take time to write reviews and usually am extremely picky, but had to take the time to recommend and compliment the staff. You won't be disappointed. Thanks for the great stay!!",,,
22,Vincent G.,"Englishtown, NJ",4,23,1,2.0,11/23/2017,"Close to everything. Came here because its proxcimity the the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade only about 4 blocks from Columbus Circle.  The hotel has no handicap accommodation (even at the front door you have to walk up the steps - no exceptions) and the king room is as big as a fart.  Watch your toes especially around the bed, it's a very tight squeeze. I don't know what the thermostat does except control the fan.  It's an old building and the rooms have been updated, I just expected a little more space.  I've had homes with bigger bathrooms than this entire room. TV is a small flat screen mounted on the wall but you can only watch it from one side of the bed. It's mounted in a corner facing away from the small desk. The staff is very accommodating and friendly and the hotel is very clean. Overall not a poor choice, I just expected a larger room.",,,

26,Doris U.,"San Leandro, CA",19,234,229,4.0,12/18/2016,"Overall it was a good stay. They have had an attendant in the front door 24 hours when I was there. That was great.  No ramp up the steps when pulling your bag. The rooms were okay. The lights are not so bright. The only request I would say is:Get rid of the snacks. I would never trust food that has been in the rooms, for I really don't know how long they were there, but more so, they were unhealthy snacks. Frig: I would've appreciated an empty frig so I can stock my water. Their frig was stocked up with other things I didn't need like beer/ soda.I would've added an extra star If there was a microwave too. Yes, I would come back. Location is great, close to time square.

Feeling extremely thankful and blessed!  Our hotel got a free upgrade to a junior suite. This hotel is beautiful,  modern,  close to Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music hall, shopping and entertainment. The  hotel rooms in New York are generally small so this junior suite feels like three rooms. On the 12th floor, noise level is pretty tolerable.",1,,
28,Ruben C.,"Warwick, NY",49,6,0,1.0,4/21/2017,"Upon checking in I was treated more like a problem, being abruptly told that my room wasn't ready and to just come back at 3. There was no hello how are you, no welcome, no thanks for staying, just very quick questions like I was a problem. The white woman next to me who was also checking in was greeted with a warm welcome, asked how she liked new york, and thanked for choosing the hotel. I am not sure if the rude greeting on my end was a result of not being a blonde white person and instead being a latino man with a latino guest. After arriving back at 3, I said I was told my room would be ready now and they asked for my credit card. I said I had already done that and was checking in earlier but the room wasn't ready. The man looked at my unconvinced and said ""IF...(with a strong if) that is the case than I will have to check your ID"" like I was lying. I understand this is protocol but the attitude was anything but friendly, and adding the if as if he was questioning if I was lying was uncalled for. He said he saw my reservation, asked how long I was staying and just handed me the envelope with the room keys. He didn't say what room it was, or floor, or to have a nice stay. He just handed me the keys and expected me to walk away. I had a ticket to pick up my stored bags and asked what I should do with them and he looked annoyed and said to go out to the entrance and tell the bellman. At the very same moment, the white family checking in next to me was asked by a different receptionist if they would like their bags sent to their room. How kind of them to offer such nice treatment. It was very unfortunate that they decided to treat me as a lesser guest without knowing anything about my background or economic status. If they had known they would not have treated me in such a way I guarantee that. I will not be staying at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to any of my friends or family. If every guest is staying and paid the price of the room, they should be treated equally. Don't assume who has money and who doesn't because you will be very surprised.  The only redeeming quality about this hotel is the fast elevators and unique decor of the room. The walk in shower in the bathroom is nice as well.",3,1,1
29,Nancy S.,"Long Hill, NJ",58,145,513,4.0,12/7/2016,"The Good: Beds were comfy, room was clean, staff was excellent, especially the front desk staff. Viktor was so kind and helpful as was everyone else. The parking garage was just across Broadway and very convenient to the hotel. Discounted rates through the hotel so make sure to get the parking ticket stamped. Great location!!!The Not so Good but overall fairly minor except for the AC: I arrived late, around 11:00 PM.  There is no ramp into the hotel so if you have a lot of luggage, you're going to have to carry it up three steps. Not easy if your luggage is very heavy. At that time there was no bellman. Check in was easy. Internet is $25.00 for three nights and it didn't work on certain websites such as Facebook. You have to pay for it through a third party website with your credit card. I decided to not use it after having connection issues and the hotel was kind enough to request a credit from the provider. I just had to show them my receipt. The lobby had free internet. I booked a queen room but when I got into the room in was very warm. I turned the AC on and it kept turning off. Someone came to fix it but couldn't get it working.  They switched me to a room on the 9th floor with a double bed but it was extremely small. There was only about 2 to 3 feet of space on either side of the bed I decided to stay in that room for the three days since I was going to be out most of the time. of course I asked for a price reduction due to the bed and size of the room. Despite the AC blowing cold air, it never got below 74ºF the entire time. I addressed the AC issue and was told they would send an engineer is to check it but found nothing wrong. Luckily I brought my fan with me so I was not too warm. I kept the window open (which had broken glass) most of the time even though there was a lot of street noise.  Even with the window closed I heard some street noise such as sirens and honking. There are no ice machines in the hotel and if you want ice, you have to ask someone at the front desk to get a bag for you.Despite the not so good points, I would stay here again. The service was excellent and the staff was so nice!",1,,

We had awesome service here, the door guys would hold the door for us walking out or walking in. There is in-room service as well.

There's usually always bellboys in the door to welcome you and help you with your luggage which was very helpful. Lobby and bar area was small but modern// up to date. The elevators were a little old and small. Rooms were tiny which wasn't a problem... You should expect small boutique rooms when traveling to NY unless u r looking to spend a lot of money. Bed was really comfy. The bathroom was very modern with a beautiful sink and shower. Favorite part was my hot showers with the waterfall shower head. Heater and cooler worked perfectly.Closet space with iron and plenty of hangers.The room didn't exactly feel extremely clean like previous hotels but it did the job. They have flat screen tv with few channels. View wasn't great, but you get what you pay for. 3 stars for the nice room. But I just wish they would provide guests with complimentary wifi.",4,,2

The reviews prepared us for small, but it turned out great!I uploaded a handful of photos of the room, hopefully they'll help put you at ease to. We took the red eye and arrived at the hotel around 9am. The front desk attendants were great at getting us checked in, we got the exact room we requested! They checked our bags with the bellman and we were off to enjoy the city!The king size bed was cozy, plenty of pillows, soft & clean sheets. There was a closet in our room that was plenty big for our winter coats and had a luggage stand. The bench under the TV had two drawers, which my hubby took advantage of. There was a desk covered in helpful info about the city, hotel and room service. There were plenty of outlets in the room (including in the lamps on both side tables), and the TV had plenty of channels. The only downside is the ventilation in the bathroom. The steam set off the fire alarm! It was December so we didn't leave the windows open. Also, the window in the bathroom is weighted to stay closed, it took both of us to push it open and then try to find something to prop it open.The only reason for 4 stars was that it was kind of loud. Our room faced West, towards the Three Monkeys and on Friday and Saturday night the pulsating music, voices and bottle clanging echoed into our room. In addition the doors aren't sound-proof :) We had more then one person on our floor return around 2am/3am talking, knocking on their hotel room door, laughing, etc that carried right into our room. I guess the alternative would have been a room on the street side, which could have been much louder. The sound wasn't horrible, but it did wake us up/keep us awake.We would definitely stay here again!",8,,1

We arrived early and our room was ready which was a bonus. They have free bag check service though, if the room isn't ready when you get here. The bell hop grabbed our bags from our driver immediately. That was nice. The woman at the front desk was courteous and helpful in recommending a quick place to grab a bite to eat. Is was a solid recommendation, too. The room Is clean and comfortable. Plenty of room for our luggage. The bathroom ROCKS! But the bed, oh my goodness! We have an amazing bed at home, but this one is even more comfortable. Sheets are clean. Down ( alternative) everything. Also, they are using a lovely fragrance here that's a bit exotic, yummy, the hubs and I both approve. Elevators are very quick as well. Off to dream land!

40,Jennifer L.,"San Jose, CA",189,111,272,4.0,6/19/2014,"Chose this hotel for our stay in Nyc because of the convenient location and somewhat good reviews. Great location. Hotel is literally right next to the David Letterman show and walking distance to Times Square and all that. Atmosphere very chic and modern boutique hotel.We got the room on the fifth floor with a pretty good city view! Expect loud cars honking if you're facing the city. Room was def a bit snug and you might have to maneuver your way around, but hey it was cozy and comfy to me! After all, it is a boutique hotel so smaller rooms are definitely a given. The bed was so comfy, plush, and soft. I could sleep in it all day! There was a huge full length mirror .. For me it was perfect for getting ready! Bathroom was full of bright lights, that's a plus. Shower head was amazing. It was one of those modern rain shower heads, I literally did not want to get out the shower. However, glass door did not extend all the way so it could get a little wet and messy! Hotel offered free water downstairs in the lobby instead of giving us free water bottles in our room which was an inconvenience to me. ESP after long nights of drinking and being dehydrated, having to go down for water was a bit awkward. Ice machine was on the first floor. Would of been better if it was on every floor. Aside from that, I enjoyed this hotel very much. Will def consider this hotel again next time I'm in nyc!",4,,1
41,Gabriela W.,"San Francisco, CA",13,56,137,5.0,12/18/2016,"Extremely impressed and we do not impress easily. Having stayed in hotels like the Ritz Carlton, the marquis in Dubai and five star resorts, I would rank the Ameritania as world class when it comes to service and experience. We decided to visit NYC for our anniversary and since it was the holiday season and my husband's first time in NYC I wanted it to be special. He found this little gem online and close to Times Square and 5th Ave so it was already ideal in location. Upon arrival, we noticed how clean and amazing the hotel smelled! (This is so important especially in the City) the doormen were super friendly and helpful. we were greeted extremely warmly by Gina at the reception counter.  She was fantastic! Immediately made me feel like she cared and was happy to have us stay at the hotel for our special occasion. She upgraded our room, treated us to a cocktail at the bar and said she has a little surprise for us in our room. She asked us about our plans and was incredibly helpful in helping us navigate ourselves through the city. She brought out the city map and showed us the best places to try, best routes to take and even about little gems to try out! She was wonderful! We got to our room and it was clean, spacious and a corner view! We were delighted. After settling in, we noticed a card and bottle of champagne from Gina and the staff that was on ice on the desk. What a thoughtful gift! We then went down to the bar to enjoy our complimentary drink to start the evening. We met Javier! He was awesome!! He definitely, like Gina made us feel so welcomed and treated us like VIP! He made delicious drinks, gave us great places to visit and he too told us of gems (not touristy but where the locals go) to try. His drinks definitely helped us to brace for the cold weather and start our trip off right! Javier was a delight, so much that we came back after exploring to enjoy a few more drinks that evening. With so many options in the city, this is our pick for hotel, guest experience, cleanliness, professionalism and overall quality. Will return! See you in the Spring! Thank you for for being part of our amazing trip to NYC you definitely added to it!",1,,

Updated review","Stayed a 2nd  time because I got such a great deal hotels tonight. The room was smaller than the first but I knew what to expect. The room was a lot quieter than the last one and was not facing Broadway. I did not have to use the complimentary earplugs. Unfortunately, the bathroom was extremely small and I had trouble turning the lights on. The switch was extremely hard to work and needed to be jiggled. I do like this hotel because the beds are so comfortable and it's a great location to my job. I would give it more stars but the little problems at this hotel need to be addressed.",,,
43,Holly R.,"Los Angeles, CA",12,11,3,1.0,7/5/2016,"Misleading photos! The room was so small we couldn't fit our suitcases in the room! I know NYC hotel rooms are small, but this was so small you couldn't even open the door. Then they would not refund our money when we asked to go elsewhere! Do NOT stay here!! Not the way you want to start off any trip, after a 5 hr plane ride. AND it was almost 200 a night!!!! Horrible customer service!",1,3,
44,Wendy N.,"Chicago, IL",0,20,0,1.0,7/31/2016,"I do not agree that the location is great unless you are a tourist and do not know any better. The street is noisy and dirty and congested with tourists. The hotel staff was not very polite, would not give me an umbrella on a rainy day, open the door though that's what doormen are supposed to do, and my room was dingy and not very clean...dirt in corners and the hotel decor was eye catching but not in a good way more in a Beetlejuice Reminscent way. The wifi is free because it does not work well.I was supposed to stay 2 nights but checked out after one and moved to another hotel...so if you are from Eastern Europe and have never been to NYC, then sure this hotel may seem ok but if you have any other options I would suggest going somewhere else.",1,1,
45,Marley G.,"Braddock, PA",19,1,0,5.0,8/16/2016,"We had a great stay here. The room was small but fit two of us and one large suitcase fine. The hotel shower was awesome!! Staff was very friendly and even the doormen gave you a hello and a smile. Housekeeping did seem to have a weird schedule, we never saw anyone around on our floor until around 11am-3pm. There was no noise keeping us awake at night though the AC unit is a bit noisy. This hotel is one block from the metro and a short walk to the center of Times Square (even though it seemed like forever since it was so hot out). We'd definitely stay here again!",1,,

It was incredibly affordable for such a great location, I was surprised at just how cheap it was. The room was nice, the bed was comfortable and everything was very clean. There was plenty of room for our one night stay and there was absolutely nothing to complain about.The lobby is pretty nice and we enjoyed sitting by the fireplace while we were figuring out what to do before heading to our play. The check in and check out process was a breeze and all of the employees were pleasant to deal with. Will definitely be staying there again!",1,,1
47,Julie C.,"Buffalo, NY",98,445,9,1.0,6/1/2013,This place absolutely sucked.  Stayed here with my daughter and got the most god awful room known to man. Asked for a rehome and got another room where you could not sit on the toilet without swinging sideways...and hoping for the best.Showers....I think not. Little closets that had no devices to retain water within the shower. Room had no TV or phone.  Travelling with a kid...come on.  Bitched about the issue and was given a free night!  Which I have been unable to redeem.,1,2,

49,Nina C.,"Central Islip, NY",155,441,983,3.0,1/6/2013,"I stayed here a couple days during the holidays for New Years. It was a nice hotel. I was expecting the worst because of the rates it got on here compared to others, but I give it a 3.. It was a decent place, staff was prompt when called for service, and location is a good walking distance to Times Square.Ameritania has a very modern style to it, different - I like. The elevators are very slow. We stayed on the 10th floor, taking the stairs would have been much quicker. The parking garage they use which is $30/day is on the same street as the hotel.The room was a decent size. It was the only room with a balcony you could crawl through the window and stand on. Pretty awesome! The room also included a fridge, which was packed with goodies you couldn't fit anything in there. So don't expect to put doggie bags in the fridge.The bathroom doesn't have a lock on the door. The shower head was attached to the ceiling so the water came straight down, with a hose attachment. Also, the room provided a blow dryer. Resting, I'm not a fan of pillows you suffocate in because they're too soft. Which is the type of pillows they had. It was so uncomfortable for me.They had a big flatscreen TV, which was nice. But another negative, you could hear conversation from the room into the hallway very, very easily.I may possibly stay here again, but I'm not sure - little negatives add up. So, I might try a new hotel next time.",1,,
50,Crystal D.,"Arlington, VA",21,34,13,4.0,11/17/2013,"I stayed at this hotel during fashion week in September. I arrived early and was able to get into my room. The rooms are average size but packed with contemporary and modern furnishings. It is a really nice boutique hotel that is moderately priced. The only think that seemed odd is that you have to have your room key in a holder on the wall in order for the electricity to work in the room. Other than that, everything was great!",,,
51,Heather C.,"San Diego, CA",0,16,0,2.0,7/26/2014,"For $230 a night I expected a lot better than we received.  The only saving grace was the professionalism and friendliness of the staff.  Otherwise, this is probably one of the worst hotels I've stayed in.1.  Our light electrical system was somehow attached to our air conditioning system so anytime our air conditioning came on our lights flickered.  Our lights flickered constantly - even when we turned the air conditioning off.2.  They don't have cable TV - only antenna so the quality was grainy and skipped constantly.3.  There is no noise insulation and this hotel is on a busy road so be prepared to be woken up multiple times a night from car horns, police sirens, etc.  Like I said, if this place were cheaper it might be worth it, but at $230 a night?  Nope.",3,,

53,Christy L.,"Chicago, IL",47,35,47,2.0,1/12/2014,"Lobby looks cool, location is great. Thus a few stars.However...First they game me keys to a room that was already occupied. I walked in to an older foreign couple sitting on the bed. SuPER AWKWARD.Next they gave me a new room, but when I tried the key it didn't work so I had to go back down to the lobby for a new set.When I finally got in the room the AC was off, and as a result to room was super cold (60 degrees) - it's January now. I tried to change the temperature, but one of the rubber toggle buttons was missing so I had to shove a pencil in the hole where the button was supposed to be to toggle the temperature , praying the whole time I don't get electrocuted.And that was all in just the first 15min after arriving. The staff was nice and apologetic, but I'd rather just have things right the first time. Sorry, a free breakfast won't erase the memory of walking in to that very occupied room!",6,4,1
54,Way T.,"Farmington, NM",24,3,0,5.0,2/6/2017,"The Ameritania was excellent! The beds are so comfortable and the location couldn't be better. Its between Times Square and Central Park with subway stations surrounding you. The rooms are small by most standards but fairly typical by NYC standards. Regardless if the small space they are well decorated and modern. The staff are very polite and eager to help. Marcus at checkin was our hero! We were exhausted and he got us into a room early. Julianne at the door was so friendly and fun. He never missed a beat and was always smiling and helpful. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Ameritania and recommend it highly. My only complaint is the housekeeping staff was extremely loud, slamming doors repeatedly in the hall. It was annoying on days when I wanted to sleep late and felt discourteous coming from the hotel staff, but everyone else made up for it.",,,
55,Greg P.,"San Mateo, CA",114,19,10,1.0,12/12/2015,"When I first arrived to the Ameritania Hotel, it was approximately 12pm. My wife called, and the receptionist at the front desk said that I could check in at 10am. I thought that was a little early, but I arrived at 12pm anyways. The female at the front desk was very cold...no smile, no greeting, nothing. I asked her if I could check in, and she said that the room was still being worked on, but that it should be ready by 1pm.I waited in the front lobby and asked for the WIFI access. The female at the front desk said in a rude manner ""You have to pay for it. It's not free. It says it right on our website.""First off, I clearly misread that on your site. Secondly, why would you charge your guests for WIFI access? Do you not charge enough for the rooms to warrant a courtesy access to WIFI?Anyways, so I waited in the front lobby, and went back to the desk at 1pm. The female receptionist said the room was still being worked on. So I waited...and waited...and waited.No apologies or anything. I checked back at 130pm. Still not ready. I checked back at 2pm, still not ready!Finally at 205pm, I was told the room was ready. No sorry...no compensation for me having to wait for 2 hours in the front lobby. Nothing!I wanted to cancel my reservations and go elsewhere, but I knew that there was probably nothing available nearby, so I stuck it out.Needless to say, I will never stay at the Ameritania Hotel ever again, and will definitely not recommend it to anyone!",1,,

57,Steve E.,"Belmar, NJ",0,23,1,1.0,10/18/2015,"I booked this hotel through Hotwire, where I have always had good luck. That streak is broken.Everything about my stay was underwhelming. I walked by the entrance twice: the awning over the entrance consisted of unfinished sheets of plywood -- with no identification of the hotel.The room was tiny (which I expected), but the hotel does nothing to make tiny feel cozy. There were no face cloths in the bath room, the bath towels felt threadbare and the view felt like I was inside of a jail cell. The final sign of ""we are doing everything on the cheap"" was that instead of a logo'd pen on the nite table...there was a Ticonderoga pencil.The worst part of my stay was the check-in process. The desk clerk appeared disinterested at best, antagonistic at worst. As he was confirming details of my stay, he advised that this is a no-smoking facility and that violation of that rule would result in a $250.00 charge on my credit card. He then repeated that if I violated the no-smoking policy...they would charge my credit card $250.00.I then had to accept that warning on the check-in pad.It was enough to make me take up smoking.Moral of the story: you get what you pay for and, sometimes as at The Ameritania Hotel, you get less than that.",1,,
58,Shane E.,"San Francisco, CA",0,14,8,4.0,9/9/2013,"The Ameritania is a very decent NYC hotel in a great location.  I stayed in Room 608 for 5 nights which is a Deluxe King.  While small by typical hotel standards, the size is quite large given that it's in NYC.  Check-in took about 30 seconds which was shocking.  I had no issues getting around the room, the bathroom, or the air conditioning.  The large flat screen TV was nice but I only turned it on once (too much to do in NYC).  Do note that the Deluxe King on their website is a corner room with two windows.  Mine was not on the corner and only had one window, not a big deal though.  There was construction across the street (new building going up), but I've lived in large cities most of my adult life so it didn't bother me much.The bathroom was spacious and the waterfall showerhead was pretty cool.  They even provided nicely scented shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and lotion in large containers (larger than any hotel I've stayed in).  Just try not to get water all over the floor since there wasn't a closing door to the shower (modern styling I guess).While they provide a nice looking ice bucket there is apparently only one ice machine on the first floor, which I called the front desk for.  I avoided getting ice after the first night but the gentleman bringing it up was prompt and very nice about the situation.I believe they'll loan you a mini fridge for a cost but you can always do what I did (don't tell...): take out some items already in the fridge and replace with your leftovers or grocery store purchases.  Don't expect to put anything large in there though, and remember to put everything back in before they clean the room...  It's an old style mini fridge so there aren't any sensors to indicate missing items, and it's not designed to prevent you from rearranging the contents like some hotels I've stayed in.  So I'm frugal, sue me...The lighting in the room was a bit dim at night but not really a big deal.  And the floor to ceiling mirror leaning against the wall was pretty rockin'.  Good for checking out your outfit, ensuring there's nothing in your teeth, or other things I'm sure you can imagine.Upon checkout the lady at the front desk indicated my room had a continental breakfast charged to it.  I didn't even know they served food here, but she promptly took it off my account after explaining I didn't eat at the hotel.Overall a very nice experience.  A decent price for what you get, but not the lap of luxury.  I received from this hotel what I expected to get.  I would stay here again.",3,1,

This hotel is great ; the only thing is the wifi isnt free and the $9.95 ""all you can eat continental breakfast"" is just some croissants, buscuits, fruit, cereal and hard boiled eggs.

Received complimentary upgrade and room was ready at check-in. Great. Room had nice interior design. Left room at about 9:30am first morning there, and came back to room at 4pm-5pm... The room had not been serviced. Called housekeeping, no answer... Called guest services and they blamed lack of HK service on busy AM with lots of check outs. No apology from guest services. Also WiFi was not complimentary. Really? It's 2015. I can get free WiFi in grocery stores but not a NYC hotel? Elevators needed maintenance. If you can get this hotel for under $200 a night, go for it... I wouldn't spend any more than that.",,,
61,Jennifer B.,"Nashville, TN",103,13,0,5.0,12/6/2016,"The hotel's best feature is the location. It's walkable to so many attractions. Its close enough to Times Square for a quick walk down there but far enough away to where you aren't surrounded by the bedlam and noise of that tourist trap. The show we saw, Wicked, is just a few minutes walk away and we enjoyed walking to Rockefeller plaza, Central Park, and the many, many other walkable sites, museums and places of interest. The interior of the hotel is really fun and modern. The service was great! We were upgraded to a two bedroom room upon arrival and were able to check in super early. They also arranged a flat rate ride to the Airport for our departure. Our room was very spacious and we loved the decor. The view was great. The noise level is high bc you're in the city that never sleeps so play some white noise from your phone for sleep! The beds were super comfy and no gross uncovered comforters (germaphobe here). The pillow cases could stand to be a bit longer as the tips of my pillows peeked out (germaphobe again) but it was a minor flaw. Our window had a crack in it that was sealed up with tape. This was the most major flaw. Obviously that needs to be fixed in our room. Also some lamp shades looked a little worn and the desk chair was also worn. The bathroom was fantastic and the shower was lovely. All in all it was a great experience and the staff should be commended for their courtesy & helpfulness. Even the hotel's handyman( ?) who we met in the elevator a few times was super friendly and kind. Thanks for making our visit so wonderful!!! :) Would def. stay here again",,,

I love that there were 3 elevators so we never had to wait to get up to/from our room. One thing I thought was maybe the sign on the side of the building could be more obvious? but maybe it's nice that it's on the down low, too...

63,Michael H.,"Miami, FL",46,23,168,4.0,3/21/2013,"I love this hotel!  Got a standard room and was pleasantly surprised.  Almost everything about the room was perfect - modern furnishings (nice curtain, beautiful clock on one wall, 9-10 foot mirror leaned against another, textured wallpaper, 40"" flatscreen TV, comfortable bed with a tufted leather headboard), a clean bathroom with a walk-in shower, a closet with a safe, plenty of space, and an affordable price (costed me $125 for a weeknight).Cons  Noisy.  My room was on the fourth floor facing northeast overlooking 54th and Broadway.  I'm guessing no acoustic insulation.  Prohibitively expensive snack/convenience tray.  Resist the temptation -- a regular size Snickers candy bar will set you back $7.  Other items on the tray include a phone charger (two separate kits -- one contains the USB wall adapters, and the other contains the 12-in-1 USB cable. each kit costs $15, total $30), an intimacy kit (lube, mini vibrator, and two condoms for $38), a Go Smile Kit (two small tubes of ""luxury"" toothpaste and a travel size toothbrush for $17), and a universal AC-to-DC wall adapter ($28).  Somewhat dull lighting, except in the bathroom.  No desk (there is enough space to allow for a small one).Other Thoughts  The hotel is right next to the Ed Sullivan Theater, home of the Late Show with David Letterman.  Central Park is just five blocks uptown.",5,1,4

I'm from Hawaii and I've never experienced that typed of topnotch service. He was amazing, friendly and he made the best drinks ever!!

Never noticed it, righ at the corner of 54th and Broadway. Easy to get to, easy to get to trains, and easy to walk two miles through the park to the Whitney for the biennial, if you're so inclined. Rooms a bit on the small side, with lighting a bit on the shady side, and AC a bit on the noisy side. That said, plenty of plusses. Styplish lobby. Nice doormen.  Continental breakfast in a clean, well-lighted room (though hard to tell how long this will last).  And the price via hotels.com was kind of unbeatable.  Worth a whirl.",,1,
66,Xue H.,"San Francisco, CA",182,292,304,2.0,9/9/2013,"Lounge/rooms are pretty stylish, but smaller than hotels in this price range.We got a nonsmoking 2 bed deluxe room.==============================================Negatives: 1) No coffee/tea etc amenities (not that I really use them), just a tray with a bunch of junk food and snacks marked up 400%+ We wanted it out of our way but didn't know where to put it so that the people checking wouldn't get confused and thought we used the whole thing.1.5) There is no vending machine anywhere (though there are convenience stores very close by).2) Internet is PER DEVICE and $25 (for 3 days).  And quite slow (sometimes faster to browse on phone).3) The desk chair was pushed right up to the first bed. If you're a normal sized person, this would be a squeeze (I was okay with it, but it could've been better spaced). Perhaps just our room.4) The lighting is not good. You have to have your room key (or some other key...shhh) in the slot to even turn it on (AC too I think). It is pretty damn dim, even with the window open (also since the window doesn't really shed light on anything except the bottom of the second bed).The only good lighting is in the bathroom, as the whole mirror lights up (but then it's a bit unrealistic to have that perfect lighting all the time, argh)5) The shower is one of those 'rain' style ones. This made it difficult to shower without getting my hair wet, but I guess that's the style. It had no pressure and made me really sad. Hotel showers are one of the things I look forward to. The towels weren't as generous as other hotels, but housekeeping can always replenish.6) TV was super dim/kinda fuzzy (I guess like the whole room). It was not very pleasant to watch for long periods.7) The housekeepers were really nice and hardworking. However make SURE you put the DnD on your door or else they will sometimes come hella early and disrupt your sleep...several times!! Once for housekeeping, and right as you fall asleep again, they come to check the minibar (is what I'm guessing).  Another time, they came, turned on the lights, realized we were still sleeping, then ran off WITH THE LIGHTS STILL ON. WTF. Ugh. I don't think it's much of a unique situation for them, so I feel like turning them off again would be an automatic reaction.==============================================Indifference:1) Elevator is a bit weirdly placed. There are several elevators and the most common one that comes down is a bit behind the others so when it arrives you can't actually see it and stand there dazed before realization.2) Hallways are stuffy and eh. Stairwells are a bit unslightly, lol. 3) for some reason I was quite cold in the room most of the time and it didn't seem like the temperature reading was correct, so maybe it's good for you if you like your AC way up.4) Maybe it was just our room. The view was bad (we checked in early so we didn't get the best room, but still). The window was small and looked dirty, facing the back alley and more dirtiness (2nd floor). I don't really care about this though. Also the bathroom window looked like the glass broke and was patched up. *Shrug*==============================================Positives: 1) It has pretty good blackout curtains. We just remained blacked out the whole time.2) pretty stylish and clean!3) We had no fridge by default, though their website says they do. They brought one in for us.4) They have nice cucumber or lemon water in the lounge, and the doormen are nice...For the price, no, unless you can book it fairly cheap.",1,,
67,Tracy F.,"Carson, CA",0,2,1,3.0,7/26/2015,"A friend of mine travelled from California to New York for a weekend trip of site-seeing & to see a Broadway play. The rooms at Ameritania are TINY but I guess this is typical of a New York hotel. As soon as we opened the door to a room, we almost tripped on the bed. There's a tiny closet. We were told that there's a complimentary breakfast with coffee for $11 - not sure what that meant. Also there's no free wifi. The next day upon trying to blow dry our hair, the power went out. We called guest services, they told us sometimes when guests use their personal hair dryer that this happens. It took them about 10-15 mins to get the power back on in our room. The following day, we used the hotel's hairdryer & the power went out twice! This time when we called guest services,  they were able to restore the power almost immediately. This was a good thing - I guess the knew where the breaker switch was. Not sure if other guests experienced this. Beware of the atheism door, if you close the bathroom door all the way, you run the risk of getting stuck in the bathroom like we each did. Aside from these instances, the hotel is ok for a quick getaway. If you're planning to stay in New York for longer, you may want to get a bigger room. The staff however were great.

70,Olivia L.,"Oakland, CA",173,11,5,4.0,9/7/2013,"I had booked this hotel for a week long trip, including Labor Day weekend. We booked through Priceline's express deals for midtown west with a fitness center as its main amenity. I was able to book for an average of ~168$/night. I'd describe the area as the intersection between TS, Hell's Kitchen and midtown west AKA amazing.With the previous reviews from over 6 months+ ago, I was a little apprehensive. But as we walked over from the subway 2 blocks away we were pleasantly surprised. It's a typical NYC building from the outside, but a chic boutique interior. As we were staying a week, they were very gracious and upgraded us for free to a larger high-level room. (Although, I think part of this was because 1: we were staying a week, 2: they ran out of single bed rooms over Labor Day. Regardless, the room was significantly larger than anything we'd expect from NYC.)Overall, the room was spacious, clean, and modern. There were some aspects that could be better (dirty grout, faulty faucet halfway through our stay, sometimes didn't answer when we called) but nothing that really impaired our stay.

I was upgraded to a suite and had a ton of room. Bed is amazingly comfortable. The hotel bar is very cozy and Javier is just the most pleasant and discreet bar manager and makes the best of the best Cosmos! The only thing keeping me from rating it any higher is that the doors to the rooms are super thin and do not seem to provide the level of security that I am accustomed to in a hotel. I also heard a ton of loud street noise, but obviously to be expected in a city hotel on a lower floor. But still, I am a fan.",,,
73,Harrison E.,"New York, NY",84,222,16,5.0,6/11/2013,"This place has changed tremendously in the last decade. Completely renovated. The rooms are small, but all rooms in NYC are small. You're not here to live in a room; go out and enjoy the center of the universe: New York City. Great little lounge off to the side of the lobby. Javier, the bartender will treat you right as he has been here for over 10 years. Great music, conversation, clean; a great bar to pre-game or for a night cap.",1,,

You can definitely walk to shopping , food, and broadway shows from the location. Had tickets to the Wicked show and it was a two block walk. Booked thru Priceline at a steal now that I've seen the location. The staff was friendly but can be a bit better on communicating. I got different answers from the front desk depending on who I talked to. Aside from that the bell boy was nice. Knew we couldn't get an early check in so offered to keep our luggage stored till the room opened up.Room is a bit small and the bathroom door did not close. Maybe the wood frame shifted but it'd close half and get stuck. Very small room. Lobby looks better in pictures. Fix this place up a little more and I'd be willing to pay more for the stay.Edit: Left a phone charger plugged in, checked out, and left for the airport. After I got off my flight (4 hours later) called and the front desk had me e-mail them room info and what was lost. Got a reply in 5 minutes asking for a credit card to charge the shipping and if I wanted cheapest/fastest delivery. Great customer service. I've had this same incident happen in Vegas once, where I called just 1 hour after check out. Took over a day to reply to me and said sorry, out of luck.",2,1,1

The lobby is kind of corny...it calls to mind the Oops I Did it Again video. Watch your step as you're entering the elevator, the ground slopes up or down, I forget. The room was pretty nice. Spacious, clean, super comfortable beds, bathroom was pretty big and had great lighting (important for when you are getting ready to have a girl's night), and a huge mirror on the wall (always importannt for GNO).

78,Joy T.,"Marina del Rey, CA",98,33,1,2.0,2/28/2015,"I've never reviewed a place while I was actually still there, but I felt the need to post this review now, since I am quite disappointed in the hotel. It is in a great location, and the price is decent and the king bed room has a somewhat comfy bed, but that's all I've enjoyed about the hotel thus far.There is only ONE plug socket in the actual room. I had to ask for an extension cord to run from the other socket in the bathroom into the actual room. When the cord got to my room, since I didn't open the door within a millisecond of the knock, they just used the key to open my door. Same thing with housekeeping...I guess they had to put more towels in that they didn't have before I checked in, and when I didn't answer the door within a second, housekeeping just opened the door. Seriously? There is only one ice machine, and it is somewhere in the lobby. The front desk said they'd send some up....room service brought me ice in such a huge bag that I had to put the rest of it in the shower. Now I have a bag of water sitting in my shower that I have to dump out. The elevator is an issue. I was going up to the 10th floor...someone else got in that was going to the 5th floor. When he got off, all the elevator did was open and close and open and close until I finally jumped off on the 5th floor. Every time I pressed the button in the hallway, the demon elevator would open again. I had to wait to hear it finally move down to hit the button again. The front doors are also an issue. The people walking in front of me pushed the door open with force, which then made it swing all the way back to the point that I had to jump out of the way to avoid getting pummeled by the door. I stayed at the sister location (The Moderne) a couple year ago and had such a lovely experience I thought I would try this hotel and have the same experience...I AM NOT HAVING NEARLY the same experience at all. Although the price for this hotel was in the right price point for this weekend, I have seen it listed for much higher at certain times, and if I had paid more for this weekend I would be LIVID right now. The walls are paper thin....I was woken up this morning by the people in the next room talking outside of their door. If you are looking for a place to keep your stuff and you won't actually be in the room or hotel or for very long then sure...definitely stay here as it is in a good location for tourists, but if you have to spend any amount of time in your hotel, I recommend looking elsewhere. I am not having a pleasant experience at all. I am glad I am only here for 2 nights......",,,1
79,Ms P.,"Dallas, TX",7,168,14,4.0,12/16/2015,"This a nicely decorated hotel, very modern look. The location is so convenient, everything you need is around here. I got the room at a great price. Although the rooms are small, smallest out of all the hotels in NYC I've stayed in, it wasn't too bad for just me. 2 people might feel too tight. I got somewhat a corner room so I didn't hear any neighbors! Maybe their walls are thick overall. This is why I gave them an extra star. All the other NYC hotels have paper thin walls!! I hate hearing people have conversations. They also brought me towels super quick, great service. The only dislikes I had was the bathroom was like a half step up, you can hit your foot if you don't remember. Also, the corner of the bed I kept hitting my foot as well. When I got use to things being there, it was fine.",1,,
80,James D.,"Leesburg, VA",0,10,0,4.0,11/18/2013,"I got what I assume to be a fairly good deal at only $245 for one night for the two double bed room. That's a plus considering the hotel, and more importantly the room itself, was extremely clean. Price/location/and cleanliness are my three biggest concerns in NYC and Ameritania passed each very well. I'd consider staying again if I plan on only sleeping in the room.For those looking to spend a lot of time in their room or longer trips, I would probably not recommend. The room I stayed in (1218) was very small and the closet was radiating heat at about 90 degrees. We had the A/C on full power for 24 hours and the room never cooled below 82. One side of the room near the A/C and window you could see your breath, but the other (b/c of the heat coming from something running through the walls of the closet) was at about 85-90. The lighting was pretty poor as well in the bedroom and really needed to go to the bathroom for proper lighting.If I got the same deal again I would stay, though I wouldn't pay too much more (up to $300 I suppose) and I would make sure the room temperature was more under control. If you're in the city and plan to sightsee and be out most of the time, you really can't go wrong here.",,,

Was a little nervous at first because of the pictures on this yelp page, but really it's not that bad. My sink was not that disgusting and was in fact pretty nice. Pros: - LOCATION. So close to Times Square, 5th Ave, Rockefeller center, central park, the 6th st. halal truck, and subway stations. - While I didn't get it, the front desk person technically offered me a 'possible upgrade' after I had asked for one. You just have to go downstairs and try to change your room before 11 AM the day of. I didn't make it then.- It's a neat little retro place. Cons:- Tiny tiny place! You won't be able to do your P90X workout here, sorry.- No fridge, microwave, nor free internet.- In fact there were no amenities at all... coffee and tea would have been nice...- They don't replace your toiletries or towels everyday- It did look clean, but (maybe because it was an old building) not clean enough to feel completely comfortable in.",2,,

85,Cheyenne C.,"Ventura County, CA",2,23,0,5.0,8/7/2013,"For my very first trip to NYC, I picked The Ameritania on W. 54th Street because of the great reviews on Orbitz, the swanky photos and especially the great combo price with the airfare. When I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by a friendly doorman (his name is Javier who also bartends at their bar lounge on certain evenings).The hotel lobby is modern, art deco swanky and gorgeous. The room that I got is swanky as well, but a tad bit small.  Nevertheless, I still love the hotel for it's close proximity to the broadway theaters, Times Square, The Rockefeller Center, The Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, Hell's Kitchen, 5th Avenue shopping, MOMA and Central Park.  I stayed at the Ameritania for 11 days and each day was memorable and comfortable. The entire staff has been very friendly and helpful, especially Hugo, one of the doormen.  On my last day, I asked Hugo to please hail a taxi for me and instead, he ordered a limo for the same flat fee of $45 to the airport as what a taxi would charge me as well!   So there it is...on my last day, I asked for a taxi and got a limo!  I left NYC in style!! Overall, I received great quality and customer service for a great price through Orbitz! I will most definitely stay at The Ameritania again whenever I return to NYC!!Pros:- Friendly and helpful staff (housekeeping and administration)- Beautifully decorated rooms- Great price (through Orbitz)- Free Wi-fi- Flat screen TV with free cable TV- A work-out/gym room Cons:- Small room- I wish the work-out /gym room was not in the basement w/only 1 elevator access.  It felt a little claustrophobic and slightly creepy being down there.

87,Sonny G.,"Malba, Queens, NY",2351,420,1223,3.0,10/23/2011,"This hotel was weird. First off I think when we stayed either the floor we were on or the hotel itself was being renovated or possibly just opening up because our room seemed to be the only room on that floor that was finished.  There was no heat. It was freezing.  The hotel provided us with a portable heater for the night. Even though the room was new (I believe we were the first ones in that room) the decor had this really tacky old school touch. Like it wasn't even an antique look, it was more like a left over look that needed revamping. On the flipside the lobby was very modern and trendy-- a great spot to grab a few drinks.  Another positive thing about this hotel is that it' s located directly next too my two favorite spots: 3 monkeys and Iguanas . The view of the city  was pretty cool I guess I mean it the hotel is right in the heart of times square and no more then a few blocks away from central park.  If your looking to crash in the city, in a nothing prestigous or luxurious, but rather just to sleep and shower then this place is fine for you.  Don't expect anything special.",1,,

89,Marlon G.,"San Francisco, CA",15,8,4,3.0,12/27/2011,"This shouldn't be interpreted as a negative review.  I had low expectations prior to getting there and while the Ameritania didn't exceed them, they also didn't go below my tolerance threshold.  While I typically take the pilot seat in booking getaways with the better half, I let her take the seat this time.  My only concern was cleanliness, to which I couldn't find any constructive criticism regarding this hotel.The Acceptable - There was no construction going on while we were there over the Christmas weekend.  As mentioned in other reviews, the room was small and looked like it had been recently renovated.  I believe we had the standard room (main room roughly 15ft x 35ft).  The bathroom and shower all looked new and was very clean.  There was a closet that left plenty of room to place bags, large coats, etc.Areas of Improvement - The hallway smelled like my great-grandmothers old house (slightly mildewy).  The carpet was also a bit sketch (black and yellow).  The decor of the room felt like it could be the ""office"" of a ""working girl"" in a 70's interpretation of the 21st Century.  That is all...For the gentlemen that are looking to impress their significant other, I would not recommend this place.  However, if you are simply looking for a place to crash that is walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, 5th Ave., Hell's Kitchen, etc. (the list goes on - hell it's New York!), then this isn't a bad place.",1,,

Upon check in I was told I was getting a room upgrade from a full to king size bed. I do not believe they even have any full size beds because a lot of other yelpers seem to have said the same thing and I really hope there is not anything worse than the room we stayed in. Looking out the windows there is nothing but a brick wall maybe five feet away. The bar next door which is open til 4 am plays crazy loud music all night long leaving you no choice to get a good nights rest. Room service messed up my order and argued with me over it, eventually knocking on my door without warning at 1 in the morning requiring that I give them back the food without any guarantee of a refund until they spoke to someone in the morning about it. Finally after falling asleep close to 4 am when the bar shut down I was abruptly awaken at 9:30 am by the hotel room cleaner walking into my room. This was a huge mistake considering we never heard a knock, and also we had only stayed one night and there should have never been anyone trying to clean our room until we checked out. At first I was only offered a later check out time, which I declined, and told the manager I would be calling hotels.com for a refund. She then offered to give me half off the price of my stay, but again I denied letting her know I would take it up with hotels.com for my full refund.

NOT worth $10 when i can go to Pie Face and purchase their food for $10.Wifi is NOT free.The rooms are small, some much smaller than others.My first room was on the 6th floor with large windows facing three bars next door.  This made for a LOUD evening.  The bathroom light switch was malfunctioning so often i either couldn't turn it on, or i couldn't turn it off.  Additionally, the remote control would turn the t.v. on, but you were not able to switch channels without manually inputting the numbers in the remote.  The ""guide"" on the t.v. didn't work either.The next morning I requested a room change so i could sleep better.  They said no problem.  The second room, which i wasn't able to get until about 5pm that night, was TINY.  It was facing Broadway so I still had lot of honking and street noise.  Take earplugs if you stay at this hotel.The rooms were CLEAN and fashionably updated.",,1,

Now I know that NY hotel rooms are small but this was place was ridiculous!  Very spartan living: no microwave, no fridge, small TV that had limited channels (half the channels weren't clear, some channels had no audio) and a bathroom fit for only children.On either side of the bed, there was maybe two feet of free space. In the bathroom, the toilet was right in front of the wall, literally!  I'm 6'0"" and when I sat down on the toilet, I would have to sit almost straight up or I'd hit my head on the wall in front of me.  Having to do my ""business"" was an act of contortion-ism and creativity.  The shower was MAYBE a 3 x 3 footer with no door but rather a shower curtain that left about an inch gap from the floor which left water spilling onto the bathroom floor.  My girlfriend complained about the dim lighting in the bathroom as well as the main room.  The bed was fine, not too soft and not too stiff.The lobby looks updated however the rest of the hotel shows its age.  The two elevators are super slow which is a problem if you are trying to get ice (only ONE ice machine, on the 11th floor of all places).  The hallways are dimly lit which doesn't create a spooky look so much as it does a dumpy look.  The hotel advertises free wireless internet but I didn't see it on my wireless list. On our last night there (exactly one week after our check-in), our room key didn't work.  Being tired from a long night and waiting for the long elevator, getting to the room and having the key not work was NOT fun.  So we went back to the lobby and our friends whom we traveled with were there too, with the same problem.  The front desk person was both indifferent and unapologetic.  He said that their systems will automatically render keys useless after a week and that they needed to ""renew"" them.  Huh...I've never had that at any hotels I've been to.  BS...As for the hotel itself, about the only thing it has going for it is that it is in a convenient location on 54th and Broadway (around the corner on Broadway is where the David Letterman show is taped).  Times Square is only a few blocks away and there are subway stations a block down and on the backside of the hotel is a Duane Reade.  We would NOT stay here again nor recommend it to anyone.  During our last trip to NY, we stayed at the Belvedere and had a much better stay (comparable price for a room that included a microwave, fridge, safe, and a much bigger room).  Two stars because it was safe, clean and in a good location.",4,,1

We didn't spend much time in our room but it made circulating around the room or even to and from the bathroom an exercise in logistics for my wife and I. The recent renovation design was nice. Much different from the photos here on Yelp. The shower was like warm at best, more like COLD. The A/C didn't work and only provided warm air. The widows did open so we used that when the room got too warm. We had an inside room that looked across the courtyard. The opposite rooms are very close so keeping the draperies closed was a must.

Overall, 4 stars - can't give it 5 stars because of the construction.  And, I've stayed in some nice places including the Sheraton and the DoubleTree in Time Square - I remember saying - why waste my money on these hotel rooms, I'm never in them as there is way too much to do in NYC!!!!  I will go back to this little find.",,,
103,Liane J.,"St Petersburg, FL",110,49,9,4.0,7/1/2012,"We stayed for 6 nights while in NYC.  The hotel has been newly remodeled and has a very chic look.  The rooms were small-ish but what else is new in NYC, I've stayed in plenty smaller.  Plenty of room to put a suitcase down in front of the bed, nice flat screen TV on the wall.  The only little thing that bugged me is they constantly only gave us 2 towels in the room, and we kept having to ask for more.  I wish they'd just notate our room to give us more daily during our stay.  The concierge was great, helped us arrange transportation several times.  Overall a great stay.",1,,
104,Ross B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,35,0,1.0,3/15/2012,"POS. People shouldn't be allowed to make hotels like this. Room was probably 8' x 10'. No soap in the room. Asked for soap, was brought two more bottles of lotion...not sure how bottles of lotion can be mistaken for BARS OF SOAP.Grainy TV signal.NO SHOWER DOOR, though it did have a waterfall shower head which might have negated some of the splashing...Ditto to the reviewer that said the hallways smelled old and musty. The elevator carpet is stained to high heaven.I paid the same price for a room at 60 Thompson two days ago. WTFBOOOOI just needed a place to sleep that night, otherwise I would have done more due diligence. Hopefully, you will.",1,,1

The rooms are spacious, beds are comfortable, lobby is clean, bathrooms are nice. This hotel is very clean and does not have a weird smell like other hotels in NYC. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. They let us check in right after our flight came in which was so nice since we walked in at 8am. They said if we couldn't check in they would have held our bags. The price is worth it. You feel safe, clean, and comfortable which is worth the price. Can't go wrong with this hotel.",,,
106,Christina P.,"Wenham, MA",343,70,9,5.0,12/28/2011,"We did not stay at this hotel, but at its sister hotel the Amsterdam Court, which will be a whole other review. However, we had drinks two nights at the lobby bar and the drinks were strong and the bartender was friendly and knowledgable of local attractions. This review is mostly to highlight the excellent customer service of the front desk employee, Emerald. We had the unfortunate luck to have lost our train tickets the night before departure. Our hotel front desk was unwilling to assist us other than to direct us to their pay per use internet ""business center"" whose computer had spotty internet and no Adobe to view/print tickets.Emerald graciously took the time to look up and print our tickets for us, even though we were not hotel guests. This saved us a lot of time and aggravation looking for somewhere to print out tickets in an unfamiliar area, late at night in the rain. Thank you Emerald!!",,2,1
107,Jessica R.,"New York, NY",68,149,18,3.0,10/13/2009,"The Ameritania Hotel is very hit and miss.  Depending on availability, your room can be the size of a studio apartment or a the size of a generous walk-in closet.The decor tries hard to be modern but falls somewhere in between seedy and masculine.  There are a lot of chocolate and orange accents.  The views leave a lot to be desired and the thru-wall air conditioners are rickety and loud.The good thing about the Ameritania is that you can find great deals for a centrally located tourist hotel.  I always recommend this place to people that want to visit Times Square without breaking the bank.",1,,1

109,Tina W.,"Silver Spring, MD",4,17,4,5.0,3/14/2015,"I loved my experience at this hotel. I don't understand the negative reviews. My friend and I shared a room with two double-beds. The beds were ultra comfy, the room was clean, and the noise level was appropriate for the area. We closed the window and heard very little, especially for the area were were in. The shower was nice and the bathroom was updated and clean. Actually, the decor of the entire room was pretty sweet. There was more than enough room for two people to move around and have space. Trust me when I tell you I have stayed in much smaller rooms. The black-out curtains were AMAZING and the tv had plenty of cable channels. We did not touch the snack bar because, of course, a Snicker costs $5. This is to be expected! I also never tried the Wifi so I cannot comment on that part. The greeters and service personnel were great. We payed about $150/night. As some have mentioned, the outlet was not in the most ideal location. This is a small price to pay, though. It is not the end of the world to have a plug not near the bed. This is an older hotel so I'd expect that some of the modern touches might be missing. I definitely recommend this gem which is in the perfect location for a great price.",2,,

111,Misha F.,"San Francisco, CA",564,546,194,3.0,2/21/2010,"Do you LOVE being almost centrally located, but just far enough to be away from all the loud crowds? How about a hotel room that is on the smaller side, but so poorly lit that you can't even see how big the room really is? Or do you LOVE when a building runs out of hot water at **busy** hours ""just like in Russia?"" If so, then this is the place for you. Ameritania...nice lobby, slow elevators, and dismal (yet trying to look chic) rooms. Located on the corner of 54th St and Broadway, you are just a quick walk to Times Square or Central Park.There are plenty of places to grab a quick bite (Europa Cafe, Starbucks, Crumbs, Crown Sushi Deli), I (heart) NY tee, or the 1,2,3.",,,
112,Sandy W.,"Washington D.C., DC",2,11,1,1.0,12/3/2010,Sucks.  Oppressively dim and dark decor.  So dark in the bathroom that I had to use my iPhone to shave.  No closet and not even a stand for my suitcase.  Elevators take forever.  Lobby looks like a set from Beetlejuice.,2,2,1
113,Elaine W.,"New York, NY",8,78,6,4.0,9/16/2009,"I'd start off by saying NEVER take a red eye into New York City...we got there @ 7am and had to walk around on the one end of summer day when there were thunderstorms waiting for check-in. Check in is usually @ 3pm but the concierge told us to be back @ noon so we were and they had a room for us way before check-in time. The room is super tiny but it was what we expected (we had gotten a great deal on expedia.com with our flight). Anyway, since my boyfriend and I are NOT part of the obese americans club, we were just fine with the limited space. The bed was comfortable, which was a plus because we slept most of the first day we were there due to the terrible red eye. The bathroom had no shower curtain, there was half a glass door covering the half of the bathtub where the shower drain / faucet was. Water got onto the floor when showering and there was no fan but it wasn't that big of a deal. The room came with air conditioning that worked so that acted like our fan for the room and it didn't get humid.David Letterman is right next door, though they weren't taping while we stayed there, it was fun to feel like we were part of a NYC experience. Times Square is literally three or four blocks away South. Subways aplenty all around us and Central Park was just another three or four blocks away North. Stay here for the location. The staff was friendly and helpful. They even helped us find a shuttle back to JFK so we didn't have to get a cab. There was a very delicious and very reasonable Thai restaurant down the street too, Topaz Thai. For Midtown manhattan, we definitely picked a wonderful, no frills, no hassel place to stay. We really enjoyed it.",,1,

115,Alison P.,"Somerville, MA",5,41,0,3.0,3/16/2008,"I stayed here for a few nights while in town on business.  The pros: great location at midtown, north of Times Square and just a few blocks south of Central Park; funky mod lobby and furnishings; free tea and coffee all afternoon down in the bar. The staff is friendly and the toiletries are lovely. My room had two double beds, was clean and had plenty of space.However, I got upgraded because my initial room had a broken phone, burned-out light bulb, and no internet (which, by the way, is $9.99 a day, definitely not free, and often slow).  The whole place is kept weirdly dim, as if it will add ambience, when in fact it just makes it hard to see in your suitcase or what button you're pressing in the elevator.  The elevator is, shall we say, leisurely.  There's no wee fridge in your room.  The doormen are half-assed, which for some reason feels sloppier than no doormen at all.  And the hotel bar, while retro-cool to look at, had a vague smell of urine around the whole perimeter.  I don't want to know.In short, fine because work was paying for it, and the location is worth money, but if I'd coughed up $200 + for this place I'd be pretty bummed.",1,,
116,Nick M.,"Queens, New York, NY",0,18,0,4.0,6/10/2013,Great hotel. Stayed here for business from 6/9-6/11/13.... Got a standard room with one queen bed. The room was on the smaller side but very nice. The staff is extremely nice and helpful. Whoever cleans the room should get a raise. I left towels and clothes everywhere and when I came back after lunch the room was pristine. Only downside is I stayed on the 8th floor right above The Letterman show and you can hear the traffic in the morning and it wakes you up. Other then that this hotel is spot on. 2nd time staying here and I will stay here again. Also 5 minute walk to times square and a million restaurants which is amazing.,,,
117,Susie B.,"Madison, NJ",0,3,0,3.0,6/17/2012,"The hotel is definitely trying to improve it's image through reconstruction, which is all well and good, but the employees need to improve their attitudes. I had requested a room change, since the first room was as small as a closet, and the woman at the front desk told me to call the next day between certain hours and ask if another room was ready for me. The next day I got a knock at the door and the bellhop was there, unannounced and unrequested. He did not greet me at all; when I opened the door he started yelling that my bags were not packed up to change rooms. I politely said it would take me one minute to gather everything up, and that I was told to call ahead: I was never told that someone would just show up at the room to take my bags. I threw everything into the bags and when I lugged everything out into the hall he had already gone downstairs. I brought everything downstairs and the people at the front desk said they did not know why he came up, since my new room was not yet ready and wouldn't be for another 45 minutes. When the woman at the front desk asked the bellhop what happened, he waved towards me and said ""She's just.."" and scoffed and rolled his eyes. A much nicer doorman told me that he would take my bags to the new room and I could wait out the 45 minutes in my former room. When the front desk staff told me my new room was ready, I went upstairs and found that housekeeping was still working on it. The actual hotel is okay. The rooms are small but it was alright for one person. It does have a smell like the other reviewers said, but seems clean. The only issue I have is with the staff. It seems as though they don't communicate well with each other, and at least one has a rotten attitude.",1,,
118,Matt P.,"Boulder, CO",126,81,0,4.0,3/6/2009,Somehow booked it for 89$ a night and after reading the reviews it seems that it was a pretty good deal compared to what most people pay.

119,Krystle R.,"Long Beach, CA",12,44,1,3.0,5/2/2008,"I stayed here for a week with my best friend.  It was summer in NY and it was HOT.  We were fortunate enough to get a room where the AC worked!  We were also fortunate to get one of the ""newer"" rooms.  One word - think European style hotel.  This means SMALL rooms.  It was great for just two gals, but try to fit a family in there and you will be screaming for another vacation!  Our view sucked and our tub drain didn't work, but it wasn't a horrible stay.  Bathroom was pretty small but everything was clean and tidy.  One HUGE plus is that its walking distance to TIMES SQUARE!  It gets three stars for me just for that fact!  You are literally next to the Dave Letterman show stage.  Oh, there is the most delicious pizza place right next to the hotel and a cute grocery store across the street.  There's also a Starbucks directly across and we went there for breakfast half the time.  We paid $185 per night ( in NY that is cheap!) but we wanted the luxury of location, not necessarily the hotel.  I mean, you are in New York! Get your lazy asses out and walk around!",,,
120,Valeri L.,"Austin, TX",124,102,0,2.0,10/28/2009,"My friends booked this hotel in a great and prime location. However I've been in cheaper hotels that were much better than this place. It was a great location, but our room smelt like fish the entire time we were there. As soon as we walked in for the first time we smelt it. We decided to endure it and just take it with a grain of salt, we were friendly and I booked a shuttle with the hotel for my return trip to the airport. To my dismay, I get a call the morning of my departure that the shuttle had been booked full. Apparently when they booked me I was the only one, then they booked the entire shuttle from under me. I was given two options take a $65 cab ride or a $15 bus ride to the airport.  I booked the shuttle at $25, so I had to shell out the extra money for a cab ride to the airport, which is the same price as if I hailed it from the curb for the convenience, because I had my entire clothing line in my bags and needed assistance therefore the bus was not an option. The car driver drove us through the back streets of Queen and into some random warehouse district making me feel really antsy and anxious. Needless to say I left New York on a sour note, which is a shame because I travel there at least twice a year. When I come back, I'm not using this hotel.",1,,

My biggest issue was with the bathroom.  There is a partial shower door, which is awesome for getting the floor completely wet.  The worst part was that the water temperate had 1 temperature...SCALDING HOT.  We essentially could not shower the entire 3 days that we were there.  I complained to the front desk about it 3 times. They said that they came to fix it. But the next morning when we went to shower, it is SCALDING HOT again.  So frustrating!  The 2nd day, they gave us a free complimentary breakfast.  They did not mention that it was a continential breakfast.  Overall, I am not very pleased with the hotel. I would not stay there again.",,,
122,Nick C.,"San Francisco, CA",1,118,2,1.0,9/3/2008,"I recently stayed at the Ameritania Hotel with my wife. I was on a business trip and I guess the company was hot on saving money.  When they first gave me my itinerary I was happy to learn that I was close to Times Square.  That is the only thing going for this hotel and at $285 a night it's evident that prices have indeed gone up in New York City even for no star hotels.  The lobby is modern but the elevators are old and very slow.  Our room on the 12th floor was small, and I say that in the literal sense. The box shaped patterned stained and dirty rug looked to be thirty years old.  I've never ever had to stay in a hotel where I had to wear sox in order to walk but in this one it's a necessity  The room was dark and perhaps there was a reason for this. The headboard to our bed was grimy and had a bit of a slickness to it maybe left over from a tenant a year or so ago. There seemed to be a hole in the floor next to the bathroom, a tiny little respite with a grungy tub and a window that was painted shut and would not open.  The Zenith 18 inch TV looked to be from the 1960's and I don't say that to infer nostolgic charm as it only had 5 fuzzy stations.  There was a desk in the corner with no chair which seemed a bit  odd but maybe not so as there was really no room for a chair.  The air conditioner was also very old but at least it worked.  There is a 24 hour deli and pizza place accross the street, Times Square is just a few short blocks away as is Central Park, so when they say that the hotel is centrally located they are not lying.  The Ameritania Hotel is only for the very budget conscious and those who don't stay in the room but only for a few hours to sleep.  You really have to not be pickey with the decor, the cleanliness, and the gereral decay of what may have once been a grand hotel.  But those days are long behind it as the Ameritania Hotel looks as though it hasn't been renovated since the Beatles played next door at the Ed Sullivan Theater back in the 1960's.",2,,
