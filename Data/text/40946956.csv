1,William W.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",13,111,0,3.0,2/3/2018,"I like this bar and they have a great $6 PBR and shot combo. There is a large back room and a lot of space overall, so this is an easy place to bring a bunch of people.I had a pretty awful experience here the 4th time I went here when a drunk guy talking to the bartender slowly started yelling more and yelling at my friends and I sitting further down the bar from him. He was eventually screaming at me and my friends who had not said a single word or had any interaction with him. I know that a drunk patron is not the bar's fault, but the bartender actively just let the situation escalate instead of intervening earlier before we felt uncomfortable enough that we just decided to walk out of the bar because I didn't want to get assaulted by this stranger. Frankly, I'll probably come back anyways. But like, get a bouncer for Saturday or at least figure out your protocols",2,1,

The only downside is, I distinctly remember a way better selection on their Juke Box the last time I was there.

I think the word hipster has expanded to really just mean ""anything I wouldn't do"", but that's B-Side the point. If anything this bar is more ""alternative"".There's not much more that can be said about B that the other reviewers haven't covered. The staff is chill, there's foosball which is fun, and you can maybe find some B-Sides on the jukebox. The $5 PBR and a shot combo is one of the cheaper ways of getting drunk out at a bar - if that's what you're into. But fair warning, the well shot is rough - never EVER double gulp it. The one thing I might have a complaint with is that the bar doesn't have any beers on tap and that it can get a little crowded on the weekends.

But hey, they have some good specials and cheap shots. The bartender was friendly and accommodating.The only issue I had was that the card minimum was $20 so I had to get an extra shot to close my tab. Chose a shot of well tequila which was about $5. I originally ordered one for a friend but she didn't want it, so I asked the bartender if he minded taking it - he said no with a smile and didn't put it on my tab.

15,Christine D.,"New York, NY",6,11,2,5.0,9/19/2013,"Two years ago, I moved to NYC and randomly chose to have a few drinks one night at B-Side. The reason I walked into B-Side was because it reminded me of a humble-yet-awesome little neighbourhood joint I myself used to bartend at.    My instincts were correct, and I drop in whenever I'm in the neighbourhood. The prices are great, the vibe is comfortable and friendly, it's just divey enough, and the music (as well as the movies playing) is stellar!   What initially hooked me was how friendly everyone there was. It's just a casual, all-inclusive place. I started shooting the shit with Steven there two years ago, and now I make a point to come in during his shifts (sorry, Miss O.. sounds to me like you've got some misplaced 'Billysburg anger).  Love this place!  Love these peeps!",,,1
16,Maya F.,"New York, NY",70,147,21,4.0,11/9/2011,"This is my new favorite after work bar. Andrew and Steve are top-shelf, keeping the crowd of awesome East Village weirdos at bay. Big D's at the door when the crowds get thick; they've got PBR & a (dodgy) shot for $5 any day of the week, a great jukebox, and a back room with high-backed banquettes and a foosball table... and you get all that under one low tin ceiling. In addition to a solid beer selection, they serve Powers whiskey for the Eire-ophiles, and Level vodka which apparently still exists, and lots of great and goofy stuff in between (their only specialty cocktail is amaro and ginger ale -- a potent digestif, perhaps to ward off the aftermath of too much Stoli Blueberi).(In the future, music is digital and analog is dead -- but the B-side lives on.)",,,

18,Emerson S.,"Alphabet City, Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,2.0,1/2/2014,"B-Side is a bar that has so much potential. It's gritty, has decently priced drinks, and a jukebox second only to the Library Bar. However....the male bartenders seem to only be friendly to people with giant Brooklyn beards and terrible handlebar mustaches. Out of the three times that I have ventured in to this place, there has not been a time where the bartenders have even said hello. Two of those times the bartender seems to fit this ""Steve"" description that girls seem to find so attractive. Not sure where these girls were because this place always seems filled with young guys dressed in the standard Williamsburg lumberjack attire. With all the other great dive bars in the neighborhood, it is hard to recommend this place to anyone. If you want to drink hip PBR's and be served by an unwelcoming bearded bartender who barely acknowledges you, then come to the B-Side.However....if you want to go to a better dive bar, then walk a few blocks to Manitobas, Mona's, Library Bar, International Bar, or Ottos where you will find a far more welcoming experience.",6,4,3

It's a bit classy (yes I called B-Side classy) for a dive bar.I'll get right to it.Although there are no draft beers, you can't beat $3 bottles of Bud, Bud Light, and PBR. This cheap price turns into HALF PRICE (yes, that's $1.50) during Happy Hour until 8pm - EVEN WEEKENDS.And of course, there's the constant special, $5 for a PBR and a shot of whiskey that tastes like horse piss but sure does get you drunk.The real reason I keep returning to B-Side is probably the bartenders. They're not quiet servers who engage you in empathetic small talk. They're part of the experience. One plays dice and does Irish car bombs with me. Another is loud and has the best wit I've ever witnessed in another girl.Pretty much, this place is like Cheers to me.Also, they're always playing random movies.

They don't really acknowledge you though, unless you're also wearing black leather. But that's okay.  You drink your beer (hopefully during happy hour), and you listen to more metal (though they do have Pretty Hate Machine), and you eventually mosey on to the back room to check out the....FOOSBALL TABLE!  Yes, this place has a FOOSBALL TABLE (coin operated)!  And at the sight of this wooden table with plastic figures connected to metal rods, your spirits soar, and suddenly the place is no longer so dark.  The people no longer gruff.  You take a deep breath and realize that the place no longer smells of armpit, but of the sweet sweet nectar of high Olympus!  Yes, the FOOSBALL TABLE is that great (if you like foosball), especially if there's no wait to play it (which there usually is).  And it's this redeeming item, this item alone, that will draw me back to the bar next time.",5,3,2

That might sound like a depressing place to be but trust me it's not. B Side manages to turn that Rock n' Roll sneer against life's suckiness into an optimistic grin and a slackjawed joy rivaled only by that Corky kid on Facts of Life (or Family Ties, I can never remember).See, as cuisine is to chefs, bars are to bartenders. If your bartender is a douche bag even high end clubs can seem like your creepy unmarried aunt's kitchen. B Side is a moody Rock n' Roll joint that plays music ranging from bar favorites like GNR to obscure up and comers like The Good The Bad and The Queen. Steve W plays movies that make you go ""hmmm"" on Fridays and Sara R throws end of the month parties that come with grilled cheese and a lifetime of memories warranty, so act now.The clientele is reflective of the local east village scene. There are hipsters, hip hop kids, sharks, jets, shirts and skins all drinking together in harmony. The back room is a nice make out spot  that I'm henceforth dubbing ""All The Way Bay"".  So if you and your sweetie are into hanging with some rock n roll kids, making new friends and drinking your faces off ($5 beer and shot happy hours) come through and let B Side turn that punk into funk.Fat A.",3,2,1

I've met some great friends, an awesome boyfriend, and had some of the messiest nights my liver has ever seen! I don't understand how people can complain about price...this is Manhattan, if you want it any cheaper go to Jersey. Everytime I come in it's like a scene out of cheers, hugs, highfives ,and asking if I want my usual. Sometimes weekends can get  too crowded, but it's when the best bartenders are working. Andrew and Sara on Friday , and then Andrew and Amy Saturday. Also, Steve watchin movies and bein chill during happy hours. Being a regular here never disappoints  and if you started hangin out there all the time I'm sure you'll agree, unless you're just stupid.",3,1,2

We directed the cabbie to 11th and B, knowing it'd get us in the vicinity of several worthy bars. I'd never been to B Side but as soon as my friends saw it they said, ""we HAVE to go here!"" So, we did.$5 cocktails (whiskey, vodka, whatevs--they were all strong), super friendly bartenders and decidedly not crowded for a Friday, allowing our little group to commandeer a table next to the jukebox. The crowd was a wonderfully unpretentious LES mix, including a 60-something man rockin' his swim trunks. It doesn't get much better than that.",,3,

The cast of characters at B Side makes this dive bar interesting. On the night I went, there was a cast of guys resembling the British dickheads out of that youtube video and a girl so drunk she was giving lapdances in the back room... still the music and foosball were entertaining and the people pleasant. I agree with the other yelpers - this is a good spot. People are wasties but having fun. Even if the bathrooms are an absolute horrorshow (the sink was ""out of order""), the dive has charm. Bring hand sanitizer.",,2,2
53,Lauren G.,"Boston, MA",0,144,20,4.0,3/7/2015,came by last night for the first time with my uncle who is a regular and had a great night. this place isn't fancy but it's definitely much more comfortable than what i'd normally call a dive bar. everyone was super friendly - the bartenders and patrons- i can certainly see why people love this place. it feels like the quintessential 'local bar' from every movie you've ever seen about ny - everyone knows your name and is ready to buy you a drink and chat the night away. the $5 white trash special - pbr & a shot of really shitty whiskey - is hilarious and we stuck to that for most of the night. will definitely be back.,,,1

Well my reason was some good friends were there hanging out the other night. One of them is dating the bartender so he's always there now. I mean wouldn't you be if you could get hooked up like that... free sex and beer. It's what the locs refer to as a ""dive bar"". Everything from it's stenciled, spray painted sign, to it's dark and eerie interior would leave you to believe it's a hole in the wall. I guess in a way it is. I personally think it's pretty cool there. I really enjoyed myself and could see myself hanging there on the regular. It doesn't hurt that it's only a block from my apartment too.",1,,1

If it does, I immediately knock down a star or two, depending on the inflation.The juke-box is rad. The bartenders are all super-hot. They know who keeps them in business and they act accordingly. This place is a good time, and laid-back, low-key. Ample seating all-around, and I think there was foosball somewhere. I didn't seek it.Also, to note for the females, I never waited in a line for the restroom.",,,
68,Ann B.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",1,33,1,3.0,2/5/2011,"I was introduced to this bar by a friend of mine a couple of years ago. This is a dive bar, but it is more of an indie/punkrock/metal mixture of rock scene. It's not a hardcore metal bar or an old musty bar. Lots of younger folks in their 20 somethings, but there are a handful of older dudes. Some older dudes are creepy. I suggest talking with people your own age.The bathrooms are gross, but it's a dive bar. The music is great if you like rock music from the 90's to present. Again a good mix of all types of rock. Even some classic rock.Drinks here are very well priced for NYC. But the best part is the people that work there. They are all funny, charismatic, nice, and quirky.

Somebody selected Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" on the jukebox and I instantly felt as if I had been transported to a cruddy bar in Murray Hill.  The illusion of the perfect bar was dashed. Everyone around me looked uneasy.  We held on for hope that all would return to normal after the song finished, but then Guns N Roses came on, and the only option was escape.",,1,

His cousin was ordering vodka tonics for $2 I believe maybe $2.50. I was in love. And after happy hour Bud light only goes up to $3 Still trying to figure out if the bar is dog friendly or the people that have dogs in there are friends with the owner/bartender either way if you like dogs this is the place to go there is always atleast one running around at your feet, jumping up to the bar.BUT STAY AWAY FROM THE BATHROOMS..THEY ARE HORRIBLE",,,
