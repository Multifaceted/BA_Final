Always sitting next to interesting people. The best bartenders in NYC Jimmy and Mike know how to make you feel well looked after. Always my go to if I'm going to a show at MSG or taking a train at penn station it's literally one block away.,,,

6,Sanjay G.,"Parsippany, NJ",321,385,7494,4.0,10/4/2017,"Upright sports irish bar..After trying to get into 2 alternate restaurants that had long wait times we walked into the Blarney, were seated and ordered up our meals in no time. There are two floors to choose from. The bottom floor has a large bar area and tables in the back for waitress service and meals. I like going upstairs to the 2nd floor, which is more intimate and the best part is the roof that slides open in warm weather. Nothing like have a cold drink on a warm NYC night with the stars above you; throw in some great live music, dancing with your friends and that is the recipe for a fantastic night in the city. Drinks are average-priced for NYC. We ordered Wings and some other fries. The prices are considered reasonable as well. We were pleased with our experience and can't wait to visit again!",2,2,2
7,Nicki A.,"Staten Island, NY",64,20,22,1.0,10/13/2018,"Went here like 2 weeks ago on a Sunday night since my s/o wanted to go for dinner before a concert at MSG.The waitress (didn't get her name but she was a grumpy blonde woman) was inattentive, rude, and snippy. If you don't like your job- quit. She took our drink order and didn't even stick around long enough to hear what I was ordering so she brought me a drink without lemon (twice). The least you can do is listen to the entire order request before running away. The soda I ordered was totally flat and the glass was mostly ice.I politely asked the waitress if the AC could be lowered as we were sitting right under the vent and it was blowing so hard that our shirts were blowing and it was freezing... I got a nasty response that was ""the fan is on, the AC isn't even on..."" I said well it is on because as you can see my shirt is blowing from the vent and pointed up (the fan was on the other side of the room) and she literally rolled her eyes and walked away from me. If the AC couldn't be lowered fine but there's no need to be rude about it and also not a good idea to freeze your customers.Before the food came the waitress literally THREW the utensils on the table and walked away. I've never had silverware thrown at me before, but first time for everything I guess.We ordered boneless wing appetizer and 2 burgers. The wings actually tasted good but the portion was very small for 2 people. 7 small bite size pieces of chicken and 2 pieces of celery... come on. The burgers had no taste to them at all.The waitress never came back to check on us and we basically had to flag her down to get the check. I was actually content with the wings until I woke up the next day and was violently sick all morning (clearly from the food I ate the night before). Definitely won't be back... pass on this place. It needs a food overhaul and workers (or at least her) need an attitude adjustment.",,2,
8,Suzanne E.,"Chicago, IL",101,353,28,5.0,1/27/2018,"I approached this place slowly, for purely accidental reasons:  first I saw it around the corner from my hotel window, and decided it was the highlight of the view; then it was across the street from our little table in the hotel bar and looked even more interesting; and then I woke up exhausted and decided to stay close to home base during the day, so walked across the street and past the clutch of folks hanging out on the sidewalk (smokers? fresh air fiends?), and made my way to the back room for a hard cider and a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, both of which were excellent (and vegetarian!) and not expensive. It was old-school, dark and cozy, and fairly quiet back there, and on the wall in front of me there was a sort of metallic elongated license plate-like sign saying ""Fecking Eedjit."" The server was friendly and the bar was packed. I am still trying to figure out whether the place really has a roof-top bar, as advertised; it seems to be only about two stories tall. A roof garden for the acrophobic? Anyway, like in the Tom Waits song, this pub sort of whispers ""home at last.""",2,1,1

They have a watered down happy hour selection. You're better off going with top shelf drinks. I wasn't happy about shelling out $6 for Cranberry & Vodka that tasted like sh*t. Never again would I waste my time spending money on something that didn't give me a buzz. It took my friend 5 of them to feel anything.

25,Angela R.,"Yonkers, NY",0,20,0,1.0,10/26/2016,"I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. I came across this bar because a friend and I were going to a Ranger game at MSG. Our original plan was to have dinner at Stout next door but unfortunately there was a 30 minute wait, so we decided to venture elsewhere. My friend insisted we try this bar since it seemed like a traditional Irish restaurant so at best they might have a good burger. The moment we walked in I knew something wasn't right. How come on a busy game night the place right next door was jam packed and this place was nearly empty? So we go to sit down for dinner at one of the many empty seats available which seats 4 and we are immediately directed by a not so friendly waitress to sit in a very tight table right on top of other customers which only seats 2. On top of that the decor was very dingy and outdated. STRIKE 1!But I still gave them the benefit of the doubt at this point. After that another not very friendly waitress comes over to take our drink order and I order a Stella on draft. Once I took one sip I immediately sent back requesting another drink because it was clearly skunked. The waitress did not respond too nicely to this request. STRIKE 2!!We finally go on to order our meals 2 burgers with french fries and another beer on tap...simple enough. When the burgers came out my friend immediately commented on how they looked like frozen diner burgers. I took literally two bites and spit it out in disgust because it was the worst burger I have ever tasted in my life. You'd honestly be better off going to McDonalds. So I decided to munch on the fries instead, which were completely tasteless and a waste of calories to keep eating. STRIKE 3!!!The waitress then took another 15 minutes to finally give us our check and asked me ""Was everything okay with your meal?"" I responded saying, ""Umm not really it wasn't very good"". Her response was to give me a dirty look and walk away. So on top of the fact that the place was an absolute dump to begin with she did not remove the Stella I returned or the untouched Burger from our bill. That is the least they could have done to redeem themselves from their horrible atmosphere, terrible service and absolutely awful food.You can rest assure I will never be returning to this place and I'll make sure everyone I know in the NYC area stays FAR AWAY from this place.",5,1,1
26,Elizabeth D.,"Plainview, NY",73,198,119,5.0,9/4/2016,"I gave this pub 5 stars for being an authentic Irish Pub. Drinks are made very well! They skimp on nothing. Staff is experienced, prompt and friendly. I love coming here when we are in the area.",4,,2
27,Jasmine W.,"New York, NY",666,162,694,4.0,3/27/2015,"I came here for happy hour after work. It's your typical sports bar with plenty of room and tvs to watch the game. Nothing special, but nothing bad. Standard service in a great location (next to Penn Station, MSG, Macy's).I was on the second floor, which has a removable roof for when the weather is nicer. Unfortunately it wasn't open when I was there, but I can imagine that it'd be a really cool to have a roof top bar. There isn't much to see since it's only on the second floor and thus your view is blocked by tall buildings.The Brooklyn Lager was $7.50, which is about what I expected for a drink.Overall just your average bar with nothing bad about it.",14,,8

30,Twylo E.,"Jersey City, NJ",17,10,119,3.0,2/17/2016,"I just came here to meet my friends and have a drink before we went off to a birthday dinner. I decided to have a Guinness Stout on tap - something I have never had before, but decided to try since this pub is ""known"" for it. I had not had Guinness since I was a teenager (over thirty years ago) and back then I just thought it was kinda nasty, pungent and overly bitter. But that was not the case with the drink I had tonight. The Guinness on tap had a strong taste, but was not overly pungent. It was very smooth, with a creamy head. It just tasted like a good strong, but balanced, dark beer. I'm glad I decided to give it a try! I'll definitely be having it again.The Blarney Rock is an ""Irish"" pub / sports bar (not my usual scene) that's been around since 1969. It has the reputation of being one of the oldest in New York. The crowd seems pretty chill. This was actually my second time there. Perhaps I'll try something from the menu next time.",9,,5
31,Delaney P.,"Las Vegas, NV",125,101,52,3.0,9/3/2016,Kinda pricey Irish pub super close to Penn Station. Did not go to the roof top though it was an option. Clean bathrooms which was absolutely great. The beers were a little on the pricey side for a selection of only a few beers on tap. Bartender was friendly but took forever to make note of our presence.l and he only checked on us once until we asked for the check.

Super friendly Irish bartender and waitress. Loved hearing them talk! Good drinks made by knowledgeable bartender. From what I remember of it the menu we got was mostly standard bar fare but it was after 10pm on a weeknight, so that was probably just the late night bar menu. They were playing 80s and 90s hits music at first, but after our first drink the bartender asked what type of music we'd like to hear and promptly changed it to traditional Irish music when we requested it.

44,Leonard P.,"Brooklyn, NY",175,189,310,4.0,2/21/2015,"If Feile and Stout are the new line of Irish gastropubs, then The Blarney Rock Pub is its old-school, uncultured cousin - and that is what is so great about this place! While the aforementioned spots will cater to the B&T crowd and suits that work in the area or attend a game at MSG, Blarney Rock is for the Blue seats crowd, the Joe sixpack and average joe who just wants a beer/drink without taking out a mortgage or becoming a sommelier.I did not have any food here (and did not really know that they served food), but by the looks of the place, perhaps you would not want to order anything, unless something simple such as fries or nachos. You would not want a meal from this place. It is simple, with a loud, raucous crowd who know how to drink and enjoy a good time.

Updated review","I came here for the first time yesterday on St Patrick's Day. The service was good for the amount of patrons the place held. Downstairs is the typical Irish bar set up. There's a lot of room at the bar and seating in the back. Upstairs was definitely a different atmosphere though, a little more ratchet. The music was pretty loud on the upstairs rooftop which was okay because it was a large open space. It was moderately crowded at 5pm and got a little heavier around 6:30pm. $7 for a Budweiser, $8 for Guinness. Moderately priced considering the area. Bartenders upstairs were very attentive. Would come back for happy hour on a regular week day after work.",5,,1

I came back again after a few hours for a couple of drinks and this time too a 20% tip was added to my check at the table!.... this is definitely not fair....

50,Jana H.,"Saint Paul, MN",302,239,991,3.0,1/28/2013,"Sooooo your looking for a sports bar in Midtown West?Reasons to Go Here:1: Location: Near MSG, NY Penn Station, Herald Square, Greely Square & Koreatown2: Price: Average food and beverage pricing based on Blarney's location and what nearby competitors charge3: Friendly Staff  serving up a smile and a sense of humor. Blarney is more of an ""Average Joe"" bar, which I personally appreciate it. It's a nice change from some of the Hoity-Toity bars and restaurants nearby.4: Typical greasy bar food that fills ya' up and serve its purpose. The food won't blow you away, however you won't regret eating at Blarney's versus other establishments nearby. I suggest ordering the cheeseburger slider with onions & skipping the nachos. -The fires could use some salt/ seasoning (personal preference)5: Great place to go before or after a game, concert, and or while waiting for a train Areas of Improvement: -The waitress was friendly; however I would have appreciated her checking up on my table more often instead of having to flag her down for refills, drink orders and the check.  -I find it rather inconvenient that Blarneys does not issue separate checks and allows only one method of payment (cash, debit or credit). Not a big deal, however it's not ideal for those who need separate receipts for business purposes and or if only a couple of people in your group have cash etc. Is The Blarney Rock Pub worth going to? Yes. Am I rushing to go back? No.",8,,3

We also shared a French onion soup which was okay..could've been a little warmer.  But overall the food was good.  Something that surprised me a little was that they automatically include 20% gratuity on the bill.  The bill you're initially presented with is handwritten, and if you don't look closely enough, you could miss the part where they add ""SC"" (?) to the bill as the tip.  We used a credit card, and until the slip arrived with the tip section filled out, we weren't sure why our bill was so high.  Food prices are reasonable ($10-$13) and beers are about $7.50 each.  Not bad for NY.  If you want good service, good food and beers, you should check this place out.  There's always a decent crowd here.",7,,2

Updated review","I find it really interesting how the owner responded to another poor review by apologizing and taking responsibility for what went wrong, but responds to me in a highly condescending manner. I don't go around looking to trash random dive bars. I prefer to have an enjoyable experience wherever I go so that I know I always have a place to go back to. However, I realize that will not always be the case and this instance in particular really stood out. Your reply makes it even worse. Now, in response to your comment of my review of your bar, first off, I was not in a group. I was alone and wanted to originally sit at the bar for that reason. However, there was no room. Second, I was not politely asked to switch tables. Being that you were not there for the interaction, I am guessing that's what that server with the accent told you. But she was far from polite and ""switching"" would imply that she offered me an alternative seat. The server kept unapologetically bumping into me and, verbatim, told me ""I need you to get up so I can use this table."" That is direct rudeness not an ""impression"" of rudeness and I feel that saying so and telling me your team wouldn't do exactly what they did is condescending to say. I just wanted to watch a game and grab lunch. What she should have done, aside from being more careful about her movements and at least apologizing, was politely ask if she could have the table for a large party coming and offer me an alternative seat. Not just tell me to get up especially after patronizing your establishment. Like I said in my review, before I even sat down I told my server, who was lovely by the way, that I had a little over an hour and wanted to catch the rest of the game. She said it would be no problem and I'd have more than enough time. Everything was fine up until this other server came in. I work right down the street so I like having nearby options to hang out and would be willing to give this place another try, but not if I'm going to be patronized for sharing my experience in its entire truth.",2,,
63,Benjamin M.,"Gaithersburg, MD",1419,752,293,3.0,3/9/2013,"3.5 Stars. Looking for a spot to watch the Knicks/Heat game, I found the Blarney Rock Pub around the corner from MSG. Thankfully, it wasn't very busy so I grabbed a stool near the end of the bar.I ordered a Guinness and looked over the short menu, looking for something to satisfy my lunchtime hunger. I easily decided on the open roast beef sandwich with fries. It arrived a short time later via one of the Irish lassies working there and I looked in wonder at the slices upon slices of roast beef layered all over the plate. I think there was some bread under there somewhere. I asked for an extra side of gravy, poured it all over the fries and dove into the massive sandwich. It was initially a little bland, but a little salt and pepper flavored it up a bit. But talk about filling! I didn't eat anything else for the rest of the day.",2,1,1

67,Max D.,"Washington, DC",0,9,0,2.0,1/3/2016,"My wife and I went to Blarneys on a Saturday night at 5PM. We had a party of three with the third person arriving shortly. They seated us saying that was fine, and our third arrived about 5 minutes later. During those five minutes, we were asked for our order 3 times by 2 different people. Bad coordination, maybe? Either way, no thanks. Within 5 minutes of our third arriving, we were asked twice more for our order. I guess they assumed my friend had studied the menu in advance, or that we weren't interested in exchanging pleasantries. They're running a business, and by God they aren't going to let the customer get in their way.We order, and 10 minutes later our food comes. It is exactly okay. The burgers were overcooked, but the bacon on top helped. The fries were clearly junk pre-frozen pub fries. Generic bun, generic tomato, generic shredded lettuce, pickle spear. Nothing special, but the price ($12/burger) wasn't too over the top I guess for Penn Station area places.With food still on the table, we were handed the bill. I get it. It's a Saturday night. I'm sure the waitresses are busy. It was a little weird though, as from this point forward, nobody was interested in getting us to buy more drinks or anything else. Neither of the two persistent waitresses from the start of the meal even asked. This was the first sign they wanted us to leave.The second sign that our departure was desired was when we were straight up told to leave. This was at 5:45PM. After a 45 minute meal (30 minutes after we got our food), we are told someone is waiting for the table.What in the ef? My party dropped like $70 on this meal and we're getting kicked after 45 minutes?   No loss, I suppose as in that time the music became noticeably louder and the bar had been inundated by women with orange sun tans and men who unironically referred to each other as ""Bruh"". These last two bits I garnered during the few minutes it took me to weave through the crowd towards the front door. Admittedly, the bar area had gotten quite busy. Maybe if you're just interested in getting hammered at the bar, this place is fine.As a restaurant though...Aggressive wait staff. Ho-hum food. Questionable clientele.I'd avoid this place.",2,1,

Updated review","Tom I am updating my review and updating  the stars because you got back to me.  The review was written moments after we left while standing out front, so the date it was posted was the day we were there.  I can imagine just by seeing how I was able to write the review eloquently enough at the time I was not intoxicated.  I worked in bars for a long time so I understand that it is the servers choice, but I am also an adult and know when enough is enough.  But again the shots were in shot glasses so as you know there was no over pouring.  We did eat and we were there for quite a while.  I am also a business owner and own 2 salons in Arizona so I know how customer service can make or break an experience.  By the bartender telling us she didn't feel comfortable giving us more drinks but not elaborating when we asked why was strange. She just shrugged her shoulders and said that is just how she felt.  Not that we seemed drunk or too loud or it was company policy or anything!  So we left, walked a few blocks away and had more food and drinks, which was what we were planning on doing anyway, hence the appetizers at the beginning.",1,1,

This was my fault for bringing them there, but hey...what are ya gonna do?! Having said that, let me say that the mixed drinks were awful! I went to some scam bartending school one summer and I can make better drinks! And what is with the glasses that the drinks come in??? They look like crystal wine glasses from the 50's and you are putting a vodka tonic in it. What the hell is that about? Ever hear of a rocks glass? It is probably a better bet to go for the beer...in a bottle.And we get to the food... Dude, worst nachos ever! Granted I am from California and should not expect good nachos from an Irish pub in New York, but wow these were bad. But this place does redeem itself with the wings.

The waitress would disappear for at least 15 minutes and when we did catch sight of her we had to wave her down. The part that most disappoints me is their deceptive happy hour. The waitress told us that all items were on happy hour. We ordered 5 beers and 10 wings. The beers came out to $7.50 each and the wings were $10, not exactly happy hour prices. We didn't mind the food being regular-priced. It was the drinks that really disappointed us. The happy hour special for blue moon was $10 instead of $12 and Blue Moon dropped to $7.50 from $8.00. It's not so much about the money as it is about the lie. This isn't happy hour. And your waitress was inattentive.",,,

Well, these bartenders were on point! The bar was 3 deep and they still managed to point me out and get us beers within 2 minutes of entering. We then hiked upstairs to the rooftop, they had Billy Joel music playing through out the pub which really set the mood and everyone in this place was rockin out and the energy was great. It got us even more pumped for the concert.

I visit Manhattan frequently and this was by far the worst experience I have had at a bar/restaurant. Our party of 4, came here before the Rangers game last night for some drinks and dinner. The dining area was upstairs and very cold. Waitress was very unfriendly and cold. We ordered wings, and nachos for apps and wraps and cheesesteaks for our meal. ALL OF WHICH WERE FROM A FREEZER. We actually watched the ""cook"" take all of the ingredients out of a white 1994 freezer and throw into a deep fryer. The food was border line inedible and tasted frozen. Our drinks were expensive, although I cant tell you HOW expensive because they didnt itemize our bill. What we did actually see on the bill was an automatic $40 service charge added. For 4 people? REDICULOUS. We asked the manager what this was, and they told us they add this charge to the bill whenever MSG has an event going on that day. For 3 rounds of budlights, nachos, wings and sandwhiches the bill was $250 for 4 people. Completely out of control. I know things are more expensive in the city, but $250 for frozen food just seemed like robery to us. We will NOT be coming back here and you shouldnt either!",,,

I started working in the city in like, 2006, and a coworker and myself stumbled upon this bar by accident - we were next door, at Stout, trying to watch a baseball game or something SURROUNDED by men with bad hair in cowboy hats trying to talk to us. In disgust, we moved next door and my life has not been the same since. The bartenders are basically the original cast from that fateful fall evening; occasionally adding one or two, but always pulling back the all stars on the days they know they'll be busy (st paddys day, before thanksgiving, etc.). the location is perfect for really any bar, but instead of selling out and jacking up the prices of their drinks, they keep their costs down, making sure their loyal following of blue collar workers is steadfast. Buybacks? no doubt. the food is bar food; they advertise that they have an Irish breakfast. I don't know what that is, but the next time I'm in the bar for breakfast I'll definitely get it. The bartenders are all nice and they greet us with a kiss on the cheek and a big, fat, HELLO! (really, should I be admitting that a bartender knows my first name? Damn right! I'm proud of it, in fact). Now, they treat their regulars well, but they also take care of people they've never met before. I also like ""if you act like a d-ck, they won't hesitate to tell you to behave"". Not for nothing, I've tried to institute after work happy hours there but my coworkers aren't as enamored by the bar as I am. My friends, however, will meet me there any day of the week (literally). BTW, you may see they displayed the ""4th Annual Trashy Bar Crawl"" sign...yea, that was my bar crawl!  The NYCTBC executive board LOVES the shout out.  My friends and I do that every year in Feb and the rock is always our last, and most memorable stop.",8,2,7

I've been coming here during the holidays each year for the better part of a decade on my way to MSG and a Rangers game but this year I finally decided to get some food in addition to copious amounts of booze. And I'm glad I did. Let me start by saying this place has changed. If you came here 10 years ago and were thinking of coming back, don't expect it to be what it used to be. Its definitely cleaned itself up a bit and did away with some of the old standbys, like free apps after MSG sporting events. But the pours are still mighty and, in general, its only gotten better. The food here was what really surprised me. Maybe its just because I had such low expectations. I mean, its a dive that's a good place to get a solid buzz, but food? I wasn't so sure. I decided to keep it simple. Stick with the pub food. So I ordered a burger. What I received was a delicious, well cooked, cheese covered, piece of beef that really hit the spot. Its not hard to get a decent burger, but its not hard to mess it up either. And while I wouldn't put this on any ""Best of"" lists, I would seriously consider it if you're looking for a pub to grab some food and drinks before an MSG event or hitting the rails at Penn. Will I go back? Absolutely. And I'll remember to order some food again too.",11,3,6

Ordered sub-par mozzarella sticks and drank some average priced beers. Enjoyed the rooftop bar before the place filled up but were rudely and suddenly brought our tab before we were finished ordering drinks. We were told that the bar needed our seats and so we had to finish up and leave. This was after approx 50 minutes at the place. After telling our server that we just wanted to watch the last 5 min of the game before leaving, she stood by, hovering, until we paid and left. She was incredibly rude and insisted that they needed our seats. I have never in my life been treated so poorly at a bar and also write negative reviews very sparingly. I will never go back to this particular establishment and felt that this service ruined the game and our drinks for us.",,,
152,Pedro S.,"New York, NY",71,175,0,2.0,2/27/2012,"If you're going for the food, this place pretty much sucks. You can tell it's the type of place where people go to drink and then wind up paying for very low quality, high-priced food.About that food, if you sit in the table (not bar) section, you can see the 'chef' take all of the food out of the freezer before he 'cooks' it. The freezer and refrigerator are actually in the dining area.Condiments are fast food packs taken out of the refrigerator in the dining area, as well! And the Irish waitress doesn't care about her appearance...just frumpy looking. Also, when I went, she was eating a burger and fries and seemed to be bothered to attend to customers, and in fact would grab fries and bite of her burger as she walked by her own plate while carrying customers' food.The waitress won't tell you this until you get your check, but there are no free refills on Cokes, even though she offers them so casually when you're about to leave. They're $3 each.",,,

Too expensive to go back.",2,1,

We were hoping to go next door for the TX football game but they were overflowing - so we saw TVs in here and came in. They said they would be showing the TX game but it was on a tiny TV because all the big TVs were taken up by the hockey game. My friend commented that it looked and smelled just like her grandmother's house, from the wood paneling on the wall to the TV showing wheel of fortune...really? wheel of fortune?...in a bar...in nyc...on a Saturday night? And I'm sorry if it's so wrong to ask if you have pumpkin beer, it's fall and other places have it! Anyway, we drank our beers quickly and left. Also, a cheap looking bar should have cheap drinks, because it's not like you're paying for atmosphere - this place isn't even cheap.",2,1,

160,Darcy W.,"New York, NY",2,9,0,5.0,4/18/2008,"I would like to say that I've been frequenting Manhattan bars since before you were an itch in your daddy's pants.  Truth is, I'm not that old and maybe daddy never itched... maybe he woke up one morning after a particularly rough bender, rolled over, and met mommy (again).  The point is, I have yet to find a bar I love as much as the Rock.  I would say that this bar is a throwback to an age when men were men, but I don't particularly care for the saying and I tend to find women who love the Rock are some of the most interesting and down-to-earth in the city.  A few points while I'm on my yelp-box:1. Buy-backs are about as much of a myth as dry land, and this bar reminds you to take part in the centuries-old tradition of saddling up to a pub, staying for a few hours, and making conversation with your 'tender.  So long as you don't forget about the other centuries-old tradition of tipping said bartender, you will assuredly be rewarded with a round on the house if you stick around long enough and refrain from making a complete ass of yourself.  2. A bottle of beer does not cost $5 to produce.  Therefore, you should never pay anything more than $5 for a cold one.  Bars that obey the simple laws of drinkonomics seem to be a dying breed in this town, but the Rock has always been a mainstay and proponent of the maxim that cheap beer should be cheap. 3.  Check your classist B.S. at the door.  It doesn't matter if you're an attorney, elevator repair man, MTA track worker, banker, or real estate agent--the Rock welcomes you with open arms.  It also doesn't matter if you're a commuter, tourist, local, or even a resident of New Jersey.  I've had some of the best conversations--albeit some of the strangest--with Rock patrons, and it has helped renew my faith in my fellow man. 4.  LETS GO RANGERS.  This is the best bar to watch Rangers games, period.  I may have started more chants in this bar than in the Garden itself.  Priced out of seats for the playoffs?  Join the dozens of jersey-wearing blueshirt faithful to watch the games here, and do not hesitate to cheer like it's '94 when the Rangers put the puck in the back of the net.  I heart the Rock.",7,6,6

So...we went out thought after a long day of shopping and cliche tourism, why not wine down with a few drinks. So we stopped here because we heard some very good news about the place and about cheap drinks. Little did I know, we were in for a surprise. When we first entered, we saw numerous open tables in the front of the store, as I approached to grab a seat, we were greeted and escorted to the back of the store, where we were very tightly squeezed in. We also noticed that this must be the minority section of the store because not only were we served last (while we were waiting 4 other groups came in and were served) but were also warned that if we didnt order within a given time frame, we had to leave. So, on that note we took our money elsewhere. I didn't think an Irish Pub would be racist, especially since they didnt have a warm welcome to America either. So my advice is to management and the lady that made us feel at home, next time you think to judge someone based off their ethnicity, just know that there is something called Karma, and what goes around comes around.",,1,

However, the biggest reason I'd bother to come in here is to drink beer and watch a game on TV (when Stout is too busy, or something). Unfortunately, the beer is the same price as Stout, and the selection is extremely small compared to Stout. Oh, and it's cash only. I can get over the beer situation, but it was the TV situation that really made me wish I went somewhere else instead. The TVs are really small, and even though there are a few bigger ones, about half are so small that you'd rather hurt your neck looking down the bar to watch the bigger one. I suggest just going over to Stout and dealing with the bigger crowd of people. The beer (and an enormous selection of beer) is the same price and you can actually pay with a credit card.",1,,
