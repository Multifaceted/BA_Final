I have been partaking in the freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling program downstairs and cannot even begin to explain what an absolute privilege it is to train with the elite wrestlers who attend the club. The training facility is large and open enough for about 2 dozen men to comfortably train. The coaches are super helpful and involved with their athletes. I couldn't help but notice all the complaints in the reviews on the 'dress code'. This is a private club, nobody is forcing you to join. It's great to see that in city filled with chaos, noise, and indecency, there exists a place where there are still rules and dignity. I am as working class as you can get, but I make sure to follow the dress code when I enter the building. I look forward to more training session to come, and would highly recommend this club!",12,2,5

Call it what you want but good heavens there still a place the exists that has not been watered down to a low level of our current society. Had brunch there today and it was a pleasure to see families interacting and not on their cell phones. The food was good and the view from the dinning room overlooking Central Park and the greatest city in the world is priceless. The Club must be doing something right there are 10,000 members.",,,

That is the only time for the whole year when I need to wear suit. Nice architecture, good location and views over Central Park are positives. Nothing else works for me. Stuffy, snobby place, NY worst at its finest. Old doesnt mean tradition.  Several things badly need remodeling or repair. Smelly bathrooms, bad food, staff members are formal, not nice or friendly. Exhuberant fees, exclusivity based on history and tradition. And what is up with enforcing dress code like it is army or prison? I belong to nice Club in downtown Chicago that moved with times to be relevant. NYAC, you should be out of business, but you stay in due to your loyal clients that don't demand change. Good luck, you need it!",11,4,3

8,Andrea C.,"MIDDLE VILLAGE, NY",0,2,0,4.0,12/26/2016,"New York Athletic Club is definitely an experience. Located right at the south end of Central Park, the ambiance is very deliberate and very preppy. Old athletic photos line the wall, though it's clear that the patrons don't only use the club for athletic facilities. I had the calamari and steak from the tap room, and it was delicious dinner. Everything was well seasoned and yummy. The wait staff was attentive and polite. You can see the pride they take in their Olympic legacies. Being familiar with prep school culture, this environment wasn't disagreeable: lots of wealth but necessarily opulent. Not necessarily an everyday kind of folk. It's worth it for the great food, architecture, and fancy New York air.",2,,

Bed comfort: mattress is defective. It sinks down in the middle. With the bed nicely made you can already see it, but when you climb in, it's worse than imagined. Woke up with back and neck ache. My day starts at 8:00 AM and goes to 11:30pm. I've unpacked so didn't have time to change rooms.2. Temperature: they have one central heat and air system, meaning they decide if it's time for heat to be on or air. This week is unseasonably cold, but the setting in the rooms is on air. Had to wear my leather jacket while watching tv in the room. Ask front desk for space heater and was told they were out and was given extra blankets.3. Smell: There is leftover cigarette smell in this room, not prominent, but it's there. Wished the windows opens so I can air it out, but no they don't.4. Shower: Tried to take a shower yesterday before a business dinner, and there was no hot water, just luke  warm. Called front desk and was advised to leave it on for 10 minutes or engineer will come fix. I had my time managed so I didn't have extra time to wait. She was right after 10 minutes or so hot water did come on. 5. Phone: the button that calls front desk doesn't work. But to reach front desk, you have to use the assistant manager's button.The staff were friendly and attentive to all the issues I brought up, but the room quality and comfort is out of their control.Do not stay here unless you have to like me.",2,,
11,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10929,5.0,8/7/2013,"This is one of the most opulent places I have been to in the seven years I've lived in New York. . . . twice for completely separate reasons. It was founded in 1868 and originally housed I think U.S. athlete's training for the Olympics. It's still used for athletics functions and apartment housing or their decadent rooms are used for parties and social gatherings. If you have one of those rare memberships that is.You will notice the building immediately walking past Central Park because its the huge one with the flags waving outside in the breeze and the golden doors saying: ""Club Members Only"". Only slightly intimidating. But when you walk through those pearly gates I kid you not there are golden cherubs singing, fountains, chandeliers, and other such crazy artifacts encompassing every nook and cranny of a tremendous reception lounge. We were immediately guided upstairs to the 9th floor - which is apparently listed as the Card Room, Lounge, Library & Terrace area. The BATHROOMS. The bathrooms each have a separate lounge before even going into the bathroom. The Library that we were given for our party after attending a funeral of a Wall Street monolith was gorgeous. Full bar of carefully selected imbibes and a separate table of a decadent spread of: roasted chicken, fresh salmon, caprese, roasted vegetables, tortellini, and various deserts. It was beautiful and I kind of decided then and there that I want to make millions and live in the New York Athletic Club one day. A beautiful terrace also connects to the room we were in and opens out to both the street and a side angle of Central Park. Segue - into a random time that I was invited into this building on another occasion this summer. I had a friend that's overly rich father let him stay here. Spoiled brat. Right? But I got to see probably one of the best views of Central Park that I have ever experienced in my life.",10,3,3

13,Pete K.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,9,0,1.0,3/31/2017,For the price you're getting a really poor experience. I've been to many athletic clubs around and the New York Athletic Club is by far the worse. While the building might have a lot of history behind it this is no excuse for a bad experience. The biggest issue is the staff who is rude and unfriendly. Staff was pushy and acted like they wanted me to move on never wanting to help or make my experience any better. The rooms were fine but for what you are paying you can stay at just as nice places for a fraction of the cost. What I'm really trying I get at is don't waste your time or money here.,2,,

We love to dress up, though it's annoying to have to wear business casual just to enter the gym or else use the back door, it's still a great location for both social networking and dates.  The restaurant will run you $100 a person but has one of the planet's top chefs, right? The coat check is complimentary in the lobby. The pool is old but the gym seems to have a lot of newer equipment. The rooftop deck is the most amazing view I've seen yet. It overlooks ALL of Central Park, facing uptown. There are tons of clubs to choose from as a member, and I found myself wanting to do it all!",2,,
15,Neil B.,"Brooklyn, NY",575,983,1096,3.0,11/8/2014,"I've been to the New York athletic club twice as a guest of a member and once when my parents stayed there. There was also a man in my apartment building who worked there for many years until he passed away.It is pretentious...at times ridiculously so with a 1950's prep school dress code inspection at the front door; but I can't penalize them for this because that is who they are....and in my humble opinion, have every right to be as long as they don't base their policies on race, gender or religion which I have no reason to believe they do.I have worked out at the club and found their facilities surprisingly average. It has a prep school gym feel which I surmise is on purpose within an ""old boys"" society club. Likewise while the food did not over impress me, everything was well made and served by accomodating servers. Walking into their building is like going to your great grandmother's mansion and in its own preppy way kind of charming with old time photos, awards, etc displayed as if one where walking through a New England Prep School. This atmosphere carries over into the bar where the service was courteous and polite.  Finally I knew a man who worked there for many years and he told me they treat their employees very well which was nice to learn!",12,3,2

It's a place of tradition which some of these imbeciles writing negative reviews  because of the dress code don't get. Do you understand this is a traditional private club? This is not Hicksville, USA show up in flip flops, this is New York City. Secondly, it is not a hotel, it is an international sports club with associations all over the globe.

The building has a beautiful pool, a roof deck overlooking the park, boxing (took a great class that is on most Saturday's) and wonderful exercise facility. There are so many great places to eat right outside the door it is hard to stay in the building to eat, so can't comment much on the food.

25,Jacob M.,"Philadelphia, PA",275,136,2,2.0,2/12/2014,"This place was overrated. Every single aspect of it. When I arrived, the staff was oddly brusque despite being properly dressed and citing a member's name. When trying to move a chair in the bar (THE BAR), I was told that we could not do that because that would ""ruin the ambience."" Excuse me? To the bar's credit, the drinks were strong although they definitely weren't mixed well.Our group moved up to the tavern to order dinner and while the salad bar was pretty good, the rest of the food was mediocre at best. The veggie burger I had was very dry, tough, and inedible. It was subpar even for catering food.What's perhaps the best part and somewhat redeeming factor of this club is the architecture. Its pre-war, detailed ornamentation is beautiful and is clearly very well taken care of. The finely carved wood and glittering stone are dazzling, and the decor is certainly well maintained.Unfortunately, a salad bar and beautiful building do not alone make a good athletic club.",5,2,1

(Yup, right on Central Park South.  That's just how I roll.)  This meant that when I walked in to the Athletic Club I was greeted with a smile and a ""good evening Miss, how can we direct you.""  A friend who arrived a few minutes later, and still had her rain boots on was immediately asked to visit the ladies lounge to change her foot attire.When we all had our proper foot attire on we made our way through the lobby to the coat check and then upstairs to the 10th floor where our event was taking place.  The lobby and hallways leading to the room were beautiful.  Dark woods, richly colored upholstery seemed to be everywhere.The food served at our event was not great.  The chicken on skewers wasn't breaded, wasn't grilled... and honestly looked like someone had steamed the tender.  Is that even possible?  Blah.  I hope that's not how they do it in the restaurants at the Club.  And the beef wellington puff pastry things were just not good.  The saving grace was the cheese platter.  Oh my the cheese platter.  Can someone, anyone, tell me where I can find that delicious garlic and herb goat cheese I had last night?  Yum!  After we finished off a good portion of the cheese platter we decided to wander around the club.  We visited the billiards room, gym/basketball courts, bar/lounge and trophy room.  All were beautifully done... but too swanky for me.  Unless I'm invited in for an event I really don't see myself hanging out here or requesting membership.  But if you get the opportunity to visit- you definitely should.",5,2,2

Gross.  The guest that previously stayed in the room filled out one of those survey cards, which clearly never got picked up by housekeeping, as it was still on the nightstand when we arrived.  That person also complained about the plumbing, but it never got taken care of.This place sucks, and as nice as it was of our client to set us up here, we all agreed that we will be billing the client for a better place that will cost a hell of a lot less and provide much better service without being A-holes about ""rules.""",36,24,11

I attended a conference here in one of their ballrooms. The decor was very 80s/90s. A nice big space, but a little dated. What was also awkward was that the way the chairs were oriented, we were looking at the ""stage"" but behind it was the kitchen/ employee break room. It was distracting to see people talking and chatting as a backdrop to the event. Overall, it was a nice place and I enjoyed seeing the inside!

Upon arrival I waited in the lobby for some time while my partner arrived. Enough time to soak in the atmosphere and rich history. While the decor is regal in it's history the staff does not reflect that. They seem to carry a certain relationship level with patrons as they walk in and out but the moment they're out of the picture their true colors seep out. Even though I was visibly in the lobby I heard staff make unprofessional comments. I understand, we're all human and let loose. This was a minor gesture that put a BIG dent in what happened next. When we went to check in the woman that checked us in made a comment that we were already 'checked in' and then proceeded to check us in. This was strange as we had not yet checked in but we ignored it. In addition to that weird moment she also had trouble finding our reservation. We waited. It wasn't an exceptionally warm and hospitable welcome as she was low voiced and a bit difficult to follow however you could tell that maybe she wasn't as seasoned as the rest of the employees. We get our key and head upstairs to our room. We swipe in. The door is locked. A man shouts ""hello?!"". The hotel checked us into thee wrong room. Big mistake. We head back to the lobby and this time are passed off to a seemingly more seasoned staff member whom made no sincere apology for the mistake his colleague just made. Mistakes happen. Sure. But as an institution who's sole proprietorship is service particularly to guests we didn't feel accommodated for the mistake. It turns out that they didn't double book us as they led us to believe. We were simply checked into the wrong room by mistake. Sadly we were LIED to and led to believe they made a mistake and were ""upgrading"" us to a better room. The room we booked to begin with.  The room was ok. I don't personally think it's worth the price however the view off the terrace is worth every penny. That is truly an iconic New York view.

Night after night when we had our meals the waiters repeatedly ignored us, were not courteous, and just did an overall awful job. They even messed up some of our guests orders and rushed us out of there because the kitchen was close to closing. I guess that's the problem with union workers...their jobs are so secure they can act like jokes. The men who work the bar are amazing though! So sweet and professional! LOVED the food.

The other reviewers who complained have clearly never been to a country or city club and possibly might have grown up in a barn. We requested a queen bed when we made our reservations, but when we got to the room it was clearly a full sized bed. We went downstairs to complain and the lady at the front desk laughed stating that it was a queen bed and quickly dismissed us. First of all, I don't appreciate some uneducated, unprofessional lady laughing at the situation. Second of all, that could have been a queen bed for someone who lived in the 1700's, but NOT in the modern world. I know what a queen bed is and that was not a queen. Ironically, the same thing happened to another couple who was visiting NYC with us and staying at another city club. They had requested a king bed, but received a queen. I'm convinced the city clubs have gotten together to play a joke on their guests...or the people of new york are really short and have a different standard of bed sizes. Maybe I'm just used to bigger and better in Texas. Unfortunately, we were staying in NYC at a very bad time...scaffolding season and so it was extremely noisy on the week days and impossible to sleep in the mornings with the men tapping and pounding away at the bricks on the building. Overall, the NYAC is great. The piano bar downstairs is wonderful. I would recommend staying here, just make sure you request a bed that's a size larger than the bed you actually want!!",7,4,2
39,Jenn L.,"New York, NY",221,317,547,3.0,3/4/2009,"So here's the deal.  My stay was being comped by someone else, so I can only comment on everything else (although I have the feeling I would never pay to stay there on my own).We had an awesome view of Central Park.  I'm talking.. absolutely beautiful.  My friend Creta and I stayed in what I would say is a pretty small room - it had 2 twin beds.... I wasn't even aware that places have TWIN beds anymore (that aren't rollaways).The service was great.  We had some really nice housekeepers that we chatted with.  I think that you can learn a lot about a hotel by talking to the workers that aren't trained to say certain things to you.  We chatted about tons of things like clothes.  Remember that the ""help"" are people too... be nice to them.  It's something so small that I think gets overlooked a lot.The dress code?  Lame.  I understand the need to feel high and mighty and better than others, but maybe just restrict that whole ""no jeans"" policy to business hours?  Let's face it.  I'm a non-ivy league, no-trust fund, starving college student... I barely had a nice pair of slacks for each day of the week that I stayed there.... I certainly didn't want to go out at night in anything but comfy jeans.",13,8,1
40,Chels G.,"Manhattan, NY",78,86,46,2.0,7/12/2013,"I do not understand how this place can have such high rating. I went for a conference kind of thing that lasted for 3 days. ALL CONS with couple minor PROs.CONS:1. Smells musky.2. AC broke down in one of the rooms we were using for two days.3. Drilling sound from next door.4. Loud squeaky doors that's easily fixable that was not fixed for us even though we complained and was told that it'll be fixed. 5. Terrible food. 6. Don't get me started about the toilet. When it flushed a LOT of the water sprinkled upwards!!!!!!!!! WHAT THE HECK??? And yes, I've tried all the stalls on the floor I was on. Some of the restrooms were not well ventilated and was.. nasty. 7. The whole building isn't well ventilated.8. We were only allowed to have 10 people on Wi-Fi at a time when we had over 1000 people there at a time. I understand that it would make it internet run slower, but with at least 5 people on stage for each session, with 5~6 sessions running at once, don't you think limit of 10 people is weeee bit low?8. People who are exclusive members of this place looked down on the people who came for the conference. I'm guessing because a lot of us are colored (yellow, brown, black, and everywhere in between) and not white. How dare us use their facility??? ROFL. I've heard some snotty comments that I do not want to repeat here. PRO:1. Surprisingly good decaf coffee. (I'm an avid regular coffee drinker and usually dislike decafs but this one was good)2. Delicious cookies3. Very sweet and attentive concierge and wait staff.4. Nice decor in some of the rooms.5. Comfy women's lounge on 9th floor.I wish to never return to this place, but I will probably have to for another conference. Sigh. It would be nice if the food is better at least for next time....",9,2,2

45,L P.,"Reno, NV",0,43,15,3.0,10/31/2012,"Stayed here on a business trip for one night when there was a problem with my original accommodations until I could move to another hotel. You must be sponsored by a member and there is a strictly enforced dress code. The food for the meetings was good all though the coffee is not. The room I was in was tiny. I have a bigger closet at home. However, it's location directly across the street from Central Park could not be more wonderful and there are many excellent places to dine and drink nearby. I did not use the athletic facilities as I didn't have time. The members only bar is full of presumably very important men. There was approximately 50-60 very distinguished men at the bar and myself the lone woman. Pretty good odds if I were single! Overall it was pleasant and the location outstanding.",3,2,
46,Robert S.,"Los Angeles, CA",34,557,0,3.0,12/26/2009,"This is an exclusive, expensive member's only club located in a prime, Central Park South location that contains athletic facilities, some hotel rooms, banquet facilities and a bar & restaurant. This place is so dated and old fashioned that it can be both quaint and irritating. They have a dress code that requires every male entering the building to wear a sport-coat or suit, completely ridiculous for a facility that in some ways is a glorified gym. I have stayed a night here, in an aging, dated hotel room that seemed straight out of the 1940's with little or no updating. It was clean enough and interesting in it's own way. I have been to a wedding here that was extraordinarily well done but also filled with peculiarities related to the policies of the club like the timing of the meals etc... The facilities are beautiful, particularly if you are interested in a very traditional facility and willing to work with this rigid staff. This review is primarily of their dining room where they serve dinner. Their prices are high but similar to other restaurants in the area. Several seats have an 11th floor view of Central Park. The service is careful and attentive but surprisingly slow at times. Their menu is limited to 10 or so entrees and a similar number of appetizers/salads and desserts. They are traditional American meat and seafood dishes. They were prepared and served in a traditional fashion and were probably comparable in quality to most major high end steakhouse chain restaurants. The real gem in this kitchen is the bakery. At the wedding I attended, they produced some very good cakes (cheesecake) and carrot cake and the breads they served at dinner included an excellent cheese flatbread and olive bread. While you have to be a member, so for most people you can't just drop in, I would recommend that if you are a member or you get invited, you fill up on the breads and forget the entrees. Overall, a mixed review for a place that has a lot of dimensions, a lot to like (or at least appreciate historically) and a lot of annoying rules and traditions that can make it stuffy and even painful to deal with.",10,2,
47,Henry H.,"New York, NY",110,93,0,4.0,1/28/2010,"This place has a really cool, old school motif. There's nothing wrong with that. While it may need some updating, the time I've spent that is great. There is a little bit of an exclusive air to the place, but if you're willing to be social with the people who work there, you can pretty much do what you want. They're all willing to help you out with things you need and they have some pretty cool stories also.If you're just coming from work, this is a great place to relax.",4,,
48,Kate T.,"Portland, OR",32,434,12,2.0,10/3/2008,"If you pay enough for your room, you can get an amazing view of central park. That's pretty much the only good thing i can say about this venue as a hotel.The rooms are cramped, which is interesting given that they're not all that small for NYC. It's just that for some reason NYAC feels compelled to put several chairs, and perhaps a sofa, in each room regardless of the square footage.They have a strict dress-code, militantly but inconsistently enforced. One day i was there in slacks and a sweater and was tersely told that i couldn't go into the main lobby to reach my room, but should instead take the stairs up to the third floor and from there take the casual-attire elevator the rest of the way (and i like to think it takes some balls to tell a pregnant woman to take the stairs). The next day, in slacks and a sweater, i was greeted politely as i walked in through the front door.And, of course, my greatest hotel pet peeve: if i put the goddamn Do Not Disturb sign on my door, it means don't bloody disturb. It doesn't mean that housekeeping should wait until i leave, then sneak in and move stuff around. It means don't open the goddamn door. If i'm only there for two nights, i don't need my sheets changed, and i can fold my own towels if i really want to. Why is this so hard for housekeeping to understand? (Maybe it's an east coast/west coast thing, i never have this trouble out west, but constantly in the east.)",15,16,9

I've only eaten here with a friend of my parents, and I am sure the place's illustrious history and other amenities have something going for them, but the restaurant, well, for lack of a more uppity word, sucked. Staff manages to seem at once as if they are hovering and yet still unavailable when needed. Menu is short, simple and heavy on New England pretension and lack of creativity.

There's definitely some parts of the Club that are out of date, and currently the Gym is being renovated; but overall, a good experience especially if you are into sports and are looking for more.

The wait for the elevator is ridiculous because they are so busy with workers and other patrons standing around- while the main elevators are standing idle.  Who dresses up every day?  Most people are dressed to exercise around Central Park or just walking around the city.  The one night we were formally dressed for a wedding, we had to walk down to the Essex House to hail a taxi.",1,,

56,Ren K.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,5.0,6/28/2013,"My wedding was located at this venue on the 9th floor.  Not only was the event spectacular, the service and the help in the months leading up to the event were unparalleled.  Seriously:  I planned my wedding in 6 months from out of state; both myself and my maid of honor were finishing up graduate school at the time, and had such limited time to plan.  The people at the NYAC, especially Catherine F., made planning a breeze. Everything was included in the wedding package which made my life and my husband's life SO much easier.  And on the day things were executed perfectly, with a smile.  The staff was so professional and polite and cheerful.  Really nice people.  AND THE VIEW!!! The venue itself is, as another reviewer said, swanky and elegant - which was awesome, as you really don't need much in terms of decorations.  There is a dress code, but we simply made the wedding black tie optional which let the guests know that it was fancy time.  A fun excuse to get all gussied up :)  As far as value goes, I would not hesitate to recommend this venue.  Any venue of this caliber in NYC will be expensive compared to the national average, but with that in mind, I believe that this is actually a great value. For the price, you get an astounding venue, full service, everything included - the only outside vendor we needed was the florist, and the NYAC recommended a great one who was familiar with the space - so no headaches.  No wedding planner was necessary because there wasn't that much to coordinate. If time is money, the time you save alone is worth it.  Honestly, we were considering a farm wedding upstate - and after adding in all the vendors and everything we'd have to truck in (down to the port-a-potties) - the NYAC was the better deal. The only thing is that you need to have a club member sponsor you to do the event.",4,,2
