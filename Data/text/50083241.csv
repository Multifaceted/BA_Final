0,Nabil V.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,2,0.0,5.0,8/19/2018,"After a bad experience at another shoe repair, I needed a sure thing for my emergency and tried Cobbler Express. My favorite dress boots needed to be completely resoled in less than a day...SCOREThey got all the repairs done SAME DAY. Amazing. And they were busy with other customers while I was there, so I'm sure this was a ""favor"" knowing that I was up against the clock.They walked me through the different soles we could use and the different heels available - I was able to choose quality Italian leather as opposed to the rubber soles so many other repair shops will assume you want. Sure I paid more than some would be willing to, but I prefer repairs over replacements and Cobbler Express made that possible. My shoes look and feel good as ever.BONUSThey also repaired a backpack I love whose strap had come undone. From what I can tell, they did a great job there too. Miracle stuff.",,,

Updated review","Amazing quality of work.No matter what condition shoes you turn in, you'll get a new pair back!Also fantastic customer service. Pick up and drop-off. Extremely accommodating. Been going here since 2012 and will never take my shoes anywhere else.I do have to say it is pricey. BUt you will never be dissappointed with what you get.",1,,
2,Ramon O.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,7/8/2018,Absolutely amazing shop. I've taken a pair of Saint Laurent boots here for complete resoling after the first cobbler ruined the stitching on the sole. They managed to completely repair the botch job incredibly well (and quick too).I've also taken a pair of Saint Laurent Moto boots that had a broken zipper and the sole was completely worn away for repairs and comeback to find these beat boots had new life breathed into them!,1,,
3,Marie S.,"New York, NY",278,122,165,5.0,9/20/2018,"I had slight damage to one of the heels of my Louboutin and the red on the bottoms was starting to scratch off. So happy to find this place! They did a great job shinning my shoes and adding rubber soles to the bottom that matched the rest of the shoe perfectly! I could've picked up my shoe next day, but it didn't work with my work schedule. Very happy with the results and will be taking all my shoes here!",2,,2
4,B W.,"New York, NY",0,11,0,1.0,11/15/2018,"I brought my watch here for a battery replacement. I should have turned away as soon as I stepped in. Whoever was working the counter was very rude and wanted to charge me $5 for just removing the backpiece of my watch on top of $10 for the battery. I was in a need for a working watch so I decided to stay.He did not have the proper removal tool and ended up scratching my watch then loses a few of the screws in the process then blames me for his mistake. But, wait there's more...as soon as the battery and backpiece was reassembled, I see one of the interior pieces was not inserted so he had to redo everything over. He was also very reckless with the placement of the watch as it kept banging on the counter. My time was limited due to work and he wanted me to stick around to find the missing screws. So inconsiderate!I ended complaining but still got charged the full amount. In conclusion, stay away because this store is a a total rip off. They should remove their services for watch repairs because that's how much they suck at it.",1,,

6,Jenn F.,"Philadelphia, PA",243,35,16,5.0,8/20/2018,I needed a pair of patent leather shoes stretched last minute. I reached out to Eduard and he responded right away. I dropped the shoes off the next morning and they were ready in 24 hours. Eduard is very nice and explains everything very throughly.  My shoes looked and felt fantastic at my event and I'm so happy With their work and professionalism. Happy I found a great shoe cobbler as I had a great one in Philly. Thank you!,,,
7,Kari F.,"Honolulu, HI",55,7,1,5.0,10/19/2018,"Excellent across the board! Eduard explained all the options without being pushy; only helpful in advising me according to my needs. Even though he said it would be a couple days, he finished the same day. The shoes look brand new. He even gave them the million dollar shine I love! I found my top notch cobbler. He's the only guy I trust with my shoes. I'll be sending him all my shoes from now on, regardless of where I am in the world.",,,
8,Jessica S.,"New York, NY",15,31,5,5.0,7/20/2018,"Incredible service. Paid for the service easily online. Pickup and service was SO affordable for the service they provide. I got my Everlane Modern Oxford shoes stretched (they were originally destroying my ankles and there was no way I was going to naturally stretch them and survive that). They also replaced the very bottom with a black grip (for a nice modern look, but much higher quality!). They DO have a variety of colors and I could have swapped it for the same color but I chose black and I'm glad I did. I am SO SO SO happy I found these guys. It was so easy and the quality is unbelievable.",1,,

10,Gladys N.,"Rahway, NJ",2,48,17,5.0,5/10/2018,"These reviews are absolutely SPOT ON in regards to the craftsmanship of Eduard and his team. I bought two pairs of Louboutins to him, one needing the heel cut down a tiny bit, he did so on the spot and left my shoes looking as if nothing ever  happened! The second and more labor intensive...a pair of pink booties, which the INSIDE heel (metal) broke. Eduard instructed me to contact CL directly and have them ship a heel replacement, FREE! After shipping to him, he was able to completely repair/replace the heel and cover the heel BACK with the original pink suede material (CL discontinued the shoe so did not have the material available)- You CANNOT tell all this was done to the boots, they look absolutely perfect. I will be bringing ALL of my shoes to him going forward!!",1,,1

12,Elvi A.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,2,3,5.0,5/23/2018,This is the first yelp review I have ever written but the shoe repair job was too good not to mention. Really quick and awesome! I came in with a pair of Louboutins and I wanted red rubber sole added to the bottom. After 30 min they were ready to pickup! I've gone to this place 3 times and was very impressed each time! Believe me you can trust your designer goods with cobbler express!!,,,
13,Michael B.,"Hoboken, NJ",222,20,4,5.0,7/31/2018,"These guys do great work. I have a few belts that were too large, they unstitched and restitched them perfectly at a very fair price. Other cobblers told me this was too much work and it's best to just make new holes in a belt that is too big. Really happy with the work they do here. Great shoe shine also. Thanks guys.",,,
14,Trish W.,"Ridgefield, CT",2,10,4,5.0,3/15/2018,"After bringing in a pair of boots and a really nice bag, I think I can vouch for Cobbler Express. The soles on the boots were separating, apparently because they were stored in a too warm closet. Who knew? They look pristine now. The bag handle was coming apart. I had two choices: glue or a visible stitch. While admittedly, this was not on a par with Sophie's Choice, two people there discussed the best solution. I took Edward's advice and the stitch turned out to be barely visible. He even removed a mystery mark from the back of the bag (difficult to do with ostrich leather) and restored the color from the cleaned spot with his magic color spray - all without charging for cleaning it. They really care. I am definitely a repeat customer!",,,
15,Ashley M.,"New York, NY",47,13,0,4.0,2/26/2018,"First off, they did a fabulous job not just resoling my boots, but also patching a hole in another pair of boots and putting sturdy leather on the back of my sneakers that were cutting into my heel.Second, the guys are really friendly and knowledgeable. But they may not call you when your shoes are done, so don't be afraid to give them a ring after a day or two. But that's just classic nyc being busy.Third, the shop is a nightmare to find if you come up via wall st. But the window is easily seen from pine. Its worth the wandering, confusion and asking for where these guys are. Once you find it you'll never forget!My soon to be dead favorite shoes now have a new lease on life. I couldn't be happier!",,,
16,Nina L.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,7/26/2018,"This place is amazing! They saved my designer shoes which I thought were beyond repair - a pair of suede wedges that I had worn out in a thunderstorm and were covered with rain stains and falling apart by the time I got home. Eduard and Ruben took them in, and quickly restored them to brand new (a huge feat considering they were nude suede). I used to go to Leather Spa, but Cobbler Express is cheaper, quicker, and more effective - I am taking all of my shoes here from now on!",,,

18,ChingWa C.,"Manhattan, NY",140,164,271,3.0,9/27/2016,"Came here to get my heel tips replaced. It was $14, and I think that's market price in this area. When I first took it in, he asked if I just wanna wait 5 mins and I can have my shoes back right away. I was like yea that's fine. A few minutes later, he was done, and I checked the heels, and I saw that the pins were bigger than the heel base. He took it back and reshaved them, and now the pins are too thin that I can see the metal part of it.He said ""yea this is why I try not to shave too much of it"", well, the left shoe was fine, so obviously he was just careless on the right shoe. The cobbler seems like a good guy, but I am just really upset :( But it's whatever, I'll probably replace them in a few more months.",1,,

I had 2 minor issues that I came in with, and they fixed one of them in about 1 minute, and said I didn't need to worry about fixing the second issue yet until it got worse.

Hysterically crying, I emailed Cobbler Express at 9pm at night and received an immediate response. I came in the next day and they fixed my shoes right then and there in under 10 minutes for an incredibly reasonable price!! This was no easy fix, this required a lot of work and a shoe miracle!!

I knew it would require really great skills and effort to fix / repair the heel, since it looks like it's made a little differently from ordinary shoes. Having been here once before and having seen the quality of work, I decided to come here again and see what magic they can do for my shoes. Result? Could not have been more happy! Although the heel color doesn't match (mustard yellow shoes, blackish heel), I was fine with it. I'm not that picky about matching colors for my shoe bottoms. The service was really great, they're super friendly and the quality of their  work speaks for itself. Would highly recommend!!! The cost for my fix was $26. I'm not sure if that's expensive or not, but I was more than happy to fork it over given that they extended the life of my favorite pair of expensive comfort shoes. :)",,,

Nothing major, Charles Jourdain but the style and heel were theeeeee best! I was devastated when they broke on NYE. And Cobbler Express bought them back to life! THANK YOU! Highly recommended.

Updated review","This place is a little gem. I live in Murray Hill, but they've relocated to 60 Wall Street. However, the owner offers a mobile service, which is just amazing. Living in Manhattan, I got used to a certain kind of life. I have a laundry service so my laundry and bring it to my doorman, I order my dinner, my groceries, my clothes, and I even have in-home massages. And now to have a cobbler come to your door, pick up your shoes, and deliver them back to you In a few days, I was thrilled. And if I didn't want to wait, I could just hop on the 6 train and go to his shop downtown. Now that we are passed the great location and delivery service, let's talk quality. I had them stretch out a pricy new pair of boots I bought. I was a little nervous, because these boots did not come cheap. I also had a very old pair of black suede boots that were a little grimy, the heels were completely worn down, and the suede seemed irreparable. Two days later, Eduard dropped off my boots and I'm still in awe. My Black boots look brand new and the boots I had stretched fit me like a glove. His quality of work is seriously some of the best in Manhattan. Highly recommend!",1,,

42,Claire F.,"Brooklyn, NY",434,683,203,1.0,2/16/2016,"In reply to the owner: basically what the owner is saying is I was overcharged, because I was rung up for $137.80.Since I'd last been here (in 2014) there are new owners. It's not the Latino guy anymore--he rescued my calfskin over the knee boots that I am still wearing/are still going strong, which is why I came back to this spot with a brand new pair of Frye boots. The current owners are quite smarmy and made rude and sexist remarks, like ""women should only wear dresses"" that were off color at best. One of the couple of times I had to go back for the same job, I was kept waiting as one of the guys ""took a call from a lady in Dubai who's obsessed with my work"". I can't... Worst of all, they overcharge like crazy. I know it's midtown but $30 per boot to stretch it?? And adding a rubber sole to brand new shoes $40/shoe? Outrageous. The work was fine, a bit of stray glue here and there and some crackle marks where boots were stretched. For those prices though you'd expect perfection. Won't be back.",7,1,2

(1) Boot alternation (specifically on calves): I brought in a pair of expensive over the knee boots to Cobbler Express to have the calves taken in. At first, I was pretty nervous because of the lack of reviews on this specific type of alternations on Yelp. But a week later, I went back to pick them up, and I'm very impressed with the result. The part that impressed me the most is not just how perfect the boots look on the outside, but also inside the boots. When I flipped the calves inside out, they look exactly like original even though no one will be able to see them. This is how professional and attentive Cobbler Express is! For those who needs to have your boots taken in, here are the photos of the ""before and after"" of the impressive alternation Cobbler Express did on my boots. Pictures don't lies. (2) Adding protective soles : Job was done in 15 minutes. And no surprise there, they were done beautifully! (3) Bonus : They even added the toe plate on my expensive boots for free!  Thank you Cobbler Express for the amazing job done!",6,,
49,Gabbie C.,"Charlottesville, VA",121,17,0,5.0,3/26/2018,"AMAZING cobbler! I could not recommend more. They're so fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. The place is a bit hard to find, off to the east side of the atrium of 60 Wall Street/70 Pine Street (I think), closer to the Pine Street side. I dropped off a pair of boots on Friday afternoon for new heels and got a call a couple hours later that they were already done! I had just gotten the boots three months before but daily wear in the snow had left the wooden heels worn down almost to the sole in parts. I ended up paying more than I expected because they showed me that I also needed to replace the soles too, but they gave me a discount (they replaced the soles and heels and cleaned them for $76, which he normally said would be about $15 more). I could not be happier. I'm planning to bring them in again in a couple weeks to get taps on them so the heels don't get worn down. Come here - you won't regret it!",,,

I showed it to the guy behind the desk and he said they didn't do it, although it was not like that when I left it. I was told it's impossible for them to have damaged the watch because they open it on the other side but I've never had the battery replaced and it wasn't there prior to be bringing it in.

I don't have particularly fancy shoes like many of his customers, but I had broken zippers on a favorite backpack and boot that multiple other shoe and luggage repair shops had turned away. He was not only unphased by the repairs, he did both on the spot. You will pay a little more than you do for the guy on your corner, but the job will get done, and will get done right.

Work done:1) Patent leather Louboutins I've had them sitting unworn in my closet for close to a year because every time I'd put them on, my toes would scream in pain. Yeah.. I bought my first pair of Louboutins in a size too small. As in one whole size.    **NOTE: Ladies shopping for patent leather shoes, size up. ALWAYS. Regardless of how often you size down in non patent/regular finish. I've since learnt that patent has the reverse effect upon wearing it. It shrinks and sucks inward rather than stretches. Makes zero sense but if you need a good lesson in designer shoe shopping, see the woman who works at the Louboutin boutique inside Saks 5th. She's helped me a ton (post patent purchase).Mr Express stretched the living daylight out of those puppies and they're PERFECT!! They were a 39 and now they fit like a 40. A patent leather 40 :P He also put a grippy red sole on the bottom - I'd recommend it since the original soles on louboutins are so delicate. (Any dude reading this definitely has the words ""girls are crazy"" going through his head. For your info, men, we are refined beings who appreciate fine art). Total cost: $452) Ferragamo lamb skin handbagI wish I had taken a before and after photo. He doctored my stained bag back to full health!I had let it sit next to a black leather bag overnight and what I discovered in the morning was a black smear across the baby pink front of the ferragamo. Brand new Ferragamo I might add.He had a look at it, buffed it down (yeah I cringed) but then finished it with a custom color spray to match the rest of the bag exactly!You honestly can't tell.

A few days later I came to pick up my shoes and they looked brand new. I was told that they washed my sandals three times to make sure all the stains were removed. Edward was extremely helpful and courteous and made this an excellent experience.

As I'm extremely OCD, I was skeptical but when they gave me the shoes back, I was blown away by the quality of work. The shoes literally looked brand-new and the soles looked great.   This was all done while I waited in about 40 minutes.  Not to mention these guys were extremely personable and talented.

I did not rush the service or anything. i said whenever they are ready since i just bought a new pair to wear anyways.  Well, when i went back to pick them up after about a week, they had trouble LOCATING THE SHOES!  they looked and looked and they finally found them... sitting UNDERNEATH SOMEONE'S DIRTY BOOTS. wtf.  alright now the actual heels -- they put on new heels already... but they sure don't know how to do it professionally. they tried using 5 inches nails pinning down a 1/8 inch heels on the shoes.  the nails WENT THROUGH THE FLATS and inside the actualy inside of the shoe (ie where the foot goes)!!!  ALSO, their placement of nails were absolutely RANDOM ...(vs strategically planned so they will hold up)  they were all over the heels looking like the face of a teenager with bad acnes!  it pretty much looks like an untrained guy trying to use a stapler punching enough staples in there to get the heels on. wtf.

After researching which businesses provided this service, I narrowed my choice down to Cobbler Express due to the reviews. I brought my shoes in on Monday. I requested them to be stretched and sole protectors. I was told that my shoes would be ready either by Wednesday or the following week. I called on Wednesday and they were ready for pickup.

106,Ins D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,6,5.0,4/26/2012,"Since I am a newbie new yorker... it's been a challenge to find a decent shoe repair place - I got my my sandals repaired at Arty's and the next time I wore them they broke. Thanks to Yelp, I found Cobbler Express. I am impressed with their work and so so so glad I have finally found a good shoe repair place!!! :) Ok, I tend to keep all my shoes - even those that are in bad shape so some of these shoes I had kind of put aside - couldn't bear to throw them. In addition, some other ones got abused on the New York streets - I broke a heel, a strap of another came off, the suede material on my heel got ripped in places and the scruff marks magically appeared (hahaha kidding) well I could go on and on. So finally with Yelp's help I found Cobbler Express and Eduard the best shoe repair guy seriously makes miracles happen. My shoes look new!!! Here are details - The middle loop of my Tory Burch wedge sandals came off - gave it to Arty's to fix - next time I wore them it came off whist I was crossing the road - urgh. I went to Edward and he opened up the top sole in front of me to make sure he could repair it - said it would take work since simple gluing did not help - the loop had to be extended and redone, well he  looked inside and said he could repair it. It was $25 ;) and it doesn't look any different. My Manolo's heel was ripped - I could see the five huge nails they used. They are now perfect. Three of my suede shoes (Louboutin, Ferragamo, Jacobs) had bad scruff marks, for two of those the material near the heel had ripped off and another was muddy because I was caught off guard that day (yeah I don't check the weather that much). All look new!I had also taken a Barney's sandal whose side strap had come off - he fixed that right in front on me - I wore them out for six hours running errands later that day and they stayed put :)So in all he repaired seven pairs of shoes, removed scruff marks off another one of my leather shoes, and showed me how to cover up scratches on the heels and added backing to those that didn't have it. I gave my shoes to him on Friday, he had half of them done on Monday and then I  got all the others by Wednesday.Every person that came in (there were several) knew him by name and when he asked about their shoes previously repaired, gave him positive feedback. Ok here I stop my raving!! Next challenge clothing alterations :)",4,,1

He takes pride in his craft, figuring out what's best for the shoe, what needs or doesn't need to be done (he's advised me NOT to do things multiple times), and doing excellent work. He's been in the trade for years, having learned it from his father and taken over the business. I've had a bunch of shoes be fitted with new heels and protective rubber half-soles. I like that they use quality Vibram rubber and that their work always looks well-done and smooth around the edges of the shoe. I've also gotten a pair of boots stretched, which still fit well today.

Ruben has fixed a pair of comfy flats I own already (simple gluing fix, but he did it on the spot so nicely!), and he also replaced the heels of a pair of suede boots I brought in that same day (the heels had always made a terrible clicky noise I hated and were beginning to wear down also).

I brought two pairs of shoes to be re-heeled and they did a very good job. They also did a shoe shine with one pair and it looks good. The work is good, but the customer service was horrible. Please take your shoes elsewhere as these jobs can be done anywhere.I walked in to drop off my shoes one day after work. He takes the woman behind me first because she's just picking up shoes, which I don't mind. She then freaks out because they allegedly spray painted her shoes silver (apparently they were gray) but walks out. Fine.He takes my shoes and is in the middle of marking services down on the paper and pushes a shoe shine on me for extra $. I say ok. The lady comes back and starts freaking out again so he starts speaking to her and ignoring me. He then gives me the entire ticket and goes ""NO NO"" after I try to take it, grabs it back and gives me half. I don't appreciate getting reprimanded for someone else's mistake and I leave while they're yelling at each other.I come back the next day to grab my shoes and present him with the ticket. I pay him the rest of the deposit and he keeps telling me blah blah did such a good job shining my shoes. He then goes ""You should tip him"".I don't mind tipping, but I HATE when people tell me I have to tip. Especially when the shine itself cost money and he pushed it on me in the first place!They did a good job on the work, but customer service was HORRENDOUS. I would give them 1 star but the additional star was for the job they did on my shoes.Normally yelp doesn't lead me astray and I'm really surprised because the rest of these reviews are so good - but that seriously wasn't worth my time, money or annoyed feeling I got whenever I entered the shop.",4,,

Saved me money by suggesting I wait on resoling the whole shoe, and for the time being just put taps to protect the toes.Average: So-so job gluing down and disguising a small-ish scratch with the flap of leather still attached. Came out lumpy/gluey looking. I've had similar issue on other shoes repaired elsewhere both more and less successfully. Turn around time also average. Negative: When I arrived to pick up, he suddenly remembered to put on the taps. It was done very quickly and not a big deal, but should have been complete upon arrival since I'd called ahead to confirm they were done. One tap came loose 10 days later.

I went to Duane Reed and asked where the rubbers were. After the perv stare,  I was told Isle three next to the lubricants.  When I got there, all I found were Trojans. This is when I discovered that the meaning of ""rubbers"" is not the same as it was when I was eight.I googled shoe repair and found this Cobbler Express, only a few blocks from my Lexington Ave hotel.  I called and the knowledgable gentleman working the shoe repair sewing machine and he told me they had all sizes of rubbers.  He asked me how big I was, so I told him I think I'm gonna need extra large rubbers (I wear a shoe size 12).  He told me to come right down and he'd hook me up with some extra large rubbers.  Sure enough, they had a whole wall full of rubbers, which I now know go by the name of ""Totes"".  If you're stuck in NYC without rubbers, I can definitely recommend skipping Bloomingdales and Duane Reed and heading straight to Cobbler Express on E 41st between 2nd and 3rd.",5,14,3

Many a time I've decided on a place, i.e restaurant, service etc.. based on Yelp, and to my detriment, the more Yelping I do, the more disappointment I get! What might seem ""Cheap"" to someone visiting NY from Beverly Hills is definitely not cheap to someone coming from say Queens. Alright so I've come to this place after checking the WONDERFUL reviews and since I had bought a new pair of expensive shoes, and wanted to extend their lifespan by mounting a rubber pad on the outer sole or whatever you call it. So the place is NEAT and feels more like a lab than a cobbler shop actually, which might be luring to some, but the cobbler there apparently charges based on how much he thinks you make a year, not the real cost of the JOB! He wanted to charge me $70 for an outer sole rubber protector: Me: Wo0w! and that's for one foot I reckon! Cobbler: NO! The whole pair actually. Me: Great! Thanks I'll bring them to you on the afternoon then? (balls***k). Cobbler: Sure! Then rushed outta the place. 4 Blocks away there was a dirty old shop that I found about by mere chance. The cobbler there had the same work done on my shoes for $15, that's 1/5 of the cost. It was a ""made in Italy"" GoodYear rubber and the craftsmanship was fabulous!

After going to one cobbler who said I could leave them and he'd work on them next week (great plan, let the wine stain set even more) and a second who was incredibly rude, I gave Cobbler Express a try.  The guys were very up front about the fact that they probably wouldn't be able to get the stain out completely, but that they would try their best.  Two days later, the stain was still slightly visible but was more than faded enough that I can still wear the boots (in fact, someone asked me the next day if they were new, so clearly no one else notices).

The person who was punching extra holes in my leather backpack straps didn't listen to my instructions properly and punched holes in the wrong places. Once you make that sort of mistake, you can't go back. I asked him (politely) to match the other side with the holes that he made, so at least there would be an aesthetic symmetry to his terrible mistakes. He seemed to hear me, but he didn't oblige. He made the holes on the right side smaller and he made 2 less holes. Then he asked me to pay ""however big my heart was,"" which to be honest, wasn't feeling all that big after he ruined my straps without apology. I've been coming here several times, but have always seemed to miss this man. My dad comes here too and has always had good service. So I went back an hour later and complained.

Then they had to use a harsh cleaner to remove the glue that didn't do the leather any favors.On the Lobbs, all I needed were toe taps.  They used nails that were too big and went through the entire sole and up against the leather of the upper itself.  I have now taken those elsewhere to be fixed.So now I can't trust them to do basic preventative care without damaging my highest quality shoes.

I took them to Cobbler Express and the next day I picked up shoes that looked like they'd just come out of their box. I had protective soles put on them and they've worn beautifully with virtually no wear ever since. Speedy service. Nice staff that don't give you the runaround. Very fair prices.

I was called a couple of hours later to say they were done which was nice. I went in the next day to pick up the shoes and he let me inspect them before I left the store. They did a great job (it seems two men work there, one is a shoe polisher, and the other runs the place/does the fix-it work). Both pairs of my heels look a million times better and no more clickety-clack when I walk around from the nails of the heels hitting the ground.The two were really friendly and the business owner was talkative.

The hole in the patent leather on the toe of my Burberry flats (caused by a classic trip over a jagged pipe) was fixed in a matter of minutes FOR FREE - the only way you can tell there was any work done is by holding the shoe inches away from your face. My Tory Burch flats were a tougher job - the torn up navy leather was too soft to be buffed, and the red elastic trim made things even trickier. Even so, my shoes were returned to me (2 days later) looking WAY better than when I dropped them off, and I got new vibram rubber soles put on to prevent further scuffing.As an added bonus, while I was waiting in the shop, I handed over my boyfriend's worn out Sperrys.

I was really sure I would try out the leather spa despite TONS of horrific reviews - and then I found Cobber Express. The reviews were great so I decided to bring my shoes in and give it a try. I dropped off around 10AM, and picked up two pairs of perfection around 1PM. $35 per pair, in THREE HOURS? No brainer. He also repaired one rip in the leather heel for free!! I was a bit paranoid about the nude patent shoes getting red stains (horror stories online) but he didn't get a spec of red on the shoe. He also had lots of boxes from different designers (Marni, CL, Gucci) clearly they send shoes to him to repair.Bonus: both shoes are MORE comfortable now. The vibram red sole he uses is like a pad to step on. He also added rubber heel bottoms on my black leather pair and they feel way more stable and comfortable.I will be bringing ALL my shoes here!

Updated review","Once again, I've been saved by Cobbler Express! I cannot let go of my brown leather boots, as I love them too much. I went in today fully expecting to need a zipper replacement and admit defeat. But no, the wonderful guy stitched my boots' zippers right in front of me while I watched, and he even glued a few places where the leather was cracking on both of them.I thought I'd have to leave the boots for a few days minimum, but the work was completed in about 15 minutes! The price for such prompt, extensive service? Only $20. I honestly wouldn't trust anyone else to do such a thorough job, and I will happily make the trek across town to visit Cobbler Express the next time I need a repair.",8,,2

178,Richard D.,"Paramus, NJ",0,1,0,2.0,12/7/2010,"I found this place by following yelp's 5-star rating of 15 review cases. The only reason I am reviewing Cobbler Express now is because my experience said otherwise. If you have been to Cobbler Express and like the services there, shalom. If you are thinking about going to Cobbler Express for your first shoeshine there, may my experience provide you data for some background thoughts. Here are some things which I agree with the other reviewers: 1. The guy is a good communicator 2. Price is reasonable (well, it's all relative, but I got my wife's boots' heel pad replaced for $30, original agreement included a shine) 3. Geographically conveniently located two avenue blocks from Grand Central (~6.5 mins walk from GCS) Here are some things I do disagree with the other reviewers: 1. The guy is honest (I was informed that a pair of heel pads - not heels - cost the owner $25, and he was making nothing) 2. Promises are carried out (I was promised that the pair of boots will be shined with the heel fix - they weren't, and the guy denied the shoe shine part until I pulled out my portion of the record - so make sure you make them write down everything - if they say ""like new"", ask them to write down ""like new""; if they say ""leather treatment"", write them down on your ticket and theirs) 3. Fix is seamless (I notice abrasion on both pair where the heels meet the boots, as if some one filed off slightly larger heel parts to fit the body of the boots. This is fine if necessary as part of the fix process, what I do not appreciate is that the gentleman totally denied having anything to do with those abrasion marks. For your reference, the physical location of these marks are symmetric on the pair.) 4. Shoes will be like brand new (I was told by the gentleman that unless you brought in new shoes, no shoes would look new even after he shines them, mine certainly did not.) 5. Turn around time is brief (I dropped off one pair of my wife's boots on a Thursday morning, and the gentleman asked me to pick them up the next Tuesday evening) 6. He will call you (He did not call me, I called them and they do not recognize my order, I showed up and it took them a few minutes to dig out my wife's boots, after several attempts they also could not locate my record on their order book) 7. All of the good communication skills will be used to serve you, the customer (When I pointed out that the boots weren't shined as promised, rather than shining them, the guy spent 10 minutes trying to convince me that they are indeed shined, and instead I have very old worn out boots - I responded by common sense, if they are worn out, would I be willing to pay for a heel fix? I then told him that I do not declare shined boots unshined, and I have never failed to pay any of my 100 shoe shiners ever.) 8. The good business is due to hard labor (partially true, but this shop is on the first floor of the building of Anglo Irish Bank, directly beside the security desk, you tell me where you want your shoes shined if you work in the building. 30 floors * 100 person / floor * 2% shoe request / person / day = 60 requests per day, that's roughly half a million dollars revenue a year from that building alone) Do not take me wrong here folks. I am willing and I did pay $30 for the heel pad fix. The fix was not seamless, but it was done (time will tell the quality). I think I got a $10-$15 worth of service, but hey every business has margins. I have never been seriously dissatisfied by any service line business, but two-stars are given here for moral hazards - to me a cobbler's great communication skills may not be always in your favor, and wasting my 30 minutes for saving a shine might be a little excessive. Finally, a five-star, or any-star business should at least hold up to some levels of integrity.",13,1,3

(In my experience, tailors boost their quotes based on the cost of the merchandise; similar repairs at other tailors started at $30, no matter how minor they seemed.) Well, that was nowhere near the case! The owner saw me immediately, quoted an unbelievably affordable price, AND hand stitched the bag himself (even throwing in a little glue for good measure)...

189,J. H.,"New York, NY",0,25,3,2.0,8/6/2012,"I stopped coming to this place for a while because a couple winters ago I brought in some boots to have the zipper fixed. The zipper was separating from the boot and needed to be sewed down so I can zip them up and down. The zipper broke off very easily though in a couple days. So I brought the boots in again and he seemed very annoyed instead of saying sorry that it broke that fast. So they fixed it again for me. It broke yet again, so I brought it in again. He was very standoffish when I brought the boots back. I couldn't understand why he would be frustrated when I'm the one paying for something that didn't work.I even tipped him when really I should have not cause I had to bring in the boots again two more times. He didn't even thank me when I tipped him and any normal customer would not have done that. You don't pay anything more for when something isn't done correctly. So I finally came back after being away from this place for a while. I brought in three pairs of shoes. To one pair he said he can't stretch shoes that are not real leather. For the second pair, he quoted me $50 to fix those and I know that was not right because I had come in with the same problem with another pair before and was not charged that price. I can agree with a reviewer below who felt like they charge based on what they think you will pay. I don't find this practice fair. For the third pair, he fixed the heels. I got them back and noticed when I got home that the strap of the shoe that buckles was torn for some reason. I called and asked about that because I had never seen that tear before. He got very impatient and argued with me about it. I never went back cause I remembered how I was treated when they made a mistake on my boots.I brought the shoes that he said he won't be able stretch to another cobbler who stretched them for me for a good price and they fit fine. I also brought in the pair he quoted $50 for me to the other place and they fixed them up perfectly for much less.I'm sad that it didn't work out here. As a customer, I like to feel that people are being up front, fair and honest about prices. I also like when a place of business is helpful when mistakes are made. I also don't like when someone picks and chooses if they want to work on my shoes when I'm paying for a service.**UPDATE: the owner ALWAYS leaves defensive owner comments as you see below, blaming the customer.

What a great surprise! So far it seems like the guys there did a great job - they had to completely resole my favorite pair of boots, and they feel great. The only downside is that they used a lot of glue (which I think is typical), but it got all over the front of the leather and left streaks. They polished over it so you can't really tell unless you're up close, but I can see it, and it's pretty unfortunate that a very nice pair of boots made of sleek black leather now has streaks on the front of each shoe. I have yet to try out the pumps that they added rubber bottoms to, but they look great and overall, I'm pleased with my experience, and I would probably bring stuff back here for general repair.",,,
