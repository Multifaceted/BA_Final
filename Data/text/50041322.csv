The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is very chill. I love coming here after work for the Oyster Happy Hour (5pm-7pm, EVERY DAY). The oysters are only a buck during that time. You cannot beat that! The drinks are also pretty good. I usually get a margarita (approx $9). They also have an excellent wine selection.I was here 2 evenings ago for happy hour and I ordered a dozen oysters (chefs selection), fries, and drinks. No complaints here. If you are ever in the UWS stop in for happy hour, brunch, lunch, or dinner!",1,,
1,Greg M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/8/2018,"Outside of the hostess and the bartender this was one if not the worst experience I and or my friends had.  Our waitress (Emily .P) was absolutely terrible:1) our glass of water was empty and she proceeded to pour water at each of the customers sitting next to us 2) we had to flag another waiter multiple times to look for her for one request or another we made (condiments, extra water, missed items in our order etc)3) she forgot our beverage order but people who sat after us received their order before us4) we waited a significant time just to place our initial order, but she immediately served everyone around us 5) she served everyone around us bread but she apparently decided not to serve us anyWhat's sad is that we've been to their midtown location and had a great experience; secondly, which I'm reluctant to point out but bears mentioning our waitress (Emily P.) is white, everyone she so attentively served was white - we are not.  To feel utterly discriminated on at a restaurant in NYC in 2018 is beyond disheartening!!!",1,,
2,Alex D.,"Cortlandt Manor, NY",83,13,0,5.0,9/20/2018,"Have been here many times, very good quality, everyone loves what they get.  Especially love the watermelon/feta salad that is seasonal, and the yellowfin tuna entree is fantastic.Love coming for the oyster happy hour, Great deal, great selection, I find it to be one of those special things you get to enjoy, from a great local spot, and great decor on the inside.",,,
3,Vivian C.,"Manhattan, NY",166,84,404,5.0,7/21/2018,"I live closer to the second avenue location, but was elated when I discovered another location!  The upper west side location also includes my favorite happy hour!  Per usual, I ordered a dozen oysters and a fried oyster slider.  It was super yummy.  See my review for the second avenue location.  I echo that review!!!",,,
4,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",366,428,52,5.0,9/6/2018,"This place is head and shoulders above all the places on this very crowded section of the UWS.  Its adult. Its tasty. Its fresh (the food and the atmosphere).  The staff a top-tier and they will keep your glass full and your belly wanting the next order of oysters or fresh fish.  The real winner is happy hour.  Either during the week or early on the weekends.  $1 oysters!  They are very fresh, they are absolutely tasty, they are worth all the change in your change bowl at home.  They have a decent wine list too.  Recommend you get the oysters, hammer some red wine and enjoy yourself.  Best spot in the hood, why not??",1,,
5,Tom L.,"Brooklyn, NY",109,106,847,5.0,8/14/2018,"Crave Fishbar, locations in Midtown and Upper West Side of New York City, is a sustainable, eco-conscious restaurant and bar where you can satisfy your cravings ranging from food to desserts to drinks. To make sure your cravings are satisfied in the best way, Crave commits to sourcing and serving locally caught seafood in a creative manner with fresh and seasonal ingredients. Crave is also the first NYC partner of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch Program, a national leader in ocean sustainability, and also one of the charter members of the JBF Smart Catch Program.Stepping into their Upper West Side restaurant location, you enter a space completely different as portrayed by its simple and modest exterior. The vibe and atmosphere are extremely welcoming and lively. They are very accommodating with the different seating and locations within the restaurant to guarantee a pleasurable experience. You can sit outside, or inside by the bar, or on high chairs at a high table, or at bigger tables a few steps up in the back of the restaurant. The interior design is modern and sophisticated, which helps to enhance the dining experience. The natural light and calm streets become the backdrop for the outdoor dining. The seats at the bar and at the high tables can be a bit cozier with a candle sparking up a more intimate space and experience. The seating in the back accommodates for larger groups with brighter lighting.To start, Crave offers many options within its raw bar and raw & crudo sections of the menu like different kinds of oysters, shellfish and many more. The oysters are superbly fresh and naturally sweet, while the shrimps are extremely firm and bouncy in the texture of every bite. The Yellowfin Tuna Poke has Persian cucumbers, enoki mushrooms, and toasted macadamias mixed with a spicy sauce and topped with fresh chives. The cucumber and macadamias give this appetizer a crunch contrasting the texture of the yellowfin tuna, which was very well seasoned. The spicy sauce provides that extra tang and spice to kick-start the dinner.The Rice Dusted Point Judith Calamari was definitely on point. Despite the crispy exterior, the calamari itself breaks through with its freshness and when paired with mung bean sprouts in a Thai miso sauce sprinkled with Aleppo chili, you have a perfect bite.The Miso Glazed Barramundi, an Australian sea bass, is cooked to perfection with a white miso and honey glaze served over plancha grilled jumbo asparagus in chipotle oil. The saltiness of the miso is flawlessly balanced with the honey and the asparagus, which gives each bite a slight natural sweetness. The overall taste is very charming and leaves you wanting more and more of the fish. The Homemade Squid Ink Spaghetti. mixed with chopped shrimps, leeks and clam stock and topped with Fresno chili, is very flavorful. The spaghetti soaks up the clam stock, which gives it the right amount of moisture, and the shrimps pile on another layer of flavor in addition to the spice that the Fresno chile contributes to the dish.There are other entrees and sides on the Crave menu for whatever you're craving for. The dessert menu is just as impressive, with a sharing size chocolate chip cookie served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, milk and honey - milk chocolate peanut butter cake with honeycomb and drizzled with honey. There's also the Frangelico Tiramisu, Raspberry & White Chocolate Cake, Carrot Cake, and Ice cream & sorbet.It's guaranteed and clearly shown in the food and drink they serve that their commitment to providing and preparing their dishes of the highest quality and keeping the idea of sustainability and integrity. Is it still a craving if it can't be satisfied? Let Crave Fishbar do the trick.",2,,
6,Percy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",417,207,417,4.0,2/1/2018,"This past Sunday I had the pleasure of enjoying a great brunch with friends at Crave Fishbar. Crave Fishbar was not my recommendation but I trusted my friend to pick wisely; besides, I always have Yelp reviews to give me the skinny! Crave Fishbar was a hit. The restaurant is very bright and modern with a cute oyster station that makes the front area pop.  Once our party was seated the waitress prompty took our orders and made us feel extremely welcomed. The restaurant was not crowed and this made the experience that much more wonderful. It appears they have lots of competition in the area. I'm not sure what the other restaurants in the area are giving but Crave Fishbar is holding their own.  This is a side note but I hate having brunch in restaurants where you shout to order and shout just to have a conversation with the person sitting right next to you. It was nice to eat and enjoy the conversation I was having with my friends. Thanks Crave Fishbar,  now back to the meal. I had the fish and waffles and my friends had an assortment of items off the brunch menu. We all had different drinks but I really enjoyed my Apple Sangria. My fish and waffles was fresh and tasty. While eating my meal, I happened to look over the dinner menu. Apparently, they have jerk ribs. I asked the waitress about this and she shared that Crave Fishbar use to be a BBQ spot and management decided to pay homage to BBQ by keeping at least one BBQ item on the menu. Being a lover of BBQ, Oysters and fish, I'm shall return.",2,,2
7,Lu H.,"New York, NY",288,552,1933,5.0,1/7/2018,"Review is for happy hour only. I've been here twice, both for happy hour. In my opinion, it has the best happy hour oyster deals - $1 per oyster and you can choose any from their daily fresh oyster menu. A way better deal than some places that only give you one type of oyster for hh. We've also tried their fish slider, burger slider, calamari from their happy hour. All three were very solid options and my favorite was the calamari. Service here was always friendly and accommodating. It's surprisingly baby friendly as well, at least during happy hour and early dinner times. Will definitely be back.",9,5,9
8,Laurie E.,"Manhattan, NY",159,55,125,5.0,7/23/2018,"Omg, so beyond amazing!!!You can smell the fresh seafood the minute you step inside this awesome restaurant!! They have the best oyster happy hour in the city!For other appetizer options, I recommend the calamari or octopus. For main courses, their Swordfish was scrumptious, as was their squid ink pasta.Don't skip on dessert, especially the carrot cake!!Very lovely staff. They were very attentive, especially given how crowded it was at the time.",,,1
9,Julian K.,"Bronx, NY",5,39,6,3.0,11/12/2018,"I wasn't crazy about the drinks. They didn't have any of the beers that I like to drink. The mixed drinks were ok. I ordered the fish and waffles which was decent, nothing to write home about. I'll order something else next time. Other than that the service was excellent.I might try the Black spud ink spaghetti and shrimp on the next outing but Im not sure when I'll return here.",,,

Updated review",Hot food was ok. Oysters were great service was better. Why 3 stars? Looked to my left saw a huge waterbug not roach WATERBUG. Concering because kitchen is in lower level.  Bug probably came from stairs. Ether way a Waterbug should not be in a restaurant. Especially since we were in the back nowhere near a door.,2,,
11,Eric H.,"New York, NY",184,166,310,5.0,7/12/2018,"Still reading? Good! Upon walking in you are immediately hit with the smell of fresh oysters which makes you feel like you're by the ocean. The decor here is elegant and the perfect ambiance for dinner, happy hour, or a date. The wine selection is excellent to pair with their fresh and delicious seafood. I highly recommend starting out with the baby octopus which is grilled to perfection and extremely tender. The Swordfish was incredible, absolutely delicious. If you're in the Upper West Side, this is a must try. Great service and the owner Jason is a cool dude!",,,
12,Ryan H.,"Manhattan, NY",92,40,2,3.0,11/6/2018,Why was the calamari awful? It's really sad when everything else is great but then one terribly expensive and breaded calamari just wrecks your experience.,,,
13,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,3.0,4/16/2018,"I had Crave on my radar for some time: as most of my sushi reviews can attest, I'm always on the hunt for a superb seafood restaurant, especially one that's so close to my new apartment. But, while the food at Crave was definitely tasty, it was a bit overpriced for the portions. To put it concretely, an appetizer, two drinks, one salad, and one entree rang us to about $115. Insert sad face, typical rant about Manhattan prices and Manhattan rent ruining all the good there is in the world. On a beautiful Saturday evening, Crave was hopping. The interior looks right out of the rustic section of Anthropologie's home decor catalog: lots of candles, wooden frames, etc. Both the atmosphere and the menu work in all situations: first/second/third dates (including the table next to us), meals with parents, girls' night out, birthday spots, boozy brunches. For anyone who hates seafood, the menu has pasta, filet mignon, and fried chicken (which, actually, all sounded pretty good). We had arrived too late to take advantage of the daily HH $1 oysters, which is a fantastic deal (M-F 5-7, S-S 4-6), and were starving. The menu spells out how if you want carbs, you're going to have to ask for their house-made whole wheat bread. I thought this was pretty smart, as not everyone eats bread, so why offer something that might go to waste? Well, we ate bread. Theirs was so good that it prompted my boyfriend to ask if they ever sold it. He believed it to be the highlight of the meal. Drinks were nice and strong: I favored the apple cinnamon sangria (but quite heavy on the cinnamon). We went with the calamari, the salmon sashimi salad, and the salmon entree. I will say that the food came out extremely quickly: not five minutes after we placed our orders, the calamari came out. Some pieces were a little rough and chewy, and the mung beans and spice, while an interesting attempt at a Thai-style twist, didn't go that well with the calamari. The portion also was a bit small for $15. The sashimi salad is a good idea if you're in the mood for something light. What was even lighter was my boyfriend's salmon - a small, thin piece that we ate in a few bites. The best part were the sides that came with it: a kind of puree that reminded me of a cross between apple sauce and sweet potatoes (but actually ended up being parsnip puree) and roasted mushrooms. We decided to grab dessert elsewhere so I may come back just for that. While the food didn't blow me away for the price point, the diversity of the menu, the HH deals, and the overall catch-all appeal to any particular situation may mean some return trips in the near future.",10,4,8
14,Christine X.,"Manhattan, NY",357,80,43,3.0,5/12/2018,"Summary: Amazing for happy hour oysters, overpriced for everything else. Happy hour oysters are fantastic, only $1 each and they have a great selection! Calamari and tuna poke were delicious but expensive ($17 and $18).Unfortunately, I was not pleased with the rest of the food. Don't know what happened with the barramundi but it was so overly salted that I gagged. The tuna, on the other hand, had the opposite problem in that it lacked flavor. Love the ambiance of this place. Wish the prices were cheaper and the food was better.",1,,
15,Michael A.,"Brooklyn, NY",266,52,54,5.0,9/1/2018,"What a great dinner at a perfect spot! So first for the boozy brunch bunch: they have dollar oysters and unlimited cocktails from 11:30-3:30 Sat & Sun!!! Just sayin. So the dollar oyster special is everyday from 5-7 and it is amazing! You can get any oyster on the menu for a buck unlike some places where it's a dollar but they give you whatever. This keeps us coming back. I really like the uws spit better than their other place I've been to. We got James as a server and I won't be sitting in anyone else's section from now on. He was funny, helpful, and very knowledgeable. The place gets packed fast so get best if you make a resy. Definitely going back.",,,
16,Upper W.,"New York, NY",21,27,916,1.0,8/14/2018,"This place is basically a want-a-be Mermaid Inn... but FAR from it. From the moment we walked in we could tell something was off. Although it was a quiet Sunday and we had a reservation, it took the host awhile to acknowledge us, decide where we were going to sit and then to organize the menus...There was also a strong fishy smell--I know, it's a seafood place but this was not a normal seafood smell. I've sat in front of many raw bars and they smelled nothing like this.Anyway, aside from the happy hour food/drink special which had a fairly limited selection, the main menu was quite pricey. I tried to order a blueberry Fauxjito but was informed they were out, no problem, I ordered the fresh watermelon juice. My husband ordered a Dirty martini, no vermouth, pretty straightforward. The drinks took forever to come and when they did, my husband's drink was wrong, it was just a regular martini so back to waiting some more...My watermelon juice was really lacking. I've had fresh watermelon juice and it's fantastic, this was definitely watered down as if it were 75% water and 25% juice--at $9 per glass they ought to be ashamed.  I tried the beef slider, oyster slider and a fish taco and they were all truly marginal. The oyster slider had a strange taste to it, like they used an odd overpowering seasoning. I also didn't finish them. The buns which are supposed to be soft and buttery were dry and a overly-charred. My husband had the yellowtail sashimi dish and it was just okay. The only good thing we had was a side of french fries. We couldn't wait to leave and ended up going to another restaurant for a much more pleasant experience. If you are on the fence, do yourself a favor and just book a table at Mermaid Inn, you will be so happy that you did.",,1,
17,Caroline B.,"Manhattan, NY",167,30,51,5.0,3/9/2018,"First time here! EMILY our server was fantastic! She recommended on our first round of oysters to try a little of everything so we could see what we liked for the second round. They didn't disappoint. Good call. I recommend the blue point and the moo moo. Unlike other oyster happy hours in the city you can select from the whole oyster menu at $1 a piece. HH goes till 7 but you can probably get a seat last minute at the bar if you are running down the clock. Great staff, awesome oysters can't wait to go back!",1,,1
18,Christopher S.,"New York, NY",99,42,11,5.0,7/26/2018,"Great food. Amazing service. An INCREDIBLE happy hour esp if you love oysters!

20,Minjoo P.,"Allendale, NJ",59,24,99,4.0,4/21/2018,"My friend and I wanted to do a oyster happy hour in the city so we found this place and drove into the city just for the happy hour. Our reservation was at 6:15 and we arrived at 6:30. We were nervous that we wouldnt be seated right away (happy hour is from 5-7), but we were able to get seated right away and our server came right over to get our order a dozen of oysters with cocktails. We ordered fried oyster sliders, burger sliders, calamari, a doze of oysters, and four cocktails. Everything was delicious; the only downside is that it took a while for us to get our oysters. We ended up eating all the food first and had oysters as dessert.Pro: Friendly staff, nice ambience, delicious food, offers a dozen different types of oystersCon: You can only order a dozen of oysters at a time (for a party of 1-2 people) and must clear the oysters before ordering the next round, so we only got to order one round of oysters during happy hour (it took about 30 minutes for our first round of oysters to come to our table).",,,
21,Nina K.,"New York, NY",400,24,4,4.0,8/11/2018,"What an excellent meal. My boyfriend and I went here for our 6 month anniversary, and we had a great time. We started off with $1 oysters during happy hour, which were fresh, crisp and satisfying. We tried the fried calamari which was good, but a bit heavy. The restaurant was able to cook a wide variety of food well, from jerk spare ribs to lobster curry, although the recommended side of rice was not good (very dry). I ordered the watermelon strawberry sangria, which was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the margarita, which was generous with the tequila! Overall, it was a pricey, but a spacious venue with hearty portions, friendly service, and stylish decor.",,,

24,Dave G.,"New York, NY",55,233,0,5.0,9/7/2018,"So I've been to this place before but not the upper West side location. We came in at happy hour and started with a dozen oysters. We had a mix and they were all fresh and delicious. We really liked the Montauk and The Rock oysters as they were very briny. For dinner we got the lobster curry and the black squid ink spaghetti with shrimp. My date loved the lobster curry... I thought the lobster was a slightly overcooked and the broth wasn't that flavorful until oddly the very end. It was also like a bowl of soup. So in reading some of the other reviews we were going to get the rice, but many said it wasn't good and it's also 8$ for a side of rice. So we ate it like a broth and as I said my date really loved it. The squid ink spaghetti was amazing! So flavorful and delicious we couldn't stop raving about it. Service was good and my date didn't like the wine choices so she brought her a glass of Cabernet and charged us for the happy hour price which was very nice. Overall a great experience, I highly recommend this place!",,,
25,Alisa Z.,"Orange, CA",194,315,66,5.0,4/22/2018,"I love the oyster happy hour- $1 oysters of at least 12 different varieties, you could even get one of each type if you want.

26,Lindsay F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",28,41,21,4.0,4/6/2018,"Crave is always consistent. We came right after happy hour was finishing. Missed it by 10 minutes or so. Bummer. But still the food is great and sometimes it just takes awhile for your oysters to arrive during happy hour or close to it! Regulars should know this! There was a couple next to us but complaining about how slow their service was and that they were regulars. If they were regulars they would know sometimes the oysters take some time. Relax. Felt bad for our poor waiter who was getting so much attitude from them. He was working hard and they were a bit under staffed. It is what it is! If you aren't an oyster person. Or aren't sure if you are, come for happy hour and enjoy 1$ oysters that are SO good! Also can't beat the GF calamari (wahoo didn't even know it was possible!). They do have some great GF options, which is awesome!",3,1,1
27,Stephanie S.,"Clifton, NJ",744,684,1735,4.0,9/27/2017,"Love. This. Place. Every time I come here I always enjoy myself. They have a delicious variety of oysters that come out on a lovely ice tray. Ask the waiter/waitress what they recommend, it's usually good! We loved the Moondancer oysters. In addition to the oysters I usually start with a beer and oyster shooter shot.The last time we came here we ordered the octopus (just OK), seafood salad sliders and burger sliders (WOW) both were amazing, but the seafood slider wins.The Thai fried calamari is perfectly battered and lightly fried. The only downside is they do not give enough sauce, so I would recommend asking for extra on the side. Dessert: The Milk and Honey cake is a must order. Overall, albeit a bit pricey at times, worth every penny!",2,2,3
28,Nicole C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,129,1,2.0,8/28/2018,"I've been on an oyster binge over the last month, so I have a lot of places to compare this place to concerning oysters.I went early Saturday afternoon. I ordered six each of two kinds of their HH oysters and a cocktail. The cocktail was OK although I'll get to more on that later, but (i) they took about 35-40 minutes to serve me the oysters (which is absurdly long considering the bar wasn't very busy) and (ii) when the oysters arrived one kind tasted fishy, like, to the point that the lemon juice and cocktail sauce couldn't mask it. I didn't get sick, so I can't say it was bad, but it was definitely not fresh tasting.With respect to the cocktail, I suffered similar slow service. I finished the cocktail far ahead of when they brought out the oysters, and no one checked on me to see if I needed a refill, until the guy washing the cups and plates at the bar noticed I was just looking around and asked me if I needed anything. Lastly, the place smelled a little like a fish market combined with bleach. Given I've tried numerous other oyster bars (so far my faves are Flex Mussels on the Upper East Side and Good Night Sonny), I cannot imagine why I'd come here again for oysters. And, frankly, the fact that their oysters weren't fresh combined with the slightly nauseauting smell of the place and their slow service, I wouldn't come here for anything.",,,

They were sooo good!), crab tostadas (not our fave but still ok) & of course their oysters which were a combo of West/east coast oysters.

I had the breakfast tacos with scrambled eggs, chorizo, queso and picked onions - nice and fresh. My friends had the Lobster cavatelli and the smoked salmon benedict. We were stuffed!

Updated review","The happy hour oysters consistently excellent, and in the last two times we have been there a definite upswing in the quality of the cooked food, the burger slider is nice (ask for mayo-y sauce on side) and the fish fillet sandwich is nice.  And... you know... I was giving them 4 stars, but as long as we are talking about the happy hour, they deserve all 5.Not crazy about the kid's menu, but we learned to eat around it.Also, I like the fact that they hang on to their staff, the British guy is funny and personable, and that other guy too, and the young lady... you get the idea.Outside of Happy Hour...  I am probably with the Milling Room and the Mermaid Inn crowds.",,,

Great ambience and vibe - local, clean, friendly, neighborhoody place - not too upscale/very nice/just right! Our server Eric was spot on from start to finish, instantly friendly, available and totally professional - he had solid opinions from cocktails/wine to every category on the menu and his suggestions were spot on. The prawns, calamari and Brussels sprouts were all really great! Why? They were simple - each was well-seasoned, well-cooked and didn't need to be disquised with a bunch of sauce and/or nonsense. This is clean, straightforward, flavor-forward food with an easy confidence. The menu is not huge and it is clear this chef/restaurant knows who they are, what they do well and no shame in their game. Keep up the great work, and thanks for a great late night bite!!!",,,

Updated review","Love this place. I come here with my girlfriends or my boyfriend. Atmosphere is very nice, service is amazing and the food is great. I always come for happy hour oysters and wine. Oysters are always amazing. I am not sure if the chef changed but my last dinner was just ok. I still enjoyed oysters but main dishes were just ok. Salmon dish was below ok and I was really disappointed. It was just a very small piece of fish without any veggies. Really bad! My favorite desert was always homemade cookie. This time it was just dry and nothing special. This is one of my favorite places in the city and I am upset about my last experience so not sure if will return.",1,,

So the tables and chairs were wobbly. Infact, everyone was dropping their silver ware. It was a bit annoying. Will say, sitting so close to people, we did engage in nice conversation with people!! We actually arrived a few minutes before the Oyster Happy Hour ended!  We ordered 8 west coast oysters. They were good. We ordered the tuna tartar, fried calamari, and the Burrata!

Upper West Side location is Crave Fishbar's newer location, therefore, my companion and I decided to check it out for tonight's dinner. After all, it is his birthday! I am so in love with their decor. It was super relaxing, comfortable, and casual. Its atmosphere reminded me of dining outside on a beach broad walk or on a cruise ship. For now, it is much more peaceful and quiet than its hectic, crowded original location in Midtown. It is still a secret! Happy Hour East and West Coast Oysters are $1.00 from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm here! Check it out!My companion and I made it for Happy Hour. Yay, us! Availability of oysters depends on the season. Platters of oysters came with lemons, limes, and grapefruit! Like what they said on their window, #oystergram worthy! Our favorite one tonight was the East Coast Beausoleil oyster from New Brunswick, Canada. It starts with a forward briny taste and a sweet finish. From the West Coast, we enjoy the Totten Inlet from Washington, it was briny with a bit of watermelon accent per the description. It was refreshing! We also got the Apple Cider Sangria and Berry Lemonade to go with our oysters! For dinner entrees, we got the Monday Special, French Dinner and the infamous Handmade Squid Ink Spaghetti. French Dinner -  Steak and frites with half a dozen of mussels. Sautéed purple onions over a fresh piece of steak, simply perfect. Frites were seasoned with sea salt topped with chives. For the mussels, we went with the original French-style; shallot, white wine, tomato, and butter. The sauce was really good that I wished that we had more homemade sourdough bread to soak it up!Handmade Squid Ink Spaghetti - spaghetti had a super bouncy texture and clam stock was full of flavor. There was a generous amount of chopped shrimp in every bite. To my surprise, it was indeed spicy, hence, from the red chili peppers but I love it!

Don't get me wrong the prices for these west coast and east oysters are phenomenal! However; since they already sat us down late, they only allowed us to order one dozen of oyster at a time. My boyfriend and I are both oyster lovers so we came here all for the oyster, sadly the oysters took awhile too prepare and by the time the oysters arrived it was already 7:04 and we couldn't order more.

I would recommend asking for bread and maybe ordering an appetizer or two if you're really hungry. The seafood here is well done which is good because I've been disappointed by so many other seafood restaurants.I would steer you away from the affogato unless you want something extremely light for dessert.

In general, restaurants here tend to be ""very decent"": not bad, but not great. I've visited Crave in Midtown a couple of times and was surprised to see this new location pop up when I was looking for directions. We decided to go since it's much closer and also to check out the consistency between locations.An important thing to note is that unlike the Midtown location, this location has a happy hour that runs from 4-6, NOT 5-7. Unfortunately we did not know this until it reached 6. Our waitress was kind enough to let us know before we ordered another round of oysters, but I wish we had known earlier.OYSTERS:How amazed was I to see Kumamotos on the happy hour menu?! Crave is unique in that it offers a daily rotation of 10-12 oyster varieties for $1 at happy hour. That is, you get to choose from 10-12 varieties EVERY DAY and the varieties change daily. This is unheard of, but I love it! Not only that, but they have both East coast and West coast oysters. We ordered a dozen Kumamotos to start and planned to order a dozen assorted East Coast oysters for our second round (a group of 1-2 can only order a dozen at a time). The Kumamotos were excellent. Fresh, cleanly shucked, and very light. Paired with a crisp white Muscadet, they were a great start. We were excited for the second round, but once we realized it was no longer happy hour, we hesitated to pay 3 to 4 times for the same portion of food (normal oyster prices range from about $3-4).Regardless, I would happily return to Crave for their excellent happy hour oysters and friendly service. Everyone from the hostess to the waitress to the busboy was welcoming and helpful, even when we only ordered a small quantity. Much appreciated!",3,,1

Updated review","We went to Crave Fishbar on the Upper West Side looking for a fish dinner. While the food was very good, it wasn't spectacular and the prices are a bit high.We started with a roasted cauliflower soup with fried oysters and a chive gremolata (lemon zest, garlic, parsley and anchovy). It seemed to have improved since a previous visit in 2016. The soup was delicious and very creamy, and we were told there was very little actual cream, most of the soup is made of pureed cauliflower. $12 seems a bit much for a bowl of soup, though. We asked for bread, and were served standard slices of a baguette with a tough crust, nothing special. For the main dish we had the Yogurt Marinated Market Fish (John Dory) with chana masala and dill ($31). The fish was well prepared and flavorful, with plenty of dill. The chana masala (essentially chickpeas in a tomato curry sauce) was very good tasting, hot in temperature and spicy and pretty salty. But I'm not sure how many people really want a bowl full of chickpeas as an accompaniment, it would have been much better as a small side dish and the fish served with potato and vegetable. However, as in many overpriced restaurants, the vegetables were a la carte. There are only 2 choices (plus a rice dish but that's not a vegetable) so we had the Thrice Cooked Brussels Sprouts with chrorizo vinaigrette ($8). The brussels sprouts were good although mostly crunchy and not quite cooked enough. We didn't like the chorizo sauce, it was very salty with an off flavor, perhaps that's what chorizo is like, though. We tried a couple of desserts and the ""Famous"" chocolate chip cookie was warm and delicious, served with a scoop of house-made vanilla ice cream. We also tried the blackberry sorbet, which was fruity and fresh, but not that flavorful. The noise level in the restaurant was moderate, which was surprising since there were very few patrons on the night we went. I'd think that it would be very noisy when crowded. So if you decide to try it you might enjoy it more when it's not too busy. Overall I'd say that the soup was 4.5 stars, the disappointing bread was only worthy of one star, though. The main dish was very good and flavorful and the fish was well cooked, 4 stars, although it would have been better with a potato and vegetable. The brussels sprouts would get 3 stars since they were undercooked. The cookie would get 5 stars, it was really delicious. So 4 stars overall. Service was friendly and excellent and they were accommodating about special requests.",1,,

The best part is that it's $1 oyster happy hour every day (5-7pm M-F and 4-6pm on weekends), and you can get any of the oysters for $1 (not a limited selection for HH). Also enjoyed their fried oyster slider. The sauce was delicious with a little kick to it.Cocktails were okay - not amazing, but for the $7-9 happy hour prices, they were good. Probably wouldn't pay full price for the same quality drinks.Friendly and prompt service. Happy hour seating isn't limited - can do bar or table, or outdoor (if weather permits). We were seated at a two person table, and when a third person joined much later, they were happy to let us move to a bigger table next to us without any issues.Highly recommend for happy hour oysters and drinks.",4,,2

Although if you sit at the bar (as we did but past happy hour -sadly) you'll get some attention from the the person who shucks the oysters.

76,Jenna M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",296,2,0,2.0,7/23/2018,"My boyfriend, cousin and I were so excited for some oysters after a night out on the upper west side. We found what we thought would be the perfect place but we were clearly mistaken. We walked in and waited for the host to great us at the front door at 9:30pm on a Monday night.  After waiting to be greated, we finally were given a table at which time we were told to order our food almost immediately. We ordered two dozen oysters after asking the server a few questions and recommendations regarding what oysters to purchase. He seemed unamused with our questions and gave simple yet basic reviews of the food in what appeared to be an attempt to get us to stop asking questions. Afterward we stopped asking questions about the food,  but we asked about making a simple mezcal shot with Montenegro amaro. The server seemed very confused and  we watched him struggle to explain this request to the bartender. The shot that came back was not quite what we ordered but we sipped on it nevertheless without complaint. Once the bill came, the bartender or server had charged us double for a full shot of amaro and a full shot of mezcal, when they hadn't given us one shot of each and had instead combined the two. Without a word, they had dropped the bill and waited for us to leave. Overall I was unimpressed with the service of the place as a whole. My boyfriend, cousin, and I all work in the industry as bartenders and executive chefs and we all felt very unwelcome from the moment we walked into the establishment to the moment the door shut behind us. The worst part of the experience was being left on the dark about our bill, especially when what we ordered to drink was not what we received. Think twice before you get the bill at this establishment as they might be cheating you out of some money and they might not enjoy your late night service.",,,

We even ordered second glasses of wine and spoke to the waiter, who didn't seem to have a clue as to what he was doing. He informed us that he had let the staff that was preparing the oysters that we had been waiting for close to an hour now for them. Still the plates of oysters kept coming out and going to other tables.I asked to see the manager at least 4 times. I even saw her trying to hide from us in the front of the restaurant. Till today I have no clue as to why we were treated that way by the staff of Crave fishbar. We left and did not pay one cent for our wine. We let the waiter know our intentions not to pay, after the way we were treated. Crave why did you refuse to serve us? Was it because I'm 6' 3"" tall and weigh 225 lbs, were you worried I might eat more than one dozen oysters. More than likely, but not your decision. Did you refuse to serve us because we were mostly speaking Spanish, and that is not the language of the UPW. Or maybe you don't like serving good looking middle aged couples. Sorry, had to be a little tongue and cheek. LOLMy friend was extremely offended by your behaviour, she asked to see the manager several times. Oh yeah, the manager who decided to hide behind her staff and not answer our questions. I saw from the table, the manager refusing to even give us the time of day.So Crave Fishbar, I don't care how many good reviews you may have gotten on Yelp. Your a bunch A-holes!!! For treating any one the way you treated my friend and me.To the owners, you got a bunch sh*theads working for you. But, you guys are probably Sh*tHeads too.",,,
80,Mimi B.,"Los Angeles, CA",229,456,45,4.0,8/29/2016,Space was really cute.  Indoor and outdoor patio seating available.Food was excellentPortions were smallPrice was OKService was poor.  Still 4 stars.  I think the server was not the norm.  He was rolling his eyes when he'd leave other tables- as though he was annoyed at customers- rude when I asked for things and just overall uninterested.Bathroom cute/small.  Toilet wasn't flushing.  Probably someone put something in thereI'd certainly come again,1,1,1
81,Yana P.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,9,6,5.0,7/9/2017,My friend and I were looking for a good oyster bar and came across Crave Fishbar.  Not only did they offer $1 oysters from 4-6 pm but every oyster on the menu was a buck not just a select few.  Besides the oysters their menu is fantastic!  We had the calamari and the crab tostadas and both appetizers were delicious!  On top of it all the bloody Mary's completed the entire meal and were also yummy!  We will be coming back and highly recommend you try it too!,,,
82,Taylor P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,2/15/2018,"My fiancé and I live on the upper west side and we're always trying new spots.  After making a few reservations we decided on trying Crave Fish Bar on a very special engaged Valentine's Day.....  The only thing good about the restaurant was the wine.  Apparently there was a FOUR course price fixed menu being offered somewhere else because it wasn't here... The first ""course"" - and I use that term very loosely - was two oysters, as in one for me, one for you.  Next was decent appetizer course followed by an inedible dinner...steak was over cooked and tasted like eating a tire and the fish was very bland and thrown together.  The dessert was nothing special either.  Our Valentine's Day was ruined.  $60 dollars was taken off the bill which still ended up being a total of $200.  Ended up getting sick the next day as well as being hungover because all we did was drink the wine. Terrible experience and will never go back!",,,
83,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,6/22/2016,"I did it. I finally tried Crave. I walk past this place virtually everyday, and everyday it calls to me. Everyday I hear its siren song. Everyday it asks me why I neglect its presence given how close I live. It chastises me for frequenting the East Village and Lower East Side for my restaurant adventures when my own backyard has something that's allegedly terrific. I do realize my Catch 22 here: I either I'm crazy because I think a restaurant is talking to me, or I'm crazy but I have an ever-present voice in my that wears the mask of a restaurant. So now that we've established my lack of sanity, let's move onto my review that you should be inclined to trust. Rational, no?We went to Crave on Saturday night around 8pm without a reservation. I'm an OpenTable addict so this was a fairly new experience for me. Thankfully, a table had just opened up and was free for an hour and a half, which ended up working well. We were off to see a movie afterwards, so the timing couldn't have been better. What movie, you may ask? Finding Dory. We thought it wise to fill our stomaches with the very creatures we were about to feel empathy for. Before I move onto the ingestibles, I must mention that the interior of this restaurant makes for an awesome dining experience. It's classy but not pretentious. You know you'll be shelling out a decent amount of cash for your meal, but the place is so down-to-earth that it's still approachable. I'm not sure what was here before Crave, but the space screams restaurant. There's ample room by the bar for those who want to come for happy hour/drinks, which is a totally viable option here. You also have a very large dining area, which I didn't was split into front and back sections prior to physically stepping in the space. The space itself is warm and the staff only enhances that feeling. This ain't your typical UWS joint.Along with its notoriety as a seafood restaurant, Crave also boasts a pretty impressive cocktail program. I'm not sure when the idea of pairing seafood with high-end cocktails came to fruition, but the concept seems to have proliferated everywhere. Seafood and cocktails happen to be two of my very favorite things, so I'm thrilled by how frequently I find their cooccurrence. As stated, Crave is no exception. Along with a nice list of craft beers and plenty of wine, Crave has a cocktail menu that features some signatures, some originals and a few cocktails on tap. Me being me, I tried two: the Burning Man (high west campfire, giffard creme de peche, angostura) and the White Walker (high west white whiskey, aperol, orange, spiced syrup). High West makes some of my favorite ryes, so these seemed like natural choices for me. For those of you who aren't familiar with High West, they do some very unique whiskey blends that I haven't seen elsewhere. Campfire is a blend of SCOTCH, BOURBON, and RYE. Three in one! It's seriously tasty. Of the two cocktails I tried, I'd recommend the Burning Man. Both were good, but there's something special about High West Campfire that makes the Burning Man so good. Instead of going shared plates-style, we each got an entree and split them. Not my usual preference, but as long as I get to try more than one thing, I'm happy. One note about the menu that my fellow health nuts will appreciate: they give you that nice little ""(GF)"" notation next to all dishes that are gluten free. Even better, most of the menu is gluten free! So if you're a health-conscious person but still want to eat out, Crave is a fantastic option. Market Fish w/ roasted baby beets, baby turnip, red quinoa, lentil vinaigrette (A-)As is the case at many restaurants which offer a market fish option, the fish rotations but the general preparation remains the same. The fish of the was mahi mahi, which we're both big fans of. This dish is easily the healthiest on the menu. Even the vinaigrette is healthy! The fish was cooked beautiful and the beets were very fresh and very tasty. I will say, though, that this is also one of the more boring dishes on the menu. It's not bad, but there's no real wow factor. We didn't regret getting it though--the mahi mahi held its own as the star of the dish, which you can't always say about fish. Plancha-grilled Barramundi w/ romano beans, fiddlehead ferns, fresh peas, asparagus, tahini sauce, roasted cashews (A)Still healthy, but it's got some extra oomph to it. Tahini is a brilliant ingredient. Again, I'm going to be weirdly didactic in a simple and demeaning way: tahini is made from sesame seeds and has the consistency of peanut butter. It's one of the many alternatives vegans use to make things creamy. So despite me avoiding cream-based sauces when I go out, I knew this one still gave me a green light. The sauce here is creamy but not too heavy and pairs beautifully with the fish. The peas, beans and asparagus were all lovely complements to the fish, and the cashews added some extra texture and nuttiness. Definitely a good choice.",9,6,6

I really enjoyed my barramundi with haricot jaune and fiddlehead ferns. My friend also loved the lobster curry with garlic rice.

88,Emma R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,2.0,1/20/2018,"Extremely slow service, salty unthoughtful menu itemsWalked in around 1:30pm for lunch/brunch. No tables were available so we sat at the bar. Waited 10 minutes until a server came to take our drink order. 15 min later our bottle of prosecco arrived. Waitress placed the bottle in front of us and left and did not return - so we had to open the bottle ourselves. Neighbor patrons at the bar also thought this was strange.30 min later our oysters arrived. No accompanying sauces or oyster forks were delivered, so we slurped them plain. (But they were good, and $1/each, so worth it)60+ min server came to say ""don't worry, food is on the way"" 10min later food arrives. Red crab toast was okay but didn't need the fried egg on top the server suggested. Lobster cavatelli (which the server said was their favorite) was overly salty, lemony and definitely didn't have the promised half of a lobster meat in it. Lobster was overcooked and tough, and covered with lemon so you couldn't taste the lobster. Once again the over-cooked fried egg on top added nothing to the dish. Fish tacos were meh but had strips of hidden jalapeños that were brutal especially since our water glasses hadn't been refilled. Conclusion: fine vibe, disappointing food and service",,,

We ended up staying for main course (squid ink spaghetti was, to borrow a phrase from kids these days, bomb-dot-com). I got the carrot cake for dessert and it was also amazing.

94,Nick C.,"Manhattan, NY",67,526,235,5.0,2/9/2017,"We recently went to Crave UWS with a group of our work people. We had been planning on going for a while. [I had been to the one on the East Side but the west side location was easier for everyone coming in from outside the city] We had a reservation for 10 people initially [one of our people got sick the night before and had to bow out] We were seated as soon as everyone arrived. It is a nice sized space with a bar area in the front with some tables and lean to areas [for people only wanting drinks but not eating] and the back of this nautically themed restaurant was all tables. We ordered drinks and were given the menu. Being that we were so many people, we had a prix fixe menu. We were able to sample everything of the choices given to us so this was a real bonus. After sitting down, we had shrimp on ice with cocktail sauce and these delicious sticky buns. Shortly after, lobster salad arrived with a chicken dish and the best fish tacos [they were a little spicy for some but they had a great kick to them.] For dessert, we had warm chocolate chip cookies with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and coffee for those who wanted it. We were given ample time to sit and talk and there was no rush for us to leave.. Caveat: This is predominately a seafood restaurant although there are other options. Check the menu before making plans to go if you do not eat fish. {we did have people decide not to go because they do not eat fish] Drinks are city priced. It was a wonderful afternoon with friends and I would recommend and return.",1,,2
95,Han C.,"New York, NY",151,397,80,3.0,3/17/2016,"Cute little Hamptony spot on the UWS - the interior is straight out of a grandmother's cottage in Cape Cod. We came mainly for the Happy Hour, which is a happy two hours indeed, from 4-6 everyday, with any oyster on their menu. We enjoyed the Malpeques best - small, sweet and simple. I love how they provide a variety of citrusy fruits to top them with - grapefruit, lime and lemons. The HH cocktails are good too - the apple cider sangria is borderline juice (but with a punch), but the Tequila Mockingjay (oh, so clever they are!) is a tasty one.We were starving and stayed for dinner which consisted of:- Calamari - crispy, crunchy and nicely spiced- Fluke ceviche tostadas - which were completely covered in cabbage slaw, but hefty in fat slabs of fluke. There's the tiniest of Thai chili slivers on the tostadas, but the bite with the chili is the absolute best- Lobster curry - a bit salty, but the lobster is cooked to perfection, tender and sweet. You pretty much have to order the side of rice (with snap peas and egg) to eat with it (because nothing else will come with the curry). The fried rice is a bit dry and whatever, but you're smothering it in curry anywayService was a bit slow and inconsistent. Nothing from dinner screamed must-eat again, but we definitely will be back for more oysters. I guess you can say, Oy'll be back! Ha !",4,1,

The lobster curry entree was also incredible, although it must be ordered with the side of rice, otherwise you are just slurping up curry...We didn't like the octopus, even though most people seem to rave about it.

Walking in there's a buzz of energy with enthusiastic hosts and servers, and the patrons mingling throughout. Make a reservation ahead or give them your name and with a bit of a wait you will be seated as a walk in. The service. From the friendly hostess and servers and food runners, everyone was fantastic. I ordered a Mezcel drink (ecto cooler) off their specialty menu from a server in the bar area, way too tart for me, dulling the Mezcel flavor, and when I requested they make it a little sweeter - no problem, and they made it perfectly to my liking. Not one but a second server stopped by briefly asking if I liked it then - despite their crowd. Table service was equally as attentive and the server offering drinks and checking in for our order. Food was delivered in a timely manner, and spaced well between appetizers and entrees. The food. Delic!! - homemade bread very good. - grilled octopus. Fantastically presented. flavored and cooked just right.- tuna tar tar. Not my favorite here, as this is one of my top choice apps. Citrusy (blood orange) and with added onions is not my preference in flavor, and I also think possibly due to the citrus it may also makes some pieces softer than I prefer. - lobster curry (add a side of rice) - yum! A unique must try dish. The lobster was perfectly cooked and delicious - broth was just spicy enough ... And adding the rice to the fantastic broth was a great recommendation by the server.- scallops.

102,Cassie W.,"New York, NY",143,37,24,2.0,1/6/2016,"DISCLAIMER: Happy Hour is only from 4-6 (it is available through out the restaurant not just the bar). The Crave Fishbar website only displays information specific to the Midtown restaurant, don't get confused by the 5-7 happy hour noted on the website!Atmosphere: I loved the look of this place when I first walked in very classy and trendy. However I was taken to the back room which was a significant downgrade. I think the restaurant is trying to go for a beach house appearance but its dull and old looking in comparison. The plaid booths also stand out as an outlier...not sure how those are beachy.Service: Kinks definitely still need to be worked out. I had someone refilling my drink every time I took a sip but it took the waitress forever to take our order for appetizers.Food: I don't think the price of the restaurant is bad, but for the quality you are receiving its not worth it. Save your time and go to mermaid inn (a few blocks up). The tuna tartare had a good flavor but could have been more fresh. The winter salad was not at all what I expected, all the toppings were skimped out on and the lettuce was iceberg. Oysters: The oysters were really good, despite the happy hour mix up. The waitress was able to suggest some good options, the Hooper Island Oyster was a pleasant surprise. Oysters come with 3 home made sauces - scallion ginger, cocktail and a grapefruit mignonette. My friend and I both agreed the scallion ginger and cocktail were way to overbearing. Although good flavors - a drop of the sauce overtakes the oyster.

124,Tiffany L.,"Queens, NY",78,396,259,3.0,6/27/2016,"We got the Korean Style Pork Belly as out appetizer, and there was nothing Korean about it. Apparently, they used gochujang chili sauce...and to my knowledge, that shit is fire. But it was probably mild at best. Wish the portion was bigger because it was rather delicious...despite it not being spicy at all.Got a dozen oysters as well. Not too shabby. Shared the yellowfin tuna and I think they forgot the seasoning because it was soooooo bland. My drink, ""Mint Condition"" was refreshing and yummy though.",1,1,1
125,gwen L.,"New York, NY",3,137,0,4.0,10/11/2016,"A nice addition to the UWS neighborhood!  We came in for dinner last weekend and were treated to delicious meal.  Though a small restaurant, the ambiance is very relaxed.  The tables are bar stool setup, which for a short person isn't very comfortable to get on and off the stools.  We could also fee the floor creak and move each time people walked back and forth (shoddy flooring maybe?)Beyond the restaurant venue, however, the food was pretty good.  We ordered for apps the grilled octopus and the tri-color salad, and for entree the curry lobster, seared tuna, and the squid ink spaghetti in clam broth.  The octopus was exquisite-- very tender and flavorful.  My dad ordered the curry lobster and he sang praises of the dish.  I tried the broth and it was spicy and tasty.  My mom had the squid ink spaghetti which we both liked (it was better than I expected, though I thought the pasta was a bit tough and the broth too SALTY!!!!)  My tuna was just ok-- I like my tuna tataki with a good thick sear on the outside, but their tataki was a bit... limpy is the word that came to mind.  Not bad, but definitely the worst dish on the table.The service was quite good-- our server warned us beforehand that the spaghetti and the curry lobster were on the spicy side.  He was also quite attentive with our water glasses and mindful about about our drink refills.I would definitely come back here again and try the squid ink pasta and lobster curry.  But I would ask the server to go easy on salt on both dishes!!!",,,
126,J. P.,"New York, NY",22,199,1,3.0,6/28/2016,"3* that could climb to 4 with some improvements (see below).We arrived around 6:25 for a 6:30pm reservation and were seated right away in the attractive, flatteringly-lit front room at a comfortable high-top table. Team from front-of-house to waitstaff and manager were friendly, professional, accommodating and cheery all around.The tail end of the oyster happy hour was great, and they cut us some slack for our second order when the first one took over 15 minutes and arrived past the 6:45 ""last call"". A nice mix (east coast at our choice) of 2 dozen freshly-shucked, briny oysters at a buck a pop was a fine deal indeed.The rest of our dinner was good, but each dish could have been closer to great with some tweaking:- Local Porgy Poke with cucumber, hot sesame oil, candied macadamia & popped rice had very well-balanced and nicely contrasting textures and flavors, and was very pretty in the bowl... but the porgy was really bland. A more flavorful fish would have made this a winner.- White Clam Pie with sliced cherrystone clams and whipped lemon ricotta on baked roti had a great flavor profile on the topping -- really delicious -- but the puff pastry-like ""roti"" disk was not baked through and turned chewy, gluey, gummy and soggy under the moisture and weight of the topping. A sturdier, crisper more pizza-like crust would have made this a standout app.- Plancha Grilled Barramundi with romano beans, fiddlehead ferns, fresh peas, asparagus, tahini sauce & roasted cashews was a generously-sized main, with two fillets and a lovely, generous array of spring vegetables over a ruddy, creamy, tahini-inflected sauce. Alas, the fish itself was oversalted, and the sauce just coated the bottom of the plate -- a little more to spoon over and really flavor the fish and veg would have been awesome.So overall, a really enjoyable dinner in a sleekly-designed space with very good service, and strong potential to really shine if some of the kinks in the dishes we had are worked out.",1,,

128,Win C.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",321,622,2958,4.0,4/7/2016,"This is definitely my kind of spot. This location has only been opened up for the last 4 months. I dropped one star because they have happy hour $1 oyster special from 4-6pm, while their midtown location is from 5-7pm. I was really looking forward to trying some of their west coast oysters. Love the decor to this place, outside is more on the rustic side, while the back is more classy but still very chilled. We ordered the spicy tuna tartare to start, and the Handmade Squid Ink Pasta and the Homemade Cavatelli. All the dishes were delicious! The chinese long beans and the spicy chips included in the tartare was definitely very interesting. My Squid Ink Pasta had a lot of shrimps on top, the clam stock they used for the sauce was fantastic, and I love the added pepper flakes to give it a nice little kick! The Cavatelli is a good option for vegetarian lovers and the tomato based sauce was very tasty. They also have very good options on resiling so definitely give their wine list a try!",5,1,3

Not the other stuff w/o asparagus. Get it plain. Buy a side for $8 is the only option presented.

134,Dave L.,"New York, NY",25,340,10,5.0,2/26/2016,"We went for the $1 oyster happy hour a few weeks after it opened and had a great time.  First of all, there aren't many oyster happy hour bars that take OpenTable reservations, so that's a huge plus.  Happy hour is 4-6 pm daily and we got there at 5 pm and were seated right away.  The three of us proceeded to order two dozen (there's a limit to how many you can order at a time but I guess a table of 3 can do two dozen), polished it off, then ordered another two dozen.  Every oyster on the menu was discounted and we asked the waiter to give us a selection.  This is obviously better than the Mermaid, where their happy hour is limited to the oyster of the day.It's still not cheap after you add all the drinks and other food, but without question it's the cheapest way to eat 4 dozen oysters, enjoy some side dishes and have a couple of drinks.",3,,

The lobster salad had just 2 small pieces of lobster.  A lot of money for very little.  They had no bread or rolls for us even though we asked.  We didn't go at happy hour so maybe that was a mistake.  But even so, a very disappointing experience!  Service and ambiance were good.",,,

The food turned out to be excellent and the service was terrific. So I'd definitely recommend Crave in the end, just confirm that reservation!Previous review: Made a reservation for tonight at 5 pm for six people, for my mother's birthday. Did it over the phone since I wanted to make sure they had some options for a toddler. When we showed up, they had the reservation down for three days earlier. Ok, so that's upsetting, but I get that screwups happen. But when I said, ""it was supposed to be for tonight,"" the guy just said, ""well, it's in our system for Wednesday, so it's not our fault."" Um, what? I didn't enter it into the system, whoever took the reservation did. Of course it's your fault. The guy was rude, never once said ""I'm sorry"" or tried to find a solution. Just, ""well, we're booked and it's not our fault."" Ugh. Went to Vai across the street, where they managed to squeeze us in and we had a delightful meal.

142,C F.,"New York, NY",1,81,52,2.0,12/21/2015,"A beautiful interior and a nice and fairly priced menu were our first impressions. Today was the first formal open time so they were still working out service kinks. We sat at the bar for Happy Hour and, unfortunately, were ignored by the server who was very busy arranging bottles and speaking with managers/other workers. As misery loves company, the gentleman next to us was in the same boat too; after a 10 minute wait, he asked us to reach across the bar and secure him a menu. The managers seemed very busy folding napkins and talking with familiar well wishers. On this first day, no one stopped by the 1/2 empty bar area to ask how things were going and if we were happy. The Happy Hour food was fine, but we felt as if we were uninvited guests crashing a private party. I hope they will spend some time listening to folk and trying to work out the service kinks as Crave has the potential to be a great addition to the hood. I would recommend waiting a few weeks to try the place, so they have every opportunity to put their best fin forward.",4,2,1

It was more expensive than what we were looking for since we had just finished a run, but my husband didn't know that three money signs on Yelp is pretty high in NYC. However, we decided to stay and I'm glad we did. The only negative was that the wine was too warm, but we found that in a lot of restaurants -- even wine bars, sadly. Nothing an ice bath couldn't fix.The food was delicious. The tuna tartare was terrific, although my husband wasn't as thrilled as I was because he didn't like the pickled onions. I loved them. The pork belly was a hit with both of us -- excellent flavors and loved the crunchiness of the radish and apples with the pork. The real winner, though, was the Barramundi. This dish is fantastic. Really amazing flavors -- one of the best dishes I've had. Also loved the sorbet they brought to us (I think for ordering a very nice bottle of wine and a few glasses of port -- so much for saving money!).Definitely recommend.",,,

I was surprised however by the slow and disappointing service of the staff. In addition, Although it was early and most of the space was completely empty, the hostess gave us a hard time for a surprise additional two guests that joined our group mid-visit. She told us we would have to give up the table sixty minutes later because of that. Our group was appalled, given the additional people to our party of 4 just added an additional $50 or more in cocktails to the check.

It's a chic scene but the restaurant is a machine.  If you don't mind that, the seafood really is quite good, particularly for the UWS.Regarding the Mains:  We found that the pork belly - excellent quality meat - sadly had way too much fat and very little actual meat. It came smothered in a beautiful, bountiful array of pink lady apples, radish & sweet chili sauce .. perhaps to 'hide' the size of the pork belly portion?  And the Hawaii-an-inspired poke, made with porgy rather than ahi was very delicious, had a delicious crunchy spicy cucumber accompaniment and was super fresh.  Although again, it must be noted that the proportion of poke to crunchy was very 'controlled'.",,,

We ordered 20 oysters which really couldn't have been better, they were delicious and they even threw in a few extra and at the happy hour price of $1 it was a great start. The Vermentino we had was a great compliment to the meal, we were doubly lucky to visit during mussel Monday's where they do deals on mussels, 2lbs and fries for $17 fantastic value, but really the point of this review is the yellowfin tuna... it was transcendent, really just a terrific dish.

There were a number of people there at about 4:30'but we were told that they were closed until 5.  We came back shortly after 5 to an almost empty restaurant. They refused to seat us because all those empty tables are waitingfor the reservation crowd!! Obviously for whatever reason they did not want our money, oh well, we often visitNYC but we will never come here again.I should mention that we are retired senior citizens, guess we weren't yuppie enough.",2,1,
165,E H.,"Walnut Creek, CA",3,149,0,4.0,7/4/2016,"Solid 4-star happy hour place if you love oysters. Not only is it $1, there are 13 selections from both east (10) and west (3) coast. Also I think their Bloody Mary may just be the best I've had so far!The burger and beer combo is great. The charred meat patty was very flavorful and the beer was carefully paired to compliment the summer heat and juicy burger. Service was upbeat and friendly. Price was reasonable at least for happy hour.  Haven't tried other meals so can't comment on that. Overall a neighborhood gem for the Upper West Side.",1,,
166,Jacqui R.,"New York, NY",0,40,0,5.0,7/21/2016,"After reading some of the reviews I was skeptical, but this place has an AWESOME happy hour. And it isn't nearly as loud as other spots on the UWS. We had cold lobster, crab tostadas, and drinks....really reasonable price. The seafood is really fresh and the waitstaff friendly without being fawning. Definitely added to the ""we'll return here"" spots in the neighborhodd.",1,,

Pasta made from scratch and homemade sauce with whipped ricotta!  We sat at the bar and enjoyed talking to the bartender, Karen. Also had salmon served on spinach, green beans and feta. I highly recommend",,,
170,Tim N.,"New York, NY",44,69,5,5.0,3/26/2016,Friendly service and great food. The happy hour oysters were fantastic and we loved the lobster curry - probably the the best curry I've had since I took a cooking class in Thailand. We had a great meal here.,1,1,
171,Cameron S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,9,9,5.0,4/22/2016,"If you are looking for a high quality, delicious, and innovative fishbar...Crave is it. Far better than the competitor Mermaid inn if you ask me. Also, ALL OYSTERS are $1 for happy hour - That's a steal. Love the ambiance in this new location and cant get enough of the yellow fin tuna plate, Lobster Curry, and the best frickin cavatelli i've ever had. You must get dessert also. Believe it or not, the classic cookie topped with ice cream is crazy good. I'm never disappointed when I come here!",1,,

I always leave it up to the servers discretion and will generally get a second dozen before HH is over. It's just too good of a deal to pass up!  The oysters are always fresh. The service is always attentive but the real stars ar the guys shucking the Oysters. They are working overtime during happy hour and do not disappoint. Legends!,,,

176,Rebecca S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,5.0,1/17/2016,"Crave has quickly become the best restaurant on the upper west side with exceptional food and drinks. In a neighborhood that's lacking high quality eateries, Crave is a welcome addition and a new UWS staple. I particularly love the porgy poke, calamari (the best I've ever had), lobster curry, squid ink spaghetti and some of the dishes you wouldn't typically expect from a seafood restaurant, particularly the fried chicken leg and cavatelli which are crowd pleasingly incredible. Their homemade bread is also a surprisingly delicious treat at the start of the meal (we ordered three rounds). I hear they're doing a late night menu now with a fried oyster sandwich and the famous Crave burger - I'm hoping to get there soon. I've tried a bunch of their cocktails, and none have disappointed. I particularly love their creative take on the Moscow Mule (and it's on tap!) and the Jem & The Holograms. The staff is warm and friendly. You can feel their excitement about the new digs. The restaurant looks absolutely fabulous with a vibe that is a perfect mix of downtown cool and uptown cozy.I'm so happy Crave has joined the UWS family and am excited to become a regular. Welcome to the hood!",2,,
177,Rich H.,"New York, NY",8,180,0,4.0,1/2/2016,"Crave is a very welcome, quality addition to UWS's (otherwise mediocre) restaurant scene.  The service issues that earlier reviews identified seem to have been worked out.  We shared oysters and 3 appetizers.  The oysters were perfectly shucked and fresh. Fried calamari was tasty and gluten free!  Ribs were meaty and flavorful, though slightly dry.  A bottle of light, crisp white wine was inexpensive at $34.  One suggestion:  Crave doesn't serve whole, grilled fish -- only filets.  This is a shame since Crave is a fish house.  With whole fish on the menu, Crave would probably rate 5 stars.  I look forward to the next visit.",2,,
178,Marc W.,"Boca Raton, FL",21,6,0,3.0,3/6/2017,Great happy hour. Oysters are fresh and a great variety. Service is miserable if you aren't sitting at the bar. It took 23 minutes to get a drink.,,,
179,Venessa P.,"New York, NY",2,4,0,2.0,6/15/2016,This was my first time here and I was very disappointed. The waiter couldn't provide any recommendation on the menu when I asked him what was good or popular. He was less than attentive. They were out of ginger ale and the grilled octopus. What restaurant is out of ginger ale? The food was good. But the overall experience is why I gave them a poor rating. Not sure if I'd come again.,,,
180,M S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,5.0,2/21/2016,"Crave is a very welcome addition to the UWS food scene!!The atmosphere is super sophisticated, the design has more of a downtown vibe, signaling improved UWS food options.  The banquette up front is very comfy and opens into a beautiful bar space, a very fun evening.  The tables in the back are a bit more intimate, also super comfy.  The couple of times we've frequented, we ran into friends, so feels very much like a neighborhood spot!All the food is fab.  Love the oysters, among the appetizers my fav is the poke, tuna tartare and ribs.  All the fish mains are fresh, well prepared and sustainable. All the main courses are yummy!Crave is super welcoming, our servers have been consistently knowledgeable and friendly despite well deserved and growing crowds.    Crave has quickly become a go-to spot now for dinner w friends, consistently reliable, fresh and well prepared fish, in a sophisticated yet comfy neighborhood environment.  I've had business dinners and lunches at Crave UES - it's great to have Crave closer to home now as well on the UWS!",1,,
181,Sofia P.,"Manhattan, NY",78,14,9,4.0,7/18/2016,"Went here for the first time during their happy hour special. We ordered plenty of drinks and oysters. Our waiter was really helpful and provided good descriptions of each type of oysters. We ordered 24 oysters and it took about half an hour for them to get to our table. I wish the service could be faster and commensurate with their drinks service, but I guess this is how they get you to order more drinks.The cocktails are good. Just remember to stir before drinking because one of our drinks had all the sugar in the bottom. I enjoyed their oysters a lot. The oysters are fresh and there are so many to choose from. A buck a chuck if you go during happy hour! Despite the slow service on the oysters, I will definitely be back!",,,
182,Ray L.,"Westport, CT",0,5,0,4.0,9/3/2016,"We arrived about 15 minutes before the kitchen closed and sat on the terrace.  A welcoming atmosphere, good service and superb food.  My friend began with an excellent burrata, generously sprinkled with corn and other items that added texture, variety and color, followed by delicious tuna (the first time I've enjoyed fresh tuna).  I had a lobster curry that was superb.  The rather elaborate rice they recommended as a side was not the best accompaniment to soak up the sauce (I would have preferred pieces of baguette--do they not serve bread here or was it because we arrived so close to the closing of the kitchen that they didn't want us to delay with bread?).  With one glass each, the mean came to more than $60 a head--the only downer--but the food was superb!  Definitely a place to return to.",,,

188,Maya L.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,1.0,3/23/2017,"Happy hour oyster scam.  Planned to have 1 dozen oysters each and then dinner.  Limit to how many oysters you can order at a time (for 2 people, 1 dozen - then you have to finish them before you order more).  We ordered a dozen.  Took almost 25  minutes to get them.  Waitress said oysters were ""slow to come out,"" when asked.  Couldn't order more until we finished the first dozen.  Would have liked to have leisurely eaten the oysters with a glass of wine, which we had ordered and which was served right away.  So now we can either eat the oysters fast and then order another dozen, presumably waiting another 25 minutes or so, or leave after we ate.  We leisurely ate the oysters and left.  They lose the dinner business.  Won't be back.",,,
189,Jeff S.,"Arlington, VA",16,3,2,5.0,4/19/2016,"Best seafood in UWS, hands down. Try the seared ahi tuna #1. Also, the tostadas for an appetizer are great. Can't go wrong!",,,
190,Ellen S.,"New York, NY",8,75,0,4.0,2/23/2016,"Ate here this evening. The food was very good. Nice raw bar selections, very fresh, nice presentation with the lemons, limes, and grapefruit.  The sauces were good too. I had the scallops, very good. My friend had the market selection which tonight was red snapper, and she really enjoyed it. Nice wine list at decent prices. Our one issue was the server. I'm sure he is a nice guy who was just doing what he was told to do. He never found the right balance of being available without being intrusive,  when to clear, when not to clear, and in general tended towards constant interruptions throughout the meal which quickly became annoying. He was definitely ""selling"" the whole time from the second I sat down and it made for a less than relaxing meal, constantly stopping over to tell us his latest offer and tell him again no thanks, we will let you know, yes, we know, thanks, everything is fine, if we need something we will ask, no thanks, we are good, etc.  Even after declining dessert, he came back to interrupt us again to say that he really wanted to tell us the gelato and sorbet flavors of the day, all 10 of them, he had to recite them, even though I would think that fell into the dessert category, to which we felt we had to again reply, no thank you. The kicker was to interrupt our conversation, again at the end, to announce that he was giving us our check and to ask us to fill out an online survey to give our feedback, and plopping down an electronic device. I think this place has potential and I'd love it to last, especially given the loss of Ocean.  Hopefully in time they soften up their approach, and sort out the annoying service issues. This place has nice potential for the neighborhood. They did a great job with the renovation, I had a hard time remembering what was there before.",,,
191,Molly K.,"Annapolis, MD",0,53,8,3.0,2/2/2017,Great oyster selection for happy hour. Calamari is not your typical with marinara side but an awesome type of fried pasta dish with a creamy sauce mixed with sprouts and basil.  I was not impressed by the mixed drinks on the hh menu. So I would stick with beer or wine. Cool atmosphere,,,
192,Michael S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,4.0,5/31/2016,"First off - the oyster Happy Hour is really great.  they serve a good variety of fresh oysters, both east and west coast.  People in the hood will be outside the doors waiting for it to open on a weekend.  The rest of the menu is great as well.  I often book a table for the back end of happy hour and let it flow into a proper dinner after that.Staff rates 4* as well",,,

194,Ryan M.,"Wilmington, DE",1,14,1,5.0,2/15/2016,"This place is great from top to bottom. Even though they just opened, the staff was extremely welcoming and efficient. Crave has the best oyster menu that I have found in the city with upwards of 12 from both coasts available at all times. I strongly suggest their barrel aged Moscow mule to start of with. The lobster curry is is great and anything like I've had at other restaurants. All in all, if you love seafood and like to eat fish sourced with integrity there is no better place in Manhattan I've found.",,,
