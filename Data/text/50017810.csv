0,Stephanie J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,60,58,2.0,10/5/2018,"I find this place to be just OK. Nothing spectacular but also not horrible. I was here for happy hour with a friend of mine. We ordered the bucket of bones which is ribs basted with Jack Daniel's glaze, traditional wings tossed in barbecue sauce and seasoned fries. My friend ordered a glass of the house wine and I ordered a dry martini. I must say the martini was nice and strong :). Unfortunately, my friend found a bug in her wine once she was halfway through the glass. Now, it is possible it flew in there while we were sitting there, but IDK. The bartender was nice enough to replace the drink without hesitation and also remove the charge. The food was just OK, the ribs tasted better than the wings. I cannot say that I will be back to TGI Fridays any time soon, but if you want something cheap and fast, I guess you can stop in.",1,,
1,Freeyah-Knycky C.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,554,6917,1.0,7/3/2018,"Unfortunately I've never had a good experience at this branch and on my last vist I remembered why. The wait for food after it's ordered is unacceptable. Get this, we were four dinning. Our server brought our drinks one by one. No tray, just one glass, a few minutes wait, next glass, same... and so on and so forth. She even forgot our fourth drink. Food, same production. Slow service, not the best atmospher, I guess it's the location? Food didn't taste good and everything was bagged, maybe we can add some Adobe to them when we get home. Ayecaramba! TGIF aside, I had a love-fest with my family there so **sticks tongue out at TGIF** thanks for the use of your space. The End.",7,1,6
2,Jazmine S.,"Brunswick, OH",2,43,32,1.0,11/1/2018,I walked out of this place. I understand that it is busy and usually involves lots of people but the bathrooms are disgusting. It just made me think that if the bathrooms could look like this then how does the kitchen looks. The staff didn't even approach us with what we wanted to order and furthermore left right in the middle of us trying to ask for something to drink. So we left and took our dollars else where. Funny though because I really like this restaurant but I will never go to this location again!,1,,
3,Jim W.,"French Quarter, New Orleans, LA",94,1,0,1.0,11/11/2018,"I'd give this zero if I could. We were seated quickly but that was about the only thing good about the lunch we had. Our waitress rarely came to our table, gave us the ""side-eye"" every time she walked by, and didn't even give us utensils and napkins until our meals were almost over. She didn't bring 3/4 of us our drinks and almost charged us for one of them even though we didn't get it. We also asked for separate check, and didn't split it the right way. The wings didn't really have a lot of sauce on it, but it was still ok.",,,
4,Canineya M.,"New York, NY",37,19,25,3.0,9/17/2018,The food was pretty good. The staff was cheerful and we didn't wait long for our order. My only problem was how burnt my loaded potatoes were but other than that I was satisfied.,,,
5,Jenny N.,"New York, NY",178,200,342,1.0,10/7/2017,"I decided to stop by after a long day at nycc, oh boy do I regret not looking for better. This is what happens when you get tired of walking, poor food choices to just sit down.This location is smaller than your typical TGIF and has limited promotions and high prices. Our server was inattentive and rather rude to us, things like replacing dropped silverwear, refilling our water and checking on us was not done. I ordered a chicken salad and the chicken was dry, which made the meat inedible. This location earned a one star for rude staff and serving dry chicken.",3,,
6,Mo'Ticia A.,"New York, NY",1,50,157,5.0,6/30/2018,Absolutely excellent service. The atmosphere was wonderful. The music was awesome. They were playing 80s music when I was there and 80s music is my favorite. Came on I could barely focus on my food. Food was absolutely amazing. I got the chicken Parmesan something with some lemon stuff and broccoli. It came with two huge dollops of potatoes. Best potatoes I ever had! When I tell you that I am not lying to you. This was my first time at this particular location and I would definitely eat here again,,,
7,Matt F.,"Yonkers, NY",62,495,841,3.0,3/13/2017,"Ok - not the best option out there, but certainly not the worst either. I respect others' opinions on here and their experiences - and everyone's experiences are different, but I can only speak for mine. Firstly, I was in the area and wanted a place to eat comfortably - which means not in a tiny place where people are on top of you (*coughJohnnyRockets5Guyscough*) and there's virtually no room. This place just opened as we walked by and in we went. Obviously this location is ""Manhattan-ized"", which means smaller and more condensed than a normal Fridays location. I fully expected that this would be much less than a standard Fridays experience - and most others coming to a location like this should expect the same. The hostess was weak and decided to sit people as close together as possible, though it just opened and it wasn't at all full. Really, it's better for the guests to be farther apart if it can be helped and if the place is not that full. The place filled up before long, so she got away with it. The waitress (Lory) was very friendly and generally a good waitress despite how busy this place ended up getting. One side has small single tables (for 2) and the other had the booth/table/chair. If you sat in the chair (facing the booth) and are tall enough, you have the mirror to look at all the happenings behind you. My main view of the time I was there (past the customers and wait staff) was of the vulturous bus boys standing there and waiting for their prey (empty/near empty dishes) to swoop in and remove and be gone before you could even realize you once had a plate there. I mean fellas, make it a little less obvious why don't ya. I don't think they get paid on a plate commission. I understand it being busy and all that comes with it, but they just stand there and stare hard at the tables just waiting.I needed to use the rest room early. Keep in mind, the place was open at this point for maybe 30 minutes and started to get busy. The bathroom was small (1 urinal and 1 stall) and REPULSIVE. I mean not even an hour into open and the bathroom was this disgusting. I joked on the Yelp ""tip"" about preferring to use a catheter instead of the bathroom - but really, it's something to consider if this is the bathroom option. I was only on the 2nd floor, but this wasn't promising at all. And again, this was within the first hour of being open. I didn't want to take chances with the menu and the prices themselves were not surprisingly Manhattan-ized was well, so I ordered the NY cheddar & bacon burger, while my son had the chicken fingers, and his mother had regular burger. I guess more than one person made the burgers, since mine had the pickles on the very bottom under the lettuce and tomato and she had the pickles above the lettuce, which was on top of the tomato - or the cook is just a moron. The burgers were fine. The fries were just fine. The chicken fingers were standard and fine. Really no complaints about the food, except the tomato slice. Again, this is Manhattan, so most things are pricier than the norm. So overall, a decent option for the area with a decent amount of eateries. Again, there's more space here than some like options and it's not bad if you want to relax without people being on top of you. If you come here expecting a normal non-Manhattan Fridays experience, then you came to the wrong place. If you hate crowds, don't come here at all. I you don't like Manhattan prices, don't come here. If you need a clean bathroom, don't come here. If you aren't picky and just want a place to eat that's not McDonalds where you're not on top of other patrons, then this is a safe bet for the area.",2,,
8,Rasheen W.,"Linden, NJ",3,19,0,4.0,8/23/2018,"Stopped by for Lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and service. Never been a big fan of chain restaurants but the decor was nice, the food had excellent flavor and the hostess provided great service. I had the Jack Daniels Grilled Chicken Burger which came with fries. Great flavor nice proportion, short wait time.",,,
9,Chicken F.,"New York, NY",0,22,4,1.0,7/14/2018,"The food is mediocre. I mean it's a chain place, dont expect anything good. However the service is freaking terrible. I ordered a steak, medium and eas given a well done. When I asked the server for a different plate he rolled his eyes. He returned with a different plate and asked very rudely ""is this better?"" When asked for a refill on the soda, he again rolled his eyes. Not once did the waiter come and ask if everything was okay. Instead he and the manager along with other servers were standing around around bullshitting. Was this worth it,no. Should this place close down? Yes.",2,,
10,Jay L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",160,572,45,2.0,4/16/2018,"Had a rare craving for some TGI Friday's as it used to be a go to by my job but since they closed the location by me I hadn't had Friday's in over a year. Wanting some mozzarella sticks and drinks came here at random on a Sunday. I now realize why other than TGI Friday's was not a regular spot for me other than the few and far between times I would go for lunch at work. Too experience for subpar food. It may have been inflated because of this specific Friday's is in the heart of midtown on 34th street but damn...over $30 for mozz. sticks, fries and a beer. Ummmm....yeah not really worth it. Service was good being that it wasn't crowded at all here but for the price....nah I'll pass. No Friday's here on Sunday's, Friday's or any other days for me.",,1,
11,Cassandra D.,"Rockville Centre, NY",0,10,4,1.0,10/1/2018,"Let me start by saying Fridays is my favorite chain restaurant. I am so saddened by this experience. I don't understand how the food can be so inconsistent here. My boyfriend ordered the Cajun Chicken and Shrimp pasta (our favorite) and it was so BLAND. Its like they forgot the ""cajun"" part of the dish and served him a plate of pasta with watered down alfredo. I tried to play it safe with a bacon cheeseburger. They accidentally put pimento cheese on it (underneath my cheddar thinking I wouldn't notice). Still, I ate through it. The only thing we could stand were the fries. We also both ordered the Long island ultimate tea which tasted like a cup full of sugar- no alcohol in sight. Im highly disappointed that we paid such inflated prices for such a disappointing meal. It was $73 for two entrees and two drinks! Highway robbery!! I encourage you to explore the local bars and pubs in the area for a much better meal and experience.",,,
12,Rosie Q.,"CORONA, NY",134,39,4,2.0,3/6/2018,I'm sorry to say I won't be coming back here .They don't offer rewards points and the endless app is only at the bar They take foreveeeeeera with good that the people next to us ...got up and left Took the order since our food didn't come out and we starving and still no discounts on that ...Should have listen to bf and gone to the one tgif in forest hills ...they treat you right,,,
13,Marshall S.,"Levittown, NY",20,5,0,1.0,2/25/2018,Terrible!! Stay away. 30 min for a cold salad with crappy chicken.The manager was rude and not helpful at all. Corporate should take over this restaurant.,,,
14,Tara S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",62,303,270,3.0,2/2/2018,"This place is really a hit or miss. I usually meet up with one of my girlfriends here to catch up. Convenient location next to so many trains. The waitresses have never let US down, however, it is very evident that others seem frustrated or unhappy with their service almost every time. The food is the food. You really can't be picky going to Friday's. We always get the same thing. Friday sampler. There's three floors at this location. Sometimes the host isn't the friendliest which is prob my only real negative about this place.",,,
15,Jessica M.,"Woodbridge, NJ",75,117,26,1.0,2/1/2018,"Was just here on Monday. My friends and I were looking for a quick bite to eat that we could all pick something we liked for a late lunch. It's a Fridays. The food will be pretty much the same every one you go to - the perk of a franchise. So let it be known, that this star isn't based on the food. The food was fine. It was edible. Nothing special. But it's solely based on the service. Maybe it comes from being someone who has worked as a service, or the fact that I've been working in customer service for more than 10 years, but the service was awful. It is a SERVICE industry, so to act like you're being bothered to assist your table was a bit off-putting. I wouldn't come back here.",,,
16,Dasa S.,"Miami Beach, FL",31,15,4,1.0,2/13/2018,And I just wanted to grab a salad before work I waited 20 min. No water no waitress no bus boy So I walked out.,,,

We order a slushy but the blender just broke, really!!!One blender for this whole establishment. Give me a break...Ordered a southern fried chicken, but they ran out of ""chicken"". At 5pm on a Friday night,  NO CHICKEN!!!!Ask for extra jack danielle sauce, they want to charge us a dollar! For a table spoon of sauce. I will never suggest this TGI FRIDAY!!!  AND I'M only leaving one star, because I can't leave none!!!WHAT!!! YOU CAN'T ORDER TWO ALCOHOLIC DRINKS, ONE TIME!!!",,,
18,Toni R.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,9/7/2018,We were sat at table under a leak. After getting dripped on I told by our server and was told the hostess informed us of the leak .   LET'S SEE if anyone would be OK with that!! Food was OK.  Manager giving out paychecks on floor at 5 o'clock on a friday??? No wonder service was terrible.,,,
19,Toni M.,"Orlando, FL",0,7,0,1.0,9/4/2018,"I would not recommend here at all. The place itself is very small. The food was not good at all! The bucket of bones looked exactly like that, very unappetizing and worse we felt sick after eating here. The wait times are also very long due to the amount of people who attempt to dine here. The staff was fairly pleasant though, the only saving grace.",,,
20,Hadassa S.,"Denver, CO",263,32,8,4.0,11/7/2017,I like the bar here. Always interesting people and decent service. Been here about 3 times. Kind of classy for a TGI Friday's.,,,
21,Marlene S.,"Concourse, Bronx, NY",1,43,2,1.0,12/3/2017,"Came in on a Saturday night, taking a break from Xmas shopping. I obviously didn't expect 5 star food and service, but I expected at least the bare minimum. My table was actually still dirty. No one bothered to completely wipe it off, so I cleaned it myself. I ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken, which comes with a salad and Mac and cheese. I asked to replace the salad with fries and was told I could do so. My plate arrived and I see the salad and fries, no Max and cheese on site. When I brought up that my meal was wrong, I was told I couldn't exchange it. SO WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME THIS WHEN I PLACED MY ORDER?? WHY DID YOU NOT KEEP MY MEAL AS IS?? Why couldn't you offer me something?? I was honestly very hungry and very upset so I only ate the chicken. Terrible service and food was wack. Never again",,,
22,Shaquille B.,"Bronx, NY",15,90,140,1.0,5/26/2017,"I usually don't like giving establishments 1 stars unless they truly deserve it and sadly, this place deserves it. I came to this place twice and ended up leaving the second time before I was even served because the service was so bad. The waitress at the front acts like they don't see you (or they're not even there to begin with) so, you have to go and seat yourself. If you sit at the bar, expect a long wait before receiving a menu or for your order to be taken. This spot has a lot of potential especially for its location but the staff needs training or maybe a new manager.",,,
23,Ivan M.,"New York, NY",35,2,0,5.0,9/20/2017,I love it here!!!!! Honesty everything I could ever ask for in this fine dining establishment. I asked my gf  to marry me hereUpdate:  we got divorced after this review,,1,

27,Christina E.,"New York, NY",1169,300,1949,3.0,5/16/2017,I only stop here if my Lyft dropped me off too early at the train station. I always get an (overpriced) beer and a basket of yummy fries. You get to meet a lot of interesting commuters at the bar area. The food comes quick and the service is what you would expect to get at Penn. No complaints.,18,12,18
28,Angelica P.,"Jersey City, NJ",647,210,150,1.0,12/24/2017,"Yikes! No Coca Cola, only Pepsi. No apple juice, only orange juice. No children's coloring activities or mats. Bacon cheeseburger is the same as Jack Daniels burger. Not enough napkins or utensils. Not enough space. Waiters had little idea of what they were bringing out. Bathrooms were tight and only 2 stalls on the second floor. First floor had one general bathroom. Salads cost more than burgers. Menu is unappealing. Service is slow and not intuitive. Black bean and avocado burger had a thin, end slice of avocado in it but was otherwise good. Jack Daniels burger sauce was thick with sugar. I don't typically eat in midtown because of all the tourists and franchises and this further solidifies my decision to never do it again.",1,1,1
29,Daniel J.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,41,1,1.0,1/13/2018,"This place is awful. Awful service, bad management.  The food was prepared wrong multiple times.  I gave up and left.  Before leaving I spoke with a manager, who handled the situation very unprofessionally. While waiting for my food to be brought out the second time I looked up the reviews for the place. They're  not good. I mentioned this to the manager and he responded with some smart comment followed by the statement""Put that in your damn review"".  Again, the food and service is awful I suppose they exist because there are enough tourist that walk in the place.  If you read the review before eating there I highly recommend you avoid it.",,,
30,Niki M.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,4,0,2.0,2/21/2018,"Just don't come here.  Took about 20 mins just to be seated and it was empty in here.  Then once we were seated it took about 15 mins for someone to take our orders and that was after i started complaining to other workers.  Once we placed our orders we got our drinks, all of our drinks were watery.  Mines was supposed to have liquor and it had none. I returned our drinks for new ones.  Now we get our food. I ordered the chicken nachos.  Halfway thru I found a short black curly hair in the cheese dip.  .  After talking to the manager he removed the dish from my bill, I won't ever come here again.  Before we left we used the bathroom ... omg it was sooooo gross.  It smelled and looked like a gas station bathroom.   Overall the food was decent and so were our drinks once they were replaced.  But just don't come here smh.",,,
31,Shawanna W.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,28,26,1.0,2/4/2018,The food was overpriced and sucked. I'm so mad that I wasted my time and money. I don't really expect much from chain restaurants but this was pretty bad. I'd give no stars if I could. I will not be returning ever.,,,
32,Teresa B.,"SUNNYSIDE, NY",426,190,919,1.0,4/23/2016,"Never again.  The bar is very understaffed.  Food is gross.  All of it.  I tried the Sampler Appetizer and nothing that was included in the dish was good.  It all tasted like microwaved food that was left out for 20 minutes, after being steaming hot.  Then reheated again.  And again.  Then it got cold.  Im 100% positive that the boneless buffalo bites were undercooked but rather then send the food back and wait another 20 minutes - i just left them untouched.  The bites along with the rest of the food were slabbered in sauces.  If you dont want to eat and are looking to grab a drink - they have a decently priced happy hour.  Note that the Rebel IPA on the Happy Hour is very watered.  Why order an IPA that is watered?! Exactly...dont.  However, if you order two beers - you pay for the price of one.  Unless the bartender charged you incorrectly, as in my case.",8,1,3

So we waited about 40 minutes to get seated which we waited at the bar.. Two angry orchards were about 8.50 or 8 i did not expect it to the be that expensive. so we go and sit down and look at the menu the majority of the meals are over 18 dollars!..  ehhh man i knew better not to go to this location and expect some cheaper prices but damn a cheeseburger and fries 18 bucks and it wasnt all that either. the staff was ok but majority of people who came in looked pissed being there so just look at the other 1 star not very good in my opinion.,3,,

It was a little weird but we told them we would wait the half hour. We all ordered our food and then waited for our food but once we received our food one of the guests we were with said that he wanted a burger with NOTHING on It. We get the meal and EVERYTHING was on his burger. When we asked to take It back they were very hesitant and It was clear they didn't want to waste there food. And not only that someone else didn't even get there burger until 15 minutes after all of us got our food!!! He was sitting there waiting!!! NOT ONLY THAT they charge you an extra dollar for a side of sauce!!!! I'm not a cheap person but if your going to charge an extra dollar for sauce you better be perfect. Not only did I pay an extra for my sauce (omg I sound so cheap) but I had to wait for It for 15 minutes!!!!! The service was very slow and VERY unorganized!!!!! I can say our waitress was on top of everything. I didn't catch her name but she was good!,,,
37,Jimmy S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",208,5,0,1.0,10/6/2017,We just went today after comic con. And we were given the abspulye worst waiter ever. His name was eddieberto. Server number 215. He gave us alot of sas and took forever to get us our drinks. On top of that we came for the endless apps and when he served our drinks he blatantly lied and said foods ready. We waited over 35 mins and nothing. My group of guys decided that this is terrible and we all attempted to walk out. We didnt even finish our drinks which were flat. AND HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL ME THAT WE WERE CHARGED FOR THE DRINKS EVEN THOUGH WE BARELY DRANK IT. On top of that HE STATED THAT THE ORDER WAS PLACED AT 9:26PM and its 10pm. THATS STILL 45 MINS.

We waited for our drinks for a long period of time too. By the time my food came, I was beyond hungry!! I ordered a burger with regular fries but received sweet potato fries.

40,Dino L.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,1.0,1/6/2017,"This is the worst restaurant in the world. There are many restaurants in New York that are terrible, but none of them are as fully committed to being terrible as this TGI Friday's. I saw all the one star reviews and knew what to expect, but I had a gift card, so I figured that I'd give it a try. I expected the worst and TGI Friday's delivered in a spectacular fashion. The hostess spent the entire time on her phone, so we had to seat ourselves. After 20 minutes had passed and 3 attempts to flag down a server, we finally got a ""waiter"". It was immediately apparent that this man was actually a dish washer. He wore kitchen staff clothing, barely spoke English and had no knowledge of the menu whatsoever. He did not understand the concept of wings and was adamant that we had to get them plain without any flavors, as he seemed to think that this would constitute a ""substitution"", which is of course against company policy. We ended up walking out after that, but I regret not having stayed to see the food, because a restaurant this bad is a once in a lifetime experience.",2,1,

42,Carla R.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",4,1,0,1.0,10/6/2017,Holy crap this place is horrible!! I went with a group of friends after New York Comic Con for endless apps. We were a group 7 and were told to wait 45min which turned to a little over an hour. I let that go because we were a big group anyway. The REAL problem began when we sat down.The waiter (his name was Eddie B according to the reciept) came to our table and didnt really greet us but instead gave us an attitude when asked what drinks we wanted. The whole time he acted like he didnt want to be there at all. We all ordered our drinks and food that time so we dont have to wait as long. How wrong I was! Drinks came about 15-20 min later and this nobody even ordered alcohol but one person. On top of that all the soda were flat.Another half hour passes and people around us were getting their ENTREES who were here the same time as us. We only ordered apps for crying out loud!!! After seeing that we decided to leave. We stayed literally about 2 hours total for crap service. While leaving these people had the nerve to force us to pay for our drinks that we barely drank because even those were bad!!!! SAVE YOURSELF AND AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!,,,
43,Julie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,18,0,2.0,11/29/2016,"The food here is edible (I suppose the same as at any other TGI Fridays location), and that is the only reason this place gets 2 stars from me. Literally everything else about this place is a negative.Let me start with the prices: the appetizers are all around $15, the entrees are $25 and up, desserts are $10 and up (and btw, there are no prices on the dessert menu - I don't think I would have ordered any if there were) - this is on par with upscale restaurants! I didn't order an appetizer, just an entree, a soda, and dessert, and my bill came to $46 (before tip), and that was with a 15% off coupon and without alcohol. Without any coupons I would have spent over $60. For one person!The actual food or the ""ambiance"" of the place, if we can even call it that, are worth maybe half that amount at best. And keep in mind that literally a few blocks away on 9th Avenue there are awesome Thai restaurants where you can have a full meal for much less...While the food is okay, I have to make a separate note about the drinks: they don't actually have the smoothies that they have on the menu, they only have soda, juices, and iced tea (I am not an alcohol drinker). The ginger ale I ordered was so watered down that it wasn't even sweet, and that's considering I ordered it without ice. I sent it back and asked for Sierra Mist instead, which was only slightly better. When I asked about the juice, the server told me that the glass won't be full since I am ordering it without ice. I mean, really now.The decor is non-existent (just very ""fast food"", doesn't have a ""real restaurant"" vibe to it at all - and that's at those kind of prices), the chairs are uncomfortable, and worst of all, the bathroom is filthy! For one thing, for such a big place it's absolutely tiny, two people can barely fit in there at a time; but it also smells, the coat hook on the door of the main stall is missing, and the floor is way too dirty to place a handbag (I had to look for some corner to hang my bag on). All in all, it's downright embarrassing for a chain restaurant of this caliber, and mars your whole experience of even going there to eat. The service I personally got was decent, so I can't complain about that. Overall, though, I feel that the Yelp 1.5-star rating for this place is accurate, and I regret not having checked it prior to going here.",1,3,2
44,George G.,"Trenton, NJ",58,208,512,1.0,11/11/2015,"This happens to me all the time, when I walk in a place without looking at the reviews. The assumption is for a busy place to have bad service is not guaranteed, but this is definitely one of the worst TGIF experience. First the drinks, one of which had a slice of lemon with something black on it. Second, the broccoli & cheddar soup was made with processed cheddar...there is a good chance it came straight out of a can.  Third, the busboy served our food, while doing so his hand touched my flatbread. I saw this and waited to see if he was going to say something, but he didn't...was ready to just walk away. I stopped him and told mention to him that I saw it happen. He quickly offered to make a replacement, which I declined immediately. Lastly, the green bean fries were warm at best.  Some weren't fully cooked and some were warm.The overall experience was subpar, even for a chain restaurant like TGIF. So it is safe to say they bank on the tourists passing thru Penn Station and the surrounding area...I don't believe they have any repeat or regular customers.",3,2,

But maybe this can help someone one day. Was shopping with my friend and decided to have lunch. After shopping we saw TGIFridays close by and I always remembered they have pretty good appetizers and some delicious dishes. Sigh, I guess this will scar me forever. As I had their lunch special. We sat by the bar and I ordered a broccoli cheddar soup and the ham and cheddar sliders. Since they don't make sliders anymore. It's made of half a sandwich of ham and cheddar. The soup was too salty, I mean, really? Who can mess up on a broccoli cheddar soup? Even Subway makes it better and you are TGIFridays!!!! You are supposed to be better than Subway!!  Sigh. The sandwich was ok, but for the price of $15-$16 including tips? Seriously? I can get a better meal in Panera Bread. Why???? Sigh. This was so disappointing. And for the record, I would give it 0 star for the food but that star was for the bartender. She was nice. I guess, that can make it up for the food.

We thought this would be a good place to grab a bite as it was close and our TGI's at home is always a solid option. The food was terrible and the service was even worse. The food was barely warm, the onions on my wife's sandwich were a burnt lump that she actually removed because she could not eat it. Our waiter, Eric, was perhaps one of the worst servers we have ever had. We sat at a 4 top and occupied only 1/2 of the table. When delivering our drink orders, he could not take the 2 extra steps to place our drinks in front of us, instead he just dropped them on the adjacent table and walked away. He could care less about serving us as he routinely walked right by us and wouldn't engage even when we called out to him. Only when it was time to collect our check to see what his tip was, did he show any interest. He then looked surprised when it was way below standard. Both my wife and I worked in the industry and we always tip according to the level of service we get, which is usually in the 20% range. Eric was lucky he got anything at all. Perhaps he should seek another profession.",,,

I waited 30 MINS to finally sit at the bar and the bartender took forever to attend us AND the food took long.

When the waitress brings my glass it's barely filled to the middle of the glass and the glass was dirty around the rim. I kindly ask her to give me another glass and showed her my dirty one. About 5 minutes later she returned with another glass of wine. When our food arrived the steak was not cooked to med rare and the sides were incorrect.  I waited for her to come check on us and explained how the meat was not cooked properly and my sides were supposed to be veggies and loaded mash(instead it was steak and French fries on the plate).  She took the food away and returned with a new plate of food about 20-30 minutes later in which the folks I was with were just about finished with their meals.  Never did we get an apology or anything.

They would look at you and turn away. The food itself was alright. It wasn't bad. Regular chain food. A bit greasy. We were in a hurry to get back to our office (which was only around the block), so I asked for the check and a to-go box before our food even came.

90,Robert B.,"Manhattan, NY",127,6,1,2.0,2/15/2016,"It was an extremely cold Saturday evening in NYC and I had to meet a professional colleague in town for the day with her son. She was leaving from Penn Station on 33rd Street and we wanted to visit a location that was reasonable and near to the station due to the extremely frigid weather.I had recently ""discovered"" this TGI Fridays, I knew it was brand new and that it had replaced an older and quite worn out location at the western end of the street. I have eaten in franchises of this restaurant before and they always had a reasonable selection of cold beer, nice wines and good food. They have excellent burgers and steak is a signature menu item for them. The restaurant is big but in a vertical style, as this is midtown NYC. There are three levels with a beautiful interior - brick and blond wood . That was a nice touch. None of that ""flair"" that clutters the walls and collects dust in most chain places with that fake ambiance and atmosphere.Because this location is near Herald Square it will be crowded on weekends with shoppers from Macy's and a myriad of other stores that line the nearby streets. In addition, Valentine's Day was almost upon us making for an even larger crowd. Yet despite this, the hostess moved us in quickly and offered us a choice of two spots on the second level.Our waitress moved in quickly taking a beverage order and bringing water. She was quick, sharp and very calm for a crowded restaurant. And most important to me she was available and visible. Kudos to the manger on the service staff.I started with a glass of the White Zinfandel wine from Beringer that I usually order in place like this if they do not offer a Riesling. The large wine glass was filled a cold, crisp and generous amount of Zinfandel and it was delicious. I know a White Zinfandel is not the most sophisticated of wines but in a place like this, but it ""pairs"" well with a burger, salmon or steak.For my meal, I ordered a dinner salad with ranch dressing on the side and a flat iron steak medium. The menu clearly states that medium means the steak will have a warm to hot pink center. I have had flat iron steaks before and while they are on the smaller side they are usually about 4""square.We waited for almost half an hour before the appetizer service arrived.The salad arrived first and it appeared to me that the bowl was was not completely filled. There were two or three grape tomatoes, two pieces of cucumber and some greens with a couple of croutons.The dressing was was sufficient for the salad and held in a small side cup as I requested.Unfortunately, I speared one of the grape tomatoes and as I brought it to my mouth, I discovered that it was hot. Not warm as if it had been standing out but hot as if cooked. I looked and saw the the remaining tomatoes has shriveled a bit so i was left to surmise that the salad had been left under heat lights for hot appetizers waiting for pickup.After another half hour wait, the steak arrived next and boy was I shocked.It was on the very small side about 3"" square and it appeared to me to be overcooked. If a steak is dark and charred in my experience, it is overdone. I had  also ordered rice pilaf and fresh broccoli.I cut into the steak and I did not see ""a warm to hot pink center"" as it was well done. The rice tasted like an instant boxed rice with a few pieces of carrot and scallion for color. The broccoli was cold and hard. Unfortunately,  after having waited for half an hour for each course to be delivered, sending my dinner back would have meant waiting again. Therefore, due to  time constraints I finished my meal and paid for what I consider an overpriced and poorly prepared plate of food. Needless to say, I will not return here for quite a while.",4,,

When seated, we were served our appetizers without silverware, plates or napkins. Prices here are ridiculous considering the quality of service is garbage and you'll get the same food at any other TGIF location. This location is overcrowded and for some reason their 3rd floor isn't being used at all. Most of the waiters/waitresses are rude and impatient.

I got the rib eye with tomato mozzarella salad and the Mac and cheese,the sides were good but I was not satisfied with the steak ,it was overly covered with butter and I guess garlic and it tasted like it was a burver .Any way the rib eye was the only con of the visit.",2,1,

After work I decided to go to this Fridays as I was craving it and had no way of getting to my favorite Fridays spot in NJ. Despite the terrible reviews I decided to give this place a try. DO NOT make the same mistake I made. This is seriously the worst place ever, it has everything you do not want. Terrible service, crammed seating areas, long wait AND cold crappy food. I was seated in a tight spot between other tables that were occupied. I waited for the seater to ask if I wanted to move she did not wait for us she simply WALKED AWAY no introductions, nothing. I refused to sit there so I waved to a server letting them know I was moving and moved on over to a less crammed area but was told I could not sit there. Finally, after giving in to another terrible table I ordered a beer and sadly after drinking a great amount of it I noticed the glass was dirty, sticky and disgusting. I ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer which I never received. 45mins-1hr later when my actual food arrived I asked about the mozzarella sticks my server stated ""oh they never came?"" are you kidding me??? You saw me sitting at this table for an hour with no appetizer then she blamed it on the cooks saying they never put it in. She then asked if i wanted them. Do I want cold cheese sticks that will arrive in another hour? NO THANK YOU. My half rack was cold, my mash was as cold as the disgusting cole slaw on my plate. At the end the server had the audacity to circle the gratuity suggestion portion like she didn't think it was bad service from start to finish. Overall, this place is a no go. I will never be returning to this location. I honestly regret tipping them, only did it because people have to make a living somehow but this was seriously the worst experience.",2,,

We were immediately seated on the 2nd level from 7:56 until 8:20 no one and I mean absolutely no one approached the table not even to state they will be with us.

She was surprised and requested for a manager via her walkie talkie...... finally after another 15 mins the manager by the name of Donald Pearson comes over and did absolutely nothing to resolve my issue, he didn't even know who the server was until I challenged him. Tara was the server's name, he then ask me ""do I want her to take the order"" I explain to him I needed to catch a Train and we are starving not to mention she took over 20 mins before she approached the table. He then stated ""OH WELL, what do you want to do"" I was in complete awe that he didn't offer no resolution, I wasted my whole time for absolutely nothing.

127,Blair E.,"Murray Hill, Manhattan, NY",0,12,0,1.0,1/13/2015,"I had high hopes for this place, even though it's a chain restaurant in Manhattan. It's nice inside and has a fun atmosphere and good vibe. That's about all the positive things I can say about my dinner there. Let me say first that it was Not busy since it was a Tuesday night. Our server was nice but everything was SO slow. It took about half an hour to get our drinks (2 of the same beer, so not exactly complicated), another 15 minutes to get my salad that was supposed to be a side, not a starter, and another 15+ minutes to get our entrees. Also, after we were seated no one approached us to even get our drink orders for about 10-15 minutes. A bunch of things on the menu weren't available, including beers that should have been on tap. When we finally got our food it was very disappointing.  I got wrong sides, the steaks were tiny and the plates had a lot of oil/butter puddles. Caesar: dressing flavor was okay/decent, it was not tossed and had a pool of dressing on the bottom, and there were a few pieces of rotten/old lettuce. Steaks: small and over-cooked. One asked for medium-rare and got a piece half medium-well and half well done. One asked for medium and got well done. Flavor and seasoning was okay. Mashed potatoes: kind of congealed, thin texture, way too much parsley thrown on topMac and cheese: almost no cheese (all cream and butter and dry bread crumbs). I did find some gooey, clots of cheap American cheese. Fries, crispy and flavored okay, weirdly chewy. We would have sent it back but we couldn't find the waitress (who I think was stuck working several floors). When we told her how disappointed we were and she talked to the manager, she said he told her we couldn't be comped because we ate it instead of sending it back.

129,Jen G.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,1,0,1.0,2/28/2016,"On 2/27/16.. my second experience coming to this place by far the very worst ever, the first one was terrible as well, but I decided to give it another chance. I would rate this a below 0. The  service is terrible.. me and my daughter arrived in the building at 4:45 pm we were told it be a 25 min wait by 5:15 we were seated upstairs in a very uncomfortable spot, so I told the  supervisor of that floor if I can change the seat because it was too tight. The seating structure is horrible there, we were moved 2 min after I requested to change the seat. By 5:40 I was told by another person that there was a miscommunication and no one inform her of the seating change, and then the waitress came and explained the same thing and took our order. She seemed overwhelmed, over worked but handling it, seems as though many people called out their shift (based off my management perspective). There were two other supervisors observing the floor (we were on the second floor) the one that change our seat never came to check to see if we were ok at all.  I complained why our food was taking so long after I noticed 5 tables got waited on and food brought to them, by 6:30 is when the food arrived and I was told our order was lost!!!! I spoke to the manager expressed my frustration she told me she will make the adjustment on the bill, the other supervisor of that floor asked if I wanted to leave prior to me requesting for the manager... (after waiting 25 min to be seated, almost 30 min for our order to be taken, she asked if I wanted to leave cause of the long wait... NOOOOOOOOO I want my order..what sense it would make to leave, after waiting for nothing to happen, then to go and wait elsewhere wasting more time with a hungry child???!) management adjusted my bill but I didn't even care for that, I still was not satisfied. When you go to a restaurant, you go for the overall experience that's my opinion, I was not happy eating  after waiting so long and just getting poor feedback, excuses as to why this was this and that was that. The only thing I enjoyed was the Moscato and water. I knew my daughter was hungry cause she finished her food before me!!! She has never finished before me, never! After reading the other reviews about this place I see that everyone had similar experience with wait time and staff interaction with customers. I will never come back here ever again or recommend it. This is has been the worst restaurant experience ever. Even after I got my food the only person that was concerned if I was ok was my waitress, none of the managers checked to see if things were ok. To me that place shows lack of organization, miscommunication or lack of communication, poor seating  structure and to me and No sense of urgency to the guest after they have been settled and seated. Worst restaurant experience ever and I am person that never complains much trying to keep my temper under control. The old me would have been cursing everyone out long time ago. Trying to teach my daughter better ways to handle things....she never wants to come back here.",1,,

The over assertive waiter promised they never serve burgers with ""Red""inside when I requested a well done burger. Needless to say it was indeed ""Red"" inside. As I made my exit I enquired about the seating process with the ""hostess"" because there was still quite a few available tables with a crowd of patrons awaiting seating.

When I eventually got a glass of wine my glass was dripping with water and when I asked for a dry glass, the bartender practically rolled his eyes. His attitude was disgraceful to say the least. We were told initially when we arrived at the restaurant that there was going to be a 10 minute wait which was fine. However there were others entering the premises and being seated before us! Clearly we has been forgotten about (there was only the 2 of us) we sat down at our table about 20 minutes later. The cleanliness of the 1st floor wasn't great, rubbish on the floor, spillages etc. It took another 10 minutes for us to get menus! We had no cutlery or napkins until we asked and when the food came it was cold. Bathrooms were horrible too. There was food on the floor and had clearly not been cleaned. There were so many staff working tonight and I can't tell you how many were just standing around doing nothing. Bad service, bad manners, rubbish attitude. Not acceptable.

Our server Patti was alright, I can tell she was overwhelmed with her section so I wasn't annoyed with her. I was however upset at the fact that it took us literally 40 minutes to get our appetizer. I asked to speak to a manager and the manager on duty with a burgundy shirt on was NO HELP WHATSOEVER. Did not introduced himself, did not apologize for the food being late, said he was going to check up on us and disappeared. He argued with us about the ticket time, claiming that it was only on 18 minutes.

It took forever to get silverware (like after the appetizer and after the meal came) , we got the wrong food, my soda was seltzer instead of sierra mist. The appetizer was the only thing that was correct and good. I got warm salmon which was ok till they covered in this orange ooze and over cooked the lobster that was supposed to be on top. The broccoli was smelly and warm for a minute before it turned cold. The thing they label as mac and cheese was dry and crappy not mac and cheese by anyones standards. My husband got sizzling chicken and shrimp, there was cheese on the bottom for some reason. His meal was more appetizing than mine. The meal made me sick before I left as well as later in the night wasted 80+ dollars save your money and get a hot dog on the street.",2,,

136,User C.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",0,5,0,1.0,9/17/2016,"READ THIS!! Don't just scroll over this because it's a lot to read, it might save you.. Trust me you'll feel like you should have just burned the money in your wallet after walking out of this place! Lets start off by saying if I could rate it ZERO STARS I would! Husband and I were hanging around Penn Station for our next train home when we got hungry and figured this TGIF was right there and was usually reasonably priced. We were seated right away which was shocking since it was Saturday and it was dinner time. I know now why there wasn't a long line out the door like other restaurants. We sat at the bar so he could enjoy the TVs. I'm glad We did or we would have missed what really happens at that TGIF restaurant. The bartender, a young lady had a smug face, she complained right in front of us to the manager that it was time for her break that he should take these ""people"" referencing my husband and I. The bar manager was mid way taking our drink order when he suddenly started a whole new conversation with a bar keeper that was hauling dirty dishes away right over the bar counter next to us. I noticed the female bartender use her fingers (same hands we saw her put money in her pocket with) to take cherries from the tray and drop them in a glass, she did the same with every other drink. Thankfully she must have noticed my facial expressions and put gloves on and prepared our drinks. (Not to mention the staff was DRINKING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES WHILE WORKING and she was preparing the drinks for them!) We ordered the Ultimate Bloody Mary, which sounded very appealing in the menu(Which listed the ingredients and recipe) when our drinks arrived we kindly asked the same female bartender why we were missing most of the ingredients in our drink. She hastily replied that ""its not made that way"".. We had to literally read it off the menu for her. But rather than offer us a new drink she walked away as if it didn't matter at all. At that point we were already very annoyed. When my husbands food came out and it was also wrong we had finally decided enough was enough. To top off that nightmare, we paid nearly 70$ ( that amount is w/o tip which he added separately) for an order of boneless chicken wings (which actually came out with bones) and a French Dip order (which came out late because they messed that up too and brought out Artichoke Dip). As I was getting ready to leave I decided to use the ladies room, thinking it would be cleaner than the train station restrooms.. I was wrong! Toilet paper all over the floor, the floor was wet and smelled of urine, the trash can was over flowing with dirty feminine pads and diapers. As I walked out I was nearly ran over by two young servers who were chatting very loudly about people they were serving. That conversation carried back to the bar where the famous bartender joined in on the inappropriate conversation right in front of us. We did not even complete half of our dish we were so appalled by the experience! We got our bill and credit card back and she gave us the most dishonest, rude, insincere smile I've ever been given. I felt a lot of regret leaving her a tip, but the kind people we are we said thank you and walked away. I gave the manager a look of desperation hoping he would step in.  All the while he just watched on from behind the bar as this fiasco unfolded. As we gathered our things to leave, another young waitress came up and said there was something floating in a drink for a customer....(WAIT FOR IT...) the manager used a napkin and removed it and said ""There, problem solved""!!! We thought perhaps that waitress had a little more common sense. She insisted on a new glass, and the manager hesitantly complied, and she just simply poured the old drink in the new glass!!!!! We were horrified!! On our way out we warned people who were now waiting to get into the restaurant that this place was a nightmare and not to waste their time or money! This place should be closed down, or CONDEMNED! I swear at any moment throughout my meal I was expecting Jon Taffer to waltz in and start yelling up a storm!",,,
