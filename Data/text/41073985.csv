1,Sabrina Y.,"Manhattan, NY",793,76,152,3.0,11/16/2018,"Visited here as part of a coworker's goodbye lunch. I liked the atmosphere and service but definitely agree that food is pricier, perhaps due to the tourist-centric location. Their main course salmon was okay good in my opinion. The sauce was a bit much for me so I scrapped off a bit. But I did like that it was medium cooked instead of fully cooked. Since my table all got fries instead of rice, I did the same and the combination of salmon and fries was good.",,,
2,SkyeBlue B.,"Cancún, Mexico",29,48,482,3.0,9/10/2018,"Two bad burgers , fries and two glasses of beer for $70 USD.  Conveniently located in Times Square .Services could be better.We didn't have to wait for a table, big plus in NYC. Late night eating in the area can't be safe-challenging  but in here we felt secured . Bouncer at the door. Great place to wait for a friend if he or she is coming on public transportation from NJ. Going again? Probably if it's winter, dark, late and  have to wait for someone. Drink a beer, use the bathroom and keep rolling.",,,
3,Camille G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",131,333,734,4.0,4/30/2018,"We saw the happy hour sign outside, and went for it. Sat at one of the high top tables by the bar. Ordered drinks and one Parmesan tater tots appetizer. I must say I liked the decor and hospitable feel. Our sever was pleasant and fast. My drink tasted like a mule with the ginger beer taste which was refreshing. My favorite was the Parmesan tater tots. They were amazing round potato balls fried to perfection. So much flavor and they weren't greasy. Yummy goodness. The dipping sauce was perfect. Yeah we were starving but it was delicious !! I would have them again and again next time I'm in the city.",3,2,1
4,Amber B.,"Chesapeake, VA",1034,58,106,5.0,3/22/2018,"New Years Eve day in New York City, NY.. You can only imagine the amount of people, the crazy cabbies (which tickled me causing me to laugh a lot), and the zillions of places to eat near Time Square. Being at a point in my life where I can start to check off bucket list items has been incredible. This stop was along the journey and kept the good vibes going. I came up from Virginia to visit a friend and to FINALLY get a chance to visit the city. After hours of walking and ending up in Time Square, we stumbled upon this gem. It is kind of tucked away but a great location. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with a smile and didn't even have to wait for a table... SHOCKING! At first I thought, ugh this is going to be one of ""those places"" where we will sit here forever for mediocre services. Well, I was def the judgmental one. It did take a minute for the waiter to come see us, but he was WELL WORTH IT! John is one of the best servers I have ever had the pleasure to dine with. He was very knowledgeable with not only the food selections, but the beers as well. My friend and I love beer, so it was really neat to hear about what pairs well with what.. What does he have that is in the same class as what we normally drink. Let me tell you that he was SPOT ON.. I also went with the clam chowder that was suggested. OMG, it was so delicious. Has a little kick to it, but I also have a weak stomach for any kind of spice what so ever. Not once was my water empty, not once were we waiting for anything. I was so full but then the dessert menu came around and, WE COULDN'T SAY NO!! I was like, I am in NYC, what else would I have.. DUH, Cheesecake!! A DREAM!! It was like a fluffy cloud of perfect tastes. The cheesecake filling, the crust, the drizzle. John, here is to the great State of Texas and to you for being such a kick ass guy. You deserved every bit of happiness and goodness coming your way. I will without a doubt be back again next time I visit NYC!",1,,1

I'm not sure what to make of the breading on the pickles but it was like 23 flavors of greatness fried to perfection! The right amount of sweet heat going on! Now that I've gotten that out of the way! This is the perfect place to drop in for a beer sampler, beer, water and or to dine in! The menu is pretty extensive and something for everyone! You can easily become a regular here! Plenty of tvs to catch up on the games because tis' the season... it's Fall Y'all!  The place was pretty cleaned, I dined at the bar, service was fast, and welcoming! Can't ask for much more than that! Two thumbs up and two toes down... I'll be back! Be sure to try the fried pickles!!",,1,1
6,Jesse S.,"Lubbock, TX",0,7,2,2.0,3/3/2018,"Seating at the restaurant right now! Food is ok to good, a bit dry!  Service is the worst!  My beer glass stood empty for at least 10 minutes before I was able to get a kitchen helpers' attention to get a refill!! Cornhusker lager!  Yummy!",1,,
7,Stephanie G.,"Bloomfield, NJ",305,524,724,3.0,7/20/2017,"This place was okay. I didn't get an alcoholic drink, so I'm judging by the food. It's certainly on the expensive side for what you are getting, but it's Times Square, and it could be worse. I got the ribs at about $24 with mashed potatoes, and it was fine. It doesn't say on the menu ""half rack/full rack"" like most places because you aren't going to get very much. My boyfriend got a steak and had to send it back because it was well done when he ordered medium-rare. Don't offer steak if you can't cook steak.The menu is kind of small. I looked back and forth a couple of times and nothing really jumped out at me. My friend had the butternut squash which seeing as it didn't have meat seemed like they must make great margins on it. We went at about 5 p.m. on a weeknight and it was pretty empty. I think the atmosphere was fine, having a darkish interior with low light that makes things seem elegant. Plus they had a decent clean bathroom, which is kind of iffy if you'll get one in NYC. Overall I don't know if I'd come back, but the food was fine and we didn't have to wait. I think if you need food and are in such a touristy area, this is not the worst you can do for the price.",2,,

I thought it was really good!  Wasn't expecting it to be, but it delivered!  Got here during the rush hour about 4:45pm and it really was not busy at all. Waiter was attentive.

9,Jesse P.,"Syracuse, NY",1384,213,124,3.0,7/16/2018,"Wow, the food was good but I could have bought a cow for what it cost just for a burger. I liked the place, very convenient to the bus station, good environment, but the prices are really high.",,,

The bartender was ok, not much for conversation.

12,JJ A.,"Westerfield Townhomes, Olathe, KS",154,7,0,4.0,9/30/2018,We got there right when they opened. They weren't 100%   Ready for us.  Atmosphere was good beer was good. The patrons were friendly and we would go there again.  The pumpkin beer was so good!,,,
13,Debra C.,"New York, NY",7,20,5,5.0,7/7/2018,Great brews! Amazing service and the mozzarella sticks were on point. Wonderful place to stop by if you are waiting for a bus or just have some business over in midtown west.,,,

Garlic potato poppers and 4 glasses wine.(Small 4 Oz Glasses = $48.) . The Total  with Tax and ""printed on check - Suggested Gratuity of 18%""  came to $105.00.  The quality/taste of the food was just OK BUT was NOT worth the price(s)...",,,

17,Juli B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,2,1.0,3/18/2018,Went to grab a beer before our show started.  After paying for the 2 drinks I noticed on the suggested gratuity that my 19.00 bar tab had a suggested gratuity 6.02 at 18% and a suggested gratuity of 6.69 at 20%.  Now I'm no math major but that gratuity was grossly inflated.  After bringing it to the attention of the manager on duty he said that he had no control over the suggested gratuity printed out on the POS system and he said he would have to call the POS system to correct the issue .  we ordered another drink 10 minutes and noticed that the problem was fixed .  We asked him how the glitch was fixed so quick and he asked us to leave .  2 security guards then began to corral us to the exit .  obviously this is a dishonest place taking advantage of peoples trust .  Not to mention he kicked us out for asking a valid question . Unacceptable .,1,,

First time with Nando F: Liquid dinner at the bar, and sweet bartender.Second time solo: Mediocre Burger for lunch, and pathetic waitress with an attitude.Best thing about the Heartland Brewery is its L.O.C.A.T.I.O.N!

What can I say I do enjoy a good craft here and there , and Heartland you guys succeeded in every way.The service was on point , even though they were getting lit up like a Christmas tree down at Rockefeller Plaza. I did peruse their menu as it raised an eyebrow or two as I was enjoying their sampler of fine crafts. I guess that evening I was more into the ""liquid dinner"" then actually getting some sustenance. I felt there was enough nourishment in the barley and hops  part of it, forgoing an actual meal. In all even with the location being next to the bus terminal with the constant crowds, Heartland makes for a great pit stop to regroup and recharge with a libation or two.",12,5,8
20,Felicity H.,"Seal Beach, CA",10,94,267,3.0,2/3/2018,"Nice selection of comfort food. Friendly staff with good service. Plenty of seating. We dined for lunch but the dinner entrees are good enough for this place to make our ""dine there again"" list. We enjoyed the corn meal crusted calamari, sliders and the tasty tater tots.",1,,
21,Aly R.,"West Orange, NJ",208,198,197,2.0,6/18/2017,"For a table of eight grabbing a few appetizers and drinks, service was exceptionally slow. I had to return to the hostess stand multiple times to beg for menus. Mind you, this was at a time when the restaurant was nearly empty. The tater tots and nachos were not memorable. The big warm pretzel arrived on a giant stand and was accompanied by some tasty beer cheese dip. The fried pickles came in spear form and were a perfect bite with a dip in ranch.",2,,
22,Parris W.,"Washington, DC",9,44,49,1.0,1/2/2018,Horrible experience! Not being from the area we were lost in service and the overall experience. We were greeted by the host who ended up taking our orders because the server was no where to be found. We were easily distracted by the workers in the back corner. I ordered the chicken tenders which were not good and then a turkey burger to make up. We got 3 orders of fries but were only charged for two. Thank goodness! Our order of two fries came to 17 dollars and a manager never came to ask us what was wrong. We ended up staying a while because of missing our bus and we saw horrible interactions between staff and guests. When we finally left I was almost ran over by the new host who was very rude in his interactions to others. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking to eat in NY.,1,,
23,Chris C.,"Little Ferry, NJ",68,22,2,1.0,7/30/2018,"Horrible!!! $19 for a burger that tasted like it was microwaved!!! Service was terrible, but way better than the inedible food! Mozzarella sticks gross, fries gross, the burger nasty microwaved meat with a gross odd tasting bun, wilted lettuce and bad tomato! McDonald's or Burger King quality is miles ahead of this shit hole.

24,Amy B.,"Clinton, NJ",229,1,0,1.0,12/29/2017,"I'd been in here a time or two before as a convenient meeting place for people coming from different directions.  Always had appetizers and drinks - good enough, which was what lead to this past experience, after which I will never be back.  Service was slow, but it was busy and we had time, so it was expected and ok.  I had a Kobe burger, medium.  As did my mother.  I had fries as a side, mom had the theoretically healthier option, the side salad.  A few hours later mom started feeling not so great, and long story short (I won't bore you with the gory details), she ended up in the hospital just up the street until the early hours of the next morning.  Now, anyone can say it didn't necessarily come from what she ate here, but we compared it to everything else she ate during the day, and it most certainly did.  We won't be back, we're not fans of food poisoning.",1,,
25,Chad T.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",0,27,15,4.0,12/25/2017,"Stumbled in here because on Christmas... it was open... and because the 5 star hibachi place around the corner was slammed and they do not need to worry about reviews because the freakin hostess couldn't even make it to us to ask us if we had reservations... I digress.We were pleasantly impressed with the service and food/drink of this micro brewery.Got the pu pu platter and Mac n cheese deluxe or something and everything was delicious! Plentiful quantities and cool atmosphere...No complaints other than the waiter took a few extra to get to us but the hostess slammed him... so all in all he did a fine job.

26,Roberto V.,"Glendale, AZ",12,4,22,5.0,6/7/2018,Service was very good. A little pricier than I'm use to but what do you expect in time square. Calamari was on point and a good beer selection.,,,2
27,Jennifer P.,"Lombard, IL",434,1000,2540,4.0,6/28/2016,"TL, DR: Good food, quick service, free WiFi, ONE bathroom. I chose Heartland due to its close proximity to The Amsterdam Theatre. I had a little over an hour until showtime, but gladly didn't have to worry because service was FAST despite it being a Friday after 6pm.I ordered the Buffalo Bleu Burger with a salad. The salad was light with a tangy vinaigrette. The burger was moderately sized and cooked perfectly medium. The only not-so-appetizing feature was entirely visual: the juices from my burger ran out and into bleu cheese that had run off the burger... sooo it was a chunky pink puddle of cheesy juice. Check in on your Yelp app to receive a free slice of cheesecake.  It was delicious and probably way too much but, hey, when you walk an average of 10 miles per day, it's justified, right? :)Service was fine: attentive but unobtrusive.They have free Wi-Fi as well.The ONLY downside is there is ONE unisex bathroom, so don't wait until the last minute, because even in a semi-empty dining room, a line regularly formed.I'd make a return trip if I was in the area - despite the location and busy time of day, it was a solid, non-chaotic option!",9,4,8

She asked me to sit on a high chair near the bar even though there were clearly seats in the back.Burger was fine. Quite small for the price but probably medium rare. No juices though.

There were four of us, the hamburgers were excellent the tuna on a hamburger bun was excellent. Just enough ginger and a little bit of sesame to create an outstanding flavor profile.

The bar is nothing that stands out, just your typical bar in anywhere USA but it was next to Port Authority and I had time to kill so I figured a drink and a quick bite. Beer was good ordered an appetizer and it took forever--bartender kept apologizing it was taking so long--as it got closer to my departure time I asked if she could put the order in a to-go box. A few minutes later it came out and I had just enough time to catch my bus. I ordered buffalo chicken spring rolls. Ate them on the bus. They were uninspired and a bit dry. Even the Buffalo wing and blu cheese dipping sauces were eh. Picked off most of the outer layer and just ate the chicken pieces probably would have a beer there again but not likely any food.

The choice was a last minute find from a trusted reviewer who regarded it as one of the top five burgers in the city. I wouldn't have minded the price so much if I had actually enjoyed the burger. The rich and small Pat LaFrieda patty was under seasoned, and the meat had too much fat. I couldn't really get any sense of flavor from the crust.With tots added, along with cheese on the burger, this very small sandwich turned into a $16 meal. Service was also a bit scattered.I was in a hurry, and should have been more patient and gone to Shake Shack.",1,,

My friend recommended it, as she had limited time after work, before catching her bus home upstate. The food was decent- we just shared some appetizers and a couple glasses of prosecco. Service is good. Atmosphere is fine. Nothing special, but not bad either. Probably a little overpriced based on its location in a somewhat touristy area. Convenient and decent, though.",1,1,1

57,Steve W.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,65,0,2.0,6/14/2017,"I feel that their advertisement as one of top 5 burgers in NYC is just a ploy to get you in the door.  As a New Yorker, I would steer clear from this establishment if you want a nice burger for $15.  After my first bite, I felt the taste of a frozen bubba burger that you would buy from a ShopRite Supermarket, in which one can easily make at home.  Not only that, HB's lettuce and onion condiments that came with the classic burger were horrendous.  Just soggy chopped lettuce and onion.  Awful.  I would only come here for their craft beer.  Period.",1,,
58,Eliza N.,"Ventnor City, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,12/28/2017,Food was pretty good and they had plenty of GF options. Though the reason for the 1 Star is that the service was TERRIBLE. Waitress checked on us right as we got our food and we finished they cleared our plates and we didn't see her for 40 minutes! Wanted to order dessert and she was just taking her time and tending to other tables instead. When she came to take our dessert order she was rushing and had a little bit of an attitude. We were so appalled especially when we got our check. Be careful...they will add the gratuity to the check . It was odd because we were a party of only four. Would not go back there...we would have talked to a manager but we were just so annoyed we wanted to leave.,1,,
59,Tricia A.,"Yokosuka, Japan",32,29,8,2.0,12/1/2017,We came here very hungry amd ordered the taco salad. The salad was very strange...it was garlicky and tasted like it was drenched in Greek dressing. It tasted OK but not at all what I was expecting or in the mood for. I probably thought it was better than it really was because I was so hungry. There's way too many other good restaurants to go here.,1,,

Please Google it, sorry to be the one to let you know, but you've been saying it wrong your whole life.)  My fiancée, insistent on making me jealous, ordered a reuben.  It wasn't a sandwich she would have gone out of her way to get, but just like my lunch, it filled the ""void.""In general, the service was slow, but friendly.If you go to the bathroom, be sure to get the code from the staff.  I'm sure this is to keep non-customers out of the restrooms.  I've never been in the restrooms at the bus terminal, but based purely on reputation, I'm sure there's a reason people opt for restaurant restrooms versus the public ones.  I hope to never find out for comparison.You can't beat the location and the food does the trick.  For the GF community, the clear menu labeling is a great help!",2,1,1

65,Joseph T.,"Wildwood, NJ",71,105,109,3.0,11/14/2016,"So the experience here was not exactly superb. It's just a very typical bar restaurant concept like a Fridays or Bennigan's. There's nothing more to it than that. The menu is diverse and there is definitely something for everyone but nothing overly creative or that interesting. They did have a medium sized craft beer menu which was kind of unexpected but once again it had your standard crafts and nothing completely off the wall. But what I did notice on the beer menu were that there were plenty of drinks made with beer which was kind of interesting and something I really haven't seen before. I had a lager with lime and it was pretty good. It came out very cold and crisp. The food we had consisted of things like fish and chips fried pickles excetera. Everything was well-prepared, came out hot & presented well. Definitely not a WOW Factor but was very consistent and good. The waitress was extremely friendly and very attentive the entire time. We sat in the room that was by the bar overlooking the New York Times building. The restaurant is huge though and has several areas for you to sit. The staff in its entirety was very attentive and extremely friendly, from hostesses to food runners. Pricing is all very reasonable for New York City so it's definitely a casual spot to pop in and sit in a chain type of restaurant.",,,1

69,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1846,3.0,6/5/2015,"In going to all the breweries in NYC I knew I'd eventually have to go to Heartland. At one point they had 5 locations but between hurricane sandy destroying their South St Seaport area location and rent increases forcing them out of their original Union Square location they're left with their current line up of spots inside the Empire State Building, Port Authority, and in Times Square. They're clearly going for the tourist crowds and are willing to pay top dollar for these prime spots, they of course are passing those costs onto you with $7.50 pints (their food is no bargain either). Unfortunately they don't brew anything on premises and the place doesn't really feel like a brewery. On the plus side all their beer is made in a facility in Brooklyn by now Kelso founder and brewmaster, Kelly Taylor. If you read up on Kelly the man knows beer and has a passion for it so you know the beer at Heartland is his brainchild. Unfortunately most of the beer I recieved here could have been colder and more carbonated, I doubt warmer flat beer wasn't the ideal serving suggestion for each. I sat at the bar on a Friday afternoon so there was no major complaints about service. I only had one flight ($15-17) of six 5 oz glasses and no food so I can't comment on the food. They have 6 beers always available and 5-6 seasonal beers. When I was there two of the beers were out and I passed on a couple other options so I ended up tasting 8 of the choices. My top three favorite were all from the seasonal list (Summertime Apricot Ale, Mother's Milk Maibock, and Grateful Red lager) which is a bit disappointing that they won't always be around but then again going to a tourist area and paying $7.50 for a pint isn't in my future plans anyway.",3,1,1

72,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",949,1044,25506,2.0,6/24/2013,"Came here the other day to play catch-up with my former boss. This place was chosen by him because it works with his need to take a Port Authority NJ bus home and my need to hop on the 7 train and it's pretty close to both of our respective jobs.When I think of Heartland Brewery the first thing that comes to mind is beer. If it's anything on the food menu then you must not get out much... :-/.To munch on we ordered two appetizers - buffalo wings and mozzarella sticks. I can't speak as to the wings, but my old boss said he was disappointed because they weren't really meaty - I refrained from sampling because they appeared super spicy and that's not my thing.I ended up eating the order of mozzarella sticks by myself because after one bite he didn't like them at all - I ate them because I was starving and because with him having taken ownership of the spicy, meatless wings I was left with these...They were most definitely mozz sticks gone horribly wrong. How can you be breaded in crispy looking breadcrumb - practically black from how fried you are - and still be...soggy?! The cheese was delicious and that's what made them somewhat palatable, but not something I'd ever want to repeat...unless here and starving I suppose.Our bartender was nice enough, but ""nice enough"" isn't the best of descriptions either. He was pretty slow to ask if we wanted something each time we finished a beer and he was even slower when we were ready to close our tab. We had to ask 3 times for our check - it was a Tuesday evening and NOT that busy. No excuses here.The beers I had were the Indian River Light and a few Summertime Apricot Ales. They were both delicious and really the most redeeming factor in this place...Don't know if it's a location thing because I feel as if the Heartland Brewery on Union Square is significantly better as far as food and service go.

My boyfriend and I were catching a movie in Times Square and had some time to kill so we decided to grab a bite. We walked down to 8th ave and I saw Heartland Brewery right there at Port Authority. Since my boyfriend has never been there I decided to go there.I ordered the Shrimp wrapped in Bacon for the appetizers. It was so good and now it's my usual, when I come here. I love the little potato salad they give you but it's not the best. I get tired of the salad after a few bites. My Boyfriend ordered Buffalo Wings and he enjoyed them. For the entrée I got the Lemon Crusted Salmon which comes with Steamed Spinach, Sticky White Rice and a basil citrus sauce. I LOVED that the waiter asked me how I liked my Salmon cooked and I told him Medium. My Salmon was cooked to perfection ! It's so good, I seriously come to Heartland just for the Salmon. My boyfriend ordered the Ribs with Fries and he really liked the BBQ sauce.On my most recent visit there the waiter and I got into a little discussion about how Salmon should be cooked and I mentioned to him that I come here just for that. He said, that he's been working there for 4 years and The Lemon Crusted Salmon has never been taken back to the kitchen because it wasn't done well or because the diner wasn't happy. I definitely agree with that. I've been here about 6 times and the Salmon is always great. The service is good too ! I never had to wait for a table or had an issue with a waiter. They come by often to check up and they also refill your soda without asking them. Great service !",1,1,

The Heartland Brewery was a disappointment. Despite the fact that it did not appear to be full by any means, it took over five minutes for us to be seated.  Throughout dinner, it was nearly impossible to get the attention of a server, and while the food was satisfactory, it did not warrant its price by any means.

The poor man's version of a flight layover.  Since he had a lot of baggage he didn't want to go far so he and I along with two of his family members came here around 12:10 PM. Being in the hub of tourist central you might think it would be more crowded but I guess tourists were not interested in eating here and many locals would avoid this building unless necessary. When we finally got the waiter's attention after he took our drink orders (just water)  15 minutes ago, he asked us if we were ready to order. Two people ordered the sliders, I ordered the nachos, and an order of calamari and Buffalo wings were placed. 22 minutes later almost everything came out.  The nachos were missing. I would think that would have been quick because it would really only be a matter of heating stuff up and organizing on the plate.The ""Heartland Grande Tex Mex Nachos"" had Jack and cheddar cheeses, salsa, beef chili, guacamole, sour cream and jalapeños.  The jalapeños were not raw thankfully.  The chili had some spice and heat but not plenty.During our meal our server came back repeatedly, almost too frequently, to check on us.

I chose a specialty drink, myself. The elderflower frost was my choice and it was made to perfection. Even my second round tasted exactly the same and did not disappoint. The dining room is what I would expect from a brewery. Some what loud, but very fun and not overwhelming. The menu was limited, but there was a lot of twist on classic foods. I had the Sheppard's pie with braised beef. I was pleasantly surprised because it was more meat then potatoes which was nice not to feel weighed down for all the walking/sightseeing we still wanted to do. The fried pickles were not served as slices, but rather wedges, which made them a little less sharing friendly and not as easily ""snackable"". The tater tots are stuffed, do not get confused and think they are topped with cheese and bacon. The Caesar dressing was a bit fishy. The salmon on the other hand was fantastic. Yes, I try every dish that every one else orders. It's one of my blessings having such great friends and family. :)",,,

Conveniently located adjacent to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, its has the perfect trifecta of friendly service, delectable cuisine, and freshly brewed beer. Although I wouldn't call myself a regular, I do frequent the bar from time to time on my way home to NJ. Couple reasons, I can't give the place a five star rating: 1. the menu is slightly overpriced (which is understandable given the location I suppose), and 2. I get the sense that this establishment may be transforming into another lousy Charlie Brown's. I mean, why on Earth would management start this new masculine looking button down shirt/ necktie uniform for the female bar staff? Who wants to look at that after a hard of work? Ugh! I hope someone addresses that sooner than later! Anyway, whether you're a local or an out-of-towner, stop in for bite and a drink, pretty sure you'll love the place.",,,

124,Laila M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,1/29/2017,"Heartland Brewery is great for its delicious buffalo wings, buffalo spring rolls and fresh beer! I took a trip to Heartland Port Authority tonight with my boyfriend craving some fish tacos (he's hooked on those HB fish tacos) but sadly we never knew they only serve that dish in certain locations like HB chophouse. Even though it was sad news...there is better news to come. The food was great, I had the pu-pu platter which is 5 small plates of 5 small portions of appetizers (I'm a small girl who looks at a menu and simply wants EVERYTHING)! My boyfriend went with the fish & chips . He was happy (thank god) MOST IMPORTANTLY ABOUT OUR VISIT WAS OUR SERVER JAYELENE F!! SHE WAS SO SWEET and friendly, she was welcoming, down to earth and I loved her happy spirit she gave off. We didn't feel rushed, she recommended other options for me since I can't eat pork bacon (I know I'm missing out on something probably very amazing). It was a peaceful dinner, it's reasonable pricing, and we got great service for a quick meal. This is my first written review ever about a restaurant and I'm one who is SOOOO BIG on customer service and Jayelene really brought it through. Defiantly returning to Heartland Brewery!",,1,

Tonight was no exception. In the past I've always gone to the Union Square location. Tonight I stopped by the Port Authority spot. Unsure of what to choose the bartender poured little samples of the pumpkin and the apricot ales I chose the apricot and thoroughly enjoyed every sip.

They also have yummy fried pickles and their beer was good too.   It seemed like most people that come here are on their way in or out of the city and just want to grab a drink and sit down with their suitcases.    Apparently if you are a customer and want to use the bathroom you have to ask the hostess for a code.  My boyfriend said he went to use one of the two co-ed bathrooms and there was this old lady just chilling in there with the door unlocked.  Sooo...lol I'm not really sure what that was about but I didn't use the bathroom there so my experence was pretty good.",,,

129,Adam B.,"Newport News, VA",444,520,22,3.0,4/8/2013,"As we walked past the crowded bar to the much more open dining room, I noticed the beer memorabilia on the wall, which pretty much spelled out what this place was all about. I ordered a pint of Red Rooster ale, which our waiter said tasted similar to a Bass or Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I'm a big fan of Bass and with the cold temperatures outside, I thought I'd go for something a little darker than what I normally drink. It was darker than those other beers and had a bitter taste, which I didn't especially like. I also tried a taste of the Cornhusker lager, but it was just too light for my taste. So I can't say I was in love with the local brews.For a starter, we went with the BBQ spice rub shrimp. I likes that it came with some fresh guacamole along with a salsa wit poblano peppers and lime. It had some heat to it, but it wasn't overwhelming. Good opener.I ordered the bison burger and I love that it came on a Martin's potato roll, maybe the best bun for a burger in the world. which is always a good sign. The bison was juicy, it wasn't a huge sized burger though. It cost me $2.50 to add American cheese and sautéed onions which were great additions, but what made the burger outstanding was the side of chipotle BBQ sauce. I put some of that on the burger and used the rest of it to dip my fresh cut fries in. This was an excellent smoky and spicy BBQ sauce. I also sampled the fish and chips and although the fish's coating was crunchy, I felt the fish was not moist and a little bit overdone.So I enjoyed my food experience moreso than the beer. It's a decent place to stop in, but I don't know if I'm salivating to go back. This is really closer to a 3.5 star review.",,,
130,La S.,"Great Neck, NY",294,630,101,2.0,5/29/2014,Not the best experience of my life.  I will give them this:  the beer is really good and worth trying the sampler/all of the brews they have.  The food is only meh and the service was beyond ridiculous:  slow and not good.  I had fish and chips that tasted too much like chicken fingers.  The only food I like was the cookie dough pie and their fried pickles.,1,,
131,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,829,135,3.0,2/23/2013,"A fine, clean place for a bite and a beer. It's nothing special, but it's also a clean, reliable place for a meal. The service at the bar was very good, with an informed and interesting bartender.  The table service was a little less spectacular.  The food was good, not terrific, which is what you'd expect for a place like this.  I ordered the hamburger after seeing on the menu that it was one of New York's finest, and it wasn't. I've had much better.With a lot of interesting dining choices nearby, Heartland doesn't stand out, but if you want a beer and a decent meal around the Port Authority Bus Terminal, I'm sure you do much worse.",,,
132,Teneka W.,"Baltimore, MD",76,177,216,3.0,1/4/2016,"Typical bar food. However, I stopped here specifically for the buffalo wings because I'd remember how good they were a few years prior when I ate here. Service was excellent with the waiter Javier. I thought that may have been his stage name (everybody in NY seems to have one) turns out it was his real name. I thought that they closed a little to early for NY standards but I guess being inside Port Authority maybe that's typical. We were literally kicked out at midnight by the bouncer who was a little rude about it, although he came around about 10 min prior banging on the table to give us our 10 min warning. Yeah he was a little rude about it but whatever. Check in on Yelp for a free dessert (my cheesecake) which Javier was kind enough to substitute it for the warm apple pie which was delicious.",,,

Since there were 3 of us we scored a foursquare checkin for a free appetizer, so that was pretty cool.We also ordered a cookie pie - I expected it to be like a pizookie from BJ's but it's more of an actual thick slice of pie made out of cookie dough.  Pretty good, but I still prefer the hot gooey fresh thin cookie from BJs.",1,,

The bartender was fun and flirty, but eh, I'm married. Its appreciated though.It was a pretty good place overall, and it was a great start to my day.

However, their food is really at or slightly below average and every time I cash out I am flabbergasted at how much money I've spent on a couple of brewskies and an appetizer without realizing it. I split a burger ($12.95) with someone at this location and it was really just, ""meh,"" but the side of grilled asparagus was great, tho a bit on the salty side. Also note, the service I had at this location was actually very good.

For you spice heads, it comes with extra buffalo sauce for dipping.I ordered the Heartland Burger medium with sweet potato fries. While the circumference of the burger wasn't much to write home about, the thickness and flavor are. It was a juicy, meaty, fresh tasting burger - one of the better ones I've had. Sweet potato fries were thin and crispy but soft on the inside, perfect for crunch-munching or dipping.My lady had the Turkey Burger with salad (house made vinaigrette blend dressing). A good meaty and juicy burger. Both were served on toasted potato rolls - a plus in my book.Our waiter was knowledgeable, attentive and overall great. He actually recommended the menu because there were a lot of things I wanted to try.My only bone to pick (but I can't be too mad because it's times Square) is the price. $63 for one appetizer, two entrees and two sodas (no beer, wine or alcohol)? That's just outside Yelp's '$$' rating. - it's well into the '$$$' range if you add some beers or alcohol with your meal. Don't let the individual prices deceive you - once you add everything up with tax and tip it can be a bit surprising.But again, this is Times Square 42nd street. And for the nice atmosphere, great service, and pretty good tasting food - I will likely return.So says a newfound member of the OTHER folk.",1,,1

The front of the house is nice and warm during the winter time. Long bar stretches its way past a few TVs. High top tables surround the perimeter, and the dinning area is large enough to accommodate large groups.They had about 6 different Heartland Brews on tap. Got to tasting a few, all nice change of pace from the usual yuenglings and bud lite.My favorite was the oatmeal stout, which was creamy and smooth.I'd compare it to a Guinness but without the darker coffee flavor.  A tasty beer, but I couldn't put down more than two of these, since it was so rich. I like the fun facts they have on the website:In English pubs, ale is ordered by pints and quarts... So in old England , when customers got unruly, the bartender would yell at them 'Mind your pints and quarts, and settle down.'It's where we get the phrase 'mind your P's and Q's'I'll have to stop back again during the summer time to try their other selections.",2,,1

The bar was quiet only 2 or 3 others, but that's was not unexpected at 2pm. Sat at and ordered my lunch and drinks from the bar where another couple and a 3yo child were sitting also. Weird, children not allowed at the bar where I live. The conversation was flowing between them and over heard all about their holiday, upcoming Halloween, thanksgiving and Christmas plans. Heard about the love life of the waitress dating a younger bus boy also working at Blondies. Hard to enjoy the experience with a rowdy threenager yelling out. The waitress was lucky to have said 2 sentences with me, didn't ask how the food was, (and it was very ordinary... way too vinegary..) at least the bottles of miller lite was tasty to wash it down. Needless to say, the 9 of us did not return to Blondie for dinners, and will not be returning anytime soon. Major disappointment.",,,

159,James C.,"New York, NY",19,60,11,4.0,8/28/2012,"I've been coming to this Heartland location since they opened, in fact, I visited both prior restaurants in this space on a regular basis before they went out of business.  If this HB closes, I'm going to assume it's me, not them.I've probably been here a dozen times or more, I go about twice a month on my way back to NJ.  I only eat two things, the HB Burger Platter, rare, and Buffalo Spring Rolls.  I love both...I think the HB Burger (at this location, not all of the HB's serve ""this"" burger) is generally an excellent version of the ""smash"" burger.  The fries are also generally good, as long as they aren't overcooked, which has only happened once or twice.  On the occasion I swapped fries for a salad the greens were nice and fresh and the salad was filling. The Buffalo spring rolls are a tasty deep fried hot and cheesy snack.  I'm a real beer aficionado, and I can honestly say the beer disappoints me here.  Seasonal, regular, special, all lack any creativity of note.  I find myself returning to their version of an IPA on most evenings because it's the best of a bland bunch...heck if I want great beer Pony Bar is a few blocks away.I don't do dessert, and every time I've veered away from my HB burger and spring rolls I've been disappointed, but never got anything that was inedible.I love the service, but now that I'm a ""regular"" I know most of the wait staff, so I always get things exactly the way I want them.  I always enjoy hitting this place and then getting on the bus home 10 minutes later.  An easy quick good burger in a city filled with good burgers that are rarely easy or quick.",3,1,

161,Alex Q.,"Raleigh, NC",44,15,1,5.0,5/9/2013,"This was my first time here and I was not disappointed.  Actually, neither were the 16 other people with me.  We had just finished the Revlon Run/Walk for Women's Cancer (5K) and were looking for a place with good burgers and good beer.  Although the name in itself sounded just like what we were looking for,  we chose this place because of its location - right in the Port Authority Bus Terminal.  Eat, drink and then have easy access to the bus to NJ? Sign me up!...especially after a 5K!I'm not going to go discuss and describe the food in this review.  Just know that they have very good burgers, the tots are AMAZING and they have good brews at reasonable prices; especially given the prime real estate they sit on.    The important stuff here is the service this place will give you. We arrived at the restaurant around 11:30, which is when they open.  I can't imagine what must have been going through the minds of the staff when they saw all 17 of us walk in the door; not even 20 seconds after they opened.  The staff and Javier, the manager went above and beyond to accommodate us.  They moved and positioned our tables around in such a manner that would keep us together while ensuring we were all comfortable without imposing on other customers.  On our table, a glass never went below half without our server or a ""runner"" asking if we wanted another drink or a refill.  Additionally, we didn't have dirty plates or empty glasses stacking on the table and all food came out as ordered within a very reasonable amount of time.  As it turns out, we later ended up speaking to some of the other people that were in the restaurant eating when we were as we noticed they too participated in the run/walk.  They had nothing but great things to say about the food and service they received as well.Needless to say,  I was very happy that we decided to come here after participating in a event that was for a great cause!  It was a good way to wrap up a great morning/early afternoon.  I will definitely come here again!",,,1

We ordered a sampler, of course, with EIGHT beers!(and of course after the bartender realized we were beer connoisseurs, he gave us a 9th on the house.)Here's what we had: (scores from 1-5, 1 is the best, 5 is the worst)Cornhusker Lager       Lager   corn, teeny bitter, pale ale-esque, plain, better than other similar lagers         2.5Empire Premium Beer Czech Lager    not flavorful enough, plain but very drinkable, like Heineken           2.5Farmer Joe's Oatmeal Stout    Stout   very creamy, light espresso flavor, light body, not carbonated enough for me            3Harvest Wheat            Wheat  very light, 2-row, no banana, light citrus.

Heartland has all of that in a very Times Square-centric location. The food is a mix between standard bar fare of burgers, sandwiches, etc. but they also have a good mix of entrees that are simple yet satisfying. But clearly the star of the show is their excellent mix of homemade beers on tap. Everything from a simple pale ale to ones with pumpkin and apricot. All in all Heartland is a winner.",,,

The beers were good, but got warm pretty soon. The food was not bad at all. The busboys were clearing the empty plates and the wooden tray for the sample almost over zealously. I guess they are always in demand.My main complaint is with the rest rooms. There are only two of them! The restaurant seats about 80-100 and there are two frickin unisex restrooms. I had to wait for a bit to use the restroom. I told my friends to get in line before they start getting an urge the next time.

190,Dez A.,"New York, NY",21,136,34,2.0,11/25/2012,"I'll start by saying that practically everything on the menu is $5-6 more than it should be. The food is mediocre and sometimes the service is too. Wait, there's this one tall, thin, blonde guy who's very attentive, polite, and knowledgable about menu items. He's great. But, the waitress my friend and I had last night was a different story. It was early evening and the place was nearly empty and yet she was too busy...doing whatever...to check on us. First thing she says to us is, ""I didn't even see you guys..."" to explain why we had to wait so long to order. That pretty much set the tone for the rest of the night as we seemed to be invisible to her.The food: I've eaten here 3 times. The first time, I had the warm grilled chicken sandwich. It's (allegedly) composed of 3 foods that I LOVE! Chicken, sourdough bread, and bacon! What could go wrong? I dunno. But, something went wrong. Sourdough is my absolute favorite and the bread used on this sandwich did NOT taste like sourdough. At all. I'm pretty sure it was rye. The seemingly one slice of bacon used on the sandwich...well, that just irked me even more. All in all, the sandwich sucked. I should also add that the following day, I got violently ill and threw up that evening. At first, I thought it might be the beer since that was the only thing I'd had outside of my norm, until a friend suggested that it may've been the food. Could've been, I dunno. But, since I have other friends who've never gotten sick there, I decided to give 'em another shot. Sooo, on my 2nd visit, I tried the turkey burger. It wasn't much bigger than a White Castle burger and seemed to have been prepared with absolutely no seasonings or spices. The only thing that made that burger edible was the A1 Sauce that I'd doused it in. Third visit, I had the lauded HB burger. After reading some of the reviews here, I couldn't wait to try it. How was it? Bland, flavorless, no bigger than a slider, and again, saved by damn near half a bottle of A1 Sauce. Oh, and I'd requested that bacon be added to my HB burger. I didn't even taste the bacon until the 2nd to last bite. Again, 1 measely effin' slice?? I make better burgers, and I can't even cook.The drinks: I'm not a beer drinker, but on my first visit, I said, ""when in Rome..."" So, I had a some beer with sprite in it, whatever it was called. It was good. I thought, if all beer tastes this good, I can see why people love it so much. I wasn't able to finish it though. Then again, not a beer drinker. Second visit, I had some fruity cocktail which was very good. Last night, I had their egg nog concoction which was also pretty good. If you go for the drinks, hopefully, you won't be disappointed. The drinks are the only thing that keeps me from giving Heartland one star, by the way.The last couple of visits were mainly because there were lines for Dallas BBQ's on 42nd. I've been eating at Dallas BBQ's, all around the city, for over 20 years now and that place never lets me down. Everything's reasonable priced, huge spirited, imaginative drinks, and generous servings of food that, 9.9 times out of 10, last me two days. On our next outting, I think I'll just stand patiently in line at BBQ's rather than suffer yet another pitiful, unsatisfying meal at Heartland's.",,,

You know what though, it's a really good one..  Can't remember the brand, but ask 'em about that, goes well nice with dinner...(any, that is)My friend wanted a cocktail and of course she wanted the barman to ""surprise"" her.. Apparently he did a really god job at that...Anyways, She had the buffalo burger and I had the Greek salad... Great stuff... We both agreed that the place is great and we really enjoyed ourselves so we came in a few days later for some beer and Shepard's pie... Ohh, spot on, was really good, I really enjoyed that one... Despite my first disappointment that it doesn't come in gravy.. Oh well...This is such a great place.. I actually brought my family here for the 3rd time around and we all had dinner/ different dishes (They have a great menu, it's not too filled with a gazillion dishes, but it offers a great verity for all to be pleased...)This time I tried their appetizers... The onion rings are a must have an the mozzarella sticks are delish!!(Oh and I must also add that their sauces are amazing...)  I highly recommend this place... It's very central, located on 42nd and 8th Ave.Great prices, amazing service, great food, awesome beer!!!Cheers!!",1,,
195,ronald m.,"New Rochelle, NY",1,9,1,1.0,12/21/2014,I happened to have dinner at this location with my family. The server asked me twice how I wanted my burger cooked I said rare when I received it the burger was almost well done. On top of that I received my burger about 5 minutes after everyone in my table received their food. Another thing in the description it read that it was a buffalo burger it did not resemble at all it tasted like a regular beef burger to. Not pleased with this place.,,,

I would not even consider this place to hangout after work for a beer, just because I didn't like the ambience, it just doesn't gives you that feeling of relaxation.Food was tasteless, we ordered crab cakes and grilled shrimp and left most of it.",,,

Two of us stopped in for a beer and fries before catching our train back to Connecticut. The fries were pretty good, reminiscent of fairgrounds food (to me, anyway), and our server was prompt and friendly. But the beer wasn't what I expect from a brew pub. I had a classic English style bitter, and it disappointed, relying more for flavor on the hops than I'd expected. The result was more of a poorly balanced IPA. I've had better.",,,

We were starving and didn't want the usual fast food. After ditching out on our original idea of Red Lobster and Ruby Tuesdays due to 1 hour plus wait times, I suggested we check this place out since it was on our way through Port Authority on our way home. We got seats stat and the server was nice. The fried pickles were amazing and the mozzarella sticks were honestly the best I've ever had. The cheese was fresh and gooey and their breading is unique. I got the 6 beer sampler and wasn't disappointed and my girlfriend got the strawberry blonde beer and really liked it. We both really enjoyed our entrees, mine being the ribs (fell off the bone and great BBQ flavor) and her's being the seared salmon. We will definitely come here again.",,,
199,Chris D.,"Leonia, NJ",376,513,883,2.0,5/24/2011,"Seeing the reviews before i Went I did not have high hopes by any means.  Going in expectations low, only because we wanted some good beer, and not knowing where to find it in the city this seemed like the best bet at the time.  I started with the beer sampler because well... i wanted to try them all.  and a plate of nachos because it seemed like a place that would have good nachos.  Ok so nachos were not very good.  They weren't bad... i still ate them.. but very lacking flavor with no spice at all.  And that was with the chili on them... well at least the have Tabasco sauce on the table.....   And the beer.. Was nothing special either.  Better then the common taps but still not much depth to them.Over all: food about as bad as i had expected.               drink,  slightly worse then expected.               service, good.",1,1,
