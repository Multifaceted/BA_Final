0,1,10/6/2018,0,,"FLUSHING, NY",Sameer S.,0.0,5.0,2,This is a very cute Korean Mom and Pop place which gives you a very homely feeling The food is super delicious and top notch and I will certainly recommend this place to anyone in the area for some authentic Korean cuisine,
1,3,9/2/2018,28,,"Brooklyn, NY",Sophia L.,16,5.0,22,"Nice little mom and pop restaurant that I will definitely recommend. We ordered the spicy octopus over rice, bulgogi over rice, and spicy rice cakes with cheese. It came with 4 banchan plates and refreshing soups (tasty chilled vinegar naengmyeon soup). We definitely ordered too much for 2 people because portions are big. Total came to about $40 before tip.The most notable thing about this place is the owner's grade school daughter who speaks Korean and Mandarin, and was playing trap music behind the counter LOL. When we walked by after checking out the puppy store across the street, she was practicing on her keyboard piano. This girl is going to places!",
2,,8/27/2018,17,,"Jamaica, NY",Devindra S.,2,3.0,17,"GF and I were craving some Korean food & remembered that my sister had recommended Gossip House. Upon entering, you could tell this is a legitimate family run restaurant. A little girl took our order and her parents served us about 10-15 minutes later. We ordered the spicy bulgogi hot pot, rice cakes w cheese & ramen, and the spicy squid over rice. Having eaten Korean food almost exclusively in K town over the years, the bulgogi did leave something to be desired - the flavor wasn't quite as strong as I'm used to. The rice cakes & ramen were pretty tasty with a sweetish sauce. The biggest loser was the spicy squid over rice . Squid was a tad hard and not as well flavored as I expected, especially after such a raving recommendation from my sister... maybe I got this dish on an off night. Overall, the value proposition is excellent, so if you're looking for value Korean food, this is a great spot: maim dishes are around 12 bucks for huge servings. Sidenote: I took the bulgogi to go and and some the next day. Flavor had settled in and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If it jad tasted that way as I was eating in the restaurant I would've been a happy camper.",

It makes everything taste better when you know the whole family is working to make the business a success. From the daughter and son to running the front and mom/dad/grandma cooking in the back. I could really taste the ""seoul"" in each dish. I came with my wife and we ordered the fried chicken in sauce which was a eye opener, I never had fried chicken done this way, sweet and spicy, almost candied. My wife loved the cold noodles and I loved my bulgogi pot. It was a delicious dinner for a good price. Gossip House is one of those places for homemade momma made goodness so the restaurant is a bit on the smaller side. Seating can be tough if you have a big party BUT you can always order takeout. I will be ordering takeout from here often.",2

It is cozy and comfortable in here!My friends and I started with banchan which are super fresh and a nice bite before digging into our meals. We shared the Spicy Squid Kimbap, I loved how fresh the ingredients are. We got it with very spicy. The squid seems more like the dried squid but it worked well with the other ingredients. We got the Spicy Pork over Rice, Green Onion Hangover Soup, Bibambap, Cold Noodles, and the Spicy Sauce Cold Noodles. All were really good choices. The variety of food that they offer here was great and it covers what you may crave for the day.Inexpensive, great food, and it just gets it done! I loved how friendly the owner and his family were. It was such a homey vibe overall!",2

Maybe because of the way it looked from the outside. Today, I tried gossip house for the first time. The food was here pretty good and service was good.I ordered the seafood pancake. The seafood pancake came in a big plate. The serving was bigger than what most restaurants give and there were a lot of seafood inside. I liked the seafood pancake it tasted very good. The price was very good too. Much cheaper than a lot of other Korean restaurants around this area.Also got the bulgogi hot pot. The Bolgogi hot pot was a little too sweet. Other than that the taste was alright. I ordered a spicy tuna roll. But, I'm pretty sure they got it mixed up with another roll. The roll that they served me did not have any spicy tuna in there. I did not return the rolls because it didn't taste that back. So, I just kept it and ate it wi h no complaints.",2

If you get spicy Kimbap, it's pretty spicy.They give kimchi, string beans, broccoli, cauliflower & cucumber kimchi as banchan. The cabbage kimchi is too fermented for me but it's still good. The string beans & broccoli & cucumber put out the fire in your mouth if the food is too spicy. They also give tea which I didn't drink since I only drink milk tea with sugar. I would've appreciated a glass of water as soon as I sat down instead of having to ask for it though.",2
7,,5/20/2018,16,,"Flushing, Queens, NY",Dana H.,63,4.0,170,"Gossip House is a small Korean restaurant on Northern Blvd near 150th st. When I was here, I ordered a omelet rice and kimbap. I've passed by this place many times but I never had the chance to actually eat here. It's a small place but it gets very busy. The omelet rice was different from any other ones I've had. The sauce wasn't ketchup based, but it was a bit more creamy? Maybe savory? They also don't have a lot of tables, especially when it gets busy, but the staff is very nice. Tip: If you're pressed for time, I recommend calling 15 minutes before hand and ordering your food. I didn't realize how long it would take for the food to come out so I almost burned my mouth trying to finish everything before going out to work.",
8,,11/12/2018,23,,"Los Angeles, CA",Christina E.,6,5.0,7,I love coming here not only because the food truly tastes like grandmas cooking but also because of the service. The grandma that cooks in the back is the sweetest!,

I love the small, cozy feel of this place.- Bulgogi pot --liked it. It has sweet green peppers and scallions, as well as black pepper which was very pronounced. This was just right...not too sweet or salty.- Fried crispy chicken --very crispy and topped it off with mayo. The bf ate the whole thing (besides a few small pieces I tried)- he took it without the spicy sauce, but maybe next time since I'm sure we will be back!- Seafood pancakes --good, on the gooey side, but good. Soy sauce provided. The appetizers were so good! Kimchi was amazing- not tasteless or watered down, but actual flavor. Peanuts (did not try) was covered in sesame seeds (bf liked it), sesame broccoli (yum yum, but I have a thing for sesame so...), and mushrooms (mixed types- so good...NEED MORE). Yeah, I don't know what else to write except that I will most likely be back.",13

Food was well prepared with all utensils and banchan (side dishes) which are 2 big factors when I order at a korean restaurant.The insides of the gossip house includes a pictured main menu right on top as you walk in with seating to the left and right fitting about 2-4 per table. On this particular day there was only 1 patron dining in alone (not sure if it was an employee). Music was practically inaudible because of the low volume and there was a young girl (possibly daughter) of the shop-owner humming some melody. I believe the young boy handling the food front of house was the son? Ultimately the vibe was just extremely awkward and I can't imagine dining in. However, The food was well tempted and tasted amazing for a great price. So now I'll know to drop by there for take out orders.",

The store is a straight mom and pop shop ran by an adorable family. The food was served quicker than any place I have been and so fresh and hot! The prices are very fair and they take Credit card with minimum of 10$. I must have ordered half the menu but everything was delicious, especially the spicy pork & beef bulgogi pots. The orders come with banchan (Korean side dishes to eat along with rice and meal). Would recommend to anyone! Will be a constant visitor.!!",

20,2,4/19/2018,263,,"Manhattan, NY",Ji In P.,26,5.0,17,"Gossip House seems like an odd choice of name for a small restaurant, but the name makes a lot more sense in Korean. Found this place randomly and visited with a friend. They serve boonsik (street food?) that most other Korean restaurants in flushing do. However, their food is by far the best I've had (compared to Rolly, Kim-Ga-Nae, etc). The restaurant is a no frills kind of place--if anything take out!",1

Service was alright. They seemed to have a lot of regulars who work in the area and stop in for a quick lunch.I had the dolsot bibimbap and seafood pancake. Both were good and $11 each. The bibimbap could've used some meat though. I didn't know it would be completely vegetarian. The pancake had a good amount of squid which was worth it and a nice crunch and thickness, but I wasn't a huge fan of the green peppers in it. It also didn't come with any dipping sauce which made a taste a bit bland, but everything was very fresh with quality house made banchan dishes to go with our food. They also gave us complimentary soup. All in all, I enjoyed the meal.",1

I was so happy that they gave us banchan even though we ordered takeout. I loved the cold noodles. It was so pretty and tasted very refreshing. I really liked the vinegar taste in the cold broth and the buckwheat noodles! We also got beef kimchi fried rice (had the option of beef or chicken) which was a bit spicier than the usual kimchi fried rice I've had but still delicious. The spicy beef kimbap was also very good. I love the food here and will definitely come back!,

(a tad oily though)the flavors of the pork bulgogi reminded my boyfriend of KFC chicken. not sure what he meant but i totally recommend this dish, it was deelishhhoh, and our waitress, whom we believe to be the daughter, wrote our order down in chinese and was speaking korean. she was probably only 13 years old...wuuuuuuttt",1
24,,6/9/2018,22,,"New York, NY",Ufei C.,1,5.0,47,"Gossip House is a glimpse into the lives of its owners in all its simplicity, serenity, and value. I was at once greeted by the maitre d' who doubles as the waiter, busboy, and maybe even chef. The atmosphere is filled with an ode to what's important to them in the restaurant - pictures of Korean food, wall art of the City's most notable buildings, music that speaks to their faith, and a space in which their entire family can participate and be together. I waited at my table for a full 25 minutes for the rest of my party to show up and never once did I feel rushed by the staff. The food is stuffed with the good stuff and not much of the fillers. We ordered a Seafood Pancake that was crispy on the outside and thick enough to conceal a large amount of mouth-watering seafood. Next up is their namesake traditional kimbap and a spicy tuna kimbap. These rolls were so large, that we found it difficult to finish two between the three of us. The kimbaps were stuffed with egg, radish, carrot, spinach, etc in proportion to a layer of rice with a delicious texture and chew. Last up is a piping hot kimchi bulgogi pot, again, filled with kimchi and bulgogi. I left as stuffed as the food and even had some left over to fill a small doggie bag to satisfy my craving the next morning. At just $8-$12 for most dishes large enough to satisfy any non-competitive eater, this is the best value in town.",

Also ordered a veggie leaf wrap and bulgogi pot. I'm pretty fail when it comes to spicy food so I asked for the bulgogi pot (comes with rice)to be slightly spicy and it came out perfect!

27,,2/22/2018,271,,"Queens, NY",Christina E.,276,5.0,142,"A few months ago, my husband and I decided to try a fairly new restaurant called Gossip House in Flushing, Queens. If you're not paying attention, it's easy to walk past this brick and mortar. Gossip House is a Korean restaurant located on 147th Street & Northern Blvd. The restaurant is small but brightly lit by natural light. Gossip House is a family operated business. The parents cook the dishes, their son handles the register and their daughter helps with bringing glassware and water. If I remember correctly, there were less than 10 tables in the restaurant. They had plastic containers for utensils on each table. Their utensil bins had spoons and metal chopsticks. Some people might be put off by that, but I appreciated how the tables were set like how a dining table would be set in someone's home in Korea. They had quite a handful of dishes on their menu but we decided to try one of their appetizers and we both tried different dishes. We tried the Stuffed Sesame Leaves, with pork and rice- it was really good. I do think that the flavor leaned towards sweet but I actually liked it that way. They also served four smaller dishes of the traditional Korean appetizers: glazed nuts, kimchi, mushrooms and cucumbers. Michael and I both really them and we finished of all them. Their portions were just the perfect size. As for our main dishes, I went for the Pork Katsu and Michael decided to go with Bulgogi over Rice. When they brought them out, we were both quite surprised by how big the plates and the portions were (not that it's a bad thing). The pork katsu was served with slaw and gravy. The pork katsu reminded me so much of country fried steak and I absolutely loved it! The gravy that was generously poured on top of the katsu was probably the best gravy I've ever had (and I've been to quite a handful of fancy Thanksgiving dinners). It didn't have the typical saltiness of gravy and it definitely tasted familiar. Michael and I assumed that it was made with pumkpin.  I was really curious about the gravy, I ended up asking the cook what he used to make the it. He said that he used carrots- and I don't even like carrots that much! Before I talk your ears off about this gravy, let me move onto the Bulgogi over Rice that Michael got. Well, they weren't kidding about there being rice as the plate was served with a heap of it. Michael did like it, although he had expected something similar to other bulgogi he's had previously. I think we definitely will come back and try other dishes from their menu. It's very easy to want to continue supporting this family. The dad/cook was very vocal about how he wants to know what people think of his cooking and the food.",1

I ordered the pork katsu and two kimbap rolls to split with my friend, and we didn't expect such generous portions for the price! Our tea was brought out by their older teenage son, and our chopsticks and napkins were brought out by their adorable daughter (who also took the order of another table very professionally!). The food was great - you can tell someone's mom made it. It brought me back to the days when my parents ran their own Korean restaurant, and I had to work after school behind the counter.

We ordered a spicy pork bulgogi on rice, bibimbap, and beef kimbap. The portions were generous and very filling, and the taste of everything was spot on! Everything tastes like it was made with a lot of love. The bibimbap was super healthy with a lot of different veggie options, and each veg had its own flavor. I barely had to put in any spicy sauce in because the flavor was so good (some places I've been to served bibimbaps that needed to be drowned with the sauce for flavor). The boyfriend loved the spicy pork bulgogi, which had a lot of meat for its price! The gimbap was also very flavorful and each ingredient shined through with its unique taste. They gave us 4 different banchan, and were all so tasty and fresh. Our favorite definitely had to be the honey/sugared peanuts. In the end we couldn't finish and got the leftovers to take home. We left full and happy with a very reasonable bill. Can't wait to come back and try the other things on the menu!FYI it's a small hole-in-the-wall spot with not many tables, and I don't think it would be good for large groups.",

This is a small family restaurant with few tables. I have been here twice with my bf. The price was reasonable and the service was good. They give you either hot or cold tea and 3 side dishes to start off. I didn't like any of the side dishes (peanut was too sweet and kimchi was too salty and spicy) but they were free so whatever. The first time we got:1. Spicy rice cake: big portion but too sweet 2. Spicy squid pot: a mix of onion, peppers, scallion, carrots.. very flavorful and delicious and it comes with rice Second time:1. Bibimbap: I really like how you can taste the flavors of the vegetables, unlike other bibimbap where the sauce overpowers the other things inside (it would be perfect if it came with soup) 2. Spicy bulgogi: same as spicy squid pot, just beef instead of squid",1

Even though the place is small, the atmosphere is very homely and the owner is very nice and quick to serve and explain the dishes. We got the fried tofu rice balls, bibimbap and seafood vegetable noodle soup. The side dishes were the kimchi, peanuts and lotus root were both savory yet a little sweet, which I liked. The fried tofu rice balls were seasoned well and I liked the thin layer of tofu topped with sesame seeds. The beef bibimbap came with the sauce on the side. The seafood vegetable noodle soup is what makes me want to come back here again and again. It was spicy and had a very generous portion of shrimp, mussels and veggies. The noodles were surprisingly made al dente style which made all the more filling. I can't wait to come back and try out more of their dishes.",16

The banchan was delightful. The cold noodles aren't spicy at all, but still very good. Service was good, they have their children helping out with the service, which was cute.

I had called in to place my pickup order and the most adorable little girl answered, took my order, greeted me when I arrived, and brought my food out. Super cute, I don't think she was a day over 8. Don't worry OSHA, her mom was right next to her the entire time. Kimbap was 10/10. Better than Song's Kimbap further down on Northern. I'll be back to try the rest!",1

49,1,4/2/2018,10,,"Rosedale, NY",Sam L.,8,5.0,11,"First thing's first: the spicy rice cakes with ramen here are to die for. This place is a small hole-in-the-wall, family owned shop but that's what makes it so great. The food is super cheap compared to most other Korean food spots and you can tell they care a lot about making their customers happy. It's never too loud and you can always expect to get your meal quickly. All in all, if you're ever in the area this spot is a MUST.",

I feel truly ecstatic to find this tasty mom and pops quick eat hidden gem on northern blvd.  I drove by several times this week and noticed the new opening sign, figured it's just another average new quick eat. One day I decided to be spontaneous and went in for a quick lunch. Never knew I would come out with 3 take out orders for my family-  that's how good it was!!  I ordered the bibimpap for myself; this dish taste very ""homey"" and ""soothing"". I felt I was eating in chef's home.  Portion was big enough with generous amount of side dishes, they constantly keep refilling them (picture). Also, It comes with a soup. With no hesitation, I ordered a soup, bulgogi rice, traditional kimbap and another bibimpap to bring home (picture) Everyone was happy and satisfied that day- thank you gossip house!! I highly recommend this gem!!!",2

56,,2/10/2018,2,1,"Jamaica, NY",Serena S.,18,5.0,20,"First off, I'm so happy to see that Gossip House has an overall rating of 5 stars. They are so very deserving of it. My boyfriend and I enjoy coming here not only for the food but also for the service! The restaurant seems to be family owned and we are always greeted by the owners  young daughter with a warm cup of tea. She is absolutely adorable and says thank you for everything while she serves you. The owners son is also very attentive. The father is also very kind and was quick to pack us extra radish kimchi when he saw how much we loved it without us even asking. The place itself is very small so don't come with a large party as the seating is limited. Moving on to the food, the bulgogi hot pot is to die for. It comes with a side of rice and of course your typical banchan fare. It's the perfect thing to warm you up on a cold winter day, both spice and temperature wise. I don't know what they're doing with their vegetables and squid over rice but I hope they keep doing it because it's so perfectly tender and I don't think I've ever eaten vegetables with more flavor than this. My boyfriend and I always order the squid over rice spicy and they definitely make it to order. People who do not eat spicy beware. We made the mistake of ordering the squid extra spicy and it was indeed EXTRA spicy but it was so delicious we didn't even care. The warmth of their service and their amazing food keeps us coming back time and time again. I'm almost reluctant to share this because I'm tempted to keep this gem hidden but they deserve recognition so go there and enjoy!",
57,,9/1/2017,65,,"San Francisco, CA",Thuy V.,621,4.0,139,"3.5 stars for food, rounded up for great value. Gossip House is a very small family business among the plethora of Korean restaurants in the area. What sets this place apart? The music...They happened to have very simple piano numbers playing softly, not classical, relaxing nonetheless. I love their seafood pancake for the fact that not only does it has tons of seafood, but also the abundant presence of green bell pepper and scallion. The execution needs improvement, though, as, the seafood was slightly over cooked making it a little chewy. Their dolsot bitmap was good but a little sad looking, and the rice was not as crunchy as it could be. I need to see a l little more colors, perhaps some carrots or red bell pepper garnish. The taste of the bowl was really enhanced by the tea leaves, reminding me of the Burmese tea leaf salad that I love so much. Contrary to some reviews the bowl does come with ground beef and a sunny side up egg. I have nothing special to say about their banchan, which is pretty standard. Will I come back? Maybe...",
58,,2/10/2018,0,1,"OAKLAND GARDENS, NY",Soso N.,3,3.0,8,I should not believe yelp reviews. I order vegetarian bibimbap (NO mushroom!) and the size is so small $11. And Tuna Kimbap has little tuna (5%) $7 are not worth. But seafood pancakes and the size dishes are good that why I give 3 stars.,
59,,7/28/2018,0,,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",Ching L.,1,5.0,2,I love the spicy squid and bulgogi on stone pot.  I would give 10 out of 10 for taste.  I will definite try out each item on the menu.,
60,,2/21/2018,69,,"Brooklyn, NY",Jade K.,8,5.0,1,"For my first written review, I wanted to find a place that deserves more recognition for their quality and effort, and Gossip House is the winner. It may be a small hole in the wall place, but by any means don't let that drive you away! My experience here was magnificent. The travel from Borough Park, Brooklyn to Flushing, Queens was definitely worth it. During the time my friend and I went, it wasn't quite busy, so service was fast and great. Once we entered, we were politely greeted and served by the family. Loved to see how they all worked together, and their children were professional, attentive and adorable. My friend and I ordered the spicy bulgogi pot and cheese rice cake with ramen. The spicy bulgogi pot was simply amazing. Sizziling and filled with sweet green peppers, onions, and sesame seeds, everything came together to create the perfect flavor. The rice cakes were sweet and savory, the perfect amount of spice, and extra chewy along with the cheese which melted in your mouth. Everything was absolutely mouthwatering and fresh. Compared to other Korean restaurants, you are guaranteed to get the bang for your buck here, along with their hearty effort. Never have I tasted such authentic homemade Korean food before. Not only the food was great, but so was the atmosphere. The inside felt cozy and warm, and the decorated walls made the place bright and fun. The music consisted of softly played piano numbers which heightened the relaxation. Overall, I am glad I discovered this place. My friend and I left full and satisfied with everything we were presented with. I am confident to say that I will be coming back again and recommend this place to all who love Korean food.",

62,2,4/3/2017,9,2,"FLUSHING, NY",Grace K.,191,5.0,16,"small restaurant on northern with a very homey feel. The side dishes felt very homey too! My friend and I got the gossip house Kimbap, spicy rice cake and at the very last minute decided to try the sesame leaf rice ball. I'm so glad we got the sesame rice balls because it was really delicious! It was sweet on the outside and savory on the inside (the owner said it had lotus and cut up chicken breast inside).  The spicy rice cake wasn't that spicy, but I can't handle foods that are too spicy, so this was perfect! The service was great and food comes out really fast! Overall the food was good, service was good and the decor inside is very cute! However this restaurant will not hold large groups!",2

This hidden gem is the most affordable, authentic and tasty Korean food place I have ever been. The friendly owners speak both Korean and Mandarin. The place is very clean and cozy and the service is fast. My husband and I enjoyed thought the small-dish appetizers were wonderful. We ordered the pork cutlet, the pork belly bulgogi pot, and the beef kimbap. The tastes were impeccable. The only issue was that we didn't know he pork belly pot was very spicy and should have asked for less or no spicy.",

72,,5/6/2018,0,,"Oakland Gardens, NY",Manu A.,0,5.0,7,"This place gives off a comfortable and homely vibe as soon as you enter. The food takes long to come but it was worth the wait as every dish was cooked to perfection with strong flavours that we don't get in many Korean restaurants. The squid over rice, ramen, and even the side dishes all delivered in flavour and texture. This place certainly needs more recognition and is gonna become my regular go to spot after years of searching for a worth it Korean restaurant. Reasonable prices combined with amazing food cooked by a humble family, I couldn't ask for more.",

Second time I came here, I ordered the bulgogi over white rice which essentially was hotpot beef mixed with kimchi and raw onions. My friend ordered the kimchi fried rice which was better. However, we both got food poisoning that same night and the food came out both ways unfortunately. I would only come back for the kimbab.",
74,,10/5/2017,170,,"Oakland Gardens, NY",Michael D.,25,5.0,15,"Yasssss, this place is great and tasty. Food tastes super fresh and hand made. You know it tastes fresh when they make it on the spot for you. Kimbaps are freshly rolled and large in portion size for a good price. Two kimbaps can probably fill you up. The spicy rice cakes are pretty tasty too and normal in portion. I came here twice, first time had a kimbap, and bibimbap. Loved every bite of it. First bite gave you the sensation of a warm home prepped family. Second bite you realize that it is a family style restaurant. Third bite you realize that you can't resist the fourth bite. Continue until finished. Bill came out affordable too. Remember to tip a bit extra because you never know whose pocket of education that money can go into. The families kids are super cute too. Seeing them help out when they're not studying is heartwarming.",

We ordered several dishes and everything is delicious! The only reason i'm not giving it a 5 star is because our oder took 2 hours to come! We ordered 10:55 am hoping to get it before 12pm for our lunch break but it came almost 1pm. It was a Saturday so i'm not sure if they have a lot of orders, but still 2 hours is just too long! Call ahead and ask how long it will take so you can plan ahead. Will still be ordering again because as I said the food are good!!!",

I pretty much found my new korean spot. The sesame roll was surprisingly good and the labokki was like a 8. The tofu with kimchi and meat was bombb and the owner was so so nice. He brought the food outside because I couldn't find parking. That's probably the only frustrating thing but other than that I was beyond satisfied:),1

81,1,5/7/2017,0,1,"Flushing, NY",Richard B.,3,5.0,9,"I tried this place since it was relatively new and had good reviews. Let me say that this place is small. It can only comfortably seat 12 people at a time. And comfortable is is used broadly here. But that should not stop you from trying this place, which was well worth it. Food was fresh and hot and delicious.  I love spicy pork over rice, Korean seafood pancake and za jha mien which is like a very dark sauce over noodles. All great. Pancake probably was one of best I've had. Cost is cheaper than most Korean restaurants but still a bit high for other restaurants in the area. They have really nice side dishes too along with tea. Bill: $34. For Korean restaurants this is quite good. And yes portions are plentiful too. Would I return?  Yes. Today if I could but they're closed Sundays. So I'll have to wait.",
