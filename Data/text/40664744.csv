1,Chris M.,"Manhattan, NY",249,23,1,2.0,11/19/2018,"I was feeling generous of giving a two-star review.  Bathroom was nasty, toilet seems to be clogged, floor needs to be mopped, sink was dirty.  My biggest pet peeve of a food service establishment is NO SOAP in the dispenser. Why would you have no soap in the dispenser?? Do you have employees or managers check the restroom every hour to make sure there is soap and it is sanitary? People take care of their personal hygiene and there should be soap in the dispenser at all times.  Starbucks charges $4.50 for premium drinks, but fail to keep the restroom up to par. Wow! Please advise.",,,
2,Gigi A.,"Manhattan, NY",132,899,5473,5.0,6/22/2018,"My new FAVORITE Bux. The customer service is so great here. The people are very friendly and they always get my drink right. They are personable without comprising professionalism.  The most noteworthy thing about this Bux is the size. It is extremely spacious with ample seating, two cleanish restrooms and outlets to work from ""home"" or just charge your phone. The location is right by many hotels so if you're staying in the area and checked out, you can kill time here with luggage until your flight.",1,,
3,Ariel L.,"EAST ELMHURST, NY",0,48,27,5.0,10/8/2018,"Okay. So... I've never written a review about Starbucks and I think this place deserved 1k starts!!!! Holy amazing! I work close by, and go here each morning. They welcome me from the door, sing to you on your birthday, and write little notes on your coffee. Sam is a real MVP!!!! Thank you for making my day!",,,
4,Melanie D.,"Queens, NY",249,496,310,4.0,12/20/2017,Very friendly staff. Great location. drinks are consistent with other locations. i must say the staff here pays more attention to mobile orders than the ones in person. i waited 15 minutes for my drink. not ok on a monday morning in midtown!,1,1,2
5,Tyler R.,"Weehawken, NJ",2200,632,1827,4.0,4/26/2017,"If there is construction in NYC, there is a 17%* chance that the resulting structure will house, in full or in part, a Starbucks. *based on no facts whatsoever Walking from my office on 33rd & Park to the Starbucks on 34th & Park was becoming a chore. Honestly, the mild gradient walking up? Nah. Thank you Starbucks - now I can basically run down a hill (definitely not a hill) to 32nd & Park, satisfying my coffee craving at any point during the day without having to walk ""up"". Well - that's all an exaggeration. I was actually surprised to see this location pop up, since it is actually really close to the other one I mentioned. But the new construction, endless light, and helpful, talkative staff (how's your day going, new friend?) has convinced me to turn left instead of right when I walk out of my office.It's actually a comparatively small building, and doesn't have a lot of tables or room to hang out, so if you plan on going there to do work, you might be rolling the dice. Other than that, the location is great, it's basically all windows, and the coffee is tops, as usual.",2,7,2
6,Sebastian F.,"San Francisco, CA",504,1063,1242,4.0,9/4/2017,"One of the larger Starbucks in the area with ample seating!

7,Andrew S.,"Miami, FL",1,12,0,2.0,6/12/2018,"VERY SLOW!While I agree (with other reviewers here) that the staff are very friendly and often greet you by name, they are EXTREMELY SLOW at EVERYTHING else. There are often 8 or more employees behind the counter and yet the wait for coffee is often 20 minutes or more.Tips for Staff: Less chit chat, less fooling around, and more chop chop. This is New York at a very busy location -- people want to get in and get out.",,,

9,Tony D.,"Bronx, New York, NY",20,88,405,4.0,7/29/2017,"Good, clean Starbucks location. There is plenty of seating and the staff is pleasant and efficient.

10,Victoria S.,"New York, NY",346,111,49,5.0,6/14/2017,"I wanted to give a quick shout out to Stephanie! She always works the morning shift when I am running into Starbucks with minutes to spare before work. I try to do mobile orders when I plan enough ahead - really saves so much time. Stephanie always checks in with the customers waiting and always makes sure that people haven't been waiting too long for their orders. Much appreciated. The location is always kept clean and is the classic starbucks vibe: people either working at a computer or talking with a friend. Tip: If you have not already - Download the Starbucks App and become a ""Rewards/Gold Member."" It costs nothing and if you go to Starbucks (like most people do) it allows you to quickly pay, order ahead, and acquire points when you purchase something. Eventually it adds up and you a free item. I always save my points for a day I forget my lunch and just run by my local Starbucks and get my free, fresh lunch!",,,

12,Jamel O.,"Jackson Heights, NY",2614,891,191,5.0,10/22/2017,This a great Starbucks location. it is big and has seating and tables. They really go the extra mile. On a good day you may find yourself rocking to 90s hip hop.,1,,

19,Beauty R.,"Rosamond, CA",0,20,14,5.0,10/2/2016,"I've been coming to this particular Starbucks location for years - before the renovation. Only those who come to this location may know what I'm talking about. Yes in the mornings it does get crowded; but what do you expect when your in the heart of Park Ave, the space is bigger then most and it's coffee----of course it's going to be busy. If you expect faster service then buy your own coffee machine or get use to mobile ordering!!!!I love all the staff! They are very accommodating and always gets it right. If it's wrong then they will do it again. Easy as 1.2.3 Now PLEASE!!!!!!!! Do not get upset if the Baristas mess up your ""triple decker splash of this that foo foo extra drizzle latte "" up! Just saying!!Great Starbucks and the evening music play list always hits the spot!",,1,
20,Kate S.,"New York, NY",580,277,370,2.0,1/28/2016,"This Starbucks is probably one of the worst I've been to. The only reason why I go to this specific Starbucks is because it's close to my work. I rarely ever come, mainly because I hate over priced ridiculously corporate coffee shops, but when I do, I always have the same unfortunate experience. First, It's always crowded. There's really never any tables any time of the day except for late nights, so good luck if you come here intending to buckle down and get work done. Second, It's disgustingly dirty every time I come here. When I do find an open table, there's always coffee stains or stale crumbs left everywhere. Their bathroom, especially, is always disgusting. Nothing says a cup of joe like the scent of pee and sight of trash on the floors. Really yummy. Third, the baristas never seem to get my order right. I usually ask for a dairy free option of milk (all they have is soy at this facility, unfortunately) and it to be unsweetened. Pretty basic, right?  Yet each and every time, It's completely forgotten. The last time I came here, they never asked me for a size, just assumed I wanted a grande so charged me for one. Alright, great, thanks. Next time you are craving Starbucks (which honestly, I don't know who does), I would recommend avoiding this one as much as possible. It's just not worth it.",5,2,2
21,Anna R.,"East Rockaway, NY",62,10,4,1.0,1/26/2017,"I've never been to a Starbucks where cashiers blatantly speak about their personal problems, while asking for your order, have you repeat 3 times and continue to go on about their business. I said to myself ""I get it, it's rush hour so minds are going in every direction at the moment???""I'm waiting for my order, minding my own business and i hear a ""psssst""...  I look up and a finger points at me, asking ""what's your order again?""

Updated review","I went back and the music was not at an all-time high. There was a meeting going on of Starbucks baristas and the manager who was leading the meeting sounded like a wonderful person to work for. I was really impressed at how much he encouraged them and how personable he was. For that, I upped it from 4 stars to 5 stars.",1,1,1
24,Amire' P.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",2,18,18,5.0,1/31/2017,"I've been coming here for the past 1.5 years and love this location. Always busy but with mobile app I get my drink when I walk in. This location is very spacious and has tons of room for studying, without feeling like you're on top of people. Had an error with an online package and the employee could not resolve it for me. Jarvis, the manager, came in and took care of the situation in a matter of minutes. I've interacted with him a few times and he always has everything in order. If something is not right or a cashier is slow, I see him getting another employee to man the lines or take care of the problem--which is important in a busy Starbucks. Would come back to support Jarvis and his team-as they give a neighborhood friendly vibe at a chain store",,,
25,Chels G.,"Manhattan, NY",78,86,46,2.0,11/16/2016,"Want to give 1 start but giving 2 starts because it was a rush hour (benefit of doubt). ""There are no spice powders left. Could I get some cinnamon please?"" ""If there's none out there, there's no more.""... um excuse me, miss barista - there's a almost full bottle of cinnamon right next to you... Basically, they can't be bothered for any extra anything during rush hour. And my grande hot drink didn't even come with whipped cream I've specified during order, so I had to wait even longer than regular rush hour wait to get a barista's attention for whipped cream. Yes, #FirstWorldProblems. But I went to Starbucks to kind of treat myself for a pretty sucky morning. So... what the heck. Ya know?",,1,
26,Lauren R.,"Manhattan, NY",210,121,204,3.0,11/11/2016,"I come to this Starbucks often to do work and it definitely has its positive and negative qualities. The one great thing about this location is the size. It's huge and there's tons of seating inside. There's only one row of seating when you walk in to the right of the entrance that has outlets. Everything on the left side has no outlets so this can sometimes be a problem. I also find that when I sit on the row of outlets, the speakers are right there and are super loud and distracting. I wish Starbucks wouldn't blast their music so loud and be aware that people are actually trying to do work. I can hear the music sometimes over my own music playing from my headphones. The other thing about this Starbucks is that the drinks take a pretty long time to make, especially when it's crowded which it normally is. There's also been times where I've waited for over 10 minutes and they've forgotten my drinks. The baristas are either friendly or they're not. When the drink eventually does come though there's no complaints there - always hot and made just how I asked. Overall it's Starbucks, so this is what I would expect. At least you can usually find a seat and get a little work done.",,1,

Updated review","This is one of my favorite Starbucks locations in the city.  Even when it's packed, it never seems crowded because the seating area is large, with ample space between the tables. Plus; there is almost always an outlet open. I go here often because I work across the street, and I've never been disappointed with service. My orders are correctly made, and the associates are always friendly.  The only downside is the bathroom, which has been closed on several occasions.  It's not always the cleanest when it is open, but let's be real--it's an NYC public bathroom. FOOD/DRINK - Starbucks...need I rate it? You either like it or you don't.SERVICE - 5/5ATMOSPHERE - 4/55 stars for the large space and dependable wi-fi. 3 stars for the frequent bathroom closures, and the fact that the floor generally looks unswept.",,,
28,J I.,"Hilton Head Island, SC",1,34,6,1.0,7/29/2017,Not a good experience.  Waited in line to get cake pops for kids.  They had all flavors on display but didn't have the ones ordered.  It took five plus minutes to even find this out.  She forgot our other item and when I asked about she gave me a stare down as if her mistake was my fault.  If you want drama and stare downs with your coffee come to this location.,,,
29,Danielle M.,"Hicksville, NY",170,9,10,4.0,6/26/2015,This is the Starbucks right across my my job so I am here literally 5 days a week.  It is usually very busy during peak morning hours when I come but the drinks are usually made quickly.The staff is for the most part friendly but when they are very busy you can feel kind of rushed and unimportant.One stand out of this location is the Manager Jarvis.  He is always in command of his team and jumps in whenever it gets hectic to help out.  He is always friendly with customers and thanks each person he deals with.  As long as I work in NYC I will be coming to this Starbucks!!,3,2,1
30,Victoria W.,"New York, NY",0,22,2,5.0,2/1/2018,"I like this location a lot. The staff is friendly and I like the music they play here. It's a large location with plenty of seating.

31,Rebecca K.,"Oakton, VA",0,23,0,3.0,7/21/2016,"Since it is on Park Ave, a lot of people come here. So the line can get sometimes really long. But otherwise, service is pretty quick and there's a lot if baristas.  There are plenty of space to sit and do your work. But- The AC is too strong for me so I'd recommend bringing a cardigan or something.  The music is too loud for studying.",1,,
32,Clint H.,"Brooklyn, NY",338,465,45,5.0,4/30/2015,"Let me preface this by saying the following: i'm not a coffee person. I never drink coffee. I don't even like going into Starbucks and I never buy anything from any of these places. This is important, because i want you to know just how much i DISLIKE even entering these places. One of my gigs has an office not too far from this particular starbucks, and sometimes I have to go by here and grab coffee for our clients. sometimes it's a cup or two...sometimes it's a LOT of coffee. In every case, I have literally no idea what these people order because, like i said, i'm not a coffee person. I usually show up with a list and just hand it to the baristas there. I'm there so much that they're just like ""oh you're back huh? cool."" and they just start typing in my order and marking it off with people's names so i'm not confused. they realize that i'm not a coffee or a starbucks person and they make it very easy for me to interact with them and get the right thing. I've met a lot of the people who work here and they're all really nice. People walk in all the time and the barista will just tell them their order before they even speak. it's pretty cool. in fact, one particular flustered day for me, the manager was helping me with my order and noticed my frustration, and asked what i normally get from starbucks. i told him im not a coffee guy so i never buy anything from there. he asked if i like tea. i said, yea sometimes. so he made me a fruity ice tea thing and gave it to me for free, just to try. pretty nice guy who you can tell when you talk to him cares about literally everyone single person who comes into his establishment. This place is just a good establishment and it's just run exceptionally well. well done.",3,,3

The milk and sugar bar literally look like people just came by and opened the sugar and milk and poured them all over. Nobody cleans anything up. There is trash and mill spilled all over the ground. I just went up to the barista and asked for them to refill the half and half, to which he said nothing and just looked down. Then another girl hands me a cup full of half and half.....while I'm handing her the milk jug to be refilled. Wouldn't it be easier to refill the jug rather than keep passing out cups full of milk?

The place is nice and warm unlike most other Starbucks I've been to in Manhattan. Always get a seat, even when crowded. On the not so up side: They always run out of teas, every week. Order more than you've been, you clearly don't order enough. Also, while I do feel bad for them, there are often at least one or two homeless people in the place. It wouldn't be an issue but for the odor and the fact that they are often clearly ill with cold or flu. I just change seats as necessary. I gave 4 stars because the pros outweigh the cons for me.",1,,

Baristas are normally quick and service is good. Very crowded at times and not a single seat can be found especially during prime time morning and late afternoon hours.But bathroom here sucks big time! For a place this size only one toilet is ridiculous. And why does it always smell like piss? Can someone please be assigned to clean and disinfect once in a while? Kind of ruins your appetite to go sit back down and enjoy your coffee.If you can avoid the bathroom this is a decent location to chill with a cup of joe.,,,

Don't know if they just get trained well or if they're naturally like that, but that was my experience so far. But to find TWO rude staff members in one store is just sheer bad luck. After I spent about 3hours here, spending a good amount of money and getting my last coffee for the day, I didn't expect to be treated rudely AGAIN, since ""the rude one"" was mopping the floor, but hey, what do you know, not only did this chic try to tell me my Grande drink is indeed a venti, no, she made rude comments and snapped at me when I was trying to make her life easier by telling her to just add milk, instead of making a whole new drink. she snapped at me!!!! Smh so by this time I've had enough and asked her, if it was really so hard to be nice, smile or at least bring up the minimum amount of politeness required for a job in the hospitality industry. It won't bother me if you smile or not but at least be polite. It's called simple customer service!!! But no, ""that might just be YOUR perception"", was all she said. Mind you, this was after this chic messed up my order  AND snapped at me..lol. customer service is definitely not a priority at this place!!! Both rude employees messed up my order during the course of the day and not once said ""my bad "" or anything, just continued to be their obnoxiously rude selves! Those two should not be dealing with customers!!!  They should be mopping floors and restock fridges until they learn how to treat a paying customer. The only reason it gets a star at all, is because I like the size of the store. Oh, did I mention, that the music is so loud, that people are yelling at each other across the table, right next to me. Lol..it's quite funny actually!  Club Starbucks!",,,

There is always a line!It's now a long running joke with my best friend (I call him during my coffee breaks at work). Whenever I tell him I am grabbing coffee, he immediately asks, ""How many people are waiting to order? How many people are waiting for their coffee?"" Dead serious, there will always be 16 people in line to order and 1 person waiting for coffee. The ratio is unbelievable. Ever since Starbucks changed their rules regarding steaming fresh milk for each drink, this Starbucks has become my worst enemy. There is no longer such a thing as popping in and grabbing a coffee. I only go to this Starbucks during my lunch hour, when I intend to spend the entire hour on line. I have walked out a number of times because I don't have the luxury of waiting 45 minutes for a latte. I have also started drinking Dunkin' Donuts lattes.

The amount of seating for a starbucks was unusual but im not complaining we had a table in seconds and more than enough space.
