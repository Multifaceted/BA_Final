0,Emily M.,"Manhattan, NY",107,17,9,5.0,6/17/2018,"I have been going here since Fred opened four years ago. I can not go anywhere else. Not only does he do the best hair styling, he treats everyone like they MATTER. After 35 years I finally had to dye my hair to hide the grey, and he didn't disappoint. Fred does my cuts, blow-outs, Smoothing treatments (Cezanne), and now my color. He sends me out with make-up redone, hair on point, and I never even give him direction. I just tell him to DO IT! Love Fred",,,
1,Morgan F.,"New York, NY",0,1,1,5.0,5/2/2018,"Highly, highly recommend. Beyond the exceptional experience, have never had more healthy or complimented hair. (And it was over a month ago)Fred was professional, knowledgeable and extremely talented - knows what he's doing and everyone's wondering where I got my hair done. Fred!",1,,
2,Sally K.,"New York, NY",0,7,1,5.0,8/10/2018,"HOLY COW, FRED CHANGED MY HAIR AND MY LIFE !!! I probably sound a little too excited to be writing a review but I can't tell you how many compliments I've received since going to Fred. He seriously knows hair to another dimension, and I've been getting posting so many selfies since bc im obsessed",1,,
3,Kate W.,"New York, NY",1,33,13,2.0,11/18/2017,"I found Fred on Gilt and didn't chose a stylist in advance when booking but ended up getting Fred himself for no extra cost (now I know there are only a couple people total and I think the female stylist would've been better anyway)--initially I thought I'd lucked out.First off, they were 1/2 hour late seeing me. I wasn't in a rush and was ok with it but I felt like I should note that in case it's an ongoing issue? The worst part of the whole experience was actually before we even started: Fred basically gasped and went on and on so loudly (i.e. Everyone stopped to listen) to tell me how horrible my current hair color was. I knew it wasn't great and I said so but it was just pretty embarrassing and not tactful.He also went on and on throughout the appointment about how the building construction around the salon was negatively effecting their business and I heard him telling the same complaints to the previous clients. I can't imagine how many times his employees have had to listen to it :(My haircut wasn't bad at all. The highlights were ok and definitely an improvement from what I came in with.  I had two big outlier blond strands, however, that looked so tacky. I got up the nerve to call them after I left about it and they saw me again to try to fix it for free which is nice but it wasn't fixed--still looks bad.The female stylist seemed great from what I could see/hear....I didn't want to write this review for a while....it's a small business and maybe my experience was unique--but I rely on reviews when choosing new services/businesses and I think I owe it to other Yelpers to give my honest experience.",5,,
4,Andrea A.,"Manhattan, NY",4,3,0,2.0,11/28/2017,Haven't even gotten to the place for my haircut and I'm already disappointed. I been trying to schedule an appointment and no one answers the phone or responds to the emails is a really bad start I wish I could get my money back from Groupon.,1,,
5,Kim H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,10,2,5.0,1/17/2018,"I just had a wonderful experience at FRED, with Fred.  This is absolutely the best cut/color I have had in a very long time. He gets curl, he gets face shape, he has an intuitive sense about what you need and what you want.  When I came home my husband said this is the best cut I've ever had.  Plus Fred is such a lovely guy. This is for sure my new spot. Thank you Fred! I couldn't be happier.",1,,
6,Nadia J.,"Trumbull, CT",103,7,0,5.0,5/10/2017,"Jenna is fantastic. This is the second time I've gone to her for balayage, and its always stunning and exactly what I asked for! She's the only one I'll go to moving forward. It also helps that I've never had to wait for my appointment, and the salon is super cute and clean. I've been recommending Fred to all of my friends!",1,,
7,Amalia V.,"Queens, NY",6,7,2,5.0,3/29/2017,"I had a much needed hair appointment today with the darling Jenna, and it was fantastic!!! She was super attentive, friendly, and really listened to what I wanted. I love my new style, and feel like a million bucks. I couldn't recommend this salon more, and look forward to coming back in the future. Thanks, Jenna!",1,,
8,Anastasia D.,"Brooklyn, NY",61,14,3,5.0,5/22/2017,"Was looking for a new salon and came to FRED on a recommendation. Fred himself styled my hair and gave me a cut that was fresh, perfectly layered and added volume. I am incredibly happy with my look!!! He has magic hands and an amazing eye that is keen to figuring out what YOU need not what the latest magazine suggests. Wonderful hospitality and attention, sleek salon as well. Found my new spot!",,,
9,Patrick M.,"Queens, NY",0,3,2,5.0,3/19/2017,"Went here for the first time yesterday and was super happy with how my hair turned out. Jenna hooked me up with a hipster cut so I no longer have ""dad"" hair. Fred, Jenna, and Joel (I believe he is the receptionist) were all very friendly and the atmosphere was inviting and comfortable. I would highly recommend coming here if you can afford to pay a little extra for a nice cut!",,,
10,DM B.,"Downtown Halifax, Halifax, Canada",34,57,71,5.0,10/13/2014,"Brilliant service, thrilled with my new colour. Go to Fred for all your hair care / cut / style needs ! Everything from a blowout to a full hair and face makeover !",3,,
11,Susan K.,"Franklin, NJ",0,36,2,5.0,1/24/2018,"Went to FRED this past Saturday and had Fred for the haircut which I did not expect.  My wife was there for a haircut as well.  It was towards the end of the day so it was just us.  It was such an amazing experience.  Fred offers you a beverage and jumps right in with discussions about your hair.  He has a great sense of humor and says what needs to be said in a way that is respectful and not offensive.  Let me be clear, I am not someone who frequents high-end salons, not even close.  I wanted to try something like this but was nervous I would feel uncomfortable and made to feel like I didn't belong.  Fred made it the exact opposite.  I was so comfortable I was actually sad when my haircut was finished.  I wanted to stay, finish my tea, and keep having the great conversation.  As for my haircut, Fred listened to my needs and gave me a cut that made me feel good about trying something a little new but that wasn't so different I would freak out.  It is very easy to style at home and I plan to not only listen to his recommendation to let my one side grow out but to return to him for the next cut.  I have had several compliments on my hair.  Usually people don't notice when I get my hair cut unless it is accidentally too short.  This time I am getting genuine compliments.  Fred has a very natural ability to read you, your lifestyle, and your hair.  Whoever is lucky enough to get a haircut by him benefits from that greatly!  Thanks Fred, not just for a beautiful haircut but a wonderful experience too.",,,
12,Helen F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,15,0,1.0,3/2/2016,"Purchased a GILT for the balayage on 2/9/16. I've been trying to schedule an appointment since 2/10/16. Today is 3/2/16. I've called multiple times, and every single time the call goes straight to voicemail. I've emailed numerous times as well, and eventually got in touch with GILT to request assistance. After GILT contacted the salon, FRED emailed me about setting up an appointment. I replied the same day, but then they stopped responding AGAIN. I've contacted GILT to request a refund already. Bottom line, don't waste your time with this place. I've never had such bad customer service. Thankfully I didn't pay the full price for their service.",17,3,1
13,Alexandra K.,"CA, CA",178,5,1,5.0,3/3/2015,"I have been in a desperate need of a good haircut for a while now and with so many options in NY, it has been so difficult trying to find a studio/stylist that you trust and love. Well, Fred's studio just opened up around the corner from where I work and I couldn't be happier. My boyfriend when there after 10 years of cutting his own hair and looked hot, so I had to go for myself! Here's a breakdown of the place and people that might be helpful if you're reading this review:Getting an Apt-I called on a Friday and got an apt with Trent the following day right after work. Easy, quick, no hassle. Nice to know it isn't too difficult to get a last min apt... for now.The Studio-Clean, contemporary, very sleek.Arriving to the Studio-Warm and professional staff. Trent was waiting for me and immediately greeted me. Asked if he could hang my coat, offered me something to drink. Point being, he just made me feel comfortable.Consultation-I was very open to the style as long as he kept it long. Having a haircut almost being a year prior and asking the same thing, I received a cut much shorter than I wanted so this was important to me. He was very vocal about what he wanted to do and made me know that he understood what I was looking for, just for my own piece of mind.Shampoo-What can I say, I love this part of getting my haircut!Cutting/Blow Drying-Trent took his time, showed that he cared. I wish the chairs lifted so that he didn't have to bend down so far almost to his knees to trim my hair, but he didn't seem to mind. He is also super friendly. We talked, joked, laughed, cried. Well, maybe not cried, but I did have a great time with him. Then when he blew out my hair, he got the silky-smooth look that made me feel super glamorous. Sexy and full, just the way I like it. After, he came back in to give it more texture and just made it look fabulous. After a quick pic for his book, I left there feeling awesome.So, after a long story like this one, don't hesitate making an apt there. You won't regret it. Thanks for reading and happy cutting!",6,,
14,John M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,7/6/2015,I found FRED on GUILT soon after they opened and it has been a great experience. Jenna is AMAZING!!!  She routinely out does herself... Every cut has been even better than the last.  She is of the coolest people I have come to know and I'd recommend her to anyone.  Do yourself a favor & check out FRED. Don't forget to ask for Jenna.,2,,2
15,Margaret Z.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,5.0,5/12/2017,"I went for a haircut and style with Jenna. She is super nice and helpful, paid attention to details, very nice and sweet, cut my hair exactly as I wanted, styled it nicely. I am very happy with the outcome and I highly recommend her.",1,,
16,A. A.,"Toms River, NJ",15,72,21,5.0,2/15/2015,"Went here this Saturday at noon and I'm very happy about my beautiful haircut by Mariell Johnson. I had asked for three inches off the bottom with new long layers and she delivered exactly what I asked. I liked that she asked before proceeding with specific things such as if I'm particular about layers in the front etc. Then she gave me a great blowout with curls. They use an Australian brand of hair products called Kevin Murphy that makes your hair smell divine.My boyfriend was also with me and he needed a haircut too, and even though he didn't have an appointment, Trent was able to fit him in and trimmed up his hair. Both Trent and Mariell were two of the nicest people and passionate about hair. I saw the owner in the salon as well giving another girl a blowout which looked as though it was coming out really well. Overall yes I would definitely recommend this place for a haircut.",4,,
17,Angelica T.,"Manhattan, NY",298,2,2,5.0,4/28/2016,"I met Fred at an after party for an event Summer 2015. He'd mentioned that he owned a salon downtown which was so very convenient because I just so happened to really need my roots colored. I booked my appointment, came in and was greeted with a smile, a glass of water and a fashion mag of my choosing. We chatted for a bit about what I wanted to get done and what COULD be done that day. Not only did I want to get my roots done (I'm a natural brunette) but also to go a bit blonder. He explained to me step by step how he intended on getting my color to where I wanted it to be. He did not recommend going exactly the color that I wanted (ash blonde) within the first visit as that would damage my hair, which I totally agreed with! He suggested we gradually go lighter and lighter within 2-3 visits. Sure enough, after the 3rd visit we were EXACTLY where I wanted to be! The base color and highlights of my hair are absolutely GORGEOUS!!! I'm more than thrilled with my results. So much so that I have recommended Fred to all of my friends, being that he's incredibly talented. I even entrusted him to cut my hair, which is a miracle because I hate getting my hair cut. Fred is not only an amazing hair stylist and colorist, but he's also an educator that teaches you about proper hair care, trying out different hair colors (and if that color is right for you, etc.). All in all, I couldn't be happier with my hair and I'm basically swearing off all other salons...that is all :)",3,,
18,Ben H.,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",3,1,1,5.0,1/31/2015,"Fred's is such a wonderful personal experience. Whether I know exactly what I want or have no idea, I come out with an awesome cut that grows out really nicely.",3,,1
19,Sarah W.,"West Hollywood, CA",9,5,0,5.0,4/22/2015,"I have been living in the Lower East Side now six years, I use to go to Tommy Guns where I met the best of the best Stefani! She moved to Fred and thank goodness we didn't lose her from the area.Stefani truly has a passion for hair, she is able to cut fine long hair and create fullness and body. An expert in color she was able to fix a disaster from another stylist to perfection and took her time until I was completely happy. I have to say Fred is lucky to have her because she is brilliant . I am happy I found her after Tommy Guns closed ...",1,,

Updated review",Went back to get my hair cut and it's the best hair cut I've ever had. Ever.I have never gotten so many compliments ever. I wanted to go short but was afraid to do it because my hair is pretty curly. Fred gave me the perfect hair cut. I couldn't be happier.,1,,
21,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",72,19,0,5.0,9/14/2015,"Purchased two deals off Gilt: Balayage + Haircut/Blowout. I was able to combine both vouchers for a full hair makeover. The overall aesthetic is modern and chic. Excellent customer service is the DNA of this Salon! After doing my research I had requested Fred to do my hair. I came in with several pictures to help give direction as to how I wanted my hair and within seconds Fred understood. He tailored my desired looks to compliment my head shape and complexion. through talking to him I learned about his diverse background and many talents beyond hair. His knowledge of fashion, cosmetics, hair is impressive. Fred's passion for hair and excellent customer service does not go unnoticed.  Amazing color/cut! Warm/Talented staff! Highly recommend!",5,,
22,Didi R.,"Manhattan, NY",8,61,54,2.0,8/2/2015,"My experience was very similar to the other yelper with the 2 stars. Mediocre cut that didn't sit right with my thick hair. Maybe the stylist wasn't good with thick curly hair, but after struggling with my cut for 2 weeks, I went and got it fixed at another salon.",3,1,
23,Roxanne D.,"Orlando, FL",93,10,7,5.0,1/30/2015,When i was visiting New York I stopped by FRED to see Jenna Wu. Excellent service and an even more excellent cut. Visit her and you won't regret it :),5,,1
24,Loes V.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,4/10/2015,"I had my first haircut at Fred. yesterday, however not my first ""Stefani"" cut! I've been getting my hair done by Stefani ever since I moved to NY. She always knows exactly what I want and puts a smile on my face time after time. I must say, wherever she would work is where I will follow! About Fred. salon, it's nice, cozy and clean. All it was missing was a glass of wine to top off this Thursday evening hairstyling event.",3,,1
25,Gully F.,"New York, NY",256,24,3,5.0,11/22/2014,This place rules. I'm a 32 yo guy with good hair and usually get a pretty cheap cut at a barber. I had an awesome time here with Fred who is a great guy and an awesome hair master. Definitely recommend this place.,3,,2
26,Michelle N.,"Great Neck, NY",0,2,0,5.0,7/21/2016,"I wish I could give Fred. more stars because 5 is just not enough. Fred gave me the best haircut of my life--from the skill, to the conversation, vibe of the salon, and overall experience. Unlike any other salon I've been to, Fred takes the time to talk vision, and he truly listens and cares. I got a cut and balayage, and both came out better than every picture I showed him. Fred treats you as the beautiful individual you are, giving you a custom look that is perfectly fitted for you--he doesn't just follow trends or settle for something easy. He is truly the master! Once you go to Fred you will NEVER want to go anywhere else! I have never walked out of a salon with a bigger smile on my face. SO much love for Fred!!",,,
27,Ashley B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,5,5.0,10/23/2014,"I love this place!!I only get my haircut about once or twice a year.. usually it would be a bob or a pixie and then I let it grow out. I went to this place hoping to get a edgy pixie look.. most of the other barbers left me with a cute pixie, but not something that looked like I could kick ass. The staff was very friendly, and wanted me to leave happy. And I defiantly am! Come here to get any edgy new look.. they definitely can handle it! Love it, looks like I might be getting my hair cut more than once a year",3,,
28,Jamie H.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,5/11/2015,"I can be a bit indifferent about where I get my hair cut, since I usually assume it's all the same. Then once in a while you go somewhere that's a different level in terms of both customer service and outcome. That's how I felt about Fred. I was really, really, really impressed.",3,,
29,Kara L.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,1/15/2015,"This place is amazing. Fred is a total expert and gave me a great cut. The customer service is top notch and I love how accessible and friendly it is (unlike other salons I have been to with similar top service). Also, the prices are very reasonable! The ambiance is great and everything is well thought out and done well - even the small details like the music playing artists from Nova Scotia (where Fred is from). Fred is a wonderful person with an interesting story (an added bonus on the perfect haircut!) I will definitely go back and will recommend to all of my friends!",4,,1
30,Robert M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,5.0,1/29/2015,"Jenna was great! Really enjoying my new hair cut. Although, one of her nails was chipped. Which was a little off putting to her otherwise perfect appearance. I will let it slide due to the quality of the haircut. But when you are paying $100.00 for a hair cut.... Get it totally together girl. Otherwise I would have proposed on the spot.",2,5,
31,Mandee Y.,"New York, NY",0,37,0,2.0,1/29/2015,Very mediocre cut that doesn't sit right with my thick hair. The girls working were a bit unprofessional with their very personal and negative conversations. Salon itself is very pretty and clean.,2,1,
32,Sarah C.,"Astoria, NY",0,4,0,5.0,12/14/2014,"Fred is a calm, immaculate  salon. I appreciated the laid back atmosphere. Jenna, who cut my hair, was lovely. She gave me probably the best haircut I have ever had, and I have been to many high-end salons. I am extremely happy, and will definitely be back.",2,,1
33,Sonam D.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,1,0,5.0,2/11/2015,LOVED how my hair turned out!!! Trent is amazing and so patient and everyone there was super nice! Definitely I'm coming back again.,1,,
