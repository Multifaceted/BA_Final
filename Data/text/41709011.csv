From the calamari and scallops appetizers to the homemade pastas, fresh fish or perfect cuts of meats for the mains. You'll leave satisfied. And don't forget the atmosphere - fun and lively on weekends to quite and romantic vibes on weeknights.",1,,1

We had a very exclusive client event in Brooklyn and searched for a location that reflected the history, flavors and warmth of Brooklyn and we found it at Sociale with Francesco and his team. The food was wonderful, the service spectacular and the flexibility to accommodate everything we needed was all wrapped up in one great evening. I look forward to coming back again.",2,,2
2,H. J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,9/3/2018,"Lasagna alla bolognese was prepared wWITHOUT meat sauce and the portion was the size of an appetizer. The Ravioli ricotta spinach was also a small portion size. In addition, both items were delivered luke warm and WITHOUT utensils and napkins. This was a delivery order to a hotel that did not have room service.  All of this for $45!!!!  What s rip-off!!!!!",,,
3,Annie F.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,8/20/2018,"One of my very favorite neighborhood restaurants in Brooklyn. The Italian owner, who is often there, greets you with warmth and humor. The food is always flavorful but not overdone - like someone cooking for you at their home but a step up. I usually focus on the starters, pastas, and gorgeous salads. It is the very definition of a neighborhood joint - the place you return to again and again for brunch or dinner.",,,1
4,Jonathan C.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",1,10,0,5.0,4/11/2018,"Single word review: reliable.The staff was attentive, friendly, and helpful. We felt very welcome from beginning to end.The decor was subtle and enjoyable. The atmosphere was pleasant. It was recommended as a romantic setting, and was a very nice place to bring my date. It is warm and versatile enough for any occasion, in keeping, perhaps, with its name.The food was very enjoyable. It is well balanced, skewered more towards the familiar. The selection included enough staple Italian dishes to scratch that craving itch, while offering enough creative dishes to allow for one to feel slightly adventurous without going too far out of one's comfort zone.The portions were perfect, and even the main dishes a little larger than I anticipated, especially considering the very small bread portions offered. (Which is not a bad thing! It's too easy to fill up in the heavy stuff).The price was fair, even a little low, considering the food and experience. No complaints. I personally agree with the trend that restaurants raise prices and do away with tipping, but that's a criticism aimed towards the US industry in general.I recommend this restaurant, especially for when you want something familiar with a touch of special.",1,,2
5,Sapphire B.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,20,17,5.0,3/28/2018,"This place is great. The food is good and the environment is really enjoyable. It's definitely a bit on the fancier side on the restaurant scale but still very comfortable and humble. The aesthetic is cute and rustic. A kind of old wine cellar that was remodeled but left half done feel. It is loud and lively In there and very close together so it's definitely not bouncy small children or stroller friendly, so leave them at home and have some wine & ravioli. Also a plus, they have Henny! (But I don't drink, this place was still enjoyable to me)",1,,2
6,Besa A.,"Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, NY",0,9,3,2.0,8/8/2018,"This is my second time here, I thought I'll give them another chance but really the food is not so good. Great food presentation, but empty inside and no taste..I dont think we will come back.",,,
7,Renee H.,"Santa Clara, CA",0,6,0,1.0,7/7/2018,"Stopped in for a beer after walking the bridge and the ""greeter"" was so rude. There were 5 of us, we weren't going to stay long, just take a break and have a beer and tip well. He seats us in the sun on the patio. Mind you, there's about 4 tables of people inside and one outside. 3 guys standing around doing nothing. I asked if we could have a spot in the shade or sit inside. He says no, inside is for brunch. It's 2:00. I said so this spot is our only option? Yes. Seriously? We left. And then the 3 of them huddled and proceed to talk smack and laugh. I should have know, when we walked up the guy on the patio already had a shit look on his face. Was not welcoming from the get go. Not from around here, but if I were I wouldn't go back.",1,,
8,Meredith S.,"New York, NY",61,100,114,2.0,1/12/2018,"This place should get between two and three stars. I have been here twice. The first time I ordered spaghetti carbonara and it was very bland. I came back because the ambiance is really cute. Last night, I had a riosotto where I added a lot of pepper and Parmesan cheese. The dish was petty good. This is such a cozy restaurant and I want to love it. The problem is that the food is mostly average, the price points are too high, and the service is not the best. I arrived and was waiting for my friend and had to ask for water and a menu. I would have liked them to make me feel more welcome while I waited for my friend. They didn't even ask if I wanted to order an appetizer and I was really starving! By not seizing that opportunity they potentially lost a sale.",1,,
9,Michael F.,"New York, NY",22,5,2,5.0,5/26/2018,"The bad reviews were clearly from people who went to another restaurant. We had fantastic service, amazing food. Probably the best salads we've had in years.",1,,1
10,Teddy C.,"Seaford, NY",64,7,0,5.0,3/26/2018,"In the last two months my wife and I have come back twice with 2 different groups and have to say each time the service and food has been on point and both times my parties loved everything. I was a little concerned the last time since we were a party of 6 and there really is not much bar space to have a cocktail but the owner Francesco and his team are welcoming and accommodating and made us feel comfortable. If you're looking for quality food vs quantity then this is the place to visit and I have eaten in some of NY best restaurants, Del Posto, LiLia, Marea, L'Artusi, Scalini Fedeli etc...  My wife and I enjoy Sociale food and warm atmosphere as much as any place we've been to.  The homemade pastas and octopus are a must... but from appetizers to desert we have not been disappointed with any of our choicesWe travel from LI which takes us between 1-1.5 hours, so when it comes to good quality food this place is worth the trip and already looking forward to my next visit.",2,,2
11,jennifer l.,"Melville, NY",0,4,1,5.0,8/26/2017,"Love their food, love their vibe and their staff! Short rib appetizer is amazing!!!

Updated review","I'm ready to update my review from 4 to 5 stars. I've been back to Sociale several times since my initial review, and the consistent dining experience has made it a top 3 in Brooklyn Heights.The service is attentive, kind, and generally fantastic.  And the food, drinks, and atmosphere at Sociale are so deliberate and thoughtful, it's hard not to walk away from the meal feeling truly satisfied.PS - the truffle ravioli is my absolute favorite dish!",3,,3
14,S. W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,104,0,5.0,7/26/2018,"I came here on a group organized outing, and I was so pleased with everything. The service excellent, atmosphere, warm friendly, nice decor . The food was absolutely delicious and they went out of their way to accommodate all of our requests. If I lived nearby this would become a regular restaurant for me. Keep up the great work!",,,1
15,David S.,"New York, NY",260,23,6,5.0,7/26/2017,"Since moving to Brooklyn Heights in November of 2016, I've eaten at Sociale every Friday night for as long as I can remember.What keeps me coming back is not just their great food (my favorites are their chicken dish and flourless chocolate cake dessert), but also their great service. This place has a very warm atmosphere, and Francesco, Ismael, Pablo, Rodrigo, and their entire crew make you feel like you're part of their family. There's no question why this place is not only a favorite to Brooklyn Heights locals, but also to celebrities and executives - just check their Instagram (instagram.com/sociale_br…).Sociale gets an emphatic 5 stars from me and I encourage everyone to try this Brooklyn gem.",2,,1
16,Melissa G.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,1.0,7/13/2018,"Went here for dinner with three of my girlfriends, one of which has a serious peanut allergy. She orders the scallops, specifically says to the server ""I have a severe peanut allergy, please make sure there are no nuts"". Server nods. We receive our food (30 minutes later at that). My friend takes a bite of the scallops and realizes ""oh my god, there are pistachios on this plate"". We tell the server, he's apologetic however quite adamant that my friend never said she had an allergy. This allergy is potentially fatal keep in mind, so yes, she most certainly called it out when ordering - as she's done for the last 20+ years. We're all shaken up at this point as my friend is taking deep breaths deciding if she wants to leave. Some of us take bites of our food, some of us barely enjoy our entrees. I decide to get up and notify the manager as calmly as possible. He apologizes and tells me he'll comp our drinks. When I explained to him the danger in which he put my friend, he still just said ""drinks are on the house"". I immediately responded ""no, this whole experience including the food should be on the house"". He flips a switch and gets nasty with me, then yells ""FINE, BYE"". We leave.Moral of the story, this restaurant is full of inexperienced servers who take ZERO responsibility for their actions. I'm sure they still believe she didn't say anything. If that's the case, it'll happen again and I just hope no one gets hurt in the process. I also hope this manager feels badly about the situation now that he's had time to reflect, although I highly doubt it.Sidenote: my friend is fine and did not have to go to the hospital this time thankfully.",1,,
17,Shannon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",213,310,69,4.0,7/10/2016,"My mom and I stopped into Sociale on a sunny afternoon after being pulled in by the lovely outdoor seating situation. I'm usually hesitant to order burrata at a restaurant I don't know too much about, but decided to just go for it. I'm glad I did. The blueberries and pancetta complimented the creamy savory cheese wonderfully. My mom ordered the eggs Benedict and enjoyed them very much as well (the oven roasted potatoes they come with are addictive!)Overall, Sociale is the perfect summer spot for a refreshing outdoor meal. I'll be back!",9,5,8
18,Cliff K.,"Brooklyn, NY",21,24,0,2.0,6/6/2017,"Yuck. While the atmosphere is cosy and the open windows out front make for a pleasant summer evening, the food here is clearly an afterthought. We had a couple of the appetizers--the calamari and the burrata, which were fine. Then I had the lasagna bolognese, which was terrible. The red sauce tasted like Prego, and the bechamel was more like mayo. The best thing here is the bread appetizer with the tomato compote. From there, it's straight down hill. The service is laughably bad--I think we spent a solid five minutes trying to wave down our waiter with the place half empty. You would have thought he would have come over himself, given that he'd just seated the final four people at our table of six. Every time I try a place in Brooklyn Heights, I keep thinking: Maybe this will finally be one decent restaurant in this neighborhood. And every time I'm wrong. It's baffling.",2,2,
19,Rebecca L.,"New York, NY",192,338,98,3.0,5/7/2017,"Sociale is a trendy Italian spot, a nice atmosphere for date night or meal with friends. The service is friendly and attentive, however the food falls short of expectations and the price. I ordered the Agnolotti pasta. The presentation was impressive and the homemade pasta texture was great. However, the flavor was lacking. The dish was completely bland, with watery and flavorless sauce. Very disappointing $20 plate of pasta. Food took forever to come out which was surprising since there were only 4 tables. The server apologized. Overall, Sociale was a bit expensive and disappointing.",1,2,1
20,Tony E.,"Austin, TX",0,51,4,5.0,1/1/2018,My family and I had a wonderful meal at this restaurant. The food was fresh and delicious the atmosphere was very cozy. The service was great and the prices just about right,,,1
21,Fiona C.,"New York, NY",35,413,22,4.0,5/1/2017,"Came here with great friends after a joyous occasion and although we had to sit outside when it was in the 50s because we had my dog, they were very accommodating with the hot water and whatever else to make us feel a little warmer. We had shared a few appetizers: the tomato bread which we could have done without, the braised short rib which had great flavor but was a bit chewy and yummy veggies, and veal meatballs which were on the dry side. We had lentil soup which warmed us up. I had the pumpkin ravioli which was nice. The striped bass was great with amazing crispy skin and the chicken was moist, flavorful with amazing crispy skin. We could have done without appetizers but the mains were great. If you're looking for a nice bottle of white wine, the Chardonnay was delicious.",1,,1
22,Mar R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,49,3,1.0,12/1/2017,This restaurant is pretty bad. Food was under seasoned. Prices are high and portions are small. They brought us two tiny mini stale rolls of bread and charged us for them. I ordered a pasta with seafood and it was so bland. The only thing that was good was the butter that came with the bread had tomato sauce that was delicious in it.,,,
23,Katie K.,"Santa Barbara, CA",0,31,1,3.0,4/20/2018,"Okay food and service. We had two pasta dishes that were fine, not great and the chicken which was pretty good. The dessert menu is good though and they have a decent wine list. The place is small and a little cramped but the decor is cute. I'm not mad I went but I probably won't go back.",1,,
24,Heather P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0,1.0,5/13/2018,"Food is slipping. Does lasagna need that white, cheese sauce? Do you have to charge $20 for spaghetti and $1 per roll when my children didn't want goo-ed lasagna. Horrible. And too expensive.",,,
25,Emily C.,"New York, NY",180,63,528,4.0,5/31/2016,"As soon as I saw this restaurant, I knew I would enjoy my time. There were numerous candles lit along the walls and on the tables, giving it the most perfect dining ambiance. I ordered a Farfalle ai Frutti di Mare and the presentation was quite lovely though I do have to point out that it was slightly bland. I ended up having to add quite a bit of salt, which was actually fine by me as I was in love with the atmosphere. There could definitely have been a lot more flavor put into my dish. I also ordered a Tortino Al Cioccalato, a dessert with chocolate cake and salted caramel gelato. I loved the dessert, it was incredibly rich and well balanced. It was devoured in mere seconds. In general, don't expect to come here for a fulfilling meal as their portions are all relatively small.Without the beautiful atmosphere for the place, I would give it three stars as the food could definitely be improved but the vibes in this restaurant made up for the lack of flavor for me. If you're not too picky with food then do visit for the great atmosphere! The interior design is simple and lovely, perfectly romantic for a simple date and such.",2,,1
26,Yuri S.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,10,6,1.0,4/13/2018,Bad place. Food does not taste good. Long wait and rude host. Don't waste your money at this hole. Many better places near by.,1,,
27,Igor T.,"Manhattan, NY",88,22,0,3.0,9/1/2017,"Good food. Don't come hungry - portions are small. The service was nice and cordial. The atmosphere is a bit dry, even at night - bare walls and some basic two-top tables. The wine list is really good and they had my favorite Italian beer - Manabrea (it's pretty hard to find). Overpriced.",1,2,
28,Michael A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,21,0,2.0,8/21/2017,"We went for a Sunday Brunch. The food was good as there was a decent selection of breakfast and lunch dishes. Also, the wine list looks like there is something for everyone. The downside was the service and the drinks. As for the drinks, steer clear of the Bloody Mary's. For $13, one would expect made from scratch and good flavor but these tasted like a cheap mix. On top of it, I could not taste any vodka at all...and I had 2. Plus they are small. In terms of the service, one of the servers spilled coffee on my Dad. Although there was a sincere appology, there was no offer to clean his clothes and nothing was comped....something definitely should have been. Also, I shouldnt have to ask for the check twice. I will try dinner just to go through the wine list and maybe the evening service is better...we'll see.",1,2,
29,Michael G.,"Manhattan, NY",92,85,8,4.0,9/17/2017,Good tasting food but don't come hungry.  Over priced somewhat.  Service nice but not knowledgable.,,,1
30,Erin M.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,188,49,5.0,5/26/2016,"I have passed this place so many times and have never had the opportunity to stop in. I finally did last night and I was satisfied with my experience. The dishes are a bit pricey and the portions are somewhat small but that's to be expected in this area. At least both dishes we had were delicious so I can forgive the portion size for the price. I had the Burrata salad (not really knowing what to expect so next time I would probably order more food) and a friend had the skirt steak special. Both were very delicious. The bread with olive oil and butter was a lovely addition as well. We had friendly waitstaff and since it was the first beautiful day this season so far it was really nice to sit outside. I would have probably given 4 stars but I bumped it to 5 after reading the owner/manager's comments on everyone's ridiculous reviews! Fantastic! As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry I applaud you. Everyone else, get a grip. This is a solid joint. Also, there were kids a plenty when I was there and all seemed right with the world.",1,,1
31,Paul B.,"Key West, FL",5,19,55,5.0,7/24/2017,After a long hot walk across Brooklyn bridge we found this place by accident. Looked quite busy and we were desperate for a cold drink. Staff very pleasant and food very good. We ordered a pollo panini (chicken and pesto) and the pulled pork panini. Both were very good and extremely tasty and came with a delicious green salad side dish. Would definitely recommended and if in the area again wouldn't hesitate to go back.,1,,1
32,Alissa B.,"New York, NY",5,5,3,4.0,7/22/2017,Cute atmosphere and pretty good food. Outdoor seating does not have extra lighting or heat lamps - can get chilly at night.,1,,1
33,Kiai K.,"San Francisco, CA",258,189,201,1.0,7/17/2016,"I wanted to give this place 5 stars just because they have a proper carbonara on the menu (without cream, just egg yolk, pepper, pork, and Parmesan). But they gave me a hard time about my service dog. When I was there before without my dog, it was okay. The food was good but the service subpar. The staff made me feel rushed. When I had my dog with me (a PTSD service dog trained to help me navigate through busy stores and not get stuck), they wouldn't serve me until I threatened to take them to court. We left before sitting down. Who wants to be in that environment?",8,7,
34,Steph G.,"Syracuse, NY",71,440,6,4.0,12/11/2016,"A solid option if wandering henry street in search of italian... quality of the eats are right up there with bevacco and noodle pudding. priced a tad higher than warranted, but- hey- it's nyc and anything goes. beautifully designed space with really attentive waitstaff. definitely a more sophisticated venue geared for an older crowd (aka leave baby at home with babysitter). ordered the white IPA to start, and then we shared a bunch of apps: brussel sprout/spinach app, fried mozzarella, and the meatball. meatball was definitely my favorite. for the main meal, i opted for the sea bass which came with roasted veggies on pureed cauliflower- would definitely order this again. if you come with a big appetite and didn't partially fill up on the bread, this dish may not be enough food. everyone else at the table ordered their pick of pasta with the red sauce (note: the papardelle is seemingly whole wheat??) would return if craving italian and wanted a change from bevacco/noodle pudding, or fine dining in a more sophisticated ambiance... beware small portions and hefty price tag",1,,2
35,Average J.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,43,1,1.0,7/4/2016,"Had a mostly solid brunch here. Food and ambience are fairly good, deserving 4 stars. The menu is maybe a bit obtuse (dishes are simpler than they're made out to be), or maybe it's that common dishes get uncommon names... Waitstaff are also good as long as you don't run afoul of one of their hidden rules. See other reviews for examples. After having a weirdly hostile interaction  with a staffer I'm inclined to believe those negative reviews.UPDATE:After the intensely hostile response of the manager (who wasn't even there and has no idea what my issue actually was), I've decided to raise my rating to-HAHAHAH kidding! I'm going down to one star. A rageful manager who thinks he's the only restaurant with challenges to face in New York creates a hateful atmosphere that no one should support. You're welcome! ;)",6,9,

Why would you make a customer leave the business to look at the menu?As I sat down, he placed the menu and asked me if I would like tap water or Perrier. I said we'll look at the menus and suggested he come back later. Dude asked again like I didn't say it in English. And then another guy came asking the same question. I don't usually dine in Brooklyn but I know a thing or two about etiquette. We ordered drinks and some food. The food was okay - I ordered pasta and could taste the sausage from the pan. No I did not order sausage with my pasta.",3,4,

I had the Gnocco Fritto and the Tonno Salad with a Negroni which, thankfully was built right - unlike most fly-by-night recipes I've come across recently.  (seriously Negroni's shouldn't be toyed with).  Staff was on their game.   We'll be back soon - dreaming of those raisons in honey.",1,,1
38,Kristin J.,"Washington, DC",199,2,0,3.0,4/9/2017,"Food was good, not great, and the service was great until it was terrible. I went out to lunch with my family of 4, and shortly after being seated 4 more family members decided they wanted to join us. The staff was very accomadating and said they would allow our family to have the table next to us once it became available (the people were just finishing up). The table wasn't available yet when the rest showed up, so they decided to eat outside. We ordered and ate inside, and they did the same outside. The salads were great, the hanger steak and meatball parmesan were pretty good, and the branzino and salmon were bland with the accompanying brussell sprouts and spinach (respectively) overly oily and salty. Once we finished eating we paid and went outside to join the rest of our family, asked a waiter if we could take the empty table next to them, sat down, and ordered drinks. While waiting for our drinks the owner came over to us and told us we were really ruining his business by taking up tables where other customers could go. Ummmmm... We have eaten food and are currently waiting on drinks and some people were still eating their food, all of which makes us paying customers. Needless to say, after that, we finished our drinks, paid the check, and hightailed it out of there to another restaurant that may be a bit more friendly.",3,,

42,Lucy R.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,67,58,2.0,4/4/2015,"This review has nothing to do with the food since it was very good and filling. However, this review has anything & everything to do with the service and the unbelievable rudeness from the staff and owners. My boyfriend, his father and I went to Sociale for an early dinner with reservations on a Saturday. Literally, upon entering it was a 21 question game to find out who we were, why we were there and if we had a reservation. Once we sat down, the waiter for some reason assumed we knew everything about the menu and he was just a robot there to write the order down, showing no concern to want to actually take care of the table. Honestly seeming very annoyed to be working in general. After ordering we realized we forgot to order the calamari so I explained to him we still wanted it.. He then explains he doesn't know if we can get it because our food will all come out together... Hmm, I'm sorry I thought I was the customer.. and I told you what I wanted? It really is a joke of table service and management. If you want good food AND great service forget this place. Plus it's pricey for what you get and after being treated like I was at a McDonald's I didn't even want to be there nor give the guy a tip.",6,7,1

Updated review","We stopped by on Sunday afternoon, around 2:30 p.m. The restaurant was half empty. We asked for a table for four and pointed out we had a stroller. The manager said we would have to leave the stroller outside. We told him our daughter was sleeping in the stroller, but he insisted they had a strict no stroller policy. When we said we would go somewhere else he said all restaurants in Brooklyn Heights had that policy. Guess what? We went to a restaurant down the block and they had no issue with the stroller. I really hate when people lie to me! Update: the manager confirmed his rudeness by telling me I have a big ego and hatred issues. Apparently, he got offended because I said his restaurant was half empty. Guess who has the bigger ego, here :)  Sorry Francesco, you are very arrogant, and several other reviews support my bad impressions on you and your restaurant.",5,3,
44,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1142,623,2346,3.0,8/6/2013,"I wanna give this place 5 stars, but the portion sizes for the entrees are just too small. The appetizer portions seemed appropriate, but the entree sizes were only big enough to fill the stomach of a small child. Everything tasted spot on, but these guys need to increase the portion sizes ASAP or risk losing customers.As for appetizers, all the ones we tried were super tasty--the meatballs, the fried mozzarella, the short ribs, and the fried mixed fish. They were also portioned well, too. Unfortunately, every entree dish that followed was about the size of a silver dollar or so... and left us all still super hungry. Examples include the pork medallions, the risotto, and the agnolotti pasta dish. For dessert, we tried 3 different items--the banana ""pudding"" (really a cake), the chocolate lava cake, & the tiramisu. All of these were yummy and seemed portioned okay.Note that the wait staff is nice and super responsive, and the interior is trendy and inviting... but I'm still hungry.",5,6,1

Easily walkable from the bridge but allow yourself enough time to explore the surrounding blocks, full of great architecture. Sociale is warm-looking and cozy but not cramped.

The food is authentic, solid, and doesn't try to re-create the wheel. To all the people who are complaining about the service or the management, you are the reason why there aren't more good restaurants in this hood. No one wants to deal with pain in the butt impossible to please ninnys like you! I work in restaurants and would kill to have the management and staff from Sociale in my place. Get a clue.",17,5,11

Some sort of bread marinara thing for an app. That thing was awesome. The worst part was the cheesecake dessert with blueberries, and even that was tasty. There was a salad with spinach and brussel sprouts. Not my thing (girlfriend ordered it), but pretty good. And that assessment is coming from a guy that doesn't really greens.

Yes.. Very unfortunate; however, I ventured back to my local street and decided on the restaurant Sociale. I have walked by this establishment numerous times and it has always been crowded. I felt like I was going to be in  good hands.  As like before, it was very crowded and a bit noisy but service was good by directing us to a small table. The atmosphere was intimate with a romantic feel. The fried mozzarella was to die with a incredible tomato sauce. The ravioli with butter sauce was delightfully light and tasty. The only thing I recommend is serve hot bread because it was good.",8,,9
55,Danielle C.,"New York, NY",79,62,6,2.0,8/15/2015,"Funny, after reading the below post about the customer service and manager/management, I see that my friends and I weren't the only ones who felt that the manager isn't very accommodating or friendly, nor does he seem to care much what his customers think. My friends and I walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and stumbled upon this place and thought we'd give it a try. The restaurant was fairly quite but the menu looked good.  We chose a seating area in the back corner to be near the open air from outside.  Once we sat down, I placed my leg on the chair beside me to stretch out since I was in the corner seat.  The manager sent one of his employees over and asked that I remove my leg. I respectfully put my leg down.  After a few interactions, we started to feel that hospitality was far from warm and friendly. We ordered the french toast and the omelette with spinach and parmesan sauce. It took a while for the food to be served however once it was, we were all pleasantly surprised.  The food was quite good.Once we paid our bill and began to exit the restaurant, we noticed the manager standing outside with an employee.  There were a few people who walking out right before us, the manager said nothing to them, no thanks for coming, hope you enjoyed your meal, nothing.  The manger simply watched them walk out and starred at them from behind.  As my friends and I walked out, surprise - same thing, absolutely no acknowledgement however the employee kindly said ""have a nice day"".  My friends and I decided that though the food was good, there are too many restaurants in NYC with great food to have to deal with a place that has a schmuck manager running the place.  Note to manager who was working around 1pm on Sat. 8/15 - YOU'RE A SCHMUCK!  Learn how to treat your customers/diners!",5,11,1

Updated review","I have, yet again, enjoyed a very well prepared meal.  I am puzzled about those reviewers who criticize portions that are too small.  No one at my table (including the 6'1"" spouse of a friend), walked out groaning.  The pappardelle will induce anyone into a carb comma about half way through.  The meatballs are gigantic and the burrata aint no shrinking violet either.  Order carafe wine: it's excellent, unless you must have a bottle with a label.  Our server couldn't have been nicer.  My one complaint was the place gets super noisy once all the tables are taken, but it does lend to the festive atmosphere.",3,,4

58,Nadia L.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,4/16/2017,"I work at a fine-dining Italian restaurant and due to my experience in food service I have never been a fan of reviews. I have never written a Yelp review and thought I never would but the behavior of the manager or owner of this restaurant was so offensive I feel it's necessary. I assume he was the owner because I can safely say any employee who behaved like him would be fired. It began to storm outside and when we moved inside he yelled at us to get out of the way so he could do his job. I understand that he may have been focusing on solving the issue at hand (although a restaurant is a stage not your living room) but other employees should then be communicating with guests-- this is customer service 101. After we relocated inside we were sitting at two separate tables and there was never any assistance for connecting the tables. They also began resetting the table as I was sitting there! There were so many instances where I would have been fired had I displayed this kind of disregard for guests. Besides the attitude-- I had the weakest Campari soda I have ever had. As I look through the reviews it is clear there is a reoccurring issue with the staff and specifically the owner/manager. If this guy is not around, Sociale might be a decent place but it seems to be run by a person who has unchecked narcissistic personality disorder and severe aggression issues. I am shocked the restaurant is still open.",4,,

We cannot wait to go back.  Service was attentive and helpful.  Everything was so far beyond what we expected.  Please don't miss the chance to try this amazing neighborhood spot.  I wish I could share the photos of our dishes on this site - you would be flooding opentable to schedule a reservation!",2,,3

As we were seated down, we made sure to let the server know we would only be having drinks for the moment. We started having beers and by the 3rd one were presented with the check, unknowing of the reason. After this, my girlfriend wanted to ask for another cocktail and the manager bluntly told her she could not and that we had to leave as they were rotating tables for other diners (which by the way, were inexistent! THERE WAS NO ONE WAITING!). On top of that, he told us that playing cards was not allowed, which we had been doing from the top without any comments by anyone! Made me and my girlfriend incredibly uncomfortable! The manager was incredibly disrespectful and had no sense of hospitality... What an insane waste of money, time and of a worry-free afternoon!

I had pasta pomodoro which was pretty good. My colleagues had various foods, including the branzino, which they enjoyed.Some orders were not correct in terms of the side items ordered from the menu, and had to be sent back. This also happened to the table behind us, so I don't see that being a fluke.We had to ask for bread, although all the other tables had it already brought out.

Updated review","Okay guys, this has seriously never happened to me before! I went back to Sociale last night with some other friends and the owner comes up to personally deliver a comped grilled octopus saying ""I owe you another octopus."" Now sure, I was very impressed with that alone, but this octopus was incredible! Perfectly charred on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.... I didn't want to share it with my friends. He came back to ask how it was and explained that the first night I had been there and ordered the octopus, they had run out and went with another supplier at the last minute which just was not as good.  Totally understandable and honestly I just love knowing how much care and attention he gives to his restaurant - this place is his baby and it really shows. They get their liquor license today so no more BYOB (unless that remains an option). I had the risotto special again this time and it was made with farro (one of my favorite grains) and asparagus. Really really good! I started with the cruda which was also fantastic - really fresh crispy veggies with a light dressing and just a hint of peanut pieces which went really well with it all. For dessert I tried the cheesecake with blueberry sauce and sorbet - I wasn't even really in the mood for dessert, especially cheese cake, but this one was perfectly tart and creamy and the blueberry was awesome! I can't wait to go back - even if just for a drink and a dessert. I'm definitely a big fan of this place in case you couldn't tell ;)",7,,5
68,Michael K.,"Queens, NY",161,155,252,1.0,5/9/2015,"Sociale was something I stumbled upon while searching for a bite in dumbo. Due to the fact that they are one of only restaurants with outdoor open seating, I chose to sit down. Although the inside looked nice, the outside didn't. Plain black tables, none of which are set up for dining, really gave it a tasteless atmosphere. The menu was italian, so I asked the server what he recommended and ordered just that. We chose the Burrata, Grilled octopus, and Ravioli Entree. None of which really intrigued my taste buds, but were presented nicely. What I didnt like was the small portions of every plate. The burrata came sprinkled with some cut veggies. Burrata texture was very nice and creamy but lacked flavor with the rest of the plate. The Ravioli was a bit too buttery for me and lacked seasoning. The octopus was over cooked and chewy. It was a very small portion for octopus, half of a tentacle with some mixed greens. I didnt leave spending much because at that point I wasn't interested in ordering any more. Not trying to bash the restaurant, but nothing I ordered was exceptional. I did appreciate the plating, but the food lack excitability and flavor. The service was quick, but kept lingering around and spoke amongst themselves in a different language.",4,3,2

I read on Yelp that the portions were small, so my friend and I started with the Heirloom Tomato and Burrata, which was light and delicious. Then I had the Parpadelle with Rabbit Ragu for my entrée...and it was just perfect...flavorfull and a decent portion. The service was great, the location is really convenient to my Brooklyn Heights apartment, and I enjoyed the décor. I just wish the tables weren't SO close together. It's a pretty small space, and if you sit on the middle aisle, you will experience a lot of foot traffic walking past you during your meal. Try to get a table against the wall.

89,Ang L.,"Manhattan, NY",24,17,3,3.0,3/17/2015,"It really is nothing special. At best, what makes it nice is the ambiance and furniture. It's very dark at night lit just by candles and lights and soft music playing.The food took a long while to come out and was a bit disappointing. I got the lasagna bolognese and it was pretty bland and small. Others had a fish dish and some other pasta which was too salty apparently. So overall, it just doesn't seem worth it to eat here, but nothing terrible.Although the restaurant has a nice atmosphere, it is small and fairly cozy which means the other guests could be loud too and it gets hard to hear other people over everyone talking.",1,3,
90,Robert C.,"New York, NY",0,24,0,4.0,9/27/2015,"Came with a friend for brunch on Saturday right when they opened and we both had a good experience. We were seated right away, and served entrees within 15-20 minutes of ordering. Liked our waitress very much.Good - hanger steak eggs benedict was excellent, served with french fries (I'd ask to substitute for homefries next time) and a mesclun salad with lemon dressing. Excellent poached eggs, gooey but very warm, perfectly medium-rare hanger steak. Coffee was good too, dark roast but did not taste bitter or burned. Served in a little silver coffee pot at the table for self-refill, and came with foamed milk in a small silver cup. My friend had a spinach/parmesan omelet and spoke highly of it, too.Bad - outdoor tables were small and wobbly, we'd sit indoors next time. Drink prices were over the top, even given the neighborhood. We steered clear of $12/glass wines.Bottom line - would absolutely return for weekend brunch and get eggs benedict, probably would try the banana berry french toast too, but would sit indoors.",7,,7

Updated review","I've downgraded the review for one reason: The owner/manager. He has attacked me personally twice -- once in a private message, then in public -- after I had the audacity to call out his unaccommodating policies towards kids (see my first review). For the record: We lived three blocks away from Sociale for two years. We have eaten there many times, and I passed it almost every day on my way to work or the dog park. It's not packed 24/7. It's not friendly toward families with kids. We live in Manhattan now and eat out several days a week. We have never come across a restaurant with similar attitudes. And I have never come across a manager/owner who tries to silence unhappy customers like he does. Sad. Parents with kids looking for a place to eat in the beautiful Heights, there are better options! See my review for some examples.",1,,
93,Tyler S.,"New York, NY",211,202,108,4.0,11/30/2014,"I'm a fan of Brooklyn Heights and Sociale. We've come over here all the way from the UWS just for their soup. Yes - their soup! They make a variety of vegan and vegetarian soups that are AHHH-mazing. Great, handcrafted cocktails too. From the entrees, the Paillard, Halibut and Pasta are amazing. We're more a fan of the soups, salads, entrees than the egg/brunch dishes.A perfect lunch? Aperol Spritz, Soup, Butter Leaf Salad. Their Rosemary infused oil and bread are also fantastic though the bread is (like most Italian bread, IMO) a little overcooked compared to the more flaky, spongy-inside French bread.",4,,4
94,Canteen M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,5.0,3/26/2014,"Great food/drinks + integrity!I've eaten at Sociale four times--the food ranges from 4 to 5 stars.  Never a disappointing meal, and a welcome addition to Brooklyn Hts, joining Jack the Horse and Colonie as the only spots in the Heights with consistently tasty and interesting food (the overrated Noodle Pudding is a distant 4th).The cocktails are great (especially recommend the Smoky Manhattan) and reasonably priced at $10 each (similar drinks would be 30% more down the street at Colonie or Henry Public).But what compelled me to write this review was that, on a recent trip, I unwittingly dropped a $100 bill under the table at the end of the meal.  Sociale called me (I had made a reservation with my phone number) to ask if it was mine, and held it for me for 24 hours.  Very few other places would have the integrity to do this.  Thank you, Sociale!",10,,12
95,Jay K.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,9,1,4.0,5/10/2014,"It's nice to have good options in Brooklyn Heights, kind of a food wasteland with several exceptions.The owner is delightful and effusive.We have been twice and everything has been at least good with a few dishes being exceptional such as the burrata crostini and the short rib ravioli.Service is snappy and efficient.

98,Elizabeth N.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,4/20/2014,"Wow. We ordered the Brussels sprouts salad, a broccoli rabe side, and branzino,which was cooked to perfection and served on a bed of creamy cauliflower with hints of mustard and a shallot purée. We grappled with which dish we liked best--even the cocktails blew our minds. Ginger lovers won't regret the green goose--a pear infused concoction sent from the gods! The white-washed brick walls and votive candles in cubby holes provided endless charm, with open air space that defined industrial chic. Accidents happen, so I'm not letting an incident towards the end of our meal cloud the overall experience. One of the waiters accidentally spilled coffee on my boyfriend's neck, ruining his sweater and shirt. Management responded appropriately, handling the situation with professionalism. Again, accidents happen. But meals like this this don't come around often!",7,,8

Helpful, friendly and always welcoming.   This summer we had the pleasure of dining outdoors on their patio. What a treat!  We have taken many friends to Sociale and they all loved it.

104,David B.,"New York, NY",59,140,2,4.0,11/12/2013,"After a recent trip walking across the Brooklyn Bridge with my aunt and Hailey, we opted to skip Grimaldi's and try something a little bit off the beaten path in Brooklyn Heights.Enter Sociale. Whenever you walk into an Italian restaurant and are greeted by an entire staff speaking Italian, you know you've made a good decision.AtmosphereSociale has a very modern, clean feel to it. The vibrant atmosphere is surrounded by large windows that provide ample lighting and frame the white painted brick and dark wood floors and tables. Clean and sleek, but still with a somewhat old-world feel.FoodOf course, we pigged out, ordering from across the menu.Fried calamari, shrimp, eggplant, red peppers and marinara sauce. How can you go wrong? The Frittura Di Mare consisted of flash fried seafood and vegetables piled high on top of each other.Pappardelle Al Coniglio is made up of whole wheat pappardelle, rabbit ragout and black olives. The portion was a little small for my liking but the flavor packed a punch. This wasn't my favorite dish. I thought it could have used a little more sauce since the noodles appeared to be somewhat dry.The clear best dish of the night was the pumpkin ravioli! These bite-size raviolis were stuffed with delicious pumpkin filling in a butter sauce. The raviolis literally exploded inside my mouth at each bite. Deliciously buttery and full of flavor. I'd eat these all day long.We ordered a veal entree which was one of the specials that night. This dish consisted of a thin piece of veal topped with some greens. Simple and done well.ServiceService was exceptional. The staff was welcoming, friendly and inviting. The standout example of this was when I asked for a glass of Riesling. There weren't any 'by the glass' options for Reisling, but our waiter didn't hesitate to open a bottle anyway and pour me a glass. Great service and it clearly made an impression on me.ValueThe portions of some dishes may be a little small and Sociale isn't the cheapest restaurant on the block. However, it's not insanely priced. Prices range from $15-$18 for pastas and $20-$27 for entrees. The food is fresh, simple and delicious and everyone can find something that fits their budget on the menu.The VerdictNext time you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, skip the line at Grimaldi's and head to Sociale. Traditional Italian cuisine is fused with a modern flair and exceptional customer service. Check them out! PS - Don't mind their website. They clearly haven't updated it in a few months since the restaurant opened. You'll have to visit MenuPages.com to find the menu.",7,,7

106,Federico C.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,8/18/2013,"Italian food as good as it gets.Everything was really delicious, just like at home (I'm from Italy).You can tell how good a restaurant is by sampling the simple dishes. My girlfriend's spaghetti al pomodoro were perfect. My risotto was tasty and cooked to perfection. The burrata was the creamy real deal and my tuna carpaccio was excellent, sashimi grade, beautiful tuna. Everyone was was extremely nice. I'm reading some complaints about portions sizes vs. price...I guess it's an American thing, but in Italy we tend to have smaller portions and cheap food almost always means cheap/bad ingredients, all you can eat for $14.99 always sound scary to me!",9,2,7

Ambience is stifling, as we were seated near the stairway and bussers would bump into the table every 2.4 seconds because tables are packed to the brim. Extremely loud and a bit frenetic.Although superior to nearby Noodle Pudding and Bevacco, I will most likely make the extra trip to River Deli for the sake of price and to have a more relaxing dinner.",7,,4

That dish is so good, and I keep going back to it. The cocktails are as good as the food, and the ambiance is cozy and romantic. The manager and waiters are attentive and friendly.

Make sure to make a reservation here because it's surprisingly busy. My sister ordered the burrata and fried calamari which was good. I got the spaghetti with tomato sauce which was amazing because all the pastas are homemade. Here comes the bad part...My mom ordered the pork chop which took 30 minutes to come. Ridiculous. I know. After waiting such a long time for the food my mom asked the manager how much longer it would take and he told us that we should leave if we can't wait. In the business world the customer is alway right. I could not believe that he would be so rude to us.Then when the pork chop arrives it's extremely dry and overcooked. My mom told the waiter and she ordered the spaghetti carbonara instead and the broccoli rabe which arrived quickly. Then when we got the bill they didn't even take off the pasta even though we waited so long for the food and her main dish was overcooked.

117,Kenji T.,"Brooklyn, NY",531,13,0,4.0,9/4/2013,"Was very excited to eat here, on a saturday evening in august, the windows were open and its was a tad hot. Dinner for two, small table in the middle and not much elbow room, got banged into a couple of times, with the hustle and bustle, didn't really mind, but next time - will shoot for a table out of the fray. It is quite dark in the evening and sets a romantic mood, but it can be somewhat hard to see the menu.Friendly and attentive service, we ordered 3 appetizers, everyone seems to complain about the serving sizes, these were fine. We ordered the Octopus, Meatballs and salumi and cheese plate. The bbq'd octopus was fantastic, the best I have ever had. Smokey and perfectly chewy, highly recommended. The meatballs were composed of assorted meats, featuring veal and were good - topped with shaved parm. The salumi and cheese plate for two featured shredded prosciutto, speck, pancetta and aged Parmesan with honey. It was good, but I am a fan of my cured meats sliced thin and layered - I would give it a 6 out of 10, but then again I am spoiled by Crispo. (Review soon)My girlfriend ordered the pasta of the night which was shrimp stuffed ravioli over basil/pesto sauce and it was quite good. Super smooth and creamy. My entree was the steamed brazino over fregola (a type of mini-pasta, similar to cous-cous), mini clams, leeks, capers and bottarga (roe) This was a great dish, a beautiful piece of fish over a very interesting mix of seafood. I personally would have liked the fish to be very slightly browned for a crisper bite, to have a bit more texture.Our desert was the olive oil cake, a much fancier name with tangerine, gelato, and assorted other ingedients, it was okay - seemed to try too hard and the elements sort of fell apart. I will definitely try it out again, but its still second string to Noodle Pudding, two blocks away. PROS: Excellent, authentic Italian food, with great care in their fresh ingredients and presentation. Amazing service.CONS: Slightly packed, especially in the center aisles.",4,1,2

So I give it a try I order a and the waiter brought the entree and never sent the salad. Really come on! So I speak up I am annoyed, and the owner/manager had a temper and told me not to come back. Hello creep I am a customer. Way too many other restaurants to choose from. No one should be treated that way. I just wanted my salad before finishing my entree is that too much?

The servers are the best, the owner Francesco is always a delight to see, and will do anything possible to make your experience amazing. Now the food, the food is very classic simple Italian, the menu is one page but has something for everyone, and the wine list is filled with some great picks, but ask Francesco or Ismael (not sure what his position is, but he knows everything) for some recommendations, they never disappoint.

Each night they have a risotto special and a meat special aside from a decent variety of dishes in the menu.

The owner, waitstaff,  and bartenders are all friendly, warm and real. The food is excellent, my two favorites being spaghetti al pomodoro and the pollo arrosto con polenta (chicken :-)  ).

131,Paul D.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,44,5,2.0,11/9/2013,"Here's the deal: The pastas were fresh and tasty, but really should fall under the appetizer list. Our pasta dishes amounted to approximately a half a coffee mug full of food (I'd say just shy of 4 oz). One in our group got the pappardelle with rabbit ragu which was really delicious. I got the tagliatelle with seafood: the flavor was nice but I bit into exactly 3 little dices of calamari. And for $18 a plate, that's pretty ridiculous. Even restaurants that advertise their pasta courses as ""primi piatti"" offer more than that. The starter salads and service were fine. But they really need to figure the pasta thing out. On another note - with the always excellent Noodle Pudding right down the block, why does there need to be 3 Italian restaurants in less than a 2-street stretch?",1,1,

137,Conor H.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,16,1,2.0,2/1/2015,"I don't think there is anything particularly wrong with sociale, it's just nothing special. The food and atmosphere are OK, and the menu is solid. Sure, it's not crazy pricy, but if you have consider the small size of the portions, it is. We ordered two plates of pasta for $18 each and they were minuscule. It was like a shot of pasta. Good thing there's a pizza place nearby....",1,4,
138,Kara B.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,21,0,3.0,1/14/2014,"Sociale brings a little swank to Henry Street, with a more intimate & candlelit setting than you'll find anywhere else in northern Brooklyn Heights. The menu is a bit pricey, but the cocktails and food were so tasty!  We ordered the top-notch scallops appetizer, plus the lasagna and pumpkin ravioli. The serving size for each was plenty!  No complaints about service, which we found to be attentive and thougthful.One comment on the setting: the tables are very crowded together, and the noise level is very high on a busy night.",,,
139,Joe D.,"Austin, TX",0,12,0,5.0,5/16/2016,"Small neighborhood restaurant which makes their pasta, so very good menu and wine list.  Seems to be a favorite of the locals and the food was excellent as was service.  We like small Italian restaurants and this one will be at the top of the list.",,,1
140,Scott C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,111,0,3.0,5/17/2016,I have eaten here a few times since they opened and always found the food and drink to be good.  A little pricey for some items - but it is Brooklyn Heights.  I have read some of the reviews here and what I find troubling is the owner's flippant responses to any criticism from reviewers.  It's outright unprofessional and probably why the restaurant doesn't get to 4 stars.  Francesco you need to be able to take some pushback from your customers; nobody is perfect.  I agree that a lot of the stroller complaints aren't well founded and should not cause you to get lower ratings; but you can't be a jerk in responding to legitimate complaints. It is not helping you!,,,
141,Stacey G.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,150,14,5.0,1/5/2014,We came for dinner last night and had a 7:15 reservation. We were sat within 5 minutes. My first thought was the place was a little tight but I forgot about that as soon as the food came out. We ordered the meatballs to start and you can tell they were homemade. They were moist and absolutely delicious as was the sauce. For dinner my husband and I ordered the pumpkin ravioli and we're not disappointed. It was like nothing I've ever had. The pumpkin ravs I've had in the past taste nothing like pumpkin. But these did with a creamy pumpkin filling and brown sugar on the outside. Delicious and a decent portion. I probably could've ate another serving. We also had a side of broccoli rabe which was done extremely well. We ended with dessert which was the perfect ending to the meal. We look forward to coming back again very soon. Nice to have quality Italian in the neighborhood.,9,,10
142,Bridget J.,"Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, NY",51,1,0,1.0,3/12/2016,"Unfortunately had to cancel a reservation at the last minute due to a serious family emergency- only to receive a text message from the restaurant a few minutes later telling me to never reserve a table there again and that I would be reported to Open Table!!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! I was amazed that a business would treat someone like. LIFE HAPPENS people! I actually wasted 5 minutes texting a response about how I couldn't believe how a business would respond in such an inappropriate way- only to receive another text of ""okay bye"". AGAIN... Seriously?! Did I just travel back in time to junior high school? I don't know if I would waste any more of my time to actually call and speak with the manager or owner.... maybe they know the rude, ridiculous, immature staff that they have employed...or sadly, maybe they were aware of what was taking place.  What I do know is that I want my fellow Brooklyn heights and Bococa residents to know how horrible this place and there staff are, and ask you to please not give them your business!!",1,1,
143,Christina M.,"Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY",4,9,0,3.0,4/15/2016,Slightly above average.  Service is average.  I've dined at many Italian restaurants over the years.  Calamari is too salty and greasy.  The branzini is tiny and not well plated.  Stick to the pasta dishes I guess.  I just moved to the neighborhood and they didn't make a good impression. The place is usually not full which is not a good sign. I went in when it was only half full and they all seem stressed out like it is so busy. Wine list is short.,,1,

146,Raphael H.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,11,0,1.0,10/30/2014,Went there twice. First time was not very good an experience so I decided to try again. The octopus appetizer was okay but everything else went downhill from there. Beautiful atmosphere. Decent wine but avoid if you're a foodie,,6,
147,Eamonn M.,"Overton, United Kingdom",0,3,2,3.0,11/6/2015,It is a shame this restaurant does not offer gluten free pasta as an option. Because of this I had to order the steak.

148,Rupa G.,"New York, NY",1,39,0,4.0,7/17/2015,"Chanced upon this as I was in the hood with a friend - at first the 3.5 stars on Yelp got us skeptical but we decided to give it a try. Glad we did! Extremely nice staff - I will go back to any restaurant that has Pablo. He let us try a few wine and was on the money about everything he recommended. The grilled octopus is one of the best I ever had - charred to perfection - and the whole wheat pappardelle with rabbit ragout was above average if not outstanding. The passion fruit semifreddo was delightful. As for drinks, I tried the lychee mojito - it was meh - so I switched to wine. The olive bread was nice. Overall, I will go back - a nice place to catch up over dinner a nice summer evening.",4,,4

Updated review","After several more visits, I have to admit I was a tad overexcited with my 5-star rating. While the food is consistently top-notch, the entree portions are just way too small to feed an adult. You need to get an appetizer, a pasta dish, a main, and a dessert to feel full. Given their prices, you are looking at a $100-150 price tag for 2. Nothing wrong with that per se, but it's too much for a neighborhood joint.",4,2,7
150,Patricia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,6,1,4.0,2/16/2014,My husband and I went here for Valentines Day and the food was great. The reason why I'm not giving this 5 stars is because there were only 2 little pieces of octopus on our plate which led me to believe that  a) they ran out b) some dropped off the plate?,4,,5
151,Sarah H.,"Manhattan, NY",1,23,0,1.0,8/10/2015,"Beware all mothers with strollers! I was horrified yesterday at the customer service and management at this restaurant when my husband and I attempted to eat at Sociale with two friends and their 5 month old baby in a stroller. I am also pregnant and it was important we eat indoors because of the heat. There was not a soul inside the restaurant at 11:30am on a Sunday yet the management refused to allow us to dine inside because of a strict rule against strollers. We argued there wasnt a single customer and we would be out within an hour but they refused to allow us to eat inside, arguing they would fill up quickly. I hope this costs Sociale quite a bit of business from local families...",1,8,
152,Tracy R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,28,0,2.0,9/8/2014,"We had been regulars at this restaurant for around six months and always enjoyed the food.  A little expensive and quite small portions but the quality was worth it.Just recently the service has been erratic, things being forgotten from the order, drinks taking forever, food being spilled; this wouldn't be a problem if the manager was on top of it but instead he spends the majority of his time speaking in a VERY loud voice (about himself!) to his favorite customers and getting in the way of the poor guys trying to serve.  He has no concern that things are going badly wrong around him, just enjoys having a captive audience of the poor customers desperately trying to eat!Seriously, go to Noodle Pudding, just a much nicer atmosphere all round.",,6,
153,Corona W.,"Somerville, MA",33,163,2,4.0,12/23/2013,Enjoyed a really tasty meal in the basement dining room which I highly recommend for special occasions.

156,Laura M.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,39,1,3.0,6/29/2014,Really unimpressed. With great brunches available all over the place you need to do better than this. $14 for a two egg omlette and 'roast' potatoes aka steamed and pan cooked is about as dissapointing as brunch can get. Topping it off was re $3 a glass soda with no refills. Save your money.,,6,

The meal was perfect - they even accommodated our two fussy eaters.  The food was delicious and the service, although slightly leisurely, was excellent.While some people may complain about small portions, the food here reminded me of the many restaurants I have eaten at all over Italy.  Portions are sized for a full meal.  I promise that if you have an appetizer, entree and dessert, you will leave sated, satisfied and happy.  The quality of the food belies the price.  There is very little here that if the restaurant were in Manhattan, wouldn't cost half again as much.I would come back in a second and plan to do so.",6,,4

I really hope this place makes it (and puts Bevacco to shame)!!! The interior is quaint and simply decorated. The waiters (and everyone on staff) were so friendly and welcoming plus our waiter was actually Italian, which always helps the ambiance of an Italian restaurant! Super cute ;)I had the special pasta of the day, Tagliatelle with Mushrooms. The pasta was made fresh and was delish, with a nice bite just how I like. I wish I was more hungry because everything looked great, especially the deserts. I will absolutely be back. Great addition to the neighborhood!",3,,3

168,Peter H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0,4.0,8/18/2013,"Sociale is a fairly new spot on Henry Street: a square room, brick walls painted white, simple tables & chairs, room for about thirty, I would guess. I dropped in, more or less by accident, after a Sunday morning walk, a little after noon, for a light & simple brunch: asparagus & pancetta omelet, & a warm salad: spinach & fava beans.Service was friendly but slow: it took half an hour for the omelet to come up from the basement. Fillings were very good: very thin asparagus, barely cooked & crackly, & generously cut pancetta. The egg part, however, looked like a pancake wrapped around the filling, and tasted like one too.The warm salad was delicious: really fresh spinach, quickly cooked and rolled in olive oil. It's a bit late in the season for fava beans, but they tasted good enough for the pairing with the spinach to succeed. Along with a couple of glasses of carbonated water, the bill came in just under $30.The place is new: it may work out its kinks. In the meanwhile, the underground chef knows & understands vegetables.",2,,2
169,David V.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/5/2013,"That place is in my neighborhood and I really want to love that place because the place is beautiful and charming.The food is correct but not generous, portion are too small, even for my european stomach !

170,Heidi A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,14,0,5.0,8/11/2014,"This is Italian food the way it's served in Italy: simple, fresh ingredients unencumbered by a lot of sauces, spices and fussiness. Everything is just enough--basta! The portions are actually a little larger than you get in Italy. Italian meals are meant to be several courses, but my husband and I typically share an appetizer then each get a plate of pasta, and we're usually too stuffed for dessert (which is a shame, because the desserts are excellent). I see some people have commented on the prices, and they are not low. But they're not high either. When you're relying on the primary flavors of your main ingredients, you can't buy cheap food; simple, fresh dishes mean you need to buy better ingredients. Let's also be realistic about Brooklyn Heights real estate. Lease terms are painfully expensive, and that's reflected in the prices at every restaurant. I live in this neighborhood, and this is my favorite restaurant, my go-to when I'm taking people out, the place I point tourists to.",9,,9
171,Pippo T.,"Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,4.0,9/7/2013,"My first review on Yelp.  As a sophisticated home cook, their food does not make me miss one of my dishes and I really wanted to write about it.  It's authentic Italian food which comes with all its pros and cons. Pros: it's the real deal, cons: it's expensive and the portions are small for American standards (regular size in Italy). The alternatives in the neighborhood are Bevacco (also authentic & expensive, but poorly managed) and Noodle Pudding (good Italian-American). For real Italian, I stick to Sociale because the staff is attentive, while Bevacco feels dead and each time I go there it makes me feels sorry for them as they wasted a great opportunity as first movers.",1,,3

174,Bartmann V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,0,2.0,8/12/2013,"My wife and I went here at 5pm on a summer weekday evening.  Here are couple of points:1.  The specialty cocktail I ordered had WAY too much ice and not enough liquid.  I finished it in two swallows. About five minutes later I ordered the second cocktail without ice and used ice from the first cocktail.  At that point the drink was good.  (If the waiter had been seasoned he would have read between the lines and comped us the second drink).2.  The prosciutto covered pork was beautifully displayed and tenderly arranged, but the pork was overcooked and dry.3.  The portions were too skimpy.  You know that awful feeling you get when you realize that you're still hungry after an appetizer and an entree?  So we ordered another basket of bread to dip into the olive oil.  The bread was tasty.4.  The price for two people of $151.56 was really too much.  No one wants to go out for a casual dinner in their neighborhood and spend that much.This place could excel if it were a neighborhood joint that offered good food at a good price.  You can tell that the Italian owners really care about food and were still working out the kinks in the timing of arrival of appetizers and entrees.  And when the fire alarm went off, it also pointed to the restaurant's newness.  Perhaps I've become too impatient to explain to the owners of this newly opened restaurant why our meal fell way short of expectations.  But I didn't want a casual, walk around the neighborhood to turn into a teaching moment.  As it stands, I would not go back to Sociale.  It is not significantly better, nor significantly cheaper than my favorite Brooklyn Heights restaurants.",2,,
175,allison w.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,3,0,4.0,9/26/2013,"The food was delicious. We started with the Carrot Soup (special) and Tomato and Burrata. We shared the Ravioli and a side of Potatoes as our main course. Everything met or exceeded our expectations. The ambiance was nice and romantic. As people have noted, the tables are close together, so ask for one on the perimeter so you don't get bumped by the servers or other diners. However, like so many others have already commented here, the portion sizes are on the smaller side and most notably, expensive. We couldn't get over the $14 price of the Burrata appetizer (especially given it's size - 3 small tomato slices topped with a spoonful of Burrata) or $8 for a side of roasted potatoes. While I'm sure we'll visit again, they'll need to increase the portion size (and let their customers know they have!) if they want repeat local business aside from special occasions.",1,,2

To start, we ordered drinks at the bar. My martini glass was only half filled, and the bartender shortened me on change. It took twice as long to get a table as they ""promised"" and another 10 minutes after we were seated for the waiter to come over. I had to flag someone down to get a refill on water. Our server didn't come back to check on us until almost our last bite and never once asked if we wanted another drink. We shared the polenta, which was excellent. I had the lasagna, which was mediocre (it is much, much better at the River Deli). My friend had the pumpkin ravioli, which was good but very sweet for an entree.

Although our server was attentive in taking our order, it took close to 40 minutes for our panini sandwiches to come out.  Thankfully we ordered the meatball appetizer to share and it was delicious-- although small.  When the paninis finally arrived, they were just ""meh"" and the salad on the side was over-salted. My request to hold the mayo on the panino was not granted, but after waiting so long for it,  I couldn't  waste anymore time waiting for the kitchen, or the server, to bring another. $10 for a meager sandwich, 3 bites of salad  and bad service is not what keeps places in business. It was not very crowded and the server seemed to be alone, except for the manager/owner who was an (unfortunate) presence, pacing up and down the center aisle and giving off a weird vibe. Great decor, open & airy. Overpriced for meager portions and be prepared to wait for your lunch order.",,,

As a vegan, it's sometimes hard to eat out but they did me proud. They have a soup and half sandwich combo with a bit of salad as well, that was delicious and affordable. The soup was veggie based and pretty tasty but the sandwich, the classic roasted veggie sandwich, which is the ubiquitous sandwich all vegans end up eating when going out, was so damn good. Usually they suck. The veggies are grilled wrong so they are too soggy or flavorless. But this one made great use of oven roasted tomatoes which upped the flavor profile immensely. And somehow their grilling method and thin veggie size worked. I ended up bringing my other friend back a week later. She's a BK local and was thrilled to find out about it. They have a cocktail made with grapes that she loved and I enjoyed a full one of those veggie sandwiches (screw soup, I need sandwich!!) and a lovely glass of Lambrusco.

186,R M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,2.0,11/15/2014,"RUMOROSO!!! Despite the superb cucina this establishment serves, the noise level is unbelievably high -- even when half empty, the chit-chat of even a few customers plus the music and the noise of the staff rattling plates makes a conversation more like a shouting match. Don't even think of sitting near the bar. Also, I had to get up to close the front door to protect us from the chilly draft -- near closing time the staff is less attentive to the few remaining customers -- as they added to the noise level by congregating in the back and engaged in ""conversaziione.""

I  have never experienced the rudeness that I experienced at Sociale tonight. I went there with my husband, son and his girlfriend  a little after 5pm. We were only the second group there for dinner. We ordered our dinner promptly and we got our appetizers fairly quickly but by 6pm we had still not gotten our entrees and my son and his girlfriend were about to head out to the airport to go to Spain. We called the waiter over, who rudelyly mumbled something about the food being ready in a few minutes.  The manager also came over and said he was supposedly expediting the meal but then, inexplicably, a few minutes later, he comes over and says we are ""no longer welcome at his restaurant""  and that we had only waited a half an hour. We have never had such an experience ever in Brooklyn Heights or any where in NYC.  There were no apologies, no explanation--what ever happened to customer knows best, never mind just common courtesy.We will obviously never go back to this restaurant whether or not we are ""invited back"" but we are still stunned by the response.",1,2,

I saved room for dessert and had the tortino al cioccolato (chocolate cake) with salted caramel gelato.

193,John M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,240,0,4.0,9/25/2014,"good food, though small portions and a bit pricey.  the burrata crostini was a highlight.",4,,4
194,Rosemarie S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,4.0,8/1/2013,"Ate there last night. Service and food were great. However, $14 for 3 pieces of octopus was a bit steep. Four pieces of hanger steak, 2 carrots and some mushrooms for $28??? . Portions could be a bit bigger.",1,,1
195,S R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,5.0,7/28/2013,Attention to detail.  Simple dishes with complex and layered taste and texture.  Staff that cares about your experience.  This place is a winner.,,,1
196,Zando E.,"New York, NY",0,99,5,3.0,1/24/2014,"The menu at Sociale aims straight up the middle - conservative Italian fare, nothing you haven't seen before. And they prepare that food well. Not quite as well as Noodle Pudding, their primary competition around these parts, but it's mostly very good. Why only 3 stars, then? The value is not great, neither is the service, and seating is very tight. It's too bad, since there's little reason to be so stingy with mostly inexpensive ingredients. (""that's how we do it in Italy"" is a lame excuse) To get a filling meal - in the American context -  you'll need at least an appetizer and an entree, and if you don't choose carefully even that might not be enough. It's far too easy to spend well over $50 a head here, and the food, while good, just isn't in that league. If you're a couple, you'll be seated at a tiny table, even if the restaurant is otherwise empty. ""we need for group"", they'll tell you, in a charming accent. (Unless the diner is one of their buddies, then they get a big table) Service is European, and that's not a compliment. I walk past this place every day, and If they were a little more generous, courteous and professional I'd dine here often. As it is, Sociale is an OK second choice if we feel like Italian and Noodle Pudding is full. Their main advantage in this neighborhood is that they take credit cards, which NP doesn't.",,1,
