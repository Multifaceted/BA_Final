2,Alvin D.,"New York, NY",116,67,106,4.0,5/26/2018,Come here often because I go to Baruch. Conor at the bar is my go to guy because he's very welcoming and very friendly. Recognizes me when I come in and always hooks it up. Decent place for a pint or a regular drink. You can also play darts  which is pretty cool.,3,,1
3,Linda M.,"Journal Square, Jersey City, NJ",110,1,0,1.0,6/17/2018,"I used to love coming here for years, and recently I went in for food and drinks with friends. It took over 1 hour for the food to come out. The waiter was on his phone the whole time, was not personable or alerted us our mozzarella sticks and chicken tenders would take one hour. When I told them that we were tight on time, they said they would comp it and we could take it to go. Well as we're leaving with our food they said we needed to pay for our COMPED meals. Manny the waiter was nasty the whole time. The bartender was much more helpful. Get a new waiter Fitz's",,,
4,Kevin M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,22,3,5.0,9/30/2017,"I stumbled upon this place when I was extremely hungry and the menu had just what I was craving - hot wings. I've tried hot wings at countless NYC restaurants/pubs. Fitzgerald's has the BEST. They were super crispy, just the right amount of spiciness, and they don't use those jumbo, fatty type wings like the rest. The happy hour has fine prices and the decor was the typical Irish pub style. The service was also great and I was happy that I could actually have a conversation as most places crank up the volume too much. Overall, I will definitely come back for the wingssssssss!",1,,
5,Alyssa C.,"New York, NY",77,176,17,5.0,1/22/2017,"Had a great time watching the playoffs at Fitzgeralds after walking in the rain to nearby bars with no available tables. Fitzgeralds is clean, not smelly, and has excellent service. Tony was great. He helped us pick out food and drinks, and polishes a real soft table (inside joke between us, obv). The food, service and atmosphere were all fantastic, we have already decided to make this ""our bar.""",,,
6,Alexis R.,"Floral Park, NY",399,731,191,5.0,10/24/2016,I came here with a classmate twice. The bartenders are nice and the drinks are always cold. The food was good and nice atmosphere. No complaints!,2,,1

Friendly enough staff.,5,3,6
9,Ryan Y.,"Westlake Village, CA",86,101,141,3.0,11/1/2016,"Just your average bar in New York City. Nothing special about it, but was a nice place to go with a friend, catch up, and watch some football, I would come here if I was around the area looking for a drink, but wouldn't go out of my way to come here. In a very good location though near colleges and the heart of New York City so that's a positive for them.",,,
10,Eddie G.,"Bronx, NY",34,120,21,4.0,10/30/2016,Around the corner from Carlton Arms hotel and I am celebrating my birthday weekend and to start I've stopped by Fitzgerald's pub and it makes for a nice neighborhood bar you can grab a drink and get some good food and enjoy a college football game. Size of the place is small but that really didn't matter cause it was in the afternoon when I arrived. Oh for those wondering Wi-Fi is free and fast in this place. I definitely like to come again,,,
11,Ashley A.,"Alphabet City, Manhattan, NY",90,111,189,3.0,8/5/2015,"Stopped by for happy hour. Not too shabby and $4 drafts. The atmosphere was very mic like a sports bar. The bartender was friendly and very laid back. Probably not a place I'd go out of my way to get to, but I'd definitely stop by if I were in the area. Only downside is that there is a $15 on cards!",1,,
12,Sandra Lorena V.,"Manhattan, NY",140,162,214,4.0,10/2/2014,"Went here on a Wednesday night roughly around 11 and stayed until 3 am. When we came in there were a few men at the bar. We found a table and ordered drinks at the bar. Through the night we had 4 drinks each (there were 4 of us) and no complaints. The drinks ranged from a jack and coke to shots of whiskey and beer. A Cosmo was a bit too sweet, but it was my first time trying one so it could just be like that. Sometimes I like to get a blue Hawaiian and was surprised the bartender made it just right.  The man at the bar was probably the owner and had good vibes. Chill place, but probably packed weekend nights since it's close to a campus. I also hear the food is really good, but didn't try it this night.",1,,
13,Sashay T.,"New York, NY",229,17,19,1.0,6/20/2016,"If you've never experienced racism before and you feel like taking a whiff of it...then this is your place to go. The owner (a white old man) was rude and disrespectful to us, we were celebrating 2 birthdays and  visited on Friday, June 17th at approximately 6pm with about 10-12 people (professional ""minorities"") during happy hour. No one was drunk, we were only there for about an hour. As we were wishing our friends a Happy Birthday and we cheered for them,  this man approached us and told us to be quiet (not in a nice way). He then proceeded to drown us out with very loud music. Then about 3 of us got up to play darts and this man goes and take the darts from my friends and said it was too busy to play darts! There was about 23 people in this bar in total. Needless to say we paid our bill (he's lucky we did) and left. PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!",3,2,1
14,Janice F.,"Manhattan, NY",573,503,401,4.0,3/19/2014,"I like it here.  It is a college crowd (considering there is a college right around the corner), but also a lot of the Flat Iron corporate crowd.I came here for the first time on St. Patricks day, and being that Fitzgeralds is an Irish pub, it was packed.  But no lie, the bartenders handled it really really well.There are tables to sit and eat- I can't necessarily vouch for the meal food, but it looks like it could be comfortable to sit and eat here.  As for the bar food- it's greasy and salty.  The buffalo wings are very spicy- but it's just typical bar food. It's pretty expensive- for a basket of fries and wings- total almost $20.There's lots of TV, showing news or games.Good selection of alcohol.  Beer- there's just your basics.  Shots and beer are both $7, it's standard bar prices.  I would come back for a drink here, the bartenders know what they're doing.  Just be careful- there's a $20 minimum for card charges.",2,,1
15,Tashnuva E.,"Queens, Queens, NY",265,538,119,2.0,4/30/2014,"On a day when class is not in session, Fitz is not a bad bar to go to.However, on the days there are class, good luck squeezing through the copious amounts of college students that frequent this place. It's so crowded that you can barely move from one spot to another without pushing and shoving. On any other day when the crowd and noise level is moderate, it's a nice place to catch up with friends.Because so many college students come here, naturally the bar would overprice its alcohol. So far, this place has one of the more expensive happy hour deals in the area. $7 special for well drinks? Come on! I can go one block over and get the same drink for $4.I will give credit to the bartenders and say that they're sweet people and they even make your drinks strong! 1 Blue Long Island is is almost always enough to get me to tipsy heaven.",1,,

19,Rick E.,"Glen Oaks, NY",0,40,0,4.0,8/22/2016,It's your local college bar and frequented by college students. Great place to chill and have a drink. Nothing fancy about it. It's clean with a decent selection of alcohol. Slightly more expensive than other top places in the city.,,,
20,Justine O.,"Crown Heights, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/17/2016,"DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ESTABLISHMENT. It's Friday night at 6pm and our party of 10-12 is celebrating 2 birthdays. We toast and are excited, and the bar owner comes up to us to tell us to be quiet. 3 of us go to play darts a few minutes later, bar owner grabs darts out of one person's hand and tells them darts is off limits because the bar is ""too crowded."" There are 23 people in the bar. Maximum capacity probably would be at least 100 people. Did I mention the bar owner is an old white man and we were the only people of color (and the biggest party) in the spot?

21,Pattie L.,"Queens, NY",35,322,3879,3.0,12/24/2013,"It's an okay pub. Went randomly on a Monday night and it was just the bartender running the place, meaning cleaning up tables and serving. The selections of beers is minimal. The crowd is def a college crowd. Bathroom is clean for a pub.  All in all probably won't be returning as there isn't  anything special to this place at least in my opinion.",1,,

23,Richard K.,"Graniteville, Staten Island, NY",0,7,0,5.0,10/29/2015,"Great local pub with a very friendly and attentive staff.  It's a no frills kinda place, but in a really good way.  It's a great local establishment that has been there for many years.  College students frequent this place (given that Baruch is around the corner), but it also has a good local crowd who live and work in the area.Good selection of beers and whiskeys. They also have happy hour specials.  Food is your standard pub fare (burgers, sandwiches, apps). Nothing fancy, but delicious and executed well.  It can get crowded some nights, but it's mostly a relaxed atmosphere. It's a place you can go alone to have a beer and watch a game, or with a group.",,,
24,Julia L.,"Queens, NY",1318,174,325,3.0,1/11/2011,"Located on the street right behind a college, this place seems to be brimming with college students. That's either a good or bad thing, depending on what sort of person you are. I suppose it was because it was a Wednesday night (or something like that) when my friends and I made a trip here based on a recommendation. Surprisingly, it's a rather small space, but it was quaint. The lighting was dark, but the atmosphere was warm, considering that you're practically sitting on top of each other. The service was adequate enough. Attentive, but it was a little slow. Perhaps that was because there was a game going on the screen. A very interesting game.We ordered Guinesses and Baileys Irish Cream. Delicious, but a bit pricey. Then again, it wasn't happy hour, so I can't really complain. The food was absolutely delicious. Cheeseburgers were large, but I wish there were a few more fries. Those were good, too. I had a French onion soup and it was one of the best I've ever had and I'm a bit picky with it.They had darts to play and a group of Asian girls were already in a very heated game with each other, so I didn't bother asking if my friends and I could have a go. Overall, it's a nice, authentic pub. Low key and cozy.",5,,
25,Marcus D.,"Boston, MA",40,669,0,3.0,4/16/2013,Decent place for a quick pint and a grilled cheese sandwich.  They do Irish breakfast (didn't have it) so I'm not sure if they have black puddings (among my favorite).,1,,
26,Zach L.,"State College, PA",149,219,175,4.0,7/7/2013,"Great little Irish pub without too many wannabes, hipsters, or douches. The bartenders are friendly and it is a great hangout. Lots of fun to shoot darts and drink beer, especially at 1pm!",,,

28,N T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,0,1.0,7/24/2012,"FORCED people in our party of 6 to purchase sodas so the jackass server could charge 20% auto-gratuity. It is the same asshole each time, and this has never been an issue, but I guess because it was a slow night they decided to act like assholes to whatever business they did receive. When we finally paid it took forever for us to received our change back (I assume he thought he was getting an added tip in addition to the contrived one? Give me a break.). By the way, I am not sure where the bartender got the price for Tullamore Dew on the rocks... maybe up his ass? I can get a fifth of that whisky for around $25, and he wanted to charge $10 for a drink of it.",4,1,
29,John P.,"Manhattan, NY",39,60,220,3.0,2/13/2011,"Disappointing.  The bar area has promise, but the table section is small with awful lighting.  Crowd is mostly trashy college kids.  I think I was the only person over 30.Service is correct, but no more.  Ordered a French onion soup and a chicken pot pie.  Both came together.  The soup wasn't bad, but the CPP was watery.  I was hard pressed to find any chicken in it.Music way too loud.  Couple of TV screens for sports, but the music made it difficult to follow anything going on on TV.In a neighborhood with other much better choices, I can't think of any reason to come here again.",,,2

My fave by far. Still want to try a burger at some point.The chicken nuggets/fingers are blah (very very bland and oily), give them a miss. Better to come with a friend or two, but if you don't, the bartenders are always willing to chat! Friendly regulars atmosphere.",,,

34,N. H.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",60,22,5,4.0,9/10/2014,"It's a great place to spend time with your friends. The drinks are good too, however, it's sometimes hard to get the bartenders attention and the wait can be long. Other than that the place is not bad.",,1,
35,Christine F.,"Woodside, NY",0,13,0,1.0,9/3/2015,Was in there on a Thursday around 1pm and was told I couldn't sit at the bar and have a water while my friend had a beer. Keep in mind the place was empty. Ridiculous.,1,,
36,Alina G.,"New York, NY",202,108,26,3.0,1/13/2012,"So weird I haven't reviewed this place yet.... I go to Baruch so that's all I really need to say. Well alright, I guess I'll go into detail. It cannot be said enough how many times I have been here. At one point in my life, I was here probably 4 times a week at the very least. Can't say I'm proud of that but hey, we have dubbed it as the ""Baruch Bar"". Its on the corner of the college and basically everyone there (especially on Thursdays) is from Baruch. Sure you have your occasional suit or tourist group there. Very fun to mingle with them. Kevin the bartenders the best, so say hi!During the day its your typical Irish Pub. They used to have happy hour all day long (some $4 beers, $5 well drinks), but now its only til 8 or so. At night, especially weeknights, it turns very collegey so beware if you are not into that sort of thing. There is a seat area separate from the bar. You get a waiter there so its frowned upon to go to the bar to order drinks yourself, but hes very attentive so you don't need to worry about waiting. Its a rather small place, so its horrid when it gets super crowded. In the back, you can play darts. There's a jukebox by the front. Decent bar food, I recommend the cheese fries! Its a very laid back, sports/college/Irish bar/pub atmosphere.",2,1,1
37,J G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,24,0,5.0,1/21/2012,"I don't care what others say about its location or clientele, being of a college fare.It is a quiet tucked away Irish bar in a separate building that displays games on multiple TVs at the bar while playing the finest and simplified music in the background: Classic rock. Back to back to back excellent songs, the 70s types with basic guitar, flute, and vocals, to put you in a calm state of ease. Great bar to watch a major game. Very friendly and kind bartender from LD Bell HS and Philly who provides great conversation and connects with the patrons. Somebody came in with a Dallas Cowboys hat which caused the lot of us to have a talking with about sports in general. I hope to be back soon for the great music during a sporting event. Crowd is not too crazy, just enough to enjoy the game but not too overboard. There are also some tables, and food is served til 9:00pm. Though I've yet to try the typical bar food, it seems to be delicious.",2,,1
38,JB J.,"Atlanta, GA",0,23,9,1.0,12/8/2014,"Came here with a party of 10. From the beginning the waiter was an ass, didnt care about us at all. The food was good but the service was awful.",,,
39,Jia J.,"New York, NY",316,470,422,4.0,6/22/2011,"It's really ridiculous how hard I studied all New York City businesses to find a bar that was not only Boston-tolerant but Boston-enthusiastic. Game 7 of the 2011 Stanley Cup was imminent. It being a Wednesday on June 15th, 2011, I couldn't hope to Fung Wah it back to my home city in time to be with my own kind for such a sensitive moment in hockey history, so it was really important for me to find the right spot. The only common result in all my searches was The Hairy Monk. Finally, I called the place and asked if they were playing the game that night. ""Yah,"" the girl on the phone said in a no-nonsense tone. Done.That evening, during the tail end of a geeked out Cal alum happy hour at Three Monkeys on the West Side, my California native friend and I tore ourselves away from our balcony view of a movie screen sized projection of the Bruins versus the Canucks. Great view, but no audio. It was sacrilege to listen to the teams duke it out to a soundtrack of shitty lounge techno.As we ran up The Hairy Monk, we saw that the place had spilled out onto the entire block. The mobs should have been a testament to the Bostonian spirit of the place. However,  we didn't feel like sniffing armpits or getting accidentally stabbed with half bottles of Coors Light, so we looked outside the street to Fitzgerald's with only a slightly smaller crowd. Suddenly, the whole street roared. I ran up to the door of Fitzgerald's, whereupon a few Boston boys screamed, ""Get in heah - we just got a goal!"" This statement was heartening for several reasons. First, they assumed that I was from Boston and on their side. Second, they assumed I was there to see the game. Third, they invited me in like it was their grandma's house. Even from a corner by the door, we were able to see the action. Soon, though, we squeezed into two front-and-center stools in front of a bar, shepherded by a bearlike drunk dude that had gone grizzly to teddy within the 2nd period of the game because he was buzzed on booze and the winning tide.I got Guinnesses of course, from the main bartender who looked like Brian Williams, dressed like a non-douchey golf pro, and had an Irish accent. He let the beers sit still for a while. Once, he kind of forgot to bring the beer to me for a while, but I have to forgive him because it was a legitimate nuthouse in the place, and I was truly fixated on what was going on on the ice.Some fat, horrific Mexican dude started talking up my friend, who acted as my buffer as he attempted to flirt with us both by explaining why, since he's a minority, he can say things like ""slanty eyes"" without racist attentions. Whatever, fool. He bought us tequila shots. I drank and ignored him. He sucked tequila off my friend's arm. I ignored him. He bought us Jager bombs. I choked it down and ignored him. But then I heard a girl talking shit on my friend and me. I've fantasized about these trashy Jersey Shoreian moments, but truth be told, had never quite found myself in one until that night. Bewildered, I turned and looked at her with a worried expression on your face. ""Is this your sister?"" I asked the toad, because surely he was single and her protective attitude could only be explained by a familial relationship.""Yeahhhh this is my sister. My older sister,"" he drawled. ""I'm your sister. I'm your sister? Go FUCK yourself,"" she said to him. I winced, and she turned to me and warned, ""I swear to god, if you look at me one more time...""At this point, I should have ripped out her earrings and headbutted her, right? Instead, I said, ""Look, we don't want to get into anything. We're seriously here just watching the game."" I left out the part where she should keep her freak on a leash. So weird.Anyway, let's cut to the chase. WE (Boston) WON! All was ecstasy, and an older woman with a hot young guy pressed her face to mine and mumbled, ""Look at my ring; I'm married and I don't know shit about hockey, but this guy next to me is HOT, right?"" Riiight.I took it upon myself to match the joyous/obnoxious celebrations by picking up a stainless steel bar cup and pounding it on the wooden bar. Sounded like a cowbell and left no nicks on the wood. The bartender came by and removed it as soon as I put it down. Another cup appeared. I did it again, and again, he took it away, not chastising me for my jackassed behavior.Closed out my tab. $28, meaning that our four Guinnesses were $7 per, it could've been worse. Walked towards Papa John's screaming ""FORTY YEARS!!!"" because the last time Beantown got a Cup was 1972 with Orr. Some hipsters asked, ""Aoooh, R U for-tee?"" Fuck you, hipsters!! Keep smoking!!Crashing at my friend's in Stuytown, we got cussed out by some dudes in the elevator who had apparently rooted hard for Vancouver. All I said was, ""Did you see the game? So amazing for Boston!"" And the dudes said, ""You're with Boston? FUCK you,"" and exited the scene. Perfect.What a night - thanks, Fitzgerald's.",3,6,4

Updated review","Psshhh (or however you spell that sound.). How dumb was I before? This is clearly a 5 star place.Great prices, great food, best bartenders in the city. Just don't come when it's a baruch student's birthday. It gets very crowded, and they get very weird. One girl drunkenly rubbed up on my male friend. And then apologized to me for touching me.

The bartenders are REALLY friendly and cute to boot (I thought one was sort of cute. He gave me one of my beers on the house!). My friend knew all of them, so they kept coming over to us to make sure we were doing okay and stuff.I came here on Cinco de Mayo. The place was pretty empty, so our group took over the bar area. There are also tables and seating throughout. They also have TVs broadcasting different sporting events.Overall, I had a really great time here. I took this stop on our Cinco de Mayo ""pub crawl"" to relax more and just enjoy the company of our friends.Would definitely come back here if in the area.",,,

He goes to Baruch and was between classes and suggested Fitzgerald's because it so close to campus.When some college friends of mine wanted to meet for some holiday cheer we came here as well.Enjoyed both visits. Good pub food. Beer specials and took advantage of the dinner special on the fish and chips. Food wasn't great, but good, well priced, and promptly served. Friendly staff, nice crowd. It was a great place to catch up with people you care about in a fun casual ambience.",,,1
44,Patricia S.,"New York, NY",56,527,281,3.0,4/10/2012,"It is indeed a mostly quiet average ""Irish"" pub/Sports bar. (Let's admit, Irish pubs in NYC are nearly all Sports bars) The barternders can really be hit or miss - some are rude, some are just friendly enough that it's not annoying. They're pretty flexible about what Sport they play, which is nice. They have good happy hour specials until 8.If you go on the weekend, I find that there is less of a college crowd. Even if a group of students comes in, they're usually in for some shots and then head right back out.For this type of bar, this is my favorite in the area. You'd need to go quite a ways north or a bit south to get to a similar establishment nearby. (Yes, there are a few other pubs, but I find that they are dirty and/or have rude bartenders).",,,

The flat screens are always great for watching sports. And the darts board in the back is a nice way to pass the time while drinking with friends. Unlike other bars I frequent, I really really like the food here. I recommend the chicken Caesar wrap or the waffle fries with cheese. Overall, Fitzgeralds is one of my favorite bars in the city.",,,
47,Cam G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,5.0,8/26/2014,Fitzgerald's is dark and surly and awesome.  The perfect Irish pub. The bartenders are incredibly friendly and almost always hook up a free drink or two if you drink enough.  Great place to watch a game or just kill a few hours.  Have never had the food - but it always looks pretty good.,,,
48,Shea D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",109,547,88,4.0,12/11/2010,"Came in here after the Yelp Snow Ball with Anthony F and his +1 to the ball where we proceeded to order up a round of drinks and some mozzarella sticks. This is pretty much your typical pub with sports on TV, some intimate seating arrangements, and (on a Thursday night) a decently sized crowd.We snagged a table for 2 and made it into a table for 3 when one patron so kindly offered up the seat that was holding his bag (e.g. we asked him if we could have it since we were pretty sure that his bag wouldn't be too offended hanging out on the ground). The waiter was nice, and he was very attentive. He even gave me a thumbs up when I correctly pronounced the name of my beer (a Smithwicks...hint: don't pronounce the ""w"" for starters...).I'm not sure what the prices are like since Anthony F picked up my beer in celebration of my accomplishment last week that I'm not allowed to talk about online (I'm actually dead serious on that one), but I noticed they seem to have a pretty good happy hour deal going and the pub munchies seemed to be decently priced as well.The Smithwicks was nice and smooth, and the mozzarella sticks (while really greasy) were full of artery-clogging goodness. I like this place. I doubt I'll seek it out, but if I'm in this area of town and looking for a place to stop in at, this would be on the list of possibilities.",1,,2
49,Anthony F.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",85,380,130,4.0,12/11/2010,"I have to say, it's rather surprising that this was my first visit to Fitzgerald's Pub (hint: look at my last name's initial) in the nearly 4 years I've lived in NYC! After wrapping up at the Yelp Snow Ball, Shea D., my girlfriend, and I decided we weren't quite ready to head home yet. Knowing 3rd Ave wouldn't let us down, we moseyed on over and found Fitzgeralds! The happy hour had some pretty good specials so we jumped on it. The pub itself isn't very big, but is cozy. We were able to secure a 2-person table which we creatively (stole someone's chair that was being used as a bag holder) made into a 3-top. Our waiter came by before we were even seated and took our orders. 1 Smitchwicks and 2 Sam Adams Winters, please! An order of mozzarella sticks later and we were set. Usually cheesey sticky deliciousness only comes in ""why don't you just starve me"" quantities, but not here! Oh no! We could barely finish them between the three of us! As Shea D. said in her review, I wouldn't necessarily seek this place out, but I would definitely recommend it if in the area and dying for a drink!",1,1,

54,Teshia S.,"Manhattan, NY",74,11,0,3.0,2/14/2012,"My review is highly biased since I go to the college that's literally 30 feet away from this place therefore they get business from me ALL THE TIME. The menu is very American bar foody (my favorite item by far is the potato skins). Service is always friendly. During happy hour, beers and well drinks are practically dirt cheap, around $4 or $5. There are seats for you to sit and enjoy with your friends or you can always lounge at the bar. I love this place just because it's very convenient for me but if you want a first time pub experience, I don't think this would be it.",1,1,2

56,Jeffrey D.,"Manhattan, NY",98,48,1,4.0,8/4/2009,"If I had written this post a year ago, it would easily get a 5 star rating, unfortunately it's not the same as it used to be. The crowd used to be enjoyable, vibrant, colorful, at times actually smart...that's long since faded. The bartenders are by far some of the friendliest and most enjoyable to talk to I have ever come across and am on pretty good terms with all of them. The owner, a sweet old Irish man who doesn't ""take any guff from no one""...didn't even have to make that quote up for comedic value.It's at this bar I first acquired my taste for Killians and I've hardly found a beer I enjoy more. They do have a large variety of beers at Fitz and generally speaking the prices are pretty decent for the general area, with several varieties at $4, like Killians, Miller Lite, Yuengling and a few other rotating ones. After that, unlike other bars I've been to, the prices for every other beer increases to at most $7 (Guinness being the only one at that price).In my four years going to this bar I've sampled many different items off of their menu and have yet to be disappointed. I'd recommend their pastas and burgers over anything else, though a friend swears by their chicken ceaser rap.What attracted me most to the bar over the years though is the fact that they've got a dartboard in the back (partitioned with enough glass to keep everyone safe so long as nobody decides to throw darts at the bar area). They used to have a little arcade game station in the back as well but that's been removed, along with all of my high scores at photo-hunt :-(.To an extent the smaller crowd most nights now makes for a more enjoyable environment when I just want to play some darts and not worry about what random college freshmen is going to come up and try to learn the game. Go on a night of a decently advertised sporting event and it's at full capacity because it's got a TV just about everywhere but the bathroom, so there's obviously the best of both worlds. If you're strolling up 3rd Ave stop by and get a drink, you'll probably meet Connor or Owen and wind up hearing some sort of funny story that you don't have to force yourself to laugh at.",2,1,2
57,Katie K.,"Atlanta, GA",302,170,11,4.0,3/30/2010,"Friendly little pub. My friend, who brought me, used to come here much more often in the past as a younger student. So we came in at around 3am or so on a Thursday night (or maybe it was 2am. I honestly don't remember..). Pretty empty by then, of course, just a few people sitting at the bar. Apparently the bartender has been there for 20+ years, easy going and friendly. From what I remember, we had $5 Yuenglings on draft, plus the bartender hooked us up with a couple of free shots of something... I have no idea what it was; but it tasted good. Comfy bar, seems like a decent place to come get a couple of beers. Oh, plus bathrooms were fairly clean, a plus.",,,

59,Alice V.,"New York, NY",145,112,40,3.0,1/7/2012,"This bar is one of those hang out spots that doesn't ask for that special need of attention or advertisement, it's what you make of it at Fitzgerald's. Bartenders are attentive and the drinks are great. Only flaw about this place is that you may have to wait awhile for seating but it depends what time you're there, so of course friday and saturday nights will be packed but usually I get lucky finding a table here with friends. If that fails, there's nothing wrong standing around by the bar. Anyways, Fitzgeralds is always lively and I will continue to make visits for those chill nights.",,,

They make a mean black and blue too.Come for the darts or just come for the beers with friends. This place has what you look for in a pub. haven't seen any rugrats at the bar, I like the atmosphere when its just Old pub dudes lined at the bar.

64,Nadia N.,"New York, NY",3,77,5,3.0,9/19/2011,"I used to come here a lot. My boyfriend goes to Baruch. It's a college bar, also an Irish pub, brimming with obnoxiously loud, fratty boys. The bartenders are nice, everyone feels like they ""know"" all the bartenders and the bartenders ""know"" them. I try to explain to my boyfriend that it's their job to be nice to you, to pretend to care about your problems. They want to serve you. Overserve you. If you're cool with that, you should go here. The food is good too. Drinks are small.I once heard someone on the 6 train say to his college-aged female friend, ""You've never heard of Fitzgerald's?! WOW. They have like, 'Thirsty Thursdays' and it's just like, soooooooooo cool."" This is what kids who do not have a real college campus do. Idolize the closest bar, effectively making it their frat house or their student lounge. They do homework here, have sex in the bathrooms here, and leave with strangers.I usually prefer to just walk to the East Village and there's plenty more bars with better value and crowds.",,,
65,Victor L.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,1057,14,3.0,4/12/2007,"I've been a few times and have enjoyed immensely the laid back, older crowd, Irish focus, and the clean space. Its a really nice pub to relax and catch up with friends. Sometimes you'll meet an older lady lawyer who's visiting from memphis. Updating my original review, I'd like to say more about the space for those who haven't been.Basically you walk in and it's a two part bar, the bar itself lined up with stools, and a partition with tables on the other side and darts in the back. Be careful when going to the bathroom; the dart lane is kind of in the way, you don't want someone jabbing your ear with a dart just because you had to go to the jon.As well, the drinks range from 4 to 6, and for the kinds of beers they have on tap, it's worth it. You have Smithwick's and Blue Moon. Their pint glasses draw the line for perfect black and tans. I went here again last night and it's one of the first times I've actually seen lots of women in the bar. The music was awful as usual (Limp Bizkit? COME ON MAN) but it was a fairly good crowd. This could be since I've never been on a Thursday night up to this point, but who knows?",2,,1
66,Sorren M.,"London, United Kingdom",6,35,0,5.0,2/15/2009,"You certainly get what you pay for in ""Fitzgeralds"".Drinks are by no means cheap for pub prices and it's almost more expensive than London prices, however if your looking for an authentic Irish/American pub this one is great. There are enough tv screens to catch up on sports and news and the juke box is terrific, it has a great range and there is something there for everyone. The draught beers are not typically Irish however it still has Guiness and Magners, couldn't really ask for more...In terms of ""pub grub"" it does not do as well as the homeland pubs in Ireland and the UK when it comes to traditional dishes... However for those who want to know about eating a decent breakfast, when you get to know the staff a bit better talk to Dennis Sr about an English or Irish fry up!The bar staff are all very friendly and are ""In the know"" when it comes to current affairs and sports so it's a place where you can also have a decent conversation with the barman.Being in Baruch college territory, during the school semester your sure to be surrounded on the weeknights by college kids, but after office hours your sure to see the men in suits.Over all it deserves and recieves 5 stars it's clean, you'll be kept entertained and it's always got a good atmosphere friendly customers, friendly staff definately well worth the visit if your in town.",1,,

The bartenders are familiar with the students and faculty. Prices are definitely kept low for the student budget. Thursday night was always the busiest because most of us didn't have classes on Friday. This was the spot where we celebrated birthdays, end of mid-terms, and end of semesters. The food is not bad either. My only pet peeve is the small size of the place. It can get claustrophobic.",,,1

You can sit and chill with friends and beers at a table, or mingle at the bar and near the dart board.
