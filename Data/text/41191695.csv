0,Kendra P.,"Weston, WI",77,49,39,5.0,8/10/2018,"Cute, good iced latte, sandwich was tasty, friendly service. I would venture back. This place would be perfect if they had a couple outside bistro tables but would still recommend.",,,
1,Grace H.,"Brooklyn, NY",87,711,4373,3.0,4/2/2016,"A neighborhood cafe in the East Village.  Tried their Israeli breakfast this morning.  Decent American portion size.  The chopped salad and the feta cheese is good,  but the scramble eggs taste like egg comes out from a carton rather than fresh egg.  The green tea is also the type you get in a super market - no real taste to it.  The cafe has friendly services and good vibe though. If there is a half star I would have given there 3.5.  Other cafe in the hood serve real good green tea. It can be done.",,,
