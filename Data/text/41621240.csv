You appreciate City Swiggers more and more the longer you're a customer there. The variety in cans and bottles will astound you it's impossible to ever get bored. They have around 999 different beers to take home to choose from and every Friday a new brewery does a free beer tasting from 6pm - 9 pm. They have around 18 different beers on tap from all around the world and there constantly changing the kegs. Pretty much they always have a completely new list of draft beers every time I go, they never repeat the same brand and style twice in a row. Quality and variety at its finest. They always have sour ales and whatever seasonal beer that is going on that time. There are no discounts on the growler prices but that's only because, if abused it would be unfair to all the customers enjoying the beer inside the establishment. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable as well!",

Updated review",92,,"Manhattan, NY",Ryan H.,2,3.0,40,"This place is fantastic except for this one bartender/cashier.Extremely rude. I accidentally sat somewhere I wasn't suppose to and he was very very rude about it. He is not what customer service is suppose to be like. Very unprofessional. He has a beard and wears transition lenses and a blue trucker hat. Avoid when he is there. Very unfriendly. All the other staff members here are fantastic, why can he not follow suit. I sat on a case of unopened still packaged beer. Next time just be like ""hey man, I'd appreciate if you didn't sit there"". I honestly didn't think it was a big deal. He sort of made an unnecessary scene. Whatever I still fuck with this place heavy.",

Need I say more?Beers in a can, beers on tap, beers in a bottle, or in your growler,  beers for every rough day especially on a mundane Monday. I randomly pass through if I'm ever in the area since they carry some of my faves (IPAs mostly) that are not easily found on the shelf of a liquor or convenience store. Build your own 4 packs are the way to go, well as much as you can carry if you ask me, ans fairly priced considering it's UES.PSLove when they have all pumpkin everything in the fall!",9
3,,10/20/2018,0,,"New York, NY",D K.,0,1.0,4,I was a loyal customer for many years. I was so excited when City Swiggers first opened in the neighborhood. I usually go once a week as it is difficult to find beers of that selection on the UES. I will never go back there due to an unfortunate incident over the weekend. It seems as though the yelp reviewer Ryan H. had the same customer service experience as I had (same gentleman). Women should avoid this place if they don't want sexist comments hurled at them.,
4,,8/14/2017,302,,"New York, NY",Allie R.,19,4.0,99,"This place is super cool. There is a small bar (6 seats maybe?) where you can sit and try some of the beers they have on tap - usually around 14. There are tables in the back, but not many so the seating room is limited.The vibe here is very casual. If you like beer and trying new/different beers you should check this place out. You can either order a beer on tap or they will open any of the cans/bottles they have in stock for you. You can also make your own 6-packs or buy beers individually.",1
5,1,11/29/2017,6,2,"New York, NY",Andrew K.,0,1.0,20,"I have been supporting this business since it opened. I often pop in to see if they received anything new because it's on my way home from work. Sometimes I don't buy anything, but I buy something every single week. Not anymore, though.Today the owner Alan told me that he would not sell me a limited bottle of beer ... because I don't buy enough beer from him. This is a terrible way to treat a long-term customer who lives nearby and has always supported the shop. If he didn't want to sell it to me, he should have kept his mouth shut and not even told me it was in stock just to tell me that he would not let me buy it. It was rude and unprofessional and weird AF. It's not the first time I've encountered strange customer service at City Swiggers but it surely will be my last. I probably don't buy as much as I would because I often feel weird vibes whenever I ask the owners about a beer in stock - giving even a minor effort to provide direct customer service is annoying to them. I would also probably buy more if their prices weren't the worst in all of NYC. Their business model is to intentionally gouge on bottles and cans that are even slightly limited (and not hard to find elsewhere.) I'm sure their pricing model is to look for the highest price on Beermenus and add on top of that. Sometimes bottles sit on shelves for months when they sell out quickly elsewhere, because smart customers don't want to get ripped off.Many other people who frequent this place won't find this surprising. Everyone thinks the owners are strange, unfriendly, and weird ... oh, I guess that's a synonym for strange. Get out of a customer service industry if you don't know how to be a person.I know a lot people in NYC who live craft beer and have agreed with everything I've said above. They have also decided to boycott this place. So, I hope it was worth it to not sell me that beer. One more thing: My wife would never join me here because she doesn't drink beer and the wine they serve is horrible and literally spoiled. You don't have to sell wine, but if you do and claim it's an option, make sure it hasn't gone off and maybe make some effort to serve something decent if you're charging a premium price for a glass.",10

7,,7/31/2018,21,,"New York, NY",Geo S.,2,1.0,4,"When I first discovered this place I was very excited but after a few visits my enthusiasm quickly wained. First off their prices are exorbitant, even by Manhattan standards. Secondly, the staff is aloof and unfriendly. Additionally, they're unknowledgeable and seem unwilling to make an effort to help you find what you're looking for at times seeming baffled by your inquiries into fairly well known beers. In a nutshell this is an overpriced beer shop in need of an attitude adjustment. While their beer selection may be vast I'll continue to seek my selections elsewhere.",

The person behind the bar counter was very nice, and the craft beer selection was certainly vast, but I felt a bit of out of place here.I'm big into craft brews -- specifically NC craft beers -- but City Swiggers doesn't have anything from NC. No biggie though.I was just really underwhelmed by this place. It's mostly guys, which is fine, but it makes for an unusual environment. I felt a bit ignored. Nobody offered to help, it was a little clique-y. I may be back but not my first choice.",1

I only spent 10-15 minutes here, on the way home picking up a few bottles, but it's definitely somewhere I want to go back to. The variety of brews is quite expansive, with many different types of beers, bottles and cans, and all relatively inexpensive. They also have a ""create your own 6-pack,"" which would be fun to try with all the different varieties. They also sell growlers and beer on tap. The concept is cool - that you can purchase cans or bottles to go, or you can purchase some to try and grab a seat in the back area. Very cool, relaxed vibe. A nice place to grab drinks with a friend or two in a relatively quiet bar-like environment and atmosphere, without the crowd or loudness of a bar.",

Whenever there are flowing taps and flights available, it can't be all that bad.

If only Sublime knew about this place they may have written a song called ""400 Brews to Freedom"". Hundreds of different craft brews from the world over including a beer bar filling pints and growlers alike from an ever-evolving draft menu at prices unfit (ie inexpensive) for the UES make this a salvation from your typical liquor store blues. They even cater to the season, seeing as how it was early September when I came (thanks to a hat-tip from Phil H.) they carried an enormous selection of pumpkin brews! Seriously, anything you can imagine and more. It's like walking through an orange-ish vortex into an Alice In Wonderland-type acid induced euphoric world where buildings are made of delicious booze.

Try the Kopparberg pear cider for ~$3-4All the Belgian ales you could want too.Of course they rotate their selection, so the one time I was there, they actually did not have Dogfish 90 minute in stock but they did have pretty much everything else.

The draft beer list isn't extensive but the options are fairly diverse, with a few fridges to choose from as well.

22,,11/20/2015,389,,"Belmont, MA",Jeff D.,55,4.0,709,"A very cool bottle shop/tap room that isn't too far from our normal base of operations in the UES.  Yeah it's a bit pricy, but it's New York.  It's expected.  I didn't load up too much.  I'd done that at OEC in Oxford CT on the way down.  But I did see two forelorn cases of Westbook Gose sitting on the floor all alone.  So I saved a six-pack from it's lonely existence.  It will be much more happy in my belly (update from when I started this review in June....the Gose was much happier in my belly)I also gained a small window into the types of people who buy beer there, both good and bad.  All the patrons were cool, enjoying their beers, asking questions.  The beer I chose on tap was from Other Half Brewing in Brooklyn, one of their brett-based sour ales.  I was asked if I knew this was a sour, I told them I knew exactly what it was and throughly enjoyed it. I was asked the same thing while checking out with the Westbrook by a different employee.  I asked him if this was an ongoing problem and he laughed that it was, that a lot of people don't know a thing about sour beers (or that they even exist.)  We started chatting and it turns out his brother runs Enlightenment Ales (now on hiatus as he does a guest brewing gig in Denmark.)  Small world, it pays to be friendly :)",
23,,4/5/2016,366,,"New York, NY",Dan L.,6,1.0,40,"I've been here a few times and although they have a decent selection, my two biggest gripes about this place is the price gouging on specific bottles and lack of customer service on the phone.As other Yelpers have noted, they markup bottles (sometimes over 100%) which is ridiculous. I've personally spoken to other beer stores that refuse to partake in this practice.When calling in to ask about the availability of a specific, hard to find beer (since it's being released at other beer stores in the area), I was greeted with a rude ""I don't know. We don't answer beer geeks over the phone. I can't help you. Maybe call back at 1pm and you'll talk to someone nicer than me."" Fair enough, so I call back after 1pm and was received the same ""I don't know. I can't help you.""You're a beer store. Your main clients are beer drinkers who know more than your average Joe and expect knowledgeable responses. I mean this in the nicest way possible, GYST.",5

The staff there is nice and friendly even during some pretty hectic times (BCS raffle) and honestly, never had a bad experience.

I've swung by City Swiggers many times to pick up a couple of bottles to go, and recently took the time to sit and have a couple of pints which was even better. For starters, their beer selection (whether bottled or on draught) is bar none (especially in the Upper East Side) and the friendly, approachable neighborhood vibe here makes it the awesome place that it is.Whether you're a seasoned pro when it comes to beer, or a newbie, there's something for you at City Swiggers. The selection includes lots of old stand-by's and even more unique, lesser seen brews for when you're feeling adventurous. Sitting in for a couple of pints was a real treat. There's a chalkboard listing the 14 beers on tap (all available to taste before you buy, by the glass or growler) and it's a great spot to while away an hour or two and chat up some fellow beer lovers (just what I did). They also have those cute tasting paddles if you want to try more than one! The staff here are great - The bartender John knows so much about beer and is happy to share his knowledge. Chatty, friendly and informed, which definitely adds to the experience.

The folk who frequent this bar are down to earth, fun and come from every age group and every walk of life. The people at this bar are always happy to include you in conversations if you want, but won't bother you if you're just doing your own thing. Without a doubt, it can be your neighborhood Cheers if you want it to be.Now, for city swiggers as a bar, bottle shop, and growler dispensary. This place is FULL of total beer nerds - both behind the counter and the patrons who shop/drink here. The bar tenders are very knowledgable and well versed in anything you need to know about their selection or just beer in general. The taps rotate constantly, and when this place has something special up, you better get there before the rest of the upper east side gets to it. There is always a range of beers (and ciders) here and they tend to keep beer types associated with a tap. Example - number 7 is always an IPA. They are always happy to give you sip tastes if you are unsure about a selection and help you figure out what you'd like. Beers price and pour size corresponds to ABV, cost of the keg, and how special it is. They also pour growlers - you can bring your own or purchase theirs - 32oz, 64oz, and 64oz soft shell. They also have an extensive rotating bottle/can selection for you to purchase for home or enjoy in the store (there is a corking fee - $2 I think). There is a range of seating options for whatever group you bring. A huge front table for standing and talking, the bar itself, 2 seater bar-top tables, and several normal tables. You can bring kids, games, food, basically whatever you want for as long as you want so long as you are drinking beers. For kids, they do have a shelf of non-alcoholic sodas and whatnot. Last thing is that they do have snack foods - hot pretzels ($2), vegan empanadas ($3 - and don't knock em till you try em), some chips, and sometimes some nuts.",

They have two beers on happy hour during the week from 4:00pm-7:00pm that are $5 instead of $7. People say the place is pricey, but I expect to pay more for craft beer. I didn't think their pricing was unreasonable. There is a $10 minimum for credit/debit cards. They close your tab out via iPad. So if you are wary of that, keep that in mind.",1

My first time they had a local micro brewing company from upstate come and do a tasting. First time trying an agave aged brew. As an aspiring beer connoisseur, I always find something new every time I go there. They have 14 different beers on tap for people to try.

Updated review",13,,"Manhattan, NY",Kristin M.,5,3.0,35,"I used to LOVE this place. The last time I went I was so confused where all the ciders I enjoyed went and was informed that the owner decided to switch to more 'upscale' beers and ciders and we all know why (a bigger profit - which I can respect). But I am so sad because all the ciders I loved don't fit that category. They have officially lost me as a customer due to the fact that they no longer carry any of the ciders that I enjoy. This past summer I literally went there EVERY week to get the CiderBoys Peach Cider and would buy as many as I could, but they are now ""too good"" for that. Also.. They sell Lindemans Kriek Lambic's for WAY more than any other location in UES and it is a smaller bottle. So if you are looking for Lambic you can get the LARGER sized one for the SAME price at Whole Foods. (I think they sell the 12 oz one when you can get the 25 oz one for the SAME price a few blocks away). That too me is pretty much a robbery.Anyways - if you are wanting to buy some over priced drinks THIS IS YOUR PLACE. And if you are looking for ciders that are reasonably priced and taste good head to Whole Foods their selection is amazing and they don't have a crazy mark up.I want to include a positive though - the wife of the owner is the SWEETEST lady ever.",1

Absolutely worth it just to come browse that. Their drafts are also a good variety, and all are $7 which is really nice. The ambiance is really laid back but also a cool/hip kind of vibe. There are sometimes people in the back working on laptops and stuff almost like a cafe, but also people around the bar socializing, so it's a really cool spot for whatever you're looking for.Definitely come by here if you're a craft beer fan.

Shelves upon shelves of craft style beers, ciders, and hard to find imports are all on hand to try out and enjoy. In fact, when asking the owner how many they actually carry he replied ""close to 500"". Stouts, porters, ales, high alcohol content - ohhhh myyyyy!!!I shed a tear, and hugged him.Oh, who am I kidding? I just love to drink good beer being the lush that I am! City Swiggers is a godsend that has taken up residence in Yorkville / UES. It's an area that desperately needs more unique shops such as this, and that are slowly but surely popping up in once empty store fronts that dot the area. No more heading downtown below 14th street or to Brooklyn to find a quality beer retailer, as this location fulfills all beer consumption needs. It makes perfect sense for City Swiggers to put up shop here, as this area is known as one of the most densely populated residential parts of the city. 86th Street has seen a boom in name brand retail stores open recently, and when the 2nd Ave subway is finally finished will end up bringing in even more businesses and shoppers this way.I could see they are already having some success judging by the amount of people coming in and purchasing all types of beers while I was there. Up front there is a large communal wooden tasting table surrounded on one side by a large shelving unit stocked full with amazing craft beers, and on the other side refrigerated units filled to the brim with cold tasty goodness. People were milling all about choosing beers to take home, some grabbing a cold brew to consume there, and others looking to sample one of the 14 beers on tap. Yes, 14 craft beers on tap that will rotate every few weeks, all around $7 a pint. Very eclectic selection to choose from, and free tastings if you want to check out your palate before choosing one. The husband and wife owners were very nice and chatted with me for quite a while, and also let me try a few before I settled on a terrific glass of Innis & Gunn Rum Cask. Delicious!She also told me the demand has been so overwhelming that they are having trouble keeping some of the beers in stock. That is a good problem as it shows people have found out about this great store and are shopping there. As they are fairly new some kinks need to be worked out, but that is expected. Be patient and support these great local businesses.They also have growlers to purchase at $5 deposit for the bottle and then cost is determined by what beer you fill it up with. So much more convenient than schlepping downtown to pick up and refill a growler, and worth the cost for convenience. I did have a chance to notice and compare individual bottle prices on the craft beers and found them to be quite fair, if even pretty inexpensive overall. The cider and hard to find import section in the back of the store has some really keen selections, and is pretty impressive as many I had never seen before.The store itself is well lit, has a nice relaxed retail vibe, and also has a decent amount of seating/ tables to sit at and enjoy your beer purchase. They need to put on some background music at a low level though, but that is a minor flaw. This is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood, and I hope they are around for a long time. Go Yorkville!

I went for a flight, which set me back $10 and was, in retrospect, a wise choice, as the four beers I picked out ranged from mediocre to fairly good. I enjoy places that offer flights as I'd rather spend a little more to find out that a certain beer isn't to my liking, versus having to go forth and drink a whole pint.all kinds of beers are on hand here for you to drink there, or take home. I like the whole ""make your own 6-pack"" concept!they have fridges with chilled bottles for you to drink there. aye, there's the rub: there's an ""uncorking"" fee to drink bottles in-house...but I don't recall seeing this posted anywhere. perhaps it was, and I wasn't paying attention - but I was glad I picked a beer that was stickered as less than 2 bucks, as it ended up costing me 6 and change. I don't have a problem with the fee per se, just the lack of documentation regarding this. ah well, the Flying Dog hefeweizen was still delicious!it seems to get packed here on Saturday afternoons. they have an awful lot of 2-seat tables but could use more and larger tables. then again, this is Manhattan.they have a Kulmbacher brew on tap, which is pretty freaking amazing.

46,,2/9/2014,24,,"Brooklyn, NY",Diana K.,1,4.0,152,"Heard about this place from a friend who regularly cleans them out of Crabbie's ginger beer. First impression, the place is very stark and the beers don't seem to be well organized. They sell cold and warm in the front, with bottles on the wall and cans kind of hidden under a central table. The table is great to put down your picks and organize them into the six-pack carriers they provide. All imports and ciders are on a shelf in the back, past the bar and table seating and it isn't immediately noticeable. After taking my time to browse through it all, I was really impressed at the selection. The beers are grouped by brewery, and I found a lot of single bottles on the shelf or popular brews missing, but it only forced me to explore other beers I might not pick up. I ended up with a bunch of Crabbie's original, a few Evil Twins, an Abita grapefruit that I didn't know existed, a few Belgian imports, and the piece de resistance... a Brooklyn Wild Streak. Just introduced out of Brooklyn Brewery, it's a golden ale that is aged in oak bourbon barrels and sold in a gorgeous champagne-corked bottle. I could not be more thrilled. As I checked out, the cashier/bartender was super helpful and advised me to wait a bit to enjoy the Wild Streak. He said it benefits from a little more age and to wait a few months to a year to crack her open.While the staff seems super knowledgeable, no one is really on hand to help tell you more about some of the obscure beers, or offer you a suggestion based on what you've already picked. The bar had a couple of interesting beers on tap, and its great that they do flights. The shelves aren't labelled so you just have to scan the bottles to see what's what. This is not so much a bar as it is a beer library or alcoholic cafe. I would come here to work on projects or do my taxes.",2

49,,8/21/2015,12,,"Riverdale, NY",Vittorio B.,1,3.0,51,"I drink a lot of imported beer (mainly ales from Belgium) and a few Hefeweizen beers from Germany, and have been looking for a solid beer place aside from the beer store that Whole Foods has down by the Bowery.  This Upper East Side location is not bad, and is relatively close to me coming down from Riverdale.  I feel as if the store is smaller in person than I expected it to be based on the online photos, but given the space constraints, the selection was not too bad.  The price point isn't terrible either on some beers, but could be better overall. I purchased a few bottles of Piraat which was slightly more expensive than what I usually pay, but given the location, I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised. For whatever reason, outside of a few Whole Foods locations, I have had a really hard time finding the aforementioned beer.  I would come back here again, but I was actually expecting more selection than what was available, along with a variety in terms of beer size availability.  I know that certain brands are generally not sold in large sizes because of the high price point (i.e. Rochefort 10 comes to mind), but it would be nice to have the option with the beers that are available in large sizes as opposed to the sizes that are suitable for one person. For example, they had Scaldis and Gulden Draak in the small sizes, and I've purchased the options that they had in the large size at other locations.  The only positive is that those small sizes allow you to try out other beers, but the negative is that it can be quite expensive.  Some of the beers that I usually drink at home had price points here that were almost as much as what I would pay for these beers when I'm out drinking at my local spots.  Drinking at home is supposed to be cheaper than going to a bar. Perhaps they should look at some of the price points that they have as I can see certain customers being deterred by them, even folks like myself who are willing to shell out more for hard to find imports.It would also be great to have more options refrigerated.  It was quite hot on the day that I came and having to go home and get beer cold that you've paid quite a bit for already is not exactly what I would prefer to have to do, as there's only a small selection that is refrigerated, and very few imports kept cold.",1

I'm not big on beer but the two shelves of cider at the back made me very, very happy!

There are several tables in the back, should you not be able to wait to try the brews at home. They do have a corking fee - $4 for beer, $2 for cider- if you want to try them in store, though.

Updated review",66,,"New York, NY",Ben C.,0,5.0,128,"Updating my review from 12/3/2011.This place is beer nirvana. Every time I take someone here, they always say ""why didn't you tell me about this place earlier? People seem to enjoy making their own 6 pack of craft beer. (Especially fun if you're going to Poke for some delicious BYOB sushi)*They have a 5-7 happy hour*If you make an individual 6 pack, it can often be cheaper than buying a 6 pack of whatever at the local bodega. So if you like beer, why would you not go there?*There's really nothing comparable beer buying wise in the area.So if you are looking to buy some craft beer, and are in the area, this is hands down the place to go. And there's some rare stuff here, too, so it's often worth the trek from someplace far.As for a place to drink craft beer, it's great for a beer or two. It's quiet, calm and fun. Just not a lot going on and if you want good craft beer + music and lively crowds, you're way better served at the Pony Bar on 74th and 1st (another great UES craft beer place).I'm glad this place is in the area.",

She then proceeded to introduce me to the growler. $5 for a keep-it-yourself glass jug (forget the measurements) but basically, you fill that bad boy up with any of the 14 beer they have on tap (first tap is always a cider). I wanted to ask her if I could bring a milk bottle instead but was afraid she'd kick me out. Next time.While ringing me up, she went through each bottle and I told her they were all the same. She then looked at me and told me that I could mix and match with whatever. Ooooooh. I proceeded to split 2 6-ers into 4 3-ers (does that make sense?). Now I get to try more (Or get drunk with variety?). And I do have to address one of the haters that I read recently: if you found a bottle sold here that you can get cheaper in Jerz, go.

Updated review",6,,"New York, NY",Nick S.,0,3.0,53,"Update: corking fee is $4 per bottle. Meaning if you want to try something from their bottled selection you may end up paying much more than the actual bottle price if you want to just stay at CS and drink it. Last week we were going to get 5 different bottles to try them, and they were going to wave that fee for 2 of the bottles we were going to get. That's great, but considering that total purchase was around $15 we would be charged additional $12 just to stay there ?  This kind of defeats the purpose of having low bottle prices, since we get charged about $30 _after_ discount.I kept the 3 stars, but this is not cool, guys",2
85,1,1/25/2012,76,1,"New York, NY",Steven S.,133,5.0,353,"As a business, City Swiggers has a low-key personality. This is an accomplishment in the brash, confident world of craft beer, only lately coming out of its extended adolescence. There's no hipster pretension here, no attempt at up-selling the ""beer concept,"" and little attempt to force the relation of the beer's crafted-ness to other hand-crafted, faux-rustic food items. What I found when I entered was a quiet, spacious, friendly store. I went during the day and basically had the whole place to myself. The chatty lady behind the counter couldn't have been more informative or helpful and offered tastes of whatever I wanted from the many taps. She certainly wasn't judgmental about someone drinking in the middle of the day, either!The Upper East Side seemed like an unusual choice of locations for a trend that seems comfortable living almost entirely below 14th Street, but, according to the nice chatty lady, they frequently run out of stock. Come Super Bowl weekend, she admonished me, the place would be packed and the shelves cleared. I'm glad they're getting lots of business, because I live just on the other side of the park and hate having to trek to Whole Foods or the East Village just to buy my fancy beer. If I can keep coming here and pick up some Shake Shack en route, I'm cool with that.The best part of the store, and what provisionally earns them a fifth star from me, is their impressive selection of imports. There are other stores that carry more than a few of these, but City Swiggers has a large selection that has clearly had some curation, so you're not just looking at Eastern Slovakia's version of internationalager.Please open a branch on the UWS! I'm starting to hate the M86. Oh well, I guess it's a good thing to have to walk it off after a few tasting rounds.",2

Sure enough, he called a few days later to let us know that a case had just come in.In addition, my bf is always very impressed with their selection. We also both dig the combination bar/retail store thing they've got going on, and the fact that they always have one hard cider on tap for non-beer-drinkers like me is a double plus. It's just a great neighborhood spot to grab a beer/cider, sit down and drink it without a lot of hassle and then buy some more to take home.

It's sometimes hard to find a place where there's a large selection of beer that you can create your own 6-pack so in that respect this place is gold. Most of their beers (I hear about 500 varieties) are standard 12 ouncers so you don't have to worry about every bottle being as expensive as most of the larger bottles (which they do have plenty of). Some of their beer is on shelves but a lot of it is in a fridge. Prices aren't a rip off but they aren't a bargain either. If you're a beer connoisseur the bar is a great place to try a rotating list of micro brews in either a flight or a full pint.

They have a bar and some tables toward the back of the store and rotating beers on tap priced at the $7 mark. I've been a few times, on the most recent instance I asked for some guidance with some milk stouts and the knowledge displayed and recommendations were excellent. It's a shame given all this that I overheard some of the surly telephone banter directed at some in-calling customers and comments about them post-call. Apparently the County Bourbon is quite popular but they don't have any and have no idea when it's coming in. So don't dare call in and have the temerity to ask for it. Seriously, bleating on about the supposed ignorance or stupidity of potential customers after you speak to them on the phone within an earshot of patrons is not a great idea...you know, they are trying to buy shit from you...Apart from the needless rudeness and stream of profanities this place is worth a visit if you are nearby, like craft beer and want a decent selection.",1
93,,5/22/2013,75,1,"Manhattan, NY",Bill B.,0,2.0,103,"I was super stoked when this place opened last year and had high hopes of there finally being a decent craft beer store on the UES. I held off reviewing it until now in order to give them a chance to grow into the business. Unfortunately, that has not happened and almost unbelievably, things seem to have gotten worse.First and foremost, their beer selection: it's decent, with a nice stock of the standard craft beer lines. They are lacking on some of the more random or esoteric breweries, and their general stock seems to rarely rotate. Also, their seasonal selections are usually pretty poor. If it's spring, I'm looking for a nice variety of saisons; in winter, I want some winter ales, stouts, etc. They have some, but not many. Their beer lines are a bit better in terms of selection, but the price can become almost prohibitive.That brings me to the next point of price. I don't mind paying a bit more for good beer, and in all fairness their bottles are generally pretty fairly priced. But for some reason, their growler refills are obscenely expensive. Charging $16+ for large growler refill is a bit much, especially when a six pack of the same beer tends to go for less.The biggest downfall of City Swiggers, however, is their staff. Holy smokes, they run the gamut from inept to indifferent to flat out rude and make what should be pleasant shopping experience into one where I literally am forced to ask myself if it's worth putting up with to get some good craft beer. In the beginning they just seemed like they didn't know what they were doing. You'd have the poor lady behind the counter trying vainly to poor a decent growler or fill a pint of beer then spending five minutes trying to figure out how to ring it up. This process has improved slightly, but I still have never, ever been able to get checked out of there in less than ten minutes. It's a painful process, as the person behind the register tries to both sell growlers, poor beers, and ring up customers. All without any notion of multitasking. I could deal with the lines though if the people were at least somewhat helpful or even begrudgingly friendly. Instead, they seem unwilling to provide even the slightest advice or recommendation, scoff at any inquiries for beers they don't carry, and refuse to offer any alternative suggestions. I've seen people wander aimlessly through their small storefront, clearly clueless at what to buy, with none of the staff even feigning any interest in helping them. YOU RUN A CRAFT BEER STORE. NOT EVERYONE KNOWS AS MUCH ABOUT BEER AS YOU. Rather than looking down at your (potential) clientele, why not offer a helping hand? It's beer dork elitism at it's finest here, and it makes me hesitant to ever go there. I don't need to be judged or worse, ignored, while attempting to buy some beer.If only City Swiggers could employ a staff that was truly passionate and knowledgeable about the product they sell, this place could become a real gem and regular hangout. Instead, I'll stop by randomly to get a couple of beers to go, but you won't ever find me at one of their beer events or hanging out at their bar. I'll save that for Pony Bar or any of the other of dozens of craft beer bars all around the city.",5

So you will come back just to have a glass of beer in the beer store? The set up is pretty confusing to me. Also, the woman serving the beer was confused.

There's a bar in the middle of the store with 8 drafts that you can drink there or have them fill up a growler for you. The prices are higher than similar stores in other 'hoods and they'll charge quite a bit of a markup for rare brews, but I'd rather pay the premium than take an hour+ roundtrip trip to the LES or BK. It's definitely not a destination beer store, but it's great for people that live in the area. I can see myself coming here a lot in the summer to grab rations for nice days in Central Park.",

The staff was really friendly and it seemed like everyone there was drinking (including the staff!) and having a good time.

And in the back the imports, probably 200.

Then to get a rude response from the owner that I should of just gotten bottled beer after waiting 20 minutes to fill my growler because there was too much froth in their tap. Wtf? There should of been at least an apology for the long wait or some sort of discount since they said I had to drink it right away. Nope, nothing. So yesterday I gave it probably the third chance to get a kid who was too busy texting to answer any of my questions. I asked for a light and not too bitter beer and he gave me the opposite and went back to texting. I walked out.

147,,12/3/2011,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Joan H.,0,4.0,15,"Whoa on the super vindictive Pearl Jam lover. City Swiggers is a great idea in a neighborhood virtually void of good bottle shops. It is almost necessary to point out how one person, unhappy with their opportunity to buy a large quantity of a beer (a likely mediocre beer), has generated numerous yelp accounts to generate as many one star reviews as possible. All I can say is calm down. Let's be honest: this self-proclaimed beer lover needs to find a better beer to get all worked up about. Every time I've gone to City Swiggers there have been many other great beer choices and yes, while it seems disorganized at times, give this store a chance to figure everything out. As a real dedicated beer lover, it's hard to stomach so many proclaimed beer lovers (or just one person with a lot of free time and fake yelp accounts) getting so angry about their inability to buy numerous bottles of a beer that is panned on most beer review websites. Let's be honest, you don't care about the liquid, you care about the label. I agree with not marking the beer up if people want more of it. But if people are getting so worked up about their inability to buy more than two bottles, who's really to blame here? Both parties are guilty of handling the situation the wrong way. Beer stores throughout the city limit special beer releases (Founders CBS anyone?) and it's really ridiculous to get so worked up about it. Don't gouge, but what is up with getting so upset about it? If Whole Foods told you you could only buy one bottle, would you bitch the clerk out and tell them its wrong? No, you wouldn't because that's how high demand beers get distributed in a city of ravenous beer consumers. It's common business practice with any low quantity, super-hyped, highly demanded beers. I agree, don't gouge to discourage those people from buying the beer because they want more then they are allotted, but how do you prevent those people from abusing the system? As someone who is hoping this store will get it all together and stay in the neighborhood, this review has become kind of a rant but someone has to say it. It takes balls and faith in the UES crowd to open a bottle shop and tasting room in this neighborhood. Id be scared of entitled wanna-be's, who don't know what to complain about next, giving me a hard time, which is what's happening here. I think you should contact Eddie Vedder about this gross misconduct.",1
