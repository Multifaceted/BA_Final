0,Joy N.,"New York, NY",1,39,32,4.0,10/27/2018,"Top notch high-end bar in midtown that won't make you gauge your eyes out from the swarm of pretentious crowds . The decor is stunning and the views are to die for (sweeping views of the Empire State Building, Times Square, etc.) The music is also super well curated 90s R&B sounds (shout out to Erika The DJ). The cocktails are also good--not incredible for the price that it is being offered for, but solid nonetheless. Food was surprisingly good and all within the $10-$20 range. This place is really a go-to for anyone trying to impress people from out of town, or corporate events--my only gripes are that the bartenders are a little slow and aren't entirely attentive and if you don't reserve in advance, you'll be hopping around trying to find a corner to stand by",4,1,1
1,Jonghan L.,"Manhattan, NY",232,85,244,4.0,10/18/2018,"INCREDIBLE view of Midtown Manhattan at the Skylark - Swanky, classy, and definitely good vibes is what you'll get at the Skylark. Came here the day before my birthday for ""pre-birthday"" drinks with a group of four friends. We had a table reserved so we were quickly seated. We each ordered an assortment of cocktails from their menu. Total bill came around ~$144 tax and tip excluded. AMBIANCE:Very classy establishment! Music on the rooftop was playing more retro pop songs such as MJ and Prince - not too loud and definitely a great place to impress. The Skylark is composed of multiple floors - the rooftop imo had the best ambiance as you get the best views from it. The indoor seating places were nice as well, as the music won't be as loud. There's also a pool table there! My group of friends definitely took advantaged of that. Crowd was definitely more of the urban professionals and people there were pretty well dressed up. Smart casual at the minimum if you don't want to stand out like a sore thumb here. PROS:Drinks are definitely well crafted and made! We ordered about 8 cocktails total for four guys. The Skylark is their signature cocktail and is served in a martini glass - definitely a must get as its incredibly refreshing with the gin, curacao and vodka combination with lemon juice in it. My other friends got the Apple Cider mojito and it tasted incredibly crisp and strong - definitely was their favorite drinks.CONS:I ordered an Old Fashioned with maker's mark - my old fashioned was surprisingly watered down. Also, it wasn't too sweet so the bitters from the Old Fashioned definitely took over and coupled that with whiskey made it rather hard to swallow (despite being watered down). Also beware these cocktails aren't that cheap - at $18 a pop they're definitely pushing the more expensive side in Manhattan. Something to be aware of if you do come here. OVERALL:Highly recommend the Skylark for an incredible view of Manhattan! Drinks were decently prepared, although there were a few I would avoid getting here for personal preferences. The ambiance here is definitely suitable if you want to take someone here on a special date.",2,1,2
2,Juan T.,"Manhattan, NY",323,469,536,5.0,9/20/2018,"THE BEST ROOFTOP BAR IN NYCHands down the best rooftop in NYC. From the entrance that looks like an old factory/building with dark corners until you get to the elevator at the end of this enchanted entrance. When you get up to the top, you are also greeted by a slew of great people that show you where to go. The two floors are amazing from my 6+ times there i have not experienced any downside to service. Prices are high but there has to be a way to filter people.Beers start at $9 and mixed cocktails at $14. Food is a bit more for simple fare. We ordered the Guac with chips and everyone on the table said ""this is one of the top ones we had"". The also ordered the Mac-n-cheese, and it was also delish.Again, i stop here for drink and a cool night out.Great for dates and to show off what NYC is all about. Place is clean, affordable and very stylish.The views are amazing, you can see all major structures of NYC. Proximity to Times SQ, Penn Station and Port Authority make this roof a gem. PS: if you have no manners, please dont go. Keep your sh1t home. Lets keep this place classy and away from the tourist groups.",5,,

My best friend's birthday was this past Sunday, so we decided to start the party off strong with a reservation on Skylark's rooftop that Saturday night.I was pleasantly surprised by the Skylark. There's a lot of rooftop bars in NYC - I think the Skylark has a great combination of ambience if you're hanging out with friends. The view was great, the energy/music was really uplifting, and the drinks were good. On our way out, we spotted a pool table along with a lounge which would be a great date spot.Overall, I highly recommend the Skylark. If you're getting drinks, you can't go wrong here or at Mr. Purple.",2,,
4,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,5.0,7/21/2018,"I made a 430pm reservation for 4 people on opentable for Friday two days beforehand. There is a business casual dress code, but I think they mostly care about sandals, shorts, gym shoes. Bouncer is at the ground floor and it's their discretion if you meet the dress code. We went right when they opened so it seemed slightly more casual. I ordered their signature drink, The Skylark, which is a martini with both gin and vodka. It's on the sweeter side from the Curaçao liquer and brandied cherry. There is a view of both the Empire State Building and the NYE ball drop. However, I mostly liked this place for the ambiance and the comfy leather couches. Definitely recommend checking out this rooftop! It's one the classier, upscale rooftops I've been to. Make sure to make a reservation, otherwise you'll end up at open rooftop that becomes extremely crowded. With the reservation, you still have the option of going upstairs so it's pretty flexible.",8,3,4

This rooftop has breathtaking 360 views of NYC partnered with great bites and beverages that will make you want to come back for more.The guacamole and macaroni bites are delish. I enjoyed a frozen rose on what was truly one of the hottest days of the year so far. If you are on the roof be warned there is little shade! There are great spaces to host events at the Skylark too! From intimate dining spaces of 12 to larger crowds of 200. This space is great for dates and meetings with coworkers/clients or family! Enjoy!,,,1

When I went with my friend, another company had reserved about 3/4 of the rooftop for a private event so the outdoor space was limited. Classic rooftop bar with expensive drinks and midtown views.

7,Charles B.,"New York, NY",117,104,126,1.0,7/27/2018,"Skylark - really great ambiance, however, the people who work here need an attitude adjustment.I came here with a few friends that were here visiting me in NYC. I brought them to Skylark because I had been here once before and really enjoyed the views.It was about 95° outside and my friends and I had nice shorts on, with a button down short sleeved shirt... (what else does one wear when it's hotter than hell itself) As we approached the doorman he began to give us a lecture on how ""the Skylark is an upscale place and shorts are not allowed, however I will make an exception."" Mind you I watched two other girls walk in with the highest cutoff shorts that were all ripped up (double standards much?!) This place is just asking for a lawsuit for their practices of picking and choosing who they let in(this is NYC) The drinks are pretty average here and the food is okay; definitely nothing to write home about.My husband and I will not be returning to Skylark. I never go anywhere where I do not feel welcomed. Thanks for a crappy experience.",8,1,

Took a look on yelp & because of the good reviews we figured why not give it a try. We made our way upstairs ahh not really sure why this place has such great reviews? The rooftop area is not very big & kinda narrow views are not terrible but only to one side where u get a view of the water the rest u are staring at buildings. Most tables seemed to have ""reserved"" signs on them pretty annoying since there really isn't much room to stand. Aside from the outrageous drink prices & no happy hour specials the worse was trying to get a drink from the bartender no real order here people are just all up in the window area 15 minutes later we had yet to be acknowledged let alone had a drink! Needless to say we didn't last long & left with no drink & completely irritated.  only gave it the 2 stars for the ok views it is NYC after all so u take what U can get when it comes to decent views.",11,4,4

11,Phoebe W.,"New York, NY",548,323,803,5.0,7/10/2018,"The most fantastic rooftop I've been to in NYC. The views of the city are unparalleled, and it's literally the only bar I've been to all summer where I've been able to find seating. I'm almost hesitant to write this review because I don't want word to spread! Prices are on par with the rest of Manhattan, and the food and cocktails are all delicious and well-made.My friend and I ordered the chips & guacamole (that come with the most fantastic plantain chips), the fried green tomato & crab stack, the pork belly steamed lotus buns, and both the sweet potato and regular fries. All the food was good though on the pricier end (as all rooftops are), so I'd recommend eating beforehand and maybe ordering a side of their fries (they are perfection). I was here on a Wednesday summer evening, the only time their rooftop special frose drinks are offered (the ones that Insider food has made so famous). I got the Frose Your Way with the edible flowers and tried my friend's Frose Colada. Both were amazing though I'd recommend the former more. I also had the Kiwi & Hemp mojito and quite honestly think it's on my list of Top 3 drinks ever. AMAZING. It had hints of mint and the lime paired so well with the kiwi but the whole thing wasn't saccharinely sweet like so many cocktails are. Overall had a very positive experience here -- the waitstaff also went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable even though there were quite a few people there, especially as the night went on. The space is rare for Midtown and New York in general and is great for bringing a group of friends or colleagues. Can't wait to return!",1,1,1

Ill post the videos and pics.Drinks prices are the same as any rooftop but the series was a bit slow. Take like forever to get your drink.,4,,

They also have private space that is open to everyone in the lounge on a first come first serve basis unless it's reserved. The private space is called the living room. This is not a casual place, so do not wear sneakers or jeans or t-shirts. Come dress to impress. I will be coming back. A great place to watch fireworks or New Years Eve.",1,,

Last Wednesday evening, I went to The Skylark and it wasn't exactly what I thought it'd be. Not too much to write home about, though, the service was better than any other rooftop place I've been to in the city. Great drinks, of course. But the bartenders, literally, cannot be bothered. Though, they can make one hell of a dirty martini! Kudos!!There are a lot of couches and tables, for reservations only. And a few two-person tables along the sides of the walls. It was pouring the night we went, but the view of the city was still great. The bathrooms were spotless and the bathroom attendant is super friendly, he's truly a sweetheart!

I'm definitely going to time my arrival for slightly earlier in the evening to get hold of a nice table on the rooftop. Cocktails were good but on the pricier side at $18 + tip. Intriguing way to the top.. at one point the better half actually mumbled, ""are we in the right place?""! Walk through a bare hallway after getting past the intimidating gate keeper, get redirected to elevators by a suited up man behind a podium, get to the 30th floor, walk down a corridor, get pointed up a stairway by another suit, reach a hostess desk with 3 women, who finally ask - ""bar or lounge?"" And then again point you up 2 steep flights of steps. But then you burst out triumphant onto the rooftop, right next to the bar and all's good! ;-)",1,,

Yes it's a rooftop bar in Times Square and somewhat touristy, but the interior and decor are absolutely gorgeous and the drinks and bites are delicious. They change the bites menu from time to time as well. If it's not too warm, go hang on the roof.

19,Chris V.,"Albany, NY",24,109,28,5.0,4/14/2018,Loved it.  What a cool and fun space.  Nobody was playing pool when we got their so we jumped on that until another group wanted their turn.  It was mostly a younger than us (50's) crowd but we didn't feel out of place.  Cocktails were well done - very pricey but what I expected to cover the cost of the stunning views.,1,,1

Service was excellent , food was very good, interesting menu/ vegetarian options, and drinks were generous and good  selection!  There are two communal tables that you can go to without a reservation , otherwise  you need to make a reservation for the sofas, chairs all around. Very cozy and plentiful seating. There is a small outdoor area, mostly indoors with walls of glass. I will definitely return .",,,
21,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,4.0,8/18/2017,"What a great rooftop! From the outside, you would think it's a small comedy club. However, once you get inside you're treated to some of the best views NYC has to offer. You start by walking down a hallway filled with dim lighting and some artwork. You continue to walk up some stairs, and some more stairs and you will reach the elevator. You come across various employees at each stage, it get never ending. They were extremely friendly at every step of the way and give you directions to the final destination.It was a Thursday night around, but there was a pretty sizable crowd. I say that because we didn't intend on staying out too late. Unfortunately, all the seats were either filled or had a pending reservation. We didn't want to wait on the list-- so we made our way to the bar, which too was crowded, and ordered a drink there.I would definitely recommend this rooftop to any tourist, or NY native. Just have a reservation!Lastly, if anyone from management reads this-- please get a fan for the gentlemen by the elevator.",5,1,1
22,Stephanie S.,"Irvington, NJ",75,136,68,3.0,7/8/2018,Oh the SkyLark I had been waiting to visit here for a couple weeks so was excited to finally visit.... went up and elevator walked up some steps ... and some more steps to get to the rooftop...It was nothing I imagined.. view was beautiful but very tiny.. not a place you could bring a big group and be comfortable.. no place to sit just standing and watching the view with $20 drinks.. guess you're paying for the view right *rolls eyes*Of course we got the bartender who literally took forever to take our order because he was flirting with a young lady at the bar. Then he finally takes our order starts making our drinks then stops SEVERAL TIMES to flirt with the girl at the bar.. I've never seen a bartender literally stop making your drink several times so he can continue flirting with a customer so unprofessional.. on top of that halfway through the drink stopped to ask the next bartender if he was making the drink correctly and wanted to know what ingredients he was missing.... did I mention this drink was $40 something (it was a mini pitcher for 2 not worth the money by the way)  .... the only thing that saved this review was that the lower level is actually pretty beautiful with the views.. to me it was better than the rooftop there was seating available.  And the views just seemed better.. the crowd was good too... I won't go back but it was an interesting experience... 3 stars for the second floor views,2,,2
23,Angela L.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",2065,395,640,4.0,1/13/2018,"During our trip to the Big Apple in October of 2017, I bookmarked this as my main target to experience the best of what NY has to offer in the way of rooftop bars. We decided to meet up with a friend and her BF after realizing they were in town at the same time. But first, we had to figure out how to actually get to the rooftop bar on the 39th floor. Of course, we had to get through the doorman and the front door's street side entrance then it was a series of staircases and elevators in what seemed like a long journey. Finally when we arrived at the top the views were breathtaking. It's almost a 360 degree view of NYC with the Empire State building being a landmark I'm sure most of you would instantly recognize.The walkway is a bit tight and of course it's quite dark around the walkways. It was a Wednesday evening so I'm sure we didn't experience the full weekend crush of visitors so securing a table was easy. The cocktails our group had were tasty and appropriately priced for such a venue and its location. All of the staff were friendlier than I expected and we had a wonderful time with such a gorgeous backdrop of the city lights and iconic buildings around us. I would most certainly recommend this spot for the first time visitors to NYC.",12,8,17
24,Cynthia C.,"Houston, TX",96,812,1126,5.0,9/3/2017,"For such a swanky place, you might think that there would be some snobby personalities, but nope. The staff were some of the friendliest I have ever encountered and even the patrons were some of the sweetest I have ever met. The boyfriend and I ended up talking to this couple for about an hour on the 30th floor of the rooftop bar. They were giving us all the tips about how to utilize the circular lights to take the best selfies and pictures and even set up a space for us with the ""ideal"" lighting. The view is unbelievable at nighttime and I would HIGHLY recommend coming here instead of an observatory because the cost is probably the same as one or two drinks. I'm reading through some of the previous reviews and I'm writing this one and did not get the vibe that people would be that judgy about attire at all, but we had just come from a Broadway show and dressed a little nicer for the occasion - pics below.",1,,
25,Jean T.,"Queens, NY",246,8,130,4.0,6/21/2018,"I saw a video on Facebook promoting their Frosé Colada drink, which was so beautiful I just had to get it. It's piña colada sandwiched between two layers of frozen rosé in a wine glass. My friend and I were carded and dress coded at the front entrance, then directed through narrow hallways to an elevator that takes you up to the 30th floor rooftop. I believe we were the second group there (we showed up 15 minutes after they opened at 4:45pm on a Monday haha), but of course the best couches by the Empire State Building on the roof were taken. There's a lower level called the Living Room which has the bathroom, 4 sets of armchair/couch combinations with a small coffee table - name speaks for itself. There's no wait service while in this room, but it's a great place to sit super comfortably with a drink and enjoy the view if you don't want to be outside in the heat and poor cell service. The middle level has two rooms, a small one with a billiard table and the Main Lounge. This is an indoor bar with table service and a view. The rooftop also has a bar. I didn't try any of the food available as the cocktails were expensive enough. Each Frosé was $18 and bottled beer was $8. Service was impeccable though. When I asked for the coconut frosé, the bartender misunderstood and simply gave me a glass of only piña colada. When I explained that I wanted the one with frosé, he immediately and graciously fixed me up what I wanted with no extra charge for waste. It started to get insanely crowded after 6pm that lines started forming to take photos on the rooftop in the few square feet that were not occupied by furniture. If you can beat the crowd and claim a seat until sunset, the photo might be worth $18 :)",3,,

We got told we were ""too casual"", but it was clear it was because we were too alternative. She has over 1200 dollars of jewelry in her face, we're not some street punks.Obnoxious attitude.

From the moment we walked in at about 6:15p from the sidewalk the door man greeted us asking if we had a reservation or not and when we said no (there were two of us) it was no problem and he gave us directions to the elevator. We got to the elevator and the next gentleman gave us instruction on how to get to the actual establishment from the elevator. We were greeted when we got off the elevator. Greeted when we got to the host desk. Every. single. person. was kind and accomadating. We checked our coats and were offered a table should we not want to sit at the bar and after walking in and seeing the bar stools were full we went back to the hostess stand and got ""seated"".The ""seating"" were two plush vellore couches with pillows and views overlooking what I believe was the Hudson River. The server was attentive and came by immediately. The bus boys were attentive and collected empty glasses immediately. Who I believe was the manager offered to take my picture with the view in the background. I cannot say enough about their people. Specifically I want to mention Corrine (the spelling may be wrong). She gave us this spectacular area to sit and enjoy our cocktails while politely informing us the area was reserved at 7:30 and we would have to get up at that point. At 7:15p I inquired about keeping our area for slightly longer and she was so kind and accommodating and allowed us to enjoy our time for another 45 minutes. This place is absolutely spectacular. Thank-you!",5,,3

I wore casual clothes today since it was so hot and it's my first time visiting NY. When I got there and reserved my spot, the security dude said my outfit is too casual and I will need to dress up. Funny is that no one mentioned to me this has to be dressed up nor the person who called me to confirm my reservation. I just want to enjoy the food and drinks. Never again.",,,

43,Ina M.,"Hackensack, NJ",357,456,998,3.0,8/21/2017,"Ehhh, not a total fan of the spot. I was really turned off from the initial greet. We were told that two gentlemen in my party couldn't come in to the Skylark because they were wearing shorts. We've come here before and my fiancé wore shorts. The inconsistency of the dress code situation bothered me. If fiancé wasn't allowed to wear shorts the first time, then I wouldn't bother writing this. I ended up calling to clarify the situation and they let us in. Yay! What pissed me off was that we got to the rooftop, and there was another guy in shorts already there. SO WHY WERE WE GIVEN THE HASSLE IN THE FIRST PLACE?! Besides that, the place is nice with views. Drinks are strong and good. Service is okay. Yeah, I think I'd wait a little to make time to visit this place in the future. No rush whatsoever.",10,1,4
44,Geroline C.,"New York, NY",23,6,10,4.0,4/3/2018,"Absolutely loved the vibe of this whole rooftop lounge. The DJ played a really great mix of music, the decor was swanky AF, and the view of the Empire State was amazing! Definitely a cool spot to hang out to escape the craziness of midtown/Times Square below.The drinks and dinner bites were delicious, but a bit pricey for the portions (almost $20 for one cocktail!). Though in the end, I guess that's what you pay for when you go to a fancy spot with a great NYC view. I really liked the overall vibe of the lounge, but the outdoor rooftop part was pretty small and underwhelming. With such a great view, it's definitely just an area you briefly hang out to take pictures. If you're looking to impress a date or some friends/family from out-of-town, this is the place to go. I would say though it would have to be for a pretty special celebratory occasion for the prices. And I would for sure go somewhere else for a real dinner. Also, make sure to make reservations, especially if you're a larger group!",1,,2

46,Donna B.,"Reno, NV",466,1069,6411,4.0,1/29/2017,"This was totally my idea of a NYC rooftop bar.......But it comes with a price tag. Cool dark secluded entrance and a quiet elevator to the top. Coat check and a hostess to help you find the bar. A nice upscale view looking out over the city. Lots of comfy seating, but the bar itself is kinda small with only 8 seats.  A great selection of $16-20 craft cocktails. And a great small bites menu for $12-22. We tried the sliders, guacamole and chips and shrimp and corn fritters. All had nice presentation, but probably overpriced. The Harvest Cobbler was a great cocktail. Probably would drop in again I enjoyed the spot for a couple of hours.

First story is enclosed with beautiful views and a few different rooms including a room with a pool table, how cool. Second story is the outside rooftop which is spacious with stunning views. Trendy, sophisticated vibe with staff that is still down to earth despite the magnificence of the place. Drink prices are sky high, but this is New York.

My friends were astounded when I brought them here. When I told them we were going to a nice bar, they didn't expect to be in one that had perfect panoramic views of New York City. While the drinks are expensive and strong, the views are amazing and the staff is great. I was impressed when our waitress didn't write the order down and got it exactly right.

56,Casey L.,"Toronto, Canada",81,135,33,5.0,6/2/2017,"Wow! What a find on a Friday night.The entrance aesthetics are beautiful. You enter through a big set of industrial hallways and big thick metal doors, all lovely and moodlit with funky background music.The bouncer, Alex, and the front desk staff are the nicest I have ever encountered in New York. It was surprisingly not packed on a Friday at 8pm when we arrived - enough folks that you felt like the place was lively but not so many that you couldn't hear yourself think.[Food and drink]Food was rather expensive and just okay so I'd recommend eating dinner elsewhere.The drink menu, however, is wonderful, and the two signature cocktails which we ordered were on point.[Layout and decor]Decor is stunning (beautiful leather couches and wood tables, low lighting, floor-to-ceiling windows, all very tastefully done) and the views are gorgeous.There's a general indoor bar area, an outdoor patio, and several couches and small tables which can be reserved. In general the place is nicely spread out and doesn't feel cramped.There's also a room with a pool table and a little downstairs area called the ""living room"".Bathroom was beautiful and the attendant was just awesome.[crowd]Varied crowd, mostly dressed well. They varied from 20-somethings who look like they have their shit together to classy 30-somethings and the occasional tourist in flip-flops who probably realized how underdressed they were. And the waitresses are all so pretty.[Overall]Compared to most of the popular places in New York which are absolute shitshows where you can't hear yourself think, this was a classy and enjoyable experience, with tasteful aesthetics. Highly recommend.",4,1,1
57,Caitlyn B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",101,136,31,4.0,6/2/2017,"I always like to do these types of things - the bars high up in the skyscrapers. I know they're tourist traps, but I've been to quite a few so that should help boost my street cred in the following review:My husband and I went to The Skylark for a drink after seeing Hamilton. I had made reservations at 11:15 which ended up being perfectly timed. It was a short walk from Broadway. You enter in an unfinished industrial area and walk to the elevator. Art is hung on the walls and you see one finished gorgeous wall with the Skylark logo. I loved this space. It built up the anticipation and made it feel like a hidden gem.We were seated against a window with some gorgeous views toward Times Square (but the Skylark wraps around the whole floor so you can see the whole city). It was a Wednesday night but the place was packed. My only complaint was that it was a little too loud, made it hard to talk to my husband. It seemed like most people were there for bachelorette/bachelor parties or had been drinking all night so our two sober selves were not the key market at that moment.The drinks were pricey but that's to be expected at any rooftop/skyline view lounge. I ordered the spring fling which was cucumber something or other. It was refreshing and delicious. I could tell it had been crafted by a skilled mixologist so I was happy with the price ($18 for a specialty cocktail). My husband ordered a strawberry caipirinha which he said he enjoyed.We did not try any food so I can't review that.I was looking into doing Rainbow Room and I'm glad I found the Skylark instead. There were no drink minimums here and the views were just as good.",4,,1
58,Mia A.,"Washington, DC",2,34,1,4.0,8/6/2017,"Visited on a Friday evening during a quick trip to NYC.  View is a 10. Hudson River, Times Square...you can see it all from 30 floors up.  The food was yummy too; we ordered the tapas sampler, burrata pizzetta; guac; and, sweet potato fries. It turned out to be a lot of food for just me and my guy but delicious none the less.  For drinks we ordered a round of FROSE (available only during the summer on the rooftop). They were delicious and perfect for a summer evening.  Why not 5 stars: (1) Waitress. She was pleasant and we did get our food and drinks but once she dropped that off, we never saw her.  We had to ask others for napkins; water; etc. (2) the indoor space is very sexy (read: dark) which is fine maybe in all areas except for the bathroom. Seriously. You cannot see anything in these dark spaces. Me and another lady commiserated over the sinks; brighten up the bathrooms. Please!  Tips: make a reservation for rooftop.  It's s small space and could easily get packed.  Our reservations were for 4:30P - as soon as The Skylark opened - so we had no issues. If you can, go early and stay until after sunset. Although we missed that opportunity (we had a show to catch), I know it will look amazing!",,,

These cocktails were AMAZING! I think between the four of us we tried most of the menu, and they were outstanding. My biggest gripe would be price, but obviously, you get what you pay for and it's an upscale NYC rooftop. I knew what I was getting into :) Service was excellent, not too invasive but not rude, and reccomend Atkins were spot on! Also had some nibbles. The guac was good, the truffle fries were amazing, but the mac and cheese cupcakes? To die for. I would go back and order these over and over. I want the recipe!! Well worth it for a great view, (although it was raining when we went, so the outdoor deck was closed :() but perfect for a few drinks and snacks!!",,,

Unfortunately that day was overcast but we still had a great time. The staff at The Skylark provide an individualized guest experience- they showed personal detail that made you feel as if you were within a high class venue.The upstairs roof was open but the bar was closed. It was a weekday around 8 pm. The crowd was moderate and upbeat, but I can tell it would be pretty busy on evenings when the weather is nicer. Drinks and food are a bit expensive, though in the typical range for NYC lounges. I appreciate the creativity put into the food (and cocktails). Tropical Shrimp Tostadas- were my favorite meal item. The shrimp and salsa were served on top of crispy watermelon radishes and served with lime wedges dipped in a spicy salt. PB&J Smores pops were also innovative and very good.",1,,1

We came up before 7pm where they only take reservations for the indoor area. We didn't get kicked out when we weren't aware of the time, which was very nice of them. We went up to the roof afterwards. It was jam packed. If I wanted to come back again, I would make a reservation.

73,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",329,804,47,4.0,3/25/2017,"SkylarkHave you anything to say to me?Such begins the 1940's jazz standard by Johnny Mercer and Hoagy Carmichael (with a name like that clearly worthy of a punny restaurant name!)And it's the swanky rooftop lounge of the same name that offers a strong response to the question. Like a jazz standard, The Skylark whisks you away to a different world, of smoke lit rooms, late night intrigue and regretful yearning. When men wore fedoras, women gloves and the world was a simpler place. Skylark manages to take that ethos and update it for the 21st century, with an attractive interior (no smoking of course) that starts with a bit of mystery.Enter on the ground floor and you'll feel like you are in the wrong place. Is this really an old basement? Continue through this long tunnel with art adored walls and eventually you'll find guides to shepherd you along to the elevator. Push the ""Skylark"" button and emerge thirty floors later only to continue the labyrinthine experience.Up a few more step and finally you behold the lounge and, more importantly, Midtown views. (Yes, you can see across the Hudson to NJ but only the geographically curious care about that)The feel is undoubtedly that of a private club and it's a shame they only open at 4:30 as an afternoon here spent reading the papers could be a capital event. Unlike other rooftops I've been too, while the view is captivating the cocktails are actually creative and really well executed. The higher elevation does not have to result in obscene prices or a limp wristed poor. Skylark manages to pack the perfect amount of liquor into their concoctions for the relatively reasonable price of $18. (Hey, at least it's not above 20 bucks a drink!)Standouts include ""The Skylark"". (surprise, surprise)  It's like having a romulan ale in a cocktail glass thanks to the addition of blue curacao. Savor the ""Fort Knox"", a strong combination of bourbon and mezcal as you watch the Pan-Am-esque waitresses glide through the crowd, always smiling and proper. The dry and alcohol abstaining can also order a mocktail from the menu, which is a considerate touch for those who want to partake of the views but not the hangover.As the song (and review) conclude...SkylarkI don't know if you can find these thingsBut my heart is riding on your wingsSo if you see them anywhereWon't you lead me there",6,3,3
74,Colleen B.,"Orlando, FL",1768,1516,10078,5.0,6/28/2016,"Gorgeous. Tips: - Lounge only open Monday-Friday beginning at 4:30pm. - DJs begin at 6pm on Thur & Friday. - Sat/Sun private events only. I was on a mission in NYC: Rooftop Bars! Why? Because it was beautiful out, the city is stunning to take in from above and for some silly reason, Orlando only has like 4 rooftop bars, 2 of which I actually like. There are 3 options here, dine inside, bar inside with gorgeous view or the rooftop. We went straight to the top! The view alone gives this spot 5 stars but then add in lovely cocktails and boom! Yes, the cocktails hold a hefty price, but it's not terrible if you are only there for a short time. $18 a specialty drink. My fav was the Heathrow Tonic (refreshing and lite) - Earl grey infused beefeater gin, lemon juice, thyme syrup, tonic and a long thyme lemon ice. Yes, that is a long lemon ice cube with a long piece of thyme frozen in it. Lovely. It is a swanky place and we scored a quick drink on a Friday evening right around happy hour so it was sunny and packed with the after work crowd. We were able to score a pretty quick drink even though the bar was packed. Our bartender was very nice.

The menu options listed were all bursting with unique flavors and the presentation was five star. I particularly enjoyed the general tso crispy cauliflower, wontons, poblano peppers, and herb sea salt french fries. Didn't have a drink that had super memorable taste. I tried the coco and the margarita. They were ok but be forewarned, they're $18 each!My only disappointment was the service.

In short, absolutely horrendous service, no recourse sought out by our waitress, and general incompetence by the entire establishment. Will never in 100 years go back.We had a reservation after a play and were seated promptly, and were told that the restaurant's kitchen was closing shortly so we hustled to get a drink order as well as food into the server. 10 minutes past and we received one drink, and our waitress told us the other was being made. 10 more minutes, the waitress came back and informed me that they were out of a key ingredient and had to make something else. 10 more minutes went by and our drink finally arrived.  Antsy for our food, we finally tracked down our waitress who told us she'd check. Another 5 minutes, and we were told so sorry but the kitchen had been closed - 30 minutes after we'd ordered. Truly comical incompetence. There were about 10 ways this could have been at least partially rectified - and we had a measly drink covered. 25 minutes to a drink, and 30 to find out you order and frankly reason for coming was done.The great space they have deserves better, hope a more effective manager can hire people that care about customer service.",1,,

Would be the perfect spot to watch the New Years ball drop as it has a direct eyesight of it.  Not a ton of seating but there are enough standing tables for which you can have conversation over. Service was friendly and responsive. Will definitely be coming back next time I visit New York.,,,
85,Yeraldine S.,"Jersey City, NJ",470,299,557,5.0,4/17/2016,"The Skylark......What a glamorous place to sit back, enjoy some cocktails, light bites, all while taking in some stunning views of NYC. My best friend made reservations and it's highly recommended especially if you want to secure a better spot. I had the Fort Knox (elijah craig bourbon, reposado mezcal, yellow chartreuse honey syrup, grilled lemon ice block). I'll say this right off the back - most drinks are priced around $18 - pricey BUT you leave this place knowing you are getting your money's worth.  The drinks are creative in their own ways. We shared the Classic Beef Sliders ($18) and the Herbed sea salt dusted fries ($12) perfect with the truffle aioli. The best part of the night was the ambiance. There was a DJ but the music never got too loud to the point where you couldn't hold a conversation. The music, was surprisingly SO good. I wasn't expecting to hear some classic hip hop jams. Even for a Friday night, the place wasn't packed. I enjoyed that. The rooftop terrace in the summer is something to look forward to!",18,8,14

The staff looked like something out of Mission Impossible, and by staff I mean clusters of people on each floor with Rhythm-Nation-esque microphones speaking to each other. Once I finally got to a rooftop bar, per a ground-level employee's suggestion, I quickly realized that all the seats were reserved, so I asked where I could go finished my drinkThe drinks were quite pricey, which was fine, but there was nowhere to sit and enjoy them, so I asked for a seat anywhere and was taken to another floor where I could relax. While sitting at a table that was ""Reserved"" for someone else, I saw an area where I could go outside and enjoy my $15 Brut. However, while standing and admiring the city, I was quickly chastized by a waitress who said she needed to know where I was, because, ""I'm your server."" While I truly did not enjoy my experience here, most of the staff was great, she was not.If you just want to drink at a nearby bar, do not come the fuck here. If you want to look good and pay twice as much for a drink, or get someone else to, this is your place.",2,2,
89,Megan A.,"Grand Rapids, MI",28,6,3,5.0,10/15/2017,Best view of the city in midtown! Great Atmosphere and tasty table bites. The drinks are roughly $17 for a cocktail(averaged out) and $9 for a beer. Highly recommend checking this place out on a weeknight. We went on a Thursdays that was a bit chilly but still enjoyed the outdoor space they was lined with heaters and fun lighting. The music is Loud so if your hoping to have an intimate conversion request a couch and avoid the hightops.,1,,

Plus, if you make reservations, you take the stairs up one more floor to the tippy top. Drinks are expensive but you're paying for the view and the experience. Plus I stuck to one cocktail with pineapple and jalapeno which was really good. Surprisingly, the wait for the bathroom wasn't long at all. Service was good and attentive.

91,Ross P.,"New York, NY",39,125,101,4.0,2/12/2017,"Skylark is a classy lounge on the 30th floor. The lounge provides a nice view of the ESB and midtown.The ambiance fits the scene, as you will see plenty of people dressed business professional and business casual. This is not the ideal spot for someone who is laid back as they may feel out of place.If you want to order drinks at the bar, be mindful that they have a cash register for the waiters right next to the bar. So when you order a drink on the far right of the bar, be careful to not step on a waiter. My suggestion is order towards the middle as it does get a little annoying when you have to keep moving back and forth just to make sure you get your drink. I am not sure what the thought process was to place the register there.The drinks are on the expensive side but the value added is in the view and service. The bartenders were great with making my groups drinks fast and offering suggestions. I kept it simple with ordering a couple old fashions and friends opted for gin & tonics.This is a great place to go with coworkers, friends that work in a business field, or people who enjoy views.There is outdoor seating but in the winter, it is closed for obvious reasons.",4,1,

Make a reservation if you can, because this place gets packed. There's also a pool table for those with more hand-eye coordination than I.

101,Gary W.,"New York, NY",53,13,1,3.0,8/3/2018,"Unfortunately, my first visit to the Skylark was bismirched by the interior bar. TWICE I had made eye contact with a bartender without so much as a greeting & I was left alone to stand like a fool waiting to be asked for my order. Patrons were being served to my left and right during my first trip to the interior bar and it wasn't until I flagged down a busboy that I could get my I drink order fulfilled. My party moved upstairs to our rez so I went down to close. I waited at the left end of the bar as a bartender completed 3 pitchers for a table. I didn't want to interrupt as he made 3 pitchers of varying recipes but after he completed the pitchers, I expected my order to be taken but unfortunately, no such attention was provided. Meanwhile, the other bartender was attending to patrons on his ""half"", leaving the patrons on my end alone. The bartender on my end continued to fulfill tickets for tables without the courtesy of letting the patrons on his end that he was not available to take drink orders. I finally inquired and the bartender told me he wasn't taking drink orders (why wouldn't you inform the patrons standing around like fools? We should not be begging for service?!)",,,

103,Green B.,"Matawan, NJ",210,7,9,1.0,5/19/2018,"Regardless of how great the view and drinks are, the service here is horrible! Not just the servers lacking being attentive to the table but also the customer service from the hosts is very unprofessional. We were given a hightop where they told us they would need it back in an hour and a half at 8:30pm which it was 7:05pm when seated. Any time we wanted to order something or ask for extra napkins the ""little things"" etc.. we had to flag even the busboys down to then wait even a few extra minutes before the server would come if they couldn't get us something, like food or cocktails. Our food then took about 25min to come out which was shishito peppers and edamame. It does not take that long to cook that particular item. Our guacamole came out very quickly though. As soon as we started to eat the peppers after waiting so long for, we were then forced to get up from our table in the middle of eating and be moved to the communal table right in front of bar and DJ because the ""supposed"" reservation had arrived. It was very uncomfortable and rude. I've never in all my life especially in the middle of eating been asked to stop, pay and be moved. I worked in the industry from when I was 16yrs old serving and tending bar so I have 19yrs of knowledge and experience. While sitting there at our ""new"" uncomfortable seats I noticed after 15min no one had been seated at the hightop we were forced to move from. One by one as an hour went by all the hightops had cleared and left emptied. (I took a picture as proof to show this) After speaking with the only professional person and manager there and expressing how upset we were to be moved and treated so poorly, Katharine took the food off as a good gesture. As another hour of trying to pay and finishing our drinks went by the tables were still empty at 10:30pm when we finally left. Where were these people who needed our table and were supposedly there at the host stand waiting at 8:30pm for it?? I'm very displeased and disappointed with the situation as a whole due to it is a great rooftop view and I'm a local not a tourist just visiting. I come here often but now I will be second guessing coming back or even referring this place. Drinks at the bar yes go stand dance get served quickly but a sit down experience I think not.",,,

I would say this is my favorite rooftop bar in Midtown (and I can see my office from there which is pretty cool).It can get a little cramped up there when there are a lot of people but it's New York -- what can you do? When you exit the elevators, you feel like you're in Hakkasan in Las Vegas. Stairs. Everywhere. If you have on heels, be careful.The cocktails are pretty good. It's above average for a standard NYC cocktail but the view overcompensates over everything. The bar is also beautifully decorated and designed. Yes, everyone is slightly obsessed with the literal ring of lights that are speckled throughout the bar.We also met the owner, who is such a great guy. He also does Jimmy at the James -- another rooftop bar that is fun to check out. I recommend coming here. I find that there are more locals here than tourists (which is a wonderful thing and I'll probably regret what I'm going to say next) but if you're visiting the city, and think you're cool enough, checking out The Skylark is a must.",11,4,4

Walking in here felt like we were walking upstairs in a scary movie lol but really this place is on point .. There is a living room where you can hang out with couches and a more chill environment (it's almost like you're in someone's house) and there is a pool room for your entertainment... But the best is the rooftop. Awesome panoramic views of the city are perfect for the local or tourist. You can really appreciate the place... The bar is narrow but long on top with not many seats so I'm assuming you should get here early.. The ambience sets the tone for a perfect date night and the seating makes for a good night with a group (there are comfy couch like chairs with a table in the center, it has a very VIP feel to it lol)...

115,Antonia M.,"Las Vegas, NV",1422,429,6117,5.0,9/10/2015,"The vibe of this place is sexy for real.Located in midtown Manhattan in the garment district, you will find yourself at an unassuming doorstep with a yellow sign that states THE SKYLARK. The interior design of this place is mysterious and exclusive. You need to get to the 30th floor and on your way, through the dark hallways, up the suede-lined elevator, then up a couple flights you are asked twice- by the bouncer and then a hostess, ""do you have a reservation?"" Don't worry if you didn't think to make a reservation, although it's strongly recommended in order to snag seating on the rooftop portion of this venue - they let you in anyways. Then you arrive at a swanky penthouse with shimmering lights pouring in from the city, from all angles of the wraparound, floor-to-ceiling windows.I loved the exclusivity of this space; they weren't packed to the brim leaving us lots of room to move about and explore different areas of the lounge at our convenience. This venue is super comfortable, featuring private plush seating arranged in suede tufted loungers and couches, community tables, bar seating and also balcony and rooftop terrace access. The breathtaking view puts you in direct sight of the dramatic Empire State Building from the balcony and also on the rooftop terrace. There are many places to post-up and start-up an intimate conversation over amazing cocktails and flawless views of midtown. Whatever you do, do not sleep on the cocktails. They are pretty pricey at $18 each, but these artisan mixologists know what they are doing! They whip up crazy gourmet cocktails and they are equally delicious as they are stiff! Worth every penny. MEXICAN ROSE - A strawberry margarita with a tart twist of fresh lime & muddled fresh cilantro herb. The strawberry margarita was strong with fresh strawberry puree and I loved the essence of the aromatic cilantro. It brightened up the drink and made it extremely refreshing. 4/5THE COCO - An extremely unique drink, but didn't suit my taste - The mix of prosecco and gin was extra dry and the flavor was not balanced or sweet. Also the floating strawberry pearls were interesting to the eye, but did nothing to enhance the drink. 2/5WATERMELON THAI BASIL MARTINI - I only took a sip from the coco & the bartender was more than accommodating to exchange the coco for something else, so I decided on the watermelon Thai basil martini. Sophisticated, balanced and I enjoyed eating the watermelon cube and basil with a sip of the cocktail. Perfect! 5/5SWEET CORN MARGARITA - At this point I was already feeling relaxed from the prior 2 cocktails I (slowly) sipped. Whew, they do not skimp on flavor or alcohol in these drinks! We ended up wrapping the evening up with 2, ""last call"" drinks. The sweet corn margarita was a must since I'm an avid corn lover - THIS DRINK IS DELICIOUS! Super creative and unique, I absolutely loved the texture of the drink, slightly thick, from the muddled corn but it did not cause any annoyances. Also extremely balanced, expertly crafted. 5/5FORT KNOX - My date wanted to join in the last call festivities, so he wisely selected the Fort Knox: a super masculine drink crafted with: elijah craig bourbon, reposado mezcal, yellow chartreusehoney syrup, and a beautifully clever grilled lemon ice block! The drink has the strength to calm a bull and also the class to make you realize they actually put a ton thought into their recipes. 5/5Vegas lounges and nightlife have a lot to learn from The Skylark. This place is where you want to be and where you want to drink, the view is just the cherry on top of a fabulous evening!",83,64,71

Skylark has ridiculous views, especially if you can make a reservation and score a table. I love how they turn down the music to just the right level so you don't need to shriek like a banshee in order to have a normal conversation with your friends. I love how the rooftop area isn't ridiculously crowded (in no part because it's still relatively unknown). I love how they were patient enough with the frequent changes in my reservation, and how they kept my table even when my party was 20 minutes late.The food and drinks are pricey but you're definitely paying for the views and the opportunity to lounge on a comfy couch while enjoying said views. From one side, you have an unblocked view of the Hudson. The prickly pear margarita is a godsend on humid August nights. As for food, we tried the $20 Skylark sliders (not worth it IMO for only three sliders), the Peking duck wontons (this was definitely worth it), the guacamole, and the burrata pizzette.For rooftop bars in general, I think it's better to get a dinner beforehand and just come for drinks.

Well I'm excited to say that The Skylark is it!After a strong recommendation from a friend, I reluctantly came on a Friday afternoon and was immediately blown away. Located in midtown, Skylark is a swank rooftop experience that nails everything you'd want from a rooftop bar.The drinks are excellent! Expensive, but worth every cent. They have a fully stocked bar with higher end versions of each spirit. The bartenders are also on the ball and know how to make a great cocktail. The rum old fashioneds didn't disappoint!The venue itself presents as a modern rooftop paradise. The scene is swanky and the views of the Hudson are amazing. The music is a mix of everything from old school reggae to top 40, which gives a little something for everyone. The scene is very much a ""be seen"" kind of place. Lots of after work finance people and those who seemingly have been coming for a while. Slightly pretentious? Yes. Does it really matter? No.There you have it folks. The Skylark is the best rooftop bar in the city in my opinion. I've been to quite a few and have never really enjoyed any of them. Skylark far surpasses them from a value standpoint. It's expensive, but you're literally getting what you pay for. And to top it off, the place wasn't crowded at all. I look forward to many more times here.",14,5,7

Located in the heart of Times Square is a Ultra chic, trendy rooftop lounge with exceptional style and class. In search of a venue for my class mate's 30th bday, my 1st thought was SKYLARK!  The pictures, creative eats & cocktail menu combined with stellar views of the manhattan skyline was a no-brainer. He booked his table and a reservation was set. I arrived at Skylark about 945. I was greeted by 2 doormen that showed me to a long dark hallway, similar to that of a warehouse, in which I thought was headed nowhere. I was escorted to an elevator where the guest services person had me board the elevator to the 30th floor. I arrived to another ""check point"" where I was led to my party. THIS PLACE IS HUGE! This is not just a rooftop. It's like it's own...Playboy mansion. There are floors for lounging and dining.  This is a very chic venue, come dressed to kill. My party was already sipping on carafes of Cilantro infused Agave tequila when I arrived.  Cleverly mixed I had a glass. Pure genius! We ordered a plethora of eats: Mac n cheese cupcakes,  lobster rolls, Shrimp and grits puffs, Sliders and sweet potato fries. EVERYTHING was impeccable!  From the aesthetic presentation to the explosion of flavors. The shrimp was fresh, the seasoning on everything was perfect.  The sliders had this amazing flavorful sauce.The music here and the diverse crowd is one that is unmatched. Whoever is playing DJ is amazing. The mix of dancehall, top 40, rap, hiphop and R&B really set the mood for our party.  The staff was professional and gave 5 star customer service like we were at a resort style suite on vacation.

123,Sarah R.,"Spring, TX",192,9,7,5.0,3/17/2018,"Absolutely loved the atmosphere and vibe of this place. It started snowing the night that we went so the view was breathtaking. We didn't arrive till probably 11pm, and didn't order our drinks until probably 11:30 due to being distracted by the beautiful ""living room"" atmosphere and view of Manhattan. After checking the place out, my husband and I both ordered a cocktail each. I'm not sure if this is normal protocol in NYC, but for some reason he closed out the tab immediately without asking if we were going to want more drinks. My husband and I are in our early twenties, and look way younger... so I kind of got the impression that he didn't think we were going to spend another 40 dollars on one more round of cocktails, which we were planning on doing, but didn't, do to the assumption made by our bartender. Im still going to give this place 5 stars though, because I don't feel like one bad apple will ruin the bunch!",,,
124,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,4.0,8/13/2015,"Very good view with good cocktails. However there's no way of getting a place up on the rooftop if coming later than 10pm even on a regular Thursday night.Came here with two other friends and one of them is going to Seattle for career, so we really wanna find a quiet place for drink and more so for talk. Skylark did provide everything we hoped for and more!",5,1,4
125,Nick C.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",366,1032,1857,5.0,8/8/2016,"I've been to Skylark two Friday nights in a row now and I have to say, it's my favorite rooftop bar in the city. It has not been packed at all during either of my visits. There was no line to get in, there was no cover. The atmosphere is definitely more lounge than club. The music is played at a reasonable volume for conversation, and the soundtrack has been 90s and early 2000s hip-hop. Maybe it's not well known, but that's a major plus for me. Once you exit the elevator, you find yourself in a dimly lit labyrinth of stairs and hallways which lead to different lounging areas. So far, I've spent time in the pool room and on their roof deck.The pool room is small and feels very private. The pool table is free to use, but I advise that you only play if you're actually decent, because the floor to ceiling windows of the room are definitely expensive. You can enjoy a game of pool and enjoy a cocktail, while drinking in views of the city.The roof deck has even more spectacular views of the city. You can see the Empire State Building, Times Square, and the Chrysler Building, depending on where you're sitting. The couches are quite comfortable and perfect for conversation.The cocktails are the standard price for these nice venues, close to $20 a drink. They're pretty hit and miss, but I enjoy the pineapple mojito and their weekly frozen drink. You can always order a standard two ingredient cocktail if you're not sure about their specialities.",5,4,5
126,Ashish N.,"Phoenix, AZ",89,16,19,5.0,9/25/2016,"One of the best rooftop experiences ever. I met my sister after couple of years at this place so was definitely special too. Couldn't score a table on a Friday night outdoors but it wasn't too bad having a table inside too. We did go to the rooftop area and clicked some pictures and the views inside and outdoors were just spectacular. TSAO'S cauliflower is a must try along with Duo of Dips. Just about the perfect music, it wasn't loud at all and exceptional service .I would be coming again for sure.",2,,1
127,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,829,135,3.0,7/25/2015,"The Skylark is an interesting place with great views, but the service was so lacking in my recent visit that I couldn't rate it better. With service to match its view and prices, this could be a four- or five-star spot. (Also worth noting right off the bat: Skylark is only open Monday through Friday.) The entrance is interesting--almost speakeasy-like (but with a sign) as you enter through what feels like a loading dock and head up in an elevator equipped for freight.  Once you arrive on the 30th floor, Skylark has a classy feel, with an outdoor area and an enclosed lounge. (Beware that it has stairs once you arrive.) The Skylark has five-star views. Unlike some rooftop bars, this is both high enough and set away from other tall buildings (located at 39th St and 7th Ave, just south of Times Square) to give some nice panoramic views of midtown, Jersey, the Empire State Building and more. The decor is a little self-consciously hip. I found it fine, but my wife felt the style was a bit tacky.I would have given this lounge four stars, but service was uniformly subpar. We arrived early before a dinner, probably hitting the front door at 5:30 pm.  A large bouncer blocked our way but didn't acknowledge us in any way as he spoke on his walkie-talkie. After about 15 weird and uncomfortable seconds where he stared over our heads as if we didn't exist, he stepped to one side, and we walked in without him saying a word. (After we did, he called out to our backs, ""Two people?"" and then told us to go ahead when we confirmed the party size.) When we arrived at the lounge, we found it completely empty, but every table had a ""reserved ""sign on it. We were not acknowledged by the servers, so we weren't sure where we could sit. We opted for the small bar, since it had the only seats not marked ""reserved"" and no one wanted to pay attention to us, despite the place being totally devoid of people. When we sat at the bar, the bartenders didn't acknowledge us--one was working on prep and didn't make eye contact, and the other was mixing drinks (presumably for folks out on the deck, since we didn't see another soul), but he failed to welcome us for quite some time.  Asked about the vodkas he had, he waved at a shelf. Classy comfortable spot with great views of NYC, but the service was not in keeping with the upscale prices.",6,1,

129,Tian Z.,"Manhattan, NY",301,74,61,4.0,7/11/2016,"Super sexy view of the empire state building from the balcony of The Skylark. What I liked the most was the ""ring of fire"" set outside at the balcony to light up your beautiful face when you take a picture right next to it. It is literally the best spot to snap a beautiful photo with the empire state building in the background. I was surprised to find out that the lounge only opens from Monday- Friday. Reservations are highly recommended if you are going with a big party because you won't have anywhere to sit on a Friday night unless a reservation is made. I didn't like the music of this place that much but appreciated the fact that the music wasn't overly loud to overshadow my voice. TO summarize, a great date spot or a friends' hang out place on a Friday night. Drinks can be a little bit pricey but you're also paying for the view. :)",5,2,3
130,Mady A.,"Manhattan, NY",223,186,776,4.0,8/10/2016,"A beautiful day in NYC always calls for drinks at a rooftop bar! I've had this place bookmarked for a while since it's walking distance and easy to get to. You will be greeted by security/bouncer at the entrance. You walk through a secluded, dungeon-esq hallway that just made me think I was not in the right place. If it weren't for the Skylark signs on the walls I probably would have turned around. Walk to the back elevators where you will be greeted by another security/bouncer, take the elevators up to the 30th floor. Once there you will be greeted by a hostess who will direct you where you want to go. There's a private pool room and maybe a restaurant? I was going to the rooftop so I was shown the two dark flights of stairs I had to go up to get there.  Once you finally reached the top, you come to a very nice rooftop with pretty views. There are some seating areas and areas where you can stand and rest your drink on long communal high top counters. I looked for a spot to sit while I waited for my friend only to be told it was reserved. As I looked around it seemed every table was reserved. I spoke to a very nice host, Max, who was carrying around an ipad and asked about getting a table. He informed me that they were fully booked with reservations but I could put my name on their waiting list in case someone cancels or leaves early. I decided to take a chance and put my name down. The crowd seemed to be an after work both young and older. I did see other hosts escorting people around. I assumed it was people who were going to spend money or very pretty girls. At least that's the impression I got from people watching LOL. The cocktails are all about $18 each. Expensive but very normal for NYC rooftop bars. You will not find a happy hour special here. I had a frozen pear drink that was delicious. At the bar, Matthew was my bartender and he was super nice and friendly. The other bartender that was there seemed miserable. He never smiled or spoke and it was very hard to get his attention if you needed a drink. I stuck with Matthew. After about 2 hours of hanging out, the host, Max found me and let me know a table was ready. HOORAY! We sat next to a fun bunch that were there with coworkers. When they left, they offered to give us their bottle of Rose that was more than halfway full. We accepted of course! We went to the bar to order some food. We chose the chicken tacos. They were not joking when they said ""bar bites"". It was $17 for 4 teen tiny tacos. We then decided to order the Pizzetta ($18) and that was a much better size. This is where the bad happens:As I was chatting with other guests, the busboy asked me if I was done with the pizza. There were still about 3 ""slices"" left. I told him no, we're not done with it. I continued chatting and when I looked back our entire table had been cleaned up, including the bottle of Rose which was still half full a this point. I flagged down a waitress and told her what had just happened. She apologized and said because my friend got up to go to the ladies room, she assumed we were done and she told the busboy to clear our table. Two seconds later our bottle appeared again in the exact same way it was taken. Did they have it saved in the back somewhere? Also, they did send out a brand new pizza for us. Thank you for that!The space is beautiful but not very large so it can get crowded on a busy night. I would HIGHLY recommend getting a reservation if you want a spot to sit.",3,1,1

So the bouncer started letting us in and then decided not to. When we called back to say that no progress had been made the woman said ""it's up to the bouncer based on dress code and other factors then said she had to go"".  Would love to know why we were not allowed in.  Wouldn't recommend because they weren't busy and still wouldn't let me in.",,,

136,Salman S.,"Allen, TX",363,122,831,4.0,9/8/2015,"Skylark is an integral part of the New Yorker experience. Located right next to time square. This is not your regular rooftop bar, it is one which gives you a good 360 experience of the city by going up or down 1 floor and seeing different angles.  Entering in it seems like this is not the right place as you would expect a nicer walk. You are taken to the elevator where you press a button and zooomed up to the top.  Once you walk in expectiing a view you see a hostess who guides you to another staircase. As soon as you climb that you are at the top of the world. The most amazing view will behold you and first thing that you do like nay other person is get the cell phone camera ready to roll. The bar is pricey but that is not why you are here. Everyone is nice and do remember they close at 1230am sharp so dont be expecting a late night in here.",1,,

The view is flawless, honestly the only reason I even liked this place! it's a decent size, I would say medium-ish compared to other Manhattan rooftops. There were of course not enough seats and my feet were killing me. The food service was non-exist any because it was so slow. my friends put in an order and never got it even after complaining about it 4 times! It was awful. I had two glasses of wine on ice, nothing else on the menu looked too appealing. Prices were moderate ! $14 a glass of wine. The music was terrible, I'm 22 and the music made me feel like I'm 35. sorry to those of you who are. Overall, I would go but I wouldn't spend the whole night here if I were you.

The interior was beautiful, modern, and comfortable. The floor to ceiling windows provided nice views of the city. I'm sure the views would have been better had the skies been clear.The food and drinks were great. I had the rhubarb and strawberry caipirinha which was delicious.

140,Sophia W.,"Manhattan, NY",396,195,107,4.0,8/15/2015,"Classy place in midtown that requires long pants even on a Wednesday night. I like this place because they don't discriminate and almost everyone in who abides by the dress code. This place has two levels - rooftop and lounge. Both are equally good and it really depends on what you want to do - enjoy the night view or talk with you friends. They have crowd control on the rooftop so they stop letting people in at around 1am. The rooftop is nice but quiet small. There is a good view of the Empire State Building and other skyscrapers. The drinks are good. I have had the coco, the Cosmo, dark and stormy and the Fort Knox. The coco and the Cosmo were delicious and strong ( it's a hard balance to strike but they did a good job!) Fort Knox is a a bourbon based drink - not my go to but my friend found it good. Dark and stormy is gin based with ginger. However the ginger taste is pretty overwhelming so it kind of tasted like something you drink when you're sick. Overall this place is nice. It's becoming a go to place for me in midtown.",1,,
141,Nicole R.,"Union City, NJ",220,140,357,5.0,4/18/2016,"The Skylark. Wow.Located on the 30th floor right in the heart of Manhattan this location hits every category that makes it deserving of more then 5 stars.  From the minute you walk into the building you feel like a celebrity being escorted to a members only club.  The Skylark has everything a Manhattan rooftop bar should have: breaktaking views of the skyline, outstanding service, delicious apps, and of course mind buzzing cocktails. I picked this place for my best friend and I to come and celebrate her latest endeavors. Although the drinks may come across as pricey that idea floats out of your mind once you take a seat.  For drinks I ordered the Skinny Paloma $18 which had a main ingredient of tequila.  The drink went down so smooth with every sip and the aftertaste gave off a very plesant taste of the alcohol concoction that was in my cocktail. Although steep in price these drinks are worth every penny because if your goal is to feel a nice buzz then trust me you will get your monies worth.The Skylark offers small plates which are good to share and pick on.  We ordered the classic beef sliders with a side of fries.  Once again high in price but who cares at this point! The sliders were perfect size to nibble on while sipping on cocktails and chatting it up.  My favorite part of my time spent at The Skylark was the view.  We must have been seated in the best area because everyone was coming towards our section to take pictures of the sunset. My bff and I literally stopped talking (just for a few minutes of course) to take pictures and video because it was a beautiful site.Ok so I have another favorite part!  The DJ!  It's important to note they only have a DJ on Thursday and Friday nights.  The music was not loud where you had to scream to hear the other person speak.  It was the perfect background sound that you can sing along to but his music selection was on point.  If you are a fan of 90s hip hop  then you would be in glory like I was.  Every new song selection he chose would spark a memory and was the cherry on top for a spectaular evening spent in the city.I cannot wait to go back to The Skylark to catch some more amazing cocktails and stunning views.",12,2,7

We took the elevator up and found a horrid smell as a woman had just puked (!!! ) in the entry. We quickly climber the stairs and wondered what kind of bar this was.

I came here for a work event so I had no trouble getting in. I think that the doormen can be strict if you're not part of a party especially on the weekends. I'd imagine that getting in during the weekend evening rush could be troublesome here.Warning: This place has a Meatpacking-ish vibe to it which means there's a certain air of pretentiousness and the clientele is pretty fancy. If you can look past that, then I'd highly recommend this place because the views are fantastic! Up on the roof you can enjoy panoramic views of the Midtown skyline as well as sweeping views of the Hudson River. There's also an indoor area with a full bar and floor to ceiling windows. It's perfect if you happen to come when the weather is not nice. The indoor area is spacious and nicely decorated. My group was stationed here and we had a great time. The line at the bar can be tough because they only had two bartenders staffed. They could definitely use a couple extra bartenders. As far as drink prices go I really can't comment since I was here for an event. I think they're on the higher side - like $15+ for a cocktail, but that's just my guess.

It looks like it might have been a private club not too long ago, and the exceptionally attentive service (which borders on Big Brother watchfulness) is impressive. The short list of small plates has some interesting options, including addictive little mac and cheese cupcakes, and everything is delivered promptly.But then: The specialty cocktails aren't that good. The Manhattan tasted watered down, with a pretty seriously funky aftertaste. The wines are 4x retail price. And if you aren't young and stylish, you'll find that your seating options are worst of house. My wife and I had some sliders, appetizers, and a couple of drinks, and racked up a $200 bill.

It's a great view, but one of the managers is completely awful. The doorman, Alex is a sweetheart. Very friendly and accommodating. He did me a favor and booked us a reservations with clients for this week. We went, and when we arrived we were rudely told our table wasn't on the rooftop but on the level below it. We gave up a 5 star dinner to come here to sit outside....no one comes here for the food or cocktails while both are definitely decent-good....the view/rooftop is the reason. We weren't happy, so we nicely asked to speak to the manager (mind you- this was also embarrassing in front of our clients). He came over and said the rooftop was first come first serve, even for reservations (names go on a list) and we can go to our table in the meantime to wait. Didn't offer to send over any comped bites or cocktails or comp our bottle of wine. We ended up being offered a table upstairs an hour and 15 minutes later, which was nice, but we HAD A RESERVATION. They did us NO favors and when our $500 bill came, I nicely pulled him aside and said you're not going to do anything for us and he goes ""I got you up here"". I was appalled. I like the skylark- good drinks, decent food, good service - but this manager Charles would literally be a reason to stop taking clients there and giving them business. He was SO rude. If you are over capacity and can't accommodate- ok, things happen but a good manager handles that properly, and his behaviorawfdu was appalling. NEVER GO WHEN HE'S WORKING.

From the moment I stepped into the elevator, I knew that Skylark was about to bless me in a way that most New York bars have stopped caring to bless their patrons. I had wine, obviously. I opted for their Grüner, because I'm better than you. It was a Domane Wachau ($15), which is impressive to have by-the-glass. This is the right choice for you if you don't know anything about Grüner and want to look ""with it.""

We spent a lot of money ( everything is VERY pricy) for watered down cocktails and small tapas .  I hate to dis an entire place based on this interaction, but really if she's done it to us , she's done it to others .",,,
161,Sabrina T.,"New York, NY",229,176,27,4.0,5/21/2016,"The Skylark is beautiful and very chic. Awesome view of the cute and amazing cocktails to compliment that view. But, my boyfriend and I's night was ruined when the bartender gave his card to another customer. I understand mistakes happen but it was a very quiet night and that was a bit careless on their end. They also wanted to still charge us for the food and drinks instead of comping us although they lost our card... This happened at the end of the night. Thankfully we were able to get the card back that night but with all the scamming via cards we were too please. I would recommend paying per drink.",,,

163,Aimee C.,"Brooklyn, NY",425,10,7,5.0,9/16/2017,"If you're looking for the perfect date spot, this is it.  The ambiance was nice, has tall windows with all of midtown as the view, had a DJ, friendly waitresses, and amazing small bites (do not offer entrees).  We got the Mac and cheese cupcakes, chips and guacamole, skylark sliders, tuna wonton tacos, and shrimp tostadas.  Everything was amazing!  My favorites would have to be the shrimp tostadas and the tuna wonton tacos.  The tacos had a nice spicy kick to it and the wonton part was nice a crispy, but not hard.  The shrimp tostadas had so many different flavors all in one bite!  Can't fully explain the flavors, but just know that it was amazing and could've probably ate like 10 more of those.  As far as drinks goes, we did not try many, but the one drink I ordered, I loved.  The watermelon mule was light and refreshing.  I would have to say that the price is a little on the higher end, but it was an amazing experience.  Everything was on point and will definitely go back.  Oh and ps- also great for groups.",,,
164,Kay L.,"La Crescenta, CA",182,278,189,5.0,3/1/2017,Amazing!!! Was on yelp trying to figure out if this place was worth going. Came across some negative reviews.. thank God I didn't listen to them. If I did I would of never came across this gem. Came in for a cocktail on a Thursday night. Very Mello crowd. The bar wasn't packed. The service was great. But let's get to the real story... the view!!! It was amazing. Right in front of the Empire state building. It was seriously mesmerizing. This place is worth checking out. Trust me!!,,,
165,Amy S.,"Venice, CA",322,751,47,4.0,1/21/2016,"Very swanky bar about 40 floors up in mid-town. The views here are spectacular, as are the cocktails!We were served quickly at the bar. I had the New York State of mind, which had a good apple flavor and the light hint of cinnamon, and the Sommelier cocktail - also very good.All the drinks we had were really tasty, great quality booze, and defo got us tipsy for the night. Overall had a great experience here.",2,,1
166,May H.,"Queens, NY",661,74,162,5.0,10/1/2016,"Five stars! Five stars! Five stars! I originally made a reservation for a Friday night at 8:15pm, but little did I know I didn't have enough time to get ready. I called and asked them to push the reservation to 9pm. The receptionist was really sweet and easily changed the reservation for me. They also called early in the afternoon to remind me of my reservation. It looks kind of dark and shady once you enter. Once you walk in through the entrance, there'll be a set of elevators that take you to the 30th floor. Once you get to the 30th floor, there's a lounge/pool table. You go up a flight for your reservation/coat check. The bar will also be located on the upper level. I made a request online while making a reservation to be seated by the Empire State. & behold I got a seat that literally faced the Empire State! Hallelujah!! What a great view for my birthday celebration! Onto the drinks and food. It was only a party of two so we ordered 3 dishes; guacamole, barbecued short rib bites and tuna wonton tacos. For drinks we got the Montreal 75 and Skinny Paloma. If you're a light drinker like me I would suggest the Skinny Paloma. The Montreal 75 was way too strong for me. They also have nonalcoholic drinks if you don't like alcohol! I didn't get to try the short rib bites but the guacamole and tuna wonton tacos was really  good! Keep in mind this is a rooftop bar and the portions of the food is extremely small. They're called dinner bites for a reason, food to go with your alcohol. You're not going to be full from these dishes, you might want to go to a rooftop restaurant if that's what you're looking for. The guacamole was actually pretty big! The texture and flavor was much better than I expected. There were some large chunks of avocado in the dip, but you can easily crush it or scoop it up and eat it. The service was phenomenal! The bouncer at the entrance was a little jokester! I changed into my heels and he jokingly told me no heels were allowed. LOL! The servers and host were extremely friendly and nice. Huge props to the host! He was the one who saw my request and seated me by the Empire State Building. The waitress was really patient with us and explained which alcohols not to order since I'm a lightweight drinker. I also brought a cake for my birthday and they put it on a nice plate for me with a candle on top! (I forgot to bring my own candles oops.) Now let's not forget about the view!!! Oh the view. As I said I was seated near the Empire State Building and they have a door that leads you to the outdoor patio with a another beautiful view of the Empire State Building. This is honestly the best spot to take photos. Full body photos!! -Hint hint-I also truly believe that the prices weren't that bad. I believe a drink was $16-$18 and the dishes ranged from $15-$25? We paid a total of $120 w/ tips&tax for two people. I personally don't think it's expensive at all when you have such a nice view! They made a mistake on our check by adding 2 other things that we didn't order (it was like $70-$80!!) They quickly fixed it and gave us our correct check afterwards. So always make sure to check before paying! Even if you're tipsy LOL!!",14,3,7
167,Victoria F.,"New York, NY",257,21,0,1.0,7/24/2018,"Worst place ever! Will never go back. First, every table has a reserved sign and god forbid you innocently sit at an empty table with a sign right? What's the harm right? Let them move me when the reservation arrives. So I ask for a drink menu and the waitress ignores me and has another woman I guess she works there to tell me I couldn't sit there . I said I'll leave when my friend arrives since nobody is sitting at the Table yet and she said she still couldn't serve me. lol so then a second waitress arrives and tells me again I can't sit there. Lol it's the most moronic place. Waitresses whispering like you killed someone. So my friend arrives and we go upstairs. We thought we scored a sofa in the corner as a lovely older couple was leaving but no they got kicked out too! They said they wouldn't even serve them!! It was so comical at this point that we refused to even get a stupid drink at the 10 deep bar. Whoever is  running this place needs a few lesson in hospitality for real.",,,

First visit: Incredible bartenders who cater to your every alcoholic need, crack jokes and make you feel like you're besties within minutes. The wait staff for the table section, on the other hand? Easily the worst people I've ever encountered at a NY rooftop. Our ""waitress"" was so horrible, so full of rude 'tude, we actually asked her to transfer our tab back to the bar and finished the night there. Next visit: Having learned from the first visit, we stayed at the bar all night, and were once again treated like old friends. I didn't see our waitress there that night, but the rest of the staff seemed to be more friendly than they were before. I'll give management the benefit of the doubt that they worked out those ""kinks"".Skylark is my rooftop of choice for out-of-town visitors, with its central location, gorgeous panoramic views, top-notch concoctions, and amazing bartenders.",4,,1

Next challenge was service.  No one came to serve us!  We had to wave random servers for drinks, food, etc.   We provided feedback to a manager Catherine, who said she would look for a rooftop table and never got back to us.  She did comp us our sliders bc the sauce provided was too spicy and in the dark we could not see.  Note we asked for ketchup!  Overall really under average service which makes me think thwice before returning.   Lots of other options ....",,,

Then when I arrived to the 30 floors, was very confusing for me because I did not see where the bar was, after a couple stair, there was a table with 2 hostesses giving the welcome and asking if you had reservation. They also ask me if I want to check y coat. The checking of the coat was free. While I walking into the bar, I was able to notice, that the place have one of the best view of Middletown i had seen in my life. The bar feels like were in your living room, the staff is very attentive and quick and efficient and check if you want anything else.I had the Brooklyn Sorachi Ace: Really nice beer. I wasn't really expecting this to taste so good. A bit expensive for a beer but really worth it. We share some apps. I ate the sliders that are ok here.

179,Allison B.,"Herndon, VA",235,13,8,4.0,8/4/2017,"ATTN: lengthy review. For summary skip to bottom.I was a little skeptical when I received these directions to get to The Skylark rooftop: Go up the elevator when you get here, then up the stairs, then tell them rooftop when you get to the desk and go up more stairs. Fact is you kinda need the directions. At first glance The Skylark doesn't look like much. If you didn't know what you were looking for you would definitely not bother to navigate the dark halls that get you to the rooftop. There is a restaurant and lounge area downstairs which I did not spend any time in. The rooftop however is one of the most beautiful views. Perfect view of the Empire State Building and Times Square. It was not overly crowded which surprised me for how close it was to Times Square. Definitely feels like the kind of place you have to be told about. I had the most delicious cocktail here. It was a watermelon mule which was the perfect summer night drink. Kitchen closes at 10:45 and we ordered the fries with truffle oil which were very yummy. All in all a great experience.

I've been here for drinks or a private event and each time, I find the views as nicely done as the decor on the inside. I agree with James T that it is nice to check out and actually quite different depending on the weather.  There are more than few really wonderful cityscape views to be had.The Service: I typically go during off hours, so I find the service fantastic.  they do have a nice flow and ample staff. It's a well run spot.The food:  There actually isn't something I wouldn't recommend. It's minor twists on simple foods that can be prepared fresh and quick, versus most places that just try too hard.  Many of them are runner friendly (Deviled eggs, with a more stylized filling, pigs and a blanket with stylized mustard, mac & cheese cupcakes, etc).  All of it is pretty thoughtful.The Drinks:  Lots of choice for mixology enthusiasts.  I also like that they have non-alcoholic drinks as I sometimes can't drink due to training.  Training also means I'm dehydrated and these drinks aren't cheap, but whatever, at least I'm not stuck answering the question, ""what are you drinking"" with ""a sprite"".  I've gotten pretty drunk here too, so my non-wagon Yelpers, they do just fine for those who want a less sober evening.",7,,2

Was not overly crowded on a Thursday evening. The background music was a bit nostalgic and retro, ranging from hip hop, r&b, reggae, and alternative from the 90s-2000s. Beautiful view with the price to match. Cocktails ran around $18. The food menu looks tasty but consists of mainly hors d'oeuvres and small bites so definitely come after dinner.

When I first walked in, we went to the small outside patio corner without realizing that there was another floor so don't make the same mistake! The deck on the top floor is perfect for a group gathering and the drinks are nice and strong. The bartenders are helpful and there is enough space to move yourself away from certain crowds if you are not a fan.The setup is nice with multiple sofas and chairs around outside.
