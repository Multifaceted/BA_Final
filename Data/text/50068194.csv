0,Ebony C.,"Brooklyn, NY",338,497,140,4.0,11/19/2018,"I love the movies and would go to just about any theater. Especially when moviepass was on point. I scrolled through and saw that Bohemian Rhapsody was playing here one random Saturday afternoon. Plus I could reserve my seat ahead a time... yay!Clearly I wasnt paying complete attention when I reserved my ticket because this spot might as well have been in the Hudson on 57th st. 12th ave is FAR!!!!!  Hence the 4 stars. However,  I loved this theater!There is a bar that you can grab a few drinks from before the show. Thethe concession stand has popcorn and hotdogs, but they also have organic healthy treats for those who need to feel better about their life choices when at the movies. Once inside I liked the way the theater seemed more spacious than most places. It could have been the theater I was in. The seats didnt recline but it was still very comfortable. Everyone seemed to follow the rules of not talking or texting...until someone's nana cell went off with the crazy house phone ring.Overall, I'm a fan. I most likely will venture here in the summer time when it's nice out and I don't mind walking down to the other side of the world.",1,,2
1,P G.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",0,22,3,4.0,9/23/2018,"Nice brand-new theatre, in an out-of-the way location from the perspective of most Manhattanites. Others have praised the reclining chairs, however both times I have come, so have found them to be really annoying. They do not lock in the upright position, so if you don't want to sit all the way back and look at the ceiling, there is no back support and I am in discomfort. The chair should not be such a distraction.Pleasant staff.",,,
2,Sean B.,"Manhattan, NY",383,45,3,2.0,9/14/2018,"Bad NEWS ! Dear Management: great upscale snazzy place to have a drink and watch some art flicks. However !! Please RE-think those bags of popcorn you sell. In brown paper bags. I was privy to some older guy in his late 60's next to me wrinkling (yep) CRINKLING his large bag all thru the film. The theater was packed so there was nowhere to move and because the theaters are smaller there's nowhere for the sound to go but in your ears. Get the picture ??I didn't want to leave because the film was riveting however left feeling like I threw 20 bucks away. This is NOT an exaggeration. You'd think a guy in his 60's would know better and be a little careful after the first hour of bad manners but NO - Nope sure didnt. For two hours this guy grabbed the bag every few minutes and really made some steller irritating movie wrecking sounds with that bag. Get a clue and buy some round popcorn tubs like other theaters. I almost said to this rude ass-wipe: ""Look man!!  its been 2 hours of this BS give it a rest..."" Some people should eat dinner before going to the movies. The guy also chomped and smacked every bite after wrinkling the bag...bad experience. Please Rethink you in theater food containers and options. I dont think Ill be back or If I do early afternoons only in a less packed theater. So not happy you ruined the film for me.",1,2,1
3,Nick C.,"Manhattan, NY",67,526,235,4.0,11/12/2018,"I was not  aware that this movie theater even existed but a movie that I wanted to see was playing there and nowhere else [it was the closest to me in midtown] I walked there but it is a little off the beaten path. It is located on 12th Avenue [near the water] and 57th street. My movie started at 11:15 and I had gotten there a little early since I had never been there before and they had yet to open. There is nothing in the immediate area where you can wait in so myself and my friend waited outside until the theater opened. It is a modern complex, very new but tickets are pricey even for seniors. However, the chairs recline and it is very comfortable to see a movie here. The staff was very accommodating and i would return to see a movie there. If you like to walk-great-however-many would get into a cab to get there!",1,,

This place has both!Being a native uptowner, I've never heard of Landmark Theaters. I received an invite to attend a screening and I'm glad I made it! This place looks great, modern and new but the best thing is the bar with fabulous bartenders! Jennifer made me a wonderful pre-movie cocktail and it made my long walk from 5th Ave worth it!When I entered my theater I was pleased to see the nice, gently used, reclinable leather seats waiting for me.This theater is great and I'll be back, with friends and will share the news of the great theater at the end of 12th!",2,,
5,Edward W.,"New York, NY",394,1456,2735,5.0,8/14/2018,"This is definitely an upscale movie theatre and should be the standard all movie theatres strive for. There is a nice dining area for relaxing before/after the movie. The number of seats for theatre 3 was quite small and every seat had a great viewing angle of the screen. Fantastic leather seats that aren't too firm or soft. With moviepass, I'm glad I didn't have to pay anything for the ticket and they also support e-ticketing. Location is far from the subway. I happened to be near here, but it's certainly not very accessible.",2,2,2

7,Jordan W.,"Bronx, NY",1524,1242,3777,4.0,9/30/2018,This is one of the newer movie theaters I can think of in NYC. I did enjoy the visit here and it was a win-win. They do accept moviepass so that is cool also. I have been to two different theaters here actually both were enjoyable. The one movie I saw was The miseducation of Cameron Post and that recliner in that particular theater was amazing. Will definitely come back and I hope that I am in the better section or better recliner seat let's say. Long live Moviepass and saving $18.50 every time here. Good looks!,2,1,1

Updated review","This theater is located kind of away from the city center, not very convenient spot to get to. But, that comes with less crowded theaters, which is nice. They offer is a bit unusual. Very interesting films, like international films and independent films that are not offered at other theaters. With that, it is a bit pricey. We went to see an international film during a normal matinee hours, but that does not matter at this theater, it still is pricey, not matter what day or time you go. The inside was very clean, large, with high quality installation. The screen is not huge, but a good size. The interior design was very simple, modern bur kind of monochromatic and dark. The seats are pre-selected at the time of purchase. The chairs were nice, soft leather, large and comfy. They recline and the foot rest comes up for complete relaxation. BUT, some the chair that I was sitting didn't work so well... Acoustic was really good, and the resolution the screen was good too. A staff came in before the trailers started. He introduces himself with a smile and said to ask any question or concern we might have, which was a nice service.After the movie, as we were leaving the theater, staffs greeted us and thanked us from coming. Very nice service, but not a movie theater that I would frequent, due to location and price. It is good to know that we have a movie theater that offers",1,1,1
9,Christae E.,"New York, NY",18,47,23,5.0,7/31/2018,"How have I never been here?!  This might be the most bougie movie theatre in Manhattan It accepts MoviePass with eticketing, reserved seating, wall to wall lazer projected screens, with local fare, a full bar in the lobby, leather recliners, with 2 parking  garages and it's on the waterfront It's also immaculate and there are only 20 seats in my theatre.They also show special features from The Royal Opera House, National Theatre Live, Royal Shakespeare Company and Globe on Screen. When movie pass dies, this is definitely where I'll be going to buy all future exorbitant New York priced movie tickets",1,,
10,JiHae L.,"Sunnyside, NY",111,168,572,4.0,7/16/2018,"Besides some snooty patrons that go  there, I like this place. Wish the seats would recline more, but then it'll be more like a bed. I've been wanting to check this place out ever since I saw that it was on moviepass and looked up that it has reclining seats. The location isn't the greatest as it is very isolated and all the way on the west side.  Have to take a bus out there or walk forever (wear some comfy shoes). The outside looks like some type of arena. But once you walk-in you see a nice bar and food area. The concession stand is over priced, but pretty nice. Nothing is sticky and left out. The employees are all really nice and customer service is outstanding. My friend described the movie theater as something you see out of someone's house in mtv cribs. I was like yea, it looks like a home entertainment center for the rich & fabulous. Nice and clean leather seats. Everything is wiped down and the floors aren't gross. I would come back if it wasn't so far away and less obnoxious people that think they are rich and fabulous.",,,1
11,Cory B.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,109,672,5.0,11/19/2017,"I love this cinema and Landmark cinemas in general.This place is very high quality even compared to AMC theaters. The seating is fantastic, the sound quality is great and picture is nice. Inside the theaters are really spacey as well with plenty of foot room which is a huge plus to me.One of the main reasons I love places like these (and also Landmark cinemas) is that they offer a fantastic selection of movies. For this place you can come in to see a typical Hollywood movie but you can also jump in if you want to see something a little more indie and less represented in other mainstream cinemas. I find that fantastic and I think its a great business modal. The place is a little awkwardly placed in the building where it is but maybe that is just my opinion on it. Its not a big issue anyways. They do have what appears to be a bar in the front but I am not sure if its part of this cinema or unaffiliated. I have never used it previously.Overall a fantastic cinema which I highly recommend.",1,,
12,Jen S.,"Brooklyn, NY",863,146,2,5.0,8/13/2018,"Really great theater. A little off the beaten path but if you walk all of NY on the reg, it's not terrible. Beautiful seats. Good food selections. And last night, the freaking movie director popped unbeknownst to us and he did a Q and A when it was over. Totally blessed!",,,
13,John C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,65,6,3.0,10/12/2018,"For such expensive tickets the chairs in theater 5 are horrible. If you lean back they go alllll the way back. They are hard and uncomfortable. I get there are trying to be luxury... but they fail massively here. Also, the concession stand could use a good old fashion Icee. They have pizza, candy, soda, but no Icee's!!! That's probably a crime in some countries.",,1,
14,Eve B.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/21/2018,"Went to see movie last night. Theatre #5 was stifling hot, literally no oxygen. Complained to manager who responded that there was ventilation problem and offered refund plus pass. Unbearable and we left. Why didn't they alert people before going in? Very poor management response. Theatre far from subway so add cost of taxis to annoyance factor.",,,
15,Cameron M.,"New York, NY",241,7,0,5.0,10/16/2018,"What a primo movie going experience. They had a very intuitive eticketing software and 6 booths right st the entrance. Having purchased my tickets before had, this made picking them up a breeze. The lobby is beautiful and feels very lux. The assigned seats were among the comfiest I've ever experienced and they reclined to that sweet spot of not quite the angle of sitting up in bed with a stack of pillows behind your back. The staff was peasant and the popcorn deliciously buttery, albeit expensive. Huge fan of this theatre. Planning to become a regular at this one.",,,
16,J L.,"Brooklyn, NY",253,69,9,3.0,11/2/2018,"Great movie theatre, but not ""hot"" food until after 3pm? Seriously?! You need to change this as when people come to your establishment they may want something other than popcorn and candy to eat. Ridiculous!",,1,
17,Elizabeth L.,"Queens, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/31/2018,"Wonderful theater, unfortunately Walked all the way across town to find out the first showing of The Happy Prince was cancelled with no explanation.  The cancellation wasn't posted online either.",,1,
18,Carson T.,"Brooklyn, NY",311,47,133,4.0,4/9/2018,"This is right on West Street at the very end of 57th Street in Manhattan. The area is pretty scant and under final construction as new buildings are just opening there. This theater is on the ground floor of some slanted pyramid shaped new building near the cruise line piers. There is an upscale restaurant right next door. Other than Hudson Market at other end of block on 11th Ave - a deli across the street on 11th, the theater is way down on 12th Avenue. But it's not so bad if you are not walking in inclement weather. The staff were all wonderful! Many theaters have staff that are just there for the paycheck, it seems the staff here are happy and instructed to treat the guests like VIP's with a smile.The theater is brand new! The floors clean. No funky odors or greasy floors.The seats are fantastic.. almost full reclining plush leather like big lounge chairs that operate by electric switch on in side of arm rest. Large cup holder on every armrest.Sound and images were as good as any great theater.Inconvenient location to get to by public transportation (th M31 turns on 11th just up the block near Hudson Market, so it doesn't even make it down the long avenue to other corner where theater is). I believe I saw an indoor garage entrance on same block.Restrooms are pretty clean, so clean I decided to visit it twice.Clutter free welcoming concession stand (could get over run if crowded) and a bar area in front of theater. From what I saw it seemed all the theaters were on the same floor (#4 and #5? were just a few steps down from others, and where ladies room is; men's room in near #4).It was a nice experience thanks to the staff, its upkeep and of course how new it is. Give it a year or two and lets see how well this location is maintained. My guess the staff here is onboard and efficient and see a clean fresh theater with happy guests means job security :)Enjoy the show!",,,
19,Beau C.,"New York, NY",1,20,4,5.0,4/23/2018,"Reviewing after multiple visits to this theater. Reading other reviews on here makes my head hurt. If the location is inconvenient for you, by all means, GO TO ANOTHER THEATER. Like, no one is forcing you to choose this luxurious, boutique theater which, by the way, MULTIPLE buses have a stop within a block of. I have lived west of 10th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen for over half a decade, and as someone who knows the neighborhood intimately, The Landmark at 57th West is a beacon of light for movie goers. A lot of theaters within my proximity (which admittedly, there are quite a few) are cultural wastelands and tourist trashcans of a place to kill time. The Landmark elevates your experience instantly as you enter. The bar adjacent to the theater itself, while by no means super affordable, has a great ambiance, dutiful staff and fun selection including daily drink specials (i.e.. Mojito Mondays).The concessions for the theater are good. Nice array of options, including hot food. Be wary of ""free refills"" as they close down the concessions stand, soft drinks and all, before 10:30pm despite having late night showings. Was shocked at this on my first visit. The theater staff in general are super attentive. If they are idle and see you coming or going, they'll be sure to open any door for you and greet you. Seats within different theaters themselves appear to be different. On my first visit, the seats reclined automatically with gravity depending how you yourself leaned back. The second time I went, my seat reclined electronically with a button (this seat being significantly more comfortable). The theaters themselves are a good size, not too big or small. Screens and sound are good. Theaters are DARK during the feature presentation itself, which I love. Overall, good selection of films and I LOVE that they now take MoviePass. Game changer. The bathrooms are literally GORGEOUS also, v. important hahaha.",4,2,3
20,Olivia L.,"New York, NY",139,70,50,4.0,12/18/2017,"This might be my new favorite movie theater! The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. One guy at the front retrieved our tickets from the machine for us, and another offered to escort us to our seats inside the theater. Some rooms have reclining chairs. The entire theater is incredibly clean.Best of all, there is a bar connected to the lobby! Their Manhattan with Mitcher's Bourbon is the best Manhattan cocktail I have ever had. The chicken tenders were crispy outside and very juicy inside. You can even order food at the bar and bring it inside the theater (but not drinks).My only complaints: The drinks are a bit pricey. The apple tart lacks that flaky crust. And the location is pretty out of the way...",1,,

22,Gabe G.,"Los Angeles, CA",232,78,13,5.0,5/28/2018,Used movie pass to watch RBG here today. Absolutely loved the movie! The theater has comfortable seats with reclining backs (no foot rest) and a great snack selection that isn't the typical run of the mill food options you would find at a theater. My favorite thing about the theater is it's proximity to my apartment.,,,
23,Winn P.,"New York, NY",227,13,0,3.0,9/2/2018,"It's a reasonable upscale movie theater - because of where it's located and its interior design, it seems like it takes in more upscale moviewatchers than Landmark used to when it was at the Sunshine location. The concessions are a bit pricey and the location is also pretty far away from any subway/buses, which makes it harder to go to even with its selection of quality independent films. I'll always miss the old Sunshine theater - but I'm glad to see this one here. I'd recommend if you happen to live nearby - plus, it does accept Moviepass still!",,,
24,Juliet C.,"Levittown, NY",0,5,0,5.0,8/24/2018,"This is theater is very clean, upscale, and well managed.

28,Susan B.,"Sunnyside, NY",3,92,7,5.0,7/24/2018,"Seriously the second-best theater in NYC (Alamo Drafthouse is the best because beer). The inconvenient location is a plus as it keeps the crowds away. The seats are comfy, the bathrooms are cool, the popcorn is delicious, and the staff is kind. Oh, and they do MoviePass same-day advance reservations. (I'm probably going to regret posting this because it might attract too many patrons.)",,,

30,Jim P.,"Brooklyn, NY",664,841,861,5.0,5/11/2018,"Wow, what a nice theater. The kiosks work very efficiently with their large format screens. It also works in conjunction with Moviepass, where Moviepass sends you a e-ticket code and you simply enter that code on the kiosk.  The people are really friendly here too.  There is a large bar and seating area in the entrance that would be a nice environment for eating before or after.  The theaters themselves are state of the art with the most comfortable seats I've seen in a long time.  Not too low, with nice flexibility to lean back and ample leg room.  The size of the screen was very large, but not too far away and the focus of the movie was really very high caliber.  The aisles and seats are illuminated with numbers, because unfortunately you have to select exactly where you want to sit when purchasing your ticket. Personally, I don't like that, but everything else adds up to a really nice and comfortable movie going experience.",4,,4

Families with children can sit there as well as long as they're not sitting at the bar itself. There's a tv screen that will tell you when your movie is about to seat :-),,,
34,Stuart G.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",0,1,0,2.0,2/16/2018,"Besides being way off the beaten track, there are three additional reasons not to see a film at Landmark 57.High Price: Even senior pricing was $16. I walked 40 minutes from 5th Avenue to pay inflated prices? Whar are these people thinking.Theater 8: I only went to this theater so can't write about the others. Selected my reserved seat from chart at the box office. Right aisle seat in third (last) row. In the theater, there is no aisle. The seat is against the wall. The screen itself is not center, but set against the right wall. Worst of all, my view of the screen was slightly blocked by the placement of a speaker on the wall. This is a brand new theater. How can it be designed with sight limitations.Lighting Interference: Also Theater 8. The entrance to the theater is through a long hallway. The light in the hallway remains on during the entire movie. One patron got up as the movie started to close the door, so the light would not be in her eyes. Surprise! No door to close. So, the interfering light remained on, especially annoying for those in the third row. I do not ever plan to return.",5,4,

36,Ginsburg A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,3.0,7/17/2018,Although a bit out of the way this theater is fairly unique with it's food and bar service. Attending a movie in theater 2 I was told that my seat choice was limited to the first row A. I expressed concern that it would be too close but was assured that the reclining seats would allow us comfortable viewing. Unfortunately the seat did not recline enough to compensate for the large screen and severe viewing angle. I do not know if their other theaters are similarly designed but I must recommend caution accepting seats in row A in theater 2.,1,,
37,Haley B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,12,0,5.0,5/12/2018,"Nicest movie theater in town. Beautiful, spacious, upscale. The staff is beyond friendly and welcoming. The adjacent bar has delicious cocktails. The location is really no big deal if you live in the area or are coming by car (taxi, Uber, etc)....it's right off the west side highway. But honestly this place is worth the trip even if is a trek for you. A BIG step above any other smelly, loud, gross AMC or Regal in town.",,,
38,Logan J.,"San Diego, CA",2,86,20,3.0,4/7/2018,"Left a bit disappointed. I saw A Quiet Place in theater 5. This theater doesn't have a super large screen and the theater has a ton of rows. We sat in the last row of the front section which had a pretty good field of vision. One more row closer might have been a bit better. I honestly can't imagine sitting in the rear half of the theater. The screen wouldn't fill up much of your field of view at all. Another review mentioned an annoying light in the hallway where you exit. Absolutely agreed! The hallway light is ABSURDLY annoying during a movie. Not talking about the red exit signs, but an actual hallway light. This might be more for quiet thriller movies like A Quiet Place, but I could also hear people talking in the hallway. Annoying and takes away from the movie. The seats themselves are very nice, comfy leather, good recline, and lots of leg room (for non-electric reclining seats). NOTE: not all theaters have power reclining seats! Only the theaters with about 20 seats do. The large theaters are regular seats, albeit still good.Small annoyance: you can't refill your drinks yourselves and they don't have a lot of options. Used to the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines with dozens of options. Overall, seems like a good theater for more indie films. For mainstream movies, will stick to the UWS Lincoln Center AMC Loews.",,,

I then asked to pay for a regular ticket and she sneered that it's sold out.  The woman in front of me went through a similar experience I noticed.  I cancelled MoviePass immediately and likely won't return to that theatre any time soon.  I don't need that attitude.",,,

Like chill I'm just here for a movie. There was even an employee escorting into the bathroom and one inside to make sure I'm ok? 3) the screen was tiny. I needed to put my glasses on, it was like a postage stamp at the end of a hallway. 4) Probably the biggest annoyance was the lights. Dim was on as we entered the theater but they stayed on the entire movie. Come on now.  5) Super stupid, but popcorn butter was not self deployed",,4,
43,Heath W.,"Brookline, MA",0,2,0,2.0,11/2/2017,"I may come across as a snob but when comparing to places like iPic or Showcase Lux it doesn't hold a candle, hell I would even place it below a recliner seating AMC theater but above a reserved seating only theater. iPic is more expensive and with that you are served food and alcohol at your seat (even if that food is not the best tasting or greatest selection in the world), and yes if you are viewing with movie with an odd amount of people someone is left in a lone pod but the viewing experience truly is premium, it's just a hassle getting to the seaport from half of the city. With the lack of advertisement and information there was not much to go on, but with mention of ""local"" food and a bar you would assume that would mean it's in the theater but alas JDs bar in the lobby may be a great place to get a drink before the show (I wouldn't know how the drinks are since there was a semi private event going on) but there is a large sign prohibiting alcohol out of the bar and into the theater.  The local selections of food are a touch better then general movie theater popcorn/candy/hot dogs with options like Two Boots slices, Treathouse or Melt ice cream sandwiches (Thin Mint was delicious) but not worth it in my humble opinion. Other reviews so far (there are only 3) mention the aseptic smell and that's just because it's only been open for a few weeks and I don't think people actually know it exists and so the seats are rarely used.  Speaking of the seats they have that new car smell and are about as comfortable, not a plush leather recliner but rather a moderately comfortable seat that spring loads as you lean back ready to ricochet you out at the slightest lean forward. It's opening night of Thor a Marvel Blockbuster and maybe 10% of the seats are filled, if this trend continues the theater won't survive long...",3,1,1
44,Karen L.,"Geneva, NY",0,6,0,1.0,6/19/2018,"Everything about this theater was great, except for the EXTREMELY rude and nasty woman at the ticket kiosk named Kelly. All we did was ask for clarification on a simple issue we were having purchasing tickets. It seemed like she was annoyed that we interrupted her conversation with another staff member. It was apparent that her disrespectful attitude had been overlooked for some time by the negligent supervisor/manager who said nothing but a nonchalant ""okay"" when we informed him of her behavior. I am not sure if this is a race related issue where people of color are treated as less than, but this was the worst experience I have been subjected to by any staff in any theater by far. I will NEVER return and plan on pursuing this matter further.",,1,
45,Dan F.,"Jersey City, NJ",14,93,1,4.0,10/28/2017,"Ultra clean and modern, but antiseptic.  None of the charm of the Vaudeville era Landmark theater on Houston Street. That's a factor considering they show artsy, independent movies here.  I got shooed away for attempting to enter before their official opening time, and was advised that the doors were open only to let staff get in.  And an employee hovered over me while I made my ticket purchase at the kiosk, probably checking to see that I didn't cheat and select a senior ticket at a discount (tempting to do at these prices that approach $20.)  I'll be back because I suspect there will be other movies I want to see that aren't yet playing anywhere else,",2,,
46,Elizabeth S.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,5.0,11/5/2017,We were so excited when this opened up! It is on the smaller side and has a more limited selection; however it is so luxurious. The seats are comfortable and the concession stands carry high quality options.,1,1,
47,Jo M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,13,0,5.0,9/23/2017,"The staff is really nice. We were treated so well! The theater smells new and so good, so clean. The screens are on the small side (comparable to Film Forum) but so are the theaters so everyone gets a good seat. We sat in the second row and could see 100% of the screen. There's an online reservation system and many many showtimes to fit your schedule. The reclining seats are also super comfortable. It's a short walk from 59th street subway, maybe 10 minutes, and the walk along 57th st is nice. Lots of new businesses and public spaces along the way. I will definitely be going here again.",2,,
48,Larry D.,"Little Falls, NJ",0,2,0,2.0,2/23/2018,"These are small and rather charmless theaters with small screens that have no masking, that is, a Panavision feature will appear ""letterboxed"" on the screen.  Sound is pretty good and the property is stylishly appointed, but a warning: the largest auditoriums have seats that FORCE you into a pretty severe recline if you lean back on them at all and they cannot be locked into an upright position. In these seats sitting upright takes a conscious effort and a slight forward lean on the part of the patron, the stuff that back pain is made of.  The staff is pleasant.",2,,
49,Nicole R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10,10,4,5.0,5/16/2018,so happy about this new theater its one of the best things that happened upper west side! amazing clean best service in NYC great bar!,,,
50,Jim O.,"ARVERNE, NY",0,15,0,5.0,10/25/2017,"I might have just had the best cinematic experience of my life. Fantastic, modern theater with comfortable, spacious seating; extremely clean screening rooms; courteous staff; and a great selection of snacks and movie munchies--not to mention a bar with an extensive local draft selection!",,,
51,Anna B.,"New York, NY",4,100,22,5.0,11/22/2017,"I am confused by bad reviews on here: do people realize it's an arthouse theater in NYC, not your Apple cinema in a suburban furniture store? Just visited for the first time yesterday and am thoroughly impressed: mostly arthouse programming coupled with extremely comfy recliners (no, they cannot be compared to some place you go see your latest blockbuster 3D flick). But for a person who mostly frequents places like the IFC, Angelika, the Quad, etc., this is simply luxurious. The place is brand new and spotless, even the bathrooms are gorgeous. The on-site restaurant is a nice bonus, although the food was not great. (The salad with walnuts and cranberries had a weird-tasting dressing that was too sweet and could benefit from some vegetables besides lettuce. The warm apple tart was yummy though, and beers and cocktails excellent). One drawback it is hard to get to by public transport, as it's way out near 12th Ave. (I didn't even know there was a 12th Avenue!) but as long as we live uptown and have a car, this will be my first choice of cinema from now on.",4,1,2
52,Joseph R.,"New York, NY",1,28,3,1.0,11/3/2017,"Theatre will not seat a reserved seat show until 10 minutes before movie is supposed to start. No seating in lobby, people had to stand holding their concession items like they are waiting for a train a penn station. One group managed to spill a huge drink all over the carpet because there is literally nowhere to sit. When they did open the theatre, ushers had no clue where the seats were. They also managed to triple book some seats and created extremely annoying situation coming back multiple times asking the people beside me for their tickets. There was no lighting so you couldn't see the people presenting the talkback. To top off a terrible experience, men's room (which was working when I went into the theatre) was closed when the movie was completed. I would suggest if the film you want to see is playing anywhere else do not go here! There are many nicer theatres in the city with a staff that cares about the patron experience.",3,1,1
53,Kim C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,4.0,9/25/2017,"This theater is a hike from where I live in Brooklyn, but was one of only two in the city showing WOODSHOCK so my friend and I decided to check it out. Some of the fine print on the reserved tickets was a little baffling (seating in complete parties only, in a movie theater, with digital tickets?) but the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and showed me in to my seat and held my friend's ticket for her out front when the MTA held her up a few minutes past previews start time.The theater itself was lovely, and the seats were very comfortable. Price point for reserving recliners is a little high compared to other comparable theaters, but it was nice to be in such a brand-new space. The restroom and bar were both really nice, and everything was super clean. I'd definitely recommend it to people living in the area, and will go back myself if they continue to show some of the harder-to-find films.",,,
