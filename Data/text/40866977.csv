0,Courtney C.,"New York, NY",359,110,40,4.0,4/19/2017,"Really liked the vibe here! It's close to my office, and perfect when you just want a cup or pot of tea and somewhere low-key to relax. The food looked great, but we didn't try any. I would recommend for a coffee or wine break, or a quick bite. My only complaint was about the service. With so few people in there, you would think the service would be better, but we had to ask for menus, ask for refills, flag someone down each time we needed something. The tea didn't come with sugar or milk, and the waitress acted like it was an inconvenience to her. I did like how they put the check in an old book. Great touch!",1,,
1,Danielle A.,"Manhattan, NY",31,16,8,5.0,8/1/2017,"The food at Mae Mae is super fresh and delicious. I work close by and come for lunch often. I highly recommend trying the Poke Bowl, grilled cheese, and tea cakes! The tea selection is also awesome. I honestly don't think you can go wrong here.",1,,1
2,Chris F.,"Stratford, CT",1,49,0,5.0,2/22/2018,"Went for lunch today & it was excellent.  The food was fresh & creative. I had the grilled cheese of the day which was fontina, onions & pastrami.  It was excellent as was the strawberry iced tea.",1,,
3,J H.,"New York, NY",4,147,24,3.0,9/6/2017,"Very pleasant staff, nice portions, a little on the expensive side. The quinoa salad bowl was actually a large amount of kale, with some quinoa and vegetables. They should rename it.  The pork and ham sandwich was delicious. The Cuban Sliders with Slow Roasted Pork, Caramelized Ham, Gruyere Cheese, Thunder Pickles, Whole Grain Mustard, Cuban Roll was hot and tasty. The $15 was a few more than I would have liked, but it was very good.  For dessert we ordered the peach crumble cake with homemade ice cream. It should have been warmer but who cares when it has such good butter pecan ice cream. This was our second visit and we look forward to more.",,,
4,Cyprus B.,"New York, NY",19,6,5,5.0,7/20/2017,Had lunch there today and it was stellar.  First off the SoHi Slider cocktail was unbelievably good.  So refreshing and packs a nice little punch.  The service was quick and pleasant.  And the FOOD.....OMG.....soooooo good.  I cant wait to treat myself again.,,,
5,Devon O.,"Brooklyn, NY",114,195,459,1.0,4/26/2015,"In a way, it was my fault, because I had chances to get up and leave but I did not. My first chance was when our waitress tossed the menus to the table and said we could sit there, second was when our waitress to go back and fourth checking several items on the menu only to find there were two dishes left at 1pm, and the last was when she never came to ask if we wanted drinks, it was ""what do you want?"" Others were a bit smarter than my party because they had barely sat down before they left.My party had the pulled pork sandwich and the grilled cheese,  because that was all that was left and we had to return from a lunch break. The pulled pork sandwich must have been sitting waiting for someone because the pork was lukewarm,  coleslaw topping was the same temperature, the bread soaked to where my fingers would go through it.The grilled cheese itself was good, this seemed freshly made, but It would have been much better with the bacon that was supposed to be on it.If I could give it one & a half stars I would, the half for the grilled cheese that was served incomplete. Not returning.",1,1,
6,Sally E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,9/4/2016,"I went to MaeMae for the second time last week for a client lunch. I had a Lobster Roll and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!! So delicious. The last time I went was in Dec 2015. I had the Chicken Pot Pie. I'm drooling thinking about it right now. The prices for this Farm to Table are not outrageous at all.  The only thing I might complain about is that the staff is too attentive. Just kidding. They are great too. They are the perfect amount of attentive. They come over at his the right time to fill your water without totally interrupting your conversation.  They give you time to finish your meal & they do it without glaring at you making you feel like you are taking up space that a new customer should be occupying.  I cannot wait to have that Pot Pie again. Again, I'm drooling as I'm thinking about it.  Go to this restaurant!! It's the one with the painted Llama out front.",,,
7,Michelle W.,"Brooklyn, NY",549,223,89,4.0,12/10/2014,"Whenever I go to the always-packed, girly girl cafe, Mae Mae, for lunch, my initial thought process is a multiple-choice question like the following.Pick the letter that best describes the name Mae Mae:a. the name of the colorful llama that stands outside;b. the sound that the colorful llama that stands outside makes;c. the nick name of the child that loves the colorful llama that stands outside;d. all of the above;e. none of the above.My favorite answer is C. But in reality, the answer is probably E, since I don't know the story behind Mae Mae's happy existence. All I know of Mae Mae, is its delicious, amazing, praiseworthy, and definitely-will-keep-you-coming-back, organic and locally-grown food. Although on the small side, the ever-changing menu is full of a variety of comfort food. Lots of veggies. Lots of bacon. And lots of cheese! My most recent favorites are the grilled cheese, chicken pot pie, and macaroni and cheese. Desserts are mostly winners but those change often as well.Mae Mae's tea list is also a never-fail must-try.",1,1,
8,Tammy K.,"New York, NY",71,218,19,3.0,12/20/2015,"I used to love the lunch banh mi and salads, and just returned last week after a six month hiatus - the chicken noodle soup was lukewarm and the grilled cheese looked interesting but was rather uninspiring in taste. Perhaps it was an off day, but it may be a while before I try Mae Mae again.",1,,
9,Susan O.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,72,11,1.0,10/29/2015,"The food is just so disappointing. My fish was overcooked, sent it back and they gave me another overcooked piece of fish that was still raw inside - guys, stop cooking it WHILE IT'S STILL FROZEN. Just tell me you're out.Ugh.",,,
10,Julie S.,"Jackson Heights, NY",94,113,2,3.0,9/15/2016,Went for lunch. Veggie burger was ok - a little bland and stingy on the goat cheese - but the pickled veggies were amazing. Delicious cookies and great coffee!,,,
11,Jewel Y.,"New York, NY",33,776,3421,4.0,2/24/2011,"This cafe bar is such a cute spot to come by during lunch break! The space is adorable, it makes you feel like you are in a quaint and rustic enoteca in Italy!  My co-workers were raving about this place and now I know why! What I love about this place is the charming Euro-chic atmosphere, the interior is tastefully adorned with red walls,dark woods, and arched gold mirror. This place is very popular among those who work nearby and is always busy so make sure you come by 12pm to secure seats.Besides the cute ambiance, what makes this place so popular is reasonably priced meal made of fresh ingredients. They offer various sandwiches which is about $9-$12, and I enjoyed the roasted pulled chicken panini with argula, tomato and basil mayo. So far everything I had here was tasty, including the coffee. French onion soup was authentic, but I don't think it's available all the time.I highly recommend this place for a casual inexpensive lunch at a fancy cafe. Check it out!",3,1,3
12,Katie M.,"Minneapolis, MN",156,63,0,5.0,1/28/2015,"Oh, wow. I'm on a business trip to NYC and knew after a long (and early) day of travel, I'd be starving when I arrived, so I researched good restaurants within walking distance of my hotel (FourPoints by Sheraton). I'm so glad I did! The atmosphere of this place is enough to give it 5 stars. Small and cozy, with warm colors and bottles of wine lining the walls. It feels a little like a cozy little coffee shop when you walk in. I ordered the grilled cheese (bourbon apple compote, applewood smoked bacon, tumbleweed cheddar cheese). Holy sh*t. It was huge. I thought to myself.... ""there's no way I'm eating all that."" But I did. I did. I ate every last bite. One small negative of the place (but not negative enough to dock a star) is that the service is a little slow. But they're super friendly, so.. oh well. If I stay in this area again, I would most certainly come back. TIP: The menu said that they have live music every Wednesday night at 7pm!",1,1,2
13,Carlito D.,"Rockville Centre, NY",0,25,1,4.0,9/9/2016,I like this place.  Staff is always pleasant and food is fresh and yummy.  Also iced green tea is excellent.,,,
14,Shana B.,"Seattle, WA",396,81,41,4.0,3/23/2014,"Came here for lunch one day when Westville was full. I LOVE this place!  It's small enough to keep a really cozy, homey vibe, but not too small to accommodate a full lunch crowd.Our waiter was super attentive. At his recommendation, I got the chicken pot pie. I couldn't even remember the last time I'd had a chicken pot pie. I think it was stouffer's? Or maybe it was a hot pocket that I'm confusing with a pot pie? They've just never really been my thing, but he insisted that it was a favorite among the regulars.Yo. The pot pie was EVERYTHING. I did not want that thing to end. The crust was amazing, the filling was amazing, and I would have eaten either of them independently. I don't even remember what my other two friends ate. I think one was a fancy looking pizza and the other had some kind of sandwich. They said they really enjoyed it. But in that moment, nothing in life mattered besides that pot pie. Student loans, credit card bills, being unemployed in a matter of weeks, finding true love... suddenly these existential worries fell by the wayside. I don't even remember what I was talking about. You should get the pot pie.",4,6,
15,John D.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",507,61,689,4.0,4/25/2014,"Slightly hipster place, offering up simple food (fresh as a motha!) and a simple drink menu. Good lunch spot with unique and what would seem like hand-picked ingredients. I would go back.",2,1,1
16,Christine B.,"Queens, NY",82,185,293,3.0,11/15/2014,The service is slow but the food is worth the wait. Must try the chicken pot pie. Kind of small but it's so savory and delicious.,,,
17,Shu Jin S.,"New York, NY",129,880,5,4.0,11/12/2011,"If I was only rating the food, I'd give Mae Mae Cafe a full 5 stars. The Chicken Panino was delicious and the homemade Iced-tea lemonade hit the spot. I still can't get over it's taken me 2 years to discover this place, when my office is right around the corner! You can tell the food is farm fresh, it just tastes better. The decor is adorable and it's very cozy. I wish the service was a little more attentive, but (to be fair) I did arrive at 12:30 and every table was filled. I think the key is to come for an early lunch to avoid the crowd. Or, if you're looking to take the food truck route -- which, is pretty popular in this area -- they own the Katchkie truck that is tucked into the Hudson Square Courtyard (Note: It's in a parking lot, not on the street).",2,,2
18,Jess P.,"Hoboken, NJ",219,195,35,4.0,9/1/2013,"I love Mae Mae Cafe! I work around the corner so I have been enjoying their food for a couple years now - this review is clearly well overdue.The place itself is super cute. The staff has always been nothing but the best. I came in for breakfast recently and my friend wanted the veggie burger.. I know who wants a veggie burger for breakfast? Well she did.. haha Usually you wouldn't expect them to have prepped all the lunch menu items at breakfast but they were so accommodating and happily made it happen for her. I myself had their breakfast sandwich... uhhh so good. They just opened for breakfast in the past few months I believe so the majority of my experiences have been with lunch.They change their menu seasonally which can be tough when you find that amazing thing you want every time from then on out.. luckily they never disappoint when you are in need of a new favorite menu item.Most recently I had the BLT and it was delish. Their food is all farm to table and you can taste how fresh it is. Past favorites were caesar salad, curried chicken salad sandwich, the weekly paninis and grilled cheese never disappoint either. Definitely check it out if you are in the Hudson Square area!",2,,
19,Howard G.,"Suffern, NY",15,8,1,4.0,11/18/2014,"Wow. I think that may have been the best grilled cheese sandwich I ever ate. The chef was our waiter today - she was incredibly helpful about the food and enthusiastic in making sure that we got what we liked - to the point of offering samples. The broccoli and cashew soup was also superb. I look forward to making this a regular lunch spot. It was busy and the wait took a bit, and the food came out a bit staggered, but if I could give 4.5 stars I would.",,,

21,Melissa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,3,0,2.0,4/10/2013,"A total ripoff. The lunch salad special was the smallest Greek salad I have ever seen, served on a side plate. Their sandwiches come with a bigger salad! When we told the waitress that we were expecting something a little more substantial, she said she'd get the manager. The manager never came. Instead, the manager told the waitress to tell us that avocados were $3. Well it turns out they left off the feta, so who owes whom? Customer service is not cost awareness. Go over to the table and try to make the customer happy. I had been here before, but never again. Overpriced and arrogant. You'll get a much better salad at Hale and Hearty for half the price.",4,2,1

Updated review","It is as good as the first time....as it is the millionth time around.  This place never disappoints!J & I hit up our usual lunch spot... less than 5 minutes from our office.  Convenient?  Yes... loves it!  Don't hate...just say you'll participate as well, in the lovely goodness that Mae Mae brings.  It is truly, an unparalleled dining experience, one that unravels with a simplistic order,  grilled cheese & soup combo that changes DAILY.  Today's special included gouda and two other cheeses, with scallions on marble rye, with a cup of French onion soup.  We about died and went to heaven.  To add to the overindulgent, we got the beet salad (my personal favorite) to share.  We just about finished everything....and still not a single pound gained.  J is lucky, she is tall & thin and never has to worry about gaining weight!      I quickly fall in love all over again, with its most coziest decor, rainbow colored llama intimately tucked tables next to one another.  Good things do come in tiny packages.  We hope they don't expand... Mae Mae's is tiny but it is the perfect sized cafe for us.",,,1
23,Lucy M.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,227,41,4.0,9/11/2011,"Mae Mae is one of the few good places to eat within short walking distance of my office.  I usually come here for lunch because their sandwiches are great.  Recently they have started offering happy hour so I decided to give it a shot.  All of the cocktails and wines are only $5 and they are totally worth it.  The cocktails are delicious and the wines they offer are of good quality.  No 3 buck chuck here.  On top of the drink specials, they also offer a few snacks for under $10.  My friend and I shared the white bean dip with vegetables and this was completely yummy and worth the $5 price tag.  The portion was huge and could have easily been dinner for one person.  I will definitely be back for happy hour!",1,,

26,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",1265,277,389,4.0,5/27/2010,"Seriously, since moving to NYC I have not stopped eating at great restaurants. Of course most of that is due to Yelp's wonderful advice. A part of me feels like I give out WAY too many 4 & 5 stars. Am I becoming a star slut?! Please don't think that if you woo me with just one great dish that I'm gonna dish out all my pretty little stars for you, it's not like that. I'm not that kind of girl! (well, maybe I am) What can I say? My taste buds want what they want. Anyway, back to the review. This a beautiful & wonderful little lunch cafe in soho. My mother was visiting & we had to go shakedown a man for money, so we got hungry. I have to say that the curry chicken salad was out of this world and I can't wait to go back!",1,4,1
27,Stacy G.,"Hoboken, NJ",51,12,2,5.0,2/11/2013,"My gosh, the food here is excellent! The butternut squash soup is so ridiculously tasty, it's amazing. I also like the sandwiches (they come with fresh greens in a light dressing). It's such a cute and cozy, clean, and interesting place. The service is good, too. But the place is just so tiny. You may have to wait a while if you decide to go there during lunch time on a whim. They also pair you with others at the same table (served separately, though) if there isn't enough room.But I definitely recommend this place. I have been there more times than any other restaurant since I moved here. I love bringing my family members or friends here when they visit.",,,1
28,Nitza J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,4.0,5/6/2016,"I work nearby and some of my colleagues raved about this place so I decided to try it out for lunch with a colleague.

29,Jess C.,"New York, NY",594,305,582,4.0,2/11/2012,"Like everyone said, the decor is quaint and adorable. Lots of dark cherry oak wood furnishings and a whole wall of (Strand) books you can read!! And the waitresses were in costume too. But best of all, it was Jazz Wednesday! The piano-bass duo were superb!The food itself was above average. I had the chicken pot pie which was a little bland and the crust was a too thin/flakey for my taste, but my friend really enjoyed her sandwich. This place has a ton of sandwiches and paninis so I think it'd be a great lunch place, but it's a little light for my dinner.This place is definitely out of the way but if I'm in the area, I'd definitely come by to give their food another chance!",2,,
30,Chad R.,"New York, NY",232,473,8,5.0,12/15/2014,Just ate their latkes from the latke festival...and it was the best! Cardamon apple bake and pickled ginger on top of latke with creme fraiche. I cant wait to visit them for lunch.,,,
31,Jenny K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,98,57,4.0,2/24/2016,I worked a street down from this place for a year so went here a lot for breakfast and lunch. Their breakfast is good - typical egg dish. Their chicken pot thing is really good for cold days - delicious puff pastry and broth-like dish.,,,
32,Yi-Jin Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",130,11,34,4.0,10/19/2014,"One of my favorite sit-down cafes in Hudson Square! The menu is a seasonal rotation and they're always spot-on and delicious. During my most recent visit, I tried their ""Fall Grilled Cheese"" which had apple slices and bacon - the perfect balance of sweet and savory! My friend paired hers with a thick tomato jam soup and definitely received her stamp of approval. The only thing to keep in mind is that Mae Mae service can be more relaxed/slow so don't come here if you're looking for a quick bite! It's a bit on the small side and can get crowded during weekday lunch. Fun touch: checks come in used books and the cafe has an old-school, traditional library look-and-feel that's not stuffy at all.",,,
33,sarah h.,"New York, NY",31,29,0,4.0,10/20/2011,"Yum! Cute lunch spot if you're in this 'hood: i love a lunch counter when eating by myself, i appreciate the local-food focus, it was quick and delish, and the waitresses wear odd headgear, which contributes to the quirky ambiance. Last things first: they had this peanut butter sandwich cookie that is so good it turned around an otherwise difficult day.The mac n cheese is scrumptious, though a bit oily at the bottom. i just left that bit, as i had already consumed more calories than i probably needed for the whole day. I also hit their Squash Festival, so tried the soup and squash salad trio, all of which were excellent.",1,,
34,Bloss C.,"Jersey City, NJ",769,1081,2521,2.0,2/22/2011,"Two stars sounds harsh, but I think 3 stars would be dishonest.  The service here is usually pretty bad.  There is either an uncomfortable wait for a table, or they run out of many items on the menu by 2 pm.  On my last visit the normal hostess was not in and we were rudely ignored by the staff for 10 minutes before they even told us it would be a few minutes before there was a table available.  My real gripe with this restaurant is how I feel afterwards... always heavy and greasy.  Their salads tend to be slightly overdressed, but I would recommend the salads over everything else.  The sandwiches are ok, but avoid the Mac and Cheese because it is a big bowel of grease.  The iced tea specials are good.",2,1,
35,Tash R.,"Manhattan, NY",19,214,160,4.0,10/2/2011,Great find. Toasted cheese sandwiches are the way to go. I prefer mine with some form of meat. Menu changes all the time so always interesting!,,,
36,Arian A.,"New York, NY",38,57,0,2.0,6/23/2011,"I've been here twice for happy hour.The first time was an extremely pleasant experience. The place was pretty much empty so it provided a nice, ""cozy"" spot to escape the 6pm horrors of NYC. The drink specials are also fantastic. I'll take 5 bucks for good, quality wines any day. At the end of happy hour (our apps were also fairly good) I spoke with the waitress about my office coming in for happy hour the following week...The major problem with all happy hours in NYC is that they end at 7pm. We were coming on Wednesday which is apparently jazz night and were told because it was a special music night that the happy hour lasted until 8pm. No one in my office is rarely out before 6:30 so happy hours ending at 7pm are actually pointless and not at all very ""happy.""  I chose this venue COMPLETELY on that statement so that my co-workers would have a chance to actually enjoy an hour of happiness. The evening of our office happy hour is upon us. 15 of us gather around the bar and are having a jovial time until we were told happy hour had ended.  I was confused because not enough time had elapsed for it to be 8pm. Oh, it's 7pm. When I protested this (isn't it kind of barbaric just to make something like this up?) and explained to the staff we were told 8pm the previous week I got blank stares and ""uh, yeah sorry."" We had a crowd that was doubling their business, kind of a bad move if you ask me. My boss even made mention of it because on a separate occasion she had dined there and had been told the EXACT same thing. I would maybe consider returning again if I was desperate for a place to go for happy hour and had no other options but that kind of service is extremely off-putting and frankly quite dumb. They should really inform their staff of when their actual happy hour ends because it was a disaster and displayed a major organizational flaw on their part. After we all discovered that happy hour had in fact ended, no one really had any desire to stay and pay full price for drinks. It is unfortunate because the 12-15 of us would have probably hung around and generated a LOT more business had they held up their end of the bargain. We would have also been more inclined to return since our office is across the street. But, I digress. So, to wrap up, there will be no more office happy hours at Mae Mae. However, based on the other reviews, it seems like your lunch hour is safe from being cut short. So, carry on.",1,,
37,Julia Z.,"San Diego, CA",21,143,12,4.0,10/21/2011,"Love this little jewel in the south village. Came here for lunch during the week and it was packed at 12:30. We had to wait a little for a space, was then seated at the bar but then later moved to a proper table.The decor is a combination of bookstore and french cafe. So cute that you will just have to see it for yourself!I tried their Oct Squash special called Salad Trio. For only $7, you get a small warm root vegetable salad, a baked pastry and a small bowl of squash stew. if you like variety, this is the perfect dish for you. And can you believe you get all this for just $7? Amazing!The only downside is that we had to wait a little while for our food. Other than that, it was just perfect, so you bet that I will be a regular here!",,,
38,Wing L.,"Long Island, NY",202,245,78,4.0,12/20/2010,"I actually heard about this place from my co-workers, each giving this place a positive review. I just had to try it!  Walking in, the atmosphere is small but  vibrant and definitely has character. (the bill is given via a book-which I thought was unique)  This place can get packed so be prepared to wait but waiting time is sufficiently cut short if you speak up and decide to share a table with someone (highly recommended).Their menu changes often so every once in a while, so it's a treat to see new items on the menu.  For lunch, I've had their salmon burger and the tuna sandwich--both delicious and just the right portion. I did hear a lot of people around me rave about the grilled cheese sandwich (which is quite fancy, so don't be fooled!)  I think one of their specialties is their ""soup of the day"".  I had the winter squash soup--delicious and creamy, perfect complement to the winter cold!  Atmosphere/food was good...but deducting a point because service can be a hit or miss at times, due to a lot of people dining/waiting.  Sometimes, I do feel like i'm in a ""dine and dash"" game, as the waiters try to get us in and out as quickly as possible.Overall, I'd come again to see what their next soup will be!",1,1,1

40,Vic C.,"San Francisco, CA",331,265,30,4.0,3/7/2009,"I seriously have a thing for little wine bars, French bistros and cozy cafes. It totally rebels against the claustrophobic in me. I think it's the years in Berkeley that's done it to my system. Screw the corporate giants and all that jazz. (Despite my love of Target, Costco and disgusting enjoyment of PF Changs). I know. I'm ashamed of myself. That said, Mae Mae totally sets me straight. Cozy, laid-back and just plain comforting. When the wind's a-blowing and I think my ears will fall off the moment I walk outside, I just slip across the street to grab some comfort food and a glass of wine to take the edge off. Their sandwiches are served warm and totally hit the spot on a cold day (or any day). I'm a fan of their (totally upscale) grilled cheese or grilled veggie sammies. See, I still have some Berkeley in me.",,,

The ingredients are ridiculously fresh and always seasonal and local, coming from Katchkie Farm just upstate. The preparations bring out the best of the stellar ingredients, and the vibe is chill and cozy in a little library/den-like room. Recommended dishes are the pot pie, the warm lamb sandwich in lavash, the cuban sandwich, the Cobb salad, and usually whatever soup they are serving. I work in the area and although they don't deliver, you can order takeout, which I do frequently. I definitely recommend it!",1,1,1

I went a couple of months ago and the service was off and my food was just okay. I thought it was a fluke. But then I went again last month and it was still disappointing. They used to have a pizza special but now they changed it to a flatbread and it's no where nearly as good. I don't know if the management has changed - I don't recognize the staff. I would still plan on going early if you're going to lunch because it still fills up quickly.,,,
43,Robert B.,"Richmond, VA",0,12,0,5.0,6/24/2014,We had lunch there. The menu was fresh and interesting. I had the baked grits which was as good grits as I have had. Others had the grilled cheese with red beet chips. We had the glazed snap pea appetizer which was good. The wait staff was attentive and knowledgable. We will be back.,1,,
44,Nelia V.,"New York, NY",0,14,0,2.0,10/22/2012,"This place had such a sweet and cozy decor and very efficient waitstaff. Too bad the food was sub-par.Their chicken noodle soup was no better than the stuff you get from a metal bucket in the back of a bodega. The kale and pumpkin salad sounded great in theory, but the kale was old, coarse and inedible, and there was very little of it on the plate. The pumpkin was greasy and flavorless. The whole thing just didn't work at all.I felt bad for the friendly waitresses who had to dispense this terrible food to the clients.",,,
45,Dien M.,"New York, NY",1,27,0,5.0,4/4/2012,"Not a bad little neighborhood joint! I wouldn't mind being a regular.This place is tucked away a few blocks from the Hudson River in the Soho/Tribeca area. It's a little hard to find, so you have to look for a bright pink llama resembling those loud, colorful cow sculptures. I arrived just after the rush, which was Tuesday at around 1:30 or 1:45.This tiny restaurant is known for fresh salads and sandwiches and a few grilled menu items; thusly, they have one stovetop in their front kitchen, replete with a few large toaster ovens for grilled food. I think there's an oven for bigger cooking jobs in their back kitchen.I dig the one stove-top setup. It feels like a proper New York apartment with a tiny kitchen.The staff know their food. That's because the restaurant owns a farm upstate that provides their fresh, in-season ingredients. That's one of their great selling points - they say they're ""only one of two restaurants in the city"" to own their own farm.That being said, they're also REALLY good at chatting people up with that particular selling point. Having worked in the food industry before, I usually put on a blank, unimpressed look on my face when a waiter (or any retailer, for that matter) tries to upsell their goods to me. But the fact that this place actually does own their farm and there seems to be a feel-good family camaraderie in this neighborhood cafe usually frequented by locals (I say that because three different waiters asked me, ""you're not from around here, are you?"") I will definitely come here again. So that was the gist of the atmosphere.The food was fantastic. They are known for their teas and they have a special tea concoction every week. I had their blackberry lemonade. I started with a carrot and beet salad, which had mixed greens, hazelnuts and a light drizzle of vinaigrette. That was followed by one of their specials, a scallop dish with a savory butter cream and peppered with bacon or pancetta. And I had to have their old-fashioned chocolate cinnamon cake, which was light and fluffy with just the right amount of cinnamon (for me, cinnamon is one of those spices that can easily be too overpowering from one too many pinches).Some perks: Apparently they have a live band on Wednesdays. There's also a sign that says they host private parties. Good thing to keep in mind.I left feeling very satisfied. I hope you do, too.",1,,
46,Erica L.,"New York, NY",60,310,0,4.0,7/4/2010,"Great lunch spot!  Fresh food, lots of variety on the menu, great service, cozy atmosphere.  I have never been disappointed with anything here and would completely recommend it.Knocking off one star because it's slightly more pricey than other places in the neighborhood - can't come here too often!",,,
47,Ceasar B.,"San Francisco, CA",25,199,4,4.0,8/11/2012,"Had a BLT the other day for lunch and it really was a good sandwich. Of particular interest was the they include a slightly runny egg on it and the sourdough bread. Not much else to say I think-- it was obvious the ingredients were fresh and high quality. Overall, was pleased.",,,
48,Andy G.,"Palm Springs, CA",14,66,0,4.0,7/7/2010,"Wow.  The Ear Inn was closed, so we were walking over to Chipotle for the old lunch standby and came across Mae Mae.  The restaurant was cute, cozy, and reasonably priced!  I saw the Turkey Cobb on the menu and went for it... natch.  When it came out, I was pretty impressed.  It was the perfect size for lunch.  The roasted turkey breast was warm and sliced thin but definitely not deli meat, this was real turkey from a real breast that had come out of a real oven (recently).The greens were mesclun and the dressing was a 27 year old Sherry Vinaigrette.  Instead of the usual crumbles of blue cheese, there was a little wedge of a beautifully veined bleu (not sure of the variety) it was firm and slightly crumbly but had a creamy flavor and a nice smooth texture.  Additionally there were two strips of freshly fried bacon, a perfect quarter of an avocado, a quarter of a chilled roasted yellow pepper, and five tiny perfectly globular grape tomatoes.  The absence of the egg and onion was actually refreshing here.  The dressing really took care of those things I think.  A definite place to return for a wonderful Cobb Salad.",,,
49,Rick S.,"White Plains, NY",6,29,3,3.0,8/26/2010,"Mae Mae's atmosphere is very charming, and the food is always interesting and very good.   I had to deduct one star though, because after a 40 minute lunch w/ client, I was pretty much asked to leave with a passive agressive  ""Will you be needing anything else today?""  3 minutes after I paid my bill, with an obvious wink, wink, nod, nod to a couple of customers waiting patiently to get seated.   I understand that Mae Mae's are not a diner, and space is limited there, and they need to seat  other paying customers, but I wasn't egregiously loitering in their restaurant and the hostess really made me and my guest feel like we were.    It was annoying to me, because I've been there so many times, have waited upwards of 30 minutes patiently to be seated myself , all the while watching other patrons chit chat well after their meals had been eaten and paid for.     If you want lunchtime conversation and don't want to feel rushed, then don't go to Mae Mae's.  If you insist on going there, then don't ask for the check  immediately after completing your meal and keep asking for tap water or order a coffee so you can comfortably sit at your table and finish your conversation.",,,
50,Stephanie G.,"New York, NY",1,53,0,2.0,6/3/2012,"the food was okay but this place has a nerve-racking atmosphere and annoying kitschy decorations that are supposed to be charming but are actually just imposing.to make up for my attitude, the cake was delicious.",,,
51,Meredith R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,1.0,4/11/2013,"I was going to bring a group here for a going away lunch tomorrow, but after hearing Melissa H.'s story I will go elsewhere. $8 for a salad that turns out to be a side? I used to love coming here too...",1,1,1
52,Liam D.,"Brooklyn, NY",111,41,101,4.0,2/20/2012,"I truly enjoy this little cafe. When you approach the doorway your greeted by a brightly colored llama. As soon as you enter the smells of toasted bread hit your nose. With great books and fine wines surrounding you while you eat, you can't help but have interesting conversations if only about this gem of a cafe. Waitstaff is knowledgable and very polite. If you would like to have a small event here you can if booked in advance. Normally gets busy around 1:30pm.",,,
53,bethany r.,"Queens, NY",4,77,53,4.0,7/31/2011,"This is my favorite ""special"" lunch spot near my work to go with colleagues or, as I just did, with my dad who was visiting from out of town.  It's very cute and the food is always fresh and  delicious.  This time we split the turkey Cobb salad and a grilled asparagus sandwichl.  It was more than enough food and very tasty.  The staff is friendly and attentive...just make sure you get there early if you want a table Mon-Fri.  It fills up fast and the turn-around is not quick.",1,,
54,Cara C.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,65,0,3.0,1/9/2007,Great little cafe (accross from my storage unit) with fabulous decor and good food.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.Very good chicken pot pie and bellinis (not in that particular order or pairing).Give it a go if you are in the area.,4,,
55,Mel C.,"New York, NY",22,53,0,3.0,5/17/2007,Don't be scared by the psychedelic llama outside! This place is wine bar and cafe in one with wine-on-the-bookshelf decor. Their paninis are pretty good and well-priced for lunch.Points off for the waitstaff's disorganization and constant attempts to upsell throughout the whole meal. I just want to eat in peace without multiple people constantly asking me the same questions about whether I want to spend more money.,3,,1
56,Elisa K.,"Miami, FL",83,170,35,4.0,8/29/2008,When you see the multi-colored llama you know you have arrived. The place is small but mellow and has a nice vibe. They have cool specials everyday... but it takes a minute to get your food. I recommend the  grilled cheese sandwiches.... they always put something interesting in there..... its nice for lunch with friends or a chill dinner.,2,,1
57,Liz E.,"San Mateo, CA",58,104,8,4.0,3/17/2011,"Yummy yummy yummy! This was a WONDERFUL place to go for a laid back, filling lunch. My curried cauliflower mac and cheese was so filling that I took half home and am currently eating it as a late dinner -- it is even delicious cold and eaten with a coffee stirrer (no forks where I am right now...). I loved the selection of teas, and would go back in a heartbeat to try any of the other simple yet innovative items on the menu.",1,,
58,Mandy F.,"Manhattan, NY",11,80,0,4.0,2/11/2012,"Finally stopped here for lunch since it's so close to where I work. The beet salad was great. My friend got grilled cheese and it looked good too. A solid, quick lunch. Will come back. I wasn't in the mood for their tea/lemonade blend but it sounds great. 5 star potential...I need to try here again.",,,
59,Reupbert T.,"New York, NY",0,18,0,4.0,10/21/2008,"Phenomenal cafe - their menu is seasonal and features locally, organically grown ingredients when possible. Their soup de jour was hot-and-sour soup featuring tofu and what appeared to be buna-shimeji mushrooms. Along with the soup I also had their grilled cheese, a lox-stuffed blend of cheeses toasted inside pumpernickel bread. Fantastic!Wait staff is attentive and welcoming.",1,,1
60,Georgia K.,"San Diego, CA",51,95,2,4.0,4/22/2011,"My friend works nearby and suggested Mae Mae for lunch and a glass of wine. We went around noon on a Friday and were seated quickly. The atmosphere is super cute and Euro. The prices are reasonable. The food is yummy. I LOVED my grilled asparagus panini. My only complaint was that our waitress was a bit snappish. But the tasty food made up for it. Mmmm.... asparagus panini. All in all, Mae Mae's was a win.",,,
61,Monique C.,"New York, NY",26,76,5,5.0,10/6/2008,"By far, one of the most chill spots in the Soho area. Small in size, but really big on character. The cozy lighting and wine racks on the wall would normally signal a pricey spot, but with such a great menu and ambiance, the pricing is ridiculously reasonable.Not to mention that this place, hands down, has the best pot-pies. Next to your momma's, of course.",,,
62,Rachel H.,"Chicago, IL",43,291,1,4.0,10/14/2010,"this is a nice little spot for a work lunch.  it's just the right noise level so you can ignore your co-workers if they're blathering on and on about something you honestly don't care about.  also, we waltzed in there with 7 people and no reservation.  for a small-ish place, they were very accommodating.  we were sort of hurried out as there were a number of people waiting after we finished our lunch, but hell we had to get back to the office anyway. the food was pretty good.  there's a grilled cheese - soup combo plate that's pretty delish.  the grilled cheese was ricotta, cheddar, roasted red peppers and radicchio.  it was really yummy.  the soup of the day was a lentil, which was just so-so.  under salted, over carrotted.  prices were fair.  and there's a psychadelic llama statue out front.",,,
63,A B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,29,0,1.0,3/29/2013,"Not sure if they got a new chef or if they were just having an off day, but I just had the saddest grilled cheese here. boring wheat sandwich bread, a single not-fully-melted slice of muenster, and some portobello. For a $10 grilled cheese, I expect something a little better than what I can throw together at home - I mean, it was worse than what I'd throw together at home. Also, the service was horrible.",,,
64,Christina R.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",404,280,169,4.0,6/13/2012,"I really enjoyed my lunch at Mae Mae Cafe. Mae Mae offers a cozy interior that's somewhat European feeling, with book lined shelves,  incredibly fresh tasting dishes,  and friendly service. I enjoy the occasional dining experience by myself at a café. It may be anti-social, but sometimes it's just nice to sit with a book, have someone serve you, and watch the world go by. I don't have to listen to anyone else, just savor the meal. Besides indulging my inner French person while reading in the café,  the food was really fresh and tasty. I ordered the Italian wedding soup and the grilled zucchini panino . I never rave about soup, but the soup was so flavorful and delicious,  and the goat cheese on the panino was orgasmic.  The menu is seasonal. There are great vegetarian options. Tea seems to be very popular, however I didn't have the chance to try it (next time). I really loved that they give you the bill inside a book (over thinking the experience I questioned why they had selected the particular book they did for me). Mae Mae is a great business lunch or casual date spot, and of course it's a great place to read a book by yourself.",,,
65,Sonya N.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,22,0,4.0,10/13/2012,"I love the food here, and the staff is friendly. I do have one BIG complaint though. Every time I eat here, after I leave my clothes STINK. They don't seem to have any ventilation, and it seems like all the food is cooked IN the restaurant with hot plates or panini presses or something. I work right around the corner, and I would eat here more if they had a proper ventilation system.",,,
66,Laura D.,"New York, NY",2,94,0,3.0,7/25/2010,"Love the atmosphere! Very cozy and sweet. Delicious tea and nice comfort food.

68,mary l.,"New York, NY",237,327,9,4.0,9/15/2009,Mae mae cafe serves simple but flavorful food in a tiny library like atmosphere.  The greens and meat are all provided from local farmers 100 miles away or less and the simple fresh quality ingredients' flavor really shine through.  The cobb salad for $14 and the veggie sandwich $9 are my two favorite items.  The portion sizes are ok; regular New York style portions but I do think it's a bit $$ for just a regular lunch.,1,,
69,Katerina V.,"Hoboken, NJ",6,1,0,4.0,9/9/2010,"Amazing place for lunch! Love their Peach and Burrata salad and Strawberry Shortcake. Although Mae Mae is a bit pricey and isn't open for dinner every day, the atmosphere here is quite charming and perfect for events.

70,Sharlene C.,"Brooklyn, NY",72,668,84,3.0,8/8/2011,the spot is tiny so if you plan to have lunch witha  party larger than two i would recommend making resies.  i was with a party of 5 and had to wait about 15- 20 minutes for a table.  the space isn't very inviting for large groups.  i'm not so sure about eh frilly has that the waitresses don but the food is good. i had teh chicken pot pie which was creamy and the crust chewy and flakey.  i felt lik the service could have been a little better for sucha  small space had to flag down for the order and the bill.  funny enough i'm going back on thursday for another work lunch.  i'm not too peeved about it and looking forward to trying soemthign new off the menu.,1,,
71,John L.,"Brooklyn, NY",99,32,0,4.0,8/11/2010,I live in an apartment with a kitchen  that is smaller than the bathroom and sitting down to eat means im doing so on my bed. For those reasons I eat out practically every meal. Today I ventured into Mae Mae Cafe and I was completely in love from the moment I got there. The place is small and quaint with great service. The menu choices all sounded delicious but where I really won was after the food arrived. My girlfriend and I shared two of their specials and both make it on to my top 20 things I've eaten while living in this city.,,,
72,Susan B.,"Bridgewater, NJ",0,30,0,4.0,9/10/2010,"I am a happy woman today because I ventured into Mae Mae for lunch after reading the many good reviews posted on yelp.  The decor is warm and welcoming, and the food was really good.  I sat at the bar and was offered a taste of the raspberry and basil iced tea by the friendly bartender , which was so refreshing that I immediately had to order a glass although I normally stick to water.  I chose the Cobb salad, which was excellent and very filling.  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I am going to try one of the sandwiches that looked so good as they were devoured by other patrons seated at the bar.  Unlike two other restaurants I've been to recently , the paninis were properly prepared and had the requisite grill marks!!!",1,,1

74,Erin D.,"San Francisco, CA",6,19,0,5.0,5/20/2009,"This place is absolutely adorable, and it's a great place for a sit-down lunch. First, the decor: bookshelves well stocked with charming old volumes and tea kettle sets and wine bottles; a nice bar at the back of the room, with tables tucked into the window nook and a little alcove at the back of the room. Every day they have a number of daily specials: grilled cheese, soup, pizza, iced tea, lemonade, and other entree items. The menu is otherwise limited but tasty--I particularly like their homemade mac and cheese (also good to share as a side) and chicken pot pie with root vegetables. Their most unique menu item is their ever-changing grilled cheese option, though, and I usually enjoy the grilled cheese-and-soup combo. I only wish they were open for dinner more nights a week, but they are open for lunch every day.",,,
75,Kriti G.,"Jersey City, NJ",42,2,0,3.0,3/2/2011,"Overall I like going there for panini's . I ordered their french onion soup and I have to say that I have had better! I dont think they have a kitchen so everything you order is sort of heated up in the microwave on counter next to the bar. Surprisingly, their sandwiches are really good and I love the vegetable chips they serve with it. Prices are average -- I like their wine collection - will have to try that someday :)",,,
