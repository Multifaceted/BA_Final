0,Penelope L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,1,3.0,11/17/2018,"I want to give this place 3.5 stars... but I'll round up. The place is just OK. The food was good. We had chicken wings with chili sauce, mozzarella sticks (they were a little overcooked), a shrimp wrap and a salmon burger. However, my salmon burger was brought to the table after all the other food had already been brought out. The waitress didn't even bother to give us an estimate on the burger, we didn't see her until she brought it to the table 5-7 minutes later. My boyfriend and I didn't start eating until my burger was out because.. table manners. The kitchen also did a poor job on plating the food. The chili sauce was poorly distributed over the wings, the avocado on the salmon burger slid right out, and the mashed potatoes were plopped on a flat place alongside the shrimp wrap... like come on. As someone who waited on tables for three years I was extremely bothered by this. It was highly unprofessional of them, it's not like the place was busy. Wouldn't tell anybody not to go but just to be mindful of the service. This place would be perfect if the employees were held to a higher standard. SN: the busboy was attentive and quick. Thank you.Ps: my boyfriend got sick from here. Might've been the mozzarella sticks not sure but he was sick all day and night.",,,

The sticks were almost fully hollow. The cheese must have been over cookedMacaroni & cheese was super cheesy goodness. I think baking the dish and a little seasoning would have added a lacking flavor.Lastly, the Rueben . Not my favorite. Open faced, pile of meat & cheese in soggy bread.I know understand the meaning of kitchen Sink menu. The menu is extensive and cater to the masses.",,,
2,Elle B.,"Newark, NJ",60,125,565,3.0,9/15/2018,"Hmm mixed reviews...too bad I didn't see the ROACH pic beforehand, I probably would have passed! But my first experience ordering via Seamless was decent. Very juicy burger, a little bit unseasoned but good nonetheless. Had Wyoming burger with provolone onions BACON, bbq. Medium well. They were pretty generous with the food, extremely full pretty satisfied! This is a diner so they have a plethora of  food to order. Although I didn't have a bad experience, the roach thing caught me off guard! I mean, let's face it, like it or not, some restaurants have ""critters"", I have worked in enough to know this. But I feel that regardless of the busyness of an establishment someone should take care to see what kind of food is leaving the place! To discover an insect or ANYTHING on your food is absolutely disgusting. I feel really bad about that other persons experience and it has made me feel ambivalent about ordering from here again.That's my piece.....",,,

However, when I tried to order French fries as take out I was shocked at what I saw. I'm super over dramatic about bugs but I absolutely hate cockroaches! After a long debate no refund was issued!! Awful absolutely awful. I really don't care about how small it is, it's the principle.",1,,
4,Devan M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,1,1.0,10/26/2018,"Came here for a quick bite while I waited for my reservation at a different restaurant. I ordered disco fries to be split between 3 people, and in a relatively empty restaurant for a Friday night, it took 20 minutes to bring THIS out. Bad service, really bad food. To be fair I didn't try anything else on their large menu, but my experience was bad. Go to one of the many other good restaurants in the surrounding area.",1,,
5,Mike R.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/18/2018,"Looked like a great little place to take the wife and kids after a concert in the park...not so much. My wife ordered a burger which came with a side of coleslaw. Inside that little clear cup of coleslaw happened to be a roach. I calmly walked to the manager and took her aside to show her what we found. She apologized and the waitress came over to see what was going on and I explained to her calmly so that no other customers would know what's going on. I was informed by the waitress that the manager was extremely sorry for this, and then was handed the bill which was for everything! Can you believe they charged me for the roach? Not wanting to make a scene with my children there I paid and got the hell out. Gross. I messaged the business on Facebook and Instagram and gave them 3 weeks to respond to my inquiry before posting this review.",1,,
6,Master R.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,8/16/2018,"Do not order from here and expect your food to show up on time.. we ordered expecting our food to be delivered 30-45 minutes later and it took over an hour and a half for our food to get delivered. We called multiple times and every time the same person picked up the phone and said ""it's on its way"" without giving us any other information or even asking what order was ours.I do not recommend ordering dinner from here. Hopefully they have a better in person dining experience",1,,
7,Sha-paris M.,"New York, NY",3,1,1,2.0,6/12/2018,"I decided to try a new place for breakfast.Scrolled through seamless and tapped on this establishment. Their menu is impressive, all sorts of delicious entree options and eccentric side orders. Before I placed my order I looked at their yelp reviews which left me a bit skeptical, but I decided to judge them for myself so I ordered from them anyway.I ordered *French toast with mixed berries*Turkey sausage*Home fries*Cheesecake Everything was delivered within the time frame that was estimated.The food was packed neatly with the add-ons I requested(syrup, utensils etc...)The French toast was pretty cold. The berries however were fresh and delicious.The sausages were delicious.But the HOME FRIES were some of the worst home fries I've ever had in my life. I didn't know it was possible for home fries to be depressed. I feel like they gave me the scrapings from the bottom of a restaurant refrigerator. The home fries looked and tasted as though it was late on its rent. It's been an hour and I'm still just surprised how someone could do that to a potato.I haven't tried the cheesecake yet but I'm hoping it's nothing like the home fries.",,,
8,Ashley C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,1,4.0,10/2/2018,Came here with a couple of friends for a late night food run. They accommodate our party of 6 along with food restrictions nicely. Our waiter was very cheeky and patient as two people at our table had to find dairy free and vegetarian options. Food came out on time and was your standard diner style. Ordered the Lemon Chicken with mash and brocolli and it didn't disappoint. Overall good experience and would probably return again after grabbing drinks nearby.,,,
9,Darwin H.,"Tucson, AZ",136,29,13,3.0,6/27/2018,"A great selection of food and open late-night for food after working late and walking back from college, but dependably slow service and mediocre taste. A friend enjoyed their buffalo wings and fried chicken, but I've generally not-really-enjoyed the food I've ordered here. However, if you're hungry around 11pm, and want to grab a bite and decompress sitting down, this can be a solid place to eat and take it slow, and is in fact one of very few sit-down places open at such a late hour. As a result, I have been here many times in 2016-2017, and while the food wasn't great, the experience hasn't been bad either. In short: Good for late night sit-down eats, but slow service and meh food.",,,

11,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,118,0,3.0,12/1/2017,"The Kitchen Sink is pretty cute for a diner! In fact, it doesn't look like a diner at all...But it has the huge menu that you would find at any diner. The server asked us immediately if we were in a hurry (we were on a lunch break at work so we were) and took care of our checks right after we ordered. Greatly appreciated this. I ordered the portobello salad- it was alright. They claimed it was served with ""mixed greens"" but it really wasn't. Looked more like some odd form of iceberg lettuce. Diner food in general is usually not too exciting (except for breakfast) so I will say my experience here was fairly satisfactory.",,,

I will keep coming here until the day I die, but there is something about this place that's just so.... average. It's not pretty on the inside, the service isn't great, the food is good but not great...yeah, it's one of my go-to spots, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone looking to experience the fullness of NYC food.",2,,
13,Jamie L.,"New York, NY",9,1,0,1.0,10/21/2018,I have never met any servers this rude. The worst person is the bartender. I would avoid this place at all cost. Don't understand how they stay profitable,,,

I mean... it's only right, so I ordered the pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs.  It's a nice place, but I was pretty disappointed with my pancakes.  I like to think of myself as a pancake connoisseur, but these were to the standards of an average suburban diner.  The weird thing about them was that they didn't look burnt at all, but they tasted burnt; as if they were cooked on a grill.  Maybe their non-breakfast foods are better, but I most likely will not be back :/",5,1,3

16,Devon C.,"New York, NY",114,17,6,1.0,3/25/2018,"This place was stumbled upon by a hungry friend and myself. It looked cute and had a bit a variety because we weren't sure what we wanted. We ordered the chips and guac to share. It was just fine, it needed salt, the chips were just the same. My friend ordered the turkey burger with roasted tomato sauce and arugula for herself with fries. She took bites and looked  so unbelievably disappointed and said ""this is not good."" I decided to try a bite, it literally tasted like they took ground Turkey formed it and left it on a grill until it totally dried out. There was no hint of flavor it didn't even seem like they put salt and pepper on it. We spent the rest of the time debating whether or not to send the inedible burger back. We decided to just let it go, pay and be on our way. We hoped this place would be great but it's just not.",,,
17,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,3.0,11/29/2016,I thought this place was A-OK on a Saturday evening for a quick bite. Tuna salad wrap with a side salad was good. Friendly and attentive server. One of the better craft beer lists I have seen at a diner joint.No major complaints at all. Place has a nice decor and clean. Like a classier version of a diner.Men's bathroom is the size of a coffin though. If you are claustrophobic and need to take a dump be prepared to go into panic mode.,9,6,7

22,Kelly B.,"Huntington, NY",190,176,113,2.0,2/19/2017,"Came here for breakfast after dropping a dog we're fostering down the street @ SocialTees NYC rescue.It looks really cute and cozy from the outside. It's a big place and it boasts breakfast lunch and dinner. Service was quiet but attentive. We were likely the first customers of the day...music wasn't on until we were mid-meal.We had about 35min to eat. I will say the positives are that the food came out promptly and we were out of there in the perfect amount of food. Of course, if I actually ate my food, it may have taken a bit longer.Coffee was great, and just what we needed on an early Friday morning.Food was not.I ordered the oatmeal and a side of corned beef hash. The hash tasted like what I imagine Alpo dog food tastes like. The consistency was awful - there was a film of gross crusty slime over it, like an omelette egg makes almost. And it tasted horrible. Actual Alpo? Poor dogs.The oatmeal was watery and tasteless. And I get that oatmeal is like that before it gets all fancied up. No options to add brown sugar or fruit. I added maple syrup...a lot of it...and was able to take a few bites before throwing up my white flag.My boyfriend got the french toast and sausage. That was acceptable, at best...and honestly tasted like heaven to me post-alpo and watery oatmeal.We picked our foster back up about 12 hours that night and saw that it was a little busier and that most tables had milkshakes...if I had known, that would have been my breakfast.Since we foster often and may be looking for a breakfast spot that opens before 8am, we may be back, but I may stick to coffee....and maybe also have a milkshake.But I don't see myself heading here out of the blue or suggesting it to anyone.",1,,
23,Danielle F.,"Newport Beach, CA",298,31,17,2.0,2/9/2017,The name of this place should be Kitchen Stink. The food is God awful. The service is mediocre and the design is like every other NY restaurant bar. I don't know how you an make food so bad. If you're going to get anything go for an omelet or a quesadilla. I ordered the chili and it was a bowl of just oil. So nasty and so happy I didn't take a bite I could have seriously burnt myself.,,1,
24,Al S.,"Las Vegas, NV",284,1,0,1.0,7/28/2018,"Came here on a lazy Saturday looking for some typical diner fare: eggs, sausage and pancakes; what I got was anything but. Although the ambiance of the restaurant has a certain aesthetic to it, the food is reminiscent of my grade school cafeteria. Scrambled eggs that were barely cooked, running on my plate; sausage that was severely burnt and flavorless. The buttermilk pancakes lacked any sort of fluff or taste to them-I might as well have been eating cardboard. Only come here if you want a decent looking place to post on a Snapchat story; for those who enjoy eating food, look elsewhere",,,
25,Tori K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",118,7,0,5.0,4/25/2018,"Loooove this place. Very cute restaurant itself, food is always delicious and very well presented. Not to mention the variety on the menu. Anything from their griddle menu is to die for, love the calamari, the quesadillas, and their milkshakes. Their fried Oreos are also sooo good but I've gotten super sick both times I've ordered them (but honestly that might just be me because my friends haven't gotten sick off of them). Whenever I have company in town I like to bring them here.",,,
26,Kavi W.,"Manhattan, NY",19,37,0,1.0,8/23/2017,"Awful food. I ordered wings and they tasted like they were deep fried and smothered in Frank's hot sauce. Also, the wings were dried out, either from overcooking or reheating. The blue cheese dip tasted like the store-bought kind and has been mixed with water. In New York City, I always take a chance on wings, because you almost always experience a uniquely different way of making them and I never expected this.I am not sure how they have business with such sub par food in East Village where there is so much competition.",,,

28,Danielle B.,"Mission Hill, Boston, MA",0,7,12,5.0,5/20/2017,"I have lived in NYC for a couple years now, so I feel weird saying that my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE restaurant is a diner. But it's true. Kitchen Sink is so stinkin' delicious.I was just reading through other reviews to see if everyone else loves this place as much as me, and I was flabbergasted to see that wasn't the case. They're all nuts if you ask me!I've had a couple dozen meals here between dining in and delivery, and I can honestly say I've never had a bad one. The Kitchen Sink may very well have the BEST cheeseburger in Manhattan. Crazy, right? Who would have thought? Their french toast (both plain and cannoli-stuffed) is also TO DIE FOR. Even their coffee is spectacular (and arrived piping hot in my delivery order this morning -- impressive!!!!).I bring anyone who comes to visit me to this place because it's that good (they always say, ""We're in NYC... why are we going to a diner?"" and by the end they always say, ""Now we understand. This place is AWESOME.""). I honestly never want to leave the East Village because I'll be further from this place.",1,,
29,Lynda K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,4.0,3/13/2018,I order takeout from here all the time since it's so close to my apartment and have to say it's one of the better diners in the neighborhood. A bit overpriced but the food is solid and there's a huge selection. I'm a huge fan of the Fandango Salad and their burgers are very good too.

30,Kate S.,"New York, NY",10,13,8,2.0,1/24/2018,"This is one of the worst places you could accidentally walk into while finding a place to eat in east village. Me and my boyfriend stumbled upon this place and decided why not try it! We got seated right away and stayed seated with no service for about 10 minutes. No water, no nothing. I was not doing well because I do not have patience but my boyfriend has a lot and convinced me to stay. The waitress finally came over and took our drink order and food order. I asked if she could make a skinny girl margarita and she said yes, of course! She really assured me with no hesitation that she knew what this entailed. I honestly had no business even ordering this in a place like this but I did anyway because you know how it is. Tryna be healthy, tryna keep the calories down, I thought what the hell. I get it and it has GOLD TEQUILA. Gold tequila is my nemesis. I do not like the taste and I gag when I think about it. (Prob from those wild college days, you know). I was not going to suffer through it so my boyfriend drank it and I had his beer. The meal was terrible. The food was rubbery. I felt like I was eating the rubber fake food you have when you are playing ""kitchen"" as a child. Not pleasant. The service was actually awful and the waitress was fighting with the host the entire time. They have a good amount of tables and there was one waitress for all of them. Also the bartender was not helping with any of the drink orders coming from the tables. She was only tending to the bar which I know that's what a bartender is but when it's crowded and there are two people at the bar help the waitress out!!",,,

My Fiancé has had the pancakes and breakfast quesadillas which I've tried and enjoyed. On our last visit I had some fresh fruit to accompany my Avo toast and it was also very good.

Our main meals were just as awesome I got a buffalo chicken wrap just enough hot sauce not over powering or to bland, my brother got a California omelette which was really got crazy amount of cheese :-) and the girlfriend got a chicken quesadilla which was huge she took half home even after we all shared it.

I had a burger which was okay, and was a little ticked off when the waiter asked, ""And you want fries with that,"" as if it were included in the price. It wasn't, and I called him out on that. The beer selection is good, the turkey burger was good from what my girlfriend said, and so was the quinoa spinach salad. This isn't the place for you if you are looking for a trendy East Village type place, but if you need a quick bite this might be what you're looking for. Great name though.",,,
51,Zandra B.,"Manhattan, NY",4,16,0,3.0,1/13/2017,Really depends on what you order from here. The chili is overly greasy but the chicken Cesar wrap is delicious. Found a hair in the nuggets I ordered last time.,1,1,
52,Jason W.,"Bronx, NY",15,84,2,4.0,2/22/2016,"I used to think of this place as an unprofessional diner in an awesome location; but now that its status post remodeling, I'm really feeling it. I work crazy, often erratic hours; and my girl works late into the night; and Kitchen Sink can deliver an extensive menu, mixed drinks made better than your average dive bar, and food that is consistently good at all hours. Honestly, I've been impressed lately: fettuccini chicken alfredo and a hugely-proportioned tuna melt paired with whatever white wine we had tasted great at dark:thirty. After a long day (and night) at work in a state of hunger, I'm no longer reaching for my laptop for seamless to get Moonstruck. I'm now going to Kitchen Sink to eat and drink like I deserve it. The Moonstruck ---2--- Kitchen Sink makeover is a success.",1,1,1
53,Jayme J.,"Manhattan, NY",7,7,0,1.0,3/5/2016,Food is not very tasty and service was extremely slow. Terrible experience. Don't waste your time with this place. We're in NYC and there a lot of choices. My friend had a Diet Coke. It was 1/4 full. The waiter poured water into the cup. When my friend told the waiter he gave a disgusted look to my friend and returned with a fresh glass with a lemon in it. Just a lemon in an empty cup. This is the last time we come here.,1,,
54,Tessa M.,"Manhattan, NY",290,23,1,5.0,11/12/2015,"Moonstruck got a makeover! Kitchen Sink is great - we went in around 4pm on a Saturday and sat at the bar (great selection of craft beers) and enjoyed some of the best nachos I have ever had! The owner talked to us for a while, super sweet and personable lady who made us feel right at home.We will be back!!",2,,
55,Brandon W.,"Encino, CA",190,4,1,5.0,1/28/2017,Ordered 4 different sandwiches via Seamless and have loved all 4. Always comes fresh and with tasty fries. A really dependable neighborhood spot!,,,
56,Shannon B.,"New York, NY",16,144,53,3.0,12/27/2015,"Came here for breakfast on Saturday.I was happy to see that Moonstruck had been replaced and that a new spot appeared.The menu is super extensive and I'm excited to come back and see what else they have to offer.Their breakfast menu has the usual fare and more!For today's selections, we chose: peanut butter pancakes, huevos rancheros and breakfast quesadillaPeanut Butter Pancakes - I'm not a big pancake person, but, I liked these a lot; the peanut butter aspect of the pancakes was just that it came with a side of peanut butter and a knife; for some reason, I thought the peanut butter would already be spread onto the pancakes when the plate arrived, but, it was not. Not a big thing though.Huevos Rancheros - a couple of tweaks to this dish that made it unlike any huevos rancheros I've ever seen: roast pork on the side and rice; the roast pork was a little lacking in flavor as was the rice; however, it was topped with a most delectable tomatillo sauce, so, that took it up a notchBreakfast Quesadilla - pretty standard; flour tortilla, scrambled eggs, pepperjack cheese and bacon; the dish was perfectly fine, but, the real standout was, again, that tomatillo sauce and I also asked for some pico de gallo on the side that was very flavorful and spicyDefinitely would give Kitchen Sink another try as I feel that, from the reviews, they can do better and that there's a lot of good stuff here.",,,
57,N. S.,"New York, NY",0,37,32,3.0,2/17/2016,I liked this place better when It was Moonstruck . The service was slow for it not being anywhere near packed . I ordered  the signature burger which was not as full flavored as I hoped. They forgot to add the avocado (which was what attracted me to the burger In the first place) and still charged me for it. Also had a bee sting drink which was nice & strong but a little  overpriced for the size.,,,
58,Debbie E.,"Miami Beach, FL",11,15,5,4.0,8/14/2016,"Great salad that I was able to mix and match with chicken.  Large, tasty salad!  My husband ordered the burger with fried onions, which he really liked.  Good, tasty, inexpensive food with great service.",,,1
59,Papilindo C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,76,0,2.0,5/8/2017,"Sunday 5/7/17. After Church @ Middle Collegiate Church, one block up.I have walked pass on a number ocassions and wanted to try this place.The photos on here for the salads looked nothing like what I got.I ordered the cobb salad with salmon and the whole order didn't reach beyond 1/3 of the bowl. I thought maybe the salmon had weighed it down but, when I moved it to the side and looked it was a small hand full of salad greens. The salmon was done nicely but, the dressings need more flavor.My cousin ordered the sausage pepper and onion hero on garlic bread with sweet potato fries. She enjoyed her meal.Not sure what happened with my meal although others around us had ordered the same salad and they looked impressive.I was just fresh out of church, enjoying my cousin's company and conversation, and didn't  want to fuss over it.I will try back again and hopefully have a better experience. This would be a great spot to host small church meetings since it is so close but, the food and service have to be up to par.",,,
60,Eliana A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,1,1.0,5/7/2017,"Ordered an extremely simple meal: scrambled eggs with ham and potatoes, and soup on the side. While the order was delivered early, there was NO ham, which was later refunded, the eggs were undercooked and watery and the soup was lukewarm and bland. I wouldn't recommend.",,,
61,Bj B.,"Jersey City, NJ",30,71,40,4.0,6/18/2016,"Lovely staff. A comfy,friendly atmosphere and freshly prepared food at good prices. They have everything, hence the name ""Kitchen Sink!"" We enjoyed the roast turkey which was moist and plentiful. The stuffing tasted homemade and there were real apples in it. The mashed potatoes are also real not the boxed kind. Salad was fresh and crisp. Chicken Soup was like homemade. Even the hotdogs were ""very gorgeous"" as our non native English speaker remarked! A true gem in this otherwise pretentious neighborhood of ridiculously priced "" gourmet""specialties. Give me good old American food freshly made any day! I'm whistling Yankee Doodle Dandy as I walk out!",,,
62,M M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,1.0,9/11/2017,"Okay...I have lived in the EV for 20 years and pass the place all the time and always notice the filthy windows.  Sunday night I wasn't feeling great n wanted pancakes so we googled pancakes n this came up n we said lets go try it.  So we walk in and the interior of the place looks like weird 70s n not cleaned since the 60's.  Still, maybe this was gonna be a hidden gem in plain sight?   Full bar but they did not have a bartender and no one there could make a drink.  Food was sub par diner food.  My bf had garlic chicken that looked like baby food , he said it was edible n finished every bite, he's a guy.  I had banana pancakes that were okay n hash browns that just tasted like nothing and were left untouched.  The longer we sat there and looked around, the more the dirtiness of the place took a toll.  You can tell the manager was disinterested n servers just trying to do the minimum.  .Food quality not there but total Quantity if that's what u want. - I.e. Huge plates. It makes u wonder who would own a business on 2nd and 5th and let it go so drastically.  Would not recommend to anyone and besides the prices are fitting with the east village so why go there when u can pay the same amount at a better place.  Make sense?",,,
63,Joanne S.,"Selden, NY",2,30,18,2.0,5/11/2016,"Judging from the other reviews I guess the breakfast is ok. Whatever you do don't come here for lunch. The chicken was dry and pan heated, Obviously  Cooked previously and warmed up.  The presentation was crude and unappealing. The service was fine. Friendly and attentive. The food?  With all the cute places to go don't decide to come here.",,,
64,David G.,"Forest Hills, NY",152,19,1,1.0,5/1/2016,"Food isn't good enough to withstand such poor customer service. Man who answers the phone is rude and miserable. Ordered for delivery and it took more than an hour. If you're hungry and decide to order from here, you might as well make your own dinner, eat, shower and take a quick nap before you should expect it to arrive.",,,

67,Emma B.,"New York, NY",69,8,0,4.0,11/15/2015,"As far as New York diners go, this one is pretty good.

I requested a refund through seamless and was told that the restaurant refused to give me a refund. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. They will take forever to send you food that you can't eat. Not a good way to manage a business.",1,,

75,Meredith P.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,4/25/2016,This place is freaking amazing!! Three of us went and not only was the waitress adorable but I couldn't believe how much food we got for $77!  And the food was so freaking good!! Omg!! The calamari was one of the best I've had (I'm Italian so trust me on this!) I got the chipotle chicken quesadilla and I literally ate the entire thing.  The fish tacos and friend goat cheese balls were so good- not greasy and lots of flavor. Portions are huge and the vibe of the place is fun. We will definitely be back!!!,,1,
76,Jessica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,112,10,3.0,9/12/2016,"This place is pretty average especially for a diner. The prices are nice considering other places in the area are pricey but again its a diner so the food was pretty basic. I didn't love their salads but their other menu items (diner classics such as burgers and fries) are pretty good. Their fries in particular are pretty awesome. They do have a lot of options which is nice and most of their ingredients seemed fresh. Their service is a little lacking but again, its a diner.",,,
77,Brian G.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,3.0,5/30/2016,"What once was moon stuck, is not the same. Service was a little slow, there was no host/hostess. It seems more pricey as well, but the food was fairly good.",,,

79,Daniela T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,3/1/2016,"I order from this place more than twice a week because its on my meal plan and i don't think they've ever gotten my order correct and I never order anything crazy (I know better than that). Also, the wait time for deliveries is usually way over an hour for locations less than 5 blocks away, but they never tell you that when you call. Its not even like this place is so over crowded or anything. Theres no excuse!",,,
