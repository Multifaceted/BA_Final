0,Sunny T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",335,128,27,4.0,10/28/2018,"Oh wow, did 12 Chairs impress me! To be completely honest, I was expecting it to be another one of those Mediterranean spots with average-tasting but stellar Instagrammable Shakshuka... boy was I wrong.Made a reservation, 'cause at this point almost all places require one on any given night. Curse us New Yorkers who have turned dining-out-with-friends into a downtime. 12 Chairs is a small, yet intimate and simply-adorned restaurant. Our server was attentive and the food and drinks arrived promptly. Let me be clear that I didn't order the Shakshuka, although it definitely seemed to be the most popular dish in the room. Instead, I opted for the Arayes - grilled pita filled with minced lamb, served with a small side of cherry tomato & chili pepper salad + a bomb tahini sauce. The pita was perfectly crispy on the outside, almost as if it had been fried, but so damn fluffy on the inside. Tahini was creamy and had a dollop of harissa for that extra kick. And the side salad was refreshing - spooned some of that on the pita for a perfect bite. Just wished there was more lamb filling, 'cause, ya know, gains. There were four small triangular pieces of the pita, which were deceivingly filling. Although I definitely would've kept eating if there was more. Friend got the Stuffed Cabbage with ground chicken, rice, and veggies and said it hit the spot.Successful meal? No doubt. Will I be back? No doubt.",,,
1,Cansu C.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,17,15,3.0,11/17/2018,"Though the food was very good, service was quite bad, hence the 3 stars. Our server forgot about things we asked for on a few occasions. We asked someone else in the meantime and he also didn't get to it. A cup of coffee I ordered sat on the bar for quite a bit before we reminded someone that we are waiting on a coffee. Same thing with pita bread and napkins. That all said, I got the schnitzel salad and it was very good. It's slices of schnitzel on Israeli salad with a generous amount of a light tahini olive oil sauce. We also got hummus to start and it was delicious. It comes with super fresh hot pita bread. Definitely recommend the food but prepared to be patient with the service.",,,
2,Lital J.,"Queens, NY",147,7,10,5.0,10/1/2018,"Best best best place ever. Amazing spirit,food served quickly,clean and service is helpful.One of my favorite place in the city.Highly recommended!!",,,

Rosé you can go on home (jk, still love u).Most dishes were $11-$19 and the dishes looked quite good from what I saw others ordering in the restaurant. The place is fairly spacious even though it looks smaller from the outside, and the ambiance is cute. So overall, a lovely little lunch spot in Soho. :)",6,2,2
4,Noor S.,"New York, NY",20,220,107,4.0,8/27/2018,"Service and food were great. The lamb kabob is to die for! Salad was simple, baladi and pita (both wheat and white) were excellant. The hummus had a heavy consistency of tahini but the mushroom, onions and meat topping made the dish flow better together. Great spot!",,,
5,Akansha B.,"Manhattan, NY",258,325,179,4.0,7/18/2018,"Really cute/casual Middle Eastern spot and we were full fast!  Ordered the Israeli guac and the meat hummus, both were absolutely delicious.  Loved the eggs in the Israeli guac and the beef in the hummus - both felt like a meal and we were definitely too full to order anything else.Mint lemonade was good - a bit too sweet, but that's ok. Service was great!  No complaints.  Might come here for lunch one day to try a falafel or their lamb burger",6,,4

7,Esther C.,"North Miami Beach, FL",5,15,32,3.0,8/11/2018,"We came here because friends recommended the place. It was very quite, thought it would be a happier vibe. I liked the decor but it did not seem very clean. The server had a little attitude too. We ordered coffee which was okay. French fries - it was a generous portion. Arayes - was so delicious!! Juicy, perfectly cooked and really just delicious!! Shnitzel salad-which I got a little after my husband, the chicken breast were not cooked well at all! I had to send it back and waited for a new one, and obviously that also took time, was nothing really special to be honest. I asked if I can have pickles in the salad and the server said he'd bring me some on the side - which he did not mention was an extra $3.00 so that annoyed me - would have been nice to know that before. We got Malabi for dessert and we did not like it - we are Malabi lovers so we should know when we have a good Malabi or not. I'm rating this place an overall 3 stars because the Arayes was delicious. That's about it :)",,,
8,Jennifer R.,"New York, NY",418,354,3232,4.0,12/22/2017,"The short: super cute Mediterranean spot with great food & a relaxed ambience. The longer: this little spot serves some of the best Mediterranean food in the area. I've been a bunch of times-- the salads are all really delicious; the hummus is next level yummy; and their pita is on point. I also love, Love, Love their Israeli salad. Most recently I went with a friend and she did the $14 lunch deal- soup and a sandwich... which is awesome. I did the shaksuka and it was good... but the service was a bit slow on my friend's meal, and I waited to be polite, so my eggs got cold. I'd skip the eggs next time and go for the hummus or lunch food. Overall, though... great spot, cozy and good for intimate convo. I also appreciate that you never feel rushed in here.",5,1,3
9,Ellie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",156,151,400,4.0,12/23/2017,"I was craving Israeli food so I decided to go to the place that takes me back home! The food here is really good. Its a Mediterranean-Israeli cuisine. I got the chicken schnitzel with fries and chopped israeli salad. The schnitzel was huge and of course I finished it! The chopped salad was like the chopped salad they serve in israel! We also got the sabich sandwich on a ciabatta bread. This comes with fried eggplant, hard boiled egg, tahini and other fixings. Absolutely delicious! Again got it with a chopped salad. For dessert we also got an apple pie that was just the right amount of sweetness. Comes with ice cream.  Its an amazing place for lunch in my opinion and honestly the food is bomb The lines are long during the weekend but for lunch I had no problem to be seated promptly The service is average.. it's not fast but it's not slow Very pricey in my opinion though. Would be a sort of splurge for me and not a weekly thing Would recommend.",2,1,1

12,Dean A.,"New Orleans, LA",21,4,1,5.0,10/1/2018,"Stumbled into this place and its warm inviting atmosphere drew us in. We tasted several of the Israeli wines with bartender I believe was Gabriella, and they were all delicious. She was very welcoming and helpful. We were hoping to sit at one of the two outside tables, but it was getting too late. We ended up in Rosem's (and I apologize to both of you for probably not coming close to getting your names right.) we started with the beats, my wife had the shakshuka and i had the schnitzel. Service food and wine were all a fantastic surprise. We'll come back next time in nyc!?",,,
13,Charley K.,"Ann Arbor, MI",89,277,0,4.0,5/30/2018,"For a laidback, unpretentious Mediterranean meal, it's hard to go wrong with 12 Chairs. Being in Lower Manhattan, the space is small, so the bigger the party, so earlier you'll need to arrive to avoid lines. I like that the menu is extensive, with plenty of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. I went for dinner, and ordered the lamb burger. I was very impressed by this dish. For one, the burger was juicy, and did NOT fall apart upon first bite, unlike other lamb burgers I've had. The red pepper aioli added a nice tang, and the ciabatta roll was crispy, and well absorbed the sauce and juices. I also appreciated the fries. They were more like potato twigs, thin and crispy. So tasty! I also saw that my friends ordered the pierogi, which also hit high marks.Now, is 12 Chairs groundbreaking? Far from it. It's typical Middle Eastern fare. But as a reasonably, tasty meal, it delivers.",1,1,2
14,Shelly C.,"New York, NY",28,47,86,3.0,9/27/2018,"Before everything I will say, I'll have to admit their falafel is the best I've ever had. It is soft and warm, without being oily. It is flavorful but not overly seasoned. The pita that came with it was freshly baked. It was warm and fluffy and I definitely loved it. Ok, that's all for the good part.I went at 2pm on a Saturday. It was packed, but the wait was not that bad. After 15ish mins we were seated. However where we sat was the hallway to bathroom, and the pathway was so narrow that people kept knocked me on my elbow to just get to the bathroom. And the place was so loud that I could barely hear what my friend said. The waiter didn't write down our order so he had to come back to confirm what we want...Anyway we got our shakshuka. I don't really understand the hype for it at any brunch spot. I mean, it basically tastes like tomatoes, maybe a bit spicy tomatoes, but that's it. I didn't taste any depth of flavor in it. The lamb kebab was burned. It was not the nice burn you can find on BBQ, it was the bitter black substance that tastes like triggers for cancer. The meat inside the burned shell was actually juicy, but the burnt she'll just overshadowed anything good about it. Also notice that lamb kebab is not the kebab on the stick you maybe thinking about. It is patties on pitas with tahini...Two stars for the food in general, one added star for  the falafels and the value. I'llbably come back to have hummus and falafel takeout cuz I'm such a sucker for good falafels. Other than that, I'll probably stay away from this place.",,,
15,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,4/20/2018,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a Monday night around 9. There were a few other tables there, but we were easily seated right away.After perusing the menu, we decided to split a few things:Hummus and pita (3.5 stars): This was a solid dish, but nothing that blew me away flavor-wise.Mini lamb kebabs (4 stars): I really enjoyed this lamb dish as it was spiced really well and paired nicely with the pita.Cauliflower (4 stars): This dish had some nice flavors and was a good-sized portion.Chicken schnitzel (4.5 stars): This dish was absolutely massive. It was literally two HUGE pieces of chicken served with a side of greens with their famous honey mustard dressing and it all was delicious together.Apple pie a la mode (3 stars): We ordered this to finish the meal and it did not have any particularly strong flavors and actually wasn't very sweet.Overall, this place is another nice Mediterranean option in the area. Service was friendly and attentive and food came out quickly.",3,,1
16,Mira S.,"Brooklyn, NY",121,864,1707,4.0,5/2/2018,"Takeout was good, everything seemed fresh and it stayed hot for a while. The falafel weren't too dry, and they stayed crispy even sitting in the hummus. The staff was friendly. The cafe seems like a comfortable space, fairly quiet, not too big or too small. They take phone orders and the food was ready very quickly, at least for a simple order like hummus and falafel.",1,1,1
17,Raquel A.,"Manhattan, NY",1470,179,1102,1.0,3/4/2018,Absolutely the worst service ever. Came here and put down our names for a table for 1230. We left and came back at 12:25 they had us waiting till 1:20!! Half of our party left because they didn't want to wait. We were willing to wait but the host let in so many tables ahead of us that were not before us. It was extremely unprofessional and rude. I have had way better shakshuka at dizengoff in chelsea market and even effies on uws. Please don't bother wasting your time for this place.,6,1,1
18,Sydney T.,"New York, NY",90,73,16,4.0,10/15/2017,"I came here for lunch yesterday for a meal after a half marathon. Just as a warning, I was fairly hungry after running 13 miles so that might skew my opinion of the food a bit. The restaurant is pretty cozy. There's an old timey kind of vibe but it felt very relaxed. I also liked the fact it was on a side street as opposed to on a main road so it didn't feel like it was too bustling. There was also a good amount of people but it wasn't too loud or anything. The service was ehh. It took a while for someone to come take our orders which is mostly the reason for the ding in stars. My stomach was eating itself and seeing other people's food was torture (as I'm sure every hungry person at a restaurant knows) so every minute spent waiting or trying to wave down a server felt painful. At least they were nice and we didn't have any other problems later on in the meal. The food, oh this is the important part! I've been eating hummus for a while, but I've never had hummus like this! I think it was the best hummus I've ever had. There was such a good amount of umami flavor (but not overwhelming) that just felt so balanced. It simply blew me away! The eggplant was ehh as I was expecting be as tasty as baba ganoush (which I love) but it was disappointing. Omelette was ehh also so I wouldn't recommend it unless you're really craving it. And the shakshuka was on point. Just a little bit of spice to light up my day! I would definitely recommend people to come if you want a nice meal with a pretty relaxed vibe. But whatever you do, do not commit the cardinal sin of not ordering the hummus or you will regret it...P.S. For those bad with double negatives, that means order the hummus!",1,,
19,Alexandra T.,"Jersey City, NJ",322,348,303,4.0,9/24/2017,"Cute, casual and comfortable spot in soho. Walked in for brunch with a girlfriend around 11am on Sunday and were immediately seated. It was already fairly crowded so clutch we arrived before a bigger crowd (as we were leaving around noon there was a line outside). Started off with the hummus and had cucumber slices to dip instead of pita...impressed already with their variety. Also came with tasty AF pickles (must have had a secret picking recipe for those guys) and some olives. Hummus was light and creamy with a perfect paprika cumin ratio to the tahini. Hate when there's too much of a sesame flavor from tahini overload.We both had the shakshuka for our mains. Pretty simple but tasty sauce with sautéed soft onions. Eggs were a tad too cooked for me as I enjoy a bit of runny runny but still really enjoyed the dish. The shakshuka came with an Israeli salad on the side. Super fresh tomato and cucumber and not an overwhelming red onion flavor. Very simple but executed well and refreshing.We chatted for another 30ish minutes and weren't rushed at all even though there was a line outside. Kudos to 12 chairs for not pumping ppl in and out like an assembly line like some other brunch spots nearby. Will def be back. Can't wait to try their dinner. Wines by the glass were affordable ($9). My kinda place!",2,,
20,Stewart K.,"Philadelphia, PA",79,230,582,4.0,10/1/2017,"I am not Israeli but I can pretend to be.  So my friend introduced this hotspot to me, a crowded typical weekend brunch place.  It has a bar, so eat there rather than wait for a table. I ordered the weekend special of jacknun.  It's basically a rolled, squishy, filo dough type dish, sweetened with honey by marinating overnight in it.  No way I can really describe it to other than it tastes divine, exactly like something that comes from the land of milk and honey would taste like.  It's served with a spicy black olive paste and crushed tomatoes.  One is enough, two is too much...so get two.",1,1,

23,EatVegetarian F.,"Oakland, CA",2,95,4,5.0,7/3/2018,"This place has the best hummus in nyc!!

24,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1333,781,1447,4.0,1/8/2018,"If you are a fan of Zahav or Dizengoff or other similar restaurants, you will definitely enjoy this one.WAIT: Came on a Friday at 6:30 pm on one of the coldest days in NYC and there was no wait.  There were always empty tables so not sure if it gets more crowded during other days.  I called to make a reservation the night before and she said we didn't need them.  The food itself took about 10 minutes to come out so not a long wait.ATMOSPHERE: Inside is dark and wooden feeling, almost like a tavern but with a restaurant vibe.  It is more homey and not super trendy but would be a nice place for an intimate date.  I think I did see a small gathering of girls at one table for a birthday party or GNO.  The kitchen/bar is sort of open where you can see them preparing drinks etc. and there is a restroom in the back as well as a coat hanger for heavy coats.FOOD: I liked that this place wasn't overly expensive.  It's still about $13-15 for one dish depending on what you get but it won't break the bank.  They also serve breakfast all day!HUMMUS - you can get a smaller portion for about $6 versus $9 that is about the size of a small plate they serve olive oil to you on.  For 2 people it was enough since we each got our own dishes.  It also comes with one piece of pita bread (whole wheat or white).  The hummus is very good, super fresh, tasty, probably the same as Zahav.  The pita is also so warm and soft and delicious! Everything was great.LAMB KEBOBS - this is an appetizer but is enough for 1 person.  It comes with 2 lamb kebabs which is basically a giant meat stick (not the kind where it has cubes of meat on an actual stick) and was seasoned well and not too gamey.  It comes with tahini on the side to dip (I tried to sub hummus but they don't allow substitutions) and more pita on the side.  Again, the pita was delicious.  If you enjoy lamb and want a meat dish get this one.  Also, the hummus, pita, tahini and lamb are all dairy-free!Husband got the shushuka (sp?) and said it was basically eggs in tomato sauce.  Pretty standard but you it also comes with Israeli salad AND bread + cream cheese spread so you get a lot of food.  Overall, great recommendation from a friend to try this place especially if you like Israeli-mediterranean food and/or want somewhere that serves breakfast all day! We left very satisfied and pretty full.",6,1,5
25,Samantha S.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",50,72,68,5.0,3/7/2018,Cute middle eastern cafe between Soho and Greenwich village. The hummus is award winning and a must have to go along with your entree. I ordered the Shakshuka which is a tasty tomato sauce with baked egg inside that you dip their homemade pita or bread inside. It also comes with Israeli chopped salad on the side that is fresh and a great addition to the entree. The coffee is awesome and they also have non-dairy milk alternatives such as almond milk if you request. Great service and great experiences! Can't wait to go back!,,,
26,Irena S.,"Manhattan, NY",218,230,60,4.0,12/20/2017,"We happened to pass by one Sunday, looking for a place to eat brunch in the village.  The prices are very reasonable, around $10 for an omelette.  I had the Greek omelet and liked that it came with a generous side of field greens, dotted with sliced cucumber and tomato, and well-dressed with a lemony vinaigrette.  The Greek omelette was also good, though heavy in the black olives and light on the feta cheese for my taste.  We shared a side order of the 12 chairs home fries to round out the meal, and they were delectably fried slices of potato, almost like chips, with a dish of ketchup on the side.It's a smallish room, cozy atmosphere but on Sunday at 1pm we had to wait about half an hour for a table - not too bad.  We felt a little cramped towards the back but they also have a small bar were we could have also settled ourselves.My boyfriend tried one of their more exotic takes on brunch, poached eggs in hummus with a side of Israeli salad.  I think the hummus was thinner than he's used to, but he enjoyed the dish.  The food is fresh and well prepared, the waitresses seem like family, and we enjoyed our brunch here.",3,,2

Food:French toast with fruit - generous portions, well cooked and flavorful. Fresh fruit is yummyGranola bowl - perfect to share with tart Greek yogurt, a heaping amount of granola, and a side plate of fruitShakshuka - delicious but really tomato tasting so if you don't love that overwhelming of a taste be warned - comes with bread basket with a veggie cream cheese sort of dip. The eggs were perfectly baked, not too runny. My only complaint is that the feta is an extra 2.50 or 3.50?? and it's not enough of a topping to be charged that much extra especially when I feel like all shakshukas should just come with the cheese sprinkled on top at no extra charge !!",1,,

I really wanted to eat shakshuka and saw some good reviews on yelp for the food here. Utterly disappointed. Food: The eggs in the shakshuka were over cooked. The tomato sauce didn't taste fresh. We asked them to add feta cheese on top, as you can probably see from the picl it was barely anything. And the charge for that was $3.5!!! We also ordered a side of israeli fries. They were very very oily. The only good thing about the food was the israeli salad.Service: When we entered majority of their tables were empty. Yet she asked me is your entire party here? Well, your restaurant is empty! who else are you going to seat. Once we were done eating she kept staring at us, as if we were blocking their new customers. Very poor service indeed.Ambience: Its a cute little spot. I still don't know why it is called 12 chairs. They have more than 12 chairs though. I will not go back there ever again.",1,1,

Because there were only 2 of us and we had never been to 12 Chairs, we decided to split a few dishes. We got the guac and pita, tomato salad, and the cheese dip. I like that the waiters ask if you'd like white or wheat bread. It's a fluffier pita that comes out in a round helping so you have to cut it yourself. The tomato salad was very good. I believe it had basil and onions. I'm not sure what else but it tasted very fresh. The guac was not very good. I only had about 3 dips and was not going back for more. It has rather chunky pieces of hard boiled egg in it which should have discouraged me in the first place. The creamy cheese dip was very good. I am mildly intolerant to cheese so I had stomach pain for the rest of the night but I understand that's my own fault. It was very creamy and yet light like yogurt. It was topped with a splash of olive oil.I will come back but would like to try other things on the menu.",2,,

44,Amanda S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,18,8,3.0,8/17/2018,"Small, sleepy bistro serving good-not-great Middle Eastern fare at very reasonable prices",,,
45,Rachel B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",416,63,47,5.0,2/18/2018,"Incredible, authentic Israeli food! I had the hummus, and their homemade pita is so good. Also had the Israeli breakfast - great portion and so tasty. I will definitely return here for brunch (which they have on weekdays too).",,,
46,Aakansha B.,"New York, NY",122,41,72,5.0,7/8/2017,"This place is small but so cute. I got the hummus falafel with pita (pita not shown in picture) and it was delicious! They had the flavor down as well as the presentation. The service is fabulous! My friend tried to Shazam a song 3 times but was unable to get it because it was a little noisy in the restaurant. Without us asking, one of the servers came up to her with a piece of paper that had the song artist and name written. It was so nice and refreshing because we were sitting in the corner and hadn't asked anyone but he was so kind to notice and help us out. I would highly recommend this place not only for it's food but also for it's amazing service!",1,,
47,Wilma R.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",9,2,1,4.0,8/4/2018,Good food and it has a nice vibe/feel to it. Loved the experience there. Would gladly go back especially on weekends.,,,
48,Rhea C.,"Singapore, Singapore",1,40,11,4.0,6/23/2018,"The food here is delicious!! We ordered the hummus, pita, babaganoush, shoushouko and an egg dish which comes with tahini. Everything was delicious. We didn't even have to wait too long for a table (granted, it was just the three of us, but still). Overall it was a great lunch and I can't wait to head back here.",,,1
49,Jeff C.,"Chicago, IL",381,315,14,3.0,11/17/2017,Just okay.  Nothing special and nothing to write home about but it's not offensive either.  Service was okay.  Typical of NYC restaurants it's cramped but not overly loud,1,,1
50,Julie W.,"New York, NY",248,68,65,5.0,9/26/2016,"My brunch here was hands down the best one I've had in ages. (My best friend runs a food blog and brunches with me frequently, so that says something)Service is great and the food is out of this world.I highly recommend the Shakshuka. I mean you actually HAVE to try it. (Although I'm sure the rest of the food here is delicious too)The last time I had such good Shakshuka was when I actually was in Israel. (To be honest, this might have even topped that)I will definitely be back soon!!",3,,1
51,Shawn A.,"Windsor Locks, CT",6,43,53,3.0,6/24/2017,Got here and it was a pretty confined area with limited seating.  Looking at other yelp reviews I was expecting more from this place.  Ordered the Israeli guacamole and the Arayes.  The guacamole was pretty flavorful and they interestingly added some hard boiled egg to it however the pita that came with it was a bit greasy.  The Arayes was pretty tasty as well but the amount of lamb that came in it was at best a medium sized portion.  Was an interesting experience but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here.,,,
52,Shelli G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,2,5.0,7/9/2018,"Amazing food! The hummus and falafel are delicious, so is everything else on the menu :) Very friendly and helpful staff especially the person who I assumed to be the manager? When we first came we were told that there'd be a 20 minute wait but he quickly told us he can arrange a table by adding a chair for us and we ended up not waiting at all! I loved the energy in the place -- lots of Israelis both dining and working there made it feel like I was back in Israel. Overall a great experience, can't wait to come back.",,,
53,Ravi C.,"Valley Stream, NY",3,4,0,5.0,6/19/2018,Had a really good dinner here on Father's Day. The food was all delicious except for the vegetable couscous which was bland. The waiter was very understanding and allowed us to replace the dish and took it off the check. Would definitely recommend the restaurant and come back again!,,,
54,Jocelyn C.,"Brooklyn, NY",884,264,307,5.0,3/28/2017,"Perfection, just pure perfection. I came across 12 Chairs on a Sunday afternoon post-WFW events. The moment I walked in, I was taken back to my days in Tel Aviv. The servers' mannerisms, the ambience, the smell of fresh hummous, all adds up to what I call an oh so charming delight of SoHo. A place where you won't be getting a falafel wrap to-go, 12 Chairs' offers authentic mediterranean specialties and Israeli dishes you won't forget. Oh and another perk, no wait!! Perfect spot for a casual brunch or intimate dinner. How's that for a hidden SoHo gem.Order up: -Shakshuka, served with a heaping portion of Israeli salad and another side of your choice-the creamiest hummous you'll find in town, served with warm, fresh pita-Arayes, with insanely scrumptious minced lamb-Baladi eggplant as a starter, topped with absolutely divine tehina-and of course no Israeli meal is complete without LabenehBe'teavon!",4,2,3
55,Francisco T.,"San Francisco, CA",152,4,0,5.0,11/23/2017,"This is probably my favorite spot for lunch in NY,The food and the service are outstanding.I will definitely go back.",1,,
56,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1523,1489,2.0,7/13/2016,"On this block alone there are several sit down restaurants with completely different cuisine types. 12 Chairs specializes in Israeli food offered in big portions at reasonable prices for the area.Tuesday afternoon and the space is fairly busy. Not only that but there seems to be a lot of delivery orders being sent out. Despite that, got a table for two immediately. Ordered the Tunisian Sandwich ($12) and an Iced Tea ($3). At this point we noticed a lot of the tables that were seated did not have their food yet...not a good sign at all. Overall, it took 45 minutes for the food to come out, with no one checking up on us in the meantime. The Tunisian sandwich is hardy with a mash of eggs, tuna, olives, and lemon dressing. Not bad, could have been seasoned a little more, though much better with the hot sauce we asked for. Accompanied salad is your standard leaves with dressing.Service here is lacking. We had to flag the waitress down for refills of water and for the check. It looks like they have a hard time filling orders for both takeout and sit-down during their peak hours, but I liked the price-to-food ratio. Will re-review if I can come during a less hectic time.",3,,
57,Brian H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",220,8,4,5.0,1/26/2018,"Great service, good food, and good atmosphere. The lamburger was good and the sauce that came with it was better. They also have a great selection of wine and coffee as well. I came in the afternoon and it wasn't crowded at all",,,
58,Lana L.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",549,420,3296,4.0,7/3/2016,"Ate at this small and adorable restaurant on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. Got the quiche of the day (spinach & cheese) which comes with salad on the side. My friend and I also shared the 12 Chairs home fries, which are fries in the form of circles. As fries, I'll admit they didn't look super appetizing to me at first, but upon taking my first bite, I confirmed that they are indeed just like good old regular fries. The quiche was thicker than most, so it's actually enough for a meal if you aren't starving. Also, I loved the cream cheese that was served with the bread. It looked and tasted like salmon cream cheese, or something similar. Taste | 4Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 3Service | 4OVERALL | 4",1,1,1
59,Kimberly T.,"New York, NY",47,123,407,5.0,8/6/2016,"Came in on an 11 am on Saturday and was seated fairly quickly! The setting inside is very nice - very airy and bright, which I really enjoyed. I ordered the shakshuka ($11) and got bulgarian feta cheese on top ($3), and I shared a plate of hummus with my friend. All the food was very good, and your entrees come with a side of tomato/cucumber salad. We sat there for about 2 hours and they didn't try to shoo us out either. Overall, I thought my food was very good and I liked the vibe of the place!",,,
60,Meryam B.,"New York, NY",366,337,12,2.0,9/27/2017,"I was disappointed by my meal here. I'm a born and raised New York-er so I'm not impressed by location and ambiance alone. Maybe I just got the wrong thing off the brunch menu but charging me $11 for lightly sweetened vanilla yogurt, limp granola, and shapeless fruit is not okay. I would give this place 1 star but my waiter and the waitstaff were polite. Step your game up, 12 chairs!",,,
61,Brandon K.,"New York, NY",177,37,15,5.0,5/29/2018,I've been here once for brunch and once for dinner and both times I have left very happy. Since I went to Israel last summer I go through random periods where I start to crave the foods that I ate there. It wasn't until my sister took me to 12 Chairs that I ever really satisfied that craving. Don't kid yourself into thinking that something store bought hummus or street cart falafel will make the cut. Do yourself a favor and go to 12 Chairs the next chance you get.,,,
62,Pita P.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",3,24,14,4.0,10/24/2017,"Pretty good Middle Eastern food. I'm  a huge fan of Hummus and theirs is great! Its not the same as in the restaurant's country of origin, but still totally recommended. Great Couscous dish too! I haven't had their schnitzel (I think its a bit too pricey for its own good), but I'm sure its really tasty! Nice atmosphere, nice food!",,,
63,Melinda B.,"Richmond, VA",86,6,2,1.0,5/11/2018,Food was great. Service not-so-great.  Arrived at 7:35 and was told a table would be open in 15-20 minutes. No worries as spouse was parking car and daughter walking over. Open tables but not seated until 9:30. Spend $$ in bar waiting.  No apologies either.,,,
64,Josh P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,12,0,5.0,8/10/2018,I've either ordered from or eaten at 12 chairs 10+ times. Consistently great Israeli food. They're great at what they do and no doubt 5 stars in my opinion.,,,
65,Karen X.,"New York, NY",216,189,172,5.0,2/18/2017,"I don't usually go out of my way to eat Mediterranean food, but this place really blew me away! Came for brunch on a Saturday at the suggestion of friends and had a really great time! I love pickles and they give a small platter of pickles and olives to start. We got the hummus and pita to share which was splendid and the shakshuka I got as my entree was also great. Otherwise, the decor and general ambiance of the restaurant was homey and inviting, just be prepared to wait a bit because it's not super big.",,,
66,Vn.tage E.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",1,22,30,5.0,10/26/2017,"This was my first time having middle eastern food, and I was not disappointed. My friend and I went here for Sunday brunch and the place was a bit packed. You cannot be seated until you arrive with your party, and while I waited I had a nice chat with the staff there. After my friend and I arrived we were seated at the bar, and the service was just as great. My friend and I both ordered shakshuka that came with salad, and I got coffee to go with it. It was a tasty one, great price, service, and loved the vibe. Definitely won't be the last time I'll be here!",,,

Updated review",After six years of eating here I have to update my review. I love 12 chairs. Everything here is good. I usually find myself here when I'm starving and need a hearty meal. Bread and herbed cream cheese is crack (served with omelettes) and their salad dressing is almost crack.,3,2,2
68,Larisa B.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,10,0,4.0,2/17/2018,Always a good solid breakfast and never breaks the bank.   Nothing better than an Israeli breakfast. I always suggest ordering a hummus to share,,,
69,Ashwin S.,"New York, NY",129,109,192,4.0,7/27/2017,"12 Chairs already stands out in West Village / Soho by having a dinner menu where every item is under $20. Seriously, that's a pretty rare find.While the breakfast served all day is a bit random, everything we tried here was delicious. The Arayes, a grilled pita filled with lamb and topped with veggies and tahini, was amazing. I'll definitely be back again for that $14 goodness. I think this place would be better for brunch, unless you are trying to get a sandwich and eggs for dinner.",,,
70,Manali P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,21,29,3.0,10/17/2017,"As a vegetarian who generally eats an unholy amount of Italian food around the city, I was quite excited about finally making my way to 12 chairs because it would be a pleasant break from the monotony. The servers were really nice and efficient, in spite of a large crowd and constant delivery pickups at the main desk. I was here for dinner and was happy to note that 4 out of the 6 sandwich choices were vegetarian. The fresh mozzarella seemed like an Italian choice and I was looking forward to trying something more middle eastern so I went for the Sabich Sandwich. I thought it was strictly average -- too dry for my liking. I kept dunking my sandwich in the little tahini bowl that came alongside my salad. And the bread was very dense and flour-y. I had flour all over my hands and face when I was done eating about half of it.We had started off with a few appetizers of which the labaneh was a clear winner. Definitely the best labaneh I've had in the city so far. I might actually go back for the small plates and wine the next time in the area and that, I think, would make for a 5 star experience.",,,
71,Greg B.,"Oceanside, CA",47,165,0,4.0,5/10/2017,"Friday evening it happened  to be a family reunion at 12 Chairs café for an early dinner.  The  place was almost empty, we were seated promptly, and as per suggestion of my boys, we ordered a 12 chairs burger (nice size, cooked to order, comes with fries and salad - just ask for a sauce on the side) . The menu is presented with a Mediterranean bend, some items are from the old owners (pelmeni,  pierogi  or borscht ""soup"" ?).  The service is great, at the end I asked the server -  is this place kosher, he laughed - the only kosher here is the wine from Israel he said.",1,1,3
72,Cindi S.,"Higganum, CT",153,68,126,3.0,6/23/2017,"The service is so so, they are nice but they kinda just stand there, it's very tiny inside, rose is from Israeli brand but tastes like robitussin ($12/glass) not enough pita with the guac and lamb burger was more like a lamb patty.  Very oily food overall not flavorful. Would've ordered more if they asked how we were doing or if we needed anything but we had to flag them down for dessert",,1,
73,Gal M.,"Las Vegas, NV",97,9,11,4.0,12/17/2017,"So I came here with my family from Israel. We came five people, they told us it will take 10-20 min to get a table. They were rude when we told them 30 passed and said to keep waiting but overall the food was tasty and so fresh. So delicious. Recommend!!",,1,
74,linda y.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,18,2,4.0,8/13/2017,Fresh salads with a low key vibe- great for summer time dining. Today they had a watermelon feta appetizer and I had food envy for not ordering.I had the Israeli salad and I could tell they're use quality ingredients in their cooking.  The salad was fresh and hit the right spot on a humid New York summer day when you are looking for satisfying light fare.  The salad was fresh and cucumbers had a satisfying crunch at each bite.  Must try and come back for the hummus plate.,,,
75,Maria R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",121,28,2,5.0,3/2/2018,Wow!!! What a gem!!! I have a new favorite restaurant. Everything here is impeccable. The food is to die for and so fresh!!!

76,Kaiden M.,"New York, NY",4,34,5,5.0,9/10/2017,"Our go to spot for never fail middle eastern food. So good, have been here at least 10 times and never had a bad experience.

77,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",410,620,353,4.0,6/26/2015,"A sunny, cozy Israeli-ish spot with a broad menu of mezze, sandwiches, soups, entrees, and drinks. There are more than 12 chairs here--it's not a tiny place, though it has the feel of one, and it has room for groups.  In warmer weather, the storefront opens up and it all feels light and airy.  I've been here a couple of times and ordered or shared a fair amount of things, and I wasn't taking notes so I'm a little blurry on details.  The summary, however, is that I liked just about everything, and got the impression that there wasn't anything especially bad to order.  Details remembered:- They mix a hard-boiled egg into their guacamole--this is both unexpected and delicious.- I first came to try the Israeli breakfast, which is usually combination of eggs, an Israeli salad (tomato, cucumber, a bit of onion, mint and parsley or in any case some sort of herb, dressed in oil or maybe yogurt), bread, some feta, maybe olives, maybe a few other things.  At 12 Chairs, those other things include teeny dipping bowls of labneh (strained yogurt), guacamole, remarkably salty cilantro-pesto, and tunafish salad.  So, it's a little quirky, as far as the classic dish goes, but still satisfying.- Soup!  I tried the borscht and the Yemenite soups.  The borscht was basically a hearty vegetable soup, heavy on tomato flavor but a bit too light on the beet flavor.  (This is partly personal bias, I like my borscht light on the tomato, heavy on the beet.)  The Yemenite soup is a spicy Chicken soup and though it wasn't bad, it was a bit boring, and I'd skip it if only because there are better things to be had at 12 Chairs.- The sandwiches are large, you could easily split one between two people so's to have more room for mezze or dessert.  I tried a nice grilled vegetable sandwich and the chicken sandwich.  Both solid-to-good.- Hummus, falafel, Israeli pickles... all excellent and all as you would expect.  If you crave these things, you'll be happy with them here.- For dessert, the 12 Chairs Blintz is great, but note they're presented more like crepes than like blintzes, fanned out folded triangles, very lightly filled.  I was hoping for the traditional fat rolled-up blintzes stuffed full of sweet cheese.  Still, we loved the dish, which comes sided and topped with fresh fruit and toasted walnuts, cream, and chocolate drizzle.",17,11,15
78,James C.,"New York, NY",83,22,2,5.0,1/20/2018,"Exceptional, authentic food. The falafel, grape leaves, pita, were out of this world.",,,
79,Marina I.,"Rockville, MD",0,20,1,5.0,6/27/2018,Best place ever!   I keep coming back here and order something different each time and every time it's consistently delicious.  Everything is full of flavour.  Malhabi is outstanding.  Great shakshouka.  They even have jahnun. Can't get enough of this place,,,
80,Or Z.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",7,1,0,1.0,6/24/2017,Worse service on Sundays!Waited for an hour and 15 minutes (they said it's 40 minutes wait) after which we left since there was still no table available.,,,
81,Matthew K.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",14,36,4,3.0,6/7/2018,"Mini lamb kebabs were top notch, eggplant is ok, but grape leaves seemed like they were from a can. Also probably should've asked how many come in an order before ordering: for the record, it's 4, for $9.50!!!",,,
82,Sol C.,"Cambridge, MA",169,571,866,4.0,10/21/2016,"I really enjoyed the delicious Mediterranean food at 12 Chairs. The restaurant itself is tiny and was packed when we walked in on a Wednesday night around 7:30 pm. There were a couple of seats at the bar, however, so we chose to sit there rather than wait for a larger table. Our server was friendly, attentive and helpful. Two of us shared the Greek salad, hummus with falafel, and labneh (yogurt dip). Everything was so fresh and delicious! The portions are also quite big - plus the hummus comes with a few pieces of warm pita and olives/pickles! We couldn't even finish it all and we're shocked when the bill came - the prices were extremely fair - dinner for two with tip and tax came to $40 total! Great deal.Highly recommend.",,,1

Brings that middle Eastern Israeli heavenly flavor that is just out of this world. Very fresh hummus and pita. The chicken schnitzel was a very good entree it came with fries and mashed potatoes which weren't great, I especially was not a fan of the mashed potatoes but the Schnitzel was very good. Last but so far from the least was the falafel!! I loved the freshness and quality they put into making it. Its the perfect mix between not to crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Need I say more. If you come here the Hummus and Falafel is a must!I've heard on Saturday morning the Jachnun is next level and I will be returning soon to try it!I will be coming back, this time to dine in!",1,,

Complimentary bread with their homemade veggie cream cheese was nice as well.",,,
87,Danielle M.,"New York, NY",388,497,41,4.0,4/21/2016,"12 Chairs is a great Israeli cafe in the West Village.  The Israeli charisma of the people working there and quality of the food made me feel like I was having brunch in Tel Aviv!We started with the Israeli salad (standard), Israeli pickles (don't order unless you want a small dish of olives and only one pickle), and hummus with white pita.  The hummus was so creamy and delicious that it made you feel bad about anything you've purchased from a store.  Our waiter told us the hummus is made twice daily for optimal freshness.  I even bought a food processor a couple days after having brunch at 12 Chairs so I could make my own hummus!For my main, I had the salmon omelette served with mixed greens.  I liked that it was cooked salmon versus smoked.  Growing up in an Israeli household, I feel the need to put yogurt sauce on everything so I had to order the labneh.  It's imported from Lebanon so it's the real deal / generously covered in za'atar and olive oil = AMAZING.  I didn't try the white pita, but I did have some of the whole wheat pita and it was delicious.. so doughy :)We all enjoyed our brunch at 12 Chairs and I'm sure we will be back again!",2,1,3

89,Stacy J.,"Saratoga, CA",560,24,3,5.0,11/6/2017,"After miserably failing to make some good homemade shakshuka (it's literally eggs and tomatoes - why am I so bad at this??), I gave up and got some shakshuka at 12 chairs. Service wasn't a problem for us, but that may be due to the fact that we came in on 10 PM on  Sunday. I could tell that the waitress was trying to speed us up to get the orders into the kitchen on time, which is understandable. I think the ambiance at dinner/evening may be much different than at brunch time - it was much quieter, dimly lit, and good for a casual date. As for food, I got the shakshuka which I think has been my favorite thus far since moving to the city. It was spiced really well, and I liked that they also gave us a side salad with that since the portion of the shakshuka was a bit smaller than other ones I've tried.My friend got the arayes, which I was mildly jealous of because I love lamb. Portion for this isn't that huge either, which was okay because we shared the falafel hummus. The falafel was good, and my friend said that he liked the hummus a lot (I'm not super picky with hummus, so I can't be the judge of this). I'm excited to come back and order the arayes for myself or try the lamb burger!",,,

Unfortunately I am a no runny egg kinda gal, when I asked them to cook the eggs hard they burned the sauce in the skillet and served me a dehydrated version of shakshuka. I asked if I could have a side of the sauce and just add it, was told ""they don't have that."" No worries, I ordered another egg dish. My review is of the two eggs any way  plate. Scrambled Eggs-cooked perfect. Salad-incredibly fresh greens but lack of oil or dressing made it rubbery, difficult to swallow. Bacon-tons of it, thinly sliced, but undercooked and again, rubbery. The service was attentive, swift. I will try again, maybe it was just an off day.",1,1,1

93,Neil K.,"Old Bridge, NJ",60,91,11,3.0,4/23/2018,"Stopped for a late Sunday brunch. Cute (small) Soho restaurant that had a small wait. Hostess and wait service were friendly. Started with a very good hummus and falafel dish. Hummus is very light and is served with pita, we had the whole wheat that was warm and fluffy. It also came with an olive and pickle dish. An omelette and a Brie sandwich, both good, came with a small green salad. Honey mustard seems to be a specialty and the server did bring a side tin. My shakshuka was a disappointment. Though the seasoned tomato base was tasty, the eggs were way overdone. I was looking forward to a yolk to richen up the dish. Instead I got was two fully solid eggs buried in the dish. When ordering I was asked if I wanted the Bulgarian feta cheese. I expected something special for the extra $3.50, what I got was maybe a tablespoon of feta that was anything but special. The dish came with a good Israeli salad and bread that would have been good if I ate earlier. It was already a little dry, but it looked good.",,,

We ordered the falafel with hummus as a starter. Let's start with the starter. The falafel is amazing, the hummus is well made and the tahini and lemon sauce inside is a rare thing. I think it's the best falafel in nyc easily. The hummus is ok but the tahini and lemon sauce is remarkable. They also provide 2 pitas with the falafel. Thats 12$ or so for 5 falafel balls, hummus, tahini, 2 pitas, green olives and pickles. That's a whole meal right there. We all shared it. The Schnitzel I ate was ok+. I asked to absorb all the oil but they haven't done it so I did it myself. Schnitzel needs to be absorbed from all the oil before putting it on a plate especially when it cost 18$. The fries with the Schnitzel are good and I enjoyed them. My girlfriend ate the moroccan fish and said it's not good. Lacks flavor and poorly made. If you are unsure of a dish, do not make it. The burger is good, I remember when I had it I likes it. Good bun and paddy. Overall good experience. Came up to 94+ tip for 4 people. That's ok I guess, a bit pricey. I feel like they can be excellent but are too lazy or unprofessional to take it to the next level.",,,

100,CK R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,4,1.0,5/26/2017,"Laughably bad service here on Sunday. We came at the behest of one of our group who had been here previously and says the service is quite different during the weekdays. The experience: Half of our party of four arrived about 10min ahead of the other 2 and were let know they could not be seated before the full party arrived. That's fine; some restaurants have this policy and I'm not mad at it--I mention it merely to let everyone know this is the policy even when the restaurant is not busy/more than half-empty. When we were seated, we were given water in a carafe and menus. Then we were left alone for more than 20min, no hyperbole. The water carafe was empty, and everyone was looking around. I asked if it was counter service instead of sit down to my friend who had been there previously as it went on so long with people who clearly worked there studiously doing anything but taking our order--scrubbing counters, filling condiments etc. a few feet away. I felt like they were trying to freeze us out but I guess we hit the waiting period mark because someone eventually took our order. Naturally, things came out incorrectly, and we were missing items and received items we did not order. It happens, but it was just another thing. Nothing great about the food. Hummus/sandwiches/falafel were all pretty generic, baba ganoush had too much garlic. Additionally, the waitress' attitude was not what I would describe as pleasant the entire time. The kicker was when we got the bill. We wanted to split the order--not, mind you, among a crazy amount of cards: just two, along couple/table sides. We divided the bill by item but they wanted an actual dollar amount to split. This confused two of us who are servers and wonder what POS they have, but, hey, no problem, we did the math and let them know ""$70.50 on the green card, the rest of the bill on the other."" We were very confused when the cards were returned as there was an added gratuity on one of the cards. Apparently, the waitress had heard ""70 on this card and 50 on the other"" which amounted to more than the cost of the total bill and she ran it anyway without questioning it, giving herself a gratuity. It seemed pretty clear she had done this on purpose. Needless to say, congratulations to you if you didn't want us here because of some way we looked because we definitely won't be back. This is the only 1 star review I have ever given--your service is that bad.",,,

The burger was huge, which made it a bit difficult to eat. But it was so good that I'm definitely ordering it again, no questions asked. The burger was spiced perfectly and was so fragrant.

Don't let the old, hipster vibe scare you away. These guys are serving delicious Israeli food and bomb ass coffee. I have eaten here a few times already and each time is fabulous. If you happen to be in the restaurant on a weekend, I highly recommend the jachnun. It's unlike anything you've ever eaten before. It's oily dough that is slow roasted for, quite literally, hours on end. It turns into a delicious, chewy, sweet and savory treat that is traditionally Yemenite and served with hard boiled eggs, pickles, and crushed tomatoes. Outstanding. Other honorable mentions include the limonana, the falafel and the hummus. Their coffee is also delicious.

The tomato base was really tasty and feta on the top added the perfect saltiness to the dish. The eggs could have been a bit softer but that might be a matter of preference. Good sourdough bread which they were very generous with and great service. The atmosphere was relaxed yet energetic and the feeling is overall fresh and inviting.

120,Michael K.,"Queens, NY",161,155,252,4.0,7/20/2015,"12 Chairs can be described in one word... Quant. Its a hole and a half in the wall a short block off from Houston St. There is a line of restaurants on the same block and none of them had more than 2 tables while 12 Chairs was pack with a line and a waiting list. We came in with 8 people and although they said the wait was 45 min it was close to 20. The service is kind and attentive. The food is slightly pricey for the serving sizes but worth it. The falafel with Hummus was outstanding... Im a fan of good falafels! Ofcourse being in a israel restaurant you have to order native food, so I opted with the Shakshuka ($11). When it got to the table, my first thought was.. Thats it? It looked way larger in the photos on Yelp, but I'm going to agree that it was a decent serving. 2 eggs with tomato and spices, slightly on the spicy side, but well prepared and tasty. I really enjoyed eating it hot out of the cast iron it was served in. I recommend coming here with some friend for brunch as a change in ordinary food, but if your looking to drink, perhaps a bottomless brunch would do. The cappuccino was done very well and had everyone asking for more than 1, so I know where to come for some good coffee. that and a small feel of what the middle east is like..

It was piping hot and bubbly like authentic Israeli pita is. I was able to get both whole wheat and white just by asking.I had a real case of order envy here. I had the lamb burger. It was a bit overdone and dry (eating it with the spicy mayo that came with the sandwich though made it much better). Without the mayo itself, this burger would have been easily forgettable and probably more than I should have spent. I appreciated that I could get falafel as a side instead of the fries that came with my burger. The staff accidentally brought out both (fortunately I wasn't charged extra). The falafel hit the spot. I enjoyed the fries, fluffy and crispy, but thought they could have used a quick dash of salt when they came out of the fryer. I should have gone with the chicken pockets my friends ordered. I shy away from having chicken in restaurants (because, as an easy meat, it's what I usually cook on weekdays). The chicken pockets, however, were well seasoned and extremely juicy, making it one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. I wasn't huge on the hummus, as it didn't have a balanced flavor. I detected mostly tahini, with a bit of a salad dressing type sauce in the middle. The hummus could have used more lemon, garlic, and salt. Consistency-wise, it was on point though.",1,,

It's a large serving of hummus, plenty for 2 (or more as an appetizer), including two excellent pitas (we got a wheat and a white pita), olives and what they call Israeli pickles (very lightly flavored dill type pickle). It was all very good.We also shared a grilled vegetable sandwich. It was a good-sized sandwich, plenty for 2 to share. It was excellent, with a good variety of veggies and pesto on a nice roll. It also included salad of nice greens, tomato, and some other fresh veggies.I had sparkling water, starting with a small bottle (one glass worth), then adding a large bottle. My wife had iced tea.

Their schnitzel is perfect and reminds me of my mothers schnitzel. On Saturday and Sunday they have jachnun and hamin.  Jachnoon is a Yemenite rolled fatty dough that cooks overnight on low heat and is very tasty for weekend breakfast. Hamin is also cooked overnight and is a beer stew type dish which is also amazing with bone marrow. Their hummus was also pretty solid.

I wouldnt say prices are cheap, but its not expensive either. The falafel was good, but a bit dry for me. I loved the couliflower soup--it was surprisingly lighter than it looked---i was expecting it to be super heavy and filling but it was perfect. The eggplant dish was my least favorite--it wasnt cooked, but more of room temperature. And a bit bland in flavor. The 12 chairs home fries are a must get---they were the last item we ordered and we were shocked at how good they were.

139,G M.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,454,776,3.0,3/27/2016,"This is an Israeli restaurant but it did not offer much of the Arab-type Israeli food I was expecting (Hummus, Tabouleh, Felafel), and instead more of the range of diaspora cuisine (Russian, Polish, Moroccan, etc.). This place feels almost like a coffee shop - very casual and rustic with rough hewn furniture. The various waitresses were sorta dressed like college students working part time jobs, and were nonchalant/non-excited about the whole thing. They didn't give us any bread, until we noticed the other table had some, and specifically asked for it. We had the morocann fish on couscous ($17.50), potato dumplings with mushrooms, and some wine. It was actually all pretty decent and tasty - albeit with a home cooked vibe and casual plating. The dumplings were just a touch greasy. Given the decor and attitude, it seemed slightly pricey. If it had been more of an actual restaurant, then the prices would be reasonable. There were also some photos on the wall - apparently from Israel in decades gone by which looked interesting, but no information about whether they were from the areas occupied or among the 500+ Arab villages wiped out in the formation of the state.

Think cute cafe meets upscale diner meets Middle Eastern hangout, minus hookahs. Other than that, it's a bit nondescript, but thankfully yummy enough for the occasional lunch or take-out order.I like their Pelmeni, which is described as Russian veal ravioli. Therefore, don't expect the Italian type - this is a sauceless affair, much like pierogies. And their Chef Salad (tuna, mesclun, cherry tomato, avocado, red onion, and corn) is my go-to delivery choice. I've also had the Chicken Schnitzel, which is a substantial serving of two pounded cutlets, although a little routine in flavor. And adding to the almost-Israeli-diner feel, 12 Chairs serves breakfast all day for all you egg-heads out there.You may walk in and also notice some legit-lookin' certificates that award this place status of #1 Hummus in New York. Now, I'm no hummus connoisseur, but I think I've had better. Tasted more like #6 to me, maybe. It's tasty, but also creamier and oilier than most, if that's your thing.Hummus rankings aside, 12 Chairs is a decent spot for dine-in and/or delivery, although perhaps more befitting for the latter.",1,1,

145,Mae W.,"New York, NY",21,46,0,4.0,9/18/2015,"Be of good cheer: 12 chairs has more than TWELVE chairs.The Middle Eastern dishes (such as the vegetarian cous-cous) are my favorite. But I have dined here with omnivores and they nod pleasantly while chowing down on the meat dishes, juices dripping from their chin. The portions at 12 Chairs are generous and I often have leftovers to take home.If you like to gather gossip and then post strangers' quaint comments on Facebook, you've come to the right place. You can easily hear the conversations from 12 chairs away. Some will call this place ""cozy and cramped.""  Yes, it can be but, even when there are only a few patrons, it's still noisy.  Maybe because the ceilings are low...?For this reason, I especially recommend 12 Chairs to those who are able to converse in ASL (American Sign Language). Not recommended as a ""first date"" spot -- -- if you're trying to get to know someone, the noise volume must be factored in.The service is efficient and pleasant. I always feel well-treated here.",2,2,3
146,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1704,228,4.0,5/23/2014,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to check out 12 Chairs other than the fact that maybe it was a little too close, and a little too convenient. My brother had been there before, and had a nice time. Mother's Day brunch seemed like a good opportunity, even without me Mums (who was out of town--don't judge).One of the best things about 12 Chairs is the location--it's on that quiet, wonderfully obscure sub-Houston stretch of MacDougal that starkly contrasts the beer-and-vomit-soaked northern stretch a mere two blocks away. There are trees, cute shops and low-rise buildings, and few people to compete with on the sidewalk. The cafe itself is cozy with nice wooden tables and plenty of open air for indoor al fresco dining in fair weather.Interestingly, the name 12 Chairs, at least according to their website, refers to their humble beginnings as a small cafe, not the Ilf and Petrov classic the few Russian Yelpers reading this might recognize (despite several patently Russian dishes on the menu). In any case, it's a Mediterranean with Jewish diaspora influences from both Middle East (Jachnun was the Sunday special that day) and Eastern Europe (borscht/dumplings). I contemplated the former--a slow-cooked Yemenite Jewish pastry, but savory always beats sweet with me so I defaulted to the Shakshuka (eggs poached in a spicy Moroccan tomato sauce), which came with an Israeli salad and optional Bulgarian feta cheese (come one, feta should be mandatory). It was right on point. You can't go wrong with the Israeli breakfast, either. The cafe au laits were good as well.Our slow Sunday was only briefly disrupted by a mentally deranged bum who wandered in to ask for food. When the staff generously presented him with some bread, he raised hell because it wasn't good enough for his lofty taste. A portly Iberian patron almost went to town on this ingrate, but luckily the staff intervened and handled the whole thing nicely.

It was served piping hot and was easily pulled apart to dip.  For our entree, we both had the pierogis topped also with mushrooms and onions, served with a side of sour cream.  The pierogis were lacking quite a bit of flavor, which knocks off a star for me.  They could have used some salt.  The sour cream helped but I'm not a fan of sour cream so I would have preferred there were made with more flavor in the first place.  The removal of another star has to do with the service.  While our waitress was very, very nice, she took forever to check on us.  She also took forever to get us our check and then forever when we were waiting to pay.  Also the waitress doesn't bring out the food, someone else does.  It was a bit confusing all around.  Overall, it's a nice place if you want something pretty authentic tasting, just don't be in a rush to leave.",2,1,

The first time I came I came for the shakshuka and we had a hard time deciding between the hummus falafel and the labneh and the nice Israeli waiter told us we should get the hummus falafel. He was not wrong! The shakshuka was fine, not my favorite in the city but still up there!When I came back, we ordered a bunch of small plates. There were only two of us and I think the waiter thought we were insane and was shocked at the amount of food we ordered but half of it came home with us anyways. We ordered the hummus falafel, 12 chairs fries (more like thick cut chips), labneh, lamb kofta and the special cauliflower with tehina. The lamb kofta was considered a small plate but there was a generous amount of lamb, a pita and an extra generous amount of tehina with it.Overall, the five plates were not only phenomenal but they were super affordable.

158,Anna S.,"New York, NY",2,44,3,4.0,12/23/2016,"Came here for a catch-up lunch with a friend. First time here for both of us, though we had heard good things. It was busy, but not too bad. We got a table as soon as my friend also arrived. The space is clean, cozy and welcoming, with table seating and bar seating. Service was good. They answered our questions about the menu, we didn't wait long to get food, our water carafe was always full, and they were good about taking unused plates away to make more space at the table. They also were patient with us when we took our time to catch-up and stayed past finishing our food. The only thing that could be improved is pacing of the courses, especially with smaller tables that can only hold so many plates. We weren't even halfway through our starter, when we got two more plates each and had to play table tetris to accommodate everything. Food was fantastic... for the most part. The hummus was solid. Really creamy with garlicky/lemony olive oil and whole chickpeas on top. It was served with Israeli pickles/olives and warm, fresh, fluffy pita bread that was perfection. A really great start to the meal! We then each got the lunch special, soup and half a sandwich. We both had the soups of the day - she had the Yemenite which she really enjoyed, I had the lentil and really liked it too. Both soups were perfectly seasoned and came out in large, filling portions. We both ordered the sabich sandwich to go with the soup. The bread was good, but the sandwich was unfortunately a disappointment otherwise. The bread to filling ratio was WAY off, with hardly any filling. Aside from the two small slices of Israeli pickle, it had absolutely no other seasoning. The accompanying tahini just masked the bland with bitter. The parsley was missing. Really unfortunate, considering the rest of the meal was so great.I'd give 3.5 stars, as for the most part it was a more than A-OK experience, but because of the disappointing sandwich, I feel like I need to go back and try more of their food before I can say I'm a definite fan.So I will plan to come back, will avoid the sandwiches going forward, and hope that the other dishes are as delicious as the hummus and soups.",,,

Usually a more decisive pair, it took us a good 15 minutes to narrow down our menu options. EVERYTHING sounded so good! Even then, we had to ask the adorable Israeli waiter for his suggestions, and ultimately followed them, given his enthusiasm. He chose: - Hummus, served with pita bread and Israeli pickles- Chicken schnitzel salad, a breaded chicken fillet served over Israeli salad with tahini dressing- Stuffed cabbage,stuffed with ground chicken, rice and veggiesEverything was delicious and authentic. The hummus were creamy and spiced to perfection. The main courses came out a bit too quickly following the hummus, though it's possible we were talking to much. The salad was a big hit, but the cabbage was comforting and equally good. Both portions were very filling.Somehow we found room for dessert and ordered the 12 Chairs Blintzes (after our waiter insisted that this was the BEST dessert).

169,A S.,"Manhattan, NY",151,11,0,1.0,2/11/2015,"Unprofessional, overpriced, overcrowded and loud. That's a short summary of my experience with 12 Chairs. Originally from Israel and living in New York for the last 5 years I constantly look for new ""home-like"" restaurants and food. I went to Hummus Place and enjoyed it time and time again, found Cafe Orlin which is always great and then got to 12 Chairs. 12 Chairs serves very mediocre food for higher than acceptable prices. Portions are quite small, food isn't very tasty and with all do respect very simple (as it should be). However, simple food should come for more ""simple"" price. Not in 12 Chairs - way overpriced for the type and quality of food they are serving. The soup is OK, the hummus is fine, the jachnun is good, and other simple dishes are again - OK. Nothing more than that, surely not the quality equivalents in Israel and certainly not as good as the dishes served in their competitors Hummus Place and Cafe Orlin. About the restaurant itself - it's very crowded and very noisy. There's barely any space to walk between tables and getting to the bathroom might seem a challenge for some. Finally - the service. I went to 12 Chairs with my friend a few weeks ago and put our name on the waiting-list. We were assured that we are the ""next"" ones to sit however waited for 30 minutes. We went again to the rude hostess and asked her about an empty table while she responded ""if no one will sit there you will."" We then waited for 10 more minutes. After nearly 40 minutes of waiting I went to the hostess again and asked her for an approximate time. Her response ""I don't know,"" after 40 minutes of waiting for mediocre over-priced food, made us leave the place. I am not sure where the hostess learned her bad, unprofessional manners or where she was trained for this job but she was absolutely terrible. Not only did she make us feel unwelcome in this place, but also convinced me that I will never return to 12 Chairs. Ever. I only hope that others will follow my footsteps. Again, the food is simply OK, and BAD for the price, it's not comfortable to sit there and perhaps most importantly - the staff are rude and unwelcoming (if any of the owners is reading this - we went there on Saturday around 1:00PM).

However, a million years ago, I used to have Sunday post clubbing brunches at a little Israeli owned place just off Prince St. With the high turnaround of store fronts and eateries in so many parts of the Village and Soho, I never expected that it would still be open. A chance meeting with a friend in the city compelled me to seek it out and sure enough, behold 12 CHAIRS is still going strong along with many of the original staff/family members :-)!!Now more spacious and decorated with signature sauces and branded middle eastern goodies, I could not wait to see if the menu still held true.

Our egg dishes also had the mixed mesclun green salad dressed with fresh lemon and sea salt. Perfection! My only missing link to the past was the side of potato disc home fries, but seriously.

Lesser complaints: My friend said the grilled chicken on her salad was tiny, almost like leftovers from when they cut up a normal chicken dinner. She wasn't looking for much but what they gave her was definitely a tiny portion. For the price, we expected more.I got the chicken pocket. It was good was but, again, chicken pieces were tiny.

Disappointed in our waiter's lack of basic knowledge of the menu and flavours, I decided to order one of the waiters eggplant recommendations, along with the hummus and kebabs. The hummus was a tahini strong flavoured recipe that was tasty and not too heavy. The lamb kebabs were juicy and a good side to the hummus. My buddy ordered the brie sandwich that he really enjoyed. We washed the food down with an Israeli Pinot Noir. The wine was good but I still prefer the French style Lebanese wines to Israeli wines.The atmosphere inside is quite appealing.

186,Frank S.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",20,10,0,2.0,9/30/2016,"Honestly, this place is OK overall. However the late night crowd can be summed up with one experience I recently had (Sept 2016). I wandered outside about to leave and a young lady asked if I was ""friends"" with someone I'd never heard of. Then when I told her I wasn't she became angry and said I was a ""weird promoter"" in a way that I assume was supposed to be offensive considering the way she kept saying it. She refused to believe I wasn't a promoter and continued to berate me for a few very awkward minutes. I realize as a 29 yr old I may be old AF and appear like some kind of weird ass man with zoot suitesque slim jeans, but this was a very odd situation which has guaranteed my refusal to come here again.",,,
187,Kenneth R.,"Berkeley, CA",865,1276,229,3.0,6/16/2013,"I thought that the food was really meh (at best!).  The redeeming features are the great atmosphere and pleasant personnel, and the relatively low prices.  We came for lunch; I ordered the potato omelet with a side cup (really a pretty large bowl) of hot borscht.  Everything tasted bland to me.  In particular, the borscht, which had been recommended by two of my dining companions, seemed to have no special properties.If you don't focus too hard on what you're eating, you can have a fine time here.  I might well come back.",1,,
188,Thutrang L.,"Philadelphia, PA",72,106,125,4.0,2/4/2016,"Cozy little place with great ambiance. It feels like you're eating in a foreign country which adds on to the overall experience of dining here. Tables are close, so you'll overhear conversations from your neighbors which makes this place loud and busy. Their drinks seems popular because everyone had some type of caffeine inspired drink.",1,1,1
189,Boaz G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,14,2,5.0,10/29/2016,Awesome Schnitzel... awesome Salad... if you are looking for great Israel food this is the place.,,,
190,Al L.,"New York, NY",0,93,108,3.0,9/20/2016,"A decent spot with good food. It's crowded on Friday evenings and sometimes the seating can lead to sun getting in your eyes. The service is decent. I would recommend it, hopefully when it isn't busy.",,,
191,David L.,"North Andover, MA",56,128,82,5.0,5/6/2016,"Tremendous breakfast recommendation from the Marriott Courtyard Soho.  Very pleasantly surprised to find it to be an Israeli restaurant (big fan!).  Fresh ingredients, relaxing atmoshere and clientele, and a great value to boot.  All was prepared with great care and beautifully presented.  Lots of standard breakfast and lunch fare to choose from, and some compelling Israeli/Middle Eastern/Eastern European selections too (matzoh brei, hummus, pierogi, schnitzel, stuffed cabbage, etc).  I hope to return next time in the area.",,,
192,Yon L.,"New York, NY",344,122,15,5.0,12/23/2014,"I would like to preface that I have only been for lunch but went two days in a row b/c it was that good. It's a smaller spot but they were able to accommodate our party of 5 on a same day lunch reso. Great and friendly service at a decent clip. The lamb burger is killer and comes with these great thin cut steak fries. Pierogies were super yummy (nothing mind blowing but the mushroom/onion topping was fantastic). Friends ordered the Israeli breakfast and it was definitely a treat. Lots of spreads and came with an oj and coffee for cheap. Didn't love the Sabich sandwich. I guess my only complaint is that I wish it were hot. Same goes for the Brie sandwich for my friend. Maybe we were cold, but we thought they'd both be better warm. Get the pomegranate mimosas (is there another name for these?) They're not too sweet and super-delish.",2,,1
193,Rory M.,"New York, NY",223,26,10,3.0,5/29/2015,"Came here once for lunch and it was definitely a treat! Let me just tell you one thing...their whole wheat pita was like a pillow! It was so soft, fluffy and warm MMM! Went in thinking I was going to have minimal carbs and I devoured 2 whole pitas with my meal! I ordered the eggs with cucumber and tomato salad that also came with several spreads and feta cheese. I have had better cucumber and tomato salad, but still tastes good! One of my friends had the cucumber and tomato salad with grilled chicken and tahini and THAT looked amazing! Note to remember that for next time I go in. My other friend had the hummus with lamb in it and that was delicious to mop up with my pillowy soft and delicious pita.The place does get a little packed during lunch so make sure to arrive early! The service could have been a little better and we did have to wait some time to order and get the check, but not long enough to where I'd never return.",,,
194,Tim S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,33,4.0,8/27/2016,"Terrific neighborhood spot.  We live around the corner and have walked by this place for years and never went in. It's a casual Israeli place with solid, good food at very reasonable priced. Atmosphere is very easy going with friendly service.  We had fish and chicken salad. Both were quite good. The babaganoush was great! We will be back.",,,
195,Hui L.,"Brooklyn, NY",111,48,1,4.0,7/17/2016,"This place is charming. The food tasted fresh and delicious, and the waiters/waitresses are extremely helpful. I've been here for brunch and dinner, both equally good. Intimate atmosphere for dates or catching up with friends.",,,
196,Richard R.,"Dover, NJ",55,81,20,4.0,6/5/2016,"A wonderful place for brunch. Every dish is full of flavor: The limburger, the hummus, the shakshouka. Attentive service, a buzz in the room, reasonable wines and beer, great coffee.I'm a big fan.",,,
197,Pauline M.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,40,350,4.0,10/6/2014,"Simple and the bomb Mediterranean/Israeli food. I think a bunch of small plates are the way to go. Ample pita bread is given to stuff your face with the various dips and spreads (whole wheat or white!). Don't miss out on the shakshuka (sweet and smoky with RUNNY EGG YOLK that is lacking in most shakshuka) and the Israeli guacamole (laced with delicious but unexpected hard boiled egg chunks, gives a nice contrasting firm texture--Israelis will put hard boiled egg on anything---no complaints). The hummus+falafel plate was meh, I've had better. Casual and quite atmosphere, chill spot for any meal.",4,2,2
198,Candy B.,"Forest Hills, NY",392,375,170,4.0,6/2/2013,"I love me some vegan middle eastern food! Selection, food, service, atmosphere - all great. I wouldn't hesitate coming back and it's a good location when it's a nice day/night with the windows open on a quiet street. They're open pretty late too so it's a good place to drop in if you started your night with a happy hour!My only complaint is that the tables are sticky even after they're wiped down. But whatever - that builds character, I can deal.",,1,1
199,Pamela H.,"Kensington, NY",18,28,4,5.0,1/23/2015,This was my first time here and I LOVED it. The food was fantastic and the service was great. I am looking forward to returning! I had the schnitzel with potatoes and salad...hummus to start. The pita is some of the best I have had since arriving in New York. Im really looking forward to going back!!!,1,,
