Decent priced well drinks, 10-12$ Manhattan standard prices. Great atmosphere with a fun and lively crowd that was friendly amongst groups! Everyone was quickly friends over jamming to classics and a wide collection (I chose a Coyote Ugly Classic). Great crowd and fun stop with tasty drinks at decent prices- karaoke Friday's and somewhere to watch sports in game days!",,,
1,Chuck G.,"Denver, CO",135,106,17,3.0,7/11/2018,"Place was a bit disappointing. We came here for a few pre Broadway drinks and food. The waitress was really nice and worked real hard.Problem was she was the only waitress. As we seated it started to get busy. Due to the lack of employees inside and outside the kitchen, they couldn't keep up at all.Food came out cold, late, or not at all. This business might have piss poor management. Food wasn't good enough to get a round two.Drinks were decent and well priced.",,,
2,Nick C.,"Manhattan, NY",66,526,235,4.0,8/5/2018,"It was beginning to downpour and I took refuge with an early dinner at the House of Brews. I was one of the only patrons there since it was too early for supper and past lunchtime. I was told to sit where I wanted and a menu was already on the high top. I asked for a glass of seltzer and began looking over the menu. It is a large space with a long bar and tables off to the side. The restrooms are located on the lower level. Their menu consists of burgers, salads, beer and cocktails along with sides. I decided to get the half pound burger medium well which came with lettuce, tomato and onion. I added mushrooms [$2] and swiss cheese [$1] and the options were for French fries, tater tots or a side salad. I got the salad. The meal arrived complete with a small vat of ketchup as well as salad dressing. The burger was cooked perfectly and was delicious. The waitress was accommodating and attentive and the restroom was well maintained. I would recommend and return.",1,,1

4,Jason J.,"San Francisco, CA",71,149,733,4.0,1/18/2017,"West Fourty-sixth Street between 8th and 9th Ave's has something for everybody; Italian, French, supper club with swing dancing, even an organic burger bar...numerous kitschy awnings adorn subterranean entrances...but to slake your thirst, likely after a hard day of cheap souvenir hunting,  I recommend something nestled toward 9th Ave...look for the illuminated sign that has the three requisite letters, ""BAR"". This is your ""House of Brews"". (must have been our lucky night too because HoB was hosting ""Trivia Night""). - Highly recommend.AMBIANCE:Once inside, HoB's unpretentious demeanor may catch you off guard - absent are clusters of gimmicky beer-brand artifacts (looking at you, Heartland Brewery), nor is there a Bavarian mascot grinning back at you as he jumps to click his heels, and surprise surprise the hostess isn't dressed like a St. Paulie Girl...none of that.Instead you have a long stretch of bar accompanied by comfortable seat-back stools; a soft yellow glow, all together it's a perfect set up for tipping back a Dogfish IPA.  Stool high tables hug the wall and the back has more tables still.  Friendly bar and wait staff will help you find a good place to rest. Your fanny pack is probably safe too.WHAT DID YOU HAVE:- Dogfish 60 Min IPA (12oz Bottle)- Bronx Banner Ale (Pint)- Pilsner Urquell (Glass Stein)- Korean BBQ Wings - tasted great but a tad thick on the bba sauce.SERVICE:- Checked on us at the appropriate times, made excellent recommendations, engaging and smiling. All good, y'all.TRIVIA NIGHT:- A mic'd MC takes the whole crowd through a series of questions, general pop culture, science, literature...funny ones...like, ""What is the word that has some left over if you take the Whole away.""...That would be wholesome, didn't get that one. It was a pleasant surprise, and kind of fun.SUMMARY:Perfect spot to hide from the Man Baby and the Naked Cowboy over in Time Square. I had already had dinner, nxt I'll try more of the menu.",14,14,13

The bar is fully stocked with liquor so pick your poison!  If you can't think of one then check out their creative cocktail concoctions on the small menu.

I had the burger beer combo and it was delicious and a good deal. (See picture)If you want a cheap bite after work they have $5 kitchen specials. Two soft tacos, loaded tots, half dozen wings for $5.

It was a little slower I'm guessing with the football season it should pick up. The music was awesome! The bartender who was also great and friendly had a playlist going with a variety of different music. Some old some new, that's the reason for the 4 stars. I even asked him to email me the playlist.

30,Paul C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,29,3,4.0,3/31/2017,"Love it now that it's renovated.  Feels more upscale and less like every other dark wood, frat house basement Irish pub in midtown.  Also - this location is much more ""accessible"" than the 51st Street sister - less of a crush, and you can actually have a conversation.Selection of beers is good to very good, with something pretty much for everyone and the menu is solid, if not particularly innovative.  Although as a result of the smaller overall footprint, I'd say the kitchen is very responsive and the food was all served hot.Staff was competent and friendly - and (as indicated in a couple of earlier reviews) the weeknight bartender - Linda - is an absolute delight. Warm and responsive - and makes everyone feel at home.  Really liked her.Overall, I would say an excellent alternative to the usual stuff on this touristy side of town.",,,

33,Greg C.,"Bangor, ME",30,187,58,2.0,12/30/2016,"The name for this place isn't really fair, as it doesn't seem beer is their focus. The 15 or so beers they have on draft are all big name brands that you can pretty much find anywhere. I ordered a fried buffalo chicken sandwich and received a grilled buffalo chicken sandwich. The food took a long time to come out and it wasn't even prepared adequately; the roll was too lightly toasted for the freshness of the bread, there was little chicken, little buffalo sauce, little lettuce and red onion, and a lot of bleu cheese. At least the bartender was able to bring me a side of buffalo sauce. The fries were fine. I guess the $10.95 lunchtime special made up slightly for the mediocrity of the meal. I have little reason to come back here with so many options nearby.",,,

I've also gotten free shit here as they host events. Got some free Harp tastings and key chain bottle opener once and I even got a free Guinness pint engraved with my name another time. Pretty damn sweet if I may say so, altho my friend ""stole"" mine as a keepsake EVEN THO she got her own (damn you Adrianna!).Basic pub fare here, nothing special. Tried a few things there and nothing really stood out. Staff is friendly, you can reserve the back area too which is good for going out with coworkers on a busy game night, plenty of TVs. Anyways, this is a good after work dive spot in the area to enjoy some beers and watch sports. If you come expecting gourmet food, well, don't.

They have a nice amount of brews, hence the name, and enjoyed the specific glasses for drinks like Guinness's and Stella's. To top it off, our bartender was clocking off for the night, asked politely to close our tab, and then offered drinks on the house. Let's just say, she was the perfect wingman that night .",2,,2

So I order a beer, wait 10 minutes, then am told that they don't have it. Then I order a different beer, and wait another 10 minutes. The wait staff is just as inefficient and clueless.

If I'm getting a $10 beer I do appreciate the effort of pouring it into the proper glass ( A Hefe gets a tall Wheat glass).

52,Amanda R.,"Philadelphia, PA",663,445,97,4.0,4/2/2013,"House of Brews sounds like it would be a craft beer lover's paradise, and indeed on some nights, it may have been. But with my companion's luck, we just couldn't seem to get it right. Our server had to come back multiple times to tell her that the beer she ordered was either out of stock, not cold at this time, or back-ordered (yes, it happened three times). She found suitable replacements, and we enjoyed the drinks that we did receive, it just seemed a little suspect to have so many things on your menu that aren't available on any given night. And maybe, just maybe, if they aren't available, let us know up front? Beer-bitterness aside, we got the hummus platter to share, which was actually quite large and could have served as a hearty snack for us if we hadn't eaten dinner already. It was a tad oily, so I don't know if I'd go back for more, but it did its job that night which was to soak up beer. The atmosphere in House of Brews was pretty chill, the music was at an average decibel and I could hear my friends talking. As long as they have the beers you're looking for, or you're laid back enough not to care, it's a pretty cool place to kick back and have a few. Keep in mind the neighborhood and the scene; beers here ain't cheap. But they are all tasty, so it just might be worth it.An update: the manager seems to be real swell. The review stands, but I'm bumping up to 4 stars for the warm & fuzzies I just got.",2,,2

57,Constantine P.,"Manhattan, NY",28,1,0,5.0,4/25/2017,"There are a lot of places to eat and drink around midtown and Hells Kitchen. The choices are endless. However, there is one place that stands out from the rest. The House of Brews on 46th Street between 8th and 9th is hands down the best place to get your drink on, socialize and get a bite to eat. For starters the decor is cozy and amazingly clean. The owners make sure that everything from the bar to the tables are spotless. The bartenders are knowledgeable, attentive, fast and friendly. Regardless of how busy they are, they always have time to serve you and carry a conversation with a smile on their face. A friend of mine asked for a sour beer. At the time they did not carry it. They made sure to order it within a week. They even contacted us to let us know they had it in stock. The pricing of their drinks are lower then comparable bars in the area. I work in the area and have been taking my co-workers for lunch to The House Of Brews. Every single one of them have been impressed by the food. They have ten dollar lunch specials that are simply delicious, especially for the price. Overall this bar offers a perfect experience regardless if your drinking, eating, socializing or a combination of all three. I normally do not post reviews and when I do I tend to give places average to slightly above average reviews. House Of Brews gets an exceptionally perfect rating. Don't miss out on a wonderful bar experience! Trust me when I say you are missing out if you don't give House of Brews a try.",,,

I love beer so checking out new micro-breweries is a priority for me! This restaurant on 46th street has a small front but pretty deep inside with a long bar on the left as you walk in. There are a few tables at the back too. We had about 40 minutes to kill, so ordered beer and fries. We tried their Oktober fest and another wheat based beer which were good but not great. Service and ambiance was good. Nice place to just chill and have a beer.",2,,2

I always expect the worst when I step into a bar close to all the midtown hotels and theaters, so I was happily surprised to find a place with friendly staff and a quiet atmosphere. I took advantage of the happy hour special - two-for-one Sam Adams Seasonal - but I did notice the extensive beer choice available. I wasn't in the mood for a full meal, but ordered the bbq chicken sliders as a snack to share. They were quite tasty.The bar doesn't have a concept besides ""dark place to drink beer,"" but you don't always need a cool Irish pub or a rowdy sports bar or a punk dive... sometimes you're specifically looking for a dark place to drink beer.",5,1,2

The atmosphere was nothing special.. It's more laid back and dark, There are TVs to watch as well & service was good. It was quite entertaining to watch this guy hit on a couple of girls at the bar.

(The 51st street location)I spend every thursday night here for their 15$ growlers. One of the best deals I've seen around the area. The atmosphere is relaxed and chill, with a lot of individuals coming here after work. It's a good place to bring friends to have a drink/appetizers before planning to go elsewhere. The upstairs area has great seating areas for your group. There's always sports games showing on the tvs (I'm not too into sports). I also come here occasionally for their boozy brunches. With unlimited mimosas, it comes to around $25+tax/tip per person. In NYC, that's a great deal! Plus, they're very good about asking if you'd like another round and refilling your drinks. The waitstaff is always sweet.The music selection is stuck in that 90s-2000s big hits and punk rock/alternative stage. It compliments my music tastes perfectly. It's cheesy and fun.",2,,1

The chipotle mayo that comes with it is to die for. The fries are great, super crispy and delicious. Highly recommend. I've had cocktails here to but I can't remember. They were just that good.

A poorly lit 'bar scene' had me recalling (horror) events earlier in the day, however this place seamed relatively clean for its initial appearance. We jumped right into an appetizer sampler of Nachos, Wings and Calamari. A good amount of food for the price, especially in Manhattan. Nothing noteworthy which is neither a good or bad thing. For dinner I ordered the Ruben as well as a 4 beer sampler which i picked the following bears at random (Angry.. Something?, Brooklyn Logger, Stella and Radeburger).The Ruben was tasty, but it was on one of those toasted wedges that wasn't cut right so it was kind of flowing over the sides. A tad difficult to manage but nothing crazy. The onion rings were good, especially with the dipping sauce.

Price for bottled beer was pretty pricey but high alcohol content. Or it might just be the beery husband got. I ordered a sampler of 4 beers for just $11! What a steal. And that's ANY four beers. No sneaky upcharges like other crappy bars I've been to. We took advantage of the $5 appetizer specials. Food was tasty but I was also 2 sheets to the wind ;),3,1,1

Just enough spice to not make you cry! :DHuge selection of beers and ciders. (Yes, I said ciders!) They had so many different import beers (mostly bottles) from all over the world.

I came in mid-afternoon, looking to both charge my laptop and relax with a drink, and not pay $10 for a beer I could get for half that somewhere not Times Square-adjacent. It was nigh on empty, which at that time of day was a-okay with me, and the server (Ivanna? Evonna? Give her a raise, her incredible service is a good 90% of why I'll be coming back) was immediately super friendly, set me up with the wifi-network and a table with an outlet for my laptop, under a heat vent to warm me up from my chilly walk to get there. She was attentive and easy-going, handling the other patrons near me with the same friendliness and quickness, all while keeping up an easy flow of conversation that really made it feel like she was genuinely invested in our having a good experience.The special on Stella - 2 for 1 - got me my first two beers at a bargain while I waiting to meet a friend. Fabulous menu of quality beers (they had Delirium Tremens! Best ever.) for when I wanted to really savor my drinks, too. Didn't try the food, but they had a couple good deals, sounded like, for burgers+beer. Reasonable prices for the serving sizes I saw on other patron's plates, too. I can't speak to how this bar is when it gets later and more crowded, but for a stop in from the cold for the afternoon/early evening, House of Brews set me up perfectly. I can't stress enough how great the server took care of her patrons, and how chill and exactly what I was looking for the atmosphere was, complete with a good internet connection and having a steady supply of good beer that didn't break the bank.Definitely a fan, absolutely coming back as soon as I can.

I was thoroughly disappointed. The restaurant was not full, but our waitress had the worst time remembering to bring condiments, not only to my table but to the one adjacent to us. My burger was cold before she brought them. During the span of 2 and a half hours, she checked in on the table twice; the other instances I had to flail my arms in the air to get her attention, which succeeded only half the time. She acted as if it was the customer's job to get her attention and explicitly stated that she was over at the bar and I should have gone to her; she obviously did not understand what ""waiting"" entailed. She was too busy chatting with her co-workers to bother.  I was in her shoes in the past and I would have been fired for being that indifferent toward customers. I hope the owners remedy this level of apathy possessed by the service staff at this restaurant because the food and drinks are good (which is why it's even getting 2 stars).",1,,

After our first round we ordered the cheese fries with bacon. Mmmm....bacon. After a few more rounds, we decided it was time for dinner. Several items caught my eye but the mac and cheese stood out. I asked one of the bartenders what her favorite thing to eat here was and she said the mac and cheese was the best. SOLD. Do yourself a favor and get it with buffalo chicken.

After some discussion, we agreed upon:*Brews Cheese Fries*Fried Calamari (BBQ or Buffalo)*Buffalo Chicken TendersThe chill bartender was on top of it, and managed to be a charming and borderline flirtatious guy without being creepy or solicitous. Within 15 minutes, he brought to us a big steel platter with a jumble of foods on it, none of which were standouts even amongst their genre of miscellaneous grease/pub food.But hey, the cheese fries were cheesy, the calamari was fried to high Heaven, and the buffalo chicken tenders were huge, hammered out affairs with that delightfully acidic, processed sauce that makes you cough on the intake.If I could do it again, I'd definitely replace the calamari (the most underwhelming of the three) and try out the chili instead. Or, if I weren't in such a greedy, communal-feasty mood with my companion(s), I'd take a chance on the burger. It looked good.I don't think I'd come here to watch any big game or party with a crowd - plenty of better places for that. However, I would return for another late-end happy hour with a friend, and might even try one of their fancy beers and see why they're really called the House of Brews.Bonus: They have match boxes in a bowl at the front with matches that are slightly longer than the usual crap matches you find for free elsewhere.

The TSA won't confiscate your mug, no language barrier and you can either walk, subway, bus or cab it home. (Drinking and driving bad)Granted, the menu is Euro-centric so you'll find Belgium, Germany, France and the UK well represented. My poison of choice was Kronenbourg (make that several) and the waitress zoomed in at the perfect moment for refill. The amount of time between beers was minimal and I like that.But the House of Brews is not just about brews. Yes, you can drink all you want but occasionally you may be hungry. For those moments of munchies, I recommend the sliders and nachos. Three sliders and a plate of nachos are enough to share for two relatively hungry people.The nachos featured copious amounts of cheese but nothing obscene. The sliders quickly slid into my mouth and I wanted more. (But my desire for more beer won out instead)On a week night after work don't expect a huge crowd. On a Friday much later than after work expect at crowd. It was a manageable crowd, however, and a table was secured with minimal wait.As for the crowd, it's a healthy mix of white collar suits, blue collar workers, no collar tourists and every one else. The charm of the HoB is that everyone is welcome and can feel comfortable, united by our pursuit of the brew. That's something democrats, republicans, anarcho-capitalists, communists, syndicalists, socialists, greens and silly party members can all agree upon.",3,1,2

The pulled pork sliders were easily one of the best things I sampled that night, from the assortment of appetizers my group had ordered.The only thing that really turned me off from this place is that they spend so much effort advertising sporting events like UFC PPV matches, and declare how awesome their 17 Giant Flat Screen TVs are and yet almost all of them are awkwardly positioned.My group had made reservations days in advance, making sure it was known we were coming for the fights and out of the 4 TVs in our area 3 were semi blocked by pillars/half walls. and the 4th could only been seen by half our group.

I was originally going to go to The Pony Bar but that was super crowded. This became the default bar since it was close by and we could actually walk around.There's a bunch of places for seating at this bar which can be a good thing when you're with a large group. Unfortunately we did get there at about 11:30 so all the tables were taken. However, this does seem like a pregaming bar so the tables cleared out fairly early. By 12:30ish there were two empty tables. Now this is the reason I'm giving this place only three stars. When a few of my friends went to go sit down, the waitress said they were reserved and we couldn't sit there. Five minutes later and we sit down anyway. It was already 12:30 and the place was starting to clear out. By the way, no one ever came to sit at the ""reserved"" tables. That just irritated me.Other than that the place was pretty good with service. Even when the bar was crowded none of us had to wait very long to get a drink and they are decently priced.

Clay is the coolest bartender ever. I would stop by just to say hi to him on nights out and sometimes stay for a few drinks. This is the only bar I feel comfortable going to alone.

It's nice to have found a place that has the selection they do, especially if you're into beers. The wait staff is friendly. One of their fall selections is a pumpkin ale that is served with a cinnamon-rimmed glass. Pretty neat combination, give it a try if they still have it on tap. Our group decided we wanted to try an appetizer and since we had a vegetarian with us, we opted for the spinach & artichoke dip. This is my pointer: don't make the same mistake! When you think spinach & artichoke dip, do you think spinach and artichoke baked into a bunch of melty-gooey cheese, or do you think nasty bits of spinach floating around in artichoke juice with bits of artichoke? Well, guess which one House of Brews specializes in? (Hint: it's not the good one). That said, it's the House of BREWS not the House of APPS so I'm still fine with giving 3 stars.

It was Sunday at 11am and I just rode a 10hr bus ride into New York City. Armed with 3hrs of sleep, severe hunger pains (the only stopover on the bus ride was a McDonalds for breakfast), a hankering for cheap wings, an itch to watch the football game, and 6 people I've only known for a week, I walked down the stairs and into this basement bar.I was surprised to see plenty of dark wood chars and tables, chic modern bar stools, leather banquettes, scattered blue lighting, a long communal bar table, ample televisions, and a tremendously large amount of brews available on tap.The lot of us were greeted happily as we were the first patrons of the day. We sat ourselves along the bar and in exhaustion, quietly watched the pregame show. The bar tender started chatting with us and some of the gang must have had some strong Canadian accents as our bartender pegged them right away. Seeing as we were from out of town he gave us all a Brooklyn Lager pint glass on the house to keep as a souvenir.The barman continued to chat with us nicely as he took our orders for 25cent wings and a bunch of beers. I decided to order all beers on tap and slowly move my way across, it sounded like a good idea at the time but when I got to the 10th beer I was well on my way to being absolutly hammered before 1pm. The beer selection was not only vast but delicious to boot.The wings came and were large, meaty, and perfectly seasoned. I got the hot wings but they were more like a tiny notch above mild. One person in our grouped like the wings so much he ordered another 25. The deal was 25wings at 25cents each with a purchase of a beverage during game time. Probably the best deal in the area and perfect for game time.Overall, we all left full, happy, and drunk as fiddler's bitch. It more than made up for the crap 10hr shit bus ride my school put together. One of the guys said he wanted to not only get married in this bar but TO this bar. I would say that's a little out there but 15beers before 1pm would do that to you. Drinks here are decently priced and if you're looking for brews it hits the spot with a large selection. The bar does fill up rather quickly on game days with regulars so you may want to get here a little early.

If you're indecisive they have beer flights on their draft selections or if you are in a group and are looking for a novelty they do 6 pint beer bongs of any draft.  Service was friendly, we were well looked after.So all in all a solid place to watch nfl on a sunday (less crowded than other pubs) and the food is all the more tasty when it's on special.",5,,2

So much for this being the ""house of brews"". My friend ended up with a Brooklyn Lager (can't get that anywhere else in NYC) and I got a bottle of Anchor Steam (nice, but they didn't even have it on tap...I mean, come ON)We also tried their nachos. They were unspectacular, but brought back memories. I remember when I was about 14 or 15 my highschool sweetie and I would ""make lunch"" or ""dinner"" together. Our usual standby was Stouffer's Mac and sometimes we'd branch out and get their french bread pizza. But when we really wanted to go ALL OUT, we bought some Tortitos, a can of black beans, some cheddar cheese, pickled jalapenos, some sour cream and some PACE baby, and we fixed up homemade NACHOS! Wasn't exactly the zenith of culinary exploits, but it wasn't the nadir either.

I appreciate the tables behind the bar stools - always convenient. It wasn't too crowded which is a good thing for a current patron, but there might be other conclusions to draw which I am not going into. The food was typical. We had Belgium frites. They were obviously a frozen variety, I would not give HOB encouragement by ordering them again. I liked the springy holder for it though! I imagined it to be many things: a head antenna, a cone to hear better with, one of those death ray guns, a flexing thing to work out with, futuristic cupholder, springboard (which I wanted to jump off so bad but I held back).Of note was the Cask beer. Wow, what a wild trip. I have never had a beer so intriguing before. This is an unpasteurized ale, served warm, in color almost of a guinness, and a feeling unlike any other beer I've had.

197,Simon L.,"San Francisco, CA",140,166,12,3.0,5/21/2008,"This place has a really great atmosphere, and they have some really great local brews (my current favorite is Checker Cab). In any case, I probably would've handed this place 4 stars, but when the waitress was bussing our table she Windexed my face (and drink)... :( Add insult to injury, she went so far as to only fill up my drink 3 quarters of the way. That was sad. But I'd come back again, it was a fun place.",1,1,1
198,Tony W.,"Staten Island, NY",108,1,0,5.0,1/28/2010,"This place is amazing.  The staff is great, friendly and will help you enjoy your time at their establishment.  The food and the beer selection is awesome.  Have a little trouble finding something new to drink?  Ask the staff and they'll give you a recommendation or just sample a beer.There are tv's at every angle and if there is a specific game your group wants to watch, they have no problem switching the channel.  If you are able to...grab a table, get some food, a beer bong, watch the game and enjoy the night.I don't know why...i live and work no where near this place but i love going back.  I definitely enjoy the atmosphere and you will too.",,,
199,Jocelyn G.,"Boston, MA",72,537,8,5.0,5/7/2009,"We stumbled upon this place after the Daily Show and had a great time. Not only were the bartenders friendly, they also turned the TV by us to hockey instead of baseball. They get extra points for that.  The food was tasty and plentiful, lots of different selections of beers.  The bartenders also did a buy back, which is always a nice bonus.",,,
