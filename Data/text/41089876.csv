1,Art V.,"Steinway, Queens, NY",2,19,43,2.0,11/18/2018,"Mediocre place, tasteless food, nice service. We went there since I like the Sarabeth's at Park & 27th, but it was a big disappointment. Chicken Pot Pie was dull, filled mostly with flour gravy with very few pieces of chicken and some whole boiler onions. I had to add salt and about a teaspoon of black pepper to get some taste. Burger was dry and fries was chewy. The only good dish was a crab guacamole. Rich, flavorful and seasoned. But 1 out of 4 dishes?!Last to mention - restrooms. Smell of a badly maintained restroom is a disgrace. And they are located right behind a service station next to the bar. So, staff can smell it all the time. Busy place, I understand, but frequent quick sanitizing would make it just fine.",,,
2,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",251,239,2100,3.0,11/15/2018,"If you're in east midtown and don't know where to go for breakfast or brunch head over to Sarabeth's! Whether you're a tourist or local, the food and drink options will hit the spot while definitely burning a hole in your wallet (latter does not apply to real Upper East Siders who use Balenciaga bags as everyday gym tote bags). This venue is first come first serve, so if you don't have the patience to wait for a table you can eat and drink at the bar. But be quick as the bar only has 5 seats! The entrance is quite small, so a few people are piled up in groups waiting for their names to be called. Meanwhile, the folks who arrived early are comfortably seated in tables that offer a lovely view of Central Park and all the carriage drawn horses. Larger tables are in the back and are chic, plush white booths that offer views looking more at the interior of the venue which doesn't offer too much of a personality (except for a touch of farm-to-table visuals where their marvelous raspberry strawberry jam is displayed).   Regardless of where you sit, you know you came here for one reason: to eat! The menu has classic staples with a high-end twist: juices called Four Flowers Juice (orange/pineapple/pomegranate/banana) for $11.50, steelcut oats/granola (available only until noon!) for $12-14, and sweet breakfast options like buttermilk, lemon & ricotta pancakes, French toast and pumpkin waffles all for the low price of $23.00.  While everything is essentially overly priced I have to say the food really hits the spot and is well made! A friend and I shared two items: the garden omelet (eggs with peas, zucchini, mushroom and cheddar cheese) and the sirloin burger with gruyere cheese (that cheese cost an extra ~$1.75) and fries. The omelet came with toast and happily enough, a side of their homemade jam that's actually for sale! It was the perfect portion for one, hungry person but also perfect to share and still feel full. The burger was cooked medium-well and even though I'm on team medium-rare it tasted great, especially with the cheese, fresh lettuce, onions and tomato. Washed these all down with the Four Flowers Juice which had I made at home, would've paired nicely with prosecco. One call out is that we actually sat at the bar and had gotten lucky since the wait was 20 minutes but seats had opened up. It was definitely cozy and my friend was stuck with a seat that wasn't too ideal as it was next to the line for the bathroom and the swinging bar door for waiters to pass through. Though we were deep into conversation and food, so it genuinely didn't matter. In the end, the venue gets a solid three stars for great food, drinks and service though it loses a star because pancakes should not lose $23 (and everything else is very overpriced).",1,,
3,Dave D.,"San Clemente, CA",7,119,106,4.0,10/20/2018,"Busy, load and good place for late Brunch or Lunch on Saturday at 2:30.  10 minute wait for 4 of us which wasn't bad.  Service was very good and quick.  We had a Garden Omelette, Avocado and Burrata Toast, Crab Cake Sandwich and a Wedge Salad.  All good, not great.  This is right across the street from Central Park so location was ideal.",2,,
4,Terri L.,"Weatherford, TX",0,13,36,5.0,11/17/2018,Amazing food!  Right in front of Central Park. We didn't experience a long wait. Food was great. Highly recommend the French toast! Will be back.,,,
5,Natalia N.,"Barcelona, Spain",0,8,4,5.0,11/17/2018,"It was completely worth the wait! Absolutely delicious! Prices are reasonable for what you get and it's worth it. Great place not only for breakfast, but for brunch as well. Portions are just about right - not too big but not don't leave you hungry either. My friend and I ordered the Goldi Lox which are scrambled eggs with salmon and cheese accompanied by a side muffin or bread of your choice, and the Avocado toast which came with a sunny side egg along with some mozarella cheese. Loved it all!",,,
6,Sofya K.,"Rego Park, NY",15,302,626,3.0,10/17/2018,"Sarabeth's is a NYC classic. Right off the park, fancy, etc. my husband and I came in for breakfast.... had the pancakes, which were good. But the price for pancakes plus coffee was so high - didn't reconcile to the portion size/ quality. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but it's not something so special that would warrant the price. Service was good, but 3 different folks came up to ask if they could take our plates while we were still eating. Come on, this is not fast food.",2,,
7,Danny P.,"Whittier, CA",1,2,4,3.0,10/21/2018,"Sarabeth, food is good, location is great in front of Central park, but price is not good for me. A cup of orange juice is $11. Anyway, i enjoyed food and good to be here, New York!",1,,
8,Kelly W.,"London, Canada",96,113,196,3.0,7/21/2018,"New York City food does not disappoint most of the time, but their prices do! Sarabeth's can be described in 3 words: tasty but expensive. My brother, sister in law and I stopped in for brunch on a Saturday morning after seeing the delicious food that diners outside were eating. We were seated inside, it is a beautiful restaurant and the staff members are kind and friendly. I ordered the morning fruit bowl ($13), bro got the eggs Benedict ($24) and sis got a granola bowl ($13). The food came out fast enough since the restaurant was quite busy. My fruit bowl came with peeled and sliced banana, strawberry, grapefruit and orange. The fruit was fresh but the portion was small. Bro's eggs Benedict was tasty but definitely overpriced and not worth $24, maybe $17 maximum. Sis was disappointed in her meal since it was just milk and granola, nothing special and pretty pricy. A bowl of fruit, eggs Benedict and granola costed us $60 after tip, which was way more expensive than what we imagined. Bottom line: good food, but lowering the prices isn't a bad idea.",2,1,1
9,Christine L.,"San Francisco, CA",1138,147,21,3.0,11/2/2018,"Food is amazing and front desk service is good. Our waiter was a bit flighty, pretty much got something wrong on every part of the order, wrong bread, forgot lemon and honey for tea, etc etc. otherwise food is great.",,,
10,Sandra M.,"Jersey City, NJ",55,469,369,5.0,11/3/2018,"Loved my ham turkey lunch item on the croissant. I also got a side of yummy bacon. I only ate half of my sandwich because I sampled too much of the bread muffin basket. We had a order of the kids grilled cheese and the pancakes. My 1 yo went to town on the french fries that came with the grilled cheese. My 3yo passed out so we sampled his pancakes and the yummy sliced strawberries it came with. Loved my coffee and the beau loved his latte. I'd come here again and get the same sandwich, prolly something that came with fries for my youngest...the chips(?) my sandwich came with was also yummy, but not as addicting as the fries. I'm not even that much into fries. Look forward to finding a reason to come back!",,,

12,Lisa Ann T.,"Clovis, CA",149,8,3,5.0,10/1/2018,"My mother and I were in New York for a few days and were looking for a brunch spot near our hotel. We landed on Sarabeth's due to the proximity and the reviews. Boy I'm glad we did. The wait times for inside and outside differ--just a heads up. We chose to sit inside since we were famished and the wait time was considerably shorter. The inside atmosphere is bustling and adorable. We were seated by a window with a nice view of a courtyard. I ordered the Lemon & Ricotta Pancakes and my mom ordered the Classic Benedict--both were amazing. We also split a carafe of Four Flower Mimosas--highly recommend!! Overall this was my favorite dining experience during our stay in NY. The atmosphere, food, and service were wonderful! I cannot wait to go back!",,,
13,Elisa H.,"New York, NY",1672,521,984,3.0,4/20/2018,"The lemon ricotta pancakes are fluffy and well flavored. I wish there were actually ricotta folded into the middle and not part of the batter.That said, I'm not exactly sure it justifies nearly $6 per flapjack. Good but I'm expecting mind-blowing at a $25 dish.",19,5,9
14,Dolonchapa C.,"New York, NY",157,260,813,4.0,4/22/2018,"3.5 stars I'll say not 4Came here for Sunday brunch. Got seated immediately. Outside seating is mostly for 2 people. Service was warm, menu is good, drinks are very good. Coffee was pretty good/ standard. Not too excessively strong. Just right. Whatever coffee they use is pretty great.The Bellini was tasty. You don't taste the booze but it's highly refreshing. The three pepper home fries was very very nice. We asked for hot sauce and our server got two. The Valentina one (apparently from Australia) was AMAZING. Ordering it when I get home. Pork sausage comes on an apricot spread :) very nice flavors. Crab cake Benedict was done right. Did not expect anything less though. However I wouldn't mind if te crab cake was a tad thicker ;) It comes with a very refreshing salad. We went pretty late so croissants and scones were all gone. Try their blueberry corn muffin- you won't regret. The sourdough tasted a bit like sourdough but did not look like one lol. Wonder how they did that;)Farmers omlet was the star of our meal. Beautiful flavors, complimenting ingredients all come together perfectly. A slight let down was our vegetable frittata. Very bland, never tasted the gruyere, and it was also low on salt. :( :( :( *there were stains on the coffee mugs and saucers. Letdown for a place like this. Especially once you have paid 5$ for coffee*Very good music choice btw!Overall a little confused if we wana come back. But maybe for the damn good cocktails.",2,,1
15,Masanori D.,"Bellingham, WA",308,437,861,2.0,3/31/2018,"It's a cute restaurant, but it's overrated. Their food is fine, but I just don't understand why people want to wait for a long time and pay this much for their just ok food. I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict. It was nothing special. It was too expensive ($30) and the eggs are so overcooked. I do not recommend this restaurant at all. I would rather go to the Plaza Food Hall. It's a food court, but a very fancy one. It's much funner and it's right next door in the basement (entrance is on 59th street, same as Sarabeth's).******************************If you found something useful in my review, please hit ""useful"" so that I can improve my reviews.

16,Ilona P.,"Cleveland, OH",73,179,795,3.0,3/25/2018,"The place was in the middle of the Manhattan and next to Central Park. As we stayed in the plaza hotel, the place was around the corner. First impression of the place was positive but not impressive. The wait line was around 10 minutes what wasn't bad at all. However, we got table next to the entrance to the kitchen. So, the traffic of the servers was heavy, and plus, we heard all noises from the kitchen. Seriously, I would even eliminate this table.Next, the server was nice but not attentive. The place was busy so we understood the waiter's attitude. I ordered a specialty mimosa and it was delicious. Also, o ordered oat meal with cherry topping and it was so-so. I don't know if we would come back to this place. Somewhat, we wasn't impressed by this place.",2,,
17,Olivia P.,"Raleigh, NC",25,168,333,4.0,3/29/2018,"In the city for the weekend and this place was right down the block from our hotel. We had no reservation and the waiting area was packed but the wait wasn't very long because the food comes fast! The servers want you to order fast! And they expect to turn the tables fast! (noticing a theme here??) Tourists and locals alike dine here.PROS- great location on central park, food comes fast, lots of variety on the menu, DELICIOUS quality food, large portions so you will definitely not leave hungry!CONS- rushed service, server never smiled one time, tables are packed into every square foot and every corner of the place like a Jenga game, servers having loud conversations and using bad language amongst themselves in the dining area. I don't think there's an incentive to provide excellent guest service since they will always have business due to the location and the food but it would be great if they put a little focus on it anyway...We had caramelized apple oatmeal, apple cinnamon french toast, home fries, sourdough toast, flower juice (blend of carrot/apple/?), and coffee. Everything tasted great!*tip* the front dining room has a view of Central Park S. but it's like being in a fishbowl because of the entire waiting area next to you, and depending upon where your table is, there could be people standing right next to you as you dine, waiting for a table.",1,,
18,Kyle W.,"Las Vegas, NV",7,259,3,3.0,10/10/2018,"As several yelpers have said, it is over priced- but it is next door to the Plaza with a small outdoor dining space looking into the park. You are paying for the location, the people watching and a $75 breakfast for two. I get it, its NYC, but there are several better spots within walking distance that are just as good for 40% of the price.  Actually the french toast and bacon are really really good. I would recommend if your not price conscious",,,
19,Sarah K.,"Westpark, CA",38,75,132,4.0,3/24/2018,"Found this brunch/lunch place in upper East side and was super excited to try it. I went on on a Saturday afternoon and I was told they don't take reservations but the wait time was not too badThe ambience is semi-formal, the layout of the restaurant is really cute and brunch-y. I ordered the raspberry almond French toast and it was delicious!! The portions were surprisingly big; 3 big pieces of toast. The maple syrup it came with was sooooo good, it's not super thick and overbearing.",1,,
20,Valerie T.,"Fremont, CA",491,138,408,4.0,1/29/2018,"Came here on a cloudy weekday morning last spring during my spring break with my best friend looking for breakfast before visiting the Met. Slightly fancy brunch place near a bunch of fancy hotels... glad my friend and I dressed chic that day ;) Since we came on a weekday and a bit early, we didn't wait too long. My friend ordered Garden Omelette with coffee, and I ordered a hot chocolate with the buttermilk pancakes and strawberries. These buttermilk pancakes were SO GOOD - fluffy, buttery, and warm. I'm really glad I opted for the pancakes rather then my usual brunch order (eggs benedict). Hot chocolate was also sweet and creamy.",2,1,1
21,Ryan B.,"San Antonio, TX",16,87,121,5.0,7/18/2018,Great breakfast. The salmon eggs benedict rocked!! The coffee was good as well. There was a line for it to open by 8am.,,,
22,Stephanie D.,"San Jose, CA",90,15,0,5.0,10/16/2018,"Went here on a Monday night with a group of 6 ladies on our first visit to NYC. Sarabeth's is wonderful! We received a warm welcome the moment we entered and admired the cozy, upscale decor. We were seated in a private room next to the wine cellar, and immediately told of ""half price wine Monday!"" What a delight! The food was tasty (Truffle fries were out of this world!!!), service was spot on, and ambiance on point.After our meal we had a conversation with Debbie, the manager. She was friendly, down to earth and funny! She thanked us for coming, and gave us dining advice for an upcoming Vegas trip we are taking later this month.

Can't wait to go back.",,,
24,Adam Z.,"Las Vegas, NV",8,77,90,3.0,7/2/2018,"The food was ok, it was just overpriced. My girlfriend and I shared an adult grilled cheese (comes with a creamy tomato soup), and a chicken pot pie for lunch.I don't like mushrooms so I asked if they could leave them off of the chicken pot pie. The server responded that it's premade. For a $25+ dish, that isn't right. Anyway, the chicken pot pie was solid, but nothing spectacular. I thought it was too creamy, I would prefer more complexity of flavor.Similar with the adult grilled cheese (also around $25). The tomato soup was very creamy. Such a creamy soup didn't really complement the creamy grilled cheese, IMHO. It was solid though, just nothing memorable.",,,1
25,Khadija Q.,"Queens, NY",73,4,2,5.0,10/21/2018,Great place for brunch on the weekends! It's usually always packed so I'd suggest taking a reservation beforehand specially if you're going on a Sunday. Had there eggs benedict and freshly squeezed juice - it would be safe to say they were the best eggs benedict I've had in a long long time. Would give it all 5 stars!,,,
26,Breann R.,"Claremont, CA",3,6,2,1.0,11/3/2018,You are paying for the location of this breakfast spot. Horrible service and the food was 5/10 at best. When you factor in the price for the quality and presentation of the food...not worth it. I will say it's kind of hard to find a breakfast spot to sit and enjoy. Again rude server and mediocre food. Herd pass on this over priced breakfast.,,,
27,Jayson C.,"New York, NY",976,190,913,5.0,1/13/2018,My best friend was in town so I wanted to take him somewhere for brunch and my first thought was Sarabeth's. I have been to the one in midtown and loved it. Walking on I was quite impressive and different from the other location. The hostess greeted us right away and being as I had a reservation we were ushered to our seat promptly. The restaurant was packed. The decor was wonderful and the staff was quite attentive. We both chose eggs benedict. I chose the classic and he chose the crab cake option. When I had the dish before I wasn't fond of the muffin that the eggs were served on so I asked not to have it. But me being a smidge glutinous asked for a kids lemon ricotta pan lacked to be added to my order. It was absolutely amazing. I loved every bite that I had. The only gripe I have is that the coffee was way too bitter. That's all!Run don't walk to Sarabeth's!!,,,
28,Emily G.,"Northwest Raleigh, Raleigh, NC",229,13,12,3.0,8/8/2018,"Don't let the three stars fool you into thinking I did not enjoy the food. I absolutely did. This place was raved about by many friends and many yelp reviewers. My mom and I decided to give it a try. SERVICE: The boy out front was rude and the men inside seemed to have a ""holier than thou"" attitude. Our waitress wasn't very welcoming or too much of a people person but she got us in and out in 30 minutes for us to catch our flight. (They have a place by the hostess stand to check your luggage, it's free). I would say the friendliness of the place gets a 2.5 only due to our waitress adding some positive vibes. FOOD: I heard amazing reviews about their hot chocolate..... let's just say, save your money, go to the store and buy the Swiss packets. It's much better. I got the French Toast with strawberry's and Mom got the Pancakes. They were very very good. Our bill at the end was $69.35.... I'd say yes overpriced but honestly that's about the price of every meal we had on this trip.  The portions are large you could easily split them! It's a cute little place across from Central Park but I didn't think it was worth all the hype. If you're looking for a cute little breakfast spot with options and aren't worried about cost, you might as well drop by.",,,
29,Bronson A.,"Bothell, WA",0,41,0,1.0,10/3/2018,"Goldie Lox omelette was atrocious. At any given time there were eight or nine wait staff standing aboot' (no, I'm not Canadian). The only phrase nose ring boy at the front knows is, ""it'll be about five minutes, guys"". We took a nice walk in Central Park afterwards. The coffee is subpar, and the waiter finally filled my water glass the second time after he handed us the check. Just not enough water to rinse this trashy meal out of my mouth. What an absolute horrid breakfast. So far New York has not impressed me with food. The prices sure disappoint.",,,
30,Ashleigh B.,"Lumberton, NC",1,12,14,4.0,10/7/2018,"So breakfast am I right? I'm assuming you like breakfast and would like to eat yummy breakfast food. Well let me tell you a story. I went to nyc for a few days and one morning I woke up to a craving for breakfast food. Not just any McDonald or BK trash but breakfast food that seemed like I was eating food in a movie but they don't actually eat the food, you know the one. Seriously a movie will have a spread of food on the table and no one eats it. Everyone's all ""thanks mom the food looks great"" let me just put a bite on my fork and never eat it because ha this is a movie we don't need food who needs food. Anyways my point is you should give it a try.",,,
31,Steven Z.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",59,221,19,2.0,5/24/2018,"Overpriced with a snobbish attitude to boot. I didn't realize this place would be so expensive before we sat down. One would think for the price you pay that you are getting an exemplary experience, but this place is well far from that. Came for breakfast. $6 coffees that were COLD upon served. Had to ask for them to be brought again. Throughout the meal the coffee was not even refilled or attended to. The food was just ok. Simple omelettes that anyone could make. Nothing special. Our server seemed to have little interest in us. Even to the point where it almost looked like he didn't want to be there based on his expression and mannerisms. He shuffled and dragged his feet as he walked around. Really odd. I wouldn't come back, especially for the crazy upscale pricing. Must be priced that way only because it's across from the park.",1,,

Updated review","3.5 This place has great customer service, nice food area and good food, but it is dumb expensive. They also had a line to the restroom since it's only one gender neutral one. Coffee here is $10 and if you add bacon it's $11.50, sausage is $13.00. My kid had one glass of orange juice with his pancakes and it was $10.50 (FuGetAboutIttttt) There is no reason this stuff is this expensive. We ended up paying over$100 for just a basic $35 IHOP breakfast obviously minus the lobster. I got the bill at the end and wanted to give the food back!  I'm adding pictures and prices to this so you can see. Have a nice day!",,,

Although the wait for a table took a little bit of time it was most definitely worth it.As soon as we sat down our waiter greeted us very kindly and personable asking where we were from and giving us some recommendations. We ordered almond French toast and an omelet. The food came in a timely fashion and the French toast was to die for! I cannot recommend it more. The almond taste was really there with the fruit!

37,Courtney S.,"New York, NY",4,89,6,4.0,8/19/2018,Super cute place for brunch. The location is prime. The food is good but not to die for. I also don't think they have many options on the brunch menu and the prices are a little high. Not to mention the wait is always crazy unless you go on an off time. It's definitely a must if you're visiting Central Park because of the proximity to the park but other than that there are other brunch spots that i would recommend over sarabeths.,,,

Though crowded the wait was only 20 minutes on a Saturday at 12 p.m. The bloody mary was perfect mix of spicy and unique with the peppers on top.

The soup was amazing, it was creamy w/chunks of tomato & garnished w/a drizzle of balsamic, cheese & chives. The soup was elegantly plated & luxurious. It was the perfect start to my meal.  A basket w/an assortment of fancy breads along w/butter was also brought to the table. For the main course I ordered the Pan Roasted Faroe Island Salmon w/corn purée, bacon lardons, pearl onions, dandelion greens. The salmon was perfectly cooked. The skin was crispy & the fish was tender.  I paired this w/ a glass of Prosecco which was perfect.For dessert I had the Creme Brûlée. This was the perfect finish to my meal. A delicious meal!

They are worth the 24 USD (with taxes). The service is ok, and the place is usually full, so try to make a reservation. I went twice in 4 days to have breakfast/brunch. I also tried the pumpkin waffle but it wasn't as good as the pancakes. I think this is a must if you are in NY.",,1,

Brunch has all the options in the world and it's delicious! Pancakes, eggs, big French toast, fresh fruit.. everything!

The French toast was delicious but the eggs Benedict was the best we had ever had. We will definitely be back for that especially. Service was great.

If you're reading the reviews and wondering if they do something other than brunch, I can vouch for Sarabeth's.We were celebrating our anniversary and were visiting the city ahead of leaving on a cruise the next day. We wanted something nice but not fussy, and we wanted something close to Central Park because my wife wanted to do a carriage ride. It turns out this is right across the street, so it checked all of the boxes.Service was fantastic. Our server was attentive and paced the meal well so we didn't feel rushed. While the runner forgot to bring me a steak knife for my filet, the meat was tender enough that I was able to cut it with the butter knife until the server noticed the error. I would return.",1,1,1

52,Anh N.,"Aurora, CO",125,68,77,4.0,8/17/2017,"We had reservations for brunch on a Friday morning. We showed up 10 minutes late but had called ahead to let them know. As soon as we walked in, it was crazy busy!! Definitely one of those days you would hope you made a reservation. But I did notice some parties were seated pretty quickly! I definitely noticed it's a touristy spot, especially because I went in the summertime. The ambiance was very classy and lively! Everyone seemed to be having a great time. The servers were very polite. I would give service a 10/10. They were attentive and actually quite fancy! I ordered a four flower mimosa and the Goldie lox with a pumpkin muffin. The mimosa honestly just tasted like a regular mimosa, but it costed me $14. Probably the alcohol they used was high quality, but I was disappointed that their four flowers juice didn't have a unique taste. The omelette was so good, but got extremely heavy after a while. The smoked salmon was delicious and the eggs were so fluffy. The cream cheese is what put it over the top for me. It was too much in there and unequally distributed. I got random large chunks of the cream cheese, then sometimes none. The muffin was sooo good and it came with their famous preserves. I wish I could have taken some home with me but I was stuffed after my meal. Although I loved the ambiance and service, the food didn't seem worth it's price to me. Maybe if I ever go back, I will try something different and see if it changes my mind. But unfortunately that's what takes away from being 5 stars is the discrepancy between food and prices.",1,,

But whatever we ordered tasted great! ...(basically eggs) The reason I'm giving it 3 stars is that even though our table was ready, the hostess wouldn't seat us till the last member of our party arrived... though we told her the person was parking and would be in any minute and the rest of us could place our orders. Secondly, the servers were rushing everyone like crazy! Like, you'd pause while eating your huge serving of eggs and somebody would materialize next to you and be like 'Are you done?'

The flavor of salmon was quite distinct and the eggs well made. The hollandaise sauce was very well made. I am used to spicy and bold flavors and that was the only thing that disappointed me slightly here. The flavors were repetitive with every bite.

I ordered the eggs Benedict delightful but the muffin was a bit hard even to cut. Tables are a bit close together, my fiancé nearly took out the table trying to get around to go to the bathroom. The cappuccino was a bit bland. Wonderful waiter, beautiful atmosphere. Quick on refills and did not interrupt our conversation just to check if we needed anything.

I hope you're actually planning on eating here or else I can't seat you for photos and likes"".Really? after checking into the Plaza, trying to unwind with a stroll around the block, maybe hit the park for a bit, I am being asked if I'm a tourist and if I'm going to actually eat.

The short rib hash was delicious. I've never tried the pancakes, but others gave them rave reviews. Still, you are paying for the location and the name.

I ordered a classic breakfast: Pancakes, scrambled eggs and a side of bacon ($11.50). That is SO pricey for bacon, but they are giving you 8-9 thick and long slices that will fill you up! The eggs were pillow-like and yummy! I also had mimosas which were fantastic as well with a hint of grapefruit (2). My total was about 80-90 dollars.

87,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",543,547,2523,4.0,4/5/2017,Surprisingly.  This is my first time at sarabeths. Across from Central Park. Located at 40 Central Park south. I am familiar with sarabeths but have never thought of eating here. Passed this location a few times in the past. I was looking for a place close by. I said a few places out loud close to the park. She said sarabeths. Omg haven't been there in awhile. Let's go. So we didSo we came for the brunch. I called to make reservations. Apparently they don't take resers. So I asked how many seats they had left and the hostess said I would be fine if I came in the next 30 mins. We arrived. We were sat promptly. The staff was accommodating. Gave us a area that was nice. On the outside sarabeths looks like you would have to be more business attire. But when we were seated there was everyone from suit and ties. To a family of 4 with there kids. One of which was a baby. FOODOur waiter was very nice. He knew the menu off the top of his head. This was for brunch. Most of the ingredients was from local farms or from farms upstate. I liked that. Organic was listed whenever possible. We asked for a recommendation. My cousin dident know if she wanted pancakes or French toast. He was like def French toast. She was going to order some sides and the waiter saved us from ordering too much food. I ordered the eggs Benedict. For $22 it was good. I asked for regular bacon instead of Canadian. He said no problem. I could tell the holiness sauce was made from scratch. The eggs were cooked perfectly. The bacon was good. Was from Sullivan county upstate. As all of you know I'm a tea snob. I ordered English breakfast tea. It was harney and sons English breakfast. That's what I drink everyday at home. So it was a nice touch. Good cuppa. The only complaint. If we had one. Waiters kept walking by. I don't know if our table was in a lane where the staff carys dishes out. But it was constant. The kid was crying but you can't do anything about that it's life. Overall. My first time at Sara Beth's was good. It's close to everything located at 40 Central Park south. I would come here again for breakfast or brunch maybe try another location tho. Might not be as touristy or loud. But overall good experiencePROS:- local and organic most of he menu- server knew the menu - close to everythingCONS:- very loud brunch.,8,7,8

The interior design is well done as a fancy brunch cafe. Service (3/5):  The host greeted us well but there was quite some waiting time and the server checked on us once only the whole time before we asked for check.

Not very special in terms of creativity but very well made and food taste fresh. Definitely try their Benedict!Price(3/5): For four people including one appetizer and tip it was about $150.

Came on a recommendation from a friend who said they serve the best pancakes he's ever had. Read a whole bunch of reviews that said the same thing, so I wasn't going to let the chance pass me by to jump on the bandwagon. Uhhh yeah, make room because I'm a-coming a-board. These aren't just pancakes see, they're flipping buttermilk magic in the air. I ate all 5, but I probably could have eaten 10. They were delicious, and almost tasted like muffins, but we're still light & fluffy with a bit of a crisp on the outside. Other friends & family at the table had omelettes that were fantastic, it was a really great breakfast at 2:45pm.I would recommend stopping in, just be prepared. This isn't Denny's breakfast and these aren't Denny's prices. You may to have to save a few pennies or return some empties because it ain't cheap.",,1,

While the atmosphere itself is nice and the food decent neither is good enough to out way the over all attitude of the place not to mention the expense. The staff is a luff and in attentive seems like they/'d rather be doing anything but wait on you. They hardly make eye contact and even though they are standing around watching you still have to latterly flag them down to get just about anything including coffee refills. The only thing they seem to be interested in refilling is the water. Strange. They are just incredibly unfriendly and disinterested. Additionally out right saying on your menu that you will make no substations even for something as simple as egg whites is rude, inconsiderate, arrogant, and lazy. What happens if someone has allergies, or dietary issues? Oh also, the restaurant is completely not wheel chair excess able which I'm pretty sure is against the law. I think the only reason people come here is because it's so close to hotels. As for the food it's just basic diner food, nothing all that special, certainly nothing good enough to make up for rude service and obnoxious policies. The prices are over blown too. Not good, don't waist your time or your money.",1,,

I felt underdressed in my tee shirt and jeans. I had the crab eggs benedict, and it was a little skimpy on the hollandaise (which we all know is one of the best things about eggs benedict). My son had the lemon ricotta pancakes, and had to ask for more syrup. They brought a very small (about 5 tablespoons worth) dish. He said the pancakes were great, though. Service never smiled once!

However, after my meal, I was just wondering maybe those people were just into some so called restaurant star-ranking or trendy blogger's recommendations... they should really listen to Yelp instead... I ordered salmon benedict and I gave it a meh. The salad on my plate looked and tasted really boring. I wish they could just add some fun in it. English muffins with salmon and the eggs were really small. Maybe this place would be terrific for tourists to feel about some sort of New York life they learned from TV and experience it.

105,Jeannie T.,"Queens, NY",316,454,6448,4.0,2/16/2017,"Across from Central Park so this locale feels super chic and elite. Not to mention the pretty people at lunch time sitting outside on the sidewalk dining area. I ventured here on a Wednesday night after work to sample their Winter restaurant week menu. The choices like many NYC RW menus had a salad, a protein entree, and two limited choice desserts to choose from. However, their choice offerings were just the tickle I was looking for to get me in the door. Knowing full well this place is usually pricey, RW is a good time to try it.I ordered the scallop carpacio as my appetizer (RW menu). The citrus and vinegary top notes opened my appetite for dinner so I must say it was a great starter option. The scallops were large in size, no chinzy small portions here. And I had eight pieces to boot, great for sharing. It was beautifully plated with radiccio slices and baby green sprouts. The sprouts have a bitter sweet taste that paired well with the citrus and orange zest. The scallops themselves rested on top of larger slices of radishes, almost palm sized medallions. They looked like delicate flowers with it's pretty purple coloring.My party ordered the crab meat guacamole & chips to share as their appetizer.  I stole a bite here and there, the large chunks of crab meat and hint of lime juice was refreshing. I hesitated trying this because of the cilantro and jalapeno (as I don't like cilantro and was worried about the heat in the jalapeno) but it enhanced the flavors of the dish and made it all work.My entree was a 10 oz. Ribeye steak (from the RW menu) - ordered it medium rare.  Was a little more medium and less rare than I wanted but it was fine.  You could taste the grain of the beef and it had it's natural juices coming out when I cut into it.  It was very good.  No complaints.  It was accompanied by a side of roasted veggies but I was aiming for the meat - wrapped my veggie to go.  LOLSince I ordered off the RW menu, my third course was dessert - of which I ordered the ""S'mores"".  It was awesome...even had that burnt/campfire toasted smell to it.  They browned the marshmallows on the top to give it that campfire look.  The layers of melted, gooey marshmallows, chocolate pudding, and graham cracker pieces...oh so yummy.  If I wasn't stuffed already, I probably would've dogged the whole thing.  It was served in a glass container - each ingredient, layer upon layer.  It's a must try if you see it on the menu.",2,1,1

My boyfriend Kris and his parents have had it in Japan and said that they have had it in Japan and the French toast is fluffier there.

We live in NYC and go out with our group of friends for dinners often.When we got there - there was no reservation. Whether or not it was our mistake, the host spent 2-3 minutes trying to find the reservation before we had to ask if they could or couldn't accommodate a group of 10 (with or without a reservation). Seeing as the restaurant was no more than half-full, of course they could, yet they seated us in a cramped configuration in plain view of a nice and empty back area.But that was just the beginning...It continued by being told there was no bread for the table, and there was no alternate offered.When we ready to order appetizers, one of the guests ordered the adult grilled cheese and soup as an appetizer, but when the rest of the appetizers came, his food wasn't there. It finally came with the entrees, after he clearly asked for it early.When we were ordering our main courses, the waitress left the table without taking one of our guests' orders. She came back a couple minutes later and finally got the last order.Another guest ordered the prix fixe (honestly, just for the creme brûlée). When he ordered, he specified each of his courses. Then, when it came time to order dessert for the rest of the table, we were at that point told there was no creme brûlée. I ordered a second martini.

I suppose if the weather were warmer people would have been able to dine and wait for tables outdoors but it wasn't warm enough for that. We checked in and confirmed we had a reservation and then waited around 20+ minutes to be seated. That part was really annoying, especially given that my legs were pretty tired and sore from the marathon the day before and it appeared they may have taken several parties arriving after us until my boyfriend went to ask and was told we were next. Upon being seated service was super speedy to all tables! Drinks were down quickly and food was coming out of the kitchen in seriously no time. This made the experience better. I ordered the jalapeno and cheddar omelette with a pumpkin muffin. I'm not usually big on eggs and even surprised myself with going savory over pancakes or french toast but this was a decent selection. The pumpkin muffin and preserves were very tasty.My boyfriend had the Farmers Omelette and seemed to enjoy it, with sourdough toast.We both had coffees and I had a celebratory mimosa.Our breakfast was good, but I wouldn't go as far as saying this is the best brekke in NYC.

We were seated in the back, and if you have Sprint, that area of Sarabeth's doesn't fare well for reception. The crowd was a bit mixed, with businessmen and tourists grabbing some breakfast. I did feel like the ambiance there took itself a bit more seriously than how a lot of the tourists were dressed, if that makes sense.The Crab Cake Benedict was my choice, and it was really rich and had a really good salad included.

(neither cos i am not a sweet tooth person)Inconsistent service. At one point, the waiter was checking on us if everything okay while on the other, our water wasn't refill and partial clearing plates. Cleared the bread basket but not the butter. Cleared our appetitzer plates but not our entrees, despite all plates were empty.  Overall, I would recommend to go for their breakfast for their famous benedict eggs, regardless classic or crab cake or salmon. However I will not return to this location but would go Lord Taylor Fifth's avenue because it is quiet and great service.",,,
140,Benjamin C.,"Nashville, TN",167,56,19,4.0,11/24/2017,My wife and I stopped here for a Saturday brunch. We waited about 25 minutes but it was nice to get out of the cold. Once we were seated and had ordered our meals the food was delivered exceptionally fast. My wife got the almond crusted French toast. It was excellent. Not too sweet and a great addition with the almonds. I got the farmers omelette. It was ok at best but the grueyre cheese was delicious. Overall we were pleased with Sarabeth's and would recommend it to anyone in the city.,2,,1
141,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,324,577,3.0,1/7/2017,"Sarabeth's offers one of the most typical New York City brunch experiences. Prime location and a somewhat famous name means they are often quite busy. We came here with some of our guests and while we left satisfied, no one was overly impressed.We were a group of nine for brunch on a Sunday morning. We got there and put our names down and were told to wait for forty minutes, which was fair but ended up taking a bit longer than that. One of the hostesses had some serious attitude though. We went to check on the state of our table and she acted like our name was nowhere on the list, and then gave us a vague estimate of remaining time with a bogus reason. Thankfully that was the last we had to see of herOnce ready, we were led inside. The place is huge, and we could not have guessed how big it was looking at it from the outside. The decor is bright and traditional, but seemed a bit dated and old. Our server was super friendly and nice, and made sure we were well taken care of.For food, we got the salmon benedict which was quite tasty and the salmon was good, but the hollandaise was a bit bland the egg was overdone. Lemon ricotta pancakes were not very tasty and slightly dry. The regular pancakes were a lot better. We also got a couple of veggie omlettes and the waffle. All were okay as such, nothing was particularly memorable. The coffee here is good though.Overall a strictly okay experience. Probably won't return, given that there's many more brunch options around that are a lot better.",,,

The egg was poached perfectly, and the English Muffin was so fluffy and delicious. One of the best eggs benedicts I've had! We also had the French Toast which was tasty, but not the best I've had.

Started with mimosa and bloody Mary's.  The bloody Mary's were perfectly spiced and were accompanied with olives and lime. Food- eggs Benedict was spectacular with home made English muffins.  Omelette and frittata didn't look much different.  The frittata was missing the typical crustiness and parmesan  cheese.  The omelets were not filled and folded, but more like fluffy scrambled eggs with filling mixed throughout.  All was very tasty but not exactly what we expected.  All in all, I'd recommend Sarabeth's for brunch.",,,1
161,Eric G.,"New York, NY",236,103,63,4.0,11/20/2017,The food here at brunch is great. The pancakes and smoked salmon are both dishes that you should try. Just know you're paying more to sit by Central Park.  $5.00 for a coffee is expensive especially for drip coffee that is served at just above room temperature. Every time someone refilled my coffee I had to ask them to bring hot coffee from the back. Service is okay and it's a pretty restaurant but maybe try one of their other locations. They aren't has crowded and they are a little cheaper.,,,

Yes, my fault... I should have stopped her. 1) They mention 3 kinds of wine; glass/quarter/bottle on the menu. I ordered a quarter of MERLOT but they gave me a half bottle of Pinot Noir and charged more. They explained, ""This is not a quarter, but a half bottle (though they don't mention it on the menu) so you should pay more than a price saying on the menu. AND I was not your server (it means my server was off and it is not their responsibility.) 2) There are many staffs but everybody is delinquent and slow. I asked some bread but they forgot it because they were super busy chatting with each other. I also had to ask a check 3 times (""Can I get a check?"" ""Check please."" ""CHECK PLEEEEEASE!!"")

171,Lily M.,"Dallas, TX",620,871,1372,3.0,6/13/2016,"Of course I had to try Sarabeth's and I can't believe I hadn't tried it already being that I come to NY often.  My husband and I went for brunch this past Sunday at 1:30pm and we only had to wait 10 minutes before being seated, which wasn't bad at all being that this location doesn't take reservations.Unfortunately, we were seated in what must have been the worst possible table in the entire restaurant.  We were in the walkway, right next to the kitchen doorway, and there was a glass that separated us from the next table that was basically sitting right next to us, so we didn't have any type of privacy at our own table.  The table next to us were in our faces the entire time, which was annoying.Everything here is expensive and I am one to spend whatever on food because I love food so much.  But, my super small cappuccino was almost $6 and it was so very small.  One teacup sized black coffee is $4.50 with no free refills!  It's insane with how high they charge for coffee and cappuccinos that are mediocre.We decided to start off with a kid's portion of the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.  The pancakes had a delicious flavor, but I've definitely had better.  They weren't as fluffy as I would have liked them, but they were still really good.For my entrée, I built my own omelette, and once I got to the center of the omelette I realized it was full of cream cheese.  The reason why I didn't order the Smoked Salmon Scramble is because of the cream cheese and the waitress knew I didn't want cream cheese at all.  She did send the entrée back even though I told her not to worry about it because I had already picked a lot of it out trying to eat around it, but she insisted.  Regardless to the fact, the omelette needed salt and pepper, as it was very bland.Along with the omelette that I built, I chose the corn muffin as my bread and it was dry and pretty tasteless, even with the blueberries that were baked in it.I got to try some of the Short Rib Hash and it was good.  The portion size was pretty big, which I guess is supposed to make up for the high price on the entrée.  I also had a bite of the banana muffin and it left a lot to be desired.Overall, I am glad to say I finally tried Sarabeth's, but I have no intent on ever coming back.  The food isn't justified by its overpriced menu items.",9,,1

I'm not very keen on bananas in my drink so I asked the waiter if he could take the banana out. He told me the juice is pre-made so he would not be able to.. You would think if a juice costs $10.50 they'd be able to make a fresh juice for you but nope-- ended up getting it anyways but the juice was warm. Literally disgusting. The salmon eggs Benedict was mediocre as it tastes like any other times I would get it elsewhere. Not worth your money and way too crowded.Oh and the bathrooms are horrendous.

Not at all what I expected....The Restaurant Week menu was $42 and included an appetizer, entree, and dessert. For appetizer: I chose the smoked eggplant puree similar to hummus, and my friend chose the escarole salad. The puree was not good, but that's my own fault for not reading ""SMOKED"" right in the description. Otherwise, it was a generous portion. For Entrees: We each chose an option. I had the cod which was DELICIOUS! It was crispy, great seasoning, but a small portion. The sides that came with it were ehhh, but it was already chosen and weren't allowed to substitute. The chicken option was good, and came with tasty rice. The 3rd option was prime rib which looked great! I just wish we could have subbed out the sides for something different, would have made the entrees much better.For Dessert: We all chose the smores in a jar. Very good!The reason for 2 stars is price (even though we chose the restaurant week option, the guacamole was $20 and NOT worth it!), the inability to substitute sides, and the service. Our waiter had a bit of an attitude as soon as we sat down and wasn't very attentive or helpful in menu options.

I made a reservation for my mother-in-law and his two 80-year-old great-grandmothers for them to get to catch up and see my new baby. As soon as they seated us, the hostess came by to tell us that a newborn in a car seat counts as a table for five, and we would need to go to the front and get back on the list. After I refused to do that (I wasn't going to drag two senior citizens and the baby to go back and stand in the insanity up front) she was able to move us ... to another 4-top. (I appreciate her doing it, but still am a little confused at how that all went down.)It took 15 minutes to get anyone to stop by our table to take our order. We gave it promptly. And waited. And waited. 20 minutes later, turns out the health inspector came by as a surprise (during breakfast service!) and the food was going to be severely delayed. OK, could we have our coffee then? Waited. Turns out the coffee machine specifically is being inspected. Would we like espresso, cappuccino? Fine - cappuccinos for two of us. THEY CHARGED US FOR THEM. The other coffees never came throughout the entire meal, and anything else we did need we had to beg busboys for because the waiter never returned.Food came out reheated and wan.

189,Roger P.,"Elk Grove, CA",0,18,3,5.0,6/2/2018,"Wowzers so good here, get the waffles , pancakes , potato fries, near Central Park , get scenic view outside, wait isn't too long if you come early. Highly recommend",,,
190,Johnny S.,"Orlando, FL",68,1,0,1.0,5/19/2018,"I do not recommend this restaurant at all. We went to this place on Wednesday morning and didn't wait for too long. The food was fine but the service was really terrible. The waiter's attitude was impolite and unfriendly. Overall, the place is overpriced and overrated. The worse part is that our food has cost $80 and we paid by cash with $100, the waiter just took all and didn't return the change or say anything about this. I know the total price is about $96 (20% tip), but shouldn't he ask us about how much tip we would like to pay?  Could somebody tell me is this a normal situation in NY?",,,
191,Rachel S.,"Lake Worth, FL",0,23,5,2.0,6/1/2018,"Service was rushed, food was average. My friends plate was taken from her before she was finished without being asked. I was rushed into an order, so I got the tuna salad, which was average. We had the s'mores dessert, again ok but I've had better. Won't be back.",,,

193,Javan H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",358,2,0,1.0,7/19/2017,"I'm not usually a complainer, but this place was waaaaaay overhyped. The fruit bowl was $15 and completely flavorless. It really seems like this place is more focused on appearances than taste. We had an omelet, kid's French toast, bacon and a fruit bowl and none of it was really all that satisfying. Also, our waiter was high. But who can blame him. The vibe was dull and the meal was bland. Not at all worth the  $86 (yes, you read correctly) tab. Next time, I'll just go to a diner.",1,,1
194,Alexa S.,"Philadelphia, PA",223,22,13,4.0,5/11/2018,"So good! Best location. Get the muffin basket. The chicken pot pie was fantastic too, though it's fairly large. Easily shareable. Service was not the best, and it felt like the staff was constantly running around in a frantic. Other than that, I would go back.",,,
195,Xiyan M.,"South San Francisco, CA",130,2,6,3.0,3/30/2017,"You do not get what you pay for. I ordered their Farmer's Omelette for breakfast. It's boring. Though egg is made fluffy, all you get inside the Omelette is ham and potatoes. At least for me, breakfast means to have more varieties. Paid quite a lot for the meal. Around $40 for a cup of orange juice and the omelette.",,,
196,Danni H.,"Back Bay, Boston, MA",0,5,3,2.0,4/17/2018,"We visited this restaurant on a Friday morning, it was bigger than we expected, the noise level high and even though we sat opposite each other it was hard to hear. The food was ok, although I have had better a Denny's, the service was the biggest let down, our server was absent most of the time so we had to ask the busy boys for water, coffee and even the check! I. Prices that our server tended to stay on the opposite side of the restaurant to his tables laughing with the other servers. Overall a big let down from other reviews",,,
197,Daniella L.,"New York, NY",101,19,3,1.0,6/23/2017,"-Ridiculously overpriced egg and pancake diner for tourists!-No AC in half the restaurant in 90 degree summer weather-Extremely slow service, 20min to get menu, 15min and 2 requests to get ketchup-Dirty bathroom (only 1 in entire restaurant)I am a local. Never returningPlenty of local diners will do the basic breakfast cheaper, better and more on the menu. This place doesnt have feta and no turkey bacon (diner basics)",4,,
198,Melissa H.,"Dallas, TX",95,92,4,2.0,2/15/2018,"The waiter was having a bad day, ""fresh squeezed"" ok tasted like Tropicana, the peas in my omelette were frozen. Sooooo, a pretty poor experience.",,,
199,Kevin W.,"Manhattan, NY",1270,727,1020,4.0,12/30/2015,"Generally I enjoyed my experience here, although it wasn't perfect for a couple of reasons.To start, this place is very popular for brunch and I've heard lots of good things about it on that front.  We opted for dinner and had a chance to try out a lot of their dishes.  For starters I was impressed by their tuna tartare.  The flavor was solid and the tuna itself was fresh and satisfying.  The calimari was pretty straightforward and nothing memorable.  The crab guacamole appetizer was big and can easily feed several people.  The flavor itself was pleasant and it is a good item to order if your'e looking to share something.As for the entrees, I tried the seafood couscous which was fine.  The seafood was flavorful and all in all it was a relatively tasty entree.  I ordered the evening's special, which was a skirt steak paired with kale salad and potatoes.  The steak itself was average and lacked flavor.  I think the meat to sauce ratio was slightly off and that may have played a role in the lack of anything memorable about the dish.  In terms of dessert, we tried the ice cream sandwich sampler, which was good.  The only issue was that the item was deceptively heavy and if you're feeling full by the time you reach dessert, I would not recommend ordering this unless you are planning to share it with several other people.  As expected given the use of their gelato, the dessert is rich and pretty heavy.  Thankfully I ordered a scoop of lemon sorbet which helped offset some of that heaviness.Overall I think the dining experience was slightly above average.  I'm not sure if the food itself was worth the price tag but at least the service was good and the ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant (if you sat in the front near the entrance).  It's always nice to have a view of the park and do a little people watching while you wait for your food.  All in all this was a solid four start experience.  Good, but far from perfect and some may also feel the price to food equation is slightly off.",5,,1
