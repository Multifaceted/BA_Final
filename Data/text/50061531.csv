Seriously, how hard is it to make good wings these days?!There was a great DJ, a nice crowd (we met some not-strangers-anymore and had a great chat), and the lighting was perfect.  Another bonus is that it's only a couple of stops from the A train, which will make it slightly easier to leave Bed-Stuy every once in awhile.",1,,2

2,Chelsea W.,"Manhattan, NY",7,27,10,5.0,9/1/2018,Finally an amazing Harlem restaurant that is classy and quiet enough to bring a date!This is my new favorite spot in Harlem.It has a great ambiance. The food is affordable.The drinks are well crafted with premium liquor.And best of all the music is great and played at a volume that you can hear the person speaking across from you.My first night I came I played it safe and had The Burger and Truffle Fries. It was well over a quarter pound of well seasoned beef and I really enjoyed it. The bartender mixed a special drink for me that was spicy and gin based. I am grateful for the care he took in asking me what I wanted.The second night I came back to try the Octopus. I love Octopus and even though it is an appetizer it made for a great dinner as it is served with spinach Brussel sprouts.  I highly recommend Renaissance for an intimate date. I highly recommend them for a neighborhood solo dinner. I would recommend Renaissance for the grown and sexy.,,,

I decided to take a seat at the bar area, and sat down with an iced latte while I decided on what to order. The one item that stood out to me was the egg bruschetta. I ordered this plate, and enjoyed the ambient whilst drinking my iced coffee. The wait turned out to be very long, and this was due to the place being understaffed that day.I was hungry, but not starving, so I paid no mind to the wait. I did not have an urgent need to be anywhere that day.Once I did get my food, I found the wait was well-worth it. The bruschetta was amazing! It left me feeling very satisfied, but did not leave me comatose.The staff was friendly throughout my time here, and apologized for the long wait time. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, as I have heard of good thing about this place, and the food was of good quality.I will return here in the near future, and my classmates will be joining me next time. Thank for the great experience, I will be back soon.",19,14,23

Updated review",I went to this restaurant On a Saturday around 3 o'clock. The place was pretty clean. I went with a family member if we sat at the bar and the bar was having a happy hour. So we ordered a couple of their favorite martinis. The martinis were OK my cousins was a little too strong for her but that's all personal taste. We did try other drinks and my cousin tried a margarita as well and it was not good at all they did not have any sugar or salt. We ordered some food. There was a picture of the mac & cheese on yelp but when we ordered it it looked nothing like that and it wasn't good at all. I also ordered the wings that they had on their happy hour menu those were good and I also had the muscles which were great!  My cousin also got the salmon empanadas and she love those. I would've gave him at 3 1/2 star says the food was good but there's no option. Will try them again sometime just in case it was just a bad day.  I do want to say my server was gray which was actually the bartender since we sat at the bar very nice.,,,

13,Nicole O.,"New York, NY",151,127,102,1.0,4/6/2018,"Had a 3:30 reservation. Arrived on time. Table wasn't ready. Was told to have a seat at the bar. The bar was filled with 2 dirty table settings, that sat there even after my drink was served. Was told the next 2 top was ours. Not true, the server gave them away. In walks a walk-in of 2 people, who also takes a seat at the bar. Was then given a choice of a tiny 2 top that was pretty much on the highway of the floor, or a ""booth"" near the bathroom. Friend ok's the booth. 5 mins later, I notice another table frees up and we ask to have that table instead. ""No, sorry. I promised it to the gentlemen who walked in. "" ""But we have a reservation."" ""You said you wanted the other table, and this is all I have."" ""Well, it's not all that you have because that table's becoming available now."" ""Look, this is all that we have, it's up to you!"" - Server walks away, and never looks back.To the bartender, ""Hi, could we get the check? And what is the server's name?"" Reluctantly, ""His name is Jamie. Why are you going to write a bad review?"" ""Yes."" She then goes on to let us know how the restaurant doesn't have a manager, and how they're under-staffed, and honestly, the violins were so loud I could barely hear a word. But the BEST part was when we sat at the bar, finishing our sangria searching for a new reservation (because remember, we 'did' have a brunch reservation, after all and we were STARVING by this point), when a different server came over and said, ""why do you have to write a bad review? Why don't you just keep this between us? No one has to know."" Then she rubbed my hair. Not kidding.Dear Staff,Please be kind to the patrons of the establishment you work for. We walked in with the intention of paying whatever prices were on the menu, in exchange for a great meal and good service. Please do not look a frustrated diner in the face and expect them to care about your woes more than their own. You guys dropped the ball, and I wonder how all of this would've played out had the owner been there. Would Jamie had taken a walk-in before seating a reservation holder? Would the bartender had reached over a pile of dirty plates to serve a cocktail? Too bad I will never know, because I will never go back. That's a fact.",1,,

19,Lauren D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,9/21/2018,"This star rating is purely based on how they handled a gluten allergy. I called in advance to see if they could accommodate someone with a gluten allergy. They said YES. We arrived, and I told the waiter I had a gluten allergy; he said OKAY. I told him which item on the menu I was interested in ordering and asked if that item had any gluten ingredients. The waiter said NO and then offered to check with the chef. I appreciated the fact that he went to check with the chef. He came back and said there was NO gluten in that item.They brought out the food and I asked again to verify. Again I was assured no gluten. The food was delicious.I had the WORST gluten reaction. If you don't know what you're dealing with, please just be up front about it. Allergies are serious business.

21,Mel E.,"Bronx, NY",0,24,5,1.0,6/18/2018,"TLDR: horrible customer service, incompetent management, not worth hard earned money, catering to certain tables while ignoring others. I can't say much about the kitchen/food as we only received two small appetizers and they were average. However, front of house is absolutely ridiculous. We had to ask for water and menus when we sat and waited for a waiter to approach us. After calling over three different waiters to take our order, my impatience was slowly rising. I literally witnessed a waiter tell us to wait, go a different waitress and tell her to come over to us. I watched as she spoke to him and presumably (as she motioned to a different section) that she was busy. What's hilarious is I then watched her fold napkins instead of taking our order. When we were finally able to give our order, our waitress handed it to another waitress (folding napkins lady) who put it down on the counter and walked away. So I grabbed the woman we gave our order to so that she could actually put the order in instead of handing it off.At this point, I asked to speak with a manager and explained to him all of these things (we never received utensils, water, a ""hello""). A table next to us that was seated after us had their food and weren't almost done! And it wasn't like we were just sitting there waiting, we were vocal and they still didn't do anything to remedy the situation. Finally, after our food order was taking literally forever - we had been siting for TWO HOURS with only appetizers coming out. So I asked for the manager so I could cancel the food and pay for what we ate. He was too busy to come out. What? The folding napkins waitress came over and started spewing all these excuses about how busy she was and blamed her coworkers for being new or not paying attention to us. I just looked at her like she was crazy. I told her manager was unprofessional and that their entire establishment was losing out on money. It's sad that a small restaurant in Harlem is lacking customer service and leadership. They could be making lasting impressions on POC in the neighborhood but what was evident during our visit is that they were catering to maybe who they thought would tip higher or deserved better service. It's shocking and quick frankly, disappointing.",2,,

I got the rib eye which has my mouth watering as I type, my girls got the Branzino, Strip Steak, and Lamb Chops. We shared the Lobster Mac and Cheese which was amazinggggggg. Thank you to Valentine who was the best waiter ever! He had great energy and super pleasant. I would love to be served by him again.Melissa (events manager) was super professional and open to us decorating the table with place cards florals and other décor. She even arranged a bottle of Malbec in advance. The owner, Chef Cisse Elhadji, had the DJ (who was super lit and had gave us the best vibes all night) do a birthday shout out and gave us a complimentary dessert.

25,Powell M.,"New York, NY",13,200,139,5.0,11/26/2017,"I want to give this place 10 stars, but unfortunately because of the speed of the service, they only get 5. Don't get me wrong, I fully recommend this place and will be back for certain. BUT, until they get the kitchen up and running at a faster pace, be prepared for a very long dinner. The couple beside us left after their wonderful appetizers because they had a show to catch. This also was Thanksgiving weekend, so they could have very easily be short staffed, and for that, I fully understand. So back to what is important, the food: we had French onion soup, roast octopus, cod fritters, steak frites, roast lamb and the bouillabaisse. Everything was outstanding!!!!! Perfectly cooked, flavours perfectly balanced. And I am dying to know what is in the sauce that comes with the cod fritters! Please DM me the recipe!!! Or sell it to me by the pint...

The food is pretty good here and the happy hour is even better but the service is...awkward. Yes I said awkward. You walk in and hope someone greets you, once seated you hope someone brings you water or menus. For some reason the staff is always either frazzled or confused and can't pick up on social cues (I.e. if the table is finished eating and quiet then that probably means they want their check). Don't get me wrong, I love this place. it's cute, the food is great and it's pretty affordable but jesus can management please step up and find new waiters? please and thank you.

29,Kevin G.,"Elk Grove, CA",5,16,4,4.0,4/4/2018,"On a Monday night, a rather large area was absolutely jam-packed, with a diverse, festive, friendly crowd and jovial staff.  We heard that this is a favorite of the celeb crowd; an employee of the Empire State Building got my wife all excited over the possibility of running into Barak & Michelle.  Yeah....the point is, if you are thinking of showing up on any night without a reservation, think again.  We ordered the cornbread appetizer, shortribs, and a jerk chicken dish, with a mac& cheese side.  The ribs are spiced in a unique way... I think maybe it's a sherry glaze or something.  Whatever...it was .  Very good.  The jerk chicken was awesome as well.  The mac & cheese comes with collard greens mixed in.  We elected to take the mac and cheese straight...that was a mistake.  It was tasty, but very rich...a little went a long way.  The greens probably provided a necessary texture break.  Someone please, please try the fried yard bird super dish and tell me what I missed!  There was an off-the-chain DJ, followed by a live band.... again, on a Monday night.  If you're staying in Manhattan, it's an easy subway ride from anywhere.  This was a birthday celebration, so it's hard to see how it could have possibly gone better.  Thanks for the tip ...she knows who I'm talking to.",4,,

As all the other reviews have said the staff was friendly and very attentive.We started with cocktails which all looked nice and tasted good although I do think should have been a bit stronger and at $14 a drink can make dinner a bit pricey.For appetizers we had the lamb meatballs which were excellent and the seafood basket which I could have honestly done without. The calamari was rubbery and the rest of it I feel was below the standard the restaurant tries to achieve. However the African spice on the side was excellent.The main course was excellent. Lamb chops a standard on the menu was cooked to perfection and the branzini special had a crispy skin and the meat was moist and was loaded with veggies too.Overall we had a fun time and an excellent meal.

Decided to take a chance and give this place a try...Sunday evening hours and the place was rather empty, but decided to stay, especially seeing there was a  happy hour menu. My husband wanted a lemonade (regular nothing fancy, no liquor) our appetizers arrived before the lemonade did, which i had to ask for twice. We decided to order a few more appetizers for our meal: included wings (which were listed on the happy hour board) and lobster Mac and cheese which was quite disappointing   Fast forward our bill was $70, including $13 for the non alcoholic lemonade. I told the waiter that's absolutely ridiculous, the -alcoholic lemonade was $13, how can a lemonade be $13 as well. He then said ok he would take it only to  lower it to $7, i then inquired how much was a soda because a simple lemonade should be similar in price. He says $3. The wings we ordered apparently were not the right happy hour wings and we were charged $13 versus the happy hour price. I asked why that wasn't explained as i inquired about the happy hour board AND the wings on the board  i then ask to speak w a manager, he says there's no one there and the owner has just left and i could speak to the bar tender about the $13 non alcoholic lemonade. Very disappointed and a waste of money and a lovely Sunday evening in Harlem. The waiter had no knowledge about the menu or basic customer service. In addition, the waiter never came over after we received our food to check on us until we requested the check (again not busy at all maybe 4 tables total).

It wasn't very busy but it seemed like it was the waiter's first day.. as a waiter.  The owner/manager seemed very nice and the space is great with a wonderful bar and nice table set-up outside.I would try it again.",1,,
45,Myra L.,"Manhattan, NY",168,25,1,1.0,6/8/2018,"Bad food terrible service! Order at your own risk. Waited very long to be seated, no server came to take care of us. Meat was over cooked .My poor friend ordered a seafood salad and received a few shrimp with a side of lettuce. Will never be back here.",1,,
46,Sheri A.,"Manhattan, NY",15,17,0,3.0,6/5/2018,"Despite the food being pretty great, the wait staff needs to be better trained or replaced.  I brunched there on Sunday and was so disappointed with the waitress that I will not return.",1,,
47,R R.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,2.0,1/2/2018,"I came to Renaissance for the first time for New Year's Eve dinner. The staff at Renaissance was pleasant, the food was ok, but my overall experience was quite disappointing. We arrived thinking that they are offering the regular dinner menu, but it turned out that they are only doing a $75, three-course pre fixe dinner, which was not mentioned on their website when we looked earlier. For the first course, my boyfriend and I both ordered the lobster chowder soup, which turned out to be a mistake since we both didn't enjoy it. The soup tasted fishy, which I realize is ok for a seafood soup. But the smell and taste was overly fishy, which tells me that the catch isn't that fresh. There was also only one small piece of lobster meat in my soup, while my boyfriend's had none. Overall, the first course was a disaster, even without mentioning that the server almost spilled the soup on me.The second course was somewhat better. My boyfriend ordered the flank steak and I got the lamb chops. Both had good flavor, but both meats were overcooked. I realized that the waiter never asked me how I wanted the lamb cooked. I suppose it's my fault  for not remembering to tell him, but he also shouldn't have assumed that I wanted it very well done. The sautéed mushrooms, spinach and potato au gratin that came with it, turned out to be delicious. The sides definitely saved my second course!The dessert course had to have been the star of the meal. We ordered the chocolate mousse and the cheesecake. Although they sound very basic, both were actually amazing. The chocolate mousse was the right amount of richness, and the cheesecake was velvety and divine.At one point, the chef came out to ask us about our meal, and we were honest. He was apologetic, and quickly had sparkling wine sent to our table. It was a nice gesture, at least.Overall, $75 is too much to ask for when we could have gone to another French restaurant in the area, or even downtown, with better quality and value. The best I could give is 2 stars for my experience. But who knows, it could have been an isolated incident.",1,,
48,Mercy K.,"Manhattan, NY",26,2,0,5.0,7/4/2018,"Amazing service, food, drinks and ambience. Food is really fresh and good! Chef and service team are very caring, patient and accommodating. If you are looking for a dinner and brunch place this is it in Harlem!",,,

Loved the avocado toast with salmon, and the Florentine Benedict.The interior is lovely- leather, wood, chrome, classy. The music is also classy, ranging from jazz covers of oldies to some more exotic fair. A very relaxing way to start the weekend.Hit this place up!!",1,,

51,Marc C.,"Detroit, MI",2,8,0,4.0,12/30/2017,"Ok.... while visiting NYC, I was extremely excited to try this spot. Trekked from midtown up to Harlem.... this place reminds me of a book I once planned to write..... ""Best Intentions""We made reservations and arrived 15mins early. They sat us a table only to ask us to move 10 mins later????? Fortunately/unfortunately.... I know the difference between good, better and great....Service was attentive but was put off being asked to move as the table was still empty when we left the restaurant. My meal was ok but would have been great if the shrimp had not been cooked until they turned to mush. My girls entree was great..... she had stripped bass.Our drinks were good but as a purveyor of craft cocktail bars..... I've had better. However, the bar itself was well stocked.I will try it again as we all can have an nite.....AND even as a simple man, I can be somewhat particular.....4 stars",,,

I especially have enjoyed Brunch. The avocado toast, smoked salmon & eggs are delicious. Also, the French toast comes with a really delicious fruit salad. I look forward to trying the dinner menu. It's awesome that they open earlier & close later than most restaurants in the area. Right now it's BYOB, but it looks like the bar will be amazing once the liquor license is approved.

68,Ryan C.,"Manhattan, NY",814,12,6,1.0,6/24/2018,"I was severely disappointed by efficiency and management of service here. This was my second time coming to the Renaissance for brunch. The first time, service was slow, but I wanted to give them another chance because their staff were so nice. Yesterday, I took my father here for a Father's Day brunch. He had to catch a flight later that day to go home, but I gave us PLENTY of time to eat and head back home for packing. We were sat outside and it took 15 MINUTES for a server to come get our order, and that is after I flagged someone down. Then, we didn't receive our drinks for 40 minutes... after our server saw we had NOTHING at our table. I also asked for more water, which never ever got to me. 50 minutes go by and we still haven't received our food... I have to go to the server ONCE AGAIN and ask why we haven't gotten anything. He apologizes and goes to check on the order. There seems to be mass confusion with the staff... I have ask that we get our food TO GO as soon as possible because my dad is going to be late for his flight.  We get the food and the check (no effort on their behalf to give us a discount for the abysmal experience) and have to leave. My Father's Day Brunch with my dad was ruined and the staff just didn't seem to care. We got home only to find they did not give us everything we ordered and the food was soggy. I am not hard to please, but damn give a little effort! This place needs better management if I am ever going to return.",1,,

81,Jessica R.,"Ann Arbor, MI",0,3,0,1.0,7/5/2018,This is simply a bad restaurant. The food is extremely overpriced and bad quality. My beer had black dust or dirt on the glass and in the drink. We were charged for the wrong bill which was $100 more than it should have been. When we tried to get it changed the staff were unapologetic and it took about 20 minutes.

Followed by the strawberry crepe that I could slap my momma for. Everything was finger licking dynamite! I'll def come back... with a date.

Our party had the codfish fritters (which were served over a flavorful mix of red and white onions and sprouts), chicken and waffles, steak & egg hash, and truffle fries. Everyone cleaned their plates with no complaints! We also shared a great bottle of Rose. My only complaints would be the limited dessert options (ice cream and cheesecake), the hefty price of desserts ($10 for a li'l slice of cheesecake??), and the weak service. The venue was not crowded while we were there so the bartender was doing double duty as our waiter. Nice guy but he should stick to bartending. He left the venue before dessert and apparently without notifying his fellow waitstaff. After about 10 mins, we flagged down another waiter for service. Other than that, I really enjoyed my visit to Renaissance Harlem and I'm looking forward to going back soon! Dinner perhaps...",,,

90,Nerissa L.,"Lynbrook, NY",299,36,28,2.0,2/18/2018,"Sadly when I went for brunch three out of four patrons at my table were not happy with their selections. We all ordered either the waffle or chicken with waffle. First of all the chicken wasn't really seasoned and was bland and the portion size was laughable I had four tiny bits of chicken tenders which was honestly a joke for the the price. The waffle was just a plain non taste waffle and the small bowl of fruit that came with it was tasteless as the fruit was out of season.  I often eat at Ponty Bistro which has great flavorful food for brunch, lunch or dinner but this time around for brunch at Renaissance Harlem I was very disappointed. In addition the one bathroom they had had its entrance right in front of the door to the kitchen so if you happen to be lucky enough to have to wait in line to go to the bathroom you literally have no where to stand without getting in the way. I will give this place a second chance and hopefully next time I will have a better review.",2,,

I had lamb meatballs delishhhhhhhhh the tomato sauce took it to the next level and the fried basket another fave for appetizers. For the main i had the braised short ribs- it melted in your mouth so tender with mash and carrots sooooooo good. Sorry I have no pics because I ate to fast lol. The vibe was nice there was live music and when that was over whoever music shuffle playing was on point. I was singing at the table( i was raised better than that lol). I just could not help myself.

Not only were they able to accommodate the three of us, but I was also very happily surprised that Renaissance had everything I wanted: lovely and welcoming atmosphere, delicious food (we had the short ribs, chicken with plum sauce, lobster mac & cheese, and meatballs - all so tasty), and excellent service. Everyone from the owner/manager, who personally greeted me and wished me happy birthday, to our waiter and even the bartender, was exceedingly and genuinely attentive. The whole experience saved my birthday from what was shaping up to be a disaster. I plan to return.",,,
100,D E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,38,3,1.0,7/10/2018,"The female manager with the curly black and grey hair was so rude and disgusting. She spoke very disgusting to me. I was being a friendly customer who told her to smile and she responded by saying ""don't talk to me I'm busy"". I was in complete shock. I then said wow today is not your day and she went off on me like she hated her life. It's not my fault you work there! They need new management and possibly new owners. I told the owner about the situation. He proceeded to flirt with me and asked me for my number. He said he would have her apologize and of course she never did. I then spoke to some of the patrons and they had similar stories about her. Another manager or owner came in and I guess they told him about the situation. He then proceeded to go off on the bartender which was strange since the bartender had nothing to do with the situation. Long story short, no need to come to a place that does not care for their patrons and has mediocre food. FYI I have come in before for dinner (food was not good and overpriced) and the only reason I even came back was because the singer is dope! Other than that it's a waste of time. The owners seem to just want to make a buck so be mindful before coming here. There are much better restaurants in Harlem. Read the other comments about customer service. There is a pattern here.",,,

Our group selected the Ahi tuna, seafood bouillabaisse, short ribs, hamburger and chocolate mousse.  All delicious. They now have a full bar to complement your dinner.

107,Dean W.,"Monmouth Junction, South Brunswick Township, NJ",0,1,0,4.0,10/20/2017,"it was a quiet sunday evening when we sauntered for a meal.  The ambiance was perfect...low volume jazz music was playing and the lights were low.  My partner wasn't all that hungry so she ordered two appetizers rather than an entree.  She started with the garden salad,and didn't expect it to be as bountiful as it was. There were several different textures...greens, radishes and matchstick apple pieces combined for a delectable textural experience. Her fried seafood plate was her second plate.  It was a combination of shrimp, caIamari, flounder, and all fried to perfection. It was served with both mild and spicy dipping sauces.I had the lobster and shrimp salad as an entree. Again, a plentiful plate which included a quite satisfying quotient of lobster, including tail and claw.  I would have preferred that it had been not too well done, but I didn't specify that to Chef Cissea; still it was tasty and satisfying. Cissea also owns Ponty Bistro in Harlem, and is well on the way toward providing the neighborhood with an exciting new culinary destination at Renaissance.  My partner and I will be back..no doubt!",,,
