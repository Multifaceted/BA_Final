0,Cait E.,"Manhattan, NY",116,14,0.0,5.0,8/30/2018,"I. LOVE. THIS. BAR.First of all, the bartenders here are my favorite of any establishment in Manhattan, possibly anywhere in the world. When I moved to the area, I saw a lost friend who used to bartend crosstown. I call her Red :) But she was the first bartender that served me when I moved to New York 2 years ago, but she was on the West Side.When I signed the lease for my new apartment on the East Side, I randomly came across her bartending here and I lost my mind. It's fate!Over the last few months I've gotten to know some of the other bartenders and I love them all. The vibe they help maintain at this bar is my favorite. It's the perfect combination of no BS and good vibes.I also love that you can bring in your own food. I've seen people bring in tupperwares from home, and I've brought in everything from pizza, to sushi, to halal truck food. 1st ave can be a little quiet... but if you live in the area you have to try this place. It's truly a gem.",1,,1

Updated review","Small familiar place with Irish inspiration decoration. Just drinks, no food at all (but if you ask, they'll allow you to bring food in or have it delivered there).Prices are average, some cocktails are available.Check on their happy hour, as any other place.There are some activities (live music Sunday evenings), etc. that change from time to time.",,,
2,Jason M.,"Manhattan, NY",109,171,848,3.0,7/30/2018,"Lil watering hole, kinda cozy.Nice lighting.Loud, with live music.Challenging to have a conversation here. If that's ur goal.I would revisit... maybe.*Note: I'm into ""Bars"" in general, habitual drunkards may interpret this establishment differently.",,,1
3,Danan R.,"New York, NY",886,1843,43,5.0,10/9/2018,"Cozy neighborhood bar with spacious comfortable seating, great staff, and the perfect noise level.  There are several screens so it's perfect for catching a game with friends or a date.  No food other than kettle chips (bagged) but they will let you order delivery or bring in food.  Case in point: we brought in pints of B&J (don't ask).  Definitely a hidden gem and will be back for sure!",6,4,5
4,Jennifer R.,"New York, NY",418,354,3232,5.0,11/29/2017,"The short: amazingly cozy, clean local bar with great staff, great booze and great deals. The longer: most recently I came with two friends from out of town for Monday happy hour. I enjoyed a $5 glass of Malbec, headed to the gym (lol) and came back... they were hanging out at the bar, drinking yummy hot spiked cider and playing trivia. It was a fabulous way to spend a Monday after work. My friends and I love it here... it's easily our favorite local spot. Highly recommend it if you're looking for a cool vibe, good deal, warm environment and chill people.",4,3,2
5,Stephanie K.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,10/1/2018,"This bar is great. It has six TVs. They turn the sound on for anything you want. Sports. Sotu. You name it, you get it. Great happy hours and you can get food delivered. Or bring your own pizza or cheese plate. The possibilities are endless. The only suggestion I have is adding a french rose to the menu.",1,,
6,Kathleen O.,"New York, NY",157,71,26,5.0,4/24/2018,"This place is awesome. It's a very laid back but not divey spot. A stand out among the bars in the area. I got here around 6pm for happy hour on a Friday and it was packed but we still got excellent service. The bartenders are extremely attentive and quick to serve you. The beer selection is quite vast, and I was happy with the wine list. I don't recall there being a food menu but I could be wrong. I read that there's live music and trivia on certain nights so I'll definitely be back!",,,
7,Anders V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,10/25/2018,"Great local bar room! The tobacconist old fashioned: extremely good, but extremely strong! Like seriously strong. A real stiff drink. Try one! Cheers!",,,
8,Lauren V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,12,60,5.0,9/2/2018,"Friendly and skilled bartenders with a cozy but not divey vibe. It's clean and hasn't been too crowded when I've been there, although it's been after midnight each time.",,,
9,Jocelyn B.,"New York, NY",7,126,58,5.0,11/25/2017,"Sutton Bar Room has a great ambiance, especially sitting by the window. The drinks were also delicious!",,,
10,Brianna F.,"Boston, MA",2,51,71,4.0,11/6/2017,"Good place to stop in for a drink. Service was friendly and quick. Easy access to the bar and from the looks of it, they allow people to bring take out in to eat while they drink. High top tables (with 3-4 seats) and bar seating available.",,,
11,Mandy C.,"Winthrop, ME",32,76,100,5.0,6/18/2016,This is such a great spot on a hot summer night to unwind at. The live music is well selected and matches the bar's personality. Beverages are well made and priced on par with the area. It such an easy-going night spot without being trashy.,2,,
12,Franky V.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",32,1,0,5.0,5/19/2018,Great place for a drink. I Sat at the bar and I met so many ppl from the neighborhood service was great bartender very friendly and attentive great ambiance cute decor. Great addition to neighborhood fully recommended.,,,
13,Vivek D.,"Queens, NY",133,193,75,5.0,3/10/2017,I ended up grabbing a drink here one night waiting for my family to come in the area for dinner.  The bar is pretty interesting with friendly staff and board games.  Had a 40s/50s type of vibe.  Pretty cool place to come back to again.,1,,1
14,Jon P.,"San Francisco, CA",1,27,0,5.0,10/4/2017,"A popular place for those of us that live in Midtown East, this bar with its neighborhood charm, decent prices and Monday night trivia has become part of my weekly outings. It has great customer service and always has a nice crowd inside. I've seen it get a little packed late at night, especially toward the end of the week, but generally it's not too packed or crowded. I can usually get a seat either at the bar or by the window. I'd also like to add that it's a popular place for the after work crowd. See you there for trivia night!",1,,
15,Lorelei Y.,"New York, NY",274,325,141,5.0,4/20/2016,"This is a great addition to the high-50s area. It's a cozy neighborhood bar, and the cocktails are great. I had the Sloe Gin Fizz, and my friend went with The Old Boreen; both were quite good. For those who like girly, fairly sweet drinks, I highly recommend the Sloe Gin Fizz. For beer drinkers, there's a wide array of beers on tap, as well. They only have a single cider on tap, but that's offset by the fact that they offer Magners by the bottle; a relative rarity outside of proper Irish pubs.My one little gripe -- although I chose not to ding stars for it -- is that the bartender was pretty inattentive when I was in last night. She was texting on her phone pretty much the whole time, and I had to flag her down for service after she failed to notice that my drinking buddy and I had both finished our drinks.",2,,1
16,Kathleen S.,"New York, NY",26,409,63,3.0,6/20/2017,"Close to my apartment, cute interior, good music,greatdrinks and never have trouble getting a seat. But WHAT IS THAT SMELL?",,3,
17,Melissa G.,"San Lorenzo, CA",41,9,0,5.0,8/6/2017,Great laid back place to grab a drink. Gets crowded on weekends but ever feels overcrowded. Great bartenders who know their drinks! Definitely a gem for the ues/Sutton place,,,
18,Ana P.,"New York, NY",123,67,8,5.0,4/2/2017,"Amazing! I love the fact that this place is so close to my apt, very nice bar, nice crowd, great live music!!! Fair prices, they have happy hour too, the food menu is small more like snack menu. I really liked the set up and decor. I will for sure come back.",1,,
19,Tony S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,4/17/2017,A gem. Nick the owner is a gentleman of the highest order. His sister works there too and she's equally awesome. Great beers when a game is on but then becomes a super chill speakeasy style bar when it gets later. Great atmosphere. A must for anyone out and about bar hopping on the east side.,1,,
20,Erin K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/19/2017,"That bartender, the Irish one, can't get enough of him! Real winner and a half, would love to meet that one after hours! This bar is good for happy hours, late night, whenever, highly recommend",,,

23,Mary-Stokes R.,"New York, NY",176,27,4,3.0,11/28/2016,"I like this place. It's neighborhood-y, nice lighting(important!;-)) and cool vibe. Nice bartenders. Great place to watch a game...My only complaint is that it always smells like clorox!",,,
24,Jenny F.,"Johnston, RI",4,30,1,5.0,11/17/2016,"Used to be sin bin, but has had a face lift! Same great prices, same great Irish bartender. Perfect bar to enjoy an after work drink (not super crowded, not too loud to hear your friends speak). They've got an NFL package and half off drinks during games.",,,
25,Jj P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",92,3,0,5.0,2/27/2016,"Great new spot in Sutton place. Hard to find a place with a great atmosphere like this in the area. Serious beer selection at great prices. The bartender was a really nice guy which again can be quite rare! I think his name was Josh. The owner Nick was also there and he took the time to have a seat and a chat with us to make sure everything was ok, I assured him it was excellent. What service!!! Now, I'm not much of a cocktail guy but my girlfriend loved hers (she tried a few :-P) I stuck to my beer but I was spoiled for choice. I'll have to revisit this spot to try some more of the beers I didn't have the time to try! If you're in the area, definitely check it out! You won't be disappointed! It takes a great experience for me to feel obliged to yelp my thoughts so that should say enough about how great it was! J",,,
26,Ellen C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,12/17/2016,Love this bar. Found my perfect neighbourhood local. Great drinks. Friendly staff. Great live music on Saturdays and Sundays. Board games. And USB chargers under the bar. An easy place to go with friends or alone because it's so welcoming. Perfection!,,,
27,Matthew K.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",14,36,4,5.0,2/22/2017,"I found this bar while searching online for Monday night trivia. NYC Trivia League runs the show from 7-9pm. It's a great spot in Midtown East, especially its BYOF policy. The menu is just a few sandwiches, since they don't really have a kitchen except a toaster and soup cauldron. We ordered from the Indian place across the street, which was pretty good, and other people had some pizzas delivered and there was even a cake on the bar for anyone to have. Happy Hour goes until 7, and during trivia, bottles of wine are 1/2 price. We sat in the corner by the window, and I was amazed at how little outside sound was audible, and I was not cold either. My only suggestion would be to add some cushions to the wooden benches along the walls and windows. Overall good vibe and highly recommended.",1,,
28,Shafeeza B.,"Newark, NJ",3,2,2,4.0,7/17/2016,"This is a cozy little spot. Great deals for wine and beers. Great selection of music, and friendly environment !!!",,,
29,Ee B.,"New York, NY",2,6,2,5.0,10/11/2016,Great bar. Friendly people. Good selection of craft beers and rotating seasonal cocktail menu. Live music every Saturday and Sunday is awesome too.  I love ladies night on Tuesday too,,,
30,David G.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,78,0,5.0,10/15/2016,"Decided to visit last weekend at the recommendation of a good friend. When you first walk in,  has the quintessential feel of a beer garden back-dropped with a mild industrial and rustic ambiance. The outdoor space is really something else, with more than enough room to spread out if you're with a big party. The real reason to go is for the beer. Solid taplist and with a small bottle list, but high quality suds on. Even with a packed bar, the staff was lightning fast and a pleasure to talk to. I am definitely making  a regular stop for myself.",,,
31,Pj O.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,5/15/2016,"Braven on tap... Great place, very good beer selection. Our bartender Nick was attentive and very entertaining. Guinness was excellent. I will be back",,,
32,Dave G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,4.0,6/18/2016,Great addition to the neighborhood!Good beer selection and attentive service. Prices are reasonable.The atmosphere is relaxing and inviting. It's the kind of place you can go with friends to watch sports or a low key date with your significant other. Summary: I hope the Sutton Bar Room is a neighborhood staple for years to come.,,,
33,Jennifer P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,10/13/2016,"Definitely my favorite neighborhood bar! Great place to go after work for a cocktail or a beer. Friendly staff, inviting atmosphere, and a great happy hour (there's games too)!!",,,

35,Brendan S.,"Chatham, MA",0,3,0,5.0,10/12/2016,Great drinks. Better people. Down to earth spot where you can enjoy yourself no matter the occasion. NFL Sunday ticket and ample TVs to satisfy whatever sporting need you have. Cozy and welcoming.,,,
36,Donncha F.,"Manhattan, NY",47,1,0,5.0,2/22/2016,"This is a recently opened modern bar between 58th and 59th. Nice relaxed vibe with great staff, pretty happy this place has opened up nearby. Lovely selection on the menu and they have cocktails too, certainly a change!",1,,
37,Jackie P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,2/22/2016,The best. They've cleaned up the place and offer great cocktails and friendly service. A wonderful place to go for a night out or just a nightcap. Nick is THE BEST bartender and I just cannot recommend this place enough. Comfortable. Happy. Friendly. What more could you ask for in a bar? Two thumbs up!!!,,,
