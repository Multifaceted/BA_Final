Every station offers really high quality food and there are so many options I always can find something I want. Not to mention the decoration in this place is amazing! It looks like each station features their very own art and design and the entire space is covered in a two story mural dedicated to the cultural and history of one of New York's best neighborhoods, Greenwhich Village. You can see many famous artists and musicians who started their careers right where you are eating! What a blast.A shining star in the heart of Greenwhich Village!!",,,
1,Chunjai K.,"Brooklyn, NY",258,222,1730,4.0,11/4/2018,Self service place that has a delicious Pad Thai. I was so impressed that they made Pad Thai more delicious than many of Thai restaurants in Manhattan. The chef isn't Thai but I assume someone that do the sauce and ingredients must worked in Thai restaurant or stay in Thailand before.,,,

Updated review","I like this place but there is definitely a lot of room for improvement. The buffet station is good but not enough of a selection. I do love that they don't charge the food by weight. There are a few stations that aren't available yet. Perhaps once they all open up this place will have more people coming in because the few times I've been here, it's alwayUpdate 10/15/18: this place has made plenty of changes since this the previous review, hence the update. They now have a lot more options in the buffet section and added a few more stations. Although the buffet is now charging by weight, it's not too bad. I will definitely be coming back more often now.",,,
4,Janet S.,"Orlando, FL",9,15,0,2.0,10/13/2018,This place still reminded me of the previous owner. Although the placed has changed. Food still the same. BLAND.  I had a few items purchased with my gfs they said it was kinda salty. Maybe it's because it's the weekend. Cooks has no love for cooking. It wasn't busy when I came. Good luck with this place!,,,
5,Sunny A.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,10/17/2018,"This new eatery is sure to be hit.  It just opened and I have to say the staff is eager to please and cook the food any way to please you.  Very accommodating and optimistic.  I've tried the breakfast (omelet) and the lunch (Chicken quesadilla) and it was good.  I think the portion could be a little larger in quantity in what the chef's prepare. As far as flavor goes in orders placed, its up to the individual to tell the staff how bland or spicy you want it cooked/made.  They will prepare it standard unless directed to kick it up a notch.  Customer satisfaction seems to be key here which is quite pleasant.  I am hoping to see menu's made up with pricing available for calling in orders.  Happy to see how clean and immaculate it is.",,,
6,Jay F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,10/17/2018,"The Greenwich Social has quickly become my go to place, offering a wide variety of foods to choose from. All of the employees are friendly and helpful, while the atmosphere is unique (insta worthy murals). I highly recommend the fresh juice station and the salad bar. The Greenwich Social has a clean, dynamic vibe with healthy choices everyone will enjoy!",,,
