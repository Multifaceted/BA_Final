0,Adam W.,"Rockville, MD",194,3,0.0,5.0,8/18/2018,"Don't let the name fool you - while it does have the look and feel of a neighborhood dive bar, the drinks, food and staff are of the highest quality! I love the rotating beer selections on draft, a good mix of local craft brews and popular beers from throughout the US and Europe. Additionally, their whisky selections are top notch and extensive. That said, they never come across as pretentious, so if you just want a Coors Light and a shot of Jim Beam, they can do that too. Many of the staff have worked their for years and have a good rapport with the local customers, so visiting Dive Bar always feels welcoming. I especially enjoy chatting with Meg, whose bubbly energy is infectious no matter how many shifts she has worked that week. And she has an adorable habit of laughing at everything I say, even when I'm not intentionally trying to be funny.",,,
1,michael s.,"Seattle, WA",360,4,3,5.0,7/15/2018,Love this bar!!! The Sunday night crew is the best. I love Sunday funday with the best bartenders on the upper west. Dee and Lauren rock the bar and make a mean drink. And fucking hilarious! Our server was amazing. Thanks Norma!!!! Food is great! Drinks are awesome. What more can you ask for?!? Check this place out if you're in the hood!,,,1

4,Jack K.,"Denver, CO",149,166,13,5.0,10/13/2018,"A great dive bar for the upper west side. The day I visited there were no less than 50 NY firefighters in the bar after some kind of ceremony, and they still managed to get me a drink promptly. A great place to visit after walking the park.",,,
5,Matthew S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,11/13/2018,"So I have been here a bunch of times and the most recent time was marathon Sunday after I ran the marathon. I can not tell you how great everything was. The food was, and always is, fantastic. We had the Beth Beyer, which is an Eggplant Parm sandwich, a bunch of wings (sauce on the side!), a pretzel bread Caprese (my favorite dish of theirs). This is not your average ""bar food"". I have heard from a friend of mine who goes there often that the owner locally sources most of his food...bread from local bakers, fresh vegetables, etc. So Marathon Sunday...the thing that I love most about this place is the atmosphere and the warmth and how amazing the staff is. We walked in with our marathon medals on and the bartender, Althea, started clapping for us. The whole place erupted into applause and cheers and it wasn't just for us: Every time someone walked in who it looked like they had run the marathon, everyone in the place gave them a big applause. The Dive Bar is a place with great food, an incredible beer and liquor selection, a warm and loving feel, and a staff who will treat you like they have known you for years, even if it's your first time stopping in. Check it out.",,,
6,Nikki R.,"Jeffersonville, IN",81,70,423,3.0,6/2/2018,"This place was recommended by a local, so of course we went! We arrived around 1:00 am on a Friday night. The ambiance is more like a sports bar and grill, but still cool. The mozzarella sticks were great, the onion rings were not. The prices were reasonable, but our server may have had a long day, she was not the best. Would I return? Probably not. Would I recommend? Sure, for a late night on the Upper Westside.",1,,1

Like the kind that you WANT to eat rather than have to eat because you're there watching the game. *Dive Bar salad was great! * Boneless wings a yes. *Burger was devoured. 3) Beer list had 5 Belgian beers! Aka the beer list was deep! As someone famous once said, ""I'll be back.""",,,

The lobster mac and cheese is amazing here and would be something I would get again when I come here to watch another major sporting event. The other food items on the menu?

11,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1177,35,4.0,2/21/2018,"Dive Bar lives up to its name, but in the best possible way. It is unpretentious, comfortable, and has great food! I loved our server, Olivia, who took great care of us all night. Go early to get a good spot, especially on Trivia Night. This was one of the most efficient bar trivias I've ever experienced, and though we didn't win, we really enjoyed it.

13,Dillan S.,"Norfolk, VA",302,2,0,5.0,8/1/2018,"I give this bar 5 stars for many reasons. One the food is stellar. The drinks are always very strong, and who doesn't want a strong drink after the amount of money you spend on the city for a cocktail. There draft beer list is amazing and has a ton of options. The atmosphere of the bar is great and don't even get me started on the staff. The staff is unbelievably kind and generous and they are always keeping an eye out to make sure you aren't waiting too long. Jessie is the best if you are going to this bar for the first time and have her as a server you won't be disappointed! I recommend this bar to anyone that wants a chill place to get a drink and meet really kind people and just enjoy yourself! They are also very accommodating to large groups!",,,
14,Simon B.,"Washington, DC",124,513,325,3.0,8/29/2017,"It's exactly as advertised - a dive bar. Nothing more, nothing less. At 5pm, I came in to a sticky floor (how that is possible this early is a mistery), a rude woman chatting her sex problems on the phone the bar, and a disinterested bartender. I tried the poutine, which was fine. I'm not super picky about poutine, the French Canadian dish that is taking gastropub over, with the delicious combination of fries, cheddar cheese curds, and gravy. The gravy was thick enough to help make the cheese melt, and the portion of cheese was good. It would have been a legit poutine back home in Quebec, if it had the squeeky curds. I'd order it again. With that being said, I really don't see a reason to go back unless I'm in the area (i.e., within one block) and have a serious poutine craving.",2,3,
15,Angela L.,"New York, NY",289,221,186,5.0,4/18/2018,"Five stars for a great beer selection and big food portions. I ordered the pumpkin cider and the cat fish tacos and I was not disappointed. The pumpkin cider is from Warwick, New York and it was very delicious perfectly flavored. The cat fish tacos were very filling. It was two tacos but that was actually enough because it had so many peppers onions and fish within it, plus it comes with a side of beans, mango and cilantro. I didn't have any sliders but I saw a couple come out and of course if you order sliders, you arent looking for a big meal. However, the sliders look to me like they had a good amount of ingredients within them. I came here to watch a hockey game and I loved the environment. So many TVs playing all the sports going on and there was someone watching each game. I would definitely come back here. Bartenders are awesome people too.",,,
16,Gregg Vance E.,"New York, NY",8,3,2,5.0,3/28/2018,"Neighborhood bar never really meant much to me til I moved to the upper west side.  The Dive Bar (a funny take on the obvious and then the not so obvious nautical theme) is really down home, feels like you belong and within minutes everyone does indeed know your name kinda place.

We went there to watch Game 7 of the yanks game (diehard yankee fans).  We waiting a bit for a seat, then we sat down at the end of the bar and ordered and paid for seltzers.  The bartender asked us if we were drinking...I advised him no we were not drinking alcohol (because my wife may be pregnant) and he had told us ""I have paying customers and if you aren't drinking leave.""  Regardless of pregnancy or not, it's COMPLETELY WRONG to kick someone out for not drinking alcohol.  We will NEVER go back there again...what a heartless way to treat people.",4,6,
20,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",245,569,74,4.0,6/11/2017,"Dive Bar is honesty in advertising. The restroom is an all-senses horror show, and that's the only detail you need to hear.Lucky for you, inattention to basic sanitary soundness and internal decor means no extra cost on the bill. And they don't hold back on the resources that matter at a DIVE BAR: lots of televisions for professional sports and appropriate gastropub food for it, delivered efficiently even during high-stakes games where the place is pack.Crowd enthusiasm is infectious and where you want to be for big-time events.",,1,

Updated review","Wow. So I went away to a different state for a few months. Came here with a bunch of friends. Wasn't sure if people would remember me. It was crowded and didn't expect much, but found dive bar took exceptional care of my whole crew. We had a server named Deirdre, who is Irish (always a plus) who made great drinks and never broke a sweat, made me feel like I was right back home. I think she might be my new favorite bartender here and I definitely know dive bar is my permanent home bar.",,,
27,Cecilia J.,"Manhattan, NY",115,1,0,4.0,6/9/2018,"One of my favorite places on the UWS, mostly because they got me hooked on the Vegetarian Reuben (and I'm a carnivore!). Now they sell cupcakes for dessert, too! By the way, if you're lucky enough to get served by Sherwin, he'll make sure you have a good time and enjoy your food/dessert. NOTE TO SHERWIN'S BOSS: My husband and I believe that Sherwin totally deserves a cut of of the dessert proceeds. Do the right thing.",,,
28,Chris C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,1,5.0,8/2/2017,"Dive Bar is an affordable neighborhood bar in a great location. Drinks are cheap and it's usually crowded during prime times, but thanks to an attentive staff you'll never find yourself without a drink in your hand if you want one.Dive Bar is really good at being a no frills bar. Portion sizes and options are great and affordable, and they have some killer deals on their menu (See Randall's Sliders and the perpetual mussel specials). Drink selection is great with a specialty in scotch, and it's got a standard, yet hefty happy hour from 4-7 on weekdays.This bar has a great vibe with people from all ages making this their regular spot, and the staff is the best. Howie brings the energy and has me laughing out loud at least a couple of times during his shifts. I could and should go on and on- Cate, Olivia, Brittany, etc. They're all sweethearts.Trivia Tuesdays are... humbling to say the least, but if you're looking for a place to meet the locals, watch sports, or just generally burn a couple of hours without burning a hole in your wallet this is it.",,,

31,Cassandra Z.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,14,0,2.0,9/4/2017,"We went here for dinner tonight. It was decently busy; the poor waitresses seemed overwhelmed. We had to wait 10 minutes before they took our beer order, at which point we also put in an order for fried pickles. The pickles were amazing, but they took about 15 minutes to come out.For my entree I ordered the Pretzel Ruben special (a Ruben on pretzel bread.) I literally could taste nothing but pretzel, even when I took the sandwich apart. The Russian dressing was 100% flavorless. The pastrami was chewy, fatty, and bland. The sauerkraut tasted of nothing but salt. I wanted to tell the waitress this, but she didn't even ask how the food was. We sat there waiting for her or check on us and she never did; when she did come back it was just to clear our plates. The waitress was really nice so I don't want to blame her. The beers were great (they have a ton on tap, which is great) but the service was lacking and the food was extremely disappointing. We'd come back for beer but I won't eat here again.",1,,

34,J.C. T.,"McKinney, TX",177,127,86,3.0,4/29/2016,"Stopped by here while my lady was shopping one day, killed some time and had a few brews at the bar before moving to a table. This place is OK. It's not terrible, but nothing really made me think ""wow, I'd come back here."" The interior is fine, it's kind of a nice place purposely made to look like a dive. Not bad per se, but as a connoisseur of dives, I've seen much better (worse?). The bartender was just kind of there. She didn't really say much, or smile, just took my drink order and gave me a menu. The beer menu, however was good, with tons of choices. When my lady finished shopping, she met me at the bar and we moved to a table. I will say our table service experience was better and our server deserves 5 stars. She had the entire floor and was busy, but was hustling and was friendly and nice. She also checked in with us from time to time and even though things took a little longer due to how busy it was, we knew she was present. When the food came out, only one plate arrived, so we were stuck in that awkward phase where one person has their food and one doesn't. Overall I would say this place is an average bar in New York. I wouldn't say NOT to go here, but I also wouldn't say to expect above-average service (which for NYC, average service is below average), and with hundreds of places to choose from, I don't know why you would....",,1,2

I think it's Nick, Olivia, Sarah and Meg. Hard workers. They also have a great lunch deal if you work in the area and have a lunch break you should definitely go in and check it out.

37,Olivia W.,"Manhattan, NY",78,34,27,1.0,5/27/2018,"Most bizarre and awful service ever experienced. It started out great! My friend and I got a table on a busy Memorial day Sunday night and promptly recieved our beers and placed our food orders. The food came out and it was pretty great!  I had the Shaksuku(?) and my friend had the poutine. Delicious! This is the end of the good stuff. Our 1st waitress, a  beautiful and aloof Irish woman abandoned us after she delivered our food. She never came back again. The entire waitstaff (3 waitresses) went MIA when some ""famous"" guy (her words...apparently he was in Star Trek many moons ago) came in and they started taking photos and shots with him. Our 1st waitress was now behind the bar so we grabbed another waitress (#2) as she passed and ask her for our check. #2 walked by 15 minutes later and asked if we received our check yet, and we told her we hadn't but we'd VERY much like to pay it as soon as possible. We gave her our cards before we'd recieved our tab and asked her to simply split the bill evenly to speed up the process. When she returned, she had inexplicably overcharged us by $10 and blamed the mistake in waitress #1.  When we caught the error waitress #2 thanked us for finding it and went back to adjust our bill accordingly. While we were waiting for our new receipts #2 came back to bizarrely tell us that waitress #1 had left off the tax (because she ""thought we were cool."" Her words, not mine) I want to pay tax...I want to pay everything I owe. I simply want my bill to reflect what I order. Waitress#2  apologizes profusely for mistakes and delays and offers to buy my friend and I shots. I say, ""ok, great."" Hoping to put the past behind us. I say ""how about a vodka, lemon something, like a lemon drop?"" Waitress#2 comes back with 1 shot... There are two of us...1 vodka shot with a lemon wedge. Huh? But... what? After 35 minutes of trying to pay a bill, we finally signed our receipts, left the bar, and called cabs. As I was outside waiting for the cab, the waitress #2 runs outside and down to the corner of the street yelling after me, to tell me I forgotten to sign my check. I was almost positive I signed it, but followed her inside and back behind the bar anyways, where she and her cohort had spread out seven or eight receipts they were fiercely perusing. After standing around waiting to sign anything (literally I would have signed anything by that point to get out of there) waitress #2 has a sharp exchange with a new waitress (#3), finds my signed reciept still sitting on the table where I left it, apologizes again, and I leave. Too weird. Why Dive Bar, why?",1,1,1

Sarah, Olivia, Jessie, and Theresa are the usual bartenders on Sundays for the day games and they are AWESOME!!! They have always made me feel welcome and are just all around pleasant and engaging in conversation. Get the Mussels Special. $16 for a pot of steamed mussels (in hoegaarden with onions), a plate of fries, and a pint (bud light, Stella Artois, or Hoegaarden). That's a steal anywhere in the city.

She suggested I call back in an hour. We ended out conversation with me making a comment that as a chef, i would never turn away business. Benn going here on and off for years.

53,MandA R.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",197,1052,2826,3.0,4/9/2016,"Lobster mac n cheese!!!Came here after exploring Central Park and we were hungry. The lobster mac n cheese was perfect. So delicious! We also ordered the hummus plate and the wings. The hummus was flavorless and the wings were rubbery, but this place earns 3 stars anyway because of the happy hour specials, beer selection, overall atmosphere, and bartender attentiveness. The food was subpar, but hear me out.A server apparently didn't show up for his/her shift and the place was short staffed. This place was packed to the brim. We sat at the bar and watched the bartenders juggle tables and the bar, all while keeping a smile on their faces and making it work. I respected that. These bartenders and servers were hustling to make up for the missing server, yet we never had to wait too long for another beer. I was impressed by this and feel that it needs to be noted in this review. The happy hour special for beer was that $6 pints were $4, and $7 pints were $5. So if you want the HH special, be sure to order a $6-7 PINT. M ordered another beer served in another type glass so he didn't get the HH special. When HH ended, it was time for us to move on and bar hop down to Penn Station. We'd come back for HH in the future, but probably would hold off on eating.",2,2,3

55,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,3/23/2015,"I'm always surprised by how much I like this place! I've lived in Manhattan Valley and Morninside Heights areas since moving to New York, and the bar selection up - at least if you want to have even a moderately positive experience - is grim. So this place is truly a breath of fresh air. I've been here on a number of occasions and it's always a different experience. On weeknights it's not hard to find a seat, but most recently I went on a Friday night around 8:30/9 and it was absolutely packed. I can only speak to the whiskeys and beer here - but both have yet to disappoint. My one complaint about last Friday is that my rye came in a tiny, warm glass. Firstly: I don't want a warm glass. I tend to like my rye neat or with one or two ice cubes, but I'm actually glad I got it on the rocks on this particular occasion. Otherwise, it probably would have been warm. And for a place with a fairly extensive whiskey/scotch selection I'd hope to get something at least resembling a whiskey glass. This is just a minor complaint though. Also - they gave us straws with our rye. Who drinks straight liquor with a straw? I suppose that's just their thing, but still a tad weird. So other than the small/warm glass with a straw to boot, I'd still give the drinks a solid four stars. They have Templeton, so can't knock them too much. Ambiance is great. The name of this place might drive people away (or, alternatively, attract a ""divey"" crowd, whatever that means), but this place isn't what I'd call a true dive bar. It's a great neighborhood hangout type of place. Good for small groups and great music. There was actually a group of maybe 10 people having a party with a buffet when I went on Friday. I wouldn't have taken note of this if they weren't all in pirate attire (not a typo...). I love that this is an option in my neighborhood. I'd like to avoid Columbia bars at all costs if I want to stay local, so this is a much better alternative.",1,1,1

I love the songs in the jukebox, the bartenders are super friendly and it's an over all pretty laid back scene here. IT GETS CROWDED AFTER 6pm!

75,Nate C.,"Manhattan, NY",12,211,7,3.0,7/9/2016,"A bit of a misleading name. The term Dive Bar implies that the setting is going to look less than desirable, and that it may be a destination for those looking to drink cheap beer in the dark. This is in no way a dive bar, it's a sports bar. It's a decent bar with good lighting, tons of TVs, a solid beer list and general bar food.

I highly recommend trying something different if you see it on the long menu. It doesn't really live up to its ""dive bar"" standards in this way. Staff is friendly and fast. They also have half pints, which is good if you're only having a quick one. Affordable for the neighborhood.",1,,1

The menu contains a cool selection of ""divey"" food (Burgers, wings, etc) as well as a nice selection of salads, subs, and a few Middle Eastern dishes. I tried both the regular buffalo, and the bourbon wings. My favorite were the regular wings because they are breaded with flour, and extra crunchy! They also have a semi-sweet(?) taste to them. Hard to describe, but they are de-lish! Our server Caitlin was amazing! Very friendly and attentive. She even suggested a few cupcakes for us to try! The cheesecake, and the carrot cupcakes were to die for! Dive Bar doesn't sell popular favorites such as Blue Moon, or Angry Orchard, but they make up for that with varieties like Duvel, Red Stripe, and alcoholic ginger beer!I will definitely be returning to Dive sometime in the near future!",2,1,

83,Arturo C.,"El Paso, TX",37,66,20,2.0,1/12/2016,"I'm a lover of dive bars, especially when you have as good a list of draft beers as this bar had. BUT, what I absolutely despise is an attempt to incorporate food on your menu that you have no idea how to properly cook. Yes, you're probably thinking, well why were you eating at dive bars anyway?! But you'd be surprised at the amount of good food I've had at establishments like these.Anyhow, my complaints are: 1) After self-proclaiming on your menu that you ""love mussels,"" you do them no justice. All you did was steam them in water with chopped onions, thus rendering them flavorless. Can ya at least throw some salt or garlic in the water... something?! 2) If you really loved mussels, you would know how to clean them. I got through half of the pot and gave up. Every time I chewed on a mussel, It was like I put a spoonful of sand in my mouth. Disgusting. 3) Your veggie sandwich was missing half of the veggies it was supposed to have, and the paper-thin fried eggplant was barely noticeable. So basically what you gave me was a loaf of flavorless bread. Thanks.",1,3,1

I'm keeping the 5 star rating, but I'd be lying if I said it was not at least partly based on the memory of the Belgian Thai Wings which left the menu. If anyone has had them, you know what I'm talking about. As I sit here in the office thinking its probably too late for coffee and yet too early to drink, I still hold onto the lingering hope that one day, maybe, somehow I will see those wings again and everything in life will be better again... sigh...tear... crying Jordan face.",,,

The poutine, while smaller than anticipated, was definitely the highlight of our meal. I had wanted to try it for some time, and Dive Bar proved the perfect place to do so! The fries, delicious by themselves, were topped with a tasty vegetarian gravy- and smothered in cheese curd. Still hungry, my friends shared an Italian-style club sandwich, accompanied by more fries, and I had the five buffalo wings. The wings were just okay; both the sauce and the chicken tasted a little off.All in all though, Dive Bar is a solid neighborhood option!",,,

Service was very friendly, beer selection is great but the boneless buffalo tenders weren't that great (only food item we got).

They had been pre-cooked and then re-fried. The skin tasted kind of gross because of this. The cheese on the nachos was only half-melted, though to their credit, they did pile a lot of stuff on.

Great place to catch the game, catch up with friends or have french onion soup that isn't a white clothed restaurant. my only meh- the moscow mule wasn't that good. big ice cubes, no copper cup, extra large glass of watery booze. Stick to very well written beer list.",,,1
111,A B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,17,0,4.0,12/27/2016,I absolutely love the Poutine. It's a must! They offer a great deal on the mussels menu. And staff is usually really good even when it's insanely busy.  Great place to meet with a SMALL group of friends (no more than 6-8ppl comfortably fit in their booth) .  trivia night seemed fun. If they were to add baked clams to their seafood menu I'd give them 5 stars.,,,

Step right on in and grab a seat.",,,
115,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,2.0,8/3/2014,"This place is actually really cute, the decor kinda makes me think of what would happen if a chain restaurant like Applebee's or TGIFridays opened up a dive bar. No, it's not real dive but that's alright, it doesn't need to be. But the food and the drinks didn't do it for me. Me and my friend split and order of fries and the Kentucky bourbon wings. The fries were fine, we basically focused on eating those. But the menu description of their wings included terms like plump and juicy. The wings we got were scrawny and dry from the inside out, and the sauce tasted off. There was also a faint burnt smell but the sauce and wings didn't taste burnt, we didn't know what to make of it but we didn't finish them. Their mixed drinks are also weak, which was honestly why I ended up drinking elsewhere for the night. If I'm not going to get full or drunk it's hard for me to justify sticking around.Their bathroom is extremely small, and is really made for just one person, but instead they put a stall in there and don't have a lock on the first door. It causes people to wait inside the bathroom (and two people can wait outside that stall but it's really tight). I think the reason they do this is so that they don't have a line of people blocking the entrance to the kitchen, but it's still awkward to use.On the plus side our waitress with the dark hair was attentive and sweet, and the music was pretty good, I remember hearing Journey. And I dig the aquariums, but unless it's for beer I'm not sure I'll be back.",,,
116,Ben S.,"New York, NY",5,36,11,4.0,9/4/2016,Stopped in to watch some football on opening weekend. Neat spot with several TVs and good viewing angles from just about anywhere.

117,Danny F.,"Seattle, WA",85,107,4,3.0,3/14/2014,"Presumably your expectations aren't all that high from a place called ""Dive Bar,"" and given that, you should have a good time. Sportball on TV, extensive beer selection, reasonably priced, and decent pub fare. Now, their menu is much broader than pub fare, with stuff like jerk chicken, blackened salmon, and catfish bahn mi, but I'd avoid the more colorful menu items and stick to the pub fare, which is what they do best. If you're seeking an inventive culinary adventure, I wouldn't go here, but you're probably not because you decided to go to a place called ""Dive Bar,"" right? So just don't get tempted by the poutine or shakshouka and get the burger and fries you were planning on anyway, and you'll be fine.Service is usually casual and competent. Went here once and our waitress was roaringly drunk. She spilled much of our beers on the floor, but made up for it by comping a round and just being all-around hilarious. She also spilled a little beer on one of my friends, but I hate that friend so that was fine.Oh, and I get that their tacky decor is ""diving"" themed, so haha it's a ""dive bar,"" get it, get it? but yeah actually they pretty much are a dive bar in the normal sense of the term, at least for this area. Go for the drinks, food is also present, don't expect a particularly high level of cleanliness or maintenance. They only just recently got the D, E, B, A, and R in their neon sign fixed, meaning for most of the past year they were just IV. That actually did just as good a job of advertising that they're a dive bar as the sign does when it works.",,2,

Lost my voice a bit screaming back and forth at the table. Then again, I'm old, so perhaps it's just me and my crappy ears. As for the bartenders; they are hit and miss. For example, one guy who served us was quick, pleasant and personable. But there was also a female bartender there who was unbearably rude and dismissive. After getting her attention to order drinks, she makes eye contact, gives a shiteating grin, and walks away to do something else. Happened to a few people in our group.",3,2,3

They have a great selection of beer and interesting/healthy food.  The diner inspired booths are okkkk, but they take up alot of room in a pretty small space already.  Service is usually pretty good.  Nice fish tanks! What they lack? The DIVE in Dive Bar.  No specials? No happy hour? come on! Also, Tuesday Night Trivia is a JOKE. It's hardly trivia or fun. A lame host hands out an answer sheet and pops all 60 questions on a TV screen (Only on 1 TV screen btw for the entire bar!) in less than 30 mins! Each question runs for about 10 seconds. If you missed it, too bad. He doesn't announce anything or stops in between questions or rounds. Its like taking a test for 30 mins and then he flashes the winners on the same power point presentation.  I understand that having trivia at a place like Dive Bar is a little hard considering there are alot of people eating but come on, I've been to other trivia nights at other places. Some are great, some are ok, but this is by far the lamest and not to mention LAZIEST trivia ever.  The host plugs in his powerpoint for 30 mins, you take a 60 question test without stopping, you mark your own scores and he packs it all up and leaves.  No recognition for creative team names, or even mentions of the 2nd or 3rd place teams. In fact, he doesn't even have a mic to announce he's starting. If you're gonna host trivia night, commit to it.  Hire a real trivia guy and mute the music and TVs and make everyone get into it.",1,1,1
126,Carolyn P.,"Jersey City, NJ",71,24,5,4.0,1/4/2014,"Dive Bar is one of my favorite local haunts. The wine is good, the sports are on and the food is exceptional. Do not let the name of the bar fool you...granted the condition women's bathroom does live up to the standard of most dive bars, plus side being toilet paper...the food really is exceptional. I have serious dietary restrictions so I can't eat most bar food, but Dive has vegetarian, dairy free and gluten free options...in addition to a generally polite staff. I highly recommend the Randall's Sliders and the mussel special is stuff of legend. A casual night out on the UWS def calls for a pit stop at Dive Bar.

129,Monica T.,"New York, NY",226,1878,25,2.0,2/2/2013,My review is only for the chicken fingers I got & NOT for drinks or much of the general experience.  I came in on a weekday afternoon to use a birthday promotion while my husband was at work.  The bartender at first told me I'd have to eat the free appetizer there but then said I could take it to go; that was nice of her.I also noticed that they have regulars since I saw people speaking to her & her speaking to them so I liked that aspect of the place.Now maybe it's because I had to reheat these later but my food was uneven.  Some of the pieces were good but one tasted like pure grease.  I don't know if they would have tasted better fresh but I wasn't impressed & probably wouldn't return unless they have karaoke nights without food/drink minimums or a crazy packed house.,3,1,1

It is rotating so there's usually something fresh to try.Food is great here - my friends and family always request we take them here when they visit. Love the wide selection that accommodates their wide array of food needs/wants. They have the typical bar food if that's what you're looking to have, but they also have tons of other food. I've tried much of it and they're only a few dishes I won't order again. Good thing there are plenty of other things on the menu I just love.One of my favorite memories of this place is when they were blasting the 90's music on the juke box and everyone was singing along.

I highly recommend the mac and cheese, which was plentiful and flavorful. If I hadn't been so stuffed, I would've picked at my friends loaded nachos and massive sandwich (I think it was a cuban sandwich). My vegetarian friends were thrilled to see the pretty significant selection of non-meat options (she got the vegetarian reuben).Second, the beer selection is spot-on: there were a wide array of options, and reasonable NYC prices.

166,Pam B.,"Bronx, NY",5,83,103,4.0,10/18/2014,I've been looking for a new after work bar ever since my favorite bar closed in August and I think I found it in the dive bar. I saw this place going home one night after work but never went in. Last night was my first time going and I loved the place. I love the mix crowd the bouncer was really cool.The music choice was awesome you get a little bit of everything. The drinks was exactly how I like them strong. I forgot my waitress name but she was really cool too. I love the fact that the menu have such a wide range of choices that's nicely priced. The wings and the calamari was pretty decent. The only negative was that the table we was sitting at in the back was very wobbly and it felt like it was about to fall off.... Other then that I found my new home.,,,

Excellent bar food, excellent beer selection, pitchers, and great service!!Today I went for lunch for the first time - hit up the vegetarian reuben lunch special with fries. Mmm Mmm Good!! I also grabbed a Founders IPA. Wowzers. Great beer, sat outside in the sun. Can't complain :)",,,1
168,Irm M.,"Manhattan, NY",750,319,21,4.0,2/9/2012,"This is the Upper West Side's version of a dive bar I believe? Extensive beer and scotch list, exotic fish tank at the entrance, ample seating at the bar and tables, a working bathroom and LOBSTER mac and cheese on the menu! Anyway I came here with a few friends when I saw my Scout mob coupon for the place was about to expire. (I've mentioned this app before and if you don't have it yet get it now! It tells you 50% off deals all over the city, no need to pre-purchase just show the coupon when you're ready to pay). My friend got the famous lobster mac and cheese which we all tried of course. And let me tell you, it was as delicious as it sounds! They weren't skimpy on the lobster and the portion was pretty generous. I snatched the remains to take home! I got the salmon sandwich with guacamole and sweet potato fries. Now if you know anything about me at all you know those three things are some of my favorite things in all the world. I'm not quite sure they work when combined together though. The salmon was very spicy for my taste and the fries weren't as crispy as I like them. The sandwich was HUGE though and I had to forgo the bun just to manage eating half my plate. My friend insisted the fries were from Trader Joe's. My other friend got the wings which he said were good but different. The sauce does look much darker than normal wing sauce. I didn't sit at the bar so can't comment on the ""rude"" bartenders as everyone calls them. The waitress nice and patient with us even though we were kind of annoying being indecisive and having the half off coupon!",1,,
169,Martin L.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",13,7,0,4.0,10/11/2014,"Though I lived only a block away from this establishment I cannot believe I have only visited this place thrice! Maybe it is because I do not drink so much. I have been coming down to this bar to watch the playoffs, and for all you sports fans, it will not dissapoint. Tvs everywhere showing all the sports you want!They have a very huge draft beer menu which is a plus. You can definitely explore all the different kinds if beer. There is a special where you get mussels and beer for $12. I highly recommend it! Bar tenders are attentive unless the place gets really busy. Crowd is a mix of locals, working crowd and people coming from the park after playing some type of game. I will definitely be coming back",,,
170,Patrick K.,"New York, NY",120,31,2,4.0,1/18/2014,"For a place called ""dive bar"", I really wasn't expecting much.  As it turns out the dive bar thing is more in line with the scuba diving decor.  Really good burgers and an excellent beer selection. Hardly a dive.",1,1,
171,Liam B.,"Dundalk, MD",14,121,0,4.0,7/8/2015,"They should lose a star for false advertising--this is sure as hell not a dive bar; it's a nicer-than-average yuppie joint.

172,Yai V.,"Union City, NJ",375,29,133,4.0,2/26/2014,"Great neighborhood spot - chill wait staff and pretty great food for a ""dive bar"". As soon as we got there for brunch on Sunday, the waitress suggested a few items and her favorite - which actually isn't on the menu "" Juan's Breakfast"" consist of: Beans, avocado, eggs with peppers and onions, topped with cilantro. We loved it so much we took a picture with our food !",,,2

Mozzarella sticks: stole one from my sister but tasted pretty ... Ehh. If you're hungry, yes. Craving sweet sweet sticks? No.Beer:Great selections on tap and bottles. Can't go wrong w my fav Hoegaarden. Service: Pretty good! Last time I went with a whole group of my friends and our server Emilia was the sweetest and attentive even w a rowdy bunch sitting outside. Decor: looks like if bikini bottom had beer. Yup. Not cheesy though. It's across the street from me ill definitely keep returning.",,,
174,Margaret T.,"Brooklyn, NY",531,357,59,4.0,7/14/2011,"The bar is definitely divey.  With the dark lighting, cracked booths...all the fixings.  The beer selection is relatively elementary but their whiskeys and other spirits are undergraduate level. What's really graduate level is on the food menu -- not the normal one but a semi-secret one.  They have a special mussels menu and on there, the valedictorian is the steamed mussel special.  For $12, you get a side of fries, a beer (Stella or Hoegaarden), and an entire pot of mussels steamed in white wine sauce, butter, garlic, and onions.  Seriously, you get an ENTIRE POT.  I ate until I thought I was going to puke and was still able to share with 2 other people.",2,2,2
175,Cori C.,"Brooklyn, NY",111,405,18,4.0,3/24/2014,"This is a sports bar with a vague scuba theme. They've got a huge selection of beers and bar food.

176,Maryanne N.,"Keyport, NJ",38,168,0,5.0,6/18/2015,"I found Dive Bar more than 15 years ago when an old ex used to live down the street. Since then, it has always been one of my favorite spots on the UWS. Staff has always been friendly, and the food gets better and better. Plus they have a great beer selection with some rare finds that I love - way better than the standard crap you get at nearly every other bar in the area. And I'm gonna admit - I'm a sucker for the fish tank!  Over the years I've frequented Dive 75 and the Broadway Dive as well and have crazy love for both of those - but Dive Bar will always be my original and my favorite!",,,2

He was familiar with the menu, able to make suggestions, and had a great sense of humor.I was a little repulsed by another bartender once, don't know her name, who was blowing and wiping her nose behind the bar and would then continue working without washing or sanitizing her hands. Luckily, she wasn't helping me, so she didn't make any of my drinks. Also, the bathroom was clean and that earns a lot of points in my book!",1,1,
178,Maddie K.,"New York, NY",8,8,3,3.0,7/5/2014,"I'm conflicted about this place. There's an awesome beer selection, and the staff was awesome. But I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was really greasy-super let down. My husband had the jerk chicken sandwich which was so spicy he couldn't eat it (and the menu didn't list it as spicy). I'm thinking maybe we just made the wrong choice of what to get, so I would consider coming back and maybe trying a burger or something. So I'd say like 2 stars for the food and 4 for the bar.",,,
179,Matthew K.,"New York, NY",630,129,1,4.0,6/24/2013,"Convenient location for a post softball/baseball game fill up coming from the fields at North Meadow.  Pitchers start off at $12 though any civilized beer will run you $22.  Can't speak to busy hours but refills have come in a timely manner during afternoon outings.  The waitress has been perfectly fine with hooking up some ballplayers with some pitchers of water.Wings offer a fair amount of meat and while far from juicy, have been safely away from the dry side.  Accompanying carrots and celery tend to be sufficiently fresh.  Chips and guac are hardly on the pricey side by NY standards, and though the guac is average at best, a second batch of chips (served upon request) surprised in being freshly cooked.  TV's tend to cover the proper assortment of the day's sporting events.",2,1,2

183,Lea S.,"New York, NY",105,23,4,4.0,12/28/2013,"I stopped in for a few minutes on a Friday night with a small group of friends. We planned to stay for only a few minutes , but ended up staying for a couple of hours. Here's why: friendly waitress who put up with us as we became more and more intoxicated, good food, good drinks, adequate space for a party of 4, and a comfortable ambiance. We had a few rounds of silver patron, but I can't deny that this place has a huge assortment of beer! I also ate the vegetarian Reuben sandwich. Spinach, sauerkraut, red onion, swiss cheese + on toasted, crispy whole grain bread with a side salad. It was a creative option for vegetarians, and I was satisfied with the taste. The sauerkraut did make the bread a bit soggy, though.Next time I'm in the area and want to go somewhere to chat with friends as well as have a f ew drinks, I will definitely be back!!",,,
184,Emma S.,"Baltimore, MD",226,83,33,5.0,6/29/2016,"If you like Belgian beer, this is the place for you. We love wheats so we are sort of regulars because we live close. There is some outdoor seating, and they have growlers you can also have them fill cans for you from the draft. My husband is an Army Diver so we love the Mark-15 dive helmet decorations they have, and we've bought about six growlers as Christmas gifts for our dive friends.",,,
185,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,2.0,3/1/2011,"I'm not a dive bar type of girl. But a friend I haven't had a chance to catch up with in a while wanted to hang out somewhere in her neighborhood so we ended up here. The service is fine, no complaints there but not exactly outstanding either. The crowd is standard dive bar crowd. This isn't the type of place I'd come in to have a drink by myself. The food is ok. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was fine for bar food. Nothing to write home about. My friend had the Jerk Wings but it was covered in too much sauce and not really 'Jerk' style. They do have a good selection of beer on tap, except I'm not a huge beer drinker. But hey, they do have the Polish beer Zywiec on tap so I had that. Bottom-line: If I was looking for a good bar with it's beer selection as it's main draw then I'd go to Valhalla, but this is the kind of neighborhood hang-out that you could have fun in because of the company you're with and not because of the establishment.",1,2,1
186,JB S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,36,4,4.0,4/28/2014,"Dive Bar. Come to daddy.Great bar, plain and simple. They have a great beer selection (from your light beer and American staples to higher-end Belgium drafts) that seems to rotate pretty frequently. The food menu is diverse for a bar, and it's delicious grub. I'm trying to think of another comparable bar in this neighborhood that has better food... wait... hold on... nope. There is none.They have plenty of TVs for sports. In fact, they have a certifiably butt load of TVs. Also a decent Trivia Night.Drink this sheet up, brothers and sisters, it always goes down smooth. See you at the bar!",,,

191,Danielle I.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,5.0,9/4/2016,The food here is great and affordable. My ultimate favorite is the Lobster Mac n Cheese. It is to die for. The service was also amazing. I was skeptical of eating here at first but the tall dark skinned bartender/server with the short hair (I can't quite remember her name) made me feel very comfortable and right at home. She gave very good feedback on what was good and just made me feel welcomed overall. I will definitely be making this a regular pit stop!,,,
192,Amanda C.,"Manhattan, NY",66,42,1,2.0,10/4/2013,"Just a disclaimer: this review is based on food only. They seem to have quite a selection of reasonably priced draughts, but never mind that. I ordered the BBQ wings (or what I was told were such); not only was there not even a hint of BBQ flavor (more like marinara), but they were huge, overly breaded, overly fried, and soggy. I was super disappointed as it was football night and I really wanted some kickin wings.",,,

197,Sasha B.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,2/11/2014,"I wanted to love this local place so much BUT......... to my disappointment, I could never. The first time I went, our waiter was not knowledgeable about their menu. For working at such an small and intimate place I feel as though they should know it like the back of their hand.My first unpleasant experience was not going to stop me from trying it again. The second time I went however, was an actual disaster. Service was snail slow and when I tried to get the attention of a waiter other than the one I originally received, I got snapped at by a nasty woman. Clearly I knew that she weren't my waitress but I was not getting any damn help. When I finally found my waitress, I'm pretty certain that MY waitress was on a date herself because she was sitting down having a conversation with someone. When I went up to her and asked her for the check she laughed and rolled her eyes and apologized to her FRIEND. Please let me know if you have replaced your old waitstaff as would really love to come back again.",,,

The last time I went, my friend and I were treated to being taken care of by Louise. It was Saturday night and the place was busy, but Louise took amazing care of us. Her suggestions were spot on and she could not have been nicer. Not in a ""please tip me way,"" but genuine niceness. I waited tables for many years and let me tell you I was no Louise. Go for the great food, good booze selection and the comfortable atmosphere, but if you are lucky, Louise will wait on you and you will have an extra good time.",,,
