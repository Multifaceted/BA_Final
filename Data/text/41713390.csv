0,Joanna N.,"New York, NY",846,415,2009,5.0,12/29/2016,"After my job moved from Sunset Park to Gramercy, I expected to pay almost double in the neighborhood delis. I totally did until I discovered Marinas. I stop at Marinas at least twice a week for breakfast, lunch or both. Their prices are insane. The egg white omelette platter(home fries + toast) I normally get clocks in at $4.50! I normally get a fresh juice too that the owner makes for me -- $5.75 for a large. And they have beets! I used to go to a nearby juice bar and pay 8 and change for a smaller juice. Though the ingredients were organic, it was way expensive to keep up. Salad bar has over a dozen fix ins. Their cold cut prices are also the the lowest of anywhere in the area. Marinas is where it's at!The staff are all wonderful too. It's always the same 3 guys. Shame on me though, I should know their names by now.",8,4,7
1,Kenneth T.,"New York, NY",180,643,42,3.0,6/22/2018,"Placed an order online for 3 hotdogs and an order of fried calamari. 10 minutes after placing the order, they call me to tell me that they don't have any fried calamari and asked if I want a cheeseburger instead. I tell him no, I want something similar. He asked me what I want? I told him that I needed to call back because I need to see the menu. I call back within 2 minutes and ask to replace he fried calamari with the clams oreganata. The guy tells me they don't have that either. I ask for the mussels; he tells me they don't have that either and asks me if I want French fries or onion rings?I tell him no, what do you guys have??He tells me - we don't have any Italian food anymore, it was all removed from the menu over 2 months ago. So I said fine, just give me the cheeseburger then. After that, the food arrived fairly quickly. There was nothing special about it but it's cheap, just remember to not bother with the Italian stuff.",,,1
2,Carlos S.,"Houston, TX",66,44,29,4.0,5/21/2018,They accept NYCoin. That's awesome. Will definitley buy with NYC next time I go. Looking forward to the good deli.,,,
3,Qui R.,"New York, NY",262,6,1,1.0,5/12/2017,"First my co worker had an issue with the owner that sits at the counter. He ordered a sandwich as it was written as was charged extra than the posted price for one of the ingredients. He wasn't told until it was time to pay. Their reasoning was because the item is seasonal and costs them more this week. I've ordered on the phone and he has hung up in my face saying he's too busy to deal with my order.Then I ordered a burger with lettuce/tomato and bacon. I knew the bacon would be extra but he tried to charge me for the lettuce and tomato! I asked him where on the menu it says that & he couldn't find it. Instead of honoring it he bagged my food, put it to the side and told me to leave and not to come back I was in shock and so were other customers. I'll honor that and won't be back. I used to eat here 2 times a day because I work in the area. Customer service here is horrible",,,
4,Lisa N.,"Middletown, NY",0,14,13,5.0,10/25/2017,I love getting breakfast here. They are friendly and the service is great! Reasonable pricing.,,,
5,Michael M.,"New York, NY",204,454,936,3.0,2/7/2016,It's nothing special but it's a cheap deli and the sandwiches are good. It was a bit slow but whatever. I wasn't in a rush. Small bar at the front and minimal seating in the back if you want to stay in to eat. Good selection of cheap drinks and chips.,1,1,1
6,Katie H.,"Manhattan, NY",29,78,86,4.0,2/25/2016,"Solid deli. $5.50 for a roast beef sandwich and chips. Boar's Head meats. Cheap breakfasts. Cook to order omelette with choice of 3 items, toast and home fries, $4.50. My omelette was overlooked. Home fries were perfect. Friendly staff. Quick service for takeout.",1,,
7,James B.,"Manhattan, NY",233,8,0,5.0,1/3/2016,"As a long-time resident in the neighborhood, Marina Gourmet Deli is truly by FAR the best deli in Gramercy.  Moussa, the owner, is always friendly and seems to live there because he's always there.The prices are phenomenal ($5.50 Cheeseburger Deluxe w/ Fries & 20oz veggie smoothies for about $5).  Plus, Marina always carries food items that no other deli in the neighborhood carries, such as Zapp's potato chips (New Orleans favorite), occasionally UTZ Crab Chips (Maryland Favorite), Victoria Mexican Beer (rarely found in NYC).  Plus the food quality is great.  Some of the delivery guys don't know the neighborhood well so I would suggest those ordering in for delivery should give good instructions.  I personally prefer to go into the deli and chat up the staff.  Food quality is way better than neighboring Orion Diner.",,,1
8,Akarsh B.,"New York, NY",4,15,4,5.0,1/22/2017,Best deli in the area---its clean and brand new. The prices can't be beat!! 20 oz fresh squeezed smoothie (you can pick 4 fruits or vegetables) for $4.75!! Very consistent sandwiches with quality ingredients...thank you Marina Deli!!!,,,
9,Ms K.,"Manhattan, NY",42,116,147,3.0,8/16/2013,"I've been here a few times since this place opened a couple of months ago. I've only ordered deli sandwiches, and made the mistake once of buying a bagel with cream cheese. The sandwiches are good, nothing fancy, and the counter guy doesn't scrimp on fillings. However, the tomatoes are usually mealy. Also, this isn't the place to buy a good bagel. What they sell is akin to Thomas', if it isn't in fact an actual Thomas' bagel. It's very soft and hasn't any flavor of its own. Cream cheese choices are limited.That said, the guys working here are very nice, and for a deli, the place shows a lot of promise. There's a decent selection of snacks, nuts, and cold drinks, and they deliver.",3,,

Updated review","Used to love this place, but they have not been consistent in their dishes. I would always order their gyros; they were so good. But, the last time I ordered one, they just sent gyro meat with salad. I didn't complain. However, this time, when my boyfriend ordered it for me, he made sure to put in the comments that it should be a sandwich. Reasonable, right? They actually sent the sandwich this time, however, they put something INCREDIBLY spicy on it. It's been a half hour and my mouth is still burning; it physically hurts. It could've been a mistake, but, due to the fact we added the extra comment, my gut says this wasn't an innocent error. On the off chance it was, you shouldn't use the same utensils for something super spicy with something that is not. I'm miserable and in pain.",,,
11,Bob W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,0,5.0,5/9/2017,Best deli in Gramercy. Sandwiches always come with a free bag of chips. They also carry an extensive selection of drinks. The guy who is always at the counter is super friendly and hard working. Solid spot all around.,,,

Updated review","I stop by Marina Deli 2-3 times a week for my morning sandwich, a yogurt, a muffin, or whatever I can haul during my morning commute. One morning though, I left my wallet at home and was more than willing to go back to my apartment to fetch it, but Moses, the deli's owner, told me that it was on the house. Granted, I am a frequenter, but it was such an expected and friendly gesture! I love Marina's! Their prices are SO MUCH CHEAPER than any of the other diners' and delis' in the area.",,,
13,Natashia B.,"Brooklyn, NY",139,3,0,1.0,9/25/2015,"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I ordered breakfast for delivery and the wrong order showed up, (I understood, mistakes happen). I called and the rude owner talked over me, saying he they didn't have the bagel I ordered so they sent something else. He didn't offer a refund or the delivery of a different item and hung up on me! Next morning I call for a refund and owner says ""I'll return your money if you return the item we delivered, do you still have it? We need our item back, did you eat it?"" then he starts yelling. I told him he delivered something very unappetizing and I had thrown it away. He told me to never call back and hung up on me. Having been in server/hospitality roles, I know how unacceptable this is. It was a simple issue to fix, especially since I'm a patient person. I've never been treated like that (all over a bagel!!!). The point is I paid for something I never received AND was treated disgustingly. Never again.",3,1,
14,Jacquie T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,5/4/2016,"I order from these guys at least once a week and the food is always fresh, tasty and promptly delivered without attitude.  all sandwiches come with a free small bag of Utz chips which is a really nice touch!  they have great muffins too!  if you go in person, be prepared to see one of the cleanest, most organized delis in the city and helpful people who'll actually help you if you need it!",,,
15,Vikas D.,"Manhattan, NY",32,26,5,5.0,9/4/2015,"By far the best deli in the area. Moses is a class act, makes fantastic fresh juices / food and everything is very reasonably priced. Stop in and check out - highly recommended!",,,
16,Carlin Y.,"New York, NY",289,293,408,4.0,10/22/2013,"You know. The food here isn't great. Well, you probably knew that: granted, it's a random deli on 23rd St. BUT holy monkeys the prices!Everything here is pretty cheap. Not just the food, but everything else is priced pretty competitively if you're smart about it. If you're looking for really cheap eats and ice cream buckets and bottled drinks (although I wouldn't come here for the hot food per se), check this place out.You might not get Chinatown prices, but in the middle of Manhattan, this is a value shopper's kinda place for little things you'll find in delis.",,,
17,Shane W.,"Brooklyn, NY",26,115,3,3.0,5/15/2013,"I was excited to see a legitimate deli/corner-store opening up so close to my apartment. It's just what this area needs and I hope it sticks around. With that said, I hope they get a bit better.I've only been here once so far, but I hope my next experience is better. I got a chicken parm hero w/ chips & a drink for $8 and change. You're not going to find a better deal than that, but you're also not getting much, it seems. The chicken was reheated by re-frying, which left it burnt & oily. Sauce was okay but I think they use provolone instead of mozzarella. You also get no say in chips/side, they just hand you a bag of Utz potato chips, which are pretty much the cheapest and worst chips on the planet.Then I was personally a little annoyed that my order was apparently forgotten when I first made it. I had to wait for them to help 3 other customers who came after me before they asked me again what I wanted and finally prepared my food. I'm sure this carelessness wasn't intentional nor a continuing problem, but I would've liked to have been in and out in under 5 minutes, not 10-15. But otherwise, the guys at the counter seemed nice.Long story short: nice guys, cheap prices, good location, mediocre food.",,,
18,Debbie G.,"Staten Island, NY",111,13,18,1.0,12/23/2014,The only reason I tolerated ordering from this place is because there sandwiches were good and reasonably priced. The man who answers the phone is very rude and nasty and hangs up on people and does not take his customers seriously. I have tolerated it for the last time and will no longer be ordering from this place.,,,
