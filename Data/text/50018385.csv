0,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",138,79,73,5.0,10/4/2018,"NYC has no shortage of bars, but The Up & Up stood out to me as a quality place to get drinks in an intimate setting. They don't take reservations, but if you go in person and speak to the manager just outside the door, he is incredibly helpful, and will coordinate with you over text to get you table in a relatively quick fashion. I went on a Wednesday night and he helped get me a table for 2 at 8pm, so I was impressed.Once inside, the place opens up to dimly lit tables in close quarters, as well as a nice bar along the left side. Seating is a little cramped, but great for dates, and the noise level is fine (no shouting to hear across the table).The drinks were great, if not a touch too strong, but I like my drinks stiff and these tasted delicious. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for a quiet date spot in an otherwise busy part of town.",6,,1
1,Nadeena S.,"Queens, NY",9,31,2,2.0,10/23/2018,"2 stars for: -polite door guy who was super sweet and consistent in his interactions with both my friend and myself as we entered and left. Asked for recommendation for best pizza around (asked some guys at various establishments too) and his recommendation was the most legit-- when we showed up at the location there was a line out the door (believe it was joes pizza like 7 mins walk away-- not super sure about the name tho-- google map it if you're in the area) -cozy ambiance-- good for dates although they do have seating to accommodate lager groups too. *Would give an extra .5 for the drinks we ordered if I could-- they weren't horrible but they weren't anything special, at least not what I'd expect from a place with this rating. **Would be at least 3 stars if it wasn't for our female server who was polite in that fake polite but actually condescending way. Now-- skip this part if you don't normally care about customer service or how you know. Polite your servers are. Some people literally don't care. I'm not one of those people.  Maybe I haven't visited enough fancy cocktail bars in the city but I can do without the attitude. Example-- I asked what the most popular drink was because  if it's super popular at this establishment to me and I'm not in particularly picky mood that night (I wasn't) it's a good way to try something I might have other wise not tried but with at least with some sort of guarantee that it's decent (hence it's popularity). She was not a fan of that, gave me a fake polite smile and suggested I not worry about what other people are drinking with a look that pretty much screamed condescension. Yikes lady. Like I'm sorry if my asking for a rec opened up a doorway to judgement but at least have the subtlety to keep it to yourself. You're literally the main person customers have an interaction with while they are here and that interaction can literally make or break someone's experience-- and this is a business after all.  Wanting recommendations is why half of us are reading these goddamn reviews-- you get suggestions for what's the best dish on a menu or a drink to die for and you're like-- I gotta try this they make it sound so good! So it just prickled my pear, the uppity snobbishness dripping off of her-- even when my friend saw she had injured her leg and was walking around with some sort of foot cast and expressed her sympathies -- all she got was a ""you don't need to worry about my leg""-like reply, with yes you guessed it. Another fake plastered smile. Yayyy.  Alllll of that being said. If you're in the area and have nothing better to do I'd suggest giving it a go-- could be the drinks we ordered weren't that great or the lady that served us won't be working that night -- or even if she is, maybe she's having a better night. Who knows. Try everything at least once, right?",3,1,

It could be 20 minutes..it could be an hour, but I just left my number with Adam in case they opened up a spot sooner.We went to another bar just down the street and half way in, he sent me a text saying a table will be opening up soon and if we wanted to snag it.I asked if he could still hold a spot since we were still finishing up our drinks and it wasn't a problem at all. Let him know we were heading over and he was ready for us. We walked in right away.The place was cool! Small, dark, and I did like how it wasn't crowded in there. Spacious enough. I forgot the names of the drinks we got, but they were great! Chilled nicely and lots of flavor.",17,9,13

Updated review","I mentioned politeness in my earlier review of this place - however that politeness exists only in words and not in actions. You can be as fake sweet as you want but if you act like a dick you're not going to have too many customers.We were out in West Village one night and the skies opened up with some of the heaviest rains we've seen in the city for a while. We knew of this place and decided to hop on over for a drink while the rain stopped. We made our way down the stairs and were greeted by the door host who rudely told us we can't come ""rushing into his bar like this"". Fine, whatever, we asked if he had room for 6 in his bar, and he asked his coworker ""We don't have room for 6 right now, do we?"" and said coworker, after looking us up and down declared ""no, we don't"". Door guy said he'll give us towel to dry off (we said we didn't want one), and threw a dirty looking rag at one of our friends who was a little wet from the rain. Thanks but no thanks buddy, we don't know where that's been. We know what discrimination feels like and this really reeked of it. I felt something was off with the weird over-polite nature of theirs the last time I went here, and looks like it took a rainy evening for them to show their true colors. If you can't let people grab a drink at the bar or wait inside, then all your nice words mean nothing. I won't be back.",5,,
5,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,3.0,8/3/2018,"Came here for a quick drink after work on a Tuesday. Located downstairs, this spot is dimly lit with seating tucked away in corners as well as at the bar.We were seated towards the back and were eventually given menus for the cocktails/snacks. All cocktails are $16, so you can make your choice without debate. Decided on the Stay Gold ($16) and split the ""Selection of Artisinal Cheeses"" ($13). Drink comes out within 10 minutes - a tall glass of bourbon, ginger, lime, and an IPA. Good balance and surprisngly easy to drink; wish there was more of it. As for the food, the cheese plate comes in a small container, looking to be something that can be unpacked and ready to serve. Liked the Robiola cheese, paired well with a cracker and dried cherry. Would have preferred bread over the cracker, and possibly a jam as well.Service started off well then petered out towards the end (our server was also making drinks). Not a bad spot overall for something different on the block.",3,2,3
6,Kristy B.,"New York, NY",202,215,342,3.0,9/24/2018,"Well, they need to UP & UP their customer service game. It could be so that we were there on a Wednesday and they didn't have enough staff given that it was a weekday but the service was poor. Nobody attended us for quite a while. We actually were confused if it was supposed to be self service. And then when we finally had our turn the drinks took awhile. It's a cute space- they have a good list of drinks.only classy place in macdougal I would imagine.",3,2,2
7,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,249,950,3.0,9/12/2018,"The only reason I am giving it one less star than i normally would have given is because of the service. One, it was extremely slow, two, the lady serving us made no interest in either smiling or patiently answering anything. It was almost like she's doing a favor waiting our table. Very rude!Coming to the good the good part. Loved the decor and the ambiance. Has a very cozy vibe. You walk down underground and enter this world where you are instantly transported back to a quaint period away from the boisterous streets of west village. The place is a bit tight but has very cozy booths with floral green wall paper all over and a dim light over each table. Their cocktail menu is very elaborate, great variety of drinks especially for whisky lovers. Drinks are pretty strong and very well made. I loved my Door slam which had bourbon and absinthe. My friend got the ""teague Old flaskened"" which comes in an interesting flask.If not for the service, i would have come here more often. I overheard our next table discussing the same thing, that it took more than 15 min to order and get their drinks. They need better staff. Other than that they are doing a great job with their drinks.",3,,1

Just ask what you want and you shall have!If you have a group, expect to notify management. This is meant to be a speakeasy and the noise level should represent that. I recommend ordering off the menu and asking for what's popular for the season. Sit by the bar and you will be well accommodated. Cheers!",1,,1
9,Gina R.,"Jersey City, NJ",388,159,616,2.0,3/17/2018,"More like The Down & Down.  I fear my cocktail standards are incredibly high. If I'm going to have a few cocktails, they need to be really, really good in a perfect setting.  Serving mediocre cocktails in decidedly hip underground lounge means I won't be coming back.Cocktails - more like drinking juice (seriously).  Had the Bowie Intro, which had Suntory Whisky.  It tasted good, just felt like for a cocktail on Friday night it didn't really pack a punch.  There was already a ton of mounded crushed ice, which watered the already weak drink down more.  My friend had the One Star Yelp Review, which she liked but drank quickly as it was really weak.  And lots of ice.  Kind of sensing a theme here.  There's better places for $16 a pop cocktails for sure.  So, I'll probably skip coming back.Cheese & Sopressata/Proscuitto snacks - Again, totally under whelmed.  Or maybe I'm spoiled.  Either way, the cheeses were forgettable.  One soft one semi hard, both bland. Walnuts and dried cranberries - what is this 2007?  Both meats were okay, likely the best thing I had all night. Actually, there were 4 dried apricots.  Those were the best thing I had at The Up & Up.  I really wanted more of those.Ambiance - I liked the wall paper and lighting.  I didn't like however, the table we were seated at.  Every time the door swung open, a blast of icy air roared in.  Some kind of curtain or stopper is needed.Likelihood I will be back is low.  I don't like to give poor reviews, for the record.  I feel the price is unwarranted and I was completely under whelmed.  I like to taste my alcohol in a suitable environment, which this cocktail bar did not deliver on.",16,12,9

Overall, the place lends itself to good conversation over drinks.Drinks are expensive but excellent. On the menu, there are elaborate descriptions of what each drink includes. I like the French Conditioner or Bring June Flowers. There are some snack options here as well if you're feeling extra fancy (cheese, crackers, fruit, nuts), though they can be a tad bit expensive too.The service here is friendly, and usually knowledgeable about the drinks.

The place gets pretty packed at night time but before dinner it was nice and empty. I almost missed the entrance as it's right below a tattoo parlor. The bar is very intimate and perfect for a cozy date night. I ordered the animal vegetable mineral drink and it was truly amazing! Such a good mix of flavors and very light. My company is a big Martini fan and naturally ordered one. While they are very limited on their vodka selection the martini was fine.,,,

I passed by on a weekend and saw a line that went out the door on a rainy night! So I would definitely recommend coming during the week, and even still, there might be a wait.I tried three cocktails: the Colony Cobbler, Une Presidente, and the Screen Door Slam. All were good. I wish the Colony Cobbler had a little less ice, but otherwise it was delicious. Une Presidente was definitely my favorite and I love the concept of having cocktails from the small bottles! I loved that they had the name of the bartender who created each cocktail on the menu.The service was nice and helpful. The atmosphere is dark and intimate. I'd definitely go back if I was in the mood for cocktails and didn't mind a potential wait, especially for Une Presidente.",2,,
15,Felix L.,"Manhattan, NY",4,216,24,2.0,11/2/2018,"Had a business date and came into this bar. The guy at the door was friendly and welcoming (hence 2 stars). I ordered a Manhattan. I saw some wizardry at the bar and the cocktails were brought to our table. I tasted my Manhattan and boy, was it sweet. Definitely at lease double amount of vermouth. I called the waiter and said it's very sweet. The waiter goes ""Oh, you wanted a true Manhattan "". No, I wanted a Manhattan. A drink that's been around before me and definitely before the waiter. Yes there are variations and I am aware of what they are. But this place forgets that they are in hospitality business and patronizing their customers is not something you should do. So I finished my ""untrue"" super sweet Manhattan and was on my way. Never to visit this place of arrogance again. Management, ever considered training your staff?",1,,

Once you walk down the stairs, you are completed transported back into the 1950s/1960s. The decor is simply beautiful and makes you feel almost like you're enjoying a party in someone's chic underground bunker. The drinks are not only fun and imaginative, but you can tell that the staff pours their hearts into crafting them each and every night. Speaking of the staff, they are perfectly attentive. They hit the perfect balance of attending to us and giving us space to enjoy ourselves. My party also ordered a few snacks- cheese puffs and a cheese plate and each was tasty and the perfect little snack to go with our incredible drinks!

They have a seating capacity and there is no standing allowed at the bar-  I can imagine that on a Saturday night this is somewhat of a haven for a quiet date night in the area. The bar is in a basement and it feels like your grandma's old dated basement- the wallpaper is busy, the place is dark but yet the tables basically have spotlights on each one, so hopefully you've flawlessly applied your foundation, ladies. I hadn't,  so I wasn't pleased about it haha. Now... here comes the actual issue. For a specialty cocktail bar, the server was quite rude and unhelpful. I was unsure of what to order, and was choosing between the only two vodka based drinks. I asked her which she recommended and if she could tell me anything else since I was unsure of some of the lesser known ingredients. She snarkily replied "" well if you like fruit get the first drink and if you like cucumber get the second drink"". Yes I can read the words ""cucumber"" and ""grapefruit"" on my own... CLEARLY this was not what I was asking. This rubbed me the wrong way, as part of the ""charm"" of this kind of place is the knowledge of the servers/bartenders and their ability to assist the customers in finding a drink that is tailored to their liking...",3,2,1

To be precise, they actually only let a certain number of people in. You have to wait at the door at the top of the stairs and speak to the hostess before walking in. The cocktails here are crafted really well with a good balance of flavors between the different ingredients and the alcohol. I would say they charge a fair price for the high quality of drinks that are served. It's a good chill place to hang out if you're on a date or you just want to catch up with friends. It's not too loud in here so you can actually hear each other talking. I hate bars where you practically have to shout at each other to be heard. The service here is great too.

Maybe I'm ignoring reality, but the only point which blocks The Up & Up from receiving the coveted 5th star is the weight of thinking how you just spent $90, with tip, for a two-round happy hour, and you've been to cocktail bars as good or better, and maybe have a nicer environment (I'm thinking of Limantour in Mexico City, skipping an irrelevant price comparison), or the Flatiron Lounge here in NYC. I think we'll go back because the craft is better or as good as the top places we've been, and the snacks list, supplied by Murray's Cheese on Bleecker Street, is a good value.

Patrons must put their name down for a table before going inside. There is no standing room, and parties are seated at the various standing tables, booths, and the bar. The menu features many creative cocktails with intriguing names, each costing $16 a pop. The menu can be a bit overwhelming, with no clear direction where to look for your favorite kind of cocktail. It would be helpful if they were categorized by type of liquor. We both had the Zuzu's Petals drink - one of us with mezcal, the other tequila blanco.ZUZU'S PETALS // Tromba Tequila Blanco or Bruxo Mezcal, Ginger, Habanero Pepper, Rose Water, Lime Juice, and DemeraraThe drink didn't tickle either of our fancies. The boyfriend and I both frequently order drinks with hot peppers, and this flavor component was seriously lacking. He also thought his drink was watered down and there was too much crushed ice. For $16 a pop, I expect a world-class cocktail.It was a fun place to check out, but with so many places in the city, I don't think it's a place we'll return to.

Atmosphere was like a dimly lit version of a British grandmother's formal living room-- cozy, clean, and intimate with floral wallpaper and tables separate from your fellow diners, which I LOVE!Food & WaitDon't bother with the food, Artichoke and elsewhere on the street is better, but these cocktails are unbeatable (cheese puffs =cheeseitz, except $6 instead of $0.65, don't waste your money). We only had to wait 30 seconds to be seated around 9 PM on Monday, but you typically have to leave your name with the sharply dressed man with the clipboard (not your typical bouncer for sure) and return in 60-90 minutes for a seat at one of Up & Ups ~12 tables.Staff and AccessibilityCompletely inaccessible from start to finish. Steep flight of steps down into the bar, low lit (not as bad as Rabbit across the street, but same level of light as Diagon Alley pub in HP Prisoner of Azkaban). Noise level is relatively low.

The door guy is supremely friendly and will text you when your table is ready.

Music is laid back and familiar-- think Talking Heads and the Strokes.The $15 cocktail menu is about twenty deep and spirit-forward, with a designation for the way it's served (up, on the rocks, or on the rocks). Most are of their own invention, with names like ""Animal Vegetable Mineral"" and ""Relationship Goals,"" though they do serve some improved classics. There's also a few food options.I started with the Felix Leiter and then had a Flying Scotsman. First was very good and boozy with smoke from the mezcal, second was not quite my thing (was hoping scotch and sparkling wine would play a little better together). My friend's first drink was the Slack Tide High, with grapefruit, gin, and whiskey, and it was incredible. His second, the Amongst the Grottoes, with gin, Pimm's, and jalapeno, was also perfectly mixed.These guys are the kings of mixing liquors together that you're a little bit wary of going together, but you shouldn't sleep on the options that sound like traditional or straightforward drinks. I didn't pick my friend's drinks because they sounded too basic or like drinks I had tried before, but they were unique and delicious.Oh, and even the ones that don't taste overly strong pack a strong punch-- after two drinks, most typical drinkers will be a little dizzy.",2,1,
35,Cri C.,"New York, NY",271,221,1526,4.0,8/29/2017,"I'm trying to soldier my way through all the reputable craft cocktail and speakeasy bars in NYC. As you can imagine it is quite a task. Thus I was pleased to have the opportunity to try the Up & Up on Friday night when a visitor was in town. They don't take reservations so I was expecting a bit of a wait. We were greeted by a friendly gentleman at the door who took my number and gave an approximate time. We then went to check out Washington Square park and I received a text much sooner than anticipated. After we headed back and showed our IDs another gentleman came up the stairs to greet us an take us in. Note: I also wanted to mention that when we returned the bouncer/host was being subjected to some pretty poor treatment by some potential patrons - they had taken a disliking to the very fair queuing system. He handled himself very gracefully.Once inside we were offered our choice of a booth or bar seating, we chose the bar. I was pleased to note that the bar wasn't absolutely packed from wall to wall, it was comfortably full with a lot of space to walk. This really enhanced the ambiance because for a basement bar it felt cozy yet classy, with minimal noise - it was very easy to hold a conversation. Upon sitting down we were promptly given water and menus, and offered assistance. I noticed that the bar staff were wearing cute britches and prohibition style get up.Given it was such a hot day my friend and I were in the mood for gin-based drinks. After chatting to the bartender we chose the Animal Vegetable Mineral and the Slack Tide High. The Animal Vegetable Mineral was as described, very light and refreshing. The Slack Tide High had a really interesting transition of flavors that I haven't really come across before. Neither drink really blew me away but I did enjoy them. I would like to come back on another occasion and try one of the more boozy, whiskey based drinks. They have some very interesting liquor and flavor combinations on the menu. The menu is substantial and all of the cocktails are $15.The most memorable part of my experience at Up & Up was the seamless customer service. Trendy speakeasy and craft cocktail places can often be so popular that you are crammed in like cattle and have to shout an order at the bartender, who is then too busy to spend much time with you. The Up & Up has really mastered their customer experience with their waiting and capacity policies. I felt very appreciated and thus I'd like to continue to support the business and visit again. When you are there you find it hard to imagine that the chaos of MacDougal Street is right outside.",1,,1
36,Jordan B.,"New York, NY",312,154,455,5.0,7/8/2017,"A hidden away cocktail spot in the hustle and bustle of the west village, I met an old coworker at The Up and Up for drinks after work to catch up. Intimate ambiance, amazing service, and delicious cocktails - you can't go wrong. It's in the basement of an unassuming building, and the front of house are two gentleman standing outside who try to control the flow of how many people are in and out because the space isn't huge. We arrived around 6pm on a Thursday and were seated immediately, with prompt service to pour us water. There weren't a whole lot of people but by the time we left (around 8:30pm,) it was comfortably full. I usually try to be adventurous with cocktail bars but I got the Animal Vegetable Garden and couldn't stop - I ended up ordering 3 rounds because it was so good. Gin, lemon, cucumber, its the go-to if you want a refreshing drink without a pungent alcohol taste. Most cocktails are around $15 but they're worth it. Their menu is pretty large and they signify which cocktail was created by which bartender, which I thought was a cool touch.Our server was a young gentleman, maybe in college or just out of, who was SO good at finding the balance between of being attentive but not too intrusive. He really kept an eye on us and was very polite but not too pushy about getting another round. A+ service. Definitely check this place out if you're looking for an after work spot to get drinks with friends or coworkers. The Up and Up won't disappoint.",4,1,2

But they came, talked to the guy, and wasn't let in!Our friend's phone was dead so he had to go home to charge his phone and come back. Meanwhile, we had no idea this was happening! So we were waiting for him... And when we finally got into contact with him, the waitress asked us to order another drink or leave... We were only taking so long because they wouldn't let our friend in when they explicitly said they would!! And when our friend came back, we went out to go get him and were given yet another deterrent: we had to go ask the waitress that told us to leave if it was okay that our friend came in!Just unbelievably bad service at $16 a drink. We ended up ordering more drinks because we went through all of this struggle just to hang out, catch up, and have a fucking drink. We ended up spending $75 here but we won't be coming back.",2,1,1
38,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,4.0,3/15/2018,"I like the place and the drinks are great, but the doorman gives very weird vibes. In short-great place, good service, please change/adjust the doorman's personality. I would have left because of his mannerism if I wasn't with company.  I'm assuming the venue is trying to maintain a certain vibe by very actively controlling seating arrangements, as opposed to people easily walking in and out/migrating from the bar to an open table. When I arrived, I got very off-putting vibes from the bouncer because of all the questions he asked. When I said I don't need a table, I'm interested in grabbing a quick drink, he replied, ""well. Yes. Everyone is here for a drink"". the way he said it came off somewhat backhanded. He asked the person after us to wait in the cold despite her insisting she was joining her friends and knew where they were sitting. I could tell she wasn't happy either because she gave me an irritated look as the doorman walked away. The actual ambiance is great and it's not difficult to talk. The lighting is very dark and the drinks are interesting! I had the bartender make me a surprise drink and it was like nothing I've ever had!",,,

The aperol really shines in this cocktail which makes it quite refreshing. Overall, a solid cocktail spot.",1,,1
40,Jennifer C.,"Flushing, NY",70,88,354,5.0,8/18/2017,"A night that started with bottles of sake accompanying dinner, led to cans of Japanese beer in a park, ended at this lovely basement speakeasy-style bar. We were initially told there would be a wait, but after a quick check downstairs, we were led down to wait at a standing table, and to place our initial orders. Before our first drinks arrived, we were quickly guided to a corner booth. This system ensures that within the bar itself, the space is never overwhelmed with waiting patrons hovering impatiently.  Animal Vegetable Mineral - Plymouth Gin, Krogstad Aquavit, Cucumber, Lemon Raspberry Cordial and Lemon Juice - refreshing and light, with a hint of licorice dancing off your tongue at the end.The Quilted Room - Jim Beam Black Extra-Aged Bourbon, Rooibos and Rose Hip Tea Blend, Lime Cordial, Lemon Juice, Honey, and Angostura Bitters - this is WONDERFUL.  I'm not a bourbon girl, at least I thought I wasn't, but this was pure delight.  The tea and honey took the kick out of the bourbon flavor, and made for a deceivingly mellow cocktail; but don't let the smoothness fool you, this drink will put you down if you have too many.They also have a Gin & Tonic made from excellent ingredients, but I didn't bother with this since these are the very same brands currently sitting in my fridge (minus the lime cordial and the bitters - I'm not that fancy)The only disappointment was that they were out of the cheese puffs.  Another great date or small group location.  Great decor, friendly service, and wonderful drinks. If you're in a rush, stay away from this place, great cocktails are always made with care and take time.I'm down to head to The Up & Up anytime!",,1,1
41,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1506,175,3.0,11/16/2017,"Why is a place called Up & Up down one flight?Bar on the left, low tables on the opposite wall.  Lighting is a bit dim, drop lights over the tables.I don,t recall the background music but the place seemed quiet at 5:30 on a Thursday.I sat at the bar, bartender was nice enough, professional.  I was on my way to a spirits tasting for Botanist Gin so I tried their Grotto cocktail - which featured Botanist. I thought the drink was a waste of good gin, the other flavors overpowered the gin. Nice ice tho.First time I have seen a cocktail using parsley as a garnish.  A rather large piece of parsley and No Straw. So I discarded the garnish.The bartender asked me if I wanted something else, but I needed to get going.  It must be that most of their cocktails are fine; I picked the wrong one.",3,1,2

I loved this place. We had to put our names on a list and went to check out another bar. 40mins later I got a text they have a spot for us. I figured a table. Nope. By the bar. In the most uncomfortable stools ever. We ordered and were blow away. Impressed was an understatement. I explained what I listed and he listens and worked his magic. He made me 4 different drinks that was amazing. Thank you. Can't wait to come back when I'm in town!!",2,1,2
44,Collette S.,"Boston, MA",208,241,160,5.0,4/23/2017,"Friends! This is one of the BEST cocktail bars in Manhattan for sure. Yes, there is a booming scene right now in NYC of stylish, dimly lit cocktail lounges where mixologists hand craft unique $15 concoctions.  But what differentiates this establishment from its cousins is the outstanding service.  Up & Up nailed the unpretentious cocktail lounge scene.  From the super nice host who greeted us at the door, to the other host who escorted us inside and the super friendly and knowledgable bartenders, this is an A+ experience. First, the decor.  The entire lounge is outfitted with a fantastic William Morris wallpaper design - it was so gorgeous so of course I had to ask about it, and naturally take a picture.  A good descriptor of the ambiance is cozy yet trendy - the owner clearly has a good eye for design. Second, but perhaps most important, the drinks.  Everything was fabulous.  I am a HUGE fan of semi-sweet bourbon cocktails.  Thus, I began with the Screen Door Slam (Bourbon, Aperol, Honey, Vanilla Bean and Absinthe) and ended with The Quilt Room (Bourbon, Rooibos and Rose Hip Tea Blend, Lime Cordial, Lemon Juice, Honey and Bitters).  Both were fantastic, but The Quilt Room stole the show, and is my recommendation. Next time you're on MacDougal, be sure to bypass the cheap NYU bar scene and seek out this underground cocktail oasis - you won't regret it.",3,,1
45,Matt U.,"San Mateo, CA",238,79,14,5.0,12/11/2017,"This has a really fun and unique vibe, sort of a speakeasy. The menu is a few pages long, but the cocktails really shine. A faint light is aimed at the center of the table that seats two and everything else is dimly lit, so it feels like it's you and your table aloneWe spent a couple hours sipping on variations on a negroni, made with tequila and tasting superior imo, and Hadrians wall made with ardbeg scotch for me.  My wife had a few absinthe focused and creative mixtures that both impressed.The bathrooms are clean, and everything about the overall venue experience was top notch.

There's no password or anything required to get in, and the ambience is both cozy and intimate, a perfect escape from the snow. There's a pretty extensive selection of cocktails to choose from, moderately priced for Manhattan (think $16 for a drink). My friend and I ordered Bring June Flowers and Animal Vegetable Mineral. Bring June Flowers was the perfect mix of herbal and sweet, the drinks were super aesthetically pleasing, what more to ask for?I can't say how this place compares to other cocktail bars in Manhattan, but The Up & Up is absolutely a bar worth visiting regardless.",,,

Came at exactly 5pm was carded at the door and escorted to our seats expecting a little more than a completely empty bar. But I love the speak easy vibes after a few steps downstairs. Quiet, quaint, and very sexy dark downstairs. The bartender, George, was very attentive and answered all our silly questions, great for service! Drinks tried:Amongst the Grottoes - loved the play on something spicy with gin, never had that taste blend before and appreciated it. Stay Gold - Very spicy but not bad (sorry for the generalization, but probably my favorite here)Zuzu's petals -sadly just tastes like an upgraded margarita and I expected more. The roses were heavy and just couldn't get past it, the ginger is faint which was pretty surprising. Screen Door slam - technical drink that hits all the notes, from the lightness of vanilla to the sweetness of the honey. The makers mark makes the least appearance, but very well made. Our favorites: Relationship Goals & The Quilt Room (sucker for a shaken drink these were exceptional!) not to sweet and perfectly balanced.Surprise trip is the bonus! Must try if you like a simple earthy toned drink and don't be intimated by the ingredients. Thanks for the great experience!",,1,1

On point!I came here with my friend as a post dinner drinks spot since it was right next to Saigon Shack so it was super convenient. Good thing we got there early around 6pm because they have a waiting list to get a table inside this bar. They limit the amount of patrons inside so the whole vibe and ambiance doesn't get diffused - which I totally appreciate! It's hard to find a bar that's not divey in the West Village/NYU area so this is definitely a plus! Our waiter was super attentive and we felt super welcomed from the moment the front doorman took our name to when we were seated inside by the waiter. I don't recall the names of the drinks that we got but all of their names are really funny. They put a comical twists on each or the names to keep the menu fun.

When asked what the drink was, Abby said there was no name. So we decided to call it the ""Abby"". Definitely get it!I deducted one star just because I needed to be on a list in order to be let in.

(""Like the island"" HAHA) George!  (""Like the jungle"") and the other bartender with the waistcoat!  Thank you guys for chatting and laughing with us all night long about Games of Thrones and Dunkirk and for pouring us that Montenegro goodbye shot.  And Ellis for taking it so graciously when I told him he reminded me of Harry Styles (it's a compliment).  We had an absolute ball and can't wait to be back.",3,1,3

Surprisingly, there was no wait, and the very friendly man at the door gave me the option of heading in or waiting outside. I opted to head inside and get started on a drink, and the door guy took both my name and my friend's in order to better coordinate things upon her arrival. We were seated at the bar, which was fun. The bartenders were also friendly, but not obtrusive. I first tried the Felix Leiter (Woody Creek Gin, Bruxo Mezcal, Ardbeg Scotch, Cocchi Americano Rosa, Dry Vermouth, and Regan's Orange Bitters). I generally liked this drink. The smokey combination of mezcal and scotch is always a winner. It did taste ever-so-slightly watery, however.I was a bigger fan of my second drink, the Jungle Ration (Sacred Bond American Brandy, Atlantico Reserva Rum, Lustau Almacenista Amontillado Sherry, Pistachio Orgeat, Lemon Juice, and a mint garnish). Served swizzle-style and slightly sweet, with the orgeat taking center stage.I also absolutely adored the Up & Up's version of the cheese puff, which in this iteration featured airy puff pastry and baked cheese.

We went up to the bar and got some napkins, clean it up on our own. I've never experienced something like this before. We were going to get another drink, but, once again, none of the staff came by, so when they finally did we just cashed out.

How many are you tonight?""  Easy, right?But once we got inside and shook off the off-putting welcome, we settled in at the bar and had a great time.  The bartenders were friendly, the menu was interesting, and the drinks were delicious.  But man... front of house.  Yo, GM, what's the story here?  Seems like you could make an easy improvement here and avoid pissing so many people off.  Surely that's not the plan, right?",2,2,

This place is the complete opposite.The bar has a rule that you're not allowed to engage in conversation with strangers, which was great because it made the place more like a sit down restaurant where you hang out with friends instead of dudes checking out girls. The menu selection was also very classy, while the staff was super friendly and helpful when you need help selecting a drink.Overall amazing experience, most likely will go back when I'm traveling in NY again.",2,1,4
73,Kelly R.,"New York, NY",151,58,24,4.0,2/10/2018,Nice ambiance and skilled bartending. Drinks are very tasty - only complaint is that the snowcone-type drinks have maybe 4oz of actual drink in there. Not worth $15 for a few sips,,,
74,Travis L.,"Seattle, WA",50,357,72,5.0,5/12/2017,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I don't like to drink socially. It's just not my thing. However, I would come back here for sure and bring a friend or two.The atmosphere is outstanding. It's properly lit, so you can see who you're talking to; the music is at an appropriate level to enjoy, yet you can easily hear the person your speaking with; and it's clean without feeling sterile.The drinks are the main attraction, imo. There is a wide range and they are each an adventure in their own right.Finally, fantastic service, ever present without hovering, not pushy but very knowledgeable.",3,,1
75,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,4.0,4/29/2017,"Three words come to mind when I think of this cocktail bar: sexy, sophisticated, and surprising.From the outside, its ugly green and white sign looks like it's for a dive bar. But approach the stairs leading down into a basement-level bar and you'll be greeted by a very friendly host. The host is responsible for keeping the bar from becoming too crowded, which is much appreciated. Once a table is available, the host then transfers you over to another, equally friendly host, who brings you to your table and provides you with an impressive cocktail menu. A third person, a knowledgeable waiter, will take care of you from there.Because the cocktail menu is just a touch overwhelming, I strongly suggest you solicit your waiter's advice before ordering. I thought I knew what I was doing, and ordered a drink that, although made well, was not suited for my palate. That said, the drinks are very sophisticated, pretty, and pricey. I will definitely come back.",3,,1

The Up & Up is one of those fun places to try or take to impress someone. The drink menu is filled with quirky names that also taste great and the ambiance is very ""chill but posh"".

The service was great from the moment we entered. The guy out front was super friendly and engaging and our server was no different. Even when the bar started getting crowded, we were never pressured to leave or hurry up. So great.So the drinks! All of our drinks were well crafted, strong, and delicious. They are all definitely on the pricier side but worth it for one or two. The menu had a good variety...totally recommend the insanely good gin and tonic. Trust me!",,,
82,Anne-Marie B.,"Katy, TX",187,258,145,5.0,11/8/2017,"NYC never fails to disappoint where discreet basement bars are concerned and The Up & Up is no exception. This is a dimly-lit little joint with some of the best cocktails I've ever had. I didn't even mind the table of NYU students loudly pondering the meaning of life and the purpose of capitalism next to me (us Texas folk don't get that kind of excitement in our normal lives, you see). The back of the bar menu leaves a note for the gents to refrain from approaching ladies unless facilitated by a bartender which I think is a real classy move. We got a Brings June Flowers and a Screen Door Slam on our short pre-dinner visit and they each were generous portions of perfection (respectively, of course - I try and steer clear of brown liquor and Absynthe at every available opportunity but to each their own). This is also conveniently located near Comedy Cellar which is a place that houses some of my all-time favorite NYC memories, so it easily earned all five stars I have to give and then some. I highly, highly recommend a visit.",1,,1

My friend and I were out for dinner catching up after not seeing each other and wanted to grab a drink after and The Up & Up was the first place we saw. I'm not the biggest fan of loud bars so this was the perfect place for me. The drinks are all well priced and are made to perfection. I had the Shaddock and Smoke, which was very good. I've never had scotch before but this drink was refreshing and I could've had another one if I had time to stay for longer. 100% recommend if you're looking for a relaxing night with friends or a date over drinks. You'll see me there again.",1,,

Automatically 3 stars in my bookSecond, the drinks aren't bad. To be honest, the drink I had was totally unbalanced and a bit sickly sweet but looking at the description, I guess it's my own fault (Santa Teresa 1796 Rum, Grapefruit Juice, Lime Juice, Coffee, and Demerara - Papa's Magical Services)",2,,2

91,Adrienne R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,23,2,2.0,6/16/2017,"This is a really cute spot for cocktails. Ambiance is amazing. Service incredible. However, the cocktails - unfortunately - were subpar. My husband and I absolutely love cocktails and have tasted them at numerous spots across the city (angels share is tops btw). I wasn't entirely enthusiastic about their cocktail menu, and unfortunately was told they would NOT make bespoke cocktails. Nor would they switch alcohol in the cocktails (I wanted to sub tequila for gin, but was told they could not). Don't get me wrong - I get that some places insist on sticking to the menu (and therefore do not allow substitutions or even custom cocktails), just please disclose this up front. Especially for a cocktail bar, where customization is to be expected. Regardless - we really wanted to like this spot (as it had come highly recommended to us), so my husband and I tried 5 different cocktails. To be honest, None of them really tasted that special or interesting. Not only that - they were especially weak (must have been 1 shot or less...). Btw, the New York standard of 2 shots is definitely not met by this spot. Despite our best efforts to get buzzed, 5 cocktails here did not do the trick. Bottom line: if you're looking for a cocktail bar to get drunk and/or taste interesting/delicious cocktails, this is not the spot for you.",,,

It's unpretentious, intimate and just an overall cool spot to enjoy any one of their $15 cocktails. It's located in Greenwich Village on MacDougal Street in a beautiful lower level space that's dimly lit with wallpaper lined walls. We got right in with no wait on a weekday night around 9 pm. We were greeted by the two nicest people. I love that the staff here talk to you to get a sense of what you like in a drink and provide great recommendations. I really enjoyed the ""zuzu's petal"" - Tromba Tequila Blanco, Ginger, Habanero Pepper, Rose Water, Lime Juice, and Demerara. This drink is refreshing and has a lovely heat to it from the habanero. It's like the best lime margarita with a bit of spice. I absolutely loved it. All the flavours melded so well to create such a great drink. Loved this place!",2,1,2
94,Mike K.,"Manhattan, NY",2,23,0,4.0,6/1/2018,"Not your typical spot for the area. It's downstairs and has a completely more relaxed vibe than the street where it's located. If you are a whiskey/bourbon kind of person, the cocktails here were solid. The bartender made some great drinks. Also, as any place should have, they had a large block ice cube for the cocktail. Just an added bonus for those who are annoyed by great drinks ruined by small ice cubes that melt quickly and water down the cocktail. Definitely a place to check out before the comedy cellar or just passing by.",,,

I like to enjoy my drink and not just get drunk. And I like to taste delicious new things. This place hit the mark. We were sat at the bar (two of us) immediately. The place is cozy and warmed up to us though the initial descent down the stairs into a concrete bar made it feel a bit dungeony. Both bartenders we interacted with were friendly, helpful, and seemed to genuinely enjoy their work. The drinks were really good too. Yes cocktails are expensive but it's worth it. Plus at $15 a drink is it really any more expensive than any other place? I'll be back. NB also plays good music and doesn't blast it.",5,1,7

The tables are tight. My gal pal smack a guy in the head with her bag squeezing between tables. Also the bar had seats around the small bar. The bar is great for a small group or a date.

I went with a couple of friends on a Saturday at 5pm. It had just opened and was pretty quiet. The scene was very cool and speak easy like. The bartenders were very service oriented and came over several times to provide advice on our order and check in. We told them what we liked and they provided spot on suggestions and detailed descriptions of the drinks. Even as the bar got busier! From what it seems like, they only seat people - they don't allow standing. I like this a lot because it makes the environment feel much less crowded. I would definitely suggest this spot for an intimate date or to go with a group of friends (but go early because it definitely gets busy.All of the drinks we got were great.

105,Kate F.,"Brooklyn, NY",243,5,2,5.0,11/12/2017,"Here's a thing about the up and up: even though you only come here every so often, you always feel like a regular. The staff here goes out of their way to make you feel welcome by offering you the best drinks in town. There are many places in NYC to get a cocktail, but I'm firmly of the belief that the aren't many places that can combine quality cocktails with a commitment to hospitality that you typically only find at the best hotels.  Whether it's the perfect soundtrack that you can hear and appreciate but that doesn't take over your conversation, or the wallpaper and collage art that make you feel like you've sat down for a drink at your best friend's house (not some hoity toity bar), or the guy at the door that makes you feel like you're the most important person to walk in that day, even though there's definitely a celebrity sitting at the bar. I don't know. All I know is that my cocktail - which, let's be clear was delicious: these are some of the best and most inventive cocktails in town and I don't think there exists a drink that the bartenders here couldn't talk intelligently about - was more than just delicious.

I also had a difficult time finding this place from across the street since the sign was perpendicular to me. With the help of google maps, I finally found it and was surprised that it had a bit of a speak easy vibe. Someone stands outside with a clipboard and you have to walk down some dim stairs. I arrived at 6pm and the door person was super nice. My friend wasn't here yet but offered to let me sit downstairs first. This seems like a rare offer these days. Once we did get to sit downstairs, I was immediately struck by the dim lighting, wall paper and cozy seating. Our server was very helpful in suggesting drinks based on my preference for Manhattans and my water glass was NEVER empty. I loved both of my drinks - screen door slam and town & country.

I also tried the seventy-four and would advise that you not order that. The scene was very Ellen Parsons meeting up with Patty Hewes discussing a secret witness in a case (Refer to the TV show - ""Damages"")... Incidentally, the group of women I was with happened to be discussing issues that were not so far off. If you're not careful, you will miss it. The entrance is tucked downstairs. I entered at 5:30 pm on a work night, there were only 4 people in the whole spot sitting at the bar. It was classy and a bit seductive.

Up and Up fit the first two criteria but not the last. The menu cocktails did not interest me so when the mixologist came I asked him if he could make me a fruity, tasty cocktail preferably with berry flavor. He said no and could only make something grapefruit and lemon (which were on the menu). DUH. I knew those options existed but they didn't interest me. I asked him if he could substitute one of the cocktails on the menu with scotch instead of brandy and he said no. Sooooo....I just ordered a penicilin.Mixologists should have with range.

First and foremost, this place is an oasis in the desert in this pretty horrible neighborhood for bars and restaurants.  I went here on a Tuesday night, so take this with a grain of salt off your margarita.  I rolled in here and was, at one point, the only person at the bar.  Not IN the bar, there were  a decent amount of couples and small groups, but I was the only one sitting at the bar.  This gave me a chance to speak to the bartender and figure out what the hell to order.  The drink menu here is extensive, creative, confusing and maybe a little obscene (i.e. absinthe-focused drinks, mixers that nobody actually knows what they are, etc.).    The place just screams sexy.  There were many many dates here. Plenty of people here enjoying the cocktails, thinking about the same thing...There are some rules, which are a bit weird the more I think about it.  This partly where the annoyance comes in.  1) no large groups (totally fine and agree) 2) bar will clear you out 45 mins after last drink order (makes sense) 3) Men are not allowed to approach women but women may approach men, or be introduced (ok...) I see what you are trying to do.  But, how often does this happen? Well, I asked the bartender who has been there for 3 years...he informed me, once, this magical bartender as cupid has happened exactly once.  So, Up & Up, you're off and off massively on who you think you are attracting here.  Which leads me to the major downer, the manager kept coming over and harassing us about moving our stuff to ""accommodate other guests"". Totally fine, if it wasn't a Tuesday night, if there were other guests coming in, and/or you Mr. Bar manager had arrived before the paying guests you were constantly nudging, prodding, speaking to (we didn't come here to hang with you). Then this ""might"" make sense to be that over the top about, but even then it seems desperate. This doesn't happen at the places you are trying to mimic. Trust me, it just doesn't.  Otherwise, most people will just make this place a one and done...up to you hombre.",,,

An impressive amount of space is maintained at all times, enough for everyone inside to sit plus some (even when there's a wait time). Prices are about $15 a cocktail, which I think is absolutely fine for NYC. Staff wise: The hostess outside was a DOLL. I think her name was Angela. Loved her!The bartenders left some room for personality and a warm welcome. They do their job, don't engage, and are slow to serve. They take your order but it takes 15 minutes to get your drink.

The Up & Up is the only one I have been to that really feels like a step back into early 1930's New York City and that is one of the main reasons it is one of my very favorite bars. Judging from other patrons, attire seems to be smart-casual, which can be translated into either jeans and blouse/button up, or cocktail dresses and blazers. Show up at the door in either of those things and you will be welcomed the same, as all seating is truly first-come, first-served. It is refreshing to not have a bouncer looking you up and down trying to decide if you're 'worthy' enough for an establishment like this.Just wait until you see the cocktail menu. The first time I read it, I was sure I would be there all night and needed to try everything. Then I drank two and got up to the bathroom, where I decided I better slow myself down. These drinks are strong and delicious - the ideal combination when it comes to mixology.Take a step off the hustle and belligerently drunken bustle of MacDougal street and feel like an adult for a moment while you share a conversation with a friend and enjoy the intimate but casual nature of this underground establishment. Thumbs up for The Up & Up.",1,,
119,Kartik I.,"New York, NY",79,53,41,5.0,12/31/2016,"I hangout at McDougal street really often and somehow never managed to spot this place before. This tiny little spot is easy to miss, but once you step in, its hard to forget. With really knowledgeable servers and bartenders, this is now one of my favorite bars in the city. My top recommendation is definitely Shaddock & Smoke. I love my Islays and this drink is definitely one of my top picks in the city. Smoked with a touch of sweetness and lime.  We got 6 drinks between the 3 of us and all of them were just amazing. Would recommend taking recommendations from the servers and bartenders if youre into trying new things. They were nice enough to replace a drink we didnt like. Overall, this is definitely 5/5 and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a classy cocktail bar with top end drinks!",1,,1

Not great, not bad just pretty okay. But the hostess is very unpleasant human being and she ruins the experience from the onset. I'm not paying $17 for a vodka soda (!) to deal with unpleasant and potentially bitter human beings after a hard day of work.",,,
121,Ashish D.,"Manhattan, NY",56,195,254,4.0,11/12/2016,"Was pleasantly surprised by this underground cocktail bar/lounge. It's got a very nondescript green sign outside. We went pretty early at around 6 pm and the place was pretty empty. I really like their decor, very old world and charming. The waiters are friendly and attentive. The bar tender who served us our first round of drinks was also very nice, making good recommendations. Drinks at 15$ are certainly not cheap compared to other bars in the area, but are pretty inventive and taste great. We got the Negroni, and old fashioned or old flaskoned as they call it, served in a flask, which was my favorite. A friend got the Hill wife, which was made with pisco and came with grapes, very interesting. They also have something called the one star Yelp review, lol. They do serve some bar snacks but we didn't try any. Try this place if you are in the area.",2,1,2

We were asked if we could squeeze into a booth, and it was a cinch. The entrance is more secretive than the space below. I love the green floral wallpaper. Random collages of old ads adorn the walls, but otherwise the decor is sparse. Lots of different seating options depending on your party size and a ton of standing room.The cocktails here are weird. Or creative. I guess it depends on what you want to call it. I appreciated the small icons that told you how your $15 cocktail would be served. None of the combinations were familiar to us. Our drinks came out pretty quickly. I'd say none of us were swooning over our drinks, but we drank 'em.

A very good date spot. I ordered 'More Intensity' and it was delicious. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The menu is extensive with many creative cocktails.

Also their Old fashioned is a must try. Great cocktail list to explore from. Hidden in the cloud of the quick and cheap bars in the west village. Must try!,,,
127,Vivian H.,"Chinle, AZ",1075,1948,46,5.0,7/11/2016,"Gentleman please refrain from starting up a conversation with the ladies here, but ladies feel free to start up a conversation with a gentleman or have the bartender make an introduction for you. And this in so many words are what is written on their menu. Pretty classy, if you ask me and definitely would love for the bartender to help make intros for me!This place is a real treat in this part of town, where usually the college kids go on   the weekend to get smashed. And when I was in my 20s that was the thing to do, but now I enjoy decent drinks that won't give me a terrible hangover the next day and I'd like to preserve what hearing I have left. Up & Up is in the style of Prohibition-era speakeasy, so be prepared for hidden and low key. Exactly how I enjoy my trysts. I was in town for the July 4th weekend and we popped in here on a Sunday evening around 8pm and we didn't have to wait at all and were quickly seated right at the bar! Bartenders were extremely professional and approachable. Drinks were amazing here. My date got the Manhattan and I opted for the Hill Wife as I was in the mood for celery on a nice hot summery night. All cocktails are $15, standard for NYC and drinks were well-made, balanced and delicious. No rowdiness or raunchiness ensued, only good conversation and flirting lubricated with exceptionally executed cocktails. A great place to impress that special someone or to keep exciting that apple of your eye. Highly recommend this place. Two thumbs and two toes up! It's a winner!",11,4,11

It's cocktail pricey, but it isn't overpriced, and the drinks are fabulous. It's got cool wallpaper, great seating, and warm staff. I could honestly rave about this place for paragraphs. Something I found really cool were the bar rules, specifically the rule that men cannot approach women to hit on them. If anyone in the bar finds another person attractive, they can only make contact by passing a message through the bartender. If the other person accepts your invitation, you will be seated together by the hostess. How awesome is that?? This bar is just snazzy in all the best ways and they provide a safe, comfortable atmosphere for everyone. I can't wait to make this my regular go-to.PS- This bar has great selfie lighting.",3,,3
131,Eamonn H.,"Easton, PA",43,148,85,4.0,4/30/2017,"While waiting for a show to start at the Comedy Cellar, my girlfriend and I stopped by this dark little cocktail bar.  On a Friday night at around 8 pm, there wasn't much of a wait for a table for two.  The bar itself was a little loud, but not so loud that I couldn't hear what my girlfriend was saying.  My drink, the Amongst The Grottos, was so refreshing on a hot night, and the jalapeño gave it a nice bite.  Her cocktail (the One-Star Yelp Review) was sweet, but not sickeningly so.  It's a little pricy, but the drinks were obviously made with care, so I didn't feel ripped off by any means.  Also, gotta appreciate a bar that tells dudes not to creep on the female patrons in the menu.  If you're a woman who wants to just grab a drink solo or with some girlfriends without being bothered, this might be a good place to look at.",2,,

My friend ordered the ""The Teague Old Fashioned"" which is served in a flask bottle, how unique. Like the server said ""it's small but it'll get you messed up. My other friend ordered the ""Seven Door Slam"", which was made with bourbon, aperol, honey, vanilla beam and absinthe. For myself, I ordered the ""Shaddock & Smoke"", as you can tell from the name, it was a smoked drink made with scotch, grapefruit liqueur, amaretto, lemon and seltzer. It was fruity, smoky and delicious! I would definitely recommend coming here if you are around the Greenwich village area.",3,,3

134,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,6/7/2015,"When I first heard that a new cocktail lounge had opened up in the heart of Greenwich Village on MacDougal Street, I was simultaneously skeptical (given the sheer number of quick and college student-friendly venues on that perimeter) and impressed. There's very few places in that immediate area that will offer an option for more complex drinks served in a less-than-raucous atmosphere... and the venue's name, a nod to the bartending terminology of either stirring or shaking a drink in ice and straining it upon presentation, was a promising note.Keep your eyes peeled for the small ""Up and Up"" sign, which will direct you to a flight of stairs leading underground. (Make your final texts and check-ins here, as cell phone reception will similarly decline.) The venue itself is surprisingly spacious, with a lengthy bar area and two separate seating areas; one is tucked away near the entrance while the other consists of a row of tightly-packed two-tops. Layout-wise, it's not the most optimal use of the space, especially for larger groups, but it'll provide enough personal space for guests to have a conversation without fear of being overheard.I had to go with the Red House Cobbler, which was a beautifully blended mixture of Citadelle Gin and Fino Sherry with Lime Juice and muddled Fresh Raspberries. The name is taken from William Morris' Kent estate, and is a successful riff on the traditional Sherry Cobbler; it's one of the lighter and more refreshing options on their menu, with just enough zing and sweetness to disguise the sheer potency of alcohol that is also in the mix... Served on the rocks, it makes for an ideal summer drink and was my favorite cocktail that I tried that evening.For those who are similarly unendowed with the necessary enzymes to properly break down alcohol, the Up & Up offers ""Halfsies"" versions of several drinks. The original version of the Jenny Kidd I tried (Bar Hill Gin, St. Gemaine, Campari, and Lemon Juice) was a solid drink, but some of the later modifications (utilizing rum and honey) probably made it more robust. I'd certainly give it another chance.The Up & Up is a welcome addition to the Greenwich Village options, without a doubt. While reservations can only be made for larger parties, take advantage of the fact that this cocktail lounge is still relatively new; it'll certainly make the right first impressions.",21,11,17

Drinks are the usual $15-16. Zuzu's Petals was an awesome drink name until I drank the drink. It just ended up being a tequila-based cocktail that was way too smokey for my taste. Made me sad that such a great name was used for such an average cocktail. :/,,,
137,Aruna A.,"Rahway, NJ",94,537,12,5.0,8/3/2016,"We've been going to up and up since it basically opened. It is sort of the best. The menu rotates depending on what the bartenders are working on / developing / able to get their hands on. And the menu is SOLID. Every drink I've gotten there has been better than the last, and that's definitely not my experience with most bars. I'm really impressed every time with what they come up, with what they serve, and the intelligence the bartenders speak with when talking about cocktails. The service is good, cocktails pricey (but worth every dollar), and ambiance clam and easy. Overall, a classy joint on a street jam packed with not so classy but delicious eateries. It's a great spot to stop in and get away from the hustle and bustle.  Definitely go here!",1,,2

142,Daniel T.,"Glen Echo, MD",99,6,0,1.0,9/3/2017,"The Up and Up was a real downer. After being seated, we waited for 10 minutes before snagging a bus boy to get service, which seemed odd for a place touting $15 cocktails with craft ingredients and service in mind. On reading the menu, we were disappointed to see base ingredients like makers mark. Makers is a fine rail, but a $15 cocktail does not make. Jeffersons, or Basil Hayden's  is my free advice.  Once our order was placed, we gave the Up and Up another chance - but waited 25 minutes for cocktails to appear - but alas none came. The place was half full and no explanation provided for the obtuse and poorly executed service.  In sum, the Up and Up was a real down and down for my old neighborhood.",2,1,1

This place has been open for a year now and they seem to be doing great! Similar to all the other ""big names"" in the mixology industry, this place has a fantastic menu. Very easy to understand and just enough to not overwhelm you. My wife and I plowed through 8 drinks in a short period of time, but the most memorable were the Midori sour and the 74. The butternut squash and toast spread was a nice touch. We weren't able to sit at the bar but the server and bartender gave us a lot of attention and made us feel right at home. The cocktail prices are what you'd expect for a place like this and they are justified. It's just a matter of time before these guys start popping up on the ""top 10"" lists. Oh...

148,Chris M.,"Los Angeles, CA",188,35,2,1.0,6/5/2018,"I thought the cocktails were well made, but the attitude of one of the staff was atrocious. The girl that served us - white girl, black hair - appeared from the get-go, to annoyed she was there and annoyed we had questions about the drinks. A couple of our interactions she was really quite argumentative. At one time, she actually came up to our table not to see if wee needed anything, but to say she'd overheard our conversation from 15 mins earlier and wanted to tell us what she thought about our ideas and that basically we were wrong or at least she didn't agree with them. I thought to myself, why am i interested in what you think and why do you think that I need to hear your opinion on a private conversation we were having. It was very strange and sullied our experience and she sure seemed to not like us.. There was a kind of elitist feel, where on two occasions she returned behind the bar and whispered to the male bartender - a white kid with light hair and little moustache - and they would snigger, look at us and then laugh at, what appeared to be, our expense. Pretty sure they didn't own the place and considering how quiet the placed was, and how busy the street was, maybe their attitude was the reason the place was empty? It certainly is counter-intuitive to make your guests feel uncomfortable, considering how many options there are in Greenwich and considering most people are working for tips.. If I owned this place I'd be pretty unhappy to hear my employees were costing me money.. We had 7 cocktails between us at Up n Up and left, found another bar where we were treated much better and had another 20 drinks between us all at least.. She definitely cost herself a big tip and her employer at least $300 - $400 dollars that night because we left the bar because of her. Pretty dumb move young lady..",,,

It's a good place to talk and spend some time with a friend because the space is rather intimate and they limit the number of people in the space at any time. It has a speakeasy feel to it but the place is not hidden -- however the bar is located down a set of stairs.The bartender for the night recommended The Gap Theory. She had trouble describing the taste but ultimately described it as ""kind of like drinking a cloud."" I was a little apprehensive at first since the cocktail has notes of spiciness which is not generally something I enjoy in cocktails. However, I am very glad that she made the recommendation because the separation of the liquid cocktail from the cream on top made it very fun to drink! I liked the unique taste and enjoyed that it was not spirit-forward yet still packed a punch (enough to get me a little buzzed).My friend unfortunately did not have such a good experience with her choice and barely even touched her drink.

I've been to the bar about five times over the past two years, but it seems like there has been a change in management. My previous visits were okay. Decent but overpriced cocktails, but super close to my apartment so it was convenient. Yesterday, however, I was hanging out with some people from out of town who were staying nearby so I encouraged them to check it out. My fiancée arrived there before I did and sat down at a table waiting for the group. When my friend and I arrived at the door, the bouncer informed us that we would have to wait, despite my fiancée having a table. The bouncer then proceeded to kick her out and said she suffered from bad etiquette. Our group likely would have spent $200 or more on drinks, but Up & Up's policy of inducing perceived scarcity was more important than that. Up & Up has gone downhill over the years and has grown far more uppity than its cocktails deserve.* *I signed the petition that allowed Up & Up to open up in our neighborhood.

After about ten minutes the door guy came over and was like ""who told you you could sit here""-- I'm sorry what?  Apparently there was a small black sign outside saying ""wait to be seated"" but no one was manning the front and it was freezing outside so you can see how someone could easily miss that sign. He then escorted me out (!) as if I had just started a fight or offended someone! I was totally polite the whole time and he had the nerve to say I was ""tactless"" for not seeing the sign outside the door.... how is it ""tactless"" to walk into a bar and sit down? Especially on Macdougal street where the drunkest of the drunk go to fall in their own vomit?",6,3,1
160,Puja S.,"Manhattan, NY",106,26,2,5.0,10/7/2017,A few friends and I went here for a drink. I was shocked by how classy this place was for it to be on McDougal street. Enjoyed all the cocktails and service! Best part is the location...all my favorite quick bites are nearby! Highly recommend!!!,,,

Updated review",This cocktail bar continues to be a hidden gem on the crazy street that is MacDougal. I come here often because of the continuous slew of phenomenal cocktails & excellent service. I can't recommend this bar enough. Pro tip: sit at the bar and talk to one of the bartenders about your preferences. They'll steer you towards a new or inventive cocktail!,,,
162,Jay B.,"New York, NY",7,25,2,1.0,12/3/2016,"A few other reviews mention this and I'd like to reiterate: major weirdness in regards to the front of house communication here. Love cocktail bars and totally understand that many in the city do table service with a host reminiscent of a restaurant. A few fantastic cocktail bars nearby, Little Branch and Pegu Club, also has a host that handles seating. But the door staff here seems to have an issue understanding how establishments treat the door. If there are no tables available, that's fine, just say so and we will go somewhere else. In this case a friend was let in (another review mentions the same thing) clearly stating our group was coming, she was seated at a table that would accommodate all of us (looking good so far) and then when the rest of us came to the door, they asked us to wait and then went into the bar to find her and kicked her out! Although there were many tables available they said she misled them. This is a girl that honestly isn't trying to game any bar. I think we are all pretty versed in how to go to a bar or restaurant and get seated. Somehow this got to a very weird place tonight. The bouncer used some very odd language to explain why they kicked her out.So one caveat, this place is on MacDougal street. I live on MacDougal street so I understand the crowd there can be pretty rowdy. Fortunately the nice places on the block (Minetta Tavern) figure out that you still treat people with respect. Unfortunately I think they need a new door guy, stop by the pegu club, little branch or all the fantastic cocktail bars in the east village to see how it's done. This could've been a perfect cocktail bar for the neighborhood. Our group alone would've spent hundreds of dollars in a few hours and who knows as we dropped in regularly (it's right downstairs from our apartment). Huge miss.",5,1,1

164,Victoria H.,"Los Angeles, CA",413,255,1683,5.0,1/15/2017,"We popped in here when we were visiting NYC for a couple weeks around the holidays. The bar was around the corner from our apartment so it was a no brainer...we wanted good, interesting cocktails and a chill vibe. At the door, we were greeted and asked how many we were and if we were expecting anyone else, nope, just us two! We were lucky to get 2 seats at the bar, where you can watch the bartenders work their magic. Katie was our bartender and she was AWESOME! I love spicy mezcal drinks and she was able to make me a couple that were not on the menu that she thought I'd like. They were delicious. She was so rad that we decided to come spend NYE here, since we had no plans. It was great because this bar has no standing room and Katie assured us they were not going to oversell the bar, so everyone would get a reserved seat! Yay!! No frat boy pushing past you to get a PBR! The deal was actually pretty good.. it was about $275ish for the two of us, open bar 9pm-2am and it ended up being a really fun, chill time! I would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a cute place to have a few cocktails with experienced and friendly bartenders and staff.

My drink of choice--Asking For a Friend--was delicious, as was my friend's Shaddock & Smoke. Why the 3-stars? I didn't really get the deal with the dice, nor was it ever explained, and while most of the space was completely empty, the bar itself was extremely cramped--with maybe 8 people seated. I'm petite and take up very little space, so there's no reason for the bar seating to be so tight. There isn't much ambiance, either. It's not exactly an attractive place to people-watch or admire the design. If cocktails are $15 I expect the full experience--more along the lines of Angel's Share.",,,
168,Ikaika R.,"Brooklyn, NY",14,102,71,2.0,11/12/2016,"Amazing cocktails, but there seems to be a disconnect in communication between patrons and staff regarding protocol. I came here with friends to celebrate my birthday. There were only three of us who were celebrating that night. The friend that got there first was going to surprise me with my drink upon arrival. When i texted her that I was a minute away, she tried to order she was denied. Additionally she emailed ahead of time to see if we could light a candle to celebrate my birthday and sing me into a new year of life. She got approval but when we actually started singing we were asked to stop mid-song. We respect policy, but we probably would've respected them enough to go to another establishment who could offer us what we needed for the night. All that's to be said, the cocktails themselves were solid and well made. If you're coming here for a drink with a friend, it's great. If your'e trying to celebrate something special, it might be best to find another establishment that will give you the freedom to celebrate.",7,,1

172,Nneka U.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,82,104,1.0,5/13/2017,"GO TO PEGU CLUB INSTEAD!!!The drinks were actually pretty good. The service, however...I am so tired of these Manhattan establishments that try to implement a door policy that wreaks of racism. I came here to meet a friend for a quick drink. It was approximately 7:15/7:30pm on a Friday. When I arrived, there was a hipster white dude who had a clipboard and paper with a list of names on it at the door. At this point, I'm thinking, ""shit, did I need to make a reservation or something?"" But thankfully, my friend had arrived before me and put our names on the list, which I saw. When I gave the hipster doorman my name and pointed to it on his list, he gave me one of those fake, ""Hi, welcome...I'll take care of you in just a sec"" type of response. Then he proceeds to ""study"" this list of names for approximately 3 minutes. Meanwhile, there's no one else on the line waiting to get in but me. Of course I become irritated because I don't understand why he won't let me down into the bar, especially when my friend literally arrived at the bar about 15 minutes before I got there, AND, gave the doorman both our names. The host comes outside and says something to the doorman and the doorman ""announced"" my arrival to the host, who slips back inside the bar. Shortly afterwards, the doorman finally ""allows"" me to go down into the bar. I walk in to find my friend, who just so happened to be the ONLY black guy in the bar (who is big and tall, as he is a former NFL football player-turned-attorney/venture capitalist), standing at a little bar table with his drink, while EVERYONE ELSE in the bar was seated. I became even more irritated and I almost left, but my friend, who admittedly has a higher tolerance for bullshit than I do, calmed me down. The host approached us at the itty bitty table where my friend and I  were standing, and I asked if we could get a table, to which he obliged. We stayed for less than an hour because we had dinner plans with some other friends. But believe me, I will not be returning to this place ever again. I decided to read some of the other reviews left by patrons to this establishment, and it seems that racism is their M.O., despite the fact that the management has tried to explain their unprofessional conduct as ""door policy."" I am an employment discrimination attorney, so I investigate discriminatory conduct for a living. It's amazing that a lot of these businesses here in NYC act with such a disregard for basic civil rights. And yes, with the current establishment in office, maybe they feel like they can get away with it. But perhaps I'm expecting too much from a city that produced a Donald Trump after all. #BlackLivesMatter #BlackMoneyMatters",5,3,2
173,Taylor A.,"Atlanta, GA",144,646,45,5.0,11/8/2015,"This was easily my favorite bar in my four day NYC trip. We had midnight show tickets to the Comedy Cellar, which is across the street, and saw great reviews for this cocktail bar so we were excited come here. We were greeted by a host upon entering who inquired about the size of our party (six) and he went into the bar to see if he could fit us.The coolest thing about this bar is that capacity is moderated by the host so it will never get packed. This is something a lot of other bars should do so you know what kind of vibe to expect. After about 20 minutes we were seated inside this 70s basement bar with really fresh and interesting decor. It really reminded me of 60s/70s style.Our server was great and the cocktails were even better. The ingredients and quality of the mixology is fantastic. My wife ended up getting a take on an old fashioned that came in a glass flask. I had some lemon-y drink that was excellent as well. No one in our party disliked what they had, so I think you'll be able to find something excellent.",4,1,2

180,Jessica D.,"Sunnyside, NY",4,14,7,5.0,12/14/2016,"CHAPTER 1: The serviceI came to this place for Jacob, whom I had met at his previous location.  The first time I met him, he set something on fire, then held it towards us and said, ""Smell this!""  I also spoke to him at length about an infuser I had purchased with peppers in it.  I said I like my things spicy but the instructions said to infuse for 1-3 days, and asked his advice about whether I should let it go longer than that.  He suggested that I add more peppers, and when I asked him what kind, he put some of his own into a little mason jar, gave it to me, and said, ""Just bring the jar back sometime.""  We were living very far away and didn't come back for many months, but when we walked in the next time (with his jar), he instantly recognized us.  Then he gave us a tonka bean, with a warning to use sparingly.Customer.  For.  Life.In the past couple of years I've taken numerous people to meet Jacob.  Every single one of them has left impressed.  When you tell him what you like, he actually listens, and will do his best to ensure that you're happy with your drink.  My stepdad told him that he likes scotch, but has never had a cocktail made with scotch that he's enjoyed.  Jacob said, ""Challenge accepted!"" and happily got to work.  My mom is fairly picky, and Jacob let her smell/taste about a dozen different things before committing to making her a drink, to make sure she wasn't stuck with something she wouldn't have liked.Best of all, he is so very kind.  For how talented he is, he could be incredibly pretentious, but he is not.  I was at another ""fancy cocktail place"" once and there was only one heated drink listed on the menu.  It didn't have the type of liquor I wanted in it, so I asked the ""mixologist"" if they had any other warm fall-themed drinks and he said, ""Not really.""  So then I asked him if he particularly liked the one that was listed and he curtly replied, ""I wouldn't put it on the menu if I didn't.""  So I ordered it, but was underwhelmed.  Jacob is the opposite of that guy.CHAPTER 2: The VenueCut to the present day.I live nowhere near this place and I don't have an unlimited subway card, so it took me a while to get around to checking it out.  I had a friend in town from across the country and her friend wanted to meet in the area, so I insisted that we go to The Up & Up.At first we were skeptical, because it was a Friday night, there was a bit of a wait, and we knew it would be expensive.  But after confirming that Jacob was working and that the wait wouldn't be too long, we stuck it out.Once we got downstairs, I was so glad we stayed!  It wasn't jam-packed and we didn't have to yell over the noise (and in turn miss half of what our friends were saying).  No fighting for a spot to put down our drinks or a back corner to huddle in.  In exchange for waiting outside a few minutes, we were given a table all to ourselves, clean and ready to go.  And since our friend was from out-of-town and we wanted to catch up with her, it was so incredibly pleasant to be able to actually have a conversation.  I'd say the volume inside was at ""healthy hum,"" as opposed to the ""jet engine"" I'd normally expect at a bar on a Friday night.Also, we loved the wallpaper and specifically discussed it while we were there.  I read another review that called it ""tacky.""  Guess there's no accounting for taste.Let me qualify my synopsis by saying that I moved to NYC only about three and a half years ago.  If you'd have told me then what I'd be paying for drinks now, I'd probably have keeled over from apoplexy.  This goes for all drinks, not just upscale cocktails.  I like to think of myself as frugal, but I'm actually just cheap.  I know the value of a dollar and I exert extreme care to ensure I use my resources carefully and wisely.So, hear me out.  I know that these are pricey drinks, and I don't drop that kind of money willy-nilly.  But it is worth it.  Even if you have to wait outside a few minutes, it's still worth it.",1,1,1

192,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,6/22/2015,"Wow, what a refuge in the absolute pandemonium that is MacDougal street on the weekend. Although this is called ""the Up & Up"", it's a bit of a misnomer because this place is actually underground. All the better to avoid apocalyptic conditions on ground level. I came here Friday night on the recommendation of another Yelper after he read my rave review of Amor y Amargo. Thanks to this good samaritan, I have found an enjoyable cocktail bar in Greenwich Village!This isn't your typical cocktail bar. It's most spacious than most, and there's very attentive table service. Almost immediately after walking in, an employee told us that we could stand at a table near the bar, and that a table would be ready for us shortly. I'm not used to that type of service at cocktails bars, but that may just be the nature of some of the venues I visited. Unlike its surroundings (did I mention Greenwich Village is crazy on the weekends? I forget), this place is cool, calm and classy. It's not exactly intimate - the ambiance is a bit more sterile - metal and marble, no candles - but the dim lighting still makes it a nice place to enjoy some beautifully-crafted cocktails with a couple good friends or a date. My first drink was the ""Astor Painless Anesthetic"" (pictured), composed of: Plymouth Gin, Tariquet Armagnac, Cocchi Americano, and Bonal Gentiane Quina, and Orange Bitters. This is a cocktail, my friends. It's a creative take on a martini - far more complex and enjoyable, in my opinion. Our waiter mentioned that it has both martini and gin and tonic elements, which is quite nice. I also ordered the ""Land Shark"" (Novo Fogo Barrel-Aged Cachaça, Bourbon, Green Chartreuse, Allspice Dram, Pistachio Orgeat, and Angostura & Orange Bitters) - which is, I suppose, a Manhattan derivative, though it's so much more. It pays homage to a Manhattan more than anything else - calling it a ""twist on a Manhattan"" doesn't really do it justice. Have you ever had a Manhattan with cachaca? Me neither. Well, now I have, and it's great. These are both boozier cocktails - there are plenty of others that are much lighter. This place isn't a speakeasy, but I'd still call it a hidden gem. It's an unexpected find in this neighborhood, which is likely why it wasn't busy at peak time. I'd say we came here around 11 - if this place was in the East Village, we probably would've needed to wait an hour to get in.",6,2,4
193,Ally C.,"New York, NY",499,239,136,5.0,10/13/2015,"Like a less pretentious and more spacious speakeasy. The entrance is a bit difficult to find, innocuously labeled down some stairs. Cocktails are mostly $14. They do deliver quality for the price. Waitstaff are polite and sharply dressed in attire reminiscent of the 1920s -- groomed facial hair, slicked hair, and suspenders. I ordered the False Witness, and my first reaction when I sipped it was ""Whoa this is strong!"" As the ice melted into the drink, it became sweeter though. The metal straw with the attachment at the end for breaking through the ice was an awesome touch. My friend ordered a drink that came in a glass flask.

197,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,3.0,5/19/2015,"My friend and I were searching for an unique drink spot one evening, so I checked my handy Yelp bookmarks and came across The Up & Up, a cocktail lounge that I must have read about somewhere and deemed worthy of a visit.  The quiet, dark space was hidden on the basement level of a West Village townhouse amongst the craziness of the MacDougal Street-Minetta Lane corner.  The floor was made of unfinished cement, and bare bulbs provided the small amount of light.  The unfinished space had the essence of being some sort of secret, exclusive lair.  The space housed several tables and a decent-sized bar, which was where we decided to station ourselves.A look at the beverage menu revealed some seriously potent concoctions.  My initial drink of choice was the Screen Door Slam, which included Maker's Mark Bourbon, Aperol, Honey, Vanilla Bean, and Absinthe.  The lightly sweetened brew was perfectly balanced, but packed a punch.  I then gave the Scotch Rickey a shot.  This one blended Famous Grouse Scotch, Lime Juice, and Angostura Bitters.  Though this sounded like a less imposing drink, it was also rather strong and tart.  Overall, the cocktails were enjoyable, but I had had better.  In addition, I was irritated when the bartender hit me with ice, while chiseling away at a glacier inside of a cocktail shaker.  Sure, mistakes happen, but I was pegged not once, but twice!  I would definitely return to The Up & Up for its ""in-the-know"" vibe, but I would suggest visiting Analogue around the corner for better cocktails and if attending with larger parties.",6,1,1

199,Rocel A.,"Buena Park, CA",3,20,1,5.0,7/4/2017,Had an exceptional time here!Atmosphere - walking down into the dimly lit bar really set the tone for your experience.  Candle light playing against the floral-wallpapered walls created an inviting atmosphere for delicious cocktails and great company!Service - excellent and friendly service with servers fully aware of how to create a cocktail that will delight their customers!  Our server spent about 5 min each helping my 2 friends determine the perfect concoction that would satisfy their cocktail craving.  I loved the feeling of being catered to...Drinks - outstanding!  I got something straight of the menu (most amazing Gin and Tonic) which was oddly dark in color but amazingly delicious (bitters added)!  And the virgin refreshment prepared for my pregnant friend made the rest of us alcohol-drinkers jealous.  Bartenders spared no expense in cocktail presentation and execution.  Definitely need to try this place!Great for after dinner cocktails or a place to hang out and wind down with friends.,,,
