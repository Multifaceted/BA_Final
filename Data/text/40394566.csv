Most exhibits are found on the first and second floor, with a basement hosting an interactive display, an academic/conference center, and the two restrooms.Upon entry into this place, I was handed a pen with which I could mark my favorite artwork. I didn't do so, but I'm assuming this would help you buy prints/replicas of your favorite work.I took my time exploring the first and second floors. I found the exhibits appealing, since they portray and modern/minimalist style. I liked some of their interactive displays, or which there was an acoustic display on the second floor, and a visual one in the basement area. Other exhibits that caught my eye include: woodwork, elegant furniture layouts, paintings that change with differing colored lighting, and an old staircase with a chandelier that sits near the front entrance to the museum.There is a cafe on the premises, and a ""garden,"" or veranda. All in all, it was a nice place to visit.",20,12,22

They try to make their exhibits very interactive and fun. Even kids will enjoy them. Their latest exhibit incorporates the senses. They invite visitors to touch, smell, and hear the displays. I highly recommend it! Tickets are discounted for seniors and student and there is a $2 discount if you order online. Admission is free for people under 18. There is also pay-as-you-wish admission on Saturday evenings from 6pm to closing at 9pm.",2,2,3
2,Katherine P.,"Stamford, CT",157,1168,1107,5.0,9/19/2018,"This was one of the best accidental museum discoveries I've had. I'd had this museum on our list of places to go when we are with friends in NYC, and one of our friend had wanted to go to the Guggenheim. We'd finished pretty quickly in that museum, so I cast around to see if there was something nearby.""Oh look, the Cooper Hewitt is near, let's go!"" I say. So glad we did! Now, I used to live near DC, so I had experience with Smithsonian museums. This one keeps up that same high quality. They have a good website, and although the layout of the museum is a little confusing, we ended up having a great time.They had an exhibit on Access + Ability, which was the design about things like prosthetics and wheelchairs. Thinking about the designs of those objects (as well as other seemingly mundane objects) was very cool. They expand that whole idea of access into the rest of the museum, helping to make it so that their exhibits are accessible to all.Another exhibition, about design for all of the senses, was really incredible. There were many interactive objects in this area, from scented hand sanitizer, to strange curtains to touch, and various kinds of sonic experiences.  It was one of the more fun experiences that I've had in a while.If you enjoy a real hands-on type of museum experience, this is definitely a place for you.The excellent extended to the cafe and the store. There aren't many museum stores where you can buy an actual item that's also part of the collection.Overall, this is so far one of the best museums I've been to in NYC so far.",2,,2

The gardens are instagram-able, the art work is very pop-culture and so different than any of the other museums in that row. It was a nice relaxed addition to our NYC visit. I was pleased to see that many of the patrons were local New Yorkers, not tourtistas like us. The cafe was such a lovely place to sit and relax but their menu was pretty minimal, we took a pass. I'm spoiled by the huge cafeteria at the Getty Center in LA.",1,1,1
4,Scott L.,"New York, NY",5000,2295,4005,4.0,5/21/2018,"Yeah This used to be Andrew Carnagies home.   I historical factor that's significantly underplayed. As a matter of fact the museum itself is misplaced here, a fluffy display of neons, graphic posters and mindless interactive activities on the level of a 4 year old. (Programming as described in Fahrenheit 451 came to mind.)The house itself is absolutely stunning and the walls have been left mostly intact.  There is a wonderful patio out back on the lawn that is the second best thing about this place. (The first being the history.""There is a small interactive display that shows the layout of the house when it was lived in and with a few pictures. The cafe is open to the public so I'd plug that in with a visit to the MET, the Frick, the neue gallerie and\or the Jewish museum.  Then you could pop into the lobby and just get a glance of this mansion from the inside, and skip the cover charge. Breakdown The building and its history - 5 stars The design museum - 2 stars (Boring but maybe not my deal.)The cafe - 5 stars - spend a couple of hours out there in the morning when the weathers nice.   Avoid lunch as it was slammed when I went for a refill.",5,2,6
5,Cynthia Z.,"Manhattan, NY",166,155,1847,4.0,4/1/2018,"Formerly a mansion of Andrew Carnegie's, this 64-room, 3 story building is impressive in its architectural details. This design museum houses a scattershot of items from jewelry, pottery, electric sound effects, art, retro items, furniture, sculptures, interactive process lab, etc. It doesn't seem as comprehensive as the major arts & design museums like MOMA and the Met, although I would say this is definitely one of a ""must visit"" museums for artists and designers.  Nevertheless, I found the exhibit on the medical technologies quite impressive and the jewelry exhibit quite interesting. The highlight of our visit was probably the 3D object designs.  Admission is $18 for general admission, $9 for students, $12 for seniors, and is free on Saturdays. Everyone gets a large stylus pen to save objects with and to use it on interactive screens throughout the museum.",4,3,4

A couple are a bit rude and impatient especially when they see any kids but I guess they have their own reason and experience with that. Other wise most staffs are very friendly and polite. 3 floods, the 4th is only for staffs. They have a garden too and it's pretty nice, cute gift shop too. Love the recent exhibits, it's high tech, modern, unique and creative. If you like something different then thing might get closer to blowing your mind.",,,

I didn't really know what to expect but be sure, when you're checking in to get the wand. This allows you to scan items as you visit different areas of the museum and then you can go online after your visit and be reminded of what you learned during your visit. Really cool.  Anyway, we learned a lot about colors. And textures. And smells. We also learned a great deal about different inventions that help those who can't hear or see.  It really was an afternoon full of learning and total enjoyment. It was $18 for admission. I would highly recommend this museum while in NYC. You won't be sorry. Be prepared to learn and broaden your horizons. And take time to design your own wallpaper. It's a blast.",1,,1

11,Marjorie S.,"Enfield, CT",68,111,3,5.0,6/13/2018,"We weren't completely sure about paying $30 to visit this design museum, but no worriess, well worth it. First of all, admission includes a digital ""pen"" that allows you to tap the exhibit, and then access it after you return home with a digital key. This is truly interactive and engaging.Each floor of the design museum is dedicated to a theme: First floor was about ""access and ability"" which featured designs to assist people with disabilities--like low vision, mobility issues, hearing loss--and certainly inspired and gave hope to us who are aging. Second floor was called Immersion, and had a lot of interactive exhibits where we could play and discover.Floor two was even more interactive, called Immersion, and presented many exhibits of color and design that allowed for personal interactin.Floor three, for us, included the guided tour, where Hunter gave our five senses exciting opportunities to experience exhibits that engaged our sense of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. Hunter was a brilliant guide, who allowed for questions and gave us a lot ot think about.This is a great family excursion, and also fun for couples. Interaction is the main idea.Show less",1,1,1

15,Jess L.,"Berkeley, CA",618,111,76,5.0,12/28/2017,"A great great museum. (I'm probably biased because I'm a designer, but I also do believe that the stuff here appeals to a lot of different audiences!!) I've been here twice in the last year and got to experience two entirely different sets of exhibits, all of which were interactive and showcased some really cool work- including celebrity curated exhibits, an interactive process lab, non traditional textiles, political engagement, accessibility, design in the digital age, and an immersive digital wallpaper room. Every person gets this cool stylus/pen thing to save objects with, as well as interact with different screens throughout the museum that let you draw, design 3D objects, and find new pieces to learn about. Sometimes I wonder if they're sanitized after each use, but I think it's probably fine lol. The museum is held in the beautiful Carnegie mansion and it's really cool to see how modern designed objects contrast against the ornate, older architecture of the building.One last thing- the basement of the building walks through the process of putting the museum together (building galleries, branding/visual identity, building display cases, designing the stylus pen things, etc.) and I love seeing the behind the scenes work of the museum. The gift shop is super pricey and the cafe is as well, but not a huge problem. Still a great museum.",,,

The building is the former mansion of Andrew Carnegie, it is a beautiful space. The exhibits are on three floors and a beautiful old staircase can be used to get you to the exhibits. They also have an elevator.They have an eclectic mix of art and sculpture and furniture. There are also some Lewis Tiffany lamps and art objects.  One of the exhibits when I was there featured old radios and ""portable"" music devices. My favorite was the portable combination radio / phonograph, see my photos.There was also an exhibit of staircase models showing the different designs used through the ages. Other elements of design are on exhibit and are too numerous to list here.We were able to take advantage of the free museums Saturday that was offered by the Smithsonian.

It's not enormous but it is fun indeed. Def recommended to other friends to go check it out. I really enjoyed the stylus pen which you can use to save your work or favorite works of art/ installations/ etc. We had a great time overall and the garden is beautiful! I would rate it 5 stars BUT the young lady at the front desk was rude in a snarky way and not helpful. Since we had never been to the museum, I asked ""where do we start?"" And with a clear attitude she responded ""anywhere?"" And gave us a look, meanwhile there's about 5 different doors. Rude.",,,1

With an entrance on 91st street, the lawn area is open during open hours of the museum and is the perfect place to spend a morning/afternoon/Friday night (okay any time they are open). This summer they have colorful sculpture-like seating that is fun for kids and adults alike. There is also a ping pong table in the back of the lawn open for use. If you get hungry, there is a high-end cafe right inside he museum selling delicious fresh juices, freshly made paninis, and for the summer months, gelato. This place is so preferable to Central Park since it's cleaner, less crowded, and within walking distance of food, indoors if needed. A perfect summer spot.",,,
21,Wilson B.,"Suitland-Silver Hill, MD",155,405,510,5.0,8/16/2017,"The Jazz Age exhibit is closing on 20 August 2017!I made the trip from D.C. to N.Y. especially to catch the Jazz Age: American Style in the 1920s.  Coming from the Smithsonian town of D.C., I had never heard of Cooper-Hewitt so this visit was  going to be a new experience for me.As someone who knows the Smithsonian system in D.C., I was surprised that there is an entrance fee for the Cooper Hewitt.  Surprised but I kept me moving knowing that I was spoiled yet again by living in the Nation's Capital.  Situated in Andrew Carnegie's former home overlooking Central Park. As someone that loves to visit the former residences of historical figures I enjoyed this.  There is a great virtual tour with pictures of the palatial home during Carnegie's day that you can take.  I liked doing this because of the pictures and the factoids.Now back to the Jazz Age exhibit....I loved it!  I think it is well worth a trip to go to New York before it closes, an excuse to come to Manhattan, whatever.  The exhibit was detailed, informative and striking.  Art Deco is my favorite style of design.  I feel like saying architecture is not enough.  Living in D.C. I love the sites going up Georgia Avenue, Silver Spring and Hyattsville in Maryland.  Seeing this exhibition I now view Art Deco as more of a lifestyle movement as opposed to architecture and graphic designs.  Seeing all of the housewares, clothing and furniture; I never knew that the Barcelona chair was an Art Deco design.  I thought I was hip but I had a lot to learn and learned a lot.So I would try my best to make it before this exhibit closes.  There is a wonderful Digital Pen system for further research, that staff can explain to you which I didn't utilize. My fault.  Esperza Spaulding has section that she curated which is a nice lil element to a progressive exhibition.",,,
22,Klaudia J.,"Queens, NY",4,41,93,5.0,8/2/2017,"I visited this museum around noon on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded at all. My friend and I paid $9 each for student admission. Upon entry, every visitor receives a pen, which allows you to save exhibits that you like online, as well as draw on their interactive tables. The ticket has a code on it, which allows you to access your saved exhibits and drawings on their website. It's an amazing concept and it discourages patrons from standing around with a camera trying to get a picture. My friend and I actually both forget to get pictures of most of our favorite exhibits.The space itself looks amazing. It has 3 floors if I remember correctly and many interesting exhibits. They had one for radios, staircases, cigarette boxes, many furniture displays, and the list continues. There were so many beautiful and interesting pieces. There was also the immersion room, which allows you to pick/draw whatever design you want and project it onto the wall. Unfortunately, some people do not follow the 5-minute rule for the room and leave you waiting. However, once a worker realized how long we were waiting she kindly asked the group to finish up so we could experience the room. The whole museum was a great experience and it was right next to Central Park so you can make a day out of it.",,,

I tell her I have a groupon and she takes one look at my phone screen and tells me to redeem it by myself. I figured she isn't familiar with how to do it so fine, I did it. Then she tells me to listen to her colleague behind her explaining how to use the electronic pens they have for whatever purpose. There's no good internet service here so I was waiting for the groupon app to load and the RUDE lady stares at me like I'm wasting her time. The app loads and I show her the redeemed screen. Then she asks if I want the pens and I ask what they're for. She rudely asks ""Weren't you listening to my colleague?"" I tell her I was redeeming my groupon (which is HER job to do in the first place), then hands me a paper with the instructions on how to use the pens and tells me to read it. I glare at her and ask her ""Can't you just explain what they're for?"" I guess I scared her and and she finally decides to do HER JOB and starts explaining it. Oh but wait, her colleague started to explain it to the other customer next to me so she just asks her colleague to do it for her. LAZY and RUDE. I came in at around 12pm on a Sunday August 12. Whoever was Asian and on shift that time and day should be FIRED or other visitors will have to deal with this imbecile. She ruined the entire experience of going around the museum.Also the security guards constantly hover and watch over you like a prisoner and you cannot enjoy the experience at all. There was an exhibit with lights and the explanation says to touch them. I touch them and the guard demands for us not to break them. How were we suppose to know they are breakable without any warnings written on the explanation? Get your sh*t together before treating your visitors like they're idiots. And the guards shouldn't be the ones to explain how displays should be viewed. Hire proper guides if that's what they're going to do. Overall not an enjoyable experience and I'm glad I didn't pay full price. They normally charge $16 per person for this disorganized and lazy establishment, and that is laughable.The only good thing is the building, which is BEAUTIFUL with a lot of history.

You can make your own wall paper, save what you like, make your own virtual case. Pretty creative!I originally would give this place a 4/5, but I was seriously turned off by how rude some of the staff in some of the exhibits were. There was a specific exhibit where there are stickers and cards that you fill out. The instructions were VERY ambiguous (idk if I am just dumb or what), so I was trying my best to enjoy what I saw. I was overdoing one part and the staff said to me in verbatim""Uhh... Do you know what those are even for...?"" Me: ""no not really""Staff: ""*points to a wall with vague instructions with rude gesture*""The whole situation could have been handled in a polite way, but staff chose to be rude.

I'll be frank here, I was a science major in college, and now going into the health sciences for grad school. Thus, my knowledge of modern art (and art as a whole) is rather limited, but I do appreciate art that speaks to me on a deeper level. I'm always curious to learn more about things I don't know about and I really enjoyed MoMA, so I figured why not!The building is GORGEOUS. We were able to walk by the whole building en route to the entrance due to where the subway stop was, but it was a lovely walk and a lovely day so we were able to really appreciate the architecture. The museum is converted from the late Andrew Carnegie's mansion, and the interior was fittingly equally beautiful. We were both students, so admission was $9 each - not bad for Museum Mile in NYC. After paying and getting our stickers, we were handed a stick pen that was to be used to ""save"" things we liked, so that we could revisit later. I thought it was a cool concept, but personally I knew myself and probably would never go back to do so but I went with it.The museum itself was really cool! There were three floors of informative, modern applications that were a little bit abstract (but, isn't modern art supposed to be abstract) - first floor was confusingly interactive? I didn't really know what they wanted viewers to get out of the card-filling, sticker taping room but tried my best. The rest of the floor was fine, nothing stood out in my mind, but the textile patches and things they made out of them were pretty cool. Second floor was more digitally interactive, with the draw-your-own wallpaper exhibit (pretty sweet! But not worth the line, especially one wrapping around the entrance along the wall), the design-& solve real life situations.The stairwells of this museum are worth walking up and down! They had infographics on the rent crisis in NYC and how income matches up with rent in the different buroughs, I thought these were worth looking into and learning about. My favorite part of this whole museum was definitely the sun room, with its plane glass windows/ceiling, heated seating and large pink/red plush cushions!! My friend took a nice nap while I ogled the scenery and the beautiful windows. The only thing I unfortunately took a photo of during the whole museum trip because I used my stick pen thing (which was pretty difficult to use, and only worked half of the time?). The sun room also exited into the store, which actually had some cool items for sale.

You don't even need to print anything out, just be sure to show your order number at the front desk.You'll be enthralled the moment you see this place. It's located on the grounds of a historic house right next to Central Park. From the relaxing garden to the beautiful design of the building, it's all amazing. The exhibits here are great and they really showcase the pinnacle of design. You're sure to be inspired as you stroll through the different exhibits on the multiple floors. Another cool thing is the stylus that you get. You can use it to interact with the screens that are located throughout the museum, as well as to save things for later viewing. Great idea and it keeps things interesting.A must visit for everyone.",,,
34,Tamara H.,"Manhattan, NY",121,353,373,1.0,8/23/2016,"Just returned from a rather unpleasant museum experience. It takes a lot for me to dislike a museum/historical site/garden but here it goes.Everything started off on the right foot at the garden. The garden itself is beautiful, they have ping pong, and colorful designer furniture available for the public to enjoy. The garden is free and you can pick up a snack at the cafe which is open to the public 2 hours prior to museum opening.Unfortunately the pleasantries stopped there. The admission is currently reduced to 5$/pp because only two floors of the museum are available for viewing (1st and 2nd). The exhibits themselves left much to be desired. There were maybe 5-6 rooms in total to see. It hardly seems worth it to go for a few pieces of 70s furniture and a movie on how Pixar drawings are made. The museum space is just too small - I would skip this and go to Guggenheim nearby.What got me the most, however, is the rude staff. I have witnessed people being shushed and yelled at by museum personnel. No smiles at this place. The staff is there to police visitors and rudely remark on everything they do. Just a few things i noticed:1) They have a few labeled EXIT signs that a some people were walking towards. The staff yelled at them rudely waving a finger ""NO"" as if speaking to a child. 2) I saw a mother pointing at an exhibit and showing her child one of the pieces on display. The staff yelled at her ""DON'T TOUCH THE GLASS!"" She wasn't touching the glass.3) They have several drop off stations for interactive pens. If you drop off at one of them, you will be yelled at when exiting the museum and told to ""DROP OFF YOUR PEN"" even if you already have. My advise is to avoid this ""museum"". Enjoy a coffee at the garden for free, save yourself some time and money.",5,1,1

Maybe it was the insane crowds from the Museum Mile or maybe I didn't stop by for the right exhibits, but the Cooper Hewitt just didn't do it for me. 1. Despite the place being packed, I still managed to view all three floors within a half hour. 2. From the reviews I expected a more immersive, interactive experience. The touch screen boards offered a cool way to consume info, but were difficult to navigate without one of their pens. 3. Where's the design thinking? Most of the exhibits focused on the end product, but didn't offer any insight into the process it took to get there.I'll update my review when I get a chance to check out some of their new exhibits!",,,1

37,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,5.0,5/28/2016,"I guess when people talk about NYC museums, the first one comes into their mind could be either metropolitan museum of art, or MOMA. Those are good, however nothing unique. CH definitely caught up my eyes by being exotic!The second you stepped in, you would see a giant clock wall built up by smaller clocks; while each clock represented part of the time. Once you purchased the ticket, the instructor handed you a stick, which could be used to save down your favorite piece of exhibition, or interact with the screen. Well thought! They introduced a variety of creativity, which was absolutely beyond my imagination. (Some examples: wooden stair design, the evolution of typewriters, animation design from Pixel, etc). Worth at least one visit to get your imagination up to speed!The small garden in front of the building was a perfect place for sitting down and relax.",12,8,12
38,Jimmy B.,"Rego Park, NY",16,128,0,4.0,11/19/2017,"The venue itself is breathtaking. I am such a sucker for carved wood paneling and old world luxury. Came for the Jazz Age exhibit. It's so neat the way they hand you a stylus and explain how technology is incorporated into the viewing experience, allowing you to find out more about the items, displays, artifacts, etc., that most intrigue you after your tour has ended. The 1920s objects procured for the exhibit were wonderfully displayed and fairly diverse -- encompassing furniture, clothing, art, architectural elements and day-to-day living accoutrements. The exhibit makes very clear just how much hobnobbing and vamping were a part of Jazz Age life for those lucky enough to partake in the high culture of the time. More than anything else, the display rooms were replete with gorgeous, geometrical, art deco tea and coffee serving sets, handheld vanity cases and smoking paraphernalia. Was there ever another time when you could be obnoxiously chauvinistic and drunk off your ass most of the day and still come off classy? It was my first visit, but certainly not my last. The venue itself -- regardless of the exhibit du jour -- is enough to get me back there.",,,2

41,Sarah C.,"Rutherford, NJ",88,17,50,4.0,2/17/2017,"My friends and I wanted to go visit the city and have some fun without spending a lot of money (being highschoolers and all). Lucky for us, we were teenagers with excellent taste and came upon the Cooper Hewitt Museum which allowed free admission for students under 18!What can I say? A museum that let's you wave around a giant, interactive pen while being able to save your creations digitally to be viewed back at home is pretty awesome, for a lack of a better word. My friends and I had a blast viewing the exhibits and interacting with literally anything we could find. I think one of the best places (especially Instagram worthy) was this room where you could draw whatever you wanted with the pens, and it projected it onto the screen like your own personalized wallppaper.So why the four stars? Maybe I'm being a bit picky, but it was quite a small exhibit. I have seen a couple of reviews complaining about its expensive admissions price, and I have to agree: this place doesn't give much unless you're coming in for free. With floors the size of measly four classrooms and maybe-if-you're-lucky interesting exhibits, it was a very short experience (nonetheless very cool).Bottom-line, would I come here again? Hell yeah with my friends, taking advantage when I'm still younger than 18. But after that, I'll have to think about it.",2,,2
42,Elisa L.,"Toronto, Canada",381,369,497,3.0,4/24/2017,"Exhibits are very interactive, and they have a cool concept of using a pen that allows you to save any particular pieces that you found interesting and want to look back on after your visit. The pen also allows you to play on the giant tablets. It's definitely not your typical museum.Really beautiful interior architecture and fun rotating chairs, best of all it's not touristy, so you can enjoy the museum in peace. Some of the exhibits have a cool factor, but others are less interesting and somewhat random. Note that I had already visited 2 other museums prior to this, so I was pretty museum'd out.I don't think it's a must see museum, but definitely worth checking out, esp. as they have pay as you wish on Saturdays 6-9pm.",,,

You can design your own wall paper but you have 5 minutes to do so before a security guard is looming over you(note: there was hardly anyone else in this place). Yahoo for 3D printing and who cares about the stylus pen they give you when their interactive designs are boring AF. Skip this place and save yourself $18!

44,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",199,956,810,4.0,4/23/2018,"Cooper Hewitt is my favorite small-ish museum in NYC. Its a beautiful building and awe worthy space, with a beautiful staircase, floors, and atriums. The museum is packed with interactive bits that take this from ""look, don't touch"" to ""what would happen if I do this?"" It is great for ages 10+ to really understand the styluses and the touch screens. My favorite spaces are the top floor, where they tend to showcase one design firms' projects and the basement, which has the bathrooms and a breakout space with the spinny top chairs. This is a good spot to get out the wiggles too. I admire that the curators are very pro-access and highlight social issues. The last time I was here there was an exhibit about how to incorporate better design for people who need accessibility assistance, from better canes to how to cross the street safely. One exhibit is always very kid friendly - the last one I went to was programming a garbage truck with music sounds.",,,
45,Nicole T.,"Clifton, NJ",461,182,944,5.0,3/8/2016,"If the Cooper Hewitt were only a little bigger, this hands down would be my favorite museum ever! I went last Sunday thanks to Bank of America's Museums on Us program (check it out if you have BOA). The current exhibits for March 2016 include Pixar's Story of Animation and the Beauty Collection (5th Installation). Now I don't know about you, but I think Pixar is the bomb (Think Toy Story, Up, Inside Out). It was really cool to see art from the perspective of how it becomes art. This exhibit was in the processing lab. There are four floors and a basement. The actual building itself, even without the artwork, is very cool to examine. The best part of the museum is their Cooper Hewitt pen. Designed and then released in 2015, it makes the museum come to life. For instance, if there is art you like, you can put your pen to the + sign, and it will save the information for you. There are also interactive tables and rooms where you can design your own artwork. Every person gets their own individual code, so when you go back home, you can see all of the pictures and information you saved. You can even add additional notes.I absolutely love the ""Design in the Classroom"" initiative Cooper Hewitt is fostering. As an educator myself, design is a major part of STEAM, and it will only continue to grow in importance in future years.(PS: Current exhibitions are there until August 2016)",4,2,2

48,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,1113,19764,4.0,12/21/2015,"Cooper Hewitt is beautiful. I can't describe it. There are several special exhibits well worth the visit. The mansion itself is fantastic. You have access to three floors all full of exhibits and displays. I really loved the lower level. They have a display of the employees art work. You can't miss it as you go to the cafe, and restroom, downstairs. The employees have created some great pieces. Very talented. ABOUT ADMISSION COST: I screwed up on my first YELP tip! If you buy on-line it is $16.00 for adults! The web site has the correct admission price, sorry. Tickets now cost $18.00 for adults, and Seniors are $12.00 when you buy at the door. You pay $16.00 if you buy on line and $10 for Seniors purchased on line!I can't wait until spring to sit in the garden. They have brand new benches. Free admission to the garden, cafe, and gift shop at all times. They even have a ping pong table in the garden. The place was full of students of all ages today. It is such a big space it did not interfere with my picture taking. I took over 200 shots. So much to see! They do not mind photography just no flash or selfie sticks. Seeing the Carnegie Mansion with all it's ornate detail was my favorite part. Imagine their lifestyle. Chandeliers so beautiful. Wooden carved staircases and door frames. I imagined the craftsmanship that went into the building. It must have taken a lot of time to build. I'm so glad this mansion is preserved. There were a lot of educational activities going on today.

You are given a computerized wand when you buy your ticket that can scan icons at each piece you like so you can keep track and buy prints at the gift shop. The wands also allowed you access different interactive portions of the museum. I went when the ""Beauty in Design"" exhibit was occurring and it was WONDERFUL. There was such a wide variety of different types of ""Beauty"": Extravagant, Intricate, Ethereal, Transgressive, Emergent, Elemental, Transformative. There are several pieces that encompass each category. Each piece is more unique and inspiring than the next. The art is modern in style, and all of it is truly exceptional. There was also a Pixar Design exhibit that was interactive and allowed you to see the creative and design process to create different characters. A great exhibit for kids! My favorite exhibit was the Thom Brown Selects. It was unique, and stark, and amazing, I just loved it. The museum is kept up very well. At one point I tried to sit on a bench and look through a catalog of art on the bench while charging my phone. The guard would not allow me to charge my phone and told me I could only do so in the cafe. So I went down to the cafe, and there were no outlets. In the entire cafe. At all.

One cool feature is THE pen. It's a stylus that lets you interact with the board all around the museum (imagine giant iPads). You can draw and design with this pen AND you get to save any exhibits that interested you. On the bottom of the stylus, there's a scanner that lets you scan the exhibits and save your designs so that you can look back at it later. The main attraction, in my opinion, is the Immersion Room. You get to use one of the interactive boards/table to create a design, then it is projected onto the walls of the room - you can count on some great pictures from this!

Updated review","CH is an indoor playground for both young and elderly citizens. The former Cooper Union's museum used to be a museum for the arts of decoration. That history is shown mostly on the  2nd floor's permanent collection, from wallpaper to furniture. The rest of CH is a showroom for the newest technologies. You will find sketches, blueprints, photographs, and illustrations of a design process, such as 3D printing and Pixar's animation. CH introduced its Pen in 2015. The Pen allows users to draw their own designs on interactive tables in every floor. The flat end of the Pen has a censor that reads NFC tags attached to each museum label. If you like something, put the Pen on the tag. When you have access to the internet, go to cooperhewitt.org/you, then type in the code from your ticket, you will see and even download everything you have liked. Never have I known of such a unique way of storing my museum visit. Since the early 20th century, CH has transformed itself from a decorative arts to a technical arts museum--where anyone can use interactive devices to generate arts and designs.The only downside is that despite having 3 floors, it is a relatively small museum. Expect about 15 minutes for each floor. There is no way you can avoid overexcited children and strollers.",6,1,3
64,Shirley Z.,"Salt Lake City, UT",328,156,692,5.0,6/13/2016,"Very fun and interactive! I give it a 5 star rating because Cooper Hewitt is smaller than most.

Best of all, you're able to save the artwork for yourself, which you can view later on when you enter a code on their website. I had an amazing time here!",1,1,1
65,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,829,135,4.0,8/23/2015,"This is a very nice museum for anyone interested in design. We ended up here by accident since the Guggenheim is closed on Thursdays, but it was a happy accident.One of the nice things about this museum is that it makes great use of technology. Every visitor is given a small wand--one end can be used to ""write"" on interactive stations and the other end permits visitors to ""save"" the things they like to their digital account, which can be accessed from home. Unlike many tech features at other museums, this one worked perfectly as advertised. The museum isn't huge, but it is quite interesting and diverse, covering everything from advertising to posters to textiles to architecture and more. (The exhibits change, so you may see different things.) We spent about 90 minutes there, but we could have spent longer if we'd taken a little more time to let some of the knowledge and information sink in and interact with more of the interactive stations.  I wish it were a little larger, but I felt the price was right for an interesting and educational museum of this sort.",,2,
66,Tim C.,"San Francisco, CA",461,772,503,4.0,6/11/2016,"It's a very interactive museum.It seems like this museum perfectly reflects art from our everyday life. A lot of the exhibits incorporates the museum visitor. You experience and interact with that piece. Many of these somehow involves motion graphics, touch screens and swiping. It's very modernized. I was surprised to find the breakdowns of PIXAR's and Disney's drawing and animation. It's really interesting to see the process of how the artists started it from pen and paper all the way to 3D animation. You can find examples from UP, BRAVE, INSIDE OUT or WALL-E which are all very recent movies.Other art I could find in here were Fashion Design, Furniture Design, Motion 3D Animation, Lights, Typography and some other traditional things.All and all worth the experience and I think especially if you're into one of the above mentioned things I think you should come pay a visit.",1,1,1
67,Alejandro B.,"Arlington, VA",337,383,18,3.0,4/2/2016,"I really had high expectations for this museum, so much so that I actually included it in my NYC bucket list (I'm moving this summer).I found this museum took the Jack of All Trades, Master of None approach (but, unlike Aziz Ansari, it couldn't really pull it off). There's a small section of architectural models, a small section of product design, a small section of Tiffany lamps. It's trying to please everyone, but unlike the Met, it's really not able to do so. The temporary Pixar exhibit only skimmed the surface as to the company's creative process, and unsurprisingly, only occupied just about one large room. My biggest pet peeve with this museum is the high price compared to its small size. The museum has just about 3 floors, meaning you can explore the whole thing in about 1 hour and a half, at most. And yet, admissions for adults is a whopping $18! ($2 discount if you buy online). I was fortunate to have been able to purchase a student discount as I'm in grad school, but I wouldn't pay more than $7 to visit. There's not enough context around the actual museum site, which is Andrew Carnegie's old mansion. The lobby, with a wooden staircase, is stunning, but the museum doesn't preserve much of the interiors on the last floor and you really have no idea which room served which purpose.I was originally skeptical when the museum presented me with a phallic-looking modern pen to use along my visit. I thought it actually enhanced the visit by allowing you to save information and images about specific artifacts you found interesting, which you could then access on your own computer. If I was to contrast this museum with another I truly enjoy, it'd be the Morgan Library in Midtown. While both museums are of a similar size, the Morgan is much more focused as to its exhibits and actually offers historical context as to its location (JP Morgan's former home). It's also much cheaper to visit.",3,,1

It is SO good I am writing this review reluctantly as I want to keep it a secret but I guess so many people come here it's not that big a secret!!!!This is my little bit of heaven in the city! We have spent the day basking in the gorgeous garden of the Cooper Hewitt enjoying the delights from the Cafe. The space is perfect for chatting with friends and any relaxing activity you may indulge in. We saw people reading, sketching, studying and hanging out with friends/family. Anything goes...It is a great space as it is open, clean and there are plenty of shady spots. It is completely enclosed making it a safe spot for toddlers to run around and there is a security guard at the gate for extra security!!  The cafe offers light bites and the lemonade is beautifully refreshing on a hot summers day.

Anyhoo:It's run by the Smithsonian.It's pretty good, all around. Sort of like a mini-Moma with an emphasis on design.It's inside a former Carnegie house.Some of their exhibits are interactive and/or kid friendly.They have a relatively new, cool doodad that looks like a big fat pen that you carry around, so if you want information or photos of the things you see, you just use it to scan the exhibit data with a qr-code type thing at each exhibit. Then, when you get to a computer at home later, you just punch in the museum url with a code they give you when you buy your ticket, that retrieves the data - thus obviating the need for questionably good cell phone photos (which are 100% allowed, minus flash) and note taking.The museum is 3 floors, and not very large, compared to some of its peers.

They are a couple bucks cheaper, which adds up for a group.As for the museum, I do think this is a bit of a gem on the upper end of Museum Mile. Cooper Hewitt provides something that I've never seen before: a pen that saves information on exhibits and is integrated with a code on your ticket. You can save different things and look at them later online---super cool! There was a good variety of items on display as well as large digital tables (probably the Microsoft Surface tables) that you can draw on and interact with. The technology definitely helped bring this museum a star higher for me.During our excursion, we saw a good amount of over their 3 floors. It was nice we were able to leave to grab lunch (at Whole Foods on 88th/3rd) and come back to finish exploring. I would recommend about 2-3 hours to see everything.

85,Edward M.,"Corning, NY",53,936,2937,2.0,9/10/2015,"The Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum (the institution's most recent, and awkward, name) occupies the former Andrew Carnegie Mansion. It was founded in 1897 by the Hewitt sisters, granddaughters of Peter Cooper, and originally affiliated with the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (the East Village college). It has been part of the Smithsonian since 1967. The Cooper Hewitt has two major challenges; one is the (residential) building it awkwardly occupies (and which only reopened after a supposedly major renovation in 2014) and the other is defining and presenting its extensive (and never fully seen) collections of materials from around the world, including books, paintings, works on paper, technology, and just about every sort of object imaginable (for example, the current installation includes a room of wall paper samples as well as the rear end of a London double-decker bus!).The house makes an awkward home for a museum. Now a landmark, much of its rich interior remains on the first two floors, and not infrequently clashes with installations (the bus, for example, is uncomfortably wedged into a grand carved stairwell), and while the most recent reconstruction added third floor exhibit space, it did not satisfactorily resolve these fundamental tensions nor create a comfortable circulation route for visitors. The other tension revolves around mission. The Cooper Hewitt has a mish-mash of installations which provide little historical context for the development of design. Although over the decades it has hosted well executed and received special exhibitions on many topics (for example, Piranesi as designer or the work of Sonia Delaney), it lacks a permanent display to serve as an introduction for those unfamiliar with major trends in design history. Its most recent reconfiguration relies heavily on computer technology, seemingly oblivious to the inevitable obsolescence such installations must experience, of which no one should be more aware than the curators of a design museum! The Cooper Hewitt includes a gift shop and some food service; it also has an interactive area designed for younger visitors. Their popular garden lost yet another season as construction there is still ongoing. They do host a variety of ticketed educational programs. There are elevators, but the building can still be a challenge for anyone to navigate, and especially those with accessibility concerns.",2,,2

The best part of the pens - you can save any work for later and it allows you to look it up on your own using the code on your ticket stub! Pretty cool feature. The student ticket price is low - we paid $7 each with our student IDs. The museum was well organized and easy to get around. This is a three-floor converted mansion.

The garden/cafe was lovely and accessible without admission, which I really appreciate them doing so.As for those who specifically came for viewing the Carnegie Mansion: you won't be seeing a lot of information on the house and history behind it. For my mother, she was slightly disappointed about the lack of attention on the house. The architecture details will correspond with the exhibition along the way, but prepare to observe them with difficulty via dimmed ""museum-approved"" lighting. In a perfect world, my mother would prefer to have two separate tours: one on the house and one on the collection.

(The witty banners announcing the redo--""Like many on Fifth Avenue, I'm having a little work done""--affectionately skewered its Upper East Side neighbors.) I can honestly say that this is one of coolest and most engaging outposts on Museum Mile. It's not the Met (and it's not supposed to be), but you can easily spend half a day exploring here.The mansion (the former home of Andrew Carnegie) is remarkable in itself. Fun facts that I recall from a long-ago tour: The church across the street has no steeple because Mrs. Carnegie didn't want a shadow on her garden; the doorway to Mr. Carnegie's office is unusually low because the industrialist enjoyed watching powerful visitors bow in order to enter; and the couple had the house designed with an early version of air conditioning. Fast forward to the present: The permanent collection is wide-ranging, but the special exhibits are really their bread and butter. Chairs, posters, textiles--you name it, they'll get you right into the nitty-gritty of how design works. And it's hands-on. Upon entry, you're given a device (""the pen"") that can capture images and info from anything on display, which you access online after your visit. The other end of the pen can be used to design and manipulate images from the collection. This is tremendous fun once you get the hang of it, and passing staff members cheerfully offer to help if you look confused. Similarly, there's an ""Immersion Room"" in which visitors see their designs projected on the walls in real time. The redesigned garden is now open to the public after many years of locking everyone out; also improved are the attitudes of the guards, who were once notorious for being the meanest in the neighborhood. The cafe is cute, although the staff there seems to hate everyone. Skip it and head straight for the shop, which is entertaining (and free if you don't have time for a whole museum visit).Ticket prices are high ($18 for adults, but 18 and under are free); get your tickets online for a modest savings or come for free after 6pm on Saturdays.

Boring, Boring!!Such poorly curated exhibitions makes it very difficult to learn anything new.The museum also seems to be aimed at a pretty low educational level - it feels as if it is more of a junky children's interactive museum than  one for adults.A waste of time and money.

A lot has changed over the years, and among the most interesting and innovative changes is the degree of interactivity that they have introduced. When you buy your ticket ($18) they give you an oversized electronic ""pen"" that the clerk explains (perhaps speaking a bit too quickly) you can use to personalise your experience by ""collecting"" your favourite exhibits so that you can retrieve them back home when you log on to their website and input the code on your ticket. The pen also allows you to do something else on electronic panels that are located throughout the museum, though I did not understand what the person was telling me to do with it, and I felt stupid not understanding her, so I decided it wasn't important enough to pursue.The exhibits are interesting and varied, and there is probably something here for everyone. And even if the exhibits are not for you, the mansion that forms the home of the museum is an exhibit unto itself, well worth exploring. Probably my favourite item on display was a wall of 288 clock faces whose hands seemingly move randomly, but then all of a sudden they stop and display, across several dozen of them, the current time (you kinda have to see it to get what I mean).",,,

The Museum was mostly undergoing 'installation mode', but the floors we could access were interesting enough.

I can't remember the prices for tickets, but I believe it's $9 student discount (all CUNY students are free)! I was really surprised and happy about this actually, because I thought I'd be paying $9 (which isn't even that expensive)There are four floors to this museum, basement is where the bathroom is and the infamous spun chairs. The exhibits were alright, maybe I couldn't enjoy it as much because I don't know anything about architecture.

We came to see the 'Pixar: The Design of Story' exhibit and it was informative, interactive, and well-curated. They had a table in the middle for kids (or adults, for that matter) to draw their own characters, starting with a simple shape. There was a nice balance of both visual and audio information. We started on the 3rd floor and worked our way down to the Pixar exhibit on the first floor, but I found just about everything we saw to be of some interest. I also thought it was particularly smart of this museum to hand out styluses to the public, of which you could document any part of the exhibit and save for revisiting online later.",1,,

High ratio of security guards to the value of the exhibit artifacts makes no sense to me. Most guards were fine, but one security guy stood partially blocking entrance to a side gallery and didn't budge an inch when I slid past him sideways. Then a while later when I was talking with my daughter about an exhibit, he decides that we need to move for him to pass by rather than him taking any number of routes around us through the nearly empty space.",4,4,

If you're a student make sure you bring your student ID if you want to drop the price of admission from $18 to $9!  When you purchase your ticket they give you a pen that has a stylus on one end and a scanner button on the other. It allows you to interact with any of the touch screens around the museums and the scanner lets you save any of the exhibit pieces to your collection. The pen is connected to your ticket with a code so you can access your collection long after your visit! A bunch of the  exhibits are interactive and allow you to take on the roll of a designer. My favorites were the immersion room and the spider web looking exhibit (forgot the name of this one). The immersion room allows you to design a wall paper that projects onto the room's walls.

Come to the Copper Hewitt after 1 PM since all the exhibits my friend and I wanted to see were closed early in the morning (when we visited). Also, if you're into furniture and designing logos, this is the place for you. The gift shop is filled with crazy expensive things - I couldn't even look at the cute pins they had without cringing at the not so cute price tag.

It certainly cannot be left out!The building is a fabulous bit of history and a masterpiece of architecture and interior design- I Really wish they did tours of the portions that are not being used to display the temporary exhibits since it's quite massive and my fevered brain can only imagine it's fantastic, or could be. I too went for the Van Cleef & Arpels exhibit [and eagerly await the place being eventually reopened... one hopes soon] and was utterly overwhelmed by the displays. What marred my delight was the frankly unpleasant security guards who felt compelled to hiss at everyone and hustle you through the place at -top- speed which is entirely unacceptable in a museum, even if it -is- a busy day and the viewers have the good luck to have come on the day admission was free.

128,Ellen W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,3/5/2015,"The Cooper Hewitt is an incredible newly re-opened museum in the Carnegie family's historic residence. I went this past weekend with my mom and had such a fun time. I loved that the collection was a combination of old and new pieces all threaded together by a common design element. I could have spent all day reading every sign and playing with all of the interactive elements. Some of my favorites were the Immersion Room (where you can project collection wall decor or something of your own creative design onto the walls of the room), the other interactive tables that allowed you to drag and drop objects of interest and read about them, the miniature wooden staircases, and the Carnegie library.The only downside to the museum is the price... $18 per adult. Confusing since it is a Smithsonian, why isn't it free?? I was lucky to be treated, but would definitely go back on the pay as you wish nights on Saturdays.",1,,
129,Katie C.,"Flatiron, Manhattan, NY",6,27,17,4.0,2/7/2016,"I adored this museum, mostly because it's extremely interactive. They give you a pen when you pay that is linked to a code that's on your ticket number and as you go around the museum you use your own to register the things that you really like. When you go home you can get online and look at all the things that you registered to your pen in the museum. Taking pictures is ENCOURAGED which is basically unheard of in a museum, which I think made it more fun. People were laughing and talking because they were enjoying all the fun things around the museum. I also thought it was super cool that it was in Andrew Carnegie's mansion. The Pixar exhibit is so cool! There are a bunch of things for you to read and draw on and create your own image or character based on your imagination. I had a wonderful time creating characters from lines and shapes and such. I played a game with my friends where we all drew a squiggly line all over the page and then passed it on to someone else, and everyone had to try to make a character based on the original abstract line. Basically the entire museum is trying to foster individual inspiration and how different pieces make you think different things. On the bottom floor is also a room with a bunch of cool chairs that aren't supposed to tip over. They are really fun to hang out and literally roll around in. They also are outside on the terrace and are definitely worth checking out on a sunny day in the spring or fall!  The only thing I didn't like is the price. It is always $18 dollars (except Saturday's from 6-9pm when it is donation based) which I think is high except from now until 2/12 it is $5 per person because they are setting up new exhibits. It was really fun. Definitely a fun date spot!",1,,

I visited about a year ago for Museum Mile Festival, when all of the museums along Museum Mile are free from 6-9 PM this one day in the summer. My first choice for this festival was Cooper Hewitt because it is one of the few Museum Mile museums that does not ever have free/pay as you wish hours. It's also a beautiful museum housed in the former mansion of Andrew Carnegie. Much of the structure is still original, like the staircase and lobby. I saw an exhibit on Van Cleef & Arpels jewels while I was there, which is what all the other people were there for and it was amazing and comprehensive. The upstairs exhibits were not as interesting and I can only remember some blueprints and designs on fabric. Overall, it was a well-organized and extensive museum.

It defines how design process works and stimulates creativity. The top floors curate other exhibitions that are interesting; especially the digital tables which let people to 'design' furniture, buildings, and even propose creative ideas.

You can also enjoy some unique experiences like the Immersion Room. Don't hesitate to bring children because they will have fun too.As for architecture lovers, it's a must. The Mansion was Andrew Carnegie's property and a landmark in Carnegie Hill. The garden is also quite unique in the neighborhood.

They have a downstairs where you can spin around in these chairs that are pointed. Kids 18 younger are free. Adults is expensive $18 but basically worth it cause kids are free.

The museum has introduced these pens, which when you point them at the exhibit item labels, will save information about the item to a web page that you can visit after you get home. Signing out at the end of your visit creates the web page which you can study if you are a design enthusiast.At first I found the pens slightly confusing to use (the pointed end is for interactive tablets and the other end is used to save information), but the staff are friendly and helpful.

The interior is so beautiful, and it is an interesting contrast to a lot of the modern design on display. It is a small museum and there are lots of varied displays. The interactive displays in the Process Lab are quite fun, and the wooden staircase models (designed in the compagnonnage tradition, which I had never heard of) were fantastic.

Worse, there were a number of security guards there who take their jobs very seriously.  As soon as I took one interior photo (see bamboo photo), I was immediately chastised and informed that no pictures are allowed inside.  Really?  If your innovative idea is being showcased in a museum, chances are people have already heard about it, and I doubt my flashless photo had an effect on the bamboo.  In another room, a lady was chastised for having her hand on a display case.  Not one of the objects on display, but rather a transparent case holding one of the objects on display.  That seemed extreme to me.  Oh well, I saw all that I needed to see.  Having more time left over in my day than expected, I sensibly walked over to the Met and had a grand time.",5,1,

And the year is c 1900 (but you're still wearing your H&M sundress... we won't take this TOO far). This is how it is to enter the museum. Granted, it's a bit dark and chilly inside, so after you make your way through whichever exhibition(s) you've come to see (we'll get to those shortly), take a walk out back in the garden. Feel the sun on your face. Take a break from noise. Read a book, or just sit and flower-watch. The exhibitions, though, as promised. On my last visit, I went to see Design for a Living World and Fashioning Felt. Both exceeded my expectations. Just... go. Make it snappy for the Felt -- it'll be gone in a week. Be sure to enter the Yurt and sit down for a while. Take some more time with the Living World, which is there though January '10. Organized with The Nature Conservancy, this exhibition is accessible, beautiful, and smart. The wall texts and videos are fascinating -- not your standard or obvious fare. Now is the time in my review when I request Christmas presents: a few of Christien Meindertsma's sheep's wool tiles, and a Micronesian vegetable ivory bracelet by Ted Muehling.But back to the Coop. I suppose different people have different expectations of what a museum experience should be. Maybe you like to spend a whole day immersed in a broad survey of art and history. Or maybe that would overwhelm you, and you'd prefer to focus for just a few hours on one or two thoughtfully presented exhibitions, then get back outside for a walk in the park and a leisurely digestion of what you've just seen. The $15 it costs to do the latter at the Cooper-Hewitt is well worth it. Well, well, well worth it.",9,9,12

Ipod touch definitely ""made"" the exhibit, had they not had that, you'd be in and out in half an hour easily.  They have a petite cafe and gift shop (kinda expensive) but definitely an interesting browse.  I'd definitely go back again if they brought another interesting exhibit.",,,1

(on display through January 9, 2011).  Each piece drew me in with its innovative (or just plain cool) design.  There's so much to take in with every ""artifact"" for the ""how it works"" or ""form follows function"" mind, this place is a colorful, vibrant, wonderland that could take hours despite its size.Besides just containing fancy curves and shiny objects (because, after all, I'm a dude), the exhibition tells what the function of these modern gadgets, gizmos, doohickeys, and flibbledefloo are.  And they're mostly for good causes.  From third-world used and first-world designed water purifiers to the most modern flak jacket, I felt like I was being given a sneak peek into what we'll all be using in a few years.Be warned though, the guards protect these ""secrets"" very carefully.  True story.  One of the designs featured was Twitter.  The museum invites patrons to post a Twitter message that then instantly shows on the computer screen that is part of the display.  I took a photo of said screen in order to post it on Twitter and was scolded by the guard.  I guess in all the modernity, he didn't really appreciate the post-modern nature of my exercise.  These constant eyes upon the visitor make the museum feel a little less intimate than the (flashless) photo free-for-all of Washington D.C.Also, unfortunately, also unlike its counterparts in Washington, there is a price to see the future that you don't pay to see the past - $15.00.  Being used to the free museums of the capital city, I wasn't really prepared to pay walking in.  Luckily, I didn't have to since I stumbled upon this museum on one of its free days.  There are really only a few exhibits open besides their rotating one but it appears they're in the process of expanding the display space by 60%.  This place should be fantastic once that's done based on the small portion of the collection that is displayed so far.But I still don't feel like it will totally feel like a Smithsonian.  And, you know what, that's okay by me.",4,1,3

I remember when they housed the exhibit on the design of the new world trade center and the high line which are now happening and I thought it would be so far out into the future! There was another exhibit I went to in 07' that really stood out in my mind called Design for the other 90% and it detailed how simple things such as clean drinking water could be made possible by new designs such as the ""life straw"" which was like a tiny version of a brita filter which would make it possible to drink water without worrying about disease etc. The exhibits really appeals to the future of design and I would recommend this place to anyone!Plus you can't help but feel like you are back in the turn of the century living the good life when you walk around!!",,,

The most current exhibit, ""Why Design Now? - National Design Triennial"" is the fourth installment of the series over the last ten years. It's really about how design focuses on solving today's most urgent problems. It's broken down into eight categories - energy, mobility, community, materials, prosperity, health, communication and simplicity. Covering 134 projects it left me deep in thought about the role of design in contemporary society.C-H is an intimate space and the perfect size for a couple of hours of perusal.

You just won't know it even exists.Despite being part of the Smithsonian Institution, the Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum does a fantastic part of not advertising itself. Had I not been brought here back in 2003 as part of a course, I never would have known about it. I recently re-visited the museum again today, and I wasn't all too impressed.The museum is located in a stately old mansion on 5th Avenue overlooking Central Park. That being said, it's small. Very small. Even if you're a serious museum-goer, you'll still find yourself making your way through the place in under an hour. There really isn't that much there.The exhibit that we saw is called ""Design for a Living World."" This was fun and interesting - for about 10 minutes. It's not that we weren't interested, or just dense when it comes to matters of art and design. It's just that this exhibit really didn't do it for us. There just wasn't much there to see. We felt gipped, in a sense.My girlfriend and I paid $10 a piece for discounted admission with our student IDs. We tried hard, honestly. But we just didn't feel like we got our money's worth. After an hour, we were looking at each other with one of those ""That's it?"" expressions.I guess you can't really fault the museum itself, you can only critique the exhibits. However, I think my girlfriend said it best - ""It just doesn't live up to the Smithsonian name,""Overall, this is a place to go to ONLY IF you're interested in the current exhibit.

But I'm not so I won't.The GED security guards are many times more insightful than the PhD curators. I ask them which is their favorite. After spending hours and hours of days and months in these rooms, they see things we don't see by strolling through and reading the captions. They see it. I took one of the guard's advice and took some time with a piece I barely paid attention to. It's absolutely amazing. I take a few steps back and it's another mood, step back again and it develops even more. I stand in the doorways, in the security guard positions and look back at the painting. Absolutely beautiful. I can spend hours and days like this.More paintings than I thought it would be, being a design museum. While I prefer design in 3 dimensions, most had thorough explanations and backstories in the captions, so I did get some perspective after all. One of my favorite pieces was the bouquet of flowers made out of shells. I looked around that thing for about 10 minutes, finding ""oh cool""s and ""oh man""s every 30 seconds. Of the paintings, I find I prefer the ones of rooms of unknown artists to those of kings and queens. Maybe because I don't bother with what is unattainable. Maybe because it irks me to show so much admiration to the riches lounging while their not forgotten but neglected were dying. On a positive note, with the proliferation of laptops and elimination of ugly desktops, rooms are now back to that timelessness of the 1800's. It seems that for 200 years, styles seemed to be consistent. I mean, what could change really? Tables, chairs, rugs. One difference is the amount of paintings of their ancestors on the walls. At this turn of the century, it seems most people delegate their relatives to a table or a ledge with nothing bigger than an 8x10. Is it the cost which prohibits? Or were they more family oriented in the past? Or is the ability now to shrink our memories and past into a pocket sizes more desirable?

However, when I left the museum I felt as if I had been involved in some scam. Allow me to explain:We entered the museum and went to the admissions counter to find the secretary typing away on her phone, after five seconds she realized we were standing there. We were told the entrance fee is $15, a price I felt was a bit high for any federally-sponsored museum. Nevertheless, I was willing to pay.After paying, we were given our stickers and left to wander without direction, which we did. The first exhibition we came onto was the current exhibition on felt, yes, felt. It was fine, but nothing more. There were a few nice rugs to look at and that's about it. It was small and uneventful.After that, we aimlessly wandered upstairs to find the remainder of the museum space dedicated to eco-design. The eco-exhibition featured artists and innovators who use sustainable products in their work...or something. While I'm a proponent of sustainable design, I don't care to pay $15 to see an exhibit on a topic that, as an American, I am inundated with on a daily basis. Wandering throughout this eco-exhibit made me feel like I was at a benefit for the Save the Rainforest.A bamboo settee? Great, maybe Ikea will come out with a line of them. A kuava nut necklace? Yes, I think I bought one at a flea market.The exhibit could have had been slightly redeemable had the curation been more thoughtful.

From the grandiose staircase (where you'd imagine you were a character in one of Edith Wharton's novels), to the intricate wood carvings & gorgeous wood panelings. Back garden area is worth a stroll through in the warmer months. Pros: -CH goes against the trends--trust them to have unique exhibits you can't find anywhere else in the city.  More recently went to the ""Children's Stories & Wallpaper"" exhibit which was wonderful.  The modern arch study next door on ""Tulou/Affordable Housing for China"" was pretty interesting. They have a model unit inside so you can see what the interior of the apartments are like. -enjoyed their ongoing exhibits as well-- first floor showcase everything from arts/craft & fine china, to a unique chair collection ranging from the bizarre to modern.  I loved the little pieces of jewelry.........and so on..Cons:  exhibits seem a bit incohesive, explanations sparse, it's a you-make-what you will of it interpretation.  Tips:  Go here for an intimate museum experience.  Make sure to look up current exhibits beforehand as the museum usually only presents about 2-3 max at a time.  Go here if:- you have a particular exhibit you want to see- you want to make a quick trip & do not want to spend all day in a museum- you are you curious to visit New York mansions from the robber-baron era.NOTE ON ""FREE MUSEUM ADMISSION"" (as advertised by the website).On my most recent visit, I also received the same rude welcome as Joanne B. below.  Upon entry, we proceeded to the exhibits and were stopped by a rather arrogant prompt ""..and your tickets?"".  The website attempts to lure visitors in by falsely advertising free admission from ""Dec. to Jan.

186,Jennifer H.,"Los Angeles, CA",19,456,13,5.0,10/26/2006,"The polished wood panels gives this museum an unique look, especially when there are contemporary items on display.I didn't buy anything, but the museum store is an exhibit itself.  Full of ideas and one-of-a-kind items.Inspiring, and isn't that why we go to museums?",2,,
187,Joseph N.,"New York, NY",26,141,8,5.0,2/23/2011,"The museum is currently having a very entertaining Van Cleef & Arpels exhibition. Where else in the world can you see women from all walks of life, act like a 3 month old baby drooling over great gems inside the old Carnegie mansion? The VCA jewelry designs are very exquisitely done. Parts of the museum are in renovation and access is available only to the VCA exhibit and the design shop.",1,,
188,Faffy L.,"San Francisco, CA",188,303,65,5.0,7/1/2006,"The Cooper-Hewitt knows how to curate the best exhibitions. Never over the top, and always well executed. It's one museum that makes you feel like the curators actually pay attention to the museum experience. Fashion in Colors, Extreme Textiles, etc, the exhibits are always easy to follow, specimens are well lit, and are thoughtfully labeled. I was so impressed after seeing Extreme Textiles, I bought a membership. And that's cool because they have a lot of design events that are members only and an invitation to their annual Garden Party. Which I missed because I lost track of the date! Damn.They also have a great giftshop with a kickin' selection of design books (graphics, fashion, typography, industrial, etc.) from all over the world. I like doing my Christmas shopping here, too!",1,,1
189,tania t.,"Los Angeles, CA",43,178,22,4.0,3/3/2008,"I really had wanted to see the Design for the other 90% exhibit from about a year ago, but alas, never got a chance until this past weekend to stop by the Cooper-Hewitt.What a miss!Only two galleries were open while the rest of the place was undergoing an upcoming installation, but I have to admit the two open galleries were a bit ho-hum. Sample books from recent and not-so-recent history were minorly interesting if not a bit banal, except for the buttons. Oh the buttons! Those were pretty cool and intricate. The Campana Brothers selections from the permanent collection were varied and somewhat intriguing, but I think I was grasping for something to make the subway ride and $7 reduced admission worth it. There was that red rope chair that I wanted to climb into and feel but I was thwarted by the ""DO NOT TOUCH"" sign. Sheesh, isn't that sort of obvious in a museum? Enjoyed the Japanese stencils gingerly held together with human hair. Amazing technical skills there!Had fun but spent a good amount of time in the gift shop ogling the book on the Design for the other 90% exhibit. Full of regret for missing that one. (Does anyone know where it went?)Still, I cannot give less than four stars for a museum. I value museums too much in general for that.",1,,1

192,Samantha S.,"Howard Beach, NY",2,118,28,3.0,6/12/2009,"Nice museum.  Lovely to see how the rich lived not too long ago (and still live today) with the architecture and ceilings, etc of this beautiful building. The musuem was much smaller than I expected it to be.  It seemed like my trip was over relatively quickly.  Not sure what is locked away in all of the hidden spaces that the general population does not have access to.  Just kind of suprised.They have a basement - a small space where I saw a Google exhibit that showcased a kids contest.  The first floor is the largest - but was still pretty small compared to other musuems.  The second floor is small too.  The exhibit was cool and laid out well though.The gift shop is pretty much a joke.  Unless you want to drop a few hundred dollars I wouldn't even bother.  Even if I was loaded I would maybe have purchased two items.  You may want to pay a visit, though just to pretend that you are still looking at musuem pieces because that is how it is laid out.  It will make the total musuem seem bigger - if nothing else. : - )  For the usual admission price of $15 - probably not worth the trip - unless there is a particular exhibit that you really want to see.  But I went for free - so I think it was worth it. : - )",,,

195,Megan K.,"San Francisco, CA",23,180,7,5.0,1/19/2007,"Perfectly sized museum to keep your attention, and allow you to see all the exhibits in one trip.  There is something strangely fantastic about the juxtaposition of new design against the backdrop of an old mansion.There is currently a National Design Triennial up through July 07 that I would strongly recommend that features a significant number of concise and informative displays highlighting important achievements and innovations in architecture, animation, science, fashion, graphic and industrial design over the last three years.",,,
196,Lisa M.,"Chicago, IL",0,20,0,2.0,12/12/2009,"This place is waaaaaaay overpriced for what it is. My husband and I are museum lovers, and definitely lovers of design and architecture but this place really didn't do anything for either of us. We went with the expectation of spending an afternoon in the museum and were done in 45 minutes...I'm not kidding, 45 minutes, including 1 bathroom break. It's $12.50 per person to look at I-Pods, Patagonia jackets and the Aeron chair jackets with 40-word blurbs written about each thing. Considering the fact that I own all of the mentioned items and could have probably come up with more interesting descriptions for each I was not impressed. I wouldn't waste my money on this one, if you get a free pass or something and have other plans in that area by all means take advantage but do not seek this place out, you'll definitely be disappointed.",2,,
197,David X.,"New York, NY",10,121,0,3.0,7/21/2007,"The museum was ok.  We went to see the ""Design for the other 90%"" exhibit about interesting design ideas for developing countries.  The exhibit was interesting and the things exhibited there no doubt make a huge impact on people's lives, but the actual exhibits themselves were not that great.  It would've been nice to have more videos showing these items in action, and more descriptive captions detailing the history and use of the devices.The rest the museum was more of your normal run-of-the-mill thing.  It's good for architecture buffs because there are lots of things about the intersection of design and architecture.  The rest was kind of a blur and not so memorable.",,,
