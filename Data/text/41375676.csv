0,Taylor C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,8,0.0,5.0,11/18/2018,I chose this place after reading multiple reviews and was not disappointed. This was my first experience with Middle Eastern (Lebanese specifically) cuisine. Everything was super fresh and tasted delicious. Be sure to take advantage of the mocktail list and never stop asking for more pita bread.,,,
1,Omar K.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",68,1,0.0,3.0,11/17/2018,"Waiting time was not accurate, but everything else was great. Our reservation was at 9:15 but we were seated at 9:45. The food was also delayed. However, the service was great and we were given a complimentary dessert. The food was delicious and served very nicely. We had several waiters helping us. They were very nice and professional.Though the start of the night was not great because of the delayed seating and food. They made up for it with their tasty food and excellent service.",,,
2,Patricia L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,36,1,4.0,11/7/2018,"I love this restaurant. It is small and so you feel a lil cramped but for this food, id make the sacrifice.I will point out tho that we got there on time for our reservation (we were pressured to be there on time) and our table was not ready. The hostess did not want to let us inside (perhaps due to limited space) so we were stuck outside on the sidewalk in the cold for about 15 mnts (hence why i knocked 1 star off).The food however is amazing, the kibbeh was to die for, the labneh was good and even their sauces (garlic, aioli, etc) were delicious.For main course, we had the chicken shawarma set for the table and it was delectable, so tender and juicy, im still salivating.The chicken was nesting on a bed of spicy crispy fries, so so good.The portion for the shawarma is really big, too big i think for 2 people so you are better off sharing with a larger group, especially if ordering the yummy appetizers.Side note: the heat from the shawarma grill is pretty intense, so something to think about...We were recommended good wine and service was friendly and efficient.We asked for a doggy bag and brought it for friends of ours that were arriving later that night. They absolutely loved it which is a testament to the quality of the food (it is loved even when cold)Will definetely go back",,,
3,Alicia C.,"Brooklyn, NY",160,281,840,3.0,9/25/2018,"2 1/2 stars. We came for a friend's birthday dinner and finally got the try the sharwanas. We ordered the chicken and the lamb as well as a dip combo. The dip combo was a combination of six different hummus, eggplant dips and baba ganoush. The 3 hummus were really good but the eggplants no so much. They gave us 2 small baskets of pita for that many portion of dips. We asked twice for more pita. The chicken sharwana was very well seasoned and the chicken was cooked well. The lamb was very dry. Both of them comes with a mountain of seasoned fries, a tomato and a onion. Chicken was $58, which is a pretty good price, lamb was $78. Good for at least 4 people each. Service was no bad but i have to admit it could've been better.",3,1,1
4,Tony L.,"Brooklyn, NY",621,344,587,4.0,10/31/2018,"I had see a video about this restaurant's ""Create your own Shawarma tower"" on my feed, and was eager to try it out. After a student from the Middle-East (Qatar/Dubai) gave it two thumbs up, I decided to make a reservation for my partner's birthday on a dreary Saturday night.Although they had the table ready for us at 7, I got there 3 minutes late and so we had to wait. I respected that they were so nitty gritty with their timing - necessary because this place was PACKED the entire time we were there. Without a reservation, you would not be seated.The restaurant does a lot for such a small area - seating accommodating up to 8 people at a time, with a nice specialty booth and a bar area in the back.While not on the menu, we came for the shawarma tower and that's exactly what we got - for $58 you can get the chicken, or for $72 you can get the lamb/beef with a heapload of fries and all the sauces. They conservatively estimate that you can feed 2-3 people, but even with our hungry group, I would put that figure at 3-4, especially if you order some cold mezzes. Beware however, that it can take up to 30 minutes to get, but ours only took 15.For our starters, we got the roasted beets and Fattet Al-Betenjane. The beets were roasted to perfection and nicely balanced with the goat cheese, while the Fattet was this delicious medley of eggplant with toasted pita bread. The pine nuts and garlic yogurt sauce were a great complement to the flavours in the latter.So, how did the Shawarma tower measure up? About 1.5 feet tall.The fries were perfectly seasoned and were atop a bed of pita bread to make your shawarma with, while the meat roasted around the pit. Obviously, it needs to be plugged in, so be careful of your movements. You have the option to have them carve it or carve it yourself, but either way, it's a novel way to get your shawarma at what I consider to be a perfect price. The sauces were all great - a garlic/lemon juice one was my favourite, along with the tahini, but you also get pickled vegetables (carrots/cucumber) on the side and a hot sauce if you dare (it wasn't too bad). We decided on the lamb because it's not everyday that we eat it, and I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't as toasty crisp as I'm used to. The flavours were all there, but I wish it had been marinaded a bit more.All in all, this was a great, reasonable dining experience, and I really appreciated having some Lebanese food in a nicer setting. I'd definitely recommend for anyone who likes the flavours of the Middle East and wants something refreshing, but be sure to get a reservation!",3,,3
5,Jessica C.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",13,75,39,5.0,9/23/2018,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! The food and service was spectacular and spot on! I tried to come here a couple weeks before but because we didn't have a reservation it was a tough wait. That being said I went ahead and booked a reservation and was seated right away upon arriving. I had the option of either sitting in or outside. I sat outside to soak in the fall weather. I was extremely please with the service I received from my waitress Sarah! She was very attentive, friendly and kind. Her customer service was refreshing and I was glad to have sat in her section. For food I ordered the chicken shawarma, which is their signature dish. It isn't on the menu and you must ask your server about the options. I know they also come in lamb and beef options. My chicken was divine! Perfectly juicy and the pair well with their blankets of pita they serve with it. Every bite was extremely flavorful and great. The serving size is pretty big, can easily feed up to 3 people. The sauces that are served with this dish was also very delightful and a must try when eating this dish. That being said, I will definitely be back very soon! Trust me when I say you won't regret it. Just make a reservation and don't be late! Also an FYI - seating is a little cramped inside. They push tables together for bigger parties but it can feel very tight.",1,1,1
6,Desrin M.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",24,88,561,5.0,9/14/2018,"I came here yesterday with my family for dinner and we had a great time! We did not make reservations and were seated immediately upon arrival as walk ins. The waitress immediately greeted us and I placed the order immediately  for the lamb schwarma which cost $78. Although it is pricey it fed the three of us and allowed us to take good home.  The schwarma is not on the menu and you have to ask for it because it is there specialty and they have been known to run out of it. They also have chicken for $55 and beef filet mignon for $88 are the meat options. The waitress told us it can take 20 minutes to an 1 hour to get your schwarma. It is the go to dish if you come here to eat. We recieved our food in at least 30 minutes. The lamb was delicious, well seasoned and juicy. It comes with a ton of sumac twice fried French fries and pita bread. Beware they have the plug the machine in in order to keep your food warm while you dine and eat. They also come around and cut the meat off of the machine so it is fresh with every cut and bite. My family was acting famished before the meal came and ordered the Fatayir which is a spinach pie and the Rekakat Lahme which is similar to our beef patty. The spinach pie was well seasoned but this puff pastry needed more filling it was all dough literally. I was not really impressed with the other appetizer. I only come for the Schwarma and will only return for the Schwarma. I will definitely return for Schwarma.",2,,1
7,Len N.,"New York, NY",240,94,156,4.0,10/1/2018,"Saw this restaurant on one of those popular Facebook videos and knew I wanted to check it out because of the shawarma rotating platter thing. Was quickly seated (had a reservation) and the restaurant was relatively packed, especially outdoor seating. Service: pretty slow, when we arrived it was packed but things quickly cleared up but still it took forever to get things. One appetizer came out after the entree.Food: absolutely delicious and well seasoned. Had the filet mignon  shawarma ($88 while the lamb was $78 and chicken $68, all of which are not on the menu). It was delicious and a fun little novelty item to watch the thing rotate and to watch it carved tableside. There was a mountain of fries which could have used a tad bit salt, but the meat was spiced to perfection. It happily feed 3 people but you could also split it with 4. I think 2 would leave you both feeling stuffed. Also had Makanek (tiny little sausages that were kind of sweet with a balsamic like sauce that was delicious) and Halloumi which was a divine salty grilled cheese. They happily refilled our basket of free warm pita when asked. Overall I thought it was a cool and delicious experience. Would I specifically go back and order the same thing? Probably not, but don't regret checking out this viral place!",,,
8,Brenda P.,"Manhattan, NY",3,72,152,4.0,9/22/2018,"Good place to share food! I went with a group of 8 people and we got the mezze & dips tray, two Labne W Za'atar Manouche, which were a piece of heaven, and two shawarma, one beef and one lamb. It was perfectly enough for 8. Good service too! My only criticism is that I would've preferred the fries less crunchy. Would go back.",,,1
9,Jack M.,"Hartford, CT",312,195,377,4.0,10/27/2018,"We made a reservation for 7pm and they were ready for us at that time. Once the table was laid, we were seated promptly. The space was decorated with pallets everywhere. They had been used as some type of wall covering as well as the basis for the bench and some spacial dividers. Overall, an interesting effect. The lighting was nice and most noise was generated by patrons and not loud music which I appreciated. Apparently, this spot has gained some fame on other social media because of the table-top shawarma. This is essentially meat which was roasted up in the kitchen to start and then brought out on a rotating spit to the table. With some french fries. Actually like a lot of fries. Maybe the most fries I have ever seen served. Probably enough to feed a small crowd. We ordered the lamb shawarma which was recommended for 2-3. The way we ate it would have been comfortable for for. Two things (or four maybe) to note - the shawarma is not on the menu and the prices we were quoted are: chicken-$58, lamb-$78, steak-$88. The whole thing was a fun experience and delicious over all. Additionally we ordered two other dishes - the beets with chèvre was lovely as expected. The other dish (the name escapes me) was made up of tahini, pine nuts, crisped pita, chickpeas, and eggplant. Also delicious and good light dish while waiting on the meat. This is a good group experience and I would recommend making a reservation (online only) to be seated in a timely manner. This is a nice spot for a small/medium group looking to have a shared, longer meal.",1,,
10,Neha K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,10,20,3.0,11/17/2018,We went there based on the reviews on yelp - I guess we had high expectationsWe had reservations but were made to wait 20minutes We ordered the famous lamb shawarma- it was average(lamb was a bit chewy) - too many fries - $78 not recommended for group of 2 it's too much Congested seating not too many options for drinksI would say decent for groups,,,
11,Anvita S.,"Manhattan, NY",362,251,644,5.0,9/27/2018,"Worth it and absolutely delicious table side shawarma. The portion size is huge and a great value for only $55 (chicken). Between 4 people we still didn't finish and had a ton of leftovers. The lamb with hummus mezze is also a good choice, as the shawarma doesn't come with hummus. It does come with tahini, the most delicious aioli, garlic and hot sauce. We went on a Wednesday night with a reservation and waited only 15-20 minutes for the piping hot chicken shawarma. The waiter cut it up for us so super easy to eat as well.",4,,4

We were seated promptly and we ordered: dip combo, lamb shawarma and chicken shawarma. The dip combo came with 6 different dips and pita. Our favorite was muhammanera, which had red pepper, walnut and had a lot of flavor in it. Both lamb and chicken shawarma came with pita bread, Onions, a tomato and lots French fried. Both meats were well seasoned. We enjoyed the chicken shawarma since it was tender and juicy. The lamb shawarma was dried and over cooked. Service was good and the waiter was funny. If you come to experience shawarma, you should get the chicken.",,,
13,Carolina V.,"Clifton, NJ",70,13,4,5.0,10/11/2018,"Stumbled upon Au Za'atar on instagram and was immediately drawn in and interested in visiting the restaurant and trying their table-side shawarma. Finally had the opportunity a few days ago and the shawarma was excellent!!!! We also had the babaganoush, the hummus, the fattoush salad and the tabbouleh and all lived up to my expectations and tasted very fresh. In regards to the shawarma, I had the beef one but I'd like to return to try the Chicken shawarma because I'm definitely more of a chicken person.The service and wine selection was great as well!Will definitely return!",,,
14,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,3.0,6/13/2018,"Upon arrival, the host asked if we wanted to be seated indoors or outdoors. Since it was a nice day out, we selected outdoors. I thought we were going to be able to sit toward the front of the restaurant, but the server walked us around to the side, where the table was extremely small and not very sturdy. Also, it almost felt like the waiters forgot about us out there. The staff was not very welcoming, so it was not a great first impression.My friend wanted to come here to try the Table Side Sharwarma, which we saw featured on Facebook. When I heard that would cost $70, I suggested trying the Mixed Grill Platter instead (after reading a rave review about it) which would let us try a larger variety of meat. The platter included filet mignon, beef, chicken, jumbo shrimp, baby lamb chops, 2 pieces of pita bread with red colored sauce and sliced purple onions on top, grilled onion and tomato, as well as a side of sumac french fries. All the meat came on top of a long sizzling platter and looked like not much food for something that cost $68. I really did not like the beef kofta. I took one bite and that was more than enough. It had a weird taste and was incredibly grainy. The chicken was decent, but could have used more flavor. The pita was mediocre and the accompanying sauce didn't do it any justice. We asked for pita bread which the waiter brought out for no extra charge which was nice. I enjoyed that pita bread a lot better - It was slightly crisp and delightfully seasoned. What I did like was the expensive stuff: Shrimp, filet mignon and baby lamb chops. The shrimp was wonderfully juicy and succulent. The filet mignon was tender and filled with flavor. The baby lamb chops were the same way, with the edges burnt a bit, just the way I like it! I also liked the cooked veggies that came with it. And the french fries were delicious. They were seasoned with special spices and were extra crispy, while still be fluffy and very potato-y. The service was lackluster. The waiter did not come by that often but at least when he did, he filled our glass with more water. Other than that, I didn't feel like we were being taken care of at all. Our waiter asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu, then just listed one or two things they had available. I was quite disappointed by my experience here and would not come back.",15,8,10
15,Eric F.,"San Leandro, CA",799,2687,266,3.0,9/19/2018,"A fun and lively destination for Lebanese food, but be aware that it'll be a tight fit for large groups.The variety of appetizers including classic hummus, hummus bi lahme and baba ghanoush was very good.  The meats were solid and the tableside lamb and chicken schwarma on rotating spits were a sight to behold.  That aside, it was very interesting to find out how much more flavorful and tender the chicken was over the lamb...  And honestly, the price was a little too steep given that much of the dish was just an enormous pile of fries that served more as filler than anything else.Service was reasonable, though I have to say that the wine service was suboptimal.  Our bottles of red were legitimately warm to the touch upon arrival.  No good at all.Overall, a fun and unique experience with the tableside schwarma.  Beyond that, I'll look elsewhere for good Lebanese food at a better value.",1,,
16,Ava F.,"Manhattan, NY",1,33,20,4.0,10/14/2018,"For someone who grew up on Mediterranean food, it's always nice to encounter restaurants that do it well and that aren't too much about the ""showy"" aspect with decor and what not, and more into actually making the food good. We said down and the hostess told us that the table was reserved for an hour later, but that we could have it in the mean time, which I think is really nice that she accommodated for us. We sat down and had to wait a whole 20 minutes to order, but it was worth it. The California pinot noir that we had to drink was so good, and the appetizers were also amazing. The pita flat bread was incredibly well done, and the various dips that came with it were also flavorful. You could tell that they were freshly made. My friends ordered the Falafel pizzas, which in my opinion is a little too fusion, but the kebab was so tasty. The meat just melts in your mouth.In terms of atmosphere; I didn't really understand the music they chose, it was pop music and didn't seem to fit the vibe of the restaurant. But I really did appreciate the fact that it was perfect volume, not too loud and you could hear yourself think and speak without screaming. Thank you for that, because it just makes the meal more enjoyable. Overall really good experience and a nice casual spot that we will keep in mind whenever we are in the area!",,,

But the ambiance , service and overall experience was nice .... price for this shawarma $90 ! Oh and it feeds about 4-5 people ... it's huge and very filling .... had left overs to take home  oh and how can I forget the amazing white spread they make with simply garlic, lemon juice and salt !!!

Updated review","I met two friends for dinner and had a reservation on a Saturday night. We all loved the food and probably ordered too many small plates but we had to try them all. Also, we ordered one entree and our waiter made it seem like it would be small...it definitely was not. The best dishes we ordered were the labneh and cauliflower. Also, the fries with the chicken kebab were delicious, but the kebab itself was just eh and we were so full from all the plates before. The restaurant is a little warm, especially if you're sitting next to people with the shawarma machine. Overall, we enjoyed a great dinner.",,,
19,Carlynn E.,"San Francisco, CA",2,15,31,5.0,11/10/2018,"Best lamb I have ever had in my life. The restaurant is small, with no standing room at the bar - be sure to make a reservation in advance.

20,Yasir A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",156,57,79,5.0,5/30/2018,"Beyond our expectations.There was a 45-minute wait from when we sat to the food to the food being served. Definitely longer than we expected but every minute was worth it.The fries are literally swimming an ocean of Lebanese flavors and perfectly cooked; crunchy on the outside and mushy on the inside. And, the meat was as good - fresh, juicy and flavorful.The chicken  cost is $58 (beef is $68 and lamb is $78) but you got a lot more for what you pay for. The table-side chicken literally serve 3 people. We took extra food home. Worth every dollar.",5,,1

22,Riselys N.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",248,100,272,3.0,9/17/2018,"Just okay... don't believe the hype you see on Facebook Insider foods video. The tableside shwarma is not on the menu, and upon sitting down for a minute, that's the first thing that the waiter offered us. Okay - cool. Thanks for offering what we came from, BUT bringing it out within 5 minutes? It grossed me out because that means the shwarma was sitting there ready to go for any table that offered it. for $78 it wasn't worth it. We got the lamb shwarma which wasn't seasoned as well as it could've been and it wasn't tender how lamb should be. The fries were pretty soggy also. The best thing on that plate was the onions because they were seasoned deliciously.We also got other sides and appetizers which were great, that's why I'm giving a 3 star rating. We ordered the potato salad, the tabouli salad and falafel. The falafel is a must have, it tastes authentic and seasoned well! Other than that, I definitely wouldn't come back to have the tableside shwarma - not worth the money at all! Oh, and the service isn't great. The waiter barely attended us and he seemed like he was in a rush to serve us.",,,
23,Erin N.,"Uniondale, NY",186,44,49,4.0,5/9/2018,"Came here for my mother's birthday. The reviews mentions this place is small and crammed which is all correct unfortunately. Food 4/5: my main purpose of coming here was to try the table side shawarma. When I asked for it, they said it's not on the menu and it's a special request. The prices are $58 for chicken, $68 for beef and $78 for lamb. I opted for the lamb and they also mentioned it can take between 30- to an hour to prepare. Since we were hungry and didn't want to wait, we ordered the Mezze & Dips tray as well. Both arrived fairly quickly, the lamb took maybe 20-25 minutes. The lamb comes with a bed of pita bread fries and onions. The lamb was delicious however the price is ridiculous! If there were a bed of rice and other sides, it may make up for the price but no way is 78 reasonable. The lamb dish can feed up to 3 people I say, maybe 2 with some left over. Atmosphere 3/5: This place is very tiny and unfortunately with the high demand they are having now I can't imagine how busy it gets on the weekends. The decor is nice but nothing too special. The bathroom definitely needs some work. Music was awesome. Service 5/5: We made reservations beforehand and when we arrived it was a quick sit to our table. We had various waiters, no one introduced themselves as our waiter :( however a gentleman named ""Khalid"" was helping us out most of the night along with another man. Easily explained the menu and cut the meat for us when necessary. Also, I mentioned to them it was my mothers birthday and they brought over some baklava, and didn't charge us for it which I highly appreciated. Khalid was very attentive and personable. The staff here on Wednesday was great.",13,2,2

When we arrived we were immediately greeted and seated. Upon walking inside I thought *ok this is a tad bit darker than dim, it's too dark*. After sitting for about 10mins we were greeted by our waitress. We placed an order for the Lamb Shawarma *$78*and also requested pita bread to nibble on as we waited for the Lamb. The pita bread never came. I saw my waitress a total of 3 times... when we placed our order, when I flagged her down for the bill and when she collected the signed copies. As for the Lamb Shawarma I wasn't  impressed. The lamb was lacking the flavor that I just knew it would have. The fries were too hard. I do like how it's served BUT the restaurant is not properly set up for such a display. The rotisseries that they bring table side with your food on it are plugged into electrical sockets through out the restaurant. At tables where the socket is further away they run extension cords around other tables. All of this thru a dark restaurant while patrons are walking around. I also found it to be hot inside. It was later explained to me the AC can't exceed a certain temp because of the rotisseries. On a hot summer night the last thing I want to do is sit in a restaurant that's not on chill. Another shocker is they do NOT serve hard liquor. Only beer & wine.",2,,

And did I mention about their family platter called Dalaa mahshi, this is lamb and their special type of rice!! Their lamb was so tender, it needs no cutting into the lamb.. the meat just breaks into pieces when you fork into it because it was sooo tender.

They serve exceptional Middle Eastern food, the atmosphere inside is quiet tight but cozy. As you enter the small restaurant you are greeted by one of the friendly and attentive managers, they walk you to your table, and YES reservations is a MUST. They are famously known for their table side shawarma which gets brought to the table on a gyro spit over rice and fries. You can either order the chicken or the filet mignon. It is quiet a show and very interesting to cut your own meat tableside. We got some hummus babagabush and felafels which all tasted good and the prices were a slightly on the higher side. If you're ever in the mood for a show make sure to reserve your table at this place. The tableside gyro is definetly worth it.",1,,1

Beautiful wood paneling, brick wall backdrop, long draped curtains and dim lighting for all your date night and group needs. The owner Tarik was the sweetest host, as were his servers (our main guy being Khalid). Water constantly refilled, table checked up on by 4 different waiters; they were aiming to please throughout the evening. My friends and I spent a good 3 hours there and weren't rushed at all. As a matter of fact, we received a round of Prosecco and their knafeh dessert on the house, and invited to stay even longer. All the while as the restaurant was getting packed with nearly all the tables taken.The French Lebanese food was so beautifully prepared. They started us off with pita bread covered in za'atar and a side of yogurt dipping sauce. Delicious and creamy, the pita a perfect vehicle for dipping. We ordered the Mixed Grill Platter Supreme $68, a huge tray of beautifully grilled meats including baby lamb chops, filet mignon, beef kafta kebab, chicken kafta, and shrimp. It came with sides of pita and sumac fries, and numerous dipping sauces that were sublime, especially the za'atar garlic aioli. Mezze & Dips Tray $48 was delicious as well, each with its own flavor profile. The Batata Harra (spicy roasted potatoes), Arnabeet Bi Tarator (cauliflower in tahini sauce), and Baba Ghanoush were particularly outstanding. I couldn't get enough of their dips and mezze spread all over the pita bread. We were oohing and aahing when the platters were presented, and mm mmming after every bite. A telltale sign of a meal done right. A++ location in the East Village that I'm dying to go back to!",23,11,22

If you go, you must have the shawarma - it's brought to the table on a personal-sized rotisserie and early fed four people with leftovers!

31,Carina P.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",674,378,382,4.0,2/4/2018,"I came with my two best friends on a Friday night at 7:00. I must say, Au Za'atar serves the most authentic food I have had in awhile. Every dish was flavorful and well spiced.  Other than the complimentary pita bread with za'atar, we ordered two dips because my friends are obsessed with hummus. A warm, delicious basket of pita was served with each of our dips.  Table-side/ do-it-yourself shwarma: I saw the do-it- yourself shwarma on Instagram. The manager, Jay, informed us upon our arrival that we were supposed to know to order the shwarma ahead of time because they are usually sold out. Naturally, I panicked and hunted down our waiter. Jay told us that sometimes they have ""extras"", i.e.  someone who orders the shwarma ahead of time decides they do not want it anymore. You can say my friends and I got ""lucky"". We were told that the lamb shwarma was available. I  jumped on the opportunity and did not ask any questions. It came with a MOUNTAIN of fries and a tray of various dips and sauces on the side. One of the feta dips was absolutely delicious. However, we overcooked the meat, so be sure to watch it. The waiter doesn't notify you when to cut it. Additionally, the fries came cold.Our waiter should have told us the price of the do-it-yourself shwarma regardless of my fervent insistence on ordering it. I was upset and extremely surprised (to say the least) to see the dish was $80 when the check came. Just because I saw it on social media and was excited about ordering it did not mean that I knew how much it cost! The dish is not even on the menu!",8,5,3
32,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",119,301,527,4.0,8/4/2018,"We tried almost everything when we came but the things I loved the most were the following:-hummus & spicy hummus: one of the best that I've had in NY. It was so creamy and delicious -falafel pizza: there were so many toppings and it was amazing -rekakat jebne: this was a blend of five cheeses in phyllo and it was amazing. It was almost like a spring roll with just melted cheese inside.-fried cauliflower: the sauce on this was amazing and the cauliflower wasn't too heavily breaded-filet mignon shawarma: this was a huge portion and the presentation was amazing. The meat is well seasoned and tender and the fries that come with it are amazing because of the seasoning. -the pita was also amazing and fresh-the rice that came with the meal was also amazingI also tried the following, but think I would skip it next time:-basturma w jebne: this was a flatbread with cheese and sliced beef. It was good but I thought the other flatbread we got had so much more flavor.-baba ghanoush: this was good, but nothing special-potato cubes: this was well seasoned, but there are so many other amazing dishes -mujadara: rice, lentils and caramelized onions. Same comment about the potato cubes.-fattoush salad: nothing really special about this salad.-mixed grill platter: everything was good on this platter, but I would much rather get the personal tableside shawarma. I think that the only thing I didn't enjoy were the desserts, but everything else was amazing. If you haven't been here you should definitely visit.",,,

Au Za'atar and its staff, that's who!We had the United Nations of service that night - Serbia, the Middle East and Central America were all waiting on us. The owner periodically checked in to make sure we were being taken care of despite the dinner rush that had them in the weeds for a good thirty minutes. What I really appreciated was their meats being halal, since the birthday girl is an observant Muslim and it often is difficult for her to eat the things she likes outside of her home. Details like this matter. The comped wine (Vinho Verde de Portugal) for running out of the Muhammara dip we wanted. The slice of k'nefe with a tiny candle our server brought to the table even though it wasn't requested. She was glowing like the jewels in her plastic crown. The atmosphere was insanely packed by the time we got up to leave, with random patrons wishing her tipsy ""happy birthdays"" on the way out.

This review is purely based on the service.I went in on Sunday with a friend around 7 PM which I assumed was going to be a busy time but the restaurant was only half full. We ordered the meat platter. The waitress told us that it would take about 20 minutes To prepare and we agreed that it was OK. After waiting almost 50 minutes we inquired about the food and the wait staff checked and brought the food to our table.By this time we were really quite hungry, we tried the fries and took a bite of the meat; the fries were cold And so were all the meats on the platter. We both decided to send food back and were really disappointed to learn that it would take another 20 minutes to get the new serving.After waiting another 20 minutes we got fresh and hot food. The food was delicious and we enjoyed it. However there was no acknowledgment of the delay by the staff and no apology for the fact that we were served almost an hour and a half later.To say the least this was a very disappointing dining experience.",2,,

The main attraction here is the table-side shawarma -- and, trust, it is as cool as it looks in the photos.Taste-wise, everything is on target here, and you cannot go wrong with any of the small appetizer dishes or mains! Some ones to try for sure include the spiced cauliflower, the hummus, and any of the table-tide shawarma meats (lamb is off the chain). My dining party also loved the fried cheese and ordered more of it! I thought it was just ok, but maybe it was just not my thing. Oh, and be sure to taste their homemade tahini sauce and hot sauce--nom!!!Note they only have wine and and beer and not a full bar.",5,2,3

I had the chicken and it was freaking good omg and let me just say this i dont eat radish but today i ate it omgggggg it was like sauteed in something red because it was red and it tasted like pickles ‍‍‍ i loveee pickles man you guys have to try this place out.., now most importantly they have garlic sauce mixed with lemon juice like what the hell ???

So I decided to give it a try as I see amazing pics of food all the time on Instagram.  There most popular dish seems to be the table side shawarma . You can get chicken, lamb or beef.  I decided to try the lamb.  To be honest it does not rank on any of my top restaurants that I felt served great lamb.  It was very dry and kind of bland tasting.  I'm glad I tried this place but I'm sure I will try other dishes it I ever decide to come back.",,,

Especially the service - probably one of the best I've ever come across and the owner is so sweet. We had a cauliflower appetizer and another bread appetizer with a dip. Then, my companion and I shared a meat platter which included a variety of roasted meats, veggies and dips. Everything tasted really fresh and clean - well seasoned and smoky. They just started having a personal rotating kebab machine which was so cool and fun. It's really a sight and highly recommend getting it. Highly recommend coming here!

They also served it with a couple of garlic-based dipping sauces that were absolutely delicious. We opted for a salad and grilled veggies rather than french fries, and while not as impressive as the meats, were still a decent side.Overall, this platter really hit the spot and let us try most of their meats and was a great value.

Sure it looks delicious from the videos, but when you come in to try it it's nothing to tell your mama about. Meat was kind of dry and it just came with a mountain of fries. Service was also adequate. I ordered my wine 2x because it didn't come the first time and they tried to charge me for my imaginary glass.

We made a reservation in advance and when we got to the reaturant we were seated almost right away. We also arrive 15 mins after they opened at 4PM which made it all better. There was music and the restaurant's ambience was very relaxing and comfortable. As we were seated, our waiter came over and took our order for drinks. The waiter was pretty kool and she took our pictures with my Polaroid. We ordered the Chicken Shawarma, which came with fries, $57 and it took about 30-40 mins which is the usual wait time for this specialty. The food was authentic and absolutely delicious. It can also feed up to 4 people. We ate so much that we couldnt get off our seats after. We interacted briefly with the owner as we were leaving which was pretty kool since this rarely happens especially at a resturant which is a bit ""pricey"" but worth every buck.

The lamb came out on a skewer with a rotating heater and there are french fries piled up with pita on the bottom. The heater made the table very hot though.

We ordered 2 family style shawarma for the table We received only one and then the waiter tell us that the other one will take another hour and offers us to take the more expensive dish 2 of us ordered fish- the salmon extra dry and the sea bass was swimming in thini sauce so I eat only the inside The shawarma was also very dry To sum up Crowded place Bad service And bad food Never going to take a recommendation from the insider again.... ‍‍‍,1,,

48,Ayesha M.,"Queens, NY",65,107,19,4.0,4/25/2018,"Came here on a Friday night with reservations for 10:45pm. We were 10 minutes late though and I guess they gave away our table since we had to wait a while. They start with a complimentary bread with some Turkish cheese that was really good! We ordered a small pizza like appetizer to start, which was also pretty good. We obviously came to try the tabletop shawarma. But to my disappointment, it wasn't anything ravingly amazing. The fries that came with it were pretty good. I think the reason we were slightly disappointed though is because we really wanted to try the lamb shawarma but they had run out, so we instead ordered the beef, which was ok. It was unfortanate because when we had arrived, they had still had lamb which is why we waited for our table, but because they took so long to seat us, they had run out of lamb by then (which was really frustrating!!). The beef was $68, lamb $78, and chicken $58. The way I thought of it, I was essentially paying $50 to watch my shawarma be cut in front of me, which in retrospect may not have been worth it. The amount of meat also didn't seem that much when considering how much i was paying. Overall though, the servers were reallllyyy nice and attentive, which is why I give it 4 stars rather than 3. They have a milk pudding which is fantastic also! But I think I'd hold off on getting the table too shawarma again.",9,,

They had a sauce that is their own and it was amazing, it was zaatar aioli, don't leave without trying it and dipping everything in it. The shawarma machine was an experience. The shawarma tasted delicious and it fed 4 of us. We got to meet the owner and chat with him,he's very down to earth and generous.

They cut it for you as well, so that helps reduce some anxiety- and it is surrounded in a bed of perfectly seasons fries  My friend and I shared one order and we also took a good amount home- the portion is more thank enough.

Call in advance to request, even though they said they don't technically take reservations for it. It's definitely instagrammable and fun, but most importantly it was actually tasty. Someone will be granted the power of using the 8 inch chef's knife, and that someone should take their job seriously. Slice the meat thinly from top to bottom, letting the meat rain onto the mounds of zaatar fries and pita bread below. Quickly devour, and repeat. Spread some sauces on in this time, maybe some tomato and onion salad. Whatever way you want to eat it, there is no wrong way. Your way might just be messier than someone else's. We also ordered an assortment of mezze and dips which I'm 90% certain they forgot about, because they brought it at the end of the meal post-feast and we could barely eat any of it. We also ordered Fattet Djaj, a mixture of chicken, chickpeas, yogurt, crispy pita chips & pine nuts cooked in a clay pot. I would categorize it as a casserole. Hearty and filling, and pretty tasty.

We also ordered the grilled meat platter, unfortunately was a little overdone and dry.

64,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,3.0,3/7/2018,"My party of 4 came here on a Saturday night to try out their tableside shawarma.  For a set price ($58 for chicken, $68 for beef, $78 for lamb), you get a miniature vertical grill set up on your table with your meat of choice, vegetables, fries, pita bread, and sauces to feed 2-3 people.  We opted for the lamb thinking it would be the most authentic.  We called a couple of days in advance to notify them of our order, as they need time to prepare the meat.Our first impression of the shawarma was that the portion size is TINY.  For $78, we could probably order more shawarma than we could finish at any middle eastern restaurant or food truck.  We were clearly paying for the novelty of having our own personal shawarma, which would've been okay if it tasted fantastic.  All in all, the flavors were decent, but we were all largely underwhelmed.  The meat is mostly cooked by the time it's brought out your table, and by the time we sliced and ate it, it was overcooked and dried out.  Also, it tasted a bit underseasoned and required a lot of sauce.In addition to the shawarma, we also ordered several appetizers to share, including the hummus and falafel.  The appetizers and the complimentary pita bread with za'atar were thankfully much more flavorful than the shawarma.Overall, the tableside shawarma is very gimmicky.  Come to get your 'gram photo, but don't expect too much, and definitely order off their a la carte menu.",9,1,2

We went for dinner on Monday night service was non existent. It took 15 minutes to get ice for water, getting a straw was another challenge. 10 minutes after that we finally got hummus. Wine, the glass wasn't even 1/3 full. After an hour we finally got food. Fish was completely off, it was supposed to be over spinach which I only specified 5 times and was drained in oil and meat was dry and tasted like it was dipped in bbq sauce or spicy sauce to cover the fact that it wasn't fresh. Manager didn't exist. Unfortunately left starving, disgusted and disappointed. Basically the highlight of my dinner was the pickle, even pita wasn't good.",,,

70,Beth H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,0,1.0,10/3/2018,Food was fine at best. The service and the management are absolutely dreadful. Took over an hour and a half for our food and the manager fought with us when we complained.,1,,

Some of it was a bit salty for my palette. The portions were a bit small for the price considering many other Mediterranean places are cheaper for similar quality/ambiance. I ordered the HH $5 bites:Baba ganoush: nice eggplant flavor. A bit salty. Hummus beruit: this was good as well, a bit salty also. Chicken kebab entree ($25): I was impressed that the chicken was cooked well and not over cooked or dry. There was a nice variety on the place, but I'd argue it's a but petite for the $25 tag. The service was very attentive and lovely.",,,
72,Rachel F.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",39,126,5,5.0,10/14/2017,I have eatin here quite a few times. But today I wondered in during happy hour. Dude $5 for my favorite dishes. How did I not know about this? So good. They are mini portions but they are also mini prices. There is just something about really good Middle Eastern that makes me so happy. The spices they use here are very good and they use lemon and garlic very well. Highly recommend.,,,
73,Tina X.,"Manhattan, NY",30,151,12,4.0,2/26/2018,"I've been looking for good middle eastern food since I moved to NYC. This is the first spot that has come close to what i remember from my Arabian travels. The food was so close that I looked around for a magic lamp in the hopes of finding a genie. I came here with my Lebanese friend just to confirm if I was correct and he liked it too. The appetizer zaatar flat bread  and lubneh was really good. Then we had the tabouli and the meat pizza. Ok not meat pizza but I forget what it was called. Both were good. The tabouli parsley was not chopped fine enough and the pizza was just a tad underseasoned, but overall not bad.Call me a sheep but of course I got the table side Shwarma because every single Instagram post of this restaurant shows the table side Shwarma. Everyone is doing it! It was delicious and super fun. Like a moth to flames, I was drawn to the rotating tower of delcious dripping meat. I was burned a few times by the stand up meat cooking machine but was so focused on the task of meat procurement that I didn't even notice. Mmmmmm meat. The sauces were great too. By sauces I mean garlic sauce. White garlicky amazingness. If i went on fear factor and they challenged me to eat a cockroach, I'd dip the cockroach in this sauce and bottoms up. That's how good it is. The Shwarma is served with fries, pita onions...a little too many onions. The fries were good. But how often does a fried potato go wrong. Overall, I would definitely come back...but be warned this is not a first date place. It's not even a second or third date place because you will walk away with strong dragon breath that will kill any chances of scoring with a new paramour. First kiss? Forget about it. This is more of a place for couples or friends that are past the initial stages.....think...no more shaving to impress each other stage.Id give this place 5 stars if the dessert game was stronger. Overall, a little on the pricey side as well but it's also NYC east village where you can only qget organic hipster coffee for 5 bucks a cup so...its all relative.The food was so fun and good, and I was so distracted by the rotating meat that I didn't even notice the service...so I assume it was fine. The restaurant decor itself is modest but fine. You'll be so focused on the food you won't really notice.",1,,1
74,Mona S.,"Henrico, VA",0,18,27,4.0,8/18/2018,"We had a great time at Au'zatar. Our party of 7 arrived an hour early and they were able to accommodate us no problem! We ordered the chicken gyro and mixed Mediterranean grill supreme! For 7 ppl! It was plenty of food for us,  half were kids under 12.  It would likely feed 5 adults easy.  The waiter brought the gyro on the spit, and cut it table side, the adults and the kids enjoyed the display!  The hummus was also a great texture.  You get pita on the side of everything for make your own gyro.  The table is covered in condiments: garlic, tahini, pickled cabbage, pickles, I'm sure I'm missing some!  Great spot! Great food and ambiance!",,,
75,Priss F.,"Antioch, CA",0,7,0,1.0,10/18/2018,"The famous question asked after dining someplace for the first time: ""Would you try it a second time?"" An individual's answer usually determines whether the restaurant was worth every penny or not. In this case, if I were asked this question, the answer would be, HECK NO! Not just NO, but HECK-TO-THE-NO! This place is over priced & over rated. My family and I were visiting New York City from California. This was a place that we had on our list of the many places to try, since we did see it for the first time, on television. It was our last day (Wednesday night 10/10/2018 at around 7pm).  We had come earlier that day to find it closed until 4pm. So we decided to do more touring and visit a few last hot spots before coming back to Au Za'atar after 4pm. After trying many different restaurants/food courts throughout our five days stay, we decided to make this place our ""grand finale"" of meals. However, there was nothing ""grand"" about our  ""finale"" here. First, I almost felt as if the workers were prejudice (and by no means am I trying to jump the gun, but the symptoms were definitely in existence... and if this is in fact true - SHAME ON YOU, Au Za'atar!), standoffish, or just flat out unwelcoming. We came in dressed casual because we're tourist, it was our last day, and it was our last stop for the day/night. Restaurants should welcome customers with a warm smile. They should make you feel as if you're in the right place to experience good dining.. get comfortable and make every dollar worth spending. The host (he) was not welcoming. There were quite a few waitresses who seemed as if they could use more customer service training. One waitress (who seemed like the head of waitresses there) just stood at the front door, looking around the restaurant like an unmarked security guard. The waitress who was going table to table with the 2 jars of sauces, appeared to be very unhappy while placing the items on the tables, and when I had asked what the sauces were for and types of sauces, the waitress seemed reluctant to explain. FYI: explain to customers what you bring to the table and what it is used for. Do not drop off and ditch! I thought I was the only one who felt this way, until the table next to me, pressed (as the waitress quickly dropped off and turned away) the same waitress to explain what she had placed on their table and what it is used for (the 2 jars of sauces). Anyhow, the Shawarma was much smaller than what we had seen on television. We had got the lamb shawarma and a few other dishes, but the shawarma was what we were looking forward to and I have to say, it was remarkably disappointing. It was much smaller than expected. Over priced. It wasn't hot. Meat was dry. Barely any flavor. Out of the entire dish, the fries were the only thing good, which we could have bought anywhere!! Our bill came out to about $160 (20 dollars tip). I am one to always tip 20% wherever we dine.. however, as my husband received our receipt to sign and to include tip, he looked at me and just as he was going to say 20%, I quickly responded over him, ""$20!"" My husband knew at that point, I was not too happy with our dining experience. I mean, honestly... I feel a $20 tip was still a bit too generous. I was better off taking that $20 to the catering food truck by the Sheraton in Manhattan/Time Square. A plate there would have been much more satisfying, for a much smaller fee and to top it off - a welcoming smile. Also, when my husband ordered his second corona, it took forever to receive it. When we had received our check, my husband had yet to receive the beer, so he had told one of the waiters he no longer wanted the beer. The waiter had gone to tell our waitress, who apparently had the beer in hand, and after speaking with her briefly, he came back and said, ""sorry, it's already opened."" My husband told him it's okay, but I couldn't help but look at my husband and repeat, ""it's already been opened??"" Quite frankly, it doesn't matter. Please don't ever use that as an excuse in the future. It's not a good look.Moral of the story: Au Za'atar, (particularly) you're customer service and shawarma needs major improvement!",,,

The photos and videos of this mountain of Fries & Meat was too good to not experience! My Wife surprised me with lunch here & once I found out where we were, I jumped for joy! The hostess was so kind, the server was sweet and the atmosphere was amazing. It was around 2pm or 3pm so it was quiet on a beautiful Summer day in a nice neighborhood. The outdoor seating was situated so nice but we decided to eat indoors (for better photos ;). They only had chicken available during the day but that was cool. The fries were DELICIOUS due to that seasoning they put on it & you have to dip it in that garlic sauce dip. OMG! Taste HEAVEN! The chicken was amazing too! It's worth all of the hype! :)",1,,

As for the service, all of the servers were so personable and attentive - my wine glass was filled before I could even ask for another!I've been living in NYC for over 8 years and dine out ALOT - this was definitely one of the best dining experiences I've had here.

79,Dani L.,"Key Biscayne, FL",49,349,365,5.0,1/15/2018,"My favorite Lebanese/Mediterranean restaurant in all of NYC. Make a reservation just to make sure, because it's always full for dinner. The prices here are great, especially the wine bottle prices. (They only serve wine and beer here). The bottle of merlot we got was $38. Pretty good deal for a restaurant in NYC. They gave us a complimentary labne with bread, and it was soooo delicious. Labne is like a cream cheese, but with a smoother consistency and more flavorful taste. We liked it so much we ordered an actual plate of just labne. We also got the eggplant with spices as an appetizer, and the chicken kebab with rice and salad. The portions here are so big, so you can share one plate for two people. The restaurant has a really cool ambience, with arab music and decor. The waiter was really sweet and attentive, and the food was brought out in a timely fashion. It was also very clean and there was a bunch of people, making the experience even better!",3,,
80,Zain F.,"Flushing, NY",5,34,1,3.0,10/10/2018,"Although very unique in concept, the food itself was nothing worth raving about. Ambiance and creativity is the real reason to go here. I did not enjoy the shwarma too much and would definitly rather go to an actual fast food style shwarma spot then coming here next time. Everyone comes here for the ""on the table rotisserie"" shwarma expierence. No denying it is a awesome sight to expierence, but with the thrill comes the pricetag. What would cost at most $20 at any other given shwarma spot, cost roughly $80 for the shawarma expierence for a shwama meal for two.In a nutshell, great spot for a date or group celebration hang out, but dont go in with the expectation of having the best shawrma expierence ever. Also, prepare to reach deep in your wallets to cover an ""OK"" expierence expense.",,,

We got a chicken and steak shwarma and a variety of starter mezze plates (lentils with caramelized onions, hummus, cauliflower with tahini.) The za'atar aioli is basically crack. I would put it on anything. The pita was delicious. I thought the shwarma could have had a little more flavor, but the chicken was cooked perfectly and the resulting pita sandwiches were just as good as any I've had in my (very limited) travels throughout the Middle East. The restaurant itself is pretty small, and the table space gets even more cramped when the spits are brought out (also, it gets really hot.) Overall, a great dinner.

84,Buğra E.,"Guttenberg, NJ",39,5,12,1.0,6/13/2018,"Arrogant managerShort staffed restaurantAir conditioners are out of orderUnpleasant smellFire hazard due to insufficient capacity of electricityI was at this place last night. It was my second time and I've really enjoyed the first dinner I had there. The only reason that I came to this place was their table side shawarma which I've seen a video on Facebook. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. I also invited two of my friends who were fasting which means they didn't eat or drink anything approximately 17 hours. I personally went in to ask if they have table side shawarma Since it is the only reason that we went there. They said yes and I told them to arrange a place where we can have table side shawarmaWe had our reservation and everything was going well until they got the table ready for us. We were waiting to order table side shawarma. The waitress came and told us that she could only bring the table side shawarma without the hot plates around it because of the electrical problems that they had. It may be very dangerous if they plug more than two electrical hot plates at the same time. I already saw 3-4 table sides shawarmas at the time she was explaining this to us but I'm not sure if they are plugged in or not. I assume nobody wants to eat cold shawarma but since I didn't check the plugs I can't make any comment on this. When we told for the 3rd time that the table side shawarma is the one and only reason that we were there and we want to have it warm and cooked she told us they cannot provide it. We tried to stay calm and ask if it is possible to find a table anywhere that we can have cooked and warm shawarma. She went in to talk with her manager and in 10 seconds she came back saying that they have a table where we can use the plugs to keep our shawarma warm. It was 9:10 pm while we moved to that table. The place was overcrowded, the air conditioners were not working, especially the unpleasant smell was not a good match for a soft light theme where you cannot even see your fork. We've already ordered shawarma and some hot appetizer since we are told that shawarma would be ready in 20 to 45 minutes. At 9:30 a new waitress brought our appetizer and she told due to some problems they cannot bring the shawarma in 1 hour. She said It may even take more time so if we want to order something else. It was the 4rd time that we said we were just there to have shawarma. We explained that we are told shawarma would be ready in 20 to 45 minutes. After 20 minutes of waiting she was there saying that it won't be ready even in 1 hour.We said we cannot accept this situation and we insisted that we have already ordered to other waitress. She called the other waitress. When she came to our table she was nervous and kept saying that we should be understanding. When we were talking with her an arrogant guy came up. He told her that she should leave and take care of other people in the middle of my sentence. He turned us and told WHATS THE MATTER WITH YOU GUYS. He was so insolent that other people around us got nervous. We told him for the 5th time that we came to have shawarma. But he was denying anything that we say. It was the moment that we decided to leave this place when he said DONT WASTE MY TIMEWe were so hungry that we couldn't argue with this arrogant guy and make this worse. If you are planning to go this place think twice. I realized that we were not the first people behaved this way. I really regret that I have not read the reviews here and other apps like yelp.",3,,

The service was extremely slow even though the waiter was sweet, the kitchen was so slow, our orders took 2 hour to come out, completely unacceptable. The suggestion to order two platters and 1 tableside gyro was horrible, it does not feed 10 people. The portions are so small and full of over salty fries. They were out of lamb and beef gyro meet so we ordered chicken had no flavor. All 3, the gyro and the platters are over flowing with fries and very little meat.

This is definitely the best Middle Eastern food we've tried in the U.S. However, I was disappointed with the service. It took awhile for our server to come to us, and we had to try to get her attention multiple times.

We ordered glasses of Lebanese wine - Les Terrors (red) for him, Clos Blanc for her.We begin with meze - the spicy Muhamarra arrived first, topped with a bit of pomegranate molasses and walnuts. One of the best versions of the dish I have had, and a generous portion. A bit later, hummus bi lahme arrives  - the dominant flavor in the hummus is sesame (not garlic) the meat, juicy and savory. The second round of pita triangles is warm and cut larger than the first.Our main courses are not quite up to the level of the meze. The kofta Benedict comprises two nice patties topped with egg, a tomato based sauce, and a large pile of fries. The poached eggs have firm yolks so they don't run. I am not sure if the fries were supposed to be their sumac fries, but I did not taste any sumac, they were pretty typical fries, topped with chopped parsley. There were two triangles of toasted pita topped with za'atar - these were delicious, the best thing on the plate. My companion's falafel salad was delicious, my only misgiving being the small portion of falafel - four balls would have been nice.A Yelp check-in brought us free baklava for dessert - a square and a small cigar shaped piece. This was excellent.The Lebanese coffee (don't ask for Turkish as I did) arrives unsweetened in a finjan and is quite nice.Service was friendly and attentive throughout the meal.

Updated review","Good food ! Really far for us and hard to get to. But read good reviews and wanted to take some out of town friends for Lebanese . The good : the complimentary Zatar bread ! Was warm came with a Lebneh dip... I asked for more and I thought It was complimentary ... but at the end of the night we had a $6 charge for ""extra""...like why not tell me it's not complimentary...See this is what I didn't like about this place and why it gets 3 stars... like you're pretending to be a fancy Lebanese experience . We got the mezze and dips tray for $48 and the mixed grill platter for $48 as well. Both are slightly (like15-20%) overpriced for the portion and what you get. The mezze and dips tray -you get hummus (had a lot of parsley) , baba ganoush (I've had better but everyone else loved it ) , the cauliflower which was amazing (!!), potatoes which were delicious and foul (fava beans ) . The mixed grill platter comes with 4 skewers - the chicken was amazing ! The kafta was yum! The chicken shish was mehhhh , the ""filet mignon "" if you can even call it that was horrific!!! It comes w 4 dips and fries which was yum . The zatar aioli dip and the garlic was great. The tahini dip and hot dip was useless . That's why I guess we felt it was slightly overpriced because we only liked 50-60% of the things. Also for a decently priced restaurant , who is giving you a complimentary bread , don't charge me extra for asking for more . Or Just tell me when I do ask so I know ! And if I really wanted it (which I did ) I would've ordered it ... but just inform me ..so much for Lebanese hospitality! Kinda left me with a negative impression . So we probably won't go back here. It's probably not so popular because of the mildly overpriced dishes . And pretty inconvenient to get to unless you're already in or live in the area",,,
94,Chad R.,"Puebla, Mexico",338,3,0,1.0,10/11/2018,Terrible service.  After waiting an hour and 20 minutes we were told by the server that they accidentally gave our order to another table and that they were at that point out of what we requested. When we complained to the manager (who was also a co-owner) he accused us of lying and said that they couldn't have given our order away because they were already out. We asked him to get the waitress so she would verify our story but he refused. He was incredibly unprofessional and childish. I've never been treated so poorly at a restaurant.,,,

The staff was great and service was as good as a tiny place can get when it's crowded. The reason for 2 stars is that the food is very mediocre. I am middle eastern and had way better kabobs elsewhere. The place is completely based around social media hype. The price points compared to the portions are horrible. I get it it's a fancy place and your not suppose to get the bang for your buck but it would be justifiable if the food was actually decent. The fillet mignon kebabs I had was just blah; no spices or flavor of any nature and my fries were burnt to a crisp (felt like tooth pics). If you want to go for the hype and instagram pics this is your spot. Hope you enjoy super tight spaces where you might get elbowed by the waiters. Highly DO NOT recommend this place for any of their food.,,,

100,Cape Review S.,"Boston, MA",1,16,53,5.0,7/18/2018,Really great place to get together with Friends or family and eat here. The food is 100% Halal and it's the authentic taste of Lebanon. We were a group of 5 and ordered the rotating table side shawarma which was delicious. It came with a mountain full of fries topped with parsley and onions which made it so flavorful. I recommend the table side shawarma for like 3 people. We also ordered the mix platter which was a mix of chicken and lamb which was also tasty and also ordered a few other small dishes which were also good. I do not recommend the lentil rice as it was the only thing not tasty. It's also better to make a reservation even though you can walk in but be prepared to wait because sometimes it can be pretty full. Overall we really enjoyed eating here and the taste was much better than expected.,,,
101,Nicole N.,"Brooklyn, NY",156,152,181,5.0,5/13/2018,"We had the Chicken Schwarma ($58) which is not on the menu and ordered a couple appetizers to share. It was BOMB. The platter came with a lot of fries and pita bread and you can dip it in garlic sauce, humus, labneh. Delicious place. Love the food. The food does get a little bit much and it's super salty. Depending on how much you can eat. They also have lamb and beef options. Come with many friends to help you eat too. We drank a lot of water cause the food does get salty cause of the spices. We can't wait to come back for more Schwarma. It takes an hour or so to prep and get ready so order in advance/asap.",3,,1
102,David A.,"New York, NY",34,14,6,1.0,4/28/2018,"Let's start with the food which, even though very average, was the highlight of this terrible experience.The taboulé was terrible. I've had taboulé my entire life and make some every summer. This is just not it. Throwing a bunch of parsley and cilantro together doesn't make a taboulé. Next.The other appetizers were quite generic. Nothing to write home about, but the beet salad had beets in it and I like beets so job done. The cauliflower salad had very little of it. Anyway, I was excited about their grilled platter.Be warned that it's tiny. The meat is good, perfectly cooked, moist, and tender. Good job on this one. The side vegetables are uninspired. They just happened to pass by a grill and roasted a bit by the flame, then ended up on the plate next to the meat. Not to mention the fries, which were soggy and almost cold by the time they reached our table (read on).We're done with the good part (yeah, that was the good part).  Onto the service and ambiance.It first took about 20 minutes to get seated (with a reservation). To be fair, we added an extra person, but we ended up sitting at our 4-person table anyway, so not sure what we had to wait for. Anyway.We promptly ordered since we had ample time to peruse their food options before. The first appetizer took 48min to reach our table! Yes, I can be that precise since a friend sent a text to his girlfriend as we sat down. Staff was absolutely useless. We kept asking what was up, every 10-15min given we had ordered a bunch of already prepared appetizers. They showed no interests whatsoever and would only reply with generic ""I'll check on it"". WTF guys.I'd like to end on a nice note so let's conclude with ambiance.Ambiance was crap, period. It's way too small, but not in a cute way. You will have to scream to chat with your friends. Not even the music they played way too loud was appropriate,  it almost sounded like K-Pop. So out of place.Needless to say, I highly recommend you DON'T go to this place and try anything else around (so many choices in that neighborhood!)",6,3,
103,Anu K.,"Manhattan, NY",313,208,390,3.0,6/7/2017,"Came here with some friends on a Monday night had an interesting experience to say the least.   We ordered a variety of vegetarian mezzes and the family platter which was the perfect amount and easy for all of us to share. HIGHLIGHTS: - The complimentary bread is probably the best bread I've had at any restaurant anywhere. It's worth coming just for the bread.. thats how bomb it is. - Baba Ghanoush - YUM. super flavorful - Fattet Al-betenjane - interesting mix of chickpeas, eggplant and yogurt.  - Mixed Grill Platter -  Perfect for sharing and great for sampling.  Fries/side salad were great complements.  Would recommend if coming with a group of meat eaters.Now to why I had to dock stars: we spotted a mouse ( !! ) in the corner of the restaurant and when we told our waiter... he walked away to let the manager (I'm guessing) know, but then came back 5 minutes later with absolutely no sense of urgency; instead telling us that the the mouse ""probably came from the outside"" and not to worry because he would ""act as a barrier between us at the mouse"".  ooooooooook sure.  Then not 10 minutes later a little boy walked into the restaurant soliciting for money! He basically went to table to table asking for money and the waiter (who was still standing next to our table guarding us from the mouse) just watched him go from table to table.  I've never seen that happen before but I guess there's a first time for everything.  Not a good look. Would be hard pressed to come back here since I don't think I will be able to get the image of the mouse out of my head...",1,,

You are paying the extra ($58 for chicken, $68 for lamb, $88 for Filet Mignon) for the novelty.Service: 2 stars, I hope this is a growing pain but long waits to get the food and it seems like they try to push everything on you but the Shwarma. We waited well over an hour for our food on a late monday night (10pm). after we had to reorder it (first time, they thought we would choose something else). They said the food would only service 2-3 people and with four, we still had leftovers. It was also very hot inside on a cool night.Overall: 3/3.5: I would get hummus to go here or maybe take someone here who has a lot of time and wants the experience.

It is Ramadan so I know it might be busier for them. After being seated our order was taken after 20 minutes and that was from my friend calling the waitress herself. Once you order it is expected that wait time would be about 40-50 min because they make the shawarma fresh. The flavors were phenomenal. We got the Chicken Shawarma which was really juicy and not dry at all! We didn't even need white sauce! The fries were really flavorful too. We also had the platter with a bunch of different things in it like filet mignon, kebabs, rice, bread and fries! The meat was all cooked to perfection I will say that! The wait is the only down side. We ordered Hummus for appetizer which was also good. If you don't mind waiting definitely go for the experience!",,,

As a party of 9, we ordered a bunch of dishes to share. Usually there's hit or miss items but for the most part, we were quite content with the food and left with full bellies. Would recommend the dips tray sampler, fried cauliflower in tahini sauce, grilled kafta platter and definitely the chicken shawarma (very tender) served tableside that comes with fries, pita and different sauces-the whole shebang. If you order the chicken shawarma alone, it's enough for 2-3 ppl. The brioche french toast with nutella was a nice sweet complement to our meal. We also got the shakshuka (good), manakeesh za'atar (salty) and this other flatbread with meat which was super spicy. Good, but it triggered my sweat glands.

Not once were we rushed to order especially since the final person in our party was 20 minutes late. We order the lamb shawarma which was incredible. I've seen mixed reviews about this place.

We had reservations for 10:30 and seated at 11:15. Waiter didn't greet us until 11:30, took our order and never saw the waiter again. Our food took awhile to come out, and we can accept that, but we asked several people for water refills which was not refilled. The lack of communication was horrendous. Our food wasn't even out yet and our table was cleared and we were given dessert menus. Finally we asked to see the manager who was the worst human being I've ever met. When we complained that despite asking several servers for help, she had the audacity to line up her servers and ask us to point out who the servers were. We refused to do that. It was so unprofessional and she was so rude to us. No apology. Nothing. It wasn't even that busy at that time, so I'm not sure why it was taking forever! Nothing compensated either, manager said ""well you already ate the food.""  Even though some girls sitting next to us had dessert on the house for whatever terrible service they received. Something about last night was just horrendous. We came to celebrate a birthday, and canceled the rest of the order that still hadn't come out yet. I don't want to throw prejudice in here because it seemed like everything was bad, but we were the only pakistani group there. Food was okay but We will NEVER come back because of this awful manager!

My group had a reservation, to which we were early to. We unfortunately didn't get to sit at the requested tables (outdoors), even though we were early and told we were waiting to be seated in the requested spot. The place was packed and I believe them to be frantic and not really keeping up with that they told their guest. The food was delicious but way too over priced. I ordered the mixed grill plate, for 2. It was a huge plate but underneath all the fries, there was barely any meat. It has two chicken kebabs, two lab kebabs, a long kofta, laying atop some bread, all of which was covered with fries. This would have been good for one, except it was $48! The wait staff was tentative, once we were seated. It's a very crowded place. My elbows bumped the lady next to me, quite a few times.

We sat at our table for at least fifteen minutes before someone asked for our drink order and after the meat arrived at the table, we waited to have it cut.

In addition to the dips, we got the fried cauliflower topped with yogurt, cheese and falafel rolls (found them to be tasty but a bit dry) and also got the sumac fries. The fries were delicious, hot and flavorful--perfectly balanced and covered in spices. For drinks, we got a cherry beer and the mint lemonade. Both were good but the lemonade wasn't that great that I'd get it twice. I'd probably spring for an alcoholic beverage next time.

135,Irsh M.,"Hollis, NY",1,9,6,2.0,8/11/2018,"As sad as this sounds, my experience wasn't as good as the others in this review section. I had a late reservation at Au Za'tar, as I am a huge shawarma fan. Me and a buddy of mine ordered the Filet mignon shawarma, which was priced at $88. Also had the frozen mint lemonade, which was delicious! The reason why I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars is because of the way our food was prepared. Granted we had late reservations, the filet mignon was very undercooked, if not, cooked at all. It tasted extremely raw, I like my beef medium rare as I asked, but this chunk of meat was literally served raw all-around. I mentioned it to our waiter, and he legit took our shawarma to the back, so he can ""re-heat"" it, just to bring it back as if it never left our table (this whole process took about an additional 15 minutes, btw). Me and my friend were really not satisfied with the quality and taste of the meat, and made sure it was known to one of the people that were cleaning our table. He looked at us as if we were the ""complaining"" type customers, and gave us answers like ""All you Indians, Pakistanis, Bengalis, and Afghans, like their steak well done."" Bruh...I'm a big steak eater, and I clearly made sure I made my point known, including the way me and my friend wanted our Filet mignon to be cooked. His answers were all filled with disgust and stubbornness, and he asked if we wanted our raw food packed, so we can properly cook it at home! LOL, SERIOUSLY!?? Idk who does this, but more power to you. All in all, I didn't find my conversation with this person going in a positive direction at all because of his close-minded personality, and attitude on making it seem like people from my country, including our neighbors, all like our steaks cooked well done lol, that's totally not true at all. Anyhow, the experience was terrible, I don't know if I would go back. I strongly feel people go to Au Za'atar just to post ""cute"" pictures on their social media, with their table side shawarmas and nothing else.

Waitress told us lamp shawarma will be ready in 20 to 45 minutes that we already knew it and we said its fine. After waitress took our order, 30 minutes later another waitress who can speak english better came. I think first waitress think she can not have that conversation with her lack of english thats why another one came. She told us lamp shawarma takes 1 hour from now on. We told her that why you are telling us now? This is ramadan, you are selling a halal food thats why we came and we were fasting 18 hours and we already waited 1 more hour to eat that shawarma and you are telling us to wait one more hour. After small discussion with that waitress, i believe he was the owner of restaurant, one guy came and he asked waitress to leave table and he started the conversation with "" WHAT's MATTER GUYSS?"". We politely explained everything again which was not literally necessary i think. Its too much effort to eat piece of meat in a congested restaurant, on a small table and without proper cooling. Literally place was 90 degree. At the end of my explanation, guy just told me "" WE ARE STILL WASTING OUR TIME, ITS GONNA TAKE ONE MORE HOUR, DO YOU WANT IT OR NOT??!!"" Whenever i heard that sentence, i told we are leaving. I believe they became a famous because of their shawarma machine on tables in a short time and owner of the restaurant thinks he is king or sultan in his small restaurant and he thinks he can be rude and arrogant to their costumer. Last year we have been that place too and when we paid the check, waitress asked us more tip which was ridiculous and it was the first time i heard in my entire life.

Then when we were served they gave us the fetteh and some kind of another plate based on chicken. Which I refused. I guess the waiter understood djej (chicken) when I ordered fattet il Batenjan. The same ending. The fetteh was one half coocked slice of eggplant. 1/2"" wide. Mixed in with some concussion of stale bread, hummus and, ready for this, just plain yougurt. Not cooked at all. None dares to make a fetteh like this in Lebanon. And the bread was not even Arabic bread. It was raw 1/3 baked Greek bread. I think they use it to make the manoush. I never had such a terrible pita bread.Now the tables around me all order the shawarma which can on the personal shawarma machine. On my left, the shawarma was burnt on one side. On my left, the shawarma was all dry. I asked the people to confirm it was dry. One guy said no, the other guy said yes. Kind of dry.Then we asked for the check. It was $32 and change including a $2.50 tax. So I figured $32.xx + 2.5x + $5 tips. So I left them 2 $20 bills. Then I took my son to the bathroom before we left. The waiter followed us to the bathroom asking if I wanted some  change back or if this includes the tips. I said no, keep it alll. Very lousy staffThese people are a disgrace to the Lebanese cuisine. But the place was full of millennia's who obviously don't know anything  good Lebanese Food.",,,

My friends and I ordered the spicy hummus which isn't too spicy but the heat accumulated over time. They refilled our pita bread and also gave us a sample of za'atar and cheese which was great. I ordered the Kafta burger, which was surprisingly not too gamey considering it is part lamb and beef. I think the best part are their fries and the dip that comes with it. Would highly recommend the grilled herb salmon as well that my friend ordered.",,,

The atmosphere is very cozy and well decorated.I'm a huge fan of hummus, and their Hummus Bi Shwarma is one of my favs! It's a full plate of hummus topped with chicken, olive oil, and garnishing. Their pita is on point! They give a very generous amount, which is always very warm, soft, and fluffy. They have always given me refills for no extra charge. I've also tried the Middle Eastern Breakfast, which comes with a small salad, labne, sunny side up eggs, and pita. Overall, it was a filling portion for brunch, but relatively standard. I think I'll be sticking to the hummus dishes.",2,1,

We were two, they served us complementary pita bread with Za'atar which was delicious!for appetizer we got the Halloumi cheese it was really tasty, make sure you eat it with the tomatoes and the cucumbers!For main course, we chose to go with the beef Shawerma, I would say it is enough for 2 people (just don't fill urself up with the fries) for 3 people it may or may not be enough... we were two and were able to finish most of it... one note on the seasoning, it would have been perfectly seasoned if they hadn't added too much of the cardamoms; oh and if you want it juicy and not dried out, make sure you slice it early on!For Desert, we had the rice pudding, I wasn't a big fan of the ""jasmine"" like tase in it but oh well the ambient and the hospitality made my experience much more valuable than worrying about disliking the taste of one item.. when i go back ill just order a different desert",,,

Little did we know he'd be our waiter, and that we'd be here for an hour instead of our intended 30 min. It was such an enjoyable happy hour/dinner for us, particularly because the funny overly enthusiastic man who told us we could get out within 30 minutes, gave both of us glasses of wine on the house. We ordered some Arnabeet Mekle (cauliflower with spices-delish), the kafka and chicken kabobs-which took a lot longer than they shou'dve, but the kafka and flatbread particularly won my heart.

One call at 6:20 telling them I will be late due to traffic, they told me no problem. I called again at 6:45 telling them I will be there in 5 mins and they said not to worry they will save my table. I arrived at 6:50pm and they gave away my table. Worst of all they have zero professionalism. The hostess told me it will be a 20 min wait... which turned into a 50 min wait. So I finally get seated at 7:40. No one comes to take our order for 10-15 mins. Even tho I put it in my notes of my reservation that I will be ordering the shawarma, once I finally ordered at 8pm they inform me that it'll be 25-45 min wait for shawarma. So now finally at 8:45pm I finally get to eating. Food is mediocre. Basic at best. This place is amazing if you are a  basic b*tch who just chases the next social media craze.",,,
154,Shennel N.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,13,1,3.0,7/15/2018,"My friends and I dined here last night. The food was superb but the guest recovery was lacking. We were a party of four and requested an outside table. I want to mention that the hostess who was standing outside was extremely sweet and accommodating. Everything was going well up until I mentioned that the sandwich that I ordered never came out. When I first mentioned it to the server she seemed to not know what I was talking about (and that's understandable because it was a busy Saturday night and keeping track of everyone's order is almost impossible) however, when she did address it there was no apology (which is rule #1) and she said she would take it off the bill (Well of course you are, I never received it) Anyway, at this point I'm still a happy guest because I was quite full from the small plates. Next, the back waiter begins clearing our plates so I assumed they were just prebussing the table so that the server could drop a dessert menu but no we were handed the check. And I actually wanted to enjoy dessert and coffee. I understand that it's a Saturday night but all steps of service should be hit before dropping the check and if you double book a table you should inform the party you're seating that ""this table has another reservation booked for (inserts time) you have (inserts duration period) to dine"" so that you avoid making the guest feel rushed in any way.",,,

A little disappointing that there were only four jumbo shrimp but the fries was so delicious that it made up for it!

159,Daniel T.,"New York, NY",3,19,1,3.0,5/2/2018,"If you're reading this, you probably know that this establishment was featured by Insider for its tableside shawarma. There is no doubt that this shawarma is visually spectacular. There is also no doubting the authenticity of the Lebanese ownership and staff and their recipes. I have significant quibbles with the execution. Hummus and Baba Ghanouj - the hummus was flavored well but it literally looked almost dried on the plate. It looked like it had been sitting in a tub in the fridge in the back. Definitely not made fresh. The baba ghanouj was again correctly flavored but the ground eggplant tasted stale, it's notes muted.Finally the tableside beef shawarma. Our waiter informed us it would be close to an hour wait which is truly horrific. When it showed up, it was cooked halfway and the skewer was not rotating. I asked the waiter and he said ""sometimes it rotates, sometimes it doesn't."" So basically he told us it was broken. The girl who came to cut the thing butchered it so poorly I am convinced I could have done a better job. The meat was again flavorful but undercooked in spots and the cuts of beef were clearly not prime. Overall, I am willing to forgive the atrociously bad service which took forever to check on us because we did have fun. This is a meal you will instagram for the ""experience"" but I won't be going back for the food especially at the price point charger. NYC has better Lebanese and soon this gimmick will wear off.",2,,

The flavor of the chicken shawarma is really good, tastes fresh and seasoned perfectly, fries were cold and in the soggy side, was probably sitting out before It made it to our table. I also order the halloume cheese and the filet mignon kebab which I didn't have the pleasure to enjoy because it made it to our table after the check only because I reminded the waitress that those two items never came. So food 3 Star, service MAJOR disappointment, and they don't even care. Go to try the shawarmas and wow guests but don't expect good service!",,,

Updated review","The service here is awful! Probably the worst service I've received in a NY restaurant. We had to ask for things several times, we got up a few times to chase down a waiter, they never brought some items we ordered - it was like they'd never run a restaurant before. The food was just as bad as the service. The food was so salty and I had to ask several times for our wine. I had ordered lemonade which I never received. Everything about our meal was a challenge or salty and WAY OVERPRICED. We told the server three times how to split the check and he still got it completely wrong. We were so annoyed with this place we just paid the bill and left. So disappointed. I really wanted to like this place. The worst part is when we mentioned our issues to the staff - they were rude and dismissive. Never going back.",2,,
162,Erica R.,"Tarpon Springs, FL",158,25,1,1.0,4/28/2018,What a bunch of assholes. Told us to wait at bar then manager tried to fight us because we waited at bar. They told the person i was with they were going to split his shit. How professional. That's what happens i guess when you try to eat at a middle eastern place in America. Stay away unless you want to be physically and verbally assaulted by Muslims.  I've never been so insulted or disrespected in my life.,1,1,

164,Tanisha P.,"Vernon Township, NJ",0,45,30,3.0,4/9/2018,"I'm giving this place three stars for easily fixable issues. We went yesterday and got the shawarma for our table. I mentioned what we were getting before we got there and we were still placed at a table for two right next to the skids on the wall decor. A couple of things, we had a bag with us which meant we had to turn sideways to eat and not bang our heads on the wall decor. We had to pull the shawarma out from the wall so the top pepper didn't rub against the wall decor. Then all the sauces and plates came, which meant we had to hurry and finish our appetizers because there was absolutely no room. My husband dropped a piece of meat in his drink because of the lack of room. It took away from our meal and was so silly and simple. I mentioned we needed a bigger table, but the waiter said they didn't have any other tables. They absolutely did, because we were looking at a table that a couple had left for over 30 minuets that was much larger than ours, and they had the same meal. My husbands meat wound up being a little dry, but mines was good. The little issues aside, the meal was great. But don't stick people who will have more than appetizers at a table so small wedged jnto the corner. A family came with a baby and it made our seating even tighter and the wife at that table was flipping her hair practically on top of our food...ew. We will return because the food was good, but they will have to accommodate our simple request of a larger table.",2,1,

We were seated by the host and it took the waitress 30 mins to come to greet us and take our order. After we placed our order that was the last we ever saw of our waitress. We wanted to order more food and drinks and every time we asked  to place an order for drinks we were ignored. Our water was not getting refilled as well. our food did not come out all at the same time when we requested to do so. Our table was cleaned before everyone's food even arrived and another waiter handed us a desert menu and walked away. We flagged down another waiter to let them know we are still waiting for food and  they reset the table setting. At that point I asked for the manager. A women name EMI came out and rather then being apologetic was very defensive. she literally lined up her waitstaff and asked me to point out everyone that ignored us. I told her that she was making me feel very uncomfortable and she was not handling the matter professionally. she told me that' show she handles business. she implied that since i did not point out the wait staff that ignored us i was lying. Never in my dining experiences has something like this every happened to me. she ruined a birthday party and i will never go back to this restaurant again.

There are entrees available as well though. The place also has a nice atmosphere - fairly dark, spacious, and good for dinner conversation. I got the Gratinee Onion Soup ($8) and the Arnabeet Bi Tarator (fried cauliflower with parsley tahini sauce topped with toasted pine nuts, $15).

The food was okay, but the staff were so rude to us - they essentially ruined our night.The lamb was dry, and the portions were really small and not worth the price. The main attraction was the tableside shawarma but it was more of a gimmick than quality or volume. We ordered it for dinner, and about 40 minutes later the owner comes to us and yells at us, saying they do not have any left. We ask him for other similar meal options, and also why it took 40 minutes after ordering to tell us our dish is unavailable, and the guy flips out at us. We tell him we came for the tableside shawarma, and if it is not available, we will pay for our appetizers and leave. We were a party of 10, so he, all of the sudden, says it will be available in about 20 minutes. 40 minutes later he comes out with out food, looks at my friend and yells at one of us, and hits her with ""Are you happy now? Your food is here so start smiling."" At this point we were stuck in the restaurant and and couldn't really leave as we already invested so much time (about an hour and a half) and the food was finally here. We were also given the wrong platter, but we did not want to speak to the staff any more than we had to.I will never dine here again.

YOU CAN BUY IT FROM A CART! WHY ARE WE ALL DOING THIS TO OURSELVES? But it was a friend's birthday, so I kept my thoughts to myself. We did not get the shawarma thing everyone is yelling about because it was really expensive, serves 2 people, and is surrounded by a moat of the mushiest French fries on the planet (the French fries came on ours, so I can attest firsthand). We got a mixed grill kebab thing which was pretty good and a huge dip sampler which was awesome. However, they gave us 8 triangles of pita. For six people who had ordered the giant dip sampler! MAJOR side eye from the inattentive staff. Also my boyfriend got hit in the head by a waiter's hips or ass cheeks every 11 seconds because THOSE TABLES ARE WAY TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.Overall, the food (including the falafel and that red pepper dip) is tasty but only slightly better than the Mediterranean that is standard issue everywhere, but you can't hear your friends over the din and you have to be ok with random butts grazing your head the whole time. Maybe sit outside if you can get a table there.",,,

Waiter said he had to ask hostess, hostess gave a bitchy didn't care attitude and said those tables are reserved. We had a reservation as well lady. There were about 5 tables empty at the time. Didn't argue with her or push it but we weren't happy about it (never been to a restaurant where they refuse your request for a dumb excuse like that). Spent 20 minutes looking at the menu with no waiter checking on us. It was our first time at a lebanese restaurant & I tried to call a waiter over 3 times but it went ignored so we had to yelp on our own. I finally WAIVED DOWN the waiter for her to come take our orders. She was helpful & patient. I appreciated that. The 1 star would probably be for her and the food. The food was pretty good but I just couldn't enjoy it because of how we were treated in the beginning. In the end, we asked to just take the cake to go without pulling it out because we were uncomfortable in the middle of the restaurant.

183,Danny H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,2,5.0,12/8/2017,"This place is a hidden gem! The food is fresh and flavorful. Highly recommend. Great choice for groups or romantic date. Service was friendly and accommodating. Appetizers are all delicious: tabouli, spicy hummus, baba ganoush, Halloumi cheese, were all amazing. Favorite appetizer was definitely the Za'atar spice and sesame seeds on the pita bread with a cheese/yogurt dipping sauce.For the entrees we got the baby Lamb chops and chicken kebab dish both served with fresh vegetables. Both were excellent. And to top it off, after dinner we had a White cafe, almost like a white / clear tea which was the perfect way to cleanse our palette. Will definitely return with friends and family.",,,
184,Shiv A.,"Monmouth Junction, NJ",0,8,0,5.0,8/26/2018,Absolutely amazing. The table side shawarma was the best shawarma I've ever had. All the food had great homemade and authentic flavors. The owner is incredibly nice too. The two deserts we got was the orange blossom pudding and assorted baklava and both were out of this world.,,,
185,Husky N.,"Manhattan, NY",0,38,42,4.0,6/7/2017,"Came here for brunch while walking around on a Saturday.  Service was great and quick. It had a very limited selection of beer, but a lot of different wines. I had the Grilled Kafta Meat, Poached eggs, Spicy Moroccan Sauce. It tasted great with just the right amount of spices.Instagram: HUSKY.NYC",,,
186,David E.,"New York, NY",341,19,0,3.0,6/8/2018,"I went to this restaurant last evening.  I took an early reservation because it was pretty much the only time left.  We had an isolated table to the side which kind of gave us our own little niche,like our own small dining room.  Naturally we ordered the schwarma platter with lamb. Apparently you can't order schwarma just like a regular order; you have to order this massive grill to your table with your own personal schwarma grill.  And it is great and it is fun. The waitress expertly cut our meat.  The meat was succulent and tasty and we made our own schwarma sandwiches replete with the multiple sauces they brought us. We ate way too many fries cuz they were so good. The bill for our schwarma grill with lamb was $78.   Now that's basically a $39 schwarma per person.  Was it good? Absolutely!  But was it $39 good?  Hmmmm.   Maybe not.  I love this type of food and I'm happy this restaurant exists.  Yes, it's an experience, and you can't help but post a few pics on social media.  But you also kind of feel like it's way overpriced.",,,

188,Mental O.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,1,4.0,4/29/2018,"I was recommended by good friends to try this place out but their only complaint was the wait time for the food to be prepared. Though from  prior reviews I read stating they run out of food quickly here, and you need to place special orders in advance. So after learning this, I made reservations and put in my special request. When I made my way to the restaurant to find a long waiting line out the door. I discovered that this establishment is pretty small with small tables, and tight seating arrangements. Anyway I bypass the line and walked in to find no host or manager by the front door, people on the line probably thought that I was trying to skip them by the looks on their faces. However, I didn't know they were just walk ins trying to get a table, but the place was all booked. Their tables had up to a hour waiting period for indoors and outdoors seating. When I announced that I had reservations and was on time, the overwhelmed manager quickly honored my table request and made my date and I, feel real comfortable. I asked for a special dished off the menu and they placed it for me. They also said  it was going to be a little while before we get our meal, but I didn't care; even though, my order came out within thirty minutes, not too bad for what I ordered. Which was the special grilled platter with all the works. The food was outstanding and for the price it was very reasonable to me. I've been to a lot of restaurants and had food that priced didn't match. But here you do get your money worth and more. Please do your self a favor and visit this place. So many European and Middle-eastern countries makes the same dishes, but only a few has real flavor and this spot is very flavored.",,,
189,Moe A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,5,2,5.0,8/21/2018,Amazing middle eastern food. The shawarma was the best I have tried in all of New York. The staff was extremely nice. Highly recommended spot my new go to for real authentic shawarma!,,,
190,Nicholas A R.,"New York, NY",207,46,45,2.0,3/18/2018,"Disappointing. I called in an order for takeout at 6:08 P.M. and was told to pick it up at 6:40. I showed up a few minutes before 6:40, paid, and left with my food. I live less than 5 minutes away. When I opened the food, I was disappointed at the amount of food for the cost. $25 for a platter that included 7 chunks of chicken, rice, a few vegetables, and flat bread. You can get the same amount of food at Hummus and Pita Co. for around $13.00. Even worse, the chicken was dry and barely luke warm, the haloumi was not hot, and the fried cauliflower was cold and soggy. It was as if they prepared the order immediately when I called and let it sit for 30 minutes, which is the amount of time they told me to wait to come pick it up. Ultimately, I think the food is wildly overpriced for the amount you get, which is an issue that won't be solved by how or when it is cooked. $13.00 for a side of cauliflower? $13.75 for three slices of haloumi? $25 for a single serving of chicken and rice? I expected more.",,,
191,Shakil S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,4/22/2018,The receptionist was super rude with us. We came on Sunday mid afternoon and gave us the table outside with 4 kids blaring sun on our face. I tried talking to the receptionist about getting a table inside and he told me go spend time with your family in the rudest possible way and super loud about it. We drove from CT to try this place. Inside the restaurant was half empty. His expression and manner of speaking was unprofessional. We ordered our food and canceled went another place same area and the food was great. I recommend people to try other restaurant than this place and avoid being harassed and put down.,,,
192,Waheda I.,"Queens Village, NY",92,253,398,4.0,2/27/2016,I found this place through a suggestion from Menu pages. I decided to go here before I had class. I have to say it's so empty earlier in the day. I was their first customer! The place looks like a little snug den you find in movies. All that was missing was a fireplace. It was beautiful! I took the spot by the window and was immediately greeted by the waiter. I tried to make small talk. He was pretty nice.On to food. OMFG. GET. THE. CAULIFLOWER! THAT WAS FUCKING AMAZING. I've always been a fan of foods flavored lightly with herbs and citrus. This dish did exactly that. You get a punch of that lemon flavor and it was remarkable. I could have eaten 5 plateful of solely that and been satisfied. No regrets whatsoever. The next dish was couscous with lots of vegetables. I don't think I'm a fan of couscous. The vegetables were delicious and hearty. But the couscous was just something not of my preference. I had a cappuccino to finish. It wasn't sweetened but the drink itself was very smooth. The type of drink that just makes you want to sit by the window for an hour not worrying about your upcoming class (follow me? Lol)I can't wait to go back. Drag a friend over just to brag about my exquisite restaurant choices. Go! Be it alone or with a friend. The food is amazing,1,1,1
193,Shazia L.,"New York, NY",98,14,2,2.0,10/17/2018,"I am actually very disappointed in this place. I went for my sisters birthday tonight - party of 8. We spent over $300. And I'm just looking at the menu and reviews and feeling frustrated. Firstly, the host at the door was fantastic, which is why two stars, but our server was not. We kept having to get his attention or he would rush away and not come back. But most importantly, we didn't get many menu options given to us. No dip tray menu options, no mezze dips offered to us. No free pita bread. Nothing. We asked for extra sides of rice that we would pay for and never got it. And to top it off, we got the filet mignon shawarma tableside feature and it tasted funny. The bill said beef tableside and we asked if this was the same, server said yes but now I'm learning the beef and filet mignon are different. We paid $88 for the wrong thing! There's nothing worse than ruining a birthday or event with poor service, uninformed staff with limited menu availability and wrong orders. The free bread part might piss me off the most though, like seriously, just gonna not give the bread? Really? Don't go here. You can get much better service for the money.",,,
194,Joseph S.,"Hesperia, MI",0,1,0,5.0,2/4/2018,Excellent food! Definitely the place to be! You don't wanna miss the fatoush salad and the chicken kabab.Knafeh is awesome!!!!,1,,

198,Josey A.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,8/12/2018,The food and service were amazing! I went with my parents who are well traveled and  they enjoyed the authenticity of the food and presentation.  We ordered the shawarma with a few appetizers and it was all amazing and reminded them of when they were traveling in the Middle East.  Everyone was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a great experience!,,,
