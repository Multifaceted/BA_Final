Sorry, this sounds like an airbnb review, but the food was also good too. Surprisingly, was impressed with the bibimbap and pizza. Quinoa in bibimbap - saves me the trip to sweetgreen!!",1,,2
1,Carrie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",533,293,1896,2.0,11/16/2018,"It's unfortunate how underwhelming this restaurant was. Everything was mediocre at best. I had hopes for this place to serve an amazing meal. The menu seemed like pages of foodgasms. I kept telling myself how I would have to come back again to try all the items on the menu but I left highly disappointed and hungry. I thought I had chosen the perfect place to enjoy dinner and catch up with my friends. I left embarrassed and unsatisfied. The best thing on their menu is probably their soy garlic wings but they give you so little for the price you pay. The Uni Risotto was the most disappointing. The risotto just tasted wrong in so many ways and the ingredients and flavors were just not mixing on the palette. Kudos to my friends that stuffed it down quietly so I won't feel regretful for ordering it. Bari's favorite pasta was just ordinary. The pasta comes comes in a very small portion of linguine, bulgogi and foie gras. Not memorable at all. The shishito pepper side came with only four pieces.The drinks were so watered down and flat. I question if there's any alcohol in the there. Another disappointing thing? Their mule does not come in a tip cup. What?Overall, the service was good. Our server was sweet, and friendly. I couldn't bear to tell her how awful the meal was.  The restaurant itself was beautiful but the food and cocktails seriously falls short.",2,2,
2,Belle L.,"New York, NY",174,252,301,4.0,11/15/2018,"I came here last night after my boyfriend made a reservation to celebrate a new job offer. We made the reservation for 6 PM and when we arrived there was a group at the bar and we were the only ones seated in the main dining area. The waiter was very friendly and talkative and had great recommendations to what my boyfriend should order.Once we sat down and wanted to order the Happy Hour food menu, our waiter informed us that we would have to sit at the bar in order to receive that. (Why wasn't this listed anywhere on the website to begin with?) This part left a bad taste in my mouth since I was really looking forward to the Happy Hour prices and considering it was for a celebration, I did not want to move to the bar area in comparison to the booths. I ordered the lime fizz drink whereas my boyfriend ordered the passion fruit.Let's move on to the food. We decided to order the fish sashimi which came out relatively fast and I did enjoy the flavors and taste to it. I decided to order the Uni Bi Bim Bap and my boyfriend ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice and per our waiter's choice went with crispy bacon.Once our food arrived, I was surprised with the portions. Considering the price we paid for the dishes, it was relatively small. When my Uni Bi Bim Bap came, I was also surprised. It looked nothing like a Bi Bim Bap and sadly, I was disappointed. I quickly devoured my small portion and waited until my boyfriend finished his. From the minute we got seated to when we left was about 30 minutes. The waiter probably noticed my disappointment and quickly brought out our check.The only reason why I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars is because the waiter was extremely friendly and understanding despite my disappointment.",1,1,2
3,Kunal T.,"New York, NY",308,206,181,5.0,11/12/2018,"The Bari is such a gem in East Village! I walked in and the ambiance is amazing high ceilings, booths across the wall, and the perfect ambiance for any occasion. For the menu I would recommend the seabass, pork belly, Wagyu Beed Carpaccio, The Bari Noodles (MUSTTT TRYYYYY), Seafood Rice Cakes and then top it all of with the Season and Cream Dessert. If you are going with a small group you have to try the Bari Noodles thats what they're famous for and it will leave you with a smile. I would recommend going during happy hour time - you are getting every 40-50% off and old fashioned drinks are only $8. I def want to go back and try the other items. Would highly recommend it for a date or just for a large group looking to catch up.",1,,1
4,Racheal D.,"Brooklyn, NY",625,217,447,4.0,10/21/2018,"I am always down to eat Korean food and stumbled upon The Bari on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I made a reservation for 2 and arrived promptly. We were seated quickly but soon found out if we wanted to order from the happy hour menu, we had to sit by the bar so we switched seats (not a big deal) - IF YOU ARE ORDERING FROM THE HAPPY HOUR MENU, ASK THE HOST TO SIT YOU BY THE BAR (pretty small area though).We ordered 12 oysters ($12) and a plate of pork belly ($7) from the happy hour menu. The oysters were pretty good but very small in size. The pork belly had a very interesting sauce on top and it was really good!I ordered the Truffle Mushroom Risotto ($20) as entree. The portion is small so beware! The dish however was super flavorful. The truffle flavor was definitely strong! My friend ordered the Seafood Udon ($20). This came in a soup form with shrimps, claims, mussels, and calamaris. This was very flavorful as well.I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant - very romantic and smooth sort of feel. The restaurant itself is very spacious too. The bathrooms are extremely clean and BIG. I have no complaints about the service here either - they seem pretty attentive and made sure our glasses are always full with water.I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu!",3,,2
5,Elisa H.,"New York, NY",1674,521,981,5.0,10/7/2018,"The entrance and foyer is not telling of what aesthetics lied beyond. Right away I am taken aback by the height of the pillars in a long vacuous dining room neutrally set in soft grey, white and marble. To the immediate left, the dining is made into semi private, arched booths versus vertical arrangements of tables to the right. Distended from above were clusters of giant balls of light that gave modern whimsy to clean minimalism. I was seated right away to my choosing of a booth. Even though attention was minutely, I felt like a small child in a big factory because the booths were logically designed for 6-8 people. I elected ""the missing link"" cocktail. It really was the missing link to my ""arsenal"" of boutique cocktails. So prettily layered with a twig of smoked thyme, I didn't know if I wanted to spoon it or drink it. That doesn't matter because it was so.dam.good. I'd almost forgot it's fourteen dollars. Then came ""the Charlie Brown"" that looked like a pumpkin parfait and tasted if it indeed had a baby with Bulleit. I think Dan, the bartender must know a thing or two about cocktails. We sampled their spicy wings insisted upon by Jay, Bari's GM whose casual and soft demeanor made him an instant hit at our table. The wings were plump and crisp, dressed with a perfect amount of sweet garlic soy sauce boasting a spice level that a spicy food lover must respect. You got me at ""s.p.i.c.y.w.i.n.g.s."" B. Then came the game-changer. The Bulgogi toast. I cannot say enough. It's a twist on a classic in the most salivating, satiating way. If you enjoy K-bbq meats and have asked yourself why it took this long for them to come up with avocado toast- you have to get this. The katsudon was generous but lacked citrous and sweet  sauce. Yes the egg slurry and pork was cooked perfectly but I just needed something... more. Perhaps the first 2 courses set the bar way high. Jay presented us with a wagyu carpaccio in shoyu. It was melt in your mouth tender with a healthy dose of olive oil and lemon juice. Sliced impossibly thin, it was akin to eating mouthfuls of meat flavored cotton candy. Now if only someone can invent a machine to do that I can see a line out the door. By virtue of the friendliest staff in all of Noho- Lenny, chef de cuisine whom we also met, would not let us leave without quenching our sweet tooth. Jay educated us about ""gangjeong"" traditional Korean sweets that inspired their take on black sesame nut brittle with fresh whipped cream, strawberries, almonds and dried cranberries. Not my thing because I am a (chocolate) cake devotee but we definitely appreciated the concept and without a doubt, the hospitality. So The Bari is a little known gem (for now) in the jungle that is the NYC restaurant scene. Go and enjoy the ambiance, the food, and the incredible service from the top guy to the delightful bar if you can find it. If you blink, you might miss it.",7,3,9
6,Patricia C.,"Manhattan, NY",133,255,1297,2.0,9/14/2018,"Space is beautiful, service is impeccable, but what they really need to work on is their food. I feel like the menu is confused, and it might be better for them to either do a complete fusion menu, or stick to one cuisine. I hear they even serve omakase?We were there to celebrate a birthday so it was pretty disappointing when the food wasn't that great. We were so excited to see so much uni, truffle, and foie gras on the menu but there were only a few standout dishes, these are what we tried:Plum Ginger Octopus $18 (golden beets, pickled radish, mango and onion)Yum, this was cooked really well - octopus was nice and tender. The presentation was also really pretty.Hamachi Sashimi with Spicy Ponzu $18 (radish, jalapeno, homemade gochujang sauce)Not bad, but nothing special. Pretty standard sashimi/ceviche dish. I would spend $18 on something else.Bari Pasta $26 (bulgogi, seared and diced foie gras)This is what everyone raves about and I have to say this was pretty delicious! The only downfall is that this was rather a small portion for $26. If it's an entree, it should be entree size. This is not as creamy as I imagined it to be, but it might be a good thing as sometimes foie gras items tend to be overly heavy. This, you can eat a lot of!Bulgogi Truffle Udon $23 (truffle pate, bokchoy, mushroom)To be honest, I don't quite remember this dish...which probably goes to show how much I liked it. If you want udon, go to tsurutontan!Braised Short Rib $34 (honey-soy braised galbi, shiitake, carrot, roasted chestnut)Meh, this was not tender enough...I honestly have had better in one of those Korean deli buffets.Cauliflower Steak $22 (cajun spiced cauliflower with grilled brussels sprouts and broccoli, orange miso aioli and mango puree)This was the worst dish we got. Nothing was cooked nor seasoned properly. The brussels sprouts were so underdone that it was so hard to bit into. The aioli and puree also didn't go very well with the vegetables...Uni Risotto $30 (arborio rice & farro duet, california uni, black tobiko, white truffle oil)This had so much potential to be an amazing dish. I don't think the use of farro was a good idea... it made the dish quite bland and not creamy/rich/warm, which is exactly what you would expect from the ingredients. I would much rather them have a nicely cooked risotto with some puffed farro on top. Looks like a big portion in pictures, but it's actually not in person :( There was also literally only one long piece of uni on there (or maybe 2...but not enough for $30!!!)...sighThey have such a beautiful big space, I hope their food can improve to match it!",3,,
7,Juey W.,"Brooklyn, NY",11,19,44,1.0,10/15/2018,"The Bari is not the place to go if you're looking to a good night out over good food and drinks with your friends. Thanks for ruining my best friend's birthday, Michael.  Now, this is not a bias review over some personal vendetta against our server Michael even though his service towards our party factors in leading to this review, this is solely my own personal opinion regarding this establishment.I really wanted to like this place, it has all of the qualities of  a modernesque boutique restaurant; marble tables, hanging chandelier lighting, plants and all. Props to their interior designer/contractor. Their menu offers what all the foodies drool and dream of, truffle, wagyu, key items that would bait people to come out of their caves just to try. However all of this is just a sham. Going forward, they have a wide menu selection. Offering Korean American fusion cuisine along with some sushi. Out of all the dishes shared amongst us. We all agreed the only item we liked was the Crab Truffle Cut Roll. Think an avocado cucumber roll topped with canned blue crab and a tiny pinch of truffle. $19 a pop. Basically a fancier California roll. Now, that's a classic. We tried their uni bibimbap and we came to a consensus that Barn Joo's was much better in comparison. Bari's Uni bibimbap has multicolor tobiko, seaweed rice and two pieces of uni. Why call it a bibimbap and not a uni rice bowl? Traditional bibimbap has varietal vegetables (seasoned/pickled) mixed in with the rice. The Bari's version was bland and I didn't find any pickled root vegetables in there as stated in their menu. The Bari Pasta was too heavily creamed which overpowers any foie gras in that pasta, if any. the ""bulgogi"" beef in there was too tough. Think overcooked sliced beef in shabu shabu/ hotpot.The Wagyu Beef Katsu was acceptable at best. The crust was falling apart from the Katsu, and the wagyu did not melt in the mouth which made me doubtful if it was even wagyu.The Herb Roasted Bone Marrow, was roasted to the point in which what they really served us was two pieces of bone topped with kimchi to disguise the missing marrow . We were trying so hard to scrape for marrow and couldn't find any. The sour dough was not even toasted or warmed which did not pair well with the kimchi. The combination was just off.If the service was a-okay and we had a good time, maybe we wouldn't feel like the food was as horrendous. A couple drinks down, and I wouldn't even pay as close attention to food details. But the service was just as horrendous. Allow me to elaborate.Forget the sarcastic attitude the server had towards our party during the duration of our dining because he has ""other tables to tend to"". As if we were not as equivalent to his other tables. Forget the server charging us for desserts we did not order for the birthday girl. No big deal. We'll pay. At that point we just wanted to get out of this disastrous place. They had the audacity to include 20% gratuity in a new bill for the ""phenomenal"" service AFTER the fact we all paid and signed our bills and was planning to leave average 15% cash tip for this shit hole. Poor excuse was they forgot to include the 20% for parties of 6 and over which is their restaurant policy. I questioned the manager where is it that it stated on their menus nor anywhere at the restaurant made be known to all their guests/diners about this policy. The manager nodded and agreed it is not made known to their guests. As a restauranteur myself, I would never treat my guests in such a shamful way. You can not enforce a rule that is unstated. Best of luck, the Bari.",5,,1
8,Camille P.,"Bergenfield, NJ",0,5,2,2.0,11/16/2018,"The food was delicious and came out considerably fast. But the waiter messed up and served us the wrong order. The waiter apologized and it's understandable that mistakes can be made. However, it took another 20 minutes after my friends entrée came out (her food was already finished before I got mine) and there was nothing complimentary offered for the inconvenience which I think is unusual especially for an upscale restaurant. We asked about what they did with the wrong order they served our table, and they said they threw it away.  Wasteful.",,,
9,Becky S.,"Auraria, Denver, CO",65,83,217,4.0,10/12/2018,"Cute ambiance! I loved all the furnishing in the store! Came in for a very late bite so there wasn't a wait and we got served right away. We ordered the kimchi bone marrow and the bulgogi pasta. The  pasta was a very small portion but full of flavor. It was was my favorite dish. I love bone marrow but I wish there was something to offset the very savory and heavy taste. Like jam to make it sweet and savory or some kind of pickle to cleanse the palate. I love the kimchi bone marrow concept tho, Defiantly different than other places.",1,1,1
10,Selena Y.,"Jersey City, NJ",105,422,1424,4.0,8/15/2018,"I only came for pre-dinner drinks, but the restaurant was very welcoming and the service was fantastic throughout. I was actually surprised at how large and open the restaurant space felt, and the decor here was both modern and charming.Almost all of the cocktails on the menu were unique with a fun Asian twist to them. I ordered the Benjamin's Brew (gin, hojicha, honey tincture, lemon, sesame seeds, midori) and really enjoyed it. The sesame seeds was an interesting topping but it strangely worked!Overall a nice spot. I'll be back to try their food.",1,,1
11,Sarah C.,"New York, NY",358,104,116,4.0,7/28/2018,"Let me just start off by saying the moment I walked in I was taken aback by how intimate and charming the decor of the place was. I really liked the light fixtures they had! I came here with my friend and our waiter was super helpful and so sweet. We were being so indecisive about drinks and he was very willing to work with us. He also gave us all of his recommendations and tried catering it to our tastes. I would say the service of this place is A+.The food was also DELICIOUS. I wish I had more! To start, my friend and I got the crispy tofu and shiitake and it was crunchy and jam packed with flavor. The crispy and chewy texture really complemented each other well. I just wish the serving size was bigger. For my entree, I ordered the truffle mushroom risotto which was cooked to perfection. It was just such a small portion. Overall, I loved the atmosphere of this place, the food was all very well thought out and cooked to perfection, and the service was phenomenal, it was just very expensive for the fact that I left the place still pretty hungry.",2,1,1
12,Karen R.,"New York, NY",541,131,115,5.0,10/10/2018,"The Bari is hands down my favorite Korean restaurant in East Village. The food, service and interior all deserve five stars! My friend and I tried several items on the menu: -Kimchi bone marrow: Definitely a must buy! The bone marrow is beautifully paired with kimchi. It's a little heavy, so definitely split with friends so you have room in your stomach. -Soy Garlic Fried Chicken: Perfectly fried and seasoned! It's a great appetizer because the fried chicken pieces aren't too big. -Wagyu Beef Carpaccio: Nice, light way to kick off the meal. I split one serving with my friend and finished my half in one bite. The flavors are incredible. -Short Rib: Another great dish to share. The meat is served in a bowl of broth which preserves all of the great flavors. -Mushroom Truffle Udon: I was hesitant to try this one since I'm not a huge fan of truffle. I was pleasantly surprised with the truffle and how it was more subtle than I expected: -Spicy Rice Cakes: I don't recall the actual name of this dish, but I would definitely ask your waiter about it. It's especially great if you're into spicy foods! -Sesame and Cream Dessert: Again, don't remember the exact name but you should ask your waiter about this dessert! It's sweet, light and the perfect way to end the meal. I can't believe my friend and I ate all of this in one sitting and still had room for dessert?? It was seriously so good - I can't wait to go back (maybe this weekend??)",1,,1
13,Natalie T.,"Markham, Canada",160,170,633,1.0,11/2/2018,"As tourists from Toronto, I cannot wholeheartedly give this place a rating higher than 1 star for our group's horrible experience here. I highly recommend you reconsider even if service is not a huge thing for you.When we got there, first impressions were good-   place is beautiful and menu looks intriguing. We got there during their happy hour, so $5 beer was a great deal. We all found it quite dim, so some of us even had to light a flashlight on the menu. I ask the server for recommendation for a sweet fruity cocktail (maybe with berry notes), not sure where the miscommunication was, but he ended up recommending something that was ""a hit"" and tasted of cucumber with a sharp kick.After we all placed orders for our mains, one of us ordered a pork rib as a side for himself and another ordered ""otoro"" sushi. Since otoro is hard to come by, the group got quite excited and 2 other people said I'd like 1 too (total 3 orders).Our server proceeded to setup those who ordered the sushi with soy sauces and long and behold...we got 3 orders of pork ribs. We were confused and waited for our server to come around to ask. He insisted that we ordered the extra pork ribs - ""remember when you guys were all going me me me me me?!"" To one point we just said, whatever we'll take it for the table and asked if there are nuts. (One of us has an extremely severe nut allergy and it looks like there are some mystery crumbs). The server said he has no idea and would have to find out. Without even going, he just seemed annoyed and said ""Well, do you want me to take it away?"" He eventually took them, but that whole rude conversation left a sour note for all of us.When the otoro came, those who ordered unanimously agreed it was definitely not otoro but just fatty tuna. We felt a lil bummed since we were really looking forward to it. The pricing was also very steep for fatty tuna ($11/piece, min 2 pieces per order, so we spent $66 on fake otoro).Our mains came, they were okay. I had the pork katsu, it was moist but the bottom breading became mushy before I was half done. Their house pasta portion was tiny. Overall, the food wasn't bad, but nothing blew your mind or make you wanna come back.They checked on how we felt throughout the night and apologized for the confusion...but you can just see the resentment in our server's face.Finally, as the group was finishing up and some of us were heading to the washroom, I overheard our server and his colleagues bad mouthing our table about the pork ribs in the cash area right bedside the washrooms. I find that completely unacceptable. I get it, from your perspective, we are assholes that accused you of getting orders wrong. (There were 7 of us and I doubt we would ALL heard it wrong, it was very quiet there.) Regardless of what happened and how you felt, I think it is basic respect to talk about us AFTER we paid and left. Furthermore, they saw us walking over - restaurant was half empty on a Saturday night!Needless to say, if this is the level of professionalism we are getting, I don't think any great food can make this a decent restaurant, let alone their a-okay at best offerings.",4,2,3
14,Kevin L.,"Alexandria, VA",65,217,444,4.0,10/18/2018,"If I had to describe the food here I would say it's korean American fusion. Lots of korean inspired dishes with a twist. For appetizers I tried the bone marrow. Very tasty. Wish it came with more. For the entree I ordered the short ribs. The flavors were there, but he meat could have been a little more tender. It didn't fall off the bone as easily as I would like. Place has a modern decor and was very spacious. For the most part I enjoyed my experience here.",,,

They have 50% off all wines so we ended up getting a red and white. The waitress was super friendly and nice. We ordered the wagyu katsu and the Bari pasta. The Bari pasta was sooo good. The noodles were cooked perfectly and it was creamy and buttery. BUT the portion was so small. I could've had like another 2 plates! The wagyu katsu was just okay though.

18,Kathryn T.,"Manhattan, NY",352,411,2622,3.0,7/21/2018,"The Bari attemps to create delicious fushion dishes but falls short of expectations and is overpriced for the portion size. I had high expectations, especially after looking at the menu which fuses Korean and Japanese favorites with American ingredients... but the flavors didn't mesh together well enough to create a coherent dish. Here's what you need to know:1. You're paying too much for such smaller portions... especially for dishes that you could try to make yourself. 2. The Bari Pasta was great in theory (love the foie gras) but I felt like it I had the ingredients, this would be something I would throw together on a Wednesday night.3. The Uni Risotto flavors didn't work together. Normally, I love farro but it didn't match well.4. The fried chicken wings were MINIATURE. They were so small that we was unsure where if they even belonged to real chickens.5. The service can be fairly slow.6. The vibes are hip and trendy but it doesn't make up for the food.It's a cool place to check out at least one but I wouldn't recommend The Bari for anyone looking for a filling meal.

My boyfriend and I ordered a piece of sashimi each (I had the scallop which was very very good !) as well as the kimchi, miso soup, shiitake bibimbap and the Bari pasta -- I didn't have this dish, but it was wagyu and foie gras pasta which he loved. Management was so kind to offer us a complimentary dish ( we think it was the ceviche but it had a really light lemon ponzu sauce with raw, fresh fish) as our food was taking longer than usual to come out and we really appreciated their extra steps to making our meal great. The miso soup had a rich broth with seaweed and tofu. The kimchi was really crisp and made with just the right amount of spiciness. The shiitake bibimbap was incredible !! The rice base was mixed with what I think was seaweed and tasted incredible and I loved how many vegetables there were in the dish ! The ceviche was so light and crisp, definitely the perfect starter on a warm summer day !The interior was very clean and was huge ! The light fixtures and tables were beautiful and I loved the booths that lined one side of the restaurant ! I love love loved this place !

The food really is just a-okay. Most menu items have truffle to make it more high-end and expensive. The Bari Pasta was good, but a little oily. The Kimchi Fried Rice was fried a bit too much.

27,Ching-Chi H.,"New York, NY",41,29,23,2.0,7/22/2018,"We ordered below items. I will explain in below why i give a 2 stars rating. 1. Korean chicken wings (spicy) Chicken sauce taste like using indomie ramen powder as a sauce. Kind of dry. 3 stars for that. 2. Bari pasta (with truffle ) (1 star) $36I can taste the truffle , but the paste was dry , oily, very blend in taste. Bulgogi meat is overly sweet and feels like the pasta and meat are two completely different dish being put together in one plate. Truly over price when uni risotto is only $30. 3. Chirashi box with 9 of them inside. (3 stars) Nothing special really , sashimi was ok for a korean + japanese Restaurant. The salmon was too fat, uni was ok in taste. Server (a pretty tall white guy) - lack of knowledge or maybe he was too lazy to give suggestions or recommend anything.Overall, this restaurant is lack of presentation. Decoration isnt showing enough of what type of restaurant it is. (Non japanese or korean) Food items are really all over the place, you can't find a signature dish in the menu. They have sashimi , but korean food I don't see much of a choice beside bibimbap. Also, This is very close to nyu, so it wasnt priced right for the location. Anyway, good luck!",3,1,1

There was nothing that we tried that we didn't devour (this coming from people who don't eat much in one sitting!)...everything was amazing! We will definitely be back to this gem in Soho!Major favs: truffle pizza, Bari pasta, Braised short ribs, Pork belly, chicken wings (spicy)...who am I kidding...it was all delicious! A must go-to when in NY!",1,,
29,LeAnne B.,"New York, NY",75,143,82,5.0,10/19/2018,"Definitely a new gem in the area. We went for the tofu + shiitake mushrooms first, which had such an amazing flavor - crispy, but rich and unexpected in a very excellent way. Then we had the octopus, which was equally flavorful and buttery in a lovely non-greasy way. For the mains, we each had the kimchi fried rice which is just spicy enough without overdoing and tastes amazing. Like I wanted to order another one to take home amazing. The only thing I could recommend for this place is a bit better timing for the service - At the beginning we only had a short amount of time to look at the menus and as soon as I set my chopsticks down for a second, our appetizer plates were taken away. Yet, mid-meal, it took quite a while for my second drink to arrive.  However, the food tasted so amazing that I am giving 5 starts instead of 4. Plus the staff were all very nice and well intentioned. Definitely would like to come back here and try other items on the menu.",,,

34,Kenneth T.,"New York, NY",180,643,42,3.0,6/19/2018,"A bit disappointing - First off, the place is huge and very nice. When walking in, we were surprised how big the place was. The place was also very empty but the hostess asked if we had a reservation? I asked if she was joking since it was empty but we were seated right away. The presentation of the food was very good. My date had the sashimi set which came with miso soup - she thought the sashimi was OK but didn't eat some of it. I had the Hana roll and the Hana cut roll and also another I think was called the Royal Crown roll. The pieces were very small and the rice was chilled which made me feel like old rice was used. The rolls were good overall but nothing to write home to mom about. Most likely won't be returning.",5,,

When we waited a a bit longer than expected, our waiter brought out a delicious chef's dish which included a mix of fish and other delicate items coated in lemon ponzu. For our main dishes, my girlfriend ordered a shiitake bibimbap while I got the Bari pasta. Both mains were incredible. The bibimbap had delicious seaweed rice while the pasta contained flavorful foie gras. We also had a side of miso soup and kimchi which were both excellent. For our appetizers, my girlfriend had scallops which she really enjoyed while I got the king salmon sushi - it was perfect. I would highly recommend this place for everything and will definitely be coming back!",3,2,2
38,Abeer H.,"Jackson Heights, NY",44,275,1,4.0,9/20/2018,"This place is too fancy to give you all the goodies that you get before the meal at a regular Korean restaurant. It's also a fusion spot, so there's lots of Japanese items (sushi, tempura, etc). They have a cocktail bar and a happy hour but we didn't partake. The decor is nice (we requested a booth and got it b/c we were there early before the dinner rush) and the lighting on the dim side (for my middle aged eyes). We got the beet salad (a small portion and a bit on the limey side) and the vegan bibimbap ($20) and that was so good that I'd go back again to have it - lots of interesting flavors and textures and super delicious.",1,,
39,Lisa K.,"Newark, NJ",15,112,70,5.0,9/7/2018,"Honestly I was a little apprehensive coming here after reading some of the reviews, but I had a really great experience. The atmosphere was welcoming, the food was phenomenal, and the service was attentive and accommodating. I purchased a pulsd coupon after I saw that the promotion was still running. We got a bottle of wine, one appetizer, two entrees, and one desert, all of which we enjoyed very much. Pictures didn't come out so great because of the dim lighting, but I highly recommend the bone marrow starter, unit risotto, and the Bari pasta. Those seem to be the most popular dishes on the menu anyway so I HAD to give them a try. Next time I'll be more adventurous because everything looked really delicious.",4,,1
40,Anthony K.,"Hamilton, NY",42,24,0,4.0,10/7/2018,"Came here with my girlfriend looking for something unique and delicious and The Bari delivered! We ordered everything to share, and cannot say there was anything we did not enjoy. The only con of this place is that is is pretty pricey for the portions you get, but if you are willing to overlook that you will love it all, even the drinks! Looking forward to returning to try some other things on the menu before it changes in a few months!Spicy Sashimi Salad--the fish was so fresh and delicious, and the spices and accompaniments were a perfect compliment that let the fish shine while adding some extra zingKorean Chicken Wings -- very delicious, however very expensive for a chicken wing. Loved them, but would not spend that money on them again. Korean Pork Belly--I don't know where to start. This appetizer will rock your world. Savory, sweet, and spicy, it gets a 10-star rating from me. Also could eat the garlic chips for the rest of my life and be happyBulgogi Bibimbap--this was my first experience with both bulgogi and bibimbap, so take it for what it is. The beef was absolutely amazing, and the overall plate was fresh and each ingredient complimented the other. Would have liked more bulgogi and rice and less veggie, but that's just me Kimchi Fried Rice--My favorite thing we ordered. From the kimchi to the bacon to the fried egg on top, what wasn't to love?? Please beware-this dish is pretty spicy and if that is not your taste then you may not love it as much as I did",,,
41,Jong Hyuk P.,"Manhattan, NY",141,7,0,5.0,11/12/2018,"First of all, the place has a very good interior: clean, modern, and beautiful.It is a good dating spot, but it is also good for larger groups.I went in a group of 7 with my friends, and they have booths that can fit 8-10 people.If you tell them in advance, I'm sure they can easily fit 15 people or more.The staff is very friendly. The chef himself came out to deliver each dish for our table (maybe because our group was the biggest when we were there).The food is just amazing.I love Korean food, but this was something different. Each dish was very unique.We had almost all of the menu there, and we didn't have any dish disliked by any one of the 7.Recommendation:1. Truffle Bulgogi Pizza - this has meat and kimchi on it. The kimchi gives you a different kick to the taste of cheese and bulgogi2. Bari Wagyu Katsu - Katsu is my favorite dish wherever I go, but this was the best amongst them. Think about it, fried wagyu. Amazing.3. Bulgogi Tteokbokki - ""Tteokbokki"" is rice cake with spicy sauce (famous Korean dish). They make it better by frying the rice cake a little bit to add the crunchy-ness. You've got to try this4. The bari pasta - Foie gras pasta. I added truffle to it. So good5. Korean Fried Chicken - Fried chicken is always right.6. Bulgogi Udon - If you have all of the food above, it may be too rich. Their udon broth is really good, and will be perfect to sooth the richness.PLEASE note that we went in a large group. If you go in a smaller group, you want to mix your order with some rich dishes with the Bulgogi Tteokbokki or the Udon.They also give you a free beer/wine if you check in with yelp!I feel like this place is going to be very popular within a few months, so go there before there's a crazy long wait!",,,

I personally thought their Korean fusion dishes were so much tastier than the Japanese fusion ones; the chef and the staffs are from many famous Korean restaurants in NY so that's understandable.Must order dish:Bulgogi & foie gras pasta!!! It is too die for. Uni bibimbap is awesome, too. Great quality.Good but could use some improvement:Bone marrow with kimchi chutney- dont get me wrong, it was delicious. Nice quality bone marrow, stir fry kimchi was very flavorful, grilled sourdough bread was perfectly crispy, chewy, and warm. But the yummy bone marrow's mellow rich fatty flavor got a bit lost because the kimchi was almost too flavorful. They didn't have that many dessert options available for the soft opening. It was a little disappointing but it's only another reason for me to go back and try other things there, too.",7,1,3
46,Lei F.,"Queens, NY",1,50,23,4.0,9/22/2018,Mommies' date night and the food was on point and the decor was too. We had the tofu & shiitake mushroom appetizer which was our favorite followed by the bone marrow appetizer. They were both very tasty and not overly large or small portion wise. We ordered the truffle risotto and the Bari pasta. The risotto was definitely our least favorite. It was very watery and forgettable. The Bari pasta was tasty but I preferred the great tasting appetizers over the entrees. The decor was very sleek and modern. We would definitely try the place again since their drinks were great (think it was called the pink lady),,,

How rude is that!? It takes 5 seconds to press a button on a phone. Then we got our bill and paid the bill and as we were signing the receipt, Michael comes and tells us ""Oh sorry I gave you the wrong bill"" and gives us a new bill with 20% Gratuity included AND as we were asking why that is, he said ""oh what's the big deal?

48,Daiki N.,"Palisades Park, NJ",135,62,1,4.0,10/15/2018,"Perhaps you're getting a pre-theater dinner (Public Theater), or need a nice setting for a date night in East Village, maybe even a night out with a bunch of friends. The Bari has ample space to provide all that, along with an ambitious menu that provides a mix feel of Korean, Japanese, and American/French fusion. Try the cocktails too!Snapshot: A modern take of Korean/American (kind of Japanese) Fusion with some dishes I thought were on point and some that needs work. Location is great for a quick date night or a group dinner. Go with your instincts, but not overthink the fusion part. Pricier than the average. I can see myself coming back to try other dishes. Service seemed fine/normal, some new staffs on board but I won't judge based on that reasoning. You should be able to have a pleasant dinner.Note: I did not come here to try the sushi/sashimi plates. Solely on the Main dishes and appetizers.One look at the menu (there's actually quite a lot to look at), and you'll notice that it's Korean based with ingredients normally used in Japanese dishes. I have yet to see a very successful fusion of Korean and Japanese food, but they come close to what you can expect from a ""fusion"". For instance, your traditional Bibimbap is a veggie friendly dish with red pepper sauce. Bari offers a slight different feel with Uni, Tobiko, and pickled vegetables on a Nori rice. Add a little bit of the red pepper sauce and you have a completely different palate then your normal bibimbap. Or, An order of oysters will have your traditional lemon and sauces, but it also has kochujang. I still prefer the traditional style, but if you're not a fan of the sea water, then the kochujang will give an added flavor that doesn't necessarily mask the flavor of the oyster. Then comes the American style dishes, like the Bari Pasta, which is a cream sauce with Bulgogi and Foie gras (add truffles for extra).We (party of four) had the following dishes to share:Beet SaladOystersWagyu Beef CarpaccioPlum Ginger OctopusSpicy Seafood and Rice CakeBari Pasta w/truffleBari Wagyu KatsuUni & Tobiko BibimbapChilean Sea BassTwo dishes that stuck with me: Plum Ginger Octopus - Interesting. Boiled, steamed, and then flash fried to add a crispy outer layer. The soft, chewy inside and the crispy outer layer goes well with the mango sauce.Spicy Seafood & Rice Cake - Recommended. The rice cake is boiled as usual, but flash fried. The dish itself is a normal korean dish, but it was pretty good. Mozzarella cheese was melted first on the bottom so highly recommend to mix first before digging in. The cheese makes it better. The restaurant definitely has a modern feel (like entering an Alain Ducasse restaurant), maybe the ambiance and menu doesn't quite meddle in together, not yet, but that's just my personal feel.",2,,1

Let's talk about the food: the combination between Korean and Japanese abit of italian fusion is nice and unique. We ordered the omakase set which included 9 different things that i'll enjoyed. The cold appetizer ( which is oyster and seaweed) is good but not my favorite. The octopus appetizer is good, the tiger shrimp with gochujang paste is good, the chillean sea bass marinated wifh gochujang is really good, the wagyu is good with additional ichimi togarashi, sea salt ( when the steak comes to the table, its a bit bland and actually my suggestion is the server need to ask the customer how we want to eat our steak). The Bari pasta is good, a bit oily and dont really taste the truffle much just a kick.2. The server is nice and attentive but Jay ( i think he's the manager) really nice and knowledgeable about the food and friendly.3.

52,Hsin L.,"Jersey City, NJ",75,78,100,2.0,8/4/2018,"Lots to be desired. Quite frankly the photos/ snaps look better than it tastes unfortunately. We were here with a party of 10, it was everyone's first time because it's newly open. We ordered almost 75% of the menu and there were a selection of uni dishes we got which mine was a part of - uni bibimbap. The uni were NOT fresh. I've never tasted such an unpleasant uni that left a lingering taste on my tongue. Fresh uni is suppose to be a bit sweet and not fishy like the one I had. Had my fiancé try it and he said it was just rancid...Aside from the uni the bibimbap didn't have a sauce  so the dish was really tasteless. I expected some kind of gochujang sauce pairing where I can mix it in but it didn't come with anything so I had a tough time eating it.The half soy garlic half spicy wings were mediocre. The soy garlic didn't have sauce covered so it looked like dry wings. At first I thought the spicy wings were soy garlic because it was coated with a garlicy sauce but it turned out to be spicy.Bone marrow was lacking... it didn't have much in it. I've had better bone marrow. It just wasn't up to par. It looked pretty though.Fried Pork ribs were really good. Very crispy and flavorful.Braised short ribs were good but on the saltier side.Truffle risotto was probably the best. Can really taste the truffle flavor but you can't eat a lot as it's heavyOverpriced for the portions they give you. They need to work on their 'fresh ingredients' because the lasting memory I'll have of Bari is bad uni. Interior decorations are beautiful. Love the white palette and modern look.Advice to owners: don't operate cocktail trials at the bar during business hours when you have customers sitting right next to you. Hearing your full on critique session of your bartender's concoction doesn't make me want to order a drink !",1,1,1

There's tasting, omakase, sushi roll, bibimbop, udon, soba and some random stuff. we ordered 3 app and 2 entrees to share. Our crispy tofu appetizer came after we finished our entrees. Our server told us that it was taking a long time to cook today, total lie - no matter what, app sud not come after we finish eating. She just forgot to put in the order which is understandable, but at least admit to the mistake and let us choose whether or not we want to wait. The crispy tofu at $12 had 2 thin slices of tofu with 2 mushrooms on top. It was coated with so much sugar that it was disgusting and make me want to barf - so nasty. The braised short rib was also really sweet and it was so small that it should be in the appetizer section. 2 2in pieces and 2 1in pieces. What a joke. The only decent thing was the gyu katsu and that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. Overall experience was horrible. My friend and I were really disgusted after we finished the meal. Everything was so sweet, no other flavors at all and portions are small. Please save the sweetness for dessert and know the difference between entrees vs. appetizer.

The decor straddled the line between a James Bond villain's home and a modern art gallery. We knew we were in the right place. Fortunate enough to try one of Japan's supreme beers, Asahi, so cold that it would bring chills to your bones. For appetizers, Kimchi Fried Rice and Korean Fried Chicken Wings with spicy soy garlic; KFCW's definitely took the cake in this round. Dinner, phenomenal.

The jewel box which they're known for was definitely fresh and more filling than I expected, but the surprising favorite was the Chicken Seafood Braise (even though it had literally only one piece of each type of seafood). Would definitely return and try some of their other options!",1,,1
67,Mandy X.,"Medford, MA",179,18,11,5.0,5/7/2018,"This is Asian fusion I can get behind.My boyfriend and I stopped by Bari for dinner via recommendation by his coworker, whose former roommate is one of the owners. The restaurant is located right off of Astor Place, past the Public. When we walked in, I was astonished by the cavernous space. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, but there were so many tables -- I wondered how were they were going to fill them.Then the food came. Bari isn't going to have any trouble filling the seats once word gets out. We ordered the Hamachi Sashimi w/Spicy Ponzu, Herb Roasted Bone Marrow, Uni & Ikura Soba, Sea Bass, and Wagyu Steak, all to share. Every single dish was well-composed and delicious. There was incredible attention to detail in each dish, and clearly a lot of thought given to how to incorporate Korean ingredients like kimchi into a dish without that ingredient domination the plate's flavor profile. The portions for the entrees are small, but worth their price tag. The restaurant also brought us a complimentary portion of the Tuna Tataki between the appetizers we ordered and the entrees, which was a pleasant surprise. Throughout our meal we enjoyed the Blackberry Fizz, a delightful fruit-infused ginger beer cocktail. I have a special place in my heart for restaurants that craft such tasty non-alcoholic sodas (Nougatine comes to mind).The dishes that stood out to me were the Hamachi Sashimi and the Uni & Ikura. Neither the hamachi nor the uni have that ""stink"" you taste when the fish isn't fresh, or of high enough quality. Both had a beautiful butteriness. The hamachi was well counterbalanced by the pepper and gochujang sauce placed on top, and the uni soba was incredibly bright and ""fresh"" in the midst of our rather heavy meal. The rest of our food was also fantastic; but these two dishes were really notable for me and I'd happily order them again.I have only too complaints: one, the restaurant uses broad, flat chopsticks that I've only seen in one other Asian restaurant in NYC (Ise). Because these chopsticks are broader than they are thick, and flat-sided, you have to hold them in a very particular way in order to get the tips close together enough to pick anything up. Second, the wagyu dish needs something to cut the fat. My boyfriend and I split the 8oz steak, and the steak itself was fantastic, I almost couldn't finish my portion because of how rich it was. However, these are really nitpicky complaints -- overall, we had a wonderful time at Bari and won't hesitate to come back.Bari is currently running a 30% off the entire menu soft-opening special, which is an absolute steal. Once you dine in, they give you an ""invitation"" for 50% off your next meal. These promotions only run until May 10, so run, don't walk. I won't be surprised if this place earns a Michelin Star.",5,1,5

The wings were delicious but too small in size. We had both mock-tails and where not a big fan. My pineapple drink was extremely watered down and the glass size is only half a glass because it is so narrow. The crab salad I think need not come in the Avo skin bowl, would make it easier to eat. Maybe shape it in that and turn it over on the salad bed. Both entrees where nice. I think since they are dark in color- they should be served in white dishes, instead of black dishes. I had chicken seafood braise, it should come with a side plate for the chicken bones, clam shells and shrimp skin. Also hope they expand on their dessert menu in future, but understand that it's new and is growing.",,,

For a new place, this was extremely impressive.The food was exceptional! Everything!!!I love the fare options of Japanese and Korean on one menu. We tried several hot and cold dishes.What can I say, except I can't wait to come back!5 star across the board.

81,Emmy L.,"New York, NY",1,45,47,3.0,5/13/2018,Came for dinner on Saturday night. 30% promo is not available anymore but they might want to consider bringing it back. I was very underwhelmed. Probably one of the more disappointing meals I've had in the city given the quality and price. Pros:-Friendly staff-Interesting look. Mix of casual and trendy. Some tables have booths and pretty big space. Cons:-most of the food was slightly overcooked/dry. -fried pork ribs was def on the dry side-the bari kaisendon was a sashimi rice bowl and was decent but not memorable-the sea bass had good flavor (tad spicy) but was a bit over cooked and dry as well- uni risotto was the best dish of the night but for some reason was not enough to make me go back. Was a bit on the saltier side too. I think the main reason I'm turned off is because both entrees (seabass and risotto) were  around $30 but neither blew me away. For that much I expect more!!!In a city of great food I don't see this place lasting unless they up their execution game. The staff was really nice though but I was underwhelmed by the food given the prices and compared to other places I like/been to around downtown. Perhaps they will improve over time though,,,
82,Cody L.,"Waimea, HI",0,8,1,5.0,8/24/2018,Me and my wife came to the bari for some apps and drinks.  Not dissapointed at all.  Place has an unrivaled ambience with most korean restaurants. The service was great.   Vlad was our server. And were sure glad.  Very polite and worked hard.  Love the food.  Its innovative without breaking traditional flavors.  The one thing i wish is that the hot sauce served with the wings was not just plain gochujang but elevated with sesame or cut with some acid. But hell i love 'gcj' so its not a huge problem.  Cocktails are awesome.  Bari martini is straight candy and so delicious. Would be back and cant wait actually.,,,

85,Yihao O.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",0,72,9,4.0,7/22/2018,"I have mixed feelings about this place for almost every aspect. As we walked in I was instantly attracted by there setting. A bit industrial and a bit contemporary. We were seated at a booth with a very long table for the 4 of us. I liked the spacious seat until later. The problem w the table is it's so long the waiter/waitress either has to put his/her breast in my face or ask my wife to do his/her work for her by passing down the plates. We did the prefixes like we usually do at nice restaurants like this. While we were impressed by most of their cooked dishes, at the same time, we were very disappointed by their sushi omakasa. The small cooked dishes were all tasty and tastefully decorated. However the sushi was more like the quality of a typical neighborhood sushi restaurant. Service was in general friendly and attentive. But due to the aforementioned problem of the long booth table it was not ideal at times.",1,,

We ordered the crispy milk bread pork ribs and shrimp and vegetable kushiaki appetizers to start. The sauce that came with the ribs was amazing though it was not enough of it, so we requested a side of sauce. We also had the uni risotto and Chilean sea bass for our entrees and they were super tiny portions though really tasty. We were so happy we ordered appetizers beforehand.

92,Oliver C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,65,4,1.0,9/30/2018,"Empty on a Sunday night. Food is good however, poor service. The restaurant was definitely not cheap either, prices on main courses were $20+.

93,Jina L.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",89,29,13,5.0,7/28/2018,"My husband and I went here for his birthday dinner.  We had Nick as our waiter and he was great!   He was very friendly and had good recommendations.  We got the Bari martini and the houjicha and anise iced milk tea.  The martini was refreshing and the milk tea was yummy (tasted similar to a chai tea but not as sweet).  For our appetizer we got the avocado crab salad, wagyu beef carpaccio and the shrimp and vegetable tempura.  The avocado crab salad was well dressed, refreshing and full of crab meat.  The carpaccio was my husband's favorite.  It was well marbled, not Japanese, but American cross bred.  It was lightly seasoned with garlic soy sauce.  Possibly the best ""wagyu"" you'll get outside of Japan.  The tempura was also very delicious.  It is breaded with Pablo, not too greasy and portion was pretty large.  The tempura was shrimp, avocado, sweet potato and cauliflower.  The only thing was that one of the large potato pieces were a bit undercooked.  But other than that it was great! For our entree, my husband had the Bari pasta (foie gras, bulgogi beef).  He opted to add the truffles.  He thought it was slightly under seasoned and the portion was too small. Overall he thought it was tasty.  I got the Bari chirashi don.  It was a good sized portion and everything in it was fresh.  It was very delicious and filling.  Overall, we had a great experience and I would recommend giving this restaurant a try!",,,

97,Milan S.,"ASTORIA, NY",10,57,6,3.0,5/8/2018,"I wanted very much to like this place because I felt good about discovering a new restaurant with potential and getting behind it absent any information at all (there were no reviews when I went) but I have to overcome the cognitive dissonance and provide honest feedback. That said, I feel like this is really a 2.5 and I'm rounding up to make myself feel better.Firstly, Delilah was the outstanding performer on the night, clearly an experienced fine dining host who did her best to hold things together.But it couldn't make up for the restaurant missing the mark on several fronts. On the bright side is the space, beautifully constructed and well lit. Simple but good ambience. We were at first enthused about sitting in the booths since they were spacious but enclosed enough to provide a sense of privacy. That is, though, until it felt like they had been constructed too deep. The wait staff struggled to reach over to the far side of the booth each time they brought out dishes or wanted to clean the table, which became awkward.On the wait staff, their inexperience was very much on show. Generally at a restaurant with a higher price point you expect some best practices in the service, but this staff has not been trained. The host had to step in to ask if we wanted anything else to drink (this week is BYOB so we had our own wine) because nobody else had asked us. There was also no check-in to see if everything was ok and each request took at least 10 minutes with an empty restaurant - only two or three other diners at the time (asking for the check etc.). We had to prompt for simple things like explaining the menu, and even so we were only notified that there was no dessert available once we were ready to order dessert!There were a couple of good and great items - the pork ribs appetiser was tasty with a good texture and the kimchi carrot puree that came with the bone marrow was a nice touch. My wife also enjoyed the uni risotto and the tuna tataki was good. But the chicken wings were only average and quite expensive. On the mains, the gyu katsu was only as good as what you would find on your average lunch special. It was bland but also thickly cut and very oily and unmemorable accompaniments. The cold shishito pepper side didn't work - we've only seen peppers cooked/blistered. The chicken seafood main and short ribs were fine but no distinguishable japanese or korean take on it. The biggest disappointment though was the omakase - it was nothing more than a highly priced sushi platter - which was only brought out after everyone else had finished their main courses. The delay went unexplained, as did the dish itself. Expecting an omakase, we had to ask what was being served and again the host had to step in to explain. But the point of an omakase is for the chef to tailor the courses to your reaction - we did not see the chef and there were no courses, just a regular sushi platter and not exceptional. I felt bad for my guest who was expecting something special and hid their disappointment but was clearly let down. The price should be halved and the description changed accordingly.Finally, I do acknowledge this was a soft opening and that there are bound to be some teething problems. That said, soft openings are also a good marketing opportunity and the Bari missed taking advantage on this occasion, because I was ready to spread a more positive word. We were not asked for feedback and when I did try to provide some (on the katsu) it was met somewhat defensively like a slur on a tried and tested recipe.We were not invited back as other reviewers have mentioned. On the whole, it was unprepared and uncoordinated. I think the Bari may just succeed if the 30% discount this week is made permanent because the regular $$$ menu price was not fulfilled.",5,,
98,Scott B.,"New York, NY",236,4,0,5.0,9/23/2018,"Went to The Bari last night and had an awesome time. The decor was typically trendy and minimalist which is what we expected.

The octopus was the stand out of the two. For entrees we had the sashimi set, sea bass, and cauliflower steak. Cauliflower steak was great, sea bass was perfectly cooked delicious.

How was everything?""  ""Uh, we haven't gotten our food yet.""  She dashed off and 15 minutes we got our kimchi fried rice--after the initial hour wait.  Our appetizer then showed up from another waiter as a ""gift on the house"" except it was an appetizer we had ordered and never received.  Aside from the horribly disorganized service, the food was decent if overpriced.  This is not a $$ restaurant --not even close.  If there's Dom Perignom on the menu that's a good clue you're about to pay more.  Caveat Emptor with this restaurant.",1,1,1

The restaurant was so nice and gave us honey chicken wings as well as a special vegetarian tofu mushroom dish as service.
