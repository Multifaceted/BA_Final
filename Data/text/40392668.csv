0,Hollis W.,"New York, NY",37,4,0.0,5.0,10/4/2017,"Lucy's has everything you'd want from a dive bar: pool, cheap drinks, friendly staff, manageable crowds and decent music at a reasonable volume. It's actually pretty rare to find a place that checks all those boxes in the East Village, especially on a weekend night. The demographic is pretty standard for the neighborhood: students and miscellaneous 20/30-somethings.Funny: I've been hitting this joint off and on for like 15 years and it never seems to change. The decor, the staff and the vibe are immutable. I don't think I've ever gone there and *not* seen Lucy. If it ain't broke, don't fix it...",2,,
1,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,3.0,4/14/2018,"Standard dive bar. I came with friends to grab a quick drink. The venue is definitely dirty, grimy, and not well kept-to be expected of a dive bar. They have pool for play as well. There's a few tables, the bar, and sufficient space to stand.The crowd is very young (think early to mid 20s) and grimy/hipster as well. Perfect if that's your preferences.",,,
2,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",381,334,637,3.0,1/30/2018,"There's a lot of dive bars in the LES and Lucy's is one of those bars you just end up at for some reason. I don't know why I keep finding myself back but I just do. Lucy's is always packed at night. I try to avoid this place on the weekends because the crowd can get rowdy and kind of aggressive (they really need better security inside the bar). They have pool tables which is why I come in. The drinks are very cheap but the downside is they only accept cash. Although, there is an ATM; it's still a hassle.",3,1,2
3,Felicia M.,"Queens, NY",169,228,227,5.0,12/22/2017,"Perfect NYC Dive bar. Lucy's has pool, a full bar, jukebox, tabletop quiz games, and a working bathroom, what more do you want? Cool spot to grab a few cold ones, but make sure you have cash since it's cash only. Oh and Lucy is behind the bar WORKING IT!",1,,
4,Astoria T.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,9/14/2018,"How about zero stars? Went there recently expecting to pay LES prices. She charged us $17 for a Bklyn Lager, & a Jack 'n Ginger. Stay away. Da bitch is a crook!",,,
5,Craig G.,"Manhattan, NY",89,71,0,5.0,3/25/2018,"If I had to summarize with one word, that word would be: authentic.  New York used to be full of places like this but they're pretty much all gone now.  I've been hanging out in the city since the 80s when I was in college, and Lucy's has been around that long.  Back then, Lucy's wasn't considered a ""dive bar,"" it was just one of many bars in the lower East Side.  So, if you want that authentic old New York experience, this is the place for you.  One unique thing is that Lucy is a big fan of 80s New Wave, the music that used to be played on 92.7 WLIR in Long Island back in the 80s.  To this day she still has those tunes on the jukebox.  And, she works behind the bar every night.  So...please go and and support Lucy.  You'll be happy you did.",1,,1
6,Julianne G.,"Manhattan, NY",46,257,601,3.0,9/13/2017,"We came here looking for a place to play pool after dinner. They have 2 pool tables, one slightly smaller than the other. A game costs $1.75 and you can get quarters from the lady at the bar. I was surprised all the sticks were nice and straight instead of crooked and wobbly as I'd expect from a dive. I don't know how much drinks were because my friend got em, but you can only pay in cash and there's an ATM on site.",,,
7,Allyson D.,"Leonardo, NJ",51,221,58,5.0,2/24/2018,This is the best bar in NYC and Lucy is a treasure. On a rainy night she kept giving us free drinks and smiling and being sweet. Bless her,,,
8,Lucy J.,"Long Island City, NY",0,3,0,1.0,1/16/2017,"I was playing pool and 2 guys came up to me and challenged me for the table. Clearly drunk, he started insinuated that my skirt was too short to play pool and that my cue ball wasn't behind the line when I broke the rack. It made me feel extremely uncomfortable, i look over at Lucy to see if she's able to help me out or get these guys away from me, Lucy and her daughter looked on (almost helplessly) and did nothing. I quickly finished (lost) the game and left the bar. Lucy! Get a bouncer please! It's their job to throw out perverts and break up fights. When your customer feels unsafe in a crowded environment and nobody helps her out, you can get sued for that.",4,1,
9,Tina D.,"New York, NY",6,6,0,1.0,10/9/2017,This is easily the diviest of dive bars. I went here for a friend's party and the place was small and dark. At first it wasnt so bad but then it filled up VERY quickly and it looked like every single guy in there had gotten his clothes from the same damn closet. On top of it I got carded by Lucy every single time I came back from smoking a cigarette. Every. Single. Time. I'm really kind of in the dark about the appeal of this place.....,,,
10,Marleigh S.,"New York, NY",11,157,27,4.0,1/2/2016,"This is the diviest place I've ever been. I walked on on New Year's Eve after 11pm and was handed a top hat on arrival. It was fairly empty with only around 15 people there. We grabbed draft beers, which were $6.50 a pop (not sure if this was because it was NYE) and sat down to wait for the ball to drop.People were selecting music from the jukebox the entire time, but it wasn't too loud. How nice to have a conversation over a drink! They gave us champagne at midnight. I would definitely come back! Hopefully with cheaper drinks.",2,2,1
11,Sam W.,"South Salem, NY",5,4,0,5.0,3/27/2017,"My favorite bar in all of New York City. Lucy is fantastic, has seen it all, and runs a no-nonsense establishment that's an iconic part of the East Village night life. Lucy's is a go-to for me and all of my friends when we're looking for a few drinks, some games of pool, and a few jams on the jukebox.",1,,
12,Michael N.,"New York, NY",213,1,0,1.0,5/18/2016,"I didnt have high hopes for lucys, but it was still pretty disappointing.  Lucy who was lazily sitting on the other side of the bar made her way around to the tap to poor me my goose island, which she proceeded to poor ice cubes into.  7$, tasted terrible.  Tap lines likely needed some love.As if that wasnt enough, a friend of mine who regularly goes there was asked to leave by Lucy for having a ""sick hand"".  (His arm was broken).  She made a real scene about it.My experience here was terrible.If you are looking for a better dive bar I would recommend Sly Fox on 2nd ave, or B-side on avenue B.",1,,
13,Alana T.,"Brooklyn, NY",185,10,0,5.0,4/1/2017,Honestly my favorite bar in the city and I don't even know why...pool and a jukebox so what's not to love... plus Lucy rules,,,
14,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,4.0,5/30/2015,"I've been meaning to come here for years, and I finally stumbled in on a Sunday during Memorial Day weekend. I have this awful habit of going to new bars on holiday weekends, when there's no way to gauge how the place usually functions. But I can't help but adore it based on my one experience.I was with a friend and we were escaping the bridge and tunnel crowd that seemed to overtake this other dive we were at. Awhile ago he had told me he couldn't come here because he got kicked out, and now he has no recollection of saying any such thing, so we have no idea what, if anything happened here. We had talked about this that night, and then BOOM, like a beacon in the night Lucy's gaping reddish entrance called to me. I dragged him inside.It was delightfully dead. A few creeps around the edges, a couple of guys playing pool on one of the two tables. And no music. You ever go into a dive bar on a Sunday at 2am and enter into silence? I had no idea how to feel. During my first beer I kind of wanted to leave. I saw there was a jukebox, and I saw it was turned off, and figured someone wanted it that way. I powered through, and by the second beer I was able to focus more on our drunk conversation, and came to really enjoy the silence. I had somewhere to be at 3 so I only stayed for two beers, but I'll be back.ETA: Walked by on a Saturday night around 10 or 11pm- it was jam packed like every other bar in the area.",,,
15,Alex W.,"Ann Arbor, MI",1,3,0,5.0,3/28/2017,Lucy is the best bartender around.  Always so kind and generous.  The place has a good vibe and it's never dull,,,
16,Bill H.,"Berkeley, CA",1209,905,58,2.0,11/29/2014,"A few friends and I stopped at Lucy's on a late Saturday night. It was recommend as a place we could go to avoid the crowds and hordes of drunk young folks in the East Village. I'd say my friend was half-right. Lucy's was crowded, but the crowd wasn't strictly young.Lucy's is a dive. Not a particularly clean one (the place smells a bit funky), either. But the five dollar beers and three dollar PBR cans are a nice break from the more expensive prices in the surrounding bars.My friend and I played a couple games of pool in the back. The pool tables were easy to get onto, and the opponents ranged from guys-who-play-here-every-night-sober to  falling-over-my-cue-and-onto-the-table-drunk. Hmm. The back wall really cut into the playing space on the back table (there was a half-sized cue stick for when you needed to line up a shot against this well).The staff at Lucy's was friendly, including Lucy herself, a tiny woman who was seemingly everywhere in the bar at once - talking to patrons, grabbing cases of beer from the kitchen, tending the bar. Still, though, I struggle to think about why I'd recommend Lucy's to anyone looking for a place to stop on a weekend night. The prices are low, true, but I bet you could find a better dive in the East Village.",1,,2
17,Dave C.,"New York, NY",6,298,0,3.0,7/24/2017,"I really don't understand the popularity of this place; I guess if you like to play pool or chitchat with an elderly Polish woman, this might be your ideal spot but otherwise not worth a trip",,,
18,Ashley F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,5.0,6/15/2015,"Take it from a bartender ...this is the best bar in NYC. Lucy is a legend. The jukebox is full of classics, the bar is full of history. i would say don't go here just to keep it empty, but it deserves your business. The day this bar closes i'm moving toOregon, because NYC will have lost all of its charm.",2,,4
19,Rebecca G.,"Manhattan, NY",58,723,45,5.0,12/26/2013,"The dive-y-ist of dive, Lucy's was a fascinating place to go for a post-Christmas dinner drink.When my friend and I arrived shortly after 7:00, we were the only two people there. My friend quickly connected with the Polish bartender in Polish, who later took our photo and gave us a free round of drinks.We also enjoyed playing random songs on the jukebox, including ones by Joan Jett and Johnny Cash.",1,2,2
20,Rick M.,"New York, NY",63,10,0,4.0,4/8/2016,"The day had been long, tiring and pretty disappointing. It had transitioned to an anxious afternoon and a mellow cold Thursday evening, as the #1 train chugged its way downtown to 59th street. 2 friends and I picked up a colleague from Columbus Circle and made our way down to Alphabet city where the F line dropped us off at 2nd Avenue. I was ravenous and beer might as well have been good enough food if not for the 99c pizza that I devoured later.We walked into the red and white hue that filled the space between the bar and the pool table. As a friend of mine ordered drinks, I realized it was pretty empty for a bar in alphabet city with a pretty bartender, 2 pool tables and (what seemed like) 24 year olds occupying the stools and the tables. We paid the $1 for the table and commenced a doubles game. As 2 middle aged men walked in and started a friendly game against our (rather forgettable) neighbours, I realized I was being challenged with friendly glances as I took my shots. The 2 middle aged men were the typical dad-bod 30 year olds who simply wanted to wash away another work day with a few rounds of pool and beer, highlighting the week with the 6 ball run. Their partners, however, never had the practice to give them enough of a competition, and frankly neither did I, but it was a bad enough day for me to concentrate on the pool instead of jolly company. As the evening went on - and by this I mean 10 minutes past 8 or 8:30, I looked around to find myself in a very different bar than when I had entered. 2 middle-aged women had walked in and were eyeing us as well and the bar was full of college students who'd just received their license after turning 21. For them, this was becoming their spot, where the bar was nothing flashy, but perfect enough to keep the attention to the conversation and company, where the bartender was pretty enough to talk to but not to break the first rule of going to a bar, and where good food surrounded you 24/7, if ever the pangs of hunger came calling to your appetite. As our neighbors left the 2 middle-aged men to play their game (and we'd finished ours by that point), another man in yellow flannel came to rack the balls and play them next. As I wandered over to squeeze my way in and enjoy some competition, I was met with a stern rejection from the yellow flannel directing me away, for in fact I had tried to trespass on a solo performance. Dejected, I decided it was time for my hunger to console me, and I walked a few blocks south to order a medium cheese pizza for $6.49 (looked rather large to be honest) and continued to the park with my friends to devour most of the freshly baked pie. I was told we had to return to the bar to kick it back with Lucy herself; however, to our disappointment, she was not coming in that day. We did head back however, and 2 of my friends gave the Goose Island beer a go, and as the clock struck 12, I realized it was time for me to traverse back through the city and comfortably settle into my bed for the night. Surely, one might catch me another good-pool-day/bad-university-day, vying for Lucy's pool table championship reputation...",1,1,2
21,Samantha A.,"Rego Park, NY",24,71,2,4.0,10/12/2015,"Lucy's is great to go to for a group as it's pretty big and doesn't get crowded til later in the night. Super cheap drinks (for the area), but not that strong (if that's what you're into). If Lucy is there, take the chance to talk to her, she's hilarious! Wish I still lived around the corner, but like everyone I've been priced out...I hope it doesn't happen to Lucy's!",,,

I know, man, you wish you'd been alive to rep the L.E.S. spirit during the Tompkins Square Park riots of 1988. But I'm not going to fight an elfin teenaged version of Albert Hammond, Jr., just because I wore a collared shirt to attend an event and he wore something off the clearance rack at Urban Outfitters. Get a load of this, though: they sell Pabst Blue Ribbon here. In cans! Damn right New York Fucking City is everything they said it'd be.Dave Grohl apparently dropped by just after I left.

It has some of its original charm, but as my friends and I pointed out, it seems to be more of a pool hall than a dive.Most of the already puny bar is taken up by two huge pool tables in the back with little to no seating in the front.

I was waiting for a game of pool and this girl who said her dad owned the bar said I couldn't sit in a specific seat because I was ""in the way"". In reality, I was sitting in one of only a few seats. After a quick discussion this girl explained that I was ""in the way"". I explained to her that I was waiting for a game to clear up so I could play. She persisted in coming at me even with the statement that her father owned the bar. It did not bother me. I did not move and I stood up and her boyfriend (I assume) got involved saying I yelled at her and was in her face. I reasonably tried talking to him but he kept raising his voice yelling at me. Within minutes, my friends and I decided to leave because this guy was getting violent and threatening to fight me. Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this bar! Terrible customers all around",,,

34,Will M.,"Manhattan, NY",24,65,0,3.0,10/1/2013,"I'm always surprised that Lucy's isn't constantly swarmed by hipsters. For a long time it was a go-to spot for friends of mine as we loved to drink a couple beers and play some pool. Since those friends now live a little closer, we don't head down to the village quite as often, but I have fond memories of the place.The bartender and owner is a little polish woman who putters around the place night after night, always smiling and helpful. The bar has a vibe of playing pool in your grandparent's basement, especially since the TV is always tuned to TBS from my recollection.",,,

37,Janice R.,"New York, NY",6,18,0,4.0,3/1/2013,"This place is a great dive, with an odd and wonderful group of people. There's drunk, rowdy construction workers, a few old men (who may or may not have eyes for Lucy), papi's yelling cat calls at ladies, and inexplicably preppy boys wearing tie, button down, sweater combos playing pool and big buck hunter. Then there's Lucy herself, who seems so sweet and old in her little flowered dress, but I could just as easily see pulling out a baseball bat and taking care of business.It's cash only, but a lot of places are in this neck of the woods. And it draws an attractive crowd for a hole in the wall. Oh, and the juke box has a great selection of En Vogue songs. Enough said?",,1,1
38,Elishevah G.,"Brooklyn, NY",612,622,135,4.0,3/1/2012,"Well, well, well. It's true what they say about Lucy - she's definitely on the side of those who want to get it in. I came here on a date last night (yeah yeah, year of yes) and Lucy was generous with the buybacks, always providing new beverages as soon as the last ones disappeared, and being very attentive until welllllllll passed when I wanted to go home (aka I got two hours of sleep last night, LUCY). I like this place a lot. They have a solid rock n roll jukebox, beers are moderately priced (well, they're average - 5 bucks), and everything about Lucy's screams ""dive!"" The patrons were especially interesting, though I have to say, when a giant, patriotically painted drag queen told me that my jacket was knocked to the floor and then explained to me that the woman rudely did so without telling me because ""she's French,"" my French ass then proceeded to note that said drag queen was what the French call les incompetents. ;) Anyway, there was a sordid array of characters throughout the bazillion hours that I was here last night, and Lucy kept them all in check. She's definitely a cool, cunning old broad. I'd like to come back here more often, but definitely not until 3am on a Wednesday because guess what? You will have to wait twenty minutes each for the L and the G train, and my working class pride rarely allows me to take a cab such a short distance... so, if you're from that other borough, you know the one, across the river, and you wanna hit up Lucy's, I suggest doing so in the hours before midnight, because while the East Village is geographically close to Brooklyn, the trains don't give a shit if you have to work at 6am the next morning.",4,4,3

This bar tends to attract college meatheads or pretentious jerks who think its so rad to be in a dive bar. There's also an electronic jukebox that doesn't always work and two pool tables.

My entire friend's circle has kept the story alive as I try to shake it from my memory. All I'm saying (admitting) is that Lucy is no innocent. She kept dropping shots of vodka down in front of me, totally trying to help some guy get in my pants. I have a distinct memory of Lucy trading knowing glances with my date & he would nod, then another shot would land in front of me. She knew, he knew & thank god I learned my lesson forevermore. Who needs Rohypnol when you've got her? Yikes!The rest of that night belongs to me. Thankfully I've successfully blocked it out.

53,Rocombey G.,"Brooklyn, NY",35,325,0,3.0,5/15/2011,"I swear I never use the word douchey except when I'm partying in an area crowded with current or future yuppies. And it's not even my fault. It's because in those spaces, I inevitably hear some variation on that epithet at least four times. We'd heard it twice on the street already, before the angry yuppie went after the taxis. The first cab apparently decided not to pick up the two young (white, if you must know) women. The tall yuppette shouted""You can't deny us, it's against the law! You probably have a little dick anyway!""A second cab began to pass, and I'm sure that driver saw that this is not the kind of passenger he wanted in his cab. This time she hit the window hurling that yuppie warcry: ""DOUCHEBAG!""My fourth time hearing it was at Lucy's. It's a dive. I have some friends who, when our other friends come in from out-of-town, Lucy's is one of the places they will go. Without a doubt. And for them, I will keep going to Lucy's.The prices are fine, the bathroom lock functions, and the pool table doesn't have too much of an incline. And the jukebox isn't bad either. Seriously, nothing like playing pool when Prince comes on. The staff and older regulars are also decent folks too. But the crowd, as in so many circumstances, is what gets in my way. No, I don't really mind the trouble of playing pool in a packed bar. But most of the crowd. They're just really douchey. They steal working class people's seats. They bump and flail jackets without apologizing to people they hit. They're loud and obnoxious and sometimes a bit racist and usually quite sexist.I'm not saying I'm not obnoxious. I've let my friends get me drunk here, and then when they head outside for a smoke, plopped myself down at some table full of yuppies and taken their time. But I think there are basic levels of respect and conscientiousness that you should have. Even when you're going out on the weekend.",2,3,2

56,Lucy H.,"Brooklyn, NY",369,851,16,3.0,8/20/2009,One random night.. My friend and I went in there for some drinks and I realized this is the place my friend told me about.. I would never found this place if I wasn't randomly walking in the area.Typical america dive-bar with a pool table ( free pool) crowd was ok. although my friend thinks there are some cuties but I think it was just alright. the 70's years old bartender named Lucy served us all night and she is definitely friendly. Drinks were cheap.. it's a good place if you just want to chill and grab a drink with some friends.. NOT a place to impress your date for sure :-),1,,

I might come back to learn some polish words and to try conversating in polish with Lucy.* I particularly stepped in to try the polish beer Zywiec. With 5.6 ABV, it tastes good. The bottle is bigger than the regular bud and it costs about 6 bucks.* The music seemed to some oldie goldies. Music is played from an internet jukebox. * Has a free pool table.",,,
59,Danielle S.,"New Orleans, LA",198,261,0,4.0,11/5/2007,Lucy's goes in my dive bar Hall of Fame. It's not pretty but pretty gritty.  The drinks are cheap and you can entertain yourself with one of two pool tables in the back or put a few bucks into the jukebox. The bar is owned and run by an old Polish family with lots of charm.  For some reason I haven't made a stop here in awhile...I think I'll pay a visit soon and see if Lucy is still tending bar.___I walked by here the other day and Lucy was unlocking the door and smiled and said hi to me. That was nice.,3,1,2

The ones that come they all know Lucy - she's been working there for the last 20-25 years and can tell you more than one interesting story. The best part is that she is Polish and I could not have a better time chatting away with her while drinking a Zywiec, a Polish beer. She even got a round on her. Classic Polish style. If I lived in NYC I would come there all the time and so should you. Oh, and don't forget to check out the restrooms.",,,

I remember the pre-21 days, trying to find bars that pretended not to care about IDs - and this bar screams ""don't ask don't tell"" - as its windows have been aptly blacked out. The best part about this bar is that its most definitely run by the fam - mama bar tender must be at like 70 - and can be quite a pisser. This bar is a hit or miss, it can be crowded or empty. I pretty much don't think it's worth the stop when the east village is filled with so many dirty gems.",1,,1

68,Erica S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",9,27,0,4.0,6/14/2009,"I really like Lucy's, but I can see how it's not for everyone.  Here's what I like about it:1.  Old Nicolas Cage movie posters (What? Why? Who knows).  2. A single shortened pool cue because their second pool table is too close to the back wall to allow for a regular cue.  3. General friendliness of other Lucy's patrons.4. Reasonably delicious G&Ts.Here's why you may want to skip it:1. You have no respect for Nicolas Cage.2. You have an aversion to dirt, griminess, people trying to jack your cigarettes.  3. You want a bar that's 100% dive instead of a 73% dive. I can see this.  Sometimes nothing less than Mars Bar will do.",4,2,2

You can easily sit and have a drink by yourself, or on your way out with some friends. I wouldn't come here for anything else",1,,

75,Anna K.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,277,16,5.0,3/25/2010,"i can not believe this place exists in manhattan. the moment i stepped inside it reminded me exactly of the shittiest dive bars in my upstate college town, aka. loooveee. and then the bartender was Lucy herself (POLSKA!)! very admirable. the prices werent too bad, spent 17 bucks on a very well poured vodka/oj, red stripe, and yuengling. there were two pool tables, and a megatouch machine (photo hunt = 50 cents per game). bathroom wasnt bad at all for a dive. thursday night had a good crowd going, but not annoying crowded - got 3 seats at the bar the second we walked in. i think besides Lucy, the chill crowd, the prices, the strong drinks, the photo hunt... the thing that REALLLLY sealed the deal for me was the fact that The Clash - Lost in the Supermarket came on while I was there. Right after an Elvis song. love. (ps.  really thought twice about writing a glowing review bc i didnt want this gem to be over run. but whatever, lucy deserves it. go and give her all your money/love immediately!)",2,2,3

However, the last time I was there, the man claiming be the owner cursed-off Lucy in English and (Russian? Polish?) and made signaling motions like he was going to slit her throat behind her back and all this BEFORE he started threatening to hit one of my girlfriends when she stood up for Lucy. The owner was so drunk I think everyone seated at the bar was surprised that he was even standing, but he was ceaseless in harassing Lucy and the other bartender both verbally and physically (he was planted behind the bar with them and would not move despite Lucy asking him a dozen times so that she could work) and both of my girlfriends. At one point when he tired of saying he was going to hit my friend, he started calling her ""ugly and looked like she was from Pakistan"" in his broken English.Lucy's is a good, cheap pick for the East Village and every time I've been there, the crowd has been friendly and diverse, but if that guy is the owner, he's not getting another dime from me ever again.",2,,1
