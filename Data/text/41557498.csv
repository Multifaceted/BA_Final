5,David L.,"Manhattan, NY",147,1,0,5.0,3/16/2017,"Great bar with good prices for the area, located next to the Hampton Inn lobby.   Great for locals as well.   Friendly bartenders (only one bartender per night), and great cozy atmosphere, makes it feel like you're at home in your own personal bar!",1,,

Knows how to make you feel welcomed and also knows the local hot spots around Soho. If you stay here you won't be disappointed.",2,1,1

8,Remaining U.,"San Jose, CA",33,44,0,5.0,8/3/2012,"We stayed at the hotel for our last trip to NYC and bartender Tyler was awesome.  He provided us with great service, a ton of laughs and great drinks.  One recommendation to anyone visiting:  listen to Tyler when he says, ""You don't want to eat the fruit that is soaked in the vodka.""  He is absolutely correct  ;)  Will definitely visit here on our next trip out to NYC, even if we don't stay at the same hotel.",1,1,1
9,Raymond L.,"New York, NY",9,29,3,5.0,3/8/2010,"This bar is a gem in the neighborhood.  Its a good unpretentious place to get a few drinks before your night out.  The drinks were fairly cheap.  Greg, the bartender, will make anything you want. The mango coco water martini was extremely good.",1,1,1
