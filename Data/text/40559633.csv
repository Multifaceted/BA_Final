The a.c. does not work , they even switched rooms for me to find even shittier a.c. so they ended up giving us a fan so that part sucked also the first room had a not so nice smell like dirty carpet. Other than that the pool was great as i said the location so 3 stars :)",1,,1
1,Gerald G.,"Ho-Ho-Kus, NJ",108,45,2,2.0,11/6/2018,"I do think most people are excessively nitpicky when rating hotels and I try not to be.  I mean, do you really travel for the hotel or is it a place to sleep while you are visiting wherever you are going?  That said, here is my review of this hotel.Summary:  A hotel with a lot of potential that is a bit older in a decent location near Columbus Circle and Central Park.  Wouldn't be bad for the money/location BUT some things must change if I were to stay here again or recommend it to a friend.  Staff of hotel/restaurant were excellent and the issues don't reflect on them.  Side note:  Good hotel near NYC Marathon finish lineThe bad in sum: WIFI, HVAC, and no mini fridge to store your own things.  The good in sum: Location, local restaurants, quick check in, decent sized room, super nice staff throughout the hotel.The details: I chose this place due to the somewhat convenience of the NYC Marathon Finish Line. That said, when a hotel can't even deliver the most basic functions and are charging NYC prices they deserve to be called out. One basic function that fails is the HVAC system. For some reason I didn't read enough reviews prior to booking. Had I done so I would have seen the multitude of complaints here and probably not booked. The heater made a lot of noise but nothing was coming out of the vents. It barely got warm. The only saving grace was that it was an unseasonably warm November weekend and I would've only needed it one of the 5 nights. In 2018 another of those basic functions is WIFI.  Though free, it is dysfunctional and useless.  While you may be able to scroll some basic websites don't even think about trying to watch a 45 second news clip, it's not happening. This is a one time fix that this hotel needs to make ASAP or I would find it impossible to recommend in the future.  WIFI is not a luxury, it is an essential service nowadaysI also never realized how much I needed a mini fridge until I stayed here and was without one. I've stayed in much cheaper hotels and I can't remember a time where I didn't have a mini fridge. This isn't because I want them to provide me with anything; I want to be able to grab a case of bottled water and some other stuff to refrigerate rather than pay $2.50 at their vending machine for a bottle when I can grab a case for $3.99. These are changes management MUST address and should be priorities; especially given the prices being charged. If these are ever addressed (the HVAC at minimum) the hotel is in a good location, quiet despite being on 57th, 2 or 3 blocks from Columbus Circle and Central Park, super quick check in process, decent sized king room, parking attached for those stubborn people who insist on driving in NYC and oversized bathrooms.  On a final note, like others have said, it's old and dated and could use a remodel. Get over it. You don't go to NYC to stay in a hotel. If a modern feel so want you desire you can pay double and find that.",,,
2,Brennan M.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,6,3,1.0,10/17/2018,"As I lay in the room right now typing this review I start to realize all the things that make this hotel so bad. My wife and I really just needed a room for two nights and didn't think it could be that bad. Check in was fine, once we got to the room we started wondering how this was a ""4 star"" hotel. It looks like a well used Days Inn hotel room. We started getting hot so I went to turn on the AC and no cool air would pump through the room so I called the front desk and they said the a/c is turned off this time of year. Now, as someone who lived in NYC up until a year ago I understand the gas heat but this is a hotel. There should be a/c year round. Opening the windows did next to nothing so we got no sleep for our last two nights. I think they bought handmedown toilets from a high school football stadium, paint is chipping away everywhere with rust underneath, the elevators are super small and slow and the shower doesn't look like it's been thoroughly cleaned ever. To make a long story short, this place is extremely dated. If we hadn't pre-paid for the room then we'd definitely be looking for somewhere else to stay for our last night. Speaking of which, my card keeps getting charged for random little fees and I never received a receipt.I must say though that the cleaning staff were all super nice.",,,
3,Eli L.,"Culver City, CA",1,15,0,1.0,10/11/2018,"Terrible hotel, not worth the price at all. I stayed here for 5 days in late summer and the air conditioner rattles and creaks, but never cools. It's filled with disgusting rusty water. The rooms are dingy, there is hair glued to the bathroom walls and clogging the tub drain. The windows are filthy, the walls are thin. The elevators are small and graffitied. I got locked out of my room because the ancient key locks failed and needed to be replaced - the one bright spot was the very kind and attentive staff person that came up to fix the lock. Location is great but I recommend taking your business elsewhere.",,,

8,Erica N.,"Chicago, IL",29,94,184,4.0,1/23/2018,"So I haven't stayed in a NY hotel in over 10 yrs mostly because I used to live here. That said I forgot about how petite some spaces can be and the avg pricing. For the location and price, I thought this was a great find.I had a petite queen on the 17th floor. Limited view for two nights.The room can fit two people but those two should be parent/child or a couple. It was perfect for me as a solo traveller. Oh! And my bed was greatBathroom was a decent size and came with Bath and Body Stress Relief products.  That was nice.The staff was very friendly.The Downsides:1. Heat only room. I had to open the window for a little relief.2. Very thin walls. I could hear my next door neighbors and everyone near that closed their door.I would stay again.

12,Lauren H.,"Hightstown, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,11/15/2018,"Terrible experience, waste of money, and unprofessional employees that will lie to appease you in the moment and you can be sure that your issue will never be addressed. The housekeeper thought I checked out of the room that I was staying in for two nights and threw out all of my belongings in the bathroom. I politely addressed the issue with the front desk manager on the weekend and was told they would call to follow up Monday. After days of my calling leaving my number and e-mail with several people who all claimed to never have been informed of the issue, they all told me to wait for a call or e-mail back. Sure enough this never happened and when I spoke to Rebecca, one of the front desk managers who had originally been informed of this issue, she gave me an attitude about the fact that I am calling past normal hours when she was the one who told me in the first place I would be called back days ago. She was rude and dismissive, and clearly had no intentions of resolving this issue. And not surprisingly, the housekeeper denied having thrown out my items and no resolution was offered.Generally, front desk managers should have a level of professionalism and common courtesy that this hotel clearly lacks on all levels. We booked four rooms and all guests had a negative experience.Save yourself the money and grief and stay elsewhere.",,,
13,Krysti S.,"Lenexa, KS",1,14,2,1.0,8/5/2018,"This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. If I could give a 0 I would.  We were traveling to NYC with our 3 children (10, 8, 1) for 5 days.  I did countless hours of research to find the right hotel.  Hotel Watson seamed to fit the bill in terms of location and price.  When we got there we realized quickly that was all they had to offer.  Our ride on the elevator started the downhill slide.  It rattled and sounded as though it would stop at any moment. The rooms were worse than most hourly hotels.  When we arrived at our room the door was so flimsy that we thought it could easily be kicked in.  Once in the room we found that there were absolutely no ammenities (mini fridge, bottles of water, etc.). The room hasn't not been updated since the 70s. The AC ran constantly but never actually got our room cold. The ice machine on our floor was broken and there was no vending maching on our floor.  When we went to the 2nd floor for ice we were able to fill up but the vending machine there didn't work. We notified the hotel staff but the AC, Ice Machine and Vending Machine were never fixed. While the above was terrible, customer service, or lack there of was the true issue for our stay. One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was due to the roof top pool. Our kids were so excited to spend their evenings there before dinner.  After our first full day in NYC (and walking for 10+ miles) we were ready to hit the pool.  We had seen a sign in the elevator during our check in that said the pool would be closed on Tuesday (prior to our arrival) unless there was rain then it would be Thursday.  There was no update to the sign or notice given by the staff when we arrived that they would have to use the Thursday Rain Day.  Our kids got their suits on and we headed to the pool only to be turned away at the door. When I went to the desk to discuss our frusteration with the lack of communication on the pool closure the Manager was dismissive and rude saying that ""they could close the pool any time they wanted"" and ""The pool is managed separately so I can't help you"". Shortly following our discussion we met others in the elevator going to express their same concern. The next day there was a new sign stating the pool could close up to 5 times a year any day of their choosing without notice.  This is ridiculous and terrible for all families choosing this hotel for this ammenity. Following this terrible experience we hit up the pool two days later.  When we arrived 1/3 of the lounge chairs were unoccupied but had a sign stating they were reserved for certin people ALL THE TIME.  So we had no where to set, yet tons of open seating.  So DUMB. I would absolutely not recommend this hotel to anyone ever for any reason.",1,,
14,Art E.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,24,5,1.0,10/7/2018,DO. NOT. STAY. HERE!!! This is this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. My job booked the hotel for me and out of nowhere the day before my stay they claimed the room had not been paid for due to them not being able to take 3rd party authorizations (the only hotel on the planet that doesn't) so they literally called the police on me and I had to wait for my bosses assistant to come all the way from Brooklyn to pay for the room. Not only are the rooms disgusting (please see previous reviews other people have left) but the place is falling apart from the inside out. Their management is the worst. BEWARE DONT STAY HERE!!,,,
15,Eric W.,"Huntersville, NC",82,16,2,2.0,10/10/2018,Hotel staff are not exactly service oriented. Slow elevators. Rooms could use updating. Much better hotels to stay at in NYC for the same price.,,,

He rudely informed my friend that she couldn't check her decently sized bag to be held in the baggage room, it had to ""fit"" certain requirements, and be ""sealed"". The bag was large and full, and he stood there glaring at us. I proceeded to hand him all of my bags, shove her exploding bag into my already exploding backpack at some difficulty all while this creep was Leering over us. I set him straight pretty quickly and he reluctantly stomped off with our bags. We genuinely were afraid he was going to do something with our bags and were relieved when we returned to a FRIENDLY NORMAL POLITE bellhop who gave us our bags without hassle. We tipped him and went on our way. Just a warning-- spend your money elsewhere!!!!",,,

18,Royah N.,"Corona, NY",11,16,3,5.0,11/30/2017,"My 3 night stay at The Watson was a sweet one. Wanna know why? Sure you do. 1. Location: it's walking distance to the subway and is surrounded by restaurants, delis, and even 24 hour drugstores. Parking is right next door although I did not use it. 2. Walking In: The staff is very friendly and nice. The lobby is very pretty and welcoming. There is a bar in the lobby where you can also lounge and use the computer.3. Safety: At late hours, no one can just walk into the hotel, get on the elevator and walk around the hotel. The staff member at the front will ask for a room key to make sure the person is a guest. 4. Food: There is a restaurant and a gift shop inside of the hotel. There is also a copy of the menu in my room, although I didn't eat there it's nice to know I have options. 5. My Room: My room was clean and well put together. Flat screen TV, my own bathroom, a nice sized desk, and two double beds. Clean sheets, clean carpet, a full sized mirror, an iron and ironing board. 6. The Bathroom: Very clean. They had ""Stress Relief"" from Bath and Body Works in small travel sizes. The shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and bar soap. I thought that was pretty nice don't you?7. Housekeeping: The women are so sweet and do their job well! When I checked out, I left my work clothes in the room. I called once I got home and housekeeping said they would check for me and to call back in about an hour. When they did, they told me they found my work clothes and held on to it for me. I came in the following evening to pick it up. My stay at The Watson was great and I appreciate housekeeping for finding and holding on to my things. Thank you guys so much. Happy holidays.",3,,

However, just within the last couple of months, the hotel now is charging a destination fee on top of the room charge - about $20 - when I do my usual booking through booking.com.  So the advertised price may be very attractive, but when the hidden destination fee is added with city and other taxes, not a great deal anymore.  Will not stay there again.  Playing games and deceptive.",1,,

It's dated. The beds were not comfortable. Paint is chipping from the walls. And even the towels were some of the worst I've ever had - paper thin and rough. They've got a tiny lobby bar with bad wine and a shitty beer list. The breakfast was quite horrible, and in my opinion, should've been free.

The bar in the lobby was convenient and nice with a decent pour. Although, I cannot stand the fact that they automatically put gratuity on every check!! The hallways could definitely use some updating! They felt more like weird hotel hallways from an 80's hotel. My Daughter and I were booked in a group of rooms among several other mothers and daughters from our group. One evening there was obnoxious screaming coming from a room across the hall from us. I would've chalked it up to being in a hotel but this was absurd and obviously fake. Several of the mothers complained. We called security and it was apparently dealt with accordingly. (I'd personally swear the trashy people were obnoxiously loud on purpose with seeing all of the kids in our group in the hallways. Eye roll!) The bathroom was a decent size. The lobby seems dated. The restaurant food is alright. Nothing to write home about! Mostly frozen style food but serves it's purpose late at night when you don't feel like venturing out. The breakfast buffet was lack luster as well. The staff was super polite and mostly professional. The bartenders were always friendly!

Unfortunately, our next door neighbor happened to blast loud music around the same time we went to bed. We could hear them clearly since Watson is a hotel with no sound proofing. As the result, we called the front desk, the staff who picked up my called said these exact words to me "" it's only 10:30 on a Saturday; it's pretty early."" HORRIBLE customer service. Yes, of course I spoke to the manager; hope the hotel staff gets his ass fired soon2. They charge over $200 per night. For the same price, I could've booked a five star hotel like the Westin.

This hotel advertise a queen bed but it's actually a double.  When I spoke to the manager, he said ""this is queen standard"" if you want to upgrade you will have to pay more. PS we are already paying $300 per night.  Also, old and dirty.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND !!!!",,,

You'd think they'd be able to make it up to you but nope.. the management didn't care. No discount. Wish the lack of hot water was the only problem. The rooms are supposedly ""renovated"" but as you can see from other postings that it's all B.S. This place sucks.",1,,

I had a great dinner and a couple of cocktails. At about 1 am I went to ask a question from the night shift. The woman was extremely rude and she basically kicked me out of the hotel. Luckily, I had some juice left in my phone to call an Uber. The employee's  attitude was disrespectful and simply nasty. She has no business sitting behind the desk. Management should send her to take some courses in sensitivity training and how to be an effective employee in an high end hotel.",,,

This last year in 2018 when I stay there I was just a palled! The whole hotel smelled terribly, the elevators were so scary I I thought I was going to plummet to my death every time I got in there, and I'm pretty sure I saw a mouse crawling around the hallways. Not to mention The service was just horrible! No one was trying to make our visit comfortable or satisfactory. The girl who works at the front desk Rebecca was extremely rude! I will not be back here and I will be telling anybody who's coming to the city to stay far away from this establishment!",,,
41,D. M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,3,0,2.0,8/5/2018,"The thing that really soured this experience was the EXTREMELY rude, aggressive man at the front desk of the rooftop pool. I asked if I needed to sign in since the person I was staying with had signed in right before me, he said yes, so I went ahead and did so. Then I walked in, and a few seconds later, the guy turned and yelled very loudly at me for ""not signing in"". He proceeded to berate me in front of my friend and other guests, when I pointed out that I had signed in -- not only that, I'd asked him if I needed to, so he talked to me! I don't know if he was drunk or frankly just stupid, but when I pointed to my name on the sign-in book he clearly realized his mistake, and decided to double down and keep yelling angrily. Is this how you treat a customer? Scream and berate them, then refuse to apologize? Disgusting.Add to that that the bell-desk is woefully underemployed (it took every guest at least 20-30 MINUTES to get their luggage when checking out) and the place is kind of low-rent and dirty, I would say you can do a lot better in New York City.But note to the owners: hire someone new at the pool, because NO ONE should be screaming at guests, or aggressively trying to start fights despite being 100% in the wrong. Unacceptable. Stay somewhere else.",,,

Apparently they are not legally obligated to provide heat until a certain time of year. It's November. Also there's a hole in the wall with a piece of drywall leaning up against it. It appears to be an access panel for a leaky pipe and dirt. The blankets were stained, they charged us for a refrigerator, and at over $300 a night this place is a real turd. I could overlook all the little gross or cheap aspects of this pile, but not providing us heat for our infant was pretty despicable.",5,,

49,Merna C.,"Bridgewater, NJ",67,4,0,1.0,10/22/2017,"Save your money! Spent almost $300 on a last minute stay for the MS Bike Ride. First they didn't have my reservation so we had to wait till their system ""updated"" about 20 minutes. No remorse from the staff, like it was normal to lose a reservation. Next, we head up to our room which is in the ""B"" tower. I guess it's where they put people who's reservations they lose. This was the worst shape I've seen a NYC hotel! Elevator was tint which is normal in NYC but made so much noise and was clearly so old. Room is old and crummy but yet you have to pay $5 cash to a bell man for storage to hold your bike down stairs. The service is the worst I've ever seen. With several of my family members in the hotel business, I have an idea of the importance of service and how much its quality makes a difference in your stay. When we got back from the ride, we asked the bellman to hold our bikes for 5 minutes while we grab our things for checkout. They asked for another $5!!!!!!!!!! We already paid $10 and all we needed was 5 minutes to grab our things. Then, as I sat waiting with the bikes as my husband went to retrieve our things, someone (I assume the manager) in an awfully fitting suit asked me to not have my feet touch the chair. It's a chipped, crummy chair!!! And I'm trying to keep my bike up! So much more I can go into but all in all the place is a scam and a dump. Avoid it at all cost.",3,,

Hotel staff were either really friendly and helpful or rude and unprofessional front desk experience left a lot to be desired Rooms were in decent shape A.C units barely cooled room it was warm the entire stay. Hallways are in disrepair common areas need to be renovated the best feature of this property is rooftop pool . With one exception an elderly overweight man claiming he owns the hotel is on the roofdeck playing security guard arguing with hotel guest made the swimming experience weird his need to shout out he's the owner made me feel like he doesn't own the property at all he's just a vagabond who lives in the pool shed strange experience to say the least on the cheap hotel is a good choice any price over $120.00 per night is too much for this property.,,,

As far as the room itself, I got a single queen size room. Was very roomy and the bed was very comfortable. There's not much I can say bad - even the all you can eat breakfast was good.

Pros: pretty good room size for NYC, conveniently located in Hells Kitchen. lots of good restaurants nearby. Bath and body works toiletries provided.Cons: pool hours are from 10-6 so if you are on business you likely can't use for swimming laps. I did have to ask for the bathroom to be cleaned when we got there as it was not up to snuff ( i just noticed  a few pieces of hair on the floor in the shower area)neither here nor there: has ac, but the unit was very old and didn't cool the room down as effectively as it could have. we had it set to max and i could be comfortable in a tank top.",1,1,

We got it as part of a Booking.com deal for a total of $280 for two nights in a double room, but it's my understanding that it's much more expensive regularly.

It is evident that they are not keeping up with taking care of the hotel and updating it. The carpets are worn. In our room, there was mold all over the bathroom ceiling and tiles in the shower. The shower does not drain properly so you're standing in inches of water that keep rising as you're taking a shower. Neither the bathroom door nor the closet door close properly. It is a struggle to get either one to close. When I went to plug in something in the wall socket the wall socket pops right off the wall because it was so loose. Talk about a dangerous situation. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one star is because the bed was actually decent to sleep in and it's a convenient location to Hells kitchen. I arrived a little early to check-in but the room was ready. Would you believe they charged me $25 extra to go to the room early even though it's ready and I was only like an hour early?

It's non-sense! So we ended up paying $40 additionally which means the room cost us $100 something per per night. Seriously!? There are tons of other hotels in the area that I could have enjoyed better with this price. I'm paying over a hundred bucks for an old and dirty hotel and the location isn't that great. There is no mini fridge in the room neither ice machine on our floor. In addition, when we got the room, the wifi didn't work, so we had to go to the lobby with exhaustion as we just arrived from a long ride. They allowed us to change to a different room but wait it isn't over yet, the new room had a used towel from the previous guest that the housekeeper didn't pick up. I was pretty upset at that moment. So I called, somebody came and didn't even apologize for this matter. Omg!It's my first time experienced all these as I traveled a lot. I regreted to stay at this hotel for my NEW YORK trip.

On his second day in the room with his girlfriend a Mouse ran from under the radiator to under the bed! Totally unexceptional. His girl was disgusted she wanted to leave. The front desk changed their room, gave them a couple of drink vouchers for the bar and discounted the room $50 off. This hotel needs major inspections and pest control immediately.

The elevators were terrible. They were very small trying to fit a family of 4 with suit cases was nearly impossible. We resorted to using the fire escape to get to and from our room. Thank God we were on the 3rd floor. The pool was a joke. It was nice but crowded. You could only enjoy it if you had a lounge chair but you could never get one. Life guard spent most of his time in the equipment closet on his phone. When I brought these concerns up to the front desk while checking out, she said that I should have brought it up sooner.

The bathtub drain was clogged and I'm 99% sure the bedsheets weren't that clean, but I wasn't going to make a big fuss. On the last night, my sister was packing while I was sitting on the other bed ironically googling ""bed bugs at The Watson"" because I had acquired 8 bug bites while sitting on the bed. It was about 3:30-4 in the morning. She screamed an ear piercing scream and jumped on the bed and told my husband and I that she just saw a rat under the desk near our trash can. At first, we were skeptical because when my husband and I checked it out, we didn't see anything nor any opening that the rat could have came through until I looked under the AC where my sister said she saw it run under and there was an opening in the carpet. We were in room 632 in the north tower, btw. We called management and they sent someone over to look at it. The guy seemed very unphased, as if this wasn't new. Management did offer us a new room and said they'd offer our last night for free which was nice but honestly, it was just incredibly inconvenient for us to have to switch rooms when we were going to check out in a few hours anyways. Despite our bathtub being clogged in the first room and the second room having a toilet that doesn't flush properly, we were pretty tolerant. But a rat??? A free night wasn't going to compensate for the stress and frustration we endured. It is New York City and people should expect rats unfortunately and I understand that. Will I stay at this hotel again? Probably not. But management was helpful nonetheless and our stay was pleasant up until our last night so I definitely don't think it's a terrible hotel but they could use some improvements.",4,,

87,Valeti G.,"Arundel, ME",2,4,0,1.0,6/2/2018,"Trust me....you would never really wanna stay in this hotel. Few things I have to accept like being close to Times square and other places, its not worth the money you spend. Few things to that dissapointed usPrice : As we were in a last minite rush to book the hotel, We found this is to be reasonable(having said this, we paid a loooot higher than the usual amount) but believe me we should have let go the extra bucks we tried to save instead of spending a horrible night. Comfort: Just because they were in the middle of city with high demand, doesn't mean they can ignore customer satisfaction and comfort?? The beds, oh please, you could really hear spring creaking when you roll. You can smell dust in the room. Air conditioner doesn't work. I can really go on...like thisService: Screw comfort, we were so irritated by the service they offer. No one responds in any of the lines on phone. No one answers to your questions. STAYING IN THIS HOTEL IS A REAL NIGHTMARE. I am writing this review @1 AM as I couldn't get the sleep in the ""MOST"" comfortable hotel",,,
88,Del N.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,0,2.0,6/28/2018,"This is an old hotel. Facilities are ok and rooftop pool. Drinks at the bar are $9.50 a pint, but sadly this is what you expect to pay in hotels generally. However, we had a terrible experience as the room walls are super thin and the room next to us had what sounded like 8-12 people in the room talking loudly till 3am. Asked reception to sort it out but they didn't do anything. Would not really recommend this place for that reason. Location is close to Central Park",,,

91,Nicole P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",7,1,0,1.0,9/18/2018,"plus is a good location and nice staff! cons:1.at first you have an really good impression when you enter the lobby ! next you have to take one of the very slow elevators, which take a loooong time ! it took us about 15 minutes twice to get to the second floor !! 2. there is always a strange smell like sweat in the room, which you can not get rid of! (cause of the shower curtain) 3. the bed felt like it has been used since forever! 4. we booked the room also because of the rooftop pool! turned out they already closed it on september 3rd, so we had no chance to use it ...4. there was a mouse in our room the second night !!!! when i called the reception they offered us a different room! i had the feeling that there has been a mouse / rats problem a lot ! they told us they will send someone to our room, half an hour later a man arrived with a plastic bag?! i dont know what he was supposed to do with that ! when we told him that we can change our room, he said; oh ok! and left again! without even taking care of the mouse under our bed ! overall experience - i wouldnever stay there again ... didn't even get a discount due to the mouse problem...",,,
92,whitney a.,"San Jose, CA",88,16,14,3.0,6/19/2018,"To start off, when we arrived it was 3 1/2 hrs early to our check in time at 3pm. We were able to hold our bags there while we explored the city. Although, if you have single items like blankets,snack bags, and jackets they will not. As we asked the worker that stored our luggage, he said they don't hold single items. He put all our stuff in a big plastic clear trash bag and told us us they could hold it in the front desk so we took it to the front desk only for front desk assistant to get the manager to tell us they don't hold large bags because there is no space (only small bags). So we were pretty disappointed as the bag was pretty heavy and full of things we had no need to carry around NYC. The worker who had helped us with our luggage storage originally came up to us and asked us what the hotel front desk had said. We told him they said no, he rolled his eyes and took our bag and stored it for us anyways. We tipped him, we were very grateful, that's what I call true customer service. We came up to our room at check in, room was clean. Can't complain it was exactly what I expected. Rooftop Pool was cool, although the day we arrived the pool was closed for a private party. Pool hours 10-7:30 in the summer time. I didn't try the wifi, I was there for vacation not work so I don't know how well the connection was. I didn't drink at the bar inside the hotel as there are so many other fun places to explore in NYC.   It is a great location 10-15 minute walk to Time Square. We stayed on the 11th floor which had a nice view out the window. I stayed there 3 nights with my family, the first night we chose not to get our room cleaned just for privacy reasons. But the next day we needed towels. I called the house keeping and asked for 6 towels, and she very rudely said ""6! How many people are staying there?"" I was very surprised by her response. I said l, ""I need a towel for my  body and my head."" I just felt like that was an unnecessary rude response.  She said, ""I will tell them that, I don't know if they will give them to you."" And sure enough they did not only 4. I would have been happy with ""I'm sorry we can only provide 4 per room each day."" So overall, I would stay at this hotel again because of the location and the price was more affordable then most hotels around. I give it 3 stars because of the lack of customer service, parking is expensive so if you plan on driving a car, I don't recommend it. Just to park there an hour is $35. We parked there just to unload our luggage for less than half an hour and had to pay $10.",,,

First they acted as if they could not accommodate my stay. Then after a long wait they got it together. I got to my room and decided to order in from a local Chinese place. I order the food and they didn't send me any utensils so I went down to the bar area for some utensils. They sent me back to my room saying ""you have to call room service for it"" well that was odd but ok fine. I did as told. I ordered utensils, a soda, and a extra plate to be brought up. The guy comes and then he tells me the price which was $8. I'm confused, what's $8? The sod is only $2, a canned soda. He then tells me there is a $6 room service fee. I say ""ok charge it to the room"" and he says ""no you have to pay in cash"" I couldn't believe it. How are you charging me $6 for a service that comes with the hotel, it's called HOSPITALITY!

98,Edward K.,"Brighton, MA",220,3,0,1.0,5/25/2018,"This was probably the worst hotel experience I have ever had and I've been to a couple of modestly priced hotels around the country when traveling with my friends. First things first, for a hotel of this caliber the price was unreasonably high. I had first attributed this to the naturally expensive costs of New York and the location of the hotel. However, I found out that there were much far superior hotels in the heart of Times Square listed for virtually the same price. Secondly, the hotel was dreadfully drab; the ambience akin to that of a low budget motel snuff film. The room lacked any vibrancy, the lights in the room were discolored and dull, and there was a sufficiently sickening stench of sweaty gym clothes that permeated the room. Thirdly, the amenities provided by the hotel were minimal at best. Sure, a refrigerator, indoor slippers, bathrobes, and lotions may be superfluous to the casual traveler but this was the first hotel I had been to where neither a toothbrush nor toothpaste were provided. Perhaps these are also an exorbitant amenities that the hotel's guests are not worthy of. Fourthly, I'd like to take a step back to when I first tried to enter the room and both keys provided to me failed to work (I have tried to swift in-n-out method as well as the casual slider method and even the Zootopia sloth method). Only after a frustrating couple of minutes did these cards work. The card functioned normally later during the day but returned to its old habits on my second day. Fifthly, the safe in the room would not lock and the hotel was always too busy with ""security training"" for someone to come and take a look. So I did the next best thing for storing my valuables and headed to the front desk where they offered to store my stack of graduation cards and cash. The lady who had helped me seemed slightly disgruntled by my request and proceeded to shove the cards into the safe, crumpling the meaningful messages sent to me by my dearest friends and family. But what do these gifts mean to this mean lady anyways? I could let this one slide but when the lady was handing me the keys to the safe she handed me a slip of paper while pointing to the signature line on said paper. Her hand covered most of the fine print as she rushed me to sign the paper saying it was just part of the protocol. As she swiftly retracted the signed paper I caught a glimpse of the words ""$100"" and ""lost key"" to which I thought, ""why would you cover that kind of information and deliberately keep me uninformed of such a policy?"" But again, some fault lies on me for not having seized the paper from her hateful hands and perused the scam print - I mean fine print. Finally, upon checking out I was told that I had watched a movie I had never watched. To which I argued that I had brought my laptop and an hdmi cable so there would be absolutely no reason for me to pay $11.99 for a commodity I could easily find on the web. I would rather spend the night on the nice cozy benches of Central Park than in The Watson.",,,
99,Gina S.,"New Orleans, LA",65,1,0,1.0,6/29/2017,"I came mainly for the pool but I would not recommend that because the pool has ""members"" (snobby entitled NYers) while it should be for hotel guests. Seats and tables are also reserved for these ""VIPs"". Furthermore, these members are very rude to hotel guests. We brought food to eat by the pool and security was immediately called on us by multiple members who ganged up on us because they were aware of this obscure rule posted small in another section of the pool area. Also our toilet was clogged! Overall a poor experience. Your money is best spend elsewhere.",5,1,

101,Michelle S.,"Rockville, MD",0,2,0,1.0,8/14/2017,"Total mess of a hotel.  The location is the ONLY thing this place has going for itself.  The hotel seems ok upon entrance- the lobby may be the only area that really gets cleaned or taken care of.  The rooms are dusty, smell strange and do not feel clean.  The bathrooms are not taken care of at all.  The water temperature reaches warm at most-  we were basically taking borderline cold showers.  Walls are thin and you can hear neighboring rooms flush their toilets and shower.  We reserved a double queen room- the beds are NOT queen sized and we were told we could have a total of 3 people....how is that possible with a double queen booking??There are no ice makers anywhere in the hotel yet rooms come with an ice pail? The AC was either on ice cold or did not work at all, so that only made the room smell worse.  Perhaps the cherry on top of this terrible stay was fact that I needed to warm milk for my baby and so my husband went to the bar to ask if milk could be heated.  The bartender said this was not a possibility.  He offered to heat up the bottle itself, to which my husband stated that would not be safe.  The bartender then proceeded to try to argue with my husband about the safety of heating plastic and that it is not that bad for babies....All in all, terrible stay. Waste of money. Looks good from the lobby but service and room upkeep is awful.  Don't waste your time here!",1,,

I went to the front desk and was accused of smoking in my room, had my privacy invaded by security and the manager going through it, and was told I was going to pay a $250 smoking fee or would be forced to leave the hotel. After arguing back and forth with a rude light skinned lady a higher up manager with some sense listened to our side of the story and let us stay. After being attacked the way we were I no longer even wanted to stay at the Watson. Moral of the story is don't stay here!

103,Kristin P.,"Brunswick, OH",99,10,6,1.0,8/6/2017,"This review only has one star because zero wasn't an option. Let's start from the beginning. My two girlfriends and I stayed here during our girls trip weekend. When we pulled up to check in and valet we weren't offered any help with our bags which we were clearly struggling with. Strike one. However, the check in itself was very smooth. We got to our room and were quickly disappointed. It's was outdated, grungy, and dirty. The shower had black mold and the toilet hardly flushed. Underneath the beds was home to random trash wrappers. Chocolate wrappers and maybe a legos toy wrapper. Uh ok. Strike two. The room was unusually hot so we decided to go to the pool and hopefully cool down. Wow. Let me say that again backwards. Wow! That was weird. The owner of the hotel was there and began talking to us. Which was nice, we're social people. But. The dude literally stood in the pool next to us talking about himself, law suits the hotels had, and past customer complaints for about an hour while we were continuously being splashed by the 20 parentless kids there. Just wasn't too professional or productive and made things uncomfortable. I've never in my life saw the owner of a hotel lounging around the pool whistling and shouting demands at the staff in front of guests. Strike 3. We left the pool and stopped at the hotel bar for some snacks. The food was horrible and I would be mortified if my establishment served it. I wish I had taken pictures of it but was so dumbfounded I didn't think of it. When we mentioned to the bartender that the pigs in a blanket didn't look ok to eat he said ""it's a fried food what do you expect?""  Well sir, I expect my food to look edible. And not like it rotted in the back of a fridge for a month. Needless to say one of my girlfriends spent her evening in the bathroom with said toilet that hardly flushed. Poor thing. Strike 4. Oh yea. The room was still smoldering. I called the front desk and they offered a box fan  uh ok. The final straw was when we went to get the car from valet to leave. Once again not being offered help with our bags. When trying to pay the valet guy told us 3 different totals and tried getting us to swipe our credit cards multiple times even after it said it had gone through. Sketchy. Are we still counting strikes?  Overall the only thing this place has going for it is the location. If you're still reading I beg you to forget this place exists and find elsewhere to stay. No matter how attractive the price is.",1,,

But then , I am always nice. You get what you give! We were sitting at the pool enjoying a great music playlist and the asked the lifeguard what station we were listening to and he said it's the owners play list.  I said I wanna meet this guy I love !

108,Sammi G.,"Springfield, VA",14,47,10,1.0,4/8/2017,"I'm currently still here and I hate this hotel with a passion. Hence. Why I am writing a review...From the moment my co-workers and I walked in and checked in it was an absolute annoyance. 1) The workers are rude as heck, front desk didn't seem to want to assist and mind you this is why I prefer to book everything through a website.(Booking.com) I don't want to deal with the nasty attitudes FD has. I have never had an overcharge on a room while checking in to anything. I happened to click 3 people staying in the room while reserving online and when I came we ended having a 4th person. I understood the charges for that, however I was charged a whole $100 more between fees, taxes, and an additional person. I have never had such a long check in. We came for a business convention for our freelance work and was scheduled to be there at 3pm. Because it took so long we ended up getting to the venue at 4 after checking in and bringing all of our stuff up. The bellman was super nice...but it just doesn't stop here.2) I've worked in restaurants and hotels for over 10 years and I believe in high standards when it comes to hospitality. You are in this business for a reason. Hire the right people without attitudes. After coming back from the convention we decided to give the hotel bar a chance. Hungry and thirsty. Went to the skyline bar and took us almost 15 minutes to get greeted. Finally a older Hispanic  man came over from behind the bar after going back and fourth with another bartender about who was gonna take the table. I'm super observant when it comes to restaurants. I've managed, served, and bartend for many years. 10 minutes passed again and he finally came back. Asked us what we wanted to eat and stood there pretty much tapping his pen and notepad. There's 4 of us, and we had questions about the menu.  Very resistant to answering most questions. Two of us ordered alcohol beverages and when we actually finally got it he came back with two of the wrong drinks being he wrote things down. I didn't say anything because I understand it's a loss having to comp something. However my friend spoke up about it. He took it back and changed it, with a discomfort on his face. His fault. Not ours. Few minutes go by and a younger Asian man came by and told us that the kitchen was backed up, which was perfectly fine with us. We understand. I appreciated the effort he gave by letting us know. About an additional 20 minutes went by and some of the food came out. We thanked and responded by letting him know we were missing a few items. He apologized and went to fix the issue immediately. Part of the food came out cold and messed up. It was sent back and fixed. When he returned he brought back everything except for one entree that we ended up waiting 15 more minutes for. When I tell you the timing, it's in all seriousness legit numbers. We saw the Hispanic man run over to dive for food that was being cleaned up for an event that was being held at the bar. And instead of checking up on us he went behind the bar to eat and brought to the corner to eat. Super unprofessional and unsanitary. While he was grubbing the Asian guy was running around with his head cut off bussing tables and running food. How sad. You have employees who are standing around not doing their job and employees who need back up. Anyways. We finally finished out food, sat there while we waved 6 times to get some boxes. Asked the Hispanic man to get it, and the Asian guy runs back to give it to us. Trying to be patient we then wait again for the Hispanic man to return...*head about to explode* he came back I asked him to please get us our checks separate like I had told him before we got started on our order. He laughed and walks away, comes back 7 minutes with a notepad to ask us what we had...by this time I'm just extremely frustrated. Anyways we all know how this turns out. I am an avid 20% or more tipper, and hate being misjudged. However this tip out was not earned. $83 dollars later. We ran after the Asian man and tipped him his own amount. When you do good things for other it comes back around. 3) Our room has no A/C, it was not mentioned during reservations. All of us were dying...called the next morning to FD to see if it was just our room and he said they only have a cooling and heating system. AWESOME. Thanks for letting us know we can crack the windows. Bathrooms were a joke, toliet is like a public restroom with the metal kick flushers...-.- shower heads are busted and squirt water everywhere.  Hot/cold water are labeled incorrectly...they were polar opposites. I was done at this point. Housekeeping super nice, gave us extras of everything we called for and we tipped for that too. :)4) Noise? Don't worry. You will have parties next door with no privacy and no one to shut them up. Running up and down the hallways. Drunk to the point where they kept trying to open our door with the keys. Sigh. FRONT DESK SUCKS!",8,1,

I'd expect a more comfy bed and an updated bathroom at a pricier hotel, but at the low price for the Watson, I can't complain. I'd stay here again.",,,
118,John M.,"Stevenson Ranch, CA",0,8,0,1.0,12/11/2017,"I would give this zero stars. Incredibly rude staff, outdated old holiday inn bathrooms, overpriced bar for what they offer. Stay away!!",,,
119,Sydnee L.,"Blue Point, NY",268,2,0,5.0,8/9/2017,"Okay, so I LOVED this hotel! Such a fair price for a really good room to start. And I was here for my birthday, and I stopped at the bar before going out and they noticed my tiara and brought me out a wonderful free cheesecake with a candle, sang a birthday song, and were SO sweet. Also shoutouts to Mason & Daryl for the Jell-O shots! They are so amazing here!",,,
120,Charlie V.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",72,3,0,3.0,4/25/2017,Good for the price and location but not the best hotel in NYC by any means. Elevators need to be replaced and the staff can be a little friendlier but over all not the worse stay,,,
121,Gerry L.,"Seal Beach, CA",25,13,0,2.0,10/20/2017,This hotel is not a 4 star like booking.com rates it. The rooms are old. Don't be fooled by the pictures of the lobby.,,,
122,Hassan H.,"Brooklyn, NY",6,5,0,3.0,10/10/2017,"The hotel in a convenient location for business visitors and tourists. However, the hallways and the lobby are of need of upgrade is the hotel want to continue to claim its four star status. Attending a training seminar for day at the hotel, the conference room was just fine.However, the hotel staff was very rude. Furthermore, the Gotham Cafe at the hotel is run by even more rude individuals. The service was very poor and slow. For example, the waiter took our order in hurry without asking us how we would like our meat cooked or whether we needed anything to drink. It took them very long time to bring the food leaving us no time to eat before getting back to the training on time. When we entered the cafe we explained to the greeter that we have only 45 minutes break and they promised us to serve us with plenty of time to eat. The food arrived on our table when we had only one minutes to get back to the training room where food is not allowed. This happened after we were told at least five times that the food is coming in two minutes and it did not. The greeter was busy sitting on a table with the young lady that works behind the cashier socializing and laughing and both seemed annoyed by clients calling their attention to service.",,,
123,Gabriel C.,"San Jose, CA",0,5,1,5.0,9/12/2017,"Such accommodating and friendly staff! I can't imagine why people gave low stars. We stayed for fashion weekend. We loved the location, the pool, the staff (all were really nice), mix of guests and, did I mention the location? Also, my baby got sick and they let us check out extremely late to let her get extra rest. I would recommend this for any traveller on a budget who wants to still stay somewhere convenient and nice.",,,
124,alexandria a.,"Santa Monica, CA",1,3,0,1.0,10/17/2017,"Absolutely awful hotel.  When I arrived I was treated very rudely by the front desk.  I was given door keys that didn't work.  The windows in my room were so dirty you could barely see out of them.  The carpets were stained.  The bed was so uncomfortable and the bathroom/closet area were so small.  The only good thing about this awful hotel was the bartender who made great drinks and the maid who was incredibly friendly and helpful.  Whatever you do, don't book this hotel.",,,
125,Steve C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,260,2,1.0,6/23/2017,"Visited some friends who were staying in this hotel. The staff was extremely rude. Some guy started banging wildly on the door at 11pm when we were in the room hanging out. We weren't expecting other visitors so we didn't open the door immediately. Once we looked out the peephole and then opened the door, he yelled at us for not opening the door at the first moment he knocked. He yelled something about us being too noisy and then stormed off. Ok, it's fine to ask guests to be quiet. BUT, you don't have to be an asshole about it. This guy was an asshole about it.",1,,
126,Belinda G.,"Schertz, TX",0,28,21,3.0,6/7/2017,"The driveway is small and parking is by valet only. If you need something out of your car they will get it for you, but you can not go to your car. Parking is of course expensive. The hotel is dark and dated, but Nice enough. The gift shop was not open. It is supposed to be being renovated, but right now is non existent. There are no food vending machines so your only option for a snack is room service or something outside of the hotel. There are ice machines on every other floor and sometimes they have ice. On the other floors they have Pepsi machines. Room service is reasonable and fairly quick. We had a king size dream and it is spacious. We had a connecting door to our kids room that is two double beds. Bathrooms are spacious but tiles do have some mold in the grout. There is plenty of hot water! The toilets are definitely old style but work well. We rented a small refrigerator for a fee, but there was no microwave available to make popcorn like the kids wanted. Housekeeping seems a little hit or miss. Did not clean out or replace the ice bucket bag, did not replace the shampoo, conditioner, lotion, or tea bags. Did replace coffee K cups.",1,,
127,Brandon N W.,"Trenton, TX",91,21,10,2.0,7/24/2017,"Overall, it was just OK. The rooms were clean, but old (there WAS mold in the shower/bathroom walls and that really grossed me out). Our AC did not work during the heat wave, so they sent someone to tune it and a 2nd person to plug in a fan. We had the fan blowing 100% of the time and that helped a great deal, although I guess I was hoping to be placed in a new room. All in all, if you have the attitude of just needing a clean bed to sleep in for a decent price, this is a great hotel. The elevators were somewhat of an irritation, I took the stairs several times instead due to the slowness and amount of people waiting for them. They are slow and creaky and sometimes took several minutes to get to you. The pool was great, and clean. Loved the music they played at the pool but getting a chair at the pool can be challenging. We had a late night dessert at the restaurant and the service was wonderful, food was good. We had a couple of encounters with the room cleaning service as well and the ladies were always very, very pleasant. The bed gave my husband and I both a backache, we tried to sleep on the outer edge of the bed as the middle was sunken in. We are content with our stay in general!",,,
128,Bradley S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,0,1.0,9/8/2017,"The watson hotel is a unfriendly, sneaky, filthy place to stay or work at. The upper heads dont appreciate the workers nor the guest. They simply care about is ratings and rooms to be sold. I worked her for a few months now and never been more happy to walk away from a work place. There also only favor there own RACE. This place and the HR director John. The house keeping manager vitore can suck my whole fat dick.",,,
129,Travis A.,"Godfrey, IL",0,4,0,2.0,6/7/2017,"The hotel was decent and nice rooms. The staff was very rude even upon check-in. They were not a welcoming hotel at all and for that I do not recommend this hotel. I was politely asking for a new trash bag and was told ""knock on that door"", which is fine, but odd that they were not accommodating and did not say it politely. For people like myself who travel a few times a year, it is not worth it and you should stay elsewhere. I have been to NYC dozens of times and never had staff so rude and unfriendly.",,,
130,Rod A.,"Shelbyville, IN",0,7,0,3.0,7/5/2017,So so Ok. Staff was courteous. Dated decor. Some mold in bathroom up near the ceiling. And an ant problem in the bathroom. The restaurant on the main floor was decent. Good service. Pool was nice on the roof top but water was cold. Good location. Price paid for the accommodations was a good value overall.,,,
131,Linda B.,"Denver, CO",0,113,0,4.0,4/30/2017,"The rooms are larger than most hotel rooms. The room was comfortable. The shampoo, lotion conditioner were from Bath and Bodyworks and smelled great. The price was good as well. Housekeeping here is wonderful. I would stay here again.",,,
132,Jessica R.,"Columbia, SC",69,36,10,2.0,4/16/2017,"Elevators didn't function properly and it probably took a solid 15 minutes to get from the top of the hotel to the lobby and vice versa. Bar service was also an issue. It took 45 minutes for a slice of cheesecake to arrive??? Oh and my husband and I were staying on the second to highest floor and after one night there, woke to a bathroom COVERED in ants. And I can guarantee we didn't eat in the bathroom. Housekeeping manager just squashed them all, threw them in the trash, and told us to let him know if it happened again. 5 minutes after he left I watched 3 more ants file out of a hole under the shower so I went to reception to complain. Luckily found someone who was very apologetic and who upgraded our room for the following night at no additional charge and gave us breakfast vouchers. But that didn't help the fact that the walls were paper thin and almost all the sheets seemed somewhat dirty and permanently stained. Location is convenient but that's about all you'll benefit from by staying in this hotel.",,,
