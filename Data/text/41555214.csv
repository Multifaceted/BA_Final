0,Jess M.,"New York, NY",1,7,0.0,5.0,10/19/2018,One of my favorite restaurants on the planet. The wine selection is amazing and so are the cocktails. The atmosphere is quaint and chic. The food is always delicious. The egg and mushroom appetizer is to die for. Service is always great. Usually just show up and wait 30min - 1hr getting a drink nearby rather than make a reservation.,,,
1,Mahesh P.,"Austin, TX",14,335,1295,4.0,6/12/2018,"Stellar Cocktails - great (if a wee bit pricey) food.So yeah, this is the kinda place you come to for the crowd and the cocktails (which, as I already mentioned, are *stellar*). If you come frequently enough, you'll start seeing the same folks over and over, which really isn't a bad thing - it just points out that this is a bit of a neighborhood-y place.If the prices were, oh, 30% lower, I'd be here all the time...",,,
2,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,4.0,6/7/2018,"I had been wanting to try Fedora for years, so I was thrilled when my friend selected it from the list of dinner options that I had provided.  When looking for reservations times, we were pretty limited to either 6:00-6:30 pm or after 9:00 pm.  We opted for the earlier time, but arrived at a completely empty restaurant.  Even when we left around 8 pm, there were still several tables available, which drove me nuts.  I would recommend calling directly if you do not see the time you want available online.  Ok, enough complaining - on to the good stuff!  Fedora's main dining area and bar were on the ground level of a beautiful brownstone, on a quiet block in the West Village.  The wooden furniture, dim lighting, rustic bar, and exposed brick wall really invoked a Prohibition vibe.  That theme spilled over to the fancy cocktail list.  My beverage, cutely entitled the ""Lil' Smoky"", had been composed of mezcal, Amaro Montenegro, elderflower, lemon, and ginger.  The Amaro gave the drink a pinkish-reddish hue, and the remaining ingredients added a sweet, spicy kick that was heavenly.  The shaken cocktail included several large ice cubes, which made it tough to sip at first, but, as they melted, the drink never seemed to lose its flavor.  My friend had ordered the Really Very Nice and Good, which was a lighter, refreshing mix of vodka, St-Germain, lemon, grapefruit, and sage.  Our beverages were paired with slices of fresh, doughy bread with mushy centers and satisfyingly crunchy crusts.We started our meal by sharing two appetizers.  The Black Bass Ceviche was a stunning, colorful dish that was packed with fresh fish, zucchini, husk cherry, and corn nuts for texture.  The acidity level was well-balanced and refreshing with hints of citrus.  The Shitake, Trumpet, and Oyster Mushroom plate had the earthy aroma one would expect from such a hearty combination of fungi that had been roasted in a brown butter sauce.  The mushrooms had been topped with a poached egg, whose yolk oozed yellow decadence over the rich vegetable blend.  From there, we proceeded on to individual entrees. My Sea Scallop dish was well-portioned with four reasonably large mollusks that had been expertly sautéed.  The tender shellfish was served with hearts of palm and shitake, and then covered with an XO sauce.  I was not sure if it was the red spice dusting on the scallops or something in the sauce, but there was such an overwhelming amount of pepper and spice that tickled and burned my throat to the point of sending me into several coughing fits.  While I loved the flavor, they could have dialed back the heat.  My companion enjoyed her Skirt Steak, which was very tender, and served with marble potatoes, arugula, and broccolini.  However, when I took a bite, I thought the steak could have used a bit more salt or seasoning, though it was otherwise tasty.  We also included a side of the Miso Eggplant, one of my favorite things to order at Japanese restaurants.  This version had a similar marinade, but was less saucy.  It was also topped with a generous amount of sesame seeds, as well as cilantro and some type of yogurt or ricotta, mixing the Asian essence with a Mediterranean flare that shockingly worked.From the refined service to the creative food and drinks, Fedora supplied us with a great evening.",4,,4
3,Lexi E.,"Austin, TX",373,137,41,4.0,5/20/2018,"Fun and delicious meal! Atmosphere: Hidden, old school, French restaurant.  There are an assortment of marble and wood tables inside. Wood walls, leather chairs, and only around 30 seats in the whole restaurant (half in tables and half at the bar).  We sat 5 people around a really intimate corner with a marble table.  Food/Drink: if you're going for wine, order a class of the Rhône! For some reason, at our reservation time of 10:39, we only had an assortment of appetizers and sides including the pork belly, braised greens, Brussels sprouts, lentils, and carpaccio.  All were delicious.  We also ordered a lot of tequila sodas, which were not amazing, but that was because of our order not the restaurants poor craftsmanship.Recommend for a party of 4 (if you can get a table) or a date night at the bar.  Staff was really nice.  Only 4 stars because the interior was a bit forgettable.",1,,1
4,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,3/27/2018,"There's a reason Fedora has serious staying power in the West Village. The popular supper club has been on my radar for several years at this point, and for some reason I only got around to visiting this past Saturday. Perhaps I knew it would still be there waiting for me, still as formidable as ever. Fedora is part of HC Hospitality, the same group that runs other well-known, West Village powerhouses such as Joseph Leonard, Jeffery's Grocer and Bar Sardine. It's not surprising, then, that Fedora feels like the quintessential West Village venue: it's cozy and intimate, nestled off 7th Ave South, and it boasts small menus that are masterfully constructed and executed. Though a heavily-trafficked spot (particularly on weekends), service was superb throughout. Made a reservation (pretty much mandatory here if you want seats) for a table at 8:15 on a Saturday night. You can reserve bar seating or table seat here, so it's unlikely you'll see an empty chair here as a walk-in. Just keep your eye on Resy and you'll be fine. The space itself is warm and intimate, lively with a subtle old-timey feel. Fedora is one of the many sub-street level venues in the area, which lends itself to the feeling of longevity you get here. Though it's an excellent spot for a date, keep in mind that Fedora is kind of a bar-restaurant hybrid, so the weekend rush/noise level at primetime is significant. It didn't detract at all from our experience, just fun to observe.I suppose that's as good of a segue as I'll get (read: allow myself) into Fedora's cocktail program. Between me and the bf, I got to try four drinks, all of which outstanding. The menu here is well-thought-out, varied, creative and elegant. Innovative combinations and intelligent twists-on-classics. My first drink was the No Shrubs (Lemon Verbana gin, yellow chartreuse, apple cider vinegar, walnut bitters), which gets extra props for the name. Somehow both familiar and adventurous. You might think Last Word but the ACV and walnut bitters shake it up. So good. The bf tried the Hey There, Bedroom Eyes (Cocoa-infused banks rum, campari, byrhh, orange oil), which wasn't his favorite but I personally loved it. Rich, perfectly-balanced, excellent for winter. Second round was the Black Squirrel Old Fashioned (Bourbon, Cherry Heering, maple, pecan bitters) for me and the Godspeed (red win, Jamaican rum, allspice dram, honey, citrus ginger beer) for him. That Old Fashioned is something special. A bit sweeter than your typical Old Fashioned but still grounding and warming from the nuttiness of the bitters. Food-wise, I really don't think you can go wrong here. The menu is fairly small so if you're into sharing, you can conquer a good portion of it with a small party size. Good balance of raw, cooked, meats, seafood, veggies. Exciting, elegant and sophisticated yet--similar to feel of the beverage program--familiar and comforting. A delicate balance that was seemingly struck effortlessly. Our eats, below: Spanish Mackerel Crudo w/ whipped ricotta, garlic chips, dill: A+Fresh, creamy, melt-in-your mouth good. Beautiful flavor combination here with the addition of the dill. Soft, silky, elegant. If you're looking for some extra texture, there are some crisps both sprinkled on top and to the side.Steak Tartare w/ smoked cream, trout roe, herb croutons: A+Flavorful and fun. Steak tartare is an easy go-to for me, and this was one of the better ones I've had. Every little component had its place and was in sync with the rest. Light but still powerful.Shiitake, Trumpet & Oyster Mushrooms w/ poached egg and brown butter: A+Decadent and warming. I love the bringing out the richness and complexity in mushrooms, and this dish was it for me. The egg and brown butter were just divine. Even the wary-casual mushroom eater will delight in this.Hemp-Crusted Pollock w/ leeks, asparagus, meyer lemon: AI'm always 50-50 on ordering white fish entrees because they run the risk of being bland and boring. This was approached, constructed and executed beautifully. The hemp was a fabulous touch, the flavors were delicate and earthy so as not to overpower the flavor of the pollock. Brussels Sprouts w/ Cider, Bacon: A+Nothing fancy about this one. Heaven in every bite. I love bacon, I love cider and I love Brussels. Brussels with bacon bits are great. Brussels with real chunks of thick-cut bacon, even better. Add was sweetness and a little char and you've got yourself a more-than-worthy side.",8,3,8
5,Robyn F.,"San Francisco, CA",62,461,1,4.0,11/5/2018,"Tried the scallop crudo (outstanding), Atlantic pollock (solid), Brussels sprouts (I've had better), and passion fruit pie (phenomenal).",,,

8,Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",168,1053,63,4.0,5/11/2018,"Fedora was very good. It would've been down-right special except that we were seated next to a couple of douches on both our left and right sides. Loud, rude, drunk, obnoxious- one asked if the waitress was pregnant (she was not-and didn't look it either). We almost walked out...Sensing our discomfort they eventually convinced the worst of the bunch to go to the bar. So we stayed put. Good thing we did because the food here was actually quite wonderful. We had the pork belly with lentils, the ricotta cavatelli, and a roast chicken stuffed with foie gras. They were all quite special...Too bad about the douches. They looked like regulars so hard to imagine we'd ever return. But maybe you'll have a different experience.",,,
9,Zachary S.,"Vero Beach, FL",305,355,3135,5.0,1/31/2018,"There's been a restaurant here since 1917. It's been Fedora since 1952, albeit no longer family run. I went in because I liked the look of the obviously weathered Fedora sign and the fact that you needed to go down four steps to get in. It looked like the entrance to a one time speakeasy. From the outside, it evoked the image of an old Greenwich Village restaurant. It oozed  a film noire aesthetic. A Hollywood location scout would definitely do a double take. Inside, there's an old dark wood bar. Great greeting once inside, especially on our first visit. The food was AMAZING. Sea scallops with parsnip purée, hen of the woods and pickled grapes was the best scallop dish I've ever had ($31). They were sweet, perfectly seared and sublimely complemented by the purée. Blackened sea bream with squid ink fried rice was another great entree ($27). The micro greens were a nice touch. Miso eggplant ($10) and roasted cauliflower ($10) made delicious sides. The wine and cocktail options ($14-$16) are thoughtfully done. It's a small place, so reservations are highly recommended. If you're nostalgic about Manhattan of Olde, and are looking for contemporary creative cuisine, you have to try Fedora.",6,1,4
10,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,5.0,1/14/2018,"I've never in my life had the desire to return to a restaurant again like I did after finishing my meal at Fedora. The ambiance is so intimate, romantic, and cool. The food is carefully crafted and unique in its flavors. The service is the definition of hospitality. Tried a multitude of things. First was the Arctic char ceviche, which was light and refreshing. Loved the bits of watermelon. My entree was the scallops, which were the perfect portion and a standout. The roasted chicken entree, while not a free-range chicken, was delicious and had a light amount of stuffing in it. Even a normally bland dish, like the cauliflower side, was a party in my mouth. The lemon tea was a great ending to the meal, and my company ordered a double espresso but said it was sour. Overall, a neighborhood gem, should be reserved for special occasions, and worth every dollar.",4,3,4
11,Kelly O.,"Langhorne, PA",12,211,62,4.0,6/7/2018,"This place was great - stopped here for a drink after dinner around the corner and really liked the place. Good drinks, bartender was nice, cute atmosphere. Overall, nice spot. Didn't try the food, but would like to next time.",,,
12,Marc R.,"New York, NY",2,23,10,5.0,5/26/2018,"Fedora is a great restaurant located in a townhouse in NYC's West Village.  Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection, which included scallops and roast chicken. Cool vibe in a former speakeasy with a youthful crowd and nice music",1,,
13,Roxanne R.,"Los Angeles, CA",57,175,127,5.0,12/11/2017,"Food that dances in the mouth and talks to your eyes as soon as it hits the table. That is what Fedora is about. From the time we entered to the time we left, my large group had a perfect experience all around.  We rented out the WINE CELLAR for a special work dinner. 11 people. We had the pork belly, the gnocchi marinara, the hangar steak, the Tuna, Brussels sprouts with bacon, eggplant with miso and sesame and sugar cake. They accommodate vegetarians and have a great selection of meat free  Dishes. All is the food is perfect. The Ambiance down in the wine cellar is very special. The cocktails and wine are wonderful.  I recommend the ""Lil Smoky"" There is no flaw to anything at this restaurant.  Service is impeccable and the experience makes for a very special occasion.

14,Eve C.,"Manhattan, NY",343,856,805,5.0,10/3/2017,"It's hip, cool and a neighborhood gem. The space is very intimate and warm. The servers are sweet and ready to give suggestions. The food is executed with the upmost precision. The sauces complement each of the other ingredients of the dish. The favorite of the night was the miso eggplant. The smoked cream made the dish extra special. The gnocchi were light and the tangy tomato sauce was perfect. The duck was so tender and added a nice meaty element to the dish. The deviled eggs are mustardy but ever so creamy. I would eat their brussel sprouts any day because of the nice pieces of bacon in the dish. It added the nice fattiness to the dish. Leave room for dessert because everything looks familiar but it has a twist to it. The key lime pie was tangy but still sweet and creamy. It was a very pleasant experience that I would do over and over.",1,1,1
15,Jenn G.,"Atlanta, GA",5,138,103,4.0,5/1/2018,"Wow! Make sure you book a reservation because we saw a few people turned away at the door due to lack thereof. We made a reservation for Sunday evening .. the food was exceptional! Ordered the squid confit, beef tartar, and shiitake mushroom to start.. The waiter was very knowledgeable so much so that he advised us to have the mushroom appetizer with the entrees as it would balance the meal more appropriately. Such good recommendation, as both the confit and tartar were cold, so to have a warm dish counter it may have been strange. The beef tartar was my favorite - light and fresh, it was everything you would expect and more. For entrees, we had the lamb ricotta cavatelli and roasted chicken .. I didn't care much for the cavatelli. Lamb is typically a hit or miss for me; I felt the meat was too muscular and musky in this dish. The roasted chicken, however, was phenomenal! The white meat was soft and tender, and well seasoned throughout; my only tiff was that, despite it being listed as having foie gras stuffing, the actual amount of foie gras was limited but it was so delectable when consumed! We closed out the meal with a vanilla bean and caramel toast/chew concoction which was delicious and flavorful! The sweetness of the vanilla bean played up the caramel, and I still salivate for that dish (keep in mind, I am not a big fan of caramel at baseline, so for me to say that is a great feat). We also had a round or two of their cocktails, and it was all very solid and strong. Definite recommend trying some with your meal. So would I return? Likely, but I would prob want to try other things... I definitely enjoyed its farm to table approach with a slight twist on traditionalism, and would def recommend this restaurant to others!",,,
16,Sophia W.,"Manhattan, NY",396,195,107,3.0,3/22/2018,"Fedora was recommended as a well known establishment in the village. The atmosphere was intimate and definitely commanded a little exclusivity. Reservation is recommended, especially for a weekend night. I had high hopes but found the dishes to be quite hit or miss. Although neither the bacon or the tacos impressed me, I was pleasantly surprised by the branzino with black rice. I probably won't be returning in the short term but would like to try it again.",,,

18,Ellen H.,"Manhattan, NY",37,52,6,5.0,3/29/2018,"What excellence looks and tastes like. Everyone else, please take note.Off the bat, Fedora gave out a good impression: our waiter was warm while not being over the top. He recommended wonderful cocktails for both of us, Sand in the crack and Lil' Smoky. Generous drinks with deep interesting flavors (I say generous because they were in big glasses, which I really appreciate).We ordered: the Spanish Mackerel Crudo, the Steak Tartare, Shiitake Mushrooms, Miso Eggplant and the Roasted Chicken. Our waiter very cleverly suggested we start with the first two and have everything else come out together. The two raw dishes were incredible, truly a great way to open your appetite. We paired the food with a bottle of Muscadet that hit all the right notes. The steak tartare was on the chunkier side and came with herb croutons which provided a good crunch. Same with the mackerel which had garlic chips for that crunch. Everything felt fresh and hearty.The chicken was a wonderful surprise, the saltiness of the foie gras really made it satisfying to eat, so was the sauce. The mushrooms were cooked in the most extraordinary brown butter - this is a dish you don't want to miss out on. Finally the eggplants were a nice touch of sweetness. We had the dessert cocktail and the vanilla semi freddo (ugh this was a step too far in retrospect). Both were delicious.Please make a reservation ASAP and bring that person you want to impress.",,,

20,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,698,1553,4.0,6/14/2017,"I've been putting off my review of here for a couple months since we hit the drinks menu a little hard... but I had a lovely time here, though it did not completely live up to my expectations.We had prime 7:30 pm Saturday reservations which I made about a week out, so I was surprised that about half the tables were taken. Very active bar scene though, so still felt like a happening place, but both tables next to us were empty. Nice for privacy, but didn't feel very exclusive. The decor is old school but hip, with black and white tile and legit art on the walls. The bar is the center of life and is gorgeous.We came to ball out, so we started with a crudo (I believe the striped bass crudo, but it might have been a special!), the carrots, and those famous deviled eggs. The crudo was fresh and had good flavor, and the vegetable dish made me feel healthier and had some thought put into it. I was meh on the deviled eggs; the trout roe and other toppings made it prettier but didn't add too much to the flavor.Our entrees were good! The skirt steak was cooked medium rare as requested, and though the sides are standard issue, they were tasty. My blackened sea bream was decent; I liked the squid ink fried rice. My boyfriend loved and devoured everything; I think I'm a little more jaded. Everything was well-executed and no misses, but many of these are dishes that I've had elsewhere.The beverage program is really stellar, however. I tried the Crosstown Traffic (tequila, gentian, cocchi, vemouth) and the Okie Dokie (gin, apricot, sherry, jalapeno) which were both strong but good. I favored the latter, and both were up to par with drinks I've had at Death and Co and similar places. My boyfriend went for the Untitled (scotch, coconut, velvet falernum, lemon) which was incredible. Smoky and well balanced. We ended up getting two of these and I kept making him switch with me.In general when I spend this much I expect the meal to feel a little more special, and it seems like you're paying more for the vibe than the food or the service here. The pace is appropriate (maybe two hours?) and service is knowledgeable. Noise level was good for conversation and steadily rose. Definitely romantic. Portions were decent, as we were stuffed and could have gone with a couple dishes less. And decent on the alcohol as well; we had to cab home after having two each. A shame since the location is so lovely and close to Washington Square Park.This seems more like a destination to get a fancy West Village cocktail. Use for an intimate, late-in-the-game date for drinks and a plate or two.",1,1,1

22,Emilie P.,"Jupiter, FL",0,3,0,1.0,7/15/2018,"This is a true story. Last night, one of my girlfriends and I were looking for a place to sit and chat and have a nice cocktail. We're locals so we went into Bar Fedora, an infamous date place where everything is only set up to accommodate two people, and told the Maitre D that we just wanted a drink, possibly food. He took a look at the 2-3 open tables to his right and pointed us in a direction of a bench, at the end of the restaurant, located just outside of the kitchen within the server area. He said he'd let us know when something 'opened up.' We stood thinking about it while another couple came in behind us, said the same thing - just drinks for two. He sat us first, at the bench, and then sat the two people who walked in AFTER us at the table open to his right. First of all, this in theory is not what was wrong. What ensued made it clear what he was doing was to hide us. Not a single person came and asked us for drinks, we were just whisked by constantly by the kitchen staff who kept running into my feet because to be fair I was basically sitting in the freaking kitchen. Finally I got up after ten minutes and asked to be seated at the bar, and that I would stand since there was only one spot open. ""I'll have to ask the Maitre D,"" the waitress said. I'm sorry - you'll have to ask if I can sit at the bar? Now we left but think of it this way - I could have very well have also been on a date with a girl, instead of a guy, and as a result, this restaurant sat us way in the back, in seating not even meant for patrons, while seating other straight couples who came in after us at a table. Tables were OPEN the entire time. We were never offered a seat. We left. Obviously.",,,

We swallowed our pride and ordered two drinks, and when we asked for a menu to get an appetizer, the bartender said he couldn't give us a menu because he would be taking our seats back shortly (Note: the place was dead).We were about to have dinner at the best place on the block (Mary's Fishcamp) so we didn't need to be there long, but was there a need to be such assholes?Tip: Do not stop by Fedora on your way to dinner at a better place.

My Hampshire pork chop (about $30) was tender, savory and came in a good-sized portion.

29,Aakruti V.,"Manhattan, NY",364,73,117,5.0,8/16/2017,"Even though I came into this restaurant with high hopes, my experience here still blew me away. Fedora was an amazing restaurant. I really enjoyed my entire experience. The staff was very friendly. We sat at the bar, and our server/bartender had a great energy. He was very friendly, and was very eager answer the million questions I had throughout the meal. He remained patient and pleasant the whole time. For the food/drinks, I started out with a cocktail with the name ""ladybug"" in it. It tasted more like juice, and not as much as alcohol, the way I like it. The flavor was unique and interesting (kind of apricot-y). If you like girly drinks, I recommend this cocktail. The appetizer was a plate of shaved peaches topped with cheese, pecans and herbs. It was one of the daily specials. This had to be the best appetizer I've had in a really long time. I could not stop eating it, and had I not been looking forward to the next course, I would have ordered another plate. It was very clear that the chef took great care in preparing it. Moreover, this dish was as creative as it was novel. It was visually appealing, well-balanced and, most importantly, delicious. For ny main course, I had a vegetarian version of the Ricotta Gnocchi. The restaurant was very accommodating of my dietary restrictions, which I greatly appreciated. They prepared me a special gnocchi with a vegetable stock-based sauce and seasonal vegetables. The ingredients were all farm fresh, and tasted like they were even grown with care. Even after the gnocchi was finished, I kept on eating the sauce, trying to figure out what was in it. Eating this dish was a complete delight. Regretfully, my stomach was too full by the end of the meal to order dessert, but I will definitely be ordering dessert in the future.",,,

31,Brittany F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4580,1590,1642,5.0,9/30/2015,"New York can sometimes be overwhelming in terms of the food options. It's without a doubt one of the best food cities in the world, which is why I often have a hard time deciding where to go.Fedora is the epitome of what New York dining is all about to me. Casual but cozy with a warm atmosphere, great cocktails, a superb wine list, and food that's going to impress.  I think I've found my new go-to in NYC. I've had this place booked marked for ages and I finally got to try it recently. I love that the space is dimly lit and a few steps down off of a bustling corner in the West Village.It was absolutely packed on a weeknight so be sure to make reservations in advance. They even take reservations for their bar, it's so popular.The menu is Modern American meets comfort. We started out with the cheddar poppers and to my delight and surprise they were small crispy delights filled with the flavor of cheddar. I was expecting more of a pop over, but these were lighter and more flavorful. The shiitake and oyster mushrooms dish was so incredible. Brown butter and a poached egg make this dish rich, earthy and had me wanting to lick the plate.Potato croquettes with squid ink aioli we're another perfect nibble, just enough to whet your appetite.For mains we ordered the crispy fried chicken and the golden bass. Both were perfectly prepared. The fish was light white fish, with a crispy skin on a bed of smoky eggplant, capers, croutons, and cherry tomato. The chicken was mind blowing. Lightly breaded, it comes on the bone in a bowl with pickled cucumber, rice, siracha and the most delectable soy jus. We were practically fighting over this dish. Unfortunately we were stuffed to the brim and could not try dessert. Next time I'll save room!Highly recommended!",30,25,26

Updated review","I had an amazing experience at Fedora last night.  My wife and I went for our 1 year anniversary and we were treated like royalty.  It was also the spot for our first date.  When I called to make the reservation, I specifically asked for certain things to be prepared in advance and that it was our anniversary.  They did not miss a beat.  Upon greeting, they addressed us by name as did the bar staff and the wait staff - which showed they had done their homework.  The service all night was sublime. We never had to ask for anything.  The space itself is a cozy, downstairs space that is quintessentially West Village.The food was stunning.  We had the pork, the pollock with a side of brussel sprouts.  I hate Brussel sprouts, but these were amazing, amazing and amazing.  They were tender and tossed in cider and bacon.  Bonkers.  I highly recommend Fedora.",2,1,

35,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,7/31/2015,"Note: This was for a small private party that featured some prime dishes from the Fedora menu. While I can comment on the food, my experience may be different, as we were seated downstairs, and not in the main dining area.A friend of mine was celebrating her birthday and she was a big fan of the Happy Cooking restaurants (formerly known as Little Wisco Hospitality), so she picked out a prix fixe menu at Fedora for a party of 8, priced at around $85 per person with wine, tax and gratuity. We got there at around 7:30pm, but ended up having to wait another half hour for them to get ready. Not ideal, and the waitstaff didn't really explain why or apologize, which was a bit curious. As a result, we just sat at the bar for a while until they were able to seat us downstairs. It's usually not a problem if restaurants are a little behind schedule, but communication of issues is key.When we were finally seated, our waitress came out with some bread and wine. The bread was a little lacking, so needless to say, we were hungry and anxious for the food to come out. The visits by our waitress were few and far between, and after waiting another 20 minutes, the food came out in a whirlwind of dishes, served family style. We got the spiced pork rack, albacore, shoestring fries, and Brussels sprouts with bacon. The pork rack was juicy and delicious and came with a few beds of arugula, and the Brussels sprouts were cooked at just the right texture. It was impressive because I know prepping that many dishes at once for large format dinners can be a challenge, and everything was executed very well. The meal ended with a large birthday chocolate tart, which was rich and delicious, and a good way to round out the meal.In all, it was a 3.5 star experience, but bumped up to 4 due to the delicious food. I still say I prefer Joseph Leonard or Bar Sardine for their respective New American menus, but the consistency of food quality across these West Village restaurants is nothing to scoff at. Fedora doesn't lower that standard of quality at all, but I think overall, the service and communication was a bit lacking. At those prices, we expected an impeccable dining experience, but with all of those hiccups, I was a little disappointed, especially because I'm a fan of the chain of Happy Cooking restaurants as well. Nonetheless, I'll have to try the main dining menu one of these days, so hopefully, the experience will be a little better.",11,7,11
36,Leo C.,"Forest Hills, NY",219,304,1491,5.0,6/27/2016,"Cozy little restaurant in west village. Seating and bar area arranged well, never felt cramped like how some west village restaurants can feel. Tried a feel appetizers, easily reccomend them all. Grilled octopus was charred just right and didn't have any chewing gum consistency. Deviled eggs is a lazy ass item to have on menu and incredibly corny to order... totally delicious though, great dichotomy in texture with the crunch and mush. Lobster gazpacho was probably the best if I had to force a pick. Mix the whole dish up on some fried rice steez or something and order 1 for each diner. Dont bother sharing. Even the worst appetizer, egg in a hole, was a success due to the sad bread being served on a bed of tripe. Squid ink fried rice and duck breast were the entrees. Both really delicious and done well, prepared well like any competent chef can. Best part was the duck wasnt served drenched in chutney. What's the thing with venison or duck always served with chutney? Service and cocktails were terrific. Beer selection was horrendous. I know nothing about wine except that I'll drink it.",4,,3

Very low key vibe, smart casual atmosphere. The room is quaint and fills up quickly, I would say reservations are a must. The seating at the bar is ample and the bartenders are great to conversate with. The food is on point! I had the seared scallop starter which was fantastic! My wife had the ricotta gnocchi which were prepared perfectly. The Berkshire pork chop with onions and mustard greens was a great dish.

Try some oysters and steak tartare to start and for the main stage the ricotta gnocchi is surprisingly light and tasty. They also had a great special, an incredibly tender veal schnitzel.

52,Noa B.,"New York, NY",499,209,705,5.0,9/14/2015,"We got here a little bit before 8pm and we were told the wait for two people is about 2 hours so we sat at the bar. We started our dinner off with several drinks and let me start with the fact that I usually do NOT like mixed drinks. However, I really enjoyed every drink I tried here. For the first round we got the Songbird and another cocktail that I asked for to be tequila based, spicy and not sweet. The Songbird was amazing. I would definitely order it next time which is super unusual for me but it was THAT good. I also really enjoyed my drink which is typically what I get at restaurants when I ask for that (kind of like a skinny girl margarita but with better ingredients).The second drink I got was a less-sweet take on a gin gimlet which was really good. It had cloves, nutmeg and a chili in it and had a smokey flavor. I really enjoyed the fact that the bartender cared what we thought about the drinks and kept checking in on us, especially on me, to see if I liked what I ordered. For the appetizers, we got the special which was a salmon belly and another dish which was the arctic char. Both were great but the arctic char was a small portion (maybe even too small for an appetizer) while the salmon belly was really large.. Probably bigger than what most restaurants would serve as a main dish which was fine because we shared both. The salmon was my favorite of the two... It practically melts in your mouth and it has some kind of a cream sauce on the side with carrots. It was definitely the highlight of the meal.Luckily, the dish I got as my main was on the smaller side which was fine because the appetizer was so large. I got he mushrooms which came with a brown butter sauce, bread, and a poached egg. It was super delicious and I would highly recommend it though it is more of an appetizer size.Overall the meal here was excellent and I would definitely come back (and hopefully they still have the salmon belly)",13,3,7
53,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,3.0,1/14/2016,"KenScale: 7.5/10Fedora has long been on my list of restaurants to visit but somehow the right opportunity didn't come about. One of the longer members of Gabriel Stulman's little empire in West Village, the restaurant has been perpetually packed with its speakeasy vibe and active bar area. I've been here once just for drinks while waiting for a table at another restaurant nearby, but not the food with New-American bent. I finally had a chance to come to Fedora for dinner at the bar area; overall, a solid experience but there wasn't a show-stopper that I would remember for a long time.The menu at Fedora is more on the concise side and contains a variety of interesting dishes. Deviled eggs with American caviar were certainly a very good start to the meal (although it is hard to mess up deviled eggs). I was a fan of egg in a hole dish that had tripe ragout and cheddar. It was a decadent dish with richness that I found to be quite pleasant even though tripe is probably not my favorite dish in general. The entrees were a bit more pedestrian. Crisped duck leg that came with escarole, lardons and fingerlings was nicely cooked, but seemed to be missing that wow factor. Hampshire pork chop with Tokyo turnips, spaetzle and honey mustard also had nice balance of flavor, but I felt the meat could've been more tender and juicy. There was nothing wrong with both dishes; it's just that I was looking for something extra that would make each dish more special than a typical duck leg or pork chop dish and New York City has a ton of restaurants that can give a bit more flair to both. Key lime pie was a nice ending to the meal, with delicate sweetness that I enjoyed but again would this be something that makes me come back to this restaurant? I wasn't quite sold yet. The restaurant has that awesome old New York speakeasy vibe that draws a ton of crowd just to get drinks at the busy bar area. Getting a reservation in advance is a must. Fedora is one of the growing list of restaurants in the city that have eliminated tips. I would definitely come back here for drinks, as the restaurant offers a lot of inventive cocktail selections (although my preference has always been Old Fashioned when it comes to cocktails, which the bartender makes quite well too). If you are not inclined to do a full dinner, Fedora is certainly a nice place to visit for drinks after work with some bites to go along with them.",,,

The bartenders and staff are great; friendly, helpful, can easily talk you through the menu. It's a nice cozy neighborhood feeling bar.The drinks menu is a classic hipster smattering of offerings that range through most of the liquor a clear to brown. The bartenders clearly know their stuff, as i overheard one giving a pretty solid run down of how to make your own bitters. Their wines by glass are a respectable showing with a good mix between sweet, light, and heavier dry wines.The food menu is just a hair more exotic than an American gastropub's usual offerings. They have a good selection between meat and seafood. Their appetizers however lean more towards seafood. My pet peeve is that the menu descriptions aren't complete. I ordered the fried chicken (which was expertly fried) but did show up with a giant fried chicken foot in it that was entirely unexpected. It was also swimming in broth. I also ordered the roasted radishes which sounded divine but ended up having an overwhelming odor of fish about them (I think from the flakes on top which weren't mentioned in the description). I'm not a picky eater but I do expect to be able to read a menu and reasonably assume that it lists everything that is a main flavor component or meat offering in that dish. That was a little disappointing to me.I will say though that the meal was well cooked and the staff attentive. And I've read that starting in 2016 they will be eliminating tipping, so that may come as a shock on the bill but is an excellent step in the right direction. All in all, a lovely place for a slightly more adventurous eater and certainly a cozy neighborhood bar.",,,

Neither on both - this is the place. A quiet drink at the bar as seating isn't allowed until all parties (my brother) arrive. Once seated - everything worked to perfection. We started with two appetizers.The Roasted Cauliflower with beans, radishes and walnuts was excellent. However the true standout was a beet salad special loaded with ""everything"". The combination of ingredients resulted in flavors that worked perfectly. A very satisfying starter. The satisfaction continued as we both ordered ""Maple Smoked King Salmon"". Prepared as the chef recommended (rare) with cauliflower pancake, curry cream and almonds the flavors again flowed perfectly complimenting the salmon. Because of kitchen issues there was a bit of a delay in receiving our main courses. We didn't mind as we were catching up on things and still had time before the jazz show around the block. Waiter apologized - the chef then surprised us with a shared order of Brussels Sprouts. Whatever they were sauteed in - it was terrific.Place gets packed and loud.

I didn't mind the fried leg (or claw was it?) with nails still in tact (although some of the girls did mind), but my crispy piece of chicken was sitting in a bowl of gravy, which made it quite soggy and really defeats the purpose of FRIED chicken.

It's easy to find a restaurant where the appetizers are phenomenal but usually the main dishes pale in comparison. However, at Fedora, the entrees, without a doubt, stole the show. Little Wisco does not cease to amaze. If you haven't been here yet, you MUST go. Today! Here's what we had:Blue fish rillette with black truffle (a special) - Blue fish tends to have a bad rep but this appetizer was amazing. So imagine a nice tuna spread but with SO much more elegance and finesse. The fish was so good that the truffle wasn't even necessary but of course, always a welcome addition.Scallop and shrimp - this dish has such distinct, dynamic flavors that danced together beautifully. They were whimsical, bold and refined like a waltz on a mid summer's night. The sweet corn was delicious and a great contrast to the hints of jalapeno. The scallops and shrimp were plump and perfectly cooked. The mushrooms added a nice smokiness. This was one of the most amazing entrees I've had. Eat bite made me sad that there was less on my plate. Yes, it was that good. The portion is small so I suggest ordering apps as well.Maple smoked salmon - The salmon was a beautiful shade of pink and absolutely perfect. It just melts in  your mouth. My favorite part of the dish was the curry sauce. It was really subtle and did not overpower but added the perfect amount of zest that made this very different from your typical salmon dish.    Deviled eggs - I love deviled eggs.

We shared both a chicken dish and a cod dish.Then we had some white wine and we even got champaign in order to celebrate the New Years! They were very festive and friendly. I love going out and truly feeling welcomed and they Made me feel that way.It what you'd call intimate (a politically correct way of saying small) but it was nice.The food was a little pricy but a great place to treat someone or yourself to.

74,Will M.,"Manhattan, NY",24,65,0,5.0,7/1/2015,"Having completed my first year as a New York public school teacher, a celebration was in order. My wife booked us a reservation at Fedora, a spot we'd looked at but never made it to before. We sat at the bar and looked over their whimsically names but extremely meticulously crafted cocktail list. We settled on the Black Squirrel Old Fashioned, which was marvelously smooth and flavorful.With menu perusal done and only the final considerations of what to order left to go, the bartender threw a wrench in the works by mentioning several specials. One was a salmon head, the other a 32 ounce steak for two, which he regretfully informed us was the last of its kind available. With his eager description of these dishes we had no choice but to immediately order them. Preceded of course by a dozen oysters.The oysters were briny and delicious. The salmon head was amazing. The sriracha glaze had the right amount of sweet and hot and the whole thing was cooked to perfection. We left nothing but the bones behind. The steak was a masterpiece of meat. Perfectly seared on the outside while pleasantly rare inside. The steak came atop a bed of duck fat fried rice which was studded throughout with chunks of beef tongue and strips of kale. The whole thing was a marvelous assemblage of flavors that fed us for two additional meals.We ordered the key lime pie and they graciously sent us out an additional dessert, the butternut squash pot du creme. Both were marvelous. The pot du creme was particularly good as it was like a blast of pumpkin pie without having to deal with insufferable relatives.Throughout the service was excellent. We were sitting at the bar so while help was never far away, it was a busy night and even the bartender was hustling to keep everyone happy. At the end one of the owners stopped by to chat and thank us for coming in. Such a marvelous experience, we will definitely be back.",3,,

78,Barr E.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,2.0,5/5/2015,"I had a very disappointing meal at Fedora with my friend last night. We arrived at 9.00 and were told that we were first on the list, but then had to wait 40 minutes until we were given a table. Never mind, these things happen.However, 15 minutes into our meal, just as had received our starter, a troupe of about 40 loud, drunk office-workers who'd clearly just come from a boozy work event charged into the small space, one of them leading the pack and shouting aloud 'told you guys we'd end up at Fedora'.The problem was that the bar, which was already full before these guys arrived, is only about 4 feet from the restaurant tables, so these guys were essentially standing on top of us, shouting so loud we couldn't hear ourselves speak to each other. We spoke to the diners around us who were equally dismayed at having their calm evening ruined by this. Even our waitress complained to us that she could barely get our entrees to us because the whole space was heaving. Giving up on our meal, we decided to finish our food and drink as quickly as possible and leave, and asked to speak to the manager to complain about the noise level and ask for a discount as a gesture acknowledging that we'd now have to find a new place to spend the evening. Instead, the manager had the nerve to tell us off for not knowing that a restaurant with a '19-seater-bar' can get noisy on 4 de Maio, this while she is being jostled by the 60 or so people standing around the bar meant for 19, and even though she could easily have decided to refuse this party entry if she had wanted to. Needless to say, she refused our request for even a symbolic discount. All in all, we left angry and frustrated: not only had we spent $120 on one starter, 2 entrees and 2 drinks that we'd had to consume in 25 minutes to get the hell out of there, the manager made it clear that she didn't care one bit that by deciding to pack the place with 40 drunken loudmouths half-way through our meal she had ruined our night.I would comment on the food but except for saying that the portions were tiny, the experience didn't allow me to appreciate it much.

They provided bread for us to finish up the sauce (much appreciated). Will definitely order the mushrooms again next time.Ended the night with the BEST key lime pie I've ever had. Just the right amount of tart, and a generous amount of crust. When we got the check, there was a vintage NBA player card attached that I was happy to keep.

So just what made this drink concoction so amazing?  Well, I suspect it was the skill of the bartender, Brian (I think that was his name).  He was like an alchemist! He had these small dropper bottles with unique ingredients that he carefully added to each drink to make it delicious.  One of these that I remember was grapefruit-infused bitters.  He didn't use these in my drink, but he used them in a friend's drink that I tasted.  Amazing!  By the way, the drink prices here aren't too exorbitant especially when you consider the high quality of the drinks. Cocktails were somewhere around $13, and draft beer was around $6.I didn't try the food at Fedora but saw some amazing things pass by me as orders were delivered to tables nearby.  Everything looked yummy, and I can't wait to come back and try the food.  I'll definitely update this review when I do.",2,1,2

100,Katherine M.,"Queens Village, NY",104,178,4,5.0,9/25/2014,"Dating a picky eater who is rarely wowed by culinary delights has been challenging. He likes greasy pub food consisting of burgers and chicken strips. I enjoy pan sauces glazing my proteins. I almost always lose the battle when it comes to ""Where are we going to eat?"" Usually, we've been hydrating at some watering hole for a couple of hours. I'm starving. And we go from place to place, glancing at the displayed menus with either one of us shaking our heads and indicating that we move on to the next place.Fedora doesn't have an outside menu displayed. In fact, the only reason we descended the steps was because I peered into the window, saw that they were still serving dinner (on tables with linens), and I spotted some very interesting cocktails being sipped at the packed bar. (Beautiful dinner for me; fully operational bar for him! Win/Win!) Not waiting for the debate, I grabbed my date's hand and declared we were eating there. Menu be damned. This looked like a cozy spot and given the number of patrons jammed in there, it couldn't be that bad, right?Wow! Did we ever luck out! 9pm on a Wednesday night, we were seated right away and given some menus to look over. Had I known how inventive the cocktail list was, I would have saved my liver and my tolerance for Fedora's bartender instead of drowning in watered-down drinks at the dive we had been chilling in for the past couple of hours. We did take our sweet time cruising the menu and didn't feel rushed at all by our very patient waitress. By the time she came back to check on us, we were thoroughly excited to place our dinner orders. BOTH of us. Even the fussy eater! I instantly honed in on the crisped duck breast. Ever since I learned to cook this dish in culinary school, this is my measure of a restaurant's mettle. As wonderful as the other options were, and if it wasn't so late (for me), I would have tried an app, but I had my heart set on that duck breast. When the date exclaimed that my duck sounded good, I secretly sent him mental vibes to PLEASE order something else....You know, so I could taste his dish; an ancient practice any functioning couple engages in! And he went with the maple smoked salmon.The portions that came out were on the petite side when compared to other New York restaurants, but the flavor and richness packed into that portion more than made up for it. I let my date have the first slice of my perfectly medium-rare duck, which I folded over some wheat berries, smeared with a sampling of the pureed squash and dipped into the apple vinegar reduction. His face lit up. ""Oh, my GOD! That's so good!""He went to prepare a perfect forkful of his salmon to share with me, but I couldn't wait to taste this duck! Lord.....It was just....so good! The skin was rendered of most of the fat and crisped to perfection. The meat was still pink and slightly red- juicy and flavorful. While the dish was simple with the sparse components, every bite was perfectly complimented by each ingredient. It was a masterpiece, to put it mildly.When my mouth was finally free to try the salmon, I expected the cliched sweet/tangy flavor profile that often accompanies most salmon dishes. I was surprised to find a complex battle going on there. There is that first hint of smokey right away, followed immediately by the strong, biting flavor of the curry cream sauce. It was rich, moist, and intriguingly complex with flavor profiles I have never tasted together before. And the man who would have been happy ordering a lamb burger at The Slaughtered Lamb was suddenly silent as he devoured his salmon dinner at cozy, little Fedora. The petite little entree I was worried wouldn't be enough was actually the perfect size for both our appetites at that time of night, after having been drinking earlier in the evening. The NEXT TIME we come (Oh, yes! There will be a next time!) I will make sure I am stone sober so I can partake in one of their creative cocktails, start my meal with the crispy pig's head, convince my date to share the shitake & oyster mushrooms with me, and then conspire to get two different entrees again so we can check out what else this brilliant chef has to offer. The only drawback was that we didn't have any room left for dessert. He had a cappuccino. I ordered an espresso. It was a nice way to round out our late meal. When the check came, it was accompanied by a small sampling of their in-house chocolate peanut butter rice crispy treats. Simple, rich, and delicious. If that came complimentary with the check, I can only imagine how scrumptious their desserts are. Again, that's on the list for NEXT TIME!I could go on and on about how fantastic this spot was. The service was impeccable. The food- creative and delicious! And it's cozy in there. I thought it would feel cramped, but we didn't have much trouble moving around if we had to. Restrooms are clean. To put it simply; Fedora excels in every aspect of the perfect restaurant experience!",5,1,3
101,Masumi T.,"New York, NY",100,406,128,5.0,10/29/2012,"From the outside, Fedora looks like it's housed in a brownstone apartment building.  Once you walk in, it opens to a dim, cozy room with a pressed tin ceiling.  I had never heard of the restaurant before stepping foot inside, so I wasn't expecting much.In looking at the menu, however, I thought everything looked interesting.  I love bitters and most of their cocktails contained some type of it and everything on the food menu sounded good.  We finally went with the following:Sweetbreads - Fried crispy on the outside, creamy on inside and served over a mayo based sauce and pickled onions.  Sweetbreads were fried perfectly and paired nicely with the onions but there was too much sauce.Scallops - Again protein cooked perfectly and plated with a flavorful muscle foam, polenta and pepper confit.Brussel Sprouts - Cooked with bacon/panchetta with vinegar and maple syrup.  It was a bit oily and cooked a bit too soft, but the taste was unique and addicting.  The sprouts had a sweet/tangy/fatty flavor that made you come back for more.Simon's Sazerac - I love bitters and most of their cocktails contain it.  This rye based drink contains a twizzler (the candy) bitter with a spray of absinthe and some syrup.  It was very interesting but not quite for me.  I would definitely be willing to try something else next time.While the food and drinks were great, the best part of this restaurant is the service.  The waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and very attentive.  What struck me as different was the servers worked as a team.  If our waitress was busy with a table and the food was ready, someone else would bring it over or take our orders without having her ask for help.This place was good on all different levels and I would definitely come back and recommend to my friends.",3,,1

When I started courting her, I plied her with all sorts of meals in the hope she'd be won over. But from Recette to Yakitori Totto, nothing elicited much more than mild appreciation. When I finally got it through my head that the way to her heart did not pass through her stomach, I despaired. The one arena where I thought I knew how to impress, and this gorgeous girl who I'd been falling for since day #1? Just. Didn't. Care. In fact, she found my fixation on food a little crazy.Fine, a lotta crazy.We got through two years of shared meals that way. Nearly 100 separate times, my dining enjoyment outstripped hers by orders of magnitude. 100 times, my dream to see her pupils dilate from eating faded a little more. By the time we got to Fedora, it was almost dead.Two hours later, she was kissing me in the street.What kind of Jedi mind trick had Fedora pulled?! Cocktails helped, so well-balanced that we excused the overly whimsical names. Our server/bartender's sheer competence was disarming too, menus and glasses smoothly gliding in and out of our hands.The bar he tended was quasi-historic, kept mostly unchanged from the property's previous life as a watering hole gone to seed. Many preservationist bloggers had been outraged, seeing this as a token gesture; to them, remaking the space for hipster appeal smacked of co-opting the past. But what co-opting! The decor was like catnip to my girlfriend, admirer of all things low-lit, wood-floored, tin-ceilinged, B&W-picture-walled.We puzzled over the menu -- ""everything sounds good,"" she said -- until hearing the specials. I can't tell you if her pupils dilated, but mine sure did. We ordered two, salmon belly and beef tongue. I confess to looking daggers at her when she asked for her belly to be done medium, not medium-rare; she reassured me, ""It'll be OK.""""But, but... you eat sushi, so what's the dif...""""Shhh, it'll be alright, love,"" she said, patting me on the hand. I couldn't know that the word ""alright"" would not cross my mind again that night.The salmon belly: Maybe thinking of pork belly, we thought the portion would be the size of a deck of cards. What came, however, was more like four decks. The look on her face was somewhere between desire and terror. After all, this lady had once termed half a grilled cheese, a few fries, and a third of a dessert ""a huge lunch"". For once, I sympathized with the plight of the dainty eater.I was distracted by the arrival of my tongue, another slab of protein plus a small moat of gravy and a fence of wonderfully crisp sweet potato fries. I wanted to check whether I'd need a knife, so I slid my fork through the tongue.I slid my fork THROUGH the tongue.That is, it felt like I wasn't cutting anything, like the fork was just passing through a hologram. This tactile absence was so incongruous that my brain short-circuited. I looked up to my girlfriend, eager to share the discovery.Somehow she'd already eaten two decks' worth. She guiltily whispered: ""It's... so good."" Yes, this is what Fedora reduced my Harvard-educated companion to.Even in retrospect, it's hard to be more cogent. The belly was like... the burnt ends of the ocean. Fatty, pink sea candy, dissolving in the mouth like the body didn't want to bother waiting for it to hit the stomach. There was some citrus note and some herb, but the details were lost on me. Like subtly applied makeup, the real art was in making it seem like added accents weren't even there.The tongue was just as tender as the forking had implied. The deeply flavored gravy actually made me a little mad that they hadn't included a spoon, as I had to lap it up with the fork instead.After those mains, dessert might've slipped into an afterthought. But cheesecake panna cotta with passionfruit caught our attention anew, with the... Agh, you get the idea. I loved the damn food at Fedora. Let the cynics cite Gabe Stulman's mini-empire as sign of runaway gentrification. But acknowledge that, even after the crackling atmosphere, the classy service, the alcohol... what was on the plate spoke for itself. Great is great.Even my girlfriend, so resistant to foodstuff charm, had to admit that. The spring in her step on W 4th Street afterwards -- I'd never seen her find so much joy in being so full. The silver bullet I'd sought had been in the West Village all along. Once I'd imagined telling her, ""Who's crazy NOW?"", but now that the moment was here, I felt only loving warmth for her, and gratitude for the spot of enchantment that a perfect meal can conjure.So, yup, maybe this review is biased. Maybe it's influenced by the fact that, out of those many many meals we've shared, Fedora is one of only two that my girlfriend has ever brought up again later. (The other? John Brown Smokehouse. Hey, she may not Eat, but the girl's got taste.)Maybe you should find out for yourself.Probability of return within 1 year: 99%",39,72,36

The Host was on point, the waitress was very attentive and easy to communicate with. We had a reservation table which is a good idea to do. We started with cocktails. I had the springboard and Wah Wah and my BF had the Untitled and the old fashion, the drinks were everything we love about cocktails fruity, citrusy and bitters to perfection. Don't let the small glass fool you, they are quite potent. I recommend to start with oysters if you are feeling adventurous. For appetizer we had the yummy Tuna Tartare. Then, we had steak for two with duck fried rice which was not on the menu! It was a lot of food for two, but that did not stop us from ordering dessert. We ordered the Vanilla sponge cake with apple coconut and oats. The waitress was so nice! she gave us both a glass of bubbly champaign to go along with the dessert. That made our night most special. Overall,  They treated us like royalty and kept congratulating us on our special occasion. They did not feel ignored us like many other restaurant in west village. We totally recommend this restaurant anytime. Cheers!",,,

Updated review","Well it happen, its over people, they have successfully destroyed whatever leftover culture they once held from the old west village. It just makes me angry because it really didn't have to be that way at all.Fedora now represents everything that is wrong with the la la circus that is currently NYC. Its really a shame too, last year they had a good thing, it was fun, inviting and cozy. Now it's a typical meatpacking style douch bag spot where there are ""reservations"" at the bar and a 20 year old hostess who is ""just doing her job"". It's a fucking tuesday evening there are a few seats at the bar, I walked in, sat down and ordered a drink-- Its a bar right? No longer at Fedora, now you need VIP status just to order a single old fashion.Fedora just do yourself a favor, if you want to keep out your locals just get a meat-head bouncer to work the door and call it a day, any charm you once had has been gobbled up by your own bullshit and underwhelming thoughts of self importance. Im done you will never get another dollar from my pocket.",9,5,3
117,Miki N.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,13,0,1.0,3/8/2016,"Went there a few times, food is ok and drinks are excellent.This time the service was horrible -- went there two people for drinks and a snack. All the tables were free, yet they wouldn't sit us since we said a third person is joining. We wanted to drink until she arrived - they made us stand uncomfortably by the bathroom.",,,
118,Joanie K.,"Brooklyn, NY",164,823,27,4.0,9/15/2014,"come early aka 6:30pm & you'll avoid a wait, even without a reservation. The place filled up pretty quickly around 7pm. We had the burrata. It was delicious and possibly the creamiest I've had in NYC. Sidenote, olive oil w the bread was really good. I had the Maple Smoked Salmon - it was a bit too smoked for me, but had a great consistency .",1,,
119,Dennis J.,"New York, NY",13,773,33,3.0,10/21/2012,"I stopped in with three co-workers on a Wednesday evening, and we split many a dish. To start, we had the a tuna special that was very good, along with cured arctic char (tasty) and crispy sweetbreads (not bad). We also had some oysters, which were tasty as well. For entrees, we split the ricotta gnocchi, krispie fried chicken, flap steak, and scallop confit. I was generally less impressed with the entrees; the gnocchi was merely okay for me, the scallops a bit too overcooked, although I thought the flap steak was prepared well and the fried chicken was pretty good too.For dessert, we split the sugar pie (essentially pecan pie, without the pecan), which was pretty good too. I also had the black squirrel old fashioned (a nice drink, wasn't as stiff as a regular old fashioned) and the cowboy cortado (a bit confusing to me, didn't quite like the pairing of rum and sherry here).The ambiance and service here are quite nice. This is probably really a 3.5 for me, maybe knocked down a bit for the price given the quantity of food. It's a nice, cozy place for a meal and not at all a bad option.",,,
120,J P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,5,1.0,5/3/2015,"We were refused to order a drink because we seemed ""too drunk"" but they didn't mind us sitting there ordering food. To be honest it was a bad judgement call. I live a block away and always go there on the weekdays. Never been there on the weekends so I never knew the bartenders were so judgmental. I'm writing this while I am in Fedora so obviously not drunk enough to yelp. Sorry guys... If you want to be in ""a good hospitality service"" be a better judge of character. There's a difference between ""service industry"" and ""hospitality industry"" learn them.",5,6,2

For example, last night I steak and underneath the steak was an entire mound of duck fat fried rice. Yes, you read that correctly - duck fat fried rice. Bartenders and staff are young, good looking and friendly. The place is always packed from Tuesday on. One issue - if you are having dinner on a busy night speak up as the place gets really noisy. Pretty good wine list. Their cocktails are quite scrumptious.",1,,
122,Lauren S.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,1.0,8/31/2015,"I went there with 2 friends who were locals and we had terrible service.  The hostess asked us to move from the bar to a table (which we hadn't asked for), but we were happy to move as she seemed desperate for our spot.  But, she moved us to a two top and we were 3 so we were squished at our table.  We were in between two other tables and felt like we were on top of them.  When we complained, we thought it would be nice for them to send us an appetizer or a round of drinks and they basically said sorry, but did nothing for us.  We were inconvenienced at their request, then uncomfortable and they didn't seem to care.  Also, $9 for a deviled egg and it was one egg, not a few pieces - just 2.  They have some nerve.",1,,
123,Matt F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,5.0,1/14/2017,"Occasionally you make a reservation with a premonition - an expectation that you are about to have an evening that won't soon fade from your memory. My dinner at Fedora was one of those nights. Only two days removed from our Sunday together, I made a reservation for the following Friday night, giving us something to look forward to at the end of the week. Work absorbed us both, the week passing in a blur. When our reservation rolled around I had hardly spoken to her in the interceding few days. I texted her early in the day to make sure we were still on for dinner. She replied almost instantly: ""Yes, I've been looking forward to it all week."" I snuck out of the office a little early to shower and change for dinner. I worried over what to wear, trying to toe the line between overly casual and clearly out to make an impression. After changing three times, I ended up back in the clothes I had worn to work. I suppose less is more. I arrived a few minutes late. She was waiting for me at the bar. She slid into the booth, while I sat in a chair opposite her. I ordered a black squirrel old fashioned, quite possibly my favorite cocktail in the city. Our conversation, while pleasant, only skimmed the surface of our thoughts. Perhaps we were tired from the work week. Perhaps we were both a little quiet with the expectation of the night ahead. The meal began at a simmer, but over a shared appetizer and two delicious entrees it slowly boiled. After our plates were cleared we ordered cappuccinos, savoring our table and the dimly-lit elegance of the restaurant. We both wore the causeless half-smiles of the truly satisfied. Walking up the stone steps onto the street in the West Village, I hailed her a cab and kissed her good night. As I opened the door for her, she pulled me into the cab and together we made the journey back uptown.",,,

I didn't love the upstairs part though for a cocktail place, at least they didn't stretch the speakeasy aspect. I got worried when we were led through the kitchen and down a dark set of stairs, but the catacombs like cellar was actually perfect. Cooler, quiet, and with private service, it was awesome. They even set up the balloons we had delivered to the restaurant for us. The service was picture perfect, very attentive to the whole party and especially to the birthday guest who they kept checking on. Our water glasses never got more than half empty. They even started making up cocktails for us after we exhausted the menu. The Thai chili vodka drink they made for me after asking for something spicier was super. The food was equally epic. The menu was a set one for the large party, but everything on it was perfection. The asparagus was fresh and crisp, the mushrooms properly squishy with a nice egg base. The Brussels sprouts popped like Scarlet Johannsen's teeth and the frites were fresh and fantastic. The cod was nice and citrussy. The wagyu steak was the best. The meat was sublime and the duck fried rice it came on was seriously so good one of our party went up to the kitchen to ask for more. I'd go back just for the rice. The chocolate tart was a perfect end to the meal. Fedora is an absolutely perfect place for a group event and I'm so glad we chose to go there.",,,

What a breath of fresh air to have food and service and atmosphere and cocktails all melt into a perfectly balanced experience.We booked online via their website, probably a little redundant because when we arrived were we the first sitting, still I friggin love knowing a table is available. You head down the street level stairs under the brownstone, in through tiny parlor doors and into an awesome long-room with bar and leather banquette seating. Super friendly welcome, helpful chill staff settled us in.Cocktails were awesome. They are playing for some hip current ingredients - St Germaine elderflower liqueur, Creme de Violette and sparkling wine made up the 'Songbird' - yum. Also had an awesome Sazerac, with a spiced simple syrup that made it pop. There is humor in this place - the Sazerac came with a red twizzler :)The food was awesome. Highly recommend the deviled eggs with caviar, the carpaccio of duck was amazingly rich and melt in your mouth. Entrees of the pork ribs and pork belly were succulent and the flavor was stunning. We also had the fried chicken that came complete with the chicken leg and claw - too funny.Topped it all off with a Shackleton desert cocktail, which if you are a fan of the hard core antique digestif liquer Fernet Branca, you will be in heaven.Really, a glowing review, one of the nicest spots we have been to in a long while.

Or maybe it was the waitstaff, too self important to notice that the recriminate .666 of our plate was untouched.Whatever the few hits and many misses may be, Fedora swings for the fences, but ultimately strikes out with style.",11,4,3

Had a solid cocktail called I wanna dance with you or something to the like to start. We split a dozen oysters which were also solid and with three homemade sauces that were very nice. I had the maple smoked salmon that was sooo good and cooked perfectly. We split the brussel sprouts that were also good but nothing earth shattering compared to ones you can make at home etc. Feel like they're getting a little old as a side in restaurants at this point. All in all a very solid meal with no complaints. Place was getting pretty packed and loud when we left around 9 but was nice for dinner still and we were able to have good conversation and not have to yell at each other to do so in a small place.

I shared a bunch of things off the menu, but I would recommend the Cream Of Cauliflower soup, which has large chewy chunks of salty bacon and bread in it as little prizes to devour. The name of the Crispy Pig's Head in gribiche sauce almost scared away this admitted food weenie, but I am glad I was talked into it. Looking nothing like a head, these tiny crispy balls were crispy and flavorful.As a main, the special of cote de boeuf for two (and by two they mean seven) came with Brussels sprouts soaked in a delightful wine/balsamic reduction. After eating and eating, it appeared the cote de boeuf might be reproducing, so the rest of it was taken home. Polishing things off with the giant chocolate cake with milk was too much even for this dessert fan. The cake is HUGE!We drank a nice Gruet, Brut Rose ""Champenoise"" 59 from New Mexico, which was not as sweet as you might think and worked particularly well with our earlier courses. Much like a good cv, their compact yet tight wine list hits all the right notes in one page.The Old Fashioned with pecan bitters was a nice little twist on a classic, but was a bit strong for this girl. The odd reservation rules, that is to say, only day of, at the whim of whomever is on duty to answer (or not answer) the phone, could almost scare you away. But once you get there it's more relaxed, with amiable service and smart looking yet non-pretentious fellow diners.

Glaring lighting and overhearing the intimate details of neighboring conversation wasn't exactly what we had in mind for the evening.  On food, we were excited to try Fedora because of the New American take on French, a favorite of ours. Unfortunately, we were a little let down. My favorite thing was the maple smoked salmon. On the other hand, we didn't care for his duck leg entrée. Overall, of the various items we ordered, the food was only okay. Maybe we had skewed expectations or felt weird about the ambiance. Perhaps the experience was a fluke. I'm not sure...

The hostess was very nice and accommodating since we were late for the reservation and seated us anyway. We ordered the goat cheese and beet salad and mackerel and potato salad as starters and both were very nice. As an entree, I personally ordered the scallop dish which I wasn't thrilled about. The consistency of the scallop wasn't great and I didn't like the eggplant relish underneath. It didn't mix well (in my opinion)and there was way too much cumin seasoning in it. I also tasted the fried chicken and sea bass my friends ordered. I found the sea bass delicious and cooked perfectly, but the fried chicken was wayyy too salty and drenched in a mystery sauce. The desserts were really nice though. Prices are reasonable to high. I wouldn't run back.",,,
147,cece b.,"Manhattan, NY",0,24,0,4.0,8/13/2016,Was searching for a place where I could celebrate a birthday with a friend and discovered  Fedora through positive reviews online. Tucked away in the West Village this cozy place is A few steps below street level. Fedora has a very warm and inviting vibe & although  the restaurant is a little on the small side the food was very big on flavor! The host was very friendly and we scored a table almost immediately ! We started with a couple of their signature cocktails I especially loved the songbird and my friend had a delicious cocktail which included rum & and just the right touch of sweetness. Our waiter ...amazing & personable and described  each dish clearly and with lots of personality ;)  we tried the ceviche and mushroom  appetizers they were delicious as were our main courses.  My only regret is that I did not discover this place sooner after living in the city for so many years! I would give it five stars  but the restaurant is just a little bit noisy and since it was a hot summer night I don't think the AC was functioning properly -but those are just very very minor details and did not detract from our very excellent dining experience!,,,

I really expected this place to be just an upscale bar, but it surprised me with a great menu full of delectable sounding cocktails in which I indulged. To top it off, the glassware was top notch and the rocks drinks featured some obnoxiously slow melting ice cubes. Sweet. Very nice bathroom as well, and it's not so teeny that you bang your head against the sink when you're at the toilet like many a West Village loo. In the likely event that wilfie and nell is again so packed they won't let any more dudes in, I'll be sure to take refuge in this swanky little spot conveniently located across the street.",1,1,

Anyhow, Kristin was super nice and accommodating.  She offered what she had available and gave us a 20 to 25 minute wait time.  It pass quickly because she communicated with us on updates effecting wait time.  Shortly after we were seated, we had water and bread and butter brought shortly.  I'm working on body building so I don't eat simple carbs after 5 pm.  My friend said it was good though.  Our glasses of water were consistently filled throughout dinner and a super plus in my book.  We had 2 order of deviled eggs (best i've ever had for deviled eggs!).  The yolk was whipped perfectly with its respective mayo, etc. And was sprinkled with dill, crushed homemade potato chip and what looked like it perhaps was caviar.  We also had the app special that was salmon tartare (fresh salmon with a guacamole spread on top, parsley, crushed potato chips and what looks like very light bit of oil) For entree we had scallops and albacore tuna both of which we were excellent.  Also a side if carrot and tokyo turnip and kale.  The kale was a tad bit salty for me BUT i'm very sensitive to salt so for people who are less picky and sensitive, it would be perfect My friend had a bordeaux i believe which he said tasted well.  And i ended with a peppermint tea.  I wanted dessert but due to some goals, i opted out.  Our wonderful Daphne brought us tiny cookies as a little bit of sweetness since we didn't order dessert.  How nice!Great conversation and really sweet staff!!!",,,

We vowed to come back and then when I was given and unprompted rec from a co-worker we decided to try it out. We went on a Saturday night and sat at the bar. All courses were fantastic.....except the oysters (we got slight food poisoning, but still love this place). We had the Berkshire prosciutto tart, ricotta gnocchi, and roasted duck leg. All were delicious especially the tart! The chicken meatballs on my gnocchi were a little too smoky for my liking, but that's just me!

The piece of cake was HUGE. :)Def a nice place. If there was anything that was a negative was that it is kind of small and the bar got really busy so it was a little annoying sitting down at the table having people right behind you at the bar (like 2 feet away).

I don't really drink cocktails, but I was impressed by the list and sipped Don't Forget the Flowers, and promise I won't forget them! If I ever want a cocktail, this will be my go to, that is if I can resist the Nero D'avola!! After tasting the Chianti and not feeling it, the waitress listened to me and decided I should try the Nero, she was right, not a typical Nero. It was earthy and funky and delicious.We ordered the mushrooms in brown butter sauce ... let me explain it like this:breaking the egg yolks, watching them spill over mushrooms, mixing in with the rich sauce, dipping the fresh bread into that sauce, with a hint of caramel from the browned butter ... heaven ... rich but not heavy.We also had the  smoked mussel toast. Do like smoked food? Mussels? Toast? If so, this need no further explanation, so just order it already!For entree we had the scallops, which were slightly over-cooked, and neither of us are mega red-pepper fans, so this dish fell a little flat for us.Dessert: My date loved the panna cotta (I loved the consistency, but i don't like passion-fruit) and the chocolate cake was just ok, I normally LOVE icing/frosting and this was a little teeth chattering sugary for me. But it really did come with a shot of milk, which was cute.I defintely plan to return, but not for a full meal, for the small plates, the cocktails, the wine, the service and the atmosphere.Note: I don't really eat meat so there is still so much to be explored on the menu!",1,,

They LITERALLY said ""we do not offer shots"" and of course it surprised me and asked the hostess if he could give us neat Don Julio with lime. He rudely said that they do not sell neat nor shots drinks (???). Then I said, ok charge me like a drink and I just want the tequila, he said ""impossible"". I had no option to tell him that I saw two of his bartenders having shots and he said ""well honey, shots are for bartenders but NOT for customers"". I think that is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard in a while. He pretended to convince us that is not a bar meant for drunk teenagers but clearly they are just wrong, we are in our 30's...

It's a very popular place, full of a good mix of ages and people. The bar was crowded, and the restaurant is small so it got loud quickly. The drinks were very good but not the best, but the bar was definitely swamped so maybe they didn't have time to present things as well as they could have. The menu was short, but had great dishes! My sister absolutely loved the short ribs, we enjoyed the roasted cauliflower and asparagus salad- yum! The hake was delicious and went well with their spin on the old fashioned (with maple... lovely). The pork chop was also great. We did have a little hiccup with a mushroom allergy. The waitress was being so conscientious about it, but the kitchen still managed to plate the salad with mushrooms. To be fair, she was very apologetic and didn't charge for that entree even though we didn't mind being charged. The issue was handled well, and the service was good.We really enjoyed our experience here and would absolutely recommend it.",,,

Both the Chanterelles & Shiitake and the gnocci with chicken (honestly, couldn't believe they were chicken they had so much flavor) meatball apts were amazing. The pork chop was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful. The potato pancake was good, but tasted more like a breakfast pancake.

189,Jeffrey O.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,48,3,4.0,1/23/2013,"First off: if you are looking for cheap, keep moving.Okay....the neighborhood is great, entering the place its LOUD, but nice, excellent service and great drinks.For me I wished there was more on the menu, but Im no judge of a menu and made due with the choices I had and was very pleased.So.....if you're looking for a nice dinner in the west Village, give it a try, I did and loved it.",,,
190,S H.,"White Plains, NY",0,6,0,1.0,2/9/2014,"We had a six pm reservation. The hostess told us before sitting that we had to be seated immediately since there was an 8 pm reservation behind us. after the waiter brought us drinks he reminded us we should order because there was an 8 pm reservation. The hostess came over before desert to ask us to order our deserts because they had an 8 pm reservation. Around 8 pm, while still drinking our coffee the hostess can over to tell us that 2 out of the 5 people had already arrived for the 8 pm reservation and we'd have to pay our check. I have never been treated like this in a restaurant before, it was the rudest, most unprofessional behavior I've experienced in New York. For a five person party with a 400 dollar dinner, you'd think we would be treated like customers and not like cattle.Manager did not even offer to compensate any of the bill, just looked mildly apologetic.Was definitely happy to see us finally leave so he could seat his 8 pm reservation.Food was good, people were awful.",1,2,1
191,Foster C.,"Dallas, TX",192,24,0,3.0,2/28/2012,"I actually haven't eaten here, but I have been to Fedora for drinks a few times.  I like the fact that it's close to my apartment, and that because it's a bit tucked away, it keeps out some of the douchier clientele that tend to gravitate towards Wilfie and Nell and Chow Bar or whatever that place is now.  The atmosphere is the popular prohibition style without the pretension of a place like Milk and Honey.  The drinks are pretty good, and the bartenders seem a-ok.  But...there is a....smell that is just awful, and that is why I'm giving Fedora 3 stars.  It's this horrible funk, like you're in your grandmother's closet with mothballs.  I'm not sure why there's a stink, but it has actually turned me right around from entering on numerous occasions.  Also, last time I was there, a guy in a velvet jacket was hitting on me, so that kind of finished it off for me.",1,2,
192,Martin W.,"New York, NY",10,19,1,5.0,7/24/2014,"Fantastic food and great service. My wife is allergic to gluten, and they changed up the ingredients in her dish just for her, and also brought her out a special dessert! Only negative I would say is it gets a bit nosy when the bar fills up.",,,1
193,katy l.,"Manhattan, NY",3,14,2,1.0,5/3/2015,"If I can give negative, I will.  I have always enjoyed this place but tonight honestly makes me wanna ugghhhh on fire!!! My girlfriends were seated at the bar and joking about how drunk we were because.... We joke. Anyway, bartender all of a sudden came to my friend and said that he can't serve her when the rest of us were getting drinks.  We waited to speak to ""manager"", useless one, of course. She claimed ""hospitality, but she was not doing it. Honestly disappointed because my friend and I have been a long time customers. And we are done and will make sure it's done between all of our networks.",3,4,2
194,Vijay S.,"Seattle, WA",39,150,99,3.0,8/31/2014,"Solid cocktails (we had the rum cocktails) - they have a good bartender. The front of the house was very nice and accommodating considering we were running late. The service at our table was great and the waitress's reccos were spot on. Our table got the grilled octopus, bean salad, chicken liver toast, scallops, egg in a hole, key lime pie and cheesecake panne cotta.All of the above dishes were good (nothing to rave about but nothing to complain about either).In all, I would say this is a great place but a tad overpriced for the quality if the food (maybe I'm just an SF native complaining about NY prices here?)",,,

196,Scott L.,"New York, NY",200,442,16,3.0,8/3/2012,"I strolled in for a cocktail and while they were very interestingly described on the menu, the flavors were not amazing, and the size was tiny. This dive scene is overly pretentious, and doesn't seem to deliver on the WOWO cocktails it promises. The food that wafted by my nose looked tiny. I don't see any reason to return.",,,
197,Amy R.,"New York, NY",23,11,0,5.0,1/9/2015,"Fedora is a warm and cozy spot, with impeccable service and inspired, well seasoned food. Earlier this fall my fiance and I moved into the West Village and have regularly frequented Bar Sardine in particular, but also Joseph Leonard when we have been able to squeeze in. On Friday night we tried Fedora, and I cannot express how impressed we were with the experience from beginning to end. I have worked in food and beverage for nearly 15 years and while I am almost always appreciative of dining out, I am rarely as enthusiastic as I was Friday.We were having drinks at Bar Sardine and I quickly walked over to see how long the wait would be for dinner at Fedora. The hostess told us 15-20 minutes for a table, or that we could be seated at the bar immediately. We settled our tab and came right over. We ended up having to wait about 10 minutes to be seated, but the hostess kept us in constant communication as we waited. When we were seated the bartender immediately came over to assist. Throughout the night the bartender was attentive and very genuine. He gave us wonderful recommendations for dinner and wine once we had finished our cocktails. The meal was perfectly paced and the food was FANTASTIC. (We had the hamachi, shitake & oyster mushrooms, the scallops and the fried chicken.) The hostess even came back to check in on us. Although we were regular diners, I felt very looked after while we were there. We can't wait for our next visit!",,,
198,Jay Z.,"Manhattan, NY",146,126,0,5.0,12/1/2011,"Why Come Here? Great spot for any occasion (although large groups would be tough), great cocktails, diverse and interesting menuFedora has the feel an old neighborhood spot. The color scheme is black and white, giving the sense that you've walked into a bar in the 1940s. The speakeasy style cocktails also hanker for a bygone era and even the food is mostly based on traditional American fare, although usually with a modern (and delicious) twist. This makes it a place you can go to for many occasions (casual dinner, date, parents) although it does get crowded on weekends (it's in the West Village after all).I've been here several times and these are my favorite dishes. The menu does change frequently though, so they may not be available when you go.Crisped Duck Leg - The duck is incredibly succulent and delicious. You must try it if it's on the menu.Ricotta Gnocci w/ Smoked Chicken Meatballs  - The gnocchi gets a great flavor from the ricotta. The smokiness of the meatballs is amazing and goes great with the ricotta.Roasted Skirt Steak - A very tender piece of meat, perfectly charred. The herb vinaigrette is subtle, but provides an interesting touch.Warm Madelines - I don't normally like things that are lemony, but the madelines are so soft and fluffy you have to love them. The honey citrus sabayon (Italian custard) dipping sauce adds some weight and complexity.",1,,2
199,Sadie E.,"Pasadena, CA",0,13,0,5.0,12/30/2014,"My boyfriend did his research and took me here for our anniversary. Our server, a blonde woman with glasses, did a beyond-excellent job of recommending dishes and pairing wines/cocktails to our choices. For appetizers, my boyfriend ordered the crispy pig's head and I ordered the mackerel crudo with a carrot-jalapeño butter (highly recommended by our server). Although the mackerel crudo was a special, I would definitely recommend it to anyone if it is still on the menu. My boyfriend likened his appetizer to a ""tender pork crab cake"". Both appetizers were delicious.Next, for entrees, we ordered the crisped duck breast and the potato gnocchi with smoked chicken meatballs (a classic for a reason). Also insanely delicious. Portions were on the smaller side, but filling. Ask for extra bread.We shared the ""cheesecake"" panna cotta and the freshly baked madeleines. Both were a great way to end the meal, but get the freshly baked madeleines. You won't regret it.I honestly don't have a bad thing to say about Fedora. A really lovely place with amazing food and wonderful service.",,,
