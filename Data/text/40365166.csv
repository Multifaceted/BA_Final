Delicious meat, well cooked, good size (the party is thick!).They also have McSorleys beer, which is a plus. Fast service, open 24/7 I believe, near the subway. What else do you need?",,,

2,MARK S.,"Los Angeles, CA",325,5,1,4.0,10/7/2018,"When I think of corner bistro, I have fond memories. I've lived in Manhattan for 7 years and the bistro is part of the experience. The experience now is different than what I remember.I remember coming here and listening to jazz. It reminded me of concerts at the Village Vanguard or Smalls. I didn't give it five stars because last night i came for a burger and heard Mexican music from the kitchen. I love Mexican culture, but in a West village burger bar?Bring back the jazz!",,1,
3,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,4.0,9/16/2018,"We were lucky enough to nab two seats by the front window of the bar to avoid the crowds inside. It's always packed in here, but I've been really curious about their burger for the longest time. We finally made it out here on a Thursday night. I enjoyed the warm interior and atmosphere of this spot, but it's definitely a very popular, very busy one.We both ordered the Bistro Burger with a side of fries to share. The burger comes with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, sliced pickle, and bacon. I really enjoyed this burger. It doesn't skimp on size. The meat patty can be a bit overwhelming. It's a big patty, certainly not what you'd call a smash burger. The bacon was fantastic. Just having a bit of bacon on this burger can go a long way. I was legitimately full afterwards. I mostly came here for the burger, and I wasn't disappointed. It's definitely one of the tastier burgers I've had in the city. It's a solid standard burger, perfect from a bar like this. As for the drinks, they offer a pretty limited menu of beers here. I did I miss my usual craft beers, but they have your standard list of ales. I just went with Goose Island throughout the night.It was really about the burger when coming here, and I'd definitely go back for it. It's a considerably large burger. The beef patty is juicy and tasty. The fries are nice. I like the atomsphere here, but again, be prepared for a congested restaurant. It's a definite recommend for any burger lovers out there. They also have another location out in LIC, which I have yet to try.",5,1,4
4,Sara B.,"Jersey City, NJ",3527,649,4938,4.0,8/21/2018,"I've heard about the Corner Bistro burger for years and am happy that I finally stopped in to try for myself. The bistro burger is definitely worth the hype -- cooked to a meaty and juicy perfection and smothered with cheese and crispy bacon. You won't find toppings like sautéed onions, mushrooms or any sort of fancy cheeses here. This is a traditional backyard burger - lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, cheese and bacon if your feeling crazy. The menu is really small but that's because it doesn't need to have much. If you are eating here you most likely want a burger and fries and that's exactly what you are going to get. There is also a decent selection of beer. I'm taking a star off because service was not the greatest. I understand that this is an old school establishment, and the motto is seems to be 'ya get what ya get' - but burgers are $13.00 and I think the service could stand to be a little bit better. The server basically laughed at me when I asked for an extra plate and a side of ketchup. But, despite the so-so service the burger at Corner Bistro is above average. I'd definitely come back again for more.",17,6,11

9,John C.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,392,199,4.0,6/23/2018,One of the best burger I've had.  Thick buttery patty with a nice char on the outside and perfectly medium rare on the inside.  The bun was soft and slightly chewy.  The lettuce was crunchy fresh.  Beer was priced right at around $6 for the IPA.  Server was impatient and a bit rude but acceptable considering we are in NYC and the burgers are good.,,,
10,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4581,2942,8899,5.0,11/1/2017,"After entirely too much Halloween revelry, I stumbled into Corner Bistro for the first time in a decade. Dressed like Elvis. It seems as though My Wish Came True, and nothing has changed: This is still a bar that serves great burgers. I Love Me Tender burgers, and this one is thick, juicy, and with a great sear. A Big Hunk o' Love, if you will. Cooked a proper medium rare, so I didn't have to Return to Sender.Once our burgers arrived, there was A Little Less Conversation at our table, because you Can't Help Falling In Love with this food. We probably didn't also need to get chili cheese fries (An American Trilogy, if there ever was one), but I'm a U.S. Male (read: fat).If Every Day Was Like Christmas, I'd be here all the time. I Want You, I Need You, I Love You, Corner Bistro burger. Anyway, One Night, you should check Corner Bistro out. But two words of advice: 1. It's cash only.

It seems to have all the original barstools, tables, decor.. its cash only, old black and white photos on the wall.. not much has changed which makes it feel like a classic, spot. The menu is limited, which is usually a good sign. They are known for their burgers, and that's basically all you can get here, and all that you should get here. Since moving to NYC, I have given up my 'no red meat' rule and have started to find the best burger. This is a place to go when looking for the 'best burger'. All in all, it was good, meaty, flavorful, and definitely better than most, but was missing something (juicy, thickness), the bun could be improved too. The fries are incredible. The best part of this bar is that they also serve 'McSorley's' ale, which is a true testament to the authenticity of this establishment.",1,,

14,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,2/27/2018,"KenScale: 8.25/10Everyone has their favorite burger joint in New York City, from Shake Shack to Burger Joint to J.G. Melon. When it comes to burger, my wife Jun and I are fairly easy to please and we need to get a burger fix probably at least once every month or two. One popular joint that has evaded my visit thus far is a modest tavern on the edge of West Village by the name of Corner Bistro. On the President's Day, Jun and I had to stop by in West Village for a little gift shopping, so I figured why not visit the place? It was 2 p.m. when we stepped in, and contrary to our expectations, the place was crowded with a line already formed. After about thirty minutes, we finally got seated, already pretty grumpy about the fact that we had to wait out of all places at a burger joint. Well, after our late lunch at Corner Bistro, Jun and I agree that this place might be one of the best burger joints in the city.The bistro burger at $12.75 per person is certainly a bargain compared to the other gourmet burgers sold at places like Minetta Tavern or Spotted Pig or but a little bit higher in pricing than, say, Shake Shack, especially if you consider that you have to get fries separately at $3.50 per person. Still, the size of the more or less perfectly cooked medium rare patty was on the generous side compared to other joints Jun and I had visited, and Jun especially appreciated the fact that the meat came out appealingly juicy but not being overly greasy, many other places that often resort to such tendency as appeal to the grease-hungry masses in American society. Each bite of meat with a simple combination of onions, cheese, tomato, lettuce and pickles packed inside the buns was quite wonderful, although we really had to work through this enormous stack with care not to make too much mess at the table. The fries were also quite aptly cooked, and served as a nice complement to the burger. As noted above, Corner Bistro is likely to be perpetually packed all day, so try to go during non-peak hours if you want to avoid long lines. There was both draft and bottle beer selections plus the usual alcoholic beverages at the bar; a pint of IPA seems like the way to go here to wash down these beautiful burgers. Corner Bistro is a legitimate burger joint that I probably should've checked out earlier, and Jun and I would be happy to go back next time we have a serious craving for this iconic American dish.",2,1,2

Really quaint, small menu, quick service. I had a bistro burger, which has bacon on it, instead of plain cheese. The bacon was perfectly crispy and so delicious. The burger comes with lettuce, tomato and onion - lots of onion! Absolutely delicious, pretty much everything you could want in a burger. The fries are crispy and hot, and come in the perfect portion for sharing.

Updated review","So several times I stopped to get some French fries to go. Not only they are cooked several times and cost $3.50 but recently I noticed on my receipt additional 18 cents as rounding up. I asked what that was, he couldn't tell me. I asked again next time, turns out they round up to nearest quarter. I mean 18cents round up on $3 fries and nearest quarter was 7cents down so why not be fair and round it down.I think it's insane... if the bill was $50 then 18c wouldn't matter that much but on $3.50 that makes no sense.I am going to look into this how legal is this. Burgers are  great but service is getting worse on daily basis. Server literally told us there is no menu so please stand up and look at the menu on the wall. Place is always busy and I think service people take advantage of it and are just terrible",,3,

When it's late and I'm hungry I want cold beer and a mess of burgers and fries in a dimly lit room with some good tunes: and that's exactly what I found here. This is the quintessential NYC dive bar. The Bistro Burger is perfect. A fat patty dripping of blood and grease with some bacon and melty cheese, soaking through the potato bun and then through the tiny paper plate it's served on. Perfection. Also they have McSorley's Ale on tap, which I've never seen on sight of McSorleys itself, so that was a pleasant surprise. Keep in mind it's Cash only",,,1

27,Phil G.,"Milwaukee, WI",194,10,0,4.0,6/3/2018,"Ahhh, yes, the cash-only West Village staple, Corner Bistro. This review required deep soul searching and honest reflection: Why do I continue to return to a spot that serves a just above average cheeseburger on a styrofoam plate and SKUNKED Budweiser on tap? WHY, I asked myself, did I spend an entire hour there of my precious 12 in NYC the last time I visited??There's just something about this place, man, an indescribable energy that keeps drawing me back. Steeped in tradition, Corner Bistro is the kind of place where you pour yourself onto a bar stool at 2:30 am after 12+ beers to inhale a bistro burger and fries. The words of the late great Colonel Sanders perfectly encapsulate the appeal of Corner Bistro: ""I'm too drunk to taste this chicken."" Overall, it's fuck-you New York City attitude and it's hole-in-the-wall vibes will have me coming back as long as it stands on the corner of W 4th and Jane.

He responded to me saying that's how our fries are to which I responded saying 'I come here every other day that's not how they're like.'To which he responded very rudely and told me that I wasn't paying for them so I should leave. I don't care if the fries were bad one night but the rudeness is unacceptable.

I enjoyed it and Corner Bistro certainly has a place in West Village for a no frills, reasonable price burger. Would recommend if you're willing to look past the service you might get - see below. We had 4 beers and 2 burgers with 2 serving of chips between the two of us - a decent spend. Service was good until it got busy and the manager abruptly said 'you got to go' and kicked us out of the table. We told him we weren't ready and wanted another 2 beers. He didn't care or suggest to us to sit at the bar or stand, which we would've understood. He just wanted us to evict the table without regard for how we felt. The subsequent patrons were similarly shocked - the manager didn't wipe down the table and just asked them to sit.

She knows that the key to a good burger is American cheese. Every single burger place that's known for their burger uses American cheese. She gets it. That cheddar is stupid. That people in art are missing the point. That we know rich people with collecting credibility, that we just need to get drunk with them. Find lonely donors, get them alone, convince them to buy our work at a low price. Five bucks, and act like they paid something crazy. The Corner Bistro gets it, too.

This place is CASH ONLY but there is an ATM in the front. The ATM was down, of course, but there is smoke shop around the corner with an ATM that works just fine. Don't come here looking for fancy silverware. Get the burger (or chicken sandwich/grilled cheese) and some fries and be simple. A great time!",2,1,3
44,Erin R.,"New York, NY",343,126,65,4.0,12/19/2017,This is a great no frills burger joint in an awesome spot.

The burger was very good. Cash only FYI.,,,
45,William K.,"Manhattan, NY",14,42,106,1.0,5/25/2018,Ok. I'm going to be very blunt about this place. Don't waste your time. Ordered a cup of chili. Waited 10 Mins for it before I told the waiter to bring it out before my other food. Chili was watery and BLAND. not even close to JG Melons. The burger was BLAND also. No flavor. I asked the idiot waiter if they put salt and pepper on it and he assured me they did. THEY DIDNT. TO make matters worse there were a ton of weirdos in there dancing by themselves. The bartender kept changing the the songs on in the middle of the song and put on some really weird shit at one point. This was not what I expected from a place that is suppose to be an institution. My advice is go to Melons and art out of this dump. The menu is also garbage.,,1,

Add on cheddar cheese, onions, lettuce, and tomatoes. If you get the bistroburger, there'd also be a slice of bacon. I'd say it's one of the simplest burgers I've ever had. No sauce, no extra add-on. Just letting the ingredients shine, and the patty was VERY juicy.  It was too thick for me that I can't bite into the whole thing so I end up ditching the top half of the bun.

Ambiance, drinks, and the staff were all great. The bistro burger, however was a bit underwhelming.  While it wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't close to the best I've had in NYC.

I turned on my phone flashlight and the burger was completely raw in the middle. Raw as in I could form it into a new patty. I don't like to complain, so I was going to let it go, but my friends who were regulars made me say something. Our  waiter was extremely rude and said I ate half of the burger before I said anything, so it was my fault and he could bring me a new burger, but he'd charge me for another, along with the original.

60,Rachael F.,"Manhattan, NY",93,235,46,4.0,4/14/2017,"This West Village watering hole should absolutely be rated at least 4 stars, if not only for its burger. Sure it's a divey hole-in-the-wall, a rather dimly-lit, somewhat grimy spot with questionable service, plastic plates, and barstools that have seen their share of wear-and-tear. But, IMO that's all part of the experience in an almost-charming way.There's a tiny entrance on the corner of W. 4th that leads into the relatively small space. There are a few tables scattered around the bar and a high-top near the window where we sat. It's extremely laid back - no suits, no ties, no popped collars, and no Diesel jeans. We ordered our food and drinks at the bar and waited for them to be ready. The beers were cheap and refreshing, as they should be at a place like this. The burger came piled HIGH with onions, lettuce, pickles, tomato, cheese, and BACON atop a very thick patty served between two regrettably-un-toasted buns. You'll definitely have to cut this baby in half and ""flatten it out"" a bit, as our server told us.When you bite in, though, I promise you'll be pleased. Mine was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a pink center and juices oozing out of the hefty piece of ground beef. There are no frills here. It's not dry-aged ribeye, it's not a mix of short rib and brisket, it's regular ole' ground beef. But, it's elegant in its simplicity. Actually, it's not elegant. It's just damn good. If you've read my other reviews you know that I would consider selling my yet-to-be-conceived first child for a burger at Emily or Minetta Tavern. Corner Bistro is not exactly on that level. It's a little more along the lines of a PJ Clarke's, I'd say. For the dollar ($10.75), this is certainly one of the better burgers you'll find. Overall, this place is cheap and marked $ appropriately. It's no gourmet experience, and it's no first date spot, but it's a solid 4-star restaurant with cheap, cold beer and cheap, juicy burgers.",3,1,3
61,P S.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,26,118,2.0,5/12/2017,"Not sure what the big deal is about this place.I tried the Bistro Burger.

The bacon was good though It was all served on a very small plate.  It was way to expensive for $12.50.   Then what caught me as oddWas when I got the bill. The added 28 cents to theBill and called it ""rounding"" so the bill totaled $28.00I have never seen that before. It was because the take only cash and don't like to deal with change. WOWThat's new to me. It was ever printed on the bill. Rounding. + .28.  There are way better burgers around here for less than 12.50.",1,1,1
62,Scarlet B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,2.0,9/14/2017,"Corner Bistro was featured on the Food Network's Burgers Brew & Que. It was said that they have the best burgers in NYC, so naturally I had to see for myself. It was also said that you have to try the chili fries, so naturally I did. Nothing was said about the beer menu, and maybe for good reason.The beer selection was meager, so I opted for the Bud on draft, after all, how could you go wrong with that? Wrong. It tasted like the beer taps hadn't been cleaned since the Reagan administration, leaving the Bud tasting like cold cat pee. some may say this is what Bud always tastes like, but I have had plenty of Bud in my life and none as bad as this. I find dirty taps to be common in Irish bars-- not sure if this is an Irish Bar-- but it might as well be. I switched to a bottle of Goose Island for my second beer.The hamburger was pretty good, nothing fancy, just a cheeseburger with two slices of bacon. No complaints and would have no problem recommending the burger. A fine burger.The chili fries left plenty to be desired, hardly the taste sensation they were made out to be on the Food Network. Should have gotten a regular order of fries.Go for the burger and drink your beer out of the bottle and you should be met with a satisfying experience. Just don't expect it to be the best burger you ever had or you will be disappointed.",,,

And the taste of the meat was not exceptional. We waited a very long time for these burgers at a not busy time.

My date and I arrived around 7:30 and were seated immediately, despite how busy the restaurant and bar was. I think we got lucky coming on a Sunday night, as I've heard there's always a wait and they don't take reservations. The simple menu made it easy to us to decide what we wanted. We both went with the Bisto Burger, which has cheese and bacon and two sides of fries. The fries came out piping hot and were definitely fresh from the deep fryer, a testament to how many of these same orders they churn out. After a phenomenal burger at PJ Clarkes a few weeks prior, I was underwhelmed by this burger and fries combo. It was good and the price definitely can't be beat, whether it's in NYC or elsewhere. The food came out really quickly, which helps them turn over tables more regularly. But the burger was just ok, and the bun tasted a bit stale.

Updated review","Perfect aesthetic. From the red neon sign at the iconic West Village street corner, to the simply classic dining room and bar, the bistro doesn't disappoint. A local favorite for decades, and one of the oldest true-blue burger joints in Manhattan, it's a must try for burger and pub lovers alike. The classic burger is as good as they come: a thick, 80/20 patty (best medium rare), crispy bacon, pickles, onions, lettuce, and a no-frills white bun that rightfully puts all your attention on the beef. Corner Bistro is one of the few pubs left in the world that brings you back to the original burger experience. There's nothing new school or modern about it, and that's what makes it so delicious. They've mastered an American classic and I hope they never change their recipe! Have one burger and I guarantee you'll want another!",,,

The pig has had some lipstick applied, but the authenticity still shines through the new coppered facade....

Burger is still great, beer is still ice cold, Tom is still gray and charmingly surly behind the bar, music is still jazzy, yet the bathrooms are now semi-clean....I guess ya can't have everything....

When it comes to burgers sometimes simplicity is key. The meat was juicy, flavorful, and didn't need to be accompanied by toppings to make it great.

But it has its own kind of charm, I guess. We managed to get the last two seats in the place when we popped in for a quick late bite. Ordered two cheeseburgers and a large fries to share. The food took a while...a long while..or maybe we were just really hungry. The burger verdict..yum! This belongs in the messy, greasy burgers category. This is not your gourmet fare with its artisanal what-nots and locally-grown what-have-yous. This is a plain old good no-frills burger from a bar. It's super tasty and filling and hits the spot. One thing to note, the cooking time is crucial to a burger like this. Rare to medium rare and you get a soft, juicy, drippy burger. If you go more cooked than that you're pushing it. If god forbid you go well-done (you heathen!), you might as well just eat cardboard. The meat isn't seasoned much, and you really just need to appreciate the meaty goodness of a rare-cooked burger.Fries are quite mediocre, unless you like them twice-fried and crunchy.

103,Dionne A.,"Manhattan, NY",170,2,0,1.0,7/7/2016,"HARASSED BY A RACIST OLDER MAN ON WED. JULY 6TH 2016I experienced blatant racism right in my face that was so alarming I was rendered speechless.I frequent corner bistro after I get off from my job in the meatpacking district. I'm there at least 3 times a month usually between the hours of 12 and 2 am with my colleagues whom all happen to be non-Black by the way. Last night (Wed. July 6th 2016) I got to Corner Bistro with my male friend with just as much melanin as myself (read:  Dark-skinned Black male and Dark-skinned Black female) at around 12:20 am and we both sat at a table in the corner in the front half of the establishment. Although there were two males beside us that were served after we got there, we were overlooked. Strike 1...So we finally get served, the food is amazing (as usual) and I notice an older man (Ethnic Caucasian) standing in front of our table acting as if he was watching the television above our heads but he was blatantly watching us as we are the most ""amusing"" folks there (Hope you caught that sarcasm)! We were literally just eating and having a pleasant conversation. Strike 2...The lights in the bar/restaurant are immediately turned up enough to be noticeably lighter and mind you, this place doesn't close until 4 am and there are quite a few people still there... I ask my friend if he noticed the lights being turned up and he says ""Yeah - I did!"" The older man comes back to the same spot and is still watching us in about 10 min intervals for a few minutes at a time. After the third appearance from this older guy, I ask my friend, ""Does this older man make you feel uncomfortable bc he is surely making me uncomfortable?"" My friend says, ""I'm not really bothered."" He then waves at the older man and the older man backs away swiftly towards the bar as if my friend was about to attack him and also ignores him when he was just waving at him to get his attention. Strike 3...The older man then begins talking loudly to the Caucasian bartender stating that ""We don't want THEM here, why are THEY here?"" My body temperature is rising very quickly in this moment. My chest is tingling and the sensation takes over my entire body. I am seething mad but I keep my composure. My friends asks if he should take a pic of this bigot to post on social media and I say No. I walk over to the ATM bc my emotional state is like that of a steaming hot kettle whistling on a stove and this old man literally follows me there and then repeats his statement to our Mexican server right in front of me about how ""THEY don't belong here"" then breaks off into a language I cannot place. No More Strikes left...I'm saying this to all of my associates, friends, colleagues, and loved ones because you all need to know whether you are Black, White, Brown, etc... this place does not like to see Black people at their establishment doing exactly what everyone else is doing - drinking, eating and conversing. My money is the same as anyone else's but if you do not patronize this establishment they cannot thrive off of you. They need you to survive and not the other way around.DO NOT PATRONIZE CORNER BISTRO!!!  The owners/patrons are racist underlings that get away with their old world mindsets. #BlackLivesMatter #BlackLivesMatter #BlackLivesMatter #HoweverRacismStillExists",13,1,

It was also extremely loud that it was hard to talk, but I guess what else can you expect.  We were debating whether or not to stay or not, but after finally deciding to wait, one of the waiters found seats for us near the window bench. We both got beers, fires, and bistro burgers. I would say that my burger was good - wished it was a little more rare for medium rare - but nonetheless it was still good. However, the fries were just meh. They weren't hot and tasted like frozen ones you buy at the supermarket. Overall, this place is ok. It was extremely loud and the people who hang out here aren't so nice. Lots of pushing and apparently people's need to find a place to sit overtakes their ability to be polite.

The burger was super simple and delicious. We ordered ours done medium rare and that's the way they came. It's a lot of beef and not a bad price. The burger didn't taste greasy but by the amount of fat that dripped onto the plate, I would say they have a pretty high caloric count. Which is not a complaint but an observation. There is a reason they are juicy and tasty. The fries were not a stand out - more like McDonald's style I would say. Not terrible but not awesome. Full disclosure - since we are from Quebec we are used to thicker double cooked kind of fries and so are often under whelmed by the offerings in NYC.

143,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",410,620,356,4.0,12/18/2014,"Expectations and executions are in harmony here at Corner Bistro.  About the only thing this place's reputation promises you is a delicious, no-frills burger, and the burger this place delivers is in fact delicious, and no-frills.  They will put onions and lettuce and tomato, on this burger, and they will put cheese or bacon, or both, on it.  The price is $7.75-9.75, depending, which maybe feels like too much but not enough to throw off the harmony.You can also get fries, a chicken sandwich, a grilled cheese sandwich, and some very well-priced beers--a pint of McSorleys goes for $3.75, which is pretty tough to beat.  And that is about it.  Some of the seating is cramped--I kept having to scootch around to make way for people.  And I've heard the crowds are sometimes intense, but I came late on a Sunday and it was half empty--we were sat right away and quickly served.  If I'd had to wait and then feel rushed in the middle of a crowd, it probably wouldn't have been worth it.  But as is, things felt in harmony.  Gongs had been sounded and cows had been slaughtered.  Burgers were eaten, and burgers were indeed enjoyed.",1,1,
144,Emma L.,"Norrköping, Sweden",20,4,0,3.0,4/3/2017,The burger was very good (I had cheeseburger) and the fries where very crispy and yummy.

The restaurant was pretty crowded and loud but the tables are small so you sit pretty close to each other. Only major downside is that they had absolutely nothing for my vegetarian friend and where definitely not willing to cooperate and even make a salad. Also it's cash only!,,,

148,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,4.0,8/19/2015,"If you don't like this place, something is wrong with you.  Or else you just might not be from NY.  Thus you don't remember this city as a place that had bars that were actually affordable.  There was more than just fancy mixed drinks with exotic liquors you've never heard of.  The food menus didn't have to be designed by a chef who has appeared on the Food Network.  The bar might not even be clean, but it was homey just the same.  That's the NY I'm from, and it's the same NY that Corner Bistro is from.Corner Bistro is always packed at night.  An old school atmosphere, experienced bartenders/waitstaff and plenty of regulars are 3 big reasons; pricing is yet another.  A McSorley's beer here costs $3.  The rest of the beers here also go for low prices; note I'm not talking happy hour, I'm talking all the time.  This makes Corner Bistro an ideal watering hole for the cash strapped.  The burger here is a basic bar burger brought to its highest expression.  Well seasoned meat, cooked fresh to order, and to the requested doneness (never had an overcooked burger here).  Your burger will be greasy, slathered in American cheese, and on a basic bun.  It will seem out of place in the West Village food scene nowadays, and I for one believe that is a good thing.  It could be the best burger you've had in awhile (was my first time), it may not be the absolute best ever (also true for me), but it is a thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying meal.  Fries are extra ($2.75), but given what the Bistro Burger costs ($9.75) I cannot see anyone ever raising that as an issue.  The grilled cheese is also very good here, but I could never pick it over the burger (blasphemy).If you don't get this place, then good.  Stick to your $20+ burgers with beef flown in from Argentina, topped with ground civet coffee and Cambodian breast milk cheese.  Leave the down to earth places to the down to earth people and take your fancy ass elsewhere.  Being successful in life doesn't mean losing a grip on reality--nor your taste buds.",21,22,17
149,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,3.0,5/9/2014,"Corner Bistro is often mentioned as one of the places offering NYC's best burger. After hearing its accolades time after time, I had to make a visit, of course - and with a good friend in tow, we dropped by after work one evening to see what this West Village bar could offer.Corner Bistro is your traditional dive bar, sporting a tiny entrance on the corner of West 4th Street. It's not particularly large, and both the bar and the scattered tables and seats across the room show plenty of years of history. The two of us grabbed seats at the bar, and were greeted by the bartender, who was friendly enough to go over some of the menu items. The food options are displayed on a small sign next to the kitchen, and the two of us decided to split an order of fries as well as our own hamburgers.The fries came first, a small pile of them on a white plastic plate. To say that they weren't particularly impressive might be too generous, as they pretty much resembled and tasted like McDonald's fries; at $3 for a small handful, they weren't worth the order. They were, at least, steaming hot and still enjoyable with a generous serving of ketchup. The burgers at Corner Bistro are made with a mixture of chuck, sirloin, and top round and are broiled in a modified salamander. We were served a thick patty, accompanied by onions, lettuce, pickles, and a tomato slice. The height of this burger made it rather challenging to bite into, but as per Allison, ""Just flatten it down and eat it"". Initial impressions aside, the patty was definitely a disappointment; the meat was dry and underseasoned and paired with a too-flimsy bum that wasn't able to offer much support, it was a burger that left us puzzled at the many praises it had received.I suppose that for the nights when all you need is some bar food and a drink, Corner Bistro will do. But for the time being, I can say that there are plenty of better burgers to be found in NYC.",10,4,5

The place is a classic and if you live and NYC and haven't eaten here, you're missing out. I understand we have a bunch of burger joints, so how about you eat at one that's still in business in one of the most expensive parts of the city - you can't go wrong.

The patty was flavorful and juicy, but the burger fell apart in my hands too easily which made for very messy eating. I was pretty disappointed with the fries we shared, which were pretty close to what you could get at McDonald's. Price came out to $13 pp with tip.I feel bad for giving such a venerated establishment 3 stars, especially since I really liked the laid back, no nonsense atmosphere.

159,Chris C.,"Edgewater, NJ",11,16,30,5.0,7/17/2016,"Once hailed as the home of NYC's best burger, Corner Bistro typically isn't in that conversation anymore. I was fan back in the day. My doctor's office used to be in the neighborhood so an appointment was a Two Birds thing for me-- a checkup and a stop for one of the city's great cheap lunches. This was my first time back in about eight years. The look hasn't changed at all. It's a well-worn drinking establishment. The warped bar top tells you right away this ain't no Houlihans. There are a bunch of tables crammed into a back room but that's for the burger-and-diet-soda crowd. If you're an adult, squeeze in at the bar and order yourself a McSorleys. Your beer will be served in a real beer mug which seems to be a dying tradition. Then grab yourself a burger and an order of fries. It's a simple menu-- burgers, grilled chicken, chili and fries. Don't ask for a double cheeseburger (this is a proper burger not a measly patty) and go somewhere else if you're  looking for a veggie burger or salad. Then sit back and soak it all in. The burgers are broiled in a kitchen the size of a closet. The two guys working back there never stop moving as this place gets pretty crowded. I was exhausted just watching them work. The crowd is a mix of locals and tourists, blue collar types and ties. But they're all there for the burgers. They're juicy and properly cooked-to-order--if you order medium-rare you'll get medium-rare. My burger today was a notch below what I recalled from years past but still very solid and enjoyable. Maybe they went a little light on the salt and pepper? Perhaps they're using a different butcher? I don't know, but much like Darryl Strawberry later in his career, I don't want to miss out. Corner Bistro may not be the young superstar from years past but there's still an electricity around here. Best of all it's inexpensive. It is still one of the best $20 lunches (tip included) you'll find in these parts. Give it a try. Tell them Looch sent you...but if you run into my doctor, mums the word.",3,2,1

I dug into my $8.75 cheeseburger and expected to be biting into the supposed ""best burger in NYC"".... but was fairly disappointed.  I mean, this burger was not bad.... but definitely not the best burger I've ever had.  The burger did however hold me over... but really, any meal would have.",1,,

Should you want to wait, you gotta wait inside and it's crowded (It was a Saturday night around 10)Don't bring in a big crowd, do 3-4 person max.

A NYC establishment that offers quality at an unbeatable price at any hour of the day (hello, $3.75 beers anyone?!). Their ability to create such a palatable burger in such a simplistic manner is quite impressive. Each topping is carefully layered atop a perfectly cooked patty and stands tall between a sesame seed bun. This is a no frills kinda joint so don't expect to see any sort of crazy topping or patty meat. It boils down to four simple, yet delicious burger options: hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon cheeseburger, and chili burger. Though I can't speak for all of them, I can assure you that the guys over here know how to cook a mean patty.Corner Bistro really goes to show that less is more and that simplicity can be a good thing sometimes.",3,2,2

Updated review","I gave this place another shot, I was excited to try it again because i figured I went on an off day since everyone says they are so good.Well, I was right the first time. It was horrible. The burger is DRY and fell into a million pieces all over my plate, there was no flavor whatsoever and it really is a bad burger. I was starving and still didn't want to finish it.The service here is some of the worst in NYC. They ignore you, take your order as soon as you sit down then disappear. I honestly wouldn't recommend going here.Also everyone says it's so cheap.... I got a burger, fries, and a soda. Ended up coming to over $16. I could go elsewhere, get a bigger, tastier burger, with better toppings, and a beer for that much.I don't understand the hype!",,1,
168,Jonathan L.,"New York, NY",168,118,95,4.0,1/20/2014,"After maneuvering the labyrinth that is the West Village, my brother and I finally found Corner Bistro. Tucked away in quiet section of the neighborhood, it offers you that quintessential burger and beer hangout without any of the inflated prices. A step inside reveals a charming dedication to the slogan ""what's old is new!"" Victorian-era tin tiles on the ceiling and walls, dark woods throughout, beer garden style benches in the back, and an antiquated register up front with typewriter-like buttons? This place screams take me back to yesteryear where I had an awesome handlebar moustache and cheap beer!Fair warning to everyone looking for a new chic burger to consume: this place is not for you. The menu is limited, but brings you the basics of what any person would want in their burger meal. My brother and I both went for the Bistroburger with a side of fries. Within 5 minutes of our order, our food was ready. That's what I call service! The burger, on initial bite, seemed average, BUT when my teeth finally dug their way into the onion at the bottom of the bun, whoa mama! I don't know what the onion did to make the burger go from o.k. to oh heyyy, but it worked! The meat inside is perfectly seasoned and succulent; juices were a-flowin' on my plate and mouth. Fries, as well, were not overly greasy or soggy. The size, while seeming small when presented on plastic plates, is actually perfect to fill you up. The only negative I can say is that we were done with our meal within 20 minutes of getting to our table (it took us longer to find the place) so there is a sense of a rush while dining. Overlooking that, though, the food more thank makes up for the lack of Sex & The City like cosmo-talk time. Is this the classiest place to consume a burger? No, but who cares when it tastes this good?",2,1,1

I like simplicity especially when it's done effectively. In addition, I really had such high expectations after leaving the UWS for what I thought was a place with a good burger especially considering its high reviews from fellow Yelpers. I was unfortunately sorely disappointed. The Bistro Burger, for one, had a large piece of meat in between paper-thin buns that obviously cannot carry a thick slab of meat in addition to not one but three pieces of bacon. Coming from a person who loves generous portions, this says a lot. My complaint stems primarily from the fact that it was almost impossible to eat this burger without having the various ingredients falling all over the place. I literally had to eat them separately. I would have had a better experience if they decided to use normal sized buns instead of slider buns for an 8 oz. burger patty shaped like a golf ball. To top it all off, the waiter kindly overcharged us for tax - that is so not cool.  I guess it's a little expected when you have only one employee working both the tables and the bar...",4,2,

This was definitely not on the top 5 list for best burgers of NYC as everyone claims. My chicken sandwich was 8.75. Yes, cheaper than a lot of places. But it was also cheap in flavors. The buns were thin and were stuck to the big piece of chicken the entire time, threatening to fall apart with every bite. And it did. The meat was dry, and it just tasted like.. chicken, no other surprise elements there. Overall, a very lackluster sandwich. My date had the Bistroburger. He did not enjoy it either. Dry, not enough juice, and had to supplement with pickles for flavors. The fries were nothing to write home about.It is a rare thing, especially in NYC, but Yelp has failed me this time.",,1,

The menu is very simple so it's easy to order, but the biggest bummer is that they didn't have cheese fries. Call me a diva, but I didn't think it would be THAT hard to make cheese fries so we begged our waiter to put in an order for chili cheese fries. I'm pretty sure they just took square slices of cheese and cut it up and threw it on top with chili. If you're in the area and need a quick place to stop by for a burger, then this is a solid choice.

185,David B.,"Berkeley Heights, NJ",59,406,270,4.0,7/10/2014,Is it the best burger ever? No. But it's pretty damn good. Always cooked properly with crisp bacon and good fries.  Cheap beer. I'll take it!The wife and I really miss Mookie the cat that used to curl up at our feet while we ate.We really like it here. You will too.,,1,
186,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",62,322,18,4.0,8/9/2015,"This place feels like one of the rare old school places left in the city, and we liked that vibe. Beer prices range from $3.25 to 3.75 for drafts - an almost unheard of price these days.  (Granted, the beer glasses aren't pint glasses, but it still comes out to a decent value.)The burgers were the reason for coming and they did not disappoint. The beef patties are cooked to order (mine was slightly overcooked but within the realm of medium rare) and flavorful. I got the bistro burger which is a cheeseburger topped bacon. Very nice flavor, especially with the tomato, onions and pickle.  The price is right at $9.75, too. The fries were thinly sliced and reminded me a lot of McDonald's fries (in a good way).  Is it the best burger in the city? Of course not. But for the price it's definitely one of the better choices around. FYI - it is cash only. Kind of annoying, but keeping with the old school vibe, I suppose.",1,,
187,Deoroop M.,"Brooklyn, NY",186,220,317,2.0,11/12/2013,"It's truly disgusting when such a fine, reputable glorified institution of alcohol has terrible and lackadaisical service.Walked in here on a Friday night with a co-worker for a friend's birthday soiree and it was very early, so we decided to get table to gorge on their infamous burgers. Another friend was shortly meeting us here as well, so we asked for a table of three although only two of us were present. It was fairly packed and the line for tables was exponentially growing, practically halfway into the bar area. The host would not seat us until everyone was here and was hesitant about getting us a table, so we ended up forcibly badgering him for a table for two. STRIKE ONE.Once seated, I nearly got up roughly three times to go to the bar because the server/host didn't really care if we wanted a drink or not. Ten minutes passed by and our other guest had not arrived. We were pressured into ordering by the waiter and I decided to get the grilled chicken burger and an order of fries. STRIKE TWO.  The food arrived fairly quickly but was awfully reminiscent of McDonald's. In fact, it even tasted like a step up from the fast food chain. The fries were pretty greasy but not doused in sodium. The grilled chicken patty was fairly small and decent but topped with a gigantic sesame seed bun. The meal was cheap but it really wasn't all that. Once our food was finished, our friend finally arrived. We ordered another round of beers and the server kindly asked us to relocate to another table because a lot of people were waiting in line for a seat. O.oSTRIKE THREE. I forget how is that really my problem?!After much deliberation and confused looks, he left us right where we were and we just ordered another 12 beers. Final verdict 2.5 stars. Only due to the fact the bartender was really amiable and provided us with delicious light/dark Mc Sorley's for a whopping $3. With that price you really can't go wrong, unfortunately nothing else here was really worth it.",2,1,3
188,James G.,"Manhattan, NY",155,97,55,5.0,4/8/2016,Please kill yourself if you did not give this place 4 or 5 stars. The burgers are great. Prices are amazing. I just hope the hipsters try and kill it.,,,

190,Jade O.,"New York, NY",40,40,2,3.0,10/12/2015,"I'll keep this short.Known for their pub burgers.  Meat seriously lacked seasoning.  Had to send a medium-rare burger back because it was cooked through (no pink whatsoever).  Perhaps there was a burger switch up, because cooking a thick pub burger through takes some serious time.  Even when received the right burger, meat still lacked flavor.  Add some salt, yo!Also, fries were cold.Waiter was super nice.  I dig the ambiance - divey bar, good people watching.",,,

With all due respect to places like Umami Burger and any other variety of $19 burger spots... but Corner Bistro is the kind of eatery that make NYC special. **Perfect may be the wrong term... Nobody should slam a bacon burger then go right to bed. Maybe give yourself a couple of hours to digest...",21,19,16

Updated review","A regular burger with a soft doughy bun, a rather thick meat patty, and iceberg lettuce, tomato slice, and a few pickle chips. The meat patty doesn't taste seasoned, just meaty. The pickle is soft, not crunchy.",2,,
193,Cecilia D.,"West Los Angeles, CA",504,628,905,5.0,8/23/2013,"Not a bistro at all. It's a totally AWESOME dive bar in Chelsea where the burgers are cheesy, the drinks are ice cold, and the patrons, loud. We adored this place. And it was a welcome respite after the interesting but confusing experience that was Sleep No More. They only have a few things on the menu. But what they have is excellent! Burgers, chicken sandwiches, and fries, OH MY!Nary a dry patty or wilted lettuce in sight. The service is spot-on and the music is classic rock. Happy to have found it!!",5,4,4
194,Jeffrey T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",306,258,109,5.0,9/1/2013,"Marshall (HIMYM) was overreacting about Corner Bistro not being the burger joint! It's gotta be! With the red neon sign and green door. I mean, I thought I went to burger heaven!! As a first timer, I am impressed by the burger! My brother did a good job by not overrating the burger for me. I mean I went in thinking that it's not as good as people say but maybe he has eaten better burgers elsewhere. The Bistro Burger and Fries came out $12.50 and it was worth every penny. Slapped Shake Shack right across the face. The two doesn't even compare!First off, medium rare just how I like ANY meat. They actually cooked the patty medium rare perfectly (that bright pink in the middle)! Wow! And second, to order take out and still enjoy the taste was impressive. Third, that had to be one of the best burgers I've ever had (Definitely made it on the top 5). Every ingredient just melted in my mouth. The patty had a large quantity of meat but in a way, you really paid what you get for ($8). That crispy bacon to go with the burger made life taste even better. Anything with bacon is good though. Gourmet burger at its finest!",3,3,2
195,Mike C.,"New York, NY",5,1,2,5.0,1/4/2016,"I ate this. It was a mouthful but every single bite tasted like heaven. The McSorely's house draft ale is cold, crisp and $3.50. Jazz plays as foreigners line up in the back. Get here early to avoid the wait. Order the bistroburger with the works, it will be delicious.",,,
196,Maria E.,"Denver, CO",809,1585,254,4.0,9/5/2013,"Came here with my bf when we first started dating. We were all over each other and really gross - probably ruining many of your dining experiences. I apologize. We were already drunk and went here on a whim. Good decision. Burger hit the spot. I know everything tastes better when you're sloshed but despite my inebriation, I was  able to see that this was indeed an excellent burger.Open til 4am - awesome late night spot. I no longer eat meat so I can't give the burger another go. If they add a veggie burger to the menu, I'd be all over that though [hint hint CB]",1,5,2
197,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",1547,761,1732,4.0,6/22/2012,"With so many burger joints to choose from in the city I had to go to a old classic. Took the time to walk over from work while hankering for a burger. Walking in i'm reminded of the old mid-town times square classic McHale's Pub and their classic burger.Best seat in the place i'd say is at the bar. 2 TV's to watch and McSorley's poured right there in front of you. Bartender and service was great. Go for the Bistro Burger, a bacon cheeseburger, cooked to perfection and a side of no frills fries. Washed it down with a McSorley's and it brought back memories of McHales just not as big and monstrous as their burger. I miss the old spot but Corner Bistro sure takes me back.Mid-day lunch crowd you'll find with your mixture of tourists in town who read about Corner Bistro in their guide books but come nights and weekends it can get quite boisterous in the bar. I'll stick to the lunch time crowd and my bar stool for my hour lunch while savoring my burger.",,,
198,Shawn N.,"Vancouver, WA",28,5,0,4.0,7/2/2017,"Delicious Bistro Burger. No nonsense, quick, good price. Would come back. Waiter didn't say much until I asked his recommendation for a rooftop bar. Very helpful, even got his bartender's recommendation and wrote it down for us.",,,
199,Ted C.,"Chicago, IL",389,1691,1757,2.0,11/24/2013,"Hey kids! If you use HIMYM as a guidebook to New York you'll probably end up here because it's basically where Marshall got the 'best burger in New York' and was even mentioned in that episode. My friend was on a burger hunt and I took him here. We showed up, got shown to the back where tables were so close together that I basically shoved my ass into some German tourist's face. The service here is pretty...well it's not that good. The 'menu' was a board with hamburger, cheeseburger, bistro burger and the chili burger. I had no idea what the bistro burger was and so my friend asked our server what it was just as he was about to turn back because we didn't decide right away. A 'bistro burger' is just a bacon cheeseburger, by the way. We got fries as well which were just okay.The burger was thick, but small and honestly, nothing to be excited for. They serve McSorley's beer here but they've got a decent burger with house mustard for around the same price, if not cheaper. Definitely not the 'best' and there are better places around for a burger either basic or fancied up.",,1,3
