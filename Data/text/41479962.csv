Their chocolates are smooth, clean, not too sweet, and have a beautiful finish. Their Champagne Truffles are lovely. You can taste the champagne cognac but it's not overwhelming. The outer shell is coated with cocoa powder. The center is made with creamy dark chocolate. Their Macarons are delicious as well. Lightly crisp outer cookie and cakey within. The chocolate filling is cool and creamy. High quality chocolate is used and you can taste the difference. Yes, you will spend a mini fortune here, but these chocolates are definitely worth trying.",11,4,10
1,George H.,"Bethel, CT",113,426,2841,1.0,4/14/2018,"I am not happy with the quality of the service here. The hot chocolate served was barely even like warm! What a horror! I almost had the urge to send it back to ask them to heat it up again, but I was afraid that the server might spit into my cup and contaminate it. I see that other people have complained about that as well, I wish the owners /managers would take note and make the appropriate changes. I wanted to like this place as I love the macarons at the La Maison in Geneva and in Paris, but this one here is sad and poor, and nothing resembling the class of those establishments. Just the name! What a shame, and what a farce!!! Ugh~! An utter disappointment and a highly discouraging one! Buy the macrons to go, but skip the hot chocolate! It's a trauma inducing nightmare not a treat!",1,,

5,Jennifer L.,"Manhattan, NY",408,75,40,4.0,5/13/2018,Great place to hangout for some chocolate. I passed by the place after doing some shopping and thought it would be a great time for hot chocolate since it was so dreary outside. I made the right choice. Had a great hot chocolate. The flavors were intense and I loved it though I prefer mine a bit thicker. Their Travita cake was delicious! Great service and would definitely come back to grou ti the eclairs.,,,
6,Erin M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",158,37,0,5.0,8/24/2018,This is probably the best chocolate that I have ever eaten. The truffles are heaven and the service is very pleasant!

You will never have more delicious chocolate!,1,1,1

I personally recommend pistacio and raspberry pralines, in which the flavor of nuts or fruit perfectly merge with a smooth taste of dark chocolate.For pastry, try their famous eclair. If you love dark chocolate, their cake is also a good choice.",1,1,1

My favorite is the original milk chocolate. I've tried dark chocolate (great if you prefer semi-sweet) and banana milk chocolate. Banana milk chocolate wasn't great tbh and was much thicker textured and not as refreshing as I thought it would be. Service is a little slow, so don't come here if you're in a hurry, but it's a good date spot and also for meeting up with friends. I recommend the milk chocolate and their rose ice cream too!",1,1,1

Even the raspberry and lemon chocolates which I would not normally like were so subtle and fantastic.Definitely recommend a box of chocolates as a gift.",6,4,6

The product itself is excellent quality, though pricey - you're worth it.I stopped for a treat and was disappointed to see that they were pretty low on stock - no pate de fruits at all, only small bags of almonds, etc.   They have a small tea room (aka 2-3 tables and a sofa) toward the rear of the store if you're interested in a pastry or coffee. I was, and it was quite an interesting experience.I ordered the ""degustation"" which promised me a cup of hot chocolate, a slice of cake and a macaron ($17). The server apparently has never had anyone order anything from the menu before as he seemed quote perplexed - first, I was offered coffee and had to point out that it came with hot chocolate (thick and delicious BTW). The included cake was described as a ""moist chocolate loaf cake"" but arrived dry and crumbly - very disappointing. I picked caramel for my macaron (because they were out of several of the flavors including raspberry and pistachio) but received a coffee one instead.Overall - subpar stocking and a friendly, but clueless staff.",,,1

When I go in to pick up an order, it's hard not to feel sorry for the staff at this fancy UES chocolatier.Few people who shop here seem to be able to grasp the concept that yes, even they must wait their turn in line occasionally, as they jockey for position at the counter, only to harumph their way back out onto Madison avenue, when they're unable to exercise their privilege.Go here for a high quality sweet, see how the other half lives, and treat the human beings gently. ;)",2,3,2

The macaron had a chocolate center (somehow I thought it'd be vanilla) inside a vanilla shell. It wasn't too sweet. Very distinct flavors and great texture. One of the best macarons I've had. The eclair was heavy and filled with not too sweet chocolate mousse (everything is chocolate so by now I'd realized my vanilla- loving self needed to deal). It was pretty dreamy. I don't like my desserts too sweet so both were great. Only downside was price.. But I understand why!! Service was great, too. I'd come back to try the candied fruit and another pastry.",1,,
20,S A.,"New York, NY",6,113,78,1.0,3/7/2016,"No one greeted me as I entered the empty store at 6p.I looked around and enjoyed the smell. I inquired about a hot chocolate as the reviews said it was a must! I was told to go to the cafe in the back which was also empty. I asked the server to give me his favourite! I was then instructed to return to the front of the house to pay. $10 for less than 8oz of a beverage by Starbucks standard is highway robbery! Even Jacque Torres doesn't charge you the full arm-heck I think he just lops off your hand at the wrist!I received my beverage the hot cocoa de Caracas and left.No one offered me a sample of anything. I was just invisible. So as I walked out of the store and onto the darkening Madison ave, I sipped my hot cocoa expecting to be lulled into a sea of this  luscious dark chocolate elixir and feel it course through my body.I stopped in my tracks as the first sip went horribly wrong.It was barely warm! The drink was nowhere near hot, more like tepid. I popped the lid thinking maybe there was some whipped cream that cooled it down. Nope, no whip cream. Just a cup of dark room temperature chocolate water.It was not creamy. It was not overly sweet or bitter, it was just a huge let down. $10 bucks for a sip of heaven as most reviewers have deemed it is atrocious. Save your time and money. Keep walking. Don't stop for the ambiance or the hot cocoa. Go elsewhere! Heck max brenner's is a gazillion times better down on union square.",1,2,

24,Mona W.,"Santa Clara, CA",1384,1268,9746,5.0,4/24/2012,I have been a loyal follower of La Maison Du Chocolat for a long time. The smoothness of their dark chocolate and the intensity of the flavors are unforgettable. I have only started exploring their macarons recently even though I have heard about them for years.  Their macarons are chocolate centric (and rightfully so). They use only chocolate fillings and nothing else. No jam no buttercream just pure chocolate ganache with various hints of flavors. Those who like varieties might find them a bit dull but chocolate lovers would rejoice. The texture is nice enough although still does not compare to Laduree's. These confections are good companions with red wine just like their dark chocolates.,5,1,1
25,Ixamar P.,"Miami, FL",373,45,95,5.0,1/15/2017,No words. Simply delicious and the service is impeccable. You must try both the Caracas and Guayaquil hot chocolate. I couldn't decide which one was better!,,,

However, I did enjoy it.The macaron (I believe I had a mocha one) was very, very underwhelming. It was soft on the outside and pretty much the same texture all around-- not at all crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside like a real macaron is supposed to be. It was also cold, as though they had just retrieved it from the freezer and defrosted it.Overall, I don't think the experience matched up quite well with the prices.",,,
34,William L.,"Chicago, IL",154,162,220,5.0,1/9/2013,"As someone who dreams in chocolate ( as well as works with it), La Masion is a must see on any outing in NYC.  The day we passed it they were closed (The 1st of January), so a couple of days later we were nearby by and searched them out (and aren't we glad we did).This is not your typical chocolatier.  Full of posh, style, and flavor, these chocolates seriously reflect the true art of chocolate.  From milk to dark, they have it all.  And do not be put off of the prices (which average about $115/lb) because the service is well worth it!  Always smiling, helpful, and ever so clever wit, these guys know what they are talking about and will get you onboard rather quickly.We picked out a range of 8 different pieces, sharing each and it was a true delight!  I know that they have other locations in the city but I think that they guys here certainly make the trip to the upper east side worth it.  As we visited several chocolatiers this was probably our favorite!So, if planning a trip to NYC, make sure to create a chocolate budget and stick to it (unless you come here)!  Happy New Year!",1,2,1
35,Kate O.,"Alexandria, VA",28,489,88,4.0,7/9/2014,"I have a first world problem and this place is making it worst. I am grateful for a platform like Yelp where I can whine about my first world problems.I live near Washington, DC and my favorite chocolate shop closed down. There is another store that sells the same brand, but it is a pain to get to and they close early. This makes it more difficult for me to get to because I have to work to afford my expensive chocolate habit. Hershey's doesn't do it for me anymore.Since I was visiting NYC, I figure that the city would offer a better chocolate shops selection than DC. I did a Yelp search and found a good amount near my hotel. On our last day of the trip, I told my husband that I must go buy chocolate before I leave. Tired from walking all day the previous day, my husband decided to stop in at the first chocolate shop he saw, which was this one. Expensive? Heck yeah! But it was so so good! It was not too sweet and it was rich enough to savor a piece at a time so I can stretch out my chocolate supply. I bought a box of assortment for a whopping $$$, but I'm hoping that it would last though Christmas. Before this, I was fine with eating chocolate that would cost around $$, but after this, I hope I can still go back.On a side note, it was a hot day when I purchased the chocolate, but they put in a couple of ice pack in the bag to keep the chocolate from melting. The chocolate was in great shape when I got home about 8 hours after I bought the chocolate.",6,2,2
36,Lily C.,"Los Angeles, CA",253,362,330,3.0,11/23/2012,"La Maison Du Chocolat is PERFECT for die-hard chocolate lovers, who have a bit of cash to drop on expensive chocolate things. I'd heard a lot about their macarons and hot chocolate, but I am [unfortunately] not such a huge fan of chocolate. Which basically means you should ignore my review if you are!I was wandering by a while back in shorts and a tshirt and thought I'd drop in and pick up a few macarons. I felt REALLY outclassed since the feel of the store is like an upscale jewelry sales counter. Despite that, the staff were very friendly and helpful. I ended up just getting a box of assorted macarons for $16.50. At $2.75 each, that's really pricey especially compared to Bouchon. Most of the cost I imagine is from shipping, since they supposedly ship their macarons all the way over from Paris. I really question the freshness of macarons that have been shipped from overseas, even though probably doesn't take more than a day. Did I think it was worth it? Well... as a non-chocolate lover, I have to say no. I prefer a filling that ""matches"" the outside macaron shell. All of the macarons here had variations of chocolate ganache in them and were fairly small for a ""mini"" size. 3 stars because I don't think it's worth the price, but is an interesting experience and a must-try for chocolate lovers!",2,,

The waitress told us they were sold out of one type of hot chocolate; okay, we ordered two of the same type. After a few minutes she comes back with our sweets and says they we completely out of hot chocolate and that she was really sorry. She was nice about it and even brought extra chocolates for us but I wish they hadn't seated us and served us food without telling us we wouldn't have access to their specialty, which is why we came in.

I ended up getting the caramel macaron and the chocolate one. They are really delicious and just the perfect. The meringue was nice and firm on the outside, but deliciously moist on the inside. I've had too many that were just crumb like. They also had some really delicious chocolates - I ended up getting the passion fruit filled one and the salted caramel. Both well worth the wait at the store. Definitely next time it's worth getting more macarons when I visit again.",3,2,2

41,Amy D.,"Manhattan, NY",8,72,2,5.0,5/28/2014,"This chocolate is FANCY. Well, I haven't had any of the chocolate yet, but these macarons? They are FANCY. They make you feel so classy when you are eating them.I had three macarons from here today...I confess, I didn't wait until I got them home, but instead ate them as I walked down the street, like a true addict. This may have been what sealed my fate, because....yes, I promptly turned around and got some more. They were that good. They were so good I couldn't believe it...I'm pretty sure I stopped dead on the street and stood there without moving for a full twenty seconds. I also just blew almost my entire paycheck on macarons. Was it worth it? Oh yes.A note about these macarons: they all incorporate chocolate in a major way, and a rich, chocolatey ganache (not buttercream!) is a strong presence in every single one of them. For a chocoholic like me, this was no problem, but if you prefer your macarons light and ethereal and tasting only of the ~essence~ of cassis or rose or something, you may want to steer clear of these. From best to worst (not that any of these were bad):Hazelnut - my favorite. A creamy hazelnut taste blended with a chocolate ganache, to create a gianduja-like filling. The meringue shells were hazelnutty and light.Venezuelan dark chocolate - rich intense ganache and the loveliest cacao crumbs on top to lend a crunch. Amazing.Coffee - Very strong coffee taste, not overpowered by chocolate.Caramel - rich caramel, probably the least chocolatey of all these macaronsLemon - my least favorite, I'm not a huge fan of the combo of lemon + chocolate; however, others may disagree.These macarons differ from others I have had (from Laduree, Michel Cluizel, Macaron Parlour, most notably) in that the fillings are a lot thicker and creamier, and the shells very light. This draws one's attention to the chocolatey fillings. So if you're more about the crunchy shells, go to some other place. Meanwhile, I will be here, happily buying out the store's entire stock. I will probably end up homeless, but at least I'll have some incredible macarons to savor.",2,3,2

They have many selections in the $11 and $30 range. After that, things get a bit pricey. Make your way through the display cases to the cafe in the rear. I came for the hot chocolate. Excellent. It was the perfect cup of hot chocolate. Not cloyingly sweet, not bitter, just right. It's got a lovely light mouth feel. Add the accompanying whipped cream for added richness. I also ordered the large Rigoletto macaron. So light and balanced. Just a little sweeter than the hot chocolate. Teensy bit of salt to accentuate the caramel. The whole thing melted in my mouth like a dream. The presentation is top notch. The whipped cream comes in a little crock on the side with... they weren't nibs, but they were chocolate and added to the whole experience. I even got a small piece of milk chocolate to take home with me. Someone ordered the eclair and made me regret my choice for just a moment. But not for long. The macaron was really, really good.

I was waiting on line at my favorite standby - Laduree for my Saturday macaron fix when the hubby called me and said, don't wait on line lets go to La Maison du Chocolat and try their macarons. I was somewhat reluctant to give up my spot on line, I had about another 45 minutes to go before being served but relented and met him in front of La Maison du Chocolat.Fast forward to tonight, after a delicious dinner prepared by the hubby and some really good red wine, we started on our 12 pack of macarons. To our chagrin we realized that we would have to share each macaron as there was only one of each flavor. All and all it was a good experience. They got the cookie part right, it wasn't crumbly and dry. It was very moist and tender (the hubby likes the word tender) like a Laduree macaron but the fillings weren't as good. They were mostly mixed with chocolate which overpowered the flavor of the macaron. I get this La Maison Du Chocolate but they overdid a good thing with the macarons.That being said they were very good, much better than what you get at the local French bakery or Zabar's/Eli's. If you don't want to wait on line at Laduree, this is a decent alternative.",4,2,1
48,Meg A.,"Westchester County, NY",58,228,556,5.0,8/2/2013,"I've been coming to LMDC for years but never got around to reviewing it. This is a special occasion place. This is an ""I'm in the doghouse big time"" place, an ""I'm depressed and need good chocolate"" place, an ""I just feel like blowing $100 in five minutes"" place. It's all worth it. A friend of mine suggested that I try the chocolate frappe from here so I ducked in with my dad to pick up some chocolates, macarons and a drink for each of us. There are three options for the frappes - chocolate sorbet, chocolate ice cream and coffee ice cream. I opted for chocolate sorbet thinking it would be less fat (please don't tell me I'm wrong) and it was honestly the best frozen chocolate drink I've ever had. Perfect pick me up although maybe too much sugar for dad who needed a sandwich afterwards. The biggest reason I come to LMDC is for that little case in the front with all of the bouchees. The Jolika is my absolute favorite as I'm a marzipan nut, no pun intended. I grabbed a few others as well, a milk chocolate mendiant, a praline, a nougat, a florentine ""cookie"" bottomed in chocolate and some macarons, as well as my favorite orangettes from anywhere. They are truly the best, hands down, best orange and best chocolate. The macarons are not my absolute favorite but rank pretty high up there. I don't like to compare them to others because I think they are their own creature since every single one is filled with chocolate. However the texture is pleasant and the flavors are all there as promised. I also grabbed a large Salvador macaron for the little one which was devoured in about thirty seconds. Of the small size macarons, the vanilla was definitely my favorite which I know is an odd choice, but I think it's the perfect balance of a strong vanilla with an amazing ganache. The truffles are amazing, however I didn't purchase any on this trip. I remember being given a sample of a basil ganache filled truffle about five years ago and how amazing it was. Now if that doesn't speak to the quality of the truffles that I can remember exactly what I had five years later, then I don't know what will. For all of this I paid a pretty penny but this is not your ordinary chocolate shop. This is where you go to buy chocolates for those you love or when you want an honestly amazing chocolate fix. These are not to be bought for novices, this is an experience. Oh and get a frappe please. It's perfect for the summer.",7,7,6

A very sweet woman sensed my indecisiveness and offered me a rather ample sized ""sample"" of a coffee macaroon, which was absolutely delicious. It had a supple cookie texture with a smooth rich chocolate in the middle. It was not an abrasive coffee taste, but more of a hint of it. After swooning over the display of chocolates, I decided to just go for a cappuccino. After all, that macaroon appeased my desire for chocolate that afternoon. I was promptly served a delicate cup of cappuccino, sugar cubes in their own cup, along with a complimentary chocolate. The cappuccino was subpar. The chocolate was simply delectable! Just sweet enough. Rich in taste! An indescribable purity. This was no Godiva. It compensated for the cappuccino.I glared over at another couple enjoying hot chocolate and regretted my decision.

On a humid, torrid early evening when the thick air seemed to press on my lungs and my head, I decided to splurge on the frappe. Oh, chocolate bliss  in a frozen creamy slush. The chocolate ice cream used in the frappe is so intense and refined you know you are imbibing the GOOD STUFF. Pricey at $9.50 and worth every penny if you are feeling flush. Go for the intense, dark chocolate and not the lighter, less sweet version. I had the Caracas. Who wants to count calories anyway with chocolate this good. The frappe is not super sweet anyway(the Jacque Torres frozen hot chocolate is sweeter). The Mayans called chocolate food for the goods. Whether you eat or drink chocolate this special, you will agree. The frappe and chocolate get 5 stars. The upper stratosphere of the prices drop La Maison one star ;). Treat yourself anyway if you can.I read some Yelper reviews about unfriendly, snotty service and did not experience it when I came.

They have a new chocolate called Extreme that is just a simple dark chocolate (I'd say its around 70%) but its absolutely amazing and you get 2 for 1!I also tried the passion fruit chocolate which has a passion fruit center that was pretty good.

I have not yet shopped for chocolate here, but I stopped in the Cafe for a snack and had the hot chocolate (Caracas, the incredibly dark variant as opposed to the other which I believe is sweeter) and a macaron.Beyond the greatness of the chocolate, the service here is top-notch as you'd expect. I forget the name of my server, but he was an older man and was both very professional and friendly. I originally ordered a coffee macaron, but it turns out that they did not have this available - he was very apologetic and suggested a caramel one instead.I'm glad they couldn't fulfill my original order because my caramel macaron (the $5 macaron ordered is very large, about 2-3x the size of a typical macaron) was absolutely delicious. And the Caracas hot chocolate was everything I had expected. I've recently become a bit of a hot chocolate ""snob"" but this is my new gold standard. The only negative - $13 for a macaron and hot chocolate (I paid $18 including tax and tip).

I would rather go to Sanctuary T for their hot chocolate -- far more delicious, cheaper, and larger portions. If you're the type of person who appreciates really thick hot chocolate, then you can't go wrong here. As I said, the chocolate for the hot chocolate was really wonderful. I just wished they thinned it with milk for me.I also had a little macaron (raspberry with a dark chocolate raspberry ganache -- $2.50 for the small one, yes, it's very expensive as a larger one could be had at Madeleine Pastisserie for the same price). Here is the thing about macarons -- if the shell is crispy that means the macaron isn't fresh. A fresh macaron has a lovely soft shell. La Maison du Chocolate served me a crispy shelled macaron.

87,Jay F.,"Portland, ME",165,598,143,2.0,5/27/2010,"Yes, chocolate.. Parisian chocolate.. I suppose both the name and the location of this expensive little shop in an especially tony area of the Upper East Side is what draws many to its doors and likely accounts for most of the glowing reviews. That's the only reason I can come up with for the high rating because when it comes to chocolate, it simply isn't impressive at all.La Maison du Chocolat makes no secret of their chocolates and French macaroons being imported from France, so that should be the first hint the fare here isn't going to be the freshest thing you've tasted.While the chocolates are indeed good, they aren't even a taste bud better than those from such pedestrian stores as Godiva. As a matter of fact, the iconic Connecticut chocolatiere Munson's is light years superior.Since I'm somewhat of a French macaroon connoisseur, I was anxious to try La Maison's version. Offerings come both in small and large with the small macaroons coming in at $2.50 each, not bad compared to the prices of other macaroon makers in Manhattan.  They were a bit stale, possibly due to the shelf life and travel time. The chocolate, raspberry and caramel were all tasty but again, nowhere near the quality, beauty and taste of those from many other French bakers in Manhattan.If you're in the area and in need of a bite of chocolate, La Maison du Chocolat isn't a bad choice; just not the best, by a French mile.",,,

While they are the gold standard in chocolates, LMDC also has some of the best large macarons in the city. A noteworthy trivia is that these are the only macarons selling in NYC (outside the odd high end restaurant) that are made in and flown over from Paris. So, should you help them with their shipping costs and pay the $5 for a large macaron? Yes, absolutely! While not the best macarons in Paris (Pierre Herme, Laduree or Jean Paul Hevin) these are some of the best available in NYC in terms of both texture, and filling. They also have the largest diameter. The shell is crisp but doesn't crumble, and while the cookie is just a ""tad"" chewy (as opposed to dissolve in the mouth), the amount and flavor of the filling really compensates for the difference in texture interpretation.  As I've spelled out in other reviews, macarons in NYC generally have inadequate filling, barely the size of a thin quarter, but the ones at LMDC have both good quantity and flavor. The Caramel, Coffee and Vanilla macarons are the best of these flavors in NYC, and the caramel will guaranteed make you swoon! The Chocolate and Lemon flavors are also excellent, but have competition for ""Best in Class"".After many, many comparisons to the location at Rockefeller Center, I prefer the Madison Avenue outlet to source my macarons. I also prefer to wait an hour or so after purchase before eating (same issue of refrigeration as at Fauchon).Those who want to have their cake and eat it too --- indulge in the macaron addiction without going broke - do indeed have an option: moonlighting. I learnt from the staff that as they are shipped from France, a lot of breakage is inevitable. Given the emphasis on visual presentation, none of the dented or damaged macarons are made available for sale to the public. Instead they are polished off by the staff. So, lots n lots of free macarons available, the day of the shipment. A fact that also explained his wide grin and cheerful nature!Update (3/31): LMDC has a new collection of macarons filled with five flavors of chocolates: 1) The Quito Macaron is pure chocolate with a dark, robust ganache; 2) The Guayaquil Macaron has an ivory shell with the dark chocolate ganache accentuating the subtle vanilla; 3) The Romeo Macaron is Arabica coffee (from Kenya) with a milk chocolate ganache; 4) The Salvador Macaron is a fantastic dark ganache with fresh raspberry; 5) The Rigoletto Macaron has a milk chocolate ganache to complement the lightly salted caramel.

Being a chocolate fanatic and an annoying tourist, I couldn't help but stop and take pictures. Then I went in. I randomly picked out some chocolates truffles and I popped one into my mouth. As the chocolate melted in my mouth, I thought I was going to melt into the floor from bliss. The chocolate was smooth and complex. Although small, each piece packed a powerful punch of flavor.

Clouds hovering over the sky on a chilly April afternoon, I strolled down Madison with my sister and laid my eyes on this sophisticated boutique of chocolate delicacy. I thought I was in a jewelry store when I stepped into this wonderland. My heart melted as I starred at numerous glass cases with Parisian chocolate displayed in elegance. It was couple of days before Easter--Chocolate dipped real egg shells filled with chocolate ganche, miniature chocolate eggs with caramel filling were wrapped in colorful foil, everything in the store was just so delightful. I walked out of the store with a box of 6 macorons. With its pretty pastel arrangements, lightly crisp exterior and smooth filling, these little desserts made me a very happy girl.

With my jeans possessing a remarkable tendency to gather the snow in its folds, I needed a respite in a dry and welcoming haven - a setting in which a friend and I could indulge in sweet treats and seek refuge from the inclement weather. I knew of La Maison Du Chocolat's existence, as an uncle had sung its praise a couple of years ago and so I thought that this was as good an opportunity as any to indulge in a decadent cup of hot chocolate and, perhaps, a few macarons to pass the time.The front area of the shop houses the chocolate and it is what one would expect from a high-end chocolatier - a boutique store with glass cabinets filled with gorgeous looking specimens. If only I had infinite resources. In any event, the cafe is at the back of the store, where we were swiftly seated upon arrival.With regards to the ambiance of the cafe area, I found that it was rather dated and dirty for a store renowned for its sophistication and superior product on the Upper East Side. In any event, we were there to eat, drink and be merry and so I was certainly willing to look beyond the substandard decor.We ordered hot chocolate (~ $8 per cup) and five macarons of various flavors. Whilst the hot chocolate was rich and delicious, it was not particularly noteworthy for the price and I can't say that I would make a trip specially for said item. Unfortunately, the macarons were wholly unexceptional and the flavors were undifferentiated - a sea of the same variation on a vanilla theme before us, thus making me wish we had ventured over to Laduree.  Conclusion: The bill came to $40 for two people for hot chocolate and five macarons, which is highway robbery if you ask me. For the price, one would expect something special but, instead, we were confronted with something wholly lackluster in its execution. I have no doubt that the chocolate at the store is incredible, but the cafe area should be an extension of that excellence and, I'm afraid, that at this point it is not.",,,

They specialize in ganaches and pralines ( but have truffles too) and have around 35 different varieties of candies....all soooo good can't pick a favorite.They have macarons as well. Sometimes they're fresh and sometimes they're not, hit and miss but if you ask they're honest about it.It's very clean, minimalist and serious inside...this is no chocolate funhouse...more like a Salon de the a la Paris.

The chocolates are so... I'm trying to find the word, really, pure... or complete, or deep. They have so much purpose in them. You never eat one and think, ""this came into being as an accident""; it just feels so thorough to eat their chocolate. It's expensive, and so is shopping on Madison, but, that's life unfortunately. I wouldn't do it every day, but it's a taste that's worth the experience. Good? Yes, good... but it doesn't really capture it... worthwhile... interesting.

They aren't big, they are more about the combination of flavor and texture and proportion than just being giant and yummy...

I have nothing but high praise for the dark chocolate and coffee. Not so much for the milk chocolate. Which I found a bit in the tart and sour side. This isn't so much a strike against them as it is a note on my taste.

Updated review","I just remembered an incident that took place here many months ago that I need to address. I frequent this location as I live a few blocks away and it's always been pleasurable. On one occasion as I had sat down to enjoy a cup of hot chocolate as well as several desserts, the older Asian woman(possibly the manager? She looks of Filipino descent) obnoxiously yelled and ordered an employee about in such a conspicuous and degrading manner that it made me and other patrons around very uncomfortable. She should not have displayed such snobby unprofessionalism along with an air of pretentious authority toward the other employee, the waitress ( who seemed to be new), especially not in front of customers who are trying to relax and enjoy themselves. Poor girl...she did not deserve to be embarrassed like that. The situation was very uncomfortable and low-class and I had asked for the check without finishing my order. I did, however, leave the waitress a huge tip. She was a very nice girl and was doing the best she could.",2,,
136,Alice C.,"San Mateo, CA",20,64,7,5.0,8/1/2007,"Thanks Atif!  I was incredibly giddy as I walked up to the store.  The second I got inside, I think I had a smile from ear to ear.  I scanned the entire store.  There were quite a few elder ladies also shopping in the store so I thought I'd get shafted on service.  Boy was I wrong.  I was immediately approached and asked what I wanted.  I told her one of each of course.  Perhaps my very dilated pupils or the cappuccino jitters gave me away. She must have thought I looked like an addict.She immediately gave me a description booklet for the various flavors that they had.  She also showed me their special for the summer.  Of course I knew I wanted one of each of the macaroons. I also checked to see if she would give me an ice pack because I'd be out and about all day.  Ice packs were $1 each, and they also sold insulated bags for $6 each.  So as promised, I attempted to buy the store.  So far LMDC has convinced me to go to Paris where I can eat wonderful macaroons everyday.  The truffles were splendid.  Champagne Cognac tasted exactly as it sounded in smooth creamy dark chocolate.    I won't break into the rest of the chocolates till I get back to California.I also noticed that they have chocolate/ tea tasting menus. I would call ahead to schedule that next time I come to NYC.I carried it with me the entire day.  Through the museums, where the security guards eyed me with envy and tried to confiscate my bag of goodies.  And to Avenue Q where the lady there tried to take it away as well.

It was ... well, over the top! It was hot. It was bitter. It was grainy. I probably would've preferred something smoother normally, but I was OK with the over-the-top version at that moment.

149,Carey Y.,"Sarasota, FL",397,338,3,5.0,6/2/2011,"What an absolute honor to be invited to an industry-only tasting event at the finest chocolate shop in New York. I was warmly greeted by Haley-the-hostess who presented me with my press kit detailing the delectable chocolates I was about to enjoy. I was led into the back room to find a dozen other food writers schmoozing around small tables of the sweets I was about to indulge in. I found Horacio, the gentleman who invited me and profusely thanked him for allowing me in on such a special event. I honesty felt privileged to be there and was treated like a V.I.P the whole time.I was then given an extensive tour of the desserts on each table, and had plenty of one-on-one time to learn about the specifics and ask my many questions. I took my photographs during this tour so that I'd be able to taste everything afterwards without the distraction of my camera.I started with the Salvador Raspberry Mousse Cake. As beautiful to the eyes and it was in my mouth. The slight crunch of the raspberries in the filling contrasted wonderfully with the smooth, creamy mousse. The ganache on top glistened and melted in my mouth. The overall flavor was incredibly rich, but somehow light and airy as well. A perfect first course.Next, I moved on to try the BEST macaron I've ever had in my life. Not to be confused with coconut macaroons, macarons are a French pastry, more like a crisp meringue cookie made of egg whites and almonds and filled with various delicious creams. This one was the Macaron Sylvia: made of a shell with cocoa, and filled with luscious milk chocolate ganache, notes of biscuits and honey.  The flavor and texture was unbelievable and it turned out to be my favorite treat of the day.Ready to move from the pastries on to the 'hard stuff', I sipped on a glass of cold water to cleanse my taste buds before the next adventure. The collection of chocolate is the new summer offering from Maison, and they are each little pieces of art with tastes as exquisite as their designs. The first was Etzia, a creamy milk chocolate ganache with a hint of 2 honeys, one which was floral and the other which was from chestnuts. What a unique flavor this combination was, I thought about having a second piece, but alas there was still so much more to save room for. I moved on to the Txokolate Iluna (what a lovely name) which was a dark chocolate with a hint of smokiness. Next was the praline macaron which was smooth with almonds and the slightly crisp bits of macaron inside. I loved the texture of this one, and thought it was quite different than the smoothness of the others. My favorite piece was the Almond paste with Patxaran. A mouthwatering dark chocolate with almond paste inside. Totally and completely delicious. This is the one that I will most likely return for, a crave-able flavor for sure. Last was the Espeletako Piperra, a dark chocolate with two different kinds of pepper. I found the pepper to be extremely subtle, and had to wait for it in the aftertaste as it was not immediately noticeable. The chili pepper pattern on top was a delightful touch.I thought it was really charming that the next step, as my host explained, was the palette cleanser: a quintet of ice creams and sorbets to finish the day. They were presented in icy shot glasses, each with their own little perfectly fitting lid. Having been in to try the fantastic chocolate sorbet on a prior occasion, I decided to start with the caramel ice cream. Creamy, smooth, rich and complex, this flavor is perfect on it's own- no need to follow the trend of adding salt like so many restaurants are hip on doing these days. The pistachio was outstanding and I must add it to my list of favorite foods. No fake, chemically green color here, oh no. This pistachio ice cream has way too much class and integrity for shenanigans like that. Both the strawberry and raspberry sorbets are light, refreshing, and truly did work as a perfect end to a delightfully rich afternoon. It's very hard to find anything less than perfect about this 'meal' although I did find the fruit sorbets slightly too sweet for my own preferences. Then again, maybe that was just because I was in complete state of sugar overload at that point and anything aside from water might have been one step too far.As I said my goodbyes, I was handed a gift bag and was thrilled to find a couple of truffles and two more the best macarons ever inside. Oh, I am a lucky girl indeed. All in all, La Maison is a treasure indeed and I am incredibly flattered that my blog allowed me to take part in this event. My hobby has come full circle at this point, turning something that I do for fun into a truly valuable passion. I think the famous saying can now be changed to ""Do what you love and the chocolate will follow.""  To me, chocolate of this caliber is worth far more than it's weight in gold.",,,

151,IrvineHousewife I.,"Irvine, CA",73,373,2,5.0,11/12/2009,"My cousin who works a lot in New York promised me a box of chocolate from La Maison du Chocolat. It finally arrived overnight  by Fedex. I was so excited, I felt like a little girl on Xmas day opening Santa's present. It was a 14 oz. box with dimensions of about 7"" x 4"", a lot smaller than I expected for $75. I was a bit disappointed with their presentation. The chocolates were packed like canned sardines with no individual 'slots'  in three layers, separated by a thin plastic sheet. The chocolates were very small, about 1/3 the size of a Godiva, and 1/5 the size of See's. The chocolate tastes very, very smooth, at first bite, it did not feel very rich, but after a minute or so, somehow the richness starts in my tummy. It's hard to describe, but it's very satisfying. After three pieces, I felt like some warm water, yep, it was that rich. The ganache melted on my tongue slowly, releasing the flavor of the chocolate. The dark/milk chocolate coating was 'sealed' to the ganache seamlessly, which is often not the case in other chocolates. For the past few nights, all I can think of during dinnertime was the dessert that's waiting for me. I can see why La Maison du Chocolat is so popular with chocolate lovers. Besides their unique creations, they make the classics so much more superior than their peers. After this, I don't know how can I go back to my regular sugar fix. Few of my favorites:Zagora: fresh mint infusion flavored ganache (not your junior mints, tastes like there's a mint leaf in there somewhere)Orangettes: Orange peels crystallized and covered with dark chocolate (puts Godiva's version to shame. The orange peels tasted so fresh like little droplets of crystals)Rocher Noir: praline coated with almonds and nuts in dark chocolate (kids fave)Mont Blanc: Kirsch flavored mousse (strong enough liquor but not overpowering)Cannelle: ganache infused with cinnamon sticks (ingenious)",3,3,4

163,ChristinA S.,"New York, NY",42,47,16,5.0,8/29/2009,"I can't even BEGIN to talk about how much I love chocolate. I eat them whenever I can. Whether I am sad, or joyful, chocolate has always been there for me, every step of the way. That being said, I would only eat La Maison Du Chocola's chocolat or Vosges' chocolat if I can get away with it. Why? Not because I'm a snobby, picky eater, although some might think that I am*, it's because once you bite into these rich and creamy chocolats, there is no going back. The regular chocolat that I buy in grocery stores would never live up to that standard. Snickers? Hershey's? NEVER. I would rather splurge a little more on chocolat than buying those cheap ones. My fav. one has got to be garrigue. It's a truffle with fennel-flavored into it. Oh, just thinking about it makes me wanna run to the store and grab a bunch. First, you are hit with that special chocolat aromas only the best qualities can achieve, and after you bite into it, you feel that silkiness of the chocolat linger in your tongue. You chew it, slowly, savoring every hint of the chocolat flavor, and feeling all of your troubles going away. Ladies, this is better than owning your own Christian Louboutin shoes, this is better than having your very own balenciaga bag (although that would be nice), this is simply heaven.",1,1,1
164,Matthias J.,"Carlisle, MA",2,173,6,5.0,6/13/2011,"Having tasted premium chocolates from L. A. Burdick, Teuscher, Chuao Chocolatiers and although at some point you'd assume premium chocolate can only get so good, I have to say: La Maison is the best I have had so far.  Their store on 5th Ave has a rather pretentious feeling to it.  There were four salespeople (all in dark suits) in the tiny 10x20' store, some of them speaking French among themselves (and it wasn't Haitian).  Their chocolates are irrationally expensive, but if your thing is not single malt scotch or Cuban cigars but chocolates, this is a place you can occasionally indulge.",1,1,1

167,Michael W.,"New York, NY",14,209,6,5.0,1/8/2009,"Okay, I love dark chocolate better than milk, and I've been to Amsterdam (next store to Belgium) and gotten fresh chocolate in shops made with Belgium chocolate shipped in.  Well this store approximates the epitomy of the best chocolate in NYC.   I kid you not, when you taste a chocolate you can taste all the delicate layers it was put together with, and you experience a chocolate nirvana as you slowly bite down into a soft sweet construction of true bliss.   Check out their website, and you can have it delivered too anywhere, as they are globally located.   Having tried many of the designer chocolates sold throughout the world, and even enjoyed the hand made ones in bloomingdale's own chocolate shop,  this company and their shops are easily at the TOP.. a cut above all else.Trust me, and try these!!!  They have tons of flavors, types, and bars of chocolate to please all.lamaisonduchocolat.com/e…",2,,1
168,Kate M.,"New York, NY",31,327,1,3.0,5/6/2009,"Got four flavors of their macarons today (raspbery, caramel, chocolate, and vanilla) and thought they weren't that great. Weren't crazy about their flavors or texture, though the caramel one was delicious. They were a little stale, even! Madeleine's are so much better. My husband did like dark-chocolate-covered pistachio-marzipan I got him (and kept at room temperature as they instruct.) They were generous with samples though, tried three truffles even without asking for it, every one of them was delicious. Maybe their chocolates are better than their macarons? Unfortunately I haven't been craving truffles at all so maybe I'll give them another chance when that craving hits, which is due pretty soon. Anyway, it's worth a try but I wasn't crazy about it.",1,,1

I've also ordered online from the company on many occasions and my shipments have arrived on time and in perfect condition. The chocolates themselves are exquisite both in taste and appearance.
