0,sherry x.,"Cupertino, CA",6,94,0.0,4.0,10/15/2018,"Had the lunch set menu, really good value I have to say, the food tastes good but not exceptional. I had tuna tartar, the sauce is a bit too strong so I have a hard time taste the fish and the avocado. The steam bass is again ok, I'm actually really enjoy the vege (spinach) on the bed, super tasty and refresh . The warm chocolate cake is the best among the 3 . What really throw me off is the service : seriously? No water refill, no ask for coffee , even my side order comes really later and I have to ask for it . And they even suggest a 22% tip . For what??? Again for the price the food quality well deserve a4 star. The service perhaps is barely a 3 star. The wine list is also super weird: it's extremely expensive range from $20-$40 for a glass of red ...",1,,
1,kaaaathy c.,"College Point, NY",400,35,222,4.0,10/3/2018,"Lobster burger with fries: the lobster was very juicy and fresh. The fries were really good; crispy on the outside but soft on the side. Oddly, I liked the fries better than the burger. Overall, very interesting.28 day dry aged ribeye for two: ordered in medium rare, it was really good. Didn't need sauce because the steak already had a lot of flavor by itself. Came with crispy potatoes and creamed spinach on the side.Had reservations at 6pm and got seated right away. Atmosphere was really good with just the right amount of noise. The staff was very polite. I wished they seated us at a bigger table since the table was very crowd with all the food/plates, but it was manageable. The only biggest con I have for this place is that it took an hour wait for the food to come out. They could have at least given us a small complimentary something for the wait but the server just told us ""8 more mins"" when it was actually half an hour more. I'm not sure what took so long but if I ever decide to return I'll be looking out for the wait time.",,,
2,Jo A.,"Phoenix, AZ",83,202,49,2.0,9/25/2018,"I don't get it. Had my second visit to Nougatine this past weekend I'm still not impressed with this over hyped restaurant.Let's start with our reservation was for 7:30. We didn't get sat till 8:40. And that was only after we had to go ask how much longer. No one checked on us, updated us. Nothing. So much for stellar service.Then we get seated at this small corner table right next to the server station and get possibly the dullest server ever. Not sure if she was new, having a off day. But she was not on her game at all and looked bored to be there.The manager threw us two appetizers for the long wait. Which to be honest I think it was to stall us since our meals weren't ready. The appetizers were the best part of the whole meal. The duck was over cooked and the flavor was off. My boyfriends veal was dry as a bone, our friends Dover sole was $78!!! And was not much better than something you could get at outback. Overall it wasn't worth the wait or the price. I had a better meal at Kingside and Wayfarer by our hotel.",,,
3,Bethany M.,"Seattle, WA",4,81,12,4.0,11/18/2018,"Lovely breakfast with a splendid view of Central Park.  They tune up the classics, to delicious effect (standouts: the Eggs Benedict with Russ & Daughters smoked salmon, French toast with creme anglaise/caramel/Granny Smith apples, the Paris ham, and oh that coffee!).  It's enough to make you temporarily overlook the building where the restaurant is situated...",,,
4,Hana S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",395,583,191,4.0,6/11/2018,"I brought my parents here as a thank you dinner. Didn't realize it was in the Trump Tower before making the reservation (oy). From the moment you walk in, the service is SO on top of it and so nice that it made us almost uncomfortable but definitely top notch service here.Highlights were the foie gras brulee, roasted hake and burrata. The roasted hake's curry sauce added flavor to the butter-y fish, the foie gras brulee and burratta were both sweet but savory with such great textures. Every flavor was pleasantly fused together. The dessert was also amazing, we loved the delicate taste of both the carrot cake and chocolate cake. But neither had anything super special about them (still yummy though)",2,,1
5,Vivienne K.,"Honolulu, HI",24,187,890,5.0,5/17/2018,"As sweet and historically significant as the nougat, yet as affordable as tin - a beautiful harmony that defines the very essence of Nougatine, one of my favorite brunch spots in New York, and certainly ranking higher in order above it's sister, Jean Georges, in my heart and mind. Why?In juxtaposition with the more stuffy and pretentious sister restaurant, Nougatine is the perfect balance of comfort and luxury, with no less exceptional service.  Nougatine greets you with that sense of sipping-afternoon tea-by-a-garden like tranquil comfort yet with just enough glamour to mark a special occasion that is difficult to master. The food is inventive and fun; the service is remarkable (the waiter did not once question or push us to order more though we had ordered less than a standard amount); and the ambiance is one of a comfortable French kitchen - affordable luxury at its best. On to the ""meat and potatoes"" -(1) The shrimp salad was a beautiful harmony of rich shrimp meets crisp greens, creamy avocado, with just the right tinge of champagne vinegar to cut through the creaminess(2) The fried calamari was among the best I've had to date - crisp and importantly, fresh. Not drenched in sauce or overfried to mask frozen calamari, rather perfectly seasoned in basil salt and lightly battered to complement the already exquisite fresh delicacy. (3) The Skuna Bay Salmon on top crisp sushi rice with chipotle mayo was an ode to my childhood but in an inventive way - it took me back to those days I would eat grilled musubis (rice balls), but with added components and made bite size. (4) The fresh spaghetti with basil pistachio pesto was likely my favorite item - I loved how the peppery basil met with the creamy and nutty pistachio to arrive at the blend of flavors no short of a celebration in its own right. (5) The rigatoni with meatballs and smoked pepper tomato each was also delicious but no basil pistachio pesto.  The meatballs were tender, the noodles al dente, and the tomatoes a vibrant beautiful red color that define southern Italy. (6) The lobster burger was absolutely divine, with large chunks of lobster bound by shrimp in an enjoyable burst of both flavors in every bite, all the while balanced with buttery lettuce, tomatoes, and a side of crisp fries. (7) The signature Jean Georges warm chocolate cake was smaller in portion (and flatter) than I had hoped, but it was cooked to perfection, with a very good, authentic bitter yet sweet chocolate taste that was not artificial. The chocolate cake was paired well with the vanilla bean ice cream. (8) The passion fruit pavlova was very light and tangy.  The meringue was sweet, crisp and airy, with the taste of the passion fruit coming through the sorbet core.",2,,1
6,Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",962,883,4893,5.0,1/24/2018,"I had an absolutely wonderful time at Nougatine other night. It was my first time dining here and since it is NYC Restaurant Week, we had a lovely three course pre fixe meal that was to die for. My one issue? I left the restaurant extremely full (first world problems). My friend reminded me of the upcoming restaurant week in NYC and invited me to dinner, my choice. Of course, I had a list of choices and we decided on Nougatine because well, Jean Georges, of course. I have never been and it was a long time since my friend had eaten there. I almost missed my chance at a table. I inadvertently booked a table for 8 AM (I have a no idea how I managed to screw that up) and when I called to find out what happened, the woman I spoke with explained my mistake. Despite there being no tables available at 8 PM, which is what I originally wanted, there was a 9 PM opening available which I jumped on.I found parking in the street just down the block which was very convenient. My friend was waiting for me out front and when we entered the building, I was impressed by how organized they are. We checked in with the maitre d and were able to check our coats at the same time. All three of the women at the host table were gracious and pleasant. We arrived a little before half past 8, just in case we could snag an earlier open table. We were directed to the bar to wait until our table was ready and decided to have a few cocktails. We both had tasty mocktails, I forgot the name of mine (Orchard Blush?) but my friend ordered the Thyme Lemonade. About ten minutes later, one of the hostesses came to check on us and show us to our table. We were able to transfer out drinks and she had our server bring our drinks to us. That is a small gesture but it speaks volumes on their attention to detail. We felt pampered. A few moments after we got cozy at our table, Sarah came by to greet us, give us menus and serve our drinks. Ultimately, we were seated twenty minutes before our reservation time which I greatly appreciated.We opted for the restaurant week pre fixe menu but in true foodie fashion, we also ordered a few items a la carte.Restaurant Week Menu: Tomato Soup - this tasted amazeballs! It's a more than enough bowl of creamy tomato soup poured over a deconstructed grilled cheese. The huge piece of buttery toasted sourdough and cheddar cheese in the bottom of the bowl was a nice touch.Sea Trout Sashimi - my friend's dish which he loved. We both found ourselves pausing in between bites to savour it all. Roasted Organic Chicken - my friend's dish which was served with roasted winter veggies. I tasted a bit of his romanesco and it had a nice smoky char.Wild Flounder - I really liked this dish. The fish was served over spaghetti squash which I love and a light, citrus-y yuzu sauce. I was becoming too full to finish my entrée so I had to make a decision; either eat all my fish or take it home and save my tummy real estate for dessert. Needless to say, dessert won.Warm Chocolate Cake - I loved this. It's their signature dessert, an upgrade on a molten lava cake, served with creamy salted caramel ice cream. I made the best decision to save room for dessert. Roasted Pear - my friend's dish which tasted dreamy. The pear is stuffed with Nutella and paired with a pecan praline and whipped cream.A la Carte: Foie Gras - my friend's extra. It was served on toast with pineapple-meyer lemon jam that I HAD to taste. It was soooo creamy and melted in my mouth. Worth every bite. Burrata - I ordered this extra. The plating was beautifully simple. It was a super creamy burrata ball sitting atop a meyer lemon jam with pumpernickel toasts. Amazing and probably the main reason I couldn't finish my entire meal. The service here is impeccable. Our dishes were cleared on cue, water constantly refilled and we were checked on, regularly. We were served hearty bread while we waited and I would suggest not eating more than two pieces because you will have a most difficult time trying to finish everything.Sarah, our server, was great. She had a wonderful demeanor as did everyone with whom we interacted. My entrée was waiting with the maitre d when we left and I was given a number to claim it on the way out. I would definitely come back and I'm happy to have had this dining experience.",34,17,36
7,Kimberly D.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",103,356,1545,5.0,4/15/2018,"Came here with my husband to celebrate my birthday. Upon arrival, we were asked if we had theater plans afterward, which I thought was great, so they would know if we needed to get out of there by a certain time. We told them we were seeing a concert at Lincoln Center at 7:30. Cocktails were good - my husband ordered a Manhattan, which was delicious. I ordered the Elderflower Paloma (tequila, grapefruit juice, elderflower, soda). I didn't really taste any carbonation, so there must have been only a splash of soda, and the elderflower was super faint. I really only tasted the tequila and grapefruit. Tasty, though.Bread & butter: the bread was delicious. The butter would've been better had it been room temperature rather than cold. Or, if the bread was warm. It made spreading difficult. That's my nitpicky comment for this review :)Amuse bouche: hummus with endive, radish, peas. Nothing fancy - just good fresh veggies and hummus. We opted for the 5-course tasting menu ($118/person) and added on the wine pairings ($78/person).1st Course: tuna tartare, avocado, radish, ginger marinade. This was a great dish in terms of taste and balance.  2nd Course: Foie Gras brule with pineapple-lemon jam and rose salt. The foie gras was amazing on a tiny piece of toast. And the caramelization on top was SO GOOD. A little burnt, a little crispy, a little candied. YUM.3rd Course: This was supposed to be a salmon dish but we asked if the chef would substitute the black sea bass instead. Usually with tasting menus, there are no substitutions so I was happy that they were willing to accommodate. The sea bass was served atop a garlic lemon sauce with fava beans and DELICIOUS artichoke hearts. It was a pretty decent size piece of fish for a tasting menu, I thought, which was nice. Really delicious dish.4th Course: Beef tenderloin, roasted asparagus, jalapeño and a mustard butter. It was cooked very well and was juicy and flavorful. Also a decent size. Delicious.Dessert: passion fruit sorbet, the JG chocolate lava cake, vanilla ice cream atop cookie crumble, and some sort of deliciousness in a ramekin and I forgot what it was! SO GOOD. They even put a candle on the plate and wrote ""happy birthday"" for me :)The wine pairings were spot on - we LOVED everything that was poured for us, including the madeira with dessert.We left the restaurant at 7:10 - only because I realized the time and asked for the check. Good thing we were only going two blocks away! We JUST made our Lincoln Center concert. Maybe they thought we needed to leave by 7:30, not that the concert started at that time. Overall, a wonderful birthday celebration and a great meal. Our second Jean Georges experience (first was in Pound Ridge) and we'll have to try another.",,,
8,Linda T.,"Queens, NY",130,318,1184,4.0,1/26/2018,"I have dined at Nougatine three times and the experience has been good all three times. I have done the lunch prix fixe twice (October 2013 and November 2017) and restaurant week (Winter 2015). I have noticed that their prix fixe menu offerings doesn't change super often, but I know that they always offer their signature warm chocolate cake for dessert. This review is for the lunch prix fixe offering when I dined during my birthday back in November since it was my latest visit and I still remember some of the details.APPETIZER:Fried Calamari: I remember that during my friend order this back when I first dined at Nougatine and it tasted pretty good. So, I decided it order it this time around. The fried calamari wasn't oily at all and it has a nice crispy tempura like texture. Delicious and I recommend it.ENTREE:Roasted Hake: It had a mushroom yuzu vinagrette, celeriac, and shiso. The entree was a little bit salty to me.DESSERT:Warm Chocolate Cake: It also comes with vanilla bean ice cream. I love this dessert. YUM! My boyfriend called the restaurant to make sure they put a happy birthday chocolate sign with the cake. I thought it was cute and nice. :)Overall, I haven't been disappointed here at Nougatine and it's still one of my favorite fine dining establishments. The service has been great and professional. I also recommend people to definitely try coming here for lunch during Winter and Summer NYC restaurant week. You'll get a wonderful meal for $29. If you miss out during NYC restaurant week, then you can try the lunch prix fixe year round for $38.",3,1,2
9,Lan L.,"Boston, MA",73,145,109,4.0,1/26/2018,"Came here for restaurant week and had a great experience. I ordered the creamy tomato soup (definitely too much salt, as the case with most tomato soup), wild gulf flounder with pumpkin seeds (the toasted pumpkin seeds made all the difference), and the chocolate lava cake with ice cream.  Service was wonderful, including coat check service at the entrance.***Note that there are separate entrances to the restaurant and to the hotel so that's definitely a plus. The hotel next door is the last place I'd want to be.",2,,
10,Xinyu L.,"San Francisco, CA",112,177,846,5.0,2/12/2018,"I highly recommend their $38 lunch prix fixe for a weekend brunch, but be sure to make a reservation in advance! You will received a high quality three course meal in a romantic, well serviced restaurant by Central Park.For appetizers, their Tuna Tartare is a must. The chic presentation alone will increase your appetite. All the ingredients were very fresh. The avocado on the bottom complemented the taste and texture of the tuna on the top very well. The sweet sour marinade stimulated my taste buds and provided a unique flavor. The Fried Calamari was fried to perfection with not a lot of breading but somehow still crispy. For the entree, we ordered the Veal, which was very thin and crispy and topped with shredded rich Parmesan. The fried flounder was prepared in an Asian fusion style. Also, the fried pumpkin seeds really complemented the sauce.For dessert, the Passion Fruit Pavlova was a total hit. It was very creatively composed. The passion fruit was just sour enough and not overly sweet. The Warm Chocolate Lava cake a la mode was great as well. The lava was very smooth and went very well with the vanilla ice cream.",,,3
11,Kelly T.,"Rockville, MD",57,87,144,5.0,3/16/2018,Olga and I dined here for breakfast this morning and had a fabulous time! This is our second time here and we will dream about the Avocado Toast until our next trip to NYC. We also ordered the Brioche French Toast with Apples and the Green juice. The Avocado Toast is creamy with exciting flavors of chili flakes and sunflower seeds. The server added fresh ground pepper to top off the dish. The service is spectacular including a coat room and clean bathrooms. Every person we interacted with was friendly and wanted to ensure we had a great morning. We can't wait for our next visit!,,,
12,Kevin T.,"New York, NY",281,70,173,5.0,3/13/2018,"I've been here twice now - once for Restaurant Week lunch and the second for Valentine's Day. I was seriously impressed both times, and can't wait to come back.While Nougatine is the more casual accompanying restaurant to Jean-Georges, though it is still pretty upscale. All the patrons here are pretty well-dressed, and you'll need a reservation in advance to avoid sitting at the bar. In my opinion, it's a bargain because the dishes here are crafted by the same team managing Jean-Georges - you can tell that thought and care went into each plate on the menu.My favorites include the Tuna Tartare (nicely presented on top of a bed of avocado and ginger marinade with a radish flower on top), the Fried Calamari (really well seasoned, not overbreaded, rich dipping sauce), and the Warm Chocolate Cake (one of the best lava cakes I've had). When I came for Restaurant Week, I had the Veal Milanese, which was honestly a bit forgettable - though I liked how it paired with parmesan. My date had the Zucca, and raved about the meatballs.We had a great experience coming back for Valentine's Day. The staff were extremely polite and accommodating. We initially got seated in a relatively cramped corner near the kitchen against the wall, but they were very flexible and moved us to a nice window seat as soon as one opened up. They also gave us lots of small sushi bites on the house for the occasion. We had the 28 Day Dry Aged Ribeye for Two, which was flawless.This place is great. Impeccable service, casual yet upscale ambience, food served by a Michelin star team at a good value. I would definitely come back.",,,
13,Jessica Z.,"Elmhurst, NY",240,178,1779,3.0,2/5/2018,"First time here, dropped in without a reservation during Restaurant Week. The hostess informed me that without a reservation and if they're booked, guests will be seated by the bar. So I recommend getting your coat checked to conserve seating space on your chair. And make a reservation prior if it's not too late already because having ate a meal at their bar, it completely ruined the dinning experience at a nice restaurant for me. I don't like being stuck inbetween people who occasionally elbows you and knocks your arms while you're holding your utensils....and surrounded by mutiple groups of people and their conversation...Esp in close proximity is just migraine inducing...(yes...I did get one) let's just say ..Money can't but class or manners....smhUpon entering, the atmosphere ..it's beautiful...The interior decoration is cohesive, with its transparent kitchen in the back. After being seated, it was nice to find purse hooks beneath the bar counter. And the chairs by the bar weren't backless, it's half way for support..And aestetics of their overall dinning interior style.The snacks at the table by the bar: popcorn with olive oil, pulverized rosemary and sprinkles of cayenne pepper on top, pretzel sticks, wasbi covered peanuts, five spice almonds with rosemary and chili powder. The menu selection for restaurant week was very limiting..as in only two entree options, vegetarian or chicken ...:/..However, quality dinner... The appetizer I picked was the Seared Gulf shrimps....but don't let the name fool you....it's not large shrimps folks....however, the puree from the shrimp was deliciously mind puzzling when I was trying to figure out the sensation on my taste buds; it's playful on its own.The roasted chicken entree....reminded me of flatiron pressed chicken from how it looked upon arrival. The skin was crispy and it was pleasantly deboned, paired with light seasoning that also came with a pour on broth, which changed the experience a bit. The entree was light and delicious.The dessert recommended was the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. The chocolate cake was soft and the filling was dark chocolate...however, it just felt like a richer lava cake to me. The star of the dish was the salted caramel iced cream and the extra crispy decoration on top...(which I wished the cookie crumbles beneath the ice cream was actually crispy and not so stale....)However, the biggest pet peeve tonight outside of dinning at the bar....Was the frozen butter that came straight out of the fridge...I was half way done with my entree and the butter was still too stiff to smear over the slice of bread provided ...:/ ...No butter is supposed to provide hand discomfort...They took a new tray of butter that had to be heated twice since the first try got it to the same room temperature as the first one. And the second attempt didn't soften the whole thing neither.... You'd be better off asking for olive oil and surrender the butter completely....Side Note:*Google maps might be abit confusing for this place, it's located on the block behind the Trump hotel.*The regular menu item that caught my eye was the Dry aged  Ribeye steak for two thats $138. It is a bone-in steak that's 32oz before cooking.FYI:The recommended ""Less crowded"" day for the bar area: Mondays and Sundays..Around 5pm, when the bar first opens...Till about 5:30pm and then Later on around 9pmAnd for other days..Come around 445pm to be safe.* Sit by the ends of the bar if you want to avoid the crowd swarming sensation...People tend to gravitate towards the middle of the bar and it'll feel like a fully surrender ambush of people...*There is No Happy Hour at this place...But they do have a lot of regulars that lives and works in the area.*Hostesses stated that reservations needs to be made ""at least two weeks prior""... (Surprised)Highlight was the service provided from the bar staff (Justin is very knowledgeable and his recommdations were spot on. Most bartenders I observed, knew their regulars by name, with their preferences, just great),  the interesting bar snacks in the multi tray, and the salted caramel iced cream. However, not impressed, esp. for a restaurant listed with a notable chef.... I expected to be wowed by greatness and not it's mediocrity.",1,,

It's worthy of having this meal with such price. Each dish is such artistic presentation, stimulating your appetite!The bread served as side is better than I ever had in other restaurants.Appetizer: Tuna Tartare: tastes very fresh and tasty mixed with the mixture of avocados and wasabi, and the a little sour sauce at the bottom.Fried Calamari: tender inside and crispy outside with large portion of calamari and very thin breading. The best fried calamari I have ever had!Entrees:The veal: perfectly cooked with exquisite shredded Parmesan Cheese on the top! The veal is tender with very thin crispy surface.

15,Sarah X.,"New York, NY",50,100,260,4.0,2/12/2018,"Had an overall really great experience here during Restaurant Week 2018. Each of the dishes were pretty unique and left feeling extremely stuffed at the end.Seared gulf shrimp, butternut squash, ginger & basil dish: pretty good dish, the shrimp was seared well and the flavors complimented each otherRoasted chicken, onion compote, long beans and spice broth dish: the portion size for this was huge (two really large pieces of chicken). The chicken wasn't too dry and the broth paired well with the chicken. The long beans and onion seemed fine, but nothing super uniqueWarm chocolate cake and salted caramel ice cream dish: this was my favorite dish of the meal (although I love desserts in general). The dish was plated really well and the chocolate cake was extremely warm and melty inside and was perfect with the ice cream. Probably one of the best lava cake-esque desserts I've hadWould definitely recommend this place, but if you're not going for Restaurant Week, would probably suggest just going for Jean-Georges instead of Nougatine",,,1
16,April H.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,256,201,1.0,2/11/2018,"Nope. A friend and I came for her birthday during Restaurant Week. We both looked at the very limited menu (2 options for each course) and I opted out of it. I got their burger ($19) and it just wasn't good. It was cooked well, medium, but the beef wasn't seasoned. The sauce was just Russian dressing. It wasn't easy to eat or pick up either, due to the arrangement of the layers. They did it in kind of an ""assemble your own"" style that wasn't super successful. The yuzu pickles were good- I finished all of those- but, the best thing about a $20 burger shouldn't be the pickles. The fries were shoestring fries, which I normally like, but these were fried at an incorrect temperature and were just soaked with grease. It was also EXTREMELY cold here. We, and the table behind us, brought this to the attention of the server and were basically told to deal with it. I will admit, with how cold I was, it would have been very difficult to enjoy even the most expertly prepared meal. It did finally start to warm up towards the end, but we really could have done without the waitress's attitude about it. And the staff. Yeah. Our waitress made it seem like we were a burden and inconveniencing her. I watched her argue with the table next to us (a different table than the other table who complained about the cold) when a chicken, one of the restaurant week dishes, was underdone. I saw the meat- it was. But this waitress just proceeded to insist it was ""cooked to a safe temperature"" and ""organic birds still look pink when cooked"" with the customer. It made things really uncomfortable for everyone around. Not to mention, it made me very glad I didn't do the restaurant week menu. The ""saving grace"" of this place? Dessert. I got the candied pineapple. It was, honestly, excellent. But with so many world renowned dessert places in NYC, there's no chance I'd be back just for dessert. Overall, thanks Nougatine! You've convinced me I never need to try Jean George.",,,
17,Douglas K.,"Charlottesville, VA",226,68,311,4.0,6/23/2018,"We came here for a rushed lunch yesterday after hearing the hype. I was frustrated that the restaurant could not hold a reservation for more than 20 minutes.But, I was pleasantly surprised by the offerings. I chose from the prix fixe menu which allowed me to choose an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert for only $38. I went with the beef tartare, a pasta with a light tomato sauce, and the chocolate cake. My table also ordered some calamari.The tartare was excellently presented with a sauce added for flourish before we dug in. The pasta though was mediocre, although I liked the meatballs that went with the dish. I was probably most satisfied by the dessert. The chocolate cake melted in my mouth and was truly luxuriant. Overall, I had a good lunch for the price, but the entree could have been done better.",,,

20,Jessica M.,"Manhattan, NY",494,19,41,5.0,5/22/2018,"Came here on two occasions for prix fixe lunch and Restaurant Week dinner :) Nougatine is one of my favorite restaurants because of its tranquil, beautiful view of Central Park, exceptional service, and beautifully inventive, delicious food. While it is more casual and less stuffy than its sister restaurant Jean-George's right next door, it is still pretty upscale for a special occasion. Lunch ($38)1) The tuna tartare was really fresh and delicious - a beautiful presentation on a bed of avocado and tangy ginger marinade, with a pretty radish flower on top. Almost too pretty to eat :) 2) I ordered the black cherry yuzu and it was amazingly refreshing and complemented the rest of my meal well.  3) The sesame crusted salmon was incredibly tender, and had a wonderfully masterful sear and crisp on the outside. The potatoes were sautéed and everything was paired super well. 4) To conclude with the wonderful, classic warm chocolate cake and salted caramel ice cream, my lunch was complete! The chocolate cake was gooey and warm and melty, and the ice cream was decadently rich.  Dinner 1) The sea trout sashimi was really fresh and had a wonderful texture - the hint of lime and mint really added to its flavor.2) The flounder tasted delicious with the soy yuzu broth and the pieces of spaghetti squash tasted crunchy like chips. 3) I was full already from the flounder and barely finished my warm chocolate cake and caramel ice cream :) but it was amazing as usual.",1,,2
21,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",408,733,596,5.0,10/31/2017,"Excellent preparation and intelligent flavor balances for the most part. The environment feels slightly clinical and cold. It's not a cozy intimate dining experience. I ordered the foie gras brulé supplement along with a prix fixe selection ($38) of Tuna Tartare, Roast Hake, and Chocolate cake. The meal started with mediocre bread and butter that was OK, but was served cool with a very firm butter that lacked creaminess. I was very disappointed Jean Georges doesn't serve well-executed bread. There wasn't even a selection. Just a piece of mediocre bread. The foie brulé was perfectly smooth like butter yet the sear on top was impossibly crisp and maillardy. The brioche underneath added an interesting variation in mouthfeel. The dish is served with an unctuous fig marmalade. It's creamy and sweet with an intense fig flavor. The foie was incredibly rich and the fig cut into the fattiness in a perfect complement. This dish was ethereal. The tuna tartare primarily excelled in execution. The tuna was perfectly smooth and mouthmelting. But, it lacked flavor. Thus the acidic sauce and micro-greens left the taste of a vinegary salad. I understand the dish is designed to prepare the palate, but I felt it was overly acidic. The hake was very nicely executed, but could have used more seasoning. The fish tasted very plain and still wasn't as fall-apart as I've seen from sous-vide preparations. I'd like to see the dish challenge the palate more. The hake was served on a perfectly cooked potato. It almost tasted meaty. The chocolate cake was similar to a lava cake. It was extremely well-executed. The crumb was moist, deeply sweet and buttery. The cake is served upside down and oozes chocolate sauce as you break into it. The ice cream was smooth and creamy, a nice temperature and flavor contrast to the cake. Overall, I liked the meal a lot, so I give it 5/5 stars. However, I took objection to some of the flavors and execution decisions. The environment is not quite as luxurious as other 3-star options in NY. I definitely prefer Le Bernardin's City Harvest menu, even at the slightly higher price point.",2,1,

How insanely rude. Creating a spectacle for such a simple request.  PRICE FIXE LUNCH $381. Tuna Tartare - I thought the lauded tuna fish was very one note. Mushy and salty. Pretty though, take pics!2. Black bass - this was worth it. The crisp on the fish was masterful and the basil vinaigrette paired well - much needed acid. 3. Strawberry Pavlova - Overkill. Pavlova sticks to teeth. Gelato, pavlova AND soaked strawberries together was a CLOYING combination. Avoid. Pretty though. Food 3.5 Stars. Service 2 Stars.

Updated review","Everything stated in my previous review remains a 100% true. However today's experience was sub par. I will make this brief PLEASE READ MY PREVIOUS REVIEW AFTER READING THIS ONEWe did not recieve breadMy tuna tartare did not have its sauce poured until everyone was practically doneOne of the entrees was wrongAnd everything including the service was slowMost of the entrees were cold to room temperatureThe dessert and the check took forever to comeIt pains me to say this but this does not reflect my lifetime experience. It was an off day and it happens to the best of us. However this place still stands on my top 10 restaurants ever and I feel that if I came back again, the JG we all know and expect will still remain",4,,1

The texture of that fried body together with the basil salt, citrus-chili sauce sliding around my mouth brought a pleasurable sensation. It felt like I was being groped by wet, chewy tentacles in all the right places. For dessert, I had the warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream. Nowhere on earth have I ever had such decadent melted chocolate oozing out of a pastry.

For entree, they have meat, yeah, the cheapest meat, chicken and flounder.The appetizer that I ordered, tomato soup, should be the worst food I had in 2018.

I also saw JG himself in the open kitchen this time. I was hesitant to order from the RW menu, but I went with it because my three other friends order from there. Hey, it's easier to split the bill. Now the food: Cucumber and yogurt soup: I normally dislike chilled soup. I never really had a gazpacho I loved. This cucumber chilled soup was something else. It doesn't have the overwhelming vinegar-taste from your usual chill soup. The yogurt and berries worked well and made the whole dish super appetizing. Trout: this simple dish was delicious. The highlight was the corn puree. They probably mixed some crack in there. The RW menu was simple but delicious, and it didn't cost an arm and leg.",3,,
32,Christine K.,"Flushing, NY",383,81,71,3.0,8/6/2017,"Overall, a very underwhelming experience. I went for a Tuesday restaurant week dinner. I keep wondering if the food was sub-par because it was for Restaurant Week, but that really should not be the case. Although it's a small discount of the original price, the prix fixe menu is still a significant cost. The service was fine, and although the atmosphere has something to be desired, it didn't affect me that much. I knew what I was getting into. If the original Jean Georges was Nordstrom, Nougatine would be the Nordstrom Rack. Still, I was expecting a great, if not exceptional, culinary experience. I am no picky eater, and most dishes satisfy me. Especially if I'm paying a hefty price for it. But the dishes here were... just okay. Borderline satisfying. To start off, the bread and butter were alright. I could get a better bread basket at my local diner, but hey, a bread basket is no way to measure the quality of a restaurant.Then the salad came. Honestly, the one main reason I chose to have the salad was because it listed avocado has being one of its ingredients. One of my friends also got the salad, with a small piece of avocado. Mine had zero. I would think that a restaurant like this would at least be consistent with its dishes. And although I enjoyed the sour vinaigrette dressing, if a person with normal taste buds (aka does not eat lemons for fun) tried it, it might have been way too strong. Finally, my entree. I got the organic chicken. Now, I'm always wary of ordering chicken at restaurants, since it can often come out dry. First bite, I was impressed. Halfway through, it was dry. If I was at any other diner or restaurant, I wouldn't really be surprised. But honestly, I wanted to hold Nougatine to a higher standard. Finally, we finished off with a dessert which was also okay. Overall, a very ""okay"" dinner experience. But if I'm paying a hefty price for it, okay is simply not good enough. I would much prefer to spend my money elsewhere. I do not think I will be returning.",3,,
33,Jingqiao H.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",157,172,2583,3.0,7/25/2017,"Very disappointed about our experience here today (2.8/5.0).We came for a late lunch (Restaurant Week lunch prix fixe). The staff were not welcoming at all. They didn't have smiles on their faces, or am I asking for too much? This is a well reputed restaurant and the staff were just cold to their guests!After we were seated, we waited for like 5 mins until they gave us menu. Another 5 mins between first and second course (2-3 mins is reasonable, in my opinion). No water refill and didn't check on us while eating until they came to clean up plates. They did ask if we want more bread, once. The butter stayed on the table even after we finished the bread (which is fine, I'm just being picky here). The food was mediocre. The appetizer soup was sorta salty, and my friend's salad was nothing but a plate of sad vegetables. We can even make a better salad at home. The main course, flounder on a bed of corn pudding, was delicious overall, but the corn pudding was way too salty, and the fish was pan-fried in too much oil. The best part was the chocolate cake and caramel ice cream, which was not overly sweet.Because of all the hypes and popularity, I had a high expectation.

35,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",188,185,527,5.0,2/12/2018,"I had been to Jean Georges a few times but had never been to Nougatine.  My friends and I decided to come for dinner for restaurant week, and I actually like this place better than Jean Georges.We ended up not even getting the restaurant week menu because the options were not the same as the menu we found online, and they were frankly really bad options.  Also, the prices here are pretty reasonable so even with an appetizer and entree per person, and dessert to share and a glass of wine each - it was $88 per person with tip, that's pretty good.For the appetizers my one friend and I shared the tuna tartare and the foie gras (my other friend ordered the tartare for herself).  The tartare is basically like the tuna ribbons at Jean Georges and the server said the sauce is even the same.  The tuna ribbons (and now tuna tartare at Nougatine) is one of my favorite dishes, so I was happy to see that this is the same just in a different form (they're not in a ribbon shape).  The foie gras was AMAZING.  So well prepared and flavorful and the brioche on the bottom was great.For the entree my one friend and I shared the burger and the poppyseed crusted salmon (my other friend ordered the veal, which was a very large portion.  The burger was quite large and soo juicy/yummy with a delicious sauce.  The french fries were thin and cirspy awesomeness. I was hesitant to order the salmon because the thing I don't like about Jean Georges is how all the entrees are over seasoned and crusted and poppy seed crust didn't sound promising.  That being said, it was not overpowering and the salmon was cooked very well and the dish was balanced.We were pretty full so the three of us just shared 1 chocolate dessert, which had a warm gooey center and was perfect.Overall, I'm a big fan of Nougatine and would choose this place again over Jean Georges.",1,1,1

39,Jay I.,"New York, NY",250,680,188,4.0,12/30/2017,"Nougatine is the little brother restaurant of the famous Jean Georges which is also housed in Trump Hotel.  Decided to dine here for Christmas (not the exact day) this year as I thought Jean Georges was a bit (a lot in fact) over my budget.  It is definitely the casual side of Jean George, but is very classy and great for a special dinner.We were led by the hosts to a table which was very close to the entrance (I would take it as I made the arrangement pretty late, but this is an issue that I will bring up at one point at a restaurant in the future.  We will see when that will be).We started with sunchoke soup with truffle which was warm and also tasted great.  Were also given sourdough bread to start with (actually the table next to me had a variety of bread while we only got the sourdough so I request other kind and they complied with it.  But then it seemed like the next table was a regular at Jean Georges and they were gettting some of the stuff served from Jean Georges, not Nougatine... so If you see someone getting stuff you were not offered, that's why).Then we had shrimp salad and crab cake.  I had crab cake because I had a good experience with the same dish at the Mark by Jean Georges and it was still good.  The shrimp tasted really good and the texture was almost like that of langostine.  Also the portion was so big that people with small stomach can take it as a full entree even.  The next one ordered was basil and pistachio pasta to share, which was also really good. For entree we had pork chop which was very crisp outside but tender inside.  Perfectly medium cooked.  Chicken was good.  The skin was perfectly crispy, but it would have been better if the meat was a little more juicy.  For dessert, none other than the signature lava cake I always loved in all Jean Georges. Don't underestimate Nougatine because it is the little one of Jean Georges.  It will still haunt your wallet, but overall I think it was well worth it for our Christmas dinner.",2,,1

APPETIZER: I got the trout sashimi with pistachios and lime and the textures and flavors were perfect. I loved how the crunch of the pistachios contrasted with the softer texture of the sashimi so it was already a great start to the meal. My one complaint here is that it was a pretty small portion compared to other appetizers I've eaten, but the flavors were delicious.ENTREE: This was probably one of my favorite entrees at any restaurant I've eaten at. I got the flounder with a soy yuzu broth and I loved this dish because the portion size was HUGE. I haven't seen that big of a portion at such a high end place so it was definitely worth the money. The broth was also great and didn't overpower the fish (they only poured a tiny bit of broth on so it was good that they did that) and the most surprising part was the spaghetti squash. I was not expecting spaghetti squash to have the crunch that this did and it was delicious and provided a nice contrast to the rest of the dish. Overall, fantastic.DESSERT: Of course I got the chocolate lava cake and salted caramel ice cream. I absolutely loved how the two parts worked together in terms of hot and cold and it was definitely a quality dessert. I'd say I've had better desserts at other restaurants, but it was definitely a great dessert.SERVICE: The service here was fantastic - the waiter came back to check on our courses, we never had to ask for more bread or water, and it was overall just quality service.Overall, I don't have many complaints and I was pretty blown away by the quality of the meal - definitely recommend it!",,,

While I loved the textures and flavors in my fish dish, my Husband's chicken had a weird smell/taste to it and our server upon hearing it happily suggested to change the dish. So my husband too ended up getting the flounder which was incredible. The yuzu broth balanced the flavors superbly.For dessert we got the molten chocolate cake with caramel ice cream which is Jean-Jeorges signature dessert and I can totally imagine why. It was flawless and perfectly molten in the center. We also got the poached pear with pecan praline which was realy nice too, especially paired with earl grey.

Updated review","Tucked between the entrance and main dining room of Jean-Georges, Nougatine offers the culinary prowess of JG in a more relaxed environment. Make no mistake, though, it is still quite sumptuous and a treat to enjoy. The environment is unabashedly luxe, as are the clientele, and the space has a nice energy with the open kitchen close at hand. The food at Nougatine is clear in concept and executed with precision by the same team serving two Michelin star Jean-Georges and offers great value. If that's not enough to win you over, the cocktail and wine list should seal the deal - both are extensive and well done. Overall, a great place to dine and a reliable choice we can't help revisiting.Atmosphere- Clean and airy, with luxe finishes; open to the kitchen serving both Nougatine and Jean-Georges.- Generally well-dressed (and well-heeled) clientele in spite of the 'causal' descriptor.- Space is not very large, so expect most tables to be rather close together and tucked into various nooks and crannies.FoodOur experience at Nougatine over many visits has shown the food to be consistently high quality with superb execution and elegant flavor profiles befitting the season. It is prepared by the same kitchen as Jean-Georges, giving it great quality to value. The menu has good breadth across light/heavy and tastes, making it versatile to many groups/occasions. On this visit we had:- Foie Gras Brulé (Pineapple-Meyer Lemon Jam, Rose - $26): Just the right amount of decadance, bruleed foie atop pastry, the jam paired perfectly. Not too heavy.- Spaccatelli Pasta (Caramelized Brussel Sprouts, Basil-Pistachio Pesto - $25): One of our perennial favorites on the menu, great in the fall/winter; though woefully under-salted this time.- Sautéed Black Sea Bass (Broccoli Rabe, Sesame Vinaigrette, Lavender - $35): Perfectly cooked, the vinaigrette was an excellent complement. Great lighter option.- Soy Glazed Beef Short Ribs (Apple-Jalapeno Puree, Rosemary Crumbs - $41): Decadent and rich, but so comforting on a winter's eve.- Creme Fraiche Cheesecake (Cranberry-Orange Compote, Pistachio - $12): Loved the concept and taste, much lighter than normal cheesecake.BeverageThe bar at Nougatine is clearly one of the venue's strong suits, and reason enough to stop over, though seats disappear quickly. The bartenders always make an excellent martini ($24), and are great at listening to and adjusting for your preferences. The cocktail list is very well conceived, and my wife loves the Elderflower Paloma (Casamigos Blanco Tequila, Elderflower, Grapefruit, Soda - $18) which is quite refreshing without being too sweet. Nougatine offers a very extensive and well-selected wines by the glass list, with something for everyone, as well as the full wine list available in Jean Georges, if you care to splurge. I keep returning to the 2015 Ponzi Pinot Noir ($18).Service- Historically quite good and attentive.- This visit, our waiter wasn't representative of our typical experiences. He was rather awkward (asking as soon as we sat down if we were celebrating something?, seemed incapable of understanding we would share some early courses) and simply didn't listen to our requests (from pacing of courses, to removing items from the table, etc.). Detracted one star based on this.",,,

49,Kevin Z.,"Manhattan, NY",278,12,7,4.0,3/16/2018,"I had a satisfactory Michelin fine-dining experience for 3 dollar signs, which is fine by me. I called for a reservation that afternoon for an evening date, a relatively brazen, overstretching demand for a popularized Manhattan restaurant for which they graciously able to accommodate (although to be honest, it was a Sunday). When we entered, we were greeted by an amiable team of attendants who took our coat check and sat us down at our table briskly. While it is in a Trump building with a gaudy exterior, the interior on both the hotel side and the entrance was actually very elegant and posh.  While walking to our table, I glanced into a portal of white table cloths and superior lighting ornaments, of which I assumed the actual Jean Georges was situated. However, the large windows overlooking the Park and modern hotel getup of Nougatine was a force to be reckoned with in its own right. We sat down, had a fine red that waiter recommended and the overly decadent Foie Gras Brule appetizer (though I'll give it credit for its gumption and finely-executed caramelized shell). I ordered the soy-glazed short rib, which was tender of a modern with a non-traditional flavorful twang expected for an establishment that errs on the more adventurous side.

As soon as I sat down, the waiter walked over, looked me in the eye and said in a demanding manner ""YOU HAVE TO PLACE ALL ORDERS BY 11 SHARP! AND PUT IN ORDERS FOR EVERYTHING BEFORE THEN!""  No greeting, no smiles, just annoyed that I sat down at that time, although yelp provides for reservations at that time.  So we rushed to order the food.  During our meal, they kept on coming to clear our plates (even while there was food on it) interrupting my conversation with my friend.  Every time a different person came by trying to clear my plate repeatedly.  As far as I can remember, more than six times.  A lady tried clearing a plate with more than half a plate of fruit left over.  And when we said we were working on it, the lady gave me a cold eye.  So weird.  Do they not train their employees?  We almost felt like they were trying to drive us out, so we ordered additional desserts so that we can sit for a little while longer.  Service really was not great at all and I did not feel welcomed.

The difference between Nougatine at Jean-Georges & Jean-Georges is like First Class seating. Same wait staff, same chefs, same food. Its the same at Le Cirque. I don't like to wait and stand around. When I arrive, it's on. There's seating available in Nougatine at Jean-Georges? Cool. It's my wife's birthday in January. Without fail, when I plan something for her, the weather will muck up our plans. Not to fear, I rescheduled on a beautiful Sunday and made our brunch reservation work. We arrive and the front desk says my name properly. Man, kudos to you! They take our coats and seated not to far from the open kitchen. Don't like the open kitchen? Make a reservation for Jean-Georges. We're given brunch menus. The price fixe is calling me because of the warm, flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream.My wife always ordered better than me! She starts with a beet salad mixed with Gorgonzola. The beets were so sweet, very nice choice. I ordered the calamari starter. Cooked very well, it was a nice starter for me (I wanted the beets after tasting hers)She ordered a fish dish, another perfectly executed dish. The skin was crispy and the meat was buttery, Mmm mm, amazing.I ordered a lobster burger. It was a thick patty of lobster chucks and fillers, a very tasty treat. On a supermarket, sesame seeded bun? What the what?! Yep, the bun was straight from the bag. That will get you a start knocked off. Sorry Jean-Georges.Our desserts come out, we both ordered the warm, flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream. I poke at the cake and chocolate oozes out. OMG, this dish was so sinful. Simply an amazing ending. Our waiter was all over us, how is everything, is there anything I can do while I'm here? A total professional. There's a dude holding the door! Your job, if you choose to accept it is to hold the door for the guests. The front desk? Welcoming from start to finish. Want a great brunch experience in NYC? Find the Trump Building at Columbus Circle, there you'll find Jean-Georges. Anywhere you sit is fine in my humble opinion",12,6,9
53,Oliver L.,"San Francisco, CA",95,273,162,4.0,3/8/2017,"Had a great dinner here during a trip to New York. I opted for the ahi tuna tartare to start and the roasted Dover sole as my main course. The tartare was decent, although I thought the sauce was a bit ginger-forward. However, the sole was phenomenal - cooked perfectly with a brown butter sauce, and served with decadently rich potatoes. At this point I was stuffed, but managed to make room for a scoop of pistachio ice cream, which was good as well. Service was attentive, although a bit impersonal. Decor and ambiance were nice, but not as formal as the Jean Georges dining room - great place to grab a casual yet upscale dinner.",2,,
54,Hanna S.,"Midtown West, Manhattan, NY",9,13,8,5.0,9/23/2017,Best lunch experience ever. Service was impeccable and good amazing. We did the PF lunch as very hard to pass up on this amazing value. I did tuna tartare for starter - mind blowing! My husband had the calamaris that hands down was the best calamaris I've ever tried. Main I had bass that was really light and tasty fitting this hot summer day. Husband had the salmon that was even more delicious. Dessert everyone at my table had the chocolate cake while I did the strawberry pavlova that was right up my ally - Devine. Drinks we did rose wine from Provence all way through. To top off the experience I got to thank jean George in person for the meal. We will be back for sure!,1,,1
55,Hanna K.,"New York, NY",18,72,270,4.0,10/24/2017,"Great food, nice ambience, okay service.Jean Georges said hi to me when we made an eye contact. We asked the server if we could take a picture with him but the server  forgot to ask the chef before he left the restaurant...lol",,,
56,Martha H.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,47,63,3.0,3/4/2018,"We went here towards the end of restaurant week. They didn't publish the menu beforehand but I expected from what I'd heard about the restaurant that it would be good. We were severely disappointed with the choices, and my friend decided to get something off of the regular menu. I had the restaurant week menu of the shrimp appetizer, the bolognese pasta and then the chocolate lava cake with salted caramel ice cream. Let me start by saying the desert was ah-mazing! The lava cake was moist and delicious and served at just the right temperature, and the ice cream was excellent. But, the rest of the meal was very lacking. The appetizer was pretty bland and just nothing exciting and the bolognese has very little sauce on it and could have used more seasoning. My friend was also disappointed with her meal and as I mentioned she ordered off the regular menu. Her fries were extremely greasy and the burger was very difficult to eat the way it was put together. We also saw the table next to us cut into their chicken to find it was undercooked - and from our table it did look undercooked - but the waiter proceed to tell her ""oh, no that's just the way the chicken is prepared"" instead of taking it back.",1,,
57,G S.,"Manhattan, NY",6,162,2,2.0,5/6/2018,"I went for brunch/lunch on a Sunday. While the food was good (not great, just good) the service was really not good. I ordered the calamari, lobster burger and pavlova. All 3-4 star worth, if in my local restaurant but higher standards are given when at a JG. 3 star average for food. But the service. Wow. I'm not sure if they were trialing wait staff that day but it was really off putting and out of sync. Our first course came before our drinks (nothing fancy ordered - one smoothie, one soda). The second courses appeared (but not served) before our first course was finished (I'm not known as a terribly slow eater either). I saw them come to the table with the plates and turn around when they saw our plates had not been cleared. Or finished. The third course was timed well. As it was a business lunch, we wanted to talk a bit more but the waiter asked if there was anything else, we said no and the bill just appeared behind his back and popped onto our table. We felt very rushed. I mean even if it wasn't business, it was Sunday, we ordered 3 courses so it was a very casual, relaxed day... We then felt a bit better that the service was just terrible for everyone and not just us when the gentleman next to us only received his first *bottle* of wine half way through his second/main course!!! This is my second JG experience and while the other time the service was better, I had raw fish served to me - so I'm rating JG as an overall dud place to go.",,,

Get the watermelon salad with goat cheese, angel hair pasta and berry soup with ice cream dessert...yum, yum and yum again.  Missed the five point mark because of a few service hiccups but I'll be back!",,,
61,Nick D.,"Ocean City, NJ",0,42,114,5.0,11/11/2017,"What an awesome restaurant. Everything from the ambiance, to the service, to the most important thing--the quality and taste of the food. The portions aren't incredibly small, even though you would expect them to be small. The quality of the food is difficult to beat--even in NYC. The tuna tartare, salad with shrimp and champagne vinaigrette were beyond excellent. All the food here is 5 stars and does not disappoint. The only thing I noted was that if you stay too long after finishing your meal, someone in management comes over and asks you to leave your table. It happened to 2 tables that were sitting at their table after finishing their desserts and coffee.  A gentleman asked them to vacate the table so they could set it up for the next guest. I guess they want to seat customers at their appointed reservation time, but I could see how that would irk some people. I'm not one of those diners that sits around long after a meal, but I know plenty of people who do--especially if you're on a date!  Still though, this place is a solid 5 stars.",,,
62,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1479,4342,5.0,1/16/2017,"Had an amazing lunch here. I was not thrilled to step foot on a Trump property, but food wins in the end and I will say I'm glad I risked it. My friend and I each had the pre-fixe and shared:+ shrimp salad + tuna tartare+ hake+ sea bass?+ signature chocolate dessert* grapefruit pavlovaThe tartare and hake were definitely the standout dishes, but honestly everything was nearly perfect with the exception of the cake, which wasn't hot enough. It's a good deal for the pre fixe considering the quality, and it's definitely better food than Perry St though the menus are similar. Would come back.",1,2,2
63,Jessica K.,"New York, NY",177,340,1146,5.0,3/3/2017,"You can never go wrong with any Jean Georges' restaurant! Besides food, the customer service is impeccable! I've never been to the restaurant where so much attention is given to the customer. They were so attentive to the point where a waiter actually rushed over just to help me get seated. He was so fast I didn't even see him coming! Food's amazing as well! We had ordered the Black Sea bass, salmon and the fried calamari, and all were prepared to perfection. Absolutely loved it!Ambience was great, and the environment was very comfortable.Overall, highly recommended!",,,1
64,Shree W.,"Dayton, OH",4,16,9,1.0,8/5/2018,"Nice-looking dish, which helps them earn the one star. Raw rice served with ""Sichuan styled"" roasted chicken. Please use a rice cooker and please do not open the lid to check your rice until it is fully cooked. Please do not use the item of ""Sichuan styled"" unless you know what is authentic Sichuan food means. The chicken sauce is sweet and sour, tasting like Merlot with syrup. Good luck for next year's Michelin",,,

Everything we ordered were perfectly cooked, seasoned, and presented.  My favorite is the hake dish. I also love their fruity sodas (passion fruit and cherry are awesome) It is not easy to score a razzi so plan ahead if you would like to dine here.  Service is also excellent, as expected.",,,

Updated review","I have very mixed feelings about Nougatine. The hubby and I are long time fans of Jean-George restaurants  and know that some are definitely better than others.   This restaurant gave the appearance of being helpful and accommodating, but were they really? That is where I have mixed feelings.We arrived on time for our reservation and were promptly shown to our table in the front of the restaurant. Right in the mid-day sun. After sitting in my seat for 5 minutes, I asked the server if the shade can be pulled down further as it was at least 90 degrees in the sun. I was told that the shade could go no lower. After another few minutes, sweat dripping down my face, I asked for a different table. The maitre d told me that we can sit at a table across from us, out of the sun but we would have to be done with our meal by 1:15 (at that moment, it was 12:20). Seriously? You are giving me less than an hour to eat lunch at a 5 star restaurant? It's not like we walked in without a reservation, quite the contrary. I told her that was unacceptable. She stepped away and whispered something to another server, I can only imagine what she said. I would expect this at an Applebees, but not from a Jean-George restaurant. She returned a few minutes later, offering us a table in the back of the restaurant which we accepted.The service after this snafu was fairly good, although the servers were circling the table next to us like sharks because the 2 women were eating very slowly. Twice they tried to take away one of the women's plate while she was still eating - again not acceptable at a Jean-George establishment. We had:- Tuna Tartare - delicious- Shrimp Salad - very good- Amish Chicken - delicious- Black Bass - very good- Pavlova - tasty- Chocolate Cake - very goodHonestly, this would have been a 4 star review if the service was up to par. I was tempted to give it 2 stars but the food is really terrific. Not sure if I would come back though.",13,8,9
69,Jenny P.,"Washington, DC",222,696,729,3.0,6/2/2017,"Caveat: I am devoting the first paragraph of this review to address the faults in the service. The question: How do you manage a 3 course meal so that you don't rush the guests but also don't draw it out too long? Answer: TBD - as Nougatine still has to work out the kinks. My colleagues and I dined here today to a rather shocking 2 hours and 10 minutes lunch (from when I sat down, not when I left the office), not necessarily due to flowing conversation, but because there was literally a lull of 20-30 minutes gap between each course. I understand that this is not the original Jean-Georges, but I am (and was) quite surprised that service could be so slow given the namesake. Nougatine shouldn't be second-place to Jean-Georges. but It should still offer a spectacular, but different, experience to its patrons. Where they really dropped the ball was the dessert course. We all ordered coffees alongside our dessert, but the coffees came out halfway through our dessert course, which I thought was a strange and disruptive to the flow of the dessert course. Additionally, this was the ONLY time in my dining experience where the restaurant did not call or email me prior to confirm my reservation (but they do take your credit information to make the actual reservation itself for a big party). The food was solid. I ordered the warm beet salad, roasted hake, and Jean-Georges Warm Chocolate Cake. The beet salad was sweet and bright, with delicious pieces of hazelnut folded into rich yogurt sauce. I wished for a more flavorful (spicier?) kick, as the sweet beets against the rich yogurt was rather one note and I didn't feel that the beets were elevated in any way. The roasted hake was buttery tender with a beautiful crust with equally tender and flavorful pea shoots. The Jean-Georges Warm Chocolate Cake was good, with oozing chocolate and depth of flavor in the vanilla ice cream.Given how solid the food was, I debated rounding up to 4 stars. However, I cannot really justify the slow service, especially given that this is a highly esteemed restaurant.",5,1,3
70,Shauna N.,"Irvine, CA",156,82,102,5.0,1/24/2018,"I went here with my boyfriend for NYC Restaurant Week. We ordered off the $29 restaurant week prix fixe menu, but sat at the formal dining room. The space was beautifully elegant and had a very formal atmosphere. We had the sea trout sashimi, which was buttery yet crisp because of the lime. The flounder entree had an Asian take on it and was delicious. My boyfriend got the chicken entree which had both white and dark meat. Finally, the chocolate cake is to die for. It's served warm with a liquid chocolate filling and caramel ice cream which complemented the cake well. Overall, the restaurant was fantastic and easily the best restaurant week deal in NYC.",1,,

Updated review","All aspects are elegant and excellent at Nougatine: -- Wait staff is attractive, gracious & smart-- Food tastes marvelous and is artfully presented without being fussy The 3-course lunch Prix Fixe is a good bargain.My one request of Nougatine: Get rid of the rough grey plates and replace them with proper white china. Grey is an unattractive colour for food, and the rough texture makes an unpleasant noise if ones fork brushes the surface. I'm always eager for my next meal at Nougatine!",2,1,1
72,Michel K.,"Santa Barbara, CA",39,11,0,5.0,8/15/2018,"Nougatine st Jean-Georges in NYC;  Consistently Delicious With Excellent ServiceIf you are looking for a delicious meal with wonderful service at an extremely reasonable price (especially the three course price fixe lunch menu), then Nougatine at Jean-Georges on the south-west corner of Central Park should be st the top of your list.  Simple elegance, a beautiful view of the park, spaciousness, a sophisticated and interestingly diverse clientele, a great bar where you are pampered and made to feel very special, beautiful waitresses and handsome waiters, and delectable dishes to delight one's sense of taste,  smell, and sight.  Too many great dishes to mention them all, so let me highlight only a few.  The avocado and prawn salad with champagne vinaigrette is my to date favorite salad anywhere and any place.  The seared fois gras when available, always the case in the more formal and expensive main dining room, is both sublime and worth clotting one's arteries for, as well as being a bargain.  For starters, the calamari is crispy but not oily, the burger puts others to shame, the tuna tartare is so fresh and spicy, his soups are hearty and light, to mention only a few.  For entrees, his Zucca meatball so tasty with a wonderful texture, his Milanese veal make the Italians jealous, and his crusted chicken is crispy and refreshing.  All his dishes are all so clean that one leaves feeling energetic and fit.  The deserts are a wonderful end to a beautiful culinary experience whether it be a molten chocolate cake that oozes with flavor or a zesty sorbet.  The wines will satisfy the sommelier in you. If you want white instead of dark plates ask and say Myra told you to, one of his best and most demanding customers who also happens to be my mother.  If you are lucky Jean Georges May come out to greet and entertain you with his great smile and wit, or maybe his equally interesting brother Phillipe. In summary, if you want to experience NY at its culinary best and still have enough for cab fare home, feast at Nougatine st Jean Georges.  Your aspirations and expectations will be met and even exceeded.",,,
73,Nyceats W.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",1,20,12,2.0,6/17/2018,"Even though We had a 7:30 reservation, we got seated at 8:30! Although it was Father's Day It was unacceptable that they made us wait ONE HOUR. The service was very poor, I have come here many times and food typically moves rather quickly. Food was excellent other than my fish which was slightly over cooked. I suggest that if you come here make an early reservation. Waiters were nice! Be prepared at the end you get a nice peanut butter, jelly, chocolate surprise!!!! We like Jean Georges' restaurants and just booked his restaurant in London. Hope not to be disappointed.",1,,
74,Renee W.,"Hempstead, NY",217,35,4,5.0,7/26/2018,"I came here for lunch. The food was pretty good! I got the Calamari to start, the Pache for my main and the Chocolate lava cake for dessert.

75,Ray V.,"Purchase, NY",17,45,1,5.0,1/6/2018,"Another Jean-George's masterpiece.  Delicious, innovative flavors with beautiful presentation in the most elegant of settings.   I started with the tuna tartar, fresh with a bit of a kick and spin in the soy vinaigrette.  Delicious!  My main was the sea bass and it was the freshest I've ever had. I tasted my friends lobster which was divine. Love the shoestring pomme fris.  The wine was delicious and I ended up having an extra glass.  I didn't love the cocktails, I thought they were a little weak.  But I'm Irish. The view of the park and Columbus circle are the creme de resistance.  Highly recommend this romantic and yummy restaurant.",,,1
76,Doris H.,"Nice, France",216,21,45,5.0,3/7/2018,Out of my expectation. I love the flavor. It's very creative and I think it blends in some Asian flavors. I actually like this more than the Jean George's main dinning room. The beef short rib is excellent.,,,

I dislike wasting food but we did not need 2 tuna tartares. Speaking of which, it had a slight unpleasant fishy smell to it and the way it was cut up was butchered. I also had the tomato soup to start and it was the SALTIEST thing I've ever tasted! I had to pour water into it and it was still salty.. didn't even bother sending it back. Our entrées were fine but it was just any regular pasta dish. There was nothing Jean-George about it. It lacked finesse and detail, and most importantly, flavour. Very disappointed compared to my first experience dining in at Nougatine several years back. I will not be returning.",1,,1

80,Tiffany F.,"New York, NY",98,34,140,4.0,2/27/2018,"Amazing lunch a Nougatine! It's an upscale restaurant but simple enough to enjoy a delicious  lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  The food and drinks are well crafted in a tastefullly surprising way and there are several options off the pre-fixe or a la carte  menu.  From the Shrimp salad, the Veal Milanese to the Sea bass with sesame vinaigrette, nothing that off the menu could possibly disappoint you. And you can't end lunch or dinner without trying The passion fruit meringue dessert. Just wonderful!",,,
81,Jordan Jackson S.,"San Carlos, CA",196,17,35,3.0,2/9/2018,"I think this place might have been hyped up more than anything. I think the food was good, we went for brunch and the potatoes were excellent. However, everything else didn't seem to do it for me. Nothing on the menu screamed special, and this might just be because we went for brunch, but I was really hoping for more. One detail, that seemed to disappoint me was the fact that the servers were wearing really dirty clothes. I know it sounds silly, but with poor service it really set the wrong tone.",,,
82,Hannah C.,"Manhattan, NY",16,108,192,4.0,12/12/2016,"Nougatine is a great spot for lunch, brunch, or a casual dinner. Note that the restaurant is located inside Trump tower. Anyone working at the Trump tower will be able to point to you the correct location, so go inside and ask if you are lost.Nougatine were very accommodating as I had notified them 30 minutes prior to our reservation time that my friend was going to arrive 25 minutes late. After 20 minutes, they release the table to people without a reservation. Once my friend arrived, we were ushered to a table- only for the lovely concierge to apologize as the table had yet to be cleaned. Seems like there is some disconnect in communication between the front desk and the waiters inside. We waited approximately 10 minutes for them to clear a table. There is not much waiting space, there were groups of people huddled around the door and the bar area sticking out like a sore thumb.~ Food, Prix Fixe Lunch MenuThe bread and butter that is served is decent. Wish it was served warm...For appetizers, we ordered:- Tuna Tartare: Presented beautifully with sliced radishes, it looked like lotus flower. The ginger marinade was very flavorful, but I can see why people would complain about the marinade. It can be very overwhelming if you are not used that taste- I love Japanese cuisine and everything ginger so the tuna tartare really hit the spot.- Fried Calamari: The dip was whipped and airy, and the warm calamari was delicious.Main:- Seared Wild Hake (maple-celeriac puree, pink-peppercorn vinaigrette): Out of the three entrees we chose, the hake was the best dish. However, if you are hungry, the Black Bass would be the better dish to order if you want seafood.- Black Bass (habanero-lime sauce, roasted brussels sprouts): The brussels sprouts were tender and flavorful, and the bass was incredibly meaty. Probably the best seafood portion on Nougatine's menu.- Lobster Burger (gruyere, green chili mayonnaise, yuzu pickles): Came with these thin fries- the fries were delicious. Personally, the lobster burger tasted a bit like it was mixed with salmon. It tasted extremely ""fishy"" and in a very bad way. Unpleasant and not recommended.Dessert:- Cranberry Pavlova: The cranberry sorbet was too tart for me. I am sure that during other seasons, the pavlova is delicious but the cranberry was almost offensive. The pavlova part was delicious, with the soft marshmallow base and a crispy meringue crust. My friend liked it though, everyone's different so try it out if you want to try something new!- Jean-Georges Warm Chocolate Cake:Delicious and a safe choice, the warm chocolate cake and indeed, very warm, and oozes chocolate. Mix the vanilla ice cream with the chocolate cake to get the hot and cold sensation.~ ServiceThe waiters were incredibly helpful and kind. Waters were replenished quickly, as was bread when I asked for more. We did not feel rushed, and one waiter even took a picture of us and our lunch!~ ThoughtsNougatine is worth it for the prix fixe lunch, very good value. Don't get confused or expect the same level of service and food as Jean-Georges. Nougatine is NOT the one who has 3 Michelin stars or five stars from every single publication ever, and people who expect that from the more casual Nougatine will be severely disappointed and frankly, are misinformed. The dress code doesn't seem to be strictly enforced but wear business casual anyways.",,,
83,Mary P.,"Brooklyn, NY",584,1502,2549,3.0,8/24/2016,I want to like this place but there are a few negatives on my list about it.1. It's in trump tower.2. The clientele are sometimes pretentious.The food is decent. I mean I enjoyed what they sent me but it felt like dressed up food that I definitely paid a few extra dollars for. The calamari is good but I can get similar calamari for the same price point and more comes on the plate. I had a giant bowl of whipped sauce for the small amount of calamari they gave me. It was slightly confusing to dip these little calamari pieces in a soup bowl worth of sauce. I almost thought perhaps I should drink it like soup but they didn't give me a spoon.This is a dining for the dollar experience though where less is more and it's about quality.I had the beef tenderloin dish which was plated on a sauce that seemed like a tomato onion infusion. The beef was cooked well. There were crispy almost fritter like potatoes in the mix.The dessert is pretty good. The chocolate ginger cake is better than the peaches and pistachio ice cream but both taste very fresh.Overall the place is A-OK. I think I'd like brunch better.,2,1,
84,Cindy L.,"Parkland, FL",12,19,24,3.0,7/23/2017,Went here for lunch. I guess I was expecting more based off all the reviews. To start: The cucumber martini was amazing which I got at the bar and thank goodness because it took 20 minutes for our waiter to take a drink or food order. We never received bread although everyone around us did. We asked once our appetizers came out for bread which they eventually brought. The tuna tartare appetizer was very good. I would go back just for that. However my black bass and potato purée was lukewarm and nothing spectacular. It was too salty for my taste as well. My daughter had the calamari appetizer which was just okay. The calamari at Yolo in Fort Lauderdale blows this away. Maybe we chose poorly on our dishes. I just expected this to be a lot better.,,,
85,Rachel L.,"New York, NY",21,153,411,4.0,3/8/2017,"The star of my meal here was the appetizer - I picked the tuna tartare with avocado, spicy radish and ginger marinade. It was plated beautifully and I loved the complex flavors, especially the spicy kick from the chili oil on the radish ""petals""! I did not find the entrée choices terribly exciting and ended up picking the seared wild hake with maple-celeriac puree and pink-peppercorn vinaigrette. As for dessert, it was either Jean-Georges' warm chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream or a citrus pavlova. Went with the former - it was VERY decadent but because it was so rich and a tad bit sweet for me, I only managed to finish half! My friend who had a sweet tooth and loves chocolate finished this effortlessly though. :)Overall, the lunch prix fixe offers a great deal - it is very affordable at only $38 for an appetizer, entrée and dessert. While there were only 2 selections available for dessert, there was a sizeable offering for appetizer and entrée (about 6-8 choices each).P.S. belated review as I actually dined here in Oct 2016 (oops).",3,1,1
86,Kate K.,"New Brunswick, NJ",102,4,2,2.0,1/30/2018,"Wanted to try out their restaurant week menu. Was very disappointed.

87,E H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,8/3/2018,Maybe the chef takes a vacation during the restaurant week. Food was disappointing and the service sucked. They used canned peach for 'roasted' peach desert  and insisted they were freshly roasted. A French customer sitting in the next table agreed to me. Not that I need anybody's approval to know what it is. We discovered many good restaurants during restaurant weeks and keep going back. But definitely not this one.,1,,

The portions were quite generous and we left felling very satisfied. The highlights of my meal were the tuna tartare and chocolate lava cake. If you order off the regular menu, I would highly recommend those two dishes!! The tuna tartare was severed over avocado with a ginger sauce. I don't even like avocado and I was pleasantly surprised with this dish. The flavors complemented each other so well, I couldn't complain. The chocolate lava cake was also really good!! It was definitely superior to the other two desserts we sampled. It's so moist and the chocolate is so rich. I'm craving it as I write this review. Overall, five stars for a great birthday dinner. The staff even wrote a happy birthday note on my dessert!",3,3,2
89,Claudia B.,"Simi Valley, CA",1132,1290,6797,5.0,1/22/2017,"My daughter who lives in New York really likes Nougatine.  She recommended Nougatine at Jean-Georges to celebrate her sister / my younger daughter's birthday this year.  My younger daughter lives in L.A. as do my husband and I, and we flew 3,000 miles from home to do this.  I'm so glad we did.  What a delightful experience.  The food was excellent, and we wanted for nothing.  Our waiter was excellent, and while not at all overbearing, he was there to wait on our every need.  While we all had the dinner tasting menu, he very kindly offered us substitutions for the things we either didn't like (foie gras) or didn't eat (I don't eat pork).  Instead of the foie gras, we all substituted that for their shrimp salad, and instead of the pork, I had the black sea bass instead.  There was so much food, such large portions of each course, and it was all delicious.  Flavor and freshness was top notch....esp. the flavor.We started with an amuse bouche of I don't know what.  I never quite heard what the waiter said, and I even asked him to repeat it, but it was FABULOUS...... I just don't know what it was (sorry).  It was like a crab cake (and maybe it was) with some kind of creamy sauce.  All I can say with certainty is that it was delicious, and I wanted more than the one.We then moved on to the Tuna Tartare, which had avocado, spicy radish, in a ginger marinade.  There was something like pureed tomato in the sauce, at least I thought so.  All I know is that it was so wonderful.  I loved the refreshing, yet bold flavors.  I'm not usually a ginger fan, but it was not overpowering, and we all devoured this dish.Next, instead of foie gras, we were offered the substitution of a shrimp salad.  My daughter kept raving about their shrimp salad.  I have to say, it was THE BEST I've ever had.  The dressing, some kind of champagne vinegar dressing just hit this dish out of the ballpark.  It was creamy but not heavy, just so delicious.  The shrimp was on a bed of lettuce with avocado and tomato.  Perfection. Truly.The next dish was a Sesame Crusted Salmon that was served with sautéed potatoes, black olive, spinach and passion fruit.  I honestly don't recall tasting any passion fruit, but once again, whatever I ate, was so flavorful.  You know, now that I think back, the sauce had a sweetness to it, so I'm wondering if the passion fruit was pureed into the sauce.  I don't really know...... it just tasted excellent.  The salmon was, of course, perfectly cooked, and I'd expect nothing less from a restaurant of this caliber.While everyone else at our table ate the Niman Ranch pork chop with bacon, apple compote, and cauliflower (and loved it), I was given Black Bass in a habanero-lime sauce with roasted Brussels sprouts.  The Brussels sprouts were the tiniest I've ever seen, and they were sooooo good........ one would think something that small would have no flavor, but they were soooo delish.  However, my fish (Black bass) was sooooooooooooooooooo salty; I think a mistake was made, and someone salted it too much.  The waiter very graciously wanted to have another piece prepared for me, but I told him no way.  I was really full, and there was no point (esp. since I wouldn't be eating it at any other time).  I truly was fine without it.  He was so apologetic. For dessert, we received the following:Citrus Pavlova with Blood Orange Sorbet and Candied CumquatsButterscotch Pudding with Crème Fraîche, Sea Salt & CaramelJean Georges' Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Chocolate ShortbreadFor me, it's a tie what was my favorite...... either the citrus pavlova, so different, refreshing and lovely........ or the butterscotch pudding.  Such different flavors, but I STILL can't make up my mind...... just sooooooooo good.  Sure the chocolate cake was fabulous, but the other two items had such unique flavors.If this is a far more casual version of Jean-Georges, I can't wait to see what that restaurant (in the very next room) has to offer.  I just need to win the lottery for that one.  We'll be back, though.  I loved Nougatine.  My only bug-a-boo about this place is that its location is in the Trump International Tower.  Sure, a GREAT location....... and yet, NOT.  Consider the source.  Boooooooooo.  Okay, enough about that.  Try Nougatine.  Truly delightful.",9,7,7

Updated review","The name threw me off. I've only eaten at Jean-Georges (which is connected to this one) and not Nougatine. But that's not all of it. The girlfriend who made the reservation forwarded me the open table reservation and it says One Central Park West. I am on Central Park South. It's a 5 minute walk. How could things go wrong? Well? The Jean-Georges I ate at is of the same address. I was therefore confused, for one. For two, it shares the same address as the Trump Tower, and let me be clear, it's actually part of the Trump Tower, and being that I'm from the liberal land of San Francisco bay Area, imagine my surprise when I realized 1 Central Park West is synonymous to Trump Tower, but no one wants to just tell me that. Geez. That was a lot of work and unnecessary stress because those machine gun carrying police was not there to guard that building but the Christmas Market which is across from the restaurant. Berlin Christmas Market ripple effect. But I persevered. Everyone knows that I'm not there to see Trump. I'm there to eat. Which is exactly what I told to the lobby guard and they sent me left through the glass door.Once inside,  life was wonderful once again. You cannot go wrong with any JGs. Prix Fixe is a steal at $38. Appetizer, Entree and dessert. Note JG is a three Michelin. A three Michelin means $1400 for two in the Bay Area after wine pairing. My girlfriend ordered off the regular menu and her dishes were bigger but that's to be expected. I think the prix fixe was quite generous in size. I had the tuna tartare and hake. Both were work of art with amazing taste and presentation. Perfect in fact. I then shared the gluten free dessert with my girlfriend as I stole bunch of the mushroom off her steak plate which was the best mushroom I had ever had in my life. I think I need to learn to make mushroom that way. I've eaten at too many Michelin 3, 2 and 1 star places in New York, the most approachable place to me remains to JGs. Not only the service is impeccable, but also they understood their customers. My girlfriend is gluten free and when she said no to delicious bread they immediately offered her gluten free bread. See, not everything affiliated with Trump is bad, this restaurant breathes a sense of relief to fellow San Franciscans travelers. It certainly is a fail safe for me. I'll return, again and again.",5,4,4

Updated review","Came here recently with a group of 4 to try their lunch prix fixe menu. We had made reservations and we were immediately seated upon arrival. The restaurant is in the Trump Tower. They don't have a big name sign out in front so you can easily miss it.I ordered the shrimp salad, crispy black sea bass, and pavlova for dessert. I was able to try the tuna tartare, cheeseburger, roasted hake, and warm chocolate cake.Overall, my favorite dish was the cheeseburger. The meat was super flavorful. I think they add something to the beef before making it into a patty. The yuzu pickles added a different level of flavor profile that really complemented the other components of the burger. One issue I had was the bun. I thought there were too many sesame seeds and there could have been a better choice in bun used for the dish. Despite that, this is an excellent dish and worth the $38 prix fixe.I thought the tuna tartare and shrimp salad were good but nothing out of the extra ordinary. Everything was fairly spot on. I thought the shrimps were over cooked. They were dishes that work and they are very consistent at making these dishes excellent every time. The hake is definitely a meatier fish than the sea bass. Both were great dishes. There wasn't a fishy taste/smell to them. The skin on the sea bass was crispy and not soggy at all. I thought the cauliflower taste wasn't strong enough and overpowered by the other ingredients. Hats go off to the pastry chef that made the pavlova. It was super soft and light. It was contained in this crispy sugar shell (i don't know the fancy name for it) but everything was in harmony for this dish. The choice of sorbet matched the pavlova and the strawberries were fresh and sweet. To me, I thought this was a more complicated dish to make when compared to the chocolate cake. However, the chocolate cake was amazing as well. The chocolate literally oozed out of the cake once you cut into it. The cake was still warm when they brought it out. The cake was so soft and the chocolate was super rich. I initially the cake would be harder that it looked but boy was I surprised. Both were so delicious.The decor is really nice. The place is spacious with tons of natural sunlight. Everything is ""bright"" inside.Overall, great restaurant, definitely worth coming here for the prix fixe. Both of his restaurants are right next to each other and the food come out from the same kitchen. I just wonder if they have a different chef for the dinner menu. I'll come back here for dinner at Jean Georges to see if it's worth it. My suspicion is that you're getting the same chef that cooks for both restaurants. If that's the case, just go to Nougatine to get excellent food at a lower price point.",,,
99,Becky L.,"New York, NY",220,274,1256,5.0,1/4/2016,The restaurant is located in the Trump International Hotel (entrance across from Central Park). Walk in and speak to someone at the desk and he/she will direct you to the left for Nougatine or to the right for Jean George. You can have your coat checked. Nougatine is classy but more casual. Men do not have to wear a jacket or a tie. Some men wore sweaters and some wore dress shirts.Service was amazing. The two servers were attentive. They refilled our coffee and water when our cups were running low. Polite and professional. The main server always addressed us with a smile and good eye contact. Food:Tuna Tartare (2.5/5.0) - The fish was drowning in the pool of ginger sauce. The boldness of the sauce took focus away from the tuna. The dish was beautifully plated.Black Sea Bass (5.0/5.0) - The fish was cooked perfectly. The fish flaked off easily. The mustard sauce was a good contrast to the subtlety of the fish. Vegetables were good too. Chocolate Lava Cake (5.0/5.0) - Amazing.,5,,

101,Jake M.,"Washington, DC",2,98,16,5.0,7/25/2018,"Jean-Georges on Columbus Circle is a welcoming, sophisticated find on the edge of Hells Kitchen and the Upper West Side. Sitting in the basement of the Trump International hotel, Jean-George's serves modern cuisine with classical French technique. Diners can either sit on the side of the dining room overlooking the kitchen or on the other side of the French doors leading to the terrace, which itself looks over Central Park. To start, I had the gazpacho. A bowl with raspberries, herbs, and chopped tomatoes was brought to the table by the graceful staff. A waiter-soldier poured the fruity, chunky gazpacho over the garnish to provide for a gazpacho combining smoothness and chunkiness. Next, we ordered the calamari. The squid pieces were perfectly cooked and crispy and were served with a champagne vinegar-based sauce that balanced the saltiness of the fried calamari. Jean-Georges' only mistake in the first part of the meal was the bread. While the multigrain loaf itself was fine, it wasn't warmed and was served with chilled, difficult-to-spread butter, not exactly what one has in mind for a top restaurant. I also tried some of Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's famous shrimp salad. The salad is large, and the greens, tomatoes, and other assorted vegetables are dressed in a vinaigrette, while the warm prawns themselves are dressed in a champagne beurre blanc sauce. An amuse bouche of delicious ginger cucumber coconut soup was served somewhat awkwardly right as our appetizers were arriving, not before all the food or between courses as typically served. For my main course, I ordered the crispy Maine lobster. Large pieces of Maine lobster are fried in a mixture of potato starch and oil, compared, interestingly given the Asian (Thai) influences on Vongerichten's cooking, to Japanese tempura. The lobster itself was served over a bed of butter-sautéed cabbage and garnished with a pico de gallo of herbs, tomatoes, and ginger (again, Asian influences). For its price, the Maine lobster was a good deal and was surely delicious. Others I know ordered the steamed black sea bass and the lobster burger. The lobster, for those wondering, is not 24-karat lobster (and I mean karat, not carat, as in the purity of gold alloy, not the mass of a jewel), but rather a mixture of herbs, spices, lobster, and shrimp to bind it all together. It is served with shoestring French fries, a rarity in nouvelle cuisine restaurants. To finish, I ordered Vongerichten's famous warm chocolate cake: a chocolate dome filled with smooth semi-sweet chocolate ganache. On the side, vanilla bean ice cream and, since it was my birthday, a candle and the words ""happy birthday!"" spelled in hardened white chocolate were served. I recommend that you visit Jean-Georges no matter what you're doing... you'll be in for a treat!",,,
102,Jon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,125,310,5.0,10/7/2017,"Awesome experience. The salmon crisp with spicy mayo and mint leaves (forgot the menu name) appetizer was complex and delicious on levels I can't even explain. 15-30 seconds into the bite size piece you're still revealing new flavors and it's just literally unbelievable. The service was incredible, it's attached to the 3 Michelin star restaurant Jean Georges so you're getting a slightly toned down version of there. Prices were high but nothing outrageous, considering the food was top top. Although I came as a one time experience based on a recommendation of a friend, I'll definitely keep coming back because the menu had so much to offer and I didn't even scratch the surface of trying it all.

For Appetizers, both dishes were incredibly fresh and reminiscent of our Blue Hill experience. I'm not a salad person. I usually actively avoid salads since I think they're lazy. But both the tomato salad and the squash were very good! It tasted like it was just picked from a garden outside - the ingredients were fresh and tasty (and that's coming from someone who typically doesn't like salads!).1. Summer's Squash and Arugula Salad 2. Heirloom Tomatoes with BasilFor Entrees, the chicken was the star. It was probably the best chicken I've had. It was so tender and tasted almost pork-like in how juicy it was. This is what chicken should taste like! I also really enjoyed the salmon. But unfortunately, baked salmon is never as juicy and tender as poached salmon (We had the poached salmon at Aureole for RW Winter 2015 - so incredible!). Both entrees were fantastic and well worth the Restaurant Week price - highly recommend.1. Salmon Baked with Lemon Crumbs and Sweet Chili Glaze and Swiss Chard2. Free Range Chicken with Summer Radish Salad and Cucumber EmulsionFor Dessert, I really enjoyed the chocolate cake and my dining companion preferred the Parfait. Overall, both were good choices. The cake was what you'd expect of a good lava cake. The right consistency outside and gooey lava on the inside. The compote is less heavy and more of a cleaner option.1. Jean-Georges Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream2.

Ok, not that big of a deal but not what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant. Then he will have zero personality and not make you feel welcome. He will take your order. And then deliver the food to the wrong people and then look offended when you start switching plates around so each person has their respective order in front of them. The food was definitely good, but nothing to really write home about. If you're at a place with such high esteem, you'd expect food you'd want to tell everyone about.

Appetizers appeared relatively quickly--butternut squash soup was sweet, creamy and full of heart wintery flavors--and then we waited. And waited. And waited. People who arrived after us were served. Requests to our waiter and the manager were answered with assurances that our food was on the way had ""had already been plated."" The orders didn't appear. We let them know we wouldn't have time for desert. Still nothing. Finally the food appeared. Salmon crusted with poppy seeds was good but not great--likely flash frozen (which is not bad...better actually than day old fresh)--without the fresh notes you'd typically get from really good salmon. The waiter then delivered our check. No apology for bad service... just for it taking a long time. Nothing comped. (Not even a cup of coffee.)

We arrived on time and had to wait a short time before we were seated. The restaurant reminded me of an older traditional classy room. The colors were soft and the staff were amazing regarding customer service. I remember looking up and always seeing staff looking around to be available for guests. For my entrée, I had the Greek salad that tasted weird and had this sour taste that I kept saying omg what is in this? Duh, I was eating the olives that I don't like so once I got rid of them I was able to enjoy the rest of my salad. I remember at one point one of the waiters, Brian came over to ask if I was okay because of the face I made from the olives. He asked if I wanted to change my salad and I said no thank you and he was insistent it wouldn't be a problem which was very considerate.  I had the chicken for my entrée and it was good, you really can't mess up chicken, wait that's not true but the chicken here was moist and tasty.

After 10 minutes, we had not been offered a drink of any type, nor had we been seen to by service staff or offered a menu. We were then asked what our water preference was, and were provided with a food menu. Alas still no offer of a drink!When the water arrived, I requested a wine/cocktail list. Another 15 minutes elapsed, and by this time, we had been seated for 25 minutes, and we're still to receive a drink list. It was at this point, that we rose and departed the restaurant.A thoroughly disappointing experience. As we collected a bag from the front reservation desk, I mentioned our experience to the front desk operator, who casually said he would pass on the feedback to his manager. A number of other patrons were requesting the check, dessert, their drinks etc multiple times and there was clearly an issue with service or lack-thereof on the evening. The terrace seemed to have limited staff, whereas inside Nougatine, there appeared to be no issue with staffing.We expected far better, and were genuinely excited.  Sadly after this experience, we won't be back.",,,

120,Paige K.,"Washington, DC",546,172,5,4.0,9/13/2016,"Nougatine was delicious, a really wonderful lunch. I will say that nothing was the most delicious thing I ever had and I don't know if I'd come back for anything, but it was still a fantastic meal. I started with the tomato gazpacho and my boyfriend had the shrimp salad. I think the shrimp salad was better, just much brighter flavors and a wonderful dressing. The gazpacho was pretty one-note and I could not finish it. For entrees, I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the chicken. I think the salmon was so great, perfectly cooked. However, the potato puree and sauce seemed unnecessary on the plate. The sauce overpowered everything when combined, so I didn't love that, especially since I love potatoes just by themselves a lot of the time (and the potato puree was good by itself!). My boyfriend's chicken was a little crispy for me, but it was also good.Then, for dessert, I had the pavlova and my boyfriend had the chocolate cake and ice cream. I thought the pavlova was excellent. There was great fresh fruit and all of the flavors were so light and enjoyable. We ended up only trading bites on this dish because we both enjoyed our own so much.This was also a cheaper option than eating at Jean-Georges and also the cheapest experience we found eating at the lounges/salons/bars/patios of the 3-Star restaurants. The outside deck is very pleasant and hidden from the street, so it feels like you're in a great garden when you're really right on Columbus Circle!",2,,

Updated review","Restaurant week lunch.Both appetizer options (tomato gazpacho and arugula + radish salad) needed more work and refinement, but my entree was delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the unlikely combination of shiitake and artichoke paired really well together. I really wish they had given us more options for dessert, because the signature warm chocolate cake is offered every single year and honestly I would take Domino's chocolate lava cake (or Spot's if we're going local) over JG's any day. I opted for the only other choice - blueberry pound cake. It was quite well executed. The corn ice cream was a nice surprise. But the pastry itself was on the dry side and the fruits on the side did not add anything to the dish.Service was nice but extremely slow. I'd say skip RW menu and come for the $38 prix fixe.",3,,

Not crazy expensive either for a gourmet meal. The trout crispy rice was insanely good- you get 4 pieces. The kale salad was also very good- very finely chopped kale with sprinkles of onions and a delicious light Caesar type dressing. Entrees around the table were a pasta dish which included Brussel sprouts (very savory), the salmon and the sea bass, and we got an order of the scallops to share. All of the food was amazing- not one complaint. It was all very very savory, until we got to the dessert. The chocolate cake is a must! Cake outside and once you cut into it molten lava chocolate streams out. The menu is so good- the wine list too. No complaints here, kudos to the staff and restaurant for making you feel fancy in a casual dining setting.",,,

Updated review","I love this place! Came here during restaurant week and $38 dinner was a great deal. I heard their brunch is also priced reasonably. So reckoned to you if you have to give it a shot but tight on budget.Nougatine is just nectar-door to 3-star Jean George. The environment is not as good as JG, since Yu cannot see the outside from most seats. Service is also not the same but is still much better than average. (I think JG offered the best service I have experienced so far.... Maybe was only worse than GW Fins in New Orleans.....)  I like the food here.

Nougatine is just a fair restaurant with big league prices. The wine list is extensive, but only affordable if someone else is buying. Definitely expense account only. It's interesting that every item we ordered turned out to be foods that other neighborhood restaurants do much better. I had split pea soup that was pretty good vs. the same at Bar Boulud which is outstanding. My wife's pricey hamburger was fair vs. The Smith's which is superb. I'll leave it at that. I can't think of any reason to eat at Nougatine unless someone else is paying. Even then, you will wish you went somewhere else.",2,,

The ramp that divides the restaurant in half and leads up to the actual Jean-Georges, offers good entertainment in the form of well dressed diners sashaying down it toward the better restaurant. You might also catch celeb sightings if you come for dinner.Wine list is extensive, but definitely pricey.PS: the mango feta salad, the pea soup, and the warm chocolate cake are the better dishes.",1,,
131,David L.,"Los Gatos, CA",102,689,76,4.0,6/11/2016,"I would say probably closer to 4.5 stars. Some of the dishes are out of this world. The sweat pea soup with croutons is amazing! What bright, fresh, verdant flavor. Yes...you can literally taste the green. Shrimp salad is also solid, but a little over dressed. Shrimp was cooked perfectly, delicate and warm.For mains, the slow cooked salmon is off the hook good. It must have been sous-vide, it literally dissolves in your mouth. It's amazing and maybe the best salmon i've ever had. The pork chop though was a bit of a disappointment. Surprisingly it was bland and really nothing special about it at all and for a $38 pork chop with some mustard greens and BBQ sauce, I expected something pretty outrageously good. BBQ sauce was nicely flavored, but even the mustard greens had some very woody stems that i couldn't chew. So definitely get the salmon, i wished I did.For dessert, the signature warm chocolate cake definitely does not disappoint. The warm peach pie was fantastic as well. A very light crust, served warm all the way through with a little ice cream. The fruit was also fresh, light and sweet. Perfectly cooked.Service is also top notch as you would expect. They do a real nice job of taking care of you and making a show of it. A really great option especially before a show up in Lincoln Center.",2,,

Updated review","Visited this place on a Friday night for dinner, and my experience was lackluster. It was restaurant week so I opted for the pre-fix deal. Appetizer was a trout sashimi which was good but very small. Main course was flounder with spaghetti squash and a miso sauce, and it was extremely bland. Dessert, however, was really good - I got the citrus pavlova and would recommend it. Service was kind of all over the place, at points I felt like we were being rushed and other times the waiter didn't know what was going on. Overall an OK experience but probably not worth the $.",,,

Service was not good - different servers kept hitting the back of my chair and my husband's. Food didn't taste as good as before - the shrimp was not cleaned and still had shell and black mud/poop in it, fish was way too salty and had too much ginger in the sauce. The dessert was okay. I guess it was because of the Christmas/ holiday rush, but it just felt the restaurant standards have gone down a lot... I wonder if that's why Jean-George's lost one star for 2018 Michelin rating. We have always liked this restaurant and hopefully it'd restore the standards soon.",,,

Also, I loved the fresh flower they put on the table. Everyone is so hard at work and there is such an abundance of attention to detail at this sort of place. You can easily go to a diner around the corner and get similar food for breakfast at a fraction of the cost. However, one does not come here to simply eat food.

I went right when they opened at 11:30/11:45am on President's Day and snagged a seat. 5 minutes later, every seat at the bar was filled as were most of the regular dining tables.Almost everyone at the bar ordered from the RW menu:jean-georgesrestaurant.c…We ordered everything on the menu (see pictures) but here are the most notable/recommended:1) Tomato and cheddar soup with crispy sourdough - Buttery and delicious. Once you're done with the crispy sourdough, don't be afraid to ask for more servings of the bread they give you before your meal and give it a generous dip. My favorite out of all the RW dishes.2) Organic roasted chicken - cooked to perfection, juicy and tender. Although it was a bit too salty for my taste. My 2nd favorite of all the RW dishes.3) Wild gulf flounder with spaghetti squash - definitely fresh, but not a huge fan of the soy yuzu broth/sauce.. this could've been done better. They do give a lot of fish though.The desserts were nothing special. But out of the two choices (molten chocolate cake and eclair), I'd recommend the eclair (although overly sweet) just because it's more unique..Portions were overall very generous and I was full (uh..

We were excited for our day and Nougatine was the starting point.When we stepped through the door, we were greeted with one of those fake smiling, I'm too good to work here and you're not good enough to eat here hostess. To add to that, their system of checking people in and checking coats was a bit confusing. She took our name and asked us to stand to the side until our name was called. But we were never informed if we could check our coats. We had to figure it out for ourselves that the coat check was off to the right. Be aware that Nougatine and Jean-Georges share the same hostess table. It was a bit weird to see so many people standing there waiting to be seated when Jean-Georges is such a high class restaurant. I'm sure everyone had reservations.After about 10-15 minutes past our reservation time, we were seated. The restaurant is connected to Jean-Georges, so if you have some kind of inferiority complex, this is not the restaurant for you. But the food comes from the kitchen and a lot of the same dishes are served in both restaurants.We had the pre-fixe and I ordered the shrimp salad for appetizer, lobster burger for entree, and chocolate cake for dessert. Shrimp salad was fine, salad was just a salad, nothing special. Not much shrimp on it, which was expected. The lobster burger was good, but again, nothing special. I've never had a lobster burger before (I think) but it pretty much tasted like a crab cake, except with lobster instead of crab, stuck between two pieces of bread. Eh.

And if you're paying top notch dollar, shouldn't you be dinning with table cloths?  Nope, it's okay, I had paper table setting.  Oh and the bathrooms aren't even in the dinning area.  One restroom ran out of toilet paper.  Okay now I'm ranting but all true. Does Jean-George himself care?  Does management care?  Does anyone care about the dinners that go on during restaurant week?  Most probably not cause they know guests probably are one-timers.  They KNOW, patrons that go during restaurant week will not be returning so they take your money and laugh their ass to the bank.  Will I return?  Heck no.  If I had a great experience, would I return, of course!  Due to the reputation of this place, I expected a lot more and for this high caliber of an establish to rip good paying customers off is really something.  It's really embarrassing.  And what part of any of this was French?!  Wow ...

Joining a devoted army of New York foodies during restaurant month, I have say that Jean-Georges is undoubtedly the best one my boyfriend and I have tried- 5 stars well deserved! First of all, the ambiance of the restaurant is so elegant and serene, making you feel comfortable dining and wining there all day long. Making a reservation in advance is highly recommended if you are trying to make your way to splurge in what the restaurant has to offer during restaurant month. To start off the $42 prix dinner during restaurant week was the Arugula salad, I ordered salmon for the entree and hot chocolate cake as dessert. I need to scream out how good the salmon tasted because of its tender texture (medium rare) and special mixed coconut sauce complementing it. Hands down one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had at a restaurant!!! Salad was fresh and flavorful just as expected. Dessert was da BOMB- with hot chocolate immediately flowing out as you cut it. Last but not the least, I LOVE the staff here at Jean-Georges; they are super polite and friendly!

We decided to share two appetizers and two entrees. I ordered the Burrata (Poached Mission Fig Vinaigrette and Arugula) and she ordered the Crab Cake (black pepper, Asian Pear, and Endive.) We each ate half then switched plates. The Buratta was amazing. It was soft on the inside and the fig vinaigrette gave it just the right amount of acid and sweetness. The best component of the crab cake plate was the black pepper sauce that sat next to it. It packed a sweet and peppery punch. For the entrees I ordered the Spaghetti (with Brussels Sprouts and Pistachio Pesto) and my friend ordered the Veal Milanese (with Parmesan, Escarole, and Lemon.) The Spaghetti was DELICIOUS. This was by far my favorite of the four dishes. The spaghetti was al dente, the Brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked, and the pistachio pesto was everything I wanted and more. It was so flavorful.

Now here comes the best part and that was the food, I ordered the tuna tartare which is a must, then the veal milanese and for dessert we had the caramelized apple pie! The tuna tartare was delicious! It was on top of really fresh avocados and the tartness and spice from the ginger soup that they poured in after serving the dish to you complimented so well the the avocado and the tuna tartare and the radish that were neatly placed on top. All the flavors were done with such finesse and just worked well together like a melodyNext was the veal milanese this dish was also tart but in a good way where it mixed well with the cooked cranberries and the thin piece of meat that had a great crispness to it where it was oily at all! Meat thats usually coated with like bread crumbs or other things tends to fry and burn too quickly but this one was cooked and pan fried perfectly with a golden crust and easy to cut. This veal was placed on top of a bed of salad as well  Everytime they served the food they would describe what your eating and I think that added to the experience cause you can understand what your actually tasting which I loved! For dessert since it was my birthday they added a little happy birthday note and gave me a candle and that was thoughtful of the restaurant and this is how you know they take care of their customers and make sure that the experience they have is everlasting and great! They even gave complimentary chocolate truffles and I am usually not a fan of truffles because of the texture but the taste of this truffle just melted in your mouth. I loved it here and definitely will go back again!",1,1,1
153,Cindy G.,"New York, NY",883,399,423,4.0,6/13/2016,"You enter both Nougatine at Jean Georges and the regular Jean Georges at the same entrance (located right inside the very hard to miss Trump Towers...), so don't be confused if you think you're accidentally walking into the Michelin 3-star restaurant rather than the more casual one for lunch. Both share the same drinks menu and the same kitchen, so this is a great option if you're looking to experience the world of Jean Georges without breaking the wallet. The ambiance was great. We were seated in the outdoor patio area, which could not have been more perfect for a 80-degree sunny Sunday. The tables are spacious, and the space between each table was ample. At no point did I feel overcrowded.Our group of 4 all chose to do the 3-course prie fixe for $38. After listening to the waiter's enthusiastic recommendations, I decided to go with the shrimp and avocado appetizer, the seared sea bass with tomato sauce for my main, and the strawberry pavlova for my dessert. Albeit a bit simple (so simple that I think I could whip this up at home), I thought the shrimp and avocado salad appetizer and the sea bass entree were both delicious. The dishes were light and refreshing, and the ingredients were very fresh. My sea bass was the perfect level of tenderness. If you like heavy flavors, these are probably not the right dishes to order, but if you like ingredients that speak for themselves without needing to hide behind a ton of spice, this is great. On the other hand, I completely regretted ordering the strawberry pavlova. It was far too sweet for my taste. I happily ate the strawberry and sorbet on the side but almost cringed at the taste of cream. Though the pavlova was disappointing, I luckily did get bites of the warm chocolate lava cake, which is by far the much better option, so definitely order that for your dessert!Because of the simple nature of the food here, I don't really see this as a place I would die to go back to. However, if I am ever looking for a place to bring parents or older folks to for a wholesome lunch with a nice ambiance, Nougatine would definitely be on the list.",,,

The name isn't visible from the outside so it's a bit hard to spot but once inside, we were promptly taken to the bar area. We can't speak for the food because we only came for drinks. The menu has wines, sparkling and classic cocktails to meet anyone's taste.The JG 57, Paloma, Aviator, and Cucumber martini were delicious and strong. Nougatine isn't innovative with their cocktail presentation but they are well executed. The mixed drinks are around $18. The staff is professional yet somewhat aloof and the the restaurant has a minimalistic/modern decor.",3,1,1

The tuna stack was served over a bed of avocado. Once the dish is served in front of you they pour in the ginger marinade.

156,Pearl K.,"Saddle River, NJ",546,164,128,5.0,3/13/2015,"I came to Nougatine for a work dinner; our reservation was for 5:30, but apparently they don't start seating until 5:45. We waited at the bar for a little before they led us over to our table, which was right by the door. If you ever get seated there, try to request a different table, because every time the door would open, the cold air would sweep over our table. By the end of the meal, I had my coat back on. I can imagine how uncomfortable the table would be in the middle of winter.We received a complimentary amuse-bouche of parsnip soup topped with a crumbled crouton to begin with. The crouton gave the tiny soup a great crunch, but the soup itself is definitely an acquired taste.We started with 3 appetizers to share: the tuna tartare, the shrimp salad, and the calamari. All of them were extremely delicious and I highly recommend them all!For my main meal, I got the slowly-cooked salmon over spinach and potato crisps. It came out medium rare and beautifully-plated. There's a very good balance to the dish; the sweet sauce and the spinach go well together while the potatoes provide the salmon with a little bit of salt. I was extremely disappointed by how full I was; I didn't get to finish this amazing meal.For dessert, we got the chocolate cake and the butterscotch pudding. Both were delicious, but I suggest you eat the pudding carefully; it's topped with cream and salt. I made the mistake of taking a spoonful of only the cream and salt and my mouth screwed up from the extreme saltiness.Service was great; there was always someone ready to refill our glasses, clear plates, and answer questions.Nougatine was an amazing experience and I really can't wait to come back and try some more of their options!",1,,
157,Idy T.,"Boston, MA",415,392,2167,3.0,12/3/2014,"I had high expectations before dining at Nougatine at Jean-Georges. My experience was short from what I expected, which is why I am giving this a whopping 3 stars.I made reservations for the day of my visit. I was a little let for my reservation but I ended up waiting 20-30 minutes for my table. The hostess insisted I wait in the waiting area outside. It was mid 30 degrees weather. Although the waiting area was indoors, every time someone opens the door to go out, a gust of freezing cold breeze blows towards me. This is a bad set up for patrons, especially for a restaurant like this. Finally, I was seated! I ordered from the prix fixe menu which was 3 courses for $38. This is such a great pricing, especially because I am getting the Jean-Georges experience. The environment of the restaurant is really nice. It is part of the Trump Hotel and right across from the Central Park. So you get a great view if you are seated by the window. The complimentary bread that I was served was sad and boring. It was a cold and hard, which reminded me about my experience waiting in the cold to be seated! Also, I expected the butter that was served with the bread to be room temperature or whipped, but nope it was cold and hard as a rock! There was no way I could spread the butter on my bread. For my first course, I ordered the tuna tartare with avocado, spicy radish, and ginger marinade. The ginger marinade was way too acidic. I was puckering my lips every time I took a bite of my tuna tartare. Just talking about this is making me salivating to the max.For my second course, I ordered the caramelized hake with broccoli and ginger-chili vinaigrette. The hake was cooked perfectly. However the ginger chili vinaigrette was a little too citrusy for me. I expected more of a ginger spice vinaigrette but I ended up with a vinaigrette that tasted like fresh orange zest was blended in the sauce. Not really the flavors I look for in a savory seafood dish. This entree is served with ginger rice on the side. The rice was flavored well but it was underdone. The rice was hard and if I had more of it, it would have caused indigestion for me. For dessert, I ordered the Jean-Georges warm chocolate cake with vanilla cream. The dessert was probably the highlight of my meal. The warm molten cake was made perfectly. It was a great pair with the cold vanilla bean ice cream. It was like a match made in heaven! Overall, it was a good one time experience. Maybe it was because I went the the Nougatine at Jean-Georges instead of the actually Jean-Georges.",5,5,5

Updated review","Definitely one of the best restaurant you can find in the United States. I haven't yet figure out the differences between this one and the Jean-Georges, but this one is no worse than the other one IMO. The price is reasonable, which is not as high as I expect it to be. The service is world class, the food is fine and delicious.Dinning in here is definitely going to be a memorable experience for everyone. Make sure you reserve your space before you walk in, bc they prob don't want their elegant space to be crowded.Definitely recommending this place to everyone. Btw, Their tea with milk is fantastic, best I've ever have.",,,

162,Melissa G.,"New York, NY",23,206,98,5.0,1/22/2016,"Came here with a foodie friend for restaurant week lunch. We arrived for our reservation at 2:45, but still had to wait a bit due to the higher volume of customers during restaurant week. However, as others have mentioned, the service is amazing. The environment in and of itself is an experience. Meal started with delicious sourdough bread, although I wish it had been served warm. There are two options for the appetizer, entree, and dessert, which was perfect. We got one of each and split everything. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't prefer any option over the other. The appetizer tomato and cheddar soup was divine with a soft-yet-crispy-on-the-outside piece of parmesan bread. Although I'm normally not a fan of sashimi, the sea trout sashimi appetizer was perfect - no hint of a fishy flavor, and it had a tiny kick with the mint and lime. The flounder entree kept up the high standard set by the appetizers. Crispy on the outside, flaky and buttery on the inside. Served atop a bed of butternut squash, and sprinkled with pumpkin seeds. The ensemble is a masterpiece. The roasted chicken was equally as amazing, accompanied with broccoli, yogurt sauce, and breadcrumbs for dipping. Fun and delicious to eat.Dessert did not disappoint. Classic lava cake - rich, gooey, and served with magical Madagascar vanilla ice cream. The subtler almond cake with citrus sorbet provided a good balance. The cake was dense and moist, and the sorbet was just the right amount of tart. I had not been expecting too much from this lunch, as the menu items had appeared rather plain when I previewed the restaurant week menu. Although the dishes are simple - ie broccoli and chicken - they are cooked and presented to perfection and the flavors meld divinely.",1,,
163,Amy H.,"New York, NY",20,62,14,2.0,7/15/2018,"Came with my husband for a dinner reservation at 8:30 pm on a Saturday night. Sat on the terrace, which was only about 1/4 way full. We each ordered a glass of wine almost immediately after sitting down and then waited a good 10 mins before our waiter came back for our food order at which time we ordered an app to share and entree each. Our glasses of wine didn't arrive until partway through the appetizer and when my food finally came (roasted chicken), one of the two breasts was so overcooked I couldn't eat it. The second chicken breast was outstanding as was my husband's sea bass. Our waiter and the manager on duty hardly checked on us and certainly didn't apologize for the late drinks or even check on us after our meals arrived to know that my chicken wasn't edible. When the busser finally came at the very end, he asked how the chicken was because he saw was 1/2 was uneaten, I told him, and only then did the manager come by an apologize and said she'd take the drinks off the bill because she knew they were very late. Waited about 10 more minutes for the bill, gave my card, when the waiter dropped off the check to sign, he threw it down and finally said ""sorry for all your trouble tonight"" as he ran away. BAD SERVICE given the stature of the restaurant and very hit or miss food.",,,

Updated review","I attribute my first fine dining experience in New York to a meal at JGV's Nougatine, the sister (and lesser) restaurant to Restaurant Jean Georges located next door in the Trump Tower. At the time, I wasn't aware of the dining room that was only a few yards away from me; after all, how could a just-transplanted Philadelphian know what three Michelin stars, four NY Times stars, and a 28 in Zagat meant? But it was the first step down the rabbit hole, and nearly two years later, with a respectable list of culinary conquests under my belt, there was something fitting about walking through the same doors - but this time, for Jean-Georges.Arriving earlier in the day or evening will afford a gorgeous view of Central Park West, as the floor-to-ceiling windows across the room let the remainder of sunlight filter in throughout the evening. The dining room, almost as iconic as the restaurant's name, consists of numerous curved banquette-style seats bordering a handful of perfectly-spaced tables. It's modern elegance at its best: comfortable, but still grand enough to let guests know they aren't in any ordinary dining room.For dinner, Jean Georges offers a three course prix-fixe as well as two tasting menus: the Signature and the Seasonal. Both are comprised of 7 courses, and despite multiple perusals of the menu, both had dishes so tempting that I couldn't decide between the two. Thankfully, our server was able to confirm that we could interchange courses between the two tastings, which solved my dilemma. A half-bottle of Zilliken 2011, a slightly dry Riesling, was brought out, and we were presented with a variety of light, summery amuses, signifying the start of the meal.To begin, the signature Egg Caviar. Even at first glance, it's a dichotomous dish; a simple egg shell almost comically topped with a generous spoonful of caviar. The hollowed egg shell is filled with a fluffy, almost airy soft scramble of eggs which is then finished off by whipped cream and caviar. Each spoonful is pure delight; the hints of cayenne in the scrambled egg are perfectly offset by the addition of lemon in the whipped cream, and the final punch is delivered by the brininess of caviar. My only regret was that there wasn't slightly more of it, but it served as a good segue into the second course. I was surprised at the size of the Sea Scallops as they were less than a centimeter in width, but they were lightly seared and served with caramelized cauliflower, a few strands of parsley, and a nutmeg-infused caper-raisin emulsion.  The Young Garlic Soup that followed was served in two parts: a small terrine for the soup and a side of sautéed frog legs, which I was encouraged to use my fingers to pick up and dip into the soup. I did appreciate the simplicity in the garlic soup, which was delightfully aromatic with the addition of thyme, curled watercress, and chive blossoms, but the discombobulated components threw me off. The Turbot that followed was perfectly poached and tender, but the pairing with a Château Chalon Sauce made it significantly less appetizing. The sauce, made from the rarer yellow Château Chalon wine, had a strong acidic edge that overpowered the fish.This was slightly ameliorated by the Lobster Tartine, which consisted of butter-poached lobster served with pea shoots and snap peas, finished tableside with a pour of the lemongrass and fenugreek broth. The presence of the butter toast at the bottom of the bowl was confusing at best, as it only become a soggy carbohydrate in short time, but the lobster was cooked to perfection, and the broth was startlingly simple and balanced meld of lobster stock, tomato, lemongrass, and fenugreek. The final savory course featured a perfectly-executed Lamb Chop, seared to a medium-rare and paired with a chili oil and cucumber yogurt. The protein was delicious, both fatty and lean, and the contrast of spice and coolness worked in tandem.Dessert is an essential ending to any good meal, and the tasting menus at JG offer a quartet of Dessert Tastings. The Strawberry Tasting was less than memorable, with a strawberry-red wine sorbet, over a vanilla crumble; a tasteless sponge cake, paired with a caramelized balsamic meringue; an effort at chantilly cream that clashed with the addition of shiso syrup; and a room-temperature Pâte à Choux, served with a side of Strawberry Jam. The better bet is to stick with the Chocolate tasting, which offers a miniature version of JGV's signature molten chocolate cake.I must caveat this review with the fact that: yes, I am biased, no, I am not a professional, and yes, this is based on just one experience out of many. But let the main takeaway be this: Jean Georges continues to deliver high quality food and service, in a remarkable ambiance. Is it the best of the best? In my opinion, no, but it's a worthy presence in the list of NYC's (and the nation's) best restaurants.--Review #101 of 2014: Complete.",13,4,7

167,Mary T.,"Boston, MA",490,383,1693,4.0,12/6/2014,"It was quite an experience to dine at Nougatine at Jean-Georges. It started off a little rough because this was my first stop right when I got to New York from Boston. My ETA was a little off so I was late to my reservation. The hostess was accommodating and they just reset my table. However, it took a little longer than I expected for them to reset the table though. I decided to dine at Nougatine rather than the actual Jean-Georges for lunch because it was more casual and I still got to experience the food made from a 3 star Michelin restaurant!I got their prix fixe lunch and it was an amazing deal. I started off with the fried calamari, then I got the black sea bass, and I ended with the warm chocolate cake. The calamari was flavored perfectly and the dip was really delicious. The dip was a citrus-chili dip that resembled spicy whipped mayo. I seriously wanted to dip everything in that! The problem I had with the calamari was I wished they cut down the tentacles more. It was a little messy to eat. One can tell that they put thought in coming up with the ingredients for this dish because they even included pickled chili slices to pair with the calamari, which added an extra kick.The entree that I got was the sea bass. I liked every component of the dish. It tickled every taste buds I had. It had a good balance of flavors - the sweetness and bitterness from the caramelized cauliflower, the acidity from the buttermilk vinaigrette, and the saltiness and umami flavor from the protein. The skin of sea bass was seared perfectly such that it was really crispy! I also liked the spätzle because it absorbed all of the flavors of the vinaigrette. After I finished the entree, I wanted to have another plate of it!As for the dessert, I thought it was heavenly. I normally don't like chocolate or sweets, but this was the perfect dessert for me! The molten chocolate cake was not too sweet and I liked how there were different elements that enhanced the usual molten chocolate cake. It was interesting to pair the cake with Madagascar vanilla icecream. The warm molten chocolate with the iced, cold ice-cream was a good combination! Also, they added some crunchy chocolate bits that elevated the dessert because it offset everything else on the dish that was soft.We sat by the window and had a nice view of Central Park to accompany our dining experience. I think we lucked out by getting what I thought was the best table in the restaurant. I thought the servers were attentive and there were multiple people taking care of one table at a time. This meal definitely inspired me to try to recreate some of the dishes I had.",1,1,1

170,Michelle M.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,93,58,5.0,5/30/2017,"without hesitation, this is definitely one of my personal favorite restaurants in the tri state area. not just because the food is exquisite, but because the service is outstanding to boot. my review is somewhat overdue, as i haven't been since last summer, but i figured i would add my two cents. my fiancé and his father and fathers girlfriend dined here for dinner on a weekday night. the place was pleasantly full without being stuffy because the layout is spacious and comfortable. i cannot remember our waitresses name but she was extremely helpful and friendly, as i'm sure all of the wait staff here are. i can't recall all the appetizers we had but i do remember the artichoke and it was DE-LISH! hard to mess up, but really fantastic when done right and this was just that. for my entree i ordered the salmon. now, i informed our waitress of my (severe) dairy and egg allergies, and our food was taking quite a while to come out. she then came by and informed us that she saw the entrees were ready for the table but that she didn't think that the salmon ended up being dairy and egg free. this was confusing to me for such a high end restaurant, but she handled it with extreme professionalism. she told us that the chef was preparing a new salmon dish that would be dairy and egg free and that she would bring all the entrees out together. this upset my fiancés father, only because he is elderly and very demanding. in the meantime we enjoyed wine and conversation and to our surprise she brought out a complimentary plate of INCREDIBLE grilled watermelon which was deeply appreciated. our entrees eventually came out and i'm sure you can guess those were equally as divine. my fiancé had the prosciutto wrapped pork chop which he said was to die for. on top of our dinner thus far being excellent, the waitress was nice enough to bring me a complimentary sorbet and fruit dish for dessert. as if things couldn't have been any better, they also took care of my meal. i have had so many mishaps in regards to my allergies when dining out and a restaurant comping my meal is usually something i never expect nor receive. this was truly a matter of great moral and professionalism on the restaurants behalf. nougatine is truly the definition of great food and GREAT hospitality that is worth every single penny you'll spend here. we had a wonderful and memorable meal that i can't help but think about almost weekly.",1,,

We considered moving inside and Chris, the manager, spoke with us. Let me tell you, Chris? Impeccable, classy--yet somehow managing to pull off human and down-to-earth. He's so on top of everyone's every need. Don't know how he does it. In any case, we all decided we'd stay outside until dessert. Our amazing waiter, Geo, took fantastic care of us before handing us off to Nerissa. We didn't spend as much time with Nerissa, although she was so gracious about dessert, but Geo was just awesome and backed up super nicely by Pedro on clean-up. We felt so well-taken-care-of, it just made us so happy. And since we were so slowly enjoying our food, it was really great that no one was pushing us out the door. We ate very, very slowly, savoring everything.Brings me to second, but should be first? The food, the food, wow, the food. I have a gluten/wheat allergy so they replaced Tuna Tartare for me with the shrimp salad. Faint. So good. Next? That amazing, amazing Foie Gras. The sweet of the sauce and the brulee matched up to this food that I normally never ever eat... heaven. Then Salmon that was so perfectly cooked and matched up with broccoli on mashed potatoes... sigh. It wasn't the sesame encrusted, it was something else, but was amazing. Last, the beef tenderloin on asparagus and fern and something spicey... All washed down with Prosecco. When it was cold we moved inside for dessert. My friend wanted me warm chocolate cake so I just took the full tasting. Butterscotch pudding. SIGH. Citrus Pavlova. SIGH. I nibbled at the vanilla ice cream.

Made a last minute reservation for 6 people on a Monday evening with no problem. We ended up having a 7th person unexpectedly join us halfway through dinner and the waitress graciously added a chair for us! Food: our table decided to try the dinner tasting menu. The first two courses, tuna tartare and foie gras brûlée, were my favorite. The last three courses were a little underwhelming. 1. Tuna tartare tasted very Asian/Japanese (in a good way) with the spicy radish, avocado and ginger marinade; it had a good kick to it and was very refreshing.2. Foie gras brûlée was bite-sized perfection. The strawberry syrup and aged balsamic complimented the dish well. The crispy top added just the right amount of sweetness and crunch. I would've gladly eaten 6 more of these. 3. Poppy seed crusted salmon was good, but the presentation was a bit sloppy. The squash and sauce looked like it was hastily dolloped around the salmon. The poppy seeds added a nice subtle flavor and texture to the fish, but the squash was sadly mushy/limp. 4. Grilled beef tenderloin was nothing special and slightly over cooked :(. 5. Dessert tasting came with the warm chocolate cake (very delicious but pretty ordinary), angel food cake (dry; only ate one bite), and a scoop of sorbet (very tart but nice palate cleanser). Overall, it was the perfect amount of food, and we really enjoyed ourselves! Would come back to try some of their a la carte items!",4,2,2
178,Jennifer S.,"Wilton, CT",10,122,57,4.0,7/17/2014,"We had a most excellent meal here.  The ambience was clean and beautifully minimal, the service was impeccable and our starters and entrees were prepared to perfection.  The Foie Gras Brule was one of the most amazing things that I have ever eaten!  Truly.  And my salmon was flawless - paired well with corn pudding and cherry tomato salad.  Absolutely delicious.  The desserts?  Hmmmmm.The presentation of the Poached Peach resembled a dirty ashtray - tiny cigarette butts, popcorn, random bits of lord knows what.  Hilarious, yes, but it just didn't come together for me.  The fruit wasn't quite ripe or warm and it sat on a bed of chilly peach granita.  And the core was full of pistachio cream.  And it had popcorn and little sugar butts on it. And mint and peach chips.  The tastes and textures were in total conflict!Now the Butterscotch Pudding with sea salt and caramel was dreamy.  Very very rich, oh-so smooth, presented simply with two biscuits and lovely with a coffee.Nougatine is deserving of 5 stars for sure, but I'm deducting one for that damn peach and the fact that I didn't love it all enough to race back.But you should go.  For the Foie Gras.  I can't stop thinking about it.",2,1,

181,Ahmad A.,"Chicago, IL",8,30,13,4.0,2/20/2016,"Great experience. Wife and I couldn't make our V-Day reservation because our baby was sick, so I rescheduled. We came with our three month old and were terrified he'd ruin our lunch and others's, but he was so well-behaved and it made our time great. Service was impeccable from the check-in desk until the end. Our waiter was knowledgable, attentive without being overwhelming, and we always had clean handkerchiefs and full glasses of water. Ambiance was casual as advertised, and the decor was modern and beige a la ABC Kitchen. The $38 lunch prix-fixe is one of the best dining deals in the city. Wife and I share everything, so we both got to experience all the plates. For appetizers we had the tuna tartare and the warm duck confit salad. The tartare was average, but its jus was beautiful, gingery, zingy; duck confit salad was spectacular! For entrees we shared the burger which was solid (the pepper-jack was an surprising and delicious cheese choice); but the sesame-crusted salmon was perfect, especially with its awesome passionfruit glaze. Desserts were good too (particularly the one with blood oranges), the most notable element of each being the ice cream and sorbet. Overall it was a great first experience here and we look forward to hitting it up more consistently once in a while.",,,
182,Polina D.,"Rego Park, Queens, NY",10,2,54,3.0,7/23/2015,"Restaurant Week is a great opportunity for a chef to show off the potential of a restaurant by presenting prospective new clientele with a selection of exquisitely crafted and innovative dishes. At least in theory, right? Well, apparently Nougatine At Jean-Georges did not get the memo.I came here with my mother and aunt for the NYC Restaurant Week dinner prix fixe menu. Sampling at least one participating restaurant every time Restaurant Week rolls around is our little tradition, and at $38 per person for a 3-course meal this deal was too enticing to pass up. Unfortunately, the prix fixe menu options were reminiscent of mediocre wedding reception food: a choice of soup or salad for the appetizer, chicken or fish for the entrée, and chocolate lava cake or strawberry shortbread for dessert. A bit disappointing, considering the caliber of restaurant. As each course was brought out, I kept holding on to the hope that the chef would show us a different perspective on the old soup-or-salad-chicken-or-fish combo by adding his own unique twist to each dish, but was sorely let down. Between myself and my dinner party, we tried everything except for the salad appetizer:Appetizers: Chilled Cucumber-Yogurt Soup - In my opinion, the most original dish on the prix fixe menu. A little creamy but not rich, refreshing, with fresh blueberries and raspberries adding an interesting mix of flavors to the dish.Greek Salad of Roasted Beets - As already mentioned, no one in my party ordered this. Our server did mention that the beets are specially roasted in some sort of citrusy reduction. It looked pretty sad sitting on neighboring dinner tables.Entrees:Sauteed Flounder - An overall well prepared, but pretty standard fillet of flounder. It was a bit too heavily salted for my taste. The only interesting part of the dish was the rice pudding that it comes served over, which is reminiscent of polenta but not quite. Crispy Organic Chicken with Summer Squash - Too salty, just like the flounder. A sad piece of chicken floating in a sad puddle of tomato sauce that tasted overwhelmingly of basil. I was pretty excited about the summer squash, but there was only one tiny circle of it on my plate.Dessert:Strawberry Shortbread - Stale frosting sandwiched between two pieces of biscuit, served in a puddle of strawberry syrup and fresh diced strawberries on the side. It was really nothing special. Valrhona Molten Chocolate Cake - Molten chocolate lava cake served with a glob of vanilla ice cream on the side. Rich, sweet, overwhelmingly chocolaty, and pretty much tastes like this no matter where you order it. We ordered cappuccinos a la carte for $8 apiece to enjoy with our dessert, and those were actually pretty delicious. The service was nowhere near up to par with what I expect from a restaurant of this level. I had the misfortune of sitting on the outside of our little corner table, and the wait staff repeatedly bumped me, grazed me, and/or asked me to shift out of the way whenever it was time to clear the plates or refill the water glasses for our table. By about the sixth time I was asked to duck as someone loomed over me with a full pitcher of water, I was visibly irritated and uncomfortable, but no one took notice. They brought us our check without asking if we were finished with our meal - another major no-no. In the end, I can only describe my experience at Nougatine as anti-climactic. It was like sitting through a slew of mediocre opening acts while waiting to see a favorite performer on stage, only to be told that he missed his flight and won't be showing up after all.  None of the food was outright bad. Everything was well prepared and, aside from being a little on the salty side, tasted pretty much how one would expect at most restaurants. It just missed that special bit of culinary magic that one expects from a high price point, top reviewed, 3 Michelin star rated restaurant. I don't think I'll be back.",5,,

Updated review","Basically a more casual Jean George. For lunch, there is a 3 - course meal for $35.  Everything I have tried was delicious.The last time I was there, I was in NY during Hurricane Sandy and got stuck in NY for a few extra days than anticipated. And with a lot of restaurants being closed due to the hurricane, Nougatine managed to stay open and they gave us a call to let us know that they would be able to take us for reservations if we wanted.Great service and customer service.",4,3,3

The steak itself was excellent, of course.  Nougatine is a bargain.",,,

Updated review","Stopped by right after I went to Jean-Georges the night before, pretty price for pre fixe menu with 3 dishes. It's a good place to go if you don't want to spend that much money on Jean George. They got excellent service and great environment.  Got a seat right next to window, really nice. The food is great. Just the sauce is kinda too strong for entree. But for 38 dollar and this, I'm satisfied. Recommend!",3,2,4

I feel like I can make better than themPasta: I feel like i was eating  the instant noodles. Bad!The dessert;Chocolate cake: it tastes ok!Blood orange ice cream: it tastes best of the whole meal!

Updated review","What else can I say that other yelpers before me hasn't said yet? Jean Georges totally deserves that elusive three Michelin stars. Those Michelin people might want to add another star tho cause it was that good for me. Took the boyfriend to Jean Georges for his birthday late last year. We both felt like it was our birthday tho lol. We decided on the three course meal with a 4th course. I was skeptical on how much food we're getting with a 3 course and I was already thinking about where to get pizza after it since for sure we will still be hungry. But no. Their three course meal was a real meal that can definitely be enough. The amuse bouche, petit fours, dessert and even the palate cleansers that came on top of the 3 courses was lovely. I cannot pick a favorite since I loved everything I got.Service was on point as it should be but does not feel pretentious. We had a laugh or two with our server and we felt very comfortable in the space. Those Michelin people really do know what they're doing lol.",11,7,10
190,Diana P.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",52,261,1000,4.0,11/27/2015,"Nougatine is a fabulous bustling restaurant where great eats meets a casual setting while maintaining the highest standards of the culinary arts. We started off our evening with a nice glass of Riesling and Bordeaux which complemented our meals nicely. The hake was fresh and flavorful, filling yet light, and the steak was prepared perfectly (fyi-that's saying a lot since I'm not keen on steak)! The apps were just as wonderful - must trys are the foie gras brûlée and the tuna tartare; super tasty and refreshing! The service was attentive and each meal was timed just right. We were a party of four and had a great time. I would highly recommend Nougatine for a special occasion or for a special casual meal out.",,,
191,Michi S.,"Honolulu, HI",20,157,386,4.0,7/21/2015,"This is a review for their Lunch Prix Fixe for $38 which is available Monday-Saturday. This is also available during restaurant week, for $25. When it's that time of year, make sure to go on Monday-Friday. When I go here, I always make a reservation beforehand. Go to their website and it'll connect you to opentable.com! The pre-fixe comes with an appetizer, entreé, and dessert. I love to get the shrimp salad as an appetizer. The shrimp is so fresh and I also love the dressing. Having avocado also is a plus for me. I've also had their fried calamari and tuna tartare. Both are good if you want to share another appetizer with a friend. For the entreé, I definitely recommend their fish. Mostly recently, I've had their Hake, which I ate for the first time in my life. The fish itself is very light but I enjoyed the sauce that brought the flavor out. The best dish I had was their slow-cooked salmon, but I don't see it anymore on their menu! If that comes back, I definitely recommend it. I've had their organic chicken and pastas, but there's nothing special about them. For me, the highlight of the meal (because I really only come here for the dessert) is their chocolate molten cake: JEAN-GEORGES WARM CHOCOLATE CAKE with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream!! Don't hesitate, get this, because that's why everyone comes here. Disclaimer for first timers: portions are not big, so take your time eating! Nougatine also enforces a business casual dress code. They don't accept any sneakers, flip-flops, t-shorts and shorts. I saw some tourists being stopped because of this! However, they will guide you to their outside seating area if the weather is nice so not worry if you absolutely have to dress casual.",2,,1
192,Bobby R.,"East Meadow, NY",532,9,0,5.0,5/4/2017,"Perfection all around. Would you expect less from a restaurant in a Trump property? Food was tasty, presentation was art, and atmosphere keeps you entertained. The wait staff and management in the floor are eyeing your table often..that could be a good and bad thing. Good because they are very attentive, bad because you feel like they want to clear the table and set up for next guests.  However, def an ""experience""! We went for lunch.

193,Josephine L.,"Manhattan, NY",600,1428,20,4.0,10/17/2015,"Located a stone's throw from Billionaire's Row, this casual creation of Jean-Georges' is understandably a place to see and be seen on a Friday night, albeit with a somewhat more flexible dress code. My friend and I stayed at the bar, at first for drinks, then for dinner as the night wore on. Service was flawless and so were the cocktails: the Passion Whiskey Sour, the Raspberry Lychee Bellini and the JG 75 (JG's twist on a French 75). Drinks were complemented at all times by bar snacks in the form of housemade truffle and cheese popcorn, and seasoned wasabi beans.When it came time for real food, we enjoyed the amuse bouche of parsnip pear soup with croutons, the incredible fresh spaghetti with mushrooms and asparagus, and the scrumptious lobster burger with green chili mayonnaise and fries. The one dour moment was dessert: the sour cream cheesecake with citrus salad and mandarin sorbet was clearly fresh, but far too bitter for my liking.",,,1

195,Grace S.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,119,187,5.0,8/11/2016,"I dined here after obsessively checking for reservations the two weeks they had restaurant week and I must say I was impressed with about half the menu. I recommend for restaurant week, if you're going with one other person, get one of everything to have a little variety and share; its always more fun that way and you get to try new things :) The service was good, even though it was a little busy. Server knew exactly what she was talking about which is something I always appreciate. As for my prix fixe restaurant week, dinner for two, i had...A P P E T I Z E R S+ SUCRENE SALAD with avocado, tomato and spicy corn vinaigrette. It was meh compared to the rest of the menu. + SPICY TUNA, black olive, cucumber. This was my favorte app, and its pretty much a tuna tartare, but spicy. If you're a sushi fan, GET THIS. E N T R E E + CRUNCHY ORGANIC CHICKEN with glazed market carrots, soy syrup. This dish was a little less than impressive for me considering my expectations for this restaurant. The breast was a little dry, but the thigh was juicy so the dish was partially salvaged. Veggies were good but nothing to go crazy about. + SAUTÉED HAKE with fresh corn pudding, marinated cherry tomato. This dish was fantastic, super balanced with the lightness of the fish, creamy corn pudding and acidity of the tomato. I was SO impressed with the corn pudding, it sounds weird with fish but its an amazing combo I didnt even know existed til now. This was my fav of the two. D E S S E R T + Mixed market BERRY PALOVA with whipped fromage blanc and starwberry sorbet. This was very fruity and sweet. Loved the freshness of the sorbet and it comes with fresh fruit so it was a nice finish to out meal. This dish was good, but not as impressive. + Jean Georges Warm CHOCOLATE CAKE with VANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM. OH MY GAWWDDDD. IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS REVIEW, LET IT BE THIS...this lava cake is hands down one of the best desserts I've had IN MY LIFE. I am a HUUGE fan of lava cake (the green tea one at Spot dessert bar was my fav before this), but this....this one is a GAME CHANGER. IT IS THE MOST PERFECT LAVA CAKE EVER. Not too sweet and the perfect consistency; the vanilla bean was the best complement to the dish too. I could eat this ALL DAY. Will be raving about this signature dessert for the rest of my life and WILL be back for it.ALL IN ALL...I would've honestly given this place a 3 or 4/5 stars if it wasn't for the lava cake. Only half of the menu really blew me out of the water, but the lava cake has changed my life.....so it has to be a 5/5. Clearlyyy, will be back :3",1,1,
196,Christie D.,"Dallas, TX",31,34,7,3.0,11/30/2016,"Very uninspiring. The best part was the amuse bouche of chicken soup before the meal. We got the tuna tartar- WAY too much ginger sauce . One of the worst tartars I have had. Next was burrata- this was decent- can you mess up a ball of cheese? Would have been good with some toasted bread. Next we both got the steak. It was OK. I was sad that mine was overlooked then towards the end realized they had given the medium rare to my boyfriend who didn't notice. They offered to send out a new steak but I didn't want to wait around since we were almost done. We went with apple pie for desert. It was good but mostly just crust. The waitress was nice but we were surprised at how fast everything came out- 4 courses with wine in less than an hour. Each course came out before we even finished the previous. All in all, this was decent but nothing I would rave about or return for. For the price, I was expecting much better.",,,
197,Amelia C.,"Jersey City, NJ",281,248,376,2.0,6/1/2015,"While the service here is impeccable, the menu leaves something to be desired... originality. Of the appetizers, the tuna tartar was beautifully presented but didn't taste particularly interesting; other restaurants have done better with the marinade/sauces accompanying a tartar. The one stand out of the meal was the split pea soup - that was truly refreshing and delicious. Among the four of us, we had a range of the menu entrees: the crunchy baked free range chicken (white meat, not succulent), the miso-glazed cod (it was more citrus-flavored than miso, and the fish was not noteworthy in taste; I expected a more buttery, decadent quality for cod), the burger (this was great, but just a burger, it's not too hard to get right!), and the veal.The desserts were nothing different from a standard New American restaurant - molten chocolate cake and a petite beurre cookie with some berries on it. Flawlessly executed, but again nothing unique.",4,,

Breakfast-  again, service was exceptional- servers were very attentive. However, the food was not that great. My kids had the waffles.
