Updated review","#I went back for a Steak Platter (MealPal). You know how I was #complaining last time that the steak was overcooked? This time, it looked good and medium rare. But I think it was even more harder to eat. #So chewy.  So maybe their steak should be overcooked.Their #Fried Chicken Platter tastes the best so far.",1,1,2
1,Gary L.,"New York, NY",113,41,16,4.0,10/23/2018,"Came here because I wanted to tell people I was eating something healthy, but secretly eating fried chicken.I ordered the fried chicken plate with seasonal vegetables and a kale salad. I saw them assemble my salad, and was a little shocked that they only gave me one piece of fried chicken at first. When I went to Tender Greens in San Francisco's financial district, they usually give two, maybe three pieces of chicken. I was ready to be disappointed when I got home to eat, but upon closer inspection, the fried chicken was a huge piece!The salad was underwhelming and looked a little sad on the plate. The seasonal vegetables tasted pretty good, but was under-seasoned. The fried chicken was amazing - perfectly seasoned, still crispy, very tender. I loved it! Maybe I'll get just the fried chicken next time with no sides...",1,,2
2,Henry T.,"New York, NY",305,668,1934,4.0,10/11/2018,"Had the chipotle bbq chicken plate. It came with several pieces of their bbq chicken, salad and mashed potatoes. Overall, I was pretty impressed with my meal, the mashed potatoes and the chicken really stood out to me and were both well seasoned and delicious. The chicken was nice and savory and had a slight char to them. Tastes great with the hot sauce they provided. You can tell that they hand mashed their mashed potatoes from the inconsistencies of the potatoes. Brownie points for that. Overall, I'd highly recommend Tender Greens if you're looking for a solid lunch spot by Union Square. The staff were efficient and there is ample seating. One complaint that I do have however, was for the leftover dishes from previous customers left scattered all around the vacant tables.",2,,
3,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4582,2943,8900,4.0,8/6/2018,"Sure, the salads are good at the salad place...but the COOKIES.Honestly, I'm into the chipotle bbq chicken here in basically any form. They have it on a salad (with romaine, tortilla chips, avocado, cotija, and a chili lime dressing), on a plate (you get to pick a green and a side), or on a sandwich. It's a juicy, well-seasoned mix of dark and light meat with a nice hint of spicy sweetness from the barbecue sauce, and my only complaint is that I want more of it. I've never gotten anything else here at Tender Greens, and I probably never will.But really nothing compares to these salty sweet caramel whatever the hell they are cookies. They are $2.50 apiece, and a steal at $6 for a bag of assorted cookies, and they are the flat, crisp, buttery as all hell cookies that you always wanted. Come for the cookies, and eat some chipotle bbq chicken because you can't just eat cookies for lunch.",9,2,6
4,Trika R.,"Orange Park, FL",38,258,106,5.0,7/23/2018,"This place is pretty good. I had the falafel meal it comes with a salad, your choice of a side and 4 falafels. Salad just needs a little more dressing, 2 friends said the same. The friend chicken was good too!I've ate at the LA location and didn't care for it, this location seemed much better! Defiantly will be back to eat here again before I leave",2,,
5,Michelle B.,"Huntington Station, NY",808,1305,3040,2.0,9/2/2018,"Ever since I discovered Tender Greens in LA, I had been dreaming of the day I could have it in NYC. I was super excited to hear that they opened in NYC and it's taken me a few months to finally get there. I got the Chipotle Barbecue Chicken salad (which I got multiple times while in LA). I was soooo let down. The presentation was just not as nice. I recall the ingredients being fresher and it was served with a nicely grilled piece of toast in LA.  The tortilla ""strips"" were actually just broken pieces of stale tortilla chips. There was also an insane amount of bugs flying around my dish the whole time. Super unappetizing. It's also very expense here. The salad was close to $15 and not that filling.",1,,
6,Jess P.,"Brooklyn, NY",249,250,130,4.0,5/21/2018,"My new favorite spot! If you're an office drone on a variation of the grass-fed protein plus veggies variety, you'll love it too.I ordered the backyard steak plate with the house salad and unspecified seasonal vegetables. The cashier handed me one of those buzzers so they could drop off my food wherever I sat. It's spacious and people don't linger for long, so we quickly found a table for two. They have a dispenser where you can get your own water in an actual glass. You use real silverware, too! (I hate plastic utensils for environmental reasons and because they taste gross.) My plate was dropped off by a friendly guy in a matter of minutes.The steak was perfection: a delicious marinade, mid-rare with crisp edges. The salad was lightly dressed with a hint of salt and the greens were pretty. The seasonal vegetables were good, but the multicolored carrots were undercooked. The sugar snap peas were sweet and crisp and the asparagus was perfectly roasted. (On my second visit, the carrots were cooked through, but the steak was over cooked. Still tasty.)I was so happy with my meal and will definitely be making this my new lunch joint when I'm too lazy to cook.If you download their app, you get rewards points and a free drink just for downloading it. I had the green monster, which is invigorating and tasty. Do it!",2,,2
7,Demi H.,"New York, NY",6,69,52,5.0,5/29/2018,"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Such a perfect spot for a fast, casual, and tasty lunch. Menu is healthy and extensive. There is a lot to choose from. The portions are large and perfect to fill you up! I got the tuna, arugula salad, and brown rice. My boyfriend got the chicken (so tender!), mashed potatoes, arugula salad AND the soup. Everything was great. ESPECIALLY the mashed potatoes. I was also very impressed by the customer service. The ""bus boy"" (not sure if that would be the correct title) was very attentive, made sure we did didn't need anything through out our lunch. He was very kind, and didn't even expect a tip.",1,,
8,Maggie Z.,"Middle Village, NY",848,301,730,3.0,4/26/2018,"My experience at Tender Greens was extremely unmemorable. The food is mediocre on all fronts in my opinion or the chain, from California, is just way too hyped up. It's walking distance between Union Square and Baruch College which makes the restaurant easily accessible and the location is large with plenty of seating, spacious, and clean. I came here twice and on my first visit I went with a plate- a protein, side and a salad choice. I had the backyard steak, with mashed potatoes and butter lettuce to go. The line moved fairly quickly, the cashier was extremely sweet, friendly and patient and you get a little buzzer thing to notify you when your food is ready. The food came out quickly. First, for about $15 at a fast casual restaurant I think the price is a little high for what you get. Three strips of thinly sliced steak, a few pieces of lettuce and a side. The steak was... whatever. They cook it medium rare but it is extremely chewy and un-tasty. The butter lettuce was quite bitter. The mashed potatoes were excellent, large in portion and creamy. The second time I came here I opt'd for the Lobster salad. The lobster tails are from Luke's Lobster, so not made in-house, and for a whoppin' $16 for a salad I expected more than 3 tiny pieces of lobster tail. It was really a plate moreso filled with leaves. They were accommodating enough to let me change out the green from whatever it originally is to butter lettuce (this is probably my mistake). This salad has no other toppings other than the lobster tail for the most part. I also had their Green Monster ($3.50) which was excellent and probably one of my favorite things here (second to the mashed potatoes). Overall, would probably not go out of my way to come eat here as there was definitely better options in the immediate area that are both more wallet friendly, tasty and equally healthy.",3,1,4
9,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1481,4351,5.0,3/24/2018,"Officially obsessed with this spot. First, download the app to earn rewards when you make purchases and refer friends. (No, they did not pay me to say that.) This place is basically a better version of what Made Nice is trying to be. I've tried the steak, seared tuna, mint lemonade, agua fresca, hot coffee, chocolate chip cookie, caramel cookie, peanut butter cookie, seasonal veggies, mashed potatoes, butter lettuce, tender greens salad, fried chicken plate and fried chicken sandwich. The fried chicken and seared tuna are my favorite proteins, and the chocolate chip cookie is phenomenal.Only thing I didn't love was the mashed potatoes, which I found bland. Go for the veggies instead!Edit 4/18: Have since tried oatmeal cookie, and the chipotle barbecue chicken and green market chicken salads. Oatmeal cookie is my second favorite after the chocolate chip, and the green market chicken salad is just amazing.Skip the vegan brownie. It's nothing special.",2,1,1
10,Kaitlin D.,"Jackson Heights, NY",159,83,288,4.0,4/6/2018,"I've heard about Tender Greens thanks to Instagram and every foodie. Lucky it is pretty close to my job, I passed it a couple times but never went it. Walking with a coworkers she suggested Tender Greens, I was in! I ordered the steak sandwich which comes with your choice of salad (mine was arugula) Which I have to say, the arugula was delicious!! There is nothing but positive things I can say. The food was delicious, the service was very fast, the staff was very attentive, and super clean! My lunch ended up being $15. Ideally that is a lot for lunch, but we're in NY! So what the hell. Next time I go, trying that fried chicken!!!",1,,
11,Flora L.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",206,366,545,4.0,3/5/2018,"Yay! Finally get to try tender greens since I didn't get to in LA. It's walking distance from school and another delicious healthy option for lunch/dinner. They're known for their salads but they serve ""plates"" (protein, side, salad), soups, desserts and sandwiches as well. My boyfriend and I both opted for the plates.Plate 1 - BBQ chicken, baby arugula salad, mash potatoesPlate 2 - Backyard steak, baby arugula salad, california sprout riceHibiscus Tea - not bad, but probably wouldn't get again.The BBQ chicken was good. Nothing special though. Mash potatoes were creamy and on point. The baby arugula was delicious. It was a little too cheesy and had too much dressing but was still good. California sprout rice was very flavorful. DO NOT GET THE STEAK. IT IS WAY TOO CHEWY! I see from other reviews this is a common thing. Someone sitting next to my boyfriend and I even asked us if the steak was chewy because he wanted to see if it was a one time thing or an ongoing thing. It's confirmed that the steak is a disappointment :( Overall, really like this place! I would deff come back. The place is huge. Lots of space and different types of seating from bar stools to communal tables and private tables. The staff are also very attentive. Only downside would be the price. One of the more expensive healthy food places in the area.",3,1,1
12,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4712,2086,3963,4.0,2/13/2018,"Tender Greens was one of my favorite lunch and dinner spots when I lived in LA, so I've been highly anticipating its opening in the Flatiron. After checking it out on opening day, I was happy with my meal, but I realized that there are so many comparable fast casual fresh eats these days that it's a bit hard to stand out the way they used to years ago.I went with the backyard steak sandwich, which comes with lots of meat in a big hunk of ciabatta with a sizable Caesar salad on the side. It's a generous portion, but at $14 I just think it's a little too pricey to be an everyday lunch option. I couldn't resist their salted caramel cookie ($2.50), which was actually the highlight of my meal. I absolutely loved the perfect chewy/crunchy texture and salty/sweet flavor. The place was very highly staffed on opening day, with people standing every few steps waiting to help out and answer questions. Everyone was all smiles and the food came out very quickly. Overall, it was a nice experience, but I can't say confidently that it stands head and shoulders above places like Dig Inn, Sweetgreen, Made Nice, Little Beet, or other healthy/quick spots in the area. It'll be one of many in my lunch arsenal.",10,3,6
13,Franny A.,"New York, NY",840,1280,1046,4.0,2/12/2018,"Cali fast casual import has premiered in a giant Union Square space on LoBro brought to you by Danny  Meyer. Like Made Nice food is prepared in an open kitchen. Unlike Made Nice, food is not chef driven, but is health conscious and brought to the table which is a nice touch.Ate:Lobster saladTomato soup with basil oil & croutons Total: $22The lobster salad with good sized pieces of Luke's Lobster tail counter balanced by crunchy thinly sliced apples was genius. The freshest of greens with tasty dressing- would have this again. The soup on the other hand tasted slightly burnt and had zero flavor, still working out the seasoning, I was told. The service was very good as would be expected by the Union Square hospitality Group.When i came on a subsequent visit I tried the chicken soup which was light, comforting and delish and still love, love love the lovely lobster salad.",8,4,7
14,Liz S.,"New York, NY",792,706,1568,4.0,2/14/2018,"Tender Greens is yet another nice lunch spot putting down roots in Flatiron, though it boasts the double pedigree of being an LA export and a Danny Meyer investment. They opened up just last week and look to already be firing on all cylinders, with crowds to match. Arriving before noon, we had little trouble finding a seat, but by the time we were leaving there was a reasonable line. The decor is corporate chic, but not depressing.The name of the game here is salads and plates, most coming in around $15. My boyfriend went for the tuna nicoise salad ($14), while I had the chef's daily special of swordfish on parsnip puree with a side salad ($15.50). We also got mint lemonade (under $3) and a green monster ($3.50), which is shockingly cheap for green juice.The food mostly lived up to the reputation. My swordfish was outstanding-- a nice big slice of buttery soft fish with a delightful smear of chimichurri. The puree was nice, and the salad decent. My boyfriend was less enthused with the tuna nicoise, which was overdressed, but also thought the portion was large and high quality. Our drinks were both good, though the green juice had some natural settling.They place a big emphasis on service here, with polite cashiers and multiple people checking in about our meal. Although it's your standard fast-casual order at a counter scheme, they give a tracker rather than a buzzer, so the food comes to you.Overall, I was impressed by the food. We'll see how they compete in the crowded Flatiron lunch market.",4,1,2
15,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1637,64808,5.0,2/5/2018,"The newest fast casual chain to hit NYC is a popular one from the West Coast backed by Danny Meyer.They do bowls and salads, as well as sandwiches and rotating pasta specials. So far I've just tried the Tuna Nicoise Salad, which was great, and armed with a mobile offering app and everything, they make for a great alternative to Sweetgreen. I also tried some of the cookies, which were surprisingly good, especially the chocolate chip. I'll be back soon for the Fried Chicken Sandwich.",10,1,6
16,Jordan J.,"Manhattan, NY",105,70,136,5.0,2/19/2018,"Pretty excited by this fast casual restaurant that's serving up some yummy and healthy fare. There are plates where you get to pick a protein, salad, and side. Or you can get a salad or sandwich. Once you order you get a tracker and the staff will bring your food out to you. We got the fried chicken and steak plates which were both good. The steak was a little on the chewy side but really flavorful. Also loved the generous helping of greens, which could have been less heavily dressed, but paired nicely with the rest of the plate. We also got the mashed potato side which was delicious. Note that they do have an app you can download and get free offers on before you come in. You can also redeem points on it.",2,1,2
17,Anya T.,"Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",63,82,241,5.0,2/8/2018,"There's nothing bad I can say about Tender Greens. I went for their grand opening and received a ticket for a free dinner. Yassss! Cause y'all know I came hungry. Sooo, I got the steak (cooked medium). Yess, you get to choose doneness if you specify. If not the default is medium rare!! Anywho, I got that with the arugula salad. Good but nothing coo coo bananas to say about it. It was tossed in a light lemony vinaigrette. My friend got the romaine heart cesar salad option with croutons. It was a bigger portion and had crunchy croutons and a cesar dressing. I'd get that next time. We both chose the mashed potatoes as our second side. Omgg. It was creamy. Perfect amount of salt and buttery. Yassss. Melt. Meltttt into those potatoes honey. Become one with it's starchy goodness. Ohhh. Sorry. Lemme catch my drool. So there are a few options. You can do Plates, where you pick a protein then 2 sides, one salad based, and the other things like roasted veggies, mashed potatoes..blah blah. Then you have a big salad option. Or you can opt to get a sandwich. With my meal I chose the mint lemonade. Very tart, not to sweet, but not very minty. My friend got the agua fresco. Yummmmy! Very refreshing. Tasted like pineapple and orange juice and was sweet. The hibiscus tea wasn't sweet. Pretty typical hibiscus flavor and vibrant in color. Please don't spill it on your white pants! LolI'd definitely go back. They give you a buzzer. It vibrates and flashes when your food is ready. They have tons of friendly staff. They brought my food to me. Brought me silverware. Picked up my food behind me and even gave me a drink refill before I left. Excellent service. This is an example of when companies pay their employees properly and take away the need to leave tip, unless someone obviously wants to. I really liked that. I could get the full dining experience without the hassle at the end. That's a plus! If you're on your lunch break I recommend you check it out. Trickle in there like that butter trickles into their mashed potatoes.",2,,
18,Tiffany C.,"New York, NY",135,110,275,5.0,3/1/2018,"I've been wanting to try Tender Greens for a while because friends who visited their Cali locations raved about it. I made the conscious decision to not come as soon as they open so this way they can work out their kinks because I've made that mistake too many times. Then I started to review their yelp reviews and had mixed feelings because the reviews were 50/50 and the portion sizes looked small. So I decided to come with my girls and have a ""healthy"" but good dinner. I've been talking about it so much that I hyped it up for them.5/5 for service. The customer service from cashier, to servers, to the manager could not have been better. I wish I caught their names but the guy who brought us our food and the manager was beyond attentive. They kept checking up on us to make sure we were good, you'd think we were in a regular restaurant. 5/5 for food. The food was fresh and delicious. I got the tuna with arugula salad and a side of mashed potatoes. Everything was perfect! My friends got the fried chicken sandwich and falafel salad and they said it was amazing. All 3 of us got the mint lemonade and it was really good.3.5/5 for the portion size. Although everything was absolutely delicious, it was on the smaller side. I know for me I could have used another slice or two of tuna so I know if I came her with my fiancé he'd definitely leave hungry if he was to have gotten the platter. But I do understand paying for quality over quantity. Overall experience 5/5 and I'll definitely be back.",,,
19,Michelle V.,"New York, NY",27,140,20,2.0,6/22/2018,"Oh man. Thanks to Sweetgreens there's been an inundation of healthy food chains. Good for us. However, Tender Greens misses the mark by a whole lot. I got their bbq classic and it tasted like a bunch of mayo and not a lot of chicken. For 14 dollars I am paying for a premium chicken sandwich and what I got in return was something I could have easily grabbed at my corner deli for half the price, the workers there all seem less then enthused. I didn't know it was possible to have a wet salad that tasted like nothing.  But alas nothing is impossible. Their butter lettuce side tasted as though it just got washed with water and a little salt and pepper, save your money and go elsewhere. One of the servers was kind enough (Cameron) and asked about how the food tasted and I was very honest, I wished they gave their staff more power in terms of offering another option. At 5p on a Friday I should have figured something was up when I was one of two patrons.",1,,
20,Julie Ann H.,"Westfield, NJ",17,24,7,2.0,10/29/2018,"Not impressed. Basically a Paneras in glitzier clothing. Bought a shrimp bowl which was mostly rice. It had literally just a few shrimp (and was priced at $15). Also saw some questionable / gross sanitary concerns- like a guy wiping off a table WITH HIS SLEEVE (!), and a woman scratching and rubbing her eyes and then preparing food. Even tho it's conveniently located near somewhere I often go I would not go back again, just not worth the value to me.",,1,
21,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,4.0,5/23/2018,"Based on an LA chain, Tender Greens makes a debut to NY. I've become a recent big fan of this place next to other chains like Sweetgreen and Dig Inn. In fact, I think Tender Greens is better than the aforementioned. At the moment, there's only one location in Flatiron, but I'm hoping that changes over time as it garners more attention.Tender Greens serves a concise menu of salads and plates, alongside soups and smaller side dishes. Their beverages do include some draft and canned beers. I've only ventured twice to Tender Greens, and have only ever ordered the Tuna Nicoise Salad (grilled rare albacore, baby greens, tomato, potato, capers, green beans, quail egg, olives, sherry vinaigrette) and roasted tomato soup on the side. The Tuna Nicoise is very tasty and a high recommend. It's a hearty salad with ample excellent quality tuna and vegetables. I love the texture of the baby greens. The vinaigrette dressing is light but full of flavor. The tomato soup makes a great side if the salad alone is just not enough. My bf has ordered the salt and pepper chicken plate with tender greens salad, which is also a really great choice. You can customize your own plate, but if you're indecisive like me, the Tuna Nicoise is definitely a great choice.While I love healthy salad spots like Sweetgreen, I'd say Tender Greens is maybe a tad better when it comes to the quality and taste of the meal for the price (which is more on that steep side). The selection is great, very fresh, and very tasty. Just because it's going to be healthy doesn't mean it can't taste good. Definitely worth a visit for anyone who wants a great salad in this neighborhood.",3,1,5
22,Tara L.,"New York, NY",5,41,3,1.0,9/4/2018,"Because I ended up having to cancel my order via the seamless company, I was not able to leave a review on seamless, so I'll leave one here. Incredibly disappointed with my experience.  I ordered on seamless, and was given a delivery time window of about 30-40, as the restaurant listed as their delivery estimate.  As I waited, the seamless ""tracker"" kept changing the delivery time another 10 minutes, another 10 minutes etc until it was over an hour after when I ordered.  In which case, I wouldn't have ordered from them in the first place. In an effort to check on the status of he order, I called the number listed through the app, which is of course wrong. I waited while it rang for a few minutes. Then I went to Yelp, to see if the number was wrong, and it was, so I called the correct number.  I got an automated system, which didn't have an option to check on an order placed through seamless, so I selected various options until I got a human. She asked my name and put me on hold for over 10 minutes.  I hung up to call back in case they forgot about me, and nobody ever picked up again.  I called 5 times. All the line options on the automated system, And let them ring for 2 min each.  whay started as excitement for a healthy dinner option turned into an epic waste of my time and night, and a call to my local pizzeria for a slice.  Get your ordering and communications act together please.",1,,

Everything was fresh and tasty with a distinct inoculation of flavor- such as the smoky jerk and the perfectly marinaded and cooked shrimp with cumin and coriander. My well portioned shrimp plate looked pretty and tasted even better. Their refreshing mint lemonade, alfresco and green drinks complimented their unique take on farm fresh. The space is huge and makes you feel like you are in the cleanest tiled warehouse made for people watching.",7,1,7

The roasted tomato soup was heavenly. The wait staff were incredibly friendly bringing my food to my table, giving me utensils and even offering to refill my glass of water.

This Tender Greens has a large seating area which is wonderful. The menu is great and I thoroughly enjoyed my salami salad. (Something they don't offer in California). However the customer service was not on the same level as Cali. The staff was not  friendly or very willing to help in any way. In San Diego the staff was always friendly and willing to bring food to you, clear plates, offer refills of drinks etc. They also don't offer bread with your meal which is a MAJOR disappointment.

Steak was great. The salad was overdressed, veggies were quite salty and not sure if it's new company policy or just this branch but they didn't give out their famous yummy toasted slice of bread. This might be a fine salad place if you haven't had it out West, but for me, this is but a sad shadow of TG back in LA.",1,,
27,Kristin L.,"Manhattan, NY",122,88,17,5.0,3/14/2018,"With one of the busiest lines I've seen during the lunch rush, I was impressed by how the cashiers at Tender Greens handled the pressure. They were quick, professional, and untiringly friendly. I wasn't expecting my portions to be as large as they were. When I caught sight of my plate of steak, potatoes, and arugula plate being carried out, I shed a little tear. For a mere $15, I ate like a queen.The arugula was so tasty and fresh that even I, as opposed to veggies as I've been all my life, licked the plate clean. The mashed potatoes took me to a warm and soft carb heaven. And the steak, which I had asked to be cooked medium-rare, did not disappoint. I hate when steak is gummy, hard to cut, and harder to swallow. But this steak offered little resistance to my knife. It was thin and cooked to perfection. For $15, I couldn't have asked for more and I'll definitely be back, although I'll advise that you avoid lunch time at 12PM through 1PM.",3,1,2
28,Brittany T.,"Manhattan, NY",1333,781,1447,4.0,2/21/2018,"Yay! Tender Greens has come to New York! Being from California, I've been wondering when Tender Greens will make it's way East.  For those that have never tried it, it reminds me of a mix between Sweetgreen and Dig Inn because they have salads and they have plates where you can choose a main and a side.WAIT: Came on a Sunday afternoon around 2:00 pm and the place was super crowded! We waited about 5 minutes before being able to order and then it took about 10 or so minutes until the food came out.ATMOSPHERE: It's pretty spacious inside so for larger groups you may have a bit of a hard time but there is definitely space. There are tables you can bring together, a bench style table in the front, seated bar like seating that faces the kitchen and then these stool standing/type counters that are super narrow and can't fit 2 people sitting across from each other.  The kitchen is open so you can see inside and how they prepare the food, which is cool.  It's a very open space, high ceilings.FOOD: I like that they have different options where you can do the meat plus 2 sides or you can do a sandwich or a salad.  The prices here are around $13 so not super cheap but about the same you would pay at Sweetgreen or Dig Inn normally. The menu is a little confusing at first so may take some time to figure out what you want.CHIPOTLE CHICKEN SANDWICH - my favorite sandwich! It comes on a toasted ciabatta so it's almost like a warm sandwich with chunks of tender and juicy chicken and bell peppers and a chipotle sauce.  The sauce isn't spicy but is a type of mayo/aioli that offers flavor and makes the sandwich less dry.  The bread is slightly crispy and soft inside.  It also comes with your choice of side or a salad so I got the arugula salad, which was a nice touch.  It comes with cheese on top.Overall, I really enjoy tender greens and would come again and suggest everyone try it!",7,2,9

I couldn't decide if I wanted a salad or a sandwich, so I asked if they had any combo that included both. The very sweet, but very confused cashier rung me up for a salad and a sandwich (almost $30), when I said no, that's not what I was asking for, it was quickly wiped away. I then asked for a chipotle chicken salad. When I got back to my office, it wasn't a salad at all, but a serving of chipotle chicken by itself with rice and brussels sprouts on the side. While I did like the way everything tasted, it wasn't what I ordered. I'd have gone back, but it was raining and I was a bit exhausted by the whole process. Here's to hoping they get the kinks worked out and I can get exactly what I wish for next time I swing by.",18,7,10

They quickly brought over some niceass china + metal utensils for me! Kinda love that they have that for their patrons who choose to dine in. It really elevates the experience!The food itself was great! The chicken was incredibly juicy and bursting with flavor. The California sprouted rice was sooooo good. Coulda ate more than a little cup of that! I thought the portions were a little small for the price, but I could tell everything was made with quality ingredients and super healthy. I'd come back!",2,1,1
31,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",475,398,981,5.0,2/9/2018,"I cannot say enough good things about this place- the service, the fresh food, and the interior. Roy is so knowledgeable and talented. He's  AMAZING and took care of me and informed me so much about this place- from its history to its ingredients/menu. The people here are so friendly and sweet, plus the food is delish! Lobster ($16)- 5/5 This salad was really delicious, although I did wish they put a little more lobster in there. It was a little citrusy and had apples that were also quite tasty. Happy Vegan ($13)-5/5 This was an interesting plate-everything on it tasted absolutely delicious and plus it's vegan! I fell in love with the green hummus. It's quite refreshing due to the citrus.  Falafel ($12.50)-5/5 I'm not a big fan of tzatziki, but I think this may have changed the way I think. The falafel was surprisingly very green in the inside and tasted great with sauces! Tuna Nicoise ($14)-5/5 Oh my. This was one tasty fish! So many ingredients that I love in a salad-capers, potatoes, tomato, and olives! YUM. Serrano Grilled Shrimp bowl ($14.50)-5/5 This bowl is slightly spicy, shrimp were delicious & loved the sauce! Fresh Baked Cookie ($2.50)-5/5 I got a chocolate chip cookie and it was oddly one of the best cookies I've had before... They give these huge chocolate chip chunks and if it was warmed up.. it would have been even better. Green Monster-5/5 It's healthy and yummy, what more can I say?",17,9,14

At first when you walk in you are greeted and given a menu to glance at while you wait to order. After looking over the menu I ordered the 'Serrano grilled shrimp bowl' . It was listed under the salads but it was not your typical salad as it had shrimp, rice, autumn squash, poblano chile, cabbage and brussels sprout. Delicious pairing of flavors!!! Rice was cooked al dente, squash was not too soggy and shrimp was super fresh. Very healthy food, keeps you full and tastes great. The space itself is also attractive. Eclectic clean, retro looking decor. The staff was also very friendly and attentive. I would def come back!!!",1,1,1

35,Rob W.,"Brooklyn, NY",219,347,521,4.0,2/26/2018,"Nice new fast/casual/healthy place with an interesting, diverse menu. You can either build a salad with a protein (including falafel for full vegetarian) and a lettuce type for $12.50-$15, or try some of their fixed menu salads or sandwiches. Have wanted to try them on Caviar, but they have an exorbitant delivery fee, so was happy to be in the 'hood recently to finally try out in person. Menu seems readonably creative --the happy vegan salad with farro, hazelnut, beet & green hummus sounded amazing--but I simply had to try the lobster salad. While I think the whole ""deconstructed food item X"" concept is overused, this really felt like a deconstructed lobster roll--and a lighter, fresher, still incredibly tasty lobster roll at that. With the celery slaw, citrus breadcrumbs mixed with orange/lemon zest and tarragon dressing, it was a fresh delight that incorporated a mélange of flavors reminiscent of a roll-free lobster roll. My friend had only the roasted tomato soup, but really enjoyed. Came in at lunch and it felt mobbed, but line went quickly, and was easy to find a table. They are credit card only--i realize someday soon I'll be the one cranky old person grousing about this, but I don't like payment method dictated to me and have a hard time accepting that any place can define cash as non-acceptable tender. Staff and service was unbelievably--almost eerily--enthusiastic. I'm reading now that this is an L.A. chain, so...that makes a little more sense. I mean, I'll never demand poor service, but this is New York. It's ok to be a tad jaded, and you don't have to pretend that opening a door to greet me has been the absolute apex of your day.",1,2,2
36,Nav D.,"Boston, MA",9,121,158,5.0,3/13/2018,This was a spur of the moment decision.  Had about 1/2 hour to eat something quick before the start time of our movie.  Tender Greens was literally next to our theatre so we decided to give it a try thinking it was something like SweetGreen.Boy were we wrong.  Its not like SweetGreen (not that this is bad and I love SweetGreen too) but we were pleasantly surprised.First things first: a ghost pepper biscuit?  Are we serious?  This is a must have.  I also ordered the fried chicken which was seasoned wonderfully and fried to perfection.  All of this comes out pretty quick which means this is a no-brainer when you're considering Chipotle and the like.,1,,

One of the things I loved immediately was the menu -- it felt different than the other fast casual lunch spots in the neighborhood, in a great way. If you're a fan of Dig Inn or Sweetgreen, this place is a nice way to switch things up while still feeling like you're making a healthy choice. I had a duck salad that tasted and looked fresh! Sadly, it was a daily special so I'm not sure when it'll be back on the menu but I'm excited to try out other daily specials and the rest of the menu. The line moved pretty quickly during lunch, probably because of the cashless system, though I waited a bit for my food. At one point, I think the staff noticed me tracking all the people in line behind me who got their food before me. That said, the staff was super attentive, knew my order number and offered me water while I waited.",2,,

Salmon was cooked well and the sprouted rice was seasoned perfectly. The salt and pepper chicken was also moist and tender. However, the last three times I ordered from here the chicken was way over cooked and very dry. Portions are significantly smaller and the rice was very oily and salty. This place is a lot more expensive than Dig Inn and portions are very small. You definitely do not get your moneys worth here.",,,

43,Mark H.,"Manhattan, NY",45,502,4,4.0,3/10/2018,"I did a triple take last week when I saw the words ""Tender Greens"" staring at me from across the street.  In San Diego, where I spend three weeks each year, I'm a near-quotidian regular at Tender Greens downtown and love the local ingredients prepared simply, with an open kitchen and fresh ingredients on view for all to see.  So I was thrilled to see one in NYC and visited twice for lunch.While the thumping music was too loud, and the area to queue and order at the registers is a bit disorienting as you enter - once, a few people didn't seem to know where to find menus and there was an ""are you in line?"" vibe - this is close to what I love in the California restaurants, if not quite there.  You don't quite walk past the fresh ingredients and specials of the day splayed out in front of you on the way to get your food, sadly, but local farms and dairies (which are identified, thank you very much!) are still supplying food to the restaurant.The backyard steak, grilled medium-rare, with mashed potatoes was on point, and the butter lettuce salad was fresh, crisp, and cool, though slightly over-salted.  In San Diego there are beautiful plates and bowls that look inspired by homemade pottery and compliment the food nicely.  Here in NY the plates are pure white and large, and didn't quite flatter the smaller serving I received on my second visit.I still look forward to returning and sampling the salt and pepper chicken, the tomato/basil soup, and some local beer on tap.  I wonder if the fresh vegetables are as tasty as the beautiful produce that comes out of Southern California, but I'm grateful for the locavore attitude of this place nonetheless and will definitely be back.",,,
44,Julia C.,"New York, NY",40,44,24,3.0,10/7/2018,"I had the salt and pepper chicken with one side of grilled veggies ( supposed to be squash,  mushroom and carrots ) and soup( beef with veggies).  The soup was the best part of the meal.  It had lots of ingredients and the favor was real.    The veggie had a missing part.  Not until I inquired,  the server would not tell me the mushroom was missing.  The squash were thin cuts,  but they were too thin for grilling and ended up mostly burnt.  The chicken had hardly any peppers for most part of it and a little dried for some part of it.  I think the consistency is question here.  The first day I came a few days ago,  it was terrific.  Then,  today,  a Sunday,  it had burnt squash and missing mushroom. The chicken needs some sort of sauce to compliment it when needed and when Comes to slicing, definitely cut the veggies thicker -if burnt,  at least I can cut off the burnt part and eat them,  now I have to trash them.  It is not easy to do mass production of grills with thin slices.",,,

47,Tom C.,"New York, NY",133,247,361,3.0,7/2/2018,"West coast import that's billed as a fast casual ""healthy"" alternative. I liken it to a Sweet Green plus, they salads but also offer plates and sandwiches. You order as you enter then find a seat and wait for your food. The menu is a little confusing at first so do mull over what you might want before you get to the cashier. There's often longer lines during peek dinning hours but it tends to move quick. They offer an app that lets you order ahead to bypass the lines and it works fairly great. It also lets you earn loyalty rewards if you plan to frequently the chain. You can use my referral code: ""TomChen8484"" when signing up in the app to get a free cookie and drink. In full discourse, I will also get a free cookie when you use the code. The space is large and airy with plenty of seating. If you are dining in, food is served to you at your table but I don't believe tipping is necessary. Service is usually quick and very friendly. The food is decent, but nothing to rave about. I don't really consider their offering healthy, they offer fried chicken after all but it's a step above fast food. Expect to pay $14+ for a meal here, comparable to Sweet Greens and the like in the city.",,,
48,Mary R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,1,5.0,10/9/2018,"Hands-down, my favorite for healthy fast-casual in Manhattan. They have plates (a meat and choice of 2 sides), salads and sandwiches,  beer and wine. I like them over Sweetgreens or Honeygrow bc they have more, better options for protein. They have steak, albacore, salmon, and several types of chicken. This is their only New York location (it's primarily a West coast chain) so it gets super crowded at lunch. Download their app so you can pre-order and skip the lines. Also it is expensive for fast-casual, but you get what you pay for. Hope to see more New York locations soon!",,,

There's some unhelpful, grumpy people working here, but there's also some incredibly nice ones who go out of their way as well.Went here for dinner and their specials of the day seemed intriguing enough! My friend ordered a beef polenta dish and a side of chicken noodle soup. I ordered a monk fish dish with mushrooms and green beans. When our dishes arrived, hers was on the smaller side, but looked good. We were both a bit taken back by how much food I got, or rather, little food. I regret not taking a photo, but it was maybe 6-7 small green beans with 3 pieces of fried fish that were 30% smaller than McDonald's chicken nuggets, surrounded by 8ish slivers of mushrooms over a small bed of jus. This dish was $17.96!!! We'll get back to this.The beef polenta special was good. The beef was cooked well and stringy, had flavor, and balanced well with the polenta. Was a tad bit salty overall.The chicken noodle soup was quite tasty with a surprising amount of chicken and vegetables.The monkfish special tasted good. Hate using this word, but there was a quite of a bit of umami in the dish from the jus. It was also a bit on the salty side. Was it worth $17.96? Absolutely not. I had to order a side to be even remotely filled. I chose the seasonal veggies, which ended up being a mix of oily, sauteed root vegetables. The amount of oil was off-putting and definitely not worth $6.Someone came around and asked how the food was to which I asked about the size of my dish and was told the dinner specials are meant to be more like fine dining. If I wanted fine dining, don't think I'd go to a fast-casual restaurant for that.The specials were around $16-20 and portioned very lightly. The cooking quality, although a little salty, is there, but they should need to be 1.5x larger portions to be worth it and actually filling.

By 11:30, no food was out and they kept saying it was coming. ""5 minutes baby don't worry!""  I'm usually very patient but by 12:50 there was no food. I asked, ""do you have anything for Aaron yet?"" They said they don't have anything for me. I'm like - yo I've been here for 45 minutes what do you mean?? Why wouldn't you say this earlier? I showed her the order numbers on the app (that were marked as COMPLETED).

I had spelled it out and given her my last name MULTIPLE TIMES. It was everything I could do not to flip out. An hour later at 1:15 we got our food. She offered us 1 free drink even though I was with my 3 friends and she'd just wasted an hour of our time.Not going back. Total shame because I love this place.",,,
75,Iris B.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,11,24,3.0,2/14/2018,"I was excited to try this place as it's heavily hyped and it's literally right around the corner from where I work. There was greeter at the door who opened the door for you which I thought was a nice and welcoming touch. There was a bit of a line but it went quickly and efficiently. I ordered the salt and pepper chicken with Kale salad and mashed potatoes. The total came to $15 and change. The Kale was fresh and I really enjoyed the dressing that came with it. The mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious and my favorite part of the dish. The chicken, which is technically supposed to be the star of the dish was a bit dry (not over cooked, more like it was under the heat lamp a little to long) and and the portion was on the smaller side. Not the driest chicken I've ever had but for $15 and all the hype it was a bit of a disappointment.  I regularly patron Digg In and Sweet Green which cost about the same are more satisfying in my opinion. That being said, I will try it again and order a different protein to see if the experience is better and adjust my rating accordingly.",1,,

Kale was bit salty just like in California but steak was flavorful, tender and large portion size. Well worth the $14 for quality of prep and ingredients.

I've been to Tendergreens many times in LA (50+ times) and this doesn't even do it justice. First of all, the amount of food is so little. I ordered a harvest salad and the container wasn't even a quarter full. There was so little greens that I asked them if that was normal so they were nice enough to add more- a whole 3-4 leaves more. Really?? The chicken was also tough and rubbery and I got a lot of the greasy skin in my salad rather than actual chicken meat. I would never go back- total waste of money. The location looks nice and it's clean but when your food sucks, how do you stay in business? I should have known when I walked in today at lunch time and there were only 3 customers.

The quality was mostly consistent. That was in California.Fast forward, here I am sitting at Tender Greens in NYC. I ordered a plate of fried chicken and expected similar quality. After all, food chains are known for consistent production and quality, right?Plate: Instead, I was served with only one piece of fried chicken. The protein was seasoned entirely differently. It was over-fried, turning too brown and dried, yet still not crispy. Compared to CA, I was served one less piece of over-fried and dried protein which tasted salty.Side salad: My side salad, butter lettuce, was served in huge pieces, requiring me to cut them into smaller and edible bite sizes. Compared to CA, this made my dining experience less pleasant. Side dish: The roasted parsnips were overly seasoned and too salty. Where is the recommended 2,300mg sodium per day? On this entire plate! Thanks for increasing the risk of getting heart disease, whoever-changed-the-recipe-for-NYC-Tender-Greens. Compared to CA, this is much saltier.Overall, it is very disappointing experience; not to mention that the Tender Greens here didn't serve a piece of toasted bread. Yes, we get a piece of delicious bread in CA.I wish they didn't open in New York because it's not even 50% close to what we get served in California.

My fiancé tried some too because I thought maybe I was just imagining things, but he got the grittiness also. I called them 3 times to let them know that their salad wasn't properly washed to prevent others from eating salad with dirt in it, but the phone just rang out because nobody answered.

Given that it lunch, I got there a few minutes late at about 12:23 and figured I'd find my lunch that I ordered ar 11:45 and just go. I was briefly greeted by an employee who was trying to handle the deluge of meal pal orders, spoke with another employee, and then waited. I didn't get my lunch until 12:40. I wasted a good chunk of my lunch break waiting. The employee with the meal pal list asked if I wanted a drink with it and I said no as I already had my drinks from a different place. It seems like the restaurant has been ill prepared to handle the deluge of meal pal customers which then greatly affects the rest of us. I have no issues with the employees themselves, but definitely feel like the management team needs to organize this better so people can actually get their food on time.

Usually you get steak at a place like dig inn and you lower your standards because you know it won't be that good. This steak at tender greens was so good my girlfriend was annoyed that I kept talking about how good it was. She had the tuna, which was also really good! Couldn't believe the quality for the price. Going back tonight for the Fried Chicken and Mashed Potatoes which looked and smelled legit. Also - the service was great. Roy, the South African manager or chef  - was so helpful.

I came on a Sunday night, around 6:30 and it was about half full with two lines and two people ahead of me. My boyfriend and I got two plates, one soup and extra one side and we waited about 25 minutes before saying something. Since they have an open kitchen, we watched as plates with only lettuce in them accumulated on the service line. Not saying that they kitchen staff was being lazy, there were actually people cooking and two people running back and forth, with no food actually coming out. During my wait, I went up to the cashier asking for a cup of water and she seemed so appalled for asking for a cup of water, saying, ""One cup of water, that's it?"" after I had told her I was waiting for my order. We finally got our food after watching both the register and kitchen staff flounder and got our food after going up to the counter. I had to reheat my food at home so I would consider it to be mildly good, even with my steak being super bloody with blood running allover my plate (another reason I had to reheat). It was also super disappointing that the mashed potato side serving, which tasted really good, was only half full. I'll go back if I'm really craving it, but definitely not for a while.

120,Sebastian l.,"Manhattan, NY",3,31,0,3.0,4/24/2018,"Tender Greens is like two completely different restaurants depending on when you visit. I work in the area so often stop in for lunch. During the week, it's a 5/5, even during the busy lunch rush. The service is attentive, the food comes out quickly (and the order is always correct) and everything is always delicious. Come the weekend, it's a different story - 2/5. I've brought my husband here three times after raving about how great it is, and each time he has left wondering what I was talking about, and I don't blame him. Each time has been a mess. Food comes out in bits and pieces, with one of us always receiving our entree 5-10 minutes before the other. This inevitably gets cold by the time the other entree arrives, not to mention the torture of staring at a dish but refraining from eating it out of politeness! On two occasions a side has appeared several minutes after the entree it was ordered with. The last time we visited, my chicken was dry and overcooked, and an extra side of dressing ordered didn't appear at all until we flagged someone down to request it. (Speaking of dressing, they've gotten very skimpy with it. Salads used to be dressed perfectly, but now the greens are so barely dressed it tastes as though there's no dressing at all - hence the need to preemptively request extra.) Needless to say, after three attempts, it's off our list. I'm not sure what the difference is. I've noticed the chef is around during the week, so maybe his presence is a factor. Or maybe they're just not able to serve two as efficiently as they can serve one. In any case, I recommend this place for solo weekday dining. I highly advise against it on weekends and with two or more diners.",1,,

Unfortunately, the side of vegetables was composed of 3 pieces of asparagus, 3 sugar snap peas and 3 cut up pieces of squash. My meal cost $24.

122,Lila N.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",0,2,0,2.0,9/6/2018,"Having a very bad run with this chain. Tonight I order a steak sandwich with no aioli for take-out. Doublne checked with the cashier that she got the no aioli part and saw her enter it. My order was called when it was ready, and even announced theo aioli party. When I picked it up I STILL double checked with the woman I picked it up from that there was no aioli because I cannot eat aioli. Got home - aioli was all over the sandwich, smeared on every single piece of bread so I couldn't even eat it open faced (I'm not able to eat aioli). This happens from time to time anywhere, but this is my third bad experience with Tender Greens in as many trips and as many locations, both in NY and LA. The aioli thing happened the last time I ordered a sandwich there, though it was an LA location. The time before that a CHUNK OF GLASS in my drink and the restaurant was remarkably casual about handling it. They didn't follow up for days and when they followed up all they told me was that if I found out it had caused internal injuries it was okay because THEY have insurance.

The flank steak is well cooked to a medium rare finish, but is a tad tough. This could be fixed by cutting thinner or marinating, the quality of the meat is not the issue.  The lemonade with mint has all the right notes,  not too sweet or bitter, very good. There is also a pineapple flavored drink that is also good.   The chocolate  chip cookie is made in house with enough chocolate to make Jacques Torres happy. Met Peter the chef from California on the way out.  He, like his whole and I mean whole staff is all smiles, attentive and proud to say that the pasta was made by him early that day and as we were talking they were erasing the chalkboard as the pasta Bolognese was sold out.

129,Alison S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,4.0,2/9/2018,"The food here is really delicious. It seems like anyone could figure out a meal that would work for him or her ( or they!). I think it would be good for a diverse group looking for a place to eat. It is a little hard to figure out how to order at first but once you get the hang of the system it is easy peasy.  I had a steak salad and my friend had a fried chicken sandwich and a lobster salad ( he wanted to try both).  All of it great. The casual vibe doesn't mean fast food (yeah!) or fast food prices. The price point is interesting. It seems a wee bit high but I wonder if that is b/c Danny Meyer is part of the no-tipping, everyone makes the same model.That said the service was really good and the people really nice.   The price wouldn't keep me from going back....it just wouldn't be one of my go-to quick/inexpensive meal joints.",,,
130,Lindsay D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,31,0,3.0,6/26/2018,"I am so torn on how to review this place.  On the one hand, all components on my plate are really tasty.  On the other hand, this is not a place for a salad lover; and I, friends, am a salad lover.  If you call a salad a ""Vegan Delight"" and charge $13 for it, I expect a bunch of mushy things on top of lettuce.  Like, a lot of lettuce.  I want lettuce in every bite, as lettuce is the bedrock of a salad.  When my order came up, the clamshell container looked full enough, but there were like 5 leaves of butter lettuce.  I first confirmed that this was in fact a salad (as I had seen many people eating platters in the restaurant).  I then requested more lettuce, which still was insufficient, but I didn't want to be a lunatic ranting about leafy greens during the lunch rush. I believe Richard P., below, commented that he isn't a salad fan and loves this place; that TOTALLY makes sense to me.  If you're looking for a clean tasting, Dig Inn-style platter, this place looks awesome.  If you want a big bowl of roughage, as I have come to desire, I suggest you look elsewhere.",,,
131,CP G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,1.0,8/1/2018,"today, i placed an order online at 11:39am for a pickup at 12:15pm. i knew it would be late so i walked into pick up my order at 12:29. my order wasn't there, i asked one of the employees who asked me what my name was and disappeared. i waited another 5 minutes before someone else asked me what my name was. she came back saying that the item i ordered was no longer available on the menu as of yesterday and asked if I wanted something else. I asked why I wasn't notified and she said they were too busy. At that point, I had placed my order over an hour prior and I wanted my money back. I asked for a refund and she disappeared again! i saw her tending to other peoples orders and got frustrated so I asked one of the women at the register if they could assist me with a refund, at which point the original woman came back and said ""she is gonna give you a refund."" I asked who 'she' was and asked for a receipt or an email confirming that. She disappeared AGAIN and the woman she was talking to came over to me. This woman, Tyler, said that she apologizes but they no longer have that menu item and they meant to call me but they were too busy. (They weren't too busy to CHARGE me for it.) she then proceeded to tell me that she is too busy to ISSUE ME A REFUND and will call me later to get my email to send me a receipt of the refund. I told her that is ridiculous, she obviously has my email on the order since she had emailed me a confirmation in the first place! I stormed out, nothing resolved. The charge is still there and I never got my lunch.this was a completely ridiculous situation - I placed an order an hour before I went to pick it up and there was plenty of time to contact me and tell me I wasn't going to be getting my order, instead of me standing there waiting like an idiot. The fact that they were too busy to call me is bullshit. And the fact that they were then too busy to refund me is even more bullshit. I will be contacting my credit card company and I will never be coming back to tender greens again. completely irresponsible and ridiculous customer experience.",,,
