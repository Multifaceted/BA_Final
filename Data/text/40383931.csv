0,None Of Your Business B.,"New York, NY",0,14,0.0,3.0,3/30/2018,"The place is a little more mellow than some of the other well-known, bigger chain strip clubs in NYC. I've heard it described as ""dive-y"" but I wouldn't say that, I'd think it's a bit more humble, with less commotion and definitely less music that vibrates off the walls and would scare off anyone older as some of the other places. Now, as to the issues. The place is known internationally around the stripper circuit for hiring workers who are not authorized to work in the United States. I worked here several years ago while visiting the city, and got hired again by male management after having recently moved here. The dark-haired, olive-skinned, gaunt, older woman doing orientation had issue with me. There was a forty year old woman with a Japanese passport sitting next to me during this process, who was also a new hire. She could not even speak English, which I found pretty pathetic but also unfair to someone like myself, as someone who had to go through great lengths to get my Greencard and then my American passport. The woman doing the orientation seemed angry because she kept bending my passport which I provided as my id for employment-I thought the passport would break. She would not let me read the contract, and she started nitpicking about the dumbest things such as the way my signature was signed or the initials I used to designate my identity on each one of the bullet points of the contract and just, talking down to me. Her words were, ""Do you know how many times we've been sued? This has to be done this way for legal reasons..."" This was way past her making the non-English-speaking Japanese woman go and start working, with nothing but a quick scribble over the independent contract agreement. Like, so sketch... An older male, probably owner, came up to me and said to the witch lady, ""Well, if she is not cooperating, maybe this isn't the right place for you."" So after waiting around for orientation for an hour, I got fired right on the spot. My suggestion is if you stop down talking to your independent contract workers, and treating them like employees, maybe you won't get sued so much. Or otherwise, you can always hire non-Americans who are not authorized to work in the US, who you can fine $200 upon $200 each time they miss a shift consecutively even if they bring in a doctor's note, keep the vast majority of the room fees charged to the customer (dancer keeps 200 out of 2000 room, for example and fees to work nightly are approximately 200), and whatever else ya'll do that you shouldn't. If you are a customer, this is a good place to see Eastern European girls. Also, now it looks like there are a mix of Latin Americans to the mix.  It's a really nice location too. Among the New Yorkers on a budget who also work in the area, it's known to be a favorite spot for getting single dances. One caveat is if you, as a customer, have any ethical qualms about this place hiring workers who are not authorized to work in the US and doing so so that they can be exploited more so than otherwise, you might want to go to a different club.",7,1,1
1,Lisa R.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,13,1,1.0,5/29/2018,"My boyfriend and I wanted a little fun after dinner last night, and although the venue is decent enough, the women were ravenous-- and I don't mean that as a compliment. I danced my way through college, so there's absolutely no disrespect, but these girls quite literally swarm tables like they can smell the shiny plastic in customers' wallets. My boyfriend politely declined to buy a dancer a drink, since we had already spent a decent amount on dances and liquor. The dancer told him he was cheap, and not a gentleman. Seriously? There are smaller clubs with less abrasive women and a more relaxing ambiance. Flashdancers was anything but relaxing.",8,1,
2,David K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/5/2018,"This place is on W45th street and no where to park at all and a tiny dive.    There is no VIP anything, zero customer service.   Agree that the dancers are money hungry most likely as there main location recently closed down.   The staff was nasty and sour.Dont Go",,,
3,Pete M.,"Garden City, NY",0,1,0,1.0,9/16/2018,"I just read in the NY Post Page six that Flashdancers did not get a new lease so they will be closing in October. Sapphire will be leasing and renovating this space and open a premier strip club here. Cannot wait.I stopped coming here years ago. There used to be a lot of beautiful European dancers that used to know how to dance. Nowadays, the girls are either average or way below average. Maybe, since the owner is pretty old his eye sight has gone really bad.Even the bouncers expect tips at this place or they get nasty with you.The ownership forces the dancers to go to the backrooms with the customers where the customer pays $685 to $2,500 per 50 minutes to rent a room. Those are the prices that a hostess will quote to you if they see that you are interested in a particular girl.Don't go to this place. They are just exploiting the girls. Wait for the grand opening of Sapphire .. just in time for the holidays.",4,1,2

I will not be returning to this establishment for this reason and this reason alone.  You got money go ahead and have fun but this place was not for me.",3,4,

I disliked the bathroom due to the fact that it was inside the strippers changing room, which made it a bit annoying to go in since they are trying to get ready and it's a small area. Do I recommend? No.",5,2,
9,Jiho S.,"New York, NY",74,528,127,5.0,12/3/2016,"I don't see why people give this place 1 star. It's a NYC institution as far as I'm concerned. Midtown Manhattan, close to everything, open late till 4, nice intimate comfortable space, and a bevy of girls willing to please you with their lap dances. This place used to be a haven for Eastern Europeans and Russians but I've noticed it's diversified these days. Talent is still great and in my opinion the best strip club in Manhattan. Drinks are crazy expensive but what do you expect? 2 rules - always carry cash and never get flash cash (fees). Live by those and you'll be fine. Thursday and Fridays are peak (business crowd) and Saturday is full of Bridge and Tunnel. Can get ridiculously crowded but hey it's Manhattan. Also Halal Guys is around the corner and is my go to right after around 3-4am (53rd and 7th).",5,2,4

We experienced some pressure for private lap dances, which was awkward but nothing aggressive. I tried to take a Snap to send my friend, and was almost kicked out. But I just flashed my titties and got away with it. Just kidding.

17,Michelle B.,"Basking Ridge, NJ",4,15,13,3.0,6/27/2017,"As a lover of breasts, this place is okay. The best strip club I ever went to was in Vegas so compared to that it's hard to rate this place highly. The girls had nice bodies but were not especially exotic or pretty no offense. The music was ok. There were a good amount of people watching  - not too many and not too few. The waitress was super friendly which I loved. A few of the stripper were very friendly too. I am a woman and just went for fun. I am not a creepy person so I found it easy to just watch like it was a movie and have a good time. However, the men there were creepy toward me. The bouncers were cool. The bathroom was the strippers changing room which was cool but also kind of weird and not very classy. One stripper also talked to me about how she does not like her job which did not make the experience magical or anything just sad. Their dancing was boring a bit. I would recommend this place if you HAD to choose one in the city. But I recommend Vegas a thousand times more. Those girls were pretty and the whole place was packed and bumpinnnnn. This one was eh but not as bad as one other one I went to in the city. But you go girls",4,3,

I was going to feel how people in Manhattan enjoy their nightlife, but now I realize that the typical New Yorkers don't know how to enjoy.I spent $20 for entry and $15 for a drink, that's okay. What bugs the most me was that the girls there suck at dancing. Even I dance better with a pole on the metro, and I'm a shy dude!Also, the girls here treated me like I'm invisible. Maybe it's my fault, since I went there alone. But come on! I'm a customer. The guy who was sitting next to me was also alone, he got a massage first, then a dance. Maybe because he looks richer than me?Overall, this is the worst strip club I've ever been to, and I rarely use the word 'worst' when it involves boobs. I didn't talked to anyone over there, and that made me question my own manhood... Even pooping is more fun than staying at this place!",8,13,2

Went with a female friend, and she didn't feel uncomfortable, and had a good time. Beer is pricey, with a couple of Budlight beers coming to 25$. Didn't get much attention for sometime, maybe because I was with a girl. Got asked once afterwards if I wanted a lap dance, wasn't in the mood then. Polite refusal didn't invite any undue pressure. That was nice. Liked one finally and got it for 20$ plus a 10$ tip. Dancer was willing to talk and personalize. Did get poked and pressured a bit by one girl to tip when I sat close to the stage. Hence not giving a 5-star. Had read earlier reviews on site, and so, didn't pay by credit card.",,,

Only good thing are lap dances are $20, but expect EVERY girl to ask for a tip and you are an asshole if you don't tip and might get kicked out.

I went sigh lolWe went late afternoon on a saturday... cool bartenders had a great conversation that they thanked us for, you know we're cool guys def not sleazy so they appreciated that. And most guys hardly ever talk to them as they are focused on the dancers. There's two polls behind the bar on either side and the girls rotate in and out, they barely prance...one dancer had a lot of energy and clearly tries to enjoy herself - we thanked her, she thanked us. Most of the dancers acted bored, no real enthusiasm. We got hit up for dances every 30 secs once a girl left our side. Rubbing your arms, and thighs, asking for kisses. It's nice to have female attention but of course it's not genuine. Got a $20 lap dance. Girl was pretty and had a body built for *******!!! WOW!!! She got called to the stage. Told me to go back to the bar. She danced, she came back and got me and finished the song. Songs were fast but she was a hotty!!! I actually tipped the bathroom guy more than the dancers lol.Only real negative was the price. Bought my buddy a round, bought the bartender a round and maybe bout myself 2 no more than 3 drinks (one drink came from the bartender I didn't ask for...maybe she charged me I thought she wasn't)... Let's call it 5 drinks but should have been 4, whatever it was the bill came to $90 + 16 tip automatically added...I was pissed. We pre gamed for this very reason and still dropped a hundred on drinks...(I took 4 of of us out for Italian food on the lower east side and spent less for 4 dinners and wine than I did for 4-5 drinks here... D$MN)*Note to self... what did you expect lol!!!!!**Bartender admitted the manager/owner was overcharging, ruined our great chat hahaha but it's cool. Had fun, only live once! ***agree with another post: ""A lot of fun, but they are very, very efficient at separating you from your money. Appeals mostly to tourists.""",3,,1
27,Paul D.,"Wichita, KS",0,2,0,3.0,3/25/2015,"First off, logistics: I went late on a Tuesday night. The cover was $20, which seemed reasonable for Manhattan. Drinks are pretty pricey. $15 for a mixed drink. I paid more for a drink at a bar in the city, but I paid a lot less at some other spots (none with dancing girls though). If you want to get lit, pregame somewhere else.I appreciate the hours, open until 4am even on a Tuesday night.They push the services a lot. Starts with a massage (which is just a shoulder rub). I'm not sure what kind of charge they put on that. Lap dances for $20 (pretty low compared to similar services at cheaper clubs).They offer private rooms. Basically, private time with a girl for an hour where nobody is bothering you or creeping on you. Once you're there, expect to have drinks pushed on you, and the talent will encourage you tip to generously. Add all that to the $600 price tag.Otherwise, the dancers on stage are not pushy when it comes to tips. They do push other services fairly aggressively.$3 coat check, which seemed to be enforced unevenly. Maybe I looked like I was bringing in some hardware.Personal impressions: the location is decent, on Broadway near Times Square. The doorman was a nice touch compared to places that only have bouncers to great you. Overall the staff was friendly and helpful. They even had a girl escort me to a table in front of the stage. I lost my table the first time I got up to get a dance, but it was a nice touch.The stage work was nothing special. Virtually no pole work and little enthusiasm. It is difficult to be really bothered because the girls are gorgeous. The worst of them was on par with the best at some of the best clubs I've visited. The girls at the club back home have nothing on these girls. The flavor is strongly Eastern European. There were a few Asian girls in the mix as well. This is a topless club (being in New York). That didn't bother me since this is a classy place with classy ladies.I had a great time. The constant sales pitch makes it difficult to just sit back and watch the show. But the girls are friendly and beautiful. The show isn't much to watch anyway. If you want to see something spin around a pole, you need a little ratchet. This place doesn't seem to have that.Good place if you want to spend some time with a nice lady. Not great for a place to drink and watch the show.I fell in love with one of those girls. I don't know what she did or how but I walked out with no cash and grinning like a fool. She played the game and I appreciate her for it. Sometimes it is nice to see someone who enjoys their job and puts real effort into their art.Girls: 5 starsThe show: 2 starsPrice: 3 starsAtmosphere: 3 starsExtras: 3 starsOverall, I give it 3 stars. A better stage show would push it up to 4 pretty quick, but I can't give 4 to a place that doesn't offer a quality show.",4,2,2

Cost: This place is dirt cheap compared to others. I can just ball out and only be spending a measly $3000. Now for the most important part. The girls:These girls are all 12/10's. You will not find hotter girls than these. Not even actresses or models can even hope to compare. They hooked me in with their beautiful features and captivated my heart with their personality and intelligence. I felt a real connection with every woman and man I met there.

The things we liked about the bar was that it was clean (or at least looked it), and my wife enjoyed getting a massage from one of the hottest girls while she took it all in.Some of the reviews are gushing about the quality of the girls but I have to say that most of the girls wouldn't make the grade in Vegas. I didn't see any girl with the full package - pretty, bum, boobs. They either had one or the other, maybe two out of 3 if you were lucky. There were an amazing number of girls with no boobs, or very small boobs.......hmmmmm...... they're called stripper boobs for a reason....In the couple of hours we were there we barely saw any girls who knew what the pole was for, and those that did weren't any good at it. They might need to watch a few music videos.Place was was straight up extortion on a couple of fronts - firstly I don't mind paying cover, but charging attractive women a cover to come in seems odd to me.

Is it expensive?? You bet your paycheck it is but when you only go once in a blue I say go big, what am I gonna go to some lil dink joint with girls with prosthetic legs? Plus there is nothing funner than paying 18 bucks for a Vodka with Red Bull!     As for the place itself the main reason you go is the ladies and they are all very hot. You get a nice mix of races so whatever youre into there is sure to be a girl that fits your taste. Lots of Eastern European and Latin girls and happy to say alot more Asian girls as well. The girls are usually pretty nice and dont hassle you too much. The waitresses are actually as hot as the dancers and even nicer and the fact that they have a massage therapist walking around is cool. The sushi is actually pretty good as the place ""Osama"" (I know bad name) operates on its own but the waitress will bring you a menu and deliver your order right to your table.  The music is what you would expect to hear but sometimes they pull out some great old 80's tunes, guess it depends on the DJ. It's located near alot of train lines as well.",13,13,10

38,Cj A.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,22,1,5.0,6/7/2015,"The Low DownI had the pleasure of visiting FlashDancers last month during my successful trek to review twelve (which turned out to be thirteen) New York City gentlemen's clubs in twelve hours.  FlashDancers was truly one of the best clubs I had the chance to visit... it's the kind of club where you lose all track of time and don't want to leave even when you have to!  I've rated the clubs' features and amenities on a scale of one to five, with five being the best possible score.Location & Facilities - 4.5 StarsLocated a few blocks north of Times Square and just south of Central Park in the Theater District section of Manhattan, FlashDancers is conveniently accessible within five blocks of several NYC subway lines.  Don't even think about driving to the club, as it is buried deep in the heart of Manhattan and will cost you a fortune for parking.  Although it may be a little intimidating to enter, as the club is located on one floor which is below ground level, the club gave off a fun nightclub-like atmosphere with plenty of dancers and patrons even when I visited at 4:30pm on a Friday afternoon.  The club has one main stage area with two poles, as well as two poles in the bar area for your dancing enjoyment.  The club doesn't disappoint in catering to the affluent playboys of New York City; even the clean, modern bathroom had an attendant on duty in what is usually a quiet afternoon shift at most gentlemen's clubs I've patronized.  FlashDancers also has two upscale sister clubs in Manhattan:  Private Eyes Gentlemen's Club and New York Dolls Gentlemen's Club.Staff - 5 StarsWhile I didn't interact much with the staff of FlashDancers, the suit-wearing floor staff greeted me when I arrived, led me to a table and brought over a cocktail waitress, which is typical for many of the upscale gentlemen's club in New York City.  I did have a chance to speak with the very friendly Herb, the manager on duty, about the club and the amenities it offers.Food & Drink - 5 StarsAs expected, FlashDancers offers a fully stocked bar, with Corona, Heineken, Stella Artois and Budweiser available for $12.00 each.  As with many of the gentlemen's clubs in New York City, there is a two-for-one drink special daily from 12:00pm until 3:00pm.  The location even offer's a modern Japanese steakhouse, Mr. Robata, on premises.Dancers - 5 StarsI'm not exaggerating, FlashDancers is home to some of the hottest dancers I've seen in the New York City gentlemen's club scene.  You'll find an eclectic mix of dancers, but all of the ones that were performing during my visit were younger and extremely attractive.  I enjoyed dances from Zoya, a sexy Ukranian dancer, as well as Maxine, a tall brunette from St. Petersburg, during my visit.Value - 4.5 StarsThe club offers complimentary admission before 5:00pm and reduced price admission from 5:00pm to 8:00pm from Monday through Saturday, while admission is $20.00 all other times.  Lap dances are $20.00 per song and occur out in the open in booths; for more privacy, you can enjoy the company of the lovely FlashDancers ladies in one of their three champagne courts, each starting at around $500.00 per hour.  The club also offers bachelor party packages starting at $85.00 per person; call the events department at 917-359-0580 for more information and to book your party.Website & Social Media - 5 StarsFlashdancersnyc.com contains all of the information you'll need to make your trip to the club an enjoyable one, including information on club specials, their restaurant, locations, party package information and much more.  There are even links to their Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media accounts so you can stay on top of the all the latest happenings at the club.In Brief...While a bit smaller and without the high profile name of some of the national gentlemen's clubs that have locations in New York City, FlashDancers was an amazing experience and is on the top of my lists for clubs to visit during my next trip to the Big Apple.",3,2,1

The atmosphere is dingy and unappealing.  The music leaves a lot to be desired. They certainly charge like they're a top notch club.  Drinks are way too pricey (which I wouldn't mind had the atmosphere been different).  AND, whatever card you hand them to start a tab, BEWARE!!!  Even after you close (thus pay) your tab, they hold a couple hundred dollars on your card and it's nearly impossible to get it removed.  They will not tell you this is being done and by the time you realize it, it's too late.",10,1,1

42,Diana C.,"Queens, NY",249,383,268,4.0,12/13/2011,"This was my first time at a strip club and I had a great time at flash dancers! Here's what went down on a Friday night around 10pmA) they allow girls to go in even if you're not with any guys (ricks cabaret, for example, doesn't allow that)B) $20 cover charge, no drink minimumC) the strip club is downstairs. They ask if you want a table or stage. We chose table first where we a very good view of the stage and also good views of all the lap dances going on behind/next to us. It was good for us to kind of feel everything out and just observe how the place works.  Later on we moved to sit in front of the stage where you get to see the boobs and asses in yo face. D) Stage: there was a constant rotation of girls dancing on stage which I liked. There are two poles and usually 2-3 girls on there. They come on and dance with their skimpy dresses/lingerie and after a few minutes they take it off and do their thing topless in just a thong. Excellent show when they split their legs on that pole. Then you get the pleasure of snapping dollars bills into their thongs when they dance by. If they're nice they'll shake their tatas and asses in yo face up close and personal if you give them a dollar. Just for a dollar!! Come on that is cheap. If the girl ain't worth the dollar, dont make eye contact and look elsewhere.E) 89 girls to choose from. Very good variety - fake boobs, fake asses, natural curves, small boobs. Also got sexy Asians, black, Latina, a lot of russian/eastern european girls and white girls. And mixed girls too.  All shape and sizes. As sexy girls ourselves we had high standards so were picky. I wanted pretty face, big boobs and big ass. What i learned is typically it is 2/3. There were a few that we're 3/3 but hotter ones are harder to get a hold of, VIPs get first dibs. The less attractive ones will be waking around for business.F) lap dances - if you want to move in on a girl, sit by the stage. Tell them you want a lap dance when you snap that dolla in their thong and they'll come back for you when they're done. They have to dance on stage for 3 songs. I was told by my guy friends you should always ask how much they are before committing, but they were all $20 for one song for us. They may or may not ask you how many songs so tell them one or else they can keep going and charge you more. I was also told not to tip so I didn't. I hope that was fine! You can grab and touch all you want but you can't stick your hand down their thong into their treasure. That is the only forbidden area.G) Ladies Bathroom: don't be alarmed when you walk in! the bathroom is the dressing room for the strippers. we all thought we walked into the wrong room. its a free show in there too. (too bad, boys) the strippers are changing, putting their make up on, theres a male make up artist in there tooH) Drinks - cranberry vodkas at $15, long island iced teas are $22, so definitely expensive.be careful, i ended up spending like $130 at this place!! bring the amount you want to spend, or you'll end up spending everything in your wallet.",32,9,13

We had plenty of money to spend on the beautiful ladies but were totally disgusted with the way we were treated. We went to management and the wimpy guy (owners son or something) handled it terribly.  We left and spent our $$ money elsewhere...  As soon as some college age kids came in they were all over them which turned us off even more.  Maybe sophisticated couples with money to spend are not their interest....

The girls arent gorgeous and they are not the most enthusiastic bunch around. I mean i know nothing says sexy like a bunch of them in ghetto wanna be prom dresses standing around whining to each other about the patrons.I believe lapdances are in the range of 20 to 40 per song, depending which girl you should happen to want to commission.

Most of the girls are all natural without any implants, which I very much prefer.It's not a typical strip club where there is a lot of pole dancing. It's more of a place to sit and enjoy the girls and relax with a drink in your hand.  Dances are $20 a song and the songs are pretty long compared to some places.  The girls here are actually pretty lenient with touching them, after the first couple of dances, they let you grab some ass, run a finger down a nipple. What I enjoy most about this place is that the girls aren't all work, most will sit down with you first and small talk before asking if you want a dance and if you're nice enough, they will sit down with you after to have a drink and chat.Downside to this place is that the drinks are really expensive! $17 for a shot of parton? $12 a beer? Don't forget the $20 cover charge... Otherwise this place is great! Oh by the way, if you read somewhere that they over charge your credit card, it's true to a certain degree.  I had a tab open and when I got home, I saw a $200 charge for some 6 beers that we bought.

I felt enlightened.  I gave it a try and my conversations started sounding like this ""Hey sweetheart, I bet your feet are killing you dancing in those heels all day...""  or ""wow, that guy was really a creep... I bet you run into a lot of weirdos all day""... He was right, spent less money, got lots of stripper numbers and plenty of the attention.  Damn, I'm such a jerk.Let it be known though, that I never called any of them...

Careful using your credit card here as the drinks are expensive and it's easy to rack up a bar tab. Always bring cash beforehand, there's a Chase down the corner and a Bank of America nearby too. Drinks are expensive, but this is New York and I think a lot of people who wrote reviews below don't get that. Complaining about a $20 cover?

66,Jeffrey P.,"Elmhurst, NY",3,8,0,4.0,12/30/2012,"Love this place!  This is one of the best strip clubs I attended and I spent many a paycheck there because the women there are drop dead gorgeous and the ambiance is soothing.  Atmosphere is amazing and somewhat classy (makes me feel like I'm in the Playboy Mansion lol).  There is not one staff member (including the bouncer) that was rude to me.  Drinks are way too pricey so I always use my free passes to get a drink (complementary pass earns you a free drink) when I get the chance.  The best part are many of the dancers from all over the world, but due to prices of the lap dances ($20 a song) and the overwhelmingly amount of sexy dancers, I had to be selective, plus I am a bit picky.  Many of the dancers are Caucasian/European (mainly from Ukraine and Russia), and I love girls around the world, but Black, Latina, and Asian women are my preferences and FlashDancers doesn't have enough of the former two types.  Don't get me wrong cause I picked a few hot Romanian and Caucasian American dancers for a LD if they make a impeccable impression on me.  The thing is that the club picks the type of dancers at the majority of the customers' discretion, who mainly prefer slimmer and less curvier white blonde dancers with European Accents (ranging in many ""cup sizes"").  Mutual touching depends on the dancers so be aware (its usually forbidden at the place).  Be respectable to the dancers and they may make the most of your $20.  Remember that they are human beings and desire to be treated like them no matter how demeaning their jobs are deemed to be.  If you feel like a high roller, take them to the Champagne Room (CR) or the Safari/Blue Room (that room is where you get the most privacy and other treats).  I do have a handful of my favorite dancers that were worth the time in the CR ($685 a hour...ouch) and for many LDs, and were soo alluring and have very interesting personalities.  My time with Rose (Asian dancer from Scotland), has a sexy Scottish accent, very nice double D's on her petite frame, is horny as hell, and very classy and intelligent.  I always wished she worked there everytime I visited.  My first time in the CR was with Rose and she never asked me for a tip so I didn't know it was required until another dancer told me (on my second visit there).  When I took Rose again to the CR and offered a tip, she tried to decline because she said she likes me alot and loves spending time with me.  Natalye (dark Puerto Rican dancer who is slim and usually wears her hair wavy) is a pleasure to be with and is very sweet and sexy as hell.  She really knows how to make the most out of my lap dances and CR time.  She has the sexiest lips too and thinks positively of me (ok, most dancers do that for a big tip, but she's understanding).  Elanny  (Cuban hottie from Miami) is one of the sexiest and sweetest I've met and I think I fell in love with her (lol, taking the T-Pain song very seriously).  Her voice, full lips, nice large size breasts, and nicely shaped derrière (the derriere that you usually see on a dancer in Magic City or Sin City) made it worth all my time and money plus she's very easy to talk to and very honest.  She's never pushy and never begs for a large tip like many of the other dancers.  I don't know why many guys don't like to bother with a lap dance from her, but I think she's scorching hot (she always makes it hard for me to stand up after a nice hot dance).   Elanny is my favorite.  Latina dancers at FlashDancers are highly underrated, especially if they are two curvy and fuller in the chest department.  Now that I enjoyed alot of the strip club life including many and many of trips to this place, I had to stop because it was too addicting and very expensive.  When I win the lottery, I'll come back because I don't wanna be broke by keep visiting FlashDancers on a regular basis.  I use to come once every 1 or 2 months and probally gave the most business in the past two years - lol.  Now its been nearly four months since I been to a single gentlemen's club.  If you need a little R&R with your choice of ladies, all I can say is that make sure you're rolling with many bands (to make them dance) and you're on your A-game, but play at your own risk because FlashDancers is highly addicting.",,,

70,jon d.,"New York, NY",4,16,0,4.0,3/30/2007,"scores has been for awhile the accepted standard by which all gentlemen's clubs are compared to.  that said, flashdancers holds its own fairly well.  while you arent as likely to bump into celebrities or known quantities in the adult entertainment industry as you would at scores. the girls are nice to look at.  isnt that the point?supposedly there is a dress code.  ive never had a problem getting in.  i distinctly remember being let in wearing a red monkey hoodie and some rocawear sweat pants once.  so if the doorman gives you gruff at the front door just shove some money in his fist.  $15 ought to do it.drinks are on par with most other gentlemen's clubs in the city as far as price is concerned, anywhere from $10-18.  first two or three rounds are always weak, so get shots and transition to mixed drinks if that is your thing.  as with most establishments in this genre failing to specify which liquor you want in your drink will result in rail alcohol being used.  for some reason ive never been able to order more than two double shots per person at the table.  ive never been given a good explanation as to why either (or i was too drunk to remember).  ive asked what the corkage fee is a couple of times and they looked at me like i was crazy.music selection is pretty much what you would expect at an establishment in this genre.  honestly half of the time im there im too drunk to realize that music is being played.food is upscale compared to most other gentlemen's clubs.  which really means it all still sucks.  they offer sushi, but mostly for the double entendre im thinking.  who really wants to eat at a titty bar anyways?all said it makes for a pretty enjoyable guys night.  if you bring about $150 you will have a good time.",9,4,7

Tiny space crammed with bored-looking girls who wandered around parroting, ""Wanna dance?"" Women's bathroom was converted into a makeshift dressing room where girls were openly doing blow. I won't knock the girl's looks because honestly, tastes do differ, but most of them looked bored and had a generic California-girl look about them....certainly a lack of variety there. I bought a lapdance for a friend and was really unimpressed. It was a waste of time and money.",3,1,1
74,Jen L.,"Torrance, CA",0,20,0,1.0,1/10/2010,"A group of us went to this place last night for a birthday, got in easiely, were seating right away, ordered our drinks and got them quickly, but then ran into a major problem.  One of the members of our party handed the waitress a hundred dollar bill to change into singles.  Well, she disappeared.  When we were about done with our drinks we realized she wasn't coming back, so we informed management, who just sided with the waitress who of course said she didn't steal it.  Never, in all the time I've asked for change from waiters/waitresses anywhere else has this sort of thing happened.  This was a birthday and we had planned to spend quite a bit of money, but not when are blatently stolen from.  Absolutley appauling is that management condones such actiivity, not sure how that's a helpful long-term business strategy...  Thanks for ruining the night Flashdancers!",11,2,1

76,Peter S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,3.0,5/6/2010,"Entertaining ambience, but the mainly Russian/Eastern European dancers who were bored out of their minds and didn't do much on stage, but all were good looking. Good if you want sushi, drinks, and skinny girls. Went with a bunch of lawyer friends and got two ""table dances"" from a tall, attractive Brazilian girl who seemed friendly enough and not sleazy. Lots of conversation. I don't like that the table dances are in the main room though, would have liked more privacy. Thumbs up for the ambience, thumbs down for the bored girls who couldn't speak more than 3 sentences in a row. Expect to spend a lot of money.",,,
