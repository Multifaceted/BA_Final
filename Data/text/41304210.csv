0,Cat M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",63,2,39,5.0,7/22/2018,"Love the weekend brunch - mango Bellini and omelette plus avocado toast is great.  Chill atmosphere, great music and a pool table in the back.  All you want in a weekend brunch and day drinking spot plus fun movies on tv.  OOOOOhh,  also the brownie ice cream Sunday is amazing !!!!!!",,,
1,Dimitrios D.,"Queens, NY",71,372,407,5.0,12/9/2017,"Tompkins Square Bar is a really nice bar.At the time my party and I went, it wasn't crowded at all and we all found seats at the corner of the bar.  The bartender was friendly and efficient, and the music she was playing was great.  It was stuff like the Dead Kennedys, The Misfits, The Clash and Talking Heads.  They also had Kirin Ichiban on tap.And the fries were salty and delicious.  Recommended!",,,
2,Christine R.,"Garland, TX",0,14,19,1.0,8/24/2018,"It's a shame that it took several tries to get the attention of the host....we were finally seated....only to experience an even worse outcome when all our cocktails were brought out and all of them were not as advertised in the menu. We all took a sip of each cocktail just to make sure we weren't imagining things and it seemed that the next was worse than the previous. One of us ordered a Martini (not on menu) Extra Dry...and came out like a bad version of a Dirty Martini. The only reason they get A star is that they took it off our bill. This was certainly the only good thing that happened. But it was requested instead of offered. Not sure what is good here, perhaps something out of a bottle that doesn't require mixology knowledge and instead only a bottle opener.",,,
3,Cooper K.,"New Paltz, NY",111,1,0,1.0,6/27/2018,"Drinks were amazing! Had two frozen margaritas and The Hunter S. Thompson. Very quick service, however things took a downward spiral when we asked to have the shishito peppers returned.Usually when a customer is extremely unhappy with their food a server asks if they would like a new order or have it taken off the bill. No such offers were extended and we were expected to pay for them. We were then met with hostility from the manager when we asked to have them taken off the bill. Our party of five have all worked multiple years in restaurants and one owns a successful restaurant in Virginia. We respectfully asked to have the peppers taken off our bill and we were rudely criticized for trying to dine for free! ...We were just there for drinks and that was the only food we ordered!!So all in all, great place for drinks, but a horrible experience for dining and being treated like a human being.",,,

5,Zoolah A.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,3.0,9/5/2018,"I love this bar and am a very regular customer. This bar has a great pool table, always great music and a great atmosphere. However, recently I had an encounter with an employee named Max with long curly blonde hair that made me feel hesitant about returning. This employee was rude, showed very bad service and overall gave a very bad energy. So that's why Unfortunately I have to rate this bar 3 stars.",,,
6,Jeff P.,"Los Angeles, CA",558,33,2,5.0,1/17/2018,"Great little neighborhood spot. Joined an impromptu pool tourney, won some cash and enjoyed some brews with a couple friends. Apparently the former joint, Black Market, had an epic burger and while I'm not sure if it's the same cook/recipe the burger I just had was pretty damn good. Will definitely be back again. Thanks gang!",4,2,4
7,Evan T.,"New York, NY",0,46,55,5.0,1/3/2018,Delicious burgers w fries for Twelve bucks.  Two bucks extra for bacon or avacado.   We wanted more of the fantastic fries.  Only one big table but several counters and small tables.   You can also order the food at Niagara next door.,2,,
8,Tania B.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",1,21,3,1.0,5/3/2018,"Was a regular customer of Black Market for years as were my friends and family . This place will close real soon of it continues to treat customers the way it does. Wanted to get an order to go from the  kitchen -no one picked up the phone. So - I went there. I had my small dog  w me so I just wanted to get a to go order. Called but no one answered.  I was trying to get the attention of a server or door person or bartender to put in the order. This guy comes in from outside - doesn't pay attention to me so I figure he's a customer. I peek in. I'm calling at the same time on my phone . They aren't busy. Couple people are playing pool and maybe 5 people at the bar. Im looking at the bartender not picking up the phone. Then the same guy who just walked by me comes towards me and I figure he's coming to take my order but he says - aggressively ""either in or out"" like some camp counselor. ""We've got rules. No door open. "" it's a summer night. I explain I have my puppy outside   I just  need to place an order. He starts waving his hands at me and says to tie my puppy outside or leave - that's it. So rude.  I  explain I can't she's too little -she's a service animal - someone could steel her. I can't  come in. I just want to place a simple  order. He starts at me with   "" first of all...  we don't owe you anything  "" in or out"" and pushes me out and shuts the door as he says we do t need your money. Seriously ? Is this the way you treat your customers, your neighbors. I hope the owners read and care. This was on Thursday May 3 2018 at 11:30 pm. The restaurant business has the highest casualty rate of any business and if you don't care for your regulars - it's gonna go down."" I've never ever ever been treated like this. This guy has social issues and my personal opinion should not  be in the service Industry.",2,,
