0,Mia K.,"Los Angeles, CA",157,425,616,4.0,11/18/2018,"Their food exceeded expectations of pub food. The surprise of the night was the panna cotta - A-MAZE-ING. Service was decent. I'd say my money spent was well spent. For one thing, portions are huge! My chicken panini? Could only eat half. The soup, too and the ""side"" salad filled a dinner plate. Check out my pic of the Fish n Chips. Good choice of food - burgers, sandwiches, Irish standards.We came partly because our hotel didn't have SNYTV and we wanted to watch Mets game. I would come back for a meal. The pics of the chicken pot pie make my mouth water. But I would skip it for a place to chill and throw back a few drinks, as the few patrons were really loud and I don't wanna have to shout to hopefully carry a conversation. My actual rating is 3 1/2 stars but I add an extra for that unforgettable dessert.",,,
1,Michelle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,95,179,5.0,4/29/2018,"Great place and service!! They have almost every liquor you can think of. It's beautiful inside, atmosphere was very pleasant. Clean, bar tender was great at making the drinks. The food was amazing! Me and the hubby got truffle fries, 3 sliders and the calamari, everything was great but those fries, WOW!! That's all I gotta say lol. They topped it with scallions and Parmesan cheese. Absolutely great place, we are definitely going back soon.",2,1,1

3,Kimberly M.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",215,18,12,4.0,4/1/2018,"Decent pub food but don't expect anything out of this world. I had the truffle burger and the guacamole. We also ordered fries (which weren't originally on the menu; my coworker had it there before and requested it again) It was yummy. A solid spot. We went for happy hour on a Wednesday and as you can expect from a Midtown bar close to Grand Central, it was packed. We were seated in the back but it was extremely loud and hard to hear. My coworker and I were practically shouting at each other to be heard. If you can, try to get seated towards the front. It's not nearly as loud, but the seats aren't great.",,,
4,Mike S.,"Los Angeles, CA",3,4,0,1.0,8/25/2018,"Used to go there twice a month to take my team to lunch. Then I bit into my sandwich and chomped I on a piece of glass. Server was very apologetic, but the remedy was to take the sandwich off the bill. Since I was paying for the lunch of 6 people, a free sandwich is not an appropriate remedy. If I swallowed the glass, who knows what could've happened to me. We don't go back there any more.",2,1,1
5,Melissa O.,"New York, NY",196,37,20,4.0,9/18/2018,"Annie Moore's is a decent pub and it is larger than your usual pub in New York City which I appreciate it. I recommend the Atlantic Salmon dish, it is  flavorful and a good portion. Save your time and money on their truffle fries because they are definitely not great. Yet, on the the other hand the lobster creams puff were delicious but the starter only brings two puffs. Overall this is a good place for lunch with your co-workers.",,,
6,Meri K.,"Brooklyn, NY",101,143,338,4.0,10/6/2017,"Nice rooftop courtyard for open air dining upstairs, plus an open wall with street-facing tables also at the upper bar, overlooking Library Way. I stopped in for lunch, and ordered the French dip and it was really good! Not overly salty, and perfect with gruyere and sautéed onions, and some type of sauce (their version of the au jus, I suppose) there was extra au jus on the side, but I didn't even need to use it! The roast beef was not tough st all, as many places' French dips tend to be. The hand-cut, shoestring fries were to die for! I'd definitely hit this place up again for lunch!",2,,2
7,Johanna G.,"West Chester, PA",67,53,6,5.0,4/3/2018,"Came in here after a concert and was so happy to hear that they were still serving dinner at 11pm (I guess to an out-of-towner that is significant news). They weren't too crowded at that point, had a mixed crowd of ages but definitely wasn't a ""newly 21"" scene. We got the last two seats next to each other at the bar. We were greeted with a prompt hello and menus which was much appreciated. We ordered the mac and cheese and the truffle burger - both were delicious! The fries were my favorite though - crispy on the outside. The bartender was friendly enough to chat with us for a bit and check in to make sure we didn't need anything frequently enough. I would absolutely recommend this place!",1,1,1

Updated review","Meh, not so great this time around. I had the pumpkin croquettes and chicken pot pie. The croquettes has good texture, but the taste wasn't anything fantastic. The pot pie was huge and filling but nothing special.",,,
9,Mathangi D.,"Queens, New York, NY",63,95,124,5.0,3/23/2017,"What can I say? The fries got my tongue, the chicken sandwich got my heart and the Riesling got ma high. And chicken pot pie was also getting my colleague, according to his slurping noises.This place is always packed, so please reserve. I went just before the St.Patty's day and even then it felt like the parade was accommodated. Absolutely not a date spot. But had the curk (get it? It is an Irish Pub, divvy)",,1,1
10,Sarah S.,"Paris, France",206,39,15,5.0,1/26/2018,Excellent service!!I came here for dinner last night (Thursday) with my mom. It was definitely a crowded after-work scene at the bar so we didn't think they'd have space for us. The host promptly seated us in the back when we walked in. Our server was GREAT- super attentive and quick. She had the arugula salad and I had the chicken panini- both were really good. I just wish they had a happy hour!,2,1,1
11,Warren O.,"The Villages, FL",17,1,0,4.0,12/17/2017,"Excellent cod fish + chips with fries.  The Shepard's Pie was also very nice, with few spices other than tomato paste on the beef.  Went at noon on a Sunday and not crowded at all.Would come back for dinner.",3,,1

13,Huma A.,"Valley Stream, NY",82,10,0,1.0,6/11/2018,"Came here for lunch on a Monday. Ordered a french onion soup and mac and cheese for apps, a flatbread and shrimp salad for entrees. The soup and mac and cheese were both ok. Salad was good. My flatbread came out with some hair in the dressing, the waitress brought me a new one and it ALSO had hair in it. At that point, I had lost my appetite and didn't really want to continue eating. They comped our check, and honestly it was gross so I would have been super annoyed to pay for it.",,,
14,Laurel F.,"New York, NY",351,255,544,5.0,6/28/2016,"I ate lunch here with my uncle during a workday. The pub is right across the street from our office, so convenient. Such a great spot for a quick lunch. I would recommend to sit upstairs. They have the big windows open in the front for seating, and also a great outdoors patio area for seating in the back. The inside has the look of a modern Irish pub. Very clean and super friendly staff. I got a buffalo chicken flatbread. The chicken was nice and crispy. My uncle got a side salad and the chicken pot pie. The portions are very big, and well worth the price. The entire bill with drinks and tax came to $50, which is not too bad for a sit-down service lunch. I will definitely be returning with coworkers soon.",1,,2
15,Samantha G.,"Chicago, IL",1137,1790,2830,4.0,1/24/2017,"This is warm and welcoming Irish pub. The legit from Ireland bartender was very friendly and attentive. The ambiance and decor feels more upscale than your typical Irish pub or really any pub. It's a dash of fancy and classy to it. The beer list is great. The menu options are plentiful. There are Irish options as well as upscale more American options. I wasn't super hungry so I opted for the mc 'n' cheese, which was quite delicious. It was an excellent blend of cheeses and had just the right level of creaminess.",5,1,3
16,Arlynn R.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,11,0,4.0,5/19/2018,"Excellent, excellent service. I came here for my lunch break, and was a little let down there weren't any lunch specials, but I decided to get a small bar appetizer as I had planned so it didn't matter. The truffle fries were sold and a decent portion too. The fries came out fast and hot for a pretty busy spot. The waiter brought my White Russian over to me promptly, which was not stingy in the slightest. It was an enjoyable experience and I would definitely come back.",,,
17,Joseph C.,"Portland, OR",0,26,3,5.0,5/16/2018,"I stopped in here by chance, 25 minutes before the kitchen opened for lunch.  Though too early, I was warmly greeted and seated.  Lunch featured a fresh soft shell crab sandwich, which was delightful.  Oh, and I began with a very good French onion soup crock.  Great place!",,,
18,Jennifer A.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",232,296,601,4.0,12/11/2016,"We stopped by here randomly for lunch and left satisfied and full. We split a beef barley soup, which was delicious and you can tell it was homemade. It was great dunking some bread in it, yum yum yum. Beef barley was such a perfect soup of the day, it was freezing outside! For my main dish, I got the chipotle chicken sandwich which was crispy chicken, chipotle sauce, lettuce, and avocado. It also was accompanied with french fries (I swapped them out for the chips at no extra charge). The sandwich was actually very good, the chicken was good quality and it was a generous portion. I couldn't finish the whole thing. Also, the french fries were the shoe strings ones and they were crispy and delicious. Finding this place randomly and stopping by for lunch was a good start to the day!",3,2,3
19,Tina G.,"Baltimore, MD",13,1,0,5.0,8/13/2018,"Stopped here at 8:30 on a Monday night and found it to be such a pleasant surprise! Shared a Caesar salad and chipotle chicken sandwich with fries over the chips, with the hubby. Excellent portion size and just delicious food!",,,
20,Nina G.,"Louisville, KY",11,15,41,5.0,8/4/2017,"Very classy Irish Pub with a great selection of draft beers! Can't really say much about the place other than it was welcoming, clean and classy. The bartenders were wearing dress shirts and ties. One of them was a real Irishman! I just stopped in for one beer.",,,
21,Jenna T.,"New York, NY",83,45,22,3.0,1/5/2018,"I've been in here twice, both times the service was good, but my second time there the food could have been better. The first time I ordered the fish sandwich and it was amazing! The second time I ordered the chick pot pie and it was okay--the chicken was pretty dry and it could have have a little more flavor all around. My friend got something else with chicken and her's was also very dry. She had to take the chicken off and eat the sandwich without. The fries are very good though. I don't make it up to midtown that often so this isn't a place I would go back to all the time when I do make it up to that area. The food just wasn't good enough to tempt me to go back all the time.",,,
22,Ray W.,"New York, NY",44,20,13,5.0,8/23/2017,I like this restaurant. Nice food! The price is not expensive. I firmly recommend their original Irish stew.,,,
23,Hillary L.,"Greenville, SC",102,11,3,1.0,6/5/2018,Very upset with my experience at happy hour. Took my work friends out and there were no deals. Bartender was rude and gave me attitude at the end of the night. Not worth it for entertainment with work or happy hour ever again!! Don't go there,,,
24,Meghan S.,"Manhattan, NY",361,152,88,4.0,5/11/2017,"Recently went here for a work lunch during the week, and there were clearly a lot of other people doing the same. There are two levels which was nice so we were seated right away. The waiters were quick and to the point and our food came out pretty quickly. I had the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was good, would definitely want to return for after work drinks to check out the back outdoor terrace!",,,
25,Joe L.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",146,362,1025,4.0,8/19/2016,"I noticed that many of the reviews here compared this Annie Moore's to its previous location.  I had never been there, but I have been to O'Casey's, the Irish pub that was previously at this location.  I've been to both places (in the same place), with my dad and my brother.  O'Casey's was great, but I feel that Annie Moore's is a bit better.I ordered the truffle burger, which has 1/2 lb beef patty, white truffle oil, cremini mushrooms, gruyere cheese, and frizzled onions.  My first act upon getting a burger is to immediately add the ketchup.  This time I decided to taste it without my favorite burger condiment.  It was a great call, because the burger was super delicious on its own.  Each bite was a juicy delight.  It came with herbed fries, which were basically French fries with herbs sprinkled on them.  They were nice, but the burger was definitely the star of the show.My brother had the turkey burger, which was the special of the day, and really liked it.  My dad ordered one of the flatbreads.  He loved it, with his only lament being that he couldn't finish it.The service was friendly and quick, but not rushed.Since I had to go back to work on a busy day, I didn't order any beer or any other alcoholic beverages.  I definitely plan to come back here again and check out what they have on tap.",1,,1
26,Dianna L.,"Hialeah, FL",0,3,0,5.0,6/3/2018,Excellent food and service!! Forgot my umbrella and waiter ran outside to follow me and return back!! Umbrellas are essential here so he saved me $$ and a trip to the store! Thank you!,,,

28,Candice J.,"Richmond, CA",132,379,84,4.0,6/23/2016,"Randomly ran into this place since me, my husband and our friend were hungry and needed to eat somewhere close to our hotel. Came in and was immediately greeted by the friendly security who was in a suit to check our ID. It was a nice, lively bar with locals who are decompressing from a work week on a Friday night. It wasn't too crowded but it was a good amount of people. Good place to catch up with friends over good drinks and watch sports.... or not, whatever yo thang is.I ordered the Lobster Roll which came with Fries. My hubby had a Chicken Sandwich and our friend had Arugula Salad, Truffle Fries and Tuna Melt. The boys ordered a couple of Bourbon with Ginger drink. They were all delicious! The staff were amazing and made sure we were taken care of. Our check came up to a quick $120 but hey, it was worth it! We were sitting at a communal table and even met some drunk but very nice locals. By the end of the night, the friendly security got loose himself and mingled with the crowd. Definitely coming back when we visit NYC again!",1,1,1
29,Benjamin P.,"White Plains, NY",0,4,12,5.0,6/6/2017,Wonderful new atmosphere with sky lights and upstairs bar and lounge area! Plenty happening at the downstairs bar as well. The food is superb. I had the crab Salad and the Lobster roll which felt as fresh and authentic as a high end seafood place in Sag Harbor! My wife had an Irish pub special beef dish which was tender and deliciously seasoned. The staff including manager Hugh Ward were more than attentive and superbly accommodating hosts. I can't wait to go back.Ben,,,

33,Randa U.,"Schaumburg, IL",264,167,212,4.0,3/8/2017,I had the pot roast and it was tasty.  I looked up this place online and the food looked just like the pictures online. I wish I had made room for dessert. The food that came out looked just like it did in pictures. They have a lot of comfort foods and quite the selection of spirits. I dig it.,,,

35,Howard B.,"Miami, FL",152,407,914,4.0,12/13/2016,"Annie Moore's is averaging 4 stars on Yelp as I write this review.  3 1/2 to a 4 is probably about right.  I used to go to old location but I have not been there in years.  I have some good memories from that location.  This location is much larger and more spacious.  It lacks some of the charm and Irish feel of the old place.  That said, it was modern, well lit and decorated, was much easier to get seated, less crowded (because it is bigger) and the menu is more expansive than the previous place.  Annie Moore's has a good selection of drafts.  I did not sample any of the cocktails, but I'm sure they are good.  They had some of the Irish bar dinner food staples and American bar food fare.  For dinner my companion had the shepherds pie.  I had the fish and chips.  My meal tasted like it was supposed to and was very good.  My companion was happy with his meal also.  The service was quick and we experienced joint service where all the servers assisted us.  Annie Moore's seems like it is reliable choice and I will probably be back based on the convenient location.",5,2,3

He had several other tables he was looking after but frequently checked up on us and brought us whatever we wanted. The food came out pretty quick and was delicious! I ordered a burger and it was cooked exactly how i wanted it. Also the fries here are super good. Also I'd say it's baby friendly.

43,Katie A.,"New Orleans, LA",123,258,589,2.0,7/14/2016,"Pretty good ideas, poor execution.We were able to walk-in at dinner time without a wait for a table. That was probably the highlight. There was a pretty bustling happy hour scene with tons of young professionals. I am a young professional at home, but here I was a tourist; hungry, tired, wanting somewhere calm and somewhat restful. It was loud. Oh well.Everyone at the table was pretty ""meh"" about their meal. I think the best thing was my little sister's veggie burger, surprisingly. I got what was supposedly a french dip sandwich, but the meat was not sliced thinly enough for my taste so it was a little chewy instead of tender, plus the ""dip"" part was like halfway between brown gravy and tomato sauce. Very bizarre. I ate about 1/3 of my sandwich, stubbornly dipping into this weird sauce, before I gave up. This is not right. This is not what puts the dip in french dip. I also had brussel sprouts for a side and they were criminally undercooked. Roasted brussel sprouts are, frankly, not that hard to make; throw some olive oil, salt, and pepper and roast 'em up in a hot oven until they're a little browned and crispy on the outside. These were oilier than they needed to be, with absolutely no color. Like they had been barely warmed in a microwave or something and then thrown into a bowl. They were barely more than raw. It was pathetic. I am moaning and groaning about these vegetables because it is honestly SO EASY to make these great, and if a restaurant can't even do that, it's so sad.So the 2 stars here is not in a ""never go here you will die omg it is so terrible"" way, but in a ""for this price point, y'all need to get your act together"" way. Seriously.My mom did have a manhattan that she really enjoyed, so maybe those young professionals had the right idea sticking to the bar area.",6,3,2

I got some truffle fries, a veggie burger and some chips. The veggie burger was kind of bland - I loved the ingredients but it could have done with a nicer sauce or some spice. I didn't really like the chips - they didn't taste of anything and were a little chewy. The truffle fries were really good though. Overall the decor was lovely, and the food pretty good.",,,

The server was around when we needed him, but he also wasn't in our face either. I ordered the French Dip while my cousin got one of the flat breads. Both of them were good portion sizes. The tables in the back dining area weren't jammed next to each other, which I'm happy about. There's also plenty of bar space if you want to have lunch by yourself. Good first experience there. Will definitely go again.",,,2
48,Mark E.,"New York, NY",102,20,12,4.0,7/7/2016,"This pub has an old-world look with modern touches, such as a new roof deck (opened in May 2016) and plentiful television screens where you can catch the big game or, for the very regular business lunch crowd on weekdays, the business news headlines. The bar is long and roomy, and the tables seat diners comfortably. It's a nice place to have lunch with friends or to talk strategy or execution with colleagues.The menu has the standards you'd expect, such as fish and chips, burgers, and assorted apps. They also feature some less common pub fare, such as flatbread pizza, or a variety of salad and pasta dishes. The beverage offerings hold no surprises but lots of selection, so you should find something to quench your thirst and revive your spirits.I've had their pork ribs, cheeseburger, fish and chips, pasta of the day, and the French dip sandwich here, and all have been well prepared and ample portions. My only quibble is that they serve too much food, which now that I know this, allows me to plan to take a doggie bag home and order something that can survive the trip home to my fridge well.The service is okay for a busy place, although it can be uneven and occasionally difficult to get your server's attention: I once had to waste nearly a quarter of an hour to get my check, and on another occasion I waved to almost everyone in the place before I could get my beverage refilled.On the whole, a reliable and tasty dining experience.",,,1
49,Ryan K.,"New York, NY",4,12,1,5.0,5/14/2016,"Amazing food and atmosphere. First of all, the Truffle Fries appetizer was beyond delicious - I could have had nothing else and the fries alone would have earned this place 5 stars. Also had the Fish N Chips, and my wife had the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich. Both of these were amazing, too. For atmosphere, the bar area is gorgeous (both upstairs and downstairs - there are 2), and definitely ask to be seated on the rooftop dining area on the second floor.

51,Mykel B.,"New York, NY",366,463,39,3.0,6/18/2016,"This is the first time visiting since the bar moved from it's old Next-To-Grand-Central location. The space is bigger here, and more filled with tourists than the old place. If I were visiting this place as a tourist or for the first time it would rate 4 stars. But compared with the old place.... it's lost it's character. The old Irish waitresses are gone. The Irish pub feel is gone. And the menu really doesn't have much Irish in the way of food. They try to experiment. ""Duck and date meatballs"" sound good, but they're really rather bland. Just generic slightly sweet meat. The flat bread was okay... but certainly not Irish. Service was very good. Several different waiters checking on our table. But the intimate feeling is gone. The hard-wall acoustics makes everything echo and REALLY LOUD!

55,Jay B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",62,57,21,5.0,1/1/2017,"The vibe here is nice. It's an Irish place. Very nice. Drinks are good, good is on pint to pick at. Must check this place out.",,,
56,Jackie K.,"Sunnyside, NY",113,9,22,5.0,5/5/2016,"Great to see this place reopen in there new location. They've really upped there game with there food. Not what you'd expect in your typical Irish midtown joint! Really fresh look on the place. Roll on the good weather, roof top and deck look amazing. Flatbreads are so good here.. There Guinness is even better than there last location. Well done to all",,,
57,Jen E.,"Manhattan, NY",6,65,3,1.0,6/23/2016,"I'm rather disappointed in the new Annie Moore's.  I was a big fan of the old location, but I don't think I'll be visiting this place anymore.  I when for food and drinks a few times and it just gets worse and worse.  Service this past time was awful.  Either the waiter was new or had too many tables, regardless, it was an awful experience.  Why ask for how a burger should be cooked if it is not going to be brought out that way?  My medium rare burger was well done.We ordered two angus burgers - one with American cheese and one with cheddar cheese, for $16 each, yet on the receipt there's an UP charge for the cheddar (i've never heard of this).  the menu says ""hand cut fries"" - what came with our burgers?  Chips. (HUH?)  It's rather vague what one is supposed to get as i look over the menu, I'd assume that hand cut fries are french fries and terra chips are chips but then another menu items says french fries.  Please fix this Annie Moore's...the sandwiches are ALREADY way over priced an not worth it.  There are what feels like a million irish bars in this city, I'll not soon be returning to Annie Moore's since I can get much better in many other places.",2,,
58,Tom M.,"Staatsburg, NY",1,28,2,1.0,11/10/2016,Simply awful. Bring hearing protection and a voice amplifying device if you are trying to order at the bar. Food mediocre at best. It's Manhattan for heaven's sake. Make a different choice.,,,
59,Z ..,"Armonk, NY",0,51,4,2.0,3/15/2017,"Very poor service. Went here for lunch with 10 people. Food was decent and came out quick but the service was awful. I guess when your bill includes a fixed tip amount, the servers here are inclined to do the bare minimum. Very disappointed",1,,
60,Emily O.,"Kingston, GA",0,4,0,4.0,11/22/2016,"I got the grilled chickens and it was amazing!! We also got cheese cake with a strawberry syrup and it was so good!! The only down fall was the salad. Unfortunately, there was not much dressing on it and there was not much flavor. Overall, it was very good and I would definitely go there again.",,,
61,Jennifer T.,"Washington, DC",2,49,0,5.0,3/26/2016,"Back in town on business and was surprised to see Annie Moore's had closed. We decided to try the new locale last Saturday, and found out they'd only been open a week! The space is different (and larger) but the staff is still awesome and attentive and as usual, we met some new friends and had a blast. Will return!",2,,
62,John I.,"Wappingers Falls, NY",0,21,0,4.0,4/26/2017,"Party of six, two children, four adults. Late Sat. afternoon. French dip was perfect one of the best I ever had. Children shared mac and cheese & chicken wings.  Best looking wings I have seen, wanted to steal one from the kids.  Cod fish, both dinner and sandwich were very good. Flatbread was my only dissapointment.  Service friendly and very good.  Overall very decent place to dine.",,,
63,Beth T.,"Seymour, CT",1,31,2,5.0,3/12/2017,"They pour a mean shot here. The guy next to me has an awesome looking steak and we had some very yummy Mac and cheese. We will have to come back here for dinner. Awesome atmosphere, quiet and friendly. Come in out of the cold!",,,
64,James G.,"New York, NY",0,30,1,2.0,6/5/2016,"Wanted to like this place, seemed like a great option for after work. However, made the mistake of ordering a chicken sandwich off the menu. It was basically a chicken nugget on a hamburger bun, and it came with a small side of crumbs that they tried to pass off as chips. The waitress just kind of shrugged her shoulders and said that's what the kitchen gave her. Lame. One expects a bit of a midtown tax at spots like this, but at the same time, there's also a level of quality necessary to justify it. Others' photos look good, and some of the dishes they brought out looked good too, but this sandwich was just terrible. I'd try Stout down the street, or walk over to the Harp on 3rd Ave btwn 45/46. Hopefully this place will step it up, seems like it has potential but not there yet.",,,
65,Anna S.,"San Antonio, TX",1,14,0,3.0,2/25/2017,We chose this place because it was close to our hotel and we had walked a long way that day. I was disappointed but I probably should have split a an order with my husband. It is very noisy! So much so that we had to lean across the table to hear each other. I got the buffalo flat bread that was VERY spicy and to much for me to eat. My husband got the Irish stew which was great!,,,
66,Kevin F.,"Spring Hill, FL",1,4,3,5.0,12/29/2016,"Favorite place in the city to bring the kids for lunch!  Fantastic REAL food, while not having to worry if my kids are too loud.   The Fish and chips is the best I have ever had and the Shepherds pie outstanding!!! Mix in the outstanding service and my whole family is happy.",,,
67,Beth F.,"New York, NY",0,4,1,5.0,3/19/2016,Our waiter Carlos was great -- very efficient and friendly.  I tried the rigatoni and my friend had the fish and chips.  Both dishes were quite tasty.  I look forward to their expanded menu.  They did a nice job on the décor.  Best of luck to all involved in the new venture!,,,
68,Marianne F.,"Bay Shore, NY",0,16,0,4.0,1/1/2017,Great find after our tour at the New York Public library.  Good sandwiches and nice atmosphere!!,,,
69,D W.,"Binghamton, NY",0,2,0,1.0,12/7/2016,"I went here Sunday night. The wait staff was slow even tho the place wasn't crowded. It appeared they didn't want to be there. The food was terrible. Mac m cheese was overly cheesy, apple pie was stale and French fries were burned. The bill was expensive for what we got - 48 bucks.  Bathrooms were dirty with no toilet paper. I would not go again.",,,
70,Bhani M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,12/5/2016,"I have been to Annie Moore's on multiple occasions and the food is always stellar!!! As a longtime New Yorker there are a hundreds of Irish pubs and this place definitely stands out for fantastic food as well as nice ambience. You really can not go wrong with anything you order on the menu. The duck & date meatballs are very delicious, creatively excuted, and anyone that has a good palate could tell the chef really is very talented for inventing them. Any bad reviews on them is absolutely absurd. The chipolte chicken sandwich, truffle burger, and lobster cream puffs are also some of my other favorites. Highly recommend this place for a great meal!!",,,
71,Jajay T.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,5,2,5.0,7/5/2016,"Went there a couple of weeks ago for drinks with a friend since I work across the street and we sat at the upstairs bar . Our bartender ( the Brazilian girl , can't think of her name ) was very nice and attentive . Had wings and Mac and cheese , both really tasty and beers . The upstairs is really nice and the have a roof deck too . A little pricey but worth it . Will be back soon .",,,
