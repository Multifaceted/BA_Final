0,Brenda C.,"Woodside, NY",0,26,111,5.0,10/13/2018,"Hold on while I howl.....this place is fantastic.  I have passed it several times but today I took the leap and went in for my one meal of the day.  The girl at the counter was very helpful when I placed my order.  Yes you can omit items.  I was a bit scared at the thought of a date & pumpkin seed wrap but I mustered up the courage and I ordered the Howling with a small amount of feta, the Smokin' fries and my favorite black cherry soda.  The wrap was actually really good.... don't let the date in it fool you.  The meat was spiced to perfection and the yogurt sauce (on the side) was truly essential to making all these combination of items inside produce one of the best wraps I have ever tasted.  I love some kick to my food and those smokin' fries were  smoking good.Make sure you have a big appetite because this wrap is huge....I barely ate half of the meal before I was ready for a nap.   The interior is cozy and they have two swings at one of the counters (yes I sat in the swing seat)....come on who didn't love the swings as a kid???I give Wolfnights two thumbs up..... I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.",,,
1,Cayley P.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",0,1,0,3.0,11/4/2018,"Food was great and worth the price!Unfortunately, I was there for way longer than I needed to be because the girls behind the counter had no hustle and let my salad sit there for over 10 minutes when they easily could have bagged it and let me go.Also don't like the note on the menu that says that you can't modify or replace ingredients. People that work in the service industry should be willing to switch whatever the customer wants.",1,,
2,Ka L.,"Los Angeles, CA",173,9,0,3.0,9/30/2018,"I don't recommend this place if you're looking for a healthy, lite, or low-calorie lunch in the LES. Although it's advertised as ""healthy"" or ""wholesome"", the meat is seasoned very strongly (like the meat's flavor doesn't come through) and the person cooking carelessly pours tons of sauce into the wrap. Basically, these are like calorie grease-bombs that are not that different from a burrito. I ordered the Brothers Grimm wrap this time, took it to go and upon biting into it, so much wet aoili mixed with grease squirted out, and the lettuce was completely mushed by all the moisture inside there. So, that was kind of gross. Cash register person was super nice and pleasant. But that bout it. My main gripe is that they're calling themselves a healthy option but it's practically the same as a meal of burgers and fries just wrapped and wolf themed.",1,,1
3,Reynaldo A.,"Queens, NY",92,16,11,5.0,11/4/2018,"I'm actually surprising at how good this is. I had the mowgli, and it's most vegetarian with a nice kick to it. Under $10 and very filling. Will be back.",,,
4,Danielle M.,"New York, NY",388,497,41,2.0,8/23/2018,"Wolfnights had been on the list for a while and we were very much excited to finally try it. The idea sounded great: freshly made wraps with unique combinations of filling ingredients. Unfortunately, it just wasn't good. I had the Howling - as exciting as a Date and Pumpkin seed dough sounds it was completely tasteless. The entire wrap was filled with overly seasoned Cumin chicken and barely any other flavors. Not really sure where the melon or yogurt sauce were. I knew from my first bite that it wasn't good and made it half way before I completely stopped.The BF had the Dire Wolf which I also tried - a little tastier than the Howling (only because it had fried chicken and cheese) but really was comparable to something you could get from a nearby deli/grocery store. None of the unique flavors listed came through.Steak fries - meh, quite greasy. Didn't finish these either.",,,
5,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",278,420,241,4.0,7/5/2018,"Great product. Love that they are open late, hate the snarky staff. Well...hate is too strong a word. Did not appreciate the attitude as a perfectly courteous paying customer. I've been there, I get it, working nights sucks but if you were paying $14 for a salad, you at least want to not deal with eye rolls and weird backhanded comments. The pink moon salad was great. Would try it as a wrap next time but hope that this staff is a little more chill.",3,,
6,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",349,1107,1096,4.0,7/19/2018,"I came in on a Tuesday evening around 6pm with a friend for dinner before a Yelp event in the area. We decided to split 2 wraps and an order of the Wolf Attack.We split the Carnivores Delight (Charcoal Grilled Angus Meatballs wrapped in a Date and Pumpkin Seed Dough Wrap along with a Fried Egg, Sumac Onions, Pickles, and Mustard Horseradish Sauce) and the Once Bitten (Grilled Portobello wrapped in a Fig Dough Wrap with Bean Sprout Slaw, Goat Cheese, Beets, Sweet Potato Chips, and a Dill/Garlic Sauce).I liked the Once Bitten more than Carnivores Delight. The sauce was flavorful and really popped. The wrap was just creamy and savory.The Wolf Attack, with Tater Tots topped with Sloppy Joe, Grilled Onions, Melted Cheddar, and Jalapeño. It looks amazing, but I wasn't a huge fan of it. The sloppy Joe was spicy!They brought our food to us when it was ready, which was nice of them. All in all, I think both wraps tasted amazing and I wouldn't hesitate to come back when I'm in the LES area.",1,,

This part of NYC is pretty busy late night, so there was a bit of a line when we arrived.After looking at the menu, I decided to go with the Pink Moon wrap and an order of the Brussels sprouts.The pink moon wrap was rather large and had a ton of shrimp in it, especially for the price. The flavors were great and the coconut sauce was outstanding. The combination of shrimp, veggies, and wrap were delicious.The Brussels sprouts on the other hand, were very pedestrian--though it was a rather large portion as well.Overall, this place serves up some tasty food at a reasonable price and is the perfect spot for a catch up with a friend or a late night bite.",2,,1
9,Zain A.,"Leonia, NJ",41,6,2,5.0,11/1/2018,Excellent spot! Been coming for years both drunk and sober. The people rating it low have been those useless Californians who come and visit. God they are so annoying.,,1,

11,Aya E.,"Elk Grove, CA",580,432,1051,4.0,7/7/2018,"I was in the area one day and walked by this spot. After stumbling across some pictures of their wraps, I was sold! The wraps looked filling and delicious while using healthy and unique ingredients.I went with the Dire Wolf (~$12). This wrap included fried chicken, turkey bacon, their special ketchup, and a whole lot of toppings that made this wrap so delicious! My wrap was ready in minutes. While ordering, I was debating on getting the fries but opted against it. I'm glad I did because this wrap is heavy! I was actually only able to eat half of it.It was fresh, the fried chicken was crispy and hot, and the toppings provided a cold component to balance out the flavors and temperature of the wrap. Overall, it was solid!I wish they had a build your own wrap option. The possibilities would be endless! My only complaint about this place was that I ordered it to-stay but the AC wasn't running, and it was a super hot day. I did see they have an AC there but not sure why it wasn't on. Eating a hot wrap on a hot day is not fun. Just something to keep in mind if you decide to stay or go with your food. But one thing's for sure, you will not be disappointed with the delicious flavors!",,,

FUEGO customer service. Absolutely ridiculous Ordered a beast like I always do. Told me they were out of blue cheese which is the cheese that typically goes on the beast wrap. Okay fine, asked for a substitute cheese, told that it would be an additional 3 dollars for any other cheese since it would technically be marked as an addition. How are you gonna do that to people. You messed up and ran out of something (the cheese), and now you're gonna use that mistake to charge people more money? Not cool. Avoid this place.",,,
13,Andrew F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,71,1,5.0,8/21/2018,"I f***king love this place. One of the best fast food meals you can get in NYC. Their wraps are freshly made for each sandwich, so they have a warm, fluffy doughiness to them. They use nice ingredients and have multiple veggie and meat options.I find myself craving Wolfnights all the time, but sadly they only have two locations. Make this place crowded so they open more... perhaps in Brooklyn and Midtown East?... Please?",,,1
14,Sapna D.,"New York, NY",140,29,33,4.0,7/7/2018,"Randomly made this place a destination with a friend who happens to be obsessed with wolves. Like, seriously obsessed. When we read the menu items and saw that everything played on the wolf theme, we had to check it out.Pleasantly surprised to see the variety of wraps on the menu. They had a few vegetarian (possibly could be modified to be vegan) options, along with meat and seafood wraps. I was between the ""Pink Moon"" shrimp wrap ($12) and the ""Teen Wolf"" falafel ($10), and ended up choosing the falafel.The wraps were huge - like, Chipotle burrito-sized. You'll definitely get your money's worth here. My Teen Wolf was delicious overall. The inside was fairly straightforward and nothing too out of the ordinary, but the wrap itself was probably my favorite part. All their wraps use a different dough, and the Teen Wolf uses a fig wrap. Better than your traditional pita wrap for sure! Also want to shout out the interior of this restaurant. While it is more of a grab-and-go type of place, there's plenty of seating, and they have a couple of cute porch swings facing the street, which I was luckily able to snag while there. The wolf-themed artwork is awesome, too.I wouldn't go super out of my way to go here again but definitely will if I find myself hungry in LES! Still have my eye on that shrimp wrap and a couple others...",,,
15,Michelle T.,"Brooklyn, NY",75,247,801,3.0,9/6/2017,"I enjoy meats with my greens in a wrap. A little greens makes my subconscious self feel a little better with the protein. Sadly, these wraps at wolfnights had way too much greens and not enough meat. I didn't get that satisfying feeling after eating half a howling and half the beast. If I had to choose, I would go with the beast because it had more steak compared to the portion of the chicken in the howling. However, the sauces in the back were great! Just a side note: don't have one of these before getting drunk, it's not filling, well at least it wasn't for me.",2,2,2

17,Dallin Ho'opilionakai Y.,"Ossining, NY",58,29,28,3.0,7/25/2018,"While I understand the look and feel of the place to be Raw and unfiltered.  The Banging Brussel Sprouts were anything but BANGING while there was some crunch still in them they lacked allot of flavor I mean I could not even taste the char that was on a few of the pieces. I had the Falafel wrap which all the flavors were good the falafel fell short they were over cooked, while I expect crispy these were burnt and tasted that way. I even opened the wrap up and tried to cut the falafel in smaller pieces I broke the knife trying to do so and when I did get into one the centers were dry and not very good mainly because they were over fried which dried them out and with the amount of dressing that was put into the wrap you would have hoped it would have softened them up.Sorry I would have given it a 2 star rating but my wife convinced me that her shrimp wrap was good tasting and it was so for that reason I gave it a 3 star rating. We will return as I was interested in other items but on this visit it missed the mark I hope my next visit will do better.",1,,

Updated review","They've expanded since the last time I was here and I love what they've done with the place! There's plenty of seating in the back, but they have taken down some of the swinging chairs. I guess it's a good compromise though. I ordered the Mowgali again and also a serving of tater tots just because I was craving something deep fried. Food was still as fantastic as before in terms of flavor. They now have a painted depiction of how the wraps are made along the back wall, which really helped me appreciate all of the ingredients that go into their homemade wraps. My only gripe was that my wrap was really sloppy and falling apart. I don't know if it was because the wrap itself was too small to contain all of the filling or if the employee just did not wrap it tightly enough. I would have also appreciated if they had cut the wrap in half prior to wrapping it up in foil. I guess if you want the wraps halved you need to ask directly. If you dine in (or even if you dine out, I guess), they have their sauces lined up against the back wall that you can squeeze into tiny containers and take back to your table or take home. I think you must only have to pay for the sauces if you order delivery and want something in particular.",6,1,3
19,Daniel D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",797,194,188,5.0,3/11/2018,"If you're looking for something filling late at night, this is your place.All the wraps are really really good, I think these are my favorites:* carnivore's delight* underworld* the beast* sweet potato friesit does take 5-10 minutes to make so if you're in a hurry, order online and then come pick it up. the restaurant itself has a decent amount of seating too.",1,,
20,Ven S.,"Washington, DC",9,162,317,5.0,10/16/2017,"Definitely one of my favorite food stops in all of New York. I've made it a tradition to stop here and get like 2 or even 3 wraps whenever I take the bus into town. And that's coming from a guy who doesn't even like wraps! There's something about these in particular that are just......I dunno........ excellent???Fresh ingredients are put together into each wrap. The seasoned tortillas are toasted to a light crisp which sets them apart from the ordinary wraps with that mushy chewy tortilla that I can't stand. The proteins are so very well seasoned,  the shrimp, the marinated beef morsels, cauliflower, they have a couple vegetarian options. A different sauce comes in each wrap as well so anyone can just come on in and get their sauce on! (............I don't know where I was going with that) Anyway these guys are open late and although the interior is really small they still have a few seats inside. I'll always come back.",,,
21,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,3.0,7/30/2017,"I have very strong mixed feelings about this place. I ordered the teen wolf and it was delicious and very filling. Considering it's manhattan, I thought the price was fair. The service was great and the food was prepared quickly. Now here's the bummer. I don't have any food allergies (I've been thoroughly tested), so considering that, doctor friends mentioned it's possible something in their preparation could have caused an allergic reaction. The company has since asked me to remove my post because they don't want to be ""publicly blamed"", but instead I will modify it to make myself as explicit as possible. I am not saying they are to blame. However, I am saying there is the POSSIBILITY that something caused an allergic reaction-pesticide residues, a spiteful unicorn, etc. My throat started to swell and a giant, painful bump resulted--see photo. I WAS willing to give this place a second shot, however after a message I received from management, I doubt I will return. Hopefully this was just a fluke by a spiteful unicorn and won't happen to anyone else.",2,2,2

23,Teddy T.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,10/16/2018,"I'll start by saying I'll NEVER (see the emphasis on never) eat here again, here's why. The Wraps are not big or filling. I'm not a greedy person who over eats and I'm easily satisfied when it comes to food. The wraps sound exotic but aren't better then what you can get from a local deli. I'm not trying to bash this place but the wraps aren't worth the price at all. As far as the taste, I'd say they're just ok, nothing to really talk about. The wraps are mainly just filled with fancy chipotle type sauces.",,,
24,Racquel B.,"Brooklyn, NY",240,307,1981,4.0,5/12/2017,"YASSSSS Wolfnights!! I was craving something good. Anything good. I was in LES and knew good food was one right step away. So I scouted the neighbourhood just a tad and saw Wolfnights. The dark accent interior and cool vibe drew me in. The menu made me stay. Not one, not two, but THREE vegetarian options?! And sexy ones might I add. Grilled portobello with goat cheese, beet salad and sweet potato chips in a pomegranate fennel wrap? Don't tell me twice!! And it was even better than I imagined. Crunchy, savoury, flavourful and even felt healthy with the abundance of spring mix they add in. The dough for the wraps are made on site and grilled steaming hot right in front of you and the filling inside is generous. There is a decent amount of seating and I opted for the swing seat, because how often do you get to eat in a swing.  After finishing my yummy wrap I was tempted to get some tater tots with the sauce that everyone raves about, but I decided to simmer down. But I'll be sure to get it all on my next visit and bring some company!",5,4,6
25,Roberto C.,"Fort Worth, TX",55,8,9,5.0,3/5/2018,"Excellent - if pricey. I had the bowler wrap - grilled chicken, melon, mint yogurt, greens - it was THE BEST wrap I have ever had (I usually do not like wraps as I find them underwhelming.

I ordered the Pink Moon which is a ""grilled shrimp wrapped in a beef and chia dough with bean sprout slaw, charcoal grilled asparagus, pickled jalapeno, friend pickles, and coconut vanilla sauce"" and it wasSO. DAMN. GOOD. They were generous with the shrimp, I had about 6-7 pieces and the flavors mixed together so well. I've been trying to find something that would give my tasebuds that ""WOW"" factor and this hit home run. All of their wraps are curated so that means you do not get to choose what you want in a wrap but their creations are so freaking delicious, it's worth risking. Also their fries were 10/10: crispy, thick, hot and salty. As they should be. And oh man... Their chipotle aoili sauce.... That wolfnight ketchup... Mmmmmm. Will be going back. Over and over again",1,,

Couldn't finish the wrap; not because it was a big wrap but bc had too much salt and cumin. The flavor of the chicken was very mediocre, nothing special. I wasn't a fan of the sauce either, it definitely doesn't compliment the sandwich. Also, it just felt like eating a bunch of stuff that don't go together in one sandwich. The only thing good about it was the freshly baked bread. For a whopping $11 wrap, it should be tasty!",1,,

45,Jen H.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",222,58,135,5.0,8/17/2017,Small place with few seating. Definitely better for grab and go. Fairly quick service depending on how many delivery orders they have. Their prices have gone up which was a bummer when I went in to find out. I got the teen wolf after the cashier told me it was one of their most popular sellers. It's vegetarian-- falafel for the win! It was crispy but not oily. The dough wrap was to die for! So delicious and light! It was packed with a bunch of vegetables and sunflower seeds with the sesame dressing. It was filling bc it was a rather large portion size. Would def recommend and I'd like to come back to try their other wraps!,,,
46,Lyndon X.,"Ridgewood, NJ",1,25,0,4.0,5/24/2018,"I came here so often. It was my go-to. The Brother's Grimm is such a unique blend of ingredients that just go together so well. A little sweet from the raisins, a little sour from the shiitake mushrooms and pickles, a little spicy from the sauce, a large quantity of flavorful chicken, a bit of crunch from the plantain chips and a freshly made wrap! Onto the criticisms. I prefer the non-diced, long strips of pickles they used to do before. Nowadays it's diced into small cubes so as to be more consistent in portion sizes as they measure everything with their measuring cup. I find the taste to be altered a bit for the worse when it is served like this.The big thing for me though to deduct a star is that they do sometimes leave the wrap on the pan-fire-grill thing a bit too long and end up with a completely burnt wrap. And instead of tossing it and making another one they would try to hide it by using the burnt side as the inside-facing part of the wrap and hoping you wouldn't notice. Ever since a few of these occurrences, I'd since been constantly watching the wrap being cooked and if it turned out too charred for me I'd let them know to give me another one. If they could improve upon this I'd love this place so much more.",1,,

I love wraps but....eh everything was so expensive. Why the hell is a wrap and a shake $20??? That's excessive. The wrap I had, I can't remember the name. It had steak meat and lots of leafy greens. Um so all the ingredients are organic and healthy. I didn't feel the magic. They do have a nice selection of sauces. I liked the green one. It was spicy and filled with herb flavors. I drenched the wrap with the sauce and it was decent. The shake had way too much going on. Banana, basil, chocolate and some other stuff. Way too thick, it was honestly a struggle to slurp.Now I know lots of people are into clean and healthy eating so I guess this place would suit those types of people. I probably wouldn't visit again, it's a bit too pricey for me.",2,,1

I ordered the wrap that everyone kept raving about on here (can't remember the name).

Updated review","Went back to Wolfnights again. They are open very late, as in early morning hours late so if  you're coming off a hangover this is the perfect spot for you! Wolfnights is a werewolf inspired theme restaurant and all of their signature wraps are taken straight out of the movies like the Twilight series. They include Teen Wolf, the Howling, the Beast, and again my personal favorite the Carnivore's Delight.I once again ordered the Carnivore's Delight but as a salad, not a wrap. I wanted to load up on my veggies :). I also had a extra egg added to that dish. Best decision I ever made, I loved every bite of it!",9,4,8
52,Florann E.,"Boston, MA",233,205,197,4.0,10/8/2017,"I have to say, this place is pretty legit when it comes to wraps. Their menu caters to both omnivores and herbivores. What drew my attention was their interesting flavor combinations and different types of wraps. I ordered The Beast (charcoal grilled steak wrapped in a turmeric dough w/ blue cheese, marinated green olives, cilantro, red chili mayo). Oh so deliciously satisfying! Aside from the food, the place itself is nice and neat with a wonderful staff.",1,1,1

I have been a bartender for 8 years and NEVER would say something like this to a guest. The team saw this and were (consistently) awesome all things considered.

54,Ben H.,"Atlanta, GA",169,30,0,5.0,6/5/2018,I'll come up from Bklyn to the LES just to take family and friends to get a wrap here. Most wraps leave me feeling underfed while overpaying but not at Wolfnights. Delicious and creative twists,,,
55,Carina P.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",674,378,382,5.0,8/7/2017,Amazing late night eats option. I have been trying to eat healthy and at 1 or 2 am beggars can't be choosers. Wolfnights is a great option. They make wraps that aren't in a standard whole wheat or spinach wrap but made like a crepe. They have various sauces to choose from as well.

58,Sally L.,"San Francisco, CA",478,389,1123,4.0,2/22/2016,"I'm a HUGE fan of tater tots so naturally the Wolf Attack from Wolfnights was on my hit list.Oh man oh man did it live up to the hype! It takes maybe around 5-10 mins to cook because they make sure everything is deep fried perfectly. When you finally get your food, it's steaming hot and the cheese is evenly melted. You'll stab your fork through the crispy tots but it won't be long before it just becomes a delicious concoction of savory meat + hearty potato. It never gets boring either because of the occasional jalapeno that'll take you by surprise.I love their sauce selection too. My favorites to complement the Wolf Attack are the sriracha mayo + ketchup.The staff, especially the lady with the accent, are so friendly :)Around the block from a few popular bars in LES (Verlaines, Essex), this place makes GREAT drunk food.",4,3,5

It has honeydew melon in it and it's the most beautiful combination I've ever tried,,,
60,Mahmood S.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",46,177,304,5.0,7/20/2016,"Mediterranean/ middle eastern food is always good and I especially love it when given a twist. This place is the best example of this style of cooking I've seen yet.The menu items are all at about 10 dollars a warp, reasonable price for something you could consider a good lunch. What really got me was the fact one of the workers whipped up a dough ball and cooked it into a wrap right in front of me! Pair that with never frozen meat, and great sauces and you got the making of something amazing. I ordered the underworld wrap which took about five minutes to come out. Worth the wait. Hell I'll wait ten. First bite, sauce really hit me with a nice warm flavor. Meat cooked perfectly, just enough pickles and who knew apples in a meat wrap would taste that good? The seating arrangement here is comfortable and ample with plenty of daylight throughout the space. Everything is pretty clean and the air conditioner set to the right temperature. All in all this is a solid 5/5. The fact I ate the whole thing before remembering to take a picture of it is proof of that. (Will come back for another wrap and photos)",,,

63,Sunny T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",335,128,27,4.0,2/22/2017,"Wolfnights really knows how to play the game when it comes to boosting customers' confidence in making healthy decisions--calling their selections ""Gourmet Wraps"" when in reality, they're massive burritos. But hey, I'm not complaining. I'd been planning on trying this place out for awhile, and although a drunchie night would've been ideal, I decided to treat myself after a day's long worth of work and stomach running solely on coffee. I arrived only to be bombarded by the many choices, all of which sounded amazing. I was stuck choosing between the Howling, Underworld, and The Brothers Grimm. Spooky names. When in doubt, ask the cashier! Was told The Brothers Grimm was by far the most popular. Sealed the deal on that bad boy--grilled chicken, pickled shitake mushrooms, raisins, pickles, plaintain chips, and a chipotle aioli all wrapped in a chestnut chili dough. Oh yes. Carried that 10lb baby home and decided to cut it in half, cause ya know, self control. The dough to my amazement tasted like chestnut and you could see and taste the spicy flakes of chili throughout. The chicken was grilled to perfection, and the saltiness of the pickled mushrooms and pickles went beautifully with the sweetness of the raisins. The plaintain chips added a great crunch and the creaminess of the chipotle aioli really tied the whole wrap (burrito) together. This place seriously puts all the Chipotle burritos to shame. Not to mention you can also try their burritos as a salad too! Gone are the days of boring flour tortillas filled with barbacoa and $1.75 extra guac, and hello to the days of gourmet wraps. You won't regret it.",,,1

Updated review","I've been a fan of wolfnights for so long, and I've realized their quality of food has been downgraded. First of all, the banging brussel sprouts are NOT banging at all. Sauggy, blend, weird tasting sour flavor that's not lemon. Like, are you serious? Come on! For a dish that cost $6, this is just horrible. Once Bitten went downhill too. The salads and the mushrooms are not mixed together. It was divided into 2 sides of the wrap. One side is salad, one said was mushroom. Salads were good, but the mushrooms were blend as well. I can't have goat cheese, and not a fan of cooked beets, so I asked if I can take out those 2 and substitute it with scallions. The cashier told me he would have to charge me the scallion. They don't honor substitutions. Um, okay... I see that they have a new item coming to the menu so I'll probably give that a try, but other than that, I think I'm going to give this place a pass. It was such a waste of money for the $17 I've spent today, I rather walk 2 more blocks and get pizza instead.",1,2,1

I ordered ""The Beast"" which has char­coal grilled steak wrapped in a turmeric dough fried pasta, blue cheese, mar­i­nated green olives , cilantro, red chili mayo and lettuce -- along with an order of French Fries. The wrap was really tasty, with vibrant flavors and was also salad like with all the lettuce. The fries came in this fun box, there were plenty of them and they were hot and delicious. The staff were working hard and superbusy in their open kitchen arrangement -- so customers are ringside for the creation of their wraps. The staff was incredibly friendly and didn't just call out my number, instead one of them came over and gave me my order.They have two swinging chairs facing the street and other barstools facing the street, with a cutout window and you can sit and drink and eat with your friends inside or outside and put your food and drinks on the steel windowsill / bar.",1,,

(turmeric dough, date and pumpkin seed dough, beet and chia seed dough, fennel dough.. etc). I decided to just go for the Howling sans pickles.  This was so tasty; the yogurt sauce was slightly sweeter than a tzatziki, the melon and feta were fresh, and the mint added another fun layer of flavor.

The only thing that will hurt you will be your wallet.       The menu is a Shake Shake style menu, you pick what you want and the prices are separate. The food is really appealing and it smells really good when you come in. I forgot the name of the sandwich but the shrimp was good. Also the fries are good but it better with the sauces they have, like chipotle mayo. Also it's vegen friendly.      The place looks lively especially during a late night, I think they still have the swings seats. Also it pretty good when you're really hungry after a late night out clubbing between 2am-4:30am between Friday and Saturday nights.

The chicken (beautifully grilled & seasoned) and portobello mushrooms (gorgeously juicy and meaty) and falafel (wonderfully crunchy and herbaceous) were top notch; I cannot wait to try the other wrap options...

Gives them a really nice char.The ambiance is pretty divey, but the swing seats were very clever.For New York city we thought this was a good buy.  The food was inventive, well-prepared, flavorful, delivered quickly and reasonably priced.This would be a great place to go after having had too much to drink...",1,,

92,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",101,154,280,5.0,5/28/2015,"Flash back to the night of Saturday July 19th, 2014: the first of many trips to Wolfnights with my partner in crime @alexleinroth (okay, I guess you can't tag people on Yelp. Note to Yelp: that would be pretty neat if you would let me do that).Since that night, I have been to Wolfnights approximately 6 times, but it also might be 15 - again I need to get better at this whole checking in when I'm in a unique state of mind. After a night down in the LES full of fratstars, pbrs, and DFMs, all I wanted in life was something quick, easy and delicious. We just happened to stumble upon a restaurant that looked unbelievably welcoming with its open windows and swinging chairs. We chose to walk in, and it was top 7 best decisions of July 2014 for sure. The next day, we actually could not remember the name of this amazing place, but went on to spend HOURS searching google maps until we finally figured it out. I was immediately drawn to the pink moon. This features grilled shrimp, bean sprouts, asparagus, jalapeno, fried pickles and a wonderful coconut sauce all wrapped in a chia beet wrap. It is a little spicy, but definitely manageable (and I am not particularly enthused by spicy foods). This is definitely my go to at the spot. After my third visit here, I had THE BEAST, which is also delicious. It features steak, fried pasta, blue cheese and a spicy mayo.  Also a WOW. They also have the ""Wolf Attack Fries"" which are delicious tater tots with cheese and a bit of a kick with some jalapenos. Clearly a great #summer2015 diet choice. #getitright #getittightAlso a side note - I have never in my life been asked out on a date from a stranger (aside from Hinge (ps. Hi Brian)) BUT back in January I actually went on a date with a boy I met here who was actually normal and not a rogue (Rogue: A wanderer; strays from the norm). So ladies - as much as you think that Hair of the Dog will wind up in a coffee date the next day, I'd like to note that Wolf Nights has a better record for me. Another side note - Something that I have realized over the 6-17 visits I have made here is that you in fact do NOT need to  eat the entire wrap. Splitting one of these bad boys is perfectly satisfying. Especially important for all you ladies out there getting ready for #beachseason2015 #getitladies",2,1,

The grilled chicken is well-cooked while still juicy, the chipotle aioli gives the thing a kick, while the mushrooms, raisins, pickles, and plantains~ though somewhat odd on paper~ just work so well. The dough itself, unlike those dry tortilla-like things that are used almost pragmatically (just to cover up the stuff inside), is moist and actually adds to the overall quality of the wrap.The size is quite good~ just half of it was filling enough for me that I could split the other half with my wife for lunch.

Also got the wolf attack (tater tots with melted cheese, jalapeños, and meet sauce) and it wasn't amazing, but very good. The staff is very friendly and it has a great environment for a casual quick meal with friends. Also a good late night spot.",,,

This place caught my eye. It's not cheap but the wraps are gigantic and stuffed with delicious things.The Howling was super tasty and did the job, though the dates and pumpkin seeds in the wrap dough just didn't translate for me. Still satisfying, though, and a good quick meal option in the area.",1,,2
98,Li M. H.,"New York, NY",273,117,973,4.0,7/26/2016,"This is a local hotspot. It's great for a quick late meal or just something to eat anytime of the day (or night since they open late). I come here pretty frequent and my fave is the carnivores delight.So recently they have expanded. They used to be a bit smaller with maybe only less than 10 seatings. I guess they have been able to knock down the wall next door and expanded ln their seatings. They have their door and windows open, so when you walk by you can smell the food as well watch them make delicious wraps.The register person was the same person that made my wrap. I ordered the carnivores delight with a side of wolf attack. My friend had the brothers grimm. The carnivores delight had angus meatballs and a fried egg. Who doesn't like fried eggs with angus beef? So the wrap is like a burger in a wrap. The cool thing about this place is that they make their own wraps, they have wraps that have pumpkin seeds, pomegranate and more! They also use fresh greens and additional toplings plus different aiolis.",,,1

You can see your food being made especially your wraps. I like the swing seats they have there. There are only 3 swings, but someone beat us to the punch in getting those seats. We ready ordered the Brother Grimm, Pink Moon, and the Wolf Attack. The Brother Grimm is a grilled chicken wrapped in a chestnut & chili dough with pickled shiitake mushrooms, raisins, pickles, plantain chips, chipotle aioli. This wrap was good. Had a good spicy flavor taste. Lots of chunks of chicken.The Pink Moon is a grilled shrimp wrapped in a beet & chia seed dough with bean sprout slaw, charcoal grilled asparagus, pickled jalapeño, fried pickles, and coconut vanilla sauce. This was the better wrap to me. It was sweet. felt refreshing with all the vegetables in it. Definitely a wrap I would get again. The Wolf Attack. Tater tots topped with melted cheddar cheese, jalapeño, grilled onions, and meat sauce. This was oh my goodness. Delish tater tots. Heart attack. Yes..but definitely worth getting. Love the cheesy gooeyness. The spicy goes well with it. The meat sauce is top so well with it. Yummy!!The wraps are messy because they put a lot in it. Looks more like a burrito. Definitely good wraps. All freshly made. I can eat the wolf attack for lunch and that's it. Good option to eat.",1,1,1

The combinations of flavors and ingredients were really unusual, as others have stated, but clearly the folks who developed the menu have excellent palates! In other words, the combos work great. I do wish they had a gluten-free wrap option, but they will do any wrap as a salad. I loved the Mowgli from the first bite; the chicken in the Howler was lusciously savory with cinnamon and cardamom.

Updated review","And now they have ""happy hour"" specials where you get free tots or a dessert wrap with your order!

So good.  It's a great deal for delicious vegetarian food on the go. (They have meat too)",,,
108,Stephanie Y.,"Berkeley, CA",4999,1699,3185,4.0,11/25/2015,"A little wrap spot in the LES. Not much seating, more of a quick take-and-go type spot. They do wraps and only wraps, however these aren't your typical deli not quite as good as a sandwich wraps. These are gourmand. These are different. These are unique. A few vegetarian options (maybe even a vegan one, but don't hold me to it), as well as some delicious meaty ones. It's a lot of food, so be hungry or you'll be taking half home.The fillings are all a little gourmet and unusual -- think grilled shrimp wrapped in a chia seed dough stuffed with asparagus and bean spout slaw, which my dad enjoyed. I opted for the Once Bitten -- grilled portobello wrapped in a fig dough with goat cheese, a bean sprout slaw, sweet potato chips and beets to name just some of the ingredients. Yeah, these wraps aren't f%#^cking around. They also serve up fries, tots and brussels sprouts on the side, which I didn't eat, but they did look bangin'.Definitely an unusual spot to take your old ass parents, but a solid spot for a quick (and cheapish, think $9) lunch or sustenance before or after hitting up the bars.",21,16,20

Why we continue to eat bland uninspired food is beyond me. This place tries to fix that. Got myself a cauliflower wrap with bbq chips inside, and I can't even remember what else (which is a good thing because it was designed to be different). Very good. Part of the menu is drunk food because of its location near the bars, so you'll have to put up with some unnecessary options like tater tots covered in a heart attack, but that's okay because the other healthier parts of the menu are very appealing.

114,Steph C.,"Brooklyn, NY",476,763,320,4.0,9/9/2015,"Thought I'd reviewed this place already but I guess I forgot. Which makes more sense considering that the only times I've been here were after a long night of drinking. Quirky sandwich shop with gourmet wraps that are so, so good. All of the wraps have names with wolf references, which is apropos to the shop's theme. Small space, more of a place to take your wraps to-go rather than eat inside. Unless you're one of the fortunate few who manages to snag one of the swing seats! All of the wraps have really unique ingredients and combinations. You'd be hard-pressed to find one that doesn't sound adventurous. The most recent time I came here, I went atypical (for me) and ordered the Brothers Grimm. Grilled chicken with pickled shitake mushrooms, raisins, pickles, plantain chips, and chipotle aioli in a chestnut and chili dough. Holy flavor overload! It was amazingly delicious. I tend to veer away towards grilled chicken, but this was excellent. Also tried the Carnivore's Delight and I actually thought it was even better than the Brothers Grimm. Grass is always greener, as they say. Lines will get longer as it gets later into the night, but it's worth the wait.",3,1,3

After the third incorrect order we called to complain. The lady on the phone was extremely confrontational. So sad to lose so much business over a few bucks of condiments!

118,Arjun A.,"Garden City, NY",42,125,97,4.0,9/6/2015,"Delicious wraps for a very good price. These aren't your typical wraps made from flour tortillas. Instead they use a sort of bread similar to lavash or tandoor naan or paratha (the types you get from indian restaurants). So instead of a thin boring tortilla, you get a nice smoky, chewy yet slightly crispy on the outside, DELICIOUS bread. And then most of the wraps come with Israeli style kebabs on the inside. I got the Carnivore wrap and the Underworld wrap - the carnivore came with kebabs, eggs, onions, spicy honey mustard. The underworld came with kebabs, spinach, blue cheese, macadamia nuts. I think they could be a little more creative with their wrap offerings and combinations of ingredients but for what it's worth, it's a solid meal.",1,1,1

I came across Wolfnights on Yelp and decided to go with my boyfriend to try out their ""sandwich"" (well wraps to be exact) and I can say it did not disappoint. The awkward combination of raisins, plantain chips and shiitake mushrooms created a perfect blend with their grilled chicken. While this is one of the better sandwich spots in NYC, it failed to compare to Ike's PlaceI am not a fan of the wolf attack, I really do not know what the hype is about. The meat sauce was nothing special with their tater tots. But again, I do not like tater tots. Now thinking back, I don't know why I ordered it.

The place is small and cramped, but the good vibes and the very good food make up for it. I LOVE how they bake their pita fresh for each and every wrap. The pita's seasoning is also customized to complement the filling (e.g., chicken, falafel), which was a plus. I ordered the Carnivores Delight - juicy meatballs, fried egg, grilled veggies, and a killer mustard horseradish sauce. The sharp sauce matched well with the meat and eggs, neither of which were overcooked - yum! My friend got the Brothers Grimm, which was notable for its wrap chestnut and chili dough and chicken that was NOT dry. (Harder to come by than you'd think.)Also of note - the tater tots funny enough. Crispy, potato-y bites that were even better with the Wolf Ketchup. (Think a Thousand Island chipotle mayo.) The food here looks and tastes fresh and healthy, and the only down side is the cramped eating space. Definitely a solid LES lunch or dinner.",1,,

All of them are packed with tons of unique flavor combinations (yes, even the veggie ones). This is a terrific spot for lunch or dinner. What separates Wolfnights from other sandwich/wrap spots in NYC is their focus on using fresh ingredients and making what they can in-house. Their sauces each pack their own punch (their salsa is amazing), while their freshly baked doughy wraps add their own unique little flavor to the goodness inside. Their spicy fries were way too salty. The wraps are HUGE, so there really is no need to order sides.",,,

Stumbled upon this place and with Yelp in my pocket, I knew I couldn't go wrong. It's a small establishment so there were only three guys working the shift. It kind of has a Chipotle style of feel to it. The fresh ingredients are all laid out in front of the prep person while another flattens the ball into a wrap with this machine that howls while in use and the third grills.The fried pasta inside the Beast wrap was a great combo with the seasoned olives and fresh greens. The steak had a perfect charred taste and only added to the deliciousness of the wrap. It was nothing like I experienced and expected in a wrap as they can be a little boring. Unfortunately my phone was completely dead and I couldn't photograph this deliciousness but simply put, give it a try. The wraps are awesome!P.S. Try (and mix) all their sauces!

This place is a cross between fast food burrito meeting fancy flavors meeting delicate elegance. I have tried most of them, duhh and my favorite are the brother's Grimm and the pink moon (such a generous serving of shrimps!). The doughs are made in the house and have crazy innovative flavors such as chestnut dough, pomegranate dough, or date and pumpkin dough. When I read the menu for the first time I was like, what the heck is this crazy mix of flavors and toppings, no way it can work, but oh no, it works, and it works great!

Also the tots, don't forget the tots. Plantain chips, raisins, and shiitake mushrooms may sound like a really odd combo, but when I took a bite out of this wrap, I became a rampant train--unwilling to halt until total destruction was wrecked upon this holy wrap, and nothing was left to tell of its tale to others. The wrap was perfectly soft and doughy while the moist chicken was hugged by all of these uniquely astounding flavors.

They make everything to order and the ingredients they put in each wrap my sound slightly odd at first, but upon your first bite, you'll know exactly why each ingredient belongs. The dough they use for the wrap is soft and chewy and you can see them make it on this ball shaped oven contraption--it's pretty dang cool and something to wonder about while you wits for your food. I ended up getting the teen wolf ($7.30) and the steak fries ($3.95). The wrap was fantastic. The falafel combined with the pickled red onions and toasted sunflower seeds made for the perfect combination of sweet and savory--additionally, the texture provided enough diversity to keep me happy!

The wrap was surprisingly neat, especially considering the ingredients that went into it and the fact that wraps usually fall apart into a soggy mess by the end. The flavors were incredible and made me want to try every single other wrap on the menu.Instead of another wrap though, I got the Wolf Attack ($6), which was even more amazing. It's a huge mass of crispy, piping hot tater tots drowned in melted cheddar cheese, jalapeños, grilled onions and Wolf meat sauce. Wow. It's as overwhelming as it sounds, but worth every cheesy, sweat-inducing bite. Be careful of those jalapeño peppers on top though - they'll really get you sweating. Part of the genius of this dish is the thick layer of cheese on top - it acts as a delicious insulator, keeping the awesome tater tots beneath it nice and hot for the duration of the meal.Despite the fact that no one was ahead of me, I needed to wait a few minutes for my order. Normally I hate waiting for food, but when I see that the wait is due to them cooking up everything fresh and made to order in front of me, it makes me happy. Everything was so fresh and hot and well worth the little wait.I can't wait to come back and try The Howling and the rest of the wraps. I might opt for the regular tater tots though next time instead of the ones covered in a pound of cheese, just in the interest of living long enough to be able to come back here more in the future.",8,5,4

This was one of my higher rated bookmarks and the first new place I tried since arriving.If you're not familiar with the area, it's still relatively easy to find,just KEEP WALKING. lol. The staff was prompt and friendly enough, the place was clean although I didn't like the old fashioned aluminum trash cans where I had to lift the lid with my hands. This place is TINY definitely not suitable for a family, strollers, children who don't want to sit down etc. The rocking chairs are a nice touch and the people watching is great. I had the Brother's Grimm and it was pretty good,extremely flavorful. As I got to the end of it the sauce sitting on top of just the wrap itself was divine. It was my favorite part of the meal, I may go back and just ask for the wrap, that's how good it was. I didn't want to have a heart attack before I turn 30 so I skipped over getting the Wolf Attack. Instead, I got the tater tots which were most likely the most perfect tater tots I've ever had. Hot,crispy and not too much salt. I look forward to my return although I will try something different. If anything, go for the tater tots!",1,,

Tatertots over a bed of meat sauce topped with oozy cheddar cheese, jalapeños, grilled onions. Heart attack inducing yumminess. The Carnivore's Delight was also on point. Not typically a fan of wraps and sandwiches, but would definitely order this again. Don't forget to try their homemade sauces in the back counter! The chipotle aoili was super memorable.Absolutely perfect for nights out in LES and everyone else seems to agree because even walking by around 1am on weekend nights, it's packedd. Swinging bench seats by window are something different! Kind of a challenge when you're under 5ft and just wanna climb on and eat but cute nonetheless.

I know the words, ""show me the money!"" came out of his mouth, so I'm running with it. If I'm wrong, I really don't care.Occupying the old Paul's Boutique space (yeah, *that* Paul's Boutique), it's a delicious beast of a wrap joint. It's got the swagger of twelve Team Jacobs with creations that blow your typical Mediterranean wrap out of the water. Specifically, The Howling wrap: chicken wrapped in a date and pumpkin seed dough with fried pickle, feta, melon, mint and yogurt sauce. If that doesn't doesn't put a tickle deep down in your naughty bits, you must be a cold-hearted, emotionless sociopath. Shits is delicious, son!The menu is simple and straight forward... and that's the way every restaurant should be. Do a few things, but do them really, really, really well... and these Michael J.

The two of us split a Brothers Grimm wrap and a side of brussels sprouts. Not a place to order and dash as they make everything fresh, even the wrap itself.The wrap was incredibly tasty and held together well for the most part. I appreciated the crunch from the plantain chips. The portion of the brussels sprouts was huge. I liked that it was simply flavored with lemon, garlic and olive oil and felt like a healthy balance to the wrap. Would have loved to have this kind of place on campus back in college.Already planning to come back to try the Wolf Attack and Carnivores Delight. Great place for a cheap meal or late night snack.",1,,

For a reasonable price you get an enormous sandwich on their incredibly flavorful, freshly made wraps. Really, I don't understand how it's possible for them to achieve such a delectable char on the outside of their fig wrap. While I've yet to peruse the whole menu (with my mouth, that is), their Teen Wolf was delicious. While I can't say I understand the concept of toasted sunflower seeds in a wrap, I will admit it was hardly noticeable in a sea of crispy and flavorsome falafel. Other notable items I can't wait to try include their explosive looking tater tots and the chocolate basil milkshake.The freaky, fun menu at Wolfnights definitely has me howling for more!* *This is my most embarrassing attempt at humor to date.",1,,

The woman in back was hustling to make the food, but the man taking orders and preparing the wraps couldn't keep up. After 40 mins it was finally handed over without even an acknowledgement of the wait. The food is definitely a 5 - great quality, great price and great size.

The woman, who was working that night, seemed really busy from having to deal with so many take out orders, but she still managed to stay very friendly. I looooovveee the swinging seats!

165,Alexis D.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,52,8,5.0,2/25/2017,I got the Brother's Grimm and it was absolutely fantastic. I've never seen a place like this with wraps as UNIQUE and DELICIOUS as these. Ingredients are fresh and flavorful. My friend got the Pink Moon which he said was amazing too. I can't wait to go back to try others!,,,
166,Dang L.,"Houston, TX",127,113,306,3.0,9/4/2014,"It's very cramped inside. They have a few tables for outside seating or you can try to stand inside and eat your food on the tables against the window. When my friends and I came here they were extremely busy and the service was slow because there was only one person making everyone's orders. You can clearly see how they make the wraps and what they put in it  right in plain view so that was cool to see, and it helped your eagerness during the wait. I ordered their Brother's Grimm wrap. It's chicken wrapped in chestnut & chili dough with pickled shitake mushrooms, raisins, plantain chips pickles, and chipotle aioli (via the menu description). The wrap was huge. Not gargantuan, but definitely not a pip-squeak. There was a hefty amount of food in the wrap that just tasted delicious. I especially like the raisins and plantain chips.",3,,
167,Chloe R.,"Bulger, PA",5,7,0,1.0,9/23/2015,"Thanks for my instant rebate!Found a dime in my wrap. They refused to give me back my money, only saying that it must have happened because they were handling money with the food.",3,,

169,Seamus L.,"Queens, NY",10,31,0,2.0,9/26/2015,"As someone who enjoys polarizing food (liver, goat yogurt, sea urchin, etc.), even I find Wolfnights's wraps to be pretty gross.The gimmick here is that the wraps have diverse and strange combinations of ingredients. However, each wrap has so much going on that you can't actually taste any of the constituent parts. The one thing you can taste is the sauce; and every wrap is dripping with some variation on watery aioli.I think the chefs feel incredibly insecure about their food - that the product isn't all that high-quality (dare I say, ""gourmet?) - and that they must compensate with the ""weird"" combinations.So why does this place get such good reviews? Two reasons: First, people often confuse ""different"" and ""new"" with ""good."" Second, Wolfnights is located in a neighborhood in which most of the businesses are bars, and these soggy wraps would probably appeal to a drunk person. In fact, they look like they were thought up by drunk people. So if you happen to be sober, avoid this place and go to one of the dozens of taquerias in the area.",2,1,1
170,Cynthia D.,"Queens, NY",474,866,6306,3.0,7/7/2014,"Hungry wolves! Come in for hot, fresh wraps made right in front of you. They have Tater Tots! I recommend the Teen Wolf wrap.After turning left and right around the area, I finally found Wolfnights on the corner of Rivington Street and Ludlow Street. It's quite a small little shop that seats about 10 people perhaps. There are 3 swing chairs on the right side - quite an experience to sit on them, by the way! Food:Teen Wolf - #1 on the menu. The Teen Wolf is a Falafel wrap sandwich. I see onions, scallions, sunflower seeds, and pickles. The description said the wrap was pomegranate dough - though I didn't taste it. A great alternative for vegetarians! The highlight was the hot, fresh wrap! It was so fluffy, chewy, and soft! A bit of sauce here and there for flavoring. I personally think it was the best part of the wrap! The fried Falafel balls in the wrap which I found to be very standard like other decent Falafel places. The wrap was neatly rolled with a lot of ingredients. It was too big for me to take a bite, I had to use a fork. Nonetheless, my favorite wrap here. Brother's Grimm - #2 on the menu. It is a chicken wrap with plantain chips (adds a crunch with every bite!), shitake mushrooms, and etc. The chipotle sauce was a bit overpowering but makes the wrap more moist. Chicken was alright. It was not too dry but not as tender as I like it to be. Not bad but just didn't stand out to me. The wrap, once again was the highlight. Carnivore's Delight - angus meatballs, fried egg, onions, pickles, with mustard horseradish, and etc. The meatballs were pretty dry, in my opinion. This wrap in particular was my least favorite of all I have tried. The flavors were not infused together - so I don't think it went well together especially the mustard horseradish. Overall, it's a hit or miss depending on your taste preferences. I have to say the wrap dough itself was the highlight of Wolfnights. Although, the wraps come with a lot of ingredients - not all of the flavors work well together - in other words, there's too much going on. Not to mention, it's very hard to take a bite because it is so big and stuffed. It's quite messy, so make sure you grab a fork to help you out.",2,,1

A night you turn in to a wolf and are hungry for wraps and tatertots? Is it supposed to be scary?The food names: they're just things sort of related to wolves and fairy tales sort of. But Teen Wolf and Brothers Grimm are both real names for the wraps but in no way are they descriptive of what you're ordering. In trademark terms we'd be in solid fanciful/arbitrary marks here. It's ok if you don't get what I'm taking about.But none of it matters because the wrap I had was incredible. I had the Brothers Grimm, a chicken wrap with golden raisins, pickled mushrooms, and a party in my mouth. The chicken was incredibly moist but not soggy and I had some ""wolfs ketchup"" (some sort of tasty cream sauce which like everything here is neither wolf-ey nor ketchup-ey) to top it off. But the star of it all is the made to order wrap it self. And I don't mean made to order as in take a wrap outside of a bag of wraps and put stuff in it, I mean get a piece of dough and cook the wrap before your eyes. The result is moist, flakey, and makes all other wraps a joke.People normally get wraps for all the wrong reasons, trying to eat less carbs, poor bread knowledge, lack of creativity, some weird 90's gen x bread is so passe BS. I mean generally good bread makes a better sandwich than any wrap can home to match. Yet here, the wrap is great and I'd put up one of the Wolfnights wraps (wolfwrap? teen wolf rap?) against some of my favorite sandwiches. A position, I concede, is blasphemous.",1,3,1

I'm not a pickle guy so I had to take all that out of the wrap, but whatevs, I'm used to it. For about $9, the wrap itself was huge, and the chunks of chicken inside were ginormous and juicy. It was super well-seasoned and I'd love to get their recipe. The chipotle-type sauce on the inside also had a good fire to it that was the perfect amount of spice, and a good partner to the chicken. The wrap was nice and warm, like a blanket that you have a good winter snuggle in. Except you'd be a bunch of chicken, sauce and cut up veggies. That'd actually be a pretty good cuddle buddy...Wolfnights is pretty small, but they have these cool swings hanging from the ceiling that are the window seats. Kind of awkward getting into them, but definitely unique! I'd rate it higher, but wraps don't really make me go crazy, and I wouldn't purposely trek out here for them.

My stop here was short but great. The friendly staff quickly got to work on my order. I got The Beast wrap with a side order of steak fries. Verrry delicious, very filling! The wrap was generously stuffed. The only negative of this place (to me) is that some of the wraps just sound weird -- the combinations of flavors are a bit off to me. But  this is personal preference.. I tend to be picky on most occasions. Chipotle Mayo is great. This was a great experience. I will be coming again, as soon as I work off the calories! :)",,,
198,Mike L.,"New York, NY",0,24,12,5.0,1/9/2016,Absolutely love this place. Tried all the wraps and they're so good! I order at least once a week.My favorite is still the carnivore delight!,,,

We were starving and looking for something that would be delicious, but also not greasy and gross. I got the Mowgli (YUM). It was SO good. Every bite was perfect. The sage aioli really ties the whole thing together. My hubs got the Underworld. Also great, but he went without the feta, and I think that it could have really used it. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. I can't wait to come back!",,,
