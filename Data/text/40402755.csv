I was attending Prep school ( Trinity-Pawling) and every year Tom would invite me over to the club. I must have visited it over 30/40 times over those years 62-95. I have always loved this wonderful establishment and only wish Tom were alive to invite me over again. Great tradition, members, accommodations and dining. I miss it.Andrew Hyatt Masset III",,,

Plus, I've always enjoyed the food.  Be sure to check out their library.  It's gorgeous.  (I believe it's modeled after the Vatican?)  I've been to the club several times, because a number of my friends are members.  Just be sure to know the rules - formal attire is required (except the gym and pool of course), no phones, and no photos.

This stone monolith of a building, discretely nestled amongst the gaudy storefronts of 5th Avenue, boasts room after room of richly decorated interiors that uplift the spirit and transport one to the age of old New York elegance. Marbles, dark wood, plaster Mouldings, and glittering crystal chandeliers dazzle the eye. Make sure to secure a tour of the 4th floorLibrary!

Updated review","This is arguably my favorite place on earth. It is a rare bastion of elegance, manners, civility and decorum, in a world that unfortunately values pop culture over tradition and history. There are several places to eat here: the ground floor Dwight Room for breakfast and afternoon tea, the Tap Room for lunch, happy hour or dinner, the Main dining room for breakfast, lunch and dinner and several private venues available by reservation. The food at the Club, unlike other clubs, is outstanding. The Wednesday Seafood Buffet is so over the top, with lobster, raw bar, a variety of other fish entrees and an incredible spread of desserts, all prepared on site at the Club's kitchen. All with an amazing wine list attended by the in-house sommelier. If you are lucky enough to stay here, there are many rooms ranging from dormitory styled emergency accommodations to high-end luxury suites.  Rooms must be booked by a member. The facility itself is an historic landmark, and the Library is considered one of the most beautiful rooms in all of New York.  The ceiling is breathtaking.  The Main dining room is one of the most lavish spaces in Manhattan, and weddings here are among the most desired places one could ever hope for. If you get an invitation to go here do not turn it down. It is an extraordinary facility, with elegant accommodations and sumptuous food, and a sanctuary in the midst of the Fifth Avenue madness outside.",4,,3
5,Reviewer A.,"New York, NY",87,158,6,2.0,7/30/2017,"Yes, this place is iconic and has plenty of history and prestige. I was a guest and attended a meeting that was held during the daytime business hours. Formal attire was of course required. What's the hype? You would think with the steep membership fees they charge they would maybe renovate or update their dinnerware. All, and i mean All the cups and plates were chipped. Also, all the cups were poorly washed. We had over 20 cups to be used for our meeting and they all had remnants of old tea and coffee. Silverware was dirty as well. Waiters have been with the club for decades and its unlikely they would be let go for slow and sloppy service. They were friendly though. Food was subpar as well. With all that money, please make some necessary upgrades.",4,,
6,Allie S.,"Pensacola, FL",191,256,100,5.0,5/13/2016,"One of my new favorite clubs in Manhattan. Came for a dinner hosted by a family member in the ballroom. What sets this club apart is the stunning lobby with massive ceilings and marble interiors. Very active club. This was a large dinner for about 150, and despite the large group the food and service were excellent.  They also allowed us to bring our own photographers in. Most of these clubs have a lean list of allowed vendors so that was a plus.",3,,4
7,Rick E.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,5.0,9/2/2017,"An timeless oasis of old-school New York elegance amidst the chaos of Midtown. The architecture and attention to detail, particularly during the holidays, is superlative. The frescoed library is among the most beautiful rooms in the city, if not the country, and the food is a good as any private club in Manhattan.And this is a private club, not a public restaurant. So those who bemoan being turned away because they failed to adhere to the dress code (and in so doing disrespect the member who invited them) are most welcome to walk out the front door and patronize any of the 25,000 less discriminating restaurants in Manhattan. Perhaps you'll find their grapes to be less sour, as well.",1,1,3

Men do not forget your suit and tie it is very formal.The Details: I spent an evening at the University Club for a charity gala. What an event! It really is such a gorgeous venue with big stone fireplaces, grand dining rooms, and a sophisticated air about the place. Everyone was dressed to the T. Men have to wear a suit and tie and women dress to impress. I would have to imagine that the food was catered through the University club, in which case it was very good. We had passed hors d'oeuvres and an open bar. Although it was not a sitdown dinner, I very much enjoyed my time here.The Damage: As it was a charity event we did not pay for the meal rather donated to charity. Don't have much to comment on the price, sorry.",3,,1

I was wearing a jacket and dress shirt.  The staff could not be more rude, I felt as though I entered a Southern plantation in the early 1800s.  I left disgusted that in NYC, such a overt affront to modern liberal values could still exist with their exclusionary ideology.",2,4,1

11,Bobbi H.,"Chapel Hill, NC",0,40,1,3.0,11/19/2017,"We stayed at the University Club in NYC as guests of a member.  There are some definite positive and negative aspects to the club. Positive: 1. The location is hard to beat.  You are right across from the MOMA and in the middle of some of the greatest shopping you can imagine. 2. The library is a must see.  Beautifully paneled in wood and decorative glass, it oozes charm and an old world feeling.3. The fitness center for women is adequate.  The squash courts are inviting.  The men's fitness area is superb.   4. Some of the staff are fantastic, helpful, and gracious. Negatives:1. It's old school.  There is a strict dress code that as a guest you feel obligated to follow, but then we noticed that many of the older teenage guests did not follow without consequences.  Dressing in a suit for breakfast is a pain, made even more painful when a group of 16 year olds show up in short skirts, legging, athletic gear, jeans, etc.  All the forbidden fruit.  2. Service could be improved.  While some of the staff are helpful and attentive, others seem to care less.  There were numerous times during our stay where the staff were busy entertaining each other while we waited for them to help us.  In some instances in the front they were watching videos on their phone (and cell phones are supposedly forbidden in all public spaces).  Our room wasn't serviced the second day we were there - neither cleaned nor was there a turn down service.  We tried calling one evening around 11 pm for an extra pillow and no one bothered to answer the phone.  The bar service was geared to members.",2,,1

As I walked into the elaborate lobby, I was greeted by a coat-checker who was extremely kind and patient considering the wave of people that had just poured into the room. I walked up to the stairs and entered a beautiful room with conspicuous detail throughout. There was a classy sign that read ""no phones"" and I was already intrigued by the old-school atmosphere that surrounded me. There were poker and black jack tables about, and food and drink everywhere one could look. Ultimately, I was extremely impressed with the University Club on all fronts.",,,
15,Sam T.,"Bloomfield, NJ",740,145,2027,4.0,12/14/2014,Beautiful Private Club for the privileged. Food is good and the place is filled with some interesting history.

16,Alyssa R.,"Brooklyn, NY",652,1109,2729,4.0,1/18/2013,"For the past several years the alumni board at my alma mater has hosted events at various clubs around the city.  The University Club is by far the most regal club we've been to.Sure there is a door man out front, but where in this neighborhood do you not get that?  It's once you step inside that you know you are not in another tourist trap along 5th Ave anymore.The University Club is grand.  And handsome.  And magnificent in its decor and attention to detail.   I honestly have no idea what the flooring or walls looked like because I spent my entire time in the lobby looking up at the ceiling, which is stunning.  Lucky for me I was able to make it to the elevators without bumping into anything, looking up at the ceiling and all.  :-)Our event was held up on the 7th floor (there are a total of ten floors) and had lovely views of 5th Ave, but more spectacular than that were the walls & ceiling of the room, which hosts the same details as seen in the lobby.  If you are appreciative of wood paneling (the nice kind, not the grandparents-basement kind), intricate carvings and paintings that mimic the ceilings found throughout Rome than the University Club is your place. Other floors offer up racquetball courts, a library and guest rooms.Sadly I have no photos of the club because rules state that cameras and phones are not allowed in public spaces.  :-(  Cell phones can only be used in the telephone booths located throughout the Club.And as the same in most of these swanky clubs there is a dress code:  Male members and guests are wear jackets, dress shirts and ties for the fellas & similar options for women. Jeans, shorts, sneakers, ""casual sportswear"" are not permitted.I took away one star because the hors'devours left much to be desired.

24,David W.,"New York, NY",167,834,0,4.0,10/23/2011,"Okay...I should first say, I have no idea how much the seafood dinner buffet costs.  I was taken out here by a friend who's a member, so he took care of the tab.  With that out of the way, wow, the shrimp, the oysters, the crab legs, how can you not love this spot?  The raw fish, the lobsters that are already cracked open for you, I was seriously in heaven.  Unfortunately I didn't want to embarrass myself or my friend, so I ""limited"" myself to three trips to that buffet line, but I could've easily doubled that.  The dessert selection was also really solid, great banana bread pudding, creme brulees, etc., they definitely didn't ignore the quality of desserts.  Yeah it's a little formal in there and is definitely a good ol' boys club (I think I was the only non-white person in there), but hey, if you can get in, why not?If it wasn't limited to having to go with a member, I'm pretty sure I'd be happy to go there and pay whatever it is they're asking for.  Best buffet in NYC I've been to for sure...but I guess that's not saying too much huh?",5,4,6

26,Campbell K.,"Manhattan, NY",78,79,64,5.0,3/10/2011,"I love the University Club. I remember the first time I came to the establishment, when I was just a wee lad, and marveling at the grandiosity of the place. Normally, when I return to places from my youth, I am strongly underwhelmed, usually mentioning that ""I remember it being much bigger/nicer/more wonderous"", but at the U. Club, no such problems arise. I am thinking of a movie that could be the exact corollary, maybe the Royal Tenenbaums' homestead, but regardless, it reminds me strongly of the clubs I frequented around my childhood home in Georgetown, D.C. Large carved handrail posts, framed oil canvas paintings of universities and presidents, beautiful old crystal chandeliers - all are apparent and done with distinction. Yes, as others have mentioned, you have to wear a blazer and tie (at the very least), but I am always up for the opportunity to dress to the nines, and since you have to be a member or a member's guest to enter, it is really just a classic formality than the actual sabre of classism. I generally like to go a little old-school with the look, maybe throw in a deconstructed tie or my grandfather's collar bar - little eccentricities that would go unnoticed anywhere else. Dinner is always a treat. I don't care who you are, the kind of upscale heartiness that is on-menu at places of this caliber is always a welcome and delectable surprise. Obviously I don't do this immediately after playing squash (my main reason for attending, usually), but sometimes after unwinding with a drink and having a shower (and a moment to realize how damnably hungry I am), it can be a wonderful reward of sorts. I most enjoy meeting the professors that come through here. Many are rich first, and educators second, thus posses a kind of high-minded intellect that meshes very nicely with their ostentatious pretention. I had one of my most engaging conversations of all time with an American history professor, wherein we argued (heatedly) over William Hearst's role in the Yellow Journalism and the Spanish-American War, in a bar setting no less.

Tie and jacket required, guard look up and down to make sure you are up to thier standard, etc. Interior was just as attractive as exterior itself, you get the feeling of all the history that this place hosted in the past. Now, here comes the reality. They have a wall dedicating to those whom lost at foreign war. I looked, and the last member who died was Korean War, or should I say 50 years ago. I guess if you can be a member, you never have to serve or sacrifice because they are too important to make money. Nice. No cellphone or ""PDA"" (Does anyone still use PDA?)

32,Justin C.,"Boston, MA",655,359,11,4.0,4/25/2007,"Right down to the glass cylinders full of the blue stuff you put your combs in, this place most nearly reminds me of Caddyshack. Peopled with blueblood Ivy Leaguers, membership requires a series of written recommendations from current members, and even then there's usually a waiting list. They require shoes and a collared shirt (possibly even a jacket) to go in the front door. Chett Webb would indeed be proud.Naytheless, I can't deny my preppy roots, and I enjoy this place. It's primary function is as a squash club, though they have a range of other fitness options and social events, most of which would likely remind you of cocktail hour at the country club. I've gone solely to play squash. They have a bunch of courts which are in decent shape, but honestly could use some upkeep. They do feature a nice pro shop, and the Australian pro keeps a fried full of Cooper's, an Aussie micro brew all too infrequently seen on these shores, and is always ready to share one after you've played.The good bit about this place is the relaxation amenities. They have one of the best steam rooms I've ever been in, it's like something out of Alexander the Great's personal home in that it feels ancient, with it's white slab marble walls and square shape. But it fills slowly and constantly circulates steam, which is great - much nicer than steam rooms that burst full and then dissipate. And the steam room is adjacent to their sauna, which is also very nice, and has a number of chaise lounges for maximum relaxation. They also have a pool - men only - in which the members swim naked. This was hilarious to me when I first went here, but once your try it, you realize that it's awesome.",7,5,6

The lockers/dressing rooms are incredible and sort of make you wonder if they should just be lockers after all. The bathrooms are always fully stacked and very clean.You have to be a member to be able to take part of the events, but if you can get a current member to invite you to an event, you are sure to have a blast.The only letdown is that you must wear a coat & tie to get in (even if you are a member) which may force you to enter through the service entrance if all you are going to do that particular day is to play squash or use the gym.  I guess the proper attire gives the club a certain air of civility and respect that perhaps is missing from our daily lives, so it's not necessarily bad after all...Oh, don't forget to try their desserts during buffets.
