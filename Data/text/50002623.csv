Updated review","Small place, narrow corridors but pours a bright bitter brew, got the dulce cold..was fabulous to taste and smell",,,
1,Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2265,1601,649,3.0,5/27/2018,"This place is a staple when we are trolling the 14th street area. They have some pretty unique coffee flavors such as rose water and lavender. The space is small but clean, the staff is friendly and the coffee is consistently good.",10,2,6
2,Thu N.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",112,137,229,4.0,9/13/2018,A small cafe close to union square. I got the matcha latte and it was tasty. It's was creamy  and the workers were really nice.,1,,1
3,Carly L.,"New York, NY",171,239,229,4.0,9/9/2018,"The latte lavender is lovely! The regular latte was also good, but I liked the extra hint of flavoring in the latte lavender. They also do beautiful latte art. This isn't a great place to spend long periods of time in; there are only a few stools along the wall by a narrow counter. It would definitely be better as a to-go coffee place.",1,1,2
4,Vicki G.,"New York, NY",1,97,271,3.0,11/9/2018,I think this coffee shop is alright. The staff is really friendly. But there is no bathroom. It's more of a to go coffee shop. I had their pumpkin spice coffee which was alright and their savory scone that was also alright. But the person next to me really liked their breakfast sandwich.,,,
5,Awol G.,"New York, NY",0,40,0,5.0,8/5/2018,"Sure, no bathroom, barely any place to sit, no WIFI, this is a hole in the wall, but shut up because they have Rose and Lavender water. Plus, one of their baristas - the man has gorgeous long dreads and carries a chic bag - also happens to have the sickest foam game in town, even with soy milk which we all know is garbage when it comes to one trying to make foam... and he plays pretty decent music. So yeah, you use the bathroom at Whole Foods and go there, because you live in New York and these are you baseline skills.",,,1
6,Shana H.,"Brooklyn, NY",263,249,218,5.0,5/8/2018,Walked in here after wondering where I could find the same coffee they sell in my neighborhood and was pleasantly surprised that they had the exact same one. I was greeted on a friendly manner by the cashier who was patient as I fumbled around for my wallet. The store offers some great vegan-friendly and healthy options. Great experience!,4,,
7,Kate S.,"New York, NY",76,679,3070,3.0,8/7/2017,"Cafe is small and quaint, service was very nice, the coffee was just okay (it tasted a bit burnt).",,1,
8,Sherry D.,"New York, NY",226,155,112,5.0,11/25/2016,"Wandered in on a Thursday waiting for the Dos Toros hype to be fulfilled, but this place may have stolen the show. Sickest punk rock beats from the staff, and I could honestly stay forever here.I got my hands on an awesome latte, a bit pricier but oh so good, and hung out to chat with the coolest/friendliest staff. They carry dough donuts! Worth a drop in for morning coffee for a coffee and people pick me up. Would definitely recommend.",1,,
9,Jeremy J.,"Crown Heights, NY",43,19,0,5.0,11/7/2017,"This is my go-to from now til ??? Coffee is good, it's a tiny little shop, very efficient and friendly staff, everything I need. I wouldn't call it no frills because there are a few frills here and there but I'll never know because I'm mostly unfrilled myself. Frills include: pastries, a modest food menu, salads and a few bottled drinks and whatnot. This is getting five star from me because usually I'm hitting it up before work and just want to be in and out, and the staff is chill. If you're looking for a place to sit down and have a chat where you won't be overheard this ain't that, but if you want a quick good coffee or latte or lil sumthin then this IS that place and is worth a visit.",,,2
10,Donna W.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,24,45,1.0,6/8/2018,"I went to the E 14th Street location purposely for the Oat Matcha latte at 8:15PM. They said they were out of Matcha and that the 4th Ave location will definitely have it. He said that location closes at 8:30PM, and I ask him to confirm since the one I was in (E 14th St) close at 9 PM. He then said yes it close at 9PM. I went over and it was only 8:30PM and it looked like they were closed for awhile! Not a simple person inside. Not going to even bother with this place since they can't even get the store hr correct!",,,
11,Jess L.,"New Haven, CT",3282,4308,3309,3.0,9/2/2017,"Good location for a quick coffee. I got a flat white ($4) in a jiffy. While it did the trick, it didn't have the richness of most flat whites I've had. I'm not sure why. However, it was a nice jolt of energy.",5,2,2
12,Tina W.,"New York, NY",438,908,1237,4.0,7/9/2016,"2ND VISIT FOR Le CafeApparently, this place takes coffee more seriously.LOLIt's tiny, but you can have some space to chat with friends.The guy knows how to make coffeeIce latte is pretty good And service is nice, staff is patient.Might be my go-to spot tho",2,1,2
13,Roxanne O.,"Freehold Township, NJ",74,594,716,5.0,5/7/2017,"Good coffee, good croissant, tiny space. I recommend it as a stop and not a stay a drink coffee. Irregardless, the coffee was worth the money and I would recommend to anyone passing by.",,,
14,Ashley K.,"Chicago, IL",178,69,53,5.0,4/7/2018,"Staff are SUPER friendly and considerate. Brightened my day! A+ customer service skills, would love to see these guys given an award or a raise. Thanks for the oat milk recommendation, super refreshing and added a nice oatmeal flavor that enhanced the spice of my iced chai. Brownie tasted awesome too, rich, fudgy, and fresh!",,,1
15,Phylicia K.,"Hollywood, FL",285,587,789,5.0,7/26/2017,"This was such a great find! Thanks, Yelp friends! This is such a cool boutique coffee shop!The joint is small, just a side bar with a few stools. Seems that most people really take their coffee and snacks to go. I had some time to kill and was thrilled to get spot at the bar, have easy access to a plug to charge my phone and free wifi! The staff was super cool and friendly! I went with a large tea and tried the avocado toast. OMG you guys, this was the best avocado toast it's actually called the L'avocat Toast which is made with hass avocado smash topped with chili flakes, toasted seeds, pink salt and extra virgin olive oil . All on a thick piece of multigrain bread. The chili flakes, toasted seed and pink salt where so key in taking this breakfast staple to another level! And the presentation was unreal! I also didn't just go for the classic boring tea. I had to have the Rose Citrus Green Tea which was a citrus green tea infused with a cold pressed rose. A COLD PRESSED ROSE. Yup, and it was worth it! Wish we had a place like this in Florida - hint hint! I would absolutely come back again while in NYC. I actually went multiple times while in the City.",2,2,2
16,Joe H.,"Manhattan, NY",102,262,1046,4.0,6/27/2017,"This was a great place. Small but nicely put together. Staff was super nice and helpful. I loved my coffee. I had the double L. It was a Lavender latte, iced. Quad shot with a hint of lavender from an exact. It was great. No sugar needed. The flavor was smooth and wasn't bitter. Fantastic. High recommend it.",1,,1
17,Fitness G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,15,12,5.0,10/23/2017,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this coffee spot!They make an awesome cup of coffee. Gives me my boost before my workouts. I love me a good cup!",,,
18,Addison K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,7/26/2018,"Great, tiny coffee joint. What Newsbar used to be. Had the new gluten-free breakfast special, very fresh and good.",,,
19,Ruth P.,"Union City, NJ",7,18,20,5.0,6/27/2017,Love love this coffee.$2.50 Well worth it. Nice and strong and their service is good.,,,
20,Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",477,172,201,5.0,6/5/2016,"Stumbled upon this cute little café because my friend needed caffeine. We tried the latte lavender and latte ""en rose."" Both were really good and satisfied our caffeine fix with a very subtle hint of the flowers.They also have donuts too but we weren't hungry enough to order one. If I'm in this area again, I'd definitely come back to try them though! They're huge and looked a lot like the donuts from Dough. There's a hibiscus one that I kept eyeing.",2,1,1
21,George C.,"New York, NY",0,7750,14306,4.0,4/6/2016,"They accept the Dollop App, code PXWRXPGrabbed the 'Cookie Oatmeal' for $2.75, which was pretty tasty, and comparable in quality to the chocolate chip pecan cookie I scored at their very-close location on 14th.",2,,
22,Fran S.,"Ithaca, NY",0,6,7,4.0,4/28/2017,"Nice scone! Tried the signature lavender coffee too. Not too acidic, which is great! Bought a hibiscus donut as well. Love the interiors by the way! :) to better improve ambience, staff could have been friendlier.",,,
23,Johnny R.,"Playa Del Rey, Los Angeles, CA",50,224,157,3.0,3/7/2017,Located in the heart of Manhattan this tiny places serves up a wide variety of hot drinks and cold. Trying to endure the blistering cold of NYC winter we dropped in for a cup of hot Java. It definitely had the feel of the city as people are buzzing in and out to get there fix . Makes it feel a lot more packed and busy since it's a small establishment. The barista was very helpful and gave me her suggestions. I settled for a Carmel macchiato that had the perfect balance of sweet yet strong enough to hold the coffee taste just like I like it and instructed the barista she nailed it kudos to her for that. Only knock I had was the drink was on the lukewarm side but possibly because  it was so darn cold outside. Also I prefer the calmer chill back atmosphere instead of the rush in and rush out hustle and bustle coffee joints this place seems to be. But if you don't mind the place has great coffee and service m.,,,
24,Dave W.,"Safety Harbor, FL",408,1225,3074,4.0,12/18/2016,"This tiny one-barista shop serves up a proper espresso with a rich, chocolatey flavor. It provides the desired bolt of energy sometimes necessary to brave the NYC day.",1,1,1
25,Elizabeth D.,"Manhattan, NY",251,11,5,5.0,9/4/2017,Amazing lattes and also donuts from Dough Donuts! Friendly service.  Owned by two great French foodies who really care! They also have locations in Paris.,,,

29,Kelly W.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",29,39,5,4.0,7/6/2017,"Yummy iced dirty chai latte!  Service is ok, could use a little polishing. Also, please stock stevia.",,,
30,Gina F.,"New York, NY",26,260,252,4.0,11/29/2015,"Cute coffee shop next to the monstrosity Walgreens on the corner of 4th Ave. If you aren't from the neighborhood and don't know where to find good coffee nearby you will actually bump right into this one. I recommend it. They have la colombe, that's why I came in. Of course they use a marzocco, second clue that this place is worth visiting. Take a seat in one of several stools and sit for a few before heading into the NYC madness of Union square. Btw, food items look good too.",,,
31,Jee C.,"Saddle Brook, NJ",0,1,1,4.0,1/18/2017,Nice petite cafe with great coffee. Relaxing environment with good music but not recommended for groups since it only offers five seats. Perfect place for coffee drinkers looking for peaceful alone time.,,,
32,Sharonid L.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",103,13,16,3.0,3/9/2017,The coffee was less than impressive. My homemade latte is more interesting than their cappuccino. It wasn't BAD but I wouldn't really pay 4 bucks for it again,,1,
33,Gordon Y.,"Rego Park, NY",528,222,1305,5.0,7/28/2016,"Only had the iced latte and iced mocha here, but they were some of the best iced drinks I have ever had in any coffee shop.  Nothing diluted and full of robust flavor.",,,

35,Lisa T.,"Chicago, IL",293,8,13,5.0,4/5/2017,"Randomly found this place as I was on the way to meet some friends. I am from Chicago, and didn't look up Le Cafe prior to stopping in. I ordered a latte and it was delicious! I recommend it :)",,,
36,Eileen C.,"Philadelphia, PA",155,57,122,4.0,1/31/2016,Good standard cortado espresso. Super friendly and sweet baristas with free wifi!!It's a cozy small space good for doing work and having intimate conversations conveniently located right by union square =],1,,
37,Gregory C.,"San Francisco, CA",92,203,23,5.0,11/20/2015,"I love coffee and prefer to make it myself. I enjoy both the process and the result. Le Cafe Coffee, however, made me the perfect Americano. Finally, someone who brought a tear to my eye. I tip my hat to Le Cafe Coffee! I shall return on my next visit to NYC.",1,1,
38,Alvin U.,"New York, NY",1,19,1,5.0,12/4/2015,"If I could give 100 stars, I would! This is my favorite cafe in NYC. Customer serviceEveryone is so friendly and exuberant no matter what kind of day it is. On my worst days, I came here and always left with a smile simply because the owners connect with me. They remember their customers, it really makes you feel like experience is more than a transaction. They offer customers drinks based on our preferences and what we might enjoy. They treat every person so well! My favorite Barista is Chloe ; she really knows what she's doing. Quality The baristas always make their drinks with such passion.  And more importantly, the way they prepare the espresso beverages is consistent so you always get excellent results. They grind the espresso each time (so you know it's fresh) If you order a latte and a cappuccino you can easily distinguish between the two because they make the drinks one at a time, really putting love into each beverage. Also, EVERY single cup has latte art on it (EVEN when it is rush hour!)It's a shame to drink sometimes! Environment It's a very clean store. Whenever there's downtime someone is always tidying up the store to make it suitable for new customers who may walk in. Overall this is an authentic coffee shop.  The espresso tastes good and the best pastries I recommend are the macaroons! I'd recommend this store to anyone who likes espresso.",1,,1
39,Can D.,"Sunnyside, NY",53,4,6,4.0,5/25/2016,It is a small coffee shop but you can also find some pastries. I got lemon donut and iced latte.There was a misunderstanding about my order but  staff was so helpful. They just corrected real quick.Thank you guys:),,,
