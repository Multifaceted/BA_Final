0,Stephanie C.,"Manhattan, NY",694,11,6,5.0,8/23/2018,"I honestly wanted to like them soooo bad! First time I tried to book (granted I bought a Gilt City deal so I was already assuming I might be treated as bottom tier for clients), it took almost a week for someone to get back to me about the class I wanted to sign up for the previous weekend. I ended up just showing up for the class and since they didn't take role they took me no problem which was fine... but it started 15 mins late (which I now realize is somewhat typical for some classes clases).... I've reached out multiple times with questions and have never received a response. When showing up for my class today, I went to the room # that they had texted me (which was incorrect by 9 floors - apparently this is typical according to the other studio that shares space with them) so I honestly almost left because I was fed up but I decided to give it one last shot and I'm SOO glad I did... I half way through writing this review (it was a 1 star at the time) and THEN I walked into Tiana's Rachet Fitness class so put my phone away.. when I walked out my mind was completely changed! She was amazing, the class was SO much fun, such a good workout and easy to keep up with and just an all-around awesome dance party. So glad I gave it one last shot because I'm definitely coming back to Tiana's classes. She's a rockstar and leads kick ass dance parties.",,,
1,Ann S.,"Brooklyn, NY",54,193,450,4.0,11/12/2017,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to give try one of the classes at banana skirt productions. I ended up taking ratchet fitness because that what everyone seem to recommend. Booking the class is super easy, you go to their website and pick the class/time you want. I think first timers get the class for a discounted price. Once class started I forgot that it was a workout, I had a blast. The music was on point and while you follow the instructor. There really isn't much choreography that you need to know. Everyone is just having a great time and sweating a ton. Before you know it, class is over. The instructors are super energetic and really hypes you up. The next day you'll probably be sore, but you wont even mind it so much.",2,,

Updated review","I took another class with Nikki and it was awesome! She is such a great dancer and so much fun. She explained the choreography well and I had a blast. Again, this is a quick run down of the choreography so for me personally, it was hard to pick it up well. But I still had a blast.",,,
3,Lesley Y.,"Forest Hills, NY",230,18,0,2.0,10/27/2017,"I wouldn't say this is the place to go if you're looking to work on your skill. I've been dancing for almost 10 yrs through places like BDC, Alvin Ailey, Steps on Broadway, my college dance team, etc, and in comparison Banana Skirt leaves something to be desired when it comes to technique. A lot of their explanations are reduced to ""it's something like this"" and they gloss over it, depriving people an understanding of the physiques behind certain moves. I've been twice and was hoping the second time would undo my initial impression, but that didn't happen, so I'm writing this review to give a heads up to those may be looking for something specific in their ""dance"" class. If you're strictly looking for a fun way to do cardio ala Zumba style, I think this is perfectly fine, they've got a very nice/energetic staff. However I'd say there are a lot of better places to learn dance.",2,1,

Updated review","The throw back ratchet fitness class was dope, off the hook, bad, off the chain, the bomb. What other word or phrase could I use to describe how amazingly incredible this class was. I thought it was going to be like the first class I took, learning a choreography and pausing to go over the moves. NOT AT ALL. It was a real party from the start, with songs from the 90's, 2000's, and today. Every song took you back to another time, the ladies were singing to every song, we were popping our booty, criss crossing,  doing the running man, the butterfly and much much more. We were dancing to Beyoncé,  TLC, Boys to Men, Michael Jackson. I loved it. I don't think I've ever loved a dance class more than this one. I was all kinds of sexy and ratchet.",2,,2

Updated review",Banana Skirts seems to have definitely changed. I brought two friends to a class for the first time and the choreo was very hard for people who weren't dancers and for those of us that were- there weren't any counts provided. The previous young women who used to do check in and took the videos was always prompt in posting- but the past two classes I took the videos never appeared on dropbox :(,1,,
6,Molly S.,"New York, NY",103,527,405,4.0,4/10/2017,"I booked a ""dance class"" through Banana Skirt productions. The class is in a pretty modest dance studio, which can get pretty warm in the heat! The class is set up where you learn choreography for about 45mins and get to dance the full dance a couple times near the end. 5/5 for how much fun! Not exactly a class you'd go into thinking you're getting your workout for the day, but something fun to do and mix up your workout schedule. Also, any level is welcome, this in no way requires previous dance experience.",1,,1
7,Sarah N.,"San Francisco, CA",15,175,91,5.0,6/28/2017,One of my favorite things to do when I'm visiting NYC! The choreo is always fun and all levels/experience are welcome and can enjoy the class. My sister says Ratchet Zooba is the best class they offer.,2,,1
8,Jenny V.,"New York, NY",54,7,0,4.0,4/21/2018,"This is a really fun class idea. I've been twice to the Channel Your Inner Popstar classes, both times with Marissa, who was very friendly and welcoming regardless of your dance level (mine is low). You'll do a brief warm-up (abs/some cardio) and then learn choreography from a popular song. I took a teenage friend who loves to dance and she had a blast both times--plus she loved seeing the video on Instagram afterwards.",,,
9,Tina B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,40,0,4.0,3/19/2018,"As far as dance exercise classes go, Banana Skirt is definitely one of the better studios. Here's what I love:- Tiana Hester is a rockstar and hands down the best instructor on the roster. She's a phenomenal dance, has great energy, and has an excellent teaching style. - Despite there usually being a lot of people lined up outside just before class starts, check-in is always very quick. - They always offer water bottles so you don't have to worry about stepping out of class to hunt down a water fountain if you forgot to fill up before going to class.- They do a great job of creating a genuinely welcoming environment for dancers of all levels. And here's why I had to take off a star:- Not all of the instructors are created equal. Many of them are just so-so dancers, and the good ones tend to leave to teach elsewhere. More importantly, though, some of them just don't do a good job when it comes to setting out counts/marking moves, planning choreography to match the level of the class and time constraints, and keeping a steady pace while teaching. I've experience these scenarios multiple times: the instructor rushes through teaching without making sure that most of the class has a solid grasp before moving on with the end result being a jumbled mess, or the instructor spends too much time on difficult sequences and lose track of pacing and all of a sudden they're rushing because whoops! there's only 7 minutes left to teach the last 4 8-counts, record, and cool down. - the location of the classes can change after you first book it, as their classes bounce between buildings across the street from each other and between floors. It's frustrating when you arrive at one building only to find out that the class is across the street and before you know it you've lost the first 5-10 minutes of instruction just trying to get yourself to the right location.",,,
10,Ashley V.,"Brooklyn, NY",149,140,390,5.0,7/10/2016,"Found Banana Skirt through Classpass and this is probably my favorite place to go. I always ALWAYS use my three times per month here. The class I've taken the most has been Sorry (the Bieber one) because you know I had to know that!! I've taken it with a couple different instructors and it seemed like they broke down the choreography much better when the class first rolled out (now it kinda seems like they teach the exact Mandy Jiroux YouTube tutorial but that's cool too, it's still lots of fun).I've recently discovered Ratchet Zooba as well and this is most definitely going to make its way into my regular rotation. I was literally dripping sweat and couldn't help but smile the entire class -- this is a legit blast. Darkened room, flashing lights, and exactly the kind of moves you'd expect from a class called Ratchet Zooba. One of the most original classes I've taken and I'll for sure be back again. Make sure you check which location your class is before you show up! There are multiple locations and I've unfortunately made the mistake of going to the wrong one before. Luckily everyone is nice and there is a grace period for joining the class a few minutes late (within reason).",2,,
11,Claudina M.,"Laurel, MD",2,1,5,5.0,11/8/2017,"One of the best work out experiences I've ever had!  The concept of dance, music (rachet music) and shedding some calories is motivating concept.  I had the best time learning the routine to lastest Beyoncé video, especially since i think I'm Beyoncé behind closed doors.  There was tremendous energy, laughter and fun on the dance floor.   The instructor was easy to follow and had great patience with us.  This visit was during my year winter trip to NYC so Banana Skirt has becoming a yearly visit too!   Thank you Akinah and Staff for being so professional!! Claudina",,,
12,Chante E.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,5.0,11/4/2016,"I'm actually reluctant to write this.  I'm a just a teeny bit selfish and don't want the whole NYC finding out about my ""spot.""  I discovered Banana Skirt from Class pass and then took advantage of some really great deals that Banana Skirt offered.  Since then I've been completely hooked!  Every time I try to dabble away and say ""let me try this new dance class from such and such new studio,"" I'm literally disappointed EVERY single time. No other dance class can compare to the dynamics of Banana Skirt.  The music is ALWAYS up to date and on point!  Another thing I appreciate is that I never feel like I'm lost with any of the moves (can't say that for those other classes that I took at different studios).  A really big plus too is that the owner, the instructors and the staff that assist all have really great personalities and make you feel at home. Ratchet Zooba is by far the BEST class they offer - and the new throwback edition that they just started offering is straight FIRE.  Look here, I get my ENTIRE life EVERY week by taking 2-3 of these classes.  If you want to get the most out of your workout (sweat alot) then take this class.  It really just feels like you're at a big party with a bunch of your friends.  No one is paying attention to you, and you literally can ""become someone else"" once those lights dim and the strobe light comes on.  The choreography classes are also fun but aren't really ""high impact"".Listen..there are no ""cons"".  Sure it gets crowded at times (mostly during the hotter months).Yes it gets ridiculously hot & you'll feel like you're in HELL.I'll gladly spend my money here because it's WORTH it - I'M WORTH it - period.Last tidbit of pertinent info. regarding the instructors - Zack & Tiana are my faves!",6,1,1
13,Hannah K.,"New York, NY",183,43,6,5.0,8/14/2016,"Two words: RATCHET ZOOBA!SO much fun and you will sweat your butt off. Zack Zack is hilarious and sassy. I've taken this class a few times and my only con was that there was a lot of repetition week to week (same playlist and choreo?) - but I'm hoping that was only because I went consecutive weeks in a row and throughout time it changes it up. The birthday dance off at the end gets a little old after a few times but hey, maybe some people love it.If you're taking this class, check your inhibitions at the door and let yourself let loose for an hour!Also- just a heads up that they take pics / vids throughout which are posted the next day. If you don't want to be famous, get a spot further away from the door.",2,1,1
14,Alicya P.,"Manhattan, NY",9,56,0,4.0,9/16/2016,"A lot of expensive, sleek, boutique exercise places make a big deal out of ""good vibes"" but this place actually delivers them in the most unpretentious and sincere way possible. I've only been to one class and it was a pretty motley crew: wide variety of dress, body types, even ages. (A woman with short gray hair who did NOT look like someone you'd expect to listen to Kanye seemed to be having a great time.) It felt there were a fair amount of regulars but just as many people who were new or don't have great rhythm or dance experience...and it really doesn't matter. The classes are crowded, yes, but one of the benefits to that is that you'll never feel like anyone is looking at you or that you're standing out. (Of course, the drawback is that it can be really hard to see the instructor, even with the mirrors, and that's kind of a big problem.)Honestly, the workout wasn't the best--I didn't get particularly sweaty or feel very tired--but that might have had to do with the tempo of the song and the style of the dance, and I knew what I was signing up for, mostly--but I wanted to do it anyway because the Fade video/dance is so amazing. The best part about the experience was hands down the instructor's competent but positive and friendly demeanor, and the willingness of everyone there to laugh and have fun. I'm sure it sounds corny but it feels really nice once you're in the mix :) They even bring some complimentary bottles of water, which is really sweet, but it looks like they had about 6 bottles of them for a class of at least 30 people. So bring your own if you think you'll get thirsty! I'm going to give them at least two more tries to see if some of the other sections can deliver a bit more in the cardio department.",1,,
15,Nica H.,"Manhattan, NY",6,72,4,5.0,5/10/2017,"Fun! I had a blast dancing with the instructor and other students. The regulars who can dance their​ butts off, and are on a first name basis with the instructor stay in the front. The rest of us are equally awkward, but making progress.

17,Yoonie Y.,"Manhattan, NY",59,363,4,4.0,2/9/2015,Banana Skirt will give you a fun workout that will leave you dripping sweat! I found this studio through Classpass but their instagram presence is also on spot. I'm too uncoordinated to try a choreography class but ratchet zooba is a complete blast. It really does just feel like dancing in a club without any inhibitions. Im pretty sure I look like a mess trying to attempt all of the moves but the lights are off so no one can judge me! All of the instructors and staff are so nice and hilarious. Also complimentary water is provided. You'll definitely need it. Give Banana Skirt a try - you won't regret it!,5,2,2
18,Raisa R.,"Manhattan, NY",2,6,0,4.0,5/7/2016,"Banana Skirt was my first class with ClassPass. I took two classes with them to date and had such a fun time learning a choreography! Both classes started with a warm up stretch. One then proceeded to a dance cardio warm-up (read: grapevines to get your heart rate up) and then some ab work- which was surprising but very welcomed! The second class I took was running a bit late so after the warm-up it was straight to learning the choreography.Once the instructor teaches all you need to know, the class gets split in half (or thirds if it's a bigger one), and then you dance your heart out. Then you run it all together, end with a freestyle circle, and then a cool down.The atmosphere is generally no-stress: you can flail around, miss the steps, left arm goes up when it should be right, land on the wrong foot and no one would really judge. However, they do record the class when you dance the whole choreo when the room is split and then together which is also uploaded to their website. So to the camera-shy, be warned! I didn't expect that at all so I was thrown off running the number because I felt super self-conscious that I was being recorded. (Sure, it gives the music video effect but still a bit shocking!) I also wish the instructors emphasized staggering a bit more- I was left staring into the curtains on the side of the mirror for one class and I had to always re-stagger myself since no one else really was. Other than that, their choreographies are on point and it's such a fun time!",2,,

20,Amanda H.,"Manhattan, NY",169,28,67,5.0,2/23/2016,"Banana Skirt Productions is definitely my favorite dance studio that I've found in the city. I've tried out various studios and usually they're pretty overwhelming, as even NYC ""beginners"" classes are filled with people who are just brushing up on their skills. This studio truly provides open level classes. The classes are easy to follow, even if you're new, and even if you're a more experienced dancer, they're a great work out and a LOT of fun! They offer a variety of classes - ratchet zooba, hit makers series - where basically they will teach you choreo from various artists' music videos (I've been to Beyonce classes, Britney Spears classes, Nicki Minaj classes, a Missy Elliot class, even a Taylor Swift class, and I'm still waiting to go to a Justin Bieber ""Sorry"" class), amongst others, and have even added yoga / pilates to their class offerings, which I want to try soon! Found this studio with some friends and got a 5-class package, over a year ago. Then I joined ClassPass and thankfully this was one of the studios offered! ClassPass spaces for each class are limited though, so be sure to sign up as early as you can. The classes have been getting more and more crowded. But I always leave every class feeling incredibly energized and refreshed! Absolute favorite class: ratchet zooba. It's a high-energy zumba class, with an all rap/hip-hop playlist, which the instructor changes every month. They turn the lights off and turn on little disco lights around the room, so everyone gets less self-conscious and you can really focus on getting your best work out possible, and just have fun! Best instructors: Zack (for ratchet zooba) & Tiana (for anything else!)To get a sense of what classes will be like, check out their website and also their Instagram. They're so cute and will either post a video clip or a class photo shortly after each offering. Absolutely would recommend this studio to anyone looking for a lot of fun and for a stress-free class. Check out the schedule on their website! It's also really fun attending these classes with friends, so if you're feeling a little anxious, grab someone you'd be comfortable having a dance party with :)",2,,1
21,Gloria L.,"New York, NY",134,105,7,4.0,5/9/2016,"Pros: if you're into pop choreography, beiber, Beyoncé or hip hop, you will crave going to class every week. Zack is excellent. Took a beiber class and a few ratchet Zuba classes  -- great workout, music, instruction and get ready to sweat. The environment and students are fun and welcoming, not intimidating like other studios. The teachers rotate to different sides of the room. What I like most is the classes work for total dance newbies or more experienced students -- the teachers make everyone feel comfortable practicing the choreography. Cons: Some of the more popular classes are packed, but you're still able to get your dance on. Tips: give yourself extra time getting to class because the elevators get busy. Classes are held in one of two studios across the street from each other on 8th Ave near Penn Station, so make sure you have the right place before you go.",,,1

There's warmup, stretching, choreography, routine,  performance. They record the class btw. If you don't want to be seen go to the back like I do I bought a dance package and I'm going to try Rachet Zooba. Can't wait",,,

27,Maki Y.,"New York, NY",289,244,358,4.0,4/14/2015,"Banana Skirt offers dance fitness classes that are fun, stress-free, and productive. I  attended two classes that were choreography classes to popular *NSync and Britney songs and had a great time! It also seems like the Beyonce classes are equally, if not more, popular, but I'm a bit reluctant to try those since I have another studio/instructor I really like. Banana Skirt also offers ""Ratchet Zooba"" classes in which zumba moves are taught in a dark room with strobe lights to mimic a club atmosphere, in addition to African and Dancehall fusion classes. The choreography classes were very organized, and I was surprised with how much we learned in just one hour. The first ten to fifteen minutes were spent on stretches, cardio, and strengthening exercises, and then we went right along to learning the choreography one count of eight at a time. After we learned each chunk, we were able to practice it with the music. I really loved that we changed lines halfway through so that the people in the back were able to come up toward the mirrors. After we learned the choreography - almost all of the steps were identical to the steps in the music videos - we were broken up into three smaller groups and each group performed the routine. The instructors stressed that it wasn't about knowing all of the steps, but that it was about having fun and working up a sweat in the process. Note: Videos and pictures are taken at the end of class and they're uploaded to Banana Skirt's Instagram page. Likelihood of another visit:I really liked that we learned the steps from music videos that I had watched and rewatched during my teen years. Twenty dollars per class is steep, but I think it's worth it maybe once or twice a month. They also offer package deals ($80 for 5 classes, $160 for 10 classes, $300 for unlimited) but I'm not sure if those deals have expiration dates.",6,3,6

He is easy to follow and makes you feel comfortable no matter what level of dancer you are. I highly reccomend ratchet zoomba, and I will definately be back!",,,
39,Silli K.,"New London, CT",34,210,9,4.0,1/2/2015,"Like another reviewer said, Banana skirt is hit and miss. I have had the BEST time in their Beyonce class, but another time I wasn't fond of the instructor & choreography and the room was way too crowded. Worth trying again!",4,,1
40,B C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0,5.0,10/15/2015,"This is one of my favorite studios on Classpass!  The classes are low pressure, high energy and a solid workout.  And you're laughing the whole time because the instructors and the choreography are so much fun, so it's a real stress-reliever.  They do a lot of old school videography, but also plenty of new school, plus ""ratchet"" Zumba and yoga.  I always leave there in a great mood",,,
41,Finly D.,"Manhattan, NY",54,40,9,5.0,8/10/2015,"Personally I found it to be super fulfilling. The right amount of cardio, fun and sweat. This is a great way to push yourself and try new things with no shame. Out of breath and it feels so good! Zack is an awesome teacher!! Friendly staff always a plus too :D",,,
42,Yasmene S.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,4.0,5/29/2015,"Very friendly and welcoming staff and always a fun time! Some of the moves can be hard to keep up with, depending on the songs/choreography, but the instructors are very encouraging and are all about ensuring that we're having a good time. I like that complimentary water bottles are provided at each session. It's not a high impact work out by any means, but that's fine because I take other classes for that - this is more about having fun and focusing on the choreography. Highly recommended!",,,
43,d j.,"New York, NY",0,20,4,4.0,5/23/2015,"Banana Skirt offers choreographed classes. My favorite are Beyoncé-related but they offer other artists songs like Taylor Swift, J Timberlake, Usher, JAY Z etc..  I  have take two classes already . Already thinking about my next one.   The teacher take there time to go over the steps. and you dont have to be a dancer..  Nice way to change up your same old gym routine..  I love it...",,,
44,Tu T.,"New York, NY",33,23,5,5.0,11/24/2014,"Took a Beyonce ""Love on Top"" dance class with Zack on a Saturday afternoon and LOVED IT. Everyone is just there to have fun so you don't have to feel bad if you have no dance experience. Plus, the staff at Banana Skirt are all so nice and welcoming. The routine was perfect - he slowed down the moves so that we aren't cramming a whole dance routine into an hour. They even brought water bottles for everyone! Looking forward to the other classes that they offer!",,,
45,Jay A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,126,0,4.0,9/26/2014,"The instruction can be a bit hit-or-miss, but the songs they pick to choreograph are all fun hits. The class is a very supportive environment, and they don't take themselves as seriously as Ailey Extension (which is both a good and bad thing). I will probably be back, because I love learning choreography to JAMS THAT MAKE IT CLAP IN THE CLUB",,1,
