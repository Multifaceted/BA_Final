0,Phil G.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",91,604,218,4.0,9/13/2018,"This hotel is a whole lot better than the reviews would lead you to believe.  I have passed this Hilton Garden Inn dozens of times, in years gone by, without giving it a second look. It is located in my preferred area of New York. Since 1990, I only stay downtown; Soho, Tribeca, Battery Park, The Village, Nolita, The East Village, and the Lower East Side are the only options.  You won't see me midtown. Ain't going to happen. In the past I have stayed at the Soho Grand, the Tribeca Grand (The Roxy) The Smyth, The James, The Thompson, Hampton Inn on Watts, The Trump Soho, Duane Street Hotel, The Conrad, etc. Yes, I have stayed at a lot of hotels through the years. Hotel prices and hotel taxes in New York have gone up exponentially.  The pricing can be ridiculous. The Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca is in a fantastic and safe location, walking distance to the Village, Soho, Little Italy, Chinatown, the East Village etc. The day time personnel are great, but beware of the weekly, night time staff. They can be surly.  Rooms are small, but clean with good water pressure, excellent AC, and our room was quiet. Bathrooms are also tiny, but everything works.  When the Tribeca Hilton Garden Inn is $60 or more per night cheaper than the other hotels in the area, that is irresistible. Just think what that can buy, or the great meals you can have with the money saved. This will be my #1 go to hotel on future trips to New York. Hopefully, I'll save a ton of dough.",3,,1
1,Setra S.,"Beverly Hills, CA",51,25,14,2.0,10/13/2018,"I usually stay further uptown when visiting Manhattan but decided to give TriBeCa a try. While I love the area, this hotel didn't measure up. Firstly, when I opened the door to my room, the stale air almost made me turn around and leave. It smelled like fresh hadn't reached this room in quite a while. Since I got in after midnight, finding another hotel was not an option so I decided to just make the best of it. I first checked the bed. The box spring had no cover on it and was a yellowed version of what used to be white. The mattress had only a thin cotton sheet which was very wrinkled. I slept on top of the covers with my clothing still on and left the next day. In the bathroom, the tissue box seemed to have old tissues stuffed back inside of it. There are so many nicer boutique hotels close by. Do yourself a favor and stay in one of them.",,,
2,Brad G.,"New Carlisle, OH",4,6,3,5.0,7/12/2018,"This is truly a great place to stay if you want to be close to Manhattan but not pay the high price. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and perfect for a good night's sleep. This is also a great hotel if you want to drive into Manhattan and stay since it's very accessible at the exit/entrance of the Holland tunnel which means there's not much traffic to deal with. The valet price was very reasonable and you have easy access to the subway since there's a entry point right next to the hotel. This is definitely our go to hotel now when visiting NYC. One side note: if you're a movie buff, the photo below was taken nearby with just a five minute walk from the hotel.",,,
3,Bill H.,"Naples, FL",43,486,61,4.0,6/7/2018,We stayed for four nights and had a wonderful time.  Service is excellent and helpful.  My room was large and clean.  Great location with nearby metro stations and lots of great restaurants within walking distance.,3,,1
4,Antoinette L.,"Brooklyn, NY",68,123,360,4.0,1/4/2017,"We stayed here New Year's Eve. Very happy with our room.When we arrived the room was tidy, and the décor/furniture was up-to-date. We stayed on the fourth floor, so there wasn't to much of a view. We mostly traveled by Uber and subway to get to the attractions, not too far. We were also able to see the ball drop in time after arriving in the evening. We got back at about 6 in the morning and the staff took one look at us after requesting a late check out and allowed us another complimentary hour to accommodate our needs. They were super friendly and willing to hold our bags before we checked out. Bed was a bit firm but that's a preference thing....and we passed on the $16.95 breakfast per person. There are heaps of delicious food spots to hit up in NY!Would definitely stay again.",5,2,3
5,Massimo M.,"San Francisco, CA",1028,304,200,4.0,6/30/2017,"I have stayed here 5 times over the past 6 weeks, and I will keep returning.First, I love the location; TriBeCa is a great neighborhood, with the Freedom Tower just a 10-minute walk to the south, SOHO just to the North, and plenty of great restaurants and bars nearby.  There is a good Italian restaurant (Pepolino) and a great dive whiskey bar (Nancy's Whiskey Pub - see my review) right across the street.  Three blocks to the left, you have the Hudson River Park, with a running and biking trail right along the Hudson River, with a nice view of Jersey and Hoboken, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island to the Southwest.The hotel is nice looking, with 6 floors, so not huge and clean. In fact, if it weren't for the Hilton logo, it could be a boutique style hotel.  The rooms are spacious for NYC, and service is friendly. They have coffee in the morning and a cold water cooler throughout the day. Concierge is very very helpful and friendly, and a special shout out to the afternoon/evening concierge Lisbeth, who remembers my name and she's a catch!",8,1,3
6,Hal F.,"Washington, DC",10,186,28,2.0,6/30/2018,"I am shocked at the ratings given to this Hotel by Yelp users!  It really is a dump!  I stayed there, unfortunately, 6/18-20 for a conference. As a matter of fact, there were three of us who had the misfortune of staying there and we were all equally disappointed and dismayed. I am a Hilton Gold and always enjoy my stays at Hilton Properties even the modest ones, but this was really bad. The first room they gave me was 211 across from the elevator-tiny cramped, but the worst was the dirty bed spread. I wouldn't even sit down, called the front desk who apologized and sent me to 507. This was a large room by NYC standards, double beds, but the bathroom had one of those ancient jacuzzi tubs that was moldy, some of the towels were old, frayed and stained,!the coffee machine didn't work, the bed spread was pilling all over (old) and the mattress kept moving  so I had to adjust-I don't move a lot in my sleep so that didn't make any sense. Also, it was hot in nyc and the air conditioning worked ok at 67, but if you wanted to raise it to 70, it got really hot. Overall I am generous with two stars and that is because the front desk and maintenance guys were really nice. I will never stay there again, ever.",,,
7,Teri C.,"Simpsonville, SC",0,4,0,1.0,5/25/2018,"During our 3rd stay here last weekend, we experienced two security issues. We locked the room and left for 4.5 hours. When we returned, our door was ajar and held open by the deadbolt latch. It had not been serviced by housekeeping. When we immediately called the front desk, they had no explanation. Housekeeping said they had not entered our room, and the doorlock data showed inaccurate data that was not useful. We think it's important for our hotel rooms to stay locked when we are gone. Secondly, when we retrieved our bag from the lobby valet, it had someone else's bag attached to the handle. If we had not been honest and returned it, we easily could have left with an extra bag that was not ours. There was no verification of our name, number of bags or claim number by the valet attendant.  We can handle the slow elevators, noisy halls and bad pillows (as evidenced by previous stays), but these two security incidents will prevent us from returning.",4,1,
8,Gus S.,"Philadelphia, PA",163,330,695,3.0,5/23/2017,"We had a wedding in Tribeca so we got a room here. We paid over $300 for a room with a king-size bed. The receptionist was quite accommodating once we arrived. We got our key and headed to our room.  When I opened the door, the first thing I noticed was how small the room was. I guess that's NYC for ya. My fiancé immediately notice a weird odor, which smelled like a sandwich containing vinegar was sitting out all day.  The air was still, as if that the air conditioning was not working. There was also no water in the room, not even for purchase. We just got ready and headed to the wedding. It was one of those really hot days in NYC. When we got back from the wedding, the room was like a sauna. It was clear that the air conditioner was broken. We called the front desk. They sent a maintenance guy to our room. He confirmed the air conditioner unit was not working. Unfortunately, the only rooms were double beds, which was annoying. I will say that management was kind enough to give us a $40 discounted. Plus, they adjusted the room rate since it was a double. So, at least they were accommodating.  It was a still a huge headache moving rooms, and wasn't a great overall experience.",1,,
9,Melissa H.,"Corona, CA",1,27,15,5.0,1/19/2018,We came here on a business trip. Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca staff are incredible! We needed an early check in... i called as soon as the plane landed and they set it up for us. We were and will forever be grateful as we needed it for reasons unsaid! The room was very clean and quiet! The location is awesome and there is a subway station right outside the main entrance! The staff are all very welcoming and intentional! We will be back!,,,
10,Brendan F.,"Washington, DC",98,5,0,3.0,7/1/2018,"Pros: Awesome room size, super comfortable, friendly staff.  Check out was not til noon, so I could hang out in my room for a bit in the morning and watch some of the FifaWC game before leaving. Microwave and Mini-Fridge in room were clutch. Cons: Sheets/Blankets were not right size for my bed, and when I got in bed and pulled the covers up, the blanket and top sheet couldn't be maneuvered to cover comfortably.  When I checked in, they told me about breakfast the next morning, saying it was a continental breakfast. What they didn't say, was that there's a charge if you go in to the restaurant and eat it.  The restaurant couldn't run my card, and I had to charge to the room, after i'd eaten.  It would have been nice if at Check In they'd mentioned that the ""continental breakfast"" was not free. Instead, I had to pay $15 for a bowl of Cinammon Toast Crunch, a Banana, and a cup of coffee.  Keurig in room coffee machine brewed a first cup pretty well, but when i tried to brew a second cup, it didn't heat the water before brewing, and it came out cold and gross.",,,
11,Justin Q.,"Central Manchester, CT",1,23,3,1.0,8/17/2017,"Stayed Sunday night, 8/13. Woke up and within 6 hours, these bites started showing up.  Contacted the GM via email, no response. Contacted Hilton Honors Guest Assistance, they opened a case and connected me to the front office manager. Promised a call back within 2 hrs. Never called. Meanwhile had to seek medical attention due to the reaction from the bed bug bites. Dr agreed, on the type of bites. The next day, the hotel closed case without contacting me at all.  Once again I had to call Hilton Honors Guest Assistance, who were awesome, and took care of the issue and then some. Avoid this hotel at all costs.  This all could have been avoided had the hotel had the common decency to call me back. They chose not too. Game on.",7,1,
12,Colleen H.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",265,1,0,5.0,9/17/2017,"What can I say about the Hilton Garden Inn TriBeCa? That it is an outstanding hotel establishment with kind staff, unbelievably comfortable beds, great views, and much more. Some friends and I were out for one of our girlfriends birthdays, we are from NJ and had not initially planned on spending the night. As our evening progressed it was clear we did not want to go through the headache of catching the train back home. I immediately went online and found a reasonably priced room at the Hilton Garden Inn TriBeCa. I said to the ladies ""we have to book this!"" and we did! I called the hotel to ensure we would be able to have a late check-in as we were out on the town and it didn't seem as though the fun would be winding down anytime soon (City that never sleeps am I right???!) and they were very accommodating and allowed a very late check-in! Upon our arrival I was beaming because of how great the location was! Right down the road from the Freedom Tower!!! The front desk attendant assisted us with our check-in and sent us right up to a corner room on the sixth floor (top floor) which housed two of the most COMFORTABLE and PLUSH double beds I have ever laid on. At this point we had no complaints other than the lack of robes, and yes, this was a very minor complaint. When we awoke the next morning I couldn't believe the view! An absolutely stunning little area. It was truly a great stay. We were able to then enjoy an ice brunch in the area after sleeping in a bit. So if you are asking me ""should I spend an evening at the Hilton Garden Inn TriBeCa?"" My answer will me 11/10 YES!! It was a phenomenal experience especially given how last minute the booking was.To conclude, will I be returning for another stay? I'm sure you can already infer that answer, but I'm going to tell you anyway...ABSOLUTELY!",1,,1
13,Daniel K.,"Manchester, CT",1,16,1,5.0,10/1/2017,"When picking hotels, I usually just look for clean rooms at a reasonable price. When the front desk staff is friendly and helpful, that's a bonus. The Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca was a bonus. Every staff member I interacted with, including several maintenance men in the elevator, was warm and friendly. That's not typical for a non luxury hotel in New York City. The hotel was happy to hold our bags, both when we arrived early and after we checked out. One employee offered (without our asking) recommendations for brunch as we were checking out. It wasn't a disingenuous plug for their onsite restaurant, but to another place in the neighborhood; he was just being nice. That's rare and impressive these days. Also, as a bonus, the location is wonderful when staying downtown. It's very easy to get to if entering the city down the West Side, or from New Jersey via the Holland Tunnel. And there is an entrance to the subway (A C E lines) right in front. Be aware: the signage is not that obvious. There is a blue sign somewhat flush with the building's facade, but we walked right by the front door when we first arrived.",1,,
14,Andy S.,"Saint Paul, MN",3,45,4,3.0,3/16/2018,"The hotel itself is nice, well kept and clean.  The location is great, right next to major subway hubs.  Management is a bit less fantastic.  My wife called a day before to add my name as a guest for the room she booked, and to inform them I was arriving early for a room key.  This was important because I was getting to NYC 9 hours before her.  When I arrived, they had no record of my name, only that my wife called to add a guest.  They insisted on talking to her on the phone before I could go to the room.  Luckily she was able to step out of business meetings to talk to the front desk (again)and allow me in.",,,
15,Gigi M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",159,18,1,1.0,12/26/2017,"Yesterday was Christmas Day, my building had a bad fire and I had to find another place to stay. I had a long day of travel and a friend with me who I hadn't seen in 20 years. It's late, we are hungry and exhausted and it's bitter cold. I come into the Hilton to have the woman at the front desk ignore us when she sees us outside at first. I asked her about getting the rate I saw online and she tells me I have to do it online and then tells me ""I'm closing my drawer! You have 15 minutes!"" In a rude tone of voice and then goes off into another room. I really didn't want to get in an argument with this woman in front of my friend so I let it go, but wow, her behavior was beyond. I'm frantically booking it online with my frozen fingers and accidentally booked the one in Midtown by mistake. This was my fault, I said nothing and just took a cab uptown without mentioning it because I couldn't deal with this awful woman.Maybe she was having the worst Christmas ever, but damn. You work at the front desk of a hotel, when people come in from the cold, late at night, some compassion would be nice. This is probably not the best job for you.",1,,

Stop What makes this a 5 star review was the front desk-man. I think his name was Dave or Darrel....maybe it was neither lol but he was awesome. He let us know the room was ready so we got to check in a little earlier than expected. Also, when we checked out he offered to hold our bags in case the next hotel wouldn't allow us to check in early. Stellar service from him, he made us feel right at home and welcome. We really enjoyed our stay here, and hope to be back again soon.",,,
17,Julie M.,"Los Angeles, CA",209,133,62,5.0,5/9/2017,Amazing location. Clean and nice staff. It was one of the few places in Manhattan where it was easy to find a room with two queen beds. The beds weren't that comfortable but the rooms had a bunch of nice down pillows so I just slept on top of a few of them and it created a comfy featherbed feeling. Having a fridge and microwave were perfect and the business center has a great view if you have to work. Great hotel worth saying at and I will come back. It was really nice having a subway station entrance just outside the front door in the middle of a cold winter day.,1,,
18,Sam T.,"San Jose, CA",48,31,10,5.0,10/3/2017,"The room and furniture will slowly be outdated as time passes and the elevators are a bit slow. What makes this place great is the exceptional customer service by all the managers on duty. Kevin, Michael, and Mark all have been very pleasant to work with. Due to a communication error on my stay extension, they were able to honor most of what was quoted for the rates. I'd back come back when I'm in town again. Thank you guys!",,,1
19,Nicole L.,"Sag Harbor, NY",0,20,1,5.0,9/24/2017,"Wow! Had an AMAZING stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca. Was in the city for the San Gennaro Feast and was in a crunch to find a room at the last minute, at about 11PM. After calling several hotels charging $300+ for a night, I was directed to this location having availability for only $199/night - kind of unheard of in the city and especially in the beautiful Tribeca area. Even more to my surprise, when we arrived, they upgraded us to the only Penthouse Suite at the hotel for no additional cost! It was absolutely gorgeous! GREAT views, the most comfortable king bed I've ever slept on, two massive LG flat screen Tv's, and the icing on the cake... Enormous jetted tub that I took full advantage of after a long day in the heat and scents of street food. I would reccomend this place a million times over and will definitely go back. Thank you Hilton!!!",,,1
20,Robin T.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,15,0,5.0,5/19/2018,"Traveled here to work at my headquarters across the street and had nothing but the best experience.  The staff here treated me like a princess, as if I were the only guest in their hotel.  Fabulous fabulous experience.",,,
21,Ann W.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,17,2,4.0,9/26/2017,"Stayed 5 nights. Small room, not unexpected for NYC. It was clean and passable in all the basics, with a convenient fridge in the room. The front desk is easy to deal with, and they will bill anything from the store, like water, to the room very quickly. Great location, by the ACE line, and TriBeCa, Soho, even East Village within walking distance. We did the breakfast package, and I have to give the highest marks to Roy and Robin for hospitality. They made us feel welcome every day. The breakfast is a buffet in the restaurant attached to the hotel, and they also make omelets to order in the kitchen. The breakfast was very good quality and the service exceptional. My expectations were exceeded - Its a modest hotel with a price that's modest for the city - for what it is, they do a great job. I would stay here again.",,,
22,Brenda C.,"West Hollywood, CA",23,365,69,3.0,6/20/2016,"Very basic hotel. It could really use some updates with fraying carpet at thresholds and scratchy (low quality) sheets. The coffeemaker/Keurig was also really dirty, so run water through it a few times before using it. The night manager, Larissa, always greeted me with a smile when I came into the hotel. I literally upped my rating of the hotel by one star due to her warmth and overall awesomeness. Location is great, especially if you need to use the Holland Tunnel at all. Plenty of places to walk to (try the bodega across the street for a delicious and inexpensive breakfast sandwich), just be careful of the homeless encampment a couple blocks north of the hotel. Fitness center (in the basement) was small, but modern. Sports bar inside the hotel was jamming the night of one of the basketball playoff games.",,,

Temperature was hard to fix as it gets either too cold or hot.Hotel room looks tired and needs revamp. Shower curtain is rusted, bed is sagging and room is not well lit even with all lamps on. For the price paid, thought it was not a great deal!  But we chose it for the location.",,,

There were lots of restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. We were close to Canal Street and Little Italy. We also walked to the Hudson River boardwalk. The hotel was clean and the staff were so friendly. The manager Stainley was very helpful and kind. There is a train station right outside of the hotel.,,,
25,Lisa M.,"Kingsland, GA",0,9,0,2.0,9/19/2017,"Let me start off by saying that I grew up in the area, so I am aware of what NYC entails. For a Hilton property, this place is completely unacceptable. There was no warm welcome upon arrival, and the man behind the counter both looked and spoke to us like we were bothering him. How dare we want to check into our room? While this may be normal NYC demeanor, this is not hospitality, nor what I expect from a Hilton.The room was small (a king room), and the lighting was terrible, making the already dark and drab decor look worse. The hallways and the room were extremely hot despite it being almost 90 degrees out. We turned our AC on, but the room never really got cool enough, and it droned on all night.The linens were dingy, and I could tell they were very old.  I had requested extra pillows when I made the reservation, and when we checked in, he did confirm that they were in my room. But, only 4 pillows on the bed. And even calling these pillows is a stretch. Almost no filling and they all went flat as soon as you put your head on them. The bed itself was old, and had terrible sagging throughout. The bathmat was not anti-slip, and I all but fell getting out of the tub, injuring an already bad back further. This was an ADA accessible room, meaning that the people that stay here most likely already have injuries/disabilities. For over $300 a night, this was a complete rip off. The only good thing about it was that it was within walking distance of our destination. I have stayed at hotels twice as nice for half the price. I've emailed the manager and gotten no reply. This should not hold the Hilton name.",,,
26,Lu C.,"Sag Harbor, NY",79,30,2,5.0,1/12/2017,"Clean place, perfect location.They offer a kindness you don't normally see in this city anymore.Kevin at the front desk made me fee like an honored guest At a white gloved establishment.  Accommodative, bright, funny and kind.",,,
27,Ashley C.,"Chicago, IL",11,511,111,4.0,11/14/2016,"We stayed here for a long weekend in New York City.  We picked it for location and price (although still pricey b/c it's NYC). It is close to the ABC line and not far from a few other stations so it made getting around pretty easy.  No frills but the place was pretty large for NYC, clean and reasonably well-kept.   After some other not-so-great experiences, I'll take that.",1,,
28,Janice R.,"Arroyo Grande, CA",10,19,2,5.0,7/20/2017,Loved this place except for being on probably the noisiest street in Manhattan. The hotel is newer and quite lovely. Great location even with the noise. The entire staff was beyond helpful. The people at the desk were consistently pleasant and knowledgeable. The concierge was great. Our housekeeping person was thorough. The room was spacious enough for 3 adults. I would recommend. Also I booked through the hotel and got a better price than Hotels.com or Booking.com,,,
29,Melissa S.,"New York, NY",1,37,38,3.0,8/8/2016,Okay hotel- rooms are a good size. However noise level is high!

It was a pretty standard room with a king size bed and all the typical amenities. There were a couple of big perks that made the stay wonderful. First, A bit shout out to Nairobi (I hope I got your name right!) who hooked me up at 10am by letting me check in and crash. Not only that, but she gave us a room on the 5th floor and no street noise was heard. She's an angel to the weary traveler. Second, the location is at Canal St station, making it easy to get around the city via subway. Third, the rooms were tidy, clean, and met all of our needs.",,,
31,Jessica O.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,12,0,1.0,1/1/2016,DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! They allow THEFT!I stayed here with friends for a show they were playing on NYE and left my bag to attend the show. My colleague had an earlier flight and told me it was ok to retrieve that bag before check out which is at noon since I had a key. I gave the hotel a call around 11:15 and they told me there was NO BAG.Hopefully you're just as confused as I am... A large tote bag...full of clothes... MISSING before check out. I go down to the hotel. Explain to the front desk. They look again. I didn't expect them to find it because by now the room was cleaned out. I asked for the manager. Joe Josue did not greet me he was extremely rude and refused to do a lock interrogation because I was not listed on the room however I stayed there. He refused to follow proper procedure he did not file a complaint and when I threatened to get the police involved (which I did) he was unmoved by the actions. When I called back to speak to a supervisor I was once again transferred to Joe who said there is no supervisor just a manager. BS! End result. I have NONE of the items I came to New York with for the remainder of my trip. Clothes seeing glasses makeup. Hair tools and a laptop!!!! I am disgusted by the way the hotel handled this situation and will be taking them to court !,11,,4
32,Lisa A.,"Boston, MA",86,218,255,1.0,12/16/2014,"My friends and I stayed here for a few nights and in terms of location, this place is great. Literally steps away from the ACE stop with easy access to pretty much everywhere.The room itself was decent. I've learned not to expect too much from hotel rooms in NYC. The room seemed pretty clean, but I noticed that the sheet on our bed was ripped. Also, the side of our tub was broken (might have just been cosmetic...we didn't actually try to use it). The second day, the housekeeper popped in and asked when we wanted service, we asked her to return in about an hour. When we got back six hours later, it was very obvious that our room wasn't serviced.The staff, for the most part, was great. Nice, efficient, and helpful. Now, you might be thinking, ""Then why just one star and not three or four?"" Here's why. The valet attendant. Yeah, you read that correctly. The valet attendant is honestly the reason I am not giving this property 3 or 4 stars. Let me explain: I needed to head to JFK. Simple, right? One of the employees at the desk asked the valet attendant to help me hail a cab. He stepped outside and said he could order me a cab, but it would take 15 mins. He told me that cabs tend of avoid their street after a certain hour because it becomes a bus route (or something like that). I should have known from the start that there was something funny going on considering the large volume of cabs driving by. He said he would go inside to grab his phone ""just in case"" ...within the five minutes he was inside, I saw a bunch of cabs drive by. When he returned, he said he ordered me a taxi and it would be here in 15 mins. Okay...? I didn't ask you to do that, but whatever.Next thing I know, he said my car was outside and that the woman was just going to grab some coffee. When I walked outside, there was a jeep-looking car waiting. Totally unmarked, no service name on the side...nothing. Um...?So, I asked the valet attendant how much it would be since this obviously wasn't a taxi. He quoted me something like $62 or $66. Whatever it was, it was not the standard $52 flat rate that taxis charge. Looking through the trunk, I could see the car's interior and noticed there was no meter or license number anywhere in the car. So I said, ""This car doesn't have a meter or anything. I don't have cash so I have to pay on a card..."" He said, ""Oh, just a card? Well, see, a card is an extra $6 charge."" You have to be kidding me. I told him that was ridiculous. He took out cash from his pocket and said he'd cover the credit card charge. Whoa, sketchy much? I have no interest in getting into an unmarked car and paying more than what the flat rate should be.I was FURIOUS. He asked, ""So, what do you want to do?"" I told him that he was extremely misleading and that I wished he would have told me from the start that he didn't order me me a taxi, but that he was going to order me a private car or whatever.I told him that I was going to walk over to the next street and hail my own cab, which I did. The final price (with a generous tip) for my taxi ride was cheaper than what I would have paid had I accepted the ""private car.""",18,2,1

The noise was so disruptive I was woken up and not able to fall asleep until the truck left. I wanted to mention this when I checked out in the morning but there were 4 people ahead of me at the front desk, requiring more detailed and one person working the desk. I waited for a bit but to avoid being late to my morning meetings, I had to skip the discussion and express check out. When I was emailed asking for feedback, I submitted this information the same day. It has now been two weeks and I have not received any reply to my poor stay. I received a phone call today claiming to be from ""Hilton Honors"" to discuss promotional opportunities, when I started to express to the the man I wasn't interested he hung up on me. When I called Hilton Honors customer service line to discuss this and to follow up on my feedback from my stay, I was also hung up on in the middle of explaining the situation. As an HHonors member, this has left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't think I will stay with Hilton moving forward.",,,

This one is about average.  The room was nice and comfortable, complete with a Keurig.  The hotel was clean, albeit a bit aged.  Plus, keep in mind that it's New York-sized, so there's not a lot of space. There is hot breakfast in the onsite restaurant that you can get as part of your room. On the Sunday I was there, it was chaos in the eatery.  The host or hostess that was supposed to seat us were busy doing bussing tables, so we seated ourselves. We had to find our own silverware and coffee cups. They might've been understaffed that day because everything was much smoother on Monday.  The food selection was good and included eggs, bacon, waffles, pancakes, mini pastries, yogurt, fruit and a few other items. My primary complaint was where my room was. It was facing the alley across from the gym.  There were big trucks going in and out all night long.  Around 2 AM it sounded like someone was crushing glass bottles outside, so I didn't get much sleep. It was especially rough on the night before my 7 AM flight.",7,3,6

We reported it to the manager and he said they would have new sheets delivered, which they did. We were so appalled and honestly sick to our stomachs over what we'd seen in our needs, that we asked for a new room. He was gracious enough to move us and promised for sheets to be delivered within half an hour. They were busy and we didn't mind putting our own sheets on at this point. Three hours later, still no sheets. Our poor kids were up with us until about 2:30am, waiting for sheets,  where we finally had to go to sleep.

Or should I say ""elevator"" .. singular. Look at how many reviews mention the ONE working elevator. What could possibly be taking so long to repair? At one point during my stay, BOTH elevators were down (albeit briefly).Because of my odd hours during this business trip, I was unable to take advantage of the free breakfast. Since the room service comes from the attached restaurant, I never actually ordered delivery - I just went downstairs and got food to go. That's a whole other story. One word: Mediocre.The location is perfect for catching the subway. Location is close to several good restaurants and fast food spots. Staffers were very nice and accommodating. Especially Housekeeping who gets a special shout out for leaving me extra coffee pods when I asked (the standard supply is only ONE regular coffee pod. ONE. I scoff at your ONE coffee pod. Leave me TWO daily, minimum!)Water pressure in the shower was sketchy. Sometimes great. Sometimes weak. Sometimes both during one shower.

The room was moderate in size with a large bathroom and very nicely furnished.  It was extremely clean and well cared for.  Our only problem was with checkin.  I neglected to checkin to a room via the web in advance.  When we arrived, the desk clerk could not find my reservation.  He found another person with the same last name, but not mine.  Finally after a few anxious minutes, he was able to locate my reservation for 2 nights.  Great...  Then as he was issuing me my keycards, I asked about breakfast.  He indicated it was in the attached restaurant/bar and was $16.95 pp.  Hmmm, I had booked a room & breakfast package.  He couldn't find any record of that.  I pulled out my hardcopy (lesson to the wise - always bring a hardcopy) which indicated breakfast included.  He had to make a copy of my hardcopy, indicated he would do some further investigations, but issued us breakfast coupons.  I heard nothing more from the front desk so I presume that all was ok and he found the full reservation.  Breakfast was certainly not worth $16.95.  It was a moderate buffet spread set up on the restaurant bar.  It had the usual breakfast buffet faire: cereals, yogurt, fruit, juices, waffle machine, pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, assorted bread, and some pastries.  You won't starve but it certainly wasn't a $16.95 buffet.  On the second morning we noticed a sign that indicated that one could order omelets and other items but our wait staff never mentioned this to us.  They did ""mention"" that the breakfast coupon only covered the price of the meal but *NOT* the tip.  Yeah, its NYC....",,,

On the flipside, though, they had a ""vanity kit"" - that included a bandage which was real thoughtful of them, considering the guest probably just spent a ton of time traveling.Really helpful baggage dude too - no wait at all, unlike like at the Roosevelt where I spent the following night.So yeah, overall nice little place.

Quiet at night. Contemporary lobby with cookies in the afternoon and infused water all day. The room was normal sized for a NYC hotel in that you couldn't open the door to the room and the bathroom door at the same time, but it was clean, the beds were adjustable in their firmness, and they had free wi-fi.

48,Dana L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,12,0,3.0,9/3/2015,So before I moved to bk I used to come to NY alot and I ended up staying at a number of hotels over a year. This is a hotel that I stayed in more than once and each time it was something that made the experience not 5 stars. I was in a room once that had a view of the brick building next door for example. I just thought is was customary to make up for it in service or room size or something! Another time I was in a room and there were cigarette burns and holes on the bed and sheets. I'll say that the hotel itself is not bad and the people working there were very very nice though which is why I give them 3 stars,2,,2
49,Neal E.,"Haymarket, VA",1209,4552,31449,4.0,2/21/2010,"As others have noted - a fairly new Hilton Garden Inn!Beware! The address used to be:6 York StreetThe address for the hotel is now:39 Avenue of the Americas39 Avenue of the Americas can also be referred to as 39 6th Avenue.A further warning - all three cab drivers I had - had absolutely no clue where the hotel was. I gave them both addresses - they still did not know where the hotel was. I called the hotel front desk and had the hotel staff talk directly to the cab driver - and yet they still could not get to the hotel. Probably says more about the cab drivers than anything - but still. In each instance the cab driver insisted on heading to 39th Street - even after I told them NO!  I had to show the cab driver the location of the hotel using the Maps app on my iPhone.Once you arrive though, it's a comfortable hotel. I was lucky enough to score the Penthouse during my recent visit due to my status with Hilton.  I know, the term ""Penthouse"" evokes ritziness - but this was probably small as Penthouses go - there were two rooms - the bedroom and a separate small living room with couch, flat panel HD TV, coffee table, lamps, small fridge, coffeemaker, and microwave.The bedroom also had a flat panel HD TV mounted in the wall.Bathroom was clean and roomy. Free Wifi internet in the hotel.There is also the standard pantry down by the front desk for bottled water, sodas, snacks, toiletries, etc.A restaurant is attached to the hotel - Bar Artisanal - a French Bistro of sorts.Staff was friendly and helpful.

The rooms are very basic but they seemed clean. The front desk staff is in a hurry at all times so you really have to force them to focus in if you have some sort of special request or need. The restaurant in the lounge is decent as well. This particular Hilton seems like a much lower end hotel than what you will usually find at a Hilton, but the location is great so if you are not someone who likes to spend time at your hotel and just want to see the city then you will find it practical.",3,,

You can't get closer to the subway-the entrance to the A, C, and E is right outside the door. Free wifi is a huge plus and we got a pretty good price for our room as well. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the bed and pillows weren't the best. I slept great but it was a little firm for my tastes.

That said you drop it in Tribeca and it becomes one of my favorite hotels in NYC especially for the price. It also one of the best hotel staff's I've ever encountered. They went way out of their way to helpful and took care of anything you could possibly need.You can not beat the location as its easy to get to from almost anywhere in the city with multiple subway lines right out in front.

59,Chris T.,"Missouri City, TX",16,122,30,3.0,5/20/2014,"The Good: This hotel has a great location at 6th/Canal. The entrance to the Subway is literally a few steps from the front door of the hotel which was the most important factor. Extremely convenient! NY hotel rooms are notoriously smalll however the double room here was a nice size by NY standards. Enough room for 3 ladies but it did get crowded quick with all of our luggage since there is no place to really store the luggage.This hotel was very clean and each room has a microwave and fridge. This saved us $ as we were able to pick up groceries/snacks from Whole foods on the first day and store in the fridge. They also offer free tea/coffee in the lobby at all times. We were able to snag an Awesome deal on the hotel website for under $200 a night during a busy weekend when other hotels were $300+/night.FREE Wi-fi at this property & a Keurig in every room.The Bad: This Hilton has ""average"" service. We had to ask SEVERAL times for extra towels during our stay. You also have to be specific as to how many and which size towels you are requesting. First night we asked for ""More towels"". We were delivered ""2"" Big towels. Next night i stopped at the front desk and asked for extra face towels. We were delivered exactly ""2"" face towels. Next day we left a note for housekeeping to leave ""3"" extra face towels in the room. They left 3 extra face towels but still only 2 big towels.. We learned that we had to leave a note and be very specific.The thermostat was weird in that we were either freezing or Hot we were never able to get it right. At 74 or lower we froze. At 75 or higher the heat came on.I read YELP reviews that the elevators were slow and guess what... they are slow. The issue is that there are two elevators but only ONE elevator is in service. This led to long wait times at the elevator. Its a small hotel but even still an add'l elevator is needed. Luckily were were placed on the 2nd floor so we had an option to take the stairs if we were in a rush. We often took the stairs coming down but it was a trek going up since the 2nd floor was actually 4 flights up.Overall: I would stay here again because the location, amenities, and price can't be beat! However, I would sincerely hope that they get both elevators working.",4,,

This hotel is my new go-to place. .I've had spotty luck with boutique properties in NY-- with NO customer service, so I have always been a Hilton fan and this property is a step above. The front desk employees are so helpful and friendly and enthusiastic, not robotic like many front desk experiences. The GM Steven blew me away when he emailed me personally to welcome me to the hotel and offer his assistance. I have never had that level of personal touch before. The rooms are very spacious for NY-- bathrooms have a lot of room- each room has a fridge and microwave and Kuerig -- total bonus. And of course it's NYC so there are a bajillion places to order for delivery. There is a great restaurant in the hotel on the first floor-- with a great patio seating area.....burgers, breakfast, you get it.

These umbrellas are free of charge...and they work. They're big enough to provide shelter for two guests and come without stipulations other than you must return them.If your travel plans don't have you leaving the City until later, you can delay your checkout time no questions asked. After checking out, you can even have the conceriage guard your luggage...including any bagged pastries you may have picked up on your morning walk. Oh...and there is always complimentary coffee and hot tea...and fresh baked cookies debut at around 5:00 every afternoon leaving the lobby smelling sweetly like grandma's house.5 Stars just for the service. All the other stuff was fine - rooms were clean, bathrooms were well stocked (in addition to the usual toiletries, the hotel provided mouthwash), beds were plush.

I am hh gold so we got free breakfast and it was good. Basic variety of food with excellent service all 3 morning we were there. The last day however proved why Hilton is my brand and why service is everything. One of my traveling party got food poisoning from something he got off the street. He called down to the desk after hours of ""having food poisoning"" was literally shaking... He asked for something to be brought up and the front desk person ran up a free Gatorade. Who does that?  Hilton people that's who. Also my person was so sick they had to book a later flight and joe at the desk was able to find a room for them to crash in to a much later than normal checkout.

Staff is very friendly and lobby/hallways looks great. Fitness center is also in excellent shape. If you're looking to stay in this area, definitely recommend this place as it is right above the A, C and E lines and is not too expensive for a nice Manhattan hotel in a great location.Only downside is the elevators are slow, but there are only 6 floors so does not take too long.",,,

Updated review","Yes!  This place has been just right for one week so far.  There is no way to make everyone happy, but I have been, very, every day during my NYC stay for a conference at NY Law School.  I've had great service,  I love the location, and the air conditioning has been vital with 100+ temps.  High recommend if you want a boutique, simply everything you need and nothing more hotel in Manhattan.",,,

This is the first time I stayed out of the TS area and the rooms were super clean and spacious compared to other rooms I have previously stayed in. The staff was very nice and always greeted us when we returned to hotel. And to make things better, the rates are very reasonable for NYC! I'll stay here again the next time I'm in NY.

Yes, my room faced the street. But, I was fine and slept through mostly everything, even though I can be a light sleeper. Staff during the desk is very nice. Staff at night not quite as much. Maybe cuz they have to deal with intoxicated people. I would say go to Distilled nearby for a great brunch, instead of Square Diner, if you want to spend a little more.

I stayed in one of the double queen bed rooms, and while available floor space maybe a little tight with the 2 large beds in place, its still much better than some of the closets of rooms I've stayed in cheaper NY hotels in the past.  The bedding is new and plush and you get basic hotel cable on wall mounted plasma flat screen TVs which is a nice touch and should be standard these days.  Free wifi is included which is amazing for a hotel of this quality in the city, and it's reasonably fast as well.  For the price I normally rate a decent hotel like this at 3 stars, but the fact a place like this exists in SoHo and is reasonably priced earns it another star.  Word of warning tho, as mentioned by other reviewers, but cab drivers seem really confused when you tell them the street address.  39 Ave of the Americas draws a lot of blank stares so I've had to tell them now 'intersection of W Broadway & 6th street south of Canal'  and that seems to register.",1,1,

Updated review","I went back for Passover, which was well over l4 months after my first visit in 2012 and I am happy to report I am even more pleased with this hotel.The atmosphere is absolutely fabulous;you have a wide range of various'types' of interesting but not snobby guests, many of whom I wish I couldhave gotten to know.  Alas, it IS a hotel-and I'm sure fraternizing....theroom with the physical fitness equipment is small: the days when i was aloneand could tune in to my favorite SPORTS talk shows, I got some great workouts.But it turns out other people like to work out as well (!) in the morning and thespace IS small-compact but not suitable tor really indulging in favorite televisonor rolling around on the floor.  This is not really a complaint-its an observation.There is an Italian restaurant adjacent which is popular in the evening, butyou don't hear the noise.  The breakfasts are plentiful and the dining area givesa good view of Tribeca folk rushing off to work.  Very interesting view.I am particularly fond of Mr. James Ruiz, who is a Manager-and seems to'get' me-in a way that many New Yorkers do not-ie. when i would emerge with one of my most unusual hats, he did not STARE at me as if I were some creature fromthe black lagoon.  There is also a baggage man  whose name i did not get, who wasa large male  always had a smile for me.  I think others have found him to besuperior as well.   The entire staff is certainlyup to snuff-when I made a mistake in my reservation, they were able to accommodateme without any fuss.I really think of this as my home away from home. Next time I hope to find outif you can use one of the swimming pools some of the other properties feature.The location is not only CENTRAL, but there is an actual SUBWAY where themain entrance is merely a few feet away from the hotel.  Who could askfor anything more (Direct connections to uptown, downtown AND JFK, forthose of us who like to use public transportation.",,,
88,Lumen T.,"Marina del Rey, CA",149,53,1,3.0,2/27/2010,"Great location for a hotel. I stayed here for work and the proximity from this hotel to Soho is great. There's a metro close by, but it's easy to hail a cab or walk to Nolita, Chinatown, or Soho. The rooms are good sized for a NYC hotel. Free wireless, which is a must for me. You can buy water, ice cream, toothbrushes in a little area off to the side of the front desk. Had a bit of trouble finding it initially, but if you tell the cab driver 6th Avenue & Canal, they'll get you close to it.",2,,
89,Amanda Z.,"Chicago, IL",325,803,6,5.0,6/23/2009,"My tips for enjoying this lovely, new hotel in TriBeCa:(1) When coming from Laguardia, make sure your cab driver knows that this hotel is on York STREET, not York Avenue, otherwise you'll get a long trip through Harlem on the way to the very wrong street.  Better yet, tell him to take you to 6th and Canal, cuz that's where you're headed.(2) New hotel = new fancy, adjustable beds.  Keep in mind that it might be on the hardest setting when you flop down, exhausted from travels...and avoid the whiplash that is sure to ensue.(3) Ask for an upgrade.  If gotten, you'll get a fabulous suite-type room with a mini-fridge and microwave.  Stock said mini-fridge with some beer from the little store across the street.  You'll be thirsty after sight-seeing all day.  (Oh, and the king-sized bed didn't hurt either.)This hotel is lovely.  Brand-spankin' new (no rehabs here, kids, they tore down a factory and built this one from scratch) and it shows.  Staff is very friendly and accommodating, there is a fitness center and a business center, and free internet in the rooms (if you bring your laptop.)Great location, right on the edge of TriBeCa and SoHo, and a subway stop right out front (A, C and E right at your fingertips.)And tip (4) Book on priceline.  Seriously.  You will thank me.I would definitely stay here again.",7,1,3
90,Nina N.,"Denver, CO",1,18,0,3.0,11/11/2011,"My family of 3 stayed here for a week.  The hotel is very standard certainly nothing luxurious about it.  The room is new York small which was to be expected but there were some short comings for sure.  For about $400 a night I would hope for no peeling wallpaper and a bathtub that an adult could actually bathe in.  The location is good as gar as subway access but tribeca is freeeay central so not all that pedestrian fruendly.  That being said it was safe, clean and the valet, Edwin, who is also like a conceriege was super helpful and friendly.  Overall fine, but will stay somewhere else next time.",2,,
91,Dennis L.,"Washington, DC",24,96,14,4.0,8/14/2009,"The short review: great location, good quality room, reasonable price.The long review:I booked this hotel for a weekend getaway. My criterion for hotels when staying in New York have evolved considerably over the years - probably the most important thing is location. As a visitor, you're most likely to be taking the subway or taxis (who the hell wants to drive themselves through NYC traffic - you should just pay an experienced professional for that). Obviously, you don't want to stay in a total dump, but you're probably going to spend more time out of your hotel room than in it, so it's less of a factor.In any case, the Hilton Garden Inn Tribeca is located within three or four blocks of most subway lines on Manhattan. In fact, the ACE stops right under the hotel, and there is a subway entrance directly in front of the building. The biggest drawback is that the street address (6 York St.) isn't familiar to most taxi or private car drivers, as York St. is only one block long in Manhattan. It's probably better to tell cabbies that the hotel is on 6th Ave., just south of Canal. In fact, the front door to the hotel is actually on 6th Ave. Those quirks aside, it's an easy commute or walk to most places you might want to be.The room itself is a pretty standard hotel room. They claim that both sides of the mattresses are adjustable firmness, but in practice turning the dials didn't seem to have any noticeable effect. That said, the bed was quite comfortable anyway. The hotel is brand new, and the room really reflected that - clean and well kept, digital thermostat, free wireless internet, flat screen LCD TV, minifridge, and microwave. The bathroom had Neutrogena care products, an adjustable spray shower head, and a hair dryer.The staff were very helpful, cheerful, and polite. The elevators were just about the slowest I've ever seen, though. There's a fitness center and a business center, but I didn't need the business center on my trip, and after roaming about the city all day I had no energy to also put in a workout, so I didn't actually see either of them. There is also a restaurant/bar adjoining the lobby of the hotel which I did not try.As to the cost, it was very reasonable for a mid-range hotel in a centrally located Manhattan neighborhood. All in all, a good experience.",3,,
92,Kristin Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,276,1,4.0,8/30/2009,"WOW! great location! friendly staff! great price! great size (considering it's NYC)! OH and even has a metro station right in front! (a train exit canal st/avenue of the americas)the garden inn is nestled on the edge of tribeca, making it only a hop, skip, and a jump away from: the village, soho, noho, nolita, little italy and the bargain bonanza of canal st! i would most definitely stay here again! the room was clean and it was super easy to catch a cab from in front of my hotel. the only issue i ran into was most of my driver's were a bit confused in getting me back to the hotel. the hotel actually sits on 6th ave at york. (even though the address is 6 york, it's actually a small alley/tiny side street ). i would have to tell them i was on ""6th ave just before canal st."". if i told them ""6 york"", there was lots of dialogue which was not always wanted in the wee hours of the morning after several martinis.overall.... a great bang for your buck!!",1,,
93,Robin W.,"San Antonio, TX",10,80,14,4.0,8/20/2009,"I loved staying here and would return any time. The room is kind of small by normal standards, but bigger than average by NY standards.  I loved the location-- close to Chinatown and Soho and the subway runs right underneath. If you like walking, it is a long but pleasant walk to midtown. Hmm what else. The beds and linens are awesome. You can adjust the softness by turning a knob located on the mattress under some velcro.  But be warned, it takes a while for the adjustment to go through; I was expecting to press the button, hear some robot noises and then the bed would be immediately adjusted, but that is not what happens. The toiletries provided are nice Neutrogena products that get the job done. The bathroom and everything else are completely new. The AC works great.  There's a coffee maker in the room, if you want. The only negative was the hotel parking was off-site and was outrageous ($40? a night). We parked in midtown and took the subway to the hotel and payed 18/night.  The other negative was the elevator was a little slow, but it makes cute little ""hawnk!!"" noises on every floor so I didn't mind.",1,,

Brooklyn is a couple of stops away, it's what parts of Manhattan used to be like before regular working folk got pushed out of Tribeca and elsewhere.

This hotel is located on the border of Tribeca, right next to Soho, Little Italy and Chinatown, making it quite convenient. The room was nothing special, but we weren't in the room except for to sleep, so I couldn't complain much. Note that if your room faces 6th Avenue, there is a LOUD club on the weekends that blares music. Having won the room, we didn't have to pay for our stay. I noticed when I signed in, however, that our room was over $400 a night. Would I pay that much for this hotel? Probably not. Would I stay here again? Yes, if the price is right. There's also a great Italian restaurant across the street, Pepolino, that's definitely worth checking out. Also note that this room is difficult for cab drivers to find. Every review says this!! York Street is but a small alley that NO cab driver knows of. You're better off saying 6th and Canal.",,,

I don't need a great deal of service and am a native New Yorker so know my way around so was disappointed when upon checkout I asked for help hailing a cab to our rental car pickup several blocks away. Normally I would have walked no problem but we had a bunch of luggage and it was 3-5 blocks. The staff member told me the cabbie would be upset that he was hailed for such a short fare (um, that's the cabbie's problem) but if I wanted him to hail a cab for us, he would. I hailed the cab myself. I wish I didn't use my Hilton points for this and had stayed at the other hotel we Hotwired a great rate for in Times Square.",,,

Everyday they would have fresh bake cookies waiting for us in the lobby! The hotel is very convenient and is walking distance from many restaurants and has a subway station right in front of it.,,,
