0,Jill M.,"Portland, OR",335,737,484,4.0,10/6/2018,"@Marriott Stayed here for four nights in Oct 2018. Below is a quick rundown of my experience. The good:- Great staff: Nice and accommodating. When I requested more towels and bottles of water through the Marriott app, I received them very quickly and got a follow up call to ensure I received them- Buffet breakfast: And not just continental breakfast--a full hot and cold food bar including eggs, meats, make your own waffles, fresh fruit, coffee, muffins and oatmeal. Color me impressed!- Modern decor in lobby and rooms- Pretty quiet--a bit off the beaten path (side street), so I was able to sleep fairly well- Strong wifi signal Areas for improvement:- Elevator: Slow as f*ck. Had I not been all the way up on the 13th floor (yes, they have a 13th floor!), I would have taken the stairs. Elevator area at main level is very small and cramped. Plus, the staff servicing rooms shares elevator with guests--there is no separate service elevator.- Closet was too small for my outfits for a 4 night stay- Shower door seal loose, caused shower to leak all over floor (reported to front desk and via post stay survey); no fun having to dry pool of water each morning- Shower head so high it made it feel like low flow/pressure- Spendy considering it's a FairfieldOverall though, would definitely stay here again!",3,2,2
1,Joyce R.,"Tulsa, OK",29,192,407,3.0,10/31/2018,"I agree with everything Jill M. said. Except we were 2 people w/ 4 days and events every night. Think about the clothes! Two additional things to note: lighting is poor & poor mirror situation because the full length mirror, thoughtfully, has ""hooks"" down one side which you'll probably need for clothes so then the view is obscured. I kept going to the tv, where a mirror should be. The window wall does get natural light into the room. But I do think they utilized every square inch as best as possible. The online hotel photos are honestly represented. The hotel is 2 years old with 2 very slow elevators. (One was worked on while we were there & hubby talked to a patron who said he'd been there a year ago, nothing's changed. Our ""welcome"" was punching 15, riding to 15 & wouldn't open. We've been trapped in that elevator and rode up/down three times! One evening while we waited for the ""good"" elevator, the other door opened to a mother/ daughter cowering in the corner. I said, ""I'm not getting in there"", & they quickly exited. They'd been riding up/down unable to get off and were truly scared.)We were on the 15th floor, 6 rooms per floor apparently. And, yes, per personnel, there's no utility elevator. All this sounds pretty negative. But it's not. Our check in was no less than delightful with our ""city view"" ready for early check in. Pretty check in girl smiled and waved at us the next day. The buffet breakfast is one of the best I've had in America. Probably the best scrambled eggs. Great rotation of items. And the servers were over the top, no kidding. The physicality is top notch (except for the wonky card only door to get to elevators): nice lobby, bar area, gym & breakfast room on lower level. Pretty landscaping and outdoor seating off the bar. Half price Happy Hour w/ awesome house wine. (However, the bar tender was MIA a couple times.)To be repetitive, the location is great and cabs are easy to catch. You, Fairfield, were on your way to excellence. Until, on our *2nd* day, we were on our way out late afternoon; I mentioned to the desk that we'd been in & out but now our room could be cleaned. She said there was no housekeeping on duty but they'd try to get us whatever we needed. I said it was okay. We'd be good til morning. Sunday was a full day for us. We made sure the ""do not disturb "" wasn't on the door. While we waited for elevator the maid was in the room down from us, door open, music loud, singing her heart out. Made us smile. Enjoyed a very busy day, returned to hotel and our room hadn't been touched. I called the desk. We decided to keep our dinner arrangements, so we stopped by the desk on our way out. He said they'd called housekeeping (hmmm, lady day before said there was no housekeeping at that time). We enjoyed our evening and the room had indeed finally been attended to -- bed made, used towels removed. There may even have been a couple clean towels added, but no washcloths!!!And to Sarah S., I guess we need an app to get water. We had none either. Another FYI: confession, I'm petite. The bed is set quite high. Thank god there was a desk chair in the room to put on shoes, pants, etc. The bed was just too darn high for me. Granted, not much room to pull out and sit on chair. . . Hubby said the desk guy was rude at check out. You don't get to check your bill before you leave if you use Expedia. Well, he didn't know but was bruskly told, ""You got a beef, you talk to them.""So why three stars? I bet you'd give less. It's for those that made our stay pleasant. There were plenty of nice, friendly people doing their jobs, happy to have you in their care. We'd most likely return, thanks to them. But I won't hold my breath over that elevator ever being fixed.",,,

3,Allison B.,"New Haven, CT",63,83,71,5.0,11/4/2018,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this hotel. We stayed for one night before embarking on a cruise. The price was reasonable as far as NYC prices. It included THE BEST breakfast I've had at a hotel, so paying a few bucks more for the night was worth it. The elevators are slow and sometimes there was a line, but we chatted with the fellow guests who many were running in the NYC marathon that weekend. We had a nightcap drink at the bar and the bartender was fantastic. She was friendly and accommodated my requests. Rooms are super tiny and I felt like the king bed wasn't a true king, but comfy nonetheless. Bathroom also tiny but fits the bill with the essentials. Clean and modern decor, felt homey.",,,
4,Ashly B.,"New York, NY",935,93,193,4.0,8/9/2018,"-First Impression- Low key location. Lovely entrance. -Food- Only tried the complimentary breakfast. Regular breakfast food: eggs, bagels, sausage, waffles, fruit, coffee, tea, etc.-Service- Every single staff member was friendly and attentive from the front desk, to people walking down the halls. Everyone said hello and smiled, asked if everything was ok and if I needed anything. -Price- I was trying to get the best price possible near a particular venue in the area. This hotel was a bit more expensive than a couple other hotels I was looking at, but the reviews here were waaayyy better. Worth it!-Did Not Like- AC was pretty loud in the room... Other than that, everything was great.-Noteworthy- Wake up early to avoid crowds at breakfast-Recommended?- Yes. I will definitely keep this hotel in mind for future reference.",12,6,14
5,DeeAnna O.,"Minneapolis, MN",38,2,0,5.0,11/3/2018,Excellent hotel.  Nice and clean.  Good breakfast.  Walking distance to times square but away from some of the craziness.  I would recommend!,,,
6,Maisha R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1939,1089,4838,3.0,8/20/2017,"This is a small hotel on the UWS that is a good place to stay at a relatively decent price. Small is the key word here, however. The lobby leads into a small bar area that has an awkward key entry door to the elevator bank, which is also tiny. Although the hotel only has a little over 200 rooms, the two elevators that served 18 floors were insufficient for the number of guests staying there. Several times we ended up taking the stairs due to a long wait.The basement housed the small gym which had a couple of treadmills and ellipticals, a seated bike, and a corner with free weights. Next to the gym was the breakfast area. Similar to other Fairfields, they offered complimentary breakfast. The rooms had comfortable beds, a desk, TV, and cozy bathrooms. They were perfect for the few hours each day that we occupied them while we were sleeping.Check-in and check-out was painless and quick. The staff was kind and gave us no problems when we called to let them know that we'd be returning late for our checkouts. Our only issue with the staff was with Marx G, who stored our bags, did not return them all, and had an attitude about the encounter. Management handled the situation well, however. Close to Columbus Circle, Hell's Kitchen, Lincoln Center, and Central Park, the Fairfield Inn and Suites is a good choice for visitors to the city who are aiming to tour Manhattan.",18,6,12
7,Joe N.,"Boynton Beach, FL",1,8,4,5.0,7/7/2018,"After a bad stay at another hotel in Brooklyn, my wife and 3 year old son decided to add a day to our trip and stay an extra night in the city. We are Marriott rewards members so we got a great rate, or so we thought. Upon checking in, the hotel General manager informed my wife that the rate for the night was in fact CHEAPER than what we had booked for! Amazing! She changed the rate for us and we saved some money. The rest of Front desk staff was extremely courteous and friendly. One fella made sure to let us know that if we parked across the street from the hotel that we would absolutely be ticketed and towed. Good looking out! He also was kind enough to help my wife take the luggage (my wife packs heavy) while I waited with the car (I always haul our luggage, I promise!) I wish I remember his name but it slips my mind. While the parking situation is not ideal there is discounted parking available through the hotel at the parking garage under the BMW dealership right around the corner. Keep in mind, there is a surcharge for SUV's and oversized vehicles, however that is the case with almost every parking garage in Manhattan.The hotels location is great in my opinion. You are close enough to Central Park and Times Square if you're not a lazy bum! ;) It is also close proximity to the MOMA, The Intrepid Museum and other attractions. For those driving or biking, you're close enough to the West Side Highway (NY9A) that you can get to Chelsea Piers quickly, or head downtown. I personally like staying on the West side of Manhattan most since I find travel to be a little less stressful than taking the FDR...anyway back to the hotel itself...The lobby was nice and clean. There is a small bar at the end of the lobby. The door that leads to the elevators is only accessed with a room key so safety is definitely in mind. There Is a really nice outdoor seating area with comfortable patio furniture and umbrellas, Great for avoiding the summer heat for a moment.Unfortunately for us one of the elevators was down so getting up to our room was a bit of a hassle.Now onto the room itself. The room was very nice for the price and while this is Manhattan the room was surprisingly not that small. Instead of carpet they had laminate floors which I really liked (you never know what kind of nastiness is hiding in the hotel carpet!)The bathroom was very clean modern and had ample storage space which my wife especially liked. There is also a big walk-in shower.our view wasn't all that great but it didn't matter since we were only staying a night. If we were staying much longer I would've liked to of had a better view of the city if possible.The room's decor was modern and functional.A large screen television with a decent amount of cable channels and availability for Netflix and other services was a really nice feature. I was able to put Netflix on for my son so he could watch his cartoons! The bed was comfortable however the pillows were not all that great. I unfortunately woke up with a stiff neck but that's on me.Due to the 2nd elevator being out of order, Upon leaving the hotel I had to load up our luggage cart and wait for an elevator that wasn't packed. One of the housekeeping staff took notice that I was waiting for a long time and took it upon herself to call the front desk for me to make sure that I was able to get the next elevator. Sure enough I did!The front desk staff was extremely polite and cheery as we checked out. I sure hope that the holiday inn in downtown Brooklyn takes note of how this hotel runs it staff because the customer service we received at this hotel was amazing! We will definitely be returning again!",2,1,1
8,Rose G.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,31,43,3.0,7/22/2018,Don't get fooled by the photos online. The room is extremely small. There is hardly any space around the bed to move around. There is no set of drawers to put your clothes in. Very basic tiny room with a bed. Bathroom has a very small sink. Smallest hotel room I've ever seen. Gave it 3 stars because it's clean and the people are very nice.I would rather spend a few more dollars for comfort.,1,,
9,Stan A.,"Aurora, CO",0,9,0,3.0,1/4/2018,"Decent hotel with great staff but several glaring issues.  Location is great for Lincoln Center and the Park.  The rooms are small but clean and modern.  Free breakfast was nice with huge selection for anyone.  Staff was great with what they have to work with.The property itself is updated but was plagued with mechanical issues and design flaws.  We originally reserved a room and requested 2 beds but this property must only have a few  (if any) 2 bed rooms (part of the design flaw).  We ended up with one bed which was not ideal and checked everyday twice a day if there was one open but one never did become available. We stayed in December after Christmas and our rooms heat failed 3 times.  The staff was nice and responsive and it appears to have been a wide spread issue during our stay.The hotel has too many rooms for its elevators to accommodate the demand.  In fact, most of our stay one of the elevators were down for repair.  We were on the 9th floor and used the stairs most of the time which helped with heating us up with the lack of heat in the room.Overall the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help but they were working with a lot of issues out of their control. Since I used points for this stay the front desk offered to refund me a portion of my points which I was happy that they offered but I have not seen my credit yet.  Overall nice hotel for couples who plan on having a decent breakfast explore the city all day enjoy dinner out to catch a show and return to the hotel to sleep and do it again the next day.  This is not for families or people who plan on sitting (on the bed since their is only one school type chair) and relaxing in their room.",2,,
10,Hannah S.,"New Haven, CT",2,17,4,5.0,6/13/2018,"I am so happy to have stayed in the Fairfield Inn & Suites!  The location was good-just a 10 minute walk from Central Park and the Columbus Circle subway station.  Our room was clean and cozy, and the complimentary breakfast selection was huge.  Most of all though, the staff was incredible!  From the moment we checked in to our final trip to pick up our bags, everyone was extremely welcoming and helpful.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay in NYC.",1,,
11,Edster W.,"Weymouth, MA",3,313,216,4.0,4/25/2018,"Last spring, my friends and I stayed here during Memorial Day weekend. It was a brand new hotel in Midtown West and about 3 blocks from Columbus Circle. Check in was quick. I reserved two rooms and both rooms were on the same floor. I got a king sized bedroom and the everything inside the room looked brand new. The room was very clean. Breakfast was served in the basement of the hotel. The only thing I didn't like was that the queue for breakfast was really long and there are just not enough tables. Other than that, this is a nice hidden gem in the city.",2,,
12,Jose C.,"Boston, MA",3,46,0,4.0,5/16/2018,"Brand new, immaculate, in an odd block, but very convenient to the Hudson River Park as well as Central Park. I had an inside room on a low floor, the 4th, and my view was an office building 20 feet away, BUT the room was stylish, small but immaculate and just what I needed. Everything was shiny and new, fresh and clean, and well worth what I paid. There is a sunken patio area out front that is a nice escape. I chose it for the online budget price, but I would stay again on a higher floor with a view. Melissa checked me in early and was super friendly and accommodating, which set the tone.",1,,
13,Ruth C.,"Littleton, CO",98,681,424,3.0,4/13/2017,"Really small room with too small elevators for the number of rooms there. Was on the top floor but it wasn't very impressive. Room I got was so small I felt like I was in a closet. Perhaps that is the New York City experience. Didn't like it at all. What a bummer since I don't frequent the city often and was hoping for that wow stay.Waiting for the elevator from the lobby is ridiculously small in addition to taking way too long for way too small elevators.  If you wait so long for it to arrive, more people wanting to use it shoving in such a small space just isn't right.",2,,
14,Amye K.,"Knoxville, TN",7,121,193,3.0,9/29/2017,"Kinda torn on the review on this one.  Most of the staff was helpful with a notable exception I will explain below.  Property is ok by Fairfield Inn standards, rooms are small per usual in NYC.  Location is alright, but it's probably half a mile to the park and Columbus Circle.  If you choose the property for its location, make sure you look at a map first to see that it's what you're expecting. Stayed here recently for two nights.  First night, we were given a room with air conditioning that was loud (both constant noise and an intermittent but frequent mechanical clanging sound) and didn't work properly.  The noise kept us up all night, and the room was never properly cool.  The room also smelled funky, which I suspect was also attributable to the a/c unit.  Asked the next morning for an engineer to come work on it.  After I was out for an appointment, they called and wanted me to return to the hotel ASAP to pack so they could move me to another room. They said they had determined they couldn't fix the a/c by that evening and wanted to give me another room.  Seemed odd I had to return ASAP, so I inquired further. Turns out they were fully booked that night and would give me another room and just pawn off the room with the broken a/c on another guest.  They wanted me there ASAP so they could flip the room. They did move me to another room when I was eventually able to return later in the day, but their just-give-someone-else-the-crappy-room plan is super shady!  I feel bad for the person who got that room......",2,,
15,Jessica C.,"Redington Beach, FL",142,17,12,4.0,7/8/2018,Extremely attentive employees and clean hotel rooms. My only issue was that our AC went out every single day that we were there but someone always came right away to fix it. I can't express how friendly and hospitable the staff was.. would definitely stay here again if I am ever in NYC again!,1,,
16,Ang L.,"Honolulu, HI",77,261,1160,4.0,4/30/2017,"The location of this hotel is a little far from the mainline that runs from the airport we had to walk a good 18 minutes or so to get to the hotel . Whenever we were tired we would just get an uber or the newer gett. There is a closer train station but u would had to transfer from the mainline to get to another line which we didn't want to do . But other than that the hotel was great very clean and new and nice . Staff was great , very friendly ! Most of things we wanted to do was 20 minute walk , it's close to Times Square but not that close. Still half mile from everything . This hotel is 10 blocks or so above Hell's Kitchen and to the upper west side .we chose it becuse it was the best priced hotel at the time. But if there were other hotels near the Hell's Kitchen area like 42 or so definitely book that hotel instead . Downside is they're usually much more expensive we were able to book this hotel for 200 a night and to me that was the best deal compared to all the other hotels I looked at (350 a night $$$) way too much since we weren't going to be in the hotel anyways . Size of the hotel , yes it is small . I would compare it to Japan size hotels . But to me it was fine . FREE breakfast ! Another reason I love the Marriott chains like this and residence inn s , I mean it's nothing fancy but got all ur basics and will save u atleast $5 on fruits and drinks !",,,
17,Linda R.,"Northwest Raleigh, Raleigh, NC",11,2,0,4.0,12/9/2017,PROS: Rooms are sufficiently sized and clean. Staff is very friendly. Breakfast was expansive. Happy hour drinks were high-end. Location was perfect for our needs. CONS: I wish the breakfast hours were longer. We were on vacation and wanted to sleep-in. Elevators were really slow. I felt bad for the housekeepers - they gave up their spots on the elevator for guests. I'm not sure how they ever got their work done (but they did because our room was always clean).,3,,
18,Jess R.,"Baltimore, MD",191,136,159,4.0,3/26/2017,"Selecting a Marriott in the city leaves a person with endless choices. Since we were planning our trip around spending a day at the Museum of Natural History, this location worked out wonderfully. Now, about all things hotel:Location can be everything. In the case of the Fairfield Inn, it's very quiet which was nice. It's off of the Main Street.The staff were exceptional. From the moment we arrived, to the moment we left... everyone was pleasant and helpful. Front-desk staff were polite and happy to give recommendations. I called down for extra towels and received a call confirming they had arrived. Parking is in the garage one building over and it's self service. Remember to have your parking ticket stamped by he front desk before you go to pickup your car. You pay at the garage, not the hotel. Parking is a great deal for the hotel, $40. There is also on-street parking. The hotel was very clean. We were on a higher floor (17) and the rooms lose space when on the higher floors. I would have opted for a lower floor and larger room over a view. There's plenty within walking distance (Central Park, Columbus Circle) We went out and finding a cab was easy.The reason I did not give five stars is because I would have preferred the larger room over smaller room with view upgrade. If I had been asked, I would have given five stars.",,,
19,Justin A.,"San Diego, CA",97,1029,141,4.0,2/26/2017,"Fairfield Inn and Suites may be the cheapest full service hotel in Manhattan. The rate, booked directly through Marriott, was only $100 bucks / night. Complete steal!Yes, the rooms are small. Yes, the showers are small. You get what you pay for though. If you want a bigger room, go spend 2x or 3x the money. I like luxury hotels, but I'm never inside the room when in New York, so its not worth the cost to me. As long as you can deal with a smaller room, I recommend Fairfield.",,,1
20,Aleksandra S.,"North Mountain Village, Phoenix, AZ",0,3,0,5.0,7/9/2017,"Daniel at the front desk was one of the highlights of this entire hotel, he was funny, helpful, kind, welcoming (I could keep going on forever). Guillermo was also fantastic, he seemed to genuinely care how our day was and how the breakfast itself was. The staff is excellent. The rooms were on the smaller side and the elevators kinda sucked. But you shouldn't be spending a majority of time in your room anyways! I would absolutely recommend staying here. I've stayed in New York multiple times and this staff takes the cake and makes the entire experience.",1,,
21,Ashley K.,"Washington, DC",105,254,13,4.0,8/9/2017,"I've got to say that I was VERY pleasantly surprised with my one night stay at this Fairfield.  Rooms in NYC are usually the size of a shoebox and not the room was giant, but it was a decent size and the bathroom was great as well.  Everything was very clean and modern. The bed was really comfortable as well.  One pretty cool thing in the room is that you can cast your Netflix to the TV - which I thought was a really nice feature, especially while traveling. The elevator does take a really long time, so if you are ever in a rush, definitely bake that into your schedule.  The free breakfast in the morning was a really good spread as well.  For free - it was beyond my expectations.  And, the space was huge, so you will always be able to find a place to sit.  If you need a nice, clean, affordable place to stay while in the city - I highly recommend this particular Fairfield.",,,

We had tickets for Springsteen on Broadway, so something somewhat close to theater district was preferable. We also wanted to explore some of the city, so it was important to be close to a subway station. We were a mile from the show, and a few blocks from the subway. It worked out great. More importantly, the people at the Fairfield were top notch. We were greeted at the front desk every time we walked past. They gave us great restaurant recommendations that were within walking distance of the hotel.

Then I had to go down to the car to get dry clothes and come back up and get dressed. That caused me to be pretty far back in the line for the Today show and I was disappointed about that, because I couldn't get a good spot in front! Plus, the maintenance people this far asks me what I want him to do about the flood nearly an hour and a half after it occurred and after I reported it.

33,Janay M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,5,4.0,7/12/2017,"Stayed here the weekend of July 1st to celebrate my mom's bachelorette party. The week before our stay i called and spoke to a receptionist and informed her that i was bringing some cupcakes and was wondering if they can store them for me in a refrigerator inside of their kitchen. The receptionist informed me that they could not do that that the most they can do for me is place the cupcakes in one of the refrigerators inside their cafeteria that's open to the public and that they are not responsible for them. I immediately asked to speak to a manager! Tracy the hotel's GM came on the phone & I explained to her the exact same thing i told the receptionist and let me just say Tracy has amazing customer service which explains why she is the GM. Tracy excused her receptionist and told me they would be happy to store them in their personal kitchen, she even went as far as to inform the Kitchen manager Lloyd to expect my arrival.    Upon our arrival we were greeted by the most energetic, super sweet, & funny receptionist Senia Pen'a. She was really nice from the beginning and went above & beyond to make us feel comfortable. Senia walked us to the elevators showing us the hotel amenities along the way & made sure to let us know that if we needed any help at all she was there. Exceptional customer service! Our room was very small but clean and modern. Everyday the room was cleaned. There are no ice machines on the floors,but if you ask the front desk they automatically send a staff member to your room with a large bucket of ice. & get this they even call you 5 minutes after to make sure you received the bucket of ie. How awesome is that?!!! The staff at this hotel are just amazing, i would stay here without any doubt in my mind that it will be a great stay!!!P.S.The free breakfast was pretty good!",,,

The staff that works for the owners of the parking garage are terrible and rude. Beware they will try and change prices from day to day. Overall the hotel is quiet, clean and the staff at check in was very helpful.",1,,

My 96-year-old mother needed to stay here for a few days during a recent move out of her NYC apartment. The staff treated her with so much kindness and consideration that she actually enjoyed what could have been a very difficult transition. Special call-outs to Delilah, Robert, and Senna, who went above and beyond to accommodate my mother's needs.",1,,

I've had to call the hotel, call Marriott and call orbitz to finally figure the situation out. Long story short be careful. This is a new hotel and they obviously don't know how to run it yet.",,,

38,Sonya B.,"Hamden, CT",0,5,0,5.0,10/22/2016,"Amazing experience here! As we all know, NYC hotels are mighty busy...but this one sure accommodates! Immaculate facility and fantastic staff/service. When we checked in, we found that a the room we had booked for 4 people had been mistakenly been rented out. Reshmi at the front desk reserved us 2 rooms right next to each other instead at no charge to us. Reshmi was also able to accommodate my ridiculously early flight out of JFK with a taxi waiting right outside the door. Highly recommend!! Will be staying here again.",1,,1
