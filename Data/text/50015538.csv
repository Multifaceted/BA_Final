0,Mary O.,"Rivergrove, OR",2,137,3,5.0,5/27/2018,"Fabulous presentation of Tom Stoppard's ""Travesties.""  Tom Hollander is superb as Henry Carr. And the whole cast shines. The physicality is played well for laughs and well done. The theatre has been beautifully restored and is more comfortable than many.",,,
1,Brian L.,"Edison, NJ",163,267,1894,4.0,2/16/2018,"Formerly the Selwyn Theatre, the American Airlines Theatre is Roundabout Theatre Company's flagship theatre for productions of dramatic works, and is one of the more pleasant venues in Manhattan's Theatre District.The neo-renaissance decor, which features wall murals and a chandelier hanging from a brightly painted recessed dome in the ceiling, combined with several large common spaces make this 740-seat theatre considerably roomier and less stuffy than some of the neighboring theatres.Patrons can expect to go through the standard flashlight bag check and ticket scan before proceeding onward. Since the show I attended had a pre-show discussion 30 minutes prior to curtain, I was able to roam around quite a bit before getting to my seat.  The theatre staff was surprisingly cordial, and I only encountered one mildly grouchy usher.For John Lithgow's Stories by Heart, my stage right orchestra seat in row L provided a full view of the stage, which was only minimally furnished with three chairs and two tables.For Time and the Conways, my seat (C107) in the upper mezzanine also offered an unobstructed view of the stage, and had sufficient pitch and legroom (I only bumped elbows once with the person sitting next to me).  One very useful feature in the mezzanine was the metal handrails in the front of each row, which helped people find their balance as they squeezed past to get to their seats (since the only aisles are on the sides). There's also a sizable empty space behind the mezzanine section in which you can snack, stretch, and hang out during intermission. Each level has at least one restroom for each gender, but if you're a woman you have your work cut out for you no matter what floor you're on or when you need to pee. You'll be more likely to preempt the intermission crowds if you (1) can powerwalk like hell or (2) elevator up to the penthouse on the 5th floor--which also has a bar, cafe-style tables, and an open balcony.After select performances, RTC hosts post-show Q&A sessions with cast members (free with admission) on the stage. The post-show discussion I attended featured Elizabeth McGovern, Matthew James Thomas, and Gabriel Ebert in street clothes who answered questions from audience members (who all consolidated into the orchestra seats).The theatre can be reached via all subway lines that stop at either 42nd St. or Times Square. The main entrance and box office are on 42nd St, but the nondescript stage door is to the left of the 43rd St. exit. There's no guarantee that actors will appear, but I spotted Anna Baryshnikov, Gabriel Ebert, and Matthew James Thomas after seeing Time and the Conways, and got autographs from the last two.",10,3,6
2,David M.,"Westfield, NJ",101,655,0,4.0,12/27/2017,"Nicely restored vintage theater. All orchestra seats have good views. Pleasant staff. Pretty interior. Sadly the current offering, John Lithgow's one man show was a huge disappointment--boring and dated.",1,,
3,Thierry S.,"New York, NY",2,66,46,4.0,6/16/2018,"My wife and I saw Tom Stoppard's Travesties here. I thought the place was quite big and conveniently located near the trains on Times Square. Doors opened thirty minutes before the show. After a quick security check we were seated in comfortable seats at the orchestra on the third row and the view of the stage, layout and acoustics were great. Ushers were very friendly and helpful and gave us a quiz to fill before the show. This place comes with a bar on the first and fifth floor, restrooms on every floor and two elevators. There were mostly elderly people in the audience. Performance was ok, but this 155 minutes show felt a little too long for my taste.",,,
4,Alan L.,"Cranford, NJ",20,382,339,4.0,1/14/2018,"Don't be fooled by the modern exterior. When you find your seat in the theatre you will be pleasantly surprised by the comfortable seats and clear sight lines. The theatre is attractive, much of the 100 year old wall art was restored. The 42nd Street exterior is quite different.",1,,

Don't discount the box seating.  It says partial view but for the show I saw, it was only partial view for about 5 seconds and then the rest of the show was great.(Shows seen: The Price)",5,1,3

I've been a huge fan since the Usual Suspects. He delivers a heart wrenching performance.It's on TKTS and we paid $60 for rear mezz seats: you can see anywhere you sit at this theatre.",3,1,2
7,Diane C.,"Great Neck, NY",38,145,805,5.0,3/22/2017,"This theatre is beautiful! It seems a little smaller than other theatre places on Times Square, but I love it! I watched The Price by Arthur Miller here- it was really great, except that it was at times a little difficult to hear what the actors were saying since they did not have the microphones on them (they are probably close to or on the stage). Regardless, my experience here was great and the ticket booth line moved really quickly even though there were only two windows open. Overall, recommend!",1,,2
8,Monica T.,"New York, NY",226,1878,25,4.0,9/3/2017,Came here to see Marvin's Room with a friend.  The venue itself is really nice and staff was friendly.  I'd never been here before so it was nice to experience that though I'm sure this would be way out of my budget if I were paying for tickets.  The show itself was all right; the crowd I saw it with seemed to be fans.  I have no complaints.,,,1
9,Anon N.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,90,4,1.0,6/15/2017,"After what happened tonight? Never again.I had a ticket for Marvin's Room. Meh show, but can't blame the theater for that. They charge $19 for a cocktail? Insane, but I don't drink. Ok. So I walk in and the theater is freezing. My hands felt like frozen paws throughout the evening. But the worst part was the seats.You have to share your armrest with your neighbor. Really, American Airlines? You can't afford separate armrests?If you are sitting next to someone normal, the armrest thing is not an issue. You share the space as best as possible.Sadly, I was sitting next to a real ass who decided to hog up the armrest for the entire first act barely giving me a bit of space.But he had to go to the bathroom sometime.That's when I zoomed in and took my share of the armrest back.He didn't like it.He yelled, "" You're infringing on my space!"" in front of everyone, then rudely walked over me to get a free seat that opened nearby because some people did not like the show and left.I ran out of the theater so fast after it was over, terrified he would enact some revenge. People need separate armrests.",,3,1
10,Michael M.,"New York, NY",204,454,943,4.0,3/26/2017,"This is a nice theater. Even in the aisle seat in the last row, there were good views of the stage. Seats also seemed much roomier than other theaters, with a bar between each row of seats in the mezzanine. There was also space in the lobby to walk around without feeling trapped. Bathrooms can have long lines or you have to walk to other floors and find them. Came here to see the Price which was very entertaining.,",3,2,1
11,Freddy V.,"Brooklyn, NY",59,293,152,5.0,3/10/2016,"Enjoyed a wonderful matinee show at the American Airlines theatre. The ambiance, space, and total enjoyment was by far one of the best I have  experienced in a Broadway show. We watched the show called ""Noises off"", which is based off the movie staring Christopher Reeves and John Ritter which came out in the early 90's. I recommend coming here and enjoying this wonderful show at this amazing theater.",,,
12,Josephine L.,"Manhattan, NY",600,1428,20,3.0,11/19/2014,"The name of this theatre is silly. Sponsorship be damned, if you're going to named after an airline, then I expect to be in a whole other city when I exit.Aaaanyway, AAT is actually a very beautiful theater with not so awesome sound. During a viewing of ""Violet"", I had some trouble hearing everything clearly. It wasn't the volume that was the issue, it was the clarity--like words were garbled or something. Not sure what that was about.AAT is also on the narrower, squishier side of American theatres, so expect to have major difficulty getting around if you're older than 6. And if you've got long legs? First, damn you, because long legs are awesome. Second, be prepared to be mighty uncomfortable tucking them in or banging them against your front neighbor all night long.",3,2,2
13,Tony R.,"Hoboken, NJ",477,143,22,5.0,2/13/2016,"My wife and I attended ""Noises Off!"" last night and it marked our third total visit to this theater. It's more modern than some of the other Broadway theaters and the seats don't feel nearly as close together as some of the other houses we've been in. The crown jewel is the 5th Floor lounge. Go before the house opens and have a drink, go during intermission to get a refill and not wait in line for the bathroom and go after the show is done while people clear out for a relaxing exit. Looking forward to the next time we get to visit this theater!",1,,
14,Stacy P.,"Denver, CO",86,669,1117,5.0,7/20/2014,"I had front row tickets to see Violet, and it was an amazing experience. You aren't low enough (and the stage isn't high enough) to have any view obstruction whatsoever. You can easily see the stage floor from your seat, which is great. The seating was comfortable with ample legroom. Like most of the big NYC theaters, this place is beautiful. During intermission I had fun just staring at the incredible art, the beautiful ceiling... being in places like this makes it fun to dress up a bit for a night on the town.",2,,1
15,Jeff L.,"Matawan, NJ",45,238,707,5.0,10/7/2015,"Love this theater that is the roundabouts venue on 42 nd street.   Just blocks from Times Square and right down the street from port authority.  Go to the fifth floor and hang out before the show in their patrons lounge. They have a bar, tables and an outdoor balcony.",2,,
16,Anna B.,"Montclair, NJ",337,88,10,3.0,6/12/2016,"This theatre was just okay and nothing great.  The seats are worn and uncomfortable and the rows are very long.  You constantly have to stand to let people in.  The location is surrounded by people but there are many food options.  The theatre was clean with friendly staff and it was intimate.  Sitting on the second level you still had a great view and could hear everything.  I wouldn't be thrilled to see another play here, but this theatre wouldn't stop me.  Note to everyone reading this- if you are going to a Broadway show dress up.  No excuses.",5,2,2
17,Christopher M.,"New York, NY",1578,1618,380,4.0,4/21/2014,"It pains me to give a theater four stars when its location requests me to swim through the single most densely populated tourist area of the city in order to see a show.  But, alas, I liked the space!  Oddly low ceilings in the lobby and foyer, but it felt comfy.  Not a horrible climb to the balcony.  And AWESOME seats in the ""nose bleeds"".The one balcony usher seemed off her game, but was quite pleasant.  The rows are LOOOONG and narrow, so you're gonna have to stand for those who arrive after you do.  But the seats are very roomy, and quite comfortable.I did notice some sound ""issues"" in need of a tweak here and there....but couldn't tell if that was the theater/equipment, or the operator.But I liked it!  Rather no frills, in a good way.",2,,
18,Nell S.,"Manhattan, NY",7,77,27,5.0,9/30/2016,"Box office personnel who assisted us was fast, friendly, and personable. Really appreciated such a speedy process for getting tickets while rushing off to see another show in the neighborhood. Hopefully the show will be equally impressive!",1,,
19,Susan L.,"New York, NY",179,1921,0,4.0,10/12/2014,"We had front-row seats for ""The Real Thing"" yesterday and it was the first time we'd been to that theater.  The interior of the theater is *gorgeous* and it's one of the most beautiful theaters I've ever seen.The play's first act was basically a bore, but the second act was better and the actors did a credible job - although we were surprised the play had won awards (when it was performed many years ago), since we didn't feel it was very powerful.",,1,1
20,M C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,23,3,4.0,5/18/2016,"Try to sit near the left side of the theater!!the street noise can get loud, especially for a quiet play like ""Long day's journey into the night."" The exit doors are on the right side of the theater and to avoid the sirens I'd definitely aim for the left side. Gorgeous theater though it's a tight space for the audience; get ready for cramped passageways during intermission.",2,,
21,Ali C.,"St Petersburg, FL",286,547,56,4.0,7/5/2015,"what a nice smallish sized theater.  The decor is a throwback, but the chairs are comfortable and I believe it is newer.  They have a lounge on the 7th or 8th floor for a pre-show drink or nibble and patio (no view).  Not a bad seat in the place.  Enjoy!",,,
22,helen w.,"New York, NY",0,19,0,2.0,9/24/2016,"I saw Long Days Journey into Night with Jessica Lange at this teatre. We sat in orchestra seats - facing the stage...to the right- and found the experience terrible. We could hear people on the street outside and often found it difficult to hear the dialogue. Lange is a soft speaker but still you should be able to hear the actors without ambient noise outside. Also, people were allowed to be seated while the play was going on.  I'm a firm believer in the way the British do it: if you're late, you wait and watch the play from the back. When there's a break, you get seated.  I can't tell you how many interruptions we had with people getting seated who came in late.Would not go back to this theatre unless I sat smack in the middle up front.",,,
23,Leigh M.,"Oceanport, NJ",114,77,60,4.0,3/7/2014,"This theatre is beautiful . Every seat in the house is a good one ! I was given tix to machinal and well that was a downer but the experience of the play house was all worth the crazy hour and a half play . The staff is very nice always willing to help you and the people there were of the older generation , minding their own business. Over all not a good place for kids , too small. Only gripe was that bathroom was down stairs , became a problem at the end of the show. I will hopefully be back!",,,
24,Jamie M.,"Conshohocken, PA",664,934,969,4.0,1/6/2013,"Just returned home from seeing Picnic in the theater here. Aside from having a stellar cast, it had a great set and a story line that instantly pulled you into the world of the characters and left you wanting more! The theater itself is very polished and modern feeling and definitely is a worthwhile place to see a show.The show itself, Picnic, is one of many being produced by the Roundabout Theater Company; I believe they have 4 shows out at the moment.Our seats were Orchestra level, row 3 (3 rows from the stage) on the left side and we defintely got what we paid for in seating! (Our seats were actually cheaper than normal because I found an online code for Picnic while its still in previews. Total win!)There was a coat check and bar in the lobby, while the bathrooms were located on the first floor and 5th floor, so everyone is not all cramped up waiting for the facilities.They even had a discussion with Sam Gold after the performance where the audience could talk with him about the show, which I thought was pretty cool.A very cool place to see a show on broadway, two thumbs up!",1,,2
25,Ian Y.,"Newark, DE",184,364,156,4.0,9/1/2014,"I love everything Broadway, but I hate what has become the Broadway standard of tiny seats, inadequate legroom, and squinting to see the stage from the nosebleed section.  You will find NONE of that at the American Airlines theater.  This intimate, (relatively) recently renovated theater is one of the best places to see a show: comfy seats, lots of legroom, and not a bad seat in the house (I was in the second-to-last row in the balcony and still felt close enough to the action of the show -- in this case, Violet -- to become emotionally drawn in).Plus, it's owned by Roundabout Theatre Company, which, being a non-profit, has some of the nicest management around and makes theater affordable to young patrons through its HipTix program.  Not to mention Roundabout tends to be a bit bolder with its production choices (case in point: Violet was a fantastic production that wouldn't have been produced on Broadway otherwise).My only complaints:* In order to get to the bathrooms, you have to go into the theater first.  More of an odd set-up than a huge inconvenience.* The lead usher was eyeing me suspiciously every time I was in his range of sight.  Dude, calm down.",2,1,
26,Paige S.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",0,17,1,5.0,2/1/2016,"Solangel Bido at the box office is absolutely awesome! She helped me so much when my tickets were missing. She went above and beyond to make me feel valued. I think the fact this company hires people like her speaks volumes about how much this company truly values all their theater-goers.

28,Keith T.,"Manhattan, NY",100,519,43,4.0,5/15/2011,"This theater obviously received a lot of individualized love and attention during its renovation. Its ultra-modern exterior hides an impeccably yesteryear interior complete with gilt chandeliers and marble banisters. I've been to the AA Theater twice now, both times to see the incredibly funny The Importance of Being Earnest. My first visit, I got a good deal on 2 seats in an orchestra-level box. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but the box was so far over to the side that a full quarter of the stage was invisible to me. It was nice to be so close to the stage and, for the most part, I didn't miss anything important, but it was still obnoxious to have to lean over for the entire show.My second visit was just this past Friday. This time I splurged a bit to buy 2 seats on the front row of the balcony. The view was PERFECT and the entire cast put on a performance completely worth the money I spent. The bathrooms are large and modern and the stairwells are plentiful, allowing for a quick exit at the end of the show. They even has ushers at the exits, telling you to watch your step and that you were exiting onto 43rd Street - a nice touch!",4,,
29,Mary Z.,"East Haven, CT",21,24,0,4.0,4/14/2015,Beautiful theatre. I was quite impressed. I liked the 5th floor lounge with a nice outside balcony to get some fresh air. My only complaint was that the sounds during the show were kind of muffled ( I was sitting in orchestra). If you have hearing issues this would not be a great venue.,2,,
30,David W.,"New York, NY",237,147,14,5.0,4/3/2013,"This is one of my favorite Broadway Theaters. The interior is gorgeous, and it is very well kept up. This is Roundabout's jewel.  The theater is relatively new so it doesn't have the older feel that somewhere like the Court of the Lyceum has, but it has a wonderful character to it.I have not always seen the best plays here (particularly avoid The Big Knife, which is currently playing), but I always love the experience of seeing things here.  The rear mezzanine seats are quite good, and the seats are comfy and the legroom is significantly better than other theaters. Also, if you get bored, the ornate artwork on the ceiling is beautiful. :-)Tip:  for every play in its season roundabout offers $10 preview tickets to the first four shows.  You will need to keep on this, it is on their website under ACCESS10 and is usually offered the first day tickets go onsale, and these do go quickly, but to see a show for less than the price of a movie ticket, it is worth it!Another tip is to go up to the lounge in the penthouse before or during intermission. It is a great space, and there is another bar up there, and ample restrooms. One of my favorite spaces.  Overall, one of my favorite theaters. I always commend Roundabout for being one of the more accessible theater companies too. There are multiple ways to see shows cheaply here. All of their shows offer a general rush for about $30 the day the box office opens. Seats are generally in the rear mezzanine, but as I have said, the view is great! Also, their Hiptix program is available for anyone under the age of 35 is a great way to snag seats in advance. Just sign up on their website.",4,,
31,Alex S.,"Jersey City, NJ",175,394,48,4.0,6/4/2013,"Very nice theater! Another reviewer said this was the Roundabout's jewel, and they are right. It is new but still has character. My personal highlights: The seats are made for actual human beings, not stick figure cartoon people who are 3 feet tall. The bathrooms are new and almost large enough to handle the crowd! I think they had about 5 urinals and 2-3 stalls in the men's bathroom. Compared with the other theaters I've been to this was like the Taj Mahal.My only gripe is that they don't allow drinks at your seats. I guess they're trying to keep it nice or something. (scoff)We saw the Big Knife here, which is playing now. While the acting was good, I wasn't a huge fan of the story. At the intermission, I found myself conversing with people in the area and we seemed on agreement that we just 'didn't get it.' The personalities of the people, their reactions and attitudes, just didn't seem to make sense given the context of the situation. The ending didn't help. But that's neither here nor there. The theater was one of my favorites.",1,1,2
32,Stephanie T.,"Castro Valley, CA",382,204,47,4.0,10/21/2012,"I really liked the overall feel of the place when I recently saw a product of Cyrano de Bergerac at this theatre. It has a classic feel, and the seats and stairwells are lovely and add to the ambiance. We sat in the second row center on the mezzanine level and had a great view of the production. I don't think there is really a bad seat in the house. A useful tip: at intermission instead of heading back down to the first floor lobby, take an elevator upstairs to the 5th floor. There are concession up here as well as a large lobby area with ample seating, restrooms, and an open balcony if you want to catch some fresh air. Hardly anyone headed up this way, which meant short to no lines and a lack of crowds. The coat check process was very quick and efficient and all of the staff were friendly and helpful. A great place to catch a show!",5,,1
33,Paula S.,"Manasquan, NJ",4,29,3,4.0,3/1/2015,Saw on the On The Twentieth Century here. What a great theater. We were in row N orchestra. There was plenty of leg room and the seats were plenty wide. Been to many other theaters where your knees are touching the seat in front of you.,1,,
34,Kem W.,"Woodstock, MD",15,208,6,3.0,4/4/2015,"It's a Broadway theater. It's pretty on the inside. It has rest rooms. The seats were standard size for broadway... not a lot of leg-room but OK.

35,Michelle W.,"Manhattan, NY",117,327,83,5.0,6/10/2013,"I love the Roundabout Theatre Company. Their productions normally don't disappoint me (but The Big Knife was a bit underwhelming, even with amazing star actors), and they help encourage my generation to go to the theatre more by providing affordable tickets. Plus, their productions are in absolutely GORGEOUS theatres.The American Airlines Theatre is one of my favorites - even when you're in the rear mezzanine, you can still see everything really well (see #1 in buzzfeed.com/ericafutter…), the seats are ridiculously comfortable and there's a ton of leg room. The ceiling artwork is absolutely beautiful, and the ushers are super nice. I haven't been to the penthouse yet, but I'm planning to go the next time I see a show here.If you can - try and see a show here.

36,Rachel A.,"Brooklyn, NY",719,1501,1720,5.0,12/2/2009,"Sometimes I can be a bit of a theater snob. I refuse to pay for the cheap seats. I'd rather shell out the cash than pay to sit in a seat where my view is blocked and the actors on stage look like ants. When you're so far away sometimes you don't get the full effect of what is really going on onstage.American Airlines Theater was a pleasant surprise. I've walked by it for many years and never saw a show there until tonight. I always thought that since it was endorsed by American Airlines that it would be cheesy. It's not at all. It feels new and posh. It has an elevator but even if you decide to walk up, the trip up the stars is not very long. It's not a very big theater. And my discount ticket of rear mezzanine seats was pretty good. We sat in the third row to the last and it was as good as sitting in the orchestra. There were no bars and no heads blocking my view of the stage. The seats were elevated and high enough from each other that even the tallest person in front of you would not get in your way. The seats did not have sunken cushions and there was ample leg room. If all rear mezzanine seats were like the ones at American Airlines Theater, I'd be more inclined to see more shows just for the hell of it. At American Airlines, I'd recommend buying the discounted student and rush tickets. Its a real deal.",7,4,4
37,Ronda R.,"Manhattan, NY",36,79,14,4.0,12/23/2012,"I've seen 2 shows here: Cyrano de Bergerac and Picnic. I sat in the rear mezzanine for Cyrano and in the back of the orchestra (row P) for Picnic. In the rear mezzanine, I had a good view of everything. It was kind of far away, but I could still see the actors' expressions, and none of the stage was blocked. In the back of the orchestra, my view of the upper portion of the stage was blocked. That was fine for seeing Picnic--almost all of the action takes place on the stage level. But for some shows, like Cyrano, where some of the action happens above the stage, a seat in the rear mezzanine would be much better than the back of the orchestra.The theater itself is nice, and I like that Roundabout offers discounts for young patrons (Hiptix).",1,,
38,Monica C.,"New York, NY",23,79,459,4.0,3/21/2011,"4.5 starsThis is a beautiful theatre with fancy chandeliers and a painted sky on the ceiling.  The size is small enough that you can get a good view from any seat.  The seats are comfortable and plush and designed in a way that you won't have any heads blocking you.  I would have given this theatre 5 stars, but it was freezing inside which somewhat diminished my complete enjoyment of an excellent show (""The Importance of Being Earnest"").",,,
39,Marin C.,"Traverse City, MI",77,1270,237,4.0,11/19/2012,"This is a lovely theatre.  Even the nosebleed seats have a decent view, the sound quality was good also.  My friend and I went to see the play, ""Cyrano de Bergerac."". If you are not familiar with the story, go out and get the book!  Though I'll admit some bias because I am a francophile to the maximum.  This production is in English,by the way.       The company putting on the show is the roundabout theater co, they have four different shows on at the moment.  P.s, my friend signed up for a free membership via the roundabouts website, look for the heading called hiptix if you are between 18-35, it allows those eligible to buy tix to their companies shows for 20$, plus a two dollar handling fee.  Seats are in the mezzanine usually, but you can upgrade them if you wish, though It may be for an upcharge.",,,1
40,L K.,"Cambridge, MA",7,129,0,4.0,4/15/2011,"We saw The Importance of Being Earnest here, and it was the best play performance I'd ever seen.  But this review is about the theatre itself: better than some other broadway-hosting theatres I've visited but still limited in many ways by its construction time.  Walking up certain stairways was difficult because there was not enough width to accommodate two slim people, so people were uncoordinated between those going up and those going down.  You can understand how difficult that is during the rush moments, five to ten minutes before the play begins.  The bathrooms are in the basement, which was less convenient to reach though understandable given the space constraints.  We sat in the orchestra section and enjoyed the view.  However, I wish the floor had been slanted more strongly because the man in front of me obscured part of my view for the entire play.  The staff were helpful and nice, though not as outgoing as those I met in Carnegie Hall.  Refreshments were, as expected, highly limited in selection and extremely expensive.  I recommend the milk chocolate bar with caramel.",,,

The staff was unfriendly, literally yelling at people for simple things like taking pictures of other family members before a show, or standing up and talking before the show.The seats are horrible and cramped. I'm a thin guy, and I felt cornered in and tight fitting.",,,
42,John I.,"Toronto, Canada",10,559,2,3.0,3/14/2010,"I recently saw Present Laughter at the American Airlines Theater. I sat roughly six rows from the stage, starting in the corner area and then moving to the aisle as some people left early. The seats were plush and comfortable. I didn't feel claustrophobic. I was not impressed with the sound quality of the theater. The sound was not in stereo, plus the recorded music did not have good amplitude within the theater. Something must have been wrong or its just not designed for good acoustics.The lightening was generally good and it was relatively easy to find seats. This is not a large venue and thus I would advise not to go for the most expensive seat and sit a bit further back. It will be roughly the same experience.I did not test the restrooms or refreshment area, so I cannot provide an analysis on this matter.Enjoy the American Airlines Theater!",2,,
43,Pamela S.,"New York, NY",900,1199,107,5.0,6/18/2009,"The home of the Roundabout theater company, American Airlines Theater is an impressively restored small/mid-size theater with an orchestra and a balcony level. It has a pleasant, ornate interior that's small enough to feel relatively intimate. There's a refreshment bar off of the orchestra entrance that serves standard pre-theater and intermission drinks and snacks plus a creative cocktail or two that's inspired by whatever production happens to be on at the moment.",1,3,1
44,Karen V.,"Manhattan, NY",20,78,0,5.0,11/28/2011,"Aside from having sometimes strange patrons (once saw two elderly ladies being held back from actually fighting each other), this venue offers a great mix of classic plays as well as forgotten ones-- and they often are presented in a rather timely fashion.  The strange is always set to be pretty amazing, camouflaging its petiteness.  I am honestly very grateful RoundAbout Theatre for opening my world up with varied enchantment.",,,
