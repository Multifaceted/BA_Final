0,Marissa L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,187,388,4.0,6/8/2018,"Lenwich (although years later I still call it Lenny's) is a good spot for a quick sandwich in Hell's Kitchen. While it's certainly not a perfect spot (they close on the early side, sandwiches aren't cheap, service can be very slow during peak times), one thing I have really appreciated is the consistency, as the sandwiches have remained at pretty much the same quality over the many years we've been going there.My favorite for a long time was the C1, now the crack jack turkey, but when they updated the menus a few years back, they raised the price and added some chipotle mayo sauce that it really didn't need. I don't get it every time now but mix it up with the Emma or the Jimmy T. Also, this branch of Lenwich has a big room with tables in the back, which is really nice if you don't want to take the sandwiches to go.",1,,1
1,Troy H.,"Rochester, NY",88,360,641,5.0,12/14/2017,"I was able to waltz in here at 11am on a sunday, order a sausage egg and cheese bagel sandwich, AND sit down and enjoy it at my leisure! How can I not award 5 stars??Was kind of shocked this place wasn't more crowded at prime late breakfast/brunch time on a weekend. The large seating area in the back was a pleasant surprise..who wants to scout around a crowded cafe for a seat or else walk down the street eating?My bagel sandwich couldn't not have been better...crusty toasted whole wheat bagel, soft interior..and the eggs were fluffy fresh, sausage was good. The price wasn't great at around $5.15 but reasonable. They do lose some points on their ordering system which is disorganized and leads to customers congregating at the front door waiting for their food. There has to be a better way, That aside, I would easily come here again",2,,2

It wasn't too busy. No line but about 4 other orders being made before me while I waited.// SeamlessI noticed the prices on seamless differ slightly from the store. Everything in the store is $8.99, while on seamless it starts at $7.49, and what I ordered (Turkey & Brie) is $9.49. I might do seamless next time to save time, although I didn't see focaccia bread as an option online.// FoodI got the Turkey and Brie sandwich on focaccia. It was good, but not out of this world. The sandwich would have been a lot better if the bread was toasted, but I didn't think to ask for it and the attendant didn't offer it as an option. The turkey was processed sandwich meat, not fresh-off-the-bird Thanksgiving kind. The brie was nice and melty. For $10, I almost wish I had lunch at Yum Yum Too. But if you're in a sandwich mood, I'd give this place a shot and ask for toasted bread!",,,

People were sort of huddled all around the entrance and in the area where you would have expected a line, so there was a lot of tapping on shoulders and asking ""Have you ordered yet?"" In addition to a variety of sandwiches and salads, they have a refrigerator case with grab-and-go yogurts, juices, and things. It didn't take long for my wrap to come out, and it was pretty standard. The lettuce was a little eh, but otherwise it was fine. One weird thing is that they call out numbers for the orders, but they don't give you the receipt so that you know what your number is. So, then they end up just calling out everyone's name. In short, they need to get the basic order procedure together because everyone seemed confused.

I waited a little long for one person (one person is about 10 people in a Starbucks line): just saying...It was fine it was after work, but I wouldn't go here during lunch and wait that long.

Updated review","I had gotten tired of eating at the diners all the time and I didn't want to spend a lot of time waiting for my food so once again I tried Lenwich. I didn't realize last time I was there how extensive the menu is-I got the breakfast plate-two eggs, bacon, coffee, toast [rye]-I declined the home fries. The food was good and hot. The counter person was polite and efficient. Everything was put in a bag and there is counter space towards the front of the restaurant but there are a large number of tables towards the back which I was unaware of. I know that most of their business is take out but I decided to eat in and there are no facilities  to recycle. Most of what came with my food [tin foil, plastic container, coffee lid] I ended up recycling at home. Despite this, I would recommend and return.",,,
18,Lorenzo H.,"San Francisco, CA",182,132,29,3.0,3/7/2017,"So I just moved to Hell's Kitty recently and I came here one morning for breakfast. They have a bunch of sandwiches and wraps and they had a pretty decent breakfast menu. I ordered the ham and eggs hash and my friend got a carrot cake muffin. The plus is that you get a nice plastic container for the breakfast meals if you're taking it to go. That's pretty much it. The eggs were cooked nicely, but the potatoes were so undercooked it was boiled mashed potatoes with 2 pieces of green peppers. And the ham is 4 slices of deli cold cut ham. It was pretty inexpensive for NYC but then again the ingredients are cheap. The worst was my friends muffin. It was supposed to be stuffed with cream cheese but it turned out just to be a suggestion of cream cheese. (Posting pic up) would not go back for breakfast again. I'd have to really be craving a sandwich if I were to go back, but there's a million sandwich places so close by.",,,

26,Kathy K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,5.0,5/14/2017,I hope the management of Lenny's reads this post because I wanted to let them know what a fantastic job Neomi at the front counter does for their business.  I go on Sunday's and she is always warn and welcoming and juggles so many people at the counter brilliantly.  She ensures that everyone is being acknowledged and their orders are started and she kind of deftly figures out how to layer the service so she gets everyone into the queque and then goes back and forth on each order so everyone feels they are being waited on even if the line is long.  She is a great asset to Lenny's and when I come in on Sunday and she is not their it is just not the same.  Lenny's coffee is THE BEST surpassing all the specialty coffee shops and most importantly it is consistent.  I love all the coffee but especially the Hazelnut!  Greatest muffins too!,,,

Do not go.----------------------------------------As a vegetarian, I'm not a HUGE fan of Lenny's chain in general because I don't have any appreciation for their meats/cold cuts.HOWEVER, I CAN appreciate the endless fresh toppings that they are willing to put on a bagel with cream cheese. The bagels themselves aren't anything special...they are kind of tasteless actually....but when topped with low-fat cream cheese, capers, tomatoes and cucumbers? It turns into something pretty magical. Plus, at $4.00 for a bagel with all those toppings, I'd say it's reasonable for a bi-weekly morning treat.I've experienced terrible service from the Lenny's shops around the city, but with this particular shop I'm always greeted with a friendly ""good morning"" and a smile. Not to mention I'm in and out within less than 5 minutes, and the walls seem to sparkle with how clean the place is!Overall, this is a place for meat eaters...but if you're a hungry vegetarian who needs something to fill them up until lunch (or even dinner!) get a bagel and add as many fresh veggies as you can handle.

While they are pricier than Subway, the quality is much better, you have WAY more choices, you get WAY more meat and have more bread options.

I have been to this location countless times (and almost equally as many times to other locs in Manhattan) and I can state that they are pretty consistent with quality of food and service.Pre-theatre bite? CheckQuick mid-town lunch? CheckGood prices for the area? CheckGreat quality for the price? CheckThere's also ample seating in the back and rarely a long wait (a few minutes even on a busy day).,,,1

It appears to be very clean at the store front but I question their sourcing. The sandwiches are constructed on a grand scale, but are composed mainly of what I call sandwich fluff, stuff like heaps of shredded lettuce and overly pillowy breads while skimping on the thing your looking for (eg their chicken cutlets tend to be 50% breadcrumb.)Other than that the food is ok.",2,,

The counter staff immediately asks if you want it toasted, but as a bagel-eater raised on classic H & H, I was born knowing that a bagel never needs toasting - unless it's old. So I did it again, bought a $3 Everything with scallion cream cheese, and I got the same stale, mealy texture that's apparent in a mass-produced bagel trucked in from a factory that makes them for every other cheap deli. Here's my tip for bagel novices: never buy one unless you see bakers rolling/boiling/baking them on-site. I will follow my own advice from now on.",1,1,

72,Larry S.,"New York, NY",225,14,1,3.0,7/7/2011,"Lenny's is a good place to eat if you work in Manhattan and need a quick lunch. They cook up your sub fairly quickly, although not as fast as Subway, and they even have a seating area in the back. It's a bit pricy for what you get, but it does warrant that extra $2-3 over Subway, for instance.I got Roast Beef on a whole wheat hero. It was a decent sized sub, a little wider than subway, but also not as long. It had a good amount of grilled roast beef, not too much, not too little, as well as shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and honey mustard. The bread was soft due to the juices of the beef, just the way I like it.It came out to $9. Great variety here. Pretty fast service. Decent price.

You can actually see what goes on behind the counter. The employees work hard and they're polite. I've had mistakes on an order or two, but nothing that wasn't fixed immediately with a prompt apology. I love the walls that broadcast Lenny's celebrity sightings with framed magazine and newspaper clippings. Even celebrities eat at places like one of the people!

Whatever you want Lenny's has it. They have a great pick your own ingredients salad bar, the best sandwiches and hot food. I am a fan of their turkey pastrami and cheese on marble rye bread. When I come home from school I usually bring a sandwich home for myself and my mom...she's a big fan of their regular pastrami as well. They have great cookies and brownies as well.

Anyway, the sandwiches are a bit over price, I'd say by a dollar or two.  My prosciutto & black forest ham sandwich (c3) was OK.  Nothing to rave about...the only thing cool is the choice of bread - I got mine with marble rye.There are a lot of sandwiches here, though - cold, hot, Lenny's specials , etc., but I think you can get the same sandwich in any city deli for less money.  It's all a gimmick - a logo and matching outfits don't really scream out homerun sandwiches ...just pricier sandwiches to pay back their trademarking fees.",1,,

But aside from the pastrami nothing is memorable, there's no personality, just a good but boring quick meal. Online ordering is quick and easy.

I tried what I believe was called The Lenny which consists of Pastrami, Corned Beef , Swiss, coleslaw, and Russian dressing on 7 grain bread.  I had to say the nearly 10 dollar price tag startled me a wee' bit  but I shrugged my shoulders and sat down to enjoy my sam'mich and chocolate milk. (Yeah I still drink chocolate milk, you know why, IT'S DELICIOUS!!!) Anywho I found myself pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoying this sandwich.  I have since eaten it on many other occasions and found the consistency across the chain keeps me happy every time.  I recommend if you like sandwiches and work anywhere near one of these places that you give it a try, it is probably better than most of the city's crappy delis.  Hope you find your sandwich!!!
