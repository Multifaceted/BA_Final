0,Michael M.,"New York, NY",204,454,936,3.0,1/29/2016,"The perk of this place is it's cheap... Like super cheap. Western omelette with home fries and four pieces of toast for $4.50 cheap. It's also super quick. I come here after night shifts when I'm just too lazy to cook. The food is fine. It's just I can easily make just as good of food at home. So even if it's cheap, if I have any energy at all to cook, this place isn't worth going to for me. But if your away from home and need a super filling cheap meal, this is the place!",1,,
1,Ming K.,"New York, NY",54,68,753,4.0,2/5/2015,"Located at 23rd st. & Lexington. Can't beat this price/menu in this neighborhood..3 tables /12 seating, self service. Fast service.I ordered 2 eggs platter with home fries & toast, for $2.75. + tea sugar milk $1.00= $3.75 breakfast, Wow.",2,,
2,Noushky F.,"Rosedale, NY",276,137,617,5.0,3/24/2015,"The Hidden City Cafe lives up to their name. A small store on East 25 St  across from the Baruch Lexington building. I ordered Bacon, Eggs and Home Fries with Toast. Price: $3.50I found this interesting because a breakfast sandwich (bacon, egg and toast) ,three doors away (Gramercy Cafe) costed me $7.60. Taste: It bought me home because, I love spanish breakfast.  He seasoned the home fries with garlic, onions, tomatoes, peppers.The eggs were fluffy and light. Bacon was crispy but not burnt. I loved it!",,1,
3,Stephanie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",491,452,8,3.0,9/27/2011,"It's not closed, so can we please fix this so I can start checking in and have the crown? Thanks! Now on to the review!Hidden City Cafe is super small and unassuming. I wouldn't have even noticed it if my friend hadn't brought me there. They have a special deal on tossed salads, where you can get a small with 4 toppings for only $6.50. For a salad, in midtown, that's a KILLER PRICE. Wow! And the salad isn't bad either since you essentially pick everything that goes in there. And yeah, it's a little dirty in there but c'mon. It's the city, what food place doesn't have roaches/rats etc. Let's get real here!! I'll be back!It's now located on 23rd and Lexington.",1,,
4,Jaclyn V.,"Brooklyn, NY",271,176,24,4.0,2/26/2013,1/2 Sandwich (turkey and brie is my fav) and  soup (minestrone)  lunch special for 5.99! It also includes a soda/bottle water and a banana!Great deal and super friendly service.  I am in there all the time :),1,,
5,Ivanna G.,"Elmhurst, NY",4,9,2,2.0,2/11/2015,"Nothing special, got a salad.  The dressing wasn't very appetizing. The veggies were pretty fresh.",,,
6,Andy C.,"Woodside, NY",714,138,31,4.0,8/11/2012,"This is just my go-to spot during lunch time while I'm at Baruch. It's only a block away so it saves me a lot of time. I always get their lunch special which is 1/2 sandwich, salad, banana and a drink for $6.50. Now that is a deal you really can't walk away from especially since nothing is this cheap in the city exception of dollar pizza. Chicken milanese on flatbread is good and there are a lot of toppings for your salad. They had me at $6.50, will always stop by for lunch.",2,,
7,Nina L.,"New York, NY",541,717,153,2.0,6/23/2010,"This poor little place. You can tell the staff works hard and is nice. The food is just not that great, my school uses them frequently. The paninis are hardly ever fresh and I don't know what else to say - just no.",,,
8,Adrienne P.,"Brooklyn, NY",177,304,24,2.0,2/11/2007,"They have a good lunch special here which is about the only reason I go, because otherwise they're prices are a little inflated. Lots of sandwich/wrap and soup choices. Great for catering!EDIT- I'VE STOPPED ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE AS THEY HAVE SOME GLARING HEALTH VIOLATIONS. BE WARNED!",2,,1
9,Nicole S.,"Athens, GA",135,140,23,1.0,6/10/2010,"Ugh... just keep moving, unless you enjoy everything you eat to taste the same and drowned in 1000 Island Dressing.  Our company uses them for various things every year, and well... I'd rather go hungry.",1,1,1
10,lesi w.,"Seattle, WA",153,99,0,4.0,4/14/2009,"Quick lunch place. Nothing fancy, Salad bar has good selection of meats and vegs,- around 7-8 for a large saladSoups are badLarge sandwich selection - $6",,,
11,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",41,280,505,4.0,1/9/2006,"It's new in town, which means if you hurry up, you can catch them handing out free samples.  Speaking of free, they also do free delivery.  I recommend the chicken parmigan sandwich.  It's so grubin' that it makes you burp for an hour afterwards, the potent type of burp that instantly reminds you of what you just ate.",,,
12,Alexandra A.,"New York, NY",9,82,4,1.0,11/30/2009,"I'm going to college in the area, so when i need to get a quick bite to eat i have to run to do it. this place.. is bland and generic. grossly over priced and just... i dunno. Not something i would like to experience daily. it's also bad when you have to eat this as they cater to the school i go to, and it's on our meal plan. terrible idea...",,,
