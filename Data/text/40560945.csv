0,J J.,"Sandy, OR",140,142,115,4.0,11/7/2018,"Wow, this lovely old theatre was the perfect place to see CHICAGO!!!I was surprised at how small it was - therefore I really don't think there is a bad seat in the house.  I loved it!!!However, be fair-warned, super expensive alcohol.  And, there was such a hurry at the bar before the show - the guy didn't explain things well and was in such a hurry, that he ended up charging me a 'special' price for a 'special' cup I didn't want - that cost me $16 for one glass of wine!!???Yikes.Otherwise - just fantastic.If you have long legs - make sure you ask for accommodations for that - the seats are very close together in the rows. :)",,,

However, I'm really disappointed in the theater.Pros:+ Easily accessible+ Close proximity to plenty of restaurants (Times Square, the Rockefeller Center, etc...)Cons:- Drinks are ridiculously pricey - I mean like $15 for a glass of mediocre wine. And, the make you pay through the roof for these ""memorable"" cups- CROWDED - and by crowded, I mean, you can't move inside the theater without hitting your neighbors, the chairs are extremely uncomfortable- In need of repairs - there are several spots were the paint is fading things are broken. They need to do a major touch up",,,
3,Tay M.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,2.0,11/18/2018,"This was my first time at the Ambassador Theatre. I purchased my tickets from a 3rd party (plum benefits) and was told I could pick up my tickets on the day of to see Chicago. I was stoked to be in the atmosphere of broadway until I encountered one of the rude security guards at the theatre.I was told that I needed to go to the box window to retrieve my ticket. As I approached the box office I asked the security guard (young latino man) if I was at the right place. I do not recall him verbally responding to my question. He proceeded to motion his ""mini stick"" to what I thought was my plum benefits confirmation sheet. However, it was my bag he wanted to look at. I had no issues with the individual doing his job. As, he is looking through my small bag that has 3 compartments he pointed and was asking me what certain items were. I was confused because everything he pointed at was visible. Mind you he still has not confirmed that I was in the correct place to pick my tickets up. So, then I mentioned I do have pepper spray to avoid any conflict and proceeded to hand it to him and he just looked at me like I was silly and did not respond.I asked what do you want to with it and he says throw it out. Most ""security guards"" would confiscate the items so it threw me off. I threw out my pepper spray and he then proceeded to go through my bag again. Oh, let me be clear that he didn't see my pepper spray until I mentioned it. Some great bag check he did sarcasm. He made me open my bag again to search and then asked me to show him how my flashlight work like a child. I was so confused as to why he was so interested in a flashlight. Eventually, i was able to go retrieve my tickets.My encounter with this individual definitely left a bad taste for this theatre. I will not go see any shows in this theatre again after my encounter with the inexperienced security guard. He should be trained to use his verbal communication skills. Customer service should be 100% from the front door to the back door.",,,
4,Erik G.,"Costa Mesa, CA",7,46,18,4.0,10/30/2018,"Saw Chicago...greatly play and production.  I would recommend for a fun night out.  Seats are very tight with regards to leg room and concessions were very expensive, a ""cup"" of white wine (Pinot Grigio) was $33.  Lastly, ladies be prepared for very long lines to the ladies room.",,,
5,Sierra J.,"Norristown, PA",0,3,0,3.0,10/29/2018,"Overall, the show was well done but a tip would be that if you buy tickets in the Rear Mezzanine section, be prepared for 5,000 people (including employees) to walk in front of you throughout the whole performance.

7,Andrea F.,"Philadelphia, PA",208,339,27,5.0,4/24/2018,"I guess I'm biased reviewing the venue because I loved the show so much so it's probably skewing my opinion, but regardless, here I am.Putting aside for a moment the fantastic performance that was Chicago, the theater itself was really nice.  Clean,  a little small, but comfortable.  I didn't feel overly cramped in the theatre seats, which was nice.  Staff was SUPER friendly and the woman lining us up for entry and guiding us through the process of ticketing was funny and personable.  Ushers were swift.  The guy serving drinks and snacks was also very friendly (expect to pay $50 for 2 souvenir sippy cups of red wine - but hey, it's roughly 2 glasses of wine per cup, so I say it's worth it if you want a memento and to get a nice buzz during the show).As for the show, it's everything and more (and if you're like me and only saw the movie, you won't be disappointed), but more importantly, the theatre did a fantastic job of the production.  Lighting for pivotal moments (like the Cell Block Tango) was on point, as was the sound/microphones.  The on-stage orchestra/band was SUPERB.  Seriously, just go here and immerse yourself in the experience of the show.It's worth noting that this isn't a spectacle full of colorful scenery and set decorations and glittery costumes.  In fact, there are zero set or costume changes, but the minimalism makes it even better, and the few props/confetti that do appear during ""Razzle Dazzle"" make you appreciate it even more.  It's a timeless show that's worth the ticket prices, so I'd say definitely make a stop a the Ambassador.",1,,1
8,Sam W.,"Fairfax, VA",4,32,3,3.0,8/13/2018,"The show ""Chicago"" was great. But unfortunately this is about something else.Most Theater stuff were courteous and wanted to help. But one bad one would ruin the reputation of a good place. Upon entering the theater, we were shown the way to our seats by theater seat guides. Since one side had people sitting, the stuff suggested we enter through the other side of the aisle. We gladly followed. Suddenly a very loud voice from this person barking toward us, he yelled that we almost passed him without acknowledging his existence. I explained we were directed to enter from this side by the stuff. He was having none of the explanation, and acted like this was my territory that you trespassed. He was so loud and rude, by now I had no choice but ignore his presence. It would not be wise to get into a shouting match with him.A side note, one hour after the show we were in the parking garage to get our car, my wife found that her wallet was missing. She headed back to the theater to ask, and was fortunate to get it back. The theater cleaning stuff found it. Though with all the cash gone, she had the wallet back with ID and credit cards. We thanked the theater.",,1,
9,Tamika J.,"Wharton, NJ",30,250,1009,3.0,9/16/2018,"This theatre isn't big. However, it appeared clean and nice inside. There was a hanging mezzanine which made me believe if I purchased tickets for that section I would have been able to enjoy the show without the cost. I don't know how well people could see the stage from the rear mezzanine rows but if you are sitting in the front mezzanine section your view should still be above average. I had really good orchestra seats and had an amazing view. If you are skinny or 'normal' weight the seats are perfect. If you are a larger sized human, the seats will not be comfortable while sitting next to someone. The bathroom line was RIDICULOUS. It was probably about a 15-20 min wait depending on where you were standing in line. I was told by staff that I could use the restroom on the lower level. The attendant near the bathroom would not let me go in as it was an accessible bathroom only. It would have been helpful to know that before being told that I could use it. The employee near the accessible bathroom was a bit of a douche. Of course you have people selling beverages, cups, etc before the play and during the intermission. I would return here. I'm sure things are much more calm during off peak hours.",4,2,1

Updated review","Nice venue. Smaller than I expected but that allowed for a premium viewing experience. I thought our tickets were okay at first but once inside the theater they were actually great seats! There were three in our party and we loved every minute of the play. An additional ladies restroom and a broader snack selection would increase the stars to four or five. Definitely 5 stars for the cast! The entire cast was phenomenal. Bravo Mrs. Khandi, job well done!",,,
11,Bhavika P.,"Philadelphia, PA",96,237,913,4.0,8/9/2017,"Visited last week to watch Chicago and I thoroughly enjoyed the show. I purchased the ticket from theatre box office and the guy was very patient while we decided what seats we want. If you are a big person seats can be very uncomfortable. I just managed to sit and not move without bumping into person next to me. Reminded me of sitting in an economy class on an airline with tight spot...lol. Hang in there!!!! The other complain I had was the restroom...it is really tiny for the size of theatre. The restroom is on Mezzanine and the queue during the break was all the way down. Overall enjoyed the show, clicked picture with Lana Gordan aka Velma Kelly. The show is amazing!!!",1,1,
12,A M.,"Ship Bottom, NJ",50,159,2,4.0,8/1/2018,"We enjoyed the show very much. It is a tiny theater so every seat in the house is pretty good. I had to deduct a star because of the bathroom situation. It's a long play and the drinks are flowing; 2 bathrooms for a thousand people is a recipe for disaster. I realize it's a fairly petty complaint, however, comfort is a part of the experience. Otherwise the facility is in great shape. The seats are fairly close together but not bad; we had enough room. I really loved that the band was on stage on risers; the band played a huge part in the show and it was refreshing to see them out of the ""pit.""",,,
13,Amanda M.,"Waterbury, CT",372,207,215,4.0,8/20/2017,"Chicago itself was amazing. I understand many people don't understand the idea of having the orchestra on stage, but I love it that way. I was off to the side about 6 rows back and was able to see a good amount of what was going on. If you are the type that needs to see everything purchase tickets for the middle section. A ""single"" drink was a hefty $15 dollars. Which I could easily make the same drink for the same amount money wise at home and got a lot more of it. That was a bummer: I think it was the most I've spent at a broadway show for a drink. Brandy played Roxie Hart at our showing and my husband was unfamiliar with her, but enjoyed the show over all. The theatre is small so there is very little leg room which can make the duration of the show uncomfortable. Get to know your neighbors folks",,,

Mom and I visited The Ambassador Theatre to watch Chicago for her 50th Birthday! It was our first Broadway show at an actual NYC Broadway theatre. Pretty exciting! The show was 5 stars, the theatre was more of a 3. No frills and thrills here in the least. The theatre itself is quite basic as is the offered overpriced concessions. (Try $5 for a pack on M&M's!) But The Ambassador is a classic, right?! I dare not bash a classic from the 1920's, so I'll just move along. We had great seats (front and center, 3rd row) and being the giants that we are, it was tight but bearable. Oh, and get this ... Mom caught one of the roses that was thrown into the crowd at the end of the play! (Cheers to the birthday girl!)Nice bucket-list visit for sure, ""and alllll thaaaat JAAAAAAZZZZZ!""

15,Anonymous Ow L.,"Queens, NY",1,24,0,2.0,7/3/2018,"Comfort* The seats offer very little legroom. Being a theater constructed in the 1920s is not an excuse / pass on providing all patrons with a comfortable experience. The shows at this theater are quite popular and don't come cheap. Renovate. I'm 5'9"" and my legs were very uncomfortable throughout the second half of the performance.Staff* Staff were not swift or suave in performing their duties. Patrons were asking one male usher in particular how to get to their seats. The usher offered ambiguous (and in our case INCORRECT) instructions on finding the seat. Then, exasperated, he exclaimed, ""People! Look at your tickets! It tells you where your seats are!"" This behavior was embarrassingly unprofessional and his solution did not address the issue of patrons' unfamiliarity with the seating scheme of the theater. * Some of the staff smelled. Their odor was particularly pronounced on the hot July evening we attended the musical. * We were seated in the mezzanine and the staff member attending to our general area came by twice during the intermission to inform patrons not to rest items on a certain balcony area due to ""City Safety Regulations."" He repeated himself multiple times and each time rolled his eyes a bit and made air quotes around the words ""City Safety Regulations"" so as to communicate that this was something he *had* to tell people, even though it was annoying. This behavior completely undermined the staff member's message. We all have parts of our jobs that we do not savor, but professionalism demands that we deal with these moments with maturity and elegance. However, the behavior of the staff at the Ambassador was both juvenile and unprofessional, particularly from employees at such a venue. Commit to your job and its level of formality. Strongly encourage safety at large-scale events. Practice thorough, consistent hygiene when engaging with other members of the public while in enclosed spaces. These are not killjoys. They are part and parcel of civil society.",,,
16,Critic C.,"South Gate, CA",58,52,10,2.0,8/26/2018,Staff was great. We saved $40 buying tickets at box office vs online. The seats are super uncomfortable. To the point you can't move without hitting the person in front of you with your knee.,,,
17,Gabe R.,"Chalmette, LA",105,751,345,3.0,8/2/2017,"I took my daughters to see Chicago here about 2 weeks ago and despite not being a Broadway musical type of guy, I had a great time.  The show itself was very entertaining despite minimal set design and a small stage.  Chicago has been on Broadway for about 20 years so the tickets are reasonable as compared to some of the other newer big name shows.  As I mentioned before the theatre itself very small.  The aisle spacing is even smaller.  I felt like a fat man in the middle seat on an airplane.  I'm not making fun of the fat guy in the middle seat....I am the fat guy in the middle seat.  The décor is old and the theatre could use some upgrades for sure.  They charge 10.00 for soft drinks but at least you get a free refill at intermission.The show is a solid 4 stars but the theatre itself is 2-2.5",1,,2
18,Nadia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,229,916,3.0,8/8/2017,"So, first off Chicago was a great musical. Very entertaining with excellent performers. However, the theatre needs a revamp. The seats are small, the aisles are small. Everybody must stand so someone can leave the aisle.  All seats do not have a view of the stage. There was a mixup with my tickets and one of the workers in the ticket office said they would let us in for free. Uhmmmm! I agree, because we paid for them. The line was pretty long on a Tuesday but it moved pretty fast. Chicago is an awesome musical just not in the best theatre. I recommend going to see it but be prepared if your not on the shorter side.",,,
19,Reem C.,"Philadelphia, PA",306,355,7,3.0,7/17/2017,"My wife and I went to see Chicago this weekend. We had great seats. We were in the third row center in the orchestra. We were so close to the actors that we could see everything. The show itself is fun and comical and I would rate it five stars. We really enjoyed it. Now, Ambassador Theatre is very tight. If you're not slim or a certain build, it could make for some uncomfortable viewing. The theatreBefore the show begins, theatre staff walk around selling snacks. They also sell snacks right before the end of intermission. A bottle of water is $5. It's not Holy water, Smart water, Artisan water or any other type of fancy water. It's the kind of off brand water you can buy from Walmart or Target and spend $5 for an entire case of 20 or more. Also, if you intend to go to the restroom during intermission...don't. The lines are very long. I made the foolish mistake of doing so and the restroom was very tight. I've definitely been to nicer theatres, but for a theatre that is close to 100 years old, the kind of ""charm"" it has is to be expected.",,,
20,Benjamin K.,"New York, NY",187,269,56,3.0,9/8/2017,"While I loved Chicago today, I didn't love the theater. I'm giving it three stars. On the plus side, it's cute and has quaint. But it's not entirely comfortable, it's not easy to see everything from the bulk of the seats and the bathroom situation is a nightmare, at least for the females. It's got a nice look to it, but it could be more functional.",3,,1
21,Joshua R.,"East Windsor, NJ",2,13,32,5.0,9/1/2017,"Amazing Theatre. Built in 1921 and owned and operated by the Shubert Organization, it's beautiful architecture is also just amazing. However, I have seen better (in my opinion. If Kure into architecture wonders check out the New Amsterdam Theatre and my review on it for my input ). Used a discount to get $89.00 (with fees:$100.00) front row centre orchestra seats. Since there is no orchestra pit and the orchestra (the band and conductor) is on stage, there was plenty of leg room. Seats were kind of a bit cramped but after positioning myself and settling down in the seat, I was able to sit normally for the entire show. I even spread my legs out in front of me a lot since there was plenty of room! Nice ushers and very friendly bar and concessions people (nice man at the bar and nice lady who was walking up and down isles and through the front row swelling drinks and snacks). Show was amazing. The women's restroom line, as I have read in reviews prior to seeing this show, extend to the stage from upstairs. This is true. However, I am a male so I used the men's restroom. A bit cramped but nothing bad. However, I used the sink closer to the urinals, and there is only one (functioning soap dispenser) which is on the wall next to the other sink, so I had to extend my arm across to get some soap. Other than that no complaints about the bathroom.   Friendly staff. One woman seemed a bit strict but nothing that really was memorable of attention-grabbing.   A tip, sitting on the sides might allow you more Indra toon with the characters, but I waved twice to Natasha Ivette Williams, who played Mamma, and she nodded st me the first time, and smiled and waved back the second time! The two leading actresses throw roses st the end of the show, so be mindful of that when selecting your seats (they don't really throw them beyond the second row I'd say although I didn't really turn around to look but from what I saw on the sides of me I didn't see them go that far back). Lovely experience at the theatre!!",2,1,1

We got lottery tickets for a matinee showing on a Saturday afternoon, so we made our way to Ambassador Theater for the show.  THEATER: 2 starsThe theater staffing ushered us to our seats pretty rudely. But I suppose they wanted us to sit quickly for the show on time. The angle and layout of the nosebleed section definitely made it a little difficult to see the stage. SHOW: 3.5 starsI'm no pro at Broadway musicals but this was definitely one of the less exciting ones. For example, Wicked was much more engaging, for sure. The story was a little blurry for me and it was hard to follow the plot.

26,Jordan B.,"Norfolk, VA",716,400,2483,5.0,7/14/2015,"When I heard that my all time favorite singer Brandy was doing Chicago on Broadway this summer, I knew that I had to make a trip up to New York to see her perform.  I had also never seen a play on Broadway before, so coming to the Ambassador Theater was a very exciting expierence. I had bought my tickets online, and I also had a bag with me so I was expecting a big hassle when I arrived to the theater getting through bag check and getting my ticket.  To my surprise everything went very smooth getting into the theater. The ushers had a little bit of an attitude; however, they did do their job, directing us to our seats. There were a few patrons there though that were ready let them have it. Haha After sitting in my seat, there wasn't a lot of leg room, but luckily I had an end seat so I could turn a little to stick my legs out into the isle.  The upside to the seating though is that there is a good view of the stage from no matter where you're sitting. I was mingling with other people around me in the theater and they were saying the same thing. The reason for the 5-Star review is the show itself.  I had seen the movie Chicago so I was expecting a very serious demeanor among the actors; however, Brandy (Roxie Hart), Amara-Faye Wright (Velma Kelly), Raymond Bokhour (Amos Hart), and NaTasha Yvette Williams (Big Mama) bought an effortless, light hearted, comical take on their roles and didn't take themselves too seriously, which I really appreciate.  I was throughly entertained throughout the whole show. After the show, Brandy was humble enough to come outside and meet all of her fans.  Of course I was one of the first people in line to meet my favorite singer, it was nice to mingle with other fans of her as well.  The thing I really appriciate about Brandy is that the meet and greet wasn't just a quick hi, picture, and bye.  She actually took the time to talk with each and every one of her fans individually.  She even signed posters and playbills.  Getting to talk with her and give her a hug, completely made my life!All in all, my time at the Ambassador Theater is one I will never forget!",3,2,2

Our first Broadway experience and it's one of our favorite shows. We consider ourselves the original Roxy and Velma :-) just without the whole murder thing. When we got there, we were about 20 minutes early and got up to the front of the line. Since we did not order a ticket straight through the venue, we had to get out of line go get our tickets, and then get back in line. Be aware that they do check your bag to make sure you're not bringing any outside alcohol, drugs, etc. They want you to buy their really fancy and overpriced goods inside. Also, weapons etc. When you arrive I was surprised to see that they did start very close to on time. Any theater show I've ever been in the audience of has been late. I spent $25 on a single vodka drink. Mostly because it was served in a really cool Chicago cup. I probably would've bought that anyway so I wasn't too upset. All of the alcohol is very expensive. Also, they don't have any kind of healthy snack assortment or really much to choose from at all except for chocolate candy. I would recommend you peeing beforehand, because the bathroom line gets pretty out of control. Especially if you are drinking while you're watching the show. Due to the fact that my sister and I purchased our tickets so late, we didn't have the greatest seats. We were up in the mezzanine level but we were in the center in the aisle so we could get up whenever we wanted. I liked that, because a few times we had to go to the bathroom during the show to avoid the lines. The show itself is a whole other review, but the theater experience was pretty great. My acting teacher, who I met met up later for drinks with, advised me that any Broadway show is constituted by whether or not the theater seats more than 500 people. That goes to show, the Ambassador Theatre is very big. You can tell they build, reconstruct, and rebuild the stage. It's rich in the sense that it's been around for a long time, or at least it appears that way, don't expect anything to modern or contemporary. Overall, it's your Broadway experience you're really looking for. I know there is a parking lot right next-door, but since we walked I'm not sure with the price is. They pretty much accept credit cards at every station, even the walking vendors accept credit cards. The worst thing about this theater, is the bathroom situation. I only saw one in the entire place and the lines were long, even for the men. I showed pretty hungry, I figured I get myself some popcorn or something. There's literally only chocolate candy so be advised.",,,

Sure, it's big and grandiose when you first walk in the door, but that's about the extent of its charmFirst, the seats. If you're taller than five foot two, you will be uncomfortable. There's less leg room than in a budget brand airline seat, and they're about half the width too. The guy next to me was a decisive man-spreader as well, so we spent most of the show fighting for leg room, while he hogged the armrest. I could basically smell his breath the whole time (at least he was chewing mint gum!), we were so close. From the far sides, you also can't see half of the stage. Thankfully for Chicago, everything takes place right in the very front, but any other show would be rough. The staff we unprofessional, annoying, and uninformative. Sitting near the front of the mezzanine, there's always those show-goers that like to put their feet or pamphlets on the ledge, and staff come tell them to not put anything there. But staff here were so loud and obtrusive about it during the show, it was hard to pay attention to the show through these interruptions! They also walk around before there show starts trying to sell $5 bottles of water amongst other excessively expensive snacks, which makes you feel like you're at a baseball game more than a Broadway show. And to top it all off, after the show was over, staff didn't seem to know how to block exits that people weren't supposed to use, so instead stood next to them and then proceeded to loudly yell at anyone who thought they were allowed to use the large door marked with an ""EXIT"" sign. I mean, how dare anyone think they can go through that!All in all, thankfully the show was great, as this theater sure left something to be desired.",1,,

I chose to watch Chicago as my first Broadway show experience, but I immediately regretted when I stepped into this theater.The theater building was surprisingly small: so small that the narrow hallways could only fit two lanes of people at once. The air was also musty and smoky from the last performance, and the theater itself was clearly dated and has not gone through any significant improvements.One good thing about a small theater is that your cheaper mezzanine seats are closer to the stage than they would in larger, fancier theaters. That and the nice theater staff are the only redeeming factors of this poorly-maintained theater.",5,,

A nice perk was that after we sat down we had staff come around selling snacks, drinks, and wine!  Very expensive - but expected inside a theatre.  Loved that treat.",,,

I've always been thin thanks to the wonders of Asian metabolism, but seeing Miss Velma Kelly raise her leg higher than I can raise my arm on some days was, just, a physical epiphany. The rest of the cast are just as energetic, talented and vivacious, and though the theatre seating is the definition of cramped, the pretty architecture and great acoustics will go a long way to helping you forget that over the next three hours.

The ushers/staff treated us like cattle, yelling at us like we were stupid when moving through the halls. We figured out quite easily how to get to our seats, and just as I started to walk up the stairs to my seat, a bizarre looking, very rude, snooty usher yelled at us like children to ""not pass him... he would help us in a moment, be patient and get out of the aisle, stay to the left so others could pass.... He could only talk to one person at a time... He would help us in order of arrival...."" I swear it was like an SNL skit. Then he turned his back on us, while we stood there looking like sad kindergarteners. Then he grabbed my ticket and said right there, handed is playbills and walked away. What a jerk.Seats were tiny, people talking during the performance, a drunk/high lady sat next to us and kept getting up and leaving, then returning during the show. At one point she left her phone and it started to ring. She was wondering around the theatre no doubt looking for it, then snatched it out of my hands when I handed to her. Where was that nazi theater usher then I wonder.... Running around being a jerk to people for living, I'm sure... The experience felt like we were being hustled. Why should they care what we think?

It's not intimidatingly huge so any seat you land on, you're pretty much guaranteed a good view of the stage. I can't speak too much for the balcony, but even the very back rows of the orchestra wouldn't be too shabby. I would highly suggest staying away from the extreme left/right and being as close to the center as much as possible if you want to see the whole stage.For my alcoholic patrons, there's a bar in the back you can liquor it up but for those who don't want to lift a finger, there are vendors walking around selling wine and candy, the perfect combination for any theatre experience.

As I am no Broadway expert, just a lover, this critique is simply for the theatre and it's service. Compared to several theatres I have visited on Broadway, this theatre was quite underwhelming. The theatre was quite small but gorgeous such as the chandelier in the photos below. We sat in the front mezzanine and the angle to the stage was incredibly awkward. Even though we were in the front, we had to crane are necks to look directly down onto the stage. The seats were narrow and even though we were in the front row, our legs were cramped. The ushers were a little quirky but nothing in a bad way. However, the drinks were incredibly expensive, $50 for two cocktails but I suppose that could have been expected.

Updated review","Owned and operated by Shubert Organization since 1921.I previously saw ""You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown"" during its brief run here.  Now in 2014 returned for ""Chicago"" as I remembered the crammed leg room.  When purchasing tickets I always choose closest to the aisle.  I'm petite 5 feet 1 inch but my legs were very stiff during the entire two and half hour show's run.  Half way through Act I, I had to sway my entire body side-ways to stretch out my legs for circulation and comfort as lucky the seat to my left (aisle seat) was empty.  I sat in the Front Mezzanine which was high as the Rear Mezzanine is significantly higher.  Ambassador Theatre is stadium style seating where your head is one below which allows visibility rather than the antiquated slatted floor.  The building's structure is very dated as it appears not having undergone any upgrades with 2014 era building code compliance.  No elevator access is available for patrons with physical limitations.  Tsk, tsk!!Acoustic systems and lightening are great and completely audible.  Mini bars are available before curtain rises and readily available during intermission, of course extremely overpriced.  Facilities are crammed with insufficient space for one adult body and unable to uphold the 2014 dense population.  The facility stalls do not have hooks for bags/purses as I had to put it around my neck while taking care of business.  Mobile concession stands carry beer and wine in a nice Chicago mug with lid.Women ushers are robotic, abrasive and coarsely spoken to patrons as I had my bags on my laps clicking away on my phone to check-in both Yelp and FB when one shined her flash light on me to instruct me to clear off bags from aisles.  My bags are on my lap and I arrived 2:15PM when the curtain rises at 3PM!!  Woman, do you have eyes that my bags are NOT blocking the aisles as they are visibly on my lap?  My seat is not by the stupid aisle!!Note:  Arrive fifteen minutes beforehand to settle in and locate your seats and use facilities.  Coat room is available in the winter months, however in the interest of time I rather hold onto my jacket for a quick exit.",3,1,
44,Jennifer N.,"Chantilly, VA",456,334,317,3.0,9/28/2015,"I went to the Ambassador Theatre over the weekend to watch Chicago, which was simply AMAZING. The musical was pure perfection, especially with Rumer Willis playing the role of Roxie. The theatre itself, however; was a bit short of amazing.  Okay, pretty far from amazing.  The size of the place isn't an issue to me.  I actually enjoyed the small stage and room because it pretty much ensured a great view no more where you sat.  My family and I purchased seats on the mezzanine to the far right facing the stage. Row B, Seats 2, 4, 6, 8. We had a great view of the show and were able to see all the facial expressions of the actors.  The lighting and sound were also great. Had no issue seeing or hearing the performance. The seats themselves were the main issue. These small seats were horrible!! Super uncomfortable and tiny. I basically elbowed my sister during the entire show.  I'm a small girl and my elbows were still way over the arm rests.  Apologies to the stranger sitting to my right that I elbowed and bumped legs more than once. I'm 5'2"" and hardly had any leg room.  Good luck to anyone trying to get through people to use the bathroom during the show.  Also, good luck to anyone taller than 5'5"". I know this theatre is old, but damn.If I were just rating the Chicago musical - it would be a 5 stars for sure!  But this review is for the venue itself.  A plus is that the actors come out after the show (by the entrance) and sign autographs and take pictures! I was able to snag a selfie with Rumer, which was a great surprise!",2,1,1

We were greeted at the box office by a woman with a warm smile who expeditiously provided us with our tickets and directed us to skip the line and walk right in. What service!The theater was much smaller and unimpressive than other theaters I've been to, but, hey, can't judge a book by its cover.. Chicago was fantastic! The bar was quite small and the service a little slow, but the bartenders were friendly and playful. I was comfortable in my seat and found that the grade to the stage made it easy for all 5'1'' of me to see the whole show without constantly looking around heads. PLUS! However, the seats were a little stiff.This is the only theater I haven't used the restroom in, but judging by the bar layout, I had a feeling it was going to be a similar experience. There is not a lot of aisle or walking room and I didn't want to get caught in the stampede.Overall I had a good experience.

It was ridiculous- this crazy woman actually interrupted the very last number, the finale at the end of the show to tell my husband to turn his phone off. Obviously she had no idea that we are supersensitive to messages right now as my sister is nine months pregnant and about to go into labor as well as the fact that we own our own business and are always looking at our phones to make sure that everything is OK while we are away. I found it absolutely disgusting the way she talked to my husband. It wasn't a plate question to turn off his phone, obviously as it was the last five minutes of the entire show. It was at this nasty crazy man yelling at us and the last two rows of the theater. I've never seen anything like it! However, the actual show was absolutely amazing, we loved it!! I'm embarrassed to say that this one woman almost completely ruined the entire experience because of her inteurruptance to tell us that my husband couldn't even look at his phone, even if it was only 10 seconds.

It was def not like the movie which I expected it to be somewhat similar. They def had a shocker moment at the end, will not say it in case you are interested in watching it, I found it to be really cool. I also thought Velma's dancing performance looked a bit lazy and tiring.As soon as you come in there's an usher waiting outside scanning tickets, all ushers were polite except for one in the mezzanine area who kept on yelling not to use your phone or camera to record any performance. The bathroom line for woman was outrageous & the only price I know of a snack was the M&M bc someone asked $5. The seats were uncomfortable i'm pretty tall and I had to put my legs outside in the isle. Would recommend the show to someone who hasn't seen the movie to watch it first.",2,,1

Unfortunately (only in this instance), my life revolves around food and I couldn't just feed her all weekend. A coworker suggested buying TKTS for a show. My mom was a huge fan of the movie Chicago, so it made our choice very easy. The price tag was a little steeper than I expected, but when we arrived at the theater, it was apparent why: we had aisle seats only 10 rows from the front. TKTS seats are not only discounted, but they're great discounted seats.The show itself was so much fun. The cast did a great job with the numbers. The strange thing about this show is that the orchestra is on stage and the sets and costumes never change. If you're bad at following plays and musicals, this is going to be a problem because everyone wears the same costume throughout. Other than that, the singing's amazing and the company did a phenomenal job. My favorite scene was definitely the court room; great use of lighting and the singing was on par.To address the bathrooms, you literally need to dash out of your seat right at intermission.

I got pretty good seats on the main bottom floor. The theatre doesnt seem too big though so honestly any seat on the main orchestra floor would be good/close enough. Can't say about the balcony though since I did not go up there. My 5 stars is mostly for the actual show and that the small theatre allowed for many good/close enough seats.",1,,

Seats are extremely cramped. My friend that saw the show with me is slightly over 5 foot and hundred pounds. she felt cramped and so did I. Make sure you use the restroom before the show starts and don't drink anything during the show. during intermission and after the show the line for the ladies room was 20 deep.ushers failed to control rude patrons. A couple in front of me was talking during the show and looking at a phone. I waited a good 20 minutes and no one told them to quiet down and put away their phone. It really distracted from the show and was disappointing. They were utterly clueless even when I said out loud, I hate it when people talk and look at their phones during shows .Chicago was a great play. It could be amazing in the right venue.

The show was stupendous. Chicago the Musical is worth seeing. Tonight's the final night to see the show with Brandy as Roxie Hart. Brandy is a talented vocalist and was perfectly cast as Roxie. During the show, I experienced a gamut of emotions.Whenever I visit again, I plan to see another production and possibly even see something at the Public Theater nearby. Loved every moment and the cherry on top was meeting Brandy after the show. It was a wonderful publicity move for the singer. Lupita Nyong'o is debuting sometime this year at Public. Ambassador is a gem. I've yet to experience the other venue. But, will likely come back for Lupita. As someone who has worked in the industry, I'm aware of how hard it is for black actors and actresses to get cast in certain roles. Diversity is a must have for modern-day casts.

When I walked in I didn't think much to the attitude of the staff but their relentlessly insistent tones and bossiness shone through when they would hassle tourists who would be taking pictures of each other during the intermission to turn their cameras/phones off, sit down and behave. When the show (was was perfectly fantastic) ended again people began to photograph each other which led to the staff yelling at people ""get out! No photos! You need to exit now!"" shining torches at them (not necessary in a lit room) Kinda felt like you were no longer welcome as they had your money now.Note* If you're looking to see Chicago do try another theatre if possible because it is a brilliant show, it is simply the venue I had a problem with, if you can't see it anywhere else then do brave the place, but make sure you have a hefty amount of money and a large tolerance for rude staff.",2,1,
59,Alexander L.,"Brooklyn, NY",342,386,79,2.0,12/27/2012,"This review is strictly for the theater; and not the musical.There are a bunch of old Broadway theaters where the measurements for seating are snug to say the least. I could also understand that for the room that they're left with, finding better seats would be difficult (or perhaps they're trying to hold onto that rustic look) but for shows that go on for more than an hour, it's hard to find yourself comfortable. For people with back problems, these will likely cause you discomfort as mine was sore by the end of the show.The lines for bathrooms I would say are expected, but it would have been nice if the theater had at least 1 more set of bathrooms. In general, I'd say, ""go before you enter the theater and try to do without beverages because the wait for bathrooms will be long at intermission"".Overall it's hard to enjoy a show if you're uncomfortable for most of it.

65,XxXx X.,"Matawan, NJ",0,24,0,2.0,2/15/2016,"This review is strictly for the Mezzanine seating area and the play in general. Seating: Let me begin by saying that if you had your legs blown off in 'Nam or an unfortunate smelting accident (and happen to have a waist thinner than the circumference of a pencil) this is the theater for you! Never have I wished to be a paraplegic more than while I was miserably stuck in these sad excuse for seats. There is maybe half-a-centimeter of ""leg room,"" while on the horizontal spectrum you feel like Augustus Gloop from Willy Wonka when he gets sucked through the compression tube. Made for an extremely awkward and body-twisting experience that was only exacerbated by the numerous amount of a**holes that decide to use the restroom during the show and make the entire row rise and contortion their bodies like they were in a Picasso painting while everyone behind them is blocked from viewing the show. Repeated upon their return. I've been to many Broadway shows in other theaters--both in orchestra seats and the nose bleeds--and nowhere have I been less comfortable than at the Ambassador Theater.The Show:We saw Chicago, which was very disappointing. The whole play screamed ""budget cuts!"" Save the acting (which, aside from the amazing band, was the only redeeming quality of the show), the entire performance was enacted without a set and WITHOUT COSTUME CHANGES! For a play based on an era where fashion was of paramount priority and importance, it was extremely disappointing to see no variance in the wardrobes of the actors for the entire length of the show. Now, I admire minimalism, but only when it is warranted. With a show such as this, it is definitely not. It felt like the Costume Director was forced to leave his/her job at the Goodwill Store, grabbed a few things on the way out, and made to stop at an S&M shop on the way to the theater. The cast was comprised of maybe fifteen people--all of whom played different characters, despite having been killed off in the previous scene--and they all sat on chairs on the side of the stage for the duration of the play, rising only to perform their mechanical function before returning. I always give the play the benefit of the doubt, but there was no doubt here that the movie made this performance look like someone's backyard production in the redneck hills of Virginia. Sure the actors could dance. Sure Eddie George was great. Sure they could all sing. But those are requirements of ANY play that charges more than $10 per seat. We paid $150 in all and left feeling molested. Kinda put a damper on our Valentine's Day...My point being: save your money, sit back and relax on your comfortable living room couch with your family, and enjoy ""Chicago"" the only way you can. Watch the movie.",2,1,1

68,Eric W.,"East Bay, CA",580,451,430,2.0,5/10/2012,"Ambassador seems like it might have been an awesome theatre to catch a show in days of yore, but has definitely seen better times. The favorite Yelper and I caught Chicago starring Christie Brinkley, and although that itself was decently enjoyable, the venue was not quite up to snuff.First off, the seats are extremely tiny. Now, I understand that the size of the average American has increased tremendously over the past few decades, but even I - a relatively normal sized Asian male - still felt like a canned sardine. Even worse is trying to get in and out, as the leg space is less ample than on the crappiest airline you have ever had the pleasure of being tortured on. If your section is in the very middle, and the spaces on the side have already started to fill up, good luck trying to run through the gauntlet that makes American Gladiators look like a bunch of pansies.However, the absolute, most glaring black mark against Ambassador is undoubtedly the ridiculously insufficient number of restrooms. Literally, there are three urinals and one toilet stall in the men's room (can't say for sure about the women's, as I had not entered), and true to form, it is CRAMPED. For a Broadway show, with hundreds of paying customers, this is far less than acceptable. If you don't have an exceptionally large bladder, and actually have to use the restroom during intermission, be prepared to miss a good chunk of the second half.The line at intermission was out the door, and down a flight of stairs... for the men's! I can only imagine the pain and suffering the women had to endure. By the time the second act had begun, almost half of the seats were still empty! When you are finally able to return, worst of all is having to run that American Gladiators gauntlet... in the dark.Here is a word of advice. If there is a show you desperately want to see, and really have no back up plan in mind, perhaps at that point, you could give the Ambassador a shot. If you are on the fence, and find out that something in particular is playing at the Ambassador, I'd suggest you go to plan B.",20,20,19
69,Iliana P.,"Irving, TX",0,4,0,5.0,11/27/2015,"Love it love it!!!! This theatre is where Chicago the musical is held at, I can't believe the great customer service we received from the people in the front. So my sister and I had a little mix up on the tickets and Jimmy in the front helped us out big time! He upgraded our seats because of a problem we had with our tickets! We were never expecting that!! This kind deed really made me love NYC more! Thanks jimmy",1,,
70,Meridith H.,"Chicago, IL",28,296,80,3.0,3/24/2013,"Perks:Not a bad seat in the house. We got rush tickets, so sat all the way in back, but nevertheless had a great view of the stage. The sound was great, too.When the show is over, getting back to the street is quick & convenient.Pains:At intermission, the line for the ladies restroom stretches almost to the stage; inadequate restrooms are never forgivable.The seats are tiny; prepare to literally rub elbows with your neighbors and to fold your legs into unnatural positions during the show.",,,
71,Andrea B.,"Arlington, MA",670,519,457,2.0,2/29/2012,"I'm going to start this review with an important piece of advice if you're seeing a play at the Ambassador Theater - do not get tickets for the front row of the mezzanine. ""But why not?"" you ask. And you're right to inquire, because the aforementioned seats offer a really great, entirely unobstructed view of whichever spectacular show happens to be playing.  But I'll tell you why you mustn't sit there. There is no leg room, at all. Let me make this clear - all of the seating was pretty cramped.  The front row of the mezzanine was just especially so.  To give you a better idea, I'm a fairly petite 5'2"", and my knees were bumping up against the railing. So you can only imagine how my 5'10"" brother was feeling.  Now, maybe people were a bit smaller about 90 years ago when this theater first opened, but the spacing of the seating just doesn't suffice anymore.That aside, I saw Chicago here, and it was spectacular - so good that I was almost able to forget that I was practically sitting on top of my neighbors. The theater itself is dingy and could use a good bit of renovating.  The Ambassador Theater is old, and it has that old, historical feel to it, but there comes a point when a little modernization needs to happen.",2,,
72,Vina O.,"Downers Grove, IL",515,726,23,1.0,5/30/2012,"Horrible theatre! I'm 5'2"" and I was totally cramped in my seat!  There is NO leg room whatsoever! I have no clue how anyone over 5'10"" can actually fit in a seat. I was so uncomfortable the entire time I was watching Chicago that I pretty much never want to see a Broadway show here ever again.",1,,
73,Tom R.,"Camarillo, CA",18,11,0,1.0,12/27/2011,"Our family went to see Chicago on Christmas night. After we stood in line to get in a woman shouted at us (everyone going in) at the top of her lungs as how to enter, which did not require instructions. She may as well had a cattle prod as it was that irritating.The poor women who had to use the restroom were forced to stand in line for a very long time. I could not believe how long the line was.Everything around the stage was covered with a thick layer of dust. It looked as though it had not had a good cleaning in years.I ordered a cocktail and a very small bottle of water. I am by no means cheap, but the tab was $30.00 for this.The play was good but the poor condition of the venue and attitude of the staff made it a poor experience. I could not wait to get out of there.",2,,

75,Iris L.,"Claremont, CA",87,6,1,4.0,1/12/2014,Saw chicago for $37 with student rush tickets. For my first broadway show I can say I was not disappointed! The dancing was fantastic and the staff were very hospitable. Coat check for $2 per piece and they checked my luggage (came directly off a flight) without a problem. Ushers let 4 of us sit in better seats than our tickets said and for $37 balcony seating was great. Could hear and see everything very well.,1,,
76,Christine C.,"Los Angeles, CA",433,496,38,4.0,1/3/2011,"Like others, I had the pleasure of seeing Chicago here with a friend. I had scored some decent mezzanine tickets from the TKTS booth at Times Square. Theatre is very squishy as expected with its age, but cozy. Seats and aisles are very narrow and cramped. But the fixtures and architecture were still very nice. Sightlines were decent even from the corners, and to be expected for theatres, anyway.Also, I had one of the most OCD panicked ushers ever, as she mistakenly assigned people the wrong seats and kept shuffling them. In NYC style she had little patience for people that clearly didn't know what they were doing, but from my angle it was quite comedic. Otherwise, I didn't have any problems with the venue staffers itself.",1,,1
77,Nina B.,"Norman, OK",56,204,183,4.0,7/21/2013,"We watched Chicago in this theatre. The theatre itself is lovely. There are many intricate details on the ceiling. The chairs are comfy. It's conveniently located to many restaurants. I'd go back to the theatre. However, Chicago was not so great, and I've seen it before. I sometimes couldn't understand/hear the performers. The choreography was off. I'm no critic, but I feel that if you pay that much for a ticket, you should get a good show.",,,
78,jordan r.,"Englewood, NJ",117,71,4,3.0,6/15/2013,"Came here to see my favorite band Five Iron Frenzy. There is a cool downstairs lounge, but the performing area is nothing to special. Some seats with more standing room. Decent acoustics though",,,
79,Thomas K.,"Rutherford, NJ",78,525,413,3.0,1/9/2011,"We saw Chicago here, at this old gem of a theater.  While it may be a piece of Broadway history, it could use a bit of restoring, maybe even updating...especially the cramped seating.The sound was pretty good.  The show, however, was great enough that you soon forgot about the seating.  But, then again, I won't go on about the show...as this review is about the joint it was performed in!",,,
80,Catina C.,"Milwaukee, WI",108,18,0,1.0,3/28/2012,"Had front row seats so I had leg room however had to elbow wrestle for positioning on the arm rest...thank God for intermission and not having to go to the bathroom because I was able to take the arm rest.

85,Vincent P.,"Farmingdale, NY",0,1,0,1.0,9/16/2014,"I took my girlfriend out to see Chicago ( which was amazing) coming from someone who is not a big fan of musicals I was pleasantly suprised. The downfall comes from the staff members who treat the viewers as lambs being lead to a slaughter,  I can not describe how rude each staff member was to everyone. Me and my girlfriend found our seats with the helpful guide of a disgruntled staff member who shoved the playbill into our hands, we then proceeded to our ""assigned"" seats for a couple minutes only to be met with a ""hey you guys, what seat numbers do your tickets say"". When I told the lady what the tickets said she said ""oh really? , let me see those tickets"" as if she was accusing us of something. She then pointed out that we were in the wrong seats and needed to move up one row. Then came the end of the show, immediately staff members were yelling at people to leave. ""People on the top rows you need to leave now"" and then a ""excuse me,  you need to leave now"". Me and my girlfriend then witnessed tourists taking pictures of eachother only to be screamed at saying ""No more pictures it's time to leave"". Highly disappointed in the staff of this theatre, a lesson in civility would sure help these people in the future.  I apologize for the long rant this is my first review I just needed to write about my experience hopefully your experience was better than mine.",1,1,
86,Bella A.,"San Francisco, CA",125,339,24,5.0,12/12/2008,"It was my first time at the Ambassador Theatre. I love the fact that it's huge! It's grand, sophisticated and good enough to greet an ambassador. Too bad it's slightly off Broadway but hey Usher was there playing Billy Flynn so everybody was happy! Given the fact that the theatre was built in the twenties I won't complain about leg room or long queue in the bathroom. The intermission was long enough to let everybody gets that relief and back in the auditorium in time before the show resumed. Even the modern cinema or IMAX do not give you any more leg room if you must know. For me, I visit old theatre just to feel how it was like back in the days. It is part of the adventure and experience. I like it inside the auditorium, it's huge and spacious; we got good seats so there were no complain of a tall person in front blocking the view. I give 5 stars because I sat through the whole performance enjoying the show thoroughly which is what good service a theatre provides for its patron.",,1,1
87,Charles C.,"New York, NY",314,68,0,2.0,3/8/2011,"Rather dingy and creaky. Saw Chicago here. Chicago the show was pretty awesome, but unfortunately the theater disappointed. There is only one tiny mens and womens bathroom for the whole mezzanine level, so prepare for a long line during intermission.

88,S. H.,"New York, NY",12,31,5,3.0,9/29/2009,"I went here on 7/12/08 to see Chicago. Mya was supposed to be starring in this production. I read somewhere she was injured and couldn't perform. I was a little disappointed at first. But the show was great. The actors are very talented and have amazing toned bodies. The theatre is small, the bathrooms are very small only 4-5 stalls, and the line was insanely long. I bought twizzlers there for $4, kinda expensive but the pack was pretty big. Some of the staff that works there looks pretty questionable like they are apart of a work release program or something. The stage is very small, you can see the performers sitting on chairs on the side (the wings I guess it's called) waiting for there moment to go on stage. Other than that I had fun and was very entertained.",1,3,1
89,Nancy M.,"Seattle, WA",120,183,147,2.0,3/17/2012,"Two major complaints from my visit this past week.  1) I felt like I was seated in an airplane...that's how cramped the seats are.   The seats are so narrow that you'll have to do the same shoulder shuffle that you have to do on a plane to figure out a way to sit without knocking into your neighbor.  Leg room was also lacking, but not quite as bad as on a plane.  You have to get up though to let people through, there is no way around that.  2) There is only one men's restroom and one women's restroom for the entire theatre.  If you have to pee at intermission you had better run your ass to the restroom or you will not get back in time for the second act.  The line literally goes down two flights of stairs and then some.  And the line only forms up one staircase, so  if you happen to be seated near the other staircase on the main level (like I was) you're screwed.  It's just not a very comfortable theatre.  I have nothing against the show though, Chicago was wonderful!",,,

The stage/playhouse was very small, the seats were uncomfortable and the entire theater looked very old and run-down.

Er, sorry, theatres.It's been a few years since I went to see Topdog/Underdog, but I remember a nice, very large just-off-broadway theatre with a great show. No, there was no incredible beauty in the up-above, like some great theatres I've known, but here're the big questions: was I comfortable to pay attention to the show; the acoustics; the view. We were up towards the nosebleed, and I had a fine view and heard every last word, though not always the feeling in the actors' voices. That's important, and  on such counts it passes. I also don't recall any particular discomfort, and was able to keep my focus on the stage, not to distress over the leg room or seat. But this isn't a community theatre, so I think I should judge it rather harshly, thanks to the price and location.",,,
92,P X.,"Minnetonka, MN",16,271,3,3.0,9/7/2010,"We scored two amazing tickets for Chicago and headed over to the Ambassador Theatre to enjoy the show.  The theatre itself is quaint, but a bit outdated. The bathrooms are all upstairs (which made it hard to use before and during the show) and the walkways are not designed for groups of people hustling to the concession stand during intermission. The sound quality is really great and there is an intimate nature to the theater that makes it enjoyable.",,,
