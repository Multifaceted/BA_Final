1,Phil R.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,2/2/2018,"I rarely ever write reviews, but I have never been treated so poorly as I have tonight. I have gone to Barracuda for years; countless shows, countless happy hours. This was home away from home and I never stopped for a second to recommend to it to anyone new to or visiting New York.I was denied entry for being ""intoxicated"". Beside the point that I wasn't and I was given multiple additional excuses for being denied entry such as ""swaying"" (find me a gay who doesn't sway), I was refused time to talk honestly with a manager who basically said that the bouncers could do whatever they wanted, even though I have been a loyal patron for years, and now I'm done. I will never go back to Barracuda, and this upsets me greatly because it used to be one of my favorite places and somewhere I always thought of as my home away from home.",4,2,1

We were approached by this man with angry-looking, arched eyebrows as sharp as daggers and rock solid slicked hair. Well I'll be! It was Joshua McKinley, from Project Runway and two All Stars seasons, who I guess works as a bartender there? As a longtime fan of the show, I expressed my genuine excitement and told him how much I loved him and his designs on the show. I don't know if he's so cynical of his time on the show that he thought I was being sarcastic, or just ashamed of being sighted, but suddenly he's kicking me out. I was confused... why am I being escorted out by this bouncer, budget Action Bronson? He was in on it, telling us he was on All Stars. Uh, okay? Needless to say, I'm not going back, and if Mr McKinley wants to work somewhere where nobody will ever know his name, he should try a department store instead. Xoxo",,1,

My covered with a napkin and $15 paid for drink was removed from the bar when I complained I got my drink back from someone at the bar but when my friend told me he saw them pour ginger ale and tonic in my drink rather than replace it with what I paid $15 for, we complained and josh yelled at me and my friend, snatched AND scratched the drink from my hand and threw $10 at my friends head AND TOLD US TO LEAVE BECAUSE WE DIDNT TRUST HIS POUR. I'm sorry, if I'm watching you pour me a cheap ass drink when I originally paid extra for a real drink I think I have the right to complain.

She said with some enthusiasm. I was skeptical if barracuda had outlived its hey day, having not heard much buzz about it in recent times from my friends.The place was dark except for a red glow and vacant except for the bar top which provided a sort of mysterious borderline eerie early 80s quiet calm, with at least one cute boy sitting on his stool ass out in a way that advertised.$8 drinks translated into $4 with the happy hour discount, the bar patrons and muscular tattooed bartender were neighborhood friendly and the bars unprentitous artsy style slightly elevated its dive bar status.Barracuda might be under the radar, which comes as a bonus, especially if you can catch the buy one get one happy hour.  The sniff of a more lively and scandalous past was evident, but barracudas flame still glows.",16,9,14

I know most of the drag queens and bartenders that worked there for the past 3 years. But yesterday I ordered a drink for 9$ (tequila shot with lime) and when I ordered again the other bar tender charged me 11$ when I told him the other bartender charged me 9$ he asked him and said I never served him before, they accused me of lying for no reason. I came again to order a drink he told me something wired ""I looked at u and smiled at you but you didnt"" I was like what do you mean?, Then he called the security to kick me out. I am always polite and respectful to any place I go, the previous bartenders and drag queens know me well and knows that I don't cause any troubles. As a customer, I deserve a better service and treatment. Not because he's the Bartender he have the privilege to treat people rude and kick them out for no reason, he kicked out many guys that night too and he's gonna be a bad business for this bar.

With touches of elegance, this could easily be one of my favorite bars in NYC. Walking up, this bar could be unassuming. We had to ask if we were in the right place, but it turns out we were. The bar area is situated right when you walk in, so it could get a bit crowded, but once you find a spot, stay there and drink up. The drinks are decent and the crowd is fun. If you walk to the back, there's a huge lounge area if you need a more comfortable place to sit.The bathrooms, however, need some cleaning and maintenance. There's piss on the ground and paper towels littering the ground. Clean up please!I didn't stay long, but overall, I really like this bar and would definitely return.

22,Mike N.,"Manhattan, NY",73,215,0,5.0,1/13/2016,"One of my favorite bars in New York, and it's not just because I live in the neighborhood! It's vibrant, yet casual. It's sophisticated, yet a little wild. Chatty, friendly bartenders. Strong drinks. I've had some of my most fun memories as a New York resident inside the walls of this bar. It's pretty unassuming from the outside and is actually below an actual (higher end) apartment building on 22nd St (b/w 7th and 8th Ave). The front is the actual bar, with a few high-top tables to stand at, then a wide hallway leads towards the back lounge area where there is a (covered) pool table, some large couches/seats, and a mini-stage where there are occasionally drag shows, but really it's just a spot for you and your friends to drunkenly dance and make a fool of yourselves.Also: Have seen both Andy Cohen and Jonathan Groff at this bar more than once!

23,Evian D.,"New York, NY",409,239,432,4.0,1/27/2016,"Cheap drinks, divey bar, almost a bit seedy just cause the main colors are black and red. They place is actually pretty big with one Main bar, and a back room dance /lounge area. This place attracts a mixed crowd of people, but all most are pretty chill. Never rally been here when people are dancing. There is a big pool table in the back as well, but I am not even sure people can ply on it, as there is always a big wood cover over it, so I guess it's converted to a table for putting drinks on. This bar is similar to XES (which is closing soon) so I could see a lot of the costumes coming here next. Their happy hour includes 2x1 drinks. The drinks here are also pretty inexpensive, maybe cause they don't take cards and only method of payment is cash. Bathrooms are spacious and one of the bathrooms is an individual stall for anyone that is a bit shy or needs their privacy. This is actually also the only reason why I don't give them 5 stars. Having cash on you when drinking is dangerous. At least that's what I tell myself, but more dangerous is ordering rounds of drinks and then finding out you do not have enough cash and need to use an arm with bank fees to pay for a round that has been sitting in ice for a bit. Just think about it... Bring cash if you plan to stick here for a while!Great bartenders, always offer conversation if not too busy. The entrance has a small room so the cold air stays out.

Seriously, I bought a drink and right before I could pay, a drunken Andy Cohen came over and asked the bar tender for a shot. The bar tender was way too distracted to take my money even after I waved my $20 bill in his face 7 (I counted) times. I guess I just can't compete with Andy Cohen......This place is alright. It's small and the bathroom is unisex. When I was here, they just played CD's which I guessed saved them the expense of hiring a DJ.

I totally get that but it could've been said to me in a kinder way that didn't make me feel like an idiot and create a big scene.

However, what he said after that was despicable and uncalled for.  When he rudely answered us, my friend said ""Oh ok. Our friend who is visiting was just asking, he didn't know"".  Joshua said ""I need to see his visa to get a drink.""  We laughed because we thought he was joking, but then he continued saying that we needed to get used to it because it's going to be like this for the next 4 years.  Wow!!

Some are friendlier then others but that's OK because even in the late evening when it gets crowded I never have to wait long for a drink. Very quick.

Updated review","I was in here last night for a little post-Pride imbibing.  They were not charging a cover, a good sign already.  There not no seat available around 6PM but thankfully a little later there was.  I ordered an Absolut with soda and lime. I got my drink but it was an Absolut and Seven-up which is fine too.   And it was served in a real glass which was another plus. All the while I was sitting at the bar, the bartender was attentive and professional which is no easy task on the day of the Manhattan Pride parade.",,,

I've been doing a pre-weekend there on Thursdays: it's a drag show with a pretty funny host/dj. It was a contest and there are a lot of hot guys in the audience, the drag queen is obviously racist and even called one contestant a gorilla (ha ha). This place is great because everyone who comes in is cool - even the blacks and asians just laugh and don't say anything. They serve stiff drinks too and the bartenders are sexy.

We walked in at about 10:30 and there was probably right around 15 people there.. By 11:15 the place was PACKED! Bob the Drag Queen was performing that night and she was HILARIOUS.

Inside, though, it's a cross between pretty gay boys and dive bar. II'm so not into drag but apparently this is the place for that if you're into it (and I'm not judging you if it is!).

I was not happy.Synopsis: From my drunken stupor, this is what I could recall of the whole night.  Pretty decent because I loved the shows that were being performed, although I just wish the night didn't end.  The environment seemed clean and the people were nice.  Even though I probably didn't look New-Yorky, the drags allowed me to take pictures with them. YES!  Will I ever return, probably not.  The experience was over-all awesome and if this was going to be earlier in the night, I would go here.  I love dancing!!! I rather dance than watch people who can't dance better than me, dance.  And if you doubt me, you haven't seen me dance! Environment: The bar is definitely a hole in the wall, but I could tell it was a drag entrance due to all the queens that were chatting outside, smoking their cigarettes.  I don't recall a sign, but once in, I saw that the place was a rectangular prism. Seemed more like a long walkway with décor. In the back, there was a stage with numerous framed pictures.  Comfortable sofas, circular tables.  It was definitely a nice place to be in.Employees: I didn't order any drinks...just got offered one.  Club soda....I want to be able to recall some things so I can yelp it...The drag queens were pretty awesome.  Two in particular were doing a duo and it was amazing.  YES!  High-five to that.People:  The people were very nice and filled with energy.  People yelling.  People were saving seats for their friends, but they allowed me and my family friend to sit for the time-being until their friends arrived.  YES!   Drinks: Didn't order anything but club soda. What a waste...now that I think about it, especially if it is wasn't going to be on my dime...",1,1,1

It's not too packed, and the music isn't so loud that you can't chat with your mates. They also have reasonably priced drinks, a great 2-for-1 Happy Hour, and friendly bartenders. I hear on some nights they have really good drag shows, too, so I'll definitely be returning to catch one some time soon!",3,1,1

64,Keith S.,"Manhattan, NY",16,7,0,4.0,5/15/2011,"So, not even gonna lie, I'm a bit biased.  This is a bar I like to call ""my Cheers.""  I'd list who I come here with, but I consistently force everyone I know that I drink with to meet me here.  I can be found here at just about every happy hour.This place is way cruisy, but if you set your Blaster shields to ""blind"" (like I do) then you'll never notice.  Well, until somebody invades your personal space.  Make up a story about a jealous boyfriend or something.This place gets crowded on weekend nights.  Like, accidental groping crowded.  I'm not sure how many people actually take groups here on those nights anyways (re: cruising.)  But other nights it's not so crowded as to put a dampener on your drink ordering.  The bar staff is friendly, but not so much as to be distracted.  There are a lot of regulars, all of whom are nice.  The music can be ear splitting late at night, but who needs meaningful conversation when everybody is doing strip shows with their eyes?  Drink pricing is so-so, but there's a 2-4-1 most days until 9, Sundays until midnight.The tables in the front are akwardly placed and take up valuable standing space, but the couches in the back are great.  Just expect to see somebody making out on one of them.  There's a pool table, but it's normally used as a place to sit during drag shows and I've never seen it without plywood over it.  Speaking of, the drag shows are flat out hilarious.  It's Sherry Vine on Sunday, Peppermint on Mondays, Karaoke Tuesdays (with Eve Starr,) Dallas Dubois on Wednesdays (fave,) and Mimi Imfurst doing a star search on Thursdays.  Drag is late, come early if you want a couch seat.",1,1,1
65,Ryan D.,"Nashua, NH",264,358,64,5.0,3/25/2011,"Barracuda is one of those places that I looked around and wondered, ""Have I been here before?"" You need to remember that in the early days of hanging out with Scott B. he and his motley crew would hit up 4 or 5 bars a night. This left with a general sense of, ""I don't even know where I am AT ALL!""With that said, it's possible that I had never been here before last week.Brian S. (who is now FINALLY 21) knows a guy who works here named Josh. Now, this guy Josh is kind of awesome. There were two bartenders there that night - one queen who thought he was prettier than he actually was and a really nice Brazilian guy with an ironic t-shirt. I'm sure if you were there, you could tell which one was giving you an attitude.It was all in good fun, though. I think it was like a Tuesday night I was there (so it was more like two weeks ago) but they were doing karaoke. This is one of those places where people are so good it's actually kind of intimidating to put your name in. But the drinks were cheap, the people were nice, and I can definitely imagine myself going back here.",1,1,

We got tired of the hustle and bustle of the front room, where it felt like everyone was just undressing each other with their eyes, overly-eager to rip their clothes off at a moment's notice. So we went to the back lounge room and grabbed a couch. Little did we know how perfect our timing was. Within 20 minutes, drag queen extraordinaire Sherry Vine came on stage and gave an amazing performance. I was in stitches the entire time.The second time was last night. A friend and I walked here after catching the 7:30 show at Upright Citizen's Brigade. Granted, it was a Sunday night, but it was very sparsely populated. That's fine and I actually liked being able to get a table, but I didn't like shelling out $14 for a glass of red wine and a gin & tonic, considering how dead the place was. Next time we go, we'll make sure there's a drag show. It really is what makes this place great (and the drink prices acceptable).",,,

The guy who was doing nothing but waiting for the restroom, got unfairly pushed by one of the security guards who suspected he was doing something wrong in the bathroom. The guy was tipsy yes, and in his own defense, responded something back. But seriously he ended up been treated like a dog. How ugly to see a gay guy being treated so badly at a gay bar.

No real dancefloor so I don't recommend coming here to get yo freak on.Oh and the front area gets incredibly crowded. A little too crowded for my tastes. But whatever go to the back or the middle.

We arrived a bit before the show and were able to snag great sofa seats, but the place filled up quickly with a crowd ready to have fun. I may or may not have been a little loud in my commentary of what was going on on stage (all in good humor- I'm no heckler) and was good naturedly called out by the MC. There was never a real line at the bar, but the cute waiter who kept visiting our table to check on us made that irrelevant. The drinks were a little pricey ($9/beer) but when you're having so much fun, it's all the easier to spend a bit more. Overall, it was good times I won't mind repeating!

It was in bad taste for even the most tragic drag queen. I have never seen a bunch of queers turn so fast.

There are tables and chairs where there shouldnt be. You're constantly brushing and pokin people to move and steppin on their high tops. I think that's how they like it though. I believe gay bars like to keep us close and keep us on the edge of drama and conflict with other people we do not know.Keep on poking through the crowd and in the back you will find a small stage that looks straight up out of Connie & Carla. However back here are were the lesbians and nell bottoms chill and dance to 'It's my life' - thanks Gwen. There are some nice comfy couches there and some airplane terminal lounge chairs fluttered about and everyone is sippin their 9 dollar cocktails.Stop by if you're a local",1,,
95,Sab S.,"Chester, MA",0,15,0,4.0,7/9/2011,"So I went to this place last night (Friday evening) to meet up with a friend before heading on to another place for another friend's birthday party. I was a bit nervous going in because A) its a gay bar B) I was by myself, and you combine those two factors and you have C) Lots of weird guys hitting on you. I went in and the place was not super crowded. It was just the right amount of people for you to mingle, move around, make a few friends, and also be able to breathe and have a good time with your own friends. No one likes a super quite and empty bar anyways.The crowd was a mixture of all kinds. There were some young guys, some late 20's to mid thirties guys, some middle aged men and then some grandpas who needed a stick to walk. I will say one thing though, they could have been better looking. My friend was not there yet so I walked around the bar (Which I always do just to scope out a place when I am there for the first time) and decided I'm gonna sit at the bar. It wasn't super crowded so I got a seat relatively easily and the bartenders weren't super friendly but they were also not rude. They were just quite and kinda kept to themselves.  However, they were attentive and got people their drinks very quickly. The drinks were cheap and also strong so that was definitely a plus point.You do have people looking at you. I tried to keep myself busy with my phone till my friend got there, but every time I looked up there was a guy looking which I guess is not bad. Its a gay bar and one thats quite cruise-y so whatever... that was expected. I guess if you are looking to hookup or make friends then that works for you.My friend couldn't make it so I left after 20 minutes but within those 20 minutes I got a great feeling from the place. People were having a good time, laughing, enjoying, drinking... It was nice! I saw groups of friends, saw single people hooking up, saw people like myself sitting by themselves just enjoying the whole atmosphere.One star less for just a few things though. The bouncer was pissssssss drunk! He could not remain seated on the stool he was sitting on and kept falling off. He missed my arm 3 times while trying to stamp my wrist. Not good! Also, the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting (Which I guess, without, no bar in NYC would be complete)Overall, nice place. Go alone if you want to hook up I guess but definitely go with friends to have more fun.",,,

Sold!... The front area is a good place to sit at the bar or stand at the tables and talk with friends. The back area is a good place to play pool (when the table isn't covered) and enjoy the music (which varies from pretty good to just alright, but it's never bad) -- there are usually shows in the back room, usually drag (which is not my thing), but it's a very comfortable cozy area...

109,Austin M.,"Dallas, TX",134,135,62,4.0,1/21/2009,"I came here once when I was visiting my (now ex) boyfriend in New York. I was only 19 years old at the time I got in, but my ex-boyfriend got me in, and the people didn't even card me, ahah, insane! The inside is pretty nice, and the whole vibe is very laid back. A lot of good looking guys are there, and everyone is pretty nice for the most part. I'm not crazy about public PDA though (gays and straights alike), but I guess it comes with the territory. The music was pretty good, but I don't really like listening to techno and electronic music all that much, which they play a lot. I prefer top 40 music, you know, popular music people actually listen to, lol, call me unoriginal, whatever. My ex is a bartender, so I got free drinks, which was pretty rad, but I don't really drink alcohol, so it's no big deal. Well, I live in Newport Beach, CA, so I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon, but it was an overall enjoyable experience, lol. P.S. - The highlight of my night was when a very horny guy came up to me and my boyfriend at the bar. Me and my boyfriend were talking, and he comes up to us and this is how it went, HILAR! Mr. Horny: So, are you guys like, together ? Austin: Why, yes, yes we are. Mr. Horny: Ohhh, aren't you a little young to be dating him ? My ex: Ahah, well, he's only 6 years younger than me, no big deal. Mr. Horny: Well, you're f**king hot, you're boyfriend is lucky. Austin: Wow. My ex: Ahaha, well, thanks. Mr. Horny: You're cute too, a bit girly for me, but I can dig that. Austin: Ahah.. Mr. Horny: You guys up for a threesome ? Austin: Seriously ? Mr. Horny: Did I sound like I was kidding ? Austin: Ohhhh... no... My ex: Ahaha, uhhh, well, we're monogamous. I don't think either one of us would be comfortable with it. Austin: Yeah, but, no offense, you are attractive, but threesomes just aren't our thing. I guess we're not slutty enough, sorry. Mr. Horny: Well, if you change your mind, here's my number. (slides us a napkin with his information) Mr. Horny: Bye hotties. My ex: Ahaha, he was.. friendly. Austin: Yeah, we should totally prank call him later and lead him on. My ex: Ahahaha.

AND this creepo who would find someone to stare at, follow him around, get discouraged, look at the porn for a while, button and unbutton is shirt a few times eventually settling on leaving it unbuttoned, and rub his nipple while hypnotized by the porn... and then repeat those steps all over again.  Weeeeeeird.If there was like 20-30 less people in the bar, I might've had a better time because I would've been able to actually move around, but I was pretty much confined to one of the sofas in the back room the entire time.Might go back, but not my favorite place in the world.Aaaaand... the music was decent?",,,
