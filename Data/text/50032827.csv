Updated review","I called and changed my open table reservation from 11 to 11:30. It didn't save in their system. Their hostess was super rude when I arrived. She announced that my reservation was at 11 and didn't seat me and made me wait for at least 8 minutes before she sat me. First off, it is not my fault that who ever answered the phone did not update it in your system. THE PLACE WAS DEAD. So why did I have to wait? I come here all the time? I am actually a regular on Yelp here and you're making me wait because of your attitude problem and a mistake on your part with plenty of open tables?? No thanks The Ribbon.",,,
2,Peter B.,"Washington, DC",15,17,3,5.0,9/2/2018,"Just wanted to write this review to say that if ""TJM"" weren't a moron clown, he wouldn't need to call the restaurant to determine whether the restaurant was on the north or south side.As everyone knows, even-numbered addresses are on the south side on numbered streets in Manhattan. You are not a great hire, TJM. Why don't you brush up on local geography instead of publicly shaming hard working hosts?Oh by the way- awesome fried chicken at this spot. You should definitely check it out!",1,4,1
3,Alan L.,"Cranford, NJ",20,382,339,4.0,11/15/2018,Creative cocktails and comfort food. The Ribbon is a cozy neighborhood place and sip cocktails and have a meal. The room is inviting. The fried chicken is good - not outstanding. The cocktails are more memorable than the food. The staff is attentive.,2,,1
4,Stephen L.,"Mahwah, NJ",11,87,160,4.0,7/21/2018,"I went to The Ribbon for brunch and ordered the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon. The eggs were cooked well- they sat on the salmon and the yolk oozed out after cutting into them. Smoked salmon to me is always great and this was no exception. The English muffin halves were nothing special. The dish also came with potato slices, which were alright. I was hoping that the portion of the dish would be a little bigger. Also, I'm not sure if my Eggs Benedict was really worth $24.The waiters were super friendly and managed well with a large group of people. The service speed was decent. The seating area can get a bit crowded and noisy, but it's not too bad. The decor is pretty nice.Overall, The Ribbon has good brunch food (albeit a bit pricey) with very good service. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a good brunch place in the area.",2,,1
5,Tresha W.,"Brooklyn, NY",121,93,186,3.0,7/23/2018,"Ehh... went for brunch, summary is expensive, nicely presented but average food and service.The meal started off with our waitress putting down our silverware and my husband getting a knife wrapped in a long black hair. We pointed it out the waitress who then only picked up the knife and not the whole napkin and fork on which the knife and hair laid. I had to tell her to take the whole thing. Gross and honestly the image of the knife wrapped in her long black hair was hard to shake during the meal.I got the avocado toast and the fries. The avocado toast was good and standard as far as avocado toasts go. It came with an arugula salad that was nicely dressed. The fries were an expensive disappointment. $10 for a tin of shoe string fries. I was hoping for some thick potato fries, especially for the price. My picture of them looks better than the real thing. Just pass on them, not worth it.My husband had what I think is their signature dish the chicken and pancake. He said the chicken was pretty good. Not anywhere in the universe of true Nashville hot chicken but still good. Crispy, flavorful, and served hot. The pancake was enormous and had a luscious texture, though was short on scallion flavor. Overall fine but not good enough for a repeat visit from us.",1,,
6,Lisa G.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,16,37,2.0,11/6/2018,Nice atmosphere but grossly overpriced average food.  $12 for a deviled egg (just one) and $15 for a bowl of chicken soup.,,,
7,Cindy R.,"Littleton, MA",46,217,174,4.0,9/18/2018,"I was in New York City last weekend with my sister. We were visiting her daughter and son-in-law. On Friday night we had a reservation at Ribbon, the UWS restaurant my niece has been itching to try. We arrived at the appointed time to this very charming space: pressed tin ceiling, exposed brick walls, lighted with Edison bulbs--a very inviting space. We were immediately directed to our table and welcomed by the first of two exceptional waiters. We started with drinks and an order of Ribbon chips which were served with a spicy Cajun and malt vinegar dip. The chips were delish! Ribbon has an nice selection of local craft beers both on tap and in bottles (also of note, they've got an excellent selection of bourbons and other whiskeys.) I had a Coney Island Brewing Mermaid Pilsner, which was a nice choice on this warm, late-summer evening. We each had something different from the varied menu that featured comfort food, seafood, some Italian-flavored items, among other things. I had what I believe is one of Ribbon's signature items: fried chicken. It was scrumptious! And plentiful, so much so that I shared it with my niece who had matzo ball soup (see what I mean when I said varied?) Sis had the Ribbon Dip, prime rib sandwich with au jus. She was very enthusiastic in her praise. My niece's hub had the fried chicken sandwich and expressed his approval. As previously mentioned we had two exceptional waiters serving our table. The first was moved to a different part of the restaurant as it was very busy, and the level of (excellent) service was seamless in the transition. I'd definitely recommend Ribbon for an excellent dining experience on the Upper West Side.",,,
8,t.j. m.,"Los Angeles, CA",1983,52,126,4.0,8/14/2018,"A delicious and quiet place (at least at 1:30 on a Tuesday) - the only reason they get 4 stars is the hostess we called actually, really, had no idea if the restaurant was on the north side or the south side of the street. That's insane. Not a great hire. Anyway, the deviled eggs are inventive and delicious and we had to try the poboy as we are New Orleans Louisiana by trade. Well those eggs are little deviled and that poboy was no po' boy it was rich and delish!As soon as the staff finds out where the restaurant is you should visit!! Food was great and service was prompt and gracious!-your deviled original yelp gangster,Tee wee",6,11,6
9,Joy S.,"New York, NY",31,93,238,4.0,5/1/2018,"Really surprised this place doesn't have higher ratings. Came here for an event and was able to sample their fried chicken (easily the tastiest item on their menu), shrimp ""taco"", black bean sliders and chicken liver mousse. I also listed that in order of favorites! The chicken liver mousse is an acquired taste and not something I'd try again, but it reminded me faintly of nuts. I'm not sure if the fried chicken had dairy, but I'd double check on that. Everything else was dairy-free to my knowledge.The service tonight was also excellent. Was with my bf and the staff definitely warmed up to our humor.  Would come again to have a real meal here.Thanks again for hosting, Yelp and Ruggy!",3,1,2
10,Nez B.,"Manhattan, NY",271,239,368,4.0,5/1/2018,"My first impression was great location literally half a block from the B train and central park so the makings for a good date night. When I entered I was cheerfully greeted by 2 nice and lovely hostesses (I feel this is very important for restaurants), and escorted to the event space in the rear. Seating is plentiful, this place is rather huge inside, and a very chill ambiance with brick walls, dimly lit relaxing and semi casual patrons.My favorite bites I sampled were the shrimp tacos (great tasting small teases) , the black bean burger (delicious), and the perfectly cooked fried wings (soft, crispy, super tasty). They have an outodoor patio in the back which looks like it has seating also.Another big plus was the waiter team, all very attentive, polite, and cheerful. I always have an eye on how management and the service team behave and interact with customers and I must say they left a great impression. Definitely overall a good spot for a casual meal, date, business meeting, or gathering. For tasty unique food and good service its made my go to list.PS: Thanks Yelp and Ruggy for the event love!",2,1,2
11,Hannah C.,"New York, NY",41,182,98,5.0,5/2/2018,"I came here for an event so I was lucky to be able to try several items on the menu. More than anything else I was looking forward to trying the fried chicken and it did not disappoint, it was perfectly crispy and moist. I also loved the shrimp ""tacos"" (served bite size on tortilla chips at the event), black bean and avocado sliders, and the buffalo cauliflower. The spicy deviled eggs, risotto balls, and flatbread were good but to me they weren't standouts.The staff were all friendly, the ambiance was nice, and the food was great so I definitely plan on coming back.",1,,1
12,Daria M.,"Lake Hopatcong, NJ",3,60,1,5.0,11/12/2018,"We are not often on the UWS but we were SO glad a show at the Beacon lead us to dining at The Ribbon! The decor is modern, sleek, but comfortable. The staff was extremely professional, warm, informative, and neat as a pin! The cocktail selection was inventive, and I ordered a Mr. Pimms, a gin based take on the classic Pimms cup. It was delicious and refreshing! We shared delectable tomato soup, and the East Coast oysters were some of the best I ever had! The ribs were very tasty, but the corn bread with them was the star on that plate. The special of duck sausage with roasted brussel sprouts and sweet potato puree was the perfect autumn meal! I am thrilled we found The Ribbon, and we are sure to return!",,,
13,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",255,802,1189,5.0,6/15/2018,"To put simply, the Blue Ribbon group has their shit together. I have ordered delivery and dined in and have never had bad experiences with any dish or service. The corned beef hash on the brunch menu is so so good.",2,,3
14,Lu H.,"New York, NY",288,552,1933,4.0,5/23/2018,"I didn't think the Ribbon would be family friendly because the other locations are a little ""scene-y"", but given this one is on UWS, we dared to try it for an early dinner on a Friday. It was a great choice. They were very accommodating with baby, and I see several other strollers around. They have happy hour and the wine selection for happy hour is actually very good. For food, we ordered fried chicken (how can you not order fried chicken when you come here) and the burger. Food came out reasonably fast, and my fried chicken was as good as I expected - crispy and well seasoned, juicy on the inside, once you dip in honey, it balanced out. My husband's burger was cooked very well, may lack a little seasoning but oh well. Our waiter was fast, efficient, checked with us multiple times to make sure everything was good. Definitely will be back for another early dinner with baby.",6,4,7
15,Wendy H.,"New York, NY",957,456,406,5.0,5/11/2018,"Two words. Fried. Chicken. I cannot rave about their fried chicken enough. The crispy skin with a blast of flavorful spices is a perfect wrapper for the juicy wing. It is an unreal experience. And oh yeah, they have a bunch of other things going for them too, such as their buffalo cauliflower, which I prefer to buffalo chicken wings! The service here is amazing. This is one of those establishments that can and should become a go-to spot for anyone within a 5-mile radius. Their room in the back is nice for private events.",12,8,14

Everything was really good and the fried chicken was so crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! We had a great evening and really enjoyed the atmosphere!",3,1,2

18,Tricia M.,"Davis, CA",101,396,746,4.0,11/19/2017,"I wish my dining experience had been better. But we were crammed next to couple, who couldn't stop complaining about their dinner and their dining experience from the moment we arrived until they left. Waah waah. I should note that they never complained about the food. Because the food at The Ribbon is really delicious. It's hard to find fault with it. Instead they complained about how slow it was to get bread. Who cares? Seriously. Who needs this? Shuttup and eat. Yelp about it later, am I right?But I digress. Here's what they couldn't ruin. My butcher's salad. Which was the best freaking salad I have had in recent memory. It was better than ordering the actual roast meats on the menu because you have the guise of enjoying a virtuous salad -- and you get a range of meats, not settling for just one. Oh yes and there was blue cheese in there, which is always welcome and some bits of bacon. It makes my mouth water just thinking about that great salad. And the dressing was perfect. Just light enough to keep it from being too dry, but not all vinegary like some salad dressings are. It was simply magical. One thing to note - you have to sit in the front room to take advantage of the happy hour menu (even though happy hour is available 7 days a week). And another thing - The Ribbon is within walking distance of the Lincoln Center, if you are looking for a place to eat before a show. That's what we did and they were incredibly busy that night, but also incredibly quick with the meal so we made excellent time and still had plenty of time left to linger over that salad and sigh over how good it was and still had time leftover to speak ill of those miserable people sitting next to us after they left.",1,2,1

Updated review","Still an excellent place to eat on the UWS! The fried chicken (Sun & Mon nights only), with a side of creamed spinach and the mushrooms is probably our favorite.We came here for brunch when my sister was in town and everyone was super happy with what they got. We shared the avocado toast. It was really good. She had the chilaquiles (side note: it's no longer super spicy like it was when they first opened, now it doesn't have any spice), and we both had the breakfast sandwich. The potatoes that come with the breakfast sandwich were divine! Super crispy and had tons of flavor.Their coffee was delicious, and their condiments (I really like mustard & mayo) are on-point. Yeah!",1,,1
22,Caitlin G.,"New York, NY",384,65,40,4.0,5/7/2018,"Sooooooo good. Glad I came to this spot on the UWS! Food: tried the fried chicken, risotto rice balls, cauliflower broccolini pizza, the buffalo cauliflower, shrimp ""tacos"" and the black bean burger. Everything was sooo good and prepared perfectly. The risotto rice balls, shrimp ""tacos"", and  buffalo cauliflower apps were my favorites! Service: excellent. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Atmosphere: Upscale bar kind of vibe.

24,George B.,"Bronx, NY",191,167,92,5.0,4/21/2018,"Amazing!!!It's a great feeling when you don't plan ahead and quickly pick a place for dinner on a Friday night and it turns out being a great time. I read a few other reviews before writing mine and I just have to laugh.  I laugh when people are shocked because a place falls short of their expectations and rate a place low with no valid reason.My experience: I love the atmosphere of The Ribbon, from their decor, layout and clientele. As soon as you walk in, you get this sense of energy and excitement knowing that you're going to have a good time.The Food: Everything we selected was great. This particular night we had the baked meatballs to start, the Pig Club, the Fried Chicken and chocolate chip bread pudding. Between my wife and I we enjoyed 4 cocktails which brings me to another Yelper's review and complaint about value. They stated they only had 2 cocktails and no desert and paid $200 between 2 people. Everything I listed (app, 2-entrees, desert, 4 cocktails =$170)I can't finish without mentioning the best fried chicken I ever had. This chicken is so good, 2 separate parties told me how they were jealous that I got the last order (post happy hour)",1,1,1
25,Steve N.,"New York, NY",97,576,23,4.0,3/17/2018,"You have to chuckle at the Ribbon's self-description as ""the best upper west side restaurant in NYC."" Yes, I was going to write ""Pies and Thighs in Williamsburg is the best upper west side restaurant in NYC,"" or ""the Porch is the best upper west side restaurant in Dallas."" (I'm thinking of writing that in my review of the Porch.) Giggles aside, the Ribbon stands as tall as many UWS restaurants - Pizzeria Sirenetta, Tessa, Maison Pickle, the Mermaid Inn, Bodrum - and a little shorter than Bustan. Where it falls short is on value - except during happy hour; and value isn't always what you want as a UWS diner. The neighborhood feel of this place is what drives it over the crest of the decision-making hill, which is comprised in a large measure by its comfort, pleasant decor, and excellent staff. Here's what we had: Deviled egg with pickled peppers (2 halves), HH, 3.5Buffalo cauliflower, 14.5: rich, delicious, and generousWhite bean hummus, 14.5: very nice, with pickled vegetables and ample toastRoasted cod, 28: excellent cod with beautiful flavors and texture, served in a heated dish to keep it warm for the slower eaters, a good value and an uncommon fish dish which was ample for sharingWine HH, 7: An excellent value because the tap wines were good; there is a red Cabernet, and three whites, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and, maybe, Pinot Grigio is the thirdTOTAL 88.75 w taxI want to note I had the HH margarita (10) on a previous visit, and it was very good.SHOUT OUT to Mohamed at the bar for being pleasant, thoughtful, and attentive",3,1,3

The Mac and cheese fritters  and buffalo cauliflower were a great start to the meal. I had the butcher salad. It was full of smoked pork and beef. Yummy!

Yes, the restaurant boasts classic Upper West Side prices (and clientele, most of whom were gone by 9 pm) but the food was very good. It neither hits you in the face with overdone taste nor underwhelms you with blandness. It falls into that happy zone where you're not quite sure if you're eating healthy or not.We ordered the East Coast and West Coast Oysters for appetizers and they made a run to be deemed the best part of the meal. I paired that with a glass of Malbec and had the Prime Rib of Pork for my entree, which really was very good. To top the night off, I went in on the Apple Strudel.The only knocks on my experience at The Ribbon were the prices - understandable - and the service. Our waiter came off as having an attitude; it was clear he didn't think very highly of us. Nonetheless, that did not dampen our enjoyment of the meal, as we still enjoyed it very much.",1,,2

I was able to try a plethora of options - the buffalo cauliflower, the salmon, the burgers, the kale salad, I could go on and on. Take a look at my pictures for more details.

Sunday because that is the only day they serve Fried Chicken.  So we had the Fried Chicken!   It was four pieces (half a chicken)  crispy and delicious,especially when you drizzle it with honey.  We shared a Caesar salad.  It was your typical dish, plentiful and filling.  Neither my friend or I like their version of Caesar dressing.  We also shared the Mac and Cheese Fritters.  It is exactly as visioned. A fried cheese ball with macaroni inside.   Even though we were stuffed from eating everything we ordered, we were handed the dessert menu and cloud not result the temptation.  They all sounded great but we opted for the cheesecake special with apricot and ice cream. Add two coffees and we had a wonderful meal.  We went on Sunday for the Fried Chicken special but I'll go back anyway for the rest of the menu.  They have a whole bunch of great food to try.",,,

42,D D.,"Manhattan, NY",2,100,19,4.0,5/11/2018,"TLDR: High prices, but great appetizers and entrees. You can skip the drinks and dessert, which weren't memorable. Too loud for conversation though. Overall rating: A-Pro Tip: There are A LOT of stairs at this restaurant. Stairs up to the entrance, stairs between rooms, and steep stairs down to the restrooms! Not friendly for mobility impaired or handicapped diners! Another high end restaurant that has my top 3 pet peeves: too dark, too crowded, and too loud! Am I the only person left in NYC that appreciates good conversation during dinner while eating excellent food I can actually see (vs just Instagramming my meal!) and without someone bumping me?! I asked our waiter for cocktail suggestions that were NOT sweet. She highly recommended the ""Leave It to Lucky"" cocktail (made with Arette Blanco Tequila, Aperol, Lime, Grapefruit/$16), which I got. I found it way too sweet for my tastes. It shouldn't have been sweet at all with those ingredients! I think they used an inferior grapefruit juice that was loaded with sugar. Definitely wasn't fresh squeezed juice. I only drank half of it and let the rest go to waste. Mind you I HATE wasting food/drinks! We also got a bottle of red wine for the table (don't remember the name) that I preferred to my drink (and I'm not usually a wine drinker).I was assisting someone with mobility issues to get to the restroom. When I asked where the nearest restroom was we were pointed to the main restrooms downstairs. Luckily, another waiter saw us and stopped us at the top of the stairs. He kindly mentioned that there was a handicap restroom on the same floor that she could use instead! I honestly had no idea how we were going to navigate the steep steps without injury! Anyway, onto the food:APPETIZERS:-Country Pâté (Cornichons, Dijon, Pickled Vegetables, $16.50): Good but just too chunky for me. B-Grilled Avocado (Pickled Pepper Crema, $9): Wow surprisingly good! The dollop of cream on top had a nice spice, perfectly ripe avocado. Pretty expensive though for just half an avocado. A-Beef Marrow & Oxtail Marmalade (Challah Toast & Fried Parsley, $20.50): So good! Might even be better than the version at Blue Ribbon Brasserie! It wasn't sweet as the word marmalade suggests. All the flavors blended together beautifully. If you're a fan of beef marrow, get this! A++ENTREES:-Butcher's Salad (Romaine, Bacon, Spit Roasted Meats, Mushrooms & Blue Cheese, $28): I was trying to be healthier by picking a salad. One of my dining companion's joked that he hoped that it wasn't the E-coli contaminated romaine lettuce (it wasn't, I was fine the next day!). For $28 I was expecting more than flavorless meats (cooked properly) over cheap romaine. Suggestion: You don't need to be so stingy with the spices guys! There was just blue cheese crumbled finely over the romaine. Where's the dressing? My dish was sorely lacking in comparison to everyone else. SKIP! C-Side of Garlic & Sage Roast Fingerlings ($10): I got this to add to my disappointing salad. Good, very crispy. Needed a little salt. Didn't really taste the sage though. A-Prime Rib of Pork (Apricot & Chili Jam, $36): Didn't personally try it, but the person who ordered it said it was good. A-Lamb Chops (Eggplant Tomato Confit, Mint, Cucumber Yogurt, $40): I sampled this. This was the best entree by far! Get this if you're a fan of lamb! A+-I can't remember what the fourth person in my group got as their entree (probably a fish dish since I don't recall trying it). N/ANo desserts really appealed to me. Overall great experience and I would recommend it. I'm glad to have enjoyed another place from this restaurant company, but I don't feel the need to return here anytime soon. This is more of a special occasion place for me anyway.",,,1

Came for an early Saturday night dinner and the place was buzzing for happy hour. We ordered oysters, beef tartare, clams and salad and it was all good quality but in general the menu is standard American fare, with most menu options leaning towards the heavier side. Not a lot of healthy options available and the price ($200 for two, with one cocktail, one wine, and no dessert) seemed a little steep. The men's restroom was a complete mess, which never leaves a good impression. Will probably return to give them another chance but based on our first visit we were a little underwhelmed.",,,1

I was with my parents (it's their first time in the US) and my Aunt and Uncle who were all  Senior Citizens. I made reservations for lunch over the phone prior to coming and so we were seated immediately. First impression is that the place is really nice and cozy. Our server on the other hand, was very disappointing and RUDE. 1.) Never bother to ask if we've been to the restaurant before. 2.) Aunt asked if there is anything not too salty on the menu (asking for recommendations because of their medical issues). Our server immediately said in a loud voice where the next table patrons looked at us ""You haven't eaten all of the food in our menu. You came to the wrong place. If you're here looking for healthy food, you're in the wrong place."" He then explained their concept is comfort food and proceeded to tell us his boss does not want them telling people what to eat. He made me and my parents feel like we can't be there. Had it been easy  for my elders to walk around and find another place I would ask them to go. 3.) Told us multiple times that we should all order at the same time like we didn't understand what he said the first time. Very rushed. Food was okay. We all loved the Banana walnut cake and ordered 3 more loaves to go. That server really ruined  the experience.",,,

46,Jess A.,"Louisville, KY",318,219,2292,5.0,2/25/2017,"Ribbon was the venue the birthday girl settled on for her celebratory dinner. On a Thursday evening, the only reservations left for Friday night was at 9:15p and we snatched it up for a table of five.After an eventful walk through the city we were a few minutes late but the hostess was able to hold our table. The place was packed and we felt incredibly lucky to be sat at a rounded booth at a back corner of the restaurant against the open windows facing the kitchen. We were able to watch our order prepped by the kitchen staff and the booth kept our table space muted enough I easily enjoy lively conversation. Our servers and staff were courteous and welcoming.The drink menu was pricey ($15 for a cocktail means one and done for this girl) but well executed. I sampled a lemon rosemary vodka combo that was good, and a peach bourbon mashup that tasted like home (Kentucky). Appetizers included a well received foie gras pate, delicious buffalo cauliflower and my favorite, the grilled avocado.Ribbon's sweet spot is clearly it's proteins with bone marrow, deviled eggs, steaks and rotisserie chicken featured on the menu. The special of the day was a perfectly smoked and tender beef brisket, a hearty portion easily shared by the table and my favorite of the nights. Others at the table ordered the pork with red cabbage, braised beef short ribs with brussel sprouts, the mahi mahi tuna, and house made cavatappi pasta with artichokes and olive oil. Easily shared by the table.We ended the night - stuffed to the gills and throwing caution to the wind- with a sticky toffee pudding that our wait staff added a candle and a happy birthday wish to so the table could sing.

Food: we were in the mood for burgers so we zoomed into the 7 burger option and ordered the classic beef and the pork. the beef burger is better I have to say though both were delicious. Beef is more juicy and served in the classic soft burger bun. The pork is in a baguette with slices of pork roast and bacon, this one is spicy. Fries are thin and lovely. We killed both plates full of fries. Also ordered the daily special of potato pancake with smoked salmon and caviar and crème fresh, delish.the server was so nice and attentive.The only reason I'm giving one less star is that the wine offering made no sense - a fabulous glass of dessert wine was priced ""cheap"" while a regular bottle of red the Zinfandel for example was priced at $62.

So we asked the waitress when it was. She cold said they don't have a public Wi-Fi. We explained that we already were given the Wi-Fi password we just needed to confirm it.

I don't really write a review of my experiences expecting freebies and often I completely disregard these.My wife and I decided to watch the England vs Sweden game in there for Brunch at 10:00 am. Alex was truly amazing and everyone and everything was just spectacular. We were immeditely taken care of and greeted with a lovely Strawberry Mimosas with Basil and a banana Pecan loaf (with cream cheese filling) loaf.OMG!I couldn't handle all that food and I am not used to brunch but, it was all so tasty and well made. We were served The Buffalo Style Cauliflower, Smoked salmon with toast and arancini rice balls.If that wasn't enough and of course celebrating the England victory,  beautifully made Eggs Benedict with Prosciutto Cotto and a French toast with berries and maple came along.Fantastic food and service and Alex was such a host.*Before anyone thinks I am promoting a place, I've paid for my bill.

It is truly psychedelic and will make you hallucinate visions of beefy joy.Seriously you guys, this is a top-notch burger of doom. The bun is squishy but sturdy. The patty is slightly bigger than the bun, thick but still a little floppy, charred outside, dark pink inside, well-seasoned, very juicy and full of rich meaty flavor. Atop the beef we have a quilt of funky gruyere and a thick cap of roasted portobello and some slices of smaller shrooms, and below the beef we have a little garden of lightly wilted arugula to deliver a peppery bite. All in all, it's pretty great!Now I will caution that this restaurant is damn expensive. Think $15 for a basic Caesar salad or $35 for an 8-ounce hanger steak. But the burger, which comes with fries and pickles, is a relatively modest $20. Pair it with a craft beer and you're out of here for $35 or so with tax and tip, which is a little splurgy but nothing you'll regret after tripping out on this groovy burger, I promise.",6,4,5

69,John Z.,"Coconut Creek, FL",333,308,395,4.0,12/5/2016,"Ribbon was first meal back visiting NYC (and my old stomping grounds, the UWS), and the meal did not disappoint. Brunch reservations for 2:15 (couldn't get 2pm -- it's a popular place) got us seated promptly upon arrival. The entire interior oozes a lush and pub-like comfort; homey yet polished w/o being too-upscale. Having done my menu research prior, I knew that meat was going to be on my menu. And my choice of the ""Ribbon Dip"" did not disappoint. An ample, excellent mound of thin-carved prime rib nestled in a perfectly softer bun, the sandwich was accompanied by an equally generous portion of nicely-done shoestring fries (which held up for the entire meal). Both the sandwich and the fries were enhanced from the accompanying caramelized onion au jus, making for a modestly decadent, well-salted (but not too-salty) meal.My friend's $24 option for the fried chicken seemed a bit less impressive upon presentation, and echoed our waiter's ""are you SURE you don't want to order any accompaniments?"" advice. A taste shared confirm it was very good chicken, but dunno if by itself was worth the price tag. Our third party opted for the baked eggs in tomato, artichoke, white beans, eggplant & goat cheese. Plating was excellent, reviews were as well; unfortunately I couldn't sneak a taste to verify. Oh, and a shared app of avocado toast, which was fine but not great (admittedly living in CA has made me a bit of an avocado snob). Good bread though!I suspect from other Yelp reviews and Ribbon's website that they really shine for cocktails and dinner -- two excellent reasons to return.

And based on our experience last night, they have also increased in quality. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. Our drink orders were taken promptly. The recommended anejo tequila was terrific, and the rye-based ""Franconia"" cocktail was pretty good (next time I might just opt for an old-fashioned). The food was excellent all around -- for appetizers, the pate is delicious and the smoked salmon is too. The mahi mahi and branzino entrees were very good, and the sides (roast carrots and zucchini) were really great. We will definitely be coming back to The Ribbon to explore more of the menu, but we'll be tempted to stick with the pate and smoked salmon appetizers because they were amazing.

We were seated right away and the staff was very attentive. We ordered the grilled avocado for an appetizer, and it's wonderfully delicious! Because it was Sunday, I had the fried chicken which was very good, but I thought for $25 it was quite pricey especially because it's served with no side. My boyfriend had the chicken sandwich which he liked but said was a tad undercooked, he also mentioned the fries taste a lot like McDonald's fries (which is not necessarily a bad thing). I would not come here again, but that's because not much else in the menu interested us (we are not big on seafood). The people next to us really enjoyed their meal, and the service was great.",,1,1

Updated review","Knocked it outta the park!I finally tried the Amish half chicken. Holy smokes. I've never had such moist, tasty chicken. Ever! In fact I generally don't order chicken anywhere because I've never really liked it before. I will definitely come back for this dinner and you should too!",,,
84,Franny A.,"New York, NY",840,1280,1046,4.0,9/24/2015,"Location location location- down the block from the famous Dakota, the Ribbon has all the bells & whistles. Americana redux is represented here. Starting with their AMAZING bread service which is bread from their Blue Ribbon bakery plus Vermont butter- fabThis is a pricey spot on a tony block. I went with Scottish salmon in a leek sauce and added mashed as a side. Most mains don't come with sides. The leek sauce was ridiculous, but the salmon was cooked more medium than medium rare. All in all, I will be back for more!",3,,2
85,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2413,5152,4.0,8/11/2016,"I used to spend a lot of time in the Upper West Side in my new-to-New York dating days, and boy do I wish the Ribbon were around sooner. Had that been the case, there would have been better dining choices than Westside Market and the juice bar at Equinox.The Ribbon is the perfect destination for an elevated, yet casual Brasserie style dinner with friends or loved ones. The menu has a little something for everyone, the portions are huge and perfect for sharing, and there's a mix of chic downtown decor with exposed brick and Edison bulbs, but also Mets baseball streaming near the bar. No matter what your style is, you can feel at home. Menu wise, if you can't find something you'll enjoy, you're the most difficult eater ever. They do lean a bit meat heavy, so if you're into organ meats (pates, foie gras), burgers (from ox burgers to traditional beef), or surf to turf specialities, you're in luck. I opted for the Ribbon Dip with prime rib accompanied by a caramelized onion dipping broth. A bit different than the au jus style French Dip sandwich made famous by Philippe's in LA, but a standout on the menu in its own right. Whether you live uptown or you're taking a break from walking around Central Park, keep The Ribbon in your back pocket as a fab pit stop.",16,10,14

87,Barbara M.,"Secaucus, NJ",116,418,397,4.0,1/1/2017,"Had one of the best New Year's eve experiences of my life at the ribbon last night. Kudos to the management for bringing in Aziza Miller quartet for an A1 jazz show.  This five-star act was a nice complement to the beauty of this Upper West Side restaurant. Each element of the decor of this restaurant was beautifully warm and inviting. The exposed brick with all the natural woods made for a cozy environment.  The chairs were comfortable. The bathrooms were beautifully designed and cared for throughout the evening. And they had a disability bathroom at the restaurant level which I was grateful for because I have difficulty going up and down steps.The service was exceptional. Our waiter was knowledgeable had perfect timing and while I had an issue with an appetizer it was resolved very nicely and with customer satisfaction at the center. The managers were pleasant to interact with.As for the food, there was plenty of good choices on the menu and all for typical upper West side prices. There was a specialty crab cake for $19  which I found to be grossly overpriced. While the crab cake was presented nicely on a bed of avocado mash and ate tiny dollop of nicely dressed watercress with a tarragon tartar sauce on top of the crab cake, $19 was an excessive charge for a single crab cake. Also, I paid  $37 for a queen cut a prime rib and was not offered an accompaniment of either a potato or vegetables or something. I was a little taken aback by that. It was a la carte.Both the crabcake and the prime rib where very heavily salted. The spaetzel  with cheese and onions was unbelievably delicious. The risotto was a little watery and came with a pile of roasted vegetables on top as opposed to vegetables mixed in the risotto itself. We were a little surprised by that presentation as well. I mean I don't mind spending $150 +  for a meal when the quality of the wine and food is good and the preparation and presentation is good, but they missed the mark just a little bit here with the taste of the food. However we did appreciate how very nice everyone was and the complimentary champagne for the New Year's Eve toast and was so pleased with the music that accompanied our meal with the Aziza Miller band.   We were so caught up in what was such a nice vibe between all of the patrons that came to the restaurant and the absolute comfort and safety we felt in the restaurant.  The staff seemed to be having a good time relating to each other and working well together. It was just a beautiful evening. And in the end, I felt good about money spent especially given the wonderfully entertaining night that it was for all.  I will definitely go there again--",,,
88,Emma C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,23,0,4.0,7/5/2018,Pretty good. Better for a drink than food. The service was a bit slow when we got food at the bar. However nice atmosphere and good was good.

They originally sat us in the back room; when we asked us about the happy hour specials the waitress explained that the specials only applied to the front room, but actually encouraged us to move us there and easily switched our tables.We got the oysters, $1 each for happy hour and they were great. My wife ordered the lamb chop and I got the ox burger, both were delicious. I also had the Pineapple Mule which was a nice twist on a Moscow Mule. For dessert our waiter suggested the Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding, which was the best thing we had all night.",2,,

Extremely friendly, knowledgeable and attentive staff.  The Bloody Mary was perfection - good spice, pickled veggies and bacon (add-on).  I am not normally a fan of deviled eggs, but at The Ribbon they served deviled eggs topped with a friend oyster and pickled jalapeño, which is to die for. (They have other options as well). I ordered the corned beef hash for my main dish. It's atypical but delicious: chunks of corned beef, coin sized potatoes slices and broccoli topped with two perfectly poached eggs.  They take reservations which is also a plus.",2,,
94,Karan D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,7/14/2018,"The Ribbon's menu is well designed in theory but poorly executed. I ate the short ribs and prime rib and there was cartilage in my ribs and nothing prime about my entree. Restaurants like this are the worst because they look and sound good but are pretty much all about cutting costs, taking your money, and giving customers a sub par product with cheap ingredients in return.",,,
95,Nicole D.,"New York, NY",19,338,213,4.0,8/6/2015,"I'm a fan of Blue Ribbon Restaurants and this latest establishment did not disappoint. Enjoyed the decor that pays homage to the former Hotel Franconia and the cozy round banquets.  So many dishes that I wanted to try from house made pates, raw bar to prime rib. Lots of great dishes and definitely a place to go back to.Beef Marrow & Oxtail Marmalade ($16.50) - one of my all-time favorite NYC dishes and so excited to see it offered at The Ribbon.  The bone marrow was large with a hefty amount of marrow.  Not as much oxtail marmalade provided than I remember getting at Brasserie, but still meaty, rich and really delicious.  Maybe they are reserved on the appetizer to have enough for the Ox Burger?  Nonetheless, always happy with this dish.Foie Gras Torchon ($21) - great portion of foie gras.  Rich and tasty. 'Nuff said.Striped Bass ($26) - large portion of bass with lots of crispy skin.  Flesh was tender and flaked nicely.  The fennel and orange salad was bright and refreshing and made for a lovely summer dish.  Harlan's ""Chicken Fried"" Short Rib ($26) - I had to try this because it's short rib but I wouldn't order again.  The short rib is pounded very thin and the breading was nice and crispy.  But the short rib shrunk from cooking to about 2/3 the size of the breading, so the crust was loose and came apart from the meat while cutting through it.  The white sausage gravy was delicious and the tastiest item on the dish.  And the pickled dilly beans provided some needed tartness for the fried food and rich gravy.Layered Coconut Rum Cake - this was SO good!  Just the right size portion to end the meal and served with coconut ice cream.  The cake is light with layers of fluffy cream and toasted coconut on top.  A coconut lover's dream!",3,,
96,Maud D.,"New York, NY",347,136,14,4.0,8/4/2016,"As a former Upper West Side resident (born and raised in fact) I can only say, what took you so long?! The Ribbon is the delicious, versatile dining option we were looking for back in the day, when Good Enough to Eat and Popovers were the best we could do without heading up to Morningside Heights. Ok so maybe it's been awhile since I lived in the neighborhood, but I'll be coming back more often now that I've been to The Ribbon. My dining companion and I started the evening off with a couple of cocktails. I had The Dotty, which despite being served up in a martini glass, wasn't ""girly"" at all. The tart hibiscus was only minimally sweetened by honey and pineapple, making it a delicious and refreshing drink with not a hint of headache. For appetizers, we tried the Parisian pate, which was meaty and delightful, the fat cut well by the side of pickles; the salmon ceviche, which was fresh and delightful; and my personal fave, the buffalo cauliflower. Spice haters beware, because this crispy little treat is BATHED in hot sauce, but if you're a lover of the burn like me, it's tangy, crispy, and you can still pretend it's healthy because cauliflower. For mains, my boo went with the Ribbon Dip, which came with delicious shoestring fries and a wonderful onion au jus, which was more like onion soup than your typical dip -- a REALLY good thing. The baguette was crunchy enough to withstand the dipping, and the meat was plentiful and well seasoned. I had the crab cake special, which was also delicious, served aside a salad. The crab was lightly tempura battered and delicious, but I have to say it could have done without the included bacon and basil on the sandwich. With those additions, the crabby goodness was totally lost, but once I removed them, this sandwich was on point.The ambiance is romantic without being stuffy. Your jeans and a tshirt are welcomed (my boyfriend's LCD Soundsystem shirt even got a compliment from the GM), but you won't feel out of place in more chic attire either. The soundtrack is a time warp to the early 2000s, with Modest Mouse, Arcade Fire, and yes, LCD, on rotation, so if you're of a certain age (like, 30ish) you'll feel right at home.",2,,2

The room smelled like cedar. It was a pleasant smell. I had the steak with fries. I think it may have been a skirt steak but my preference is a rib eye.

101,John L.,"New York, NY",79,4,0,1.0,10/24/2017,We had a reservation for a table of four. We were sat promptly in a section that was closing for the night (a Sunday). Our waiter was attentive and present when needed until the manager decided to cut him for the night and give us another waiter. The food was fine not worth the price but you're paying for UWS prices and people desperate for restaurants with a hint of glam.While we were having our appetizers two of us were finished myself and another guest were not. While I was putting food in my mouth the bus person cleared all of the plates including mine while I was eating! I went to speak to the host about this to make sure the rest of the night wasn't going to go this way. I mentioned several time that I DO NOT want a manager coming over to the table to talk to us because I didn't want to bother or upset my guests who are all very shy and just expect that restaurants are run that way. Guess what... the manager came over to the table 5 minutes later and started to explain that they were sorry and it shouldn't have... I cut her off and told her that I'm even more mortified that she came over when I told all THREE of the hosts that I did not want to speak to someone. She walked away and did the basic thing... sent over two desserts on the house.

103,Taylor A.,"Atlanta, GA",144,646,45,2.0,9/25/2016,"We started out with bloody marys on a late Saturday morning. After ordering we noticed a card on the table that was basically a create-your-own bloody mary card that the waiter never mentioned even though we asked about different versions and ingredients. Maybe the waiter was new, but the inattention to detail from him continued throughout the meal, so maybe not. We started out with a few fine plain deviled eggs that were tasty, but a few varieties (fried oyster, etc) are way overpriced. $6 for one single fried oyster deviled egg?!Next we had a chilled pea and asparagus soup that had an odd flavor and texture for a cold soup. I don't mind chilled soups, but this one would have been a lot better warm. Skip this one.The buffalo cauliflower is really tasty and is great to share with the table. Its a slow heat that builds as you eat it. For lunch I had the pig club and it was definitely a winner. I tried the fried chicken and definitely had order envy! Either are great choices. Though the food was overall OK, for the price I expected much better. For the price and the aloofness of the waiter I'd go somewhere else.",,,

The staff was friendly and accommodating so there were no issues there...the food is where it goes downhill. Went her for brunch and my date and I got the eggs benedict over smoked salmon. The beauty of this recipe should be a runny yolk...not a hard boiled egg. The fingerling potatoes were undercooked. The salmon was fresh so can't complain there.

108,Elsa L.,"Yonkers, NY",139,34,31,3.0,2/23/2018,"The first time I came here last year I was blown away by how good the food was that I would rave about it to all my friends that this place was AMAZING. Now fast forward to this Valentine's day 2018 I came with a group of friends, excited and ready to show them how good the food and the service was. First off we made a reservation for 6 and they wanted to seat us by the door which I did not like and asked for another table which they were nice to sit us at the back of the restaurant where not only is it nicer but much more quieter than the front of the restaurant. The waiter was very nice throughout our whole dining experience and even when he was done with his shift he let us know and introduced us to the other waiter. For starters, while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive we ordered drinks. My friend got strawberry fresh fields which had just the right amount of liquor and was very refreshing. My other friend was not so lucky with her drink, she got the apricot smash which tasted too earthy and more like dirt. We also ordered a bottle of the Rose wine which was pretty good, and not dry. For the appetizers we ordered the ribbon chips which were ok, nothing special and would probably not consider ordering again. For our main dish I ordered the Ribbon steak which was a hanger steak with green peppercorn sauce and french fries with a side of mashed potatoes. The french fries were delicious, crisp and thin; the mashed potatoes had just the right amount of seasoning but unfortunately was lukewarm. The hanger steak which I ordered medium  tasted OK, which i believe was missing flavor as it did not come with the peppercorn sauce. Three people in my party had ordered this dish and none of our dishes came with the peppercorn sauce which I had not realized till later on which at that point felt it was pointless in asking why it was missing. Other dishes that were ordered was the Bronzino, Lobster and Shrimp Curry, and the quinoa bowl. The curry dish which I had a taste of was delicious and full of flavor and the coconut milk gave it just the perfect taste. The quinoa bowl I tasted was also really yummy and very refreshing. I wished that I had gotten either dish instead of mine as it was more tastier and less expensive ( $18.50 vs $37) The spotlight of the night was without a doubt the dessert. Amongst our desserts ordered the most delicious one was the blue ribbon chocolate chip bread pudding which was warm, gooey, not too sweet which was complemented beautifully by the vanilla ice cream. The dessert I ordered for myself was the chocolate bruno, a flourless chocolate cake with white chocolate, graham cracker and vanilla ice cream. The cake was alright but you can't really go wrong with a chocolate cake. It said it came with graham crackers but I barely even noticed any much less tasted it. Definitely, this time around the food was a miss for me. I kept wishing I had ordered someone else's dish and for the price of this place I would have expected just a bit more. If you do plan on dining here, I do recommend to try the Lobster and Shrimp Curry as well as the Bread pudding for dessert and you will definitely not be disappointed.",1,,2
109,Bret F.,"Manhattan, NY",442,30,1,5.0,5/28/2018,"Came for Memorial Day brunch with a group of friends. Everything was delicious. I had the Buttermilk Biscuits and Sausage Gravy with Poached Eggs and mushrooms. Best Ive ever had. Others had the baked eggs, fried chicken and avocado toast - everyone was very impressed. We did a bottle of proseco which came with 2 different types of mixers - OJ and Stawberry with basil. The one thing to skip is the ""Deviled eggs"". We got the trio. I tried the pickled pepper one which actually wasn't deviled. It was just a hardboiled egg cut in half. Otherwise everything was really amazing!",,,

Drinks: My dirty martini was super with fresh plump olives. I tried the Mezcel drink ""Bet on Cincy"" off their specialty menu, and it was wonderful!Food/ what we had:- Oysters. Must have the copps island oysters! Mmm ! I think these are my new favorites over blue point. According to the server, the Ribbon has a special agreement, and this Oyster is only distributed to them. Sizable and wonderful.Only negative is the oyster dish/ stand is too high; I  couldn't see the oysters and had to extend my reach too much to access them. I am only 5'2 but hey petite women like to see their food too :)- Chicken. The server recommended this as did my friend, and it was delic! So tender, perfectly flavored and with a light broth that was fantastic.- Burger. My friend ordered their burger and loved it.- Mushrooms side.

Even though it seemed to be a fancy schmancy spot, I still didn't feel too out of place dressed like a tourist in my Nikes and jeans. He has a nose for the next ""whiskey joint"" and we happened upon this place due to blood getting into his liquor stream, and I'm sure I was looking for a semi-clean ladies room too, as I made a beeline to the stairs leading down (where most restrooms seem to be in this city). Having already ate (I'm sure it was pizza or falafel), we just had drinks. Although I did start to get jealous over the plates of oysters floating by me to other salivating patrons. Apparently they serve a shit-ton of oysters, both local and California grown. Being from Cali, I couldn't help but wonder how the local oysters fared in comparison. The bar area is perfect for happy hour and spying on other customers' plates of food - that's my way of deciding on what to order most of the time. We sat at a large communal bar-top style table, complete with ""baby boomer Trivial Pursuit"" game card decks. At the same table sat a couple of guys sharing at least 2 to 3 platters of oysters. They downed them quicker than the oldman downs shots, so I'm sure they were up to par. If I ever visit NY again, I'd seek this place out and do some taste testing of East Coast vs. West Coast oysters. I'm sure it's a pretty serious rivalry.",,,
115,Lisa S.,"New York, NY",27,37,0,2.0,12/31/2016,"Dining at The Ribbon was a frustrating experience. I was excited to finally make it there for dinner as I live a block away. However, I am gluten free and found either the waiter to be uneducated about the menu or unwilling to talk to the chef about what was or could be prepared gluten free. I was told short ribs contained flour and could not be prepared without it. I was also told the lobster and shrimp curry contained soy sauce and couldn't be prepared without it as it's pre-made. Why is a restaurant of this caliber working with pre-made sauces? Instead of offering a gluten free menu or telling me what I could eat, I literally had to go through each entree with the waiter, finding that most items, even polenta, which is naturally gluten free, had gluten. This is actually very ironic as the previous restaurant in this space, Sambuca, was gluten free. In this day in age, a restaurant unwilling to label gluten free items on the menu, or have its chef unwilling to modify items to be gluten free, especially in NYC, is unacceptable. I can't say I'll be back anytime soon. Too bad, because it's a great space.",7,5,

118,Sarah B.,"New York, NY",2,7,4,5.0,10/6/2016,"Came here on a Thursday night at 6 pm and it was a bit quiet, but really started to pick up by 6:30, and by 7:30 every seat was full.  The secret is out that this is one of the best new spots on the UWS.  We were seated in a booth in the back of the restaurant.  I noticed a private room which seats it looked like 10 or so on my way back. Note to self. We started with cocktails, the apricot whiskey smash and a made to order Jalapeño skinny margarita.  Both were delicious with chunky square cubes.  Went for seconds on each drink they were so special (normally we switch it up on the second round). For an app, we split the Buffalo Style Cauliflower which a friend had recommended.  They were a healthy version of chicken wings, such a different combination which really worked well.  They were amazing, I could have eaten an entire order by myself. For mains, we ordered the Oxtail burger served medium rare (which was cooked to perfection) and the Braised Shortribs.  Burger served with fries very similar to those at the spotted pig and the shortribs served over polenta and Brussels sprouts.  The portions are large, and I brought home a large portion of my shortribs because it was filling.  Best of all, there was very very little fat on the shortribs, I HATE fatty shortribs, and these were just perfect.  We saved room for dessert luckily.  We shared the Tres Leches and Espresso Sundae and the Chocolate Bruno (a flourless chocolate cake). I highly recommend both and don't think I could pick a favorite, each rich yummyness.  Service was friendly and helpful, and the water was continually refilled, which I greatly appreciate.  Do not miss this neighborhood gem on the UWS!!!",,,
119,Tamar K.,"New York, NY",249,265,1316,3.0,2/22/2016,"This is really one of the prettiest restaurants in the area. Cool and inviting. Their menu is diverse and well cooked. I've been here twice, and each time I just think the food is great and the waitstaff is lovely and helpful. They don't have notations on their menu about what's gluten free, etc, but they really are incredible about making something in a way that I can eat it. And I really appreciate that. It's definitely not inexpensive, so I wouldn't go often. But definitely check it out. FYI, I went at 4pm and they had an in-between menu, which was fine. Here's the problem, it's inconsistent. I went for lunch today, and although there was only 1 other table there, it took over an hour to get our entrees, and then mine was wrong. I say it's worth checking it out. But dinner is definitely a better menu.",2,,1
120,Mary C.,"New York, NY",83,37,134,5.0,12/17/2016,"So first off my server Brian was a hottie and a rockstar because he was super fast, friendly and efficient. Last time I got such great service was in Paris 2 years ago! Anyhowzza, the food was amazing! I had the entree special a pulled pork sandwich, with coleslaw, grilled corn and a crap load of fries and I swear there was some truffle in there! Had their rose by the glass that was actually decent! And their cocktail list was rather impressive. I wanna come back just for drinks here cause the concoctions look seductive like my neighbors drink was literally whispering my name! Lmao! The ambiance is pretty cool. I love the chandelier crystals at the bar and the wool charm made it ""posh tavern"". Like if a guy brought me for a date I wouldn't be mad! Great for large groups!!!",2,3,2
121,Kitty W.,"Forest Hills, NY",284,386,570,3.0,12/18/2015,"BONE MARROW AND OXTAIL MARMALADE. ULTIMATE WIN. But. But, that's all I can rave about for The Ribbon.Service here was cute. Good, but not amazing as I felt like the staff tried so hard to be friendly, but deep down wanted to get their shift the hell over with. I've also never been a huge fan of dining anywhere uptown. That snooty uptown old people vibe just isn't meant for a soon to be 26 yr old me. The Ribbon is LOUD though. When I walked in, I felt like I was at a bar. But a bar with the elderly, and some snootz. It's so loud that you need to talk over your friends to make sure your voice is heard. The location, environment, people, and staff didn't set a great tone for me for me to even think twice about giving this place more than 3 stars. Would've been downed to a 2 if not for that bone marrow.Food wise - Everything was average except for yes, the bone marrow and oxtail marmalade. The bone marrow was the definition of perfection. My favorite bone marrow by far has been from Toro down in the Meatpacking, but The Ribbon's has me a little confused as to which I like more now. Our table also ordered their flatbread with broccolini and bacon on top, lots of fries, mushrooms as a side, lamb chops, and steak. The mushrooms were a major letdown. Such earthy mushrooms were destroyed by the massive amount of salt used. Same for the lamb chops. My poor lamb chops were barely seared and SO SALTY that my underlips were tingling. This place isn't cheap either. Not overtly expensive but I expected more for the price. Steak and fries at $36 tasted more like $25. My lamb chops at $39 tasted more like $29. Our bill for 5 people + a wee bit of alcohol for 3 of the 5 came out to around $400. The fact that it was a birthday dinner for me had me appreciate this meal a little more, but I wouldn't come here again and wouldn't want any of my friends coming here either.",5,1,1

126,Wendy L.,"Berkeley, CA",672,1239,76,3.0,12/7/2015,My friend was very excited to try this new outpost of the Blue Ribbon restaurant group. We had reservations for 11 am on a Sunday morning which wasn't really necessary given the quantity of tables available.We were disappointed that there weren't any bakery or pastry items to start and share. There was a wide assortment of brunch items and I went with the prime rib poutine because I love both prime rib and poutine. I'd never had a dish like this and wasn't sure how it would come out but it was a bunch of fries covered with cheese sauce and with a medium-thickness cut of prime rib on top. It makes a bit tough to eat since cutting through the prime rib causes you to cut the fries into tiny pieces. The dish was okay but I found the cheese sauce slightly salty and the fries (which are the base of the dish) lacking.,4,,2

128,Ilana L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,3/29/2018,"Ridiculously bad. Waiter spoke a hundred miles an hour with a thick Spanish accent--when we asked him to clarify/repeat he used the same speed and remained indecipherable (and humorless, I might add). He was always rushing, left the table while we were still asking him a question even though the restaurant was far from busy. When my wine glass was empty a busboy swept it away even though there was half a bottle of wine left (chilling away from our table) and when we told our waiter and asked for another glass he thought we were ordering an additional glass of wine--clearly had been keeping zero tabs on our table. Apps arrived literally within 3 minutes of ordering them--felt so rushed, even though place almost empty and prices absurdly expensive given the quality of the whole experience. Foie gras was delicious, however. My friends had the lamb chops which were good. I had the most random pasta dish (only one on menu) with cavatelli, spinach, tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, and.....chicken?! It tasted like airplane pasta. The markup on the wine was laughable--a bottle of cloudy bay sauv blanc from NZ which costs maybe $30 retail was $94!! The whole experience was embarrassing for me since I recommended the place based on one review on the Infatuationnyc website. Bill for 4 people w one bottle of wine, 2 shared apps, 4 mains, and 2 shared desserts was $360 (incl tax and tip). No great loss since I won't be returning, but I really felt strongly about how bad it was, hence why I'm writing this review.",,,

We were seated promptly, the dining area is big but quiet and relaxed. My recommendation would be to get the poutine if you're going here for brunch. It's poutine topped with prime rib and egg. Does it sound gross and excessive? Yes. Was it delicious and worth it? Without a doubt. But everyone else seemed to enjoy their other entrees as well, and our waiter was great.

Though I am a loyal patron of Blue Ribbon on Sullivan St (one of my favorite places in the city), I will never return to this Ribbon location. The staff was very nice, once you got a hold of them, but the service was terrible-extremely slow and hardly touched our table. We had to wait 45 min for extra bread to finish out pâté.

It's TOO LOUD!!!!.The food is really good tho. Especially that bone marrow dish. Amazing. But you know it's also pretty darn expensive. However, it does attractive the most beautiful people of the UWS. So I'd say if you're single and under 35 on the UWS, with good hearing, then it's a good vibey bar to hang out in. I guess the older you are the more the noise is going to bother you. Maybe this is a smart strategic decision - keep the old people out by making it too loud.

The overall decor is very nice, on par with all the usual Blue Ribbon family of spots. It's a larger place than i thought. The service was ok. the waiter was nice, but not as attentive as we would have liked. we went for long periods without seeing him. i had the chicken quinoia bowl and my girlfriend had the burger. My bowl was pretty solid. not too much excitement to be had from that but solid. The burger was good but really small. and they forgot the cheese which we had ordered. no bread was given before our meal.  We also asked if the roasted chicken came with anything and the waiter said no, it came a la carte. But we noticed later that the table next to us had ordered it and it came with mashed potatoes. Strange.The really nice thing they did was we had asked for a glass of wine at the end to split for us, and they automatically split it into 2 glasses for us which was very nice. Overall- a little too expensive for the food/experience. 2 stars for the food and experience, 1 star because at least the staff was pleasant if not attentive.",,,1

144,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,5.0,5/6/2016,"If you read all the bad reviews, you can see that they were written by fake profiles who have no friends and hardly any reviews, if you read the good reviews, you can see that they were written by Yelpers with extensive profiles. Someone is obviously out to smear the Ribbon on Yelp, which is a shame because a lot of people, including me, rely on these reviews to decide where to eat. Take it from me and my 600+ reviews, that I will be providing you a legit review.I was so pleasantly surprised by the Ribbon - every time I passed by, I could just hear the loud and exuberant energy from here. The front room does get incredibly and uncomfortably loud (wish they could do something about the acoustics). However, there is a back dining room, equally elegant and charming that is much quieter and well suited for a nice dinner and conversation. I would suggest you reserve a table in this back room.The cozy, woodsy interior is decorated in a library theme, your bill is presented inside the pages of an old book. Dim light bulbs add a romantic feel. You can even look through the windows to see into the kitchen. We had a well-mannered and sweet waiter. The manager was also pacing (in a good way) the dining room saying hello and making sure all the patrons were happy. Their food is probably one of the best I've had at any restaurant on the UWS. We started with a round of oysters. I highly recommend them - get a few of the East Coast - they're sweet and delicious and fresh, they're washed very well, no gritty sand in them. They also brought us a complimentary app (or an amuse bouche you might say) - arancini (stuffed rice balls) - delish. I ordered the bronzino - so well cooked and well seasoned. Perfectly flaky and perfectly crispy skin. And two good pieces too. It does not come with a side, so you can order one if you're really hungry. My companion ordered the Ribbon steak, which he liked. For dessert, we had the Ribbon chocolate chip bread pudding, which was a little misleading because it contained no chocolate chips, rather melted chocolate sauce, and no pudding, but a piece of plain pound cake topped with vanilla ice cream. The cake was a bit dry, but the ice cream was really good. My cabernet was perfect. Such a fantastic and lovely dinner we had here. I cannot wait to come back and try more of the menu. The pictures of their bloody mary look so good - I will have to come back for brunch.",9,1,4

(I do not give these away) The staff were all super friendly yet knew everything there was to know about the menu and restaurant in general. They were the type of staff you look forward to conversing with, as in I was excited to ask what they recommend and their favorites.I had the spicy tomatillo margarita which was right up my alley. Perfect amount of spicy while giving you a refreshed taste. We started with the buffalo cauliflower which was amazing. I was presently surprised on how well the cauliflower represented the buffalo and the celery accompaniment added the perfect crunch.   We then indulgent in a ""perfect charcuterie board. I mean perfect as in two types of cured meats, a pate, three cheeses and all the sides to perfect each bite such as pickled veggies, mustard's, jams, honey, nuts, etc. I then had the Butchers Salad for my main course and I will have it again any day! first of all it is topped with pulled meats that they prepare over a spit fire so the texture and taste was perfect. The salad had high quality blue cheese crumbled in it which gave it a wonderful sharp taste to cut some of the meat fat. There were succulent cherry tomatoes on top that I could not get enough of. I know it is just a salad but it is hard to come by a perfectly balanced salad these days. We had a few sides as well and my favorites were the roasted carrots and spaetzle which is a fancy sub for mac n cheese lovers. We finished the night with two sundaes. A dolce de leche and hot fudge. Well worth the stuffed feel (I had a long walk back to my hotel). Another note, the decor is on fleek! I cannot wait to go back during my next NYC visit.",1,,

I think though that our waiter steered us the wrong way and that really hurt how we felt. He pushed me to get the Ribbon Dip and it was really blah tasting.

We were seated at a large table in the main dining area, which itself was nice, although the table was a touch too large for even six people to sit around; I found that I had to almost yell for the person across the table to hear me. For our meal, we split the 3 pates and the bone marrow to start, which were solid (I found the chicken liver pate to be my favorite). I had the ox burger for my entree, which was also pretty tasty and a little different flavor from a normal burger, and it came with fries that were very well prepared and went very well with the sauce from the accompanying burger.

159,Ali M.,"New York, NY",31,234,245,4.0,2/28/2016,"IN SHORT: Part of the Blue Ribbon restaurant empire, this spacious New American outpost on the Upper West Side is surprisingly perfect for any meal of the day, and will easily become your favorite restaurant in the neighborhood.THE STORY: From sushi to fried chicken, Blue Ribbon restaurants have managed to develop a portfolio as diverse and individualistic as the neighborhoods they call home, and somehow, from the Lower East Side now to the Upper West, quality is not lost among such breadth.It's ultimately a wise strategy, for if one brand of restaurant should fall out of favor or fashion, the empire is not left scrambling for survival. At The Ribbon in particular, this strategy can be felt within the restaurant itself. At both a brunch and dinner in recent weeks, it's clear that The Ribbon's appeal is vast and deep, ensuring its rightful presence in the neighborhood for a long time to come.Craving an elegant piece of salmon on Friday, but would prefer to end your Sunday with a large portion of fried chicken and southern sides? The Ribbon offers it all, dressing up a wide range of American classics just enough to set them apart from the crowd of other so-so restaurants on the Upper West Side, and to lodge them in your culinary memory until you just have to return again for more.At dinner, the Sliced Hangar Steak is one of these dishes, whose thick, rich, green peppercorn sauce lends the perfect amount of vegetal acidity to the decadently tender cuts of beef. The delicate shoestring fries on the side are no joke either, somehow maintaining their crispy exterior even when soaking in the sauce for a few minutes.The wide-reaching menu also offers house-made pâté and a butcher board of meats and cheeses, but the Beef Marrow with Oxtail Marmalade should be the appetizer everyone rushes toward. Sweet and buttery, the marrow is the perfect spread over charred challah toast topped with small leaves of fried parsley for an ethereally crispy, herbal finish.While dinners at the restaurant can feel crowded and boisterous quickly, brunches tend to be more subdued, as families with strollers and friends sipping on Bloody Marys while watching the latest football game sit side by side in peace.The eats at this nebulous weekend meal are also satisfying to all walks of life on the Upper West. Of course there is Avocado Toast with cherry tomatoes, radishes, chia seeds, and espelette pepper on a thin, sometimes too-soft piece of whole-grain bread, and of course there is Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon for a lighter, saltier, and brinier plate.But there is also The Pig Club, a hearty sandwich with rotisserie pork, smoked bacon, pickled jalapenos, and provolone for a less traditional, arguably spicier brunch. The thick slices of pork find home here in a crunchy, airy hero bun, with perhaps a bit too much bread for the otherwise great pileup of ingredients.And then there is the Prime Rib Poutine, featuring, obviously, a thick, tender, perfectly pink slice of prime rib topped with a fried egg over french fries, sauteed onions, and a thin cheddar gravy.As my Canadian boo so eloquently put it, ""That's not poutine."" He's right, it's not, but I've come to wonder, is anything actually poutine? It seems the Canadians have such a monopoly on these gravy-cheese-curd-fries, that it's possible I've never had poutine in my life. I suppose I'll have to go to Montreal to find out.But like so much at The Ribbon, this poutine-inspired plate is remarkably flavorful and satisfying, without feeling like a brick of carbs and fat was just dropped into your digestive tract. Against the backdrop of The Ribbon's spacious, retro vibes, and next to one of the restaurant's ""design your own"" Bloody Marys, there's ultimately not much to complain about.Sometimes there is an incremental cost to achieving and maintaining flexibility in restaurants, but The Ribbon shows no signs of struggling. A success across cuisines and times of the day, many restaurants could learn a thing or two from this American classic in the making.",7,2,3

161,Dana R.,"New York, NY",0,21,0,2.0,5/21/2016,"Came here twice for brunch with friends. The first time we thought the service was a bit strange (waiter was pretty inattentive and had a hard time getting him to come over when we needed something), but we chalked it up to maybe a busy section, despite the fact that half the restaurant was empty.Fast forward to my second visit here, again for brunch, and I've come to the conclusion that the service is just freaking strange. Maybe that speaks to why you can walk in and easily get a table sans reservation. We ordered the hummus appetizer - could this place be more stingy than the two pieces of bread that come with it? The waiter couldn't have been more obvious that he wanted us to leave - brought the check over without us even asking for it, and then charged my card before my friend could even put her card down to split the bill.This place is just plain weird, but their loss- we probably would have ordered a few more drinks had they not pushed us out the door beforehand!",1,,1
162,Larry S.,"Demarest, NJ",1,65,0,4.0,5/21/2017,"We were looking for something different for an informal family dinner.  Boy did this place hit the spot!  I would give The Ribbon 4.5 stars if I could, as there were only minor imperfections.We started with a Caesar salad and the Meatballs.  The Caesar  was big enough and came to the table split for 2.  The romaine was fresh, and the dressing was neither too salty or garlicky.  The meatballs were also great, though at $17 a bit pricey.For our mains, we had the Ribbon Steak, a special Fried Chicken Sandwich, both accompanied by hot and crispy fries, and both were also excellent.  But the real prize was the Butchers Salad, a collections of meats - pulled chicken, prime rib, brisket, pork and bacon over romaine with the roasted mushrooms we ordered as a side.  It was a perfect dish.  Deserts included the bread pudding and flourless chocolate cake, both served with ice cream that was as good as the desserts themselves.While the service was excellent, with special kudos to the bus staff, who cleared the tables timely and kept our water filled.  This is obviously due to excellent management - as this is an area where a restaurant often falls short.A great place that we are looking to return to (from NJ, no less) soon.",,,

The crowd was chic, the lighting was perfect - not too bright and perfect dimmed light, the service was excellent (our server Mohammed was super attentive, knowledgeable about the menu & what recommendations to make & really made our experience wonderful), the food was delicious, plenty of bar space in the entrance area, and the hostesses at front were quick to assist when we arrived with a reservation from OpenTable. We didn't wait even 1 minute before getting seated. The venue is pretty large - great for birthdays & large parties - and the open kitchen sheltered by the glass window in the back part of the restaurant was cool to see the kitchen staff whip out the delish food.The braised short ribs dish for $33 was one of THE BEST dishes I have ever ordered in NYC, ever. Perfectly made and so hearty & filling. The food came our fairly quickly which was awesome as we were starving. The half amish chicken dish ($25 I believe) was a generous portion of chicken - excellent & tender, but came as is, no side dishes or garnish, so would be better to order & share and order a side veggie dish w/ it for next time. The desserts: big selection. The Blue Ribbon chocolate bread pudding ($12) was amazing.... came w/ ice-cream, tasted great. All in all - one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in NYC.

Luckily, there were a lot of delicious options. I had the huevos rancheros with a side of bacon. Great balance of flavors and good texture. Loved the pops of fresh avocado.

172,Lisa J.,"Central Park, NY",2,8,6,5.0,4/1/2017,Had a great experience today with some friends at The Ribbon. We had a toddler with us who was starving and they quickly helped us get some french fries for her before we ordered our meals and drinks. They also were very quick to deliver our food and brought any condiments we needed. There was plenty of seating around lunch time on a Saturday with or without an Open Table reservation. Best of all their caesar salad was fantastic - all of us enjoyed it and highly recommend! Will definitely return when on the UWS.,,,
173,Nina N.,"Queens, New York, NY",322,116,24,1.0,12/26/2015,"Woah. This lunch was my second visit since I work in the area and find most of the restaurants in this type of category to be lacking. The first time I went for drinks at the bar so this was my first time sitting at a full service table. The upper west side definitely needs more of this style of restaurant... Cozy, casual yet still appropriate for a romantic evening if you chose to do so.Service this time around was so terrible that I'm really not sure I want to come back. There may have been only one server on the floor- and during the holidays call outs and no shows are the norm- but if that was the case a manager should have DEFINITELY been on the flood to drive service. I was without water (nor did a server acknowledge us for about 10 minutes). When he did come by he didn't ask us about drinks- just if we were ready to order yet. Okay. Maybe you are having a bad day. Maybe you're writing off me and my friend as lame ladies who lunch. To make things worse, I ordered a glass of wine way before we even ordered food and it didn't arrive until we were halfway through our apps (which was our entree but more on that later). When they asked if I wanted a second glass I hesitated- of course I wanted another one! I just didn't have to wait for it! I obliged, and again it didn't drop til we were halfway through our entrees! Really bizarre stuff....Remember when I said ""more on that later""? Well we've arrived. Oddly, our main course hits the table before our meat and cheese board. I'm a little unsure as to why this happened. lol. Food is food is food though!! About the cheese and meat board: I feel like it could have been a bit more inventive and the bread was really lacking- it was glorified breakfast toast (which if you're gonna serve it you might as well come up with a seasonal dip or spread - which would also be low cost!- that would also complement the components of the board to fatten it up a bit) I really wish service weren't so terrible this last time around. I'll give it another try in 2016... If you do decide to drop by the cauliflower app is a must order! I've never seen it before and I probably could've taken a shot of the blue cheese dip it's served with. (Because I am fat fat fat!)Anyways. My complaints here really aren't about the food. I think sitting at the bar is a much, much better way to enjoy yourself, and perhaps there is a better meal period than lunch to dine here. (It really pained me to write this)",3,2,1

We were lucky enough to be seated in a cute private dining area that provided a quiet and more intimate setting. Our entire meal was delicious! I particularly enjoyed the raw oysters, the housemade pate (I highly recommend this to all the pate lovers out there - - I couldn't get enough), housemade flatbread, the lobster and shrimp curry (perfect for the autumn season) and sticky toffee pudding.

This place had a downtown vibe (filled dining room, didn't clear out at 9:00 or even 10:00 and the average age of diners was lower than my mother but higher than my nieces) and the food and drink were very good.  Service was also very friendly.Baked meatball app and the braised short rib main were standouts.  Pastas were very good, but the pasta special was a fairly small portion.  Nice wine list.I'd definitely return on a night I want to stay uptown.",3,,2

I went with the breakfast sandwich with sausage, avocado, and egg and it was so bland I had to add ketchup to every bite to taste anything. The salad that came with it was soggy and gross.  I didn't touch it. The decor was nice and that was gonna salvage this rating to a two star, but then we got the bill and for two people, our brunch meal came out to $100 (with tip), so I had to knock it down to one star.  So grossly priced and so underwhelming it's not even funny.",2,,

At the end of the night we saw the matre'd chowing on steak at a table next to us which was just weird. - Food was ok. Butchers plate was great. Mains were all average. Burger came out with a piece of bread as the bun. When we complained about a burger having bread as a bun they said it was because they ran out of brioche buns. Why they wouldn't admit it upfront is beyond me. Salmon was raw (not undercooked, raw)- Don't try to get refills on water - that doesn't happen.",5,2,1

Updated review","The initial experience was ok... Sat at the bar for my guest to arrive.  The bartendar was friendly and fast to serve my drink. Sat at the back of the restaurant.  We were greeted and read the specials.  The waiter was a bit pompous and seemed to be annoyed he was there and had to serve us.  He rushed to take our order and seemed upset when we asked for more time. I order the oyster deviled eggs (amazing) and my guest got the special watermelon salad, which was also good. She ordered a burger (it was overcooked as she ordered MR and got MW) and I got the prime rib sandwich.  The prime rib sandwich was dry and flavorless.  The liquid of the au jus was sadly missing, as I expect it to be beef broth with a lot of juice and flavor. It was mainly onions and very little jus.  I may go back and sit at the bar, but will probably never go for entrees.  I would get the deviled eggs again!!!  The waiter was obnoxious to be honest.  I like to have a good service experience.  Service was a 2 at the most.  Food a 3. Decor a 3. Too bad, because we need another nice place on the UWS desperately.",1,,1

I saw pictures of the tres leches sundae and was immediately sold!Came here last night and really REALLY enjoyed my experience. Our server, Isaac was AMAZING and one of my favorite things about this place! He was warm, welcoming and so sweet. I had the beef burger and I sub'd the french fries with the creamed spinach at no extra charge ( loved that that was even an option). The buffalo cauliflower was seriously out of this world, I'm contemplating going back today to get some more because it was that delicious. I'm all about first impressions/vibes and my only critique was that the hostess (young lady-brown hair?) at the front could have been a little warmer without me first mentioning that we had a reservation. However the gentlemen that directed us to our table was patient and also very kind. The busboys were really friendly and made sure to clean our table in between our meals thoroughly.

We had the Buffalo Cauliflower to start, which was yummy, if not a tad heavy on the sauce - if you love buffalo sauce and want to feel slightly better about your wing craving, this is perfect. We shared the chicken entree and the french dip sandwich - the chicken portion was generous, the dip for the sandwich was unique, and the fries were awesome. We shared a side of the mushrooms, which could have nearly been an entree as it was large and delicious. We ended the meal with a tres leches sundae, which was also great.The service was wonderful and the staff were attentive and kind. We recommend visiting this new UWS spot and will return soon!---Background:We initially had a bad experience with The Ribbon as our reservation was unexpectedly canceled and there was not much sympathy when we called about it. After posting to Yelp about their odd cancelation policy (you have to call to confirm), we received a note from the owner within a day or two, who generously offered to bring us to the restaurant as his guests to make up for the initial poor experience.

Our server promptly went over the specials but my friend and I passed and picked straight from the menu. We had Butter Lettuce salad and opted for the Green Goddess dressing which was too die for.  The salad was perfect, I am beyond particular when it comes to salad. I feel a lot of restaurants just throw lettuce into a bowl but this was clean, no wilted leaves and dry. We also had the seafood salad - which I was surprised at how much I loved it as I am not a huge seafood fan but my friend is, so we ordered it.  Totally going to have it again as it was perfect. Our main was the Half Amish Chicken - I am a big chicken fan and this was delish with the medley roasted mushroom  - perfect combo. And to finish this meal we both got dessert, I had the Sticky Toffee Pudding, the portion was amazing and I was in heaven. Besides the amazing food, the service was great.  Everything was brought to us promptly, our water glasses didn't go empty which is kinda an important thing for me as I guzzle water.  My friend is gluten free and they knew right away what she could and couldn't eat.  Overall this was a top notch experience and I can't wait to go again and try the burger which looked AMAZING.",1,,1

My friend and I had the buffalo cauliflower to start which was a tasty/healthier version of a chicken wing app but with all the flavor you'd hope for.  Then it was onto delicious bone marrow and potato latkes with salmon and caviar.  Highly recommend the flavorfully rich lobster and shrimp curry main that I'll definitely be coming back for and how could I forget the drinks?

Updated review","Update!My husband and I have been back to The Ribbon a number of times since the first time, and we have been much happier!1. The food (obviously the most important part) does not disappoint! We love the deviled eggs, especially with the fried oysters! I also love the oxtail burger. We've tried a number of items on the menu, and even finally had the famous fried chicken, and it did not disappoint!2. The drinks (obviously the next important part) -- we love the variety and the inventiveness. They have specials from time to time, and those are awesome too.3. The service -- because of our proximity, we go to The Ribbon pretty often, and we are happy to feel like ""regulars"" -- exactly what you want for a neighborhood restaurant!4. The noise -- it seems to me that they have adjusted the volume of the music so it isn't so loud. The music would have been fine (and we like the music that they play), it just bounces off the floors and walls and makes it impossible to hear. But, when we were there last night, we were seated in a quiet section and had wonderful conversation!All in all, we are very happy with the improvements The Ribbon has made and plan to continue to be regulars!",1,,
199,Crystal T.,"New York, NY",28,86,0,4.0,6/22/2015,"Please fix the bone marrow! (It's not served like the signature dish at Blue Ribbon Brasserie downtown) It felt a little skimpy at The Ribbon. Thumbs up for everything else during the soft opening! Sunday fried chicken (as expected), prime rib of pork (exceeded expectations), amish chicken, fingerlings and oysters all were delicious! As mentioned above, the bone marrow was decent, but just wasn't the same.I'm so excited for this long anticipated addition to the neighborhood and will be back often!",5,,
