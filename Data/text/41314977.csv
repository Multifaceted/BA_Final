0,Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",5000,1213,6241,4.0,11/7/2018,"It's a little off here, and I mean that in the best way possible. It seems like a townie bar you would find upstate somewhere, but here it is right off of the west side hwy. Come early to grab a seat and you'll probably stay longer than anticipated. It's unpretentious enough to give immediate comfort to the right kind of crowd (if your friend doesn't like this bar, stay here, get a new friend). They have a drink menu that has some frozen items on it, which are great, and kudos to the bartenders for being able to handle all of the orders with seemingly one single blender. Sure, there's a duder behind the bar that should pivot from his current profession and maybe not be customer facing, but there are a few others that are super nice and work their tails off. Overall, a fun dive and welcome watering hole in the area. Remember to get a seat early and you're all set! Bonus: happy hour!",12,3,12
1,Kimberly L.,"East Meadow, NY",755,37,35,3.0,10/10/2018,"Went here on a Saturday night around 9:30PM it wasn't super crowded. Chill atmosphere with booths, couches, and a pool table. Decor is really nice. Two bathrooms so you never really have to wait long to use them. Great to come here with a group of friends. Come early if you want to secure seats for you and your friends. Drinks are good, shots are large. Most of my friends got the rusty knot drink.Before coming, I saw a few negative reviews about the bartenders which proved to be true when I went. My friend paid $20 extra in cash so she could get back change for tip, except and the bartender took it upon herself to keep $10 for herself and only give her $10 change back.. she took her own tip and we still had to ask for salt with our tequila shots.I really like this place besides for the bartenders but not sure if I'd go back.",1,,

Well...Life's a beach bar at the Rusty Knot! Near the West Side Highway this little bar has a lot of personality, and offers first come first serve seating, and a pool table with friendly patrons ready to play a game. A mainstay for years with a myriad of chefs managing the menus over the years, Rusty Knot has somehow found it's happy sweet spot and has settled in.  Is it late? Perhaps you are hungry? Well, If your tummy is grumbling the al pastor here will satisfy your salty dawg of a tongue, and a dark and stormy will refresh your spirits after a long day. Three tacos easily shared, and guacamole made our day. Came here with some friends who were visiting from out of town and we had a blast.

7,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4582,2943,8900,4.0,6/27/2016,"I never want to begrudge someone else's success, because I like to think that I'm not a hater. Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that whether or not you enjoy The Rusty Knot is entirely dependent on how crowded the place is. When uncrowded, The Rusty Knot feels like the platonic ideal of a beach bar [in Manhattan, where there is no beach]. You can grab a seat in a booth, sip on their namesake drink (basically a tasty blended mojito) and nibble on a pretzel dog as the sun sets and the light coming in the west-facing windows Instagram-filters your life into perfection. But on the lazy summer Saturdays when this is everything you want, oftentimes everyone else has the same idea...and it can ruin the fun. That's when it's wall to wall people, you order a Tecate because beer in a can means there's a chance you could get it this year, you can't get food because they'll never find you, there's nowhere to sit, and a straight woman and her gay best friend fake having sex in the bathroom for god knows what reason (this might not happen to you, but we're all still a little baffled by it). So I'd appreciate it if The Rusty Knot could throw out 70% of their customers before I arrive, from now on. Seriously though, this place is great when it isn't packed. Get over there, but not when I'm going.",12,17,7
8,Claire B.,"Manhattan, NY",34,103,18,3.0,6/3/2018,"Great spot for tiki bar lovers although getting there is a bit of a pain (it is insanely far west, practically on the Hudson and no where near any train stations).

9,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3176,11053,4.0,9/8/2016,"Sometimes, it's best to not have any expectations at all. My friend kept talking up this place because he saw it on a TV show once about Dark and Stormy's. I (uncharacteristically) didn't Yelp the place, so I was surprised by how awesome it was.It's nautical themed (duh), complete with wood paneling and all the shiply accoutrements (anchors, life preservers, etc.). It feels like a dive bar on a boat, basically.Their cocktails are all about $13, except for their signature Rusty Knot (which is a frozen mojito at $11). As advertised, the Dark & Stormy was pretty damn well made. Their signature drink was also perfect for summer and just the right amount of slushy.They have an above-average bar food menu as well. Things like tacos al pastor and pretzel dogs. Only opted for some chips since we had reservations at Spotted Pig (which was a complete coincidence, I had no idea the two places were affiliated. This is what happens when I don't Yelp a place beforehand).All in all, super cool spot on the west side. A bit of a trek, but fun.",,,
10,Dion C.,"New York, NY",145,75,310,1.0,4/13/2018,"They do not know how to make a maitai,  dark-stormy or zombie. All juice, little alcohol. Sugar and water for $13 is not a fair trade. All show, no go.",,,
11,MandA R.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",197,1052,2826,3.0,2/21/2016,"Came here on a Saturday around 4pm, not expecting it to be so crowded. There were large groups of people everywhere and many people seemed to know each other within the separate large groups. After standing near the bar, we were able to grab a seat in the middle for our second round. We took in the atmosphere and enjoyed ""people-watching"" around us. The decor is great and I loved the bathroom ""ship"" doors. The large windows allow a good amount of light to come in, adding to the lively feel of this place.From the 4 drinks I tried (all between $11-$13): Spiced Colada was the best. Frozen heaven. The Rusty Knot was frozen too and minty and wasn't my favorite. The Dark & Stormy was strong and pretty good. The Mai Thai was strong and really, really good! Both the Dark & Stormy and the Mai Thai are not frozen. If I were to come back I'd stick with the Mai Thai and Spiced Colada. It was expensive for 2 rounds for 2 people plus a pretzel dog (around $65 after tip) but I think we'd stop back in and switch to beer after one tiki drink next time.",1,,

13,Christina P.,"Culver City, CA",4712,2086,3963,3.0,5/9/2016,"Let it be said that I love kitschy bars like this, and the drinks here were actually delish. I loved the Rusty Knot, which is a fresh, not too sweet frozen mojito type concoction. They also had a couple of drinks that came in fake coconut cups, which is always a bonus. I loved the nautical decor and the crowd seemed to really embrace the theme, some of them arriving in full nautical costumes for a birthday gathering. That, however, was also one of the problems with this place. It was sooooo crowded. I know, I know, a crowded bar is to be expected on a Saturday evening, but it was truly impossible to move. If you're lucky enough to grab a seat or a little corner with some surface space for your drink, hold on to that sucker and don't let go. Beyond the crowd though, the main downside for me was the service at the bar. Unenthusiastic bartenders are nothing new, but the guy behind the bar here looked like he was seconds away from strangling his next customer. Though the coconut cup drinks and the frozen Rusty Knot were crowd favorites, many people were afraid to order them because any time you asked for something that required a little extra work, the bartender looked at you with pure hatred. He also may have been Kid Rock, in which case I understand why he'd be bummed to find himself working a bar at this point in his career. But what's the point of having fun drinks if people are too intimidated to order them from you?! It's a small place, and obviously very popular, and with that comes crowds and a lot of work for a bartender. But, sorry to say, that's kind of what you signed up for (both the bartender and the patrons), so you're just gonna have to suck up that frozen minty beverage and deal with it!",11,8,7
14,Alexandra L.,"Manhattan, NY",1021,679,2376,3.0,3/27/2015,"The Quick: Solid 3.5 stars with fun decor, pretty good food, and great drinks. The Details: You walk into the Rusty Knot and feel as if your transported to some local bar out east in Montauk or some old beach town. The decor is very relaxed and beachy, to match the fun drinks served in coconuts and tiki cups. There was a weird damp smell, but hopefully that was just a one time thing. The music unfortunately does not match the beach theme (love me some jimmy buffet) but the vibe is still great. The crowd is upper 20s-30s, very relaxed with some playing pool, some casually drinking, and others taking shots. Overall a good mix. Our group ordered a ton of food, and I'm happy to report it was very decent. Better that average bar food, with a plethora of options. The chicken quesadillas were average, the spicy potato wedges were really good, Guac was good (as always), pickles were strangely amazing, and everyone seemed to love the pretzel dogs. The Damage: Beer was cheap while the tropical drinks or a little pricey from $11-$13... There didn't seem to be a happy hour special. Overall a very cool spot very different than what I'm used to especially in the area. Would return",2,1,3

I come from the NW where you can find nautical bars a plenty. However, when it comes to NY, it's like a needle in a haystack! Boy was I ecstatic when my husband took me here. He always knows what I will be head over heels with. There was everything I am looking for, from 60's plastic covered chairs, plastic mermaid in my boozy slurpee and do my eyes deceive me.....spaceage felt on the pool table! I dabble with pool but I am far from a fan. But if we were talking about this table, I might consider a league. Ha! The only down side is that this place does not have those dive bar prices I am looking for. It's super pricey because of the neighborhood. I still had a Tecate ($5) after my cocktail ($11) and played a couple rounds of pool. The clientele is also not the old people and rockers that I would like but hey perfect spot for an afternoon drink with some buddies.  Plan B come here for happy hour M-F 4-7...or a Tuesday when it's happy hour allllll day!",5,2,2

I am the girl from Saturday (well, I suppose Sunday) who could not find her car and thankfully stumbled into this bar. I want to thank the incredibly kind bouncer and his friends who made me feel better and let me charge my dead phone inside despite closing time. Moreover, he reassured me that it was ok to return if I still could not find my car once I was ready to leave again.

Living in Brooklyn and only having moved there a month ago, I have had zero experience with the West Village thus far. Thus, part of the fun of going there was meandering through the impossibly quaint and quiet streets along the way. It was just lovely. As others have said, it's definitely a bit of a hike from the subway, but it's still walkable.The look of the place was a little weird. The wooden panels reminded me of someone's basement. I feel like that would have been depressing had it been located anywhere but New York, but when living in a city of high-rises and such, it was kind of nice to feel like you were in someone's basement. I just had one drink there - the Rusty Knot, which is a frozen mojito - and it was delicious and quite sweet. My friend got really excited that they had pickle backs. I think others had dark and stormys. We also ordered chips and guac, which were an amazing snack. We did, however, have to watch the prepared dish sit at the back of the bar for about 5 minutes before we finally had to let the bartenders know that those were probably the chips we ordered, and we would like to eat them now, please.There wasn't much else going on here, other than the good food and drinks, juke box, and fish tank. I feel like it's more of a place you'd stop in to for one or two drinks before moving along. A pleasant stop on a pub crawl, perhaps.

I also tried their signature drink (The Rusty Knot Cocktail or something like that - $10.) It was delicious! So good! It's a blended drink that's very reminiscent of a mojito.

In theory, this is quite puzzling. However, upon entering the bar, things become a lot clearer, before becoming hazy again (this time from imbibing).The name is great and the drinks are even better. Busch regular/normal on tap, picklebacks (spicy if you choose) and a slew of signature bevvies, including a Dark & Stormy that's for ginger lovers only. It looks like your grandmother's basement, sans musty smell, avec wood paneling and pool table. And then there's the fish tank - you gotta love bars with fish tanks. Not only does it help the decor, but it says something about the clientele: Sophisticated enough not to break (or steal fish from) a 100 gallon aquatic tank.Pretzels dogs! There isn't much else to say about the food, other than the fact that the pretzel dog is pretty darn good.Saturday night barkeep extraordinaire ""Ryan"" is the best. After several picklebacks, he gave us samplings of the cleverly named mixed beverages while explaining each drink's ingredients, history and whatnot. It was quite a treat.

When I came here the first time, I was with a group that frequents this bar, they insisted I get the drink ""the Rusty Knot"". I tend to give in easily to peer pressure, so that was my drink for the night. I liked it.The bar seems to cater toward a youngish audience. I have been back a few other times, and the crowd has been pretty diverse each time, but seems to be mostly young 20somethings. There is also a pool table in this bar, if you like playing pool.

This place is how I believe Hugh Hefner envisions his afterlife - wood paneling, comfortable seating, a fish tank, the illusion of being inside of a ship, and the peace and quiet he's been dreaming of, devoid of any nagging blond-haired concubines. C'mon, he's already half-way to his personal Valhalla, playing dress-up as a boat captain these days anyway.The passengers aboard the Rusty Knot aren't the buxom, fake-tanned lot, however. Promiscuous, maybe, but this bunch is a bit edgier - and I use this in the most endearing way possible. They're trendy, no doubt, but I'm not so sure they're gonna use this as a pre-game for the Meatpacking District a few blocks away. The Rusty Knot is cool, but not quite pretentious-cool.They sell dollar beers as their happy hour special. Sure, they're Busch, but they're a dollar! They also offer Tecate, served the way they're supposed to be served - in a can, with a lime, and salt on the rim. This alone made me a happy customer. There are a handful of tropical specialty cocktails available in tiki cups (complete with plastic toy mermaid!), which are on the more expensive side given the prices on the rest of their bar menu, but they certainly pack a punch. A word to the wise - the four-dollar pretzel dogs are just the trick before diving into a keg's worth of cheap beer specials with your crew. Might help in soaking up any ill-advised pickle back shots, too. Ahoy!",4,2,4

It feels like you are on a yacht from the 80's, complete with fish tank, plush captain swivel chairs, porthole windows, and 'autographed' photos from your favorite celebs -- Andrew Mcartney, what what!I tried the Rusty Knot ($8) and it was reminiscent of a drink I had at Painkiller - minty, slushy, delicious--at half the price. My friend ordered the pretzel hot dog ($4) which was very yummy. We played pool for two rounds at the down-right-cheap rate of .50 per game. The bar had a great mix of people, not too crowded but busy on a Tuesday night. Also of note, 2 for 1 Tuesday includes beer and well drinks.

The cheesy leisure boat interior, whose equal I've only experienced in Yarmouth seafood buffets. It is a look back to the specific East Village trends that spawned restaurants serving just rice pudding or pork sandwiches. Refreshing in our generic American farm to table times.The 80s Bikini Bottom theme is applied with thoughtful tackiness. Just at my well worn table the decor went from wheels and rope stuck to the warm paneling to the silly lobster still life's with people intruding in them, and vintage Anheuser Busch clock. The parrothead effect is intimate and the kitsch complete as a Leisure Suit Larry dollhouse... It is more like a theater set than a bar. They were playing my favorite trashy reggae music when I got there and ordered a Makers Mark. The gregarious bartenders let me have a Rusty Knot and citrusy shot on the house because I wanted to try it. The Rusty Knot is a lovely mojito like drink. The chips and guac are boring.A pretty, catlike girl took up the DJ booth and started playing straight Kenny Loggins yacht rock. The atmosphere was scattered and relaxed. The regulars, golden youth gay and straight, pretty West Village women socialized in booths and played pool. I got the fuck out of there because no one came to sit with me.",,2,

However, the Rusty Knot can be significantly less than great when, unfortunately, its management is left to bartenders that, if not playfully disinterested in the drinks they serve go out of their way to make their paying guests feel as if they're out of line for ordering food PRIOR to the kitchen's closing. I've come to this bar for at least 8 years, and I've always loved it for its lack of pretension. Tonight, the Rusty Knot fulfilled every cheap New York stereotype it's been so adept at avoiding in the past. The bartender, seemingly influenced by Kid Rock, was outright rude in denying our party's request for food, despite this request coming a full fifteen minutes before the kitchen closed. At 1:45 on a crowded Saturday night, we couldn't order the sloppy joes they purported to serve until 2:00. What's worse, we couldn't have been treated worse in that denial. This is only the second Yelp! review I've written. It's a shame that this once great bar has fallen victim to the same trite douche-baggery it once was so adept at avoiding",2,1,

At least I can make a contribution to the RK? This bar was very crowded and mind you, there was one bartender. Another bartender would appear at times but there was a long wait.

I'm gonna check this place out on a Friday night to see if the four stars holds up.",,,1

It was practically empty, a Monday, so we checked the drink specials just for kicks and went on our way.Two days later, a Wednesday, we walked past the Rusty Knot again.  This time the bar is packed!  An eclectic mix of folk, everything from hipsters to business types, and sailor wannabes, all drinking the signature house drink ""the Rusty Knot"".  So we did as the natives, and ordered some for ourselves.  The bar has a descent amount of seating, and we were able to watch the sunset over the water.  Not a bad place for an unexpected drink on a Wednesday afternoon off the west-side highway.I almost expect to walk back one day soon and find the bar missing, as if it were all some strange illusion.

96,Phoebe L.,"New York, NY",95,42,0,2.0,6/4/2011,"Maybe it was just the night we went there....THE DRINKS:I ordered the famous Rusty Knot and my pal ordered a Skinny Margarita... utterly disgusting. I don't know if they spice their drinks with what's scraped off the floor, but they were the worst cocktails I've had to date, and my cocktail drinking experiences well predate when I could drink legally.OK so we tried again. Maybe it's just a bad round. Next was the Mai Tai and Spiced Colada.....revolting.  Lesson learned....order a beer. Which are cheap and in a can.THE FOOD:We ordered the tacos. Not edible. The tortillas were cold and dry and the mystery meat inside made them pretty much inedible. I picked at the meat and tasted it and then realized I was just torturing myself and they werent worth the calories. The bartender looked at our quasi-eaten taco and was perplexed. He said he'd never seen the torillas left before. I didn't get rude but I thoguht ""have you ever ordered it??"" The other bartender was a vegan. I think I might join her on that. I heard the preztel dog is good though... but the person who told me it was amazing was the same girl who said the Rusty KNot was delicious. Bleck!THE CLIENTELE:I was taught that if you can't say something nice, don't write about it and post it on yelp. We were followed the whole night two wasted popped collar polo and khaki wearing and very drunk white guys who we escaped to go play pool.The clientele were the reason we fled the joint. We took off for the Spotted Pig. One of the better experiences of my life! THE ATMOSPHERE:Beachy dive bar. I am an avid pool player so I really appreciated the psychedelic pool table there... even though it's hard to make shots, but not as hard as the pool table at the Dead Poet on the UWS. It's a mere 50 cents.  THE BAR STAFF:I will say the bar staff was soooooo nice, we laughed with them, totally kind and personable. When I asked for change for the pool table, he didn't have any but instead GAVE me 50 cents and called it a present. That's half a tip!The tatted bouncer at the front door was not what I would call warm or fun but he probably needs to be that way with the type of wiseguys walking into this place. THE OVERALL STORY: Fun beachy feel dive bar for cheap beers and friendly service. Skip the speciality cocktails, skip the food, and skip talking to the clientele.But maybe it was just the night we went.",2,,

98,Maya F.,"New York, NY",70,147,21,3.0,7/26/2011,"There's something about the Rusty Knot. It's not on the way to anywhere, and not near very much else. The crowd was pretty awful when I visited, but it was a Saturday night, and there was some drunken bachelorette party carrying on near the fish tank. When we got there, the guy at the door said there was a wait to get in; I peered in the window and there was some dude passed out in one of the chairs. MY chair. Anyway. Normally I wouldn't wait (for anything, ever) but as I said, this place isn't near anything else, and as it happened, we only had to wait five minutes.We were in the mood for margaritas; they weren't great, but they were drinkable. Skip the salt if you go that route, though. It's not Maldon or sea salt or even Kosher salt; it's just regular table salt, like Morton or something. I don't know why that surprised me, in retrospect. Maybe because they serve their Mai Tai in a cute, campy ceramic tiki head mug, I thought they'd have nice salt. But I digress.The specialty cocktails weren't delicious or revolting: they were just SWEET. Do you love stuff that is really SWEET? You'll like these drinks. If you're not big on SWEET, or you don't feel like being incredibly hung over the next day, get beer. Or neat liquor. That said, the bartender was the only guy on and the place was packed to the gills (hence the wait), and he held it down. And he wasn't a puppy. His shake was a little lackadaisical, and he seemed to have a bit of a sweet tooth, but that man can handle volume.Oh and they do pickle-backs. Not sweet. Yum.",1,,1
99,Maotai T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,4.0,10/2/2012,"Sunday night review:A friend of mine said to come meet her and other friends here, so off I went.When you walk into this establishment you're hit with a laid back hipster vibe. That's usually not my thing, but it definitely works for this place. I liked its energy. Young group seemed happy and friendly. Great location, it was incredibly easy to find parking. This place was packed and lively for a Sunday night. There was also a DJ there who was really good and kept that great energy up while not being too overwhelming or becoming the extra person in your group (sometimes dj's distract you with a lot of nonsense). I was still able to hear and have a conversation with the 4 people in my group. The crowd was filled with some corky and some beautiful looking people, especially the ladies. Nautical theme also weirdly worked. Comfy couches and wood furniture everywhere were a nice touch. We had a great spot on the couch facing the window. It was just a great view of the West Side Highway.Bartenders were fast and friendly with smiles on their faces. Had a crush on the female bartender she was incredibly gorgeous (have to remember to get her name next time). I was sticking to beer which was ridiculously cheap (can of Tecate $6), but the great names of those drinks/shots will def have me trying them the next visit. Even saw a guy holding a whole coconut drink with an umbrella. Nice, I think I laughed out loud. Friends ordered tacos. Which they greatly enjoyed. Another thing I didn't try was the food, but hey I was focused on drinking people! Bathrooms were clean and complete with a boat wheel mirror for your enjoyment.Couldn't really give this place 5 stars, because I really didn't experience everything they had to offer, but I did like everything I did. Will def be back again.",,,

I've been during the weekdays and it's just full of blue collar guys, or grunge dudes. But on Saturday it's in full swing and it's usually well dressed, rich west villages folks. It's kinda small and can get crowded. But theres a couple of booths and sitting areas that open up. My favorite parts about Rusty Knot are that they serve Busch (not Busch Light) on tap. It's cheap ($3 i think) and served in cafeteria cups. They serve picklebacks. They make homemade Dark n Stormys and serve them in cool tiki style cups (we call them Legend of the Hidden Temple cups). The bar looks like your grandparents beach house basement (if my grandparents actually had a beach house).

106,Jane D.,"New York, NY",96,238,31,4.0,7/19/2010,"Boy, I'm not even going to try to psychoanalyze the ironical-ness or non-ironical-ness of the decor (if I may reference a favorite Bushism of mine). What the Rusty Knot is, is a damn fine place to drink and nosh, watch the sunset or not watch the sunset, and in general shoot the breeze with a bunch of pals and make like you're on the Jersey shore. Yep, the Rusty Knot (the eponymous house drink and best described as a frozen mojito) will sneak up on you and bite you in the ass if you're not careful, much like the good ol' pickle back (a shot of inoffensive Jameson followed by a shot of some of the best pickle juice I've had in a long time... and this is coming from a kid who used to drink pickle juice from the jar when her mamma wasn't watching). The dark & stormy isn't as good as Little Branch's IMHO, but the ginger  will grab you by the nuts (if you have nuts)... in a good way. It demands attention. If you need something to soak up the alcohol, the Rusty Knot has some of the best guac in town, a classic, true-to-form guacamole served in a half avocado shell with warm chips. For such a simple dish, it's all about the attention to detail -- and the kitchen at this fine establishment does, indeed, seem to pay attention to detail. Everyone's favorite snack seems to be the pretzel dog. And though I'm not usually a big hot dog fan, I get it. The ""pretzel"" (which actually tastes more like a buttery croissant pastry) is delightful, with or without the dog. The mustard served alongside is a long step ahead of French's. The crowd is an enjoyable mix of pretty people, who generally seem to just come for the sunset, but quickly flee the ironical (or non ironical) digs for a sleeker Meatpacking district lounge, artists with Fidel Castro beards, and 30 something office Dilberts, disguised as someone cooler for the weekend.

You're constantly hoping that those chicks from Three's Company will end up walking in midway through your happy hour.Sure the paneling is tacky, sure the small knick knacks remind you of your creepy overly perverted uncle's basement apartment, and yes the gobs of pristine-ly dressed hipster chicks make this place swell of New York Time Out..but that's not a bad thing at all! It's actually quite awesome. Great spot for happy hour and their lime juice and salt-tinged Tacates are deliciously addictive. Definitely a cozy knook that I would recommend to friends looking for a cool happy hour spot. Only draw back is that it is kind of out of the way along the west side highway.",,,

Since they don't do bloody marys, I had a really weird spicy citrusy beer concoction (cervesa cubana) that was interesting at first and then got funky.  The other mixed drinks sound fun and unusual but a little on the spendy side for my taste.  Stuck to Tecate subsequently and was happy as a clam.The food is limited (sloppy joe, bagel dog, iceberg wedge???, pickles) so I wouldn't go here for a meal or if you're fantastically hungry.",1,1,1

As for the service... pretty bad. We were a party of 7, ordering different drinks and different shots. She didn't write anything down, and of course, got the order wrong. TWICE.

I got a Singapore Sling, he a pint of McSorley's. We enjoyed the view of the Hudson and the awesome classic rock on the jukebox. Then we proceeded to have delicious bar food, including some of the most amazing fries I have ever tasted. They were wedges encrusted in some sort of herb mixture, served with a creamy dipping sauce. We also tried a picked egg (it was only a buck) and mini fish po' boys. It seemed like a nice mix of people, and the waitress was very pleasant, not at all what I was expecting, considering there were Olsen twin sightings when this place opened in the spring.

The Spiced Colada is so delicious, served in a coconut cup that gets so frosty it nearly gave me hand a brain freeze. And they brine their own pickles, and serve the juice as a chaser after a shot of Jameson's (the ""pickle shot"" if you will..). Do it. It's an incredible pairing. They have fresh oysters, a delicious house made pretzel dog with artisanal mustard and I once had a bite of their meatloaf sandwich on soft white bread (better than my mother's).

I've read like every serial killer book ever written, and I think the Russ Meyer girls are actually pretty cute and I would totally dress like that in real life. So the Rusty Knot is actually an amazing panacea for certain of my reality-challenged needs.The fact that it's totally way out in the way out next to the West Side highway means that it will seldom be *too* crowded, which is fine with me. The vintage-looking but not tacky nautical décor is a hoot. And the staff and regulars are friendly, and will take very good care of you. I came here for the first time on what was supposed to be a date; the dude actually stood me up. But I was enjoying the bar too much to leave prematurely. I learned an important lesson that night, which could really be carried over to any bar, but which I'm glad happened at the Rusty Knot: if you've been stood up, TELL THE BARTENDER. Not only will he pay serious attention to you and you'll have an amazing conversation about the work of Francisco Goya, but he'll alert the regulars, who will buy you drinks like ALL NIGHT. And they were good drinks, too. Seriously, it was like my 1970s New York City wet dream come true. I was like SHIT I AM LIKE DIANE KEATON IN THAT MOVIE, ONLY I DID NOT GET MURDERED. There are not many places left in New York City that evoke this kind of nostalgia (yes, even for those of who weren't born yet in the time they evoke. I've watched a lot of movies, give me a break).

The dark & stormy was delicous.  The pretzel dog was real satisfying - the pretzel part was just the right amount of salty, and kind of buttery.  I can see this being a great place to get a couple drinks and watch the sun set over the water, except that it's too crowded (even with the line at the door) and too sceney.   Maybe a weeknight is better.note that the awning reads West Bar & Lounge.  Perhaps being ironic and hip is inconsistent with straightforwardly declaring the name of your bar.",1,2,2

A pretty fun place with unique drinks, tropical drinks, and a campy decor that's a fun diversion from your typical west village bar.  Met up with some friends there and had a pretty fun time late into the night.  I was a bit surprised by the long line waiting to get into the joint, but I guess it's caught on.  Lots of pretty faces to look at, and the people there were more or less friendly.

My only complaint about the Rusty Knot is that the small straw they give for this frozen drink is not big enough, the ice gets stuck and it's hard to drink!I am iffy about the food at the ""dive bar"" - stuff on the menu like the jambalaya-ish stew was really hard to eat at the bar especially since it gets so crowded.  Other food that I tried were the oysters (ABSOLUTELY YUMMY!!!!!!! probably the only thing that was perfect on the menu), the pretzel dog (which I think the chefs could do a better job in!) and the razor clams (which were a shame as they were rubbery and overwhelmed by the sauerkraut accompaniment)Since the Rusty Knot JUST opened and they have absolutely nailed the mixed drinks, I am willing to take another TREK (another minus!) to the bar. I have absolute confidence in Joaquin Baca, the chef, and cross my fingers that they will improve the menu.For those who have not ventured to the Knot, definitely give it a try on a good day so the journey there is not super horrible.

Maybe I'm just too late in getting to it, but aside from the cool ship/nautical theme, I didn't think there was anything too special about it. Even the Rusty Knot drink was just okay (though the little plastic mermaid was a cute touch). I'd go back but maybe on a weekend night.",,,
180,Lexi G.,"Manhattan, NY",38,61,0,4.0,9/23/2013,Killer drinks! A dive bar demeanor with an amazing kitschy feel. The Dark and Stormies are refreshing and pack a punch! Their signature Rusty Knot cocktails are like indulging in a delicious frozen mojito ! Great for afternoon drinking on the weekends and the pool table is an added bonus. The nautical theme is also fun :),,,
181,Jilly j.,"New York, NY",51,326,0,4.0,9/22/2008,"I've been wanting to get over to the Rusty Knot since it opened. We finally hiked way west to discover a retro sailors retreat w/ some pretty kick-ass supplies! Amazing mixed drinks, funny snacks and good mix of people.Looking forward to coming back! Ahoy!",1,,1
182,Jessica C.,"New York, NY",29,91,3,2.0,1/16/2009,"Aside from the non-wooden, wooden looking tiki cups, I stand behind my evaluation that the Rusty Knot is somewhat overrated.  The scene reminded me of a cheap version of tv set off some semi crude sitcom off of the FOX network.  Aside from the blistering cold along the West Side highway, or the hard attempt to be a ""dive bar""...it comes off looking that kid you knew in grade school who bought all name brand clothing, and wore all the items at once, and ended up looking more foolish than cool.  It's not so much the ""kitsch"" that I mind, it's more like the idea of a curated basement that took more thought than it should've, and when you think hole-in-the-wall/dive bar...it should just come together naturally, and not planned...or at least to the degree that the Rusty Knot has done.The food selection has better offerings than the décor or crowd.  Pretzel covered wiener, $3...pickled egg, $1.  I can see this being better in the summer, but being that this version of ""middle of nowhere"" is actually meaning the ""middle of the Westside highway"".  No thanks.  If you really want to throw money at Ken Friedman, blow it at the Spotted Pig or Freeman's down in LES.  Rusty Knot...I think NOT!",,1,1
183,Brigita J.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,64,0,3.0,10/1/2009,"Checked out Happy Hour here on a Wed.  Good, well-made drinks.  Good snacks. Mellow vibe and good jukebox.  Really liked the sunset view across the Hudson and the idea of being so far west.  Nice to not be tripping over people on the block.  It's a destination place where you could really hang hardcore with friends, or meet someone else with the same ""I walked all the way here to chill"" mindset.  Nice.",,,
184,Paul C.,"New York, NY",77,441,352,3.0,3/24/2008,A Rusty Knot  is English slang for a butt hole......just saying.I walked there on Friday and they were closed for private event until midnight.....Meh.,,2,1
185,K P.,"New York, NY",70,106,3,2.0,5/29/2008,"I'm not sure why it's called a ""dive bar?""  Perhaps I don't understand the meaning of dive bar...but Rusty Knot is super bright, new & clean.  Which I don't mind, I'm not really a dive bar kinda gal...The bartendar with the mohawk is great -- efficient, friendly & cute, totally 2 thumbs up!The drinks are yummy.My friends ordered the wine coolers -- b/c we thought it sounded funny & were reminiscing about the first time you ever drank as a kid (or, um, well, legally, yeah, right, back then) and it was some concoction that was really light & refreshing.  I ordered the pina colada b/c they had these coconut shaped glasses (deep, I know) and that was tasty.oh. the door guy was pretty hot too.So why the 2 star rating?  The vibe.The people there are...Ok, lemme be a little snarky.  You know those kids who think they're so cool and they try really, really hard?  Well, that was the crowd.  The guys who sit in a circle all wearing the same outfit in different iterations: expensive shorts & a lacoste shirt or some weird hawaiian printed thing to seem cool w/flip flops.  Perhaps they had just come off of their yacht...but that's sooo not the crowd I was looking for to just sit around & chill with.I guess I kinda thought a dive bar would have a hip or I guess, more importantly, laid back-no-pretense-vibe.  Well, I guess I was wrong.(which isn't the first time & will NOT be the last.) I'm glad I went.I doubt I'll go back.Or I'll wait a year, until it's no longer a dive bar to be ""scene"" at.",,2,1
186,Pam M.,"ASTORIA, NY",24,118,3,4.0,4/20/2011,Whew. what a walk from the train. cute place though. very casual and laid back. their drinks are very strong. food takes a while but maybe that's because it was crowded. I would come here more often if it weren't so damn far.,,,
187,Michael H.,"Austin, TX",73,235,3,3.0,4/11/2008,"I would probably give it a 3.5 if that were possible.  Went here last night for ""Yay it's Spring Happy Hour"" with friends to celebrate the 70-degree temps with some cold beers.  Great place to go during the evening hours as the location on the west side is ideal for maximum sun exposure and sunset views.  Felt very boat-like in the interior, and the designers did a great job of achieving the 60s basement chic/nautical idea.  Ate a pretzel dog (yum) and had a few beers for a pretty good price seeing as this place is owned by the Spotted Pig guys...Not overly impressed, but I'm sure I'll be back.  I hope my next visit is just like the first: not too crowded; no douchebags; good beer/drinks.",1,,
188,Lucea S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,11/16/2011,"the rust knot is an excellent place to have a beer with some friends, hang out, maybe shoot some pool, and enjoy a rustic swarthy atmosphere. there are few bars where one can just hang and not feel overwhelmed by the scene of the bar: the loud music, the low lighting, or the monochrome of types that mingle to hard and relax too little. a great spot to hang loose.",,,
189,Kim N.,"New York, NY",6,55,1,4.0,5/21/2009,"Drinking at The Rusty Knot reminds me of drinking in your father's tiki themed den. It's kind of cheesy, but in a totally sincere way. It doesn't take itself too serious; kind of like a side project for dad...The signature Rusty Knot drink is incredibly tasty. So much so that you can get yourself in trouble if you're not careful. It's basically a blended mojito with plastic mermaids floating about. If the decor isn't nostalgic enough for you, order the warm cookies with your last drink. Even though the location is completely inconvenient, you are right near the Hudson Park Promenade which if you play your cards right, can be very romantic at night. Just be careful crossing the highway!",,,
190,Adrienne R.,"Brooklyn, NY",101,49,0,4.0,7/22/2010,"I really like this place!  It's not quite divey and is pretty comfortable to hang out at before the late night crowds come along.  I liked the cocktails but I *loved* the food!  Since the cocktails on the menu are about twice as pricey and only half as good as the food, I'd recommend sticking to beer or well drinks and pigging out on the pretzel dog or tacos or anything else on their menu.",1,1,1
191,Carly F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,11/20/2011,"Never go to the rusty knot.  My friend had a birthday party here since they're apparently ""the best birthday spot in the world"" ...and then the bouncer wouldn't let any of her friends in.  I would say it's actually the WORST birthday spot in the world, since they'll turn away half of your birthday party...not to mention the nastiest bouncer in NYC.",,,
192,Karyn S.,"Brooklyn, NY",215,125,12,4.0,4/29/2011,"I'll say two things that have already been said: the pretzel dog is a miraculous bar snack, and The Rusty Knot is a drink that I can always get on board with.

193,Alex H.,"New York, NY",15,99,0,5.0,7/8/2011,"Yo, I love this place. Whatever to the haters. Yeah, it's kind of a kitschy faux-dive, but I'm always eager to go back and the Rusty Knot is delicious. Chill crowd, far less scene-y than the surrounding environs. I've never ordered food but it's always looked just fine.",,,
194,Scott S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,15,1,4.0,6/18/2009,"Great spot for the tourist looking for a neat local joint.Its located in a section of condos/apartments overlooking the Hudson on the West Side highway. Past descriptions of its decor and clientele hit the spot as it really does look like either a solid-colored-clothed hipster sitting in your grandparent's bamboo furniture-clad den or Calvin Klein models awaiting their next porn/fashion shoot with some gaudy wood paneling.The food is good bar food. Decent oysters, mini sloppy joe's and bagel dogs. Enough to satisfy either your drunk culinary desires or your aphrodisiac cravings. The drinks are tiki/basement lounge-esque with a fine concoction of dark and stormy using good black rum and ginger beer. If your group orders the same drink for each, why not try a flaming bowl of it?Lastly is about the decor. I love the pinup sailor gal on the back wall of the bar. Makes me wish I had it on my basement bedroom wall.All that's missing is Captain and Tennille in the corner playing 'Muskrat Love.'",,,

196,Sara B.,"Tempe, AZ",85,86,0,4.0,10/20/2009,"I walked in carrying a hand-held bouquet of roses followed by a gentleman wearing a seersucker suit. I walked out two Tecates and a couple something-too-sweets later, just day-drunk enough to take a series of poorly conceived photos overlooking lovely New Jersey. In other words: Yes, I went to the Rusty Knot on my wedding day. And it was rad. A tiki bar at the edge of the West Village with a decent happy hour serving delicious potato wedges and cocktails in fake coconuts? Call it rose-colored glasses, but what's not to love?",8,11,15
197,Patrick P.,"Woodstock, VT",45,211,0,4.0,6/26/2010,"There are many things that are awesome about the Rusty Knot, and a few things lacking.  Here's a quick rundown:Awesome:- Food- Service- Drinks (Micheladas!  Yes!)- Free jukebox- Pool TableNot Awesome:- Packed to the gills on the weekend- Often full of frat(ish) boysAs you can see, the good far outweighs the bad.  If you can make it down, I highly recommend doing so.",1,,

199,Luke K.,"Oakland, CA",66,34,5,4.0,2/26/2011,"Very cool spot. It's perfect in the summer. It's got this cool nautical theme and a trendy but not too pretentious crowd. Their signature drink, The Rusty Knot, is great. I have no idea what they put in it, but it tastes like a 7-11 slurpy met a mojito except better than both of those things. The only thing that prevents this from getting a 5 is that i have seen it become over crowded on the weekends.",,,
