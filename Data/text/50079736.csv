0,Ces L.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",27,108,366,5.0,9/3/2018,"Eating out doesn't have to be hard for me especially when I can find a place with a decent salad option. Wing Club had just what I needed to make sure I had my veggies for dinner with there Chicken Salad. I've noticed most places lack in fresh lettuce and I usually get stuck with soggy leaves. This is not the case with Wing Club. I'm not sure where they get their produce from but their lettuce were vibrant and fresh as if they were picked right from the garden. The chicken was perfectly lightly flavored and enough for me not to need to use the dressing. They also pack it with dried cranberries and cherry tomatoes, which also explains for the no dressing needed.My friend had their wings and fries small basket and she really enjoyed it. The wings were sizable enough so that she had leftovers. The fries were nicely seasoned unlike other places that add way too much salt (yes, I had to try one lol). Needless to say I have found a go to spot if I'm ever walking around the Chelsea area.",,,1
1,Elli C.,"New York, NY",0,53,103,2.0,9/30/2018,"If I never have it again I won't miss it.Chicken strips aren't really strips, more so sliced pieces (see pic). The sauce coating could use another layer or two. My order was refried from a batch that was sitting out above the oil fryer. Overall not much appeal to this meal.",,,
2,Colin M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",131,369,106,3.0,8/26/2018,"As far as Korean fried chicken goes, this stop is pretty run of the mill. My order seemed a bit overcooked and I didn't love the Schezhuan sauce. I did also try their fries and their corn dogs, both of which I enjoyed immensely more than the wings.",,,
3,Jenny L.,"Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY",205,96,26,4.0,5/10/2018,"I haven't tried their other items except for their wings, but they have a pretty extensive menu. The soy garlic and Korean sweet chili wings hit the spot - I prefer the Korean sweet chili wings here over Bon Chon! The Korean sweet chili wings are spicy but doesn't have the mouth numbing spice - so if you a mild spice eater like me but want some hot wings this place is for you.The fries looks pretty good too, but I was by myself so I simply ordered a small order of wings. Overall I would come back, for the quality you get a good value for your money.",1,1,1
4,Priscilla T.,"Manhattan, NY",103,597,8,4.0,9/22/2018,"Best fries in NYC. Crispy on the outside, potato-y on the inside. Doesn't even need ketchup. And they stay crispy for long after the fries cool. The wings aren't bad but I prefer Bob Chon style or Blue Ribbon in the end.",2,1,1
5,Brantley H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",90,56,87,3.0,5/9/2018,"3.5. Round down for the biased reviews on here. Came to the ganseevort market outpost and got the small basket of chicken strips with fries. Fries were cooked very well, but could use a little more seasoning. Chicken, on the other hand, was seasoned very well with the sweet chili sauce, but was a touch too stringy. They have a chicken sandwich and some dumplings on the menu that looked intriguing, but didn't get to try those.",,,1
6,William G.,"San Francisco, CA",1,76,114,5.0,6/10/2018,"Ordered 8 pieces of Korean Sweet Chilli Chicken Strips, and it was amazing. All I wanted was tender chicken with some asian flavor to it, and this dish executed that perfectly. With a fork, it's very easy to eat and the sauce isn't overbearing. I thought the portions were perfect.",,,
7,Johnny Y.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",72,52,18,5.0,7/12/2018,I stumbled upon this place while looking for ice cream! This is in the Gansevoort Market and I'm glad I came across this! We got the 8 piece half and half and the chili sauce they use is amazing! I wanted to do the 10 wing spicy challenge but that'll be for next time! The corn dogs were delicious too! Make sure you try the corn dogs! I'm not a fan of corn dogs but they make it so flavorful! You will see me back here more often!,1,,1
8,Xiaotian W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,1,5.0,3/30/2018,"Have tried soy garlic wings, korean style, but not too sweet, really good seasoning, crispy and juicy, much better than some of the other places around there, great value for the money",,,
9,Kat B.,"Old Bridge, Old Bridge, NJ",0,3,0,5.0,8/25/2018,"Literally the best wings in NYC. Perfectly blends southern style crispyness with a Korean palate. I make my friends from Jersey (Hoboken, Weehauken, Hudson Coast) come here every time they tell me about ""the best wings they've ever had."" Come here before the place blows up! Wings are so good they won't stay hidden for long.",,,
10,Mariam S.,"Atlanta, GA",2,6,21,3.0,4/28/2018,"I was deceived by the 5 star reviews. After eating at this place, I think the 5 star reviews are probably fake ..... the food was not good. I had wings, fries, and dumplings..... very mediocre quality.",,,
11,Jin Hyeong P.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,4,5.0,2/26/2018,"This restaurant is located inside of boho karaoke on orchard street. The wings are fantastic and i really love their sweet chili sauce brushed on the wings. Their seasoned fries are really good too! Must try the new korean fried chicken place in lower east side. They also use all kinds of deliveries like grubhub, uber eats, postmates etc. so you can get your food delivered which is really nice",,,
12,Jinyoung J.,"Queens, Queens, NY",13,1,2,5.0,3/1/2018,This is way BETTER than any other chicken restaurant. You SHOULD TRY this chicken with SWEET CHILLE SAUCE!!! Try it!! You dont regret it all!!!,,,
