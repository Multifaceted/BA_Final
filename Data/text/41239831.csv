0,Vivek D.,"Queens, NY",133,193,75,4.0,11/16/2018,"I've been here before during regular bar hours and for an event so I have a dual experience here.  I love that this bar is two floors and both floors are quite spacious.  I've had drinks before on the ground floor and I was here for an event on the top floor.  It's a perfect place to watch games because of the multitude of TVs.  If you want to eat, there's ample room to sit as well.I like the bar area in the top floor.  The space upstairs is quite big too.  The bar itself is quite long so you can hang out there and not feel super cramped.  There's also a nice fireplace in the back of the floor if you want a nice and cozy dinner away from the madness.  There are plenty of TVs wherever you are hanging out too.  The terrace is pretty nice too if you want to hang out for a bit.As for the drinks, no complaints for me.  It's Manhattan pricing, but that's normal for the course.  The bartenders are pretty nice and hospitable.I'd come back here if I'm in the area.",1,,
1,Brooke K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",445,73,163,3.0,11/8/2018,"This is a dolphin's bar right in midtown Manhattan. Great spot to watch the game as it gets packed with fans so get there early. The menu is very limited, not sure if that's always the case or if this is just during game time. We had the chicken Caesar salad and Chicken / avocado sandwich. Both nothing special to write home about, but relatively inexpensive. A lot of TVs are around for game watching.",4,2,3
2,Brietta Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,534,317,3.0,8/26/2018,"This is your typical Irish pub that offers $12 lunch specials that come with a glass or wine or beer. My friend and I got the chicken fingers and pastrami Reuben with mash. Both were pretty good and not big portions but were enough for us. I was able to get an orange juice since I'm prego, which is nice.",,,
3,Jonathan M.,"Massapequa Park, NY",100,1,0,5.0,11/6/2018,just had an amazing Knicks game watch event there that the team was SUPER helpful in setting up and executing. Could not recommend enough!,1,,
4,Lauren M.,"Great Neck, NY",0,2,1,5.0,10/29/2018,Slattery's is downstairs from my office which makes it a convenient spot for happy hour. We have gotten to know the owner and bartenders very well and they treat us great. We even have our company's logo above the bar (which the owner pinned up for us)! We have held small company events at the bar upstairs throughout the years. The upstairs bar is a perfect space for a gathering of about 50-60 people. The food they have available is yummy bar food and the fact that the bartenders know our drinks makes ordering easy! Definitely check it out if you're in the area!,1,,
5,Karen D.,"Pomona, NY",95,2,0,5.0,9/28/2018,"This is a great place to have a party. From planning to great service, they made it really easy for me to host a cocktail party with open bar and some appetizers. John is great to work with, and his staff were friendly and really helpful. The upstairs room with the open balcony on a warm September afternoon was just perfect. Everyone had a good time.",,,
6,Steve M.,"SLATERSVILLE, RI",44,9,0,5.0,9/7/2018,"Slattery's is a terrific pub, whether you're in the mood to watch a game or need to host an event. (Believe me, I've had the pleasure of doing both there.) The bar itself is spacious, with service on two floors. The staff is also very attentive and friendly. The supporters of several pro and college sports teams convene here, and that's no accident: It's a great place to meet up with friends for a pint and a bite. Not to mention centrally located between Penn Station and GC, if you're a commuter.",1,,
7,Sacha M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5,51,34,5.0,4/7/2018,"We stumbled upon this cozy pub on a late Friday afternoon. Drinks were good & strong. I had the best crab cake, too!! Great service, good music, cool spot. Will return!",1,,
8,Kris P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",280,247,523,3.0,10/21/2017,"When it's game day and you wanna chill without it being too crowded on a Saturday... check this out! 1. This is the home of the Carolina Blue Babies Game days!2. You get a shot with your 1st ""Ginormous"" cup of beer- Jameson, Tequila, or Jack Daniels!!  They know what's up with the whiskey! 3. The food was pretty solid for bar food! I had the nachos and chicken wings... the chicken wings were nothing to run home about but they got the job done.4. The bar wasn't packed when I was here but they didn't really listen and get my order correct, when I asked for something... I never got it. Not sure where the disconnect was but maybe they were taking mini shots as well! 4. The restroom situation is simply terrible! When folks are drowning in pales of beer... they often break the seal and have to go... the restrooms are single stall units.. men and women use them... I don't know abt the same time unless you are okay with doubling up..your choice.... BUT let's agree that men don't always get the aim right so there was pee on the floor :( All in all... the place was solid and I'll go back again if ever in the neighborhood",,,
9,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1167,786,153,3.0,5/22/2017,"I can't speak for what this bar is like on a packed, screaming Friday night but I will say that it was a great spot for my college friends and I to catch up two years in a row. Let me back up and say that we came here both times the day right after Christmas, so we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. Not a beer-drinker but I did enjoy the Dark & Stormy and Moscow Mule, which, as I recall, definitely did not skimp on the liquor. Also ordered the pina colada and strawberry daiquiri because I can never resist a girly fruity drink with a plastic umbrella dangling from the side and these were clearly from a prepared mix. On to the bar food. My test for any good bar food is how many napkins I need to blot all the oil off my fingers. We had the potato skins, nachos, and ""French bread pizza"" (which were ridiculously overpriced at $10 for what amounted to slightly upgraded versions of the Bagel Bites of my childhood). Everything left me good and bloated, especially the nachos that came buried under their own mountain of melted cheese. I had also ordered a smoked salmon club, thinking that I would try to be healthy and not fill up on the fried appetizers but of course, that didn't happen. Maybe it was just an exceptionally empty day but the waitress didn't seem particularly enthused about checking up on us or replenishing empty drinks. It didn't matter, as we were busy catching up. They also host pop culture trivia events every few nights. (Not that I've been to a single one of the trivia nights but I would like [to make a tremendous effort] to go to one.)",4,1,5
10,Tony T.,"New York, NY",240,873,1307,2.0,3/10/2018,"Came here to watch a basketball game upstairs and have some dinner. The food is OK. Had a chicken sandwich which was fine. There are a lot of televisions, which is good, but the color was off for all of the televisions on the west side of the building, which is bad. On top of that there was a delay in the broadcast that was probably due to satellite signal issues. If you come to a sports bar to watch sports, you would like to be able to see the game you are interested in without missing some of the action and be able to see it in normal color. The service was friendly and they have drink specials which is a plus.",,,
11,Sue M.,"Charlotte, NC",53,256,657,3.0,12/28/2017,"Came here for lunch 2 days in a row.  My coworkers had th3 lunch special and thought it was good. I ordered fish and chips one day aand a Caesar salad with grilled chicken the next day. I would stick to ordering fried food.  The TVs are the bar are a good amount,  size and distance from the bar.  Got to watch a good game.",1,,
12,Barry K.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,9/7/2018,"If you are looking to have a private party, I cannot recommend a place any more highly.  I've been hosting all types of events (work happy hours, fantasy football drafts, reunion parties) over a many year period.  No matter what my request was, the owners were willing to accommodate.  The bar is comfortable, service is excellent, and good food/drink menus.",1,,
13,Mackenzie B.,"New York, NY",191,49,39,4.0,6/10/2018,"Stopped here for a couple of late afternoon drinks during happy hour. I loved the upstairs open air balcony, something you rarely see in NYC. The drinks were a good deal for midtown, and we got a delicious shot for free with our first drink. Overall, great happy hour spot!",1,,
14,Ed W.,"Manhattan, NY",177,354,19,3.0,12/28/2017,"Decent Irish pub.  Our bartender was jovial, but when we asked for glasses of water to go wth our beer, he gave us shots of whiskey.  Not at all what we were looking for.",,1,
15,Justin O.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,10/19/2017,"This bar, Mr. Slattery in particular, was incredibly helpful in organizing an open bar event for my nonprofit. Not only was the upstairs space perfect for the event- lots of TVs for the games and really clean bar with friendly bartenders- but the drink selection for the open bar was spectacular. They served some appetizers for the event, which everybody enjoyed. Mr. Slattery worked with us to provide the cheapest cost event so that we could raise the most amount of money possible for our organization. Not many bar owners would be so helpful!I highly highly recommend this bar. Not just for events, but also to hang out. We stayed for another 2 hours after the event ended.I cannot recommend this venue enough.",2,1,
16,Maria R.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,8,10,5.0,10/8/2017,"Great atmosphere, good food (I really enjoyed my ceasar salad with chicken & Campari - OJ). The barman was very attentive and friendly as well.",2,,
17,Brenda W.,"Manhattan, NY",12,56,0,5.0,5/20/2018,Had a birthday party for my fiancé here. John and Justin were great to work with. The room upstairs is great. It has an out door patio. The food was wonderful . They helped when we needed some extra help hanging decorations. I would highly recommend for any event!,1,,
18,Mike B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",184,1505,174,3.0,2/2/2017,"Slattery's is a decent midtown Irish pub. on a Sunday evening it was quiet and lowkey, and I was waiting for some friends to show up so we could get dinner in K-town. just the place to pregame while sending out taunting messages as my friends made their way to the city, declaring that I would be reasonably sauced by the time of their arrivals. this isn't the first time this has happened. ah, the struggle of (almost) always being The Early Arriver...I got a free shot of...something fruity? I can't recall what it was exactly; it was sugary and fruity but hey, the price was right. a shot of Wild Turkey and a Smithwick's reset my palette back to the usual.4 beers and 2 shots (two of those beers were for my friend who got there first) set me back about 40 bucks. not too shabby considering the location. bartender was friendly and seemed to enjoy the fact that it was a quiet Sunday night. well, it was quiet until my friend showed up and I kept declaring the two of us ""The Based Brown Men"" repeatedly.nothing out of the ordinary, but I liked it.",4,2,3
19,Max C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",52,4,0,5.0,7/22/2017,"This top rating is a no-brainer, kiddos. Have gone here many times over many years, and have also had multiple parties here when in town.  The owners are the most awesome guys in the world, so cool.  Great Guinness pint, other beers, warm atmosphere, and solid quality food too. You want to go where you feel at home, and this place is it! Also a few other good spots on the same block.",6,2,4
20,Kayla I.,"Stafford Township, NJ",262,15,9,5.0,1/13/2018,"I tend to stay away from the midtown area, but this pub is in a perfect location. Slightly offset from the main tourist areas, it's tucked right on the side of 36th. I came with a friend for a UNC game (this is the home of all things Tar Heel!!) and I will definitely be back. If you're here for a UNC event, go upstairs and make sure to get a blue cup. $12 for a draft beverage in a BUCKET plus a free shot of your choice! You can't beat that price, especially in this area of the city. We didn't eat here, but the people next to us ordered nachos and I was about ready to reach over and steal a handful off their plate! Service was prompt and friendly.",2,,
21,Peter R.,"New York, NY",12,4,1,4.0,1/17/2018,"That's a favorite. Nothing like the Nachos Grade. It's a lot, you're gonna have a 3 course meal, if you don't have stomach for it there other things & the quiet atmosphere makes up for it, but I have the stomach & I can't resist everytime to watch the Yankees. One of my favs. A Dolphin bar but would go more if they played the Heat, team is seriously kicking ass right now, a promising future no one wants to believe. And those Nachos? An appetizer, total steal! Makes me wanna get a round of Stella. This place is straight forward, total bs free. It's what I like best. Even a spot to charge your phone, it's has multiple floors & they let you chill after they just T..C..B!",1,,
22,Julio S.,"Ithaca, NY",40,31,18,1.0,1/10/2018,"Be warned. Happy hour is a lie. Domestic beers are 4 dollars and imported are 6. Not bad right? I found out the hard way that they have redefined the definitions of ""domestic"" and ""import"". You want a craft beer from Cali? That's considered an import. Want a beer from Europe (looking at you Chimay Red) 11 dollars. Apparently the only beers they consider domestic are bud light and some other watered down beer. Don't fall for it. You'll be paying 6+ for anything that isn't bud.",1,,

You are reading the related review :)We had dinner already somewhere else but my friend was hungry, we checked couple other places on the block but no luck. When we got here, tables had reserved signs on them, no ID check btw. Apparently they were not reserved but just on hold to manage the demand :) We checked in and saw their offer for a shot! Yay! I love check in offers :) With the beers we ordered, got 4 shots even the 4th person was not a Yelper, kind of them to serve 4. That cocktail shot  was so tasty, something with green tea but can not recall now.Hungry friend got flat bread with chicken, guys tried it too, they all loved it. It was like $65 for 7 beers and the flat bread.",15,6,10
26,David K.,"New York, NY",95,59,445,4.0,6/27/2016,"Nice pub in midtown with friendly staff!Dont forget to check-in (free shots with green tea, peach schnapps and jameson are waitin for u)I dont even finished my sentence about check-in offer to waiter when shots for me 'n my friends were in the table like in 30 seconds (aweesoomee!!!)Good spot for watchin soccer games with some beer!They also got 2nd floor but i guess the use it durin weekend when its packed!Also my friend ordered Flatbread pizza (in french baguet) with cheese and chicken and that was gooood!!!Check 'em out guys!",5,1,4
27,Kim O.,"Morongo Valley, CA",65,145,99,3.0,6/10/2016,"We stopped by for a quick drink before dinner. It's a nice pup with a second story balcony, making it enjoyable if you want to relax and people watch. When we checked in on Yelp, we got a free shot with our drink. Well, the coupon said shot. Really, it was a house shooter. You don't get to pick, either. They give you the ""house shot of the day"". I'm not complaining about something that was free- it was very nice of them to provide it. It just felt a little deceiving with how it was advertised. Overall, it's worth stopping by if you're in the area and looking for a quick drink.",3,1,1
28,Walt P.,"Las Vegas, NV",92,331,126,4.0,6/8/2017,I was so surprised how cool this place is.   The bar staff was super friendly and they were actually Irish. Prices were average for a pint but the major plus was that they had Smithwicks on tap. The gimmick here is that it's happy hour all the time. If you buy a drink you get a free whisky green tea  shot called a nightmare it didn't taste great but it wasn't bad. After a few nightmares The next day I now see why they got their name.  Can't wait to come back and party here again.,,1,
29,Tempestt W.,"Bronx, NY",0,18,0,5.0,10/5/2017,"Hands Down This Venue Made My Private Event Stress Free & Very Manageable!!!!  I had rented out the balcony party room area for my Mom's Surprise 50th Birthday Party! What most intrigued me about this venue was the price.  $65/pp for open bar all night and 3 hours of 8 passing appetizers is an amazing deal.  Not only that, but they are very flexible with deposit payments and payments in general.       From the day of, to the night of the event everything ran very smoothly.  They allowed me to come in an decorate many hours ahead of time. Provided me with scissors when I need it and communicated extremely effectively.       Furthermore, the venue is in the ideal location for having a party.  Jack's 99 cent store, Party City, K-mart, Trader Joes, Fairway, and Sprinkles, are all stores that I needed items from to make the party a success and are only 10 mins away from the venue itself.      Overall, the staff was wonderful and I appreciated every aspect of their effort.  I highly recommend this venue!",2,,
30,Kristin S.,"Montclair, NJ",196,18,0,5.0,2/2/2017,"Hands down my favorite pub in midtown - which is saying a lot because Irish pubs are kind of my thing. Not only is the food amazing, but the staff is top notch.It's pretty much the New York equivilent of Cheers. It's where you wanna go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came.  Honestly, they are some of the kindest people you will ever meet. Mark, who is usually upstairs, pours a mean drink and is always there to make you laugh and tells a great story. Tressa, the bar manager, is just an incredible human being and always lends a helping hand. There is also an incredible lunch special for all those working in the area. Menu changes weekly but $12 for lunch and a drink. Personally, I highly recommend the veggie quesadilla, a.b.l.t. salad, and any veggie burger when its on the menu. It's a pretty great deal.tl;dr great bar. great people, great food, best dranks. give it a go.",3,,1
31,Lori O.,"Palm Bay, FL",5,6,0,5.0,10/14/2017,"I absolutely love this place. Their French onion soup is amazing and the drink specials are fantastic.

32,Eleonora N.,"New York, NY",3,16,7,3.0,8/30/2017,"It was a decent pub, a good place to hang out and talk to people versus other places where you have to yell. Came here during happy hour and received a free shot with my drink, some whiskey with green tea and sour mix (not too bad). My friend had a burger which looked ok, and I had curly fries which were fine. The staff was great, really cool ladies waited on us and interacted a bit. Other than the really nice staff, the pub is ok.",1,1,1
33,Steph A.,"Rockville Centre, NY",373,21,7,2.0,1/20/2017,"It's upsetting I had such a terrible experience here because the food isn't bad and the place itself has been fun...But the older bartender who is upstairs is so nasty. Not only did he mumble under our breath at us rude comments, he tried to steal our gift card - giving us back the wrong one saying it didn't work causing us to spend an extra $100 than what was needed. He ALSO added gratuity when we were there at 4pm-7pm on a WORK happy hour. Not like we were a bunch of wrecklace rude children, which is actually what he treated us like. When we called him out on our bill he was very nasty and unwilling to help until he FINALLY gave us back the correct gift card. So not only did he force us to tip him 20% (which we would have done anyway regardless- I have worked in the service industry for years) he tried to steal $100 from us. I have honestly never had such rude terrible service.",3,,

Greated with a smile by an authentic Irishman who poured a free round of shots just for walking in. He also made superb drinks after talking to you for a bit to see what you liked, and made great suggestions, even told us what to say away from on the menu. Ordered some delicious potato skins, and drank the night away. Favorite. Pub. Ever.",2,,1
37,Ashley P.,"Coventry, RI",455,564,1386,3.0,1/3/2016,"Slattery's Midtown Pub was on the docket one late afternoon/early evening for a drink and bite to eat before a show at Madison Square Garden.  There were a number of people at the bar when we walked in, but we pretty much had our free reign over the tables in the back of the 1st floor for our happy-hour timed dinner.  I can see this place feeling cramped on a busy evening or even with a large group.  Keep your group size small if you plan on eating here.  In fact, the tables in the back were pretty small as well.  Barely enough room for two tall chairs on each side caused quite a few elbow wars at the table when it came to having enough room to comfortably maneuver a meal here.  There are a number of flat screen televisions mounted around the darkly-wooded interior.I ordered an Potato Skins appetizer, a Chicken Delight sandwich, as well as a bottled Magner's Cider.  The potato skins were average... and undercooked.  It came with 4 halved-potatoes covered in cheddar and bacon.  Both halves I bit in to were pretty stiff inside.  The Chicken Delight sandwich was a step up for sure (with grilled chicken, bacon, mozzarella, and bbq sauce).  The fries though were overdone... dry, hard, and unenjoyable.  Its hard to believe an Irish place like this could be so off-point with their potato dishes.  Disappointing.  The Magner's was served cool and crisp with the traditional cup of ice.  Overall, an average meal that left me wanting.Probably a better place to grab a drink and watch a Dolphins game over anything else.  The Midtown Pub is home to the ""Dolfans NYC""... the Official New York City Fan Club of the Miami Dolphins.  Free shot with your first drink.",2,2,1

The communication and response time via email was quick and everyone answered my questions and helped booked an amazing night. The 3 hour open bar is the perfect amount of time, in your own designated area with your own bar and bartender.

Nachos, corned beef, bangers and mash, and two pints of a very pleasant house brew... but the bill, tax and tip included, set us back $40 a piece. Hard to complain, but then again here I am, complaining.I loved our waitress, who went along with our stupid drunken jokes and harmless ribbing.

The owners and food was great ( shepherd pie, chicken Marsala etc). The servers took the show with all the apps, drinks were delivered directly to my guests immediately.

We just wanted our tab right after our order and he was yelling at everyone at the bar. Apparently he didn't like that someone said ""yo"" at the bar...and then he took his anger on all the paying customers who weren't even asking for anything, we were just waiting. Avoid at all costs.

I've been coming here for about a solid 2, maybe 3 years because I work nearby. I don't frequent the place as often as I do some of the other bars in this area - but when I have come here I've had nothing but good, pleasant memories. YES, I know who ""robocop"" the waitress is as not-so-affectionately referred to in a review below me, then again I've ordered their appetizer sampler to share with coworkers/friends and NEVER have I been charged a $4 sharing fee. I would be livid seeing as who the hell is going to consume an appetizer sampler all on their own? I mean, it's possible...I guess...but DAMN, lol. The food here isn't awful as far as pub food goes. It may not be the end all, be all of pub food - but I ASSURE you that it's not pre-packaged/unfrozen food either. Their bartender...man I wish I knew her name, the one with the dark brown hair and the charming Irish accent...she's awesome. Really cool personality, friendly and almost always knows that I'm probably going to be in the mood for a Landshark and her weird ""woo woo"" or that bright green shot that comes complimentary with your first drink (which by the way I found it pretty funny that this was a ""Yelp Deal"" upon checking in since, yanno, it's a deal for everyone - Yelp check-in or not) and she's given me buybacks. I like buybacks :D. I also like how after work this place isn't swarming with the boring, yuppie, corporate suit & tie, former frat boy types. This is one of the many reasons that Slattery's has a soft spot in my heart. This place isn't awful and they serve a pretty good potato skin :).",9,5,3

Trivia was held on the second floor which doesn't have the full menu of downstairs unfortunately. Having pregamed the menu I was really excited for the Full Irish but they weren't offering it. My friend and I started off with the French Bread Pizzas and were surprised how much we loved them, the stand out of the meal .She got a burger and I got an avocado blt, both were good pub food, nothing crazy. The Moscow mules were decent and the bar actually gave every trivia table shots before we started which was a really fun touch. Overall it was efficient and one of the better places I've done trivia. Also shout out to our awesome waiter, sorry didn't catch your name, but he was from Tipperary and for having packed tables we never had to wait for anything.",2,,

I lived in Europe for 2.5 years so I have a soft spot in my heart for Irish pubs. This place always sponsors events and I think that's cool. Yesterday's event was a scavenger hunt. After we were done we ordered food. The French bread pizza and buffalo wings were superb. The pizza crust was a perfect combination of flaky and moist. The vegetables were al dente and the cheese and meat were delectable. The wings were cooked to perfection. I'm picky and I like mine crisp. This place could definitely give bdubs or wing stop a run for their money. And the carrots and celery was delicious. They taste like they came from the garden of eden. Not too many times you can get organic food (or organic tasting) from a bar. The whole experience was satisfying. I look forward to coming back.",1,,

76,Stephanie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",210,226,143,2.0,4/24/2014,"I came here for dinner around 8pm on a Wednesday night, mostly because a sign at the corner told us that it was down the block. Most of the pubs in the area are on side streets from 5th Ave, so it was honestly easier just to follow a sign than to wander around!I had the ""dinner special"" of spinach artichoke dip with tortilla chips for $9, which for some reason took them half hour to make up but was tasty when it did get here. My friend ordered one of their chicken entrees, and I had some of her mashed potatoes which were plain and unflavored. The waitress was very nice when we asked her for a small plain salad instead of the entree sized ones on the menu, and she brought us a decent-sized plate of a classic lettuce tomato cucumber salad with ranch on the side for only $4.Don't forget that a shot is free with your first drink, and they have a sizable selections of beers, both on tap and bottled.

We came in b/c it is a Dolphins bar but were surprised to find that the place was a pretty big ghost town (apparently EVERYONE went to the game as it was against the Jets). There is plenty of room for nearly any size group and everything seems to be on the straight and narrow. We came for the football game but ended up playing trivia while watching (I guess they have themed trivia every Monday night) - a very good time was had by all!Bathroom: It is a pretty standard bathroom, clean and inviting.Staff: Our waitress was really nice and super friendly. She was quick with our drinks and refills and always seemed to be on hand if needed. Additionally, our trivia guy was super cool and friendly as well.Drinks: We just had drinks which were well made (cocktails) and nicely chilled (beer). They have a full bar and a solid selection of different beers on hand.Value: About what you would expect for a bar in the middle of Manhattan.This place was fine, and the trivia was a really nice touch that kept things light when the football game got ugly.

This is often pretty late, sometimes between 2-4 am. Both of the bartenders I've met are really cool (Owen and Andrew). Prices are reasonable (I believe Guinness is $6) and they are liberal with their buy-backs. I've never eaten here so I can't say anything about the food. The vibe is relaxed, it's a bit on the dark side, but I like that. All in all, pretty straight forward bar, and not crowded at all at the hours I visit.",,,1

Always made us feel welcome and gave us the entire top floor where me and my friends could dance and play our own music. John put out some appetizer platters for my party to enjoy as I was only paying for the open bar. From the first day I contacted him about hosting my party, he was professional and friendly and assured me that my party would go on without any problems. I have stopped in a couple other times for a dinner and/or drinks and am always greeted by their friendly staff. The food is great with some delicious pub favorites.

90,Gerard P.,"Staten Island, NY",276,372,5,3.0,7/29/2015,"This is a nice little midtownish pub that probably gets overlooked in the flood of Irish bars lining this neighborhood. Went there to celebrate the birthday of a very good friend last night and was pleasantly surprised by an number of things, including the terrace-which is probably useful when the temperature dips below 90 degrees. Apparently, this is a combined Tar Heels/Dolphins bar, which is a unique combination I had never encountered before. There's also regular trivia nights. Unfortunately, it was Grey's Anatomy turn yesterday-if I had been there the previous evening I would have been able to take my turn at Game of Thrones trivia. The appetizers I tried were delicious, and the service was stellar, for the most part. The one downside is the drink prices, which can be a bit steep for some. Also, I was somewhat disappointed in how narrow the happy hour window is, but I suppose you can't have it all. That one minor quibble aside, I'd definitely recommend this place to friends.",,,

Since the exterior of Slattery's looking pretty decent, we figured it wouldn't be too bad inside. With disappointments, the decor was outdated and I'm sorry to say, but the Pub was looking kinda old and ragged.We ended up being seated upstairs and our waitress (aka, RoboCop) was not the friendliest waitress in town. Without a smile or even a hello, she told us the only happy hour special they have were tap beers for $8. I don't know about you, but that didn't' sound like happy hours prices to me!After looking at their awful menu, where everything looks like it comes from a freezer to be defrosted and fried, we decided to share an entree and were immediately told by Robocop that there was a $4 sharing fee! With an attitude, she even told us to look at the menu if we didn't' believe her. This annoyed me especially since their food were not cheap. My Fish & Chip is a clear example as it cost me $16 bucks for two filets of fish and some fries.

108,Kurt Q.,"ASTORIA, NY",40,186,5,2.0,12/17/2013,"I wonder if I turned into a freight train whether my waitress finally would've given me my check. I wonder if my face just turned into the cabin of a SD40 diesel-electric locomotive, and my ass became a boxcar, and the seat beneath me splintered under the weight -- whether she would've said, ""Oh yeah, that table. Let me give them their check.""From start to finish, she performed a perfect symphony of bad waitressing. For her first movement, she looked like the personification of clinical depression--drifting up to our table and mumbling, ""Are you ready?"" on three separate occasions (Couldn't she interpret our heads buried in the menu as maybe a sign that we weren't ready?). And then of course she got our orders wrong, didn't apologize, failed to refill my soda, the list goes on. My personal favorite was when she asked if we'd like another round of drinks, we responded no, and then she came back to the table with another round. At that point, my friend and I just had to laugh.So 15 minutes after asking for the check, and having to ask another waitress for it, take a guess whether the check was correct or not.

It's barely worth two cents and don't let them fool you when they say it has Jameson. The night rolled along with flat beer, clear, sour-mix margaritas and subpar food.

There was also a sign outside that said ""Happy Hour All Day'.  It turns out, when we asked for the HH specials, HH was over--so I guess the day was over?  It's fine if a bar doesn't have an all day happy hour, but then don't advertise that there is one!The service wasn't offensive but it also wasn't great.  Had to ask for water (this should be given at a sit down table when ordering food!), and refills a couple of times.  As far as bars/restaurants in this area--go across the street to Ginger Man--you're better off avoiding this place.",2,,

116,Jason J.,"Woodside, NY",7,13,0,1.0,8/3/2013,"In all honesty, this place has a bartender that has to be one of the most disrespectful people I have ever encountered in the service industry. Before I expand on this, I'd just like to say that this place does have a very friendly and attentive waitstaff, polite hostess, and the food was alright. Their happy hour drink specials were particularly good, and the reason I came here to begin with.Having said that, I had a terrible experience when I was here with an awful bartender that just wouldn't let things go. Twice a month, I meet with a group of about 12 old coworkers for happy hour. We had planned to spend time at the Ginger Man across the street, but it was a little busier than usual, so we relocated here. About four of us came in and sat at a small table and took advantage of the happy hour specials. It was good. But then things got weird. One by one, our acquaintances trickled in. I had a friend come in who wanted to sit down, but we didn't have enough stools (We only had four). The bartender wouldn't let him take any stools from anywhere in the room after he asked politely, and there was maybe only ten other people in the bar. But instead of saying outright that he couldn't take a stool, he watched as my friend went to each empty stool one by one and asked if it was okay. Each time he'd say no, with a wisecrack smirk. When he asked him what he could do to sit (he has bad knees), the bartender shrugged and said, ""Couldn't tell ya."" My friend was upset, gave him a bit of an attitude back, and then left the bar. Eventually we had the whole group of us arrive, but the entire time the bartender held a grudge for which I have no explanation whatsoever. He would serve us after making sure we knew he was ignoring us. At one point, I ordered a soft drink with no ice and no lemon along with my alcoholic beverage. What he slung over to me without making eye contact was a soda filled with ice and three lemons in it. C'mon guy, really? It was obvious he was doing it all on purpose. We also watched as another one of our more shy friends went to order a drink at the bar, which was basically empty, and stood there for 10 minutes as he was blatantly ignored. It was only 8pm, and it was very rude.Eventually we spent about $200-300 and left. And we will never be coming here again. This could have been a twice a month regular meet-up spot for a group of 10-20 friends after work. But because of that bartender, we'll make sure we never make the same mistake again.",8,,
117,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",143,726,51,3.0,12/4/2014,"I came here for a Dolphins game as it's NYC's Dolphins bar. Waitress was pleasant and attentive. I had the fries and gravy which is definitely a skip, I don't know why I ordered them. Fries were good but gravy was bleh and I felt like a fatty after eating it. We also had the nachos which were decent but had chunks of avocado on it. We same someone else with guac on their's, we didn't even know it was an option. It's a good place to catch the Dolphin's game but I don't know if I would return otherwise.",,,

Enjoyed the place, but I'm sure the drinks are cheaper on other days than this infamous NYC ""holiday"".The place was crazy packed and has big projectors to watch sports on so I'd generally say it's a pub you've seen a million times in a million different places.

I like it!  I've been here a couple times, first time back when they were renovating and only the upstairs was open, and it's always a good time - no frills or anything like turning into a wannabe-club, or even just the audio levels (the Friday 80s music was a bit loud but not so that you couldn't talk over), but the 2 levels to explore plus the swanky 2nd level balcony gives it enough cred and even feels a bit like a European pub at times - you really should only come here if you're coming with a crew and just want to drink and bullshit the night away.  Drinks are pretty much the epitome of average, from quality, to selection, to price... so not much to go on about there; however, they do have this Free Shot with First Drink special that you don't even need a yelp check in for - the drink itself is pretty sweet, sort of reminds me of ""Ass Juice"" at Double Down Saloon in the E. Village, so you're probably better off that they cut you off at just 1...P.S. the balcony, fitted with its high top tables and bar stools, gives you an amazing view of the bumbling, stumbling mess they call patrons at Galway Hooker across the street!",2,2,2

John made the entire planning process so easy for me- from reserving us a private area of the second floor with its own bar, to giving suggestions on food and cake (the cake was included in the reservation!), and even standing on the bar to help me hang the decorations.

There's a bathroom right there which was almost exclusively used by our group, there's TVs everywhere so no one had to crane their neck or leave our designated area to watch the soccer and boxing match that night. The music they play is also pretty good and not too loud that you have to yell if you want to have a conversation but loud enough to dance if your jam comes on at some point.

No frills bar downstairs, slightly more intimate dining experience upstairs. The drinks selection was fine. They don't offer any happy hour specials because a free shot comes with your first drink (regardless of whether you check in on Yelp it seems). The dinner selection is your standard Irish pub fare with other American bar dishes. I had the bangers and mash which was filling. The sausages were nothing special, then again I also forgot I don't really like sausage, but other meat eaters confirmed my initial assessment. However! You must know that the mashed potatoes were yummmy. Buttery and flavorful. So, even though I ultimately devoured a plateful of carbs, it was worth the while to soak up the pints of Guinness (a good draft might I add) and Magners I was double fisting. As for other food, say nay to the calamari.The smear on this experience was the inconsistent service: we had three different servers it seemed, which was confusing. I'm not sure if I accidentally ticked off one of the servers by ordering with someone else when I arrived late. Some of the three servers we had were fine and friendly, others were a bit pushy. Maybe over-attentiveness is not a problem for others, but it's a big peeve of mine. For a frigid Wednesday evening, my friend and I just wanted to nurse some drinks and chat it up. It felt like every 10 minutes someone would come to ask if we were going to order additional drinks or wanted the check. (I know I need to better control my reactive eye rolls in these scenarios, so I do apologize staff people.) I would come again only if I'm on the block and other first choices are too crowded (obviously referring to Ginger Man since that's how my party ended up at this spot in the first place).

One thing I want to put out there is that he has a strict policy about not sharing drinks with others who were not participating in the open bar special - which is totally understandable.  I honestly feel kinda bad for the bar owners when me and my group of friends go to an open bar because we're big drinkers and they probably lose money on most of us.  Anyhow I made it clear to the few friends who were not participating in the open bar to pay for their drinks and not get drinks from others doing the open bar.  We had no issues and a great night.",1,,

149,Anthony P.,"New Haven, CT",45,753,1571,4.0,7/4/2012,"What a great time here.The bartender AND Yelp hooked me up with two drinks! Thank you! On the bartender I got a shot of Jameson, and from Yelp's special I requested a shot of Stolichnaya (it was the closest hard alcoholic drink in front of me).It was a very slow evening, so the bartender was very friendly and humorous. He busted balls in an appropriate way. I liked the fact that this guy was from Ireland. He recommended a cider brew, which I was really content with. I also added ice cubes to the drink, which was something he liked doing. Then to top it off, I had a cider mixed with Guinness Stout. Tasty.I was happy I stopped here with me and me lads.",2,,
150,Caitlin H.,"Manhattan, NY",102,2,0,5.0,8/18/2016,"Slattery's let us host a trivia fundraiser up the second floor this spring and it was a blast. I reached out to them after doing The Office trivia there and the owner got back to me straight away. I dealt with him personally to set everything up and he was so gracious and helpful. They provided a whole bottle of alcohol for the winning team and house shooters all around to the other players. All the details were there too (HP movies playing on the screens in between rounds, etc.). Staff were super friendly and laid-back. They had plenty of servers upstairs for our event so everyone was well tended-to. We even went back for one of our monthly meetings this summer and got a free round of mid-day shooters (oh my!). And the server remembered our group from when we had been there! Definitely a gem in midtown and it's very refreshing to find a bar that'll bend over backward to help a little non-profit group.",2,,1

The every table around us but one was empty, but the waitress only came by once after we'd waited 10 minutes to say ""be right with you."" She passed by three more times, then brought the table next to us another drink, then left to go to the bar. I went to speak to her about it, and she said she was moving as fast as she could. I asked to speak to the manager, and when I did he said I was free to find another pub--which is exactly what we did. Skip this place and go to O'Reileys or any of the other FIVE pubs in a 2 block radius. Good riddance.",1,1,

The place was empty although they had a live Irish band upstairs. We didn't check it out but maybe there were more people up there. There was a free house shot with the purchase of your first drink. The bartender gave us a pre made pineapple upside down shot and it tasted like there was no alcohol in it. We then proceeded to order Bud Light. I received mine first and it smelled and tasted awful. I tried my friend's and it was fine. I returned it and he said it came from the same tap. Yes I saw it came from the same tap but it tasted like it was the first pour of the whole day. Awful. The place was dead so we left and didn't even finish our beers. We close out and find out our beer was $6 for a pint of Bud Light! We were paying $6 for craft beer at Ginger Man!

We arranged to have the room upstairs reserved (for free) for the entire night, happy hour deals all night, and a (free) birthday cake. My friend and I were able to drink for free (we needed 30+ people in order for that to happen, ended up having between 40-50), but the happy hour deal includes dollar-off beer and $7-8 appletini's and cosmos (I think). Appletini's are my new favorite drink! There is also a free shot with everyone's first drink, which is nice. We had control of the music, so 2 of my ""dj"" friends brought their computer and hooked it up to the speakers. The space upstairs has its own bar so no one had to wait long for drinks, as the bartender was ours for the night. There were also dartboards and several tv's. The space is great and no one felt cramped, We were even able to move the tables and chairs for a dance party. The staff was very friendly and attentive. There are bathrooms upstairs as well, so that was an extra bonus to not have to run downstairs every time to the main bar. If you are looking to have a party at a convenient midtown pub, I would highly recommend this place, very easy to work with.",3,,1

We are quizzically looking at them like.. ok? that's tomorrow? You have the sign out TODAY? Whatever, we wanted a low key night and since this place wasn't packed like every other bar in the area, we stayed... I wonder why they were dead when other bars were busy anyway.  When the bill arrived, of course, we did not get any happy hour prices... We settled the bill and just decided we will never come to this place again. HOWEVER, I just checked my credit card statement... they have charged me more than I have charged originally.

Had our own bartender, full control of the music, etc. Didn't really think much of it, seemed like a cool place to hang out.Second time was this past Wednesday, when I stumbled in with my aforementioned friend so he could thank the guy who organized his party and hooked him up. Manager promptly comped us a couple (unneeded at that point, but we still drank them) rounds. Score!Stopped in again last night around 11 for a drink after a soccer game. Lines down the block for Gingerman and Galway Hooker and since we were deciding between the three, Slattery's won due to the ""lines suck and it was cold outside"" rule.Long story short, we took over the jukebox, chilled, and had a great evening. 3am arrived quickly and we went home.

It was like a Washington Apple, but with strawberry brandy added. Delicious. We did one more later in the night; not as delicious. I've been here a few times before but never reviewed it. The bartenders are always friendly, the service is always fast, and a beer is a beer is a beer. It's got a small bar feel; it's never really overflowing too badly, and it's a good place to have a quieter drink with friends while still having some people around.Highlight of the night: Random Australian guy making me a new custom voicemail message in a great Australian accent: ""Hi, this is Seth!

LOLOL.  They never  have any coordination with the tv's with sports games. They have sports center on with no sound. Bartenders are respectful but aloof. They also disappear from the bar, never no when to ask for refills and they have a scam to lure you in with a free shot, which the 3 times I drank AND ate there, I never received a shot.

188,BeeBee K.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,4.0,8/13/2013,"I recently held an event at this pub on the second floor. The good: The space is VERY nice, wood flooring, nice stools and table. Service was good, we had a bartender for our event, he was kind, forgot to give a couple of drinks to my guests, but overall, his service was good, I liked the bartender's temperament, there's a nice speaker system for music, balcony space where you can dine, drinks were happy hour prices during my event, I did not have to pay for the space because my event was at an earlier time in the day, my guests enjoyed their food and drinks, everything was clean: bathroom, dining area etc. The owner is very amiable, responds to emails and text messages in a decent time frame. He was around to make sure everything was ok. The bad: My event was a performance, there really isn't much offered for singers or musicians. No mic stands, no music stands, only two mics and they are not omni-directional, thus the harmonies of my backup could not be picked up, no one was really there to help my singers set up prior to the show and make sure everything ran smoothly (owner did eventually come about 30 minutes prior to the event) I felt like I was being rushed out of the space even though no one seemed to have the space reserved after me. Overall, I recommend it for hosting events that don't require musical performances. The customer service was good.  I also recommend  visiting the bar to dine/drink, it is a nice spot with a decent bar menu (apparently the leek soup is good). So, I think ""the good"" outweighs ""the bad"" and I will consider this space again in the future.",,,

I called up to see if they would be able to fit 20-30 people in for a couple of hours expecting them to give me a hard time because I was either giving them a day or two's notice. I was told by the woman I spoke to at Slattery's that I would be getting a call from the manager. John Slattery called my cell phone, told me that not only could we fit but we would have our own private bar and would run happy hour throughout that period, even though it was outside of normal hours. He gave me his personal cell phone number and let me know that I could reach out to him whenever needed. I unfortunately had to cancel that night due to an unanticipated emergency and reschedule the following week. John kept in touch via text message and made the entire experience incredibly easy. John is definitely a good man.The private bar upstairs was really nice and had an open air patio overlooking the street.  There were about 20 people in our group and there was plenty of seating for everyone, and the bartenders were very friendly and attentive- everyone's first drink came with a shot on the house.   The bar is in a great location that was very convenient for our party to get to, even from Long Island City.  We had a great time and I would highly recommend Slatterys.",1,,

The bartenders were very prompt and courteous, even though the bar was crowded with other people, none of my guests ever had to wait to have their glasses refilled. This is the the sort of place you want to go if you like a pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff and also want to be able to have conversations with people without having obnoxious music blasting in your ear.

Bartenders were very easygoing and service was efficient. Owner took care of us extremely well and played a big part in how successful the evening was! This will now be my ""go to"" spot for happy hour and drinks after work!",,,
197,Kevin D.,"New York, NY",1,95,0,4.0,11/9/2009,"I came here on a saturday night for a friends birthday party. the bar has two levels and was abler to accomodate 3 parties. for the entire party we were given happy hour drink specials ($5 draft, $6 cocktail). the bar was a little empty around 9:30pm but picked up by midnight. the music is pretty typical mix of oldies and top 40. the crowd is probably late 20s early 30s. i have mix reviews for the bartenders, one guys was really cool, he was very attentive and gave us free shots. we gave him a nice fat tip after we closed out. on the other hand, the girl bartender wasnt so nice, and was irritated at some of requests (i.e. can we get 4 shots please, then more people came over, make that 7 shots) anywho, i had a pretty fun night there, hung out with friends and met new people. i would recommend this place if you wnat a casual midtown pub thats not too crazy.",1,,1
198,Gabriel R.,"Flushing, NY",34,64,234,3.0,7/11/2012,Went here for a coworkers going away lunch. The food wasn't bad. I had a cheeseburger fairly well done. We sat upstairs the space was very accommodating for our large group. The service was actually very very good. We were on the second floor alone and the server was always coming up to check on us. The beers were ice cold and the shots a little gross. I think if they refreshed their menu and added some other stuff they would be much better. Overall it's not a place I would avoid but not a place I would go out of my way to.,,,
