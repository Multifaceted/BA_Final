1,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1899,2.0,6/6/2018,"I would say this place is adequate if you want to just get some beers, watch some sports and chill with a group of friends. The bar itself is all dark and seating can be a bit tight. As for the food, nachos were good but just watch out when adding additional toppings. The way it was worded on the menu we were given, it seemed for $4, you can get all these toppings but it turns out it was $4 per topping so we ended up ordering a $24 plate of nachos so that was annoying.  The menu should have been a little more clear. Looking at the website, it seems like it's been clarified but unfortunately it wasn't on the actual menus we got.  Nachos were crisp which I appreciated but for $24, not worth the trickery in adding toppings.I also got the cheeseburger with a side of chips. They ask if you want chips or fries but don't disclose that the fries are extra. Luckily I asked to clarify. Cheeseburger was super greasy, nothing really great about it. Couple it with greasy chips and it just made me feel heavy afterwards. For $11, pass. I would have given it three stars for it being an adequate dive bar but I felt like I was getting cheated in paying for food so 2 stars it is.",8,3,5
2,Chris W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,3.0,11/17/2018,"This place is great....just avoid the daytime bartender and her band of over-the-hill regulars that take over the place.  On every occasion the bartender is limited to her childish friends who come in screaming for shots and loudly discuss all the issues with their respective days along with all the things they would change if they ran the place...most of the time talking over people trying to order.  its really hard for anyone else to not feel like your an outsider to this social club atmosphere they create. Food is good, beers are a bit over priced and most visits when these people aren't around its fun when the customers can hear each other. try the wings.",,,

I ordered the nachos (voted one of the best) and a bulleit rye on the rocks. FYI the bar was about only half full, so my issues are not related to a busy/crazy day. Rather the service was obnoxiously slow so i can't imagine how service would be here if it were actually busy.Problem #1: the nachos were served as if they were premade. The cheese was cold when the nachos arrived.Problem #2: j got charged for the ""rocks"" aka ice in my bourbon. Literally all across bars in LA and the last 18 months in NY, i have never been charged for rocks! I asked our waitress and she was nice enough to take it off.",4,3,3

We got a table and I went to the bathroom.Within those five minutes, my friend was given a menu and I came back to order drinks. My friend kept looking over his shoulder and making eye contact with the waitress that gave us our menus (she was wearing blue and white on Friday)... It was unbeknownst to me that this was our waitress since 1. I was in the bathroom when she arrived and 2. She was sitting at a table behind my friend and I chatting away with her friend instead of doing her job in a crowded bar during Friday happy hour. My friend and I waited a good 10 minutes with absolutely no help. My friend even got the attention of the person our waitress was sitting with but to no avail, we were still not served.At that point, we just left.I've never had to write a review for non service but this was completely unacceptable.",,4,
5,Michael F.,"Norwalk, CT",21,117,141,2.0,12/19/2017,"I went here for a couple beers after a work party. It is non-descript from the outside. There is a dining area up front with a bar area with several TVs showing various sports in back. The atmosphere is barely a step up from a dive bar.The prices indicate that it is not a dive bar though. A Bud Light and a High Life for $13?! I read on one of the blogs (i.e. Thrillist or Buzzfeed), that bars that charge more than $4 for a PBR, MHL, etc., to just run.The second round was two IPA drafts for $18. Again, the curiosity in me led me to look at the menu posted online, which said the draft beers were $8 each. I am always willing to pay a premium, when warranted (or in this case 'Warren-ted'). Give me some atmosphere or some insta-worthy chow and I'll happily pay a little extra for the experience. However, don't act like a dive bar with a shot wheel, nasty bathrooms, and weathered wood flooring and charge me $6 for a High Life. When I get nickel and dimed, I really get pissed and will not return. The bathroom is tight. You can barely take a leak since the total space is about 5 x  3. The toilet is utilitarian; metal with no seat (hope you don't feel the urge for a deuce!). If I was in prison, I imagine I'd be using this style of commode.Warren 77, decide what you want to be: Dive bar? Sports bar? Neighborhood spot? It seems to be some amalgam of each.I guess for Tribeca, with those wack beer prices, it is a dive bar...For the 1 percenters, I'll pass.",3,2,2

Updated review","My wife and I popped back into Warren 77 on a return visit to NYC recently. We loved it so much the first time that we thought why not give it another go?The results could not be worse. I'm a college football fan and I stopped into the ""best sports bar in Nyc"" according to the sign outside and I approached the bar. It's a Saturday and I think this will be great again. Instead I walk into a War Zone. I walk past a booth filled with maybe 20 year olds wearing wigs and get to the bar and try to order a beer and wings while I watch the SEC game of the week. Instead of any kind of game sound that everyone(10-15 people of the Bartop) wanted. I have to listen to terrible techno music from a DJ that is mixing game sound with crap I have never heard of before. This is a Sports Bar? That's what the sign says and what my memory from a year plus ago served me. Instead I get a headache from the music. Lousy service from the inattentive ""manager""( tattooed kid who mentioned he was the manager 2 times in 10 minutes). All I wanted was a simple meal for me and my wife(silver lining was the food was good) but the new service and vibe we received was chilly at best. Loved my visit last time.  But I was super sad with my recent visit.",5,,
18,Cyndi D.,"New York, NY",0,5,1,1.0,3/19/2018,I thought this would be one of the most amazing hockey bars I am NOT a ranger Fan  only reason why I am a part time ranger fan is because Avery was my favorite player I am the diehard Devils fan but whenever I go to rangers games wear my  Rangers jersey #16 again I always Ford Avery's number 16 Jersey anyway cuddling into his place of business number one.

19,Rick K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,84,0,1.0,1/7/2018,"This review was placed at the REQUEST of employees asking me to speak up. Its overly crowded, its drinks are overly priced. A Midtown East-esque d-bag filled terrible bar with a poor layout (good luck getting from one end to the other.) Loud, terrible music. A bit dirty and sloppy. ""Hot shot"" bartenders are drunk, loud, in your face and unprofessional. Worst of all, we made a reservation via OpenTable. When we arrived, not only was there no real table for us but there wasnt even a place to find someone to ask about our reservation. The wonderful waitress (she gets the only star) who was the only one working the floor said they can't handle people coming in wanting dinner. They have a full menu with NO PLACE to sit and eat. Its filled with loud, obnoxious adult frat boys and their tag along women. Think a drunk stadium/tailgate. This is NOT a restaurant. This is NOT a place to go for dinner (or any meal). This is NOT a place to enjoy a drink. Completely understaffed for a Saturday night. The owners need to get off OpenTable at the request of their own employees!The owners should be ashamed of their business, as its an embarrassing bar in a classy TriBeCa neighborhood.",1,,
20,Lily F.,"Brooklyn, NY",488,372,1050,3.0,10/17/2016,"Came here for the Giants game with my boyfriend. The place is pretty small for a sports bar and it was really crowded. It took us about 30 minutes to get seats to be comfortably eating and watching the game at the same time. We ordered Buffalo wings and chips with guacamole. The Buffalo wings were too spicy for me and I was upset it only came wit the drums, not the actual wing of a chicken! The chips with guacamole was okay, they could've used a little more tomatoes and flavor. But I guess it was pretty decent for a bar. The red wine was super expensive $15 after a $2 tip I believe.",3,,

23,Carolina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",1722,604,7753,4.0,5/31/2015,"My friends know I am not a sports fan but my husband is. I have been known to sit in bars to ""watch"" the game. And I am always wanting a bar that I can hang out at that is sporty but cool. Warren 77 is great because it's what one would think of when thinking of a TriBeCa sports bar. It has cool vintage details and some modern twist. In the front area, there is a cool lounging area with small chairs a little couch and a videogame table. Then there are some large booths for large groups, followed by the bar and one more section of tall tables and chairs. Plenty of nooks and crannies for different size parties. I like the collection of vintage baseball cards above the booths. There's also a collage sporty wallpaper in the back. I have also been here for brunch and enjoyed the Huevos Rancheros. My tortillas were nice and crispy, I loved the creamy avocado and the runny eggs. They unfortunately do not have coffee but they do have Bloody Mary's so I went for that. The dish also came with crispy potatoes and a green salad. It was just the right amount of food. My regular bartender Aubri is always super sweet and very attentive with the level of my drinks. I will definitely be returning and maybe stopping in to see the Seahawks games here when football season begins. .",1,1,1
24,Jenna C.,"Manhattan, NY",205,15,1,2.0,12/18/2016,"My boyfriend reserved a group of tables for my birthday last night and signed a contract to have a hockey game on for us upon arrival. The game was on. Great. We got our tables. Cool. However, in his numerous conversations with a woman named Fatima she confirmed we would have audio for the game on in the bar. There were *maybe* 12 people in this bar outside of our group when we got there and they flat out refused to change over the audio to the game we were watching. The bartenders were rude, the patrons were dicks, and of course they were all rangers fans. Couldn't and wouldn't because they wanted to have the rangers game on. The game had limited time left. Under ten minutes. We had a signed contract right there to show them and they said yeah they didn't care. That's horrible hospitality. Total 1%-er bar. It was also hot as hell in there.

We stopped here and were greeted promptly and sat at a booth/table that had awkward stools on one side so we asked for another booth and were accommodated right away. The burgers were recommended and they were fine, nothing spectacular, which I found odd since they have such a limited menu. I don't mind a limited menu but usually that means the items listed should be above par. The hostess/waitress would check on us and did put the hockey game on the TV closest to us (when we asked) but she kept going to another booth and sitting down, which is different for me and she seemed distracted. My husband had Iced Tea to drink and she kept refilling, never mentioning the refills were charged each time. This will not be one of the places we must visit next time, just meh.",,,

They used to be known for their nachos that had fresh ingredients and was baked to perfection and now seems to be made with processed ball-park cheese and overcooked chips.

It's a sport bar with awesome loud 80's music (not sure if they play that music every night) but with intimate corners if you're with one other person. The waiting staff was great, funny, and friendly who are willing to do dumb requests like send a person a drink when you are inebriated.

The esthetic was very relaxed and just what we were looking for to catch a game. There are really cool wood carvings of pretty much every NY based sports team, which was a nice touch.

It's like a haughty sports bar for rich people that have a friend that likes sports.The rest of the food was good.

The menu is very simple and all of the food looked amazing. And the staff was very warm and friendly. The downside to this place is partially due to location. It is easy to get to it but because it is in TriBeCa, it is a bit on the expensive side. Drinks are a bit higher than average for the neighborhood. You can go up one block and pay 1/3 less. Also, there is only one washroom so you may have to wait in line. This is a very low key place. If you're looking to get wild, you might want to skip this one. However, if you are looking to watch a game in a cozy and semi-quiet bar, you need to check this out. There are probably 6 TVs in there and they are willing to play whatever you want.

80,Savvy J.,"Denver, CO",234,9,1,1.0,12/7/2015,"I went here Friday night for a friends birthday. She ordered a round of six shots of Jameson for her other guests and one for the bartender, Joe. I handed him my card and told him very clearly TWICE that I wanted to pay for mine and the birthday girls shot (her friends had their own tab) and his response was ""I'm not going to charge you for mine"". I thought to myself ""hopefully he understands that I'm only paying for 2 of these"" but brushed it off thinking they wouldn't possibly overcharge me after repeating myself twice. I also ordered a Moscow mule and when I received my credit card slip and itemized receipt, it said $54 for 2 grey goose, 2 vodka, and 1 Stella. I calmly and politely explained myself to Joe that it wasn't correct but he refused to fix it and told me to sign my credit card slip, get out, to ""not tip him if I wanted to be a b!*ch"" so I threw my slips on the bar and refused to sign for the incorrect charge and went to collect my things. I was putting on my jacket when he came over and became even more aggressive, yelled at me an inch away from my face, called me a dirty sl*t. He was so close to me that I felt spit on my face while he was verbally assaulting me. He put his hands on my chest, not forcefully, but still inappropriately physically pushing me and yelling in my face to leave the bar. I'm literally putting my arm through the sleeve of my jacket and obviously preparing to walk out the door and do exactly that. I wasn't drunk or being loud or causing a scene, I had 2 drinks and was calm and never once used vulgar language during my communication with this guy. I called the next morning and was told I would receive a call back from an owner regarding a refund but haven't yet 3 days later. I shouldn't be stuck wasting my time writing this negative review while I sit at my bank to dispute the charge on my lunch break. I have never been so offended by a business in my life, shame on warren 77 for not refunding me immediately or apologizing for their employees despicable behavior. He did the exact same thing to my roommate too, charged him for 5 drinks when he only ordered 2 vodka sodas and maybe if I wasn't a woman, he would have respectfully corrected the charges for me as he did for him. Or maybe if he wasn't doing shots of Jameson all night while he is working, he wouldn't mess up everyone's tab and let his true misogynistic colors shine so brightly for all to see.",4,,
81,Nancy S.,"Manhattan, NY",223,152,0,4.0,5/12/2013,"I've walked by this bar a number of times before actually deciding to step in to check it out. There's no name, just a red vintage looking arrow sign that says ""BAR"" pointing to the door and sometimes some funny sayings on the sign outside such as ""DRINK UNTIL HE'S UGLY"" (great motto by the way...). The ambiance of the bar, however little it is, is really interesting. The whole bar is L shaped with small tables in the back, spacious booths in the center and a more ""lounge"" area at the front of the bar complete with couches and old school games (ms pacman, donkey kong, invaders, etc etc) as tables (they actually work too!) There are flat screen tvs positioned around the bar so in pretty much every spot you have a good view of whatever's on tv. The 3 booths though have the best view! Personal flatscreens per booth. Whenever I go with a crowd, I try to make reservations for the booth.The crowd is definitely an ""after-work"" crowd but definitely more ""underground"" than you would expect for the area being bordered by the World Financial Center and Goldman - think thick rimmed glasses and girls with long dresses.The drink menu is nothing special - some good choices for beers, wines, and cocktails and nothing is overly expensive. But at the same time nothing is overly cheap - no happy hour that I know of. The food is surprisingly something to take note of here, which is hard to do for an unassuming bar like Warren 77. The nachos are INSANE - at 17$ (including chicken, chili, or guac) they're a little steep but definitely enough to share for 2 people as an entree and 4/5 as an appetizer! The burger is freaking awesome, not obnoxiously big and the wings are fantastic.

One of the girls was having a Lower West Side so I ordered one too, which tasted basically like a mojito with cucumber. It was really good. One of the guys at our table asked if they had a Lower East Side, and the waitress say, no, they only do super local stuff. Cute.

To top it off, they buried the sandwich in a mountain of deliciously seasoned fries. I was craving a grilled cheese at the time, which they cut into four parallel strips (who the hell cuts a grilled cheese into long strips??), and was grossly over-cheesed (yes, to the point where it oozed out of the sandwich and left a glob of congealed cheese on my plate).

A combination of a nicer sports bar, an upscale pub (with big leather booths and dark stained wood), but then a touch of irreverence with working videogame machines serving as tabletops and the menus slapped on clipboards! Though you may have to wait to be seated at one of the few tables/videogames, it's worth it. It's mostly traditional American fare (burgers, steak and fries, salads, sandwiches). Though the first time I went, I got the most heavenly mussels in a spicy tomato sauce, but they've since fallen off the menu (I can't be the only person who's REALLY upset about that). As a substitute, they have a HUGE $14 ""avocado salad"" with a big slab of sliced steak. It's overwhelming and delicious. But the calamari is nothing special, so I'd order a different app. My only issue with dining at the place is that one of your party may have to balance on a high stool designed for a hunched-over videogamer--pretty uncomfortable and awkward, but you take the bad with the good I guess.",1,,1

He always makes sure we feel like family when we are there. That is something we all crave in such a big, busy city...to see a familiar face and feel welcome. He introduces us to all the other regulars that stop in and refers to us as his friends. He is a skilled bartender and is always willing to accommodate our needs and individual tastes, often crafting something unique that fills our particular request...we are always pleasantly surprised. We always feel like it is time and money well spent when he is looking after us, and we will continue to return and bring our friends as well as long as he is there to greet us with warmth and a good joke.",,,

97,Ray W.,"Manhattan, NY",32,81,5,2.0,9/23/2011,I've experienced better. It's always packed and loud.  Service is also extremely.  The bar layout discourages people from walking from one end to another without bumping into something....perhaps that's why the service is slow?It's also really small.,2,2,
98,Andy X.,"New York, NY",16,249,5,3.0,8/8/2014,"This place is Meh.Service was OK on a weeknight, but the layout sucks with the pisser being dead in the middle.  Considering Avery owns this place, I'm surprised it doesn't attract more douche bags. Won't repeat.",,,
99,Daniel V.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,10,1,4.0,11/21/2014,"I had been to Warren 77 several times for drinks, this was my first lunch experience and I have to say it was pretty solid.  If you are sitting at a table on a weekday afternoon you are not going to get the worlds best service, or good service for that matter but I was not expecting that either.  It is a laid back establishment with laid back workers, fine by me. Nachos were good and the burrito rocked.  Bloody Mary had an awesome kick, if you like a little spice then you will like this. Great beer selection on tap as well.  If you are looking for casual spot for a solid meal and good drinks then hit up Warren 77.  Music was a little loud and for some reason the door was open in November but it didnt ruin my time.",,,
100,L C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0,2.0,3/1/2015,"Want good food?Want to be completely ignored by the bar and wait staff? Come here!My husband and I have come here several times and it always the same story. We ask or attempt to sit in one of the (four) empty booths and we're told that we can't bc they are reserved for parties of four or more. Then after sitting we wave down the server to get a menu, and the same to order food and drinks. This was Saturday about 6pm ish. The wait staff and the bar staff all hang out at the end of the bar talking with each other and hanging out - with their backs to most of the tables (and patrons). We watch the other people in there walk up to the end of the bar and tap their server on the shoulder or wave for attention to order. And of course, once you got their attention they made it clear you were bothering them. This wasn't just us.. We watched this happen over and over as people slowly filtered into the place. However, the food is great! Our nachos were lovely and chicken too - which I think is the redeeming quality of this place. The ambience in the bar is nice too, they have flat screens to watch the game and it's generally cosy in there. So basically if they can retrain the bar and wait staff or get some who are interested in serving people - it would be a good place to go.",3,,

With a few minutes left in the game, all the TVs switched to basketball. When we asked the waitress to turn hockey back on, she said that all the TVs were connected to one box, which makes no sense, because both hockey and basketball were on over the previous three hours. The food is average, with mostly too much salt. The service is pretty horrendous, and the gratuity of 20% is already added to your bill. Why 3 stars?The decor is great. The place is somewhat like a barn, but in a good way. They have a good selection of beer on tap (including Goose Island - my personal favorite). It's not overly crowded on a Saturday night.",2,1,1

The regulars are all cool people and so are the staff.The food is quality for a restaurant, let alone a bar. I highly suggest the nachos, but the salads are really good, and so is the chicken. (The other restaurants owned by Matt Abramcyk are great too -- Super Linda, Tiny's, and Smith and Mills.)Music is always good, and the prices are fair. I really like the look, too. It's dark, and has a speakeasy feel to it. It's a sports bar, but it doesn't feel like a sports bar every time you walk in, which is cool.I'm not a fan of Tribeca (I work in the area), but Warren 77 is a big reason I stick around the area on weeknights.Great spot.",,,

106,James M.,Minneapolis-Saint Paul,128,119,161,3.0,9/4/2010,"The setting is excellent, downtown NYC in TriBeCa. I stumbled upon this place by mistake one evening when it was snowing hard. Such a good find! Loads of people must walk past this place and not even notice it's there - it's really hidden away with next to no advertising that it's there other than a sign with ""Bar"" and an arrow pointing down. Anyway, I felt like I'd discovered a real gem.Decor - so cool, looks like an urban NYC bar with exposed brick, leather back chairs, long winding bar and high chairs. Great look and feel.Food - nice. Good old fashioned bar food, done really well. Service - my only issue. It's ok behind the bar, better than average. But if you're not sat at the bar, it's hard to get the attention of the waiting staff who look after the bar area and tables. They don't wear uniforms, so they blend into the crowd and they don't come to take care of you proactively. In fact, having been there about a dozen times now because of the location, vibe and food - I've been SOOOO frustrated with having to literally hunt down their waiting staff to order a freaking drink. They're not the best.So besides the below average service in the bar area and table area, this is a great place to hang out. I'd go again for sure, but only when I'm feeling patient. :)",4,,
107,Jenny S.,"San Francisco, CA",513,233,3,4.0,12/10/2012,"This bar is nearby our place (and and my bf), so we come here pretty often. It's grown on me. It has a pretty cool vibe with the video game tables and open window panels in the summer. They could use another TV in the lounge area, but overall i dig it. The music is always awesome and the fact that an ex ny rangers hockey player owns the bar gives it some authenticity. The food is pretty good too. not the best, but it'll do for a lunch or quick dinner after work. during sporting events, this place is slammed, so don't expect to find seating. Overall, if you can find the room, i suggest coming here!",1,,1

114,Madz P.,"Manhattan, NY",23,18,1,5.0,1/29/2010,"I came here for a work happy hour on a Thursday night. I would highly recommend this place based solely on two completely unrelated things. This first being the deliciousness that is the ""West 12th"" cocktail. I'm not a cocktail person. I'm a dirty martini/goose and tonic kinda girl. Save the sweet drinks for your divine ya-ya sisterhood of the secret traveling pants meeting...I like to keep it real. After my coworker told me about this drink, and associating it with a drink that one might drink at a spa, I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm very glad I did. Made with vodka, fresh mint, cucumber, lemon juice and club soda, this drink is the perfect post work, Thursday night, girly without being too girly drink. The second thing that this place got me on was the music selection. At some point during a lull in the conversation, my ears perked up to hear ""Your ex lover is dead"" by The Stars. I LOVE this song and I'm pretty sure I've never heard it played at a bar of all places (if there are places that play music like this, please tell me because I want to go to there). Lucky for me (and everyone else) I was in the middle of sipping my second rather than tenth West 12th, so no yodeling (singing along) occurred. So, for these two reasons alone, Warren 77 gets two thumbs up (5 stars).",3,2,6

This bar is owned by one of the Ny Rangers so it's decorated with some old school hockey stuff and you can sure catch all of the hockey games during the season here. Tight space yet good vibe. The bartenders and staff are nice and upbeat. A round of drinks for four people costed about $30...do the math.

To treat customers like this in a recession is insane.Unfortunate too since I work around the corner -- I actually met one of the owners, Matt, when the place first opened and he seemed like a cool guy -- I am a big fan of Smith and Mills and often bring coworkers, business partners, etc. -- but I doubt I will ever go back to either place.If I were them, I  would nip this in the bud ASAP and fire the stupid little manager.

We waited at the bar for like 40 minutes and two beers just to get a table. After being seated I realized we were at arcade tables! We both ordered burgers and fries and it was definitely worth the wait. I wish Warren 77 was a bit bigger so we weren't all bunched on top of each other.",,,

No fancy sign on the door & no way for you to figure out where it is, but as soon as you walk in there in a photo of the great Michael Jordan!As you walk through the bar there are hockey photos scattered throughout but the best being, if you are a NY Rangers fan & True Blue is the famous ""Avery Rule"" right about the bar with Avery in front of Marty Brodeur. That right there made my night.Drinks are a bit pricey, but if your willing to pay why not. Try the West 12th it's amazing. So if the food, no complaints. The bar is a little small but that about all I would change. Lets Go Rangers!",,,
147,arvind g.,"Wellesley, MA",6,20,38,2.0,5/24/2009,"I was really excited to check this place out, as it's in my neighborhood, it looked like an actual, nice sports bar, and a hockey player owns it. Overall the place is really well designed, and has a great vibe. The onion rings and dipping sauce that come with them are stellar. Draft list is small, and not great, but does the job. Drinks are a little pricey, but I guess that it is Tribeca, right?All of that out of the way, their first week was pretty rocky, and the manager was way in over his head:Short version of a long tale:- I made a reservation for a table to watch the hockey game, and they said sure!- halfway through the game, manager tells me they have reservations for the table, and asks me how long I plan to stay- I tell him until the end of the game, and that we too, have a reservation- he then tells me that to have an entire booth, one must spend $400 minimum (he had already given half our booth to someone else, so then said it would be $200 minimum for the 4 of us)- I reluctantly agree, but am annoyed they didn't tell me that when I made the reservation, or when I sat down- they keep asking me all night when I'm going to leave, even though I agreed to pay already- when I get my receipt, they add an $80 ""booth charge"" and manager tells me it was $300 minimum (my bill was $220)- I explain that he said $200 earlier, and he says no, I said $300.- I say that there was some confusion, and I'm sorry, but can he waive the $80 charge?- he says it's not his rule, and he can't do anything about it - it's the owner's rule- I said, call the owner over, and manager says he's not here. I ask who's in charge? He says, me. I say, ok, then waive this, this is just silly, I really like the bar, and will come back, sorry I got confused.- he refuses to waive the fee, we argue civilly for about 20 minutes and another patron (who knows the owners) came over and tried to help, and finally he waived itI just couldn't believe that they had a table minimum, as if it was the meatpacking district. But had they just told me at first, I wouldn't have sat down. Then after he told me $200 and I spent it, I was even more annoyed when he tried to take advantage of me and just add $80 to my bill and not even tell me about it. I just noticed it on there. Oh, and they also added an automatic 20% tip (which they did tell me about) - waitress said, ""I added 20% onto the tip line already"". Uh, ok.So after the long dispute, he cut the $80, I gave the waitress a 30% tip, and hope it's ok for me to show my face in there again, one day in the future. Although with the bad taste it left in my mouth, I'm not sure I should go back...",16,,

After a couple of hours of extensive drinking and eating the manager came to ask us to squeeze into a smaller space so he could accommodate more patrons.There was no way we were going to fit 9 people in a space that would not hold 5 underweight models.Actually he did not ask. He told us to move. This linguistically challenged idiot seemed to enjoy being confrontational.Not only was he rude but also completely out of line.The poor little waitress was apologetic but we ended up leaving and went to another bar.These people are really full of themselves for a neighborhood bar that has really nothing special to offer.Needless to say we wont go back.,2,,

153,Dave P.,"New York, NY",1,4,0,1.0,5/28/2009,"You've got to be kidding me with this place.  3 of us were packed in with 5 others in a 4 man booth.  We ate some food, were watching the game and ordering a fresh round every 5 minutes.  We would have spent several hundred bucks by the time we left.  Manager comes up and informs us that, because we're done eating, it's time to get up and stand like cattle at the absurdly packed (due to its layout) bar.  Just us, mind you, not the other group of people at the same booth that were also done eating.  So we say ""can we order more food?""  Answer: ""No, you've got to get up.""  You know what? There are about 3 million sports bars in New York.  So this place is in Tribecca and owned by some meathead that played hockey, whoop de doo.  More reason to loathe that sport.  I suggest that anyone in the area use one of those yellow cars with the light on top to go somewhere where they can spend their money without being insulted.  I eagerly await the day when this place goes under.  Want a great business idea? Open a sports bar RIGHT next door and let people spend their money in peace.  You'll steal every customer that even gets a whiff of 77 Warren.",3,,

The Macaroni and Cheese (with or without bacon and caramelized shallots -- I choose WITH) is hands down the best Mac and Cheese I have had anywhere, ever. The nachos are covered in toppings and you cant stop eating them. The hot wings are big, juicy, and as good as you will find anywhere else. The french fries are addictive, to put it lightly. They have Molson Canadian on tap, and a decent selection of different beers -- even local brews. I would give this establishment 5 stars if not for the sometimes overcrowded atmosphere, but I can't blame everyone for wanting to go there.",,,

At the end of the night, some friends had left and paid off their tab, and we were winding down and decided to pay. When the bill came, my boyfriend was horrified at the cost and looked at the itemized bill and it was clear that we had been overcharged for drinks we never had. The bartender showed us our friend's tab, who had also been charged for some of the same drinks we'd had, but we had no proof to say that we hadn't drank the surplus. Either way, the manager and bartender were breathing down our necks and forced us to pay a bill we weren't comfortable with and some random ""regular"" girl came up to me and accused me of being drunk and being the reason that our bar tab was too high. She proceeded to belittle me, tell me that I didn't know what I was talking about, and threatened to kick me out of the bar (even though she wasn't an owner, employee, or manager). Considering most of the beers on the tab were not even beer brands I have ever drank, I am 100% sure that it was not my fault we were overcharged. Needless to say, we left the bar pissed off and sure to tell everyone we know NEVER to go there. Awful awful night. Worst bar experience I've ever had in any city--NY, Boston, Paris, Chicago, ec.",7,2,1
