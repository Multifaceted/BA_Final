We got the filet mignon with curly fries, Caesar salad, tuna tartare, bacon and pull apart bread. Each dish was better than the next. Also, the team was very accommodating when we had asked to push our reservation back a bit.",1,,1
1,Ira B.,"New York, NY",43,21,7,2.0,11/10/2018,"There are quite a few legit steakhouses around, where not only the steaks are prepared perfectly, but the entire experience is better, more refined, informative. This is not one of them.The only way I can describe this place is 'cocktail diner' with more of a trendy bar vibe, loud music, and average food. Service is basically non-existent. While yes, a person came and took our orders, no mention of the steaks, how they're cooked, or their char.Branded wine glasses are really cheesy and seemed like something you'd see in Las Vegas. And be careful ordering a glass; I don't typically get asked if I want 5oz or 8oz when I order a glass so I went with 8oz, not realizing it was a much higher price. To be honest, they list the size prices like how glass/bottle is listed ($1/$1) and I didn't catch this at first. I blame myself for this so make sure you see all that and then decide if you want to pay $24 for a glass, that arrives pre-poured.The steak... Filet mignon was fine and probably average. However, I ordered medium rare and it came out, in maybe 6 minutes, very rare. You cannot get the cook of the steak wrong. I saw that someone else's review mentions this as well. Friend's sirloin was over-salted, not tender and juicy, the cut was bad as the tougher muscle was not removed, and also very rare for a medium rare order.",,,
2,Arthur C.,"Manhattan, NY",408,236,30,2.0,10/31/2018,"Quality is a word that implies a certain degree of competence, and sadly my experience at Quality Eats simply did not live up to the definition.My friend had a reservation for two but had a friend join impromptu, necessitating a larger table. The host quoted us a 30-40 minute wait for a table to open up, so we decided to sit outside (it was 50 degrees and dropping) until we could be accommodated. We placed our drink and food orders during this time, hoping that we would be ushered indoors before appetizers. Alas, that never did come to pass, so we braved the chill and spent dinner al fresco. Disappointing - to say the least.As for the food, we split the Grilled Nueske's Bacon with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly lived up to its billing, an indulgent combination of pork fat, nuttiness, and sweetness. My steak, the Hanger, however was less impressive, cooked rare as opposed to the requested medium rare. The taste was otherwise fine, but getting the cook wrong is the cardinal sin of steakhouses.If it were not for my friend making the reservation, I never would have visited Quality Eats. Now that I have, safe to say I will not be back.",,,
3,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",33,64,159,3.0,10/14/2018,"Quality Eats is definitely a bit too rough around the edges to merit a return visit.  For a casual steakhouse, the food is quite delicious.  However, the service and ambience are atrocious.  This restaurant attracts the too cool for school crowd - if that's your scene, then by all means have at it.We were greeted at the door by an unsmiling hostess and offered a seat at the bar while our table was being cleared.  Once given the green light, we were shown to a cramped booth by the door and across from the bar.Shortly thereafter, a man who was supposedly our waiter took our drink order.  No introduction, no explanation of the menu or recitation of specials.  It took about 20 minutes for us to finally get our drinks and it seemed to be a common problem.  The cocktails were so-so.  The table next to us had to flag down the waiter for another round of drinks - it took them a fair amount of time and effort to stay hydrated.For starters, we order the Charred Broccoli and Baked Potato Monkey Bread.  The broccoli was well seasoned and cooked perfectly, but the portion size did not justify the $9 price tag.  The infamous Potato Monkey Bread did, however, live up to the hype.For mains, we shared the Don Ameche Filet and Sirloin Strip with a choice of curly fries.  The meat was cooked to our desired temperature state (medium-rare).  The Don Ameche Filet was tender; the Sirloin Strip juicy and well seasoned.  We did have a problem with the curly fries!  No one wants to eat previously FROZEN fries with a steak dinner.  The curly fries tasted really artificial.  The steak portion sizes appropriately reflect the price point.Anyway, we're all done and ready to hit the road - this takes the cake.  We were presented with the check - except it was for another table and for a much lower amount.  We informed the staff.  No thanks or discount given.  We could have walked out of there with a 30% off coupon and nobody would have known better.  Par for the course given the sub-par service.The food propped up the star rating on this one (sans curly fries).",,,1
4,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",138,78,73,4.0,9/22/2018,"Had a good brunch here! The food was delicious, but the cocktails steal the show, in my opinion. I got the Hemingway (pictured) x2 because one just wasn't enough. For my meal I didn't go crazy but my friend who recommended the place says I missed out by not getting a meat-based dish.Good service, nice space for smaller groups, and great bartenders!",,,1
5,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,3.0,9/6/2018,"I happened to find myself an empty seat at the bar with a craving for some steak. Chatting with the bartender, he recommended something that wouldn't have immediately caught my eye: The Don Ameche. A perfectly cooked medium rare steak sits on top of toast with chicken liver pate and some caramelized onions, next to a little side of lightly dressed greens. This is a decadent, impressive meal. It's hard to argue with it. Admittedly, I'm still developing a taste for pate, but this was really good. I didn't have any problems with the steak, so I'm really have trouble saying why this didn't put me over the moon, but it didn't. The three stars is also due in part to their really bizarre shrimp cocktail, which might have been the worst I've ever had. The shrimp appear beautiful, they're jumbo, clearly. They come with three dipping sauces, which also usually excites me (a chunky cocktail low on horseradish, a spicy aioli, and a ginger sauce), but the shrimp were so tough that I honestly should have sent them back. I don't know what happened, but it was a shame, because they were really, really hard to eat. The dipping sauces also weren't that great, the cocktail being the best choice but not by much.I liked the ambiance and the music (Amy Winehouse, White Stripes), but don't see myself making another trip here in the immediate future.",1,,
6,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",182,144,0,4.0,10/1/2018,"Friends and I stopped in here for Restaurant Week on a Wednesday. We were seated right away in the back area. For drinks, we ordered a bottle of white wine for the table. The RW menu had a ton of delicious looking options, but I went with the Grilled Bucheron Cheese as an appetizer, QE Burger as an entree, and S'More ice cream for dessert. The food was really excellent. Everything had a hearty flavor and tasted delicious. The portions were also quite large, so come hungry!Service was pretty good. Our waitress was nice and the courses came out in a good order. We didn't feel rushed either, which is always a plus. As ambience goes, it was cool too. It's not a huge place, so it can get loud in the later hours. We were, however, in the back area which was much calmer. Random, but I also couldn't help but notice the cool lighting/wiring they had in the back. Overall, Quality Eats was definitely quality. For a budget steak/meat centered restaurant, I was very pleased. I'm looking forward to bringing more people back here!",,,
7,Will M.,"Manhattan, NY",19,101,2,2.0,10/22/2018,"Price changes have changed this place. It's now just another average steak place.For about two years, this was one of my go-to restaurants. The food was quite good, and very reasonable. Every steak was under $30, with the cheapest being under $20. That was the whole point of Quality Eats: to democratize steak, or if you will, to bring it to the proletariat. And it succeeded there, with some very good dishes (I highly recommend the same appetizer everyone does - the pb&j bacon, as well as the sauteed greens as your side.)But times change. I had a subpar meal there and stopped going for about 8 months. When I came back, things had changed, and changed drastically. The $19 bavette cut is now $26, a 40%ish increase. That's huge! It's also now the only steak under $30, meaning every steak has received a price bump of $6-$10. Previously, this place prided itself as a spot to get a solid, no frill steak at a very good price. These price increases make it the same as every other average steak joint, meaning that it's just an average steak joint. Nothing special about it. The no-frills is no longer a perk. You can get much better steaks in this price range or very slightly above it. There's no reason to come here anymore.",4,,
8,Sara B.,"Jersey City, NJ",3527,649,4934,4.0,5/23/2018,"The sides were definitely the best part of my Quality Eats experience. I could probably come back and make an entire meal out of sides. Our table shared the curly fries, cacio e pepe orzo and the creamed spinach hush puppies. The curly fries came in a brown paper bag (s'cute!) and had a delicious aioli sauce on the side. The orzo was decadent - basically like eating a big bowl of ooey gooey mac and cheese. The hush puppies were also cheesy and fried to perfection. But did we just eat sides? Of course not. To start our table shared the monkey bread, a crab avocado dish and bacon. The monkey bread is a must order, no questions asked. I've normally only eaten the sweet version of this bread (doused in butter and and brown sugar) so it was interesting to see a savory version. The rolls were soft and pillowy perfection. We had to try hard to resist ordering seconds. The crab dish was light and refreshing and was served with avocado and grapefruit. But what really stole the starter show was the bacon. Two thick slabs of candied bacon topped with Jalapeño and smothered in a sweet and chunky peanut butter sauce... sounds weird but it all works so well. Exactly what our waitress said and could't be more true.For my main I went with the hanger steak. This wasn't bad but probably my least favorite part of the dish. Mainly because I ordered it medium rare and came out very rare. Still tasty, just next time I know to order it medium. The steak also came with a cute little dish of creamed corn and arugula and grilled red onion. This was alot of food but desserts are a must. They have an adorable strawberry shortcake dessert which tastes just like the good humor classic. We also had a s'mores cup - this was my favorite and I loved the burnt marshmallows on top.  And of course, there were also cocktails. I started with a refreshing gin and grapefruit drink and finished with an Aperol spritz - they have this on tap which is pretty cool.Overall, a solid pick for a decadent meal. Quality Eats serves steakhouse fare without the stuffy steakhouse vibe and they do it well. I'd come back for sure.",28,13,23
9,Eric F.,"Manhattan, NY",213,55,15,5.0,8/20/2018,"I have now been to two Quality Eats and I must say, high quality drinks and superb food.  Sometimes I think about the peanut butter beacon appetizer and I reach for open table to make a reservation only to realize I just had dinner. The little things is what makes Quality Eats go from good to great, their special little twits on cocktails and entrees will make anyone a foodie for the night.  Well done QE 5 stars, looking forward to trying more of the menu next time.",,,
10,Christina B.,"New York, NY",284,257,756,4.0,5/23/2018,"Known as the more conscious of the Quality restaurants, Quality Eats still offers some takes of the same dishes at Quality Italian/Meat. The food overall is good and interesting but still a bit pricy for the portion sizes. The one thing I felt was a bit lacking in comparison to the other restaurants was the service - our waitress was not able to make solid recommendations on much but thankfully we read some reviews before we came. We tried the PBJ bacon (delicious, but only comes with about two small strips), monkey bread (cheesy with a side of bacon butter), the spinach hush puppies (these were basically spinach and cheese which was mixed then fried), crab & avocado (citrusy with fresh crab), hanger steak (accompanied by onions and butter), salmon (with chimichurri) and the s'mores dessert (small but the marshmallow ice cream is delicious). I also tried the strawberry infused cucumber gin drink which was tart but refreshing.",,,
11,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,4.0,3/4/2018,"I came here on Friday at 6:30pm with a friend. We hoped to catch happy hour but they NO LONGER HAVE HAPPY HOUR as the season approaches Spring. Upsetting. The host and the waiters were very friendly and helpful. The food came quick. The ambiance was dark, moody, romantic, accompanied with light music and is perfect for a date. We started with drinks:- Key money and Crowd pleaser: Both came really nicely presented. Tasted good but not strong. Overpriced. Then with the food:- Crab & avocado: Refreshing and tasty. There were small bits of crab with citrus grapefruit and creamy avocado paste. The avocado cream did not taste like avocado but rather a mixture of herbs and cilantro. - Nueske's bacon: Very good and outshined the crab/avocado appetizer. The bacon was thick, crispy and salty. It paired nicely with the peanut butter and jalapeno ""jelly"" I never had anything quite like it. Highly recommended. - Hanger steak: We asked for medium and it came medium rare.. almost rare. It was burnt on the outside which made the meat taste bitter. It's disappointing considering the fact that this place specializes in steak. The corn creme brulee however blew our minds. It was sweet and savory with bits of corn almost like a corn chowder. So creamy comforting and delicious. I was so sad that it was gone after 3 bites. Overall I had a nice experience. The menu is not that clear on how the food is actually prepared so I highly suggest you ask the waiters to explain the items. If it wasn't for my burnt undercooked steak this place would've gotten 5 stars from me. I really enjoyed everything else but I would head somewhere else if I ever wanted steak.",5,,3
12,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,3.0,2/22/2018,"I recently came here for Winter Restaurant​ Week. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and had high expectations. The interior was dark and sexy with a full bar in the front and a cozy dining area where we were given booth seating. At first, the hostess was not going to seat us due to the fact that our whole party had not yet arrived. My friend's friend had accidentally gone to the uptown location so I knew that she would be quite late. My reservation was at 6 PM, so at that time, I explained the situation and asked very nicely if my friend and I could be seated in the meantime, which they allowed with a caveat​. We would have to order all the food at the same time, including for the individual who had not arrived yet. Once seated, we had a long discussion and the manager, who informed us that we have the table until 7:45 PM. I thought it was a slightly poor form for the restaurant to already let us know we have a time limit as soon as we sat down. Finally, my friend was able to convince the waiter to let the 2 of us order first. For my appetizer, I chose the Grilled Nueske's Bacon which was excellent! There were 3 hearty, thick pieces of bacon, served with crunchy peanut butter on the bottom and cucumber cubes marinated in jalapeno jelly. The bacon was incredibly crispy with amazing taste, caramelized to have a slightly sweet flavor. It tasted wonderful on its own, but the peanut butter and jalapeno flavors added to the deliciousness and gave the dish a nice complexity that balanced everything out well. I had a tough time deciding which entree to order. At first, ​I was thinking of getting the bavette cut steak, but I had just gotten a root canal done so having something too chewy was not an option. The leg of lamb steak also sounded appealing​, but when I heard that a lot of it was fat, I decided not to go that route. So, then there was salmon or the patty melt club burger. I finally decided on the patty melt club burger, because our waitress recommended that highly and I wasn't really feeling like I wanted salmon. In retrospect, I should have gotten the salmon - I would have felt much better about paying what I did if I went with the more expensive main course. The ""Patty Melt Club Burger"" is not actually a burger. It's a sandwich made with toasted sourdough​ bread. Also, there was no bacon so not sure why the word ""club"" is in the title. It was just sirloin meat with melted cheese. While the meat was tender, juicy, flavorful and the cheese was good, there was too much bread. Overall, I wasn't that satisfied. I tried some of my friend's leg of lamb steak, which was rich and tasty, though indeed quite fatty. Also, I did not like the anchovy butter on top - It was way too fishy. The desserts were all frozen, even the S'mores one that I ordered. It was S'mores ice cream, with a chocolate-y cookie on top, graham cracker crumbles, chocolate chips and mounds of soft marshmallow fluff. I really enjoyed the marshmallow mingled with chocolate chips, cookie and ice cream. The ingredients came together beautifully and it was all very yummy. Our waitress was personable and nice. When it was 7:45 PM, they actually did not ask us to leave the table so we had a little more time than expected. I was disppointed with the food and my experience here. I do not plan on coming back.",8,4,6

Updated review",Perhaps I came on an off night but my boyfriend and I agreed that brunch is much better than dinner. Our server was great but our empty water glasses needed to be refilled especially since our second round of drinks were nowhere in sight. Idk about him but I was thirsty. The monkey bread didn't taste as it did the first time I got it. I didn't even want to finish it. Shrimp cocktail was hard and I had to use a knife to cut it up before I could eat it. I got the grilled octopus for my entree and it was definitely overcooked and very chewy when I could bite into it. Boyfriend got steak and it came with a strange cheese side that did not pair well. At least now I know better. Brunch only!,1,,1
14,Sean C.,"Rochester, NY",14,106,244,5.0,3/26/2018,"Quality Eats was our best meal during our recent trip to the West Village. Our friend and former resident of the West Village highly recommended the restaurant and we are glad she did!  First of all I have never seen a wine stack and have fallen in love with the idea. It was really fun to plan our wine pairings and order the flight accordingly. Also, I felt the pricing was reasonable considering you are getting a bottle worth of 3 different wines ($48). Based on all the rave reviews of the Grilled Nueske's Bacon, we gave the appetizer a try. It was unique and delicious. A wonderful combination of sweet, salty, crunchy, spicy scrumptiousness. (Paired well with Sauv Blanc)We both decided to try their steak offerings for our entrees. Both the strip steak and Don Ameche were flavorful and cooked perfectly. I also loved the creamed corn creme brûlée!Besides wonderful food and drinks, the service was also superb. Tre was our waitress and was spectacular. She knew the menu inside and out and was very friendly. A must try if you find yourself in the area!",1,,
15,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1478,4331,5.0,8/3/2018,"Had a great dinner here! The cocktails are great and the don Ameche definitely lived up to the hype. I also loved the crab and avocado. Bacon and PB&J app is also very unique and tasty. Sunchokes were amazing, too. Don't miss the ice cream scoops for dessert; I had a seasonal bbq peach one that was really good.",,,
16,Emma G.,"Williamsburg, NY",6,46,132,4.0,3/25/2018,"A great option for a weeknight meal when you are craving a good steak and don't want to shell out the big bucks. After a rocky start, we had a delicious and filling meal here with well prepared steaks and great complimentary sides. While waiting for our table we had a couple cocktails. I had a refreshing strawberry-infused gin drink while my boyfriend ordered what he thought would be a similar mezcal drink. Instead, an outrageous, overly sweet drink served in an ostentatious trophy was presented to him to our dismay. It was almost like an easter egg hidden in an overall, seemingly normal menu meant to trick us. We laughed it off and had forgotten about it before our appetizer led to yet another shocking surprise. To start we ordered the grilled bucheron cheese. What we received was a HUGE piece of grilled bucheron cheese (image a piece you would lay out on a charcuterie board for a party of 8) covered in honey and sesame seeds served alongside 3 miniscule pieces of bread. While the honey and cheese combo were quite good, the disparity in bread to cheese (we had to ask for more bread two seperate times) made this dish a definite miss. At this point we were pretty disappointed and ready to write the restaurant off as a whole. However, when the main course started to arrive we were pleasantly surprised. Both the sirloin and the filet mignon were excellent, well sizes portions - especially for the price. If you have to pick, definitely go for the filet. I'm not a big fan of sweets so I didn't like the corn brûlée dish that accompanied the steaks but I also didn't miss it as the sides we ordered (fries, sautéed greens, and parsnips) were delicious and more than enough food. Out of those, the greens was the highlight - a perfect complement to the red meat and cooked with garlic, sesame oil and chili flakes. We scraped the bowl clean. It's easy to see why this place remains highly recommended for its price range and I would definitely recommend it with a few caveats.",,,
17,Manna C.,"New York, NY",300,130,421,4.0,1/23/2018,"I came here for Restaurant Week Winter 2018 and made a reservation on Resy for three people. It was super convenient. At this point, I've been to Restaurant Week several times and have tried many restaurants but the menu and concept was really appealing. Quality eats is a play on quality meats with m in meats crossed out - so don't think you're at the wrong place when you're outside! They wouldn't seat me until the whole party was there, which is understandable. I started off with a cocktail, Key Money, which was made with strawberry gin, mint, lime and cucumber cubes. I love cucumbers and this drink was exactly what I wanted. My friend ordered the Smokin' Grass, which was made with scotch, lemongrass, lemon and gingered honey. It was very smooth and easy to drink. Cocktails are a bit pricey at $14 though. First, for my appetizer, I ordered the Grilled Nueske's Bacon, which was amazing! The combination of the peanut butter and the jalapeño jelly was incredible and complimented the pork belly. Moving on to the main course, I ordered the leg of lamb steak with anchovy butter and charred scallions as garnish. It was definitely not what I expected but it was still good. I'm not a big fan of anchovies but it worked with this lamb. However, I was not asked which wellness I wanted and it was a bit overdone for me. Finally, moving on to dessert, the S'more, which was a cute bowl of marshmallow ice cream, a graham cracker, small meringues and fudge swirls on top. The graham cracker was a bit difficult to pierce so I ended up eating most of the ice cream instead. My other friends ordered the Humor Me that reminded me of an upside strawberry and vanilla sorbet in a cup with a waffle cone sticking out. It was light and fruity but I think I made the right decision with the S'more. Overall, solid place to have dinner and I will be back to try the other dishes.",1,3,

19,Melissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",244,545,8,4.0,9/18/2018,"We came here for brunch and it was quite solid. I can't remember the exact name of my dish but it was an eggs Benedict with some type of fried green vegetable. It was quite delicious. My husband had an egg sandwich on their signature monkey bread which he loved. The place is nice inside with high quality air conditioning and even though it was premium Sunday brunch time, we easily got a table with no reservation. I really liked my food here but prices were a little steep and portions a bit smaller than I would have liked. I definitely would love to return here to try their dinner.",,,

My food on the other hand was just okay, which is disappointing because I kept hearing great things about this place. We were put in the back section of the restaurant, which was fine. We got everything we ordered and it took no time at all. The problem was that I was picturing something different for my meal. I ordered the Spinach Beignet Benedict, it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. I also ordered the monkey bread, which I thought would be the cinnamon monkey bread, but I was mistaken. I ended up getting a cheesy garlicky pull apart bread. It was fine, but I probably wouldn't order these two meals again. I would go back though, but would order something different. I just think the dishes weren't for me.",,,

Updated review","The ""M"" in the sign is not working but that's about all that isn't working about this local eatery that hits ""knocktails"" out of the park and the food is not only quality it is quantity when I am eating. I ordered the nueske bacon with peanut butter and jalapeño jelly- that made my tongue fall out but they keep a very floor (I could taste the cleanliness) and so I popped my tongue right back in and gobbled down grilled cheese to what I thought was ""discovery channel"" by blood hound gang but it was a different song that I couldn't Shazam fast enough. Still, it was good satin' music!!  I eat to the beat of an un-shazaamable drummer so this place is perfect for me!  We had Mexican street corn but the only thing street about it was it had lived in Compton and produced a rap album with several prominent gangsters. That's some cold ass corn. (It was served hot!)Patty melt?  Yep.  Laminated menus.  You better believe it.  Beet hummus?  Meet my tummy-us. Together. Tummy and quality eats. What's not to love. Focused on the quantity they'll handle the quality.  Friendship & food,The original yelp gangster,T.J.",2,3,3

I feel like this place is a starter-steakhouse, like a training bra, for 20-something steak eaters. The cuts of steak were unimpressive. The place is LOUD. Everyone seemed to be competing to be heard.The waiter was very nice but a bit forgetful. My friend was a bit annoyed that he kept forgetting things but I thought he was nice enough. Maybe it was very busy that day?To start we had the bacon peanut butter appetizer and it was good, probably the only thing we would enjoy that evening. The steak tartare was the opposite. It was covered in a sauce that makes me wonder if the quality of the meat was being hidden?For our main, we ordered the rib eye for 2 which came served in a huge plate consisting of too many fingerling potatoes (filler obvi) and a tomahawk steak bone? Odd. We skipped desert as it looked unimpressive mostly because it's served in paper cups/containers?!! I don't know if they are trying to be trendy or ""look at us we are so laid back"" but when I go out to dinner, or even have dinner at home, I don't eat from paper containers.All in all, a very average dinner and not a place I'd be up for returning to.",,1,

26,Christina L.,"New York, NY",302,173,213,4.0,10/9/2017,"This is one of the best steakhouses I've been to in a while. My uber dropped me off at this quaint restaurant in the west village where I met the birthday girl and two other friends at the bar. They quickly seated us and we came prepared. We knew we were definitely going to get the monkey bread and fillet mignon. We also ordered crab avocado, rib eye, salmon, and side of sautéed veggies (we needed some fiber to balance out the protein lol). For desert, we ordered the salted caramel cake for two. Monkey bread: hot, just out of the oven bread. I think it was overrated but at the time I needed it because I was starving and needed some carbs in my body. But when do I not want carbs? Lol stupid question...Crab avocado: it was delicious and kind of small to share for 4 people. We had about a bite each but it was extremely flavorful and it was a hit! Don Amiche or something aka fillet mignon: extremely tender and cooked to a perfection. We requested a medium rare and it was beautifully done. It came with a side of onion sauce on top of bruschetta. Each of us (4) had one savory slice each. Rib eye: this was my favorite cut and it was a very large portion so I would share this for 2 or come extremely hungry. I felt each bite just melt in my mouth and I'm salivating just thinking about this!!Salmon: this wasn't my favorite dish, but it was flavorful. I would just prefer the other dishes over the salmon. The dishes came with some greens so I didn't think it was necessary to order sautéed greens. Nevertheless the side was very good, but nothing special. Caramel cake: the menu says it's for 2, but I really feel like it's for 4-5 people. I guess it depends on who these people are lol I went with super skinny Asian girls and we just had so much food before we ordered the cake. Just for your reference. Anyways, the cake came in a hot pan and the waitress drizzles warm salted caramel all over the cake. The dish comes with a side of vanilla ice cream. It was literally heaven. The cake wasn't too sweet and everything paired so well together. I felt like I was dreaming. The food and ambiance really deserves top rating, and i would take off only 1/2 star for the service if I could. But since I can't, I guess one star it is. This is due to the service. The host and waitress were not as nice and friendly as you would expect at a reputable restaurant in NYC. The host told us they needed the table back by 8:30 (1.5 hours) which was fine but I thought it was slightly unnecessary. I guess it was just an FYI so we speed up the ordering, eating, and wrapping up. I checked the time and we were out by 8:30! Great timing all around :) We also told the host pre-dinner to have the staff bring out the ""birthday cake"" on the dessert menu without asking us for dessert, but failed to relay this to the waitress. Luckily, the birthday girl went to the bathroom, so we were able to tell the waitress.",3,,

29,Justin M.,"Newton, MA",0,5,0,2.0,8/6/2018,"Wife and I came in for our anniversary dinner last week. She was very much looking forward to a steak dinner, and we were in the area to try a few other places both before and after.We went with the restaurant week prix fixe, ordering the wedge salad and shrimp cocktail. Her salad was nice - well balanced, tasty bits of thick bacon and not over-dressed. My shrimp cocktail was strange. The shrimp were mangled and unceremoniously piled on top of a runny mess of southwestern-ish sauce and a few not quite ripe avocado slices. Served in an awkwardly shaped drinking glass, it left a sad impression that the garnish of cilantro couldn't possibly elevate.Our steaks were great, and probably saved the evening. Well-seasoned, and cooked beautifully, we both ordered the Bavette cut, medium and medium rare. The sides were simple enough to highlight the steak - a simply dressed salad of greens and creme brulee corn. The latter was a bit too precious, and I did not appreciate the over-caramelized (burnt) crust adorning my tiny ramekin.Dessert was pretty depressing. Are you really going to serve a frozen-solid paper cup of ice cream with dry, bland toppings and a cheezy birthday candle? We ordered both the birthday cake and smores options, expecting plated desserts with maybe some effort put into said plating. Both were disappointing, and came with way too much ice cream to finish after a full meal. Both were frozen so thoroughly that when my wife tried to get a spoonful, it toppled into her lap.If you're into over-priced drinks, desserts that belong at Dairy Queen, and appetizers that are wildly hit-and-miss, check this place out.",1,1,

A variety of dipping sauces that are full of flavor and you really can't go wrong with carbs!Doubled up on the Patty Melt Club, Steak Du Jour, and curly fries for the table and there was no regrets there! Probably ate way too much in one meal, but everything was just so good that we really didn't let anything slide. Prices are just about right for brunch, but for the value that you are getting, $21 for a steak is so affordable and worth it.

This dish comes with crab meat and citrus segments served over a cilantro avocado sauce. The flavor combinations were really good. We each got a bavette cut steak for our main. Both were cooked and seasoned perfectly. We shared the haricot verts on the side which were also delicious. We loved the decor of the restaurant and our service was fast. For the price, this is the best steak experience you can get in the city!

It had a subtle sweetness and the beets were delicious.Grilled Green Goddess salad.  I could've done without this salad, it wasn't anything special.Hamachi Tostada - This was very tasty but a small portion.Don Ameche - Perfectly cooked to a medium rare, and extremely flavorful (salt, seasoning, etc).Brown-Bag Curly Fries - Who doesn't like curly fries?Overall, the food was delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable.  For the above and 3 glasses of wine total, it was $50 without tip.I will definitely be back!",1,1,2

Period. No recommendations. Just stood over my husband impatiently. Who runs out of hamburgers at 7 PM on a Saturday?! He forgot to put in an item but claimed the kitchen ""burned"" our Brussels sprouts--that were supposed to be prepared charred and roasted--so they comped us the side dish.

Updated review","Wanted to add an update as I went here for brunch for the first time. They've got a great brunch menu, good variety of options. Ordered the Patty Melt again, it's still my favorite thing on the menu. Also ordered the bacon egg and cheese, on their monkey bread and with their thick cut bacon. The bacon really took this sandwich to the next level. Cocktails were delicious- tried one with raspberries and prosecco , and another with espresso, cream and Irish whiskey. Staff were all nice and accommodating given a slight wait for 2 at 3PM. Highly recommend for brunch!",,,
39,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",784,815,371,4.0,11/5/2017,"Owned by the Quality Meats/Italian people, this West Village eatery is fantastic. I have no idea what is meant by ""concept restaurant"" but whatever this place is, I love it. I went to a show on Macdougal and we had no reservation. The West Village is so different from anything uptown. Madness. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a bar seat (they have a waitlist) but we ordered a drink and stood for about 15 before a couple people left. The menu is innovative and pretty reasonable. They do have low 30 entrees but lots of choices (appetizers, sides) in the teens. The ""Patty Melt Club"" is phenomenal. It's a club because a triple decker but on the thin side. Spicy slaw on top is sublime. The Perfect Manhattan (half sweet, half dry vermouth) was indeed perfect (and big). Nice selection of wines by the glass starting at 11 or 12 and going up into the 20s. Terrific bartender. At 9:30 it's deafeningly loud to an Upper East Side girl in her mid-forties. But by about 10:30 it chills out. I loved the food and will be back.",3,1,3

Immediately the vibe is comfortable and casual while still upholding modern and inviting decor. The hostess was very personable and accommodating. It's rare that you find a place casual enough in Ny that you can hear your conversation well yet the food is still outstanding. I had the Charred steak salad and the cacio e Pepe orzo and they were both incredible. Highly recommend!!,,,

The spicy slaw added some kick to it and the portions were huge! You can definitely share this. Recommend this place!",2,,
44,Karmán M.,"San Francisco, CA",1,24,10,5.0,4/24/2018,"-- Sensational burger! Don't let the name bother you, just come! --My friend and I hesitated for a while before we go because of the name (such lame name ...) but it turned out to be completely worthwhile. BACON. We ordered the crab meat salad and bacon as appetizer. The crab meat is very fresh so no complains. The bacon is entirely something else! It is well cured and roasted to bring out the best and balanced flavor. The peanut butter is surprisingly good in paring with the bacon. The hint of bitterness compensates for the fattiness of the bacon, while the creamy texture brings out the crunchyness of the bacon. An innovative and amazingly well-done pairing. Bravo! BURGER. The burger is even better! The patty is juicy and savory, which is the direct result of good ingredient and skilled handling. Using toasted plain bread instead of the usual sweet burger bread + reduced use of cheese, the flavor of the beef is even more distinctively highlighted!A perfection! It's so hard to be innovative in a well established category such as burger. But quality eats's burger is definitely singular in it's texture and flavor. No matter where you are, the dining place is worth a trip just for the burger.The wine option is also amazing. $48 for essentially 6 glasses of 3 types of wine (we picked a white and 2 reds from South America). Definitely good for a date or a group.Overall the food is 4.5-5. Extra points for being differentiating. I respect innovation way more that good decor or pricey ingredients.Will I go again?Hell yeah!Attaching my standard of 1-5:5 - so good that you should fly there just to try it. Innovative and delicious. Strong menu overall.4 - outstanding in its category locally. Would worth up to 1h drive. Strong dishes here and there.3.5 - great food here and there but unstable quality. Would be a good choice for take-out but definitely not constitute a good date night dinner.3 - if you come with expectation of 3-star food you won't feel disappointed. Mediocre at best.2 - subpar food / service. Something might come out to ruin your experience.1 - no, just no.",1,,1
45,Joseph T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",116,11,34,4.0,2/10/2018,"This is the hipper, more informal offshoot of Quality Meats. It's been hyped for a while now and almost (kind of does , if not for my curmudgeonly resistance to hype) lives up to it. A great meal. First- the Nueske's bacon with peanut butter and apple-jalapeño jelly: if you like those flavors individually, GET THIS. It is the BOMB. The flavors combine deliciously and it's a dish to put on a ""dishes to try in NYC"" list.The Don Ameche. Sirloin sliced and served on toast that's been slathered with chicken liver and caramelized onions. With balsamic drizzled arugula. Damn, Daniel! At it again! Sides like scalloped sun chokes, sliced and sizzling on a silver platter like cheese drenched coins of the Greek God Apollo's favor. Or Creamed spinach hush puppies, which are a Dr Evil chef's triumphant way of making creamed spinach MORE evil (and bad for you, and tasty). They have scoops of ice cream topped with cake for dessert, but the real move is the sticky toffee pudding cake (isn't it always?) which is wayyyy too much for one person. Unless you are a dire wolf from Game of Thrones, that is. Then order 2. Think moist, sweet fig cake baked in bubbling brown butter and drooling in sticky toffee sauce, hot out of the oven.",,,

We ordered the crab and avocado starter, which had a spicy kick to it with a beautiful green sauce to it.As a main course, we ordered the steak for two and then a side of the creamed spinach hush puppies. The hush puppies were AMAZING. They give you three of them so eat slowly! The steak comes with crispy potatoes and some arugula on the top. Comes with the bone in a cast iron.

Our waitress had a rude attitude towards us during the entire meal. Not only did she take forever to come take our order, she gave us so much push back when we told her what she wanted. My friend ordered the Grilled Nueske's Bacon, and she politely asked to have it without the Jalapeno Jelly. Our waitress responds with ""...you know that the jelly is half of the dish right? You will just be eating bacon"" - in the MOST condescending way. What's wrong with wanting just bacon? My friend said that was fine - she doesn't like Jalapeno. The waitress then went to my other friend, and my friend said she was going to share the bacon dish. The waitress responds"" you are going to share? You know it is basically one strip of bacon right?"" So rude! We all just wanted to order their cocktails, share some appetizers, and catch up. But our waitress was so rude about it. The other half of our group ordered steaks, so I don't see what the issue was.   I had their Long-Bone Short Rib Steak ($27) and thought it was awful. Dry and flavorless. The dish was basically a huge bone but just 4-5 fork fulls of meat on the bone. Their corn brulee tasty and unique though.",7,1,

The bartender made a solid drink while we were waiting and the bar itself is pretty entertaining with all of the carvings in it. The food was so, so good and honestly better than we were expecting. We loved everything. Two of us split two (oops) orders of monkey bread, the Caesar salad, the chickpea rice appetizer and the patty melt.

Pieces of crab were pretty big. Was wondering if it was lobster instead lolWe both had the top blade flat iron cooked medium rare, which was also good. Plain, but I like plain steak without any sauce. It was seasoned just right. The plate also comes with some type of creme brulee with corn in the bottom of the ramekin. It was interesting. When I first saw pictures of the dish, I thought it wouldn't be enough steak for me but when i actually ate it, the dish was actually decently sized and my stomach was satisfied.For dessert, we tried the s'more and the bar snacks ice cream scoops. They were served in a medium sized cup. They were both delicious but I liked the saltiness of the bar snacks on top of my vanilla ice cream.

Adorable decor with vintage golds, some pastels, a neon sign at the bar... In love. Our server (I think the receipt said Kate B) was super friendly and cute! We came at 7:30 ish on a weekday night and were quoted for 8:30, and got a table at exactly 8:30. The bar area was sort of divided from the main dining area, but a great place to talk with friends and look around the restaurant, and it makes it not too bad to wait. There are hooks to hang your bags and coats under the stand-up bar area, and two higher circular tables you can sit at if it's not taken already. I'm mostly very impressed by this place, as it's not your average ""steakhouse"" - I'm sick of those! Creative and fun drink menu (get the Moscow Mule if you like them, it's on tap and I can taste the QUALITY of their homemade ginger beer/ale) and the desserts all sounded amazing and different (why do steakhouses always have to sell only tiramisu, creme brûlée, and key lime pie???). And the service was actually upbeat! Food: We had the curly fries, lobster and avocado, sirloin, and filet mignon. Everything was pretty good BUT the only bad thing was how disappointing the filet mignon was. It was flavourless and so dry, like someone just put it on a fire for a bit and said""Okay, it's done"". I was so embarrassed by how terrible it was, I didn't want to say anything. The sirloin was much better! The dessert was amazing (we had the strawberry and vanilla) and came in a to-go cup so you could take it home if you wanted.I would most certainly come again as the menu seems pretty diverse and everything sounds delicious that you can come more than once to get a different experience -  but never order the filet mignon ever again!",,,1

I've mentioned numerous times that I've always wanted to try this place and he listened! It was Friday night, and he managed to get a reservation for us. We were seated towards the front of the place right across from the bar. The restaurant was long and it seemed like the back dining room is larger. We ordered a drink each, he got a beer and I got an old fashion. Drinks were decent but nothing to be WOWed about. For appetizer we just went with what fellow yelpers recommended and got the monkey bread and a side of fries. The fries were alright, the oil was seeping out from the brown bag it was served in. The monkey bread was really good, soft and came with bacon butter (what more can I ask for). For mains, my boyfriend ordered the Long-Bone Short Rib Steak and I had the The Don Ameche. It came like I ordered it, medium rare and it smelled delicious. There was only 4 pieces on the plate but it was enough for me. There are no complaints to the steak I ordered but also nothing really more to rave about. It was a nicely cooked steak. I had a piece of the short ribs and it was even better. Soft, fall off-the-bone and really flavorful. If I were to come back, I'd order that. On a friday night, I expected this place to be packed and bustling, and it was. My only complaint was that the tables were a little too close to each other. When my neighboring table came in and out of their seats, we would have to be cautious that they don't knock over anything on our table and vice-versa.",,,

For tanner we had the strip steak and bronzino. The latter was excellent and the two fillets were plentiful.  Our medium steak had to be recooked because it was medium rare.

I am of the belief that casual food is usually much better than fine dining. They do not give you bread when you sit down. All of the dishes were really heavy even the salad and I left feeling sort of sick and just kind of gross. I hate giving bad reviews but it is very expensive and not great.,,,

Service was prompt and staff very attentive. We started with the amazing Bacon appetizer.We then enjoyed the ""Tomahawk"", a steak designed to serve several.

62,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2142,1291,3204,3.0,1/17/2017,"I came to Quality Eats for an early dinner on this raining and wet evening.  I made a reservation through Resy.  We were one of the first few to dine for dinner and the seating in the back was empty for at least half an hour.  It gets packed pretty fast around 7:30pm - New Yorkers like to eat later!I don't drink, but I was told the drinks were tasty (and slightly pricey).  They were definitely pretty for the cameras, though!  Service was great - our water was filled multiple times and someone constantly came over to make sure we were doing okay.  Excellent service!  Atmosphere - seating is very tight, especially for tables of 2.  It pretty much feels like you are sitting with other people and it's hard to get out if you are sitting on the inside by the wall.To start, we got the beet taboulleh and hummus as well as the hamachi crudo.  The beet taboulleh was interesting - definitely not what I was expecting and not your typical taboulleh at all.  It was over a bed of hummus and served with what seemed like Focaccia bread.  Overall this was an interesting combination of flavors and a way different take than what I was expecting, but it was still enjoyable.  The hamachi crudo had amazing flavor with the grilled pineapple and the tangy marinade - I would get this again, however, it could do with more hamachi.We shared an entree and got the grilled octopus.  I wasn't too much of a fan of the octopus as I thought it was slightly on the chewy side and a little overcooked.  The tangy lentil and bean concoction that came with the octopus was on the sour side and I just didn't feel like it went well with the octopus.  We got the scalloped sunchoke for our side and oh my goodness - it was delicious!  Definitely the highlight of the night.  If you've never had sunchokes, it has a distinct flavor and this was a creative way to cook it.  YUM.To end our meal, I got the birthday cake sundae as recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint.  I loved the slightly salty and buttery frosting mixed with the cubes of (dry) birthday cake on top of a creamy chocolate ice cream.  I don't usually like chocolate ice cream, but this was good.  The candle with a match was a cute little touch.Prices are okay (starters are on the pricey side), but the service is great and there are a few things definitely worth trying out at Quality Eats!",7,1,3
63,Jules C.,"New York, NY",0,15,11,1.0,1/21/2018,"2.5/5 for food, minus 1 star for surprisingly rude serviceHeard really great things about Quality Eats, so decided to pop over without a reservation on Saturday night. Waited for 1.5 hours for table of 2 - not too bad. First red flag - when the server came out with the caesar salad (a few awkward whole heads of lettuce on a plate), we asked if the kitchen could chop and toss the salad.  The server rudely said ""we don't do that here"" and walked off abruptly. Next, the steaks came out. I ordered the Don Ameche medium rare, which came out super hard at the edges and really tough and hard to chew - not at all what you would expect from a filet cut.  Considering all the good reviews for this cut, I was really surprised at how hard and tough it was. We also asked the server if he could bring some steak sauce, and again he says ""no, we don't do that"" and walks off rudely. Lastly, the creamed spinach hush puppies were pretty disgusting - overly salty, very dry, and just tasted bad.  We decided not to send them back since we each had a bite, but when we were paying, I politely tried to ask the waitress about the quality of the hush puppies.  She very rudely states ""it's personal preference"" and stomps off before I was done speaking. On a positive note, we thought the monkey bread and sunchokes were tasty.  The drinks were also good, and the restaurant had a cool vibe. I'm guessing people rate this place so highly because it is trendy - food and service very overrated.  Recommend paying slightly more for actually good food and better service somewhere else.",4,1,
64,Peggie Y.,"New York, NY",212,180,2469,4.0,1/31/2017,"I came here to celebrate New Year's Eve because it was one of the few restaurants that still offers an a la carte menu on New Year's Eve.  I ordered the hamachi tartare (special menu item) as appetizer,  my friend and I ordered the Dom Ameche and Long-bone short rib steak as our entrees.  And we also ordered the baked potato monkey bread as a side.  The Dom Ameche is about the most expensive item on their menu.  If you are not familiar with the sister restaurants like Quality Meats or Quality Italian, this restaurant is basically owned by the same group, it is sort of a steakhouse that serves off-cut meats such as the bavette cut.  As a result of that, the food prices are lower than the prices at Quality Meats and Quality Eats.  It also explains the M taken out of the word ""Meats"" to turn the restaurant's name into Quality Eats. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare for the Dom Ameche and the arugula leaves on the plate were delicious as well.  The long bone short rib was cooked medium and it was good, but a little bit on the dry side.  I would not recommend getting the hanger steak, as it would probably be much drier.  The baked potato monkey bread is similar to the garlic monkey bread served at Quality Italian (complimentary at Quality Italian), but it came with bacon butter.  The bread tasted so good with the bacon butter but it felt a little heavy for me. For desserts, we ordered the dressed up scoop of Gelato, the birthday cake.  The dessert came with a candle on top and a pack of matches.  What is a better way to top off the New Year's Eve meal than to blow off a candle on a birthday cake dessert?   They also offer so many other options for the dressed up gelato.  I can't wait to try then all!!  Overall, I think the decor of this restaurant is cute, the service is good and that the food prices are reasonable.  I definitely think this would be a great spot for a date.  However, if you are more into the Prime cut steak, go to their sister restaurants, remember, the whole concept of this place is to offer off cut meats.  For desserts,",1,1,2
65,Norman H.,"New York, NY",99,67,0,4.0,7/9/2018,"First, let me start out with a BRAVA to our server, Tre.  If there were six stars, she'd get them.  Seven?  No problem.I was set to not like this restaurant:  it did not have a good feel to it, when we entered, and the push back we got on asking to change our table, because my partner has a bad back, was disconcerting (we were told they needed all the tables with straight back chairs, for a big party.  That big party never came in while we were there). My other quibble - and it's a major one - is the menu is not really descriptive.  For example, we ate excellent Caesar and wedge salads - except neither one of them looked like a Caesar or wedge salad.  There was no ""wedge,"" and as others have reported,  the Caesar is chunked lettuce, rather than leaves.  The flavor and freshness on both, were amazing, but calling them what they do,  leads to expectations that, as other reviews show, lead to let downs.We also had tuna and the burger.  Now, the burger was great and plaudits to the manager for coming out and telling me  ""I saw you ordered it rare.  You should know that our MEDIUM rare is very pink, and people frequently send the rare burger back.""  As it happens, I was fine with the really good burger, well cooked, rare as requested.  The tuna for my partner was great, once he squeezed lemon over it to neutralize the brown sugar glaze on the top (which was not in the menu description).  Plates are very much in the ""French style,"" in that you get some potatoes, and a little salad, no vegetables.  There's a long list of vegetable side dishes you can pick from, but if you're expecting veggies with the plate,  that's not happening.  Also, some of the steaks have very odd names, and when  you ask, you find out the preparation might be a bit off putting .  For example, the ""Don Ameche"" comes on top of chicken liver pate.   That is something that a diner MIGHT want to know about. Others have said the prices are high, or the portions too small, or things were overpriced.  We didn't find any of that to be true.  We'll go back to try more things.  Food was great.  Just be ready for surprises.  Or ask lots and lots and lots of questions.

I got the short rib which was huge -  it had a nice char and flavor to it but the cut itself is very tendony so can be a bit hard to chew. It came with a side corn creme brûlée, spinach and onions.

My friend refused to split the bacon appetizer with me and it haunts me to this day (obviously the answer is to go back). Anyway, we shared the grilled bucheron cheese, which was excellent and paired well with the pear jam. We each went with the Bavette steak which is actually a pretty generous portion, and was cooked perfectly. I think we might have also had the cacio e pepe orzo which was less memorable (clearly). It's a pretty dark, loud and cramped space but I'd go back anyway, at least to try the bacon. And probably their birthday cake ice cream.",,,

The kind of restaurants that leave you feeling like you're a little smarter and a littler classier than most people out there, even though you're just gonna go home and change into sweatpants the second you unlock your door.THE DON AMECHE steak was just as enjoyable as any steak I've paid double the price for, if not more so. It actually made me feel kind of dumb for thinking something this good could only cost $60. The GRILLED NUESKE'S BACON with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly will make you question your understanding of what good food is. You'll get inexplicably mad at your grandma for never making BAKED POTATO MONKEY BREAD at family gatherings. It's a lot of negative side effects for being such delicious food.But don't let the side effects deter you. Go here with friends if for no other reason than to justify ordering the stacked wine. It allows you to sample a few different wines instead of committing to just one. Convenient for the non-connoisseurs out there. Besides, it just looks really cool on the table.We had a pretty early dinner here. In fact, we were one of the only two groups in the back room, but the ambiance was still a lot of fun.

75,Payal L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",564,204,536,5.0,12/17/2016,"Quality Eats is the little [downtown] sister of Quality Meats uptown.I had an insanely delicious meal at Quality Meats when I first moved to NYC in October-- a nice welcome to the city dinner... how was I going to say no?!So when my brother flew in to visit me in December, I made reservations through American Express concierge. Unfortunately you have to sign up for a service called Resi if you want to make reservations on the Quality website -- and the Quality Eats phone number wasn't helpful either. Happy ending - we got a reservation at 9pm on a Saturday night. We got to the restaurant just shy of 9:10pm, our table was nowhere even near being cleaned up at 932pm. The couple at the table was on a nice date and I'm not about to kick anyone out of their table -- get it girl ;-) But the host should know better than to say it was going to be 5 minutes. We literally didn't even get checked on for close to 20 mins. Thankfully two seats opened up at the bar and we got to eat there. Side note: the couple didn't end up leaving until closer to 10pm.Minus the fiasco getting seated and stuff -- the food is ON POINT!!! We ordered 1. the bacon -- just as delicious as I remember from Quality Meats. You cannot go wrong ordering this -- you can only go wrong NOT ordering it.2. Baked potato bread - I'll be honest, the name threw me off but the bartender said it's a must and well, I listened. It comes with this bacon butter but I just dipped it in the leftover peanut butter from the bacon. Way better!3. Don Ameche - I shared this with my brother. Ordered it medium rare. Comes with a side of arugula with balsamic dressing on it.FYI - 5 drinks and the food above cost about $120 without tip. It helps that the drinks are in the $13 average range.I just wish my brother was into desserts otherwise I'd have ordered that too! I just couldn't bring myself to ordering dessert and eating like a third of it only.

So I decided to come back a couple months later, but this with a reservation. I don't believe in waiting for food if I don't have to hahaThe layout is separated into the front of the restaurant and up the stairs is the back half. The front is where the bar is and you can actually hear the music playing - the noise level is louder and the crowd seems livelier. Towards the back, you get the more intimate dining experience. My friend and I were seated in the front - which we didn't mind. For drinks, we had ordered a delicious rum and grapefruit cocktail. It sounded like an interesting combination and the drink was executed perfectly. Who would have thought these two flavors would go well together. Plus they added a fresh grapefruit slice in the drink that made it aesthetically pleasing. The grapefruit taste did not overpower the alcohol and it was not filled with syrup. As a started we got the bacon with jalapeño jelly and peanut butter. I had read from other Yelp reviews that this was a flavor combination one should not miss, and boy were people right! The bacon was cooked well and the contrast of the jalapeño (apples?) along with the peanut butter was done perfectly. It was salty, sweet, tangy - all in one bite. For the main course, we both ordered the Don Ameche which is their filet mignon. Under the steak was chicken liver mousse on toast. The portion of steak was perfect (especially for the price you are paying). Mine was cooked and seasoned perfectly, although my friend's was slightly overcooked and under seasoned. But we both enjoyed the meal very much.

86,Betty C.,"Chicago, IL",92,597,844,4.0,10/3/2016,"For Manhattan this place is a value although it is still not cheap.They open at 5:30 for dinner but you can order drinks and a couple of starters at the bar if you want to have an early dinner and don't have reservations in advance.We ordered the phuket drink and it's basically a Thai version of a daiquiri but it is served in a rice bowl with pearled ice that looks like rice. It was very visually appealing.For starters we shared the peanut butter and jelly pork belly - which sounds disgusting but was great and the Caesar salad.The pork belly is basically three thick half length slices of bacon which are cooked to a perfect crispness on the outside and still slightly tender and chewy inside and are served on a peanut butter sauce that reminds one of a chunky version of Thai satay sauce. On top there is a light green jalapeño ""jelly"" that brings some nice tartness and spice to the dish. It is a little crazy for $17 for three 1/2 slices of bacon but it is delicious.The Caesar salad is basically three small romaine hearts with each leaf coated with a light but powerfully flavored garlicky dressing and then topped with finely, fluffy grated Parmesan cheese. Only a few crunchy and delicious croutons were available on the plate making us long for more.The beef long bone short rib did not disappoint. It was easily over a foot long with a thin amount of meat near one end and it got thicker at the other end. It was tender and had good flavor with a great chart from the grill.The bavette sirloin was quite over cooked from the medium requested however it was still quite tender so I did not return it or complain.Each of the entrées is served with a tiny little salad of mache, some thick sliced grilled red onion rings and a tiny creamy corn pudding ""brulee."" All three of those were excellent. Had we known those were offered on the plate we would not have ordered the side dishes - although we do not regret having ordered them, it was just about the quantity of food eaten!The french fries in a bag were of the curly variety with a little shaved cheese and truffle oil (?) and were very tasty. The orzo cacio e pepe was amazing and well worth ordering perhaps with another side as your entrée. There was tons of cheese and it was stringy and gooey. And had the Strong remodel flavor that is characteristic of that dish and very nicely done.For dessert we shared the That Shit's Bananas which was only OK. The toppings were really only available to be eaten with the top layer of ice cream so you got to the bottom and there was a slightly crystallized vanilla ice cream which didn't have enough flavor to stand on its own. It would be better served in a wider serving dish so that the toppings could be better distributed for the ice cream served.",1,1,1
87,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,3.0,8/7/2016,"As the latest addition to the family of restaurants overseen by Michael Stillman, which include the aptly named Quality Meats and Quality Italian, I was excited to make a visit to Quality Eats. This West Village eatery is a more casual, low-key find and focuses on serving some of the less common cuts of meat that diners might not find at its sister restaurants. The location can't be beat, as it's only a stone's throw away from a number of subway stops, and while the tables and seats are more tightly packed together than one might find comfortable, it certainly suits the vibe.On the evening my friends and I visited, we were quickly checked in and seated and given a quick introduction of the menu, which strays far from your typical steakhouse selections. Where else would you find peanut butter paired with bacon, or a gazpacho composed of stone fruit? After opting for some of the dishes that piqued our interests the most, we started off with the Baked Potato Monkey Bread, a warm and doughy brioche (a more recurring trend, of late), paired with a smooth butter sprinkled with sea salt. While it was a little offsetting given that most places offer their breads as a complimentary starter, it wasn't an order we regretted.From the appetizers, I have to admit that i liked the Grilled Nueske's Bacon more than I thought I would. At first, the combination of bacon, peanut butter, and a jalapeno jelly sounded more confusing than anything. What I discovered, however, was that the pairing of salty, sweet, and spicy managed to work in tandem, and the slight crunch and crispness of the bacon provided the necessary texture to support the components. Make sure to order it to share as more than a few bites can quickly become overwhelming, though.The Bavette Steak, which utilizes the lesser-utilized flank steak, wasn't quite as successful. While cooked to the requested medium rare, the protein was surprisingly chewy and tough, and didn't have the robust flavor typically found in a well-cooked piece of steak. It wasn't just one dish, either, as two of us had ordered the same dish and cook on the bavette cut. The sides we tried, including the Creamed Spinach Hush Puppies and the Scalloped Sunchokes were well-executed and tasty, but couldn't take the place of the main course.While it's possible there's other areas of the menu that are better executed than the dishes that we tried, I can't say I'd be willing to make a return visit just to find it. In the realm of NYC dining, when there are so many other options that can compete on price point and quality, why risk a second disappointment?",12,8,9

Updated review","So happy to return- This place is fantastic. Fav cuts of steak are the Don Amici and the Hanger- you really can't go wrong. Sides and openers that were must haves- BACON, crab avocado thing, hamachi crudo, sautéed greens, and the orzo. So much delicious food. If you have room, the s'mores and the sorbet is also delightful. Service was incredible. Thanks all for an amazing time.",1,,
89,Shirin D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,17,26,3.0,3/3/2018,Cute + Trendy restaurant in the West Village. I came here for brunch a few weeks ago with a friend and was underwhelmed. What we ordered:Basic Pancakes: just as the menu states these are as basic as they come. It looked and tasted like something I could have made at home. LA Eggs: these were fine nothing amazing. Had good flavor but was small. Brown Bag Fries- the only redeeming factor. These were delicious and the sauces were sooo good.,,,

Would come back here 100x for family dinners, date nights, girls nights, anything.Drinks: Very fun-looking, but the wine stack is probably your best bet because you get about 2 glasses of three different wines. (And it's really cute looking...) I was convinced they just like to embarrass everyone that doesn't order wine with their steak when they gave me the Millenial Cup cocktail in a literal trophy that was about a foot tall. Got the Beef Tartare + Grilled Neuske's Bacon to start, Don Ameche + The Hanger for entrees + Creamed Spinach Hush Puppies, Curly Fries, and Sauteed Greens for sides. Only praise for every dish.My friend and I have never been so quiet with each other at a meal in our life. We were too busy eating/enjoying our meals.",,,

I love that they're trying to make the steakhouse more accessible and appealing to a younger crowd through lower prices and creative dishes. Food was fantastic, service was friendly, and the drinks were on point (I got the Crowd Pleaser, which was perfect).We split the Grilled Nueske's Bacon (ohmygod you need to get this, unless you hate bacon or joy) and Grilled Bucheron Cheese (get this too) for starters. Our main was the special of the night, a tomahawk rib-eye for two which was served with crispy potatoes and carrots. The meat was cooked to a perfect medium-rare and was absolutely amazing - drooling just thinking about it right now. Baked potato monkey bread was good, but the bacon butter really brought it to the next level, as butter is wont to do. Even though I was stuffed after all of that, I had to try one of the dressed up scoops for dessert, and ordered the s'more, which didn't disappoint.Bottom line: come hungry, order everything.",1,,
92,Katie E.,"Manhattan, NY",253,10,5,5.0,1/10/2018,"This is hands down one of the best meals I've had in NYC.  One of my new favorite restaurants for sure.I went with a friend on a Friday night at 8pm with a reservation.  The atmosphere was very cute and service was very friendly!The food is really what makes this place stand out though.  Hands down, best appetizer dish I've ever had in my life, is the grilled Neuske's bacon.  I was pretty skeptical of the flavor combination, but I have never tasted anything like it.  You get all the different flavors without it being overwhelming.  Do yourself a favor and ORDER THIS!!!For the rest of the meal, I got the Dom Ameche and my friend got the hanger steak.  The Don Ameche was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  It came with a chicken liver mouse toast, which sounds disgusting, but tasted incredible. The hanger steak comes with a delicious creme brûlée of sorts - unreal!  We also shared the baked potato monkey bread which was to die for, and the creamed spinach hush puppies, which were average at best.The cocktails are also INCREDIBLE.  Very creative concoctions with delicious flavors.  I got the smokin' grass first, which was just perfect, and then the Cracker Jack old fashioned - this drink was fantastic.  It actually tasted like cracker jacks.The dessert was average at best.  We shared the s'mores ice cream, which was a pretty large serving and good to share.  The topping was a little hard, and it came in a plastic container with the lid on, so the presentation left much to be desired.  Wouldn't order again, but didn't deter from the overall meal!I loved this place and will definitely be back!",,,

103,Melissa G.,"New York, NY",23,206,98,3.0,3/14/2017,"Came here for restaurant week and was a bit disappointed. Service was fine but not exceptional. I'd read the rave reviews of the monkey bread and decided that it was necessary to order. It was soft but had an unexpectedly bitter flavor. In terms of ordering the right thing, my bf definitely won this time. I got the crab and avocado appetizer and my bf got the peanut butter and jalapeño jelly bacon. The crab and avocado was too spicy for my liking, and the crab didn't taste super fresh. I didn't love the consistency of the avocado -- it was more of a slimy paste rather than delicious, creamy pieces of avocado. The bacon, however, was awesome! Sweet with not too much of a spicy kick. In fact, the bacon stole the show of the entire meal -- a truly inventive and enjoyable dish.For mains, I got the top blade-flatiron and my bf got the Patty Melt. I made a mistake in ordering the steak medium-well, it probably would have been better a bit more rare. It was served with a yummy corn crème brûlée, but overall, it didn't wow me. I actually much enjoyed my bf's sandwich, which was cheesy and delectable with the caramelized onions. Meat was cooked perfectly.  For dessert, we ordered one Bar Snacks and one S'more. I'd seen the cute dessert cups all over social media and had been looking forward to trying them. Sadly, the ice cream was really hard, and once we had dug through the toppings, it lost all of the excitement. I personally preferred the S'more; I wasn't such a fan of the salty-sweet combo of Bar Snacks. Anyhow, the dessert fell flat, like much of the meal.",,1,

Drinks-1) Key Monkey was really pretty to look at and tasted delicious!2) Quality Mule was your good ole' classic ginger beer. 3) Phuket - This drink was weird. It came in a bowl and the drink was literally full of ice. Underneath all that, everything tasted like Adult lemonade. Appetizers-1) Bacon w/ Peanut Butter - MUST order! It had a spicy dressing that was absolutely delicious!2) Spinach and Artichoke Hush Puppies - Very moist and great appetizer to start with. 3) Monkey Bread - Interesting and the special butter they used definitely made it better. 4) Crab & Avocado - Yummy! Crab pieces were plump!Entrees-1) Brisket for 2, Skirt Steak, and Long Bone - All really great seasoning on the meat. I would have to say out of all of them, the Long Bone had the most flavor. What I loved most about these dishes were the corn creme brûlée it came with. I wish it wasn't so small cause I loved it!2) Octopus dish was fantastic too! Pretty soft and chewy and well seasoned. Desserts1) Bar Snack was our favorite cause who doesn't like buttered popcorn ice cream with spicy peanuts/pretzels, chocolate covered potato chips and beer caramel. 2) Stick Toffee Pudding Pan with butterscotch and vanilla ice cream for 2 was a huge portion3) Chocolate covered grasshopper was my least favorite cause I'm not a fan of mint ice cream but it was very refreshing.

Updated review","Upgrading to 5 stars! While there are gazillion restaurants in NYC and many more opening every week, few of them delivers consistently good quality food (pun intended), wine/cocktails and services, especially in hip neighborhoods. QE is one of those rare found. Came in here on a recent Sat, as a regular, I straight to the baked pumpkin and bacon apps. So good. Also tried out the lamb steak with anchovy butter and scallion. Simple on the appearance but oh so juicy and flavorful~ go with a earthy and peppery Merlot and Cabernet blends. Perfection.  Oh, did I mention price is easy on the wallet? I am surprised many original items like the avocado crab salad and the octopus have no changed prices through these years while minimum wage has gone up in addition to inflation. Well deserve the high scores on Yelp. Keep up the good work!",,,
107,Taara S.,"New York, NY",113,17,11,4.0,10/16/2017,"The octopus and steak are amazing.

108,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,12/25/2015,"I hate to throw around the word ""perfect"" when describing something. It's a cop out, technically a lie and completely subjective all in one. So while I can't say that this meal was perfect, it was five stars on all fronts. Worth the hype. Worth the wait time. Worth every penny. Despite only being open for a month or so, Quality Eats already has wait times of over an hour during the normal dinner window. I'd say that's pretty telling of, you guessed it, the quality. Thankfully, there are quite a number of good bars around this area, so putting your name down and getting a leisurely drink elsewhere (Happiest Hour and Slowly Shirley are right across the street) isn't too cumbersome at all. We put our name down around 7:45 and were texted around 8:30--we were both starting to toe the line between hungry and hangry so the summoning was timed perfectly.Hard to really nail down a vibe here. I suppose ""trendy"" might be a good word. I'm inclined to say it's on the intimate side, but the volume and table spacing (or lack thereof) kind of take away from that. So maybe I can't pick a Yelp adjective for the ambiance of this place, but what I can say is that it's surprisingly affordable given the, wait for it, quality. Steaks, as well as the rest of the mains, are all in the $20 range. We ended up ordering quite a lot of food for two people so our bill wasn't too appealing to the eyes, but we easily could've done with less food. Read on.Okay I was a bit of a tease there. Service first. Our waitress was awesome. Attentive, down to earth and incredibly helpful when it came to wine pairings. The both of us aren't typically steak-eaters, so we needed some guidance in the early goings. Not that she was really in control of this, but the food also came out at the ideal pace. We had a decent amount of time to really enjoy our appetizers, and while we were on the last few morsels, the mains arrived. Gotta love it. Now for the good stuff. We ordered:-Roasted Beet Tabbouleh w/ Kabocha Squash Hummus (A+)My picture doesn't do this justice. I mean, how pretty do you really want a dish like this too look, anyway? For ""just"" tabbouleh and hummus, the strong flavors here were really impressive. Savory and sweet. The tabbouleh was light and fruity, the hummus was decadent and creamy. My only issue was that I wanted MORE. More of the spreads, more of the delicious focaccia-esque bread. -Crab & Avocado (A)Considering the steak we were about to consume, getting lighter fare for our apps was a great way to go. I know this is supposed to be a steak place, but they do really really good seafood here. Debatably better (though I don't know much about steak). This dish, like just about everything on the menu here, had wonderfully clean and simple flavors. I think you'll start to see a theme here. The citrus (grapefruit and maybe some type of orange) was a lovely complement to the whole thing. I suppose the cilantro could be a deal-breaker for some (a good number of people harbor and intense hatred of cilantro for whatever reason), but it's not at all overpowering.-The Don Ameche - filet mignon (A)I actually really wanted to short tWe ordered this medium rare, which they recommend. Though I never eat steak, I thoroughly enjoyed this. Instead of getting your usual cut of filet mignon, this comes in four small slices--perfect to share! Tender, juicy, yummy. I was actually pushing for the short rib in place of this, but they were out of it on this particular night. This seems like a pretty solid second choice.-Grilled Octopus w/ Rice Beans, Beluga Lentils (A++)Easily my favorite dish of the evening. Saying this seems blasphemous considering Quality Eats is a steakhouse, but it's hard to do octopus this well. Just slightly crispy on the outside, tender and meaty on the inside. I was also a huge fan of the preparation: as you can see from my picture, the beans and lentils didn't just sit on the side, seemingly ostracized--they were very much a player in this dish, hugging the octopus dearly. Though it's just one tentacle, the plate is a very hearty one. Meaty, earthy, impeccably seasoned. This is up there with the best octopus I've ever had.  Though I haven't been to any of the other Quality spots, I can still confidently say that Quality Eats can stand on its own easily, and with grace. The food, though ""simple"", is executed...I almost want to say ""perfectly"". Come here with people who are willing to share. Though it's certainly not mandatory, you're going to want to try as much as you can here.",14,5,9
109,Sam V.,"New York, NY",249,120,24,5.0,7/20/2017,"GET THE STEAK. I REPEAT, GET THE STEAK. Now that I got that out of my system, I would also like to recommend the lamb. It was tender and flavorful with a kick of wow after each bite. I dont want to write a lengthy review of this place that no one will get through, so I started with my favorite dishes and will say that if you have space, get the bread  pudding. 4 people shared it and it was still enough.

We ordered #Basic and a Smokin Grass cocktails - they were really good, but both were served half a glass that disappoints a little. For our meal we had a Boucheron cheese - it was fine- tastes like ricotta cheese with caramelized sugar on top served with grilled baguette. For main we had a Don Ameche (fillet mignon) and a lamb steak - loved the fillet mignon but the lamb tasted really weird... Sauce on top tasted fishy, so it seamed like I was eating a trout with my steak - didn't like that combination at all. We ordered both steaks medium but they came out medium rare, by the way.

This special dessert everyone likes to instagram is really just chocolate ice-cream with frosting on top (and those fun looking cake croutons? they're pretty dry).

My friend is vegetarian and I'm not but we decided to stay primarily vegetarian for brunch that day.We started off by ordering Quality Eats' famous Quality Monkey Bread, which was heavenly. All the spreads, especially the salmon and bacon ones were so flavorful and just made the bread stand out more as well. My friend had the other spread and liked it as well. Personally, we found this to be better than getting bread anywhere else and there was a cheesy richness to it which was perfect to start with.For the mains, I ordered Spinach Beignets & Bearnaise while my friend ordered the LA Eggs. I really enjoyed my spinach Beignets especially because they were especially spinach-y but I felt them to be a little on the heavier side than I wanted.

For example, the ""This S*** Is Bananas"", which consists of Roasted Banana Ice Cream, Peanut Butter Caramel, Candied Bacon and Cinnamon Toast, is as awesome as it sounds.There are still plenty of sides to try, as well as some interesting appetizers like Peanut Butter & Jalapeño Jelly Bacon (!), so I'll definitely be back for another meal.",12,7,10

It's was a fun night dining while lighting kinks were worked out- we laughed as we all have Paris on our mind.Ate:Monkey bread w/ bacon butterCrudité salad w/ buttermilk dressing Branzino with artichoke vierge sauceS'mores The hot monkey bread with bacon butter was a great counterpoint to the sensational salad with oven roasted tomatoes, jicama, carrots w/ buttermilk dressing.

We got the Caesar salad, grilled octopus, long bone short rib, creamed spinach hush puppies and chick pea skillet- by far the best two dishes were the chick pea skillet and octopus. Similar to other reviews, the short rib is just not tender at all and fatty in a not savory way. Hush puppies were ok but surprisingly not that flavorful. I'll definitely try this place again but would definitely change up the order a bit and maybe just stick to their classics.",1,,

Biggest downside was that we felt like our waitress was trying to upsell us the whole meal. After ordering MORE than enough food, she insisted we get 2 of the don Ameche steaks. We absolutely did not need more than 1 for our group (we shared everything) and the steak was the last thing we would have wanted 2 of. On the other hand, 2 orders of the pb&j bacon.. please!On to the goods... everything else:+ Patty Melt Club Burger -- more like a fancy sandwich / grilled cheese. but ORDER THIS+ Grilled Nueske's Bacon (peanut butter, jalepeno jelly) - YES. The table's favorite+ Crab & Avocado -- unmemorable next to some of the other more over-the-top items+ Brown-bag Curly fries+ Don ameche steak (x2) - underwhelmed+ Baked Potato Monkey bread - enough said+ Butternut Brioche Bread pudding - my personal favorite. So flavorful Dessert:+ S'more ice cream scoop: burnt marshmallow ice cream with graham cracker shortbread and fudge swirls+ Sticky Toffee pudding pan for 2: another upsell here -- this will feed a small country. We are not a group to leave a bite of dessert left on the table, yet the 6 of us could not finish this pudding. Nevertheless, it was incredibly good.

The food was delicious and the staff were very friendly (thanks Tracy and Justine) and accommodating of our stroller.The musts:- Monkey bread. Eating this will lead to addiction - be warned!- Longbone short rib - so much flavor and the perfect size with the signature corn crime brûlée. If you are used to the larger steaks in the other Quality restaurants these are a little smaller but in my opinion just right.- Top Sirloin Coulette- Hamachi crudo- Endive and Canbazola- This sh*t is bananas which is their dressed up ice cream scoop- Warm Apple and Pear CrostataWe'll definitely be back and can't wait to try the other dishes!",2,,

Since this is the sister restaurant of Quality Meats, I knew things were more ""affordable"" which is a great way to try some good eats without breaking the bank. We came pretty late on a weeknight for dinner, around 8pm, and there was no wait as we were ushered into the back room.The cocktails were really refreshing, summery drinks and they still had their holiday drink available. We got the Crowd Pleaser and the Key Money (for that cucumber cube). Both were simple yet went well with our meal. We started off with the steak tartare and Monkey bread. Those were a great introduction to what was coming our way. Both were strong in flavor and deliciously fatty. For mains, we got the long bone short rib and the don ameche. It's kinda weird they don't tell you any details about the steaks, but the short rib comes with a little corn creme brulee side and the don ameche has chicken liver pate underneath. Both steaks were cooked to perfection and had a side of arugula salad. The portions look small, but it's actually really filling (and we had some heavier appetizers). We were so stuffed that we had to pass on the very photogenic desserts.Ambiance and service was great. It's a great spot for business people, small group of friends, or a date night.",,,

Our apps were amazing--I had the jumbo shrimp (house sauces were crazy good) and his bacon appetizer was arguably one of the best apps we've ever had. The space was a little tight, but that's to be expected in New York. Our waitress was super friendly and gave us top notch service the entire evening.

OK so down to the important stuff... the food!  We ordered 3 appetizers to start off with.  The grilled watermelon salad with crispy farro was to die! I could eat 4 bowls of that and I don't even like watermelon.  The steak tartare was a just little spicy and delicious!  Also, the sausage and peppers on toast was really yum and also had a kick.  Great flavors! Already I was happy.   Then, for the main dish, I had the Bronzino Frites.  The frites are zucchini fries that are just YUM! Cleaned my plate!  Didn't have room for dessert but they sounded really great!  Definitely make reservations.  Packed every night and full of locals too.  So you know it's good.",,,

It ended up being the perfect combination with savory/fresh, and warm/chilled. Everything had a very distinct flavor which had an awesome flavor explosion to start off the meal. For the main we had the filet cut, which was amazing. Cooked perfectly and had exactly the right flavor as well. Quality is in the name, and they know their stuff.

The four of us were there for an hour and 15 minutes, the table had JUST been cleared and the manager came over and asked us to leave since they had a reservation for the table.

We started with the much ravved about garlic monkey bread, super tasty. For starters I had the shrimp cocktail, the shrimp were delicious, huge and perfectly cooked & served with 3 dipping sauces. Husband had beef tartare which he thoroughly enjoyed. Mains were the octopus & fillet steak. We both were very happy with our choices. The steak was served on top of toasted bread with pate and salad. The octopus was much ravved about by hubby and he was extremely happy with his meal. To finish we each had a ice cream concrete, super delicious & so fun! I am not drinking at the moment so the bar staff made me a delicious citrus/ginger mocktail  and hubby ordered wine based on the servers reccomendation. Overall a wonderful meal and I would love to return, great food, good prices, host was a little flat but server was super knowledgeable and attentive.",,,
139,Lina F.,"South Slope, Brooklyn, NY",154,304,538,4.0,1/8/2016,This place is by far my new favorite place to dine.  I am always happy to indulge in some steak and  some well made cocktails!  This place marries both those sins!  We had reservations and had dinner in the back room.  We started with the cocktails - I  my key monkey drink!! The appetizers included the bacon w. Pb and Jelly and hamachi.  We also ordered a side of monkey bread! All heavenly divine! Our entrees came out and I was so happy to see my filet mignon! It was cooked nicely and the pate underneath made for a lovely complement!  My date ordered the lamb shank which was incredibly massive but not as succulent as the don ameche!!For dessert we ordered the sundae and it was all right. It wasn't really anything to write home to.,,,
140,Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",168,1053,63,5.0,9/8/2016,"Yes I'm going there... I don't routinely hand out 5-star reviews so take note- this place is really, really good. I could say that they're a 4.5 and I rounded up, but one shouldn't waver in one's 5-star reviews. Let me tell you why we loved this place.The ambiance was exactly what we wanted. I agree the tables are a bit close together and you WILL hear more than a little bit of your neighbor's conversation (especially if they're a group of late 30-something gamers on a boy's night out), but we were very comfortable in our booth and we enjoyed the view of their dimly lit dining room.The service was almost perfect. Even in the best restaurants there tends to be little annoyances with servers that you quickly forget. Not here... everything was impeccable, down to the timing of the service. Gold star to our waitress- Quality Service indeed.The food... I can't say anything really blew me away (actually that's not true, the sticky toffee pudding was one of the best I've ever had), but everything was well prepared. The highlights I would say are the sausage and toast, monkey-bread, bacon PB&J, fruit gazpacho (nicely done), and ALL of the steaks. I'm serious- the other steakhouses better take note. These guys are not gunning for second place. I shared the tomahawk rib-eye (a special) with my friend and we thought it was wonderful. I also sampled my friend's short-rib and skirt steak and they were equally as good. Little un-even in terms of temperature requested, but not too far off at all... The sides were also stand-outs (loved the cheesy orzo).The drinks... I can still feel the tingle from my spicy tequila based drink (""Adios""). All the drinks were done well...So... now do you see it? High quality from the front to the back. Speaking of which, we will certainly be back... Everyone should be back here.",2,,
141,T C.,"New York, NY",1,20,0,5.0,7/11/2018,"I've been making the rounds at the steakhouses of NYC over the past few years. I always get a medium rare filet. As far as bone-out filets go, this is the best one I've had. Perfect. I might have to break my rule of only going to each place once.",,,
142,Mark S.,"New York, NY",6,27,12,5.0,2/9/2017,"I had the best lunch here this afternoon, which was also my birthday.  Immediately, I felt welcomed by the warm staff.  At my request, I was given a nice table that overlooked the falling snow outside.  Cozy!  My server, Kate, was very kind, professional and lovely.  She made solid recommendations pertaining to the Restaurant week menu.  This food did not disappoint.  I ordered the bacon appetizer with peanut butter and apples with jalapeño preserves, which was out of this world, literally. I also had the grilled Branzino with an artichoke sauce.  Delicious, flavorful and not too heavy.  Another nice touch was when Kate delivered a complimentary beverage( a lemon based drink) from the bartender.  It paired well with the fish and made me happy.  The desert was fab.  Who can say no to burnt marshmallow and s'mores ice cream?  I even got a candle to go with it :)The entire experience was just what I needed.  Kate was a star.  She made me feel cared for and added to my birthday.  So grateful for her kindness.  The ambience is modern and beautiful.   And I will definitely return to partake in the other dishes.  A cute and fun spot worth experiencing.",,,

We had an early reservation on a Monday, but the tables around us quickly filled up. The ambiance is nice - definitely not too difficult to hear your conversation. It did feel like the industrial/fake bamboo decor in the back room didn't quite match the vibe of the menu, but that's obviously not a huge issue.Food-wise, everything was fantastic from the apps to the starters to the desserts. We shared Caesar salads, the baked potato monkey bread, and the creamed spinach hush puppies. WOW those were some good hush puppies. And the bread/bacon butter options were delicious. The Caesar could've used slightly more dressing.The steaks were melt in your mouth good, even the less expensive cuts. They came with dressed greens and some other type dip that was delicious.Our meal wouldn't have been complete without dessert - as everyone says, their dressed up scoops are too cute.

I'm currently still in the restaurant and had to take a moment to say that I just had the most amazing steak I have ever had. I'm very picky when it comes to steak (one of those ""well done"" people that chefs dread. Not only did the chef master well done.... but they also master every other aspect of this meal. We had the filot, lemon grilled chicken, grilled asparagus, grilled broccoli and the brown bagged curly fries. I am not sure what to tell you other than bing your appetite. This place is amazing.

146,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",285,201,532,3.0,9/1/2016,"I enjoyed my meal here, but I wasn't really blown away or anything.  My friend and I had seen the ice cream desserts they had, and that was probably our main reason for wanting to come.  I got a reservation a few weeks in advance for 6:30.  When we showed up the place was already pretty crowded. The place isn't huge, and it kind of felt like they were really packing people in. We were a table of two in a long row of tables along the wall, and I just kind of felt like we were right on top of our neighbors. Also it didn't help that seriously without fail, I'm always seated next to the person whose voice is so loud it's able to cut through all the other noise and all I can hear is him.  The food was good though. My friend and I got two starters to share, the stone fruit gazpacho and the grilled bucheron cheese. The cheese was really good!  It was warm and gooey, and there was like a crunchy layer of honey on top. The gazpacho neither of us were really a fan of.  It wasn't bad, but I just don't think either of us really like the combo of fruit in it. For my main dish I got the mussels michelada. It was good, but nothing amazing really. The tortilla chips are sitting in the broth so they are soggy, and mine were super salty. My friend got the grilled octopus which looked good, and she seemed to enjoy. We couldn't skip dessert since that one of the big reasons we wanted to come. We were torn between the birthday cake and the s'mores, but ultimately went with the s'mores.  It was really good, and didn't disappoint.  The marshmallow and chocolate on top were really good, and I think it was marshmallow ice cream too. Not 100% sure, but whatever it was it was really good.  Service was fine, and attentive enough.  I think the one thing I just didn't love was how close together the other tables were, and how noisy it was. I mean it was packed when we got there and when we left, so I know it's a popular place. And like I said the food was good, but I don't know, I just wasn't blown away, and don't know if I would definitely come back.",1,1,1
147,Sean W.,"Orange County, CA",10,127,127,5.0,5/27/2017,"This was an all around fantastic meal.  I sat down at the bar on a weekday right as the restaurant opened.  The bar and restaurant filled up quickly.  The bartender, Shane, was awesome and his recommendations were spot-on.  One more thing about the bar, it's just really cool.  It has a bunch of original carvings in the bar top which keep you entertained as your eyes wander while waiting for your food.  On to the other good stuff...definitely get the potato monkey bread!  That is an order.  It comes with a side of delicious bacon butter.  I was slightly embarrassed by how fast I made that bread disappear.  The entrée did not disappoint either.  Per Shane's recommendation, I went with the hanger steak.  The steak was pretty lean, but packed a lot of flavor and was perfectly medium rare.  The steak came with some greens and a small side of corn crème brulee.  The corn crème brulee was very tasty.  I just wish the portion was slightly larger.  Anyways, I topped off my gut with the ""bar snack"" ice cream dessert.  I love bar snacks, but I love this dessert even more.  Buttered popcorn ice cream with spicy peanuts, m&ms, pretzels, Pringles dipped in chocolate, and beer caramel.  Although I've never had chocolate dipped Pringles at a bar, it was more than welcome in my dessert.  What a perfect balance of saltiness and sweetness.  Great meal from beginning to end.",,,

154,Ralph B.,"West New York, NJ",60,76,20,5.0,9/15/2016,"Quality. It is in the name. A restaurant with attitude and straight to the point; how it should be. Quality eats wowed us in a very simple yet dominant way.We were strolling through the village and very hungry, we visited most restaurants in the area before but seemed to miss the best one. Quality Eats is elegant, dark, intimate yet inviting, modern yet casual; it is what you should think of when trying to picture a restaurant that is located in the village.Walked in without reservations and unlike other places in the area that ask you if you have one or not, the lady at the front desk greeted us in a happy way informing us that there are tables leaving and she will sit us right away.Once seated we were given the gift of having the best waitress that the restaurant gods up above can offer. I wish i could remember her name but unfortunately my memory is not serving me well. (During staff meeting clap it up for the girl servers)She was very informative, recommending dishes which I always like. Every time emphasizing the food she personally liked and why. Not once putting the other items down with her personal opinion like many servers do. Just that simple gesture, to me, is already great service. (Management, you are training these people well)We started with the Grilled Nueske Bacon which was recommended by the nice lady that was kind enough to tell us that peanut butter and bacon, contrary to one's belief, can be one of life's simple pleasures. It was phenomenal and i personally loved it and recommend it, try it don't be scared. Oh, we got a salad too, so we feel half as bad for ordering a second order of the bacon. :X (Clap it up for the guy/lady that is making that bacon in the back. Yeahhhh boyeee)After licking the plates, we opted for the steak special. So glad we listened to the server, again!The tomahawk steak had a bone was the size of my arm. Okay, maybe a bit smaller but regardless, super delicious that I still taste the flavors!My experience was a great one and truth be told I am picky and do not like writing long reviews. When i do it is because I really enjoyed a place. I am not a food critic but I think I tasted great food at Quality Eats. If you have not visited please go, and if you already have, go again.

157,Katherine L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,20,29,4.0,12/12/2016,"It's a great cute brunch place and they took a group of four for a walk-in, but we had to sit at the bar which was fine with us. I got the fried egg with chickpea skillet rice. It's not a vegetarian dish FYI because it's cooked in bacon roux. The dish was great with pieces of crispy, the slight hint of bacon and the runny fried egg. The home fries is a must-get side. Crispy with potato skins and caramelized onions. Only complaint I have is the expensive tea and latte. $5.25 for a cup of tea with no hot water refill. $6 for a latte. Think it's a rip off.",,,
158,Marisa L.,"Brooklyn, NY",99,612,638,5.0,4/22/2016,"I really liked this place, the only problem is how hard it is to get in without a reservation. We lucked out and got a table early on a Friday night, but it wasn't looking so good upon our first try.The ambience is pretty dark. There is a bar in the front and tables in both a front and back room. The servers were very knowledgable about every menu item and welcoming when asked questions. The steak here is really affordable and the bacon appetizer with PB& jalapeño jelly was like nothing I have ever tasted. I would definitely come back if it were easier to grab a table!",3,2,3

160,Adam W.,"Boston, MA",131,22,2,5.0,11/25/2017,"This is a great steakhouse at a great price. We were able to find parking a block or two away (and came back to no ticket thankfully!) and so we were able to arrive a half hour before our 6pm reservation. There were seats open and they were able to seat us right away, which was great. The staff was friendly and accommodating and the inside was nice and intimate. We started with the monkey bread, which we were very excited to try, but found that it was overrated and we wouldn't get it again. The hamachi tostada was an interesting dish, but the fishiness of the taste was a bit strong. For steaks, we had the Don Ameche and the Sirloin Strip. The Don Ameche was good, but the Sirloin Strip was to die for. That was hands down the winner for the night. So if you're looking for a good steakhouse in NY and don't want to break the bank, book your table here while you can.",,,
161,Karly G.,"Suwanee, GA",256,529,37,5.0,4/11/2016,"WOW, I love this place. I made reservations for 5:30pm on a Friday afternoon- they were just opening up. So we opted to sit at the bar... for 3 hours. :) Initially, I've passed this place up at least 3 times while picking out a steak house and in the end, it was one of the best decision of our trip. The place opened for about 6 months the hype is real and the food is amazing. I believe it started from Quality Meat & Quality Italian so basically it's a steakhouse in disguise. Our favorite cocktail of the night and apparently everyone else's is the Key Money. It has macerated strawberries and cucumber ice cubes - such a refreshing summer drink. Being there for 3 hours, we also ordered the Smokin' Grass and the Hemingway Spritz but Key Money tops it all.For dinner, we had the Crab & Avocado $17, Long-Bone Short Rib Steak $27, The Don Ameche $29, Butternut Brioche Bread Pudding $8...The food was amazing but I must warn you about the long bone short rib steak... it's not for the weak of heart nor jaw. It is very chewy so don't expect ribeye tender steak on this bone. I had mine cooked medium but had to send it back for medium well because it was medium rare (this could be from the thick cut bone). However, flavor was delicious and yea I may have shift my jaw a bit but thankfully it didn't lock it. :) The cream corn brulee was soo good, it was so creamy and buttery and you get that nice hard coating of sugar on top. I was in heaven. The Bartender told us a funny story about that corn brulee; a customer had order the same platter and he had smeared that brulee on top of the steak assuming it was butter! He said that it tasted funny together but it was still good. LOLThe Done Ameche with the foie gras toast was something wonderful in my mouth. The only wish would be more steak, there were only 4 pieces but still delicious. Honestly we didn't even need the brioche bread pudding because the food and the portion was perfect. Lastly... we had to try their dessert This Sh*t Is Bananas. It contains Roasted Banana Ice Cream, Peanut Butter Caramel, Candied Bacon, Cinnamon Toast and it is addicting. I couldn't stop eating it. It was worth every freaking calories in each spoon I scooped up. This place is obviously my favorite because my review has gotten quite lengthy. But I love the vibe here. It's young, it's fun, it's not pretentious and not once did our bartender made us felt like we needed to leave. I can not wait to be back here and I can only hope they are thriving each day!",3,,3

The Don Ameche was one of the best dishes I've had in a while. Filet mignon cooked perfectly and sliced over greens and chicken liver on toast. Chicken liver on toast!!! Such an amazing, unexpected complement, even despite the fact that I am not a huge chicken liver fan. Meaty, salty, charred, unctuous, tangy- this dish hit all my favorite flavors. Chickpea rice was a cornucopia, yes, cornucopia, of textures and flavors. Love. Cacio e Pepe orzo was good, not great. It came off a bit bland when eaten with the steak, chicken liver, chickpea rice, but was worth it nonetheless. Also worth a mention is that the staff and service here is just as top notch as the food. Courteous, attentive and honest. All in all, a really great spot. I'll be back....",,,1

Everything in this place from starters to dessert is absolutely delicious. When you walk in the restaurant is separated in two parts. The bar and side tables that have the music bumping and then the back area which is a couple of tables with less noise. Depending on your mood each section is fun. The back area allows you to talk. Food wise, you can't go wrong with any choice. Everything our table ordered and all the other items I saw floating around looked delicious. Here's what I recommend: Apps: spinach cream hush puppies. Comes with three huge pieces, butternut squash bread pudding.. Wow! And of course the monkey bread! The bread has three types of cheeses and served  with bacon butter. Sounds overly indulgent, but it's absolutely worth it. Entree wise we got the brisket for two and the patty melt burger. The briskest was huge probably could've fed three people. The meat was flavored and cooked perfectly. It fell right off the fork! Pattly melt was huge. Definitely a dish to share. I opted for spice slaw on the side and thank goodness because it's a lot of slaw. Dessert wise we stuck with the dressed up scoops! To be honest, ehh. They cole presented really cute, but the actual flavors were basic. The birthday cake scoop was only good for the actual birthday cake pieces. The actual chocolate icecream was okay. The smores scoop another disappointment. Looked pretty, but tasted just okay.I have to say this is a great restaurant in the west village area.

She was very friendly, SUPER knowledgeable, helpful and made an AMAZING gimlet. A person dinning with us had a couple questions about the cuts of meats and was looking for suggestions, she was sooo great at explaining the different cuts. The decor and atmosphere is awesome. Chic but not pretentious. We ordered the crab and avocado salad, the monkey potato bread, the patty melt, a side of a veggie, another veggie that she brought over for us (so sweet!) and our friend got one of the larger cuts of steak. Everyone loved everything!

I hadn't been to any of the Quality restaurants but Eats was a great first impression. I came for dinner with 3 dudes and we treated ourselves to the special that night, a tomahawk ribeye that was served on a sizzling skillet along with crispy potatoes and arugula. The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare and needed no other accompaniments, but the potatoes were awesome. We also shared the crab and avo starter, grilled octopus, sweet potato monkey bread, and leg of lamb steak. Everything was great! The lamb steak had a sweet marinade on it that I thought tasted like Korean galbi and felt out of place to me on lamb, but it was still super tasty despite my personal aversion to sweet marinades. The crab and avo starter was light and fresh way to open the meal, and provided a good foil for all the meat. Grilled octopus was flavorful and tender, and the monkey bread - while nothing special - was delicious and very soft.

173,Justin H.,"Manhattan, NY",143,113,1634,5.0,3/3/2016,"Go here for brunch! I had an extremely satisfying meal here a couple weekends ago. We started with the potato monkey bread which came with three different types of butter spreads - bloody mary, bacon, and smoked salmon. They were all delicious but my favorite had to be the bloody mary. The monkey bread was pillowy soft and full of buttery goodness. My friend and I shared the poached eggs with spinach beignets and the LA eggs as our entrees. The spinach beignets were excellent - similar to falafel but creamy inside. They were even better mixed with the yolk from the eggs. The LA eggs entrée was pretty standard, but the real standout of the dish was their homemade guac. Some of the best I've had in recent memory. Even though we clearly had enough food, we devoured a side of their excellent potato skin home fries after. If you want to snag a seat, arrive before noon on a Sunday before the place fills up with boozy brunchers.",3,,
174,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,3/15/2016,"KenScale: 8.0/10Steakhouse is one of the main staples of New York dining scene, but it's hard to find places that actually serve the meat that is worth $50 and above. Wolfgang's has always been the go-to option for me if I have a serious craving for steaks (which actually hasn't happened too much lately given how varied my diet has become over time while living in NYC and now I appreciate it more when there are seafood and vegetable dishes that I haven't seen or tasted before). I've never been to Quality Meats before, though, and I was certainly intrigued when the same team opened a more affordable version in Greenwich Village. Can a ""budget"" steakhouse actually work, with the way meat is getting more and more expensive? If someone wants to open one, I think Quality Eats will be an excellent blueprint. Quality Eats is not an ordinary steakhouse only because its steaks are cheaper. There are some really interesting twists going at the kitchen. After the predictable endive and cambazola salad, I had to try the bacon, which came (gasp!) with peanut butter and jalapeno jelly. I mean who combines bacon with this ingredient (I didn't even know peanut butter and jalapeno can co-exist together). But lo and behold it worked out magnificently, with awesome texture and the jelly somehow enhancing it despite its potential to totally kill the meat. I was in love with this dish and wanted even more. Now onto the main course. One of my dining companions wasn't really feeling steak, and ordered branzino with artichoke sauce vierge. It was pretty well-cooked although I think it could've used less salt. What about the steaks? I don't think the lower price compromised their quality. Yes, you don't get a steak for $19 in most places, but the bavette cut was just priced as such. It was a solid steak for its price certainly. The better (and pricier) one is the filet mignon called the Don Ameche (still fairly priced at $29), which had excellent texture without overpowering seasoning. I would absolutely get this over most other steak dishes priced at $50 or above. Don't skip the side dishes at Quality Eats. Both the scalloped sunchokes and cacao e pepe orzo were excellent sides that I couldn't stop digging even though I was beyond full while devouring the steaks. For desserts, I loved the birthday cake with chocolate malt ice cream and vanilla icing, as well as bar snacks consisting of pumpkin stout ice cream, sriracha peanuts, BBQ potato chips and beer caramel and pretzels. Neither looked particularly fancy, but the combination of ingredients and the delightful sweetness of flavor were enough to give me a smile at the end of the meal.Getting a reservation at Quality Eats could be really hard (who wouldn't want to eat good steaks for half the price of most other steakhouses?). While the restaurant does seem to set aside tables for walk-ins, my suggestion is to book as early in advance as possible. I really liked the dining room at the back of the bustling bar, too, a cozy, modern space that is perfect for a date. The restaurant has a full bar with some interesting cocktail and wine selections (lots of ""blend"" wines on the list, and I did enjoy the Rhone blend on the glass). In a way, Quality Eats could really be a trailblazing institution in NYC; it's the first restaurant that I know that proves you can have a cheaper steakhouse that is actually really good at having a pleasant dining experience.",2,,

Our table wasn't ready when we arrived, so we waited for about 20 min, however the hostess gave us complimentary champagne which brighten our spirits right up! There were 3 of us, and we were hungry, so we tried A LOT. Highlights include: Branzino, monkey bread, curly fries, sunchoke, nueskes bacon, house Caesar, hamachi, and the flatiron steak.

176,Stephanie W.,"New York, NY",210,41,72,5.0,8/19/2016,"I came here on a Thursday to have drinks with my two cousins after work. Luckily, we got three seats at the bar and right in front of the cocktail making station. The bar counter was etched with these fun and witty cartoons and sayings. It would definitely stood out in my mind when comparing it to other restaurant bars. I started off with the Key Money cocktail which had strawberry gin, mint, lime, and green cucumber cubes. The cocktail itself looked really pretty, especially with the green cucumber ice cubes against the strawberry pink liquor. It was refreshing and delicious and I wish they filled my glass up a little more. Then we ordered the grilled bacon with peanut butter and jalapeño jelly. Holy moly, I've never would have thought bacon and peanut butter would taste so good! Of course - sweetness from the crunchy (not creamy) peanut butter and the saltiness and smokiness of the thick cut bacon was an explosion of flavor and balance. I could do without the jalapeño jelly which were like small diced cucumbers in a green jalapeño jelly but it was way too spicy for me.I got one more final cocktail, the crowd pleaser which had vodka, fresh basil, raspberries, and St. Germain. The drink was also topped with two fresh raspberries on a cute wooden pick. That was just as delicious but a tad bit stronger in alcohol flavor. I'm 100% coming back for probably the exact same dish and drinks. The bartender, Shane, was also super nice and friendly. Probably one of the nicest and least stuck up bartender in the West Village, and made our experience a lot more pleasant.",,,
177,Hassan P.,"New York, NY",441,134,149,4.0,3/20/2016,"Diagnosis : great restaurant with negativesQuality eats is definitely worth going to. It has good food for a fair price. I usually never order steak outside my own home because I think my steak is the best but we ordered the don Ameche and it was legit. Make sure you order it medium rare aka the proper way. We also had the scallops and the octopus. I've had better octopus but scallops were amazing. If you are Indian don't order the broccoli. It's just like a pakora. Nothing special. Drinks where nothing special. I thought they were watered down. Desserts look amazing when people order them but they are just all ice cream with weak toppings. The vibe in the restaurant is crowded and everyone is waiting for a table. They accept walk ins but make a reservation and come early to try and get an earlier table. That's what we did and it worked. They have this weird rule that you need to be on the waiting list to get a seat at the bar as well which I didn't like because even though we got seats at the bar when someone left, we had to get up and let people who were on the list sit.  Staff was really nice and helpful.

179,Danielle K.,"New York, NY",206,232,43,5.0,1/8/2016,"When I told people I was going to Quality Eats for dinner, they said, ""I love love love Quality MEATS. So good."" If you plan on going here, there's a 75% chance you will also get that response. I'll bet you a piece of bacon. Since this is a fairly new restaurant and more people [obviously] know more about the legendary Quality Meats, it makes sense. A lot of reviews say this is the ""sister"" to Quality Meats but after my dinner there, I'd like to count it as an equal. Quality Meats, be afraid! Your so-called sister might be more successful than you in a couple of years! Ooooohhhhh. First, the drinks are delectable, refreshing, and stunning. I ordered the Key Money. If you love refreshing cocktails, get this. It has CUCUMBER CUBES. We ordered the potato monkey bread for starters (yes, they can do this even if its listed under sides). It was good but would I order this again? Probably not. It's the equivalent to the kind of bread you'd get for free at an Italian restaurant. I will say though that I loved the bacon butter, but maybe that's only because I think of myself as a kind of female Ron Swanson. If there is one entree that you should order, or if there's one thing that you should take away from this review (which is now getting rather long), it's that you need to order the Don Ameche. It comes on top of toasted bread with a tasty pate spread. The first thought to pop into my head after the first bite was, ""I can die happy now."" Also, if you're belly happens to be craving a dessert, I'd go with This Sh*t Is Bananas. It has candied bacon. *Drops mic*",3,6,5
180,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,12/10/2015,"After a stellar experience at Quality Meats and a less-than-stellar experience at Quality Italian, I was curious to see what Quality Eats had to offer. I was glad to find out that when it opened about a month ago that it was located just a quick walk away from my apartment, so I wouldn't have to trek all the way to Midtown. Finally, score one for the downtowners...haha I kid, I kid.I took a look at the menu beforehand, and was surprised to see that it was a little more reasonably priced for casual eating than its steakhouse counterparts. Getting a reservation was relatively easy, although you should note they use Resy and not OpenTable. One thing we noticed was that the host was not very friendly and didn't make any eye contact when we checked into our reservation. Quite odd, but not enough to ruin our experience or anything. The inside has much more of a casual vibe than its counterparts, with a fairly active bar scene. They seem to really want to break out of the Quality Meats mold, as you'll see the Quality Meats logo plastered everywhere, except with the ""M"" scratched out. The menu has a lot of familiar dishes too, but you'll notice that all the beef dishes are less than $30. NOTE: There is no giant Chicken Parm, which is a shame.We started with the steak tartare and the baked potato monkey bread. The steak tartare was pretty standard, but tender and delicious, accompanied by some crostini, and sliced radish. The baked potato monkey bread was great, with a pretty fluffy inside, and crispy, cheesy outside. We opted not to go for any of the cocktails, although looking at orders from the other tables, they seemed pretty enjoyable and well-crafted. After that, we went with the short rib steak, the Don Ameche (filet mignon), and the creamed spinach hush puppies.  The short rib steak, complete with its long bone (heh), is only grilled to medium or well-done, so we picked medium, while we got the Don Ameche cooked to the usual medium rare. The short rib steak had the more flavorful meat by far, but I did like how the filet mignon was dressed and presented, and how tender it was. The rib steak came with a sort of corn creme brulee, which was pretty delicious, but confusing as we didn't see how it fit in with the rib steak. The Don Ameche came with some arugula and more crostini, in somewhat of a chipotle and caramelized onion dressing. Note though, that while the Don Ameche was delicious, it only comes with 4 medium-sized center slices, and not a full filet. The creamed spinach hush puppies were very interesting and fried to a perfect crunchiness, although we found the accompanying aioli to be slightly overkill. We sort of eavesdropped on another table, who had ordered the scalloped sunchokes, and they looked great too. We ended the meal with the S'more, which was marshmallow ice cream, a graham cracker topping, with more marshmallow and chocolate on top. Pretty well-executed, not too sweet, and easily shared between the two of us.Service was very attentive, but a little pushy at the end of the meal. We got our check almost right after dessert without asking for it, and the waitstaff seemed very anxious to clear our tables. I understand the need to seat as many people as possible, but it was off-putting after being asked twice if we were done with our meal, which we were not. Pricing, as mentioned before, is on the cheaper side, but don't expect any fine, dry-aged cuts of beef, like a porterhouse or ribeye. Most of the steaks are on the smaller side, and are the less expensive cuts, like hangar or skirt steak. In all, I'd fit my experience right in the middle of the two other restaurants. There's something to be said about the vibe at a nice steakhouse, and while Quality Eats does not have that, the casual, comfortable vibe it does have is decent. I was more inclined to give this 3.5 stars after the pushy service, but the food is well-executed, and the experience was still enjoyable. I'll be back to try some cocktails, the peanut butter and jalapeno jelly bacon, those scalloped sunchokes, and perhaps *gasp* some other non-beef items. Am I crazy for even thinking about skipping out on the beef? Yeah, probably.",34,16,29
181,Michelle W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",91,167,79,4.0,3/12/2016,"I heard the line gets insane so I came by around 5:45 right after they opened and was able to get seated immediately. Apparently a little over half the tables are for walk-ins, so the best bet is to probably try and snag a reservation otherwise. The wait was 1:30 hours by the time I left around 7:30.Quality eats is supposed to be the cooler, hipper sister to their 2 restaurants in midtown. And it definitely feels much less corporate. The menu also felt a lot fresher and more seasonal, granted I haven't been to quality meats or Italian in a while.The food was a mixture of hits and just ok in my opinion. I loved the steak tartar and beet tabbouleh here - so flavorful and slightly different from the run-of-the-mill. On the other hand I'd skip the hush puppies, unless you're an avid fan and always get them. They were kind of soggy and really oily.Oh and the birthday cake dessert is the cutest thing ever.

The whole experience was such a disappointment. I decided to come here for a casual birthday dinner, and much so disappointed. My party of two arrived at 6:30pm with a reservation, and we were quickly seated. We were sat at a two person table sandwiched between two others tables. It was such uncomfortable seating as I felt like I was sharing a table next to the two tables on both sides of me. I was literally sitting inches away from the other two parties and heard every word of their conversations. It was hard having a conversation. We were ordered the following:- Hamachi crudo ($17): Hamachi is one of my favorites, so I had to order this dish. The hamachi was nicely accompanied with nuts, cranberries, parsley and some other greens. It was very well seasoned, and the taste was great. But the biggest disappointment was the minimal portion of the dish. Also, the fish was cut like pieces of scrap meat in disproportional chunks. - Long bone short rib steak ($25): DO NOT ORDER THIS DISH!!!! The name is deceiving because this was anything but a STEAK! There was just a tiny strip of meat on a huge bone. My steak was overcharred and there was hardly any meat! The best thing about this dish was the corn pudding which came with the dish.- Burger patty melt ($17): This was similar to a Texas patty melt you get from the southern fast food chain Whataburger. There was nothing too memorable about the burger. - Curly fries ($7): It was your standard curly fries.- Birthday cake dessert ($9): My favorite part of the meal was dessert. The birthday cake comes in a small cup with chocolate malt ice cream in on the bottom and cake and birthday cake frosting on top. The whole thing was so good! The service here needs work. I do understand that this place hasn't opened too long, but service needs to be better than this. It took me more than five minutes each time to get the staff's attention. I also made a note for the staff to make it special because this was a birthday celebration, but nothing was done. If I will be back, it will only be for the dessert.",3,1,1
184,Jayne L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,8,1.0,8/8/2017,"As soon as I walked in the noise level told me I would not be able to hear my niece speak during dinner. Okay, she chose the restaurant it was her birthday celebration but really, after one hour the waitress was hovering. We bought a bottle of wine during dinner. Doesn't that tell someone that we are here to enjoy our dinner? I would NEVER go back again. There are so many fabulous restaurants where I can hear my dinner companion talk and I am not rushed. AND, the chef would not make any changes. Really? Get over yourself.  Look elsewhere.",,1,
185,Kim K.,"Nashville, TN",0,6,0,3.0,5/9/2018,"The food and wine was excellent, however, I am giving 3 stars because the server charged me and each of my 3 friends I dined with twice on our credit cards. We are now having to dispute the charge with our banks...a hassle we don't have time to be dealing with. Other than than, the food was great.",,,
186,Madelyn S.,"Hoboken, NJ",1,6,0,1.0,10/14/2017,Be careful!!! Especially with the specials. We were charged for a rib eye for two after we were told we could order a rib eye for one. The manager did nothing about it. So ridiculous!,,,
187,Dennis J.,"New York, NY",13,773,33,4.0,1/10/2016,"I stopped by with a friend on a weekday evening, with a reservation, and while it wasn't very busy around 6 PM, it became much busier throughout the evening. We split the grilled bacon and the grilled cheese to start, and both were quite unique and tasty dishes, particularly the former with the peanut butter and the jalapeno jelly. For my entree, I had the seared scallops, which were fairly well done, while we also had the creamed spinach hush puppies and baked potato monkey bread, all of which were unique and also tasty, particularly the hush puppies.In general, the dishes were uniquely created, and the service quite good and ambiance nice. It's a good, fairly low key spot with interesting dishes.",1,1,2
188,Cyrus P.,"New York, NY",841,876,530,4.0,1/13/2016,"Stopped in with no resy's and got a great table in the back... after about a 45 minute wait. There will probably be a wait.. WORTH IT. Great service. The waitress was fun and cool.Decor was sexy. This looks and feels like Carbone's younger, cooler and more hip little brother. The food is similar in quality and flavors, but a much cheaper price point, and the wine selections are good. The buvetta and Don Ameche were standouts, as well as the bacon. $35 for a bottle of Malbec (The Seeker) wasn't too shabby either, and a much smoother malbec than most out there. 4.5 stars for great price points, sexy vibes and fantastic service. Highly recommended.",2,,
189,Eric L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,8,0,4.0,3/8/2017,This West Village restaurant is a casual under $30 steak spot. It is a cozy venue with a bar on one side and a row of seating on the other. It had a darker vibe to it and played chill music with the occasional classics. Our waitress was friendly but I felt she could have come around more often. I had the 'Don Ameche' which was an delicious sliced fillet served with arugula in balsamic vinaigrette. The caramelized onion sauce on the steak turned the meal from good to great. I haven't been into steak as much but it doesn't feel like a steak place when you walk in. I'd recommend giving it a try if you're interested in trying a good under $30 steak.,,,
190,Lili K.,"Manhattan, NY",286,2517,159,4.0,11/20/2015,"First of all, everyone here was super friendly and accommodating (what with having our stroller being parked by our table and everything!).  We got to talk to one of the owners as well as various other staff members, which is always nice!Anyways-I really liked the cocktails here, especially the key money.  That drink was DELICIOUS.  We also had the punchline, adios and home alone cocktails-specialty cocktails are the best, I tell you!As for dinner, we had the long-bone short rib steak with corn (which looked like corn brulee).  It was pretty good and we took the bone home for our pup, hehe.  We also had the creamed-spinach hush puppies, baked potato monkey bread and grilled bucheron cheese for our appetizers/sides.  Everything has a unique flair to it, so that's always exciting to try.As for dessert, we had the sticky toffee pudding.  I liked how it came with a lil' flag sign that said ""yum"" on it, hehe.  They also pour the pudding on top (and leave some for you to add more later) and have a separate container for the ice cream, which I appreciated!Good times, come check this place out!  And make a reservation through the website because it does get packed here.",4,,2
191,sarah K.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,92,1,4.0,2/23/2017,"The food was amazing. Almost everything we ate and drank was superb. We started with the Moscow Mule and a drink with gin and mint and strawberries and cucumber ice. Delicious! To eat, we got the bacon (everything you've read is true), the monkey bread (perfect), the sunchoke gratin (melt in your mouth), and the bok choy (meh). For entrees we had the rib steak and the hangar steak. Both were cooked perfectly and delicious!We followed the cocktails with a bottle of malbec as recommended by the server. It wasn't great. Not her fault, but I expected better.For dessert we had ""bar snacks"" with chocolate ice cream.The dessert was heavenly. They added a candle for my bf's bday - a nice touch.I docked a point, not for the bok choy (though it should be better), but for the service. For the amount the diners were spending, I expected to be more than an afterthought to the server. Maybe she was overloaded, maybe someone called out sick, but if I'm spending $200 somewhere, I want to feel special.",,,
192,Abigail K.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",20,119,198,4.0,7/31/2016,"Had a good experience. The food was good, not the best I've ever had, but above average. I definitely prefer Quality Meats, but it was a fun offshoot of the original and I generally liked it. The decor is very cute - nice details, and friendly staff experience. The creme-brulee corn was probably my favorite thing - it was literally fantastic, I could have eaten a huge bowl of just that. The meat was good, but definitely not the quality of QM, but you get what you pay for.",,,
193,Hamilton Y.,"Manhattan, NY",4,51,2,5.0,12/19/2016,"Quality Eats was one of the best meals I've had in the last year and was at a fairly reasonable price point as well. I went with a few friends and split a number of dishes. For the appetizers we had the bacon, the crab & avocado and the beef tartare. The bacon was by far the stellar hit of the group. Rich, fatty and salty with a rich peanut sauce and jalapeno jelly it was a perfect combination of flavors, Even those that thought they wouldn't enjoy it said it was a great dish.For mains we had the tomahawk ribeye with beef fat fried potatoes, the surf & turf lasagna and the don ameche (which is just a filet mignon). For sides we had the curly fries, the cream of spinach hush puppies, and the baked potato monkey bread. There was not a single thing I did not enjoy from the set. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, the accompanying dipping sauces for all the sides elevated them to another level, the oxtail and crayfish crepe design of the lasagna gave it all the saucy richness I dream of in a lasagna. There were no disappointments, no complaints just a lot of food that was enjoyed all around.I definitely recommend quality eats to anyone that's looking for a great restaurant that's on the more affordable side versus the big steak houses in the city.",1,,
194,Christine T.,"New York, NY",496,36,49,5.0,12/20/2015,"I honestly think this was one of the best meals I've had in NYC, and I'm STILL smiling from ear to ear just thinking about it. I came here as a recommendation from a co worker who's an even bigger foodie than I am so I had high expectations. Here's what happened:1) Roasted beet tabbouleh with kabocha squash hummus- this was EXPLODING with all the right flavors that I don't even know how to describe it. Absolutely amazing, it was the perfect combination of light between the beet tabbouleh and squash hummus but the grilled bread that it comes with adds more substance... because carbs are the answer to everything IMO. 2) Creamed spinach hush puppies- I actually think I would have passed on this side dish in retrospect. Creamed spinach is so heavy on by itself already that deep frying it pushes it over the top. That's saying a lot coming from a girl who eats any and all things fried. Although I have this un-fried preference in this one case, the creamed spinach was still good and I ate my entire half of the split portion.3) The Don Ameche- I always get my steaks cooked medium rare and I must say, this was cooked to PERFECTION!! I'm a die hard believer that if you're going to get a nice cut of steak medium well or well done, you might as well not even order it because you are literally ruining your life by eating rubber. This filet was seasoned and cooked just how I dream of my steaks being prepared. It came with garlic toast that was topped with chicken liver mousse and caramelized onions. This was actually really delicious as far as flavors go, but I couldn't eat all of the toast because it was rather soggy by the time it came out. This also came with a side of arugula with balsamic drizzle.4) I was told that I will not have a real eating experience at Quality Eats if I don't get dessert. I got the Gingerbread Man ""dressed up scoop"" that came with apple butter ice cream, cinnamon molassas cake, and gingerbread village people on top. For someone who never eats sweets, I could eat this cup of gold every day for the rest of my life. It was just the right amount of sweet to be considered dessert, but I wasn't cringing of a sugar rush afterwards. I've also heard the s'mores ice cream dessert is bomb AF. The restaurant is really small and I didn't have a reservation so I had to sit at the bar for a 6 PM dinner on a Saturday night because it was already packed with people/filled with reservations. The bartender was the one taking our order and he gave great recommendations to my party and to the guys next to me when I was eavesdropping (had to get an idea of what else I should try for round 2). Overall, service was great, food was phenomenal, and you really can't beat the price. The total bill was split between all things mentioned above + 1 more order of the Don Ameche, and it turned out to be $50 per person. For an appetizer, filet mignon entree, side, AND dessert... that's a steal for an incredible meal. See you again soon, Quality Eats!",1,,1
195,Narae K.,"LITTLE NECK, NY",0,2,0,3.0,3/22/2018,"The food was great but the service was horrible. It was my boyfriend's birthday and at first we had to flag down a waiter to take our order after waiting for about 15 minutes. Then when the waiter FINALLY got to our table he kept rushing us. We felt so pressured into picking something and couldn't even ask for suggestions. I also asked in my reservation if they could surprise my bf with one of the desserts, also overlooked. Worked out because we didn't want to stay anyways. Ambience is nice and all but don't think I'll be coming back.",,,
196,Diane Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",239,1123,116,3.0,1/17/2017,"Really liked the idea of the wine stack since it gives you variety for a good price. The food was just ok. We shared the caesar salad, bavette, ribeye, bacon, curly fries, and monkey bread. The bread was pretty dry. The meats weren't the best quality and the flavors didn't make up for it. Service was good though.",,,
197,Kevin C.,"Huntington Beach, CA",0,6,0,3.0,10/19/2017,Finally got a res Sunday night and we pushed our time to 9:00. We ordered drinks and wanted to start with apps. We were told that the Chef wants the complete order for the night. Well we were not sure how much we wanted to eat. We just ordered apps and then received the check. We felt like leaving and then coming back in to order dinner.  So we just left. With all the compition out there you think they would have accommodated us. Never forget that the customer comes first. The apps and waitress were very nice.,,,
198,Julia R.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,40,7,5.0,6/12/2017,"Ate here for anniversary dinner, early on a Friday evening. Had pea shoot salad and long bone short rib--both outstanding. Excellent service. Very reasonably priced for what it is. One sour note: had called ahead for reservation, was told no seats available--got there, plenty of seats. I am NOT down with this kind of snootiness.",,,3
199,Barbara M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,4/5/2018,"This restaurant was a total disappointment. We had a reservation for 8:30 pm, received a text from the restaurant 30 minutes before reminding us to be there on time (!), and when we got there, our table was not ready and wasn't ready for quite some time. We finally got a terrible table right at the door where we were crammed in and couldn't hear each other speak. It is far too loud, the hostess was entirely discourteous to us, have nothing good to say about it. Food was only so-so. We will never return to this restaurant.",,,
