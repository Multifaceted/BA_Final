I'm Italian American and the pasta and bread simply reminded me of home.  The service was impeccable.  Chaba is a true gem and the restaurant is lucky to have him!As a business traveler coming from outside New York sometimes I dread dining in the city, worrying if the place will be too stuffy or pretentious. This place was down to earth and perfect for what I was wanting. I will definitely be back.",,,

The waitress was not pleased to have such a large party, she was banging things, no smile or warmth.3 of us asked for the Kale salad with dressing on the side and the shrimp cooked well.The salad came out with the dressing and my shrimp was not cooked as I had requested. I did not want to send it back I was afraid she would spit in my food.I removed the shrimp, the salad was delicious.Will never go back or recommend the restaurant.",,,

5,Nami A.,"Chevy Chase, MD",0,1,7,1.0,4/22/2018,"This place deserves 0 stars. Stayed at Hyatt Centric for a weekend trip. The staff was lovely.. The problem was the bar/restaurant next to it. Our group decided to have a couple drinks before going out to dinner and walked to the bar area. We had a party of 5 but there were only 2 seats left at the bar. (didnt seem like a problem because there were several other high top tables next to the bar as well as more than half the regular dinner tables unoccupied since it was before dinner time)I asked the bartender to be seated at one of the high tops but he said I would have to ask the hostess.The hostess, LIZ was hostile from the moment we told her the bartender had sent us to her. She dismissed us saying that all tables were for food orders only and then proceeded to go to the bartender and lecture him in front of all of us. It was embarrassing to say the least. At that point I told her she was being very rude and our group left the bar (while she rolled her eyes and laughed). We let one of the receptionists at the Hyatt lobby know and they called a manager to talk to her and HE came and apologized to us but by that time we just wanted to get as far away as possible. I can't say anything about their food or drinks but if you have a hostile hostess, that pretty much ruins everything. I would have understood if the place had been even remotely busy or if it was fine dining but this was simply not the case. Hopefully this place will find hostesses that actually like their job in the future.",,,

As a born and raised NYer shame on me for thinking I'd have a quality steak dinner at a high end hotel restaurant.Ordered the NY Strip medium rare, was a nice presentation but that's where it ended.  Tough, Chewy and not exactly med/rare, more medium plus.My fault for not sending it back. But I was pressed for time.  Waste of $40.Also very surprised by the limited draft beer selection on tab. Will not go back.",,,

9,Marc S.,"Pasadena, CA",2,54,0,1.0,6/20/2018,"All I can say is why would anyone ever return to this place to eat?While staying at the Hyatt Centric recently, I stopped in for some apps and a drink before the theater. While the decor was cool and the service barely acceptable yet aloof, the food was an embarrassment, not only in quality but price. I've been to NY many times and am accustom to the prices at upscale restaurants...I don't have a problem paying for good food. We ordered some Korean short rib sliders and were asked how many we'd like. How many in an order I asked, and was told 1. We got 2. The sliders were served on hard, cold buns, and the meat was barely warm. Not only were they your typical small sliders, but the amount of meat was minuscule considering we were charged $15 each! If you check their menu online, it lists the price at $8 each. I should have questioned this at the time but after waiting almost 10"" to get the check, I had no time to spare.The Truffle fries weren't much better. Overcooked, over salted, and barely warm. The total check for two sliders, fries, and two beers came out to over $62!Don't waste your time.",,,

I ate here several times during my stay at the Hyatt.Meals included a mixed greens salad with grilled salmon for lunch, a vegetable soup for lunch, French Onion Soup for dinner, and breakfast one morning: an omelette with salmon, spinach, mushrooms, onions, and dill.Food overall was pretty good. The French Onion Soup was a little to thick - it needed more broth. I thought I was eating French Onion sludge due to the thickness of the contents of the soup. Decent flavor though.The Omelette was a little disappointing in that I could not detect the baby spinach in the omelette. I said something to my server about this when she came by to ask how things were. I told her - she asked me if I wanted to dish re-made. I declined - I had eaten more than half of it.Coffee to go was solid. Also picked up several bottles of water to go as well.Staff is very friendly. I sat at the bar one day and worked for several hours on my MacBook Pro. They even plugged me into an AC outlet when I asked. There is a large flat panel HD TV mounted in the front corner - near the bar.",,,

So I said to myself:"" let's be adventurous!"". and I docked my citibike in times square and I walked in in this cute little diner inside the Hyatt hotel.  I didn't know what to expect from a nyc times square restaurant. Usually it's just a tourist trap.The manager kyle came and greeted me and suggested me the free range chicken. Wow. The best chicken dish I have ever had. Crispy outside and juicy inside. Cooked to perfection. Then kyle suggested the chocolate mousse. Just one word to describe it: chocogasmic! At first it punches you with an explosion of Coco cream, then it cuddles you delicately until it melts in your mouth like snow in summer. T45 a real oasis of great food in the chaos of Times square. Also, Kyle was one of the best and most friendly managers I have ever met. Definitely coming back here.",1,,
16,Lisa K.,"Wiesbaden, Germany",82,228,282,3.0,11/27/2016,"We spent the last day of our Thanksgiving trip back to the states at this Hyatt in Times Square. They upgraded us to a higher floor and it came with a 37 dollar per person spending limit for breakfast here. The menu didn't look incredibly impressive, but I opted for the the Hash and Eggs dish due to the fact that you can't get good pastrami in Europe. I am predominantly vegetarian, but I become more flexible with my eating on vacation and this dish was amazingly worth it. 18 bucks for one dish is a bit steep, so I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but as a hotel guest-- it was really good. Customer service was decent. The man who took our order was named Rey. He was very friendly and attentive. My husband ordered the California omelet with additional sides of bacon and sausage. He said the omelet was very garlic-y, but he said it was good. After tax and tip, our bill was about 70 bucks. 5 dollars for 2 slices of bacon and another 5 bucks for 2 pieces of sausage. I thought that was a bit ridiculous, but I'm not that surprised since its Times Square.",,,

20,Tara J.,"Delray Beach, FL",256,585,340,2.0,12/31/2015,"Terrible experience at this Hyatt restaurant, and now I'm second-guessing why we even ventured in. I make an effort to patronize local businesses back at home and while traveling, but in this instance, it was Christmas day and most places were closed. By default, we stopped in here just because they were open. Mistake!What started out as decent service with an attentive server ended with no service at all. I'll start with the END of the story first, and will try to make this short --Our server had some sort of medical emergency and left to go home. No one told us. We sat and waited and waited and waited and waited for her to come back to ask us about our food, if we'd like another beverage...anything!  We sat for 20 minutes looking around for her. My husband found a server who apologized and said he'd be right over with our bill, but not offering us another beverage, more food, dessert, or anything. Another 10 minutes went by (I'm not exaggerating) and he never came to our table either!  I then went to the cash register to speak with the manager who explained that our server had to leave, but he apologized that no one serviced our table for a FULL 30 minutes after she left!  He did blame himself and apologized, and offered to provide us with a free dessert. At that point, we were full, didn't want to stick around any longer, and were just floored at how a table so close to the cash register (near the front of the entrance) could have been avoided/ignored/left for so long!What started as a really nice Christmas day was soured at this place. The menu here looks good, but honestly, the food is typical hotel quality. Based on food quality and terrible service, we will not return to this Hyatt restaurant or any other Hyatt.",2,,

We came into this restaurant for breakfast and were in a bit of a hurry but the place was empty so we decided to give it a shot. The waiter came and took our drink order and brought the wrong drinks out (took around 20 minutes for us to get our waters) then proceeded to not come back to take our food order for another 30 minutes. We finally decided enough was enough and flagged a different staff member down for our bill who then had to go find another waiter which took an extra 30 minutes or so. Complete waste of time, will never be coming back and would recommend to steer clear of this place. Each and every staff member acts as if they detest working here.",,,

I had meatball sliders because it sounded really good. However, it was a disappointment. The meatball was tiny, it was half the size of the buns and there was no sauce!

I am a Diamond member so had the breakfast comped. But no way would I pay that price for the food. Also I wouldn't pay cause of the service. Poor all three days. Servers had a look of ""I don't want to be here at all."" The while ordering the first day the server gave a ""come on"" hand signal like she was in a big rush. No smile the whole time. The last day I thought our server would be better. Came with a smile but after our order came out rarely saw her. Had to get her attention. Forgot to bring stuff out. So 3 for the food. 1 for the service. So it's fine if it's comped but I would never pay for it.",1,,

We came in around 10:30am and there were plenty of empty seats. The modern-diner feel is quite fun. I love the writings on the wall; not sure where it quoted from, but it's interesting. ""The first five days after a weekend is the hardest...if we are not supposed to have midnight snacks, then why is there a light in the fridge?"" Lol'ed. Now to the food. We actually didn't have a high expectation for a place like this. But this place surprised us, in a pleasant way. Here are what we had:Hash and eggs - everything was burned (see the pic) but super tasty!!! (Probably not very heathy though, but who cares? Lol) the onions were crispy and potatoes were crunchy. Great dish. My hubby finished every bit of it!! Cheese polenta - this is quite nice too. The sausage and sautéed mushrooms in it were right on the spot. I love the picked onions too - perfect balance for the dish since other things were on a heavy side.We also had Greek yogurt and a glass of banana orange smoothie. We were pretty happy with everything. Service was super fast and server was quite friendly too.Nice place to have a quick brunch!The hostess and server were both very friendly.",1,1,

33,Kevin H.,"San Francisco, CA",110,210,952,2.0,2/9/2014,"So... I ordered rom service here tonight, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.First of all, the diet coke was $4.75. I know at nicer restaurants, $4.75 is okay, but when a burger + salad / fries costs $18, I think charging 26% of the entree price for a non-alcoholic beverage is steep. Nevertheless, I ordered it... I was even more annoyed when it was delivered in a baby 8 oz glass bottle! For $4.75, you don't even get the pleasure of drinking from a 12 oz can. Nope. 8 oz for you.I ordered two items: the vegan chili and the beet salad + chicken. The vegan chilli was really tasty, but I asked for it to be served with a piece of bread and they forgot that. That aside, I got nothin' against the vegan chilli.I was less impressed with my beet salad with goat cheese. A quick internet image search of ""beet salad"" would lead one to believe that beets should be the primary ingredient. I would also assume goat cheese to be prominent as well. Instead, it was mostly greens, with chunks of beats scattered on top. I wasn't that impressed. I also couldn't find any goat cheese... Then when I dug to the very bottom, I finally found something that was goat cheese flavored, but there were no chunks in there.Maybe I was dumb... I probably should have just gotten a burger... but the beet salad sounded great, and on a cold night, nothing's better than chilli. If you're staying at the hotel, this place is fine, but I'd probably stick to a burger. If you're not staying at the hotel, considering the plethora of dining options in the area, I can't really see why would come here on your own.",,,

I ordered a salted caramel milkshake (the name sold it) and their signature burger. Staff: Friendly. Environment: Very Clean and modern looking. Price: Medium (around $17-$25 per entree) Food: Their milkshake was pretty much like cold milk with flavor. It was runny, like they just used a little bit of ice cream or blended it way too much and broke the consistency. The burger was horrible. They literally used a sweet potato roll as the bun, yeah like a cheap dinner roll. It did NOT go well with the burger and sundried tomatoes. They put WAY TOO MUCH CHEESE, I had to yank the chunks off so I could eat it, i love cheese but if you put too much, it just gets in the way of the rest of the flavor. Trust me, it was NOT a pleasant experience. all I'm saying is that you can get a better burger at a Denny's... And just so you don't forget... dinner rolls for buns. I rest my case.",1,1,

The appetizers were greasy and we were not able to enjoy it at all. One of the servers started clapping when we asked for the check since we were the last costumers in the place.

We stayed at the Hyatt at Times Square and went to this street level bar each day for drinks before dinner, the service is just incredibly slow at non peak hours. We sat outside each day at about 5pm and usually struggled to place the order or get repeat rounds. On more than two occasions we had to go into the main restaurant to grab someone's attention to come and take our orders. They do good alcoholic margaritas on the rocks (no option of a frozen one!!!) we only had drinks so you can't really go wrong with that which is why only due to the slow response and service I have given them a three rating.

Updated review",Wow whoa hold on staying in the hyatt Times Square do not do not I repeat do not eat at T45. So we arrive at 10am and we are given lunch menus so we select items from the lunch menu and are told sorry it's not lunch. So we get past that and order breakfast. It takes approximately 35 minutes for our order. Which comes out totally wrong. The waiter blames the cook the manager blames waiter needless to say unhappy unhappy unhappy. Choose another resturant please. NYC is a big place eat somewhere else.  For all the grief they did comp a meal and took our beverages off the menu.,,,

47,Samantha B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",19,66,118,3.0,7/5/2014,Just stopped in for a small snack. I was greeted at the door promptly upon my arrival . I ordered a cheese fry and chocolate shake total $12.00. The milkshake was runny not thick at all. The order of fries were huge and it came with a bowl of cheese. Ummm I guess it was ok nothing to write home about,,,
48,Kristen M.,"Springvale, ME",21,47,16,4.0,4/2/2014,"Stopped in for a little soup before a show and the chicken soup hit the spot. A bit bland, but I'd much rather ADD salt than have something too salty. Very basic soup, good broth, white and dark meat chicken and shredded carrots, which was a surprise. The croutons were great, but wasn't so much a fan of the elbow macaroni noodles. All in all, I'd give the food a 3 (the other food I saw looked delicious), but because the servers were super nice, I bumped it up. I travel alone a lot and you'd be surprised how a single woman is treated in most places! So thanks, cute, Irish bartender and super spunky hostess! I'll definitely be back!",,,
49,Kristina K.,"Manhattan, NY",42,61,11,5.0,5/22/2014,"Great atmiosphere--you don't realize you are in Times Square! Great food, I recommend the Grilled Cheese with shredded chicken and avocado and roasted jalapeno. A must-have? The Matcha Green Team milkshake. It is the BEST.",,,
50,Kareena B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,4.0,2/5/2016,Nice and cozy place found on Hyatt Times Square ground floor . Menu isn't extensive but just what you need for breakfast . Their Croissant is well worth trying . It's yummy and served hot,,,

52,Am Y.,"New York, NY",42,34,5,1.0,6/21/2016,"Horrible service!! Came here for lunch from work. Always walked by and it looked like a nice chill place to have a bite, so finally gave it a try. Bad idea!! Atmosphere was a weird vibe...couldn't tell if it was a lounge-y bar or diner. I should've known upon entering when it's prime-time lunch hour (1:00pm) and the place was empty except for 1 other table. I ordered the lobster roll and the waitor asked if i wanted fries or onion rings. I said no thanks and he shouts ""Nothing!?!"" When the food arrived, they forgot my drink, so we had to flag down a different waitor to get it. The lobster roll was just a tiny sliver of meat on top of a buttered roll. I am from New England and for $18, we get about 10 times as much meat, but this is NYC, so i thought it would be at least comparable to other NYC lobster rolls...not! No one came back while we were eating to see how everything was or ask if we wanted any more drinks since my glass was empty. The place was empty so i'm not sure how they would've handled it if they actually had customers to serve. We had to flag someone down to get our bill. After that, we waited so long for someone to come take my credit card, that my friend had to leave first to get back to the office while I sat there waiting by myself. I watched as about 4 of the waitors and servers looked super busy rushing around, but there were NO tables! Finally gave up and flagged another waitor down to take my credit card, she had to yell for the original waitor to come and pick it up from me. Never got a thank you or how was everything. Such horrible unacceptable service! I would never come back even though I only work a block away!",,,
53,Stephen P.,"Pittstown, NJ",0,67,0,3.0,12/3/2014,"Went here for the first time. Service is very prompt and attentive. Limited menu for a ""diner"". Food quantity somewhat small. Food quality, ok. Pricey for what you get.",,,
54,Liz B.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",3,11,0,5.0,6/22/2014,"I had the chicken bacon ranch salad with a side of fries. The food and the service was wonderful. Friendly staff with quick efficient service. Great location, right off of Times Square, and in the lobby of the Hyatt. Will definitely eat here again.",,,
