0,Stefan T.,"New York, NY",105,93,186,5.0,11/3/2018,Bar inside the CitizenM hotel. You'll have to enter the hotel and go down the stairs to get here. They have a special Heineken beer called H41 on draft and variety of cocktails available. Art work is surrounding the bar area and there's bar and regular seating available. Great spot for a meet up with friends if you don't want an overcrowded loud bar.,1,,
