LOVED their DOWN comforter and the beds were comfortable bed. Supportive and soft.Little things like the bed reading light was cool and appreciated, especially when you're the only one still up.Their 24 hour market serves Starbucks coffee, no salads, mainly snacks, bagels, cereal and drinks, including wine. No coffee maker in the room.Cons: 1) Shower faucet was too sensitive. Water was either cold or scalding. 2) The touch activated light plate in bathroom seemed to work randomly for me. What about a simple press an on/off switch? 3) Storage fee $3 per item after checkoutWine tasting for some guests every two weeks with light bites - actually a meal! Had shrimp and duck! Nice quiet patio. I could see the top part of Chrysler building from it.Since it rained during my stay the hotel's tunnel to Grand Central Station was so convenient.It's also walking distance to Saks, St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rockefeller Center.Their location is a big sell but their lobby is an odd misuse of space. Would stay here again hoping my room does not have a glitchy shower faucet.",,,

Updated review","Last time I stayed here was 5 years ago.  This time around we got a club access king size bed room.  It was small.  Much smaller than what I remember.  This room did however have 2 min refrigs and had ample chest drawers, unlike some hotel rooms that doesn't even have one. The bed was nice and soft and the bathroom albeit very small, did have a nice walk in shower. A big 65"" tv too. There is no view to be had. Location is central to times square, rockefeller center and 5th avenue, but man so many panhandlers outside hotel, since it is next to Grand Central terminal.  The club lounge was nice enough, with very limited seating though, for such a large hotel.  It does have some high chairs for babies though :). The daily club lounge breakfast rotates its food, but always has scrambled eggs and some other hot food (bacon one day, hashbrowns another day), but always has smoked salmon, which was great.  Lots of pastries, bagels, breads, fruits, and has cheese and some deli meat too.  Their 5PM food display consists of a costco type finger food (crab cakes one day, lobster egg roll another) with cheese, crackers, fruit, and after 8PM, they have a dessert or two with cookie jars. They have a honor bar and it is not free.  Just write own your room number and what you drank.  Hope people don't cheat here. Wish they had bottled water and soda cans to bring up to the room though, like Marriott/Renaissance clubs.  Parking is very high at $80 a night! They shut down the water the last day we were there.  I mean really! I couldn't flush, or use sink, or take a shower.  They left a note under the door the night before.  I mean come on man!  That is why I lowered the rating.  Boo.",12,5,8
5,Michael N.,"Manhattan, NY",341,79,160,4.0,10/22/2018,Nice hotel in the city ... Dimly lit and beautiful on the inside. The rooms are spacious enough to accommodate any couple and the cocktail lounge is   Great. My first time ever eating tuna tartare was serve here and it was a pleasure. It's one of my main appetizers next to foie Gras. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who visiting the city and hopes to be at the center of everything that is NYC.,,,
6,Joy D.,"Washington, DC",231,200,275,1.0,7/5/2018,"(Update: shout out to Gregory the front desk manager who was very helpful and to the engineer staff who work late, the 1 Star is for them). Hyatt property is usually our go to when traveling, but this is definitely my least favorite.We stayed here the first time years ago and it wasn't great but it's relatively cheap compared to other options such as Andaz one block away. Today my mom and I come here to give it a second try. First of all, there is a new $25 destination fee, and it isn't waived for World of Hyatt members, which isn't a huge deal, though based on many reviews people aren't too thrilled about it. When we got to the room, it's empty! I mean, EMPTY! There's is no water (a complementary 2 bottles of water voucher was given upon check in), not even cotton swab/comb etc... I don't remember ever going to any Grand Hyatt that was so ""bare"" before... Room wise, the bathroom sink was tiny, stains on the couch... bath tub is clogged as soon as we turned on the shower (took two hours to have someone stop by at 11:20pm, because the engineer was busy solving another issue, totally understandable but don't say help would arrive ""right away"" when it wasn't the case)... The market place staff is rude ($15 of the $25 destination fee can be used toward the Market at lobby but the customer service doesn't make you feel like even shop there) maybe because they were overwhelmed by everyone wanting to spend their credit... My husband couldn't even believe this was how my stay went as he always stays at Hyatt when traveling for work and he has plenty of experience at different category of the property and rarely had an issue. I know for sure that we are never staying here again, I'd rather pay a little more and stay at Andaz where we are always pampered and spoiled (Nespresso, snacks, etc, you name it!) I think this is where you get what you paid for (but again this particular Grand Hyatt can be expensive too during peak season)... definitely a huge disappointment...",7,1,3
7,Nathan M.,"Milwaukee, WI",96,88,619,5.0,9/17/2018,For someone who travels for a living You come to appreciate the little things about the hotels you stay in. When in NYC my choice in hotels is the Grand Hyatt. Just a 15-20min taxi drive from LGA the hotel is in the perfect spot. Besides being across the street from my office it's also beside Grand Central Station. Just blocks from Bryant Park it is the perfect base station for a holiday visit. It's always bustling with the excitement of NYC. The rooms are small but that is what you come to expect in NY. The staff have always been helpful and you can even borrow a red umbrella if you get caught in the city on a rainy day. Just know that this in not your Holiday Inn Hotel so your bill will reflect it. The problem is the other chain hotels are also expensive and very run down. If you want a smooth visit I'd suggest the Hyatt.,1,,2
8,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",76,1148,1294,3.0,9/18/2018,"Stayed for 3 nights at this hotel. Great location and lots of things to do nearby, no complaints about that.Positives were definitely the room size, beds, and being able to adjust air conditioning. However, I had similar issues to reviewers who said there was low water pressure...because I had that problem too at the top floor. It was a bit difficult to take showers, that was for sure.Concierge staff was hit and miss. The bussers were attentive, but the main desk was really slow. It took almost 30 minutes for me to check out of the hotel cause of how slow they were, and they consistently had to double check with the manager to ensure I was checked out properly.Lots of cool art in this hotel too, so don't be surprised to see people taking photos inside.I guess if location is your primary concern, this hotel fits your bill. Don't expect a 5-star service and experience though.",1,,

Updated review","I went and stayed and the Grand Hyatt after all, though not for any of the conferences that seem to keep the place occupied. I went with my mom, whose honest-to-God hobby is maintaining her Hyatt Globalist status, no easy task for a near 60-year-old who doesn't travel for work. She was able to book a stay here at under $200 a night, and cashed in one of her suite upgrades. I tagged along.The Grand Hyatt isn't the nicest hotel. The public areas are better-looking than the rooms, with a couple of cool giant face sculptures in the lobby--I guess they're by Jaume Plensa, and they were part of a $130 million renovation in 2011 that must not have gone deep with the rooms. We stayed in two different suites, moving up when a bigger one became available. The first was fine; the second was also fine, with a door between the bedroom and living area. Both were spacious and clean, if kind of depressing in that generic conference hotel kind of way. The bathrooms were borderline ugly, and the bath products weren't my favorite, but it was all plenty tolerable.Her Globalist status also entitled us to free breakfast and a $15 daily credit to use in the little convenience store downstairs. I don't eat much breakfast, but I did enjoy some soda with a view on the club level. As for that shopping allowance, it didn't stretch very far. Everything in that place was goofily expensive. I think she stocked up on like bottled water and cashews.My mom had one weird experience that I wasn't around for, but that's probably worth noting. I guess when she checked in, the bed was made, but the sheets and mattress were wet underneath the covers, with a suspicious yellowish liquid that may or may not have been urine. The staff changed the sheets, but whatever it was still soaked through from the mattress, and they eventually just swapped out the mattress. It was a whole process, though the staff seemed to be nice about it. My mom also shook them down for a serious windfall of Hyatt points (they tried to pay her cash value, but she'd paid so little for the room that she stuck to points and was ultimately pleased that she'd maybe lied down in a pissed-in bed).I wouldn't pick Grand Hyatt if I were visiting New York solo, but it's not a bad place to stay if you can find a good rate. The location is convenient and the rooms are standard but serviceable. If you find disconcerting wet things in your bed, you will be compensated accordingly, at least as long as you have Globalist status.",7,3,4
10,Pamela A.,"New York, NY",157,313,685,4.0,3/23/2018,"Once you enter the hotel you're immediately greeted by very cool art and modern aesthetics. We were really impressed as we entered. My one night stay on Saturday with out of town friends was great. We had a double club room which was spacious enough and was perfect for three of us. You could totally fit one more person ( total of 4) and still be comfortable. The beds were very comfy! My friends said they'd definitely return next time they come to NY. The Club room was great. There's a happy hour 5-8pm and there are snacks, coffee and juices during the day. We also noticed a rooftop which would be really cool in the spring and summertime.My only annoyances were that water wasn't already in the room. Every Hyatt I've visited has free bottles in the room which is convenient. They did give you a credit for one per day at the market but it's not the same. Also as a member of the Hyatt regards having to pay money to store my luggage seemed surprising. I understand that it's a huge hotel but members of World of Hyatt like myself deserve more freebies. There are too many nyc hotels and if you want loyal and repeat clients you have to distinguish yourself. Little things count!",4,,2

The drinks their especially the muddled raspberry dark stormy was amazing.  Pillows were ok, beds were below average and need to be updated.  Nice Tv's and very modern light switches (you can control the temp from night stand by bed which is nice), but they are weird touch sensitivity so it may take a few mins to get used to that.",2,,

13,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",395,4085,7998,3.0,6/19/2018,"This hotel has been updated over the years, but it still sees a lot of people come in and out and, as a result, sees a lot of wear and tear. The rooms themselves aren't anything special, and are on the small side as is the case with many NYC hotels. The key advantages to staying here are its location directly atop Grand Central Station (there is a side door that takes you right inside) and its ability to host large conferences in both formal function halls as well as makeshift breakout rooms converted out of of normal hotel rooms. For a stay that's mostly about business (read: you won't be in the room much except to crash), it's OK enough.",7,3,5

I liked being able to get a room with two full sized beds that was petite but well proportioned. Couple things - it's loud. You can hear the people in the hallways all day and night. Certainly some of that is to be expected but you could hear the entire conversations. The street noise is rather significant too. Giving ear plugs would have been a nice amenity since there really weren't any (no coffee or whatnot). The biggest problem is the lights. They have this weird ""modern"" light switch that was allegedly motion activated but didn't seem to function properly in our room or our friend's. It made for some hilarity when the lights would turn off mid shower. It also meant that getting up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night risked turning on the lights for the entire room.

Came and checked in here for the US Open tennis slam, took the red eye flight from SFO and check in around 8am in the morning. the front desk agent, I will call him ""obama's son"", help me check in. I gave him those 5 paper certificate ( kinda like a gift card but in paper forms) for 5 nights which includes breakfast and drinks. I wanted to apologize to ""obama's son"" for all the paperwork, but he became rude, hostile and agitated about it and started calling me: ""you people this!"" and ""you people that!"" I was tired and needed to sleep so, I brushed whatever he said. He gave me a room near the elevator, even though my WOH profile said, a quiet room ( away from elevators) I was told that this hotel is at capacity when i checked in.2. Incompetent staff and Impersonal - by the time i was in my room, I have called the housekeeping to tell them that I dont want any housekeeping done on my room on certain dates, sure enough, every mother effing day for 3 days, they have called at 5a, 6a, 7a to tell me housekeeping, seriously! I was at the hotel bar, the older male bartender didnt even bother to ask me if I needed a drink and I was there for like 10 mins, he just went about this business, went ahead and closed his station out until a woman came in and she then and only then that she ask me if I needed a drink. she was nice, warm and accommodating, I gave her a fat tip. Is it really that hard or difficult to give or ask someone if they need a drink ? and they get paid to ignore loyal guest !3. Drama queens - the 3rd day, I came to the front desk to ask if I can have a late check out, she asked for my room number ( which i gave gladly) and to her shock, put her two hands on her mouth, went to her left side corner slightly, gave a look of shocked as if telling me.....""you paid this much for this room?"", when she calm down and got her act together, she told me that I need to ask the manager for that. did she do it at that moment, ""hell to the no!"" I supposed they cant wait for a guest who paid on a 3rd party discounted rate of $50.00 ( aka priceline, etc) for them to say yes !Most frustrating and infuriating ""grand"" brand i have ever stayed at !!Now you have a better understanding on why most people book a third party discount rate than directly thru the hotel website, because of all these stupid, idiotic hassle !",3,,
18,Jim J.,"Park Ridge, IL",3056,432,1369,4.0,10/6/2017,"I really enjoyed the Grand Hyatt on a recent stay and as an attendee at a conference.  The hotel itself is spectacular and situated right next to Grand Central Station.  This makes getting around the city very easy by subway or Uber.  There is a lot of positive energy in the lobby, but that noise doesn't get too loud.  The décor is very modern and there are cool 10 foot tall statues of distorted faces.  I was pleased that the hotel staff was all very friendly and professional.  The rooms we very clean and spacious by NYC standards.  My ""upgraded"" room was a pretty good size and had plenty of window space.  The bed was very comfortable along with the pillows.  The whole room was recently updated and was relatively quiet for its location.  When I opened the windows on the 20th floor it sounded like I was on the street.The conference facilities were first rate.  The staff was very helpful in helping our group navigate the space and were always helpful.  The food was great for both breakfast and lunch.  They did a great job of using a ballroom setting to conduct a kick off meeting and lunch presentation.  It made the lunch and learn much more effective - I recommend this format for meeting organizers if they are hosting here.In terms of dining - there is a bar, restaurant and marketplace.  The marketplace is open 24/7 so you can always grab a snack if you don't want to leave the property.  I didn't try the bar or restaurant, but I assume it is decent, but high priced food.

Updated review","We love having ""Stay-cation"" within our home city aka The Big Apple  This is a review we are doing on Grand Hyatt New York after having few stay experiences. I do believe having a Diamond/Globalist status does help however we have seen a hit/miss when staying at this property.I bring my family quite often and at times I have had issues where the hotel has run out of ""slippers"" and other times I would need to make a few calls just to get something delivered to the room. However, I consider this to be a ""First World Problem"".Location: You will not get a better hotel than Grand Hyatt NY when it comes to its location. It's literally on top of  Grand Central Terminal (Historic Station) and can allow you to travel throughout the city without any issues. This is most liked during the time of extreme cold or hot weather.Check-In Experience: It varies depending on the time and day - sometimes we breeze through the World of Hyatt line and sometimes it can take 30min to check-in, however, the staff are quite friendly every time we have checked into the hotel.Rooms: We have stayed from Basic Standard room to Executive Suite and you will see wear & tear because the hotel is OLD and although they try certain rooms can give you a feel of staying at a motel. The suites are also in need of major renovation.The Grand Lounge/Breakfast: The lounge is great because it offers you free hot and cold beverages throughout the day for free its operating hours are 6 am - 9:30 pm. However the Breakfast and Evening snacks are nice because it's free, but for people like us who consume only halal meat - the options become very limited  When the weather is nice - the lounge has a huge deck which offers the great view of the city building while enjoying a nice cup of chai.Overall - we will come again and stay mainly because of NISHA JOHN - we have had many issues before but since Nisha has become our go-to person when booking our stay - the experience went from Horrible to Amazing  Hyatt is truly lucky to have someone like her, she is one of the main reason why I love booking my stays at Grand Hyatt NY.",2,2,2
23,Joel L.,"Tacoma, WA",13,41,0,2.0,7/27/2018,We stayed here July 2018. We had a fairly significant issue with our room.  When we brought it to the attention of management onsite they were kind but slow and unresponsive to work with. I think they had a shift change and didn't communicate with the next shift of managers well. While our initial interaction was less than positive we did receive a call from a senior level exec from Hyatt and everything was eventually fixed. I do believe they cared about our issue but the front line management communication was the real problem. The location is amazing. Right next to Grand Central Station and all of Manhattan is no more than 15 minutes away from your room.,2,,
24,Shannon K.,"Ronkonkoma, NY",232,132,477,4.0,8/1/2017,"What a beautiful hotel! The lobby was very detailed in its decor, with a lot of interesting designs to look at. There's a huge sitting area in the lobby for people to hang out and relax while they are waiting for check in. The woman Diana at the service desk who helped me was extremely sweet. I was able to get early check in and since they were out of rooms with 2 queen beds she waived the fee of a rollaway bed. There is a nice little cafe in the lobby serving coffee, snacks, and quick grab & go breakfasts. This hotel has a crazy amount of elevators! I never once had to wait long for an elevator going up to my hotel room. The room had a decent view and was very spacious and included a mini fridge and a couch along the window. The central location of this hotel is awesome, and there are tons of restaurants and coffee shops around. Would definitely stay here again.",8,1,4
25,Meghan S.,"Southbury, CT",71,84,273,4.0,5/6/2018,"We decided to stay in the city because we were going to a Yankee game earlier in the day and thought why not just go to the city since it's also cinco de mayo? I booked this hotel through a Priceline express deal saying it was a 4 star hotel and was a little concerned about my upcoming visit after reading some reviews on yelp. Honestly don't listen to half of the bad reviews. This hotel is excellent! Also conveniently located RIGHT NEXT to grand central terminal! Upon checking in, we were asked if we wanted a free room upgrade to a king sized bed and that the room was handicap accessible so it was a bit larger. We gladly took the upgrade! Our room was on the 34th floor and it probably took less than a minute to go from the lobby to the room. The elevator was so fast. Our room was nice, there was a mini fridge for us to put our waters and snacks, and the bed was super comfy. The light switches were one touch and there was a soft lighting setting as well which was very cool. The bathroom was on the larger side and the shower drain didn't look like it was in the best condition but the hotel has been around for awhile and shower drains are a pain to keep pristine so we didn't mind much. The room had a huge closet and extra blankets too. It didn't seem much larger than I would expect a regular hotel room to be, so we weren't quite positive about how it was handicap accessible. The other downside we noticed was with the AC. The vent was situated on a wall directly facing another wall and not the entirety of the room, so it took awhile to get cool. The bar and restaurant area was amazing and made of all windows. It overlooked grand central and the road. We stopped in for a drink and our bartender was very nice and talkative. He also gave us some snack mix to pick at while we drank which was delicious. I was amazed by the scenery and beauty of the bar. It was so elegant and modern. My drink (the manhattan/ midtown fizz) was excellent as well! The hotel also has a market, which in typical NYC fashion was over priced but we were able to get waters and snacks there. Overall, the hotel has a lot to offer and was very nice. It isn't our favorite hotel in the city that we've stayed at and we've stayed at quite a few, but it's definitely up there!",,,
26,Kim K.,"Wenham, MA",85,5,0,4.0,9/30/2018,The service at the Hyatt is amazing. I had the nicest time there during a very busy week the place was packed the elevators took forever the rooms are very average BUT the staff makes it a 9+. Encountered an amazing women that helped me get checked in even though I arrived early. The doorman was kind and helpful the maid sweet and nice the guy that pulled up my car hung with me even though it took an hour again (UNGA) week and the front desk divided my bill and put  it on two credit cards and did not skip a beat.

27,John C.,"Orlando, FL",142,780,912,5.0,1/11/2018,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Grand Hyatt NY, especially the Grand Club, which for a modest daily charge offered complimentary breakfast, coffee, soft drinks, snacks, appetizers and optional adult beverages for purchases.  Our room, however, was very small.  In fact, it was one of the smallest on our 33rd-floor location.  We were granted a higher floor; and, were located away from the elevator, as I had requested.  However, sleeping three people in two double beds, when the online photos show a sofa in the room was a little difficult.  The diminutive bathroom also proved challenging, although the shower and bath always had more than sufficient hot water.  The hotel provides direct access to Grand Central Terminal; and, while we experienced record cold weather during our stay, we didn't have to suffer, as the terminals and subways were quite warm, sometimes even hot!  Taxi service; and, the help of the bellmen, made short, local trips to Broadway and museums almost effortless.  We took two Uber trips during our stay; and, found the taxis a better option.Arriving late one night, after seeing Hamilton, we noticed heightened security in the lobby verifying that people were staying at the hotel.  This was quite reassuring as we'd read about security concerns in other reviews.  The front desk staff were capable, friendly, and, I taxed them no end with special requests, including printing our tour bus tickets.  Every request was handled professionally and with a can-do attitude.  My only gripe would be the ""security deposit"" policy, which actually only places a ""hold"" via credit card authorization (when I was told a hard-charge had been made, which would be later refunded.)  My actual expenses were exactly the charges incurred, nothing more.Our status with World of Hyatt included two free bottles of water each day in the hotel store, which we took advantage of.  The store is often busy with commuters stopping in for fresh-cooked breakfast items and coffee and sandwiches at lunch.  We made an attempt to purchase dinner for our daughter; but, prices were double those in the foodcourt next door.",4,2,4
28,Mindy L.,"Boston, MA",152,757,302,3.0,3/6/2018,"From what I could tell, the Grand Hyatt is undergoing some transformations. The lobby seems to be in a state of flux and the rooms (at least my own) found itself in need of a face lift. I requested a high floor and wood floors (which I got). I appreciated the little things (separate room with a door for the toilet and tub leaving the sink free for someone else to use when you are doing your business and the electric blinds). It was just a general feeling of overuse. The walls were scuffed and peeling, the blinds had punctures and tears, the cupboard no longer closed flush with the rest of the cabinet, etc. The room was clean, but when I checked, the robe in the closet didn't seem fresh...so I passed on walking around in that. I ordered breakfast to the room as I had an early flight to catch in the morning and a pot of coffee, an OJ and the smoked salmon on a bagel cost me $75.00 with tip. What. The. Fudge. I know that hotel room service is overpriced, but a $75.00 price tag on a bagel with some smoked salmon and bitter brew that I couldn't even finish a cup of? Disappointing. There was also a random pile of plastic hangers strewn about the hallway (first they were haphazardly piled on the door knob of a room...then they were strewn about the hallway on my next walk to my room). I have to imagine that someone from the hotel is on any given floor sometime throughout the day...but for 24 hours...not a soul touched the hangers. I would come back, the convenient location is great and I'm a Hyatt fan...but I might give them some time to complete whatever updates they are working on.",,,1
29,Lauren W.,"Orlando, FL",72,90,112,5.0,8/23/2017,This was my second stay and it was much better than my first a few years ago.  My room was great and the bed was comfy.  Bathroom was a bit small but not a big deal for me.  The conference facilities were great and the location of the hotel can't be beat!!  Awesome indoor access to grand central shops and trains!!My favorite highlight... checking in on the app and not having to wait in lines.   AMAZE!!!,,,2

FYI it does not.Second, my new room... the fan in the bathroom doesn't turn off no matter what you do.  FLASH BACK to my first room if you remember?  I tried closing the door,  turning the lights on.. off... on... off... hiding around the corner.  Nothing.  Soooo that's fun to try and sleep through the night with a fan going. Tried to order room service and it said it's not available, so went down to the New York Central which is a restaurant/bar at the hotel to get something to take up to my room.  Guess what?  They don't do to-go orders!  Of course they don't.  So I'm now sitting in my sweats, a hat and a hoodie, in the dining area, in which they put me in the FAR back corner away from everyone... I'm sure so that I don't embarrass them.  2 more nights here... why do I stay?  Because clearly I've lost my mind.",2,1,

33,Kelly Y.,"San Mateo, CA",76,281,359,3.0,12/27/2017,"The interior design and furnishings look great. However I'm very disappointed at the cleaning. The toilet had what looked like dried urine with dust stuck to it that we had to wipe off. There was a hair on the towel. The nightstand has a place that juts out at the bottom towards the bed and that had visible sticky appearing stuff on it as if someone spilled soda there. Really ruins the experience. They need to put more effort into cleaning, especially at the rates we're paying. Most hotels give you a couple of bottles of complimentary water but not this place. We drank tap water and also went to get filtered water from their gym on the 16th floorWhen we walked in the room the window was open- it's 24F outside! And that was the high! It turns out the room heater was broken. the second night we realized the heater was doing the opposite of what we asked. the thermostat was reading 93 (felt more like 80's) and the heater kept going though we set it to 68. they were prompt in getting someone out to fix it.The lines at checkin counters are very disorganized. Ppl didn't know where to stand and there were like 3 different lines.Everyone we met was nice thoughI appreciate they were able to send us a crib (pack and play) so that was nice of them. Came with a package of baby toiletries. Location is SUPER convenient. to get on the subway or go to Grand Central station where there is food and a market/grocery store, you don't even need to step on a sidewalk. First floor of the hotel itself has a 24 hour convenience store. Uber accepts it as a pickup site right out front as well.Anyway this could be a really nice hotel if they just stepped it up a little with the cleaning",1,,

37,Ed M.,"Ahnatal, Germany",3,153,164,4.0,2/8/2018,"This is an unusual Hyatt which is an old friend in NYC.  They have so many rooms of different levels that there is always one that suits us.  And the location is simply fantastic, any kind of transportation to anywhere in the city, subway at rush hour for example.  Now there are more taxis than every with the competition from Lyft and Uber.We had a large double and everything was conveniently arranged.  Very clean carpets, obviously fresh sheets and linen.  A nice contrast from the hotel we just left.  There was a dance competition in the city at the time and this hotel was simply swamped, especially the lobby.  Check-in was a little snottie, but this is not a regular Grand Hyatt.  Bell service and concierge have always been good.  This hotel opens right into Grand Central Station where they have a big market and a big food court.  The Old Oyster bar is also somewhere there.  Between all of these there are so many places to eat.  But it is all pretty standard fare with convenience.  The Grand Central market on the other side of the food court has good dessert.  The bread also looks good.  But we had dinner at a fantastic French provincial restaurant elsewhere (other review of le coq).",,,

I'm in this city a few times a year so I know it well. Midtown East is my favourite area. Expedia was offering a good deal for a room at the Grand Hyatt so I quickly booked three nights.Location: you're close to practically everything! My friends don't eat breakfast, but I do; your steps from many coffee shops and eateries. I checked out a different coffee shop each morning that I stayed here. You're also very close to Grand Central Station (literally beside the hotel), subway, Bryant Park, Theatre District, and 5th Avenue. Additionally, most airport shuttles stop at Grand Central. I arrived at Newark at 12:30 AM so it was nice to be dropped off right in front of the hotel.Room: for New York, the room with two double beds is very spacious. Our room also had a large closet, bar fridge and big television screen.Price: as mentioned, I found a deal on Expedia. Do your research and find deals for this hotel.

Standard room are standard-mine was road hard and put away wet but it was a bed, shower, TV which was all I needed.  The Club level was worth paying for the upgrade -- larger room with out as much wear and tear.  The room came with access to the Club Lounge -- nice breakfast, cocktails, snacks depending on the time of day.  This is a large hotel but it's all about location location location.  Almost every subway line is in the area.  Metro North is next door.   If your driving or taxiing or ubering be patient traffic to the front door is always a challenge.",3,1,8

We visited once, but I felt like it made the hotel overly crowded inside and out. Hotel staff did actively check for keys at night near the elevators. While the hotel lobby is grand and very elegant, the rooms did not match that same vibe. Both of our rooms, while clean, exhibited great wear and tear. The size of the room wasn't bad, but the bathroom-in comparison- was tiny. Every toilet flush with the metal handle felt like using a public restroom. Our friends had gnats in the bathroom (that was weird) and had problems with their iron. Both problems were reported and corrected, but still uncomfortable to deal with. I don't feel like the rate ($ 408/ $377 a night before tax and fees) for a standard room was a great deal (or steal) to justify these nuisances.

It's not the first time we arrived to a dirty room. The second time we had a similar issue with a dirty room, there were crumbs and chocolate chips on the carpet. At that time it took 4 hours for someone to come to the room and vacuum. The last time they send the cleaning lady faster because we were furious. Completely unacceptable for a hotel where you spend som much money. The rates are high which it's ok for NYC but at least you would expect a clean room.Three stars because the location it's great.

We checked into the hotel Friday and that evening we went down to the cafe to purchase some snacks and breakfast for the following morning and weekend, all of which needed to be refrigerated. We get up stairs and realize our refrigerator is not working. So I pick up the phone and call the front desk, they transfer me to housekeeping and they tell me that someone will be up shortly. 30 minutes go by and nobody came so we called again and this time talk to a manager in housekeeping and she said someone would bring us a new one in 15 minutes. 15 minutes go by and nobody came so we gave them the benefit of the doubt and left a note along with all of our semi cold food now and asked them to put everything in the fridge when they came up. Hours later we came back and they had put a different fridge in the corner of our room and it was leaking water all over our floor and our food was never put in it and it all had spoiled. We called again, this time a manager came up to our room and she said another fridge would be brought up and she took all my food and assured me that it would be taken care of and she would get me new food. About 10 pm when we were asleep, housekeeping brought another fridge to our room, he dropped it off and now we have (3) fridges in our room. Following morning comes and nobody ever replaced our food like we were told so I went to front desk and spoke to a manager and he told us he was going to take cAre of this and ""comp"" everything we got from the cafe.. well little did he know and we forgot but we had used a 25 points gift card for cafe and our $15 credit we had so that stuff was already being comp'd so in reality he did nothing to fix this problem. Following morning we go to check out and I had to argue with management because they weren't comping anything based on the story I gave them and the managers card I gave them. Completely rude and unprofessional, then I get my bill, and the ""free"" upgrade we were given at checkout when the lady had said , "" happy anniversary, I've upgraded you to a better room"" I ended up paying $50 for it and walked away with a $156 bill from them and I didn't even spend anything at the hotel. How does this happen!! We will not stay here again, horrible customer service, management has a tendency to tell you something and not follow their word. Horrible horrible stAy here.",1,,

65,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",550,836,2196,2.0,6/22/2016,"I came here to conduct my hotel inspection for my class last semester and unfortunately, I wasn't impressed by the decor/cleanliness of this hotel It's great that this hotel is located right next to Grand Central Terminal which provides ample shopping opportunities to your guests and tourists around the neighborhood. The statues and design of the hotel is quite exquisite.During my inspection, I noticed that the entrance of hotel was filled with disgusting cigarette buds and there was also no doorman present. The seating area at the lobby had semi-empty glasses with tea bags and bottles were left unattended. There was also no sign anywhere that indicated where the public restrooms were located, so I had to ask the front desk instead.The public restroom wasn't fully cleaned. There were five stalls and five sinks, but two of the sinks had missing soap dispenser. There was also a vending machine that sold the following products: iPhone charge, ear phones, and gum. These items aren't necessary to purchase in a women's restroom in my opinion. I would suggest to sell the following items instead: Advil, Tylenol, feminine products, and maybe lotion.It's a shame that this hotel's cleanliness isn't up to par. I can't imagine what the bedrooms and the other facilities in the hotel looks like. Hopefully they aren't filled with cigarette buds and etc. If a friend was to ask me which hotel they should stay at, Grand Hyatt New York certainly wouldn't be on top of my list or recommendation.",5,2,2

I travel often, and have stayed in Marriotts and Hiltons that were far better. I booked the King Grand room, which was a decent size but needed a serious make-over. The furniture was worn and damaged. The bathroom vanity looked like it was purchased at Target (no offense to Target, but disappointing for a Hyatt), and looked old. The room was relatively clean and the bed was comfortable, but could use some serious TLC -specifically the furniture and bathroom. Based on the convenient location and overall comfort, I do not regret staying here. However, I strongly doubt that I would stay again.",,,

The good thing is that this place is near grand central terminal and they allow uber drivers to stop and pick up the customers in the front. As for the actual hotel, the rooms are a bit on the smaller side, but the shower pressure is amazing and the TV screen is huge. I'd like there to have a coffee machine though and it would have been nice for the elevators to be more efficient.",1,1,1

Something I love about Hyatt hotels, they always leave bring you champaing and the chocoalte covered strawberries for special occasions.The room was cute and cozy. Our only complaint was that the maintenance technician didn't come up to fix our heater when it stopped working.

69,Natalie M.,"Houston, TX",0,78,67,1.0,9/24/2017,"This place is a mess!! Stayed here for my birthday because it was close to everything. Had late checkin (after 1am) and called them to see where I need to pull up for valet, but no one answered!! No one ever answers the phone there. There's lots of construction in front of their building so it's hard to get around there. Asked the receptionist for the valet guy name and he said he didn't know his name.. hmmm. You don't know you're fellow coworkers name. Sure, buddy. He gave us a room with 2 doubles when we paid for a king size bed! Had to go back downstairs to switch up for our king size bed, which took over 15 minutes and did not receive any apology. They have their electric wiring all messed up. When you turn setting for all lights to turn off, EVERYTHING turned off -- even the outlets! Ridiculous! Couldn't even charge my phone without having to put it in the bathroom. That was the only place where it didn't turn off. Maintenance came in and was useless. He couldn't do anything. They charged us $70 a damn night for valet and didn't allow us to come and go as we pleased. Only drop off once and pick up once. Paid nearly $800 for this reservation and I would NOT recommend this place. Night shift workers are not friendly. Rooms are old and outdated.

We got to the hotel and tried to check in and they said the room wasn't ready. It was 8pm, not sure how the room could still be not ready this late in the day. They gave us a better room (presidential suite) and I thought that would be it but nope, need to update my review again because it gets worse. Our original room had two beds, this has one which is problematic because I'm traveling with a coworker. Also there is no toilet paper or bathroom amenities, so I tell the person downstairs before I go to dinner. After I come back from dinner I find toilet paper on the dining room table of our suite next to a plastic bag of shampoo. They didn't even put it in the bathroom! At this point I'm not even upset because this is so bad its kinda funny. I also notice the bed they brought doesn't come with pillows or blankets so I call downstairs a third time. The front desk tells me the hotel is OUT OF BLANKETS and there is nothing they can do so I ask to speak to a manager. The manager offers me some extra bedsheets instead, and I ask him why he can't get a blanket from an empty room. Then  he says oh wait I can do that and says he'll be up with blankets in 15 minutes. I do get my blankets so now we have all the basic necessities we need in a hotel. But it did take three phone calls lol.

We had been informed that checking in early (if even possible) would incur an extra charge (but it did not). We were offered a king size bed upgrade at a charge much less than what we were informed of in an earlier phone call. It was a corner room, lovely view, quiet and comfortable. The hotel is connected to the Grand Central Station which made it conveniently locate. Check out is easily done on the the tv. Wake up service is also connected to the tv.

The only complaint I have is the beds are a bit too soft, but if you like soft beds, they are perfect. I also like that the Grand Central Terminal is right across the street and Times Square is only a few blocks away. There is no view of the street from the room window. All of the hotel staff are very nice and easy to talk to. You can also walk right outside the hotel and the staff will get a taxi for you. I will recommend this hotel for my friends.",,,

As I entered my room on the 27th floor I noticed outside the door a food tray I thought no big deal housekeeping will probably grab it on the way down cause my room was right across from the elevator , NOPE it sat there all night and was there when I checked out the next day . The room it self was nothing fancy with the excuse of the 50in T.V. MST hotel don't go that big so it was a nice touch plus when you turned it on there was a welcome greeting with my name on it! That was also a nice touch , the bed itself was comfortable enough BUT the pillows they were the worst ever I was happy I had my travel pillow or I would have been in so much pain , All in all not a bad stay if the pillows were better I would have gave them another star",,,
75,Clint P.,"Weymouth, MA",7,3,10,1.0,12/8/2017,I will start off with saying this is not what I expect from a  Hyatt. The staff are all very courteous and nice I would give them five stars. The hotel room was sub-standardly cleaned prior to our check inFor the deluxe king I expected a lot nicer  a lot cleaner experience and a smell less room  From the moment I enter the room i noticed there  was a funky smell of  musk .The  maintenance staff obviously does not take care of anything around here  the filter cost about 20 bucks they can't even change those. The shower doesn't drain properly if you take longer than a two-minute shower you will be standing in water up to your ankles.

76,Tofu L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,44,0,1.0,2/22/2018,"I would advise anyone who is cares about proper customer service and security to seek a different hotel. I was a guest at the hotel a month ago for several nights and as any guest might do, I felt comfortable to leave some small change around the room. I was planning to buy small gifts as souvenirs for friends at home with some cash I brought with me in Chinatown. I left some money out and when I returned I noticed that about half of it was missing. Immediately I notified the hotel security when I realized the money was gone. The security came and wrote out a report and told me that I should carry traveler's checks (hahaha who does that these days?) and that they would follow up the next day. Instead of following up I had to chase them down and ask what's going on. After a couple of weeks they eventually told me they weren't going to do anything about it because they said the housekeeper who kept going into my room has been with them for many years. They tried to assert that I may have given someone a guest key (I didn't!) and that there wasn't enough for them to do even as much as a minor compensation. I have been a guest at many hotels and I have left money and valuables out for a few hours without feeling disturbed however at the Grand Hyatt there is no sense of accountability or follow up. I think the hotel could have handled this matter in a professional manner which includes following up when they say they will instead of the guest asking what's going on. The money isn't important, the principle of the matter is and so is the assurance of safety as a guest of the hotel. I don't care if I don't get the money back, I care how a hotel decides to take care of its guests. If you value that as well, don't stay there.",1,1,

It consists of modern stylish seating indoors,  outdoor patio with decent views, great finger foods, this water dispensing machine that consists of sparkling water(blew me away), and of course some adult beverages.  I am not sure how it works for most guests but it would wise to pay the daily rate to have access to this section.

80,David H.,"Minneapolis, MN",120,68,15,3.0,6/20/2018,"I usually travel to NYC on business and have stayed in many nondescript Manhattan hotel rooms. They have run the gamut from horrible to decent to good. The Grand Hyatt New York is definitely one of the good ones. I brought the family out here for a long weekend before heading upstate to visit relatives. Check-in was very easy and they even had our rooms ready much earlier than we anticipated, which is always nice after a flight. Yes, it is an older property, but it has been well maintained updated with classy decor. Our two-queen-bed room has a lovely view of the rooftop of Grand Central Station. While it's on the small side by typical hotel standards, it's actually one of the roomier NYC hotel rooms I've experienced. The HUGE flat screen TV in the room is a nice amenity, and the workspaces are adequate. A little cramped with three of us in the room, but we're managing OK. We haven't experienced any noise or distractions, but the weekend is yet to come. Contrary to what other reviews have said, I don't think this place is a ""dump"" at all. I've stayed in far crappier hotels in Manhattan at this price point. So far, there's not a lot to dislike about the Grand Hyatt New York. UPDATE: finished our stay and it was great. A couple of issues, including poor cooling in the room and a lumpy ironing board, but there were many pluses that made up for these. All around a great choice for staying in Midtown.",2,,

84,Jeanette I.,"Great Neck, NY",0,29,8,1.0,7/31/2018,"This is a long story of what happened to my group of bachelorette ladies this past Saturday, July 28th. While The manager Gregory Castro did comp one of the 2 rooms we booked, gave us $150 off the main suite, and 2 amentity cards, I am very disappointed that we even got into this situation to begin with; a situation  that could have been easily avoided had there been proper hotel policies & customer communication in place, without having to ruin the beginning of our bachelorette party. We were here to celebrate one of my best friend's upcoming wedding and I wanted to throw her a nice bachelorette party. I asked for 2 connecting rooms through Suiteness, it was supposed to be 1 king bed in the main suite & 2 double beds, and I reconfirmed multiple times with Suiteness that it would be connecting rooms. I also phone called myself and asked the Hyatt front desk & operator multiple times if I could have alcohol delivered in glass bottles and was told repeatedly it was no issue as long as I had a reservation with the hotel. Grievances:1) Ultimately, I got my suite/2 rooms, but both were double beds (no king) and on separate floors. They were not connecting, we wanted connecting rooms since we were holding a bachelorette party. Suiteness said they called Sat, July 28th in the morning to ensure it was connecting rooms and was told it would be connecting. Suiteness said it was noted on my reservation to the hotel. 2) My alcohol delivery ultimately had to be redelivered TWICE because unfortunately Gregory misread my last name. But what I am upset with is not the name error but that I had previously called and was told repeatedly by the front desk & operator that glass alcohol could be delivered and accepted by the front desk. There should not be a discrepancy in hotel policy or what the front desk & operator explains to clients. Had I known this I would have picked up the alcohol myself and saved myself all the stress of dealing with nonstop repeated angry calls from MiniBar Delivery & the wine stores. My 2 delivery men ended up waiting over 30 mins each delivery attempt due to the confusion. I had deliveries coming from 2 vendors, so that was over 2 hours lost from the vendors in totality. The Hyatt front desk & operators need to be properly trained on alcohol delivery policy.3) We arrived 6:10pm on Sat, July 28th, but the rooms were not ready at all. But my masseuse was already in the lobby waiting to go up with us to the hotel suite. Imagine - I am the party planner and I have a group of women waiting in the lobby for over half an hour at the start of the bachelorette here and the masseuse is right next to us as well, all waiting for our suite. Gregory did go up to check on the room and scrambled to let us into the main suite living room only (bedroom was still unavailable due to cleaning) so that we wouldn't lose any more massage time (appointment is already runnng late). 4) Gregory explains later that the late check in was due to a globalist vip customer having left 4pm that day, hence our rooms were not available. Why was I not called ahead of time or alerted that my room was not ready due to a previous guest late check out? What if I arrived at 4pm? I did not get access to all of my rooms/bedrooms until approximately 8:30pm. And only after I embarrassingly threw an uncontrollable fit in front of Gregory after the failed 2nd delivery alcohol attempt due to poor hotel policy. This is outrageous and not what I expect from Hyatt. I thought Hyatt was a luxury brand with good customer service but unfortunately had I known these issues would arise I would have chosen a different hotel. Hyatt hotel policy should have either 1) called me ahead of time to notify of room unavailability, 2) switched my rooms to available rooms at an earlier time prior to guest check in/ ASAP rather than me (the guest & crew of bachelorette women) waiting for who knows when. Gregory gave me the final set of keys for the 2nd room only after I threw an uncontrollable public fit, I wonder had that not occurred when the final room would have been ready 3) or simply transferred us to another hotel that has availability to save us the stress.",,,

It couldn't have been larger than 8 square feet and it made a bathroom on an airplane seem spacious. The sink was so small and the commode was wedged into a corner where an 8 year old child weighing 45 pounds would feel cramped (needless to say to an average adult it was absolute intolerable and unacceptable). Guess we should have felt privileged that the executive lounge had a full size bathroom to use, as it was on the same floor, BUT ONLY DURING OPERATING HOURS. Look I get it they need to get more $$ per square foot out of a hotel room in Manhattan, but seriously the closet was almost twice as big as the bathroom. We travel a lot as a couple and I travel 200 nights a year for business. NYC represents a smaller portion of those nights but I'm 99.9% certain this hotel is off our list.

92,Chris C.,"Boston, MA",385,462,148,2.0,4/12/2017,"This should be called the ""Not very Grand Hyatt,"" I expected so much more, as most Grand Hyatt's are a lot more high end than this very standard, quite depressing convention-style hotel.I'll point out the good things first:- fantastic location attached to Grand Central Station (you don't have to go outside at all to get to the station) and steps from everything in mid-town- clean- decent bath products and water pressure- comfortable bedNow the terrible to annoying:- $3 per bag to store your bag after checkout. I have never experienced this in ALL my travels. Storing bags for guests is a part of doing business and charging for it is obscene.- Very hard to find the dedicated checkin, the sign is places at the far end of the check in desk, instead of the first side you approach from the enterance, so i completely missed it - The lobby is ugly,  cavernous,   with dated uncomfortable furniture  and an anything but welcoming feel, not to mention no power outlets for charging electronics- Our standard king was a very small room, even by NYC standards- The room had no coffee machine - this is first hotel I have ever stayed in without one! (I'm sure it's designed to drive you to spend money room service or lobby coffee.)- np minibar- the bathroom is very small, with only inches to squeeze in between the shower and vanity on the toilet, and a shelf above the sink that both blocked access to the taps, and my friend hit his head on several times.When we checked in, i asked about upgrades, since i had status with Hyatt, but was told nothing was available, but the clerk did look around on floor plans for a room with light. He literally said ""Oh, you want a room with light, eh?""On top of all that and all the other issues, it's a super ugly building with terrible views and no light.I would never stay here again and never recommend it to anyone.

96,Jacob H.,"San Gabriel, CA",998,549,522,3.0,8/2/2016,"The Grand Hyatt in New York was an ok stay. As a Diamond member got upgraded to a club floor level. My suite night awards didn't work because they were full. The proximity to grand central is convenient and it's just a short walk to Times Square. The biggest gripe I have with this hotel is the water in the shower takes forever to get hot. I would've expected something like that from a smaller chain but come on at a Hyatt? There were also strands of hair from the previous guest and I know they weren't mine because they were long and red. Haha.Breakfast at the club was pretty decent. Had a good mix and also the basic stuff like eggs, toast, etc. only thing I didn't see was cereal which is kind of odd. During 5pm they have the evenin service. I wasn't too thrilled that at check in they asked if I wanted points or drinks at the lounge and I figured I'd pick the drink. The drink is just beer and wine. I thought it was actual cocktails which was kind of disappointing. It also seemed like no one filled out the honor bar system forms. I thought that was kind of weird they would have an honor system. Seems like just a way for them to make people use their gifts for this instead of points. Udon West was pretty close and they opened late. Banana republic is next door so if you want to do shopping it's great. I was also bummed there wasn't a pool or a spa, but that's just me forgetting to check.",4,,

They did move us; however, the room they moved us to had not been properly cleaned prior to us going into it. The floor was dirty and the bathroom extremely dirty as well as paint chipping off the walls. And, it was still not the type of room we actually booked. It was also extremely loud; not from the NYC traffic but from other guest and staff - we could hear full conversations coming from rooms around us as well as the hallway. Additionally, my wife was frustrated because the only mirror in this ""deluxe"" room was the small square above the sink. The room was just dingy and not inviting, and even more unfortunate, the staff did not seem to really care. The location is fine but nothing spectacular. Too many great hotels to waste time and money here while in New York. We missed the mark on this one and will not be returning. We have had good experiences at other Grand Hyatt locations but this trip pretty much takes the hotel chain out of my ""we'll stay there"" column. Truly disappointing.",,,
102,Mandy D.,"Westminster, CO",0,24,8,2.0,1/10/2018,"Perhaps it's because I'm not an elite member at Hyatt, maybe all of their nice rooms are saved for their elite members. I do have platinum status and diamond status at two other major hotel chains, so I think I stay in a hotel enough to know what to expect. Especially when paying for a high end hotel. Since I was traveling to work weekly in New York, I figured I would go for a little bit of elite status at Hyatt. First, upon my arrival my room was not ready even though I requested an early check-in it was not ready until 3 PM. When I came to pick up my keys the gentleman at the front desk just handed me my keys, never even oriented me to where the elevators were, let alone what benefits and resources I could use at the hotel. Second, I requested a quiet room, and they put me in a room on the 18th floor overlooking 42nd St., and I heard sirens and emergency vehicles all night long.  Third, I ordered wine delivery (yes ordered wine delivery) because the cheap wine they sold for $50 a bottle in their ""market"" was not anything I wanted. I hoped to put it in my refrigerator to keep cool for the next few days and to my dismay, my fridge was unplugged. On closer examination the plug was broken off in the outlet, so I had no way to plug it in.  The fridge looked like it had been dropped out of the 18th floor window, all dinged up and missing shelves. Unbelievable. Fourth, the mattress once I was able to lie down was so old and worn in, I actually felt Springs in my back. I can honestly say I've never been in such a horrible mattress since maybe the early 1990s. My picture is hard to tell, but you can see the work body shape on each side of the bed. With the high room rates, you would think they could afford to replace worn mattresses. Fifth, the shower.... mold mold mold. And one of the bolts that hold the glass walls up was totally missing. The vanity was nasty dark faux wood, and the toilet looked like it needed some updating. Save your money or spend your money at another hotel. There are a lot of great hotels in New York.

Housekeeping knocked on our door twice before checkout and the clock was set 30minutes faster than The actual time so make sure you have an alternate source to keep time.

The bestie and I wanted to go to NYC for a couple of nights and just needed a safe, comfy place to crash for our mommy vacay. This fit the bill for us perfectly, but I'd never stay here with the kids and it wouldn't be ideal for those ladies who love putting on a sheet of make-up (not me) because there's no vanity. You've been warned ;) I should've taken pics of the room, but I completely spaced from being exhausted. The beds were comfy and there was enough space to walk around comfortably. In a place where sq footage is at a premium, I thought this hotel was priced fairly. The bedroom was nice, but the bathroom was horrid! They added a ledge above the sink in front of the mirror so if you're trying to wash your face, you have to do it sideways in order to avoid hitting your forehead on that dang ledge. Checking in and out of the hotel was quick which is a big plus. The service was equal to other Grand Hyatt's I've stayed in, but the elevators here took FOREVER at times which is obviously a big minus. There was some sort of cheerleading convention going on in the ballroom(?) when we stayed so that may have added to the congestion. If you're looking for a mid-town hotel, this one connects to Grand Central! You don't even have to walk outside to catch your train.

This happened around 9:00 PM on Thursday, September 21A friend was put up here on a business trip and we decided to meet for a drink at the bar before going out for the night. As I'm about to take the escalator upstairs to the lobby, a large security guard rudely yells ""Lady- you gotta show your room key. get over there"" and points to a roped off section. Seriously, did they hire the newly unemployed bouncers from Webster Hall to be their security staff? For $400/night, you'd think the staff would be a little more gracious. Regardless, I'm now standing in line waiting to explain that I just want to grab a drink at the bar. Two middle eastern business men are in front of me. The 2 security guards who I can only assume are still bitter from not making the NYPD class of 1997 begin berating the men telling them they're not allowed to bring friends and that they're watching them. ""This is OUR hotel, Remember that!"" Flustered, the 2 men show their room keys and go upstairs. I guess I had a confused/shocked look on my face because the security guard gets really defensive toward me saying that he's seen all kind of antics from ""the Indians"" and then repeats, ""this is OUR hotel!"" After explaining I have a friend who's staying and I'm meeting them at the bar, they lead me to an elevator. My friend said he was taking a quick shower, so I took a seat in the lobby. Within 5 minutes, one of the guards comes up to me, ""I thought you were meeting a friend in the bar, huh?!"" This was clearly his CSI momentI try to explain that my friend's upstairs and I wanted to wait for him to order a drink. He responds that there's no loitering allowed in the lobby. Isn't that the whole point of a hotel lobby? Anyway, this guy was getting pretty excited with all of his high and mighty power and I was so disgusted with the staff that I just got up and left. As I was leaving, I saw the wannabe Frank Columbo's screaming at more people. From a business POV, that seems like a pretty rough first impression to be stationed at the entrance. My friend was horrified when I told him and said he'll be asking his company to choose one of the other generic, over-priced midtown hotels for their staff next time.

116,Tay H.,"San Francisco, CA",70,273,64,2.0,11/10/2015,"I really wish Hyatt still operated out of the Hotel 48 Lex.....such sad news when that partnership ended in September.  Absent that Hyatt location, I've recently been staying at the Grand Hyatt.  Although the location is great for business people and vacationers (you don't even have to go outside to get on a subway!), the hotel leaves much to be desired.First things first - the exterior of this hotel is HIDEOUS.  The mirrored paneling is a holdover from when Donald Trump purchased the former hotel on the spot and chose to simply cover it with gaudy 1980's paneling versus restoring the stone exterior.  This hotel SHOULD match with the rest of Grand Central Terminal, but apparently the Hyatt hotel chain also didn't want to invest in making this not look like a god awful 1980's alien ship.The lobby is also pretty icky.  It's a massive cavern and, again, super duper 80's.  They do have a decent bar and snack shop, but it generally feels like a soulless corporate dungeon.  The rooms look nice at first, but once you've stayed here a few times as I have, you begin to realize that everything has been done on the cheap.Hyatt renovated this hotel over the course of the past two years, but they basically just swapped out the furniture to more modern styles and put up new wallpaper.  Apparently, when it came to the bathrooms, they REALLY decided to cut corners.  Instead of replacing the tubs, they simply reglazed them.  So, in every single room I've stayed in (about 3 or 4 in the past few months), the ""floors"" of the tubs are peeling and spotty and look absolutely appalling and filthy. The shower heads are also weak and the water is consistently lukewarm, regardless of the time of day that you shower.This hotel also uses DirecTV instead of cable, which consistently gets horrible reception (not surprising, since the rooms are in a big stone building covered in metal paneling).  I wasn't able to watch a single news station this morning without stuttering, static, and ultimately completely loss of signal.My other gripe about this hotel relates to the service.  The front desk is practically hostile and their policies are not at all user friendly.  First, they charge ridiculous fees if you have packages delivered here - MINIMUM $15.  I ship boxes to colleagues at 5 star hotels around the country quite regularly and have NEVER heard of a hotel charging a fee - and the Hyatt doesn't even bring the box to your room.  You have to go fetch it yourself....so what is the fee for???  Also, I once checked in late after a delayed flight....and they had GIVEN AWAY my room.  That's insane.  It was prepaid.  And they still charged me the original price for my ""no show"" room after putting me in a substandard double bed room.While I may stay here in the future because of the proximity to my office, there's really nothing impressive about this hotel and I'd prefer to just go back to the non-branded Hotel 48 Lex...",4,1,

125,Ashley N.,"Los Angeles, CA",275,15,0,2.0,11/10/2017,"My expectation of a Hyatt is, at the very least, that it be clean. This hotel did not even meet that basic expectation. The lobby of the hotel is large and nice, but it feels more like you're at a mall than a hotel. The front desk staff is nice and accommodating and were kind enough to upgrade us to a ""deluxe"" room. I appreciated the upgrade, but let me tell you, there was absolutely nothing deluxe about it. As soon as we opened the door to the room we were hit by a smell so offensive it almost knocked us over. It smelled like a wet sponge that had been sitting out for months. I immediately called downstairs and asked to be transferred to another room. They told me they would not be able to give me another deluxe room. Fine. We walked into the new room, a standard ""view"" room, and it was the size of a shoebox. I opened the door to the bathroom, which was so small I could barely turn my body, and was hit once again with the horrific smell. I thought it was the shower curtain and asked them to replace it, but even with the replacement the smell persisted. The shower, which is a shower/tub combo, was stained with black stuff on the bottom. The toilet had the kind of handle you see in a park bathroom that you don't want to touch with your hand. The doors to the bathroom and closet were old and disintegrating. The bedside table was covered in dust so thick that it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. I tried to stick it out and just stay in the hotel despite the dirty and decrepit conditions, but I just couldn't. I had to get out of there and ended up booking another hotel for the remainder of my stay. The manager of the hotel was nice and apologetic and didn't charge me a cancellation fee, which is why I have given two stars instead of one. But all in all, this place hardly deserves one star.

I called to asked for new pillows and linens.  I was delivered another set of stinky pillows and sheets.  The bathroom towels even had this odor.  I have never stayed in a hotel with a bed that stunk like this one.  The carpet wasn't vacuumed, and when I dropped my phone on the floor, some kind of crumb stuck under my finger nail when I picked it up.  Gross.  The bar had lousy service and they only served Pepsi products, which is offensive to me :) The in room fridge didn't work.  It was hot in the room despite 40 degree weather outside, and adjusting the thermostat did nothing.  We had to open the window and listen to sirens and honking all night.  Had we not been staying only 2 nights, we would have packed up and found another hotel.  It is a decent point from which to walk to some sightseeing and shopping.  I gave it 2 stars because we didn't see any rodents or bugs.  Also, the housekeeping people were very friendly.  All of this for $380 a night plus fees.",1,,

Especially from the customer service stance. We had an incident where a dresser and heavy lamp came crashing down on my 3 year old. We called the front desk right away and they sent up their manager. At first she stated she would come our entire stay. Then she went back down and when she returned, she said she could only comp one night. After I talked with her some more she only added $100 more. She should have been begging us to agree to a comp for an entire stay. Now I am looking into legal remedies especially since other hotel staff told me there have been issues with the dressers for years. Bottom line: DO NOT STAY HERE.

Went to the bar once at night. Drinks were strong so I guess they're worth the money. Room was very cute I really liked it. Decor was up to date very cozy with the little couch and table inside. Bed was comfy. It was really clean, no issue with that. My ONLY issue with the hotel are two things (which j took two stars off for). One: the bathroom tub was disgusting. I'm a HUGE bathroom clean freak. The paint was peeling everywhere, the drain was half hanging out and was stuck. The shower curtain didn't close all the way so water all over the floor. Ugh very dissatisfying. Needless to say their bathrooms need renovating. Two: noise. The walls are thin. You can hear when ppl talking as they walk by your room.

135,Anne O.,"Boston, MA",0,11,0,1.0,6/16/2018,"All right, this is the end of the line.  Over the past six years, I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt probably 25-30 times, as that is where the host of most of my NY trips books my stays (largely because it is convenient).  You would think that I might receive decent service as a result or that maybe at least one person on the staff would remember me.  But no, that was not to be.  More important, every single stay has entailed disappointment.  During my many stays, I have experienced broken shower hooks, substantial peeling wallpaper or flaking or water damaged drywall (bottom of bathroom doors are almost always warped from water damage, with chipped paint), missing toiletries, sheer rudeness from staff (such as when the Republican presidential candidates had an event there in 2015), nightstand alarm clocks unexpectedly going off in the wee hours, and fitness center equipment missing critical parts.  The HVAC system is abysmal - always blowing air but of no discernible temperature, regardless how you set the thermostat.  One time, when I checked in after midnight, I was sent to a room with no bed (they corrected the situation).  Another negative:  Unlike most hotel rewards programs, at this particular Hyatt you receive no credit in the Hyatt program if a third party is footing the bill for your room - despite the logic that the third party booked the room there in part because you *requested* they do so on account of your awards membership. The last straw was a few weeks ago, when I had to wait 10 minutes each day in the fitness center (6:15 am) for a cardio machine to become available.",,,

138,Sarah V.,"Chicago, IL",772,430,163,2.0,4/4/2016,"I'm adding my review on TripAdvisor to YelpThe story that all New York hotel rooms are no bigger than closet is a myth. It's the truth at the Grand Hyatt, but it's a myth to many other nice hotels in Midtown. I was in the Westin's rooms two blocks away, as well as have stayed at a number of other hotels in Midtown, and none were as small as the these rooms. While staying in our closet of a guest room, we were treated to a stained and blackened bath tub, too few towels without replenishment (even when we asked), and no coffee maker in the room. Our biggest issue with the Grand Hyatt was the smoke detector in our room, which only screamed it needed a new battery every 2 minutes from the hours of 2am-7am. The issue was resolved after TWO NIGHTS, and FIVE phone calls downstairs. I was hung up on twice, and transferred a record-breaking six times on my third call before I was able to speak to someone, who then did nothing. It wasn't until the second night when we asked to speak to the GM that someone finally came to fix it, though it took an hour.My husband and I were unable to sleep for two nights straight, and the hotel staff did not care in the least bit. We did not ask for anything from them for the inconvenience, and they did not offer anything. I advised my company's meeting planning department of my stay and they are now reevaluating if we renew our contract with this property when it expires. Our experience was that terrible.",12,4,5

145,Paige W.,"Towson, MD",0,12,1,1.0,2/1/2017,"My stay at the Grand Hyatt New York was abysmal. In fact, it was so terrible that I left a night early and didn't even stay in the room that I paid for.. When I arrived, check in was smooth and easy - because it was through a machine and not the staff.The first problem occurred when I needed to get a box from the mailroom. I called the hotel days before I arrived to ensure that they had my box and that they could hold it for me until my arrival, and was told that they absolutely could. I tried to call down to find the right place to pick it up (concierge, mailroom, etc.) and the phone didn't work. When I called down to the front desk I was transferred to the concierge, who asked where the box was. I obviously didn't know--because I don't work at the hotel--so they transferred me back to the operator. The phone line was fuzzy and I could barely make out what they were saying, but I heard that I was being transferred again. I waited for 2 minutes on a dead phone line before giving up and going downstairs to the desk to check on it myself. When I arrived at the front desk, there were 3 people working and only one party being helped. I stood behind them for a few minutes before anyone looked up and asked how they could help me. I explained the situation and she looked it up, but said they had no record of a package being delivered for me and that I would have to go down to the mailroom myself the next morning at 7:30 to see if they had the package. The package was crucial to my meetings the next day, so I didn't have a choice but to take the time to do that. The mailroom attendant was lovely and found and delivered the packages to my room for me immediately. He was the best part of my stay. That evening, I got into a sloppily made, uncomfortable bed. It felt like sheets had just been thrown on and not even tucked in--and the bed was lumpy and terribly uncomfortable. It took me an hour just to get comfortable enough to fall asleep, and then once I turned the TV off, I heard the jackhammering underneath my window. I waited for it to stop, but it didn't. When I called down to the front desk to inquire if the construction would go on all night, the man answered: ""I don't know. Probably. They do construction at night here in New York. Probably at least until 1:30."" He did not apologize for the inconvenience or even show that he cared at all that a jackhammer was keeping me awake. I eventually fell asleep, but woke up at 3:30AM because the air conditioning/heating made a loud popping noise every time it turned on and off, which was about every 2 minutes. I tried turning it down and up and nothing made it stop. I could not fall back asleep and resigned myself to waking up and starting my day. In total, I got 3 hours and 30 minutes of sleep during my first night at the Grand Hyatt--so I changed my train to leave that evening instead of staying the next night as well. I got more sleep on the 3-hour train ride home than I would have staying another night. I am appalled by the quality and service at the Grand Hyatt--I am a loyal Hyatt customer and stay at Hyatt often, and have never had such a terrible experience. I would much rather have stayed at the Midtown South location for half the price and gotten a decent night sleep and quality customer service. I have emailed them twice to discuss my visit and they never responded.",2,1,

I have been a gold passport member for many years and travel to many different Hyatt locations... This location has the worst management ever. Upon arrival our room was ionized and full of unbearable fumes. Once we complained of this we were then directed to a different room. I then subsequently made a reservation through their app for a deluxe 600 square-foot suite... Oh for about the same price that they had booked me in  the regular room. Once the reservation was made and a confirmation was received... they informed me that due to human error ...that there were no suite rooms available... then they subsequently canceled that reservation. While we were here my friend's wife was bitten by something in the bed... And it wasn't her husband..After charging 9000 points to upgrade to the Regency club ... We learned that they are now taking ""environmental"" issues very seriously... what does that mean you ask?... It means that they will no longer provide you with bottled water... if you want water... You must use the environmentally friendly plastic cups that they prepare for you with a nasty unsanitary lime thrown in it to make it look like you're at a spa. How is a solo cup and a lid biodegradable plastic? What a bunch of crap... This hotel is all about the bottom line. The hotel rooms are tired and unsanitary. I called several times to inquire about this... never received a response from anyone at the front desk .Don't waste your money or your points at this property.  Upon checkout I asked to speak with the manager to discuss my issues with the hotel....Sierra Wright... presented herself as the manager and she did nothing for us to accommodate our concerns.. she said that she would not give any adjustment or would not even apologize for the awful experience... my recommendation is to not stay at this hotel ...management does not care.",,,
147,Kristy C.,"Reno, NV",414,642,328,4.0,5/3/2015,"Check in on Yelp when you get here, you can get a free room upgrade if it's available. The Hyatt is in a great location, really conveniently located to Grand Central (if only we hadn't been arriving and leaving out of Penn), and numerous food, drink, tourist, and evening options. It's beautiful inside, but because of the number of people milling around lacks that sort of serene feeling I like to have when I arrive. There was a bit of a line for check-in, and our room wasn't ready yet (we arrived pretty early), but the staff were all friendly and as accommodating as they could be. When we came back, they moved our room around a bit so that we could check in without any further delay. For platinum members, they have a great perk of getting free water or coffee with a coupon they give you, and they were generous in giving us quite a few (especially considering a regular bottle of water is $2.50). The rooms are your standard Hyatt fair, but was actually pretty spacious considering it's in the middle of New York City. I do wish they had taken a bit of the space out of the room and added it to the bathroom, as that bathroom is *tiny.* Bed was super comfortable, and though we didn't have the maids do service, they offered to come back at a time of our choosing. The walls are pretty thin, though. Probably not earplugs thin, but you can definitely hear some of the goings-on outside your door and the vacuum going in the morning. Had a drink at the bar, and while most of the staff is friendly, one gentleman was just straight up rude. So, you win some you lose some.

Main event/dinner was with 300 persons on a mezzanine level. Unfortunately, they packed us in. The room was better suited for 150 to 200 persons not 300. It was challenging to stand up without hitting a chair. Exiting was a maze. Too many chairs per table, and too many tables in one area. Food servers were banging into the chairs. Then, the AC was not set properly, and it got very warm. This was a business suit with black tux optional affair. Right after dinner, attendees including me, left. As soon as you left the room, you felt the cool air. On a position note, the food was satisfactory.Overall, this is not what I expect from the Grand Hyatt in midtown Manhattan.

Close to Bryant Park, the public library and there is plenty of mass transit (subway options are in Grand Central), ubers and taxis. There are also a TON of restaurants in the basement of Grand Central (a Jrs and a Shake Shack!) and nice little shops. You literally never have to leave and go outside (but you are in the City so don't be crazy). The staff was extremely nice and the room was huge by NYC standards. It was very quiet and cozy. No view but it was ok - we got a great sleep every night. Definitely recommend.",1,,

The walls are paper thin so I can hear noises on all sides, including above me.The bathroom is no bigger than a powder room with a small standup shower.

Love the location as it is next to GCT and close to my office. As others have noted, the lobby is beautiful. Service was extremely friendly as well. Got a room off of Priceline but when I walked into my room, I had to admit that it really blew me away. It was huge for any city but gigantic for New York City standards. Wifi was very fast and it was extremely clean and modern. Not sure if I got upgraded due to my status or not. Price was a steal at $180 after taxes.

This hotel is right next to Grand Central Station on 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan...you can't find a more centralized spot for your New York adventure. You can walk to the UN and the theater district, and right at the hotel have access to all the trains to take you around the city. The hotel has been redone and redecorated many times, the last time just a few years ago. It is very trendy and modern. The rooms are pretty tiny, although they are clean and new...maybe this tiny size is just a Manhattan hotel thing. They barely had room to jam in a little sitting place with the two double beds. That said, it still works. It is nice and clean and updated. The hotel has many meeting rooms around and there are bunches of stores in Grand Central Station and right outside your door. Cleaning staff kept the room nice and tidy, but they never could figure out we had four people with two beds, and needed more than three towels and two glasses. They were also a bit stingy on the bathroom amenities - not providing new soap bars every day for example. On the day we left, all the check in computers were down so they could not show us our bill nor provide a receipt - they promised to e-mail a copy (still haven't received it). If you drive, valet parking a car is $65 per night with NO in-and-out privileges. There was only pay-by-day WIFI...you'd think with the prices they charge they could offer basic service gratis - after all even Starbucks does. Not the top pick, but certainly a good choice for location.",3,,1

In the morning we heard so much noise room was  near the elevator we checked in late so we should have been put in a quiet rm and  but house keeping was banging on our door very early even though we had a do not disturb sign on door they opened the door I had to yell just  a horrible stay. So now I am very upset called the manager who sounded like a child running this hotel she promised to send up coffee which she never did some one brought cups up with a pot no coffee so I called they said well send it up no one did...again  finally I called kitchen and a very kind lady did send it up room was not cheap and I did not expect to be treated this way. manager did not follow through. It appeared very young people running this hotel and not having any idea how to treat guests. I worked at hotels for years if a guest checks in late they probably  want to sleep don t put them near an elevator. Manager should have followed through we  will not be staying there again housekeeping should not be opening doors when there is a do not disturb sign on door.,,,

Now the bad part.  The staff is horrible.  Check-in person was annoying.  I was looking for the concierge and accidentally approached the limo booking lady, who was stationed next to the concierge.  Rather than politely directing me, she gave me a snooty stink face- really?  Then I find the concierge and he can barely give me a recommendation for a quick lunch place- huh?  Also, he was directionally challenged.  I guess they have very low standards when it comes to staff and customer service.  Also, the bathroom in the standard room is extremely small (I know, NY, but still...)  The bathroom in the suite is a more acceptable size.",7,1,1

It was a good thing I was staying alone, because there was no way I could close the bathroom door and function properly. That being said, the customer service was great. Checking in was a breeze, the concierge was very friendly. We had dessert at their cafe in the hotel, and the servers were all very nice (if not the most attentive).

For a hotel of this stature, next to grand central station, for hundreds of dollars a night, I expected a bit more. I had a king size room, which was fine, but just fine... The bed was comfy which is a plus, but there was just a shower (which took ages to heat up) and no bath. The room was very big, but the space was wasted. The aircon was very loud and not great at heating things up. The decor was shabby. Generally as I understand it, this place has some good rooms and some fine rooms.

The interior is in desperate need of a remodel. There was one available electrical outlet for everyone -- really?The biggest issue was the guest service. There were three of us in the room. Checkin knew that as did our cleaning person. Every day we were asking for extra towels and shampoo. When we finally received the shampoos 3 hours later, to our absolute disgust, the bottles they stuffed in a sandwich baggie were 1/3 to 1/2 full each. That's right, they took USED bottles from other people's showers to give to us. Can you say gross?Also, there was a horrible odor of stale urine coming from the toilet. This was to the point it made you gag.On our first night there, we brought some diet cokes up to the room. I went and got some ice to put in the bucket. To my shock, the ice melted overnight and was LEFT in the room, along with a half drank Coke in a glass, for the remaining 3 days. Are you kidding me?

Updated review","I've since been back to the Grand Hyatt New York, and all the same comments still apply. Over the course of 2 nights (with a late check out) I had to ask three times for room service trays to be taken away. Every time I walked the halls there was either trash or service items left outside rooms. It's clear that there isn't a culture of ""I see it and I remove it, even if it's not my job"" amongst the staff there.I'm also dropping the rating because of the attention to detail by housekeeping. Our room wasn't dusted before we arrived. Even worse, the toilet wasn't flushed before we arrived. Not something you want to see walking in to a room.Overall, it's still a great hotel. I just hope that the standards aren't slipping.",4,,

Free room upgrade if available. Let me say that again: free room upgrade if available. Naturally, I was skeptical that they wouldn't honour this. Thus, while speeding into the city I hatched a plan with my main squeeze. We were going to inquire if there was anything we could upgrade to, and then BOOM hit them with our phone screens telling them we got it for free. It turns out they are very nice and honour the offer often. We got moved to a higher floor with a view and a bigger room. The hotel itself is modern, shiny and has a lot of fountains. It's like entering a club before the dance party starts. Good amenities at a great location -- right at Grand Central so it's clean, great place to spread your wings from every morning in Manhattan.",7,1,1
