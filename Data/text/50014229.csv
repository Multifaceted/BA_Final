0,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,4.0,7/14/2018,"This location is great and there's plenty of tvs to watch the soccer games. The energy is great as there were a lot of passionate soccer fans cheering and intensely watching the game. The food is fairly good. I had the guacamole and chips and was happy. The seats are nice and clean and the bar is full of options. Overall, I would definitely return to watch more games.",1,,
1,Giselle C.,"New York, NY",497,42,75,1.0,10/28/2018,"Honestly didn't think I would ever post a 1 star review because most places don't deserve it. But this restaurant really disappointed me in every aspect. The venue itself has a very nice interior with lots of tvs, a beautiful bar, clean floors, and vaulted ceilings. I was initially confused at why there was so much space in between each table. The food looked decent as it was walking past us so we were excited. At first we really were interested in grabbing drink in the lounge area. This area was pretty nice. There were some curved booths with round tables that made for easy group conversations. We ended up deciding that we were going to eat at the restaurant in addition to drinks because the food looked decent and we were pretty hungry. The menu is mainly either salads or burgers. 3/4 of our group ordered burgers. They were the worst burgers any of us had ever had. This is why:1. Over toasted burger buns so they started crumbling and cracking when we took a bite. They were also cold so they had been sitting around for a while 2. Burgers were ordered either medium rare or medium. When we got them they were (not joking) cold, hard, well done, charred, hockey puck burger patties. Basically inedible. 3. Cheese on the burgers were still not melted and in the pristine square shape that they come in out of the package.4. Fries were soggy, cold, and over salted.Service- also bad. We waited 45 minutes for the waitress to come over and ask us what we wanted to order, and basically threw the plates and utensils at us for us to distribute ourselves through the table. Once we received the food we did not get a check up or any refills for waters. When we asked for the check there was absolutely no one to wave over to even as for it. Once we asked, it took another 25 minutes to receive the cards back to the table. Food and service were poor. Clearly, wouldn't be returning.",,1,
2,Nancy L.,"Bayside, NY",0,95,106,3.0,11/7/2018,"I met my husband for a lite dinner at those establishment on a Tuesday night. I selected it based on reviews on open table reviews and location. Establishment is aesthetically pleasing with high ceiling various types of seating. Its casual and you don't feel rushed which is nice in midtown. We started off with guacamole and chips, which was nice chips very extra crunchy and guacamole was tasty the onions weren't overpowering which was good. My husband had the fish tacos and I had the apple salad. Both dishes were good. The tacos weren't fishy and my salad was a perfectly balanced. The service was good and staff was friendly. It is a nice place to relax after work.",,,
3,Michael N.,"Manhattan, NY",341,78,156,4.0,10/12/2018,I've been here for party events and every time I come I have to have the Mac and Cheese  burger...its delicious sinful and a meal itself... Oh.. the outdoor patio looks amazing as well and looks better and better with every drink I have when I'm there ... Gotta check it out for drinks afterwork or visiting in the city.,1,,1
4,Jay K.,"New York, NY",31,174,139,4.0,8/15/2018,"I had dinner solo and I had such a great experience. They gave me a nice table where I had perfect views to watch the sport games on the TVs; they have many flat screen TVs all over the dining space and the bar area. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. She provided excellent service. This summer, I went with a friend to have a cocktail at their rooftop which was a pretty nice space, No sick views you'll see from here since it's just the second floor of the building, but the space is nicely laid out. It was really crowded; very corporate. My friend ordered the mac & cheese sticks which everyone was ordering. I ordered some citrus arugula salad; it was decent. Would I return? Hm.. I would, but only if I'm looking for a upscale sports bar or if I'm in the area. I don't know if I'd go to the rooftop, I'd rather dine downstairs thought. I enjoyed it a lot more the first time around.",1,,
5,Vane K.,"Ossining, NY",12,64,161,5.0,8/26/2018,"My sister-in-law and I came here, with no reservations, and were seated right away. We asked to be seated outside and the hostess gladly brought us to the terrace. She explains to us that since we are seated outside we must place orders with the bar, we were totally fine with that. I was excited to order a macaroni and cheese burger with macaroni and cheese fries and a flatbread pizza. We decided to order one of each and share. I am so glad we did because it was so much food and we did not get to finish it. The tab came out to a decent price for what we got and I highly recommend to get the Mac and cheese burger if you ever decide to stop and eat here!!!",,,1
6,VyVy V.,"Centreville, VA",161,339,444,4.0,3/14/2018,"I've been waiting to try this place for awhile because of their mac n cheese burger! At a hefty $20 for the burger with a side of fries, I would say the price is pretty steep but it was delicious though. My best friend and I split the meal and we were stuffed!The burger sits in between a huge mound of mac n cheese on top and a fried mac n cheese patty on the bottom. Cheese heaven! I definitely recommend trying it at least once.",,,2
7,Scarlette O.,"Manhattan, NY",58,130,510,1.0,5/5/2018,"Let's see... I have no words to even start this review ( we passed the phone around letting the ladies give their two cents.) We came here for a contracted Kentucky Derby party. As per our contract we were supposed to be a sectioned off area with a DJ. We were told that we are supposed to get mint juleps with our prearranged menu and instead got margaritas. So basically why did we sign a contract?We could have just walked in off the street andijiijjjjjijijjThe service was so slow and non-attentive.They sat us in the middle of the terrace even though we had a big group so everyone in the bar was all over our space and our table.The food came out cold so we had to return them and get new meals.

8,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",420,276,2655,2.0,11/6/2017,"My friend and I came here on a whim for dinner on a Sunday night after hearing about their mac n cheese burger. When we arrived, there were a bunch of people up front by the bar but we were able to get seated for food. The music was very, very loud, and hard to have a conversation over, but we stuck it out to try the mac n cheese burger.To start, we got the mac n cheese fries. They were pretty similar to mozzarella sticks and served with marinara sauce, nothing really special. We split an order of the mac n cheese burger as our entree. I'm pretty sure they forgot about our order because 30 minutes passed between our fries and our burger. We flagged down a server (not our original server) to check on it; she said she would check and then never came back to give us an update. So I then flagged down our original server, she went to check on it and came back with some strange reason about the timing of our order being in - I didn't really know what she was trying to say because it didn't make sense. She then came back a few minutes later with our burger and no further explanation or ""sorry for the wait"".The burger was disappointing - the mac n cheese was pretty flavorless and the burger was dry. Even the fries on the side were a little soggy and just not good.Overall, quite a disappointment and would not recommend.",5,,
9,Jenna T.,"Huntington, WV",108,67,2,4.0,11/4/2018,"We decided at the last minute to go to this place and have a late night dinner. The atmosphere was pretty cool, and they had several football games on TV. I had the Mac and cheese and even for a side item, it was plenty for me. Pretty good. My husband had the Mac and cheese burger and it was HUGE. Fries were good also. Only complaint I have is the service was pretty slow when refilling drinks and first coming to our table.",,,
10,Vanness B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",17,88,146,5.0,1/30/2018,"Came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend for dinner (not late; like 5pm). When you walk in, it's like a bar atmosphere. The bar is to your left and there are a bunch of small tables. The only thing i DIDNT like was the fact that we had to walk to the hostess and she just stared and asked if she can help us ... ummmm I'm here for dinner? Duh? Thankfully everything else made up for it. If you like 90s hip hop, you're going to LOVEEE the music here. It was very chill, a good volume, and the music was amazing. I was jamming from the moment I sat down to the moment we paid lol. Food: I ordered salmon with veggies and my boyfriend ordered the Mac and cheese burger. My salmon was the best and the veggies were delicious! I was very pleased; good portion, super flavorful, and the salmon was perfectly cooked. My boyfriends burger came with fries, a beef patty, Macaroni and cheese around the burger ANDDD and a macaroni and cheese PATTY! Mind blown. He enjoyed it. It's a pretty good size burger so prepare yourself. Anywho, I really liked this place. Oh! They also share a bathroom with the hotel next door which was random but not super weird. But the cool part is the women's restroom has free sanitary napkins and tampons. Maybe this isn't a big deal to everyone but it's pretty rare for me to see and I think it's always extremely considerate of an establishment to offer that free of charge for woken :).",,,
11,Denay W.,"New York, NY",308,226,736,3.0,11/27/2017,"I've come here a few times over the weekend and it's just not somewhere that I love. The staff is incredibly hit or miss in terms of being friendly. Some have just been so short with us that it's a bit ridiculous. On top of that, the most recent time I was here our waitress was almost nowhere to be found - so this made service incredibly slow. The Ainsworth can get incredibly packed depending on the day and it can be a little overwhelming, although the space is large and the crowd has room to fill out. It's large space includes a terrace space, which is actually super nice! It's also a good location for watching sports both inside or on the terrace because there are TVs everywhere.I have to say that the food is also pretty good. I got the lone star burger when I was last here and I was happy with it! It was perfectly cooked and the fries were crispy and delicious.",1,1,1
12,Carol L.,"New York, NY",729,392,1367,4.0,8/28/2018,"Came here to watch one of the NBA Finals games with a group of friends. The atmosphere was dark and rowdy as you'd expect a bar that's showing a basketball game to be, with prices reflecting the midtown location. We got a whole lot of things to share, but my friend and I personally split the mac and cheese fries, a pitcher of sangria and beef sliders. The mac and cheese fries were served piping hot, and were good. The sangria was surprisingly very wine heavy which we were delighted about. The sliders were forgotten for the longest time, and STILL forgotten after we reminded our waitress about them. Everyone else had finished eating already, and just sitting around waiting for our sliders to come out but when we went to tell the waitress to forget the sliders and just give us the check, she hurriedly said sorry they'd be out soon and were already in the making. Like what?? We were there for close to three hours which is ample time to get an order of sliders out, yet it took asking for the check to have the sliders come out. The sliders were just okay. Other than the slider mishap, we were happy with our experience here watching the game and enjoying the atmosphere. It helped that the Warriors won that game too...",1,,
13,Moshe H.,"New York, NY",66,121,99,4.0,4/26/2018,I came for lunch meeting. The vibe is casual yet still fancy enough to see clients for informal meeting.

For appetizers we had the shishito peppers - not spicy and excellent!For a sport bar-restaurant I really enjoyed it here.,2,,
14,Ellie J.,"San Francisco, CA",939,83,5,1.0,2/7/2018,"My girlfriend and I came in to have some wine and the bartender was extremely rude to us right of the bat, we asked for menus and she muttered under her breath that the wine menu was not up to date and did not offer friendly help in explaining wine menu available, offerings, pricing etc. We agreed on Pinots, and she served us up a pour and as very hostile and never friendly once. I felt as if i was inconveniencing her just ordering from her, I planned to get food but wanted to leave due to her behavior.  We got to talking and she came asking if we wanted another glass and we agreed, she then toped off out glass that was not empty (it had almost a half glass of wine each).  We then asked her if we were getting charged for a full glass when she snapped on us and was extremely rude, slamming the cabinets to get the wine, poring us more in our glass while storming around sighing and causing a scene. The wine was $15 a glass plus tax and tip and was a tiny pour to begin with, and adding insult to injury since she would not provide a menu or assistance we were unaware how much the wine was we ordered or if there were other options we could have preferred.We got our check and left but I was so disturbed by her behavior and lack of common manners, basic serving etiquette and toddler like behavior.",5,,1

I ordered the Mediterranean salad with steak. we came in at 11 AM right when the restaurant opens. After we've ordered our food it took a substantial amount of time for orders to arrive.  I asked for the steak to be medium when the food came the steak was well done I spoke with the waitress and she said that the chef will fix it. When she came back 15 minutes later half of the steak was medium rare and the other half was well done. I didn't eat the steak I just asked if she could just take it off Of our bill.,1,,

It was Monday around 4pm or so, hardly anyone was there, and most of the staff was just standing around and talking. I asked for a taste of the Zinfandel and the Cabernet Sauvignon by the glass. They were out of the Zin and only had the Cabernet, but they gave a taste of that.I waited and waited to order a glass, but the waitress/bartender never returned.

18,Bryan C.,"Hoboken, NJ",174,376,716,3.0,8/15/2017,"This might be a generous 3 and if rated based on value for dollar would be 2 for sure.  Even in nyc if going to have a streak for 40 dollars on the menu it better be steakhouse quality.  These were not as though they were huge I could get a huge steak growing up at sizzler or the ponderosa.   The biggest issue is ordered them medium.  I am willing to accept anything from medium rare to medium well as not an exact science and people definition changes.  I often find at steakhouses medium is usual medium rare especially if getting bone in cut. Both the filet and strip were well done and could have been served with ketchup to Trump and made him happy.The fries were big steak fries and almost too big.  The cauliflower app tasted like the hula hula salmon at Dave and Busters. I admit I have eaten at Dave and busters. Only things that salvaged place is beer list is good.  Service was okay and place is a nice big location.  I would have given lower rating also as bought a deal for this place and tried to call to make reservation and always got a voicemail full.  Made reservation on OpenTable but they had event going long so could not honor so needed to wait 30 minutes,  needed to catch a train out of Penn so could not do that.  They were good and honored deal after it expired.",1,,

23,Cara B.,"New York, NY",255,382,932,1.0,3/21/2017,"If I could give less than one star I would! Everything about this experience was HORRIBLE!!!My girlfriends and I chose this place because the reviews said the Mac and cheese burger was to die for. Well that is a huge LIE! We went for my friends birthday because she wanted to try the mac and cheese burger and I'm sorry we went because her burger was cooked incorrectly and came out COLD!!! I feel bad we even went there to celebrate because of the horrible food and service.So to start, our waitress was friendly and we could tell she was super busy. She took our drink and appetizer order and she brought out our drinks pretty quickly. We waited for our appetizer of fried broccoli but it didn't come out. When she came over to take our entree order we reminded her about the appetizer but it didn't come out. When our food finally came out only half the tables (party of 7) food was served. So we were a little irritated. We waited and 15 minutes later the rest of the tables food came out. so now by the time the other half of the tables food came out my side of the tables food was cold. (We didn't start eating because that is rude, especially since the bday girls burger wasn't out).The BEST part of this whole scenario is that when the rest of the food came out it was COLD and INCORRECT. Both mac and cheese burgers were cooked incorrectly. One not med-well and the other not med-rare and the Tre Colore salad with salmon had NO salmon!!!!Oh and by the way, we didn't receive our appetizer of fried broccoli until AFTER all our entrees were served. When we spoke with the manager the only thing he offered was to take ONE of the burgers off. He didn't even offer warm food or a dessert or a round of drinks. I was so appalled at the service from the manager and kitchen that I will never go back to this establishment.So beware because it is not worth the over priced food and drinks!",14,1,1
24,Allie O.,"Aberdeen Township, NJ",7,19,0,1.0,3/25/2018,Worst service and food was a disaster. Took probably about ten mins to a server to come over and then we Had a server name Jessica who was so rude and pretty much walked up and said do you know what to order. We ordered apps and entree all came out at the same except the Mac and cheese fries I ordered.  The burger I ordered was so pink and then I sent it back and never came back out and we were just disgusted by everything we wanted to get out of there and asked for the bill and she brought it over and then wouldn't take the burger off . the manager said since I sent it back and they we're making a new one they couldn't take it off. which I still never got at this point. Finally agreed to take it off. I will never go back there and they need some more training in customer service mac and cheese fries were okay,5,1,
25,Emily D.,"New York, NY",40,189,340,1.0,3/11/2017,"I went here with a group of 6 others girls for my friends birthday. I was excited to try the mac n cheese burger because of all the other reviews. The night started off nice. We were seated right when we all got there (and we had to add another person to our reservation at the last minute and it wasn't a problem at all). We had our drink orders taken shortly after being seated which is nice. I had the Roosevelt, which was really good and pretty strong, and the only reason why this review is getting one star. The drinks are a little pricey but its Manhattan so its expected.  After that the waitress took our dinner orders we mostly got burgers and a few other things. The ""flatbread"" isn't really flat just looks like Sicilian pizza cut up. We put an appetizer in a minute or two after our order because we forgot when ordering our entrees. It was one plate of fried broccoli so we didn't think it would be that big of a deal, but it ended up being the last thing that came out and when everyone was almost done with their meal so it was kind of pointless. The other thing was that our orders came out at all different times. The first round of burgers that came out didn't even have the fries with them yet?! so like why would you send out a meal if you don't have anything? My friend ordered a salad with salmon and they forgot the salmon a pretty vital part and stupid mistake so she had to send it back. Everyone meals eventually got corrected and me and my friend were still waiting on our mac n cheese burgers we ordered. After they eventually came out they were cold and not even cooked like we asked them to. Also I didn't even receive ketchup for my fries, we asked about receiving some and they never brought it out. Both the burgers were overcooked and well done. We eventually said something to the manager and he decided to take one burger off the check which didn't really do much at that point.Very disappointed in my overall experience and wouldn't give it a second chance if I had the opportunity.

29,Josh M.,"Brooklyn, NY",366,428,52,4.0,9/27/2017,This review is solely for the Sunday football experience.  I arrived midway through the first games on a very nice day and figured it would be a complete mess. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case.  There were plenty of seats upstairs on the outdoor patio and it was straight-balling.  Great to be out there watching all the late games on all the tvs they have out there...it was cool.,1,,
30,Alexis E.,"Raritan, NJ",5,67,224,3.0,3/4/2018,"My friend and I walked in on a windy Saturday afternoon in early March. We immediately were mesmerized by the burgers that were being eaten by a table of guys right by the door. We finally came to our senses and went to the hostess. I'd been worried about the fact that we didn't have a reservation, but that didn't seem to matter as the place was mostly empty. We were seated in a space between their front dining room and back dining room, which was strange as it was a weird mix of fancy wall paper and an excessive amount of TVs all playing the same basketball game. It was a super weird ambiance as the space was cute and modern and well decorated, but then jammed packed with tons of TVs. They really need to not pretend to be a sports bar because the prices,food, and decorations/furniture are not consistent with a sports bar. They should just own up to being a trendy awesome NYC restaurant. Not sure why they are trying to downgrade themselves with all the sports... Also it was incredibly irritating because they were blasting hardcore rap music REALLY loudly, to the point where my friend and I struggled to hear each other in the empty restaurant. And the waitress really really struggled to hear us. The music was not appropriate for daytime for sure, as it was not only really intense but also kind of inappropriate for younger patrons. I saw a family eating in the back dining room and I would have been really annoyed if I was the parents of the kids. (Also, the water tasted like it had been in a plastic water bottle in the sun for a week. Not sure if it was bad tap or what that situation was, but yikes it was a struggle to get down) Further, the staff was not very friendly, and did not check on us with any interest. I don't think any of them made eye contact with me once. And remember, it was practically empty so they really can't use being busy as an excuse. (Another weird service thing was that my friend payed for hers in cash, but they gave her the wrong change back. When she told our waitress that the change was off by over 10$ the waitress rolled her eyes and acted like my friend was being super annoying. The waitress didn't apologize, but instead blamed it on another staff member. Not cool.)At this point you are probably wondering why I gave 3 stars and not 1. Well, when I review on yelp I am very willing to forgive things like ambiance, service, and price if the food is good enough. And this food was good enough. I ordered the turkey burger but with a beef patty instead of a turkey patty (I know, I'm high maintenance. But guys the turkey burger had rosemary avocado aioli, a toasted red pepper, frisée, avocado, and whole wheat bun. I dare you to tell me that doesn't sound incredible.) Let me tell you, it was SO good. Seasoned perfectly, very flavorful. The toppings were all delicious, the avocado was super fresh and yummy. It came with French fries (which were perfect and crispy, and extremely well salted!), and a pickle (yum!). My friend ordered The Ainsworth burger which was a double patty with double American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and caramelized onions on a brioche bun. She ate the whole thing and said it was delicious. Overall, I'm not sure I would go back and I'm not sure I would recommend it. Though it was a really good burger, there are other good burger places that have better atmospheres. It's a shame that The Ainsworth can't just market itself as upscale, since that's exactly what it is when you strip away the sports TVs and the obnoxious, inappropriate, makes-your-eats-hurt-it's-so-loud rap music.  I would be more inclined to go to Black Tap where the staff was friendly and the ambiance more management and consistent, despite the constant crowds there. Still, the burgers were so good that I might be curious to see if other locations have their act together more.",1,1,1

I asked her if the kitchen was closing she said the complete place with and attitude and walks away. She comes back two mins later after we paid and asked why she wasn't tipped. I explained the customer service is horrible if the cook comes out I will tip him for the food which was great. She asked why I explained again. She said well I'm sorry you feel that way are you going to tip. We ended up feeling so uncomfortable we left. Horrible experience will not return,3,,

For entrees we got the burrata burger and the Mac n cheese burger. In my opinion I would go with the Mac n cheese burger. The bun is infused with fried Mac n cheese which gave the burger an extra cheesy flavor. Prices were good for food and drinks. Overall I would definitely go back again!",,,

Let's start with the drinks it was happy hour if I'm not mistaken it was $8 Wines and mix cocktail my friend got a jack and Coke which was really ice and Coke and I ordered a Kir Royale which was a straight up disgusting it's like no bartender in NYC knows what Kir or Kir Royal is. Anyways I was get the Mac and cheese burger, it's their signature so the really can't mess that up . That atmosphere is nice more like a bar/lounge feel,they play mostly 90s hip hop and r&b.

I'm not a Mac n cheese guy so I opted for the bang bang burger, which was so over the top that I opted to eat/dissect it with a knife and fork. The fried egg and bacon was delicious, as was the small panko crusted chicken cutlet. The beef patty was over cooked and the fries were tasty.

One of my friends who lives out here recommended this place so I thought to myself why not worst case I have a good time with not so good food or service. This was not the case definitely a lot slower since it is pretty Christmas Eve and everybody's on holiday with their families but either way the place was not full and the music was not that loud. Service was friendly Services fast drinks or drinks and end up getting them mac and cheese burger to my delight was very delicious fries were crispy and overall great service and great food.

The last I've heard, an Interim ID is legitimate, but whatever. We went our separate ways and continued to check out the venue. 0 stars for the bar being overpriced as hell. 2 drinks and an order of buffalo wings cost me over 50 dollars! I was confused by this until later when i was reviewing my receipt. There was a service charge of 7 dollars. I'm not exactly sure what for.

My friends and I have eaten and had drinks. Beer is reasonably priced $20 something for a pitcher. Food always comes out great. Go tos are wings, mac n cheese fries and of course the famous Mac n cheese burger. I have had phenomenal wait service and customer service when planning. It's a great location for watching sports. High top tables by the bar and a lounge area with smaller tables and couches. The 26th st location is great for bigger parties but this is the perfect place for viewing any type of game. Televisions everywhere! The happy hour during the week is great. 5-7 half priced beer, wine and house liquor. I would recommend any of my friends to go and I will most definitely be going back!",,,

Updated review","Food is okay. It's a little overpriced ($12 for crudites, AKA some sliced raw veggies with a little dip? Please), and reminded me of an expensive version of Applebee's. I tried the crispy artichokes, spinach and artichoke dip, and Shishito peppers for appetizers. The artichokes were fine but they were so smothered in sauce that it was hard to taste the actual artichoke. The dip was good but nothing too exciting. The peppers were my favorite - perfectly cooked and so easy to eat 100 of. For my entree, I split a chicken kale Caesar salad, truffle fries and the crudites. The fries were so disappointing - barely any truffle flavor. I will say the portions were large enough to share comfortably, but again, nothing tasted exceptional here. I would much rather wait in line for the incredible food at Cask down the block.",1,,
53,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",22,85,10,5.0,9/3/2017,"Went here on a Saturday at 3pm to watch some college football and grab some food. For the size of the venue and it being a weekend I was surprised at how understaffed and slow the service was. Getting menus and placing an order took around 45 minutes. The upstairs was closed off for a private event so I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that's the cause of the slow service. On to the food, AMAZING BURGERS!!! I consider myself to a be a mac n cheese connoisseur and this place did not disappoint. My boyfriend and I split the mac attack burger and requested the beef patty be swapped for turkey and upgraded our fries to truffle fries. We also ordered the shishito peppers to start. These two dishes more than filled us up (and delighted our tastebuds). The burger has hints of truffle in it, the patty was super juicy, and the mac was divine. The shishito peppers were also very well seasoned. 2 people, 2 dishes, 4 drinks~ $80 before tip, not bad. This place goes on my list of best burgers in NYC!",,,
54,Stefany W.,"Manhattan, NY",200,210,32,3.0,2/21/2017,"Came here for lunch last week with a few gals.  We got the lunch special which they didn't offer until we asked (kinda weird, tbh) which was $16 for half sized appetizer, half sized entree and a drink.  I ordered the panko chicken for the appetizer and the mac and cheese burger for my entree.  The panko chicken was just okay - one of them seemed like it came straight from a freezer or something because the chicken tasted a little weird.The mac and cheese burger was TO DIE for though.  We all ordered that and it was delicious.  Definitely glad that was a half sized portion otherwise we might not have finished it.  Probably the only thing that I was pleased with at this place.My gals got the veggie platter to start and the spinach and artichoke dip.  I don't think either of them were particularly in love with either apps though since they were both barely touched.The service was a bit slow even though there were only a few other parties besides us and it wasn't even that early - it was around 1pm.Might come back for the burger but that's it.",,,

61,Irene K.,"New York, NY",441,21,62,1.0,9/16/2017,"I am shocked at horrible my experience here was. I was invited to come enjoy a free open bar with friends through Instagram- I had posted a picture from a different Ainsworth location from a lunch with a friend and was invited to come visit the Midtown spot a few weeks later. First off, the bouncer would not let one of my friends in (he has a Tennessee ID) and admitted that he had never seen a Tennessee ID before. He was very rude and tried to brush us off, which I thought was just unacceptable considering The Ainsworth had invited me in the first place and my friends had gone through the trouble of meeting me there. The bouncer was unbelievably rude-- my friend literally pulled up his school registry that listed his legal birthday, a second ID from his place of residence, and the bouncer continued to brush him off as if he were a high schooler trying to sneak in. The bouncer didn't want to contact the manager and I had to ask several times. He actually had the nerve to tell me that the manager was busy in his office doing paperwork (which is just funny because later in the bar, I saw the manager walking through the venue several times, talking to the DJ and other staff members). The manager eventually came out, inspected my friend's ID, and finally let us all through. The bouncer did not apologize nor did the manager even try to defuse the situation. Despite the fact that I had literally asked to speak to the manager, he only spoke to the bouncer, asked to see my friend's ID, and then let us in.The entire ordeal made us more than 30 minutes late to what was supposed to be an hour long open bar- get better scanners if you're going to be that paranoid about IDs and teach your workers some customer service. The hostess was very kind and gave us our wristbands with the advice to quickly head to the bar in the back and get as many drinks as possible. Despite it being fairly empty, the bartenders were slow to serve and just not friendly at all. I understand it's an open bar so they're not expecting to make as much money but we made a point of tipping for every drink and they were still rude. The blond bartender in particular was very rude and made it very clear she did not want to serve us. Also, when I was invited to this and told I could invite friends, I was told that the open bar would include not only wine and beer but also mixed drink specials. When I asked about this, I was told that we could only get wine and beer which is fine but I would have appreciated being told beforehand. We relocated to a booth in the back to hang out since the open bar had expired. I made a point of going to the bar in the front to order drinks for my friends so I wouldn't have to interact with the rude blonde bartender and found that Nina was much more cordial than the blonde girl in the back. She was very friendly and helped us pick a beer for our friend as well as shots for the group. She made great drinks for us and we made a point of finding her for a second round.As great as Nina was, I can't believe I was invited to enjoy a comped open bar and ended up spending a ridiculous amount of money just to make up for the horrid experience for my friends. I hated that they'd basically wasted their time and money to come to what was a really awful experience. Nina was really great though- she should be in charge of all of the other bartenders. I'm annoyed that the staff's tips get split between everyone because only Nina gave us good service. All in all, a terrible experience. They offered to give me another free open bar next weekend to make up for it but there's no way I'm going to waste my friends' time or my money here again. It's a shame because my first experience at The Ainsworth for lunch was a pleasant one and now I'll never go back. I can't imagine that the service is ever truly that great if they were this inconsiderate to someone they'd literally reached out to invite to come. Please hire more professional bouncers and bartenders. I actually had a very good impression of The Ainsworth and now it just makes me upset to even think about how horribly wrong everything went when we went.",6,,
62,Christopher S.,"New York, NY",13,127,72,4.0,6/17/2017,"As a burger enthusiast, it was inevitable that I would eventually come across the highly touted mac and cheese burger from The Ainsworth. As such, I had no other option but to give it a try. While delicious, it is definitely a one-time thing. It is heavy - VERY heavy. I'd suggest clearing the schedule after such a meal, as you won't be moving very fast. In any event, definitely worth saying you have tried it!",,,
63,Amy G.,"Nyack, NY",176,148,154,4.0,6/4/2017,The appetizers were decent. I had The mac and cheese balls-they weren't over fried and the pancko crumbs added flavor to the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese alone would of been good! I got the small plate or artichoke in lemon and anolli sauce. The lemon taste was very distinct and enjoyable. Couldn't taste the anolli however. The service was very poor we were supposed to have a private room with a private bar tender. We had a cornered off section at the bar.

Mine was a little more bloody then I like it but I dealt with it because who knows how long it would have taken if sent back.

Unfortunately, he did not complete it BUT the Ainsworth staff made our entire (large) group very comfortable and the DJ actually played music to the mood of the eating competition. It was a fun atmosphere.I really do want to come back for their food. Their burgers look really good, and I want to try the smaller version of the mac & cheese burger.

They even have a DJ at night that plays modern music and has the whole place dancing in their seats! It was an unexpected surprise. The televisions all around the bar and good-quality - playing all the sports games for the watchers. The burgers here are to die for. I went here on a double date with my boyfriend and two of my friends. The two boys ordered the Mac N Cheese Burger. It may sound weird to some people, but trust me it was out of this world. The burgers are so flavorful, neat, and cooked to perfection. The mac and cheese was delicious. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and it was also delicious. It was real cooked chicken. It tasted so authentic and warm in my mouth. It was overall one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. My friend ordered the French Onion Burger. It looked great. I remember her telling me how much she loved it and how the cheese was melted to a perfection. They also give you fries and a pickle with your burger. It is well-portioned and tasty.

As I entered there was no hostess or anyone there to help direct me but I luckily found the stairs to go up to the terrace. There was a day party on the terrace. As I got up to the terrace I notice that it's pretty big and had plenty of room. There was a long bar on the left and some lounge chairs and tables along the right side as you enter. The plus side was that today was cloudy and some rain and there was huge umbrellas up to cover everyone! So the rain didn't stop the fun! There was also two huge flat screens on the wall towards the end. The atmosphere was great and it was nice and casual. The downside is that if you wanted to buy a drink on a debit card then it's a 40 dollar minimum!!!!!! So bring cash. I'm not sure if it's just for the particular day party but just in case! The service was good and quick which is great I was able to get my drink immediately. There was a lot of people which was great to have a good time! The music was ok. They do serve food but I did not order food during the visit. If it was a better day the terrace would be beautiful to just go and have a drink.

71,Tashera D.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,61,45,1.0,1/5/2018,I had reservations for a VIP table for 2 on NYE. When I arrived my table was not on the seating plan chart. The manager who took care of the issue decided to grab a table and place it in the middle of the dance floor leaving us surrounded by everyone who had general admission tix. This was not a problem for me until everyone decided to keep dropping their empty cups on my table. Eventually my phone was stolen from my table. This would not have been able to have even happened had we actually had been seated in a vip area which everyone else who reserved a table was. I called the venue and a manager checked the tapes but said he didn't see anyone take my phone. My phone was indeed stolen by a blonde woman wearing a silver sequin dress. She was the only person who got close enough to me to steal my phone. My phone was in front of me and in my possession the entire night until she came over to my table to ask a stupid question about my bottle service. After she asked and walked away my phone was gone and whilst searching for it she was nowhere to be found. The manager said his company isn't liable however they should be. This was an $1149 brand new iPhone X which i only had for 3 weeks. We paid $500 for a vip table which we did not get upon arrival.,3,,

The bartenders were nice for the most part and quick with getting your orders.The drinks were pricey I guess since it is NYC...using credit cards were a $40.00 minimum which really shouldn't happen, like your forcing drinks on people. (Just my personal opinion). The place was dark upon entering on the street level and there's a sign directing people upstairs for the terrace.

Burger was OK. Fresh fries & filled to the top shots . Good margarita pita bread and  the Chelsea cocktails were great !,,,
76,Jaclyn H.,"Danville, CA",48,21,271,2.0,2/12/2017,"12PM Sunday Brunch. We made reservations, but it definitely wasn't necessary. The place was empty. Service started off great...but went downhill from there. I ordered a breakfast burrito, to discover they ran out of bacon! Instead I substituted sausage. After a very LONG wait for our food...I was served the most BASIC breakfast burrito I have ever tasted. Eggs, Sausage and a flour tortilla. That's it. Accompanied by small plastic cups filled with sour cream, salsa and guacamole. At least the salsa added a little flavor.My cup of coffee and Mimosa were great...but I would have had a refill on both if our waitress wasn't non existent. There was even a long wait to get the bill! We were clearly finished eating and our drinks were completely empty. Hopefully they get it together...it's a beautiful location, but perhaps there was a reason why it was empty.",1,,

78,Steve B.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,10/5/2016,"I wanted to like this place.You cannot beat the location.But the staff is surly, obnoxious, and, at best, indifferent, and the food is remarkably substandard.The staff glares at you and gleefully walks away as you approach them, or turns their back on you. Once you engage them, they will, generally, smile. But then they go back to ignoring you.The food is so bad it is ludicrous.  I have had better waffles courtesy of Eggo, and the fried chicken was so awful as to be laughable.  Their fried chicken makes KFC seem like a matchless culinary delight. Seriously!!The sound system is quite good, and the rooftop bar is fun.I get the impression that this place is thronged after work because of Happy Hour, and because of the great location, literally across the street from the 33rd street stop on the downtown No. 6 train, and, of course, because of the sleazy, rip-off/thieves' den Hilton Garden Inn hotel next door.But if you are looking for a tasty meal and reasonably good service, this is not the place for you.Full disclosure:1. The steak and the bacon were actually pretty good. Eat those and you should be fine.2. The management refunded all of the food portion of my bills whenever I complained, without question.If you want to have a beer at the front bar, and that's it, this place is ok.  The staff is still unpleasant, but you don't have much skin in the game at that point. Otherwise, skip this joint.In Midtown you have far too many better options available. Why pay for sorry food and ridiculously inept service when you don't have to?",4,1,1
79,Angelina H.,"La Verne, CA",183,7,0,1.0,7/15/2017,Super expensive for poor service and bad food. My friends had to send back one order for being wrong and two other orders for being burnt. I ate half of my turkey burger but felt a little sick later on in the day. The drinks were really good but everything else was bad. The atmosphere was really cool. I just wish the service and food were better,1,,
80,Pete J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,2.0,5/12/2017,"I might not believe what I'm about to write had I not experienced it firsthand:I went here for after-work drinks and appetizers with coworkers. Seemed like an average midtown gastropub: not great, but not terrible.BUT! All that changed when we ordered the shishito peppers. For those unfamiliar, shishito peppers are often found at japanese restaurants, and are delicate, bite-sized peppers that land on the spiciness scale somewhere between zero and ""barely."" This gives context to the following discovery:The Ainsworth on 33rd Street is serving fresh roasted jalapeño peppers and calling them shishito peppers. I'm not sure if the kitchen staff and management are merely confused, outright deceptive, or just plain defiant, but these were massive, fresh jalapeños. These are not the milder, pickled variety one may encounter in Mexican cuisine or stadium nachos. These are fiery and unrelenting.When we repeatedly brought this to the server's attention, she was dismissive, and assumed we couldn't handle the heat, saying other customers had complained as well that it was a particularly spicy batch. She eventually comped the peppers, but I was still baffled.Everything else seemed fine, I guess. But def wouldn't recommend this place. Oh, and Budweiser in a bottle is eight dollars.",2,,
81,Brietta Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",131,534,312,3.0,10/16/2016,"I finally got to try this place for lunch and have been wanting to for a long time now. Their lunch special is great - you choose a starter, burger/sandwich, and soda for $15. I had the buffalo cauliflower which was too spicy for me (it was drenched in buffalo sauce and not breaded, which was unexpected) and the mac and cheese burger, which was super heavy with a heap of mac n cheese on top of a fried patty of mac n cheese as well as the regular patty. Though I didn't enjoy my picks that much, I'd definitely come back again to try their other options since I liked the hamburger patty itself and the decor is cute. It's a good spot for lunch with coworkers but make sure you make a reservation since it's popular during lunch time and fills up fast.",1,,
82,Christine K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,1.0,5/23/2018,"Terrible service! Let me start by saying that I work in the hospitality industry and understand if there are issues in the kitchen, a busy night, understaffing, etc. and I very seldom leave reviews like this, but our server, Dunkley had the most unpleasant attitude from the get-go. We ordered an appetizer, which never came, so luckily the manager stopped by our table and brought it out and it was terribly stale. Stay away from the chips and guacamole! (The manager removed this from the bill). Not once did our server,  Dunkley stop by to check on us/ask us about our food. It actually seemed as if we inconvenienced her anytime we asked for something (which was seldom, since she practically never checked in on us) and honestly it came across that she just does not want to be there and that we were a burden to her. It's such a shame, because I live in the building next door and used to bring in so many of my family and friends, but I have noticed that the service has really gone down hill and I no longer trust this restaurant and was so embarrassed when I came here tonight with my mom, who lives out of state. When we received the check, brought to us by another staff member, (as Dunkley had completely avoided us), the bill was incorrect and we were overcharged. Dunkley later came back (didn't apologize) but quickly muttered that the money will eventually be credited back on the card. Needless to say, we will not be coming back and we will also spread the word. Management, you really need to focus on customer service/retrain your staff or you will lose so many potential guests because of this disappointing service.",1,,
83,Dave P.,"Hopewell Junction, NY",17,67,18,2.0,12/11/2016,Came here to watch football.  They seem to think it's a club and played stale club music the entire time with sporadic switches to the Jets sounds. Most of the place was 40 something but the kept playing the music.  They sat a group of younger people next to us who they overserved and they got louder and drunker.The two stars are for our server who was a champ.  Without her it would have been one.,,,
84,C L.,"Tipp City, OH",0,46,20,2.0,4/18/2017,"Atmosphere is nice and cocktail list is full of choices (but wine options are limited). I've heard good things about the burgers and fries here but in all honesty, I've had better. It was ok, but cooked wrong for my friend (well done is way different than medium).

88,Pelin C.,"New York, NY",20,121,88,1.0,3/11/2017,"Saw the bad reviews but still wanted give a shot and it was a mistake. The waitress either burned her tongue or lost her ability to taste food for some reason. Everything she recommended were disaster. Maybe everything on the menu was disaster. So she recommended the pizza appetizer which tasted like ketchup on bread. Mac and cheese was literally the WORST mac and cheese ive ever eaten. No exaggeration. It tasted the ones they sell in duane reade but like 36 times worse. I ordered the steak and they brought it in a hot plate which was so stupid, after 30 minutes of me eating the food trying not to touch it i still burnt my arm and the waitress burned her hand while she tried to clean it up. Oh and ofcourse the steak was not good at all. It was dry and tasteless with no side sauce nothing. They were also out of a lot of beers. So in short; i do not recommend this place. I also hope the owner or manager whoever is reading the reviews. You have potential, camon do yourself a favor. It is not that hard to serve good food.",1,,
89,Luke T.,"Croydon, United Kingdom",3,9,0,2.0,1/1/2016,"Was really thinking I'd give this place a better review but in my opinion it needs a lot of work.We came in for dinner as it was associated with the hotel next door that we were staying in. It was a Friday evening, and New Years Day at that so most the well known venues in NYC were full to bursting and we were struggling to find somewhere to eat. The host greeted us in a friendly manner before taking us to a table. After a chat about where we were from (I guess our English accents gave that away) and a bit about what we were up to in NYC she told us that they were a bit short staffed and that she would try and take our order for us to save waiting. She did her best and we felt (although a little clumsy) she was really endearing and that we were being looked after. Sadly it went downhill from there. The food was ok, but even for New York prices was over-rated. Slightly limited choice restricts diners (realistically) to burgers and steaks with not much more variation other than that. I chose the French Onion burger and a side of Mac and Cheese. The burger was a fairly average burger with a strange pot of what looked like French Onion Soup - not sure why but I expected some sort of French Onion in the burger not a dipping sauce... And a watery one at that. That said the Mac and Cheese was fairly decent. We barely saw our server and when we wanted to pay the bill we had to get up and ask for it after waiting 15 minutes after finishing our food. On the table next to us there was some sort of disagreement going on between a party of diners and who I can only assume was the manager: the exact details were hard to hear (and actually none of my business so I was trying not to listen) but it was hard to miss comments like ""We're not paying for this"" and ""Did you hear what he just said about me?!"" from irate diners. It was awkward to say the least. Our server eventually took our cards which offered us hope that we could walk out, albeit a further 10 minutes until our cards reappeared.As an Englishman I tend to make a point of tipping for good service when I'm in the States, even though this may seem like an alien concept to us. I appreciate that to some servers tips are needed to pay the bills and that they work really hard to earn them. This was possibly the first time I genuinely considered not tipping, but my concience won over in the end and I gave a standard tip.As we left we got a friendly goodbye and well wishes for the rest of our vacation from the hostess who had greeted us so well. For this reason, and this reason alone she saved a 1 Star review and I bumped it up to a 2 purely for her efforts. However she was the only glimmer of light in what was a fairly poor show of service and I would not choose to come back here if I had a wider choice.Overall, nice decor in the venue is let down by average food and poor service. Whilst it has a lot of potential, this venue has a long way to go yet.",5,,
90,Raymond R.,"Little Falls, NJ",370,161,757,5.0,4/19/2016,"Awesome burgers! Really just came here because a couple online food blogs considered the mac & cheese burger a must try in NYC and even said that it may be one of the best burgers in Manhattan. I haven't tried all the burgers in the city, and I'm not sure if it would be a top five on my own burger list, but I can say that it was absolutely delicious and satisfied my every tastebud. Not only is the mac & cheese burger served with macaroni and cheese on top of the meat, but with a panko crusted mac & cheese patty below the meat too. My girlfriend's french onion burger was so so tasty too as it was completely smothered in gruyere and served with a french onion soup sauce on the side too. Besides the tasty burgers, I found the DJ playing all the right songs to get me in a party mood like Kanye West's new album mixed with some Drake and some electronic type of stuff too. I will say that there are some minor downsides: being that you cannot hear anything in here unless you are basically reading your friend or partner's lips (to be expected) and that the 17 dollar mixed drinks (same price as the ginormous burgers) were underwhelming and loaded loaded loaded with ice.",1,1,
91,Sue S.,"Newark, NJ",975,251,361,3.0,8/2/2016,"Not bad! Their burgers were reasonably price and delicious...but to a point.

We sat down and ordered drinks that came on time. We ordered food and then never saw our server or food for another hour and 15min. I had to go up to the hostess and remind them we were there- not a great look when entertaining business clients. The restaurant had forgotten about us because we were sat behind a wall.

The music, however, was very loud, so it was impossible to have a real conversation once the place became more packed. Honestly wished this was a club instead at that point. The cocktails here are $16 each, so definitely on the pricey end! I had the Ains Martini, their signature drink, and my goodness, it was way too bitter for me. I think it was the grapefruit flavoring that caused this unpleasantly bitter taste. I've never been a huge fan of grapefruit though, so perhaps others who do may find this drink much more delightful than I did.",3,,

It's the service that's really the clincher for me and what I experienced today was absolutely horrid. But first let's start this review on a positive note. I ordered the Hanger Steak Burger that came with fries and Buffalo wings. OKAY OKAY, The burger looked ill, I didn't eat it but the wings were quite tasty along with the fries. My friend ordered the spinach dip and the Mac & Cheese Burger.... The spinach dip was really good, it wasn't watery or cold... lol, 2 thumbs up went well with the chips that were NOT stale!!! KUDOS!!!!! The Mac & Cheese Burger looked like a Bully... the photos the people post are not exaggerating. It was good as well just needed a lil sauce.... Overall the food was pretty decent. NOW......... as far as the customer service.... JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZUS....Our waitress Sindi (her name) was EXTREMELY INATTENTIVE. We were both unable to grasp her attention so we asked the roaming buss boy for blue cheese and also requested that he get Sindi's attention so that we could possibly order something to drink. The girl didn't even take our drink order. So now we are sitting at the table with dry throats. OF COURSE there is tap water but NOOOOOOOOOOOOO, we don't drink that. SHIT the option for bottled water wasn't even an option. Okay fine water after 10 minutes of waiting for blue cheese of course the wings are now cold. I've placed my napkin on the table and the buss boy rushes over to grab my serving tray. I looked at him like he had lost all of his damn mind. Why would you attempt to take someones food without ASKING if the patron is DONE. Sindi still hasn't made an appearance and by this time we are just absolutely ready to leave the establishment. Wishing we had another wait staff. Sindi comes after the buss boy gives us our cartons to pack the food left for the cold to feast on. We then ask for drinks. She comes 8 minutes later and then we requested our cheque. UGH guys, this is a pretty good place just don't have Sindi as your waitress. IMO...",1,,

124,Jessica M.,"Stratford, CT",0,30,23,1.0,8/10/2016,Horrible service waited an hour for 4 steaks. When we asked the waitress about our order we were told 3 minutes waited another 10. Don't think I will ever be visiting this place again. By the way there was not a lot of people so they can not blame it on being busy. I wouldn't even give a star but since I have to I give it 1 star. Skirt steak over chorizo was over seasoned home fries 4 slices of season and grounded over seasoned chorizo. Bad service. Bad food.,3,,

This is my firstv yelp and it's in my phone so please excuse the typis, etc. The service upstairs was TERRIBLE. We spent 5 hours there, serving ourselves, but the waitress arbitrarily decided the bar was closed. After spending $400 there. While she continued to serve others. Will never come back.",2,,

127,Kauanny Z.,"Port Chester, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/3/2015,"My friends and I bought tickets from joonbug for Halloween this year and got totally ripped off from them and Anisworth. They did not communicate with each other at all. Joonbug was offering a vip ticket which came with an open bar for an hour and the terrace outside and earlier entrance then the normal admissions ticket. Anisworth had no idea of these events and claimed there was no open bar and the terrace outside was under construction. I even called Anisworth a couple of days earlier to make sure I understood everything and I spoke to a lady who was the events coordinator and she said there was an open bar, the terrace and even a DJ with room to dance. But there was nothing there we had specifically paid for extra. We complained that night but it got no where, not even a refund. We just left and went to a different bar. Never going back there again. They need to learn how to communicate and treat their customers with more respect instead of ripping people off.",7,,
128,Elissa F.,"Stuyvesant Town, Manhattan, NY",12,4,0,1.0,10/9/2015,"Worst service from start to finish. I was extremely excited to check out the midtown location near my work because I really like the other two ainsworth bars in the city. As soon as my group sat down by the bar, we were greeted by the bartender with an attitude. Suprising that the bartenders don't understand that they are in customer service. They shared that they offered a happy hour. I asked for a glass of white wine assuming that she understood the implication that I wanted the wine off of the happy hour menu. You know what they say about people who assume...bill comes at end of the night she was serving me $15 for each glass of wine. Granted that's not an astronomical amount in Manhattan but I felt like she had misrepresented it as she had just mentioned the happy hour before serving the wines. My friend was charged $6 a glass.   We were a group of 8 and decided to order some food to pick on. I saw sliders being delivered to another table which prompted me to order them and a few other finger foods. The bartender asked me what kind I wanted and she named a few types and I picked three (clearly implying that sliders were on the menu).  She delivered three full sized burgers each with a side of fries (we ordered our own side of fries!). I asked what happened to the sliders and they said they don't serve sliders. They said they only serve sliders to large parties for catering. Strange that I didn't find that out until after they delivered to the table. We asked for them to take it back and they were extremely annoyed. In all honesty, were a group of 8 people at the bar, who would assume we'd want to eat three large burgers?? Side note we also ordered crudite and hummus and were served exactly 3 pieces of brocolli 3 pieces of cauliflower and 3 pieces of carrot. Please ainsworth, lower the portion size I'm worried I may fill up on crudite.  Not impressed. I'll choose the other ainsworth locations going forward.  This place AINS worth it...",9,4,
129,Jude S.,"New York, NY",0,18,0,2.0,11/24/2015,"I went in their with some friends because they convinced me that the food was great for the price. Originally you were able to get a starter and main sandwich and drink for $18 bucks lunch special and you were given good portions and a good sized burger. I ordered the Panko chicken starter and the meat was dry, the fries were okay but I mean french fries are not rocket science. The cooks should definitely think about some refresher courses on cooking meat and making it juicy and soft. Now the price is almost the same but instead of a regular sized burger you get a slider and the starter is half the size of it's original version. The last time I went in I only went because I was going to split the lunch special with a friend since it was such a generous serving, instead I ended up blowing $20 bucks on a slider, small basket of fries with Panko nuggets and a lemonade. Luckily that's my last time goin' there.",4,,
