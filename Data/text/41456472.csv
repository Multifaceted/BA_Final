0,,9/1/2018,328,,"New York, NY",Louis T.,67,5.0,48,"First thoughts when passing by B Bar & Grill was, "" This place looks super attractive and I can imagine this place being popular in the Evening / Brunch. This is the second time I passed the restaurant on my way back up the block.  I came by to grab a quick lunch with one of my colleagues. He went to the side window where they served the same dishes and i ordered food from inside the restaurant. There were a few things that both sides were missing. The customer service was outstanding and although it was not too busy when I stopped by, each and server and manager were beyond helpful. Now, for the food.  The fish tacos were tasty and delicious and well cooked. I just got a burger but the burger was perfectly cooked to the way I asked for. I'll let my photos tell the story about how good the food was aside from the great presentation when you order a burger to go.I am most definitely going to come back during the evening for drink with my friends!",
1,,8/26/2018,0,,"New York, NY",Sabrina P.,10,4.0,14,Atmosphere was very chill. Drinks on the pricier side tbh. There seemed to be about 3 different bars within the place to get a drink which was nice so there wasn't a long wait for a drink- which weren't that strong but basic none the less. They closed down the one bar that had the DJ and playing okay music which was kinda a bummer (this was around 12 AM) and we were told to go into the other 2 rooms to continue on with the night. They did have a restaurant in one part as well which some people from our group ate tacos at and supposedly it was good. Good place,
2,,8/14/2018,195,,"Manhattan, KS",Madison H.,33,4.0,112,"B Bar is a great, trendy bar in a good location in New York City. I haven't eaten any food there, but the drinks are good and it is always busy with young people on weekend nights. It's expensive, but then again, so is everywhere in NYC. B Bar also has a great outdoor patio with lots of space to enjoy the summer weather. If you're looking for a relatively low-key bar to hang with friends or meet new people, check out B Bar. It does get very crowded sometimes, but is a fun place to hang out and drink.",

The restaurant is incredibly spacious which is a sight for sore eyes here in the city - especially in East Village. The menu was priced very, very well. I ordered Eggs Benedict for $13 and the other 2 in my group both ordered the Huevos Rancheros ($15). Most Eggs Benedict in the city for Sunday brunch is always at least $20. This came with a side of delicious home fries so I was very pleased! Everything was cooked nicely and presented well. I also got a nice large iced coffee with milk for $3, a decent price as well.This place has its days, and I've always wondered about it. I have passed this place numerous times on my way to class and now I'm finally able to see what all the hype is about. It's awesome! Our waiter was really sweet and attentive as well, and the hostess sat me before my entire party had arrived (which many places in the city don't typically do, grr).I will definitely be back and look forward to sitting outside next time!",

I actually didn't go inside the restaurant at all....they have this gated pavilion type seating and I sat by the blue gate. The whole green and blue was so picturesque. It drizzled a bit while I was there but the heavy tree leaves caught most of the water. The food and drinks were obviously great too...but somehow the scenery was most memorable.,
6,,8/4/2018,361,,"New York, NY",Drew L.,87,1.0,59,"B bar is an intern bar. As an intern I was happy to come here and dance. So we came early and got drinks and food. The cavetelli was good and the tuna tartar was alright. The drinks are watered down. But the reason for this review being so low is that we had. A terrible experience with the woman in the women's bathroom. In the middle of our dinner and drinks, we spilled a drink at our table and went to the bathroom to get the sticky margarita off of our legs. The minute we entered, the women sitting in the bathroom refused to let us get toilet paper (since there were no paper towels) to wipe the sticky frozen margarita off of our legs. We tried to tell her we had spilt a drink and we're just trying to get it off. She was immediately aggressive and started yelling at us and forced us out of the bathroom. It was completely ridiculous. We finished our meal and went to the dance area. The music is not very good. All together, wthe place is mediocre. I don't see myself coming back here.",1
7,18,2/10/2018,90,10,"Bronx, NY",Mercedes C.,5502,4.0,757,"B Bar has a buzz that we liked. It comes off as (somewhat) stylish but by the same token, it's not stuffy. Finished with a quick errand in the area and B came to mind. Still looks the same with some nice tweaks since the last time I was here ages ago. Place is huge. Really took me a bit to tackle all the nooks and crannies here. Nice 'Front Bar' as you enter, then you get a scope of B Bar's open dining space with lots of warm lighting and retro booths around. Liked this space a lot because it can (almost) come off as whatever you like. Can't give you any direction here, but hidden away, towards the front, the back or the side (pick one) of B Bar, is the 'Garden Bar' with a down to earth feel. Vintage photos of Lower East Side's Punk and Fashion heavy hitters make a bold statement like the ultra spunky Grace Jones, Keith Haring, Basquiat, Blondie- setting off their walls. Reasonable menu with nice combinations for all palates. My husband and I shared a Tuna Tartare with Avocado appetizer that was very tasty and hooked up with these Waffle Chips- not Fries (thank you Emily M. for correction) ;-). He went for the Steak Frites and said it was thin but for $21, his NY Strip was cooked to perfection. Would've enjoyed the Tuna even more so in my Niçoise, if it was done rare. I didn't mention any searing preferences as I thought B Bar just went with 'rare'- but also wished our server, could've asked. My Niçoise got a nice dressing of Balsamic and Olive Oil instead of their 'Red Wine Vinaigrette' that called for mustard- Thank you! Chocolate Molten Cake with Salted Caramel Ice Cream (my choice instead of Vanilla), was entirely scrumptious. Cocktails? Nice ingredients but weren't high quality. I liked B Bar's menu and honestly, it won't set you back. Hands down- our meals were decent, we just didn't count on weak cocktails. Food wise, B Bar hit the spot and wouldn't mind rolling through B Bar again. Let's just say, I'd sit by their Garden Bar next time- and compare notes.",20
8,,6/15/2018,381,,"New York, NY",Kiersten G.,139,1.0,183,"I've been here multiple times for the atmosphere and setting, but every time I leave beyond disappointed. The cocktails are horrible. I ordered a $13 drink and it came out with bottom of the barrel rum that tasted like pure rubbing alcohol. The food isn't much better. Order the basic food items with beer or wine and you will be fine, maybe. Just look up, enjoy the views and your company.",2
9,,6/14/2018,143,,"New York, NY",Laura K.,60,3.0,79,"This spot is a lot of fun on a nice day. The patio has couches and a glass ceiling to relax and enjoy the sun. Drinks were a little weak and over-priced, so maybe stick to their beer/wine list? I'd recommend it for the space and atmosphere but you may be able to find a spot that gives a little more bang for your buck. The service was decent. Our waitress was really sweet and funny, but her manager was incredibly unaccommodating when some other friends tried to join our group. I don't like to call out service usually, because everyone has bad days. But she was unreasonable and just plain rude. It didn't ruin our time but definitely tainted our experience",1

During the day it's an enclosed space with no roof and people eating. At night it's filled with people and music is blasting. Guys, I finally went on a random Saturday afternoon for brunch. The setting is beautiful. Trees, simple tables, lights strung up, it's really nice on a hot summer afternoon and you can order a refreshing rosé. I had three tacos. For $15, it's a bit much. Small corn tortilla tacos but the ingredients tasted fresh. Really delicious. The staff is very attentive. But the price? I'll go here if I want to impress someone or I want to treat myself.",1
15,,10/17/2018,0,,"Manhattan, PRINCE, NY",Alex S.,0,1.0,2,"I live in the neighborhood and decided to stop by b bar with some friends for drinks in the late afternoon. The initial waitress who helped us was friendly and said it was totally fine for us to just have drinks and sat us. Prior to seating, we also let her know that we would have an additional three friends join us shortly- she again said this was not a problem and told us we could have the empty table next to ours when they arrived. We waited awhile to order drinks (approximately 20 minutes later, with a different waiter) and when our other friends arrived, they sat at the table next to ours as we had discussed with the waitress. Cue the incredibly rude hostess who came over and said "" you guys can't just do that."" When we tried to explain that we had already talked to the waitress, she proceeded to laugh in our faces and say ""no you didn't"" and continued to argue and talk over us.Manager had no control of the situation and was not helpful AT ALL. So we paid for our drinks (having just received them and therefore, did not drink them) and left as we were so appalled by the behavior of the hostess. I've been to many restaurants in nyc, and can honestly say she was the rudest hostess I have ever encountered. Will definitely not be returning and do not recommend this place to anyone.",

Wait was very responsible since we didn't make reservations and it was a busy Saturday night. Our waiter was great; friendly, had a nice smile and helped me decide what to get for dinner. My group ordered mostly burgers and salad. Burgers were juicy. I ordered the Cobb salad, which was bland because of the dressing. Other people got the Mac and cheese and they said that was amazing. Overall the atmosphere was very different but cool because of it. It had different things all over. Go there and check it out.",1

Then I returned the cake and talked to her; told her you just categorize your costumer for $3 and pissed them off for nothing; your action is pretty cheap etc; never mind I'm mean you pay your Servers $11 per hour after tax and you still acting greedy for $3 cake serving; cheap woman and rude behavior; again we are talking about $3!

When we got here and presented our IDs to enter, one of the bouncers told me that I was being disrespectful for holding my ID up to present to him. Anyway, we went into the restaurant after he had those words to say to me. During the night I approached the manager and told him what happened. He had the audacity to say that his bouncer was right and that I was wrong. He said that I should not hold up my ID. He then said that he was sorry and that he would talk to his bouncer.  As I was walking out I glanced at the bouncer and I heard him say for me to go **** myself. Very unprofessional and rude.

First off, the unsmiling server was really unwelcoming. When asked if there were any specials, our question was met with a resounding ""No."". She was also unhelpful when asked for suggestions and seemed impatient to take our orders and move on. The restaurant was not very busy either. She also needed to blow her nose, as there was a ""bat in the bat cave"" which was grossly noticeable throughout dinner. Yuck. Then, we waited an appalling 20+ min for two cold appetizers to arrive. And while the appetizers were still on the table, another server arrived with our mains, which were silently taken back. We had to call ""Batty"" when we were ready for them, since she didn't even bother to check on us. No apologies made, either. We had to remind her that we didn't want those dishes if they'd been lying around. Our comment was met with a dumbstruck look. While the food was decent and drinks okay, the service was seriously appalling. Of course, this was reflected by the underwhelming tip we left.",1

However, three nights ago I went with a friend and she and I were both offended by the elderly woman sitting and handing out paper towels in the women's bathroom.  This is usually seen in old-time restaurants that are normally on the expensive side.  I spoke to the manager about this as it seemed totally inappropriate for this low key restaurant. I was told I was racist and get over it. The manager was aggressive and hostile.  I won't go back. Not because of the bathroom attendant but because of the way I was treated by the manager.",

Absolutely amazing vibes and location, with a beautiful indoors restaurant as well as a stunning outdoors area, like a roofless converted gas station. I was already sold by the lanterns hanging from the trees and the lively bar/lounge/restaurant situation, but our food came out and it was also fantastic. I had a basic margharita pizza, but it took me forever to decide on because everything on the menu looked so appealing, from the burgers to the appetizers to the drinks.The place was loud and lively on a Thursday night.

32,,5/2/2017,792,8,"New York, NY",Liz S.,1568,3.0,706,"I should know by now that when someone says, ""Let's go to B Bar!"" on a Friday night at 1 am that they have much more deeply impaired judgment than previously assumed.Wall-to-wall frat boys and sorority girls, $11 drinks, and a massive patio space. If you hit it on a summer night, you can catch the rare sight of Goldman and Citi interns transcending their slightly different pedigrees and prejudices to come together in glorious yuppie drunkenness.The one time I've ordered a drink it took at least 5 minutes of pushing through a very blonde line at the bar but at least my Long Island Iced Tea was strong enough that I have virtually no recollection of the walk back to my apartment. The space is surprisingly nice for how bad the crowd is, and it can be deceptively easy to grab seats with a small group.B Bar's biggest charm, however, is that the bathroom door is actually a portal directly to senior spring prom. Loud compliments about rompers (""it's so cute that I hate it""), flasks passed around, the muted sound of retching, and an indifferent bathroom attendant watching rich white girls behaving badly. Pat O'Brien's in New Orleans is a superior portal to prom as it functions on weeknights as well, but this will do in a pinch.Best for when you're past your limit and would rather feel superior to finance bros than get a drink or talk to your similarly drunk friends.",1

We asked what time they were reserved for and said we only wanted drinks and possible a couple of appetisers. The lady said there reserved for 5:15pm, and as it was 4pm, we could sit there for an hour.  As we went over to sit down, another lady approached shouting at us that we couldn't sit there. When we explained we were told we could, she replied ""Well I am the manager and the servers don't know anything and I'm saying you can't sit here"".

Afterwards, he asked to see other forms of identification. I willingly took out debit cards and my insurance information! This still was not enough. I stated, ""I'm of age. What is the issue?""

After a few minutes, a bartender begrudgingly offered that we wait some more where we were standing... to wait to be seated, or go outside to wait some more. In the spirit of needless waiting at a dead restaurant, we decided to wait outside and eventually were seated after walking through a crowd of staff who seemed to have nothing to do.

Updated review",73,,"Manhattan, NY",Anthony P.,44,3.0,66,"B bar is well located downtown on the East West Village divide. If there's one thing that comes to mind ,it's consistent. It straddles the restaurant bar theme nicely. Some special dishes may have truffle as an in style ingredient, though largely pub type foods and diner-esque seating. They do lunch, dinner, and feature brunch too. My rule here is keep it simple. Stick to the menu, don't over-reach. It's good food, great atmosphere.  An open airy feeling good for large groups too. Yet the bar section is intimate and has nice city lighting decor. And there's a fireplace when the weather is colder my go to is the fish n chips with malt vinegar or the variety tacos. Beer on tap or bottles depending on brands available. Conclusion, good, you're mileage may vary. I'm optimistic about this place. The prices are fair, the selection focused, the atmosphere open and airy or intimate and cozy at the booth or bar. Give it a whirl, B bar is grade A.",

This was a little suspicious, it looked like the saw the twenty dollar bill I had in my hand and was just trying to get extra tip.

The wait staff/bus boys were a sweet as can be. But the hostess and managers were DISGUSTING. After asking me to stop Juuling (outside seating) i immediately respected there wishes and but my pod down. The manager then aggressively asked me to ""put it away."" It was as if I was a child in 3rd grade. I then said please don't speak to me that way I already agreed to your request. She then called security and other management and proceeded to curse us out. I don't think the the staff at B Bar realize they are in customer service. I have never been cursed out and embarrassed by a staff like that in my life. Me and my friends never start trouble or get into these disputes. The owners of this place need to completely CLEAN HOUSE and hire completely new management because the culture of disrespect and lack of grace in dealing with minor everyday restaurant disputes is laughable. Also- waited 40-50 minutes for a table, while getting scolded for waiting by the hostess she herself told us to wait.- Took 45 minutes to take out order.- Asked for extra chairs and they agreed and took 20 minutes to bring them.

67,,8/13/2017,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Kara C.,0,1.0,4,"Last night, I met some friends for dinner and drinks here. I'd come once before and things were fine so I thought this would be a fun place because of its size and unique design. The food is fine, not special, but overpriced as most things are in that area (my sister hated the veggie burger, but their fish and chips are passable). It was my birthday, and my husband brought a cake for us (complete with our own utensils and plates) and the hostess said there'd be a $3 per person ""plating fee."" Though all of the materials belonged to us. I've been to many a birthday party in the city with cake and I'd never experienced this before. So that didn't rub me the right way. Also, the place is huge and there were tons of available tables, but as our party grew, they wouldn't move us because of large parties they said they had coming in. That I understood so eleven of us hovered around a table for six, but as time went by (a few hours), the place didn't fill up nor did the larger areas that they claimed were reserved. Not cool. I don't know if anyone else noticed other than I, so I didn't say anything because my guests seems to be having an OK time. This is also one of those places that uses a bathroom attendant in both the men's and women's bathrooms. I always find this practice wildly pretentious in general, but this place is not fancy or upscale by any stretch. Not to mention the fact that there are hand dryers in their bathrooms, which I prefer to use to paper towels, but felt uncomfortable doing with a woman pushing paper towels at me. Speaking of how un-fancy this place is, let's talk MICE. Early in the evening, I glanced up toward the celling and I thought I saw something running along a ledge. I wondered aloud if I'd imagined it, but then someone next to me said that I hadn't, because he saw it run up there from another part of the wall. A few hours later, one ran right past my foot under our table. I freaked out, but my friend next to me said that he'd been to this place many times and had seen lots of mice there so it was normal for them! WHAT?! Eventually, the staff made a deal with us so we paid less for the ""plating fee"" so we had our cake there. Except they took it back to the kitchen to cut it and we aren't convinced that they cut it all evenly. We never saw it again, so I'm pretty sure they charged a fee AND kept some cake for themselves.I don't ask for much when I want to have fun. But I like decent, honest service, some degree of comfort and no VERMIN!! My advice: stay away!!!",5

Updated review",106,,"New York, NY",Megan S.,117,1.0,182,"Thank god this place has good food or I couldn't imagine how they'd stayed open. This use to be one of my main spots but it's just gone down hill and last weekend confirmed it. Placed a reservation for a group of 12 over a month ago. You know, large group so I wanted to make sure it would be comfortable. We were there on time and the girl had an attitude saying we weren't coming in until 12:30 which was comical because I had a text from them confirming noon. When I saw the "" table "" we had I was livid. There wasn't enough room for 9 people much less 12. It was round tables outside. I didn't even order food because being the host I took the "" non seat"" you know the chair that had absolutely no table space. I asked to speak to the manager and she was horrible. She could not careless. And for the amount of money we spent that's disgusting and insulting. She was rude, dismissive and completely unwilling to make any changes to rectify their mistake. I can't comment on the food because I didn't eat because I would have had to have a plate on my lap. Horrible experience. I'll never be back and I'm going to warn everyone of this spot. So disappointing. In fact I'd love to speak to an owner about how their manager speaks to patrons. I will be calling this week. Horrible experience.",2

Portions are on the smaller side, so I'd recommend getting a few plates to share.B Bar is a little pricey and they don't have a happy hour, but it's a nice location, especially during the warmer months.",2

The music is usually pretty good for dancing and the DJs seem to know what they're doing. The prices for drinks aren't absolutely terrible, especially for that area. The problem is that it's usually full to bursting with the worst people in the world here. Way too many dudes in suits trying to impress (and piss off) people by shoving their way to the front of the bar and flashing cash, and yet the bartenders actually acquiesce and respond to these guys. Not only that, there's not really a semblance of crowd control, and people tend to gather in the hallways, usually causing a bottleneck to the bar or to the other sections of the place. As a result, it seems super packed, despite a substantial amount of space actually available in the other sections. The outdoor patio area is actually pretty cool for hanging out when the weather is nice, but is usually littered with drunk smokers, despite the multiple signs that say ""No Smoking."" No one from the staff seems to stop them from smoking though, so that's that. Way to stick to your guns, B Bar.Can I really fault a place for having terrible people patronize it? Yes, yes I can, because it's New York. There are a great deal of fun bars in the area that are still active and have better vibes.

While that was distressing enough, the reaction of the Manager was even more problematic. Altho he acknowledgedthey've had issues re: MICE in the past (see other recent reviews posted on Yelp) and retain an exterminator, he basically dismissed it as a ""New York thing"" and said there's not much they can do. Not a good answer. And if that is the case, at least offer guests a complimentary cup of coffee for the inconvenience of being chased away from your meal by a pack of MICE vs. an ""oh well..."" response. It's too bad because I've enjoyed going to B Bar for years -- but that won't be happening again any time soon.My advice: stay away until they fix the MICE problem...or BYOC [Bring Your Own Cat].",

Friday night did draw in a crowd around 11 pm but it was not uncomfortably packed and the crowd skewed mid-to-late twenties - perfect for us.The only things that kept it from being a 5 star experience: my boyfriend brought a few balloons -- two numbered silver metallic ones and four blue and green colored rubber ones that were immediately confiscated at the door. They weren't too large or tacky and he offered to hide them away in a corner in our reserved space but the host said they would have to stay in a closet while we were there because the owner thinks balloons detract from the decor.

Keep in mind I wasn't being belligerent, I already had a stamp, and he'd given me the all clear to re-enter a few moments ago. I understand part of a bouncer's job is to do crowd control, but I don't understand why violence in absence of belligerence on the part of either that guy nor myself is ever OK.I now have bruises all over my knees and hips.

Updated review",0,,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",JP P.,0,5.0,4,SO HERE I GO AGAIN ON MY OWWWNNN! - lol whitesnake joke. I just had to put pen to paper again about b bar. Walking down bowery yesterday with my two cousins and we wanted to grab some nice drinks before they flew back to Estonia and then in the corner of my eye I saw the answer - big bird. He sat us at a gorgeous outdoor table under the sun and before we knew it he had three stunning gin cocktails in front of us garnished with unusual yellow feathers. I can honestly say ive worryingly been drinking in new york for over 30 years now and I havent tasted crisper drinks than big birds. He also recommended the spicy chicken burger which my older cousin took down in around 2 minutes - satisfied to say the least. We grabbed the check and after a quick chest bump with big bird we were on our way. I absolutley love this place and will be returning with my Peruvian friends who are visiting in 3 years. If I could give this 6 stars I would.,

I cant help but feel for the server and be hyper aware of what this review could potentially mean for the server. However my meal at B-bar last night was so so so terrible it warrants attention from upper level management. We sat down at our table around 8:00pm. We were not greeted by any server for upwards of 20 minutes, after we placed our drink and appetizer order we had to wait another 20 minutes before we could ask for an additional glass for water and a dining glass. There were 4 of us, but the table was only made for 5 people. Our food came, no quality check from our own server for a another solid 20 minutes. We wanted to order another round of drinks and it was another 20 minutes until we found our server. We asked another server if she could help us, and rather than saying sure no problem she said, ""hold on let me get your server."" Good luck because we sure cant find her either. It was very apparent that we were all getting upset, and there was no management to be found to leverage the issue while we were still in the dining room. Then she came over and tried to tell me my card wouldn't work, she said she tried like 4 times. Which is very alarming and I am keeping a close eye on my credit card. The service was the worst I have experienced in a while. Where was management to help guide our beyond clueless and absent server Marissa?",1

When we eat amazing ramen for $15, it doesn't really feel unfairly pricey. Likewise, NYC has such a better non-restaurant food culture than most American cities that being well-fed is actually a cheaper venture here. But at B Bar & Grill, the food is typical in variety, neither marvelously nor terribly made, and costs more than you'd expect for how little it thrills you.Our group of 7 came for lunch on a damp, sunny Tuesday. Each of us got a sandwich-like thing (burgers, mostly) and a beer. Each of us paid $26. Our food was fine - all totally unnoteworthy. Eating vegetarian is not difficult, as they have veggie burgers, portobello burgers, salads, pizza, etc. Do I think that $26 can go a lot further in the area? Yes. On the plus side, service was polite and patient. Also, major props for letting us split the bill between a million cards.The best thing about B Bar & Grill is the huge space with tons of seating options: indoor booths, indoor tables, courtyard couches under a glass roof, outdoor cafe tables without a roof, etc. etc. etc. It could work for small and large groups alike. Maybe we were the exception; our large group sat awkwardly at two round cafe tables pushed together, beneath a tree with tightly bound boughs, which ensures that heavy branches don't drop and kill someone. This charming, precautionary tree occasionally deposited dead leaves and other detritus on our tables/food, but it was fine.Everything, really, was just fine.

This place isn't that great.I will say that as currently the DUKE of B Bar.I often bring friends here and find myself saying ""Yeah. The food is bad, the drinks are bad. BUT THE ATMOSPHERE IS AWESOME!!""This past August, I came once a week and tried the whole menu. I was NOT impressed. Not to mention it's overpriced for the mediocre food and service.The only thing that is pleasing FOOD wise is the breakfast menu, and the mint lemonade. (Though, ask for it to be made using non-sparkling water. The sparkling one was disgusting.)The alcoholic drinks are terrible! I don't know who they have behind the bar!Every single drink I had was too sour, or too spicy. It's a mess!!The waitress was nice enough to return them, but what we replaced it with was equally as terrible.The chicken I had was bland, and the pizza was lack luster. The veggie better was meh. Duck Tacos a tad repulsive.Once again, I don't know why exactly I keep coming back to B Bar.  I have a very special place in my heart for B Bar (FOR SOME REASON???). I won't be going here to deal my hunger.

My friend ordered a prosecco that arrived to her very flat and it tasted awful. We called the waitress over to ask for a new one explaining it was bad and the waitress condescendingly spits back with ""she doesn't like it"" then ""you mean she doesn't like it"". And then grabbed the glass out of my hand.After we had eaten our meals and each had our drinks my friends surprised me by bringing in a little Ben & Jerry's pint of ice cream with a candle in it as a birthday dessert. After singing happy birthday and blowing out the candle we asked for a spoon and an order of a few more drinks. The waitress came over and said she was no longer going to serve our table and that the ice cream was not allowed in the establishment. They started ignoring us and then slammed the check into the table. The manager gathered all of the other staff to the back of the room and were blatantly talking about us and staring. We were forced by not only her but also the terrible manager in a newsboy cap to pay immediately and leave. The service was so incredibly awful and the waitress and manager were both barbaric. Thank you for making my birthday dinner so awkwardly terrible and ruining my night!!!! I will tell everyone I know to never come here again as it was the worst service experience I've ever had.",14

This place literally stands for everything bad about New York City...so crowded that you can't walk, drinks are so expensive and mediocre, bartenders are rude and feel self-entitled...the list goes on. It took me ~15 minutes just to even get the bartender's attention only to be met with attitude. I paid $13 for probably a 6 oz jack and coke that was filled with 3/4 ice. Drinks were just ok, and it's really just a douchey overhyped place.",2

There wasn't a long line when we got there around 9pm when we walked in though it I was very crowded at the bar and we were able to order drinks. Two vodka sodas and rum a coke. The bartender quickly got us our drinks and that was awesome. There is a two drink minimum with CC which is typical but annoying if you are planning to go somewhere after a drink etc.We then went to look throughout the space and realized there was an outdoor space and another room. In the middle of the space there are small tables and I wanted to sit down and they said we can get our drinks and the bar and sit at the table with no table service which I thought was awesome as I hate standing at a crowded bar. They were also playing 80's music which was a nice touch and after midnight was more hip hop which is my favorite.I will definitely be coming back here for the vibes the music, this amazing space and beautiful people!",

The waiter was really distracted and indifferent. Same deal when the rest of my friends got there. He took forever and there the place was almost empty. They brought us a bottle of water with a fly trapped in it, which was stomach turning. Thankfully it was after we received our meal, which was really good. I ordered the tuna nicoise salad which was great. Each of us enjoyed our meals: Salmon salad, lamb burger and chicken sandwich. Food was great.

Everything was very delicious! Drinks were on the weaker side, but still pretty good. Was not a big fan of the spices on the pita, it felt very grainy and like sand.

Music is loud -but not to the point where you can't have a conversation- and they were playing the latest hits. My friend and I both liked our drinks, prices were very comparable to other bars in the area and NYC in general. I loved the outdoor patio, which is where we sat. When we got there around midnight, we managed to snag a table from a party that was leaving, but the place was pretty much packed. The only downside was they kick you out at 2:30, but maybe that's just on weeknights. Can't wait to go back!",

No problem getting to the bar. The ambiance is pretty great with cool outdoors lights hanging from the trees and canvas canopies. Lots of spots to sit.

We opted to sit outside and fight the windy weather.The pros:- Outdoor seating- Chicken Scramble brunch special was great, and so were the hashbrown cakes it came withThe cons:- Expensive for the quality and amount of food- They don't know how to make a Bloody Mary- Service is slow, we had 3 or 4 different waiters stop by the table over the course of the meal- The brunch special didn't come with toast?- It's unclear where the entrance to the bar is..Will not return, but regardless - it's a pretty neat one-time spot.",1

On the other side of the fireplace there is a setup of couches and tables where you can comfortably sit and enjoy a few drinks. Awesome!Now on to the food. My sister for a chicken sandwich with fries that she absolutely loved. I got the pancakes which I didn't realize had fruit in them (I thought they were buttermilk when I ordered them). I love this place but it gets 4 stars instead if 5 for the lack of service.

The outside seating was gorgeous! It was nicely decorated with lantern lighting and had real trees located inside the restaurant! The vibe was really nice at night and I loved the music.My boyfriend and I ordered the loaded fries and the calamari fritters. The food was just alright. The fries weren't what I expected. It just seemed they sprinkled a tiny bit of cheese and called it loaded. The calamari was okie.Three stars mostly because the environment was on point but their food was only mediocre.,1

I think the price reflects more the ambiance than originality or quality of food on the menu. Pretty typical bistro food. I had the tuna Niçoise salad and they did a decent job of searing the tuna. The dish I felt needed more flavor though. Also had a cocktail made with cachaca and passion fruit purée which was delicious. Spent a little over $30 for a little salad and a drink, so really felt like I was paying for the atmosphere. Service was alright but their system could be improved. I went with a party of 6 and they did run us around a bit before we were seated at where we ended up. Our server didn't come by our table enough but her coworkers were able to help us out. Overall, I'd say this is a place to go to for the ambiance, not really for the food. Don't think I'll be back since there are lots of places where great atmosphere and scrumptious food collide.",

My friend loves their burger (I'm vegetarian) and everyone likes all the various egg dishes, esp. the salmon scramble and the ""smashed eggs with avocado"". They improved an already good French toast by adding lemon ricotta and blueberry preserves - fantastic! Complimentary banana bread, as much as you want.

She said only orange tables were for people not getting dinner and we would need to order from the bar. We went to the garden bar, where the bar tender was just texting. After a minute or two he acknowledged us. We asked if there were any specials we should know about and he said very rudely - this place doesn't do happy hour. We ordered our drinks and before we could go to our table the hostess came by and informed us we couldn't sit at the tables and we had to sit at the outdoor couches in the garden bar. The place is empty and they refused us table service - twice! Also she waited until we ordered our full price drinks to tell us. We sat down at the couches and devised our exit strategy. While waiting we realize their were a few small shards of broken glass on the couch after one of our party grazed it and got a very tiny cut. We got the hostess closed out and the manager - I think Luis - apologized, At this point we realized the floor also had broken glass on it. No one offered to comp a drink or anything.

Mezze Plate: we shared this app of hummus, couscous, feta, and pita.  Quite good and generous portions of both couscous and hummus, but the downside was that there wasn't enough pita bread.  Portion is a bit weird. There was too much couscous and hummus for the two of us though we finished the pita bread.  (and if you think they increase the amount of pita bread, it's be too much everything for two. BUT. If it was a larger party, they'd definitely run out of pita).I got the Grilled Salmon Salad which had grape tomatoes, mixed greens and avocado!! I liked that they were generous with both the avocado and the salmon. It's a great big chunk and very moist, grilled just right.  It's quite a large salad, so it justifies the price.  However, I think they could tone down the dressing.",

Seems simple enough, right? Not at B Bar. So we walk in at around 4, there are about 5 other parties there so we're seated quickly. They give us menus, we both decide on lattes and put our menus down (the universal sign of being ready to order). And we wait for a waiter to come to the table...and wait...and wait...no one comes...I go to the restroom, come back no waiter. My bf goes to the restroom, comes back, still no waiter (are we being Punk'd?). After about 30 minutes of waiting, mind you, there are about 4 staff members huddled and having random conversations and serving other tables, we start to put our gloves and sweaters back on and THEN the waitress comes. She takes our order and doesn't hide the fact that she's not happy about getting a table that wouldn't be spending over $10. The lattes come in less than 5 minutes and they're good, nothing spectacular. Had she not been so visibly irate (and maybe even, I don't know, smiled or been a scotch personable), and had it not taken a half our just to get our orders taken, we would have tipped her like $5 just for getting a fucking latte.

What I experienced and was one of a dumbest thing I've ever heard a bartender say to someone who is ordering a drink that has ONLY three ingredients. Sugar cube & orange peel does not count. Take a guess what drink that was? Its really popular drink in NOLA. Shit is mind boggling. If it wasn't for the company, I would've bounced dumb quick.

He had to gently step over me to get out, lightly grazing his foot on the booth. He was kicked out immediately and aggressively. When he POLITELY tried to explain the situation to the staff, they become hostile. Our whole group had to leave. Are you kidding me? Will not be returning. God forbid I accidentally touch a piece of furniture.",3

It was time for treatyoself.to top it off, it was 70 degrees and the last week of October. In New York City. Like, what? It was almost November and warm enough to dine on a patio. I felt like I had stepped into another world when I was seated at a corner table on the patio. The wall behind me was lined with glowing orange lights and jack-o-lanterns. The trees above were strung with giant amber glowing honey-comb looking lanterns. I had no choice but to order a steak and a glass of Argentinian red wine. I really know how to wine and dine myself.",1

IT WAS MY WEDDING DAY and I had tried to contact management to organize a reservation in the garden several times and didn't hear back until a few days prior to the day to which they didn't respond to any of my questions and only said ok I'll make the reservation. THEN when my family and I arrived the day of for the reservation they hadn't the reservation and the garden was closed and when I asked to speak to management she (same person I emailed) didn't try to make up for it only ""something must have happened"" and then only tried to stick us In a corner somewhere inside!!! I have never in my life been so shocked with such an awful restaurant experience!!  We went elsewhere!! DO NOT EAT HERE!! Terrible customer service and overpriced for what you get!!!!",1

Food: Fish and Chips Drink: Manhattan Service: Young attentive waitress I work in the service industry and I observed the manager with long black hair, who seemed to be pregnant and drinking wine at the bar while yelling at the staff. I cannot tolerate that kind of behavior and wish I had not seen this. Her treatment of the staff prompted me to leave earlier than expected.  I asked our server her name for this review ..... Jennifer should not be working within this industry.",3
197,,5/13/2013,757,,"Princeton, NJ",Kevin M.,1561,3.0,900,"One of the first bars I ever went to in the city a long time ago. So it still holds that significance. That being said, it's a pretty basic NYC bar with a normal drink selection. However, the outside portion is pretty awesome and makes for a great place to have drinks in the warmer months. I'm not a sangria fan, but it's a crowd favorite here in the summer and on a hot day it isn't that bad.Not too much else to say about this place other than it's a staple in the bowery section of Manhattan and a guaranteed good time if you come with a group of friends. Other than that, nothing special as far as NYC bars go. Not a great drink selection other than the sangria and the alcohol basics.",

199,3,5/17/2014,4989,4,"Manhattan, NY",George M.,680,2.0,522,"One of the oldies but very goodies. B-Bar is the hangout stop that refuses to go away. And in doing so it becomes cooler with each passing decade. My first go around at B-Bar started in '97. That's right Millennials as in 1997 (you know the olden days).  Permit me to dispense with nostalgia and get right to it... Food 2S - come-on people you can do better than thatFood service 4S - the waiter was fantasticHost 2S - despite numerous coveted outdoor tables being available on the first great spring evening of there season the host made my party wait until we just stood by his station refusing to leave and taking turns asking him: is a table available yet? over and over and over and over again until he succumbed. We watched so may people refused to be seated. I counted four table that from the time we were seated (6PM) to the time we left (10PM) nobody was seated at those tables. So either the host is a moron or its a conspiracy with the bartender to stage a passive slowdown of the establishment--see below.Bar Service 1S - The pleasant but callous, dreadlocked, bartender established--or so it seems--a protocol on how to order drinks: 1. Step up to the bar and watch the bartender wipe a glass or two for about five minutes or until he acknowledges you. In lieu of the second glass wiping he may parade aimlessly back an forth behind the bar. If you dare start ordering drinks before he acknowledges you then there's an additional five minute penalty added to your wait. Here's an example: ""I'd like to please have glass of cabernet, a Heineken, and a rum and coke."" [bartender ignores me at this modestly attended bar. He walks up to the end of the bar where we were sitting with a rag and an empty glass in hand apparently re-polishing the glass]. I repeat the order, to which he in obvious great annoyance at my lack of respect for his process says: I""ll be with you in a minute or something along those lines. Another guest takes this opportunity to shout out his order and unbeknownst to him relegated himself to ordering purgatory. 3. Once the bartender acknowledges you order one drink at a time. If you ignore this rule the bartender will resume him protocol by asking you for the rest of the order which really just means that you should order the next drink and only the next drink. The Cabernet arrives. ""What else did you want?"" ""a Heineken and rum and coke"" I sheepishly respond.  The heineken arrives. That will be whatever bucks said the bartender. ""OK but I also want rum and coke."" The bartender without saying a word proceeds to make a rum and coke. etc, etc.While this was going on other frustrated ""guests"" walked out. I noticed they tried ordering a couple of times. SO if you take the bartenders action together with the host's action one can only conclude: 1. the owner only hires two-geared (slow and stop) morons. Not likely because I observed some polish in both staffers.  2. This is an intentional slow-down of the restaurant and bar because of some labor dispute; Or, 3. The owner is a moron and doesn't care about their business.  All I can say is that I and others in my party witnessed frustrated people after frustrated people walk-out. I love the space of the B-Bar and if there is any hope of it being around even longer I felt that the owners should be aware of what is happening in their establishment.",7
