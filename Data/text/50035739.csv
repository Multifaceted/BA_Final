0,Mark S.,"New York, NY",6,27,12,5.0,10/24/2018,"Finally, after several months of wanting to try this spot, I placed an order to go. Right away, the first thing which caught my attention was the excellent level of customer service.  The nice, young man whom acknowledged me was sincere and helpful.  He was patient and offered suggestions when I inquired about the menu.  This is such a gift to experience in the city when crew members actually engage with you and make eye contact.  I took his advice, as a newbie, and ordered the BEC Classic, which was scrumptious.  I was elated to discover they scrambled my eggs soft as per my request.  The brioche bun was savory and full of air.  The crispy bacon paired with the melted cheese made for the perfect marriage with the latter. What I found to be great about this item was it's lightness and unique presentation.  Such a far cry from other sandwiches I've consumed which can often be substandard and/or too heavy.   It wasn't enormous nor was it small.  This was the perfect size in my opinion.  Given how professional the staff is and how their product does taste, I will definitely come back and try the, ""Godmother.""",,,
1,Saul G.,"White Plains, NY",34,738,84,4.0,10/9/2018,"Your inner New Yorker may object - the bacon egg and cheese needs to be taken from a bodega or diner and should cost 2.25. The vaguely French sounding bec (Le Bec Fin anyone?) seems like a slap in the face. So you walk past, time after time, until you finally relent.There are a lot of choices - I went with a Monster -- sort of the meat lovers' version while La Portena had a veggie. About $30 for two sandwiches, with one beverage, tax and tip. The wait seems long - a lot of the orders are for delivery or pickup it seems. Drink my tasty Red Jacket Fiji apple juice while waiting - also free cold water on the bar. The sandwiches are excellent - they arrive on fresh ciabatta well assembled, cut neatly in half. The egg, a bit runny oozing. They are filling, wholesome, nicely seasoned. The Monster is enhanced with just a bit of their hot sauce. A bit pricey but quite delicious. Four stars. At a lower tariff would have considered five.",,,1
2,Jonah S.,"New York, NY",275,3,1,4.0,10/7/2018,"BEC is a nice cozy trendy shop that sells Bacon Egg and Cheese sandwiches. It's a bit pricey at around $10 per sandwich but the quality is great. Get the Classic for an all-around good sandwich. The brioche roll is very fluffy, sandwich is a bit oily but very flavorful. 7.5/10 a gooey masterpiece.",,,

So happy I finally decided to give it a try for a late brunch. Breakfast is up there with my all time favorite meals, and BEC definitely hit my craving spot on.There's a ton of interesting choices to choose from, but I went with the Chelsea Lo-Cal sandwich, trying to avoid too many cals, but hey, still probably a ton of cals. Pretty expensive, but to be expected, and because of this I unfortunately won't be back as often as I would like. Walked back to the office with my new BFF and as soon as I took the Chelsea Lo-Cal out of the bag, it was love at first sight. The multi-grain bread was perfectly crispy, even with the container-ed walk. The eggs were cooked great and runny and the yogurt sauce combined with the broccoli rabe, pesto, and peppers was out of this world. YUM.Besides being delicious, it was totally picture worthy. Lot of likes for this image, guys. I also ordered a side of the roasted potatoes because what is a breakfast sandwich without a side of potatoes? They were totally delicious and served with a sweet/spicy sauce that I wish I could put on everything.Will absolutely be back to try another option, and I am so eggscited.",6,4,9
4,Scott B.,"New York, NY",8,171,204,5.0,9/11/2018,"Ordered delivery so can't speak to the in-restaurant experience. Sandwiches were delivered quickly, and the order was accurate.I had the classic sandwich. Everything tasted fresh. The brioche was fluffy and had small pieces of cheese baked in.  While pretty basic in ingredients, that what made it good.I would try this place again based on the bread alone. You are paying more but, the people care and the food is fresh. The potatoes I received were mostly underdone though. Side hot sauce wasn't too hot and had a smooth texture, unlike some Sambal sauces.I added a star as BEC reached out to me about the potatoes. I appreciate that they care enough to reach out to me.",,,

Personally I've had the Classic and the Farmhouse. Both were exceptional, and I reckon a decision would depend on if you prefer brioche or cibatta.The prices are reasonable and they also have 5-dollar mimosas if you want to start the party early (or keep the party going). Keep in mind the interior is pretty small (maybe 20 or so seats total) so not ideal for a large group. Think more ""fast casual"" vibe.",,,
7,Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,274,1594,4.0,12/26/2017,"Actually found this place by accident as I was walking towards Chelsea Piers for a workout. BEC as aptly named serves the classic bacon, egg and cheese sandwich but dressed up for today's health conscious consumer. They have a whole menu that serves this classic breakfast meal in several innovative ways. I decided to go with their Godmother sandwich, which is an Italian twist on the BEC. It consists of 2 fried eggs over easy, with proscuitto, salami, mozzarella cheese and spinach on a ciabatta roll. It was pleasantly satisfying and also quite filling. I loved how the yolks ran over both sandwich halves. Almost had an Eggs Benedict feel.",11,4,7

10,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1523,1489,2.0,7/13/2017,"Came here for lunch on Thursday looking for a filling, yet relatively healthy meal. Straight forward menu and no line to speak of in the afternoon.Decided on the Chelsea Lo-Cal sandwich ($10ish) and a 16oz Orange Juice ($4ish). Sandwich contains two grilled eggs, turkey bacon, peppers, rabe, yogurt, and pesto sauce in between two slices of multi-grain toast. Although the bread is moderately toasted, the ingredients don't properly stay within the slices - a bunch of pesto/yogurt popped out after my first bite. Eggs are cooked well, and the yogurt is nice. Too much pesto made for an odd balance, bacon is a bit overcooked, and the crust on the bread was either burnt or it's taste just overwhelmed everything else. Didn't really enjoy the sandwich much, though the juice is indeed fresh.A little disappointed in my selection; possibly the steak options had better flavor. Considering the lack of crowd, would give it another go at some point.",4,,2

It's just ok.They've got a ton of sandwiches on the menu that sound amazing. I've been looking forward to this place for the longest time. Tried the Spaniard and the traditional. Both of them were just fine. Egg whites a bit undercooked for my taste. Rolls are really nice. Sandwich creativity is where it wins. The plus there is that everyone there is super friendly. Great neighborhood place to hang out in. I know a bunch of people complain about the price here, but don't let that deter you. Its in line with the neighborhood and the type of place it is. Definitely worth a try.Would I return? I won't be in a rush to do so, but would happily try it again when it's less busy.",1,,
12,Kayla W.,"Atlanta, GA",507,46,102,3.0,1/28/2018,"Limited seating inside for only 18-22 people at one time. Located in the meat packing and Chelsea area. Great scenery around the area to shop and look around. The manager was very nice and checked in with me while I ate. I ordered the Jr BEC sandwich. I thought the bread was very hard and my jaw in hurting from chewing. :/However, I notice the classic larger bec has brioche bun which I would think is softer. I hope. I found out about this place on a blog top 10 breakfast sandwich place for BEC. I am slightly disappointed. I know this isn't the best BEC in NYC. I give the sandwich a 7.8/10. Not bad but not super amazing . I don't think I will back considering the price and quailty aren't aligned .",1,,

Anyway, was walking down the street and saw BEC. Great find! My Farmhouse sandwich was really good and hit the spot. Loved the fig and ricotta with the eggs and bacon. My wife had the Farmhouse bowl with quinoa. Huge portion.  The amount of food delivery people was amazing to watch as we are our breakfast. Obviously, they do a gods business with the local folks who can't make it out of bed.",,,
14,Connie Q.,"New York, NY",2,3,1,5.0,10/3/2018,"I know this sounds strange but BEC has my favorite salad in the world. I don't know what kind of magic is in the broccoli, brussel salad but it's my jam. Add bacon and / or avo. So when I'm feeling  - I'll just get the salad with bacon. Sometimes when I'm feeling  I'll get the salad with the Jr Bec. I love all the sandwiches (the sausage one is my favorite) but that salad is amazing. It's so good that sometimes when I'm home I will pay the Uber eats delivery fee to get it (and I'm cheap AF so this is a big deal). Also I've been eating this salad for 3 yrs now and it hasn't declined in taste, volume or quality.",,,
15,Zach W.,"Baltimore, MD",40,162,251,4.0,10/29/2017,"BEC is one of those places I admire that just names itself after its best food. In a world where Milk Bar serves pastries, Shake Shack servers burgers, and Beechers Cheese is a bad example of this because it serves just all kinds of cheese, anyway, BEC serves bacon egg and cheese sandwiches, as they should. Now I know you (and I) were thinking that any old bodega can serve a BEC sandwich. And I know you (and I) were thinking that Bite on 22nd and 6th has an awesome breakfast sandwich for half the price. And I know you (and I) were thinking that it might not be worth it to get what amounts to a very standard meal. But you know what? We might be right, but we might be wrong, because these sandwiches added a bit of extra ""something"" to them that made them better. ""Something"" was bread covered in cheese and bacon. Yup, sign me up. Anyway, it's pretty good. Like 4 stars good. It definitely hits the spot if you're looking for a BEC sandwich, which I assume you are if you walk into a place literally called BEC. If not, rethink your life.",1,2,
16,Lauren A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",83,116,139,3.0,12/1/2017,"Delicious breakfast sandwich. I really like the classic. However, it's definitely pricey for the amount of food you get.

Updated review","This is the kind of place that makes NYC great. One minute you are on 8th Ave, the next minute you are transported to a quaint country kitchen. BEC has reimagined the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich In such a delicious way! I ordered the Farmhouse which came with spinach, ricotta, fig jam, and pancetta....all set on a perfectly toasted roll.  They also have fantastic coffee, salads, chocolate chip cookies and now wine and beer!Not to be missed. Get in line with the locals.",1,,
18,Annelise H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,42,3,5.0,10/23/2018,I traveling from LA and having such a hard time keeping KETO. I found BEC and I'm in love. They can make all their sandwiches into spinach bowls. It's a small place with basic breakfast menu. Portions are generous. They have lots of egg sandwiches that can be modified for KETO and low carb. Cold brew coffee isn't bad either. I'll be back.,,,
19,Steph G.,"Kips Bay, Manhattan, NY",282,87,22,3.0,1/24/2018,"This place has good, fast breakfast sandwiches. Fresh ingredients, made to order but nothing to go too out of your way for.

20,Mandee P.,"Manhattan, NY",180,123,186,5.0,8/30/2017,"While in the area, my husband and I passed this place by. BEC? So this place serves Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwiches all day? Umm--yeah! Later on when it was time to grab lunch, I figured I'd give this place a shot. I was curious about the ""elevated"" BECs.I ordered the Roundhouse and the Mammoth. My Husband and I had half of each. It was a bit pricey, coming at $23 (that's the most I ever spent on two bacon, egg, and cheeses in my life), but it was reasonable for the flavor experience. BEC is the backbone, but you also get things like sausage, avocado, etc. The sandwiches were filling and yummy! I would definitely go back.Tip: They have a decent (small) selection of beer if you want a brew with your BEC. I was excited to see they carried cans from Montauk Brewing Company. I'm a fan of their IPAs!",,,
21,Jessica D.,"New York, NY",4,130,0,4.0,2/8/2018,"I am the kind of person who thinks a well made bodega bacon egg and cheese is the highest expression of the form.  However, when I am trying to eat healthier, I turn to BEC for breakfast from time to time.  My standing order is two eggs with pancetta and kale in a bowl. The eggs are super fresh and perfectly cooked, the pancetta is salt and peppery.  They used to serve it over sauteed kale, which I preferred.  Today I got raw baby kale, which was fine.  My only gripe is with the price.  It genuinely hurts to pay $10 for this, and I can only justify the price every once in a while - feels gouge-y (which is why I dropped a star).  Service is friendly and the place is pleasant.",,,

The spinach, pesto, cheese and eggs taste amazing together (They also offer a gluten-free bread for all of their sandwiches).Roadhouse- Tasty and interesting combination of avocado and BBQ sauce.

23,Linda J.,"Noord, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",45,167,2892,5.0,8/15/2016,"Having lived in NYC for 15 years I've had my fair share of bacon egg and cheese sandwiches from the countless bodegas.  I moved away from NYC now three years ago and the first thing I wanted when I visited this summer was a BEC.  I read about BEC in the Chelsea neighborhood and was looking forward to trying it out with my husband and best friend.Food: We ordered the following three sandwiches:1) BEC Classic - Two eggs, applewood smoked bacon, New York State sharp cheddar cheese on and their signature bacon and cheese brioche bun.  DELICIOUS - So nice to have a gourmet BEC to start off with.  The brioche bun is a nice touch to a classic sandwich.2) Spicy Spaniard - Two eggs, Serrano ham, manchego cheese, pickled jalapeños, romaine, tomato compote on a Pugliese roll. - YUMMY! Who doesn't love Serrano ham, manchego cheese with pickled jalapeños?  This Spanish twist on the classic BEC seems like a no brainer! 3) Roadhouse - Two eggs, sweet Italian pork sausage, New York State sharp cheddar, avocado, slaw, BBQ sauce on a ciabatta roll. - ORDER TWO!  This one was my favorite because it has all of my favorites in one sandwich.  It was super tasty with the combo of the sausage, avocado and BBQ sauce.  A marriage made in BEC heaven in my eyes.*I also stole a bite of the shaved broccoli and cauliflower salad from another friend who joined us later which was fresh and delicious!Drinks: We ordered a sparkling water and a medium orange juice.Price: $43.39Service: Super friendly from ordering at the counter, bringing out our food and upon departure they checked to make sure everything was to our liking.Ambiance: Casual modern.  The space is bright and welcoming.  Would I go back? ABSOLUTELY!  I actually can't wait for my next trip back because they had so many great BECs on the menu that I still want to try.P.S. I've read a handful of reviews that it's too expensive, but in my opinion it is reasonably priced for the quality of food you're receiving.  You can tell that their ingredients are fresh, their breads are artisanal (brioche, pugliese, ciabatta) and overall the sandwich is higher quality - you can taste it.  You should definitely give BEC a chance!",3,,1
24,Hayley K.,"New York, NY",0,25,0,5.0,12/2/2017,"The veg-EC is incredible!! I feel like it has a really hearty amount of vegetables and goat cheese and definitely fills me up and feels worth the slightly higher price tag. Great breakfast sandwich for a vegetarian. There are a lot of interesting/creative options on the menu but I have only tried the veg-EC because the rest have meat in them. The interior is also really cute and airy. Some of the seating is reclaimed Coney Island boardwalk which is neat. It's counter service but a great place to sit and eat, and usually busy but not overly crowded - I don't think I've ever not been able to find a seat. I believe their eggs are also locally sourced, which is another plus. Overall great quick breakfast spot!",,1,

I say yes, and here's why:better bunbetter eggsbetter cheesebetter bacon (heck some places even use precooked thin bacon strips, or use turkey bacon)better cooking method (I love how the egg is over easy and still runny when you eat it).If you've never tried it and are still skeptical, you should try it at least once.",1,1,2

Fresh ingredients and full of flavor. My go to would always be the BEC Classic but 2 other sandwiches stood out as well. The Roadhouse, 2 eggs as well but with italian sausage, avocado and slaw on a ciabatta roll and the farmhouse 2 eggs with pacetta fig jam honey and ricotta on a publiese roll. A nice match of sweet and salty with the jam and bacon.it's great that they offer different bread types with each sandwich combo and the runny fried egg is absorbed all in the sandwich which mixes the flavors well.

This was definitely the case, but since I almost expected it, it didn't bother me as much.It tasted fine. I wasn't unhappy, but I don't plan to return. The avocado was spread so thin. It was more like a sauce than actual avocado. That was a bummer. And if I had known they were going to fully cook my egg to spread it across four haves of toast, I would have just ordered too eggs. Haha.Overall, it was a fine meal. My cousin liked hers, and I was fine. I just wouldn't recommend it. Avocado Toast is so easy to make and let me tell you, mine is way better than that.",1,,1

You're going to pay around $10 a sandwich, give or take, but it's worth the money, and the sandwiches are pretty big, bigger than ones from a bodega.

While I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked the Classic BEC bread, my sandwich came with barely any bacon. I paid extra to add avocado and tomato, however, the ""added avocado"" was a spread you get in a box rather than actual cut-up pieces. The tomatoes were also sad, little cherry tomatoes versus the sliced pieces I was expecting. Definitely not worth paying extra for. The entire ordeal was incredibly messy because the egg was runny, something I was not anticipating. All in all, I do not plan on coming back here as the food was neither good nor affordable.

BEC is a casual eat-in or carry out sandwich shop which was perfect for our after gym brunch. Any eats has named Bacon, Egg and Cheese can't be bad right? The space bright and opens to the street.  The service was friendly. The wide variety of sandwiches are good for everyone and prices are reasonable. I had the Mammoth and my friend opted for the Chelsea Lo-Cal cause he is so Chelsea boy. Yes, he does live in Chelsea. I figured if need be the gym is only a couple doors down. The sandwich was satisfyingly good. It wasn't oversized but good amount of taste.I'm definitely a fan of BEC in moderation of course. Everything is good in moderation.",2,,
46,Gregorio C.,"Bronx, NY",91,78,57,2.0,3/25/2017,"This place is all gimmick and no substance. They place an emphasis on the quality and sustainability of their food but it surely doesn't match up with the taste, cost and actual content you get when you order. My girlfriend ordered avocado toast which was $5 and it was a spread served on one piece of toast split in two. No actual whole pieces of avocado and it tasted like they cut it with oil and some other creamy substance leaving it far from what you get at your local deli. I ordered an egg and bacon sandwich on two small pieces of toast and it had the taste of something no better than what you get at a diner for $12. I don't have a problem paying more for organic and sustainable food but this place cuts corners to save on cost giving you less and compromising on the taste of the food.",3,,

They put way too much dressing on the actual sandwich as if all the flavor is the sole thing that will make or break the sandwich. And you know it took 15 minutes to make an egg sandwich, I think this is a little long   Its a fun and airy place, its a tight fit if you are waiting for your order. You will defiantly be in someones way at one point or bump into someone. Seats are usually all taken during its peak times but I have seen it empty, so its a hit or miss. Not worth going back.",5,,1

The bacon, cheese, and roll were definitely higher quality than any other bacon egg and cheese sandwich you would get in the city. I really liked how the egg was a bit runny so when you first bit into the sandwich, the yolk would ooze out of it.Basically, this is a very high quality bacon egg and cheese sandwich with premium ingredients. One of the best i've had. The catch - it's $9 for the sandwich! Worth it on occasion when you want to treat yourself",,,

Worst part is, I had to pay $2 extra for the skimpy, undercooked portion of chicken on an already overpriced $10 salad!!!I was so excited to try the broccoli and cauliflower salad ($9.50) because I love a non-traditional salad. The small restaurant was extremely crowded so my friend and I took our order to go. Guy behind the register was very efficient but still nice. Once we got home, I had a few bites of the salad-- it had a nice crunch to it from the shaved broccoli and cauliflower, however, it was drenched in dressing. All was decent until I ate a piece of chicken and realized it was still raw!!!! And not just one piece of raw chicken... Every single strip was raw in the middle. I didn't end up finishing the salad because I was worried the raw chicken had contaminated he entire dish. Next time, open your eyes and look at the chicken before dumping it on a salad.

In all honesty, it was a yummy sandwich but wasn't mind blowing. It took a little while to get my sandwich & the couple who came in after me got both their sandwiches before me. It also cost me $11, which is a bit steep for a breakfast sandwich alone. I understand that Serrano ham & manchego are imported, but I've had less expensive sandwiches w/ almost the same ingredients & had a better flavor profile.In general, they make a decent sandwich but not the most outstanding thing I've ever tasted & it's a little pricey.",1,,1
70,Byron C.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,3.0,8/19/2017,"The ""classic"" is a decent stab at a bec but tbh I found it to be too bready. For the base price you basically get a thin layer of protein on a giant brioche (of course you can pay to add extra meat/egg, but by that point you're well over the $10, likely $12 mark, which is bec sacrilege). Altogether the sandwich had pretty good flavor but nothing to write home about. I can't comment on the other varieties of bec they serve - they looked interesting. Anyway IMO part of the appeal of a bec is the cheap hard roll and the hole-in-the-wall bodega you get it from. This place tries a little too hard and comes up short.",,,

I cannot put her message, so I put my answer to her below: Of course I should have known what BEC stands for, also should have acknowledged with all those complicated options rather than someone explained that to me. And who doesn't synonymies bacon with pork in this world? I'm so old-fashioned that I didn't know of Turkey bacon. And so sorry I misrepresented it by putting 50 cents more on the review. 50 cents, wow, a Big deal. I mean, why did you even reply, to make people feel worse? Man..I lived in that neighborhood over 7 years, saw so many new shops in and out. I truly hope yours lasts. good luck.  =============Went there this morning.

Its baked and fluffed to perfection, its not overwhelming at all with the yeast, very light and delicious. The avocado was mashed, great replacement for ketchup or mayo, very healthy option. The smoked bacon and sharp cheddar was so good, I didn't want the sandwich to end - the egg popped, not over cooked, yolky and delicious. I feel like the bacon also provided a very good salt balance with the rest of the ingredients. The BEC was so good; I couldn't add anything to it, like hot sauce. Oh yeah, and the fresh OJ was delightful.The place has a modern + Chelsea industrial feel, very nice to sit in, lots of seating. The lady who ran the counter was very nice, and helpful.

For $8, you can get a sandwich that likely costs $2 at your place below the apartment. Sure, the ingredients are higher quality here and the flavors are more fun. But if we're talking money alone, go with the bodega for a cheaper option.The reason I am so favorable of this spot, though? The friendly staff. The ample seating space. Multiple beverage options.

77,Allan C.,"Miami, FL",6,6,0,3.0,7/24/2016,"I'd like to start this review and mention I am a native New Yorker who has eaten roughly 1,500 - 2,000 Bacon, Egg and  Cheese from various NYC delis, bodegas, diners, up scale bunches, food trucks and home made versions in my lifetime. I was on the fence about paying $10 for a sandwich staple that usually costs $3.00 - $5.00 depending where you are in the city. The sandwich was indeed delicious, but I was left uninspiried and still hungry after eating it. I just expected more for that price tag and to have the traditional taste. I appreciate the upscale bacon  and other ingredients but what makes this sandwich so special in general, is it's simplicity of fatty bacon, processed cheese, on a simple roll. I would eat here again and try their other variations but I simply can't give this higher than 3 stars based on what I have mentioned above. More bacon, more cheese, overwhelm me; make it an experience.",2,2,

I ordered the BEC classic, which came on brioche. Yolk was runny, cheese was just the right consistency. The bacon was thick-cut, the brioche was the right texture and I really enjoyed it. I saw some of the other sandwiches that people had ordered and they all looked good.The over-the-counter service was good. The prices are higher than I'd like, but not much you can do about it, since the ingredients are pretty top-notch. I'm not sure if I would regularly pay $8.50+ for a smaller sandwich, but who knows.This was good. I wouldn't come here everyday, but it's good to know that it's here. I'll try the other sandwiches when I'm in the mood. I feel like this place would go nuts if it were open late nights on weekends. If you haven't been here before, I would give it a try, but after that, it's hard to say that this is a place to frequent.",7,2,4
80,Sunny T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",335,128,27,4.0,7/10/2015,"I thought BEC's overall 3-star rating was a little harsh. Yes, I get that the prices are over the top, but hey, their sandwiches are egg-cellent (I'm so sorry. Way too overused not to mention, cheesy pun--didn't mean to throw in that cheese pun either...)!I arrived exactly at 4 as they were closing, however, they were nice enough to take my order as their last although I would have to take it to go. I got the Farmhouse which was eggs, crispy pancetta, ricotta, honey, baby spinach and fig jam, served on a pugliese roll. Man was that sandwich right up my alley. I didn't care that I had to sit outside in the scorching sun on one of Amorino Gelato's benches. I didn't care that the wind and my hair were going against my favor on being able to eat in peace. And I didn't care that the honey and the pancetta drippings were getting on my clothes. All I did care about was that damn good sandwich getting in my mouth. The flavors and textures all worked so well together--the sweetness of the honey and fig jam against the saltiness of the pancetta, and the luscious pillowy-egg oh-so perfectly cooked with a runny yolk was in perfect balance with the crispy pancetta and fresh spinach. Even the bread worked its magic, being the perfect vehicle to sop up all the juiciness. I'm salivating. It's a messy sandwich, so please be smarter than me and take more than one napkin. I'd also recommend keeping hands away from hair until you're thoroughly clean (oops, I got some fig in my hair--I swear it was the wind!). As others have said, I don't think it's worth the price tag ($11.50) for something that you can probably make at home if you're willing to put in the effort. But people always say to live in the moment, and boy was I enjoying every moment of that Farmhouse sandwich.",2,1,
81,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1009,377,1497,4.0,5/20/2015,"So, I know this place has been long-awaited and there are a lot of fans, even before it opened, however, it's hard for me to give it 5-stars as an egg sandwich is still, well, an egg sandwich, and I usually reserve my 5-stars for places that have blown me away, so I'm fairly selective with that rating...now I guess if the sandwich had pork belly or foie gras or truffles, then I might consider the higher rating, but until then, it's still an egg sandwich.I'll admit that the BEC Classic and the Roadhouse sandwiches were very good, but not exceptionally better than a bacon egg & cheese you'd get at a good diner here in the city.  The best part about the sandwich though is the brioche bun, that's definitely unique, and adds to the sandwich, and the egg is perfectly medium-cooked, and I like the amount of black pepper they put on the eggs.  I do think, however, that the cheese is a little runny and they go light on the bacon, and I personally like the bacon at most diners (New Venus, Star on 18, Greek Corner, Dish) better as I can request it soft or crispy depending on my mood, and BEC's bacon is pretty thin in my opinion compared to the others.  I know it's sort of a apples-to-oranges comparing BEC to a diner, but it provides a good baseline. And, it's fairly pricey ($8.50 to $11.50, depending on the sandwich) given that you could get an almost comparable bec at one of the mentioned diners for several dollars less, or, you could even walk across the street to Bareburger and get a very good burger with egg on top for $12.  Once again, not a perfect comparison, but sort of. The other sandwiches look pretty good (although they use the lesser-tasty Pugliese or Ciabatta roll, in my opinion).  But the real selling point of the place is the ability to get a very good BEC at anytime of the day or night; and that they stay open late (like 4am late) on weekends, so that'll be a nice change from late-night pizza after drinking all night.",6,,4

The menu has a great variety of options, the food is delicious, and the coffee hit the spot. Overall, I'm definitely a fan and would go back there for another breakfast. A couple specifics on my visit: I ordered the BEC Classic and my boyfriend ordered the Mammoth. The Classic was great, but I felt it was a lot of bread and not enough of the stuff inside. For me personally, I would have preferred more ""stuffing"" in comparison to how much bread the bun has. Regardless, it was tasty. The Mammoth was also delicious. The proportions there are more than generous, and I really enjoyed the carmelized onions. I could have done without the pork sausage as it had a pretty strong flavor, but again, really good.",1,,

I was surprised to see the lack of vegetarian options on the menu, so I opted for the salad and was not disappointed. I love the crunch it packs - and with the shaved almonds, cashews and pumpkin seeds, it also has good fats and protein. I love the gluten free bread here, too. Who makes it? Must find out.My boyfriend loves their Chelsea Lo-Cal and it's perfect hangover food.Otherwise, I'd love if BEC expanded beyond the basics to be more inclusive for their non-meat eating customers. Yes, we can sub and swap... but it be great to add some more variety!",,,

Unfortunately, I then waited almost 35 minutes for my sandwich, which was the simply BEC Classic (add avocado). During this time, I watched SO MANY delivery men come in for Caviar orders - I think BEC either needs to add more staff or make some other managerial change, because it was a ridiculous wait (and not all that cheap either - as others have pointed out, you can get a decent BEC from a bodego for half the price and a fifth of the wait). I am still giving this 3 stars because when I finally got my food, it was delicious (of course, I was also ravenous). But in any case, I probably won't be back.",3,2,3

97,Amanda L.,"New Britain, CT",116,94,250,2.0,3/6/2016,"I wanted to see their take on sandwiches. Could they do any better than a homemade sandwich? I found it to be another place for people who could not bring themselves to make a breakfast sandwich that could easily be made at home. Overpriced for no reason, just the sandwich itself. This means no free sides of fries, salad, drink, NADA. They would be put as an extra charge. I regret spending $10.50 on the Chelsea Lo-cal. Even though I liked their idea of toppings for this sandwich, it was not worth the $10 because...eggs, turkey bacon, greek yogurt? multigrain toast? --these ingredients are no where near fancy or hard/expensive to find. If they were specially imported eggs from Japan, aged Serbian cheese, or 100% organic 12 grain sprouted bread --I get it. It would make more sense to price the sandwich at $10 but BEC does not do that. You can see the simplicity of ingredients throughout their entire menu. I saw a display of mimosas but mimosas were no where to be seen on the menus. I had to ask them if they offered it. They did. I sat down and sandwich was brought to me in 10 minutes. Another 10 minutes in, I had to remind them about my mimosa they forgot about. It did not taste right, the ratio of champagne to orange juice -- juice tasted like school cafeteria orange juice. I could not finish it. The wait time for my one sandwich and drink was ridiculous. I can receive a more complex meal in a shorter time and in a busier restaurant in comparison. This tells me that management here needs to be improved  The space is tiny tiny tiny and overrun by seating. Barely giving any space for people to order at counter. Customers literally have to cram sideways between the dining customers and front counter. The uncomfortable looking crowd deters more customers from coming inside. I sat at the table right by the condiment/front counter that was left and the whole time I ate, I had other waiting customers hovering over my table and blocking the condiment shelf. I really felt like we were all hanging out in a closet. Trying to reach for the condiments/napkins required apologetic ""excuse me's"" and an exchange of sour and surprised expressions between me and the waiting patrons.",1,2,
98,Kathi P.,"Charlottesville, VA",0,4,8,5.0,4/24/2017,"The best bacon, egg and cheese I have ever had.

99,Mark N.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,26,98,2.0,7/19/2016,"While the BEC Classic is a good tasting item it doesn't warrant the $8.50 price tag.  Combined with a $3.50 grapefruit soda and dollar tip I nearly spent $15 for a small meal. And that's the second lowest priced item on the menu. The classic came with two eggs, applewood bacon and cheddar on a brioche bun and I left unfulfilled and unfilled. While it was well made it was nothing great.  And you need at least another egg and more bacon and cheese to feel like you had a modest breakfast.  For these prices I can splurge on a lox and veggie cream cheese bagel a few blocks down at Murrays and have money for a grumpy's coffee.",,,
100,Deanna A.,"Brooklyn, NY",516,115,58,4.0,6/10/2016,"One of my biggest laments living a gluten free lifestyle is the fact that I cannot partake in the delight of a dirt cheap greasy bodega BEC on the morning after an eve of heavy celebrations.I often think that my single mission in New York is to find the perfect bacon egg and cheese on gluten free bread. BEC isn't my favorite but it is a solid contender that is conveniently located a stones throw from my office. Both the classic and the farmhouse are hearty and have a strong balance of flavor. Plus the gluten free bread is pretty sizable and sturdy which on its own is no easy feat.Slow and a bit pricey so I would say this leans a bit more toward 3.5 stars than 4, but sometimes the heart wants what it wants and when the craving is strong BEC is worth it for a pre-work pop-in on what could otherwise be a struggle of a Friday. Just expect to pay ~$15 with the gf bread upcharge and likely wait at least 15 minutes for your order.Would I go out of my way for BEC? Eh probably not, but for a gluten free breakfast Sammy this certainly does the trick.",,,

Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. First off, the place is so tiny. There are a bunch of chairs and tables filling the floor space, but there is no room to stand, get up, and order. Either get a larger space or have no-minimal seating at all. The food just wasn't good. I got the classic sandwich. It was really overpriced and my sandwich was so tiny. It did not fill me up at all. There was no flavor and the bread they gave me was stale. Hardly any bacon in it as well. It felt like I was eating a mound of stale bread. They also forgot my friends order, we waited about 25 minutes. 25 minutes for a bacon egg and cheese?!?!?!

114,Karry L.,"Queens, NY",13,63,0,2.0,7/24/2015,"Hard pass.  The bacon egg and cheese (on a roll, always) is a New York classic, the holy trinity of the best of three separate farm animals, and the cholesterol-soaked rocket fuel that powered about a quarter of my super competitive public high school through 8:30 BC Calc classes.  As such, daring to gussy up the formula feels like a ham-fisted assault on Proustian memories, a sort of sacrilege, like putting organic, locally-sourced lipstick on a pig when the pig is already plenty goddamn delicious.  The problem isn't that it's not three times as good as an average BEC from the neighborhood bagel cart ($8.50 + tax vs $3).  The problem is that it's not even exactly as good.  When you try to make a bougie version of something that's already been optimized to the hilt by decades of industrious immigrant deli owners, then you at least have to pass the bar set by the original.  So let's count it up.  The bacon was okay, but didn't really add much and wasn't crispy at all.  Which is more than I can say for the sharp cheddar, which I didn't even notice until the last few bites, a fact that reaffirms that yes, American cheese does have its place in the world, and it does that job wonderfully.  I guess the egg and the bread were fine, but the entire package really could've used more salt, and ultimately begs the question, how can something with bacon AND cheese in the name be so bland?  I felt like I was eating something...healthy.  If you think this place can beat whatever you can whip up at home, then that just really means you need to up your cooking game.",2,1,
115,Cat C.,"Kirtland, OH",2,10,1,2.0,6/4/2015,"So $11 dollar (no side dish and without tax, so you'll be paying more) breakfast sandwich aside, let's talk about bigger issues. A full $1.50 to add avocado or sub for egg whites, are you out of your mind? $5.50 for a ""large"" aka 16 oz coffee (normally a regular/medium) is insane but don't worry folks they're not done yet - they're charging $5.50 for the same size unsweetened iced tea! Wtf?! Costs you maximum 25cents to put tea bags in water. Stop.This place needs to chillllllllll on their prices - they're not a sit down brunch, they're basically a Chipotle of breakfast sandwiches (order at front and fight for a seat after). Once the hype dies down you're gunna need to depend on the local community to support you, and at that price, it's just not feasible.

118,Andy K.,"North Strathfield, Australia",16,39,15,5.0,8/15/2015,"You know, i've noticed a movement afoot in Manhattan. The emergence of indie non corner cutting fast casual places. Places like this where just because you order at the counter and there is not waiter service doesn't mean you're going to get mystery bulk bought cattle feed quality ingredients. Today was my first visit and looking over the menu board I decided on the BEC 'Classic' not because it was cheaper than their other creations but because when a business calls something their 'Classic' i'm going to assume it's your signature namesake and it's going to embody the soul of the menu. I also got a fruit salad which had a very surprisingly cheap $3.50 price tag on it. It was very clear immediately upon receiving the sandwich and taking my first bites that all the ingredients are indeed irreproachable. I appreciated the texture of the gooey soft cooked egg yoke (not runny) and the pleasing softness of the brioche bun. Like another reviewer noted, it tasted healthy, but not in a eye-roll tie-die granola hippie way but in a refreshing and surprised one eyebrow raised impressed way. I'm baffled at all the people up in arms about the price, i've paid much more for far less at brunch places - New York is littered with brunch spots who serve poorly executed sloppy food using crappy ingredients with a stupid price tag and if you think about it i'm sure a place will come to mind for you too.

The employees are really friendly too.I went with the Farmhouse ($10.50): Eggs / Crispy pancetta / Ricotta / Honey / Baby spinach / Fig jam / Pugliese rollThe fig jam makes the sandwich, and when combined with the honey makes for a savory sweet bite that hits the spot.  The salty, crispy pancetta contrasts well with the sweetness, and the ricotta was nice too.  My only critique was that my eggs were overcooked a bit, as I would have liked them to be a little runny.I also tried the slaw which was light and, for lack of a better word, ""vinegar-y,"" which is just how I like it.  The slaw cost $3.50 (all of their sides do).I plan to return to BEC to try some of their other gourmet sandwiches, however I don't plan to purchase any of the beverages, as they are too overpriced, even for New York.  I'm happy to pay more for quality ingredients and all-natural, cage-free eggs, but I won't, for example, pay $3 for a water.  The complimentary tap water is just fine for me.",3,1,

How does a sandwich that features Serrano ham and manchego need salt? I feel like this is a cooking breakthrough in itself.You literally had one job. Hint: it's the name of the shop.

141,Jessica C.,"Queens, NY",144,243,151,3.0,3/5/2016,a solid place to grab some quick breakfast. the place is a little cramped since they try to fit a lot of tables into a small area. i ordered the farmhouse and it was rather small. i'm not sure if i was just super hungry by 11am but this sandwich did not fill me up as i had hoped. the fig jam was delicious and paired well with the pancetta spinach and egg. At around $11 total it isn't cheap for a sandwich but it is also cheaper than going to brunch in some places around new york city. if you're just interested in a quick breakfast bite this will be a decent spot to hit up. I went here with two guy friends and we all agreed that we had room for food after our sandwiches which is not what you really want to feel after paying $11+ on food.,2,,

Save yourself $8 and go to the trucks on the side that make them for $2 and gets the job done. Good try BEC but in the end your just a breakfast sandwich.

Updated review","Total disappointment. My Chelsea lo-cal was a soggy, cold mess. My partners classic was also cold and the bun was too sweet. The services was fine. Atmosphere and music nice.",,,
151,Andy R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,33,8,2.0,10/7/2015,"Delicious sandwich, but the overall experience was a complete failure. It takes more than good food to run a restaurant. They're missing a lot of the pieces. Would not recommend, but 2 stars still because the flavor (of my Chelsea Lo-cal sandwich) was very good.First off, the girl at the front was completely clueless. As in, fully and utterly unaware of what's going on. And this should not be her fault - she either should not have been hired for that role or she should have been trained better...both of which the owner(s) should take responsibility for. And funny enough...the owner (or two? there was a man and a woman) was actually there. But they didn't seem to care all that much more.The girl rang up the order incorrectly. I asked for (a) soup, (b) salad, and (c) sandwich. When I was 'signing' with my finger on the screen, the salad wasn't there. She was shocked to hear that I also wanted a salad, as if she wasn't even listening during the order. She didn't know what to do to add it, and yelled across the counter to some guy (the owner?) sitting there not giving two poops about how she is dealing with customers. He just yelled back ""yea, ring up a new order."" No, the right answer is ""sorry about that (dumb) mistake, the side salad is on us"" or even some sort of more empathetic involvement. The girl also couldn't explain the soup options. Apparently there is only one, but the board says ""chicken / vegetables"" as if you have 2 choices; turns out that's one soup...neither the customers knew that (another lady in line also asked about it) nor did the girl behind the counter know. Once again, owner's fault. Training + it should say ""chicken AND vegetables"" not separate with a slash all awkwardly.Yadda yadda, tons of moments of displeasure that I'll skip, but two more:- The girl was biting her fingernails, scratching her face and rubbing her eyes...not to mention also handling the register and cash as part of her role...YET she was getting uncomfortably close to the food area and playing around with some lids and trays near the kitchen so I immediately jumped up towards the counter to ask her to please let me grab everything so that she doesn't contaminate the whole meal with her hands that are clearly getting both front of house and back of house access- The soup was cold. The owner was there so I asked her to please heat it up. She was very apathetic. She told the cook/chef that ""it's not warm enough for him"" ... no, no ... don't make me sound all picky and prissy, the soup was COLD as in not heated at all as in colder than room temperature. So it wasn't ""not warm enough for me"" it was just not done correctly. Own your mistakes.And the owner was not apologetic at all throughout any of this. Which, interestingly enough, if you read any of her replies within Yelp you'll see that never, not once, does she say ""I'm sorry"" or ""I apologize"" or anything of the sort. That's a HUGE red flag for me. If the place is run by someone who can't be humbled enough by her own (or her place's) mistakes and acknowledge them AND own them ... then that's not a place for me.",4,2,1
152,Jessica T.,"Astoria, NY",2,40,0,1.0,5/17/2016,"Ordered an egg white and turkey bacon on toast. Cost me $11.

You wont be disappointed unless you're Amanda L. :-(((   PS My only recommendation is that the staff, when bringing you your food, need to bring napkins to the table or remind you to get them yourself after you pay.  I always have to get up and get them myself, halfway through the meal when i need one.",,,

NOW!!!I honestly only went in to experience this train wreck for myself The basic bacon egg and cheese that goes for about $3 at nearly every corner deli in NYC goes for $8.50 and is a massive disappointment! It's not very large, I fact it's smaller than your average $3 breakfast sandwich, and they skimp on everything! The bacon and the cheese! They don't even ask how you would like your eggs! It's really just ridiculous! I thought I saw my friend sitting at a table behind her laptop and I said hi, and then apologized for being wrong and this woman says ""I'm the owner, I'm the owner"". Clearly you have nothing to be proud of!  If you want any chance of succeeding you are going to have to 1) lower your grossly ridiculous and inflated prices 2) make the sandwiches larger 3) more cheese and bacon, don't be so cheap 4) you need to have at least 1 vegetarian breakfast sandwich option.  AT LEAST! And I'm not even a vegetarian! A tofu scramble for vegans couldn't hurt either 5) if you are going to say you serve breakfast all day you're going to need to add: oatmeal, pancakes and French toast at least! 6) not many people are going to add on $3.50 potatoes! Encourage people to add them into their ""meal"" that should come with tea or coffee.,.you can maybe charge a $1 or $2! 7) my heart bleeds for you like your debt and credit cards!

However, I took the plunge and stopped by today to check out what some friends have said about the quality of the food here. After trying the BEC Classic, I can say I will not be back. For the price, one would expect more than 2 thin slices of bacon and a few sprinkles of cheese. The sandwich was so over spiced with salt and pepper that it was almost unedible. The only good thing I will say is that they do know how to cook a good fried egg, over medium. That being said, there are plenty of delis in the neighborhood that, if given instructions, can produce a product just as good, if not better for a third of the cost. So much for ""elevating"" the BEC.",1,1,

My main gripe is it's not fast: I've had to wait quite a while especially during peak breakfast times. You've gotta get me served faster in the AM when I need to go to work. Know this is a matter of personal taste, but I'm not fond at all of the 'signature' sandwich roll with bacon baked in. (There are other options.) Things I like about this place: egg is fried at high temp and tastes really good. Toppings are nice (but try to avoid strong flavors that will overwhelm the egg. For instance I had one the other day with blue cheese and couldn't taste the egg at all.) Sandwiches are decent size.",,,1

I was almost dissuaded by the exorbitant price -- 11 dollars for a sandwich with two eggs and a few toppings -- but figured, if it's that expensive they must know what they're doing. Wrong. While the sandwich was fairly tasty it was simply not worth the price .The person who seemed like the owner said the eggs would be runny. They were not. Worse, it took them perhaps 20 minutes to make a sandwich that would have been done in three at any cheap deli. Why it took so long to make such a mediocre product is beyond me. I mean, the roasted peppers clearly came out of a jar as did the tapenade.  Out then jar, on to the sandwich. Done. The goat cheese was good, but other than that there was nothing to note than the sandwich being two well-done eggs in a bun.I don't like leaving bad reviews, but because the product was so subpar and pricy I'm afraid I have no other choice than to warn others not to eat here unless you like throwing money away on an outrageously priced egg sandwich.",,2,

172,Steven L.,"New York, NY",1,2,1,5.0,8/16/2015,"Long time Yelp lurker, first time Yelp poster. I've  never been one to review anything on a public forum, however I feel I would be doing the great city of New York a disservice if I chose not to tell you about the restaurant  whose name sake comes from the holiest of breakfast traditions THE Bacon, Egg and Cheese. If Bacon, Egg and Cheese was a religion, ""BEC"" on 8th avenue would be its Mecca. Now I know what you're thinking. Any bodega, diner, or human being of the planet Earth can whip up some eggs, sizzle some bacon, melt some cheese and sandwich it on two slices of bread, and you're probably right. But there is no chance in hell that you, or anyone, can create a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese more delicious than the beautiful folks over at ""BEC"" can. You can never go wrong with the holy trinity that is Bacon, Egg and Cheese, but the way their yolk runs down and melts into their brioche (I usually substitute that for ciabatta) bread, combined with the thick cut bacon, topped with the melty gooey deliciousness that the english language defines as ""cheese"" is nothing short of perfection. If you live in the five boroughs and consider yourself a bacon, egg, and cheese lover and have not tried BEC yet, get off your ass and go try it. If you're a bridge and tunneler and consider yourself a bacon egg and cheese lover, get off your suburban ass and go try it. If you are a citizen of the planet earth and are indulging in the culture that is New York City, when you're finished walking the High Line, move your foreign ass a few blocks east, and knock down THE BEST part of a New York morning, the Bacon Egg and Cheese. This is a pilgrimage for all who consider themselves a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese lover. Go. You will be damn happy you went.Aside from that, the owner and people who work there are awesomely kind people. Polite and a joy to talk with. ""BEC"" has a menu with other items I have not tried yet, but just knowing the quality ingredients they choose, and how well they prepare their Bacon, egg, and cheese, I would bet my life that you will be satisfied with whatever you choose to order.

189,Brian B.,"Manhattan, NY",64,22,34,2.0,7/25/2015,"I was hoping this place would be amazing.  I loved the font (the geeky side of me) and loved the concept even better.  When we walked up, the place is a bit tiny (to be expected) so get there early if you want a seat.  Speaking of the inside, there is NO a/c (a fail in my opinion).  On a relatively mild day like today, it was fine. But if it was any hotter and you didn't have one of the two window tables (which only seat 2 each by the way), you'd be in trouble.  I've gotta say, the service was REALLY good.  It's definitely fast-food style (meaning you order and they call your name when it's ready).  The line was short so we were nowhere near ready when it came time to order so feeling the pressure with the folks behind us, I asked our cashier what she'd recommend.  She mentioned the classic, farmhouse or the steak were the top sellers.  The wife and I both went with the classic (eggs, bacon, and sharp cheddar on a cheese crusted brioche bun) plus we added avocado (extra $1.50).  We added two flat waters and a two iced coffees.  Total bill came out to $32; which is a bit pricey when you consider no sides came with the sandwich (I would've gladly paid $10 for a side of something).  The coffee...tasted terrible.  We couldn't pin point what we were tasting but it was one of the worst iced coffees either of us had ever had.  We tried doctoring it up to power through it but couldn't do it.  We both tossed them (later stopped at Starbucks, which isn't great either, but had to have our caffeine).  For $4.50 for a small coffee (the water in a bottle was only $1.50), they have to get this right.  When the food came out, it looked ordinary which made me think it was going to be similar to my coffee experience.  But then when we started eating, we both were pleasantly surprised. The eggs are a bit runny (which we actually liked) and the bun was perfect. Not too toasted and soft enough to sop up the eggs.  The avocado didn't overpower the sandwich but gave it that perfect extra touch.  Overall, I would come back but it wouldn't be on my MUST have list. Dang it!  I really wanted this one to be!",,,
190,Jeff W.,"Houston, TX",0,6,0,5.0,11/4/2016,"Awesome place. We were visiting NYC and stopped by - great decision. We had the BEC Classic and the Farmhouse, and both were delicious. Sandwiches were flavorful, eggs were properly cooked, and it was nice to see so much variety within one concept. For anyone complaining about price, you get what you pay for. All natural eggs, freshly baked bread, locally roasted coffee, etc - if you want  your $5 bodega sandwich, that's fine but don't compare the two. Space is charming, upbeat and fun - will definitely be back and have already recommended it to many others.",,,
191,Amy R.,"Chicago, IL",0,13,0,5.0,9/3/2016,"Ordered the BEC Classic, added Avocado. The egg was perfectly runny and the bacon perfectly crispy and the avocado was nice and mashed so it didn't squirt out the sides. And that brioche! So soft. Would've loved the option to add veggies like tomato and lettuce. Great service too.",,,
192,Matan L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,12,1,1.0,6/29/2015,Why not just charge $12 for a kinder egg size sandwich? Unfriendly staff. The sandwich barely filled the gap between my teeth. Overpriced.,,,
193,Debbie L.,"New York, NY",4,3,0,2.0,6/14/2015,"Service - 0 stars. Placed a takeout order for one bec Classic and was told it would take 20 minutes. I had my doubts that it would take so long and really hate cold eggs so I showed up in 5 minutes. I told the cashier I had placed a takeout order, gave her my name, and waited for my food. Turns out, the order was ready the whole time, sitting on the counter, getting cold. While I was paying, a man handling food with gloves on came over to check a text message on his cell phone.  He didn't change his gloves afterwards.",,,
194,Raquel M.,"Forest Hills, NY",124,15,29,5.0,6/5/2015,"Folks, this IS as good as it gets - really the best bacon egg and cheese I've ever had.",,,
195,Steve L.,"Kirkland, WA",25,5,0,5.0,6/3/2016,"Want a quick, healthy, tasty breakfast and great service? Bec is your place. I had the Mammoth breakfast sandwich (the menu is all breakfast) . Fresh, nice little spicy kick with the pepperjack and jalapeño. Good coffee too. The owner is super friendly, super cute. She's the type of small business owner you root for. They just crossed their one year anniversary. Hope to see this little Chelsea gem do well!",,,
196,Mooch B.,"New York, NY",12,29,3,4.0,6/28/2015,"I had BEC for the first time today, The BEC Classic was good, my only gripe was I wished my egg was over medium instead of over hard. Still very tasty and their potatoes are money! Place is a bit small so seating is a difficult to get but whatever the food is good would definitely come back!",,,
197,Ruby R.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,7/29/2015,"I've been to this restaurant twice in the past 2 weeks, and both times they did not disappoint. The first time I had the Chelsea Lo-Cal because I'm one of those people who loves broccoli. The second time I had the farmhouse. They are both delicious and I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. The staff is friendly, and always helpful. They are always busy, so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are in a rush.",,,
198,CuNyc S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,21,10,3.0,6/14/2015,"I am a huge fan of all-day breakfast, especially bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches!  Although not thrilled about it, I can live with the prices due to the ingredients.  Ordered the Chelsea Lo-Cal to go. It was a bit sloppy and not cut in half.  The roasted peppers were missing and it was heavy on the pesto yogurt sauce.  I'm also trying to figure out how the sandwich is ""Lo-Cal"", given that includes 2 over easy eggs by default.  They didn't have the nutritional information when I asked.  Not available on the website either, but it indicates that egg whites are an option.It was very yummy however, and I look forward to eating a better made version.  I'll make sure to get egg whites next time too.",,,
199,Peggy Y.,"Boston, MA",2,24,1,5.0,7/6/2015,"I just finished scarfing down my homemade bacon/egg/cheese, and let me tell you, my culinary skills are a sad substitute to the gooey goodness I had a few weeks ago at BEC.  Even though you may be tempted to go with the Classic (which was freaking amazing), I dare you to start with the Chelsea Lo-Cal. Get out of your normal bec habit and deviate from the get go.  I promise you won't regret it. I started with the Classic, came back later that day (yes, I'll admit it) and tried the Chelsea Lo-Cal.  Loved it.  And while you're eagerly awaiting your deliciousness, I've said this in other reviews too, people, you gotta practice patience.  New +  popular place = lots of people = meditate/say a little om while waiting for your goodness.  Small businesses need a little grace while they figure stuff out and adjust on the fly.  If this was, say, Starbucks or some other big chain, then yes, I suppose you get to be a wee bit more impatient since they have these things operationalized to the T.  But for the newbies, cut them some slack.  Oh and they make these suckers made-to-order with fresh stuff, so if you're wanting to feed your hangover properly, suck down some water and wait.  Rant over.  Namaste and happy yum yum.  p.s. props for the adorable dog mural in the bathroom.  cheeky.",,,
