0,Joujou N.,"Brooklyn, NY",31,207,462,5.0,11/8/2018,"Came in here for breakfast. Alot of construction works, families, working people frequent the place.The service is great, we were greeted and got seated quickly. Our order came to our table quickly. It was correct. The place is clean- needs a bit of updating but nonetheless clean. I recommend eating here because honestly they're decent human beings. So looking around, this neighborhood is kinda shady but these nice folks allow the homeless to come inside, sit at a table all the way in the back-they don't bother anyone, speak to anyone, stare at anyone etc.. they keep to themselves. The employees give them some orange juice and any untouched food by the patrons are not wasted/thrown out, they give it to them with a clean fork and napkin-so that's cool. Other places can turn around and not let these guys in but these folks have shown them some kindness. I would eat here again and I recommend it to others.",1,,1
1,Kendra C.,"New York, NY",51,171,469,4.0,10/28/2018,"I love diners. This is one of those fantastic diners. The place is on the smaller side so it can get a bit crowded with a wait, but it's well worth it. There seems to be only one cook for the place, but he was efficient enough when getting to everyone's orders. For some reason, instead of ordering breakfast I ordered the patty melt. I would highly recommend it. Perfectly pressed with melted cheese and onions, it was as delicious as patty melts can get!Also the pancakes (which I managed to try a bite of) were fluffy and delicious. Nothing disappointed here, and I'd like to come back to try some more",1,,
2,Jeff G.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",159,178,230,3.0,10/24/2018,I was disappointed by Joe Jr.  I have read so many reviews and articles about how great Joe Jr. is.  I love a diner burger but the burger I got was really tasteless.  The meat was tender but I don't remember the last time I had a burger that had no taste.  The service is typical diner service.  I sat at the bar which was fine.  The burger came out fairly quickly maybe a little over done.   The real positive is the price here.  The burgers are very reasonable but I am not sure that is enough to get me back.  Which makes me sadly disappointed.,,,1

The service is no-nonsense fast, and the quality is typical of diner food: not gourmet, but sometimes a greasy bacon cheeseburger with fries and onion rings is exactly what you need.The food is always hot and fresh (they grill it in front of you) and I have a particular liking for their beef patties (bigger than expected and surprisingly juicy). The veggies that come with are average but needed, and the fries and onion rings are both mediocre though I can't stop myself from ordering them anyway.Prices are affordable and this place seems to be a long-time favorite for many--there are always regulars visiting whenever I'm ordering.",1,,
5,Sang C.,"New York, NY",64,109,301,5.0,3/19/2018,"An awesome classic and simple burger from Joe Juniors near union square Manhattan. No frills old school diner, one of the last of it's kind in the city. I ordered mine with japapenos, chedder cheese, cooked onions and avocados. One of my friends ordered the bacon cheeseburger and enjoyed it as well.The beef patty was pretty quality, a little bit greasy but all around solid burger. Service was alright. Very low prices. Seems like there's quite a few regulars that come here from the neighborhood. Would be happy to be back here again!",3,,
6,Tiffany C.,"New Brunswick, NJ",559,71,184,2.0,2/16/2018,"Very classic diner! I'm a huge fan of diners, so I came here on a Saturday morning for brunch after a fun night out. At 12pm, like expected, the restaurant was super full, but luckily there was just one table open for my party of 2 to sit at. FOOD: I ordered a classic burger. I was expecting a classic burger, nothing super fancy and I got just that. The deluxe comes with all the topics and fries. My only complaint about the burger was that even as soon as it came out, the bun was already super soggy. The fries were solid too, but nothing too special about the food. The food also took a super long time to come out. Granted, it was a busy afternoon, but we definitely were sitting there for more than 15 minutes hungry and jealously eyeing all the tables around us. SERVICE: I know this is one of your local, casual restaurants and it was seemed very family-owned, so maybe it was a bit understaffed? It was really packed and no one came by to take our order for a solid 10 minutes. Other tables that were seated after us got their order taken first and served their food first. (I think it was because we were seated in the corner). ATMOSPHERE: Very much your local, around-the-corner, family friendly diner. It was very crowded and had a very casual atmosphere. There are a number of tables and you can sit at the ""bar"" as well. There was also an open kitchen so you could watch things get cooked. OVERALL: I was craving a casual diner brunch and not feeling the super trendy and hip brunch places that day, so it satisfied my craving. You don't find too many of these places in New York. But I think compared to other diners, New Jersey diners have my heart.",2,1,1
7,Rance Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",256,126,41,4.0,3/7/2018,"Rock-solid classic eatery.  No-frills, perfect burger.  The tomatoes were a little off, but it's the middle of winter and tomatoes are pretty difficult to get right all the time.The menu is fairly robust- but a great burger is my guilty pleasure and there seemed to be a lot of buzz about it on reviews.The prices are incredibly reasonable too.  I think an entire meal for me was less than $10- IN MANHATTAN.If you're in the neighborhood and need a classic, try them out.",,,
8,Daniel Han Rong L.,"Tulsa, OK",46,17,63,5.0,5/21/2018,"As soon as I entered Juniors, I knew immediately that I was in for a memorable experience. When I saw the bond between the employees and how happy they were to be working there, I knew that their food will differ from other diners. I got a cozy, family vibe when I was there and It was very comfortable. Their food was really tasty, especially their cheeseburger. The way the burger was cooked is not well done, but more medium, so it was very juicy and tender. However I think you can request a well done burger. Also, the pancakes here was the best I've ever tasted. The prices here are very decent, It will cost you about $10-$15 depending on what you get.I hope you enjoy this place as much as I did!",3,,1
9,Elaine E.,"Bronx, NY",148,92,609,3.0,6/12/2018,"Actual Rating: 3.3Place: This is your very typical diner. A homey big space with big tables supplied with your usual condiments. I really like where this place is conveniently located, a very short walk from Union Square Park. Service: The person who served us was pretty alright. I didn't really see anything noteworthy. Just a guy who casually took our orders and answered our requests.Food: If you want your stomach to be filled, then this diner has your back. I ordered a hamburger which came with sides such as fries. I was a bit surprised at the amount I was given, but that reassures me that I got what was worth my buck. The burger was pretty good despite the price. It was tasty and juicy. However, I was not much of a big fan of the fries. The fries were a bit cold, and though I am glad about the amount, the taste was a bit bland for me.Price: The amount they give you is definitely great for its price. Everything was either around $10 or less from what I remember.  Results: Would I come back? Hm, probably not unless most places were closed, and I just wanted something to fill me up.",,,
10,Cat S.,"Manhattan, NY",446,371,0,3.0,4/8/2018,"Solid diner but not much more than that. Joe Jr definitely has a neighborhood vibe with plenty of regulars. On the weekends, people actually sit here and read their newspapers while eating, which I didn't realize was a thing people still did - there's something very home-y about it. The food is okay. We've tried a variety of dishes here including pancakes, french toast, egg salad, egg sandwich, the famous burger, onion rings, and dessert (milk shake + carrot cake). There's nothing here that's so tasty that I crave it and want to come back to get it. The food satisfies a hungry tummy and it comes fast, but other than that - nothing to write home about (including the burger they are known for - which was only okay). I also find the food to be a bit inconsistent. There are some dishes I've gotten more than once where the taste was significantly different each time. For example - the 1st time I had the egg salad here it was bland but the 2nd time it was suddenly a lot more flavorful. Or the onion rings - the 1st time I tried them they were crispy and perfect, but the 2nd time they were soggy. So it's hard to say that the food is ""dependable"" in this sense. I like coming here for the neighborhood diner vibe, but there's definitely better food to be found.",2,,1
11,Pete M.,"New York, NY",194,66,188,3.0,5/7/2018,The burgers here are very good. Very juicy and tasteful. I had the bacon cheese burger and it's solid. The fries were not all that. I didn't even finish mine. Kind of disappointed in that. But everyone loved the burgers hands down. The milkshakes were amazing! Tried vanilla strawberry and chocolate and they were all great! I think the strawberry was the best!,,,

Power to all who ordered the burgers they look great.*** FOOD ***However, for me, diner food is synonymous with breakfast food and I can say that Joe Jr. is the conforms-exactly-to-your-expectations-and-no-more diner breakfast fare. My friends and I all got different omelettes, which come with diner style potatoes (home fries) and some toast. It was all spectacularly average and delicious, which is really all anyone can ask of a place with 200 menu items. One fun tidbit is that the toast did not come buttered. Having grown up in the Midwest and New England Northeast where the toast is always buttered, I was surprised. Nonetheless, we powered through scrape after scrape of butter and jam.*** TIP ***Get the grapefruit juice! Sweet, yes, but so refreshing!",,,1

It's more of a ""im hungry but don't wanna spend more than 10$, so I guess I'll try it"" burger. The deluxe burger comes with tomatoes  and lettuce on your burger and fries on the side, but i don't think it's necessary. Fries weren't very great and you wouldn't miss the lettuce/tomatoes.

I finished the half of the patty melt, but could only finish about half of the omelette and potatoes. The omelette was good--maybe a tad overdone, but the pastrami added nice flavor to the dish. The burger was cooked well and the cheese was melted to perfection--we also added grilled onions, which were a nice touch.Overall, this place has quite a following as the line continued to grow as we were eating.

All the diners in this area suck so today I was exploring outside my usual sub-par comfort zone in the hopes of finding a gem. And I did!1. The coffee was HOT. I mean piping. A+2. Food was on point. We ordered the Greek omelet and a corned beef Reuben. A3. Randomly ordered a vanilla egg cream and it was such a delicious treat, perfectly done and light.

Updated review","after stumbling across a video of some dude eating at this place, my friend Shelton and I decided to say hello again to our friend Joe, with the mission this time being to try the burger (last time we needed some bacon and eggs after a night out). as my love for cheeseburgers has grown (and continues to grow) over the years, I've fostered a belief that ""nyc-diner-burger"" should be a recognized category of burger alongside ""the fast food burger"" ""the fast casual burger"" ""the bar & grill burger"" and ""the fancy restaurant burger"" (does nobody else see burgers this way? just me?). much like its running mates, the nyc diner burger has its own character - no fancy names, meat available from only 2, 3 animals at best, bun certainly not sourced locally from the artisan bakery in brooklyn, etc. essentially it will more or less be the same burger whatever diner you're in, and your expectations should be leveled accordingly before purchased. that being said - Joe makes a darn, darn good diner burger (a standout, perhaps?). i had the feeling this was going to be the case as soon as I was asked how i wanted it cooked (not something you're always asked at diners, trust me). I always order my burger medium rare, which is sorta this weird risk i always take if im being honest, because im always a lot more upset when my burger comes out more medium than i am when it comes out more rare. this burger was leaning a tad rare, but it was still the perfect temperature, and had a nice little crust on the outside, too. oh, and my coveted american cheese was on both the top and bottom of the burger - not standard procedure. just to warn you, if you have issues with the bottom of the bun soaking in juice, or getting burger juice all over those fries (delightfully creamy and crispy, tonight), don't order your burger medium rare. anyway, i agree with the other reviews here that if you care about ambiance (place is small, interior is dated, but in almost a cozy way... though they did have it decorated for christmas today lol) or formal customer service don't come here. otherwise, at a little over 8 dollars for a deluxe cheeseburger with fries, I would highly, highly recommend going to this place over a fast-casual burger place if you have the time.",1,1,1
59,Jay M.,"Jersey City, NJ",3,55,52,5.0,3/24/2018,This is a nice diner located near Gramercy. Many selections to choose from and very reasonable prices. Service was good and its pretty much the same diner food you would get anywhere else.,,,
60,Julianne G.,"Manhattan, NY",46,257,601,4.0,1/18/2017,"I came here after I looked up ""best NYC burger"" and saw it on a couple lists. It definitely wasn't one of the best burgers I've ever had, and not that memorable either. But it is good value for your money if you stick with the beef burger or cheeseburger. We got the burger on rye bread and the burger with avocado, jalapeños, and fried onions, each $10.20 deluxe (most expensive on the menu). The burger on rye was actually very good - just the same patty on a crunchy flatter bread. So if you're looking for texture definitely get that. But the other burger was falling apart. Also I was mistakenly expecting onion straws but instead the onions were pan-fried, so they had no crunchy texture to them. One thing I do have to warn about is that you'll leave the restaurant smelling like fried food! The waiter was nice, smiley and accommodating which I always appreciate.",,,
61,Kenneth K.,"Silver Spring, MD",3458,85,114,1.0,4/22/2017,"I avoid giving 1-star reviews but this place deserves it after me and two friends visited this past Saturday, April 15 in the evening.  I had a diet salad which had sardines, cottage cheese, and vegetables.  It was Passover so I was limited to what I could eat.  The salad was nothing that I couldn't easily make at home.  The salad I had from Hale & Hearty at Grand Central Station earlier that day was similarly priced and far much more tasty.   My friends didn't say anything good or bad about their food either.  However, the real reason for the 1-star was receiving the worst service I ever experienced.   Our waiter that night was not only extremely inattentive but dishonest and argumentative.  My friend got a tuna sandwich without the bun due to Passover and the waiter asked if he wanted tomato on it.  My friend asked him if it was extra and he said no.   When we got our receipts we came to the pay counter and he told him it should not be extra.   He said it was as it says on the menu and in fact showed him a different menu.  After my friend said he told him it was not extra and he cannot pay more than he agreed to pay, the waiter eventually gave in and me and him for the first times in our lives did not tip.   In  addition, the same (and only) waiter was arguing with another customer in the back of us when she clearly ordered a burger and he gave her a salad.  I went here because the prices were low, selection good for our Passover diet, and reviews were good.  My friend thought the good reviews were fake but indeed it seems from the more recent reviews that the service went down how hill.",12,5,7

They also engage in good small talk. Eh, I don't know if I would even consider it small talk actually. Some good conversations go down here...Great spot.

63,Donny H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,27,53,5.0,9/8/2017,Been coming here for over 18 years now. This place embodies the old new york coffee shop. The decor is old and nothing fancy if anyone is expecting some upscale modern trendy diner/coffee shop. Probably only around 8 or so tables but a nice wrap around counter to pitch up at if running solo or dont want to wait.  No reservations and it can get busy at times but well worth any wait. The turnover is quick as they get you in and out quick if you want. They also dont rush you if you end up squating for a bit w friends. The staff there is amazing and work extremely hard to accomodate any modifications.  Ive had friends come and ask for literally a stack of white toast and two sunny side eggs to bust over and they never say no to the random made up meal combinations. They are part of the overall experience and why there are so many of us in the neighborhood that frequent this spot. Ive had the pleasure of being such a regular i just usually pitch up and ill have a coffee and large water in front of me before i put my bags down. The food? Amazing diner food with breakfast being what i value most about Joe jr. They make some of the most amazing pancakes and french toast. Bacon nice and crispy off the flat top. Eggs are always cooked perfect to order. Sausage are the split links they deep fry and crust up off the flat top after they split longways.If you find yourself here later in the day or not in a breakfast mood the burgers are seriously legit for a diner burger. You can never go wrong w one and extra crispy fries. Prices are really reasonable and among cheapest ive seen at a new york diner.,,,

The workers here are really nice and the prices are beyond reasonable. I have visited this place on several occasions and all of those times have been excellent.

I opened up yelp (of course) and found this little gem on the nearby list. We walked in and it felt like the place and the waitstaff had been there forever (in a good way). All of the waitstaff were friendly and the restaurant was very clean. I decided on the blueberry pancakes, sausage, and coffee, and my fiance decided on the pancakes and eggs. It literally took more time for us to decide what we wanted than for them to make our breakfast, perfectly cooked and delicious. I was impressed not only with the quickness of the food, but also with the quality. My pancakes were cooked to perfection and the breakfast sausage I ordered was not only huge, but also very flavorful and slightly crispy on the edges.

I had the turkey meat loaf with mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and lentil soup. Meatloaf is an iffy thing at most establishments, but this meatloaf was wonderful! Steamed broccoli is steamed broccoli, but the broccoli was prime. The mashed potatoes I ate naked as butter or gravy would only have spoiled them. I take Joe Jr to be a Greek establishment as I observed the obligatory framed photo of The Acropolis. I bet that they could whip up some mighty fine Greek cuisine also!",,,

76,Sarah S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,3,0,1.0,12/2/2016,"My experience last night warranted me to finally sign up for Yelp and leave a review -- which is saying something as I've been avoiding creating an account for years. My friend and I decided that we were craving diner food, so instead of going to our regular place, we went to Joe Jr. since the Yelp reviews were so good.Everything started out good -- the food came out fast, it was all at least mediocre (but that's what you expect with diner food, so no problems there). By the time we wanted to get our check, it was difficult to get our waiter's attention. For such a small space, this would seem impossible, but he managed to avoid our eye contact and ""excuse me's"" for about 15 minutes. Finally, he stopped by and asked for our check. 20 minutes pass, and he looks at us and says, ""Oh!"" since he forgot about our check. We give him our card and we wait. As we are waiting, a COCKROACH crawls out of the wall onto our table. We stand up to head to the register, all the while the cockroach gets on top of the dessert plates (the dessert was incredibly sub-par, so at least someone got to enjoy it).I tell our waiter ""There's a cockroach on our table"" over and over, but he seems entirely indifferent. Part of this may have been due to the slight language barrier, but I point and say ""There's a bug on our food"" he walks over and looks at it, smiles and says, ""Have a good night!"" This sounds so absurd that I can't even believe it happened? I am absolutely baffled.

I've dined here once and attempted to dine here two other times (I explain below). I had breakfast here and I thought to myself, ""I'll be safe and order eggs over easy. Can't mess up eggs right?."" It was definitely nothing to write home about. Eggs were not even close to over easy, service was from an old and grumpy guy and fries had no flavor. Cheapest breakfast I've ever had though in NYC. I then attempted to go there twice after that; both a year apart from each other. Both times I sat at the counter (instead of a table like before) and both times I saw...don't read this if you're eating...a roach! Yes. Both times I hadn't ordered anything yet. The first time it crawled across the counter and I got up and left. The second time, a year later (I swore I'd never be back but the other diner down the block closed down and so I thought I would give this another try). This time, as I'm sitting there ready to ask for a menu, I glance down and there is one upside down and dead just lying there on the counter tucked up against the cakes pantry. I got up and ran. I'm glad these places still exist in a society where the greasy spoon is a dying breed but the sight of that will forever disgust me and I of course will never ever be back again.",,,

My friend from North Carolina said that she felt like she was back at home, so definitely rocking that true Americana diner feel up in this joint.

Chipped formica, faded wood paneling, a grill that has seen better days. Yep, this is a greasy spoon alright but in a way that makes it a pleasing destination for the less than persnickety among us and the kind of friendly diner that would be the polar opposite of the Westway Diner where my friends and I were recently treated abominably (review: bit.ly/1rsIaX1).

It wasn't too busy so I just sat at the counter and reviewed what had to be one of the longer diner menus I'd ever read. Burgers. Breakfasts. Triple Decker Sandwiches. Shrimp Creole (photo: bit.ly/1AJBswx). But I was in the mood for some eggs and taters.You have to love a place that has a glass of ice water in front of you within ten seconds of your arrival. The clientele is quite diverse here - old-time regulars talking up the servers, hipsters in hangover mode, and start-up geeks staring into their smartphones. I don't know if I was speaking with Joe Sr., but I asked him what was in a Joe Jr. Omelette at which point he recited a litany of ingredients - mushrooms, green peppers, onions, ham, tomatoes, some cheese (photo: bit.ly/1p3tIwW). Sounded good to me, and for $7.60, I got quite a pile of grilled, buttered potatoes, a couple of slices of toast already buttered and a heaping cup of hot coffee (photo: bit.ly/1psy59O). I also ordered a small $1.35 glass of orange juice since I was well under ten bucks for the whole meal.

Coffee, egg sandwich, pancakes, and two eggs over easy. All delicious, simple, and made right in front of you.

I recommend sitting at the bar with a newspaper for the full experience! Also, compared to the other diners in the Gramercy area, this is by far the best. Often lines on the weekend, so go before noon or after one to be seated immediately.This is a small, cozy diner with a friendly, bustling staff (they are the NICEST guys!) and a group of regulars, who are real neighborhood characters. Makes me think of too many Seinfeld episodes to count.Also, the food at Joe Jr's is great. They have the best matzah ball soup (surprising, I know) and their over-easy eggs are consistently cooked perfectly. The turkey bacon sandwich is also a knock-out, with thick layers of bacon, tomato, lettuce, and avocado on your choice of bread. You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.I would give 5 stars except that the place has a real diner-smell that lingers on your body and clothes for at least a few hours, if not more, even after leaving.

100,John H.,"Toronto, Canada",9,101,37,4.0,5/3/2015,"Another stop in our search for a great burger. The place is nothing much to look at, an old school diner that hasn't been updated or falsely tarted up. This is a working diner. We were there on a quiet Saturday afternoon. The staff were attentive and friendly, and having some relaxed off-peak conversations with familiar drop-in acquaintances (all in Spanish).  We kept it pure and had a couple of cheese burgers - cooked medium. And Joe Junior did not disappoint. Great beef patty, dripping with juice - lettuce, tomato, and pickle.We decided we like the thinner patty here - as opposed to the more trendy baseball style. Cooked right - and it was - you can get it in your mouth without contortions, and there is a nice crispy outside to red interior ratio. The next time I go back I am going to have the burger with avocado, onions and jalapenos. Built on the base of this kind of beef -  I can only imagine. (UPDATE: We went back and had this burger and it is as good as it sounds. We had it medium rare - which was maybe a little bloody for some tastes but it was delicious. This place is a gem!)  I'm not big on the kind of nostalgia where people falsely remember that things were better in the past - even when it wasn't. But do yourself a favor and go to Joe Junior. It's like the motto of the Society for Creative Anachronism. ""The past, not as it was, but as it should have been.""I think the review (linked below) on eater is a pretty good piece of food writing - if you are interested. It really puts this burger in the context of the current fancy burger madness. ny.eater.com/2015/4/17/8…",2,,

When entering, a feeling comes over you, like you're in  another era. The staff was friendly and professional, yet laid back without heirs. It's sweet that such a non-pretentious eatery with classy old-time menu choices still exists. Speaking of sweet, their banana cream pie is phenomenal or maybe you'll like a nice slice of tarty key lime pie to accompany your strong coffee. My favorite entree is the chicken crockets with green beans, mashed potatoes and gravy. Don't forget a salad with blue cheese dressing and croutons. Split pea soup is always a nice starter too. Last time I ate there, they used a beveled red glass to fill with my ginger ale. All in all, it was a retro-classic experience with traditional food fare worth enjoying on an occasion.",,,

Pancakes are thick and fluffy, omelettes and filled and well-done. The hash-browns are classic, delicious and filling. The ham/cheeseburgers are fantastic whether la plancha is utilized or not. The fries extra-crispy are just divine. The coffee is bold, satisfying, and full-flavored, not to mention never-ending. The staff is consistently hard-working and fun, ready to serve with a smile and an ice water. They take cash and card, and the prices are extremely reasonable. Recommended!",1,,
109,Tarneka M.,"New York, NY",14,77,0,2.0,11/28/2017,"Thrillist brought me here I was none too thrilled. This review is for 11-28-17. I dined here with my son during lunch after 12. It was a decent space  reminiscent of old school dining like Woolworth back in the day. It was not too busy. We had a seat in less than 5 minutes. I solely came here for the burger . We placed our order. I ordered the cheeseburger deluxe and my son ordered the bacon cheeseburger. Our food arrives . My son's burger was devoid of bacon. I told the waiter I ordered a bacon cheeseburger. He looked at me , and said ok. I barely had any fries as well. Come on Joe Jr. My burger was well done and I asked for medium well. I tried to make the best of the meal but was disappointed. On a scale of one to ten my son rated his burger a five. My rating is a 4.5. A burger at Wendy's I would rate a 5.5 and that's fast food. My burger also had an unpleasant back taste ugh. I wish I had the burger that everyone is raving about. The burger tasted a little better when I bit the pickle between bites. That pickle gets an A plus in my opinion.",,,

For some reason, I had expected a chunkier, thicker burger, but this was flattened for extra surface area.

133,Brad G.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,23,0,4.0,7/2/2015,"The burger is good. Thanks to Nick Solares at Eater's reporting on this burger, I knew to request that my burger be grilled without the use of an iron plancha, which would have made it cook faster but drained it of its essential juices. As such, rivers of juice flowed with every burger bite, onto the plate and onto my new pants. The crispy bacon was tasty, though unnecessary. What was most impressive about this burger, aside from its juiciness and the brilliant hue of red within its patty, was the method with which the cheese was melted onto it. On both sides of the bun, the cheese is melted directly onto the bun as the patty grills above. The process allows for the bun to fuse to the patty through its cheese glue. I love little more than a burger that becomes a meat, cheese, and bread singularity by the time I'm nearing its end.This burger sounds great, right? Well, the truth is that it's just good. Flashes of Corner Bistro ran through my mind as I ate it, which makes sense as the meat here comes from the same source. But what more likely made me think of Corner Bistro was that this burger is of the exact same ilk as that one. Corner Bistro knows that people go there for their burger, and so they have created a burger that suits most people. Joe Junior has done the same thing. Solares says,""It's everything the cheeseburger needs to be and nothing else."" That's exactly what it is, and for someone like me, that's the recipe for a fun and nostalgic diversion, but nothing else.I respect what this burger is and what it represents (I also respect Joe Junior's crispy, greasy french fries), and as a cheap neighborhood diner you'd be hard pressed to find anything better. It's not going to be on the top of any objective person's list of best burgers in the city, but it deserves to be known for what it is.",2,,1
134,Sudeep P.,"New York, NY",6,8,1,5.0,6/21/2015,"This is a great joint. One of the last surviving staples of its kind in the East Village if not the entire city. The food portions are great and extremely filling. They're also well priced for what you get, very affordable. What makes Joe's such a great place has got to be the staff, the waiters at the counters, the cook. They're extremely friendly and memorize orders. Many a time I've entered without explicitly ordering and they knew what I always wanted, always double checking with me to make sure. They're kind, courteous and extremely friendly. Joe's is one of a kind and you don't want to miss out!Update: After eating here consistently over the last year, I can say with 100% confidence, this is the best diner in New York City, nothing can compete with their hospitality and treatment. Whether you are dining here alone, with friends, or with family, you are treated very well. Joe's gives me a reason to wake up in the morning in anticipation of their food, the environment and their smiles. Joe's is a one of a kind diner which will not be matched in the city. I cannot say enough good things about this establishment. Enjoy them while you can, savor every bite. For me, I want to thank the restaurant for giving me my morning cup of joe, with a dose of Joe's.

Fries were nothing special, if not subpar due to lots of short, dry pieces. Was not double fried but hey I came here for the burger so whatever.

Well, you could settle for a nibble at IHOP... or you could spend some QT with Joe Jr.Situated in Gramercy, ol' Joe decided to brave the conditions and feed the masses who needed one last hot meal before resorting to a life of ramen and granola bars. Slingin' faves like burgers (yum!), pancakes, and any other comfort food item, it's always a solid choice for a quick, no fuss bite.They also deliver, so if you want a greasy spoon meal delivered right to your pad, they'll hop on one of those nifty battery-powered bikes in moments.",14,15,10

154,Thomas H.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,12/4/2016,"Overall, I was severely disappointed by the rudeness, lack of professionalism, and abrasiveness of the waiter, who pressured me to leave my table and eventually the restaurant from the moment I sat down until I finally finished my food.  I can understand the desire to serve more customers for the sake of more tip money, but I expect a minimum level of customer service.To provide more background, I arrived at 10:50am, and waited 15 minutes to be seated. To start (complaint #1) After sitting for 3 minutes for a party of 2, the waiter comes over and demands that I move to the bar. I tell him my friend is joining me within 1-2 minutes, and he says 'if he isn't here in a minute I will make you move to the bar [a single seat on the edge crammed against the coat rack].' In a gesture of good faith, I order food on our behalf. My friend arrives within a minute, as I communicated, and we place additional food orders. (Complaint #2) The waiter never returns throughout our entire meal to check on us or provide refills on our coffee - until we finally flag him down after 30 minutes.  Once we finish our food 50 min into being seated, the waiter comes to clear our table, I provide a 30% tip, and (complaint #3) the waiter immediately demands that we leave the restaurant for other customers to be seated (no 5 minute grace period to finish our coffee or conversation).Now, the food is always a good value, and is promptly served, which is why I have given this establishment my repeated business.  But I do not plan to return after this treatment.  I came to the restaurant to have a meaningful conversation with a friend, and was truly disappointed in the distracting pressure the waiter exerted throughout.",2,,

157,Joanna W.,"Queens, NY",130,11,10,4.0,9/12/2016,"In attempt to satisfy my diner craving, I looked through reviews and this place is a really nice hideaway from the bustling Union Square area. Food was less than 20 for mostly everything, and a meal for two can definitely fit under the 20 dollar range. I got a Chicken Parma with Spaghetti, while my companion ate a Philly Cheese Steak. The Chicken Parm was pretty good-- very savory and has a strong essence of tomatoes. The sauce went everywhere but it was good! The Philly Cheese Steak came with many sides-- reasons why I love diners has shown itself to me once again. The bread was a bit strange and I expected crunchier, but it was still good to eat. Always eat while hot!!",,,

I've been coming here for years and the staff and interior have not changed. When you walk inside it's something from the past, the tacky wood walls with mirrors, the old school cash register and just about everything here are from a different era, in a good way!Want a burger? This is your spot. Want something else on the menu customized to how you want it? You got it. The waiters are attentive and the food here is simple but has that authentic, great diner taste to it. My suggestions? Go for the breakfast, they serve up a good, old fashioned American breakfast here, you can't go wrong any way as well as the burgers and beef souvlaki. They don't make places like this anymore!",1,,

165,Taylor N.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,1,5.0,8/26/2014,"I had walked by this place a bunch of times and never stopped in thinking it was just another NYC deli. This morning I had some extra time so I decided to give it a shot. I took a seat at the counter and was greeted quickly with a menu, water and a smile. I could tell the server was eyeing me from the other side of the counter as I was checking out the menu, ready to take my order but without hover directly over me. I got a western omelet, home fries, toast, and a coffee. The coffee was better than I expected and the milk was fresh and in a cold container, not the little plastic packages. As I was waiting for my food which did not take long at all I noticed that regulars kept coming in and getting to go orders while have quick friendly chats with the staff. Clearly this is a neighborhood favorite place which I always take as a good sign. My food arrived hot and all at the same time. The omelet was a generous size and cooked perfectly. The potatoes were crispy and burnt around the edges but soft in the middle. As soon as I finished my plates were cleared and the check was there. Very promptly but I never felt rushed. I knew the prices when I ordered but it didn't hit me how cheap this place was until I paid. Very great value here. All of this is very typical of a diner breakfast but I've been surprised at how many places can get it wrong. Not Joe Jr., I'd recommend it to anyone and I will definitely be back. Soon!",1,,2
166,Elyssa J.,"Manhattan, NY",300,590,142,3.0,1/22/2015,"Super cheap and dingy dinner that serves up a solid carb heavy breakfast.Though busy, my friends and I were able to grab a table for five of us pretty quickly.  While the last three friends arrived about 10 minutes later, the service was inexcusably slow and at times pretty frustrating. It took forever to get water and we had to flag down the waiter to take our order. 45 minutes later our food finally arrived. Breakfast (a sober one especially) should not take this long.Other than the ridiculous wait, the food was pretty solid and the atmosphere was very comfortable. I'd give Joe Jr. another chance.",,,
167,Cynthia S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,2.0,11/24/2016,I love the burger at this diner. They are juicy and generous with the bacon. Ok now the reason that this place deserves 2 stars. The place is filthy with dirt and dust and flies all over the place. The flies are always buzzing around your food. My waiter kept wiping his runny nose and touching my food and gave me a very undercooked burger with blood oozing out. I sent it back but then they burned the burger to a crisp. My other experiences at this place were just fine though except the condition of the dirty place. This is a good restaurant if only the waiters listen and they just clean the place up a little bit.,1,,

The sausage they served is the link type which I prefer over the patty.

Highly recommended this for quick and good breakfast.",,,
172,Tanya D.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,241,60,5.0,7/10/2015,"Burger enthusiasts have talked about the hamburger here. And it's a good burger at a reasonable price. Better than your average diner burger, that's for sure. But what gives this place my five stars is just the ambiance. Diners like this are a dying breed, and it's like stepping into old New York. It smells a little stale in there, everything is old and weathered with time. Even the customers you can tell are people that have been going there for decades. You aren't going to see investment bankers in power suits walking in there to have a business lunch. Which is why I LOVE this place. The kind of place where jello with whipped cream is still a staple on the menu. I probably wouldn't order that, but it comforts me to know it's there, that there still exists a place where that is an option. The guys behind the counter are friendly and fast, and I don't doubt that they have a million stories to tell. I wish more places like this existed. I consider Joe Jr.'s to be a national treasure.",2,,1

My belly was full with scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, and plenty of tabasco.  On my way to work, I was thinking I should start every morning off with that plate of deliciousness.  I took off a star because for what it was, it is a bit expensive.  BUT given the neighborhood, it's an oasis.  I will put the star back on.",3,2,3

Highly recommend this place..  Whatever they're doing they're doing it right! The Sauteed onions were so richly caramelized I forgot the were there.. until the flavor of the sweet sweet onions hit me and I looked at my sandwich to see what was commanding my attention.So yeah... the place is pretty dope, the staff is super chill and i'll swing by before I leave for sure.

At that point I tried to be civil n asked that he take the omelet off the plate. He took the plate, held it over the trash, scrapped the omelet off n put the plate back down in front of me with the remainder of my order. At that point I was done.
