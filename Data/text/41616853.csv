A friendly neighborhood dive bar.  Place was quiet 4 PM on a Thursday.About ten taps with a good selection including Guinness, Oomegang, Crispin cider.  Back bar has limited selection.Several flatscreens tuned to sports.  Music semi loud - a mix of current pop and some oldies.If I was a local, I would be a regular customer.",2,,
1,Emily D.,"New York, NY",40,189,340,4.0,5/15/2017,Came here one night late because its close to my apartment. This place is small but has a TV on just about every wall. I was only in there for about an hour or two but I really liked it. They placed music but not too loud so you couldn't talk or hear your friends.They have a board up that tells you what the specials or events are going on which day. I believe Tuesday is trivia and Thursday is karaoke. I'd really like to try it out on one of those nights! They currently aren't open on Sundays but I believe once football starts up they will be.,1,,

Me and my family stopped in for apps and they were okay. As  far as the food? ....well im afraid you will have to wait till next time folks. Thats all i have to say except that its also nice and upbeat here but their also short on staff which could always be fixed . I had the mozzarella sticks and boneless buffalo tenders(believe me when i say i feel you guys when you just want some buffalo with no bone!!) thats all i have for right now! Be sure to stay updated.",,,

5,Rob S.,"Manhattan, NY",42,264,92,3.0,8/5/2016,"Stopped in a few times.  It's a nice bar, nothing special, kind of on the small side which is something I like.  Same bartender has been there when I have been there, she is very friendly and pours a proper Guinness.  Pouring a proper Guinness is becoming a lost art in this city.  The rest of the beer selection was, ""Meh.""  Very one note, nothing out of the ordinary.  Other people at the bar were drinking Coors Light and PBR cans.  I don't understand that but anyway.  Most of the people come here work in one of the area hospitals as this place is in the middle of hospital land.  I like it, will go back and recommend to colleagues.  I just wish the beer selection was better.N.B. - I have not eaten there yet.",2,1,
6,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,3.0,3/19/2015,"""Who says that it is a bad idea to have drinks during your lunch break""This is a pretty simple sports bar in the part of the UES where people dont really visit. So, it is pretty quiet (at least in the afternoon). To be perfectly honest, I only come here because my job is around the corner (sometimes I want a liquid lunch) but I would not venture to the UES just to have a beer or five here. However, the bartenders are pretty cool, the bar has a few decent beers, and many random varieties  of Absolut bMost of the clientele are people who live in the vicinity and/or associated with Cornell or Sloan Kettering. They have lunch specials, which are 3 different stews. However, I cannot speak about the food here. The space is small but it has a cozy old school type of feel to it. Plus, there usually is some sort sport on TV.",,1,
7,Christine B.,"Dunellen, NJ",83,195,459,4.0,4/9/2016,"They kind of look like your neighborhood bar but we didn't come by for drinks. We decided to try out their burgers via take out. The prices were decent considering the size of the burgers that we ordered. Two orders were basic cheeseburgers (angus burgers) and the other was the marinara burger. The burgers were cooked exact to our requests. Portion wise, they were pretty big so it was very filling. Flavor wise, I thought it was ok. The service was friendly and they were also good in informing us if delays with food orders because there were a lot of orders put in around the same time. Overall, a nice place to just hang for a bit with some nice folks to chat with.",,,
8,Ken S.,"Charlotte, NC",0,24,0,1.0,3/5/2017,"This review is only for food.  I went there to eat wings and watch the game.  I ordered wings and some sweet potato fries.  Oh my goodness.  If I wanted to eat precooked, then frozen wings, I would go to Wal Mart and buy some in a bag and heat them up in my oven in my apartment! I despise going to places that don't even cook their own food.  Disgusting!  The people are friendly here, but man is the food horrible if you are looking for real food.",,,

10,Evelyn W.,"Manhattan, NY",359,237,363,4.0,4/9/2015,Was here last night and they were filming an episode of Barmageddon. Small cozy place where the bartenders all seem very friendly. Good cheap drinks! I had a $3 bud light which is sort of unheard of in manhattan! They were also giving out free shots because of the show.Would definitely like to go back there when there is no film crew and see what it's like!,4,4,5
11,Nichole W.,"New York, NY",11,38,46,4.0,3/27/2015,"Went for my first time last night with a big group of friends. Have yet to visit a bar quite like this one- it has several TVs on each wall so regardless of seating, you won't miss the game- great drink specials and solid food menu. Unlike other bars in the city, you can have a conversation without shouting at the person you are there with. It is tiny but it has a cozy feel and you don't have to worry about being pushed around by it being overly packed. A very comfortable spot to go have a beer and wings and watch a game",2,,1
12,Edgar A.,"ASTORIA, NY",46,137,653,4.0,4/18/2013,"I've been to my share of sports bars. The sports team decor, the touch screen games, and the Guinness on draft are necessities that every sports bar, including this one has. However, I have never been to a sports bar that has employees that are even nearly as friendly as this place. Most sports bars I have frequented are just okay with hiring well-endowed woman who will politely pander to your conversation, and basically touch the surface of any meaningful one. However, this place is full of employees, and regulars, who are more than willing to make you feel as if they have not only known you for quite some time, but that its okay to be drinking at 1:00pm on a Saturday. If you are looking for a guy's (or girls) night out with your 4-5 friends, want to catch a game, and don't mind being in a slightly cramped environment, this place is where you should go. As long as one or two of them are good at ""crowd controlling"" your small group, you will all have a great time.However, if you have more than 5 people, and you everyone else expects to get inebriated to whole other level, you should probably save yourself the trouble, and go to a bigger venue where you have a lower probability of bothering anybody else. Overall, I dig this place, and I can definitely see myself coming back sometime again.",4,,
13,Brittany A.,"New York, NY",73,661,13,5.0,1/14/2015,"My new favorite neighborhood sports bar.  $15 for a pitcher of beer and a plate of wings, I don't think a place could get cheaper than that.  Other than that, each day they have drink specials.  Although the food is just sub-par the cozy cabin like environment and the multiple TVs make this a great neighborhood joint.",2,,2
14,Sara G.,"Manhattan, NY",101,225,8,3.0,11/18/2012,"The Allie Way is a great local spot, and nearly everyone who hangs out there is a regular. On weeknights you can see people playing beer pong and building towers out of coasters. The bartenders are solid and friendly.It's just a tiny little place with maybe 15 barstools and a few high tops where you can get standard drinks and the usual suspects of bar food - wings, cheese sticks, chicken strips, etc. They have tons of TVs and will turn on any game you want. On a Saturday afternoon I had no trouble finding a barstool and getting the University of Texas game turned on.Free wifi, and you can often find people working away on their laptops over a beer during the day.",6,,
15,Amare A.,"New York, NY",166,11,1,5.0,3/1/2016,I'm a regular. All the staff are attentive and fun to talk to. It's a neighborhood bar with the younger crowd of the area. They have pretty good burgers and wings. Trivia night on Tuesday evenings is always fun. Thursday evening karaoke is great as well.,,,
16,Rafael V.,"Miami, FL",0,5,0,5.0,1/1/2017,"Happened upon this little gem while taking an evening walk with my family.  It is a throw back to what neighborhood bars were years ago.  A place where the bartender knows all the locals by name and treat the newcomers as locals.  Good selection of beer and liquor and above average food.  We had wings, burgers, chicken sandwiches and salads.  The food was great.  I wish I lived there so I could frequent it on a regular basis.",,,
17,Rajat S.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",12,6,0,3.0,8/5/2013,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who've pointed out that the employees here are friendly. Dan and the other girl (She's very nice and I just forgot her name!) are great. The bar's patronage mostly comprises of graduate and medical students of Weill Cornell (read young professional school crowd). The food here can be between below average (their nachos) to very good (chicken sandwich). In terms of the beer selection, Allie Way can never compete with the likes of Pony Bar just 5 blocks away but the environment of the bar makes up for anything it lacks. They used to have the 'Tripel Horse' on tap (River Horse brewery) which was one of the reasons I loved going here. Unfortunately, that was replaced with a cider and some other generic stuff (I'm being nit picky now!) and I'm waiting for it to come back. I also love any bar that tries to show European soccer. This place is good to catch the late afternoon mid-week Champions League games and reruns of the EPL in the evenings. Good place for American Football and Baseball as well. As mentioned elsewhere it is the ASU bar in the area which might be of some appeal to the sun devils.Another point to mention is the Trivia night Tuesday evenings and Karaoke night one of the other evenings. Both often pull in decent crowds if you care for these kinds of events! All in all, Allie Way is a nice little neighborhood joint with a fairly cozy atmosphere, standard array of beers on tap, sports and friendly bar tenders!I really wish the Beer was a dollar or two cheaper. If it were I would have given this place 4 stars!",2,,

19,Chad C.,"New York, NY",28,83,2,3.0,10/18/2012,Needed a place with football on the UES near Hunter College on a Sunday.  Seemed to be full of Giants fans and would be a 4 star if I was a Giant's fan but probably won't go back.  Good specials that we took advantage of with the wings and beer for $15.  I'm from upstate NY and know good wings.  These were pretty good quality with a good flavor.  Check in through Yelp for a deal also!  Good steady service and they set up beer pong in the back which I would have enjoyed if we had more time to hang out.,1,,1
20,Christopher D.,"New York, NY",0,28,2,1.0,8/1/2014,The sign out front for $5 drafts?  Yeah that doesn't apply to all beers.  This would be fine if they told you before handing you your tab that the beers you ordered are actually $10 apiece.,1,,
21,Michael K.,"Berkeley, CA",0,2,0,5.0,4/15/2015,"very nice for proximity to the hospital. 10% discount is better than nothing. their burgers. extremely underrated, extremely satisfying. A+. small selection of beers on tap (usually always have Bud Light, Guinness, Angry Orchard, Delirium, and a few other domestic ones, and have a rotating set, either domestic, local, or import, and also a surprisingly large quantity of bottled beers. food other than burgers are average, but certainly better than that of Murphy's Law, the bar next door. Murphy's might be bigger and may have more TVs, but its not as homey as Allie Way. definitely would recommend.",,,

24,Johanna C.,"New York, NY",120,157,72,3.0,9/30/2012,"Came here to watch some football games on Sunday and was pleasantly surprised.  They have some great Sunday football food and drink specials.  The best deal is a dozen wings and a pitcher of beer for $15.  I also used their $5 for $10 yelp deal, so the food and drink was pretty cheap.It is not very large, so don't bring a big group here, but it would be great for a group of 2-4 to watch some games.  They have directv, so they had around 4 different games playing on their 6 (i think) screens.It is pretty far east, so I don't think it gets too busy since it's not very centrally located.",,,

26,Solomon W.,"Austin, TX",556,2581,7,4.0,7/11/2012,"The Allie Way Sports Bar is honestly one of the most iconic dive bars I have been to. First, it is located in a district not very saturated with cool watering holes. Moving on, it has a limited amount of drinks but reasonable specials served by some cool cats. Lastly, it is sporty and has a cheesy name to match.The grub is your standard pub grub, but the people are what make the place a good neighborhood bar.Give it a shot if you are in the Upper East Side and are just hankering for a great local joint at which to get your drink on before or after the game. Not many tourists seem to make their way off of the beaten path, to boot. I am a tourist, and I was brought here by a UES local. Nice.",,,
27,Joe S.,"Waldwick, NJ",2,36,4,4.0,6/27/2013,Nice bar. Stopped for lunch while visiting hospital. Basic lunch with pork chop and rice and beans for 3 was under $20. Even with a shared appetizer and 4 beers bill was only $45.,1,,

The TV's had all the major games playing so you don't miss a second of any game while catching up with your friends!

Good, cheap drink specials! Lots of tv's too. It's not huge, but it feels more spacious than it actually is. Definitely a go to place to just relax and have a few drinks after work.",,,
34,Drake M.,"Manhattan, NY",3,18,0,3.0,7/16/2012,"If you're an Upper East Side bar regular or have been visiting someone at NYP hospital you have probably been to this bar. You walk in and what you see is what you get. In its current regeneration the former dive bar has given rise to a sports pub. Still a small cozy bar; it's been painted and the clutter stripped, updated its stools, chairs, & tables, the decoration is sparse a Lin Jersey and Yankee flag with a couple college pennants, multiple flat screen TV's surround you.  The crowd is a mix of neighborhood regulars and hospital related employees this place has its share of quirky characters and it can be a bit of an old man bar in the afternoon, at night the gives way to a younger crowd and the medical students for trivia or karaoke. Bar games are minimal. They do offer food that is Mexican/Latin meets a pub fare menu and is pretty good. The bartenders are friendly and candid. The Beer selection is fairly standard with a couple higher alcohol content beers on tap.  They have a full bar that favors certain brands, but not a lot of varieties. The prices are high for a side street bar more in line with the larger avenue bars and the pours are text book. This can be redeemed by the fact they are often running specials on select beers and drinks. It's one true sin for a sports bar is while they do have the games and multiple TV's they are in standard definition not the Hi Def the TV's are capable ofThings I like: comfortable, good atmosphere, glassware, friendly, good foodThings that I Dislike: Small space, lack of HD, priced a little high for being on a side st.",1,,

36,Mark A.,"Bangor, ME",160,246,34,4.0,9/17/2012,Clutch spot for watching games with cheap beers and significantly better than average bar food.  The wings were tender with a bit of heat and a zip of citrus for a twist...quite good.  Super friendly wait staff.  Just wished they had turned down the volume on the primary game as it was difficult to hear your own conversations.  Will come back for trivia and the specialty Spanish food during the week.,,,

The staff is beyond friendly, the bartenders make great drinks, they have the NFL ticket, lots of tv screens, and also show other sports (you can ask to turn on a particular game and they are more than happy to accommodate). The music is fun and cheery, the atmosphere has a very warm, community feel.

39,Ellen F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,35,18,4.0,12/1/2011,"I found The Allie Way because livingsocial had a $20 for $10 voucher and I thought I'd give it a go.  This sports bar is small, bright, and cozy.  By small, I mean that the bar has the bar and about three-four cocktail tables with chairs.  There are more flat screens than there are tables.  They had Blue Moon on draft -- always a good thing in my book.  They also had guinness, two types of Sam Adams drafts and I forgot the other two.  The menu is limited to pub food so clearly this place is not a casual restaurant and it didn't seem that there was anything over $15.  I split a Blitz burger with fries and Nachos and chicken with a friend.  The burger was excellent and the fries were the big kind but they weren't soggy.  The Nachos was a huge helping with lots of chicken pieces and pita chips and sour cream.  It's a healthier version of nachos but someone forgot that you gotta have salsa.  When I requested it I got some kind of soupy tomato chile thing, not salsa.  It was okay, not a deal breaker.I went on a Wednesday night so they had a trivia game going on. The place was bright because of that -- not Kmart bright but enough to see the paper in front of you.  The place was comfortable.  I'd go again, even if I didn't have a voucher.",1,,

A joke to call the Allie Way a sport bar with only 7 small TVs and management that is so poor, they will choose to dedicate all 7 tv's to local sports available on regular tv. If they guarantee they will show your game, you call 4 1/2 hours ahead of your game, wait 2 1/2 hours to see your game, they will still flip to another channel with 5 minutes into your game and no time to go to a real sports bar. They are rude, rude, rude with absolutely no customer service and a loudmouth manager! Go elsewhere - just walk up 2nd Avenue and ANY other place (sports bar, pub, tavern, dive bar, etc.) will treat you better! By the way...
