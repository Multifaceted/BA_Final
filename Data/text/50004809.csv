0,Meat L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0.0,5.0,10/17/2018,Started with the nachos and they didn't disappoint. Get the breakfast sandwich. Amazing. Friends got the BLT and the Reuben. Both enjoyed. We saw a bunch of other things on the menu that looked good so we're planning on going back. Meal is a little pricey but worth it.,,,
1,Carl C.,"Waterbury, CT",72,64,27,5.0,10/14/2018,Awesome place and a great concept! I throughly enjoyed the bacon tasting and flight! The beers were thoughtfully matched to the different bacons!I also enjoyed the tater tots with sausage gravy and bacon.The bartender was super friendly. We chatted about the Yankees and baseball in general! He was super helpful with all the food choices.I highly recommend you guys check this place out.,2,,
2,Cory B.,"Brooklyn, NY",37,109,672,5.0,10/13/2018,"Had a pretty bad afternoon the day I went to Bar Bacon and I didn't even know this place existed until I discovered it nearby while I was on my phone. I was looking for something to lighten my mood and since it had a lot of reviews I decided to try it out. Boy what a treat this place turned out to be!If you haven't guessed already, Bar Bacon is a gastropub where Bacon is the theme (gimmick) here. What you might not know though (as I did not know) is that they serve a selection of bacon based cocktails with bacon served in them! It's a really cool experience eating bacon with bourbon or rum in your mouth and its honestly a tasty contrast. I was so enthralled with the bacon cocktails I did not try any other drinks but I really enjoyed what I got. They also give you a good portion size for the price they sell them (at least compared to other more touristy bars I have been too recently.)The food here was pretty good as well, though maybe the portions were a less generous. Entree food ranges from 13-20 dollars in range, from what I remember, and I wasn't particular impressed by the sandwich size I got. Regardless though I did really enjoy the BLTs here and the plentiful amount of chips was enough to fill me up so I still had a positive experience foodwise.Not only were the drinks and food good but I really enjoyed the environment and service here. As I usually travel and eat at restaurants solo I was able to instantly get a bar seat here and I was quite happy the bar area had full service. The bartenders were really friendly, very attentive to everyone around the bar and were fairly quick to respond. The vibe I got from the music and aesthetic here was upbeat... the exact vibe I was looking for that day.Overall Bar Bacon is fantastic. I know bacon lovers will really get a kick out of this place like I did. If you don't enjoy bacon, then don't worry because even if you remove that gimmick Bar Bacon is really enjoyable gastropub in its own right.",3,,

4,Camille H.,"Brooklyn, NY",162,453,363,4.0,8/5/2018,"If you love bar bacon and aren't on a diet then this is the place for you. I enjoyed my soup and grilled cheese sandwich - we also got the ""flight"" of bacon (which was shared) and that was pretty yummy too.The bartender - who I think was the owner - was super friendly and accommodating to our time crunch. I would definitely go back.",2,,1
5,Derek M.,"Flushing, Queens, NY",441,175,271,4.0,7/16/2018,"Stopped by BarBacon on my way to another restaurant & really happy I stopped by with my friend! We came on a Saturday evening around 7pm and was seated immediately on a high table near the bar. The vibe inside is like a sports bar with a brewery with specialty bacon menu items. Definitely try the Bacon & Beer sampler! I really loved the Maple bacon & the Jalapeño bacon really left a strong impression on my taste palate. They even pair it with different beers, off the top of my head we had Goose Island IPA, Guiness, Montauk and forgot the last one.For my entree I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich, saw many people raving about it so I tried it myself. Flavor was great, but just a tad dry for me so I got a side of BBQ sauce and it made everything alright. Definitely want to try the rack of ribs next time! Staff was super accommodating & friendly.",2,1,1
6,Cheryl M.,"Birmingham, AL",187,502,912,4.0,6/27/2018,"I confess, we came here for the fried bacon. We tried it as an appetizer and it was good, just didn't blow me away. We were lucky to be here on taco Tuesday. The tacos were fantastic! We really loved them. I tried the fish and the grilled chicken. I really liked both of them. The grilled chicken had a lot of salsa verde which made it a bit spicy but the sour cream cooled it down. However, it was too spicy for hubby. I would definitely recommend getting the tacos. They were really loaded so two was enough for me. One of the kids got the bar bacon burger. She really liked it. The other kid got a blt which was huge. She really liked that too. One came with home made chips, one with french fries. Both were really good.Service was really slow but I literally think there was only one server the day we were there. Other than that, we really enjoyed our lunch here.",5,3,3
7,Patrick D.,"Chicago, IL",102,87,213,4.0,7/5/2018,"Having an entirely bacon-themed restaurant means a lot of hype to live up to, but BarBacon definitely delivered! I came here for dinner and a drink with my cousin while visiting for the night, and was super excited to try it. At 8:30pm on a Tuesday night, it was very lively and fun, with a fair amount of tables and the bar area in the center being pretty filled.I absolutely wanted a drink with bacon in it, so I got one of their signatures: the barbacon old fashioned that comes with an entire bacon strip floating in it. The drink was very tasty, and although I appreciated the bacon it was kind of weird with it covered in the drink. To eat, we started with their signature bacon flight- a couple strips of each of their 4 homemade bacons (I forgot some of the flavors, my bad!). Each was crisped well and super tasty, although they could have had stronger flavors because I had a bit of trouble distinguishing them. The star of the show, however, was definitely the barbacon burger that comes with two thick, delicious, guilty pleasure size slices of melt in your mouth bacon. The burger itself was big and tasty, cooked to a nice medium like I requested, but that oh so delicious bacon really overshadowed everything else. While I enjoyed the bacon flight and bacon cocktail, the burger is the one thing I would absolutely recommend here.I really enjoyed barbacon, from the food to the drinks to the fun bar atmosphere. Would totally go again for the burger as well as some of their other bacon enhanced dishes (the Kentucky fried bacon dishes sound life changing!)",2,,
8,Deb C.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,53,95,4.0,10/30/2018,"We came across this place when looking for Mexican food.  I know Mexican?? Anyways we went in.  I ordered the Bacon Bloody and my friend ordered the Jalapeño Margarita...tasty!  We also ordered the chicken wings, dry rub w/smoked blue cheese...yum n besides my friend doesn't do with spice too well (though she survived the margarita)!  We ordered the Chicharron Nachos...not what we expected.  Chicharron are the pork rinds that the sell in the store, disappointing n we only had 4 or so on the nachos, with some bacon bits.  Cheese was sparse n sparse, not sure if I would ever order again.  Atmosphere is good for a Friday, nice crowd n music is great!  Will visit again, luv the bacon options...want to try.",1,,
9,Jessica F.,"East Bronx, NY",2,4,1,1.0,10/28/2018,Came here to eat and one of the workers (Fernando) tried to talk to me. I told him I wasn't interested and he proceeded to curse me out. Not the kind of night I thought I was going to have. Left being upset and couldn't tell my boyfriend because things would've gotten was out of control. Ladies stay away from this place. The male workers are horrible and disrespectful!!,1,1,
10,Galya L.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,5,2,5.0,10/28/2018,"We randomly went in to this place for brunch and couldn't have been happier. Food, customer service was simply great. You need to try their fried pickles and mimosas (great $5 deal on them).",1,,1
11,Eris S.,"Lanham, MD",172,109,103,4.0,9/10/2018,"If you are in the NYC area and you love bacon you have to visit this restaurant. Bacon is an ingredient in all of the food items and some of the beverages. My group started with the burnt ends and Brussel sprouts. I had the Open Face Grilled Chicken Club. It was all delicious. The sandwich was huge so i only ate half of it. I also tried the lemonade and it wasn't so delicious. I sent it back and had a ginger ale. Food was great and we were too full for dessert. If you love bacon, this is a must try.",1,,1
12,Nancy T.,"Wilmington, DE",58,145,1232,5.0,6/14/2018,"I have found Heaven and ironically it's in Hell's Kitchen!After 2 Broadway shows in 1 day we wanted to stretch out legs from the hotel so we walked 8 blocks from our hotel to HEAVEN! Anyone who knows me knows how much I love bacon and how I try everything with it in it. This place is a must go must try must repeat go! Nothing fancy, just good food, good service, & chill atmosphere. I was shocked when I was KFB ... KENTUCKY FRIED BACON! But I was more drawn to the all-day breakfast burger. It was sooooooo delicious! The bacon was thick cut, it's on a pretzel bun, and my egg was nice and runny. *drooling as I type this* I didn't care too much for the pineapple jalapeno slaw that it came with but I liked the house chips (unsalted THANK YOU!).  I also opted for a beer, the Pawtucket watermelon beer, must try, lite and refreshing. My fiancé got ""midnight-n-molasses"" cocktail which we suggest stirring up very well before sipping or else u get a bit hit of ""smokiness"", for his entrée he got the KFB burger. This came with fries and I believe house pickles which were AMAZING; crunchy and sweet! Burger came out done as asked and served on a pretzel bun. He forgot he got the KFB, and I asked what those breaded blocks were and he said ""I dunno chicken tender?"". Then he bit into it and I saw his eye light up, (and they better light up like that when he sees me walk down the aisle),bc he said ""ohhhh it's not chicken its bacon, here babe try it"". *he's a keeper*.  The KFB was super thick sliced, not overly salty, breaded and fried aka it was EVERYTHING!I very much enjoyed myself, my meal, my drink and my company here. We cannot wait to come back when in town! Kudos to Bacon Bar and everyone there!",2,,
13,Steven C.,"Los Angeles, CA",250,154,168,3.0,7/7/2018,"Bar bacon! As a bacon lover I had to try this restaurant that is everything bacon. Alas it wasn't as good as I had hoped.We started off with the bacon and beer flight. The flights we got of ipa were pretty standard. The bacon that came with it was jalapeño, some corn one that we could not hear no matter how many times we asked our server to repeat, a maple one, and regular. The jalapeño one was super salty, definitely the group's least favorite. The maple one smelled better than it tasted. The regular and corn ones were actually pretty good.We had the bacon Mac and cheese because who doesn't love bacon Mac and cheese. The dish was alright. The bigger chunks of bacon meat /ham were hard to chew. The best thing was the fried onions /shallots.The bbq burnt ends were a bit too hard for our tastes also.The best thing was actually the tater tots. That was the first thing to disappear If I came back I'd probably try the sandwiches, but not likely I'll be back anytime soon.",,,

Updated review","***UPDATE***Like a moth to the flame.   I can not resist the bacon.   Three visits since I wanted to quit her.   Whatever the fuck was happening has been addressed and they are delivering the exceptional food and service they were before.  Still no crowds, so it looks like they are still paying the price for the dip in quality and service.   I'm a fat happy bacon pig again **********Such a big change in the quality of food and service.   This has been my go to for the past year.  I've eaten here at least a dozen times, happily bringing friends and out of town guest.   My last three visits have been vastly different.   It appears I'm not the only one aware of the substandard delivery, as the once consistent crowds have dwindled to just a few holdouts, like me.     I want the magic back.    The exceptional staff and the out of this world food.   I'm ignored with an empty glass in an empty restaurant. I e twice sent back bacon, their specialty, for being so overlooked as to be inedible.  A sad day for me.",2,,1
15,Louisa M.,"Las Vegas, NV",867,1298,7734,3.0,4/9/2018,"Hubby and I were hungry after spending an entire day walking around NYC (11 miles and counting) so we turned to Yelp to look for nearby places to nosh. He saw Bar Bacon and the reviews and photos of their bacon and beer flights and his eyes lit up. The restaurant feels and looks like a dive bar inside. Casual is the order of the day. Our server was friendly and prompt, and pointed us to the handwritten paper menu of the day's specials. I spotted the avocado bacon toast and had to order that to start while hubby got the beer and bacon flight. The avocado toast was just okay and sort of a half-assed presentation. There was indeed toast that was topped with cheese then a small amount of sliced avocado, layered with a bit of bacon and topped with a fried egg. I hate eggs and nothing on the menu prepared me for that. It looked pretty but grossed me out, so I only had a couple of bites. I also prefer avocado toast that has mashed avocado, not lazy slices slapped on top. The beer and bacon flight was better, but again, was very unappetizing with all the grease and fat (and yes, I know it's bacon so that's to be expected). I snuck a few bites and was disappointed that the bacon wasn't crispy AT ALL. Call me crazy but a bacon restaurant ought to have cooks that know how to get the bacon nice and crispy and crunchy. This was gross and chewy and not fun at all to eat. For our entrees hubby selected a BLT with house made chips and I had a cobb salad. Yes, I'm THAT person, the one who orders the healthiest thing on the menu at a decidedly unhealthy gimmicky restaurant. My salad was just okay and the portion size far too small, a mediocre bowl of lettuce that was again loaded with eggs (even though I specifically requested no eggs on my salad). It was easy to pick 'em off at least. The sandwich was also deemed ""just okay."" If you like bacon and like beer, I'd come here for the flight just to say you had it. But would I make a special trip or go out of my way to eat here? Nope.",5,2,4
16,Allison T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,3,1,5.0,11/2/2018,"I could sit here all day and eat bacon and beer. Whoever founded this resturant.. thank you!!

17,Quincy T.,"Brooklyn, NY",353,361,681,4.0,3/12/2018,"I've been here a couple times, by choice and against my will... lol. These are my stories.... dun dun.1st visit: Went here with my boy Kev cuz he swore by the place. We got two bar seats, two menus, and began to peruse the everything-bacon menu. While deciding on something delicious we ordered drinks, I was excited to try the black and blue (Guinness drinkers leave me be -_-) so I did and I loved it, kinda. The bartender was friendly and made some great suggestions.... Oh yea and she's Trini (like me). Sliders, beers, whiskey, and great laughs at the bar. 2nd visit: I snuck in here during a lunch break, a few weeks after my initial visit. The vibe was the same, imagine that. One would expect there to be different ""degrees"" of service throughout the day but not here. I think they genuinely want you to enjoy your time at the best bacon spot in nyc. I placed my order and took a stroll while it was prepared, upon my return it was bagged (with extra goodies), and handed to me with a smile.3rd visit: Yes, I've been here a lot... no judgement. On my way to burger shot beer a coworker spotted me walking by and invited me in for a drink (I'm a GREAT HH PARTNER BTW). Walked in and settled in a bar stool immediately.... You'd think the place would be crowded during HH right. Sipped for a while, paid my tab, tipped well, and moved the party to the next spot.... All the while chatting it up with the bartender and my friend. The spot encounters highs and lows with regard to patron volume... you won't always be bombarded by the usual mod, but don't sit there thinking the whole bar is yours lol.

18,Paul R.,"Seattle, WA",52,185,18,3.0,10/16/2018,"Went here with work colleagues that reside in NYC area, I was visiting from Left Coast. It was a very loud when I walked in but it got progressively loud throughout the evening to the point where I had a headache but no alcohol. Well I might've had one cocktail. I think it came with bacon. We had bacon flights and bacon dishes and more bacon to pair with more things. I can't say I was sick of bacon by the end of the meal, just stuffed. The staff were nice, the service was pretty good. The food was okay, nothing to really write about except many kinds of bacon and they have actually thought about how to present it and pair it and garnish drinks with it, so it wasn't nearly as cheesy as I expected. A fine novelty pub when you haven't done it before.",,,
19,Nicole D.,"Hightstown, NJ",15,68,77,4.0,3/22/2018,"If you've ever wondered if there's such thing as too much bacon, this would be the place to test it out. The menu creatively infuses bacon into EVERYTHING, even the cocktails. They also have non-bacon cocktails if that's not your thing. My friend had a whiskey flight and it was delicious!  The menu makes it hard to choose; as I am a fan of a Rueben, I tried their bacon Rueben and it did not disappoint! We stopped in between a two part broadway show and the staff was very accommodating to get us out in time to get back to the theater. Not surprisingly, this restaurant is not vegetarian friendly. And while, I get it, it does limit what groups can stop in for a bite and a drink. There are absolutely no vegetarian options on the menu which meant the person in our party just had a cocktail. I know the restaurant is bacon themed, but maybe a veggie bacon dish or two to include everyone would be fitting.",1,1,1
20,Daniel S.,"Stony Brook, NY",144,139,718,4.0,2/26/2018,"Good food, good beer and good company! The service experience was pleasant- thorough, caring and consistent. I had enjoyed the kentucky fried bacon burger - consisting of a burger patty, jalapeño-pineapple slaw, a fried thick-cut bacon on top of a pretzel bun. What I found most rewarding from this experience, aside from the fully belly, were the pleasant experiences with the kentucky fried bacon (a texture and flavor I did not expect) and the jalapeño-pineapple slaw (something that I will attempt to recreate at home).Will come back again with reinforcements!",2,,1

Ordered the BLT Cobb Salad through seamless and it was delivered on time and my order was correct. Chicken was cooked perfect, though a little on the dry side. The dressing that goes with the salad, bleu cheese and buttermilk, helped and tasted great! Fresh avocado, fresh lettuce, fresh tomatoes, fresh cucumber, and the hard boiled egg was perfect. A little costly for a salad ($17) but the portion size was large! That made up for it. It's worth it. It was actually filling! And I will definitely be eating from here again! I recommend it.",,,
23,Rob W.,"Brooklyn, NY",218,347,521,1.0,12/21/2017,"I never thought anything with ""Bacon"" in its name could possibly let me down, yet here we are. Relatively mediocre food with sloppy preparation combined with atrocious service left us unbelievably disappointed. Arrived around 9p on a Friday - relatively crowded but not overwhelmingly so - and grabbed a seat at the bar right away. Started with the Brussels spouts appetizer which was definitely the tastiest thing we had, though I was a bit concerned that there were a couple of pieces of pasta in the dish that seemed to have gotten flash-fried with the sprouts - didn't speak well for cooking with care. I ordered the Lamb Reuben - the sauerkraut on it was tasty, but lamb bacon fatty and undercooked. My wife's BLT was unexceptional, and somehow came with fries AND chips (again, seemed like a real lack of care in cooking and prep). Beer list was uninspiring-would have ordered a 2nd, but service was spotty and mostly absent throughout meal.  So we were a bit disappointed and anxious to move on, so asked for the check. We had to wait for the bartender to do two separate rounds of shots with her friends at the end of the bar (right in full sight of us), then disappear for a good 10-15 min before bringing the check. We immediately gave her our card, whereupon she disappeared again for a few before bringing the receipt. Leaving us drinkless and unhappy after a mediocre meal for a good 20 min. does not engender much goodwill. I was going to go two stars, as it's bacon, and some of the food was decent. But, well... let's just say that I barely made it home before the meal...repeated on me. I didn't feel great for hours. I'll never give up on bacon, but between quality and especially service, I'm definitely giving up on BarBacon.",8,5,3
24,Varand O.,"New York, NY",3,95,0,2.0,6/24/2018,"I will start by saying that the food was not too bad... perhaps worth 3.5 stars. Standard gastropub food. I was just super surprised that groups of 5+ are automatically given a 20% gratuity. The service, in fact, was not bad. They did not have any ice cream in stock and would not be able to serve their sundae dessert. And then at the end of the night we were encouraged to leave. I understand that serving hours may be over, but I expect that the establishment to operate until their last patrons ARE FINISHED.To sum up, food was OK. Drinks were priced reasonably. The staff wants to go home shortly after their posted hours, so don't expect to go in toward the end of their posted hours.",1,,
25,Brian R.,"New York, NY",91,124,58,4.0,12/23/2017,"This is definitely a place I used to just walk by and kinda ignore as a gimmick (which, let's be honest, it still kinda is). Came in for a bigger brunch group on a Saturday morning and the crew was up to task. Great service from the beginning and our server was on top of drink and food orders. Even though they messed up one order and a guest had to wait ~15 minutes for his food after everyone else, the staff made sure to apologize, etc. The food is solid. Nothing earth shattering, but the bacon was always cooked well on every meal. I opted for the all day breakfast sandwich and wasn't disappointed. Perfectly cooked eggs. The homemade sausage was spot on. And the bacon was perfecto. A solid hangover cure.",2,,2

We were looking for some relief from the weather and the menu was really enticing. Bacon inspired food & drinks. Awesome! We popped in and were instantly greeted by the hostess. The tables were comfy and the service was friendly. For food, my husband had the Bacon & Beer flight (4 artisan bacons strips and 4 5oz craft beers) and we shared the Fish Tacos (amazing!) and the Brussels Sprouts (a MUST-order!).

I ordered the ""Open Face Grilled Chicken Club."" The chicken was plain and had no taste, the lettuce and tomato were plain and had no taste, and there was only two slices of bacon.

Simple looking place with large bar in the middle and tables all the way around. Music is a bit loud. Powerful menu of imaginative bacon and pork creations. Good tip: parties of four or more can make reservations! 5 in our family. Walked in, seated within 10 minutes. Our waiter explained the menus to us, and look at the blackboard around the establishment for daily specials.Bacon sampler is a must! Can't go wrong with the beer pairing one or just bacon. Oh man! It was great! 8 slices, 4 different unique flavors. My fav was jalapeño. Perfect conbo of sweet n spicy. Perfect snack for the 5 of us. Everyone got a little taste and now we're excited for our meals. All of our meals were great. Pretty to look at and even better to eat! My Lobster Loves Bacon MAC & Cheese was very generous on both the lobster and the bacon. Delicious! My husband had a daily special, some kind of bacon sausage. He practically licked  the plate clean.I'd give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the underwhelming desserts. He overpriced vanilla bacon milkshake was so disappointing. It's a vanilla shake. With a piece of chocolate covered bacon in it. I don't know I guess I expected the shake to have a mapley bacony taste to it. Nope. Chocolate covered bacon dessert. It's good. Didn't love it.  For such a great menu, the desserts were a let down.

We got the bacon sampler to share. It comes with 8 strips of bacon so 2 of each flavor - plain, maple, jalapeño, and one more that i can't remember. We've all had regular bacon, so no need to go into details here. The maple was disgusting - I spit it out once I tasted it, didn't even bite it. Jalapeño was my favorite of the 4 as it had a good amount of spice but not too much that it takes away from the natural flavor of the bacon. No clue what the last flavor was but it didn't taste distinct enough and was too similar to the regular bacon to guess what it actually was. All were a little too crispy for my liking but would be perfect for others. My friend had the chicken tacos. It comes with two. This is not necessarily a bad thing but the tacos were loaded up so much that it all fell apart. I ordered the brussel sprouts which were served in a hot skillet with a Vietnamese glaze and bacon. I'm watching my sugar intake so I called ahead to ask about the Vietnamese glaze and was told there wasn't any sugar in it. However it was actually so sweet and my server confirmed that there was sugar. Smh. Also I thought that the brussel sprouts would be crispy but it was drenched and swimming in the Vietnamese glaze so it was all too soft and a little mushy. I couldn't finish it. The bacon was more like a thick cut pork belly which I didn't mind at all. It had a good balance of fat and meaty parts and was pretty tender. Overall, I would not come here again.",,,

If you're in the mood for a bacon bloody mary, or have yet to try one then this is a good spot to stop by. Whether you're up for a full meal or just some snacks, Bar Bacon's enthusiastic staff clearly loves the place, and if you searched for bacon, it's likely you'll enjoy this spot too. The bacon flight is great for sharing, salads and portions are substantial. The more you share the more dishes you can try. I would suggest getting an entree to share and some appetizers. It is easy to get bacon'd out in this place but there are hearty and lighter options. The cocktails with bacon infused are subtle, no need to fear! Chef/Owner of the restaurant worked grew up in New York City and worked with Joel Robuchon, David Boule, the Four Season's Hotel among others. Which is clear when you dig into the details. The very approachable menu crafted by a bacon connoisseur clearly wants to cater to the cravings of a bacon fan. Does it? Well, you can be the judge of that. I think when When someone is in the mood for bacon, this is a fun HK spot for an adventure.The Scene: Low Key, Casual, HipDestination Rating: 8Date Rating: 7Hob Nob Potential: 7Strong Suggestion: Try their brunch!

Had a beer and the kale salad with chicken. Fresh kale with big chunks of bacon and I added the chicken. Excellent. Nice chill vibe with TVs for sports and a great bar to sit at.

I haven't worked in the area for a little over 2 years, but I find myself coming back whenever I have the chance. Every Bartender I've ever come across has been nothing but pleasant and uplifting. There were times I came here having a crappy day at work and by the time I left here I was laughing and dancing to the tunes. The food also adds to the experience. I've had everything from the burger to the assortment of Bacon to the Cobb Salad! Every single solitary item I've ever ordered here has been nothing but flavorful and satisfying ...and it's not just cause I love Bacon, people...lol.

38,Jenny L.,"Absecon, NJ",25,67,474,4.0,9/21/2017,"Food: Full of bacon, of course, and delicious. Although the type of meal itself is very rich due to what the main ingredient is, it is definitely a treat to try once in a while as long as you end up balancing it out with something healthy the rest of the week!Cost: Nothing I would consider too expensive or cheap. An average cost for the food that you are getting. It is NY so the price is on the expensive side but that is nothing to be surprised about. Environment: A very relaxed and chill vibe throughout the restaurant. I enjoyed looking at the various items that are on the walls throughout the restaurant. There is this one poster on the wall opposite of where the bathroom is located. It is filled with a bunch of bacon facts that was very interesting!Service: The waiters were all very kind and tended to our needs very well. They all had a bit of a laid-back vibe which was very relaxing and inviting. They provided great recommendations, which we listened to, and we didn't regret it at all.Uniqueness: Bacon lovers, this is paradise.

I loved the fact that they were covered in A LOT of sauce which, in my opinion, is always the best part! We also got the Bacon Tasting and that was great as well. Other than Jalapeño, we had no idea what any of the flavors were but they were all good regardless. For my entree, I got the Kentucky Fried Bacon Burger which honestly was just okay to me. I didn't love it. I loved the french fries though. I think they were covered in Old Bay seasoning which is one of my favorite seasonings. The service was very attentive but not overbearing and very friendly. Next time, I want to try one of the desserts. I'll definitely be back.",,,1

Thick slices of bacon were deep fried and paired perfectly with crispy vegetables, crusty bread, and tangy Vietnamese flavors of a traditional Banh Mi.

We were a group of 4 and we ordered all different items from the menu so that we could taste them all. The portions were good sized and prices were decent.

51,Mike B.,"Atlanta, GA",57,229,51,3.0,2/22/2018,"This spot is a solid 3.5. Not quite a 4, but not quite a 3. First night in town, wifey and I wanted to hit a spot that was walking distance from the hotel. A spot where we could have a couple of rounds and enjoy some great food. So, we landed here. First Impressions were great. It was semi packed for a Tuesday night. People were enjoying the night because it was 68 degrees in February. The bartender was super cool. I told her I was looking to pair the Empire State Flight (3 different shots of Bourbon) with a beer. She gave the perfect pair. At this point I was fully committed to this spot and was looking to dig deep into the menu. Let's get to the menu. We order a few apps just to sample what they have to offer. Starting with the Bacon Spinach Dip  and the Pork Belly Burnt Ends. The Pork Belly was cooked to perfect and I recommend it to everyone that comes. The bacon spinach dip on the other hand was a complete miss. I understood what they were trying to accomplish, but it was hella bland. We had to get the server to bring us out some seasoning just to doctor it up. We also ordered the French Onion Soup and some sausage link bacon and chorizo. All in All it was a solid experience, but the pricing on the food was slightly overpriced IMO.",,2,
52,Aletha H.,"Atlanta, GA",425,140,253,3.0,2/21/2018,"We came across this spot while walking down 9th earlier in the day and was so intrigued by the name that we figured we'd try it out for dinner.  There was only a short wait for a table so we sat at the bar while they got it ready.  While there, the bartender let us sample the Bluepoint Toasted Lager and it was pretty good.  I ordered a glass once we got seated at the table while hubby grabbed a flight of bourbon.  For apps, we tried the bacon spinach dip special and the pork belly burnt ends.  The belly was great but the spinach dip was surprisingly super bland! We ended up asking for the bacon seasoning to try saving the dish but it still fell flat.  For mains, I decided to go with the chorizo bacon sausage and a side of tots while hubby fell for his favorite - French onion soup.  Hubby enjoyed his soup and the sausage was very flavorful.  The tots were good but leaned towards the greasy side.  Overall, the food was more of a 3.5 star experience but 1) there's no 0.5 star designation and 2) I had to deduct some rating due to the bland dip and prices of some of the dishes. I know it's Manhattan but jeez!  I also understand that menus change but it was a little disappointing to see that some of the older menu items from only a year ago were no longer available.The vibe itself was super chill. You saw a combination of couples and groups of friends as well as a family or two.  It definitely seemed to be somewhat of a local hangout as well as a slight tourist trap. They also offer happy hour 3-6 PM along with a late night run after 10 PM where sangria and other drinks are only $5.  All in all, it was a cool spot.",,1,
53,Chris D.,"Bloomington, IL",24,105,49,1.0,9/3/2017,"Sadly, I was hoping for a better first experience at a bar focused on bacon!We arrived and were promptly seated by the hostess. The menu is straightforward and our drinks and appetizers came out quickly. The fried pickles, sadly, were mediocre. The bacon flight was good, though the runner briefly just named each before running off. The server did not come over during, only to grab the plates. Then our entrees arrived. Mine was incorrect, and I had to explain to the runner (server did not come over) that I had an ingredient on it that I did not want (and had clearly ordered without). It actually appeared that they started putting the ingredient on then stopped. Gross. (Minus 1 star)During our meal, the server did not come to our table to check how things were, did not come over to find out why food was sent back, and did not apologize. He was five steps away at the bar on his phone, which is funny because my drink has been empty since before my incorrect entree arrived. (Minus 1 star)Sadly, I even had time to continue eating then find him on his phone again...even photographed it. (Minus 1 star)Immediately after I snapped a picture, he was given a shot of Jameson by the bartender and drank it...still failing to say anything to us since the plates were dropped off. (Minus 1 star)I don't know what the bar's policy is on their servers drinking on the clock, but I hope they encourage people not to drink while serving food. I cannot say I want to come back here at this time. If you choose to, be prepared for lackluster service.Edit: while trying to get our check, our server disappeared outside. Then, when attempting to grab him, he just buzzed right past us. When I asked him politely for it, he said ""Oh sh*t my bad,"" and ran to grab it. When I looked at the receipt I found out his name is Mike, first time I heard his name all evening.Edit 2: typos",,,

56,Dang N.,"Huntington Beach, CA",215,1117,163,4.0,9/20/2018,"3.5 stars. I had a good time here overall and in fact ended up later the weekend eating at their brand new location right below Union Square. I came in and had the bacon and beer flight. What I found amusing, was when I asked where the bacon was from (i.e. what state) no one could answer me. I initially asked the waiter that brought out my dish, he didn't know so got my bartender who didn't know, so he went back to the kitchen. He then came back and told me they were from various states. I later on asked where the pepper bacon was from (my favorite) and he went back to the kitchen and told me the chef had to look this up! LOL! How does the chef not know where his food is coming from? Especially the bacon? What's the name of this place again? Do I expect you to know where all your food comes from? No, but do I expect a place called Bar Bacon to know where they source their namesake? Yes. Despite all this, I got great service here and teasingly gave the bartender a hard time. I also wished they took their bacon and beer flight seriously enough that they paired the beer with the bacon. My bartender asked my what beers I wanted and got some beers that did not pair well with the bacon. Oh well, but again, still had a good time.",,,

There were so many tasty looking options on the menu, so it was hard to choose. Ended up going with the bacon tasting (4 diff kinds), pork belly tacos, and the pulled pork Mac and cheese- all to share. Everything was AMAZING!!! The maple bacon and jalapeño bacon were my favorite- sooo flavorful! I couldn't stop gushing over how good the pork belly tacos were (omg I want another one just thinking about them now), and the Mac and cheese was delicious too!

The only thing that helped it taste okay was the bacon and gouda.As for service, it was pretty awful. Our waiter very rarely came by and didn't even ask how our food was but as soon as the tip was written on our tab he came and yanked the receipt book out from under my Fiance's arm.

There were sports games on the TVs and music playing. It made for a lively environment. We ordered the pulled pork mac n cheese and the burger. The mac n cheese was served in a skillet and a lot more food than we anticipated (no complaints here!) The pulled pork with bbq sauce was tender and was a great combo on top of the mac n cheese. The burger was on a pretzel bun. It was a good burger, but not the best we've ever had. They have a lot of good choices on the menu so I would be open to trying other meals next time.

Food: they have these specials on the chalkboards, so I orders the Hanger Steak+Frites ($20 special), it comes with chimichurri, and succotash that has a char to it: the delivery of the dish is problematic, as it's brought out on a sizzling fajita like cast iron skillet, so when I order my steak medium or medium rare, it's well done by the time it makes it to me; we all know food continues to cook after you take it off the grill etc. the steak portion was small and drowned in the chimichurri I had to dig for it, literally lol. The frites were good, the succotash had a char to it that overpowered the taste, I only tasted char the whole time and because the skillet was piping hot forever it took me a long time to eat, the food was too hot temperature wise to eat it. My date was almost done by time I could eat.Happy Hour: well drinks, draft beers $5, great deal!! The guy with the beard poured nicely lol also the pineapple beer was good and refreshing, the Montauk watermelon was a no, you don't taste any watermelon. High note: my dates pork-belly tacos were great!! You get 3 I ate one of them, since they claim they were spicy, either the drizzle or the pickled cabbage has the spice, i liked them! 3.5 stars, I'll come back to try something else and or atleast to drink, but it's summer in NYC turn on your damn a/c.",,,

Sampled the deep fried pickles and tater tots as an appetizer, highly recommend both - they were delicious. As the location name implies, this menu is BACON HEAVY. And this is not ""typical store bacon""... this is like, a slab of BBQ on your plate ""bacon"". This place is inexpensive and the portions are sizable enough that you can easily need a take home box. Our table sampled a variety of plates - and everyone was satisfied. They happened to be out of quite a few of their brunch menu options, which was disappointing. But the Benedict, burger, mango bacon salad were all delicious. I had an egg scrambler and didn't particularly think my option was ""Great"", but the taste of the meat really threw me off personally.In regard to the Benedict: it's a traditional benny and they serve the hollandaise on the side so you can drench it to your hearts content. The eggs are served over almost an egg casserole in a small skillet (a sausage bread pudding type casserole with bacon).  The burger was a standard breakfast burger topped with egg and served with house made chips. The bacon mango salad actually was enormous and the ""bacon"" was enormous CHUNKS of meat - very good. Get here early and make reservations.",3,,1

76,Krista H.,"Philadelphia, PA",114,137,31,3.0,12/4/2017,"My boyfriend and I stopped in here on Saturday morning as he was looking for a good bloody mary. We came across this on yelp and it wasn't too far of a walk so we headed over. When we arrived there was only one other couple sitting at the bar. He ordered his bloody mary and I ordered a mimosa. Both were promptly brought to us. The bartender then asked if we wanted food, we said we were still deciding whether or not to stay..the menus were taken away at that point. We asked about the specials on the board and notified they were not available until 4PM. I didn't feel like trying to find another place for lunch and my friend was getting tired so I figured we'd just dine there...asked for the menus back and waited quite a while to be able to order. It looked like the chef came out with the evenings dessert special...it looked awesome by the way..everyone was taking turns eating it after taking pictures of it. After they'd finished marveling at the pie we ordered. He went with the pork wings and I went with the blt.The BLT came on ciabatta bread and only lightly toasted. I will say this sandwich was built very well..lettuce wasn't wet, bacon slightly warm and the tomatoes weren't sliding all over...my only complaint was slightly too much bread and too little mayo. My sandwich also came with housemade chips which I felt were bland..could have used some salt or maybe new oil? As well as a jalepeno pineapple slaw..The pork wings were not quite what I expected..I beleive there were about 6 on the plate and they came with blu cheese and carrots/celery. I opted to try one but when I couldn't stab it with my fork (because it was too crunchy) I opted out. He enjoyed them but I don't think I would have been happy with that choice.As far as atmosphere goes, the place seemed nice..large bar which I like. They had a few TVs with the college football going..but the music they played was slightly too loud for my taste.",,,

The fries is well seasoned and I always get the bacon tasters. The drinks are delicious. Everything about the place is amazing, the fact that it is small and friendly is amazing. I think it is reasonably priced for New York City. I suggest if you like bacon, this is the place for you. Make sure if you are touring NYC this is one of the restaurants you hit upon. After all NYC is all about the experiences and this one is a great one.",3,,

I started off with a red sangria which was amazing, and got an order of loaded tater tots to split. This hands down was one of the best loaded tater tots I've ever had, the bacon on top just made it so much better.For an entree I ordered chicken tacos and the pork belly tacos...which were also amazing.  I am so glad I came here and tried this place!",,,
79,Amanda J.,"Louisville, KY",441,277,963,5.0,3/20/2017,"It was the last day of my most recent trip to New York City, and I wanted a tasty dinner. I LOVE bacon, and I had bookmarked Bar Bacon awhile ago. So, I made my way to Bar Bacon. It was probably around 8:00 PM, and I was able to be seated right away at a two-top (even though it was just me). The place was pretty loud with a good playlist, but if you were looking for conversation, it might be a little difficult.Anyway, I looked over the menu and the specials (on the wall). I decided on brussel sprouts and the lamb reuben. The server asked if I'd like my brussel sprouts as an app, which I appreciated and worked perfectly. And... OMG. I love brussel sprouts, but the mixture of flavors--including that of the pork belly and whatever else was in there... DELICIOUS. I was still nibbling on those (as the serving honestly could've been a meal) when my reuben came out.  The lamb, the bacon, the whatever... it was melting in my mouth!!!!! SO good. It came with potato chips (and maybe cole slaw?) as sides, but I really didn't touch those; I wanted all of the space in my belly to be for those sprouts and that sandwich. I was very impressed by the tastes in each of the dishes; they seemed really well thought out and paired, especially for this bacon lovin' lady.Overall, the service was good. My water (which I drink quickly) was pretty constantly refilled, which was appreciated. My order came out quickly. The only thing--which I almost knocked a star for--was that it took me quite awhile to get my bill to pay. The bad news: I had about a fourth of my sandwich and a few brussel sprouts boxed up; I intended on eating them as soon as I walked back to my hotel. After walking five or so blocks, I realized.... I LEFT MY LEFTOVERS ON THE TABLE. :( I figured they were gone by that point. Thus, I am still craving my leftovers. So, next time I'm in New York, I will definitely be going back to Bar Bacon.",4,4,2

The server made sure we didn't go too long before bringing another glass, which I am a huge fan of. We had the bacon strips appetizer and the sliders which were quite forgettable. The food star of the night was the Lobster Loves Bacon Mac & Cheese which was delicious and filled with chunks of lobster and bacon.

For a while, I have been meaning to check out this place for its food, because I do not know if anything is better than bacon. For example, I could go for a couple strips of bacon right now. I visited this place around 6 pm on a weeknight and it was pretty empty, so there was no wait for a table. Since I was starving, I did not really inspect the menu and I went for the first non salad item that could be prepared pretty fast. I went with the open faced chicken club (I guess a club sandwich is kind of like a salad), which had applewood smoked bacon and chipotle mayo. Everything besides the chicken was delicious. The chicken component of the sandwich was  dry and rubbery.  I really had to hack at the chicken to cut it into chewable  pieces. Also, the chicken really did not have much flavor to it - it helps that there was plenty of chipotle mayo surrounding the sandwich on the plate. The presentation of the dish was very artistic, so it had the looks without the flavor. Although my sandwich was a little disappointing, I am definitely game for trying some other things on the menu. Bar Bacon really scores points with its diverse craft beer menu (and it's interesting bacon-inspired cocktails). So this place just is not all about bacon, it's also all about draaaanks too. I will visit this place again, because I very intrigued by the pork belly tacos.",2,,

Up next, lobster, bacon Mac & cheese ( very cheesy), Brussel sprouts w/ bacon in a sweet sauce and topped with sour cream. It's a must order and ending dinner w/ a lobster roll.  All of this was so rich and delicious.  I'm totally over bacon for a while tho.

I'm a sucker for a good Rueben so I ended up getting the house cured lamb bacon Reuben to see how it compares to others I've had. His was absolutely near the top of my list (if not the best I've ever had). I would absolutely recommend it to anyone that remotely likes Rueben's.

The nachos were really good as well (shredded pork, bacon, guac, sour creme, cheese, chipotle mayo & salsa). The menu was quiet nice with a lot of delicious dishes to choose from. Now if you really want to get adventurous you can order the bacon flight or one of the bacon infused cocktails but the thought of bacon + alcohol just didn't sit right with me.

103,Elyssa C.,"Brooklyn, NY",191,11,2,4.0,8/14/2018,"Alright alright. Listen. If you're browsing casually and want something tasty and full of bacon then go. You shouldn't need to be poring through reviews. If you like bacon, you will find something on this menu you like; I think I can assure that. If you don't find something, then you're a complete snob and they probably don't want you as clientele anyway.I am on a goddamn meat-free and dairy-free diet and told my boyfriend on Saturday around noon ""I want bacon. We're going."" (""Aren't you an ovo-pescetarian?"" ""Can you just shut the hell up and enjoy the fact that I want to eat meat?"") And so we went for brunch. Cocktails were great -- he got a bacon bloody mary and myself the spicy habanero margarita. I rarely find a spicy margarita that I dislike, and this one was the baby bear of spicy margaritas if I'm Goldilocks. Not too spicy, not too ~not~ spicy. I'm personally not too much a fan of bloodies but it looked good to my eyes (and he said his mouth, too). We ordered the brussels sprouts skillet as an appetizer, and for mains, bacon French toast and biscuit egg sandwich. Sprouts: flavors are all great together, except the Greek yogurt was a little off-putting and made the sprouts beneath it a bit soggy. Ate around it. French toast: some of the best I've had in a while. I'm more used to diner breakfasts and a thin slice of white bread called French toast so it's a magical experience when you're given REAL bread (I think this was Brioche but not certain). Berries were fresh, and the sugar cookie crumble/cinnamon sugar/maple butter were amazing complements. I was unsure about the bacon combination with it, but it was small crispy pieces that topped it. Incorporated bacon, but didn't overdo it so that it was a sickening entree. (Goldilocks and baby bear, again.) A+. The egg sandwich was good too, but the biscuit fell apart quite a bit. It's a big sandwich, and depends on how you prefer your biscuits baked. (That isn't innuendo.)This was our third time there and we'll definitely be back. Worth the vegetarian cheat meal.",,,

They aren't kidding with this name - - bacon is in literally everything from the appetizers to the desserts (bacon whipped cream, anyone?). But aside from the gimmick, the food is excellent. The brussels sprouts appetizer was beautifully cooked with a delicate sauce and of course much bacon and onions and sour cream. The bacon bites, which are also served on a burger as a Kentucky bacon bites burger, are deep-fried pieces of bacony sin. The burger was accompanied by a unique coleslaw with pineapple. The kale salad is excellent; what really sets it off are the numerous wonderful pieces of sliced apple and candied pecans. Yes there are baking lardons in this, but it's one of the lighter choices on the menu in terms of the ratio of bacon:food.The atmosphere in the restaurant is shabby bar chic. The extensive bar has a prominent place in the middle of this restaurant, and it was quite active while we were there. Lots of patrons were enjoying the many beer selections, which included a number of items on tap. I was particularly pleased to see multiple cider choices. Too many times in restaurants it's either one cider or nothing. Seeing that Bar Bacon had multiple choices was refreshing.Stuffed from our artery-hardening experience, we passed on dessert. Alas, did not get to try that bacon whipped cream. Perhaps another time!Bar Bacon is definitely recommended for a casual, friendly atmosphere; great beer selection; and an excellent menu where the gimmick actually translates into good food.",,,

I left yesterday after seeing their new menu. $21 for a bacon burger? It use to be $16. 31% increase? That's completely insane. I understand prices need to rise but their burger is no way close to being worth $21. This is a plain bar, nothing special, they don't even make good drinks. I would only come for beers and burgers. For comparison, one of the best burgers I've had is from Minetta Tavern. They charge $25. It was worth $25 plus you get the history and ambiance there as well amazing drinks, not just beer. I'm done with this place.Update: the price was not increased to $19 7 months ago as I was just there last on December 19th (that's 3 months ago) and the price was $16. Also, your old menu is still online and lists the price as $16. So in those 3 months, it increased 19% and then again another 11%. Not worth it.",1,,

At first, I thought it was going to be small, but when it came out, it was kind of huge. Topped with crispy bread crust, clumps of lobster meat, and thick sliced bacon strips, it was a match made with heaven. I admit, I thought I wasn't going to finish it, and I almost didn't, but I did. It is a lot of starch, cheese, and kind of too greasy for me, I thought I was going to get a heart attack, but it was good overall.

Thin and crispy is how I like it)Burger (barbacon burger I think it's called): mediocre at best. Perhaps it was a little over cooked (medium instead of medium rare) but it just didn't have much seasoning or taste. It also came with REALLY thick and fatty bacon which might be a dream for most bacon fans, but now for me unfortunately. I ended up taking 75% of it off and leaving it on my plate. Brussels sprouts: appetizer and probably the best thing I got. Seasoned with something like maple syrup and soy sauce together and Greek yogurt. It was VERY delicious. It also came with pieces of very thick bacon which I ate around but it added very good flavor to the Brussels sprouts.Bacon flight: now THIS is how I like my bacon. Thin and crisp.

First of all it was huge, I feel like it was four pieces of chicken and probably six or so large slices of bacon. And then there were multiple slices of tomato on the plate.The chicken was tasty, and of course the bacon was delicious. Underneath all of that was the bread. Really good open-faced sandwich.In addition to good food, it has a fairly diverse beer list. I had a few beers. The cocktail List look pretty good as well... But I did not try any.I sat at the bar, and the bartenders are friendly, even though they seemed pretty busy while I was there.Definitely somewhere I would go again and try some of the other food... I heard some of the staff talking about the specials - they have a new meatball special that someone was raving about. I definitely try that next time.",,,

The food tasted good and the portions were maybe a little above average in size, but the price did not at all reflect the quality of meal we have. Also the server was a little pushy for us to order as soon as we walked in- restaurant wasn't busy at all so didn't understand why the rush to order.",1,1,1

I kept seeing pictures of Bar Bacon on Instagram so I was very intrigued and wanted to check the place out. As soon as we looked at the menu, it was very clear that 95% of the food options here include bacon in some form. So if bacon is not your thing I would definitely think long and hard before coming  here. Non bacon options included chicken wings and fried pickles. But for my fellow bacon lovers, Bar Bacon is literally heaven. Our server was speedy and friendly. We ordered the bacon appetizer that came with an assortment of bacon including maple, jalapeño, and a few others. My boyfriend had the bacon lobster roll while I had the bacon and avocado torta. We also did try the chicken wings. The quality of food and flavors were amazing. In addition to the amazing food options there was an extensive drink menu including a long list of beers and cocktails. We will definitely return and I'd totally recommend it to anyone who likes to indulge in eating delicious bacon.",9,2,5

It was taco night, so we gave those a shot and were not disappointed.I had - Bacon Old Fashioned. At first, I found this to have a bit of a bite to it, but as the ice melted, it diluted the drink just enough that I suddenly loved it! The bacon in the drink was fun, but definitely odd to eat after sitting in the alcohol hah!Chips and guac - HUGE portion. More than enough for two people. Definitely worth the $12.Chipotle Pork Belly Taco - The pork belly was great! I wasn't a fan of the slaw that was on there, but that's just a personal preference. My friend thoroughly enjoyed it!Fish Taco - Delicious!! A great meld of flavors and textures.My friend also had the Kentucky Fried Bacon taco and thought it was good!Looking forward to coming back and trying some more things on the menu!",1,1,1

Another bacon-themed restaurant I've been to is Traif, which is pricier, but very good. Bar Bacon is cheaper and much more causal than Traif. It was how I started my day. Yes, I came here for brunch.Every single brunch place in Hell's kitchen was ""clogged"" / crowded, so I went to BarBacon instead right when they opened to clog up my arteries.I started with a bloody mary, with bacon. There was a crispy strip of bacon in the spicy bloody mary. Salty and spicy, yum.I had the eggs benedict which consisted of 2 eggs over breakfast sausage bread pudding. It was served in a small rectangular casserole pan, with lots of... bacon! My dish was very greasy, my food was literally floating in half an inch of grease. Even though the food was decent, the oil was pretty gross. They have a lot of delicious bacon filled snacks, which I would love to try one day. There are also bacon flights I think!

The fish tacos were filled with a lot of good toppings like guacamole, bits of crispy bacon, and chipotle mayo. But the actually quality of the fish was very average. A little more on the dry side, but all the toppings compensate for it. You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck with this place though. My dish came with 3 HUGE tacos and my dates dish came with the biggest slab of bacon I've ever seen.

Original Review:  Food and ambiance were great but the service was downright pitiful. I came here on Sunday for brunch around 11:30 am. I ordered the bacon burger, medium rare. I knew from the start that my order was not going to be correct. The girl behind the bar had no clue what I was saying - she actually was walking away after I said I would have the burger, she did not even ask for a temperature!  I had to say 'wait I would like it cooked medium rare please.' She again nodded and walked off.  The burger arrived, and sure enough it was well done. The waitress did not check on us until about 10 minutes after receiving our food. She said how is everything while walking away!!! !  I had to turn around out of my seat to say that I'm pretty disappointed, I asked two times for the burger to be medium rare and it's well done. She offered to exchange it but it was too late. I never saw her again after that. We actually had to take our plates and slide them out of the way for space. She was absolutely clueless and had zero attention to detail. Fortunately, another bartender who was much nicer and attentive took over behind the bar and cashed us out.  It would have been great to have a waitress that understood what we were saying and properly took our order and attentive but not this time. This could have easily been a 5 star review. Next time we come later when this girl is not working. Total disappointment.",,1,

I highly recommend this.The Lobster Roll was $24 dollars, which I felt was a bit on the high side. I get that this is NYC and the portion was large, but it did still seem a bit high.

176,Natalie A.,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",250,18,10,4.0,12/2/2017,"We stopped by this fun place in Hell's Kitchen for a quick lunch (and obviously some bacon). I ordered the bacon & beer flight, which was oh so good! They perfectly pair each beer tasting with a different flavor of bacon. My favorite was the jalapeño bacon, followed by honey bacon, corn bacon & almond bacon. For lunch I ordered the open faced chicken sandwich (the portion was enough for 2 people). The chicken sandwich was good, your average chicken sandwich with BLT & a chipotle mayo. My friend had the bacon lobster Mac & cheese. It was also average, but I'm from south Florida so my expectations for lobster mac & cheese are pretty high ;) Overall, this is a cool place to visit & they have a good happy deal as well! Enjoy!",,,
177,Kristine A.,"New York, NY",136,90,331,2.0,4/13/2017,"Overpriced for meh food.Went with BACON & ROASTED CORN TORTA for $13Applewood smoked bacon, griddle corn cakes, guacamole and tomato corn relish.Corn cakes were nothing special. It was super dry that made it hard to eat. The guacamole and salad it came on was good.Wouldn't come back.",,,
178,Jessica P.,"Beaverton, OR",76,348,0,4.0,4/12/2017,"Bacon flight? YES! I'm obsessed with food and drink flights, I'm truly a sucker for them. When I found out about the bacon flight I just had to make it happen. We were out on a Friday night partying it up at a bar around the corner, when we decided to take a beer and bacon break. We saddled up to the bar and reviewed our options. The bartender helped us decide on some beers for our beer flight as we anxiously awaited our bacon flight. They had a good selection of beers, which paired nicely with the bacon. They had 4 different types of bacon, though we only caught maple and jalapeno because we simply couldn't understand what the guy that delivered them to us was saying. We asking him to repeat himself, but still didn't understand him so we gave up. The last 2 just tasted like bacon so who knows? The maple was my favorite, it was a little sweet with a nice hint of maple, nothing overpowering. The jalapeno definitely had a bit of a kick to it, which worked with my beer. Overall, would recommend if you are out having some drinks and need a snack. I honestly don't know why other places haven't thought of this.",,,
179,Morgan M.,"Augusta, GA",5,15,8,1.0,11/30/2017,Honestly would not come back to this place based on how greasy the food was. My sister and I shared the pulled pork sandwich and had to take the bread off because it was completely soaked through. When our waitress asked how our food was and I said it was a bit too greasy she responded 'well it IS bacon' and walked away. We rarely do not finish our  meals when going out to eat but in this situation we were afraid it was going to make us sick and we sent half of it back (even the chips). Very disappointed that we spent $16 on a greasy mess.,,,
180,Divya R.,"New York, NY",35,80,31,2.0,5/16/2018,Overrated.  No homage to bacon. Completely commericalized.  I would never go back.  I gave two stars because the beer selection was good.  Food is just awful.,,,
181,Katharine S.,"Arlington, VA",352,588,461,3.0,4/4/2016,"I have been looking forward to this place for forever. And I was kind of disappointed. It wasn't BAD by any means. It just did not live up to the hype.Their happy is pretty great - $5 for drafts, sangria and well drinks. Our server was ok - but he didn't tell us what the specials were...we had to bring up the fish tacos because they weren't on the menu.We got that as our appetizer. They were actually very good. For my entree I had the lobster/bacon mac and cheese. The mac and cheese itself was delicious, but the lobster I wound up spitting out because it did not taste fresh...it tasted kind of sour. No thanks!The bacon chunks were big, but VERY fatty. Again, I wound up spitting them out for the most part.My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich - it was good, but there was nothing special about it. I barely tasted their pineapple coleslaw on it. He also got the bacon salted tator tots...those were also just Ok. The sangria was eh, too. Overall, I wouldn't come back here unless I was in the area and wanted a happy hour drink and an app - not for dinner. Our bill came out to $118.00 with tip....I just didn't see or expect this meal to be a $118 meal. Oh well...at least I had leftovers.",6,4,2
182,Kay Ashley M.,"New York, NY",532,206,5705,4.0,4/7/2016,"Impressive selection of bacon appetizers, main entrees, drinks and desserts, all with bacon infused somehow (whether it is a slice of savory bacon in the drink, bacon flavored whipped cream, etc.).I strongly suggest a reservation since it was packed when we arrived (good thing we had a reservation and the hostess was kind enough to wait for us while other customers were trying to get our table). When we called, they usually do not make reservations for two people but for groups of four or more. The environment here on a Friday night in April was crowded, hot, humid and very loud (hard to have a conservation and plenty of drunks around), so yes, it is one of those kinds of bars.The drinks here were strong and did not disappoint, though my favorite part was the strip of bacon included in the drink. It was chewy, savory and infused with flavors like a good-quality strip of beef jerky. Next, the bacon sampler (""Bacon Tasting"") is strongly recommended. The waiter explained each flavor which were delicious, though one was a tad too spicy for me.I do recommend the bacon grilled cheese (which came with a delicious clam chowder), the bacon lobster roll and bacon mac & cheese. All were big portion sizes and we brought the rest home. We finished off with a bacon vanilla milkshake which had plenty of whipped cream (bacon-style)!",4,,2
183,Becky D.,"Reading, PA",170,298,424,5.0,8/30/2017,Seriously I want to take this place home with me! Everything I've had here in my two visits is amazing! The Bloody Mary's are AMAZING! My husband and I liked h bacon sampler. I mean why not? It's bacon and FOUR different types? SOLD. The grilled cheese was amazing. The second time I went I had the lobster mac n cheese with bacon. Seriously get this. It's everything you need in life and more. It's reasonably priced. It's so good. Just go.,1,,
184,Emily C.,"Brooklyn, NY",29,56,0,4.0,11/1/2017,"If you like bacon at all, you'll love this place.  My girlfriend and I visited to catch up before her class, and I'm so glad we tried out this Hell's Kitchen joint.  We were able to get in before 6PM, which means we scored the happy hour price on white sangria for $5...cheaper than you could imagine for Manhattan.  The specialty cocktails with cool bacon-infused liquors were more pricey  (from $13-$15) but the sangrias we got set the stage for some tasty food exploits.  We started with house-made bacon sampler, the maple pecan and spicy jalapeno bacons were my favorite, and you received two strips of 4 flavors, so it was perfect for sharing.  I also ordered the tater tots that came in a neat little fry basket and tasted like crunchy awesomeness along with pulled-pork fried dumplings...and dear baby Jesus, they were amazeballs in my face.  I didn't want to share them.  Why weren't they invented years ago?  I could eat them forever.  My girlfriend was very pleased with her seasoned fries and chicken bacon quesadilla, and offered to share--but I was lovin' my own grub too much.  Service was fabulous!  It could have been because it was Halloween and the place was only half full, but the staff went out of there way to make sure we had water, checked in with us, and didn't mind when we took forever to choose our treats for ordering.  Very friendly and polite, and quick to clear away extra plates.Bottom line:  You're not going to Bar Bacon for diet food...understand that you're going to this place to honor the deliciousness of the bacon in it's natural element.  I can't wait to go back.",,,
185,Abigail N.,"Bronx, NY",40,59,50,5.0,6/10/2018,This place definitely stood out amongst blocks loaded with different kinds of restaurants. It's become my husband's favorite. He ordered the BBQ pork dumplings as well as the pork belly tacos and I had a BLT and a bacon milkshake which was amazing. The sangria wasn't that great but the overall experience was alright. Cool little pub which some really good dishes. I couldn't have the lobster Mac and cheese (shellfish allergy) but it looked amazing.,,,
186,Scott S.,"Benson, AZ",30,6,0,1.0,3/6/2018,"Zero seasoning on the burger. The dominant flavor was the full slice of raw red onion. And they serve a side of sweet pickle chips. I had to ask for sauce because the meat I ordered medium was WELL done and the only choice was Tabasco or Cholula. There was no sauce of any kind on the burger. I sat at the bar with an empty glass for the last half of my meal and had to reach over the bar for cocktail napkins to wipe my hands. No cutlery was ever provided. If you want a burger with flavor, go somewhere else.",1,,

189,Yannie E.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",119,123,421,4.0,1/2/2017,"Bacon lovers rejoice!Them pork bellies driving my bacon fantasies up the wazoo. It's no wonder my buddy Jacob W. would take the treck 2hrs up from Southern NJ to dine at this gem.  To start, Bacon and Beer Flight. 5/5Bacon and beer pairing. Bacon strips smoked and cured differently, each paired with each of the four beer samplers. I must say that the pairing was phenomenal, though I am most impressed with the starting combo from the left, one can appreciate the ingenuity of the chef from each bite and sip. The beer sampling actually accentuates the taste and aroma of the smoked wood, without overcasting the nature of the artisan brew. Buffalo wings 4/5Fried crispy, perfect consistency. Wing sauce not memorable. Shani's BLT 3/5Applewood BLT with fried egg. Bacon perfect as always. Fried egg was overdone, suggest requesting for runny egg next time. The ingredients altogether created a plate but not a dish. Slight disappointment from the perfect execution from the app. BarBacon Burger 4.5/5Meat and artisan bacon. Need I say more? Overall great experience. Shout out to the bartender/manager who was such a great sport!",5,3,4

194,Wheels R.,"Natick, MA",4,82,0,3.0,4/16/2018,"I think when you base your establishment on bacon you think to yourself ""this won't be hard, bacon makes everything better"". Problem is the expectations are too high. Bar Bacon is a decent spot and good for a visit if you are in the area. It took me a long time to order since the menu is enticing but things just fall a bit short and the bacon isn't the saving grace. I had the fish tacos, they were tasty and the beer was cold. Tacos come 2 to an order and I asked if I could get 1 pork belly and 1 fish and of course the answer was no. Only mix and match allowed on taco Tuesday. Come on man. Considering the tacos are oversized and only come in 3 flavors (chicken, pork belly and fish) I think a combo order should be accommodated. I might go back, anyone can survive ordering a beer/bacon sampler. But overall Bar Bacon just came up a bit short of the mark for me.",,,

This was our last stop of the night so we just ordered the beer and bacon flight, which seems to be a popular choice. We went with having the recommended beer pairings, which had been explained to us to compliment the bacon. The four types of bacon came out in pairs--flavors of jalapeno, corn cob, maple and pecan. Jalapeno kind of tasted like a jalapeno flavored powder was rubbed all over it, while the corn cob was basically undetectable. Our favorite was the maple, sweet and salty. Basically couldn't tell it wasn't pecan, but still tasted better than the corn cob somehow. The beers that they paired with the bacon didn't really seem to compliment them...the dark coffee beer was paired with the jalapeno and an IPA paired with the maple was all I can remember. Go if you're super into bacon and beer, but otherwise I would pass.",1,1,1

We ordered the following Pulled Pork Mac & Cheese, no seasoning & bland. Took 3 bites and left it there. Loaded Tater Tots, dry tots, stale bacon. Barely touched it.  Kentucky Fried Bacon Bites, decent.Chicharron Nachos, best of the 4. As I started to eat I noticed no one else was eating. They were all drinking. Drinking seems like the thing to do there. I asked the group next to us & they said they've had the same experience, and all they do is drink there. The bacon old fashioned was good, & service was decent, but neither made up for the food",,,
