FryGuys is a small shop with only about 7-8 seats but boy are their fries,tater tots, and curly fries packed with flavor!!! They have so many amazing dipping sauces, my favorite being the garlic aioli. Onto the fries: I've tried their Mac and cheese tater tots (so good, so crunchy, could use a bit more cheese), the Fry Guy - pulled pork with curly fries (we requested curly instead of regular fries) which was our favorite, and the drunk guy - loaded with bacon, cheese, and guac all over french fries.My favorite fries were their curly fries and tater tots as I like my fries with a crunch, their toppings and dipping sauces added so much flavor to already amazing fries that I could've eaten cups of! Definitely give this place and their fries a try!",2,,1
1,Bella F.,"New York, NY",0,1,3,5.0,10/21/2018,"So happy that I found FryGuys in the East Village this weekend. I was on a walk with friends when I saw a bright rainbow neon sign and was drawn into the light! Their store front is filled with color -- very whimsical, creative and fun. Upon entering, you can smell delicious fries being cooked. But before getting to the counter, there is literally so much to look at. One wall is filled with iconic celebrities, old photos of New York, records, vintage radios-- literally everyone is up there! The other wall is this awesome Lisa Frank mural that brings you back to your childhood, the floor is made of records. All in all, really awesome atmosphere. Now for the food. You may not expect a french fry restaurant to go above and beyond for flavors, but FryGuys does. My friends and I got the FryGuy, which is pulled pork on top of fries, Mac and Cheese Tater Tots (with bacon) which is creamy delicious mac n cheese on top of perfectly crispy tots and milkshakes. The pulled pork is so tender, a good balance of smokey and sweet and a sizable portion. The mac n cheese is creamy, cheesy, well seasoned and honestly so good. I could eat this everyday of the week. The milkshakes are delicious and a great way to wash down the fries. The fries themselves are golden brown, crispy, seasoned well and now my favorite in New York. Super friendly and professional staff, knowledgeable about the menu, the ingredients and helpful in helping us pick what to go. I am really looking forward to going back and bringing more friends! This is a must try.",,,
2,Alan N.,"New York, NY",284,230,808,4.0,10/19/2018,"First off, I just want to say the fries and tater tots here are AMAZING! Double fried French fries with a good amount of salt on top. Probably the best tater tots I've ever had. The decor of the place is fun and silly. It grabs your attention and its definitely a great place to go to late at night. I hate to knock off a star, but I wasn't a huge fan of the loaded fries they had. I still think they need to tweak it a bit cause its not very good yet. Everyone on my table all agreed and had the same thought. The Drunk Guys: Definitely that guacamole needs some salt. Very bland. If the bacon was salty it would balance out the lack of flavor from the guac but the bacon was also very underwhelming. They missed an opportunity with making that bacon fried to perfection. The Mac N Cheese: I definitely was let down a bit by this one a lot because this was the one I was most excited about. The cheese was a bit watery and wasn't the thick stringy cheese that it needs to be. Maybe I had a bad batch but definitely people on my table were not impressed. 5/5 for the quality of the fries and tater tots alone. 3/5 on their toppings. But if they can get their topping right, this place is going to be a slam dunk!",1,,1
3,Vanessa M.,"New York, NY",130,657,1248,5.0,10/18/2018,"Great space and wonderful story.! You wouldn't know or expect this idea to have come from young, passionate individuals unless you had the opportunity to meet them. The space is inviting and fun and makes you automatically relax, sit back and enjoy your fries!Even though I like my fries a little less ""fried/oily"" they were perfectly seasoned and tasted delicious with the HOMEMADE sauces! Yes, they have a full list of homemade sauces!Tots are perfect inside and a bit crunchy on the outside. They aren't cooked so much where it is just one Big Crunch, they still have some potato mush inside -yay!The loaded tots and fries are also amazing with just the right amount of each ingredient so they don't over power the overall taste experience. Tots not fries get mushy underneath all that goodness and portions are just right to get you full! My favorite was actually the Mac and cheese tots (could be made with any potato). The Mac and cheese alone was great and just enough cheesy goodness to compliment those fries!Well done FryGuys - I will be back for a late night snack!Plus this establishment is nut free! Yay for being allergy conscious!",1,1,1
4,Amrita A.,"New York, NY",180,220,726,4.0,10/18/2018,"Fry Guys is a different world tucked away on the edge of LES. The owners who are friendly and warm have a wonderful story to share about how this concept came about. Fry Guys have centered their concept around fries which are perfectly cooked and can be topped with a whole load of toppings like guac, bacon, pulled pork, bbq,mac n cheese. It's nothing like the Canadian poutine which is a refreshing take on loaded fries. They have taken the concept and run with it the best they could and the fries here really do satisfy the craving heart. The space itself deserves a review of its own. Many personal Details and vibrancy fill the restaurant and its a lot of fun just sitting there gazing at those while mindlessly hogging on their perfectly cooked fries! Having said that, the space itself is quite small and can seat may be 8-10 people. Which is why it is encouraged to take their food to go",1,1,1
5,Brandon H.,"Queens, Queens, NY",89,122,450,5.0,9/14/2018,"So your probably thinking Brandon!  5 stars? Really? But let me tell you what makes Fryguys so special. I love their Mac and Cheese Tots something you definitely should try! I can't stand tatter tots but the guy behind the counter strongly recommended I try this dish! It was so good. The Mac and cheese ain't that krafts garbage! Is real Mac and cheese. Cooked through and through but you can't still get a nice little cheese pull action. Inside the shop feel like music history smacking you in the face. The floor has records molded into it, both classic and current albums. Their walls are like the music hall of fame. So many beloved artist that will have you gazing for minutes. The vibe is chill and their chocolate shake is amazing. This is a place you should add to your list  trust me you won't forget!",3,1,3

Step inside FryGuys where they have funky interior wall art and serve up some excellent fries, tatertots, cupcakes, and milkshakes. I loved the Mac and Cheese tater tots and the cookie and cream milkshake.",,,
7,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,2.0,8/29/2018,"Late Saturday night, trying to find a quick place to grab some food to go. Bright, fun interior with stools to sit down but with a takeout option as well.Several pre-made choices for both fries and tots, as well as deserts. Settled on the ""Drunk Guy"" with curly fries instead of regular ($10ish). Food was ready within several minutes, packed up in a container tightly. When I got home, realized they had given classic fries instead of the curly I asked for. As for the the meal itself, the fries are cooked fine, but the cheese was that fake-tasting variety. Also, the bacon is more like the bacon-bits condiment rather than actual cooked bacon. Overall disappointed in what I got.While the guy behind the counter was super friendly and the food was delivered quickly, didn't feel like the fries were worth the price.",3,1,1
8,Carol L.,"New York, NY",657,182,497,5.0,10/18/2018,"No idea why this place isn't rated higher!I've tried:- Big Daddy Kane Shack- The Fry Guy- Nacho Tots- Mac n Cheese Tater Tots - The Drunk Guy- Garlic Aioli, Chipotle Mayo, Honey MustardFirst, I love their sauces. The Garlic Aioli is to die for and if you like Honey Mustard/Chipotle Mayo, those are both amazing options too. Second, their fries and tater tots are SO crispy. (I believe they're fried twice at two different temperatures). My only slight con is that there can be a lot of ""tiny"" crunchy pieces at the bottom of the fries aka ""fry bits"" which I don't really like, but some people love them!Their Mac n Cheese and Guac are also both super good and made in house! I also loved their Big Daddy Kane Shake, which is basically a cookies and cream shake. Pro-tip: Check in on Yelp for 10% off!",2,1,1
9,Dominek T.,"New York, NY",537,331,539,5.0,8/12/2018,"Finally got to check out the infamous FRYGUYS!  The decor feels like I am channeling my Lisa Frank days in grade school and photos of alot pop icons.  The is a small space so I don't recommend bring a whole crew of people.  They have one large table that can fit about 4 people and then a couple bar seats as well. FryGuys has seriously created a menu of things I never knew I needed on top of fries.  My personal favorite is The Drunk Guy and includes guac, bacon, and cheese.  It was literally heaven in a bucket.  Since this is rather small space it does take some time for them to get the food out to you so have some patience.  They also serve up milkshakes as well.  This is super fun and has some instgram-able food as well that taste even better than it looks!",3,,3
10,Arlene Y.,"New York, NY",535,276,287,4.0,8/5/2018,"the decor for fryguys is super fun- there are disco balls, a collage of NYC photos and celebrities, and rainbow graffiti wall.What makes fryguys stand out from other french fry restaurants is the  extensive list of fries and toppings that they have. You can choose from curly fries, tator tots,french fries, and fire fries. I went with the loaded fries with the nacho tots. Firstly, I love tator tots and any time I see it on the menu, I have to get it. The tots came with gauc, shredded cheese, sour cream, and pico de gallo. I loved all the different flavors, it felt like I was eating a taco bowl with tots. I also sampled the fire fry with mac and cheese. oh my goodness the mac and cheese was insane- talk about carbs on carbs!! The mac and pork sliders were amazing. The mac and cheese went so well with the pulled pork (which was also very flavorful).The employee working there was so nice and accommodating. Overall, I really enjoyed fryguys. Next time, I would love to come back to try their dessert.",2,,1
11,Efraim S.,"New York, NY",23,342,485,5.0,10/18/2018,The owners are terrific and so committed to creating a fun space. The french fries are incredible. Sauces full of flavor. I honestly prefer the fries plain more than anything else but I think the mac and cheese is the best one.,,,
12,Kelci R.,"Washington, DC",106,5,0,5.0,11/19/2018,"This place has some of the best tater tots I've ever had! I got the mac & cheese tots, which were amazing. I never thought about how these foods combined would make a great concoction. The price was reasonable for the amount of food you get. I was full and still had about 8 tots to go. The staff was super nice and helpful. The aesthetic was a plus. I highly recommend this spot!",,,
13,Amy J.,"Dyker Heights, NY",72,38,43,5.0,9/13/2018,"How did I just find out about this place?! The ultimate loaded fries galore. Came here on a fryday afternoon & the place wasn't crowded. We got our order really fast! Tried the popular ""Drunk Guys"" which is basically bacon bits, guac and cheese on top of fries. You could substitute for curly fries if you like. Fries were cooked really well! The only thing I would say is the guac needed a little more taste but overall it was delicious! Next time I come here I would wanna try their shakes! Heard great stuff about them!",3,,4
14,Jessica D.,"Brooklyn, NY",475,398,981,5.0,8/26/2018,"This place is East Village summed up- radiant art covering every corner, friendly and chill servers, and FRIES!! The best thing about this place is probably the service (I'd come back for that alone) and plus they're cute! The portions are great to share for 2 people. There's so many different kinds of fries, sauces, sweet treats, etc. You can come as a group and get fries that feed four. Nacho Tots ($10)- 4/5 Guacamole, sour cream, cheese, pico de gallo- all the things I love! The tots are delicious as well and they give a good amount of guacamole as well. Mac 'n Cheese Tater Tots ($10)- 4/5 The mac and cheese was creamy and smooth and tots were delicious per usual. I think this would be great with bacon!",25,13,25

If you like Shibu Inus, disco balls, and the color pink, you would definitely appreciate this place.They dont accept cash. Card only. The Chipotle Mayo sauce was very tasty and not too thick. I recommend getting the Fry Guy loaded fries. Very moist pulled pork :) I was surprised to see the place empty on a Friday at 6pm.",2,,2
16,Laverne W.,"Jersey City, NJ",56,68,118,5.0,8/30/2018,"True to form & taste!!! I finally made it to the French fry Mecca; been following their IG for about a year. The location is not a skip and hop if you're not in that neck of the woods. But I had the kinda day and the car, so I was ""what the heck"" let's go. I was blessed to find parking just down the block and a short walk back to FryGuys.  I walked into this psychedelic retro dive.  The kid behind the counter looked overworked, he was cashier & frier. Oh boy. Elated to have arrived I would have like for the kid to be a bit perkier; like I said it was that kinda day.  I looked past his flat demeanor because at this point nothing was going to stop me. I made it to the Fry Mecca. I ordered ""the FryGuy"" fries, topped w/shredded pork drizzled BBQ sauce. I sat at the side wall-bar, eyed over the 80's photo collage wall and reminisced mentally of the music and tv memorabilia. This is my new happy hour joint!",,,

A lovely mural on one wall and opposite that is several pictures of celebrities.You have several options to add to the frys. There are milkshakes and lots of bacon.I just feel they need diet soda!

18,Joeana N.,"Toronto, Canada",117,268,2880,4.0,8/1/2018,"Craving for some fries? You HAVE to try Fry Guys! They specialize in everything potato. From fries to curly fries and tots !Love how colourful this shop is from inside and outside. The first thing we noticed after walking in was how colourful and cute the wall on the left is, it was painted with emojis and cats. On the other side of the shop they hang a lot of pictures and newspaper articles of sports players and celebrities. It gave us a two in one vibe and it was very interesting! We tried a bucket of fries. We were recommended to try the ""Drunk Guy"" with Garlic Aiolio sauce, and the ""Big Daddy Kane"" Shake. The fries were made fresh when we ordered. Their fries don't have the typical greasy feeling to it, it was nice. The fries were topped with cheese, bacon and guacamole that looked like ice cream! Adding a sauce on the side is a must! We had the garlic ailio, it paired perfectly with the drunk guy.  As for the milkshake, the Shake was a cookies and cream milkshake with just the right amount of sugar. It wasn't too sweet, just perfect. The flavour was strong and delicious! We expected to feel greasy after the visit, but it was surprisingly lighter than expected! We enjoyed the service and the very instagramable setting. And If you are a potato love, this is definitely the place for you!",2,,1

20,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4582,2943,9008,5.0,3/7/2018,"Do you like smokey barbecue pulled pork, guacamole, bacon, french fries, melted cheese, tater tots, mac and cheese, and all kinds of delicious dipping sauces? Well, you can have them all in one giant tower of heart attack. I suppose you could just get yourself a regular size order of fries, but where's the fun in that? (I'm not even sure you can get the tower regularly, but I did find out that they bust out the tower if you take over the adorable, funky space for your friend's surprise birthday party.)Between the iconic photographs on one side and the colorful murals on the other, the disco balls twirling up top and the owners McKenzie and Marco (?) keeping the party going, FryGuys is fun. It's the late-night eatery I wish was here back when I lived on 2nd Street, and it'll hit the drunken munchies spot for you.",16,9,18
21,Davis T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",192,48,12,3.0,9/29/2018,"The vibe and aroma on this place was promising but it did not live up to the mystique. The fries are extremely expensive. They do not take cash. I had checked in on yelp upon arrival and received a 10% off coupon but when I tried to use it at check out the counter server said he didn't know how to use it. He didn't even offer to take the 10% off, did not try at all to be helpful. It also took awhile to get my order.Disappointing",3,,

Unfortunately, as much as I liked the decor, the food was definitely lacking.My friend and I ordered the fire fries and the mac'n'cheese tots. The fire fries had absolutely no taste. Not only did the price to portion ratio seem unreasonable ($6 for a small, plain serving of fries), but the fries had no flavor. I expected them to be somewhat salty at the very least, but they were limp and tasteless. The mac'n'cheese tots were better, but the macaroni was lukewarm at best and rubbery to eat.Overall, the fries and tots were super meh, but the loaded fries are extremely Instagrammable and the Lisa Frank-esque cats are a plus.",2,,

The place is small, but they made it work.We're interested in one thing: Decadent French FriesHere's the skinny, you can order classic fries or fire fries (spicy) then there are about 15 different ketchups to dip your fried treat.My son wanted guacamole, I said eww and so we chose smokey bbq. There is regular ketchup on the table if you want to keep it simple. Overall, the fries were standard Idaho potatoes cut into fries. IMHO, they weren't decadent fries that I couldn't put down. They kinda tasted over cooked?? Look at my picture, they're very dark and filled with sadness.Plain ol' regular fries with 15 different sauces. More for you, I'm out",11,5,8

I thought that these fries were absolutely delicious. I really loved the pork as well, it was very flavorful and added a lot to this meal.

They are even Whole30 and Paleo approved, lmao. But not all fries are created equally and worthy of praise.FryGuys is worthy of praise! The decor is really cool and low-key makes me think of Lisa Frank/90s nostalgia. I ordered the drunk guy because I love avocado and bacon. It was really delicious, a lot of bacon, and an excellent amount of avocado.

Album covers and musical artist photos on the wall. The place seats approximately 10-11 people. We ordered the drunk guy minus the bacon, and the southern guy both were pretty good.

Great old school hip hop was playing while i was there. One wall was filled with old black & white pics of celebs, and the other side looks like a kid's coloring book exploded on it (in the best way possible)I got the Drunk Guy fries which has fries topped with cheese, bacon, and a nice scoop of guac. The guac was fresh and had the perfect amount of lime in it (i hate when there's not enough lime in my guac). The cheese sauce was good and tasted real, not like your typical cheese sauce. The bacon was bacon. The fries themselves were perfect and held up to all the toppings.I only wish the serving was a little bigger because i def wanted more when i was done!

Not even going to lie, I think I was in love with this place before I even had their fries because the second you walk in, you feel like you're in some rainbow, kitschy, acid-trippy dream of a place and so I was of course instantly obsessed. And that love only deepened once I got some of those fries in my mouth because boy oh boy were they delicious. My friends and I got an order of the Fire Fry and an order of The Fry Guy (pulled pork, smokey BBQ sauce) and I swear we inhaled both within 5 minutes of getting them. The drunchies were realllll, guys. We also ordered 3 sauces--the roasted garlic aioli, chipotle mayo and the honey sesame--to drench our fries in because we all know fries always taste better with some extra flavor. While both fries were delish, I have to say that my personal favorite had to be the Fire Fry because I love me some spice and these bad boys came with plenty of heat. Coupled with the roasted garlic aioli, they were literal fry perfection. Now, it's only been two days since I had those fries and I'm already seriously craving the heck out of them.

I ordered the tater tots topped with mac & cheese, the BBQ mac & cheese pulled pork sliders (comes with fries), and the unicorn ice cream! The pulled pork was GOOD! So flavorful, had a nice bbq flavor without being drenched in sauce. The tots were amazing, and the ice cream was just as you'd imagine a unicorn ice cream would taste (magical and sweet lol). All in all, def visit this place!! The guy (Ortiz) at the counter was really kind and made some good recommendations when I asked him for some. Also, the fries weren't just hanging under a heating lamp, I heard him frying them after I ordered. 100% in my book!!",1,,

Hello, nurse, I'm home! The space is elaborately decorated, yet seriously small and has very little sitting room. Also, it was packed with a line when I went a few weeks ago. But still super amounts of fun.First off, this place sells mostly only french fries. They didn't have milkshakes yet when I came. That's a new thing. But if you don't like decadent fries covered with unhealthy stuff, then get out. The two of us split an order of their basic cheese fries. This one was a fail and let down to me. I didn't like their queso cheese so much here because it tasted super powdery and artificial. The fries are also a little too powerfully seasoned, which is something I rarely say about a french fry. But it seems they now have altered it to regular seasoning and spicy, so it might have been tweaked. The second item we ordered though boosted this rating up sky high. Get the Southern Guy, we went with the waffle style, it comes loaded with fried chicken and a maple syrup gravy that I never thought in a million years I would want to drink a gallon of this shizzle. Add some sauce on the side. I LOVE SAUCE. Roasted Garlic Aioli, Yes! Pesto Aioli, Yes! Spicy Mayo, Sriracha Ketchup, Basil Mayo, Smokey BBQ, Yes, yes, yes! GIVE ME MORE SAUCE! They now apparently have chocolate sea salt?! I clearly need to come back again. Definitely a solid drunk food option in this neighborhood.",7,4,4

A friend and I went on a Sunday day afternoon and at the register waited an unenthusiastic employee who did not even greet us. The place was empty and didn't even smell like food was cooking. There was no pulled pork off their menu which is half the reason why we went there. The worker half ass answered our question and did not make any attempt to suggest something. We finally settled on fire tots with the Mac and cheese. Let's start by saying, there was nothing fire about these tots. They didn't even have salt on them. They were bland and so was the Mac and cheese. There was no ketchup to add to the dry tots and they only had two napkins left. Honestly I could have fried frozen tots at home and would've enjoyed them more. Sad to say but we ended up throwing them out. Such a shame.",2,1,
37,Shaowni M.,"Long Beach, CA",0,30,14,2.0,8/29/2018,"My friends and I found this place from a video on Facebook and decided to try out the guac fries. Well, it's a small place really, and far from any subway station, so driving is the best option. Now, I value treatment of guests a very crucial part. We walked in and there were two guys behind the counter and none of them greeted us, or showed us their menu, like we were supposed to know everything. We ordered the guac fries. Nice interiors. Fries were limp, not that great. Guac was nothing special. Wish they had seasoned it a little at least. And the amount of guac was frugal compared to the amount of fries. Not going back or recommending anyone to try that.",1,,

I applaud you on the coolest store design ever. While waiting for your order to be made, there is just so much to look at! Disco balls, vinyls, cat unicorns. Yessss guys, I am personally a sucker for aesthetically pleasing restaurants. Lets get to the fries. I ordered a classic waffle fries with a side of garlic aoili dipping sauce because I like to be basic when it comes to my deep fried potatoey goodness. I tend to like wedge style fries more than thin stringy ones and these waffle fries were thick are double fried just like all fries should be. I had dinner plans right after this unplanned ""snack"" and I seriously couldn't help myself and ate the whole damn thing. My boyfriend ate some too but I kid you not, it was mostly me.",4,1,1
39,Peggy C.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,1,1,4.0,9/30/2018,"I visited FryGuys on September 13th and got the Nacho Tots with Sriracha Ketchup. The tater tots were freshly fried and topped with a huge scoop of guac! Although I thought the food was really good, the apathetic staff and card only policy brought my rating to 4 stars.",,,
40,Jenn C.,"Manhattan, NY",492,194,364,5.0,10/10/2017,"Loved my experience! First, owners are fantastic. McKenzie and Marcos were both super sweet and checked up on me to make sure I enjoyed my fries. I ordered The Southern Guy with double fried chicken and maple gravy and McKenzie came up to me and said the gravy tasted off tonight and would like me to try something else on the house. It was just great since most times when something tastes off, it's a proactive request from the customer and reactive from the owners. This was my first time being the other way around; owners proactively reaching out to make sure their food is served at its best condition to the customer. I think when owners care about something even tasting a little off and not to par, it just shows that they value their customers, the products they serve and their business. Just made me very loyal to the business and definitely recommend to my friends.I opted then to try The Fry Guy with pulled pork and smokey bbq and it was fantastic. Fries were perfectly fried and seasoned; pork was tender and fatty. Sauce was tangy. Plus, cool vibes from great decor and selection of music. Very unique; haven't seen any business replicate what they have. 10/10 will be back!",5,1,1
41,Wing C.,"Stony Brook, NY",0,16,22,1.0,9/16/2018,Nothing special... They opened at 12 and we were the first ones there.. wanted the pulled pork but it was not even ready yet. The person working behind the counter was also really rude and did not even seem like he wanted to be there. Since they had no pulled pork we got the drunk guy. It was just soggy fries with guac on top. Also got the nacho tots. It was just a crap top ton of sour cream on top of tater tots with a scoop of gauc. Not really nachos. Really wanted to try the pull pork fried but don't want to come back after this first trip here. Better off getting some McDonald fries which taste better and is not $10 an order. I'll.give it an extra 0.5 star for the decor.,,,
42,Anna K.,"New York, NY",47,6,0,5.0,10/24/2018,"If I could eat here every single day, I would. Friendly staff, funky, and cheap enough that I can order multiple potato options. I usually get the Nacho Tots (w/ guac, queso, sour cream, etc), the Fry Guy (fries w/ pulled pork), and/or the Mac & Cheese Tots (self explanatory). Plus the interior is cool and crazy and perfect for a late night stop when you're a little buzzed. FryGuys, I love you. Never change.",,,

The atmosphere was also pretty cool- photographs of the 1900s were on the wall, disco balls hanging, and graffiti on the left wall. It's not a big place but it was spacious enough for a fun snack. Unfortunately the fries were not what I expected. We got the classic fries.  The portion was good, but the fries had a bit of a burnt taste to them. It just didn't taste fresh, even though they said it was a new Batch they just finished. Since the first sauce is free, we ordered the garlic aioli to try, which we liked so we dipped our fries quite often in it to cover for the burnt and dry taste. I'm hoping it was just that day that it tasted that way, so maybe one day I'll be back to give it a second try!",3,1,2
45,Joseph S.,"Chicago, IL",172,182,235,5.0,10/28/2017,I heard about this place on social media and I visited it twice. I've tried the Southern guy fries and the Drunk guy one.

It's not like potatoes are selling for the price of gold on the commodities market last I checked the WSJ. They could and should be more generous. But to add insult to injury, their fries aren't even good. They aren't crisp on the periphery and moist inside like well executed fries should be, just sad and soggy.They won't last.",,1,

The sauce was really salty and the portion size was really small compared to what we remembered having a couple of months back. The tator tots were good but the sauce was just so salty we couldn't really enjoy it. The person who made our order was different from the one who made it the first time we had fries there. I wonder if that made a difference. The first time we went we think the owner was the one who prepared our fries.",2,,

While the fries themselves were delicious, I was pretty disappointed that the cheese sauce wasn't even warm or really cheesy. It was really light and cold although the fries did warm the sauce up. All in all not worth the $6. I would come here again to try something a bit more adventurous. I suppose I really only ordered cheese fries because I thought there would be actual cheese on them. Overall did not have a bad experience. The store front and inside are adorable!",1,,1

50,Andrew L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",45,123,152,5.0,9/30/2017,"So glad I got to check these guys out opening week! As a big fan of french fries, I had to see what they had to offer.First off, this is a really colorful place. You'll see it from the signage to the decor. I think it prides itself on trying to capture that old school mojo: disco balls, rainbows, Polaroid cameras, tie dye, peace signs...The menu is simple (for now) but I can imagine it getting really extensive in the near future. Right now you can select from classic (OG) fries, wavy fries, and sweet potato fries. Then add a sauce of your choice for a buck. Or get one of their signature loaded fries! We tried ""The Fry Guy"" because they were still prepping fresh guac for ""Drunk Guy"", what we really wanted to try. It'll have to wait until next time.But ""The Fry Guy"" was amazing. While we were eating, we wondered if they prepared their own fries and pulled pork, and both questions were answered while eating and chatting with the owners. Yes they do!If you like your fries potato-y then you'll like this place. Packed with flavor and fun toppings, it's a great spot to munch or go all out with a french fry party (disco ball and all). Great music is playing and the decor is a lot of fun. Seating is a little limited and drink selection is a little weak but it's not a deal breaker since it's ""just fries"". Definitely a great bang for your buck and we'll be back!",1,,
51,Justin D.,"Mid-City West, Los Angeles, CA",127,2,0,5.0,10/17/2018,"Great concept that they pull off amazingly. Many great options but I finally decided on the Bacon mac and cheese Tots.

52,Kate J.,"New York, NY",427,427,234,3.0,8/2/2018,"Sort of expensive for some pretty basic fries. They were good, but not unlike other fries I've had at nearby places like Pommes Frites. A small thing of fries is close to $7 if you get any sauces on the side and that seems a bit excessive to me -- I'd probably rather eat the $1 McDonalds fries tbh. The aesthetics of this place are really the highlight (the interior is small but beautiful) but other than that, not super notable.",,,

The place is pretty small, but the decor and style were cool. Unfortunately, I was not blown away by their fries. They were very crispy and salty, so you can say I was not impressed. The service was alright, but I honestly wouldn't try this place again. It's overhyped by social media, which is unfortunate, you should probably only take a few pics and bounce.",1,3,1

I thought their menu selection was impressive and it stretches far beyond just french fries. They have loaded fry options like pulled pork on top and mac n cheese on top. My friend and I got the mac n cheese tater tots, the fryguy and curly fries. The pulled pork was really tender and flavorful, and a big portion of meat. The mac n cheese was cheesy, creamy and really packed with flavor. Curly fries are crispy, flavorful and a good snack with some dipping sauces. We also tried their new cupcakes. wow. I'm not a dessert guy, but these are extra good. Fresh, not too sugar packed and real creative with the flavors. The space itself is real new york which I really appreciate. Disco balls, vinyl records, old photos and dope music. Pricing is on point, you can order a lot for not a lot of money. I recommended it to all my friends traveling to New York and look forward to going back. I for sure want to see what new concepts they come out with. This place is dope!!!",,,
57,P C.,"New York, NY",24,199,355,5.0,2/4/2018,"As a French fry connoisseur, it is my opinion that FryGuys serves truly awesome fries. FryGuys fries are thin and crispy, unlike another French fry establishment whose fries are thick and limp. These little guys are crispy on the outside, with soft guys on the inside, which means they're exactly the way they should be. They're also perfectly salted. Portion size is very good as it relates to price and quality. One of my other favorite things about FryGuys is that their cheese is actual cheddar and not some kind of canned orange evil. The cheese sauce is very delicious. The decor in FryGuys is very cool. Sorry for not photographing (because I was hungrily wolfing down my fries), but they've got tons of recording artists on the wall and a bunch of disco balls hanging from the ceiling. Plus, let's not forget the emoji and Lisa Frank-like cuteness on the wall...Additionally, the folks who work at FryGuys are amazingly kind and compassionate. This 5-Star review is merited on numerous levels! I'll be back.",,,

FryGuys has a fun energy that's infectious. FryGuys serves as a great place to fill up on tasty carbs, layered in delicious add-ons with friends, on casual dates, or soaking up a night of boozing. food? it's all about the fries. you can choose between three fries types and add on a sauce for extra. or go for the loaded fries which are preset add-ons.highly recommend the SOUTHERN GUY: fries topped in double fried chicken and soaked in maple gravy. nice mix of the savory and sweet. grease factor, not that bad at all. the Drunk Guy comes in at a close second (bacon, guac, cheese). both perfect in their own ways. Yummm.the staff? met the owners. they rock and are superfriendly. they walked me through the concept in a few minutes and stand behind making FryGuys part of EV/Abc City. cool peeps with a cool food concept for an area in dire need of fun different food spots that don't involve a craft food/cocktail hook.SPOILER ALERT: milkshake are being considered as a new item on the menu!drops mic like it's hotter than these amazing friesi outzzz",16,12,16

Sober.. just fine and dandy, nothing to write home about. Ordered ""southern guy"" and ""drunk guy"". Drunk guy fries are super yummy (cheese sauce, bacon, guac). Southern guy was just ok for me (fried chicken chunks with maple gravy). Both orders lacked sauce (whether it be gravy on the southern guy or cheese sauce on the drunk guy). Once you consumed from the top layer, the fries underneath were dry DRY dry...  MORE SAUCE/GRAVY PLEASE!!  My order got screwed up, ordered classic fries with the southern guy and wavy -aka cottage fries- with the drunk guy. Ended up with wavy in both orders. Now don't get me wrong,  these are tasty fries and you'll enjoy them after pounding a few beers or puffin on something fun... $8 for an order of ""specialty"" fries.. hmm.  They're potatoes folks.Kitchy throwback decor, as a Gen-Xer, I actually played cds and vinyl (and cassette tapes) and had huge collections of each.. it's cute to see them used as decor.. Why in my day there was no music streaming or i-pods.. ya had to carry a goddamn giant walkman or diskman and go to Tower Records to buy albums.. and Pommes Frites on 2nd Ave and St. Mark's was da bomb (teary eyed cause the building collapsed)... oh sorry I digress, lol.",4,5,2

The fries were over done I even questioned to my partner if they were sweet potato fries. The shakes lacked the thickness of a shake & tasted like they were mixed with chocolate & strawberry syrup.

The bacon was barely cooked fat chunks. So salty almost inedible Pulled pork fries- tastier but still gross. The bbq sauce was disgustingly sweet and after two bites gets really gross.

While these are a good size for sharing, I was able to eat it all myself (don't judge). Flavors were on point, although I didn't taste too much of the bacon for some reason.

Things are so random that they work, I especially love the disco balls and the graffiti wall. I came here on a friday night with my friend and I was blown away by the fries and the milkshakes. We got the Nacho fries and the mac and cheese tater tots. I also splurged and got the Big Daddy Kane shake. The food came really fast but the milkshake took a little longer but it was understandable. Each dish had enough toppings to complement the amount of fries so we were able to enjoy each bite. The only thing I didn't like about my experience was the rudeness of the employee that was working that night. My friend and I had a few questions and took a little longer to decide what we wanted but he gave off the vibe that he didn't want to be there and that helping us was too much work. Other than that, everything else was fine and it's definitely not enough to prevent me from coming back.",,,

We ordered the Drunk Guy based off of the suggestion we got from the unenthusiastic employee behind the counter. $10 later we were presented with a tiny portion of fries covered in a decent cheese sauce and topped with bacon. The fries were okay, but the employee's demeanor made it seem like he'd rather us be anywhere than in his restaurant. With that in mind, the 99c pizza shop next door makes great pizza and the man behind the counter makes even better conversation.Looking for fries? Go to Pomme Frites!! Cheaper, better portions, a huge selection of sauces, and they'll never make you feel unwelcome.",,,

I had honey mustard, queso and guac on mine. My boyfriend had chicken and bbq sauce on his. We loved them! Definitely worth trying and coming back for. They were very flavorful and there were a variety of interesting items and sauces to try.I loved this place. I hope with time they expand their menu because all they have for now is fries.

85,Emilee L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",202,3,1,5.0,8/15/2018,"Unique loaded fries with endless possibilities! I love their menu, they have something for everyone! The drunk guy fries with guac have to be my favorite. The shop itself is so retro, which makes the overall dining experience one of my favorites",,,
86,Erica Novota N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,22,22,2.0,3/16/2018,I had high hopes for this new fry place in the LES but it was a let down.  The fries were ok nothing special actually.  The topping I chose was the pulled pork with bbq sauce.  The pork was cold and the sauce was super sweet.  Overall not good. The only thing good about this place was the cute dog I got to play with  and the fun decor.  Will not go back again.,,,
87,J N.,"Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, NY",0,63,0,3.0,7/23/2018,"Those INSIDER videos or whatever food videos on Facebook got me super interested in this right when I saw it but it turned out be ehhh. Ordered the fries with bacon, cheese and guac on top. The fries themselves are not the fries I would prefer and the serving was just underwhelming since it is about $10. It was a tinyyy scoop of guac that sat on top. Pretty disappointed. You could definitely buy loaded fries someplace else.",,,
88,Anna P.,"Manhattan, NY",152,20,1,4.0,12/27/2017,"Came here with my boyfriend's family after a comedy show at Bar 2A. I was pretty stuffed after an earlier pizza dinner and wasn't sure if I wanted to eat anything, but I couldn't resist the smell and taste of these fries. We got the fried chicken fries and the original, with a sweet dipping sauces. They were so good--crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside, and just salty enough. The chicken was perfect. I even thought I saw a celebrity there. The colorful mural is fun, and I love how they're open late. The cashier was super friendly. No Diet Coke, though!",1,,
89,Lauren K.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",2,12,6,5.0,2/14/2018,"Had such a fun experience at FryGuys! I found out about the restaurant from Instagram and thought all of the fries looked amazing and I was very happy when I went to find out that they taste amazing too. Went with two of my friends for a late night snack after a show and we had the Mac & Cheese Tots (absolute food heaven) and the original fries with two sauce trios so we could try all of the fun different sauces (the chipotle mayo and garlic aioli were out of this world)! Everyone working was nice, friendly, we had great service, the food was perfect, and it was a great end to our night! I'll definitely be back to try The Drunk Guy fries soon.",,,
90,Banna S.,"New York, NY",0,6,1,1.0,12/27/2017,"Do not order from this place!! The way the $40 fries I ordered from this place was delivered it made me sick. The cardboard container with french fries was half wrapped in aluminium foil, the plastic fork was half way dipped in the guacamole, the guac's color was almost brown and to make things worse it all was shlapped (this is the most accurate word to describe it) in a paper brown bag which was left completely open aaaaand the delivery guy pulls the brown bags out of his own leather backpack.... no plastic bag to wrap the order, no insulated delivery bag no nothing. I placed the order at 1:30pm and the order arrived at 2:55pm, mind you I live within walking distance. Threw everything in the garbage and never tasted anything, but the fries look nasty,soaked in oil and look burned. Idk if I got a bad batch or what... but I won't return to this place at no point in time. You've been warned !",1,,
91,Naome L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,2.0,10/10/2018,Fries are overpriced. Service was whatever. I'm pretty sure the guy was blazed or something because he got our whole order wrong and we were the only ones in the place.,,,
92,Rebecca A.,"Stuart, FL",0,4,4,5.0,4/1/2018,My favorite place in the city for fries. Super creative dishes and really lovely people making them. The decor and the music add so much to the experience too. Don't forget a root beer float after the fries!,,,
93,Kyle B.,"New York, NY",82,27,20,3.0,2/11/2018,"I really wanted to like this place. I live so close and was so happy when they opened up, and i have a secret obsession with cheese fries (not the fancy kind either, like papaya king cheese). So i go in one night, late and tipsy, and i have been building this place up in my head for months, they have spray-painted walls, awesome decor and friendly staff, but sadly they don't have good fries. Over-seasoned, over-salted (and i usually prefer salty things) and the biggest disappointment of all, a watered down tasteless cheese that chipotle could make fun of.",,,
94,Nancy N.,"Manhattan, NY",183,9,1,4.0,6/28/2018,"Very cute and happy vibes casual place. Getting three dips is key but you'll def need two orders of fries if you want to take advantage of using all the dips. But for $6 I wish you got some more. Curly fries did not disappoint. Would love if there was a vegetarian/vegan ""meat"" option for loaded menu options!",,,
95,Ciara D.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",49,21,2,4.0,8/31/2018,"Had a nice sized portion of the Mac and cheese tots add bacon and my friend had the drunk guy fries with the guacamole. We also had the 3 sauces (honey mustard, garlic aioli, fry guy sauce which is basically bbq mixed with mayo). Waited some time for the food and the cans of root beer, and there were only two other people there in the shop, which is pretty small- one short table with 3 chairs and then a bar and maybe 4 stools against the wall. The kitchen is tiny so only two people fit back there so I think that combined with the one employee leaving the store to go outside was the cause of the delay. Also, I guess I finished my tots due to the contact high I was getting while waiting for the food and right before you walk in. After we ordered and were waiting, it got crowded so better to go early in the night or after you drink so you can soak up and carb up! Great photos and mural and sports magazine covers! Glad I went but won't go back because the food wasn't as special as social media hypes it up to be.",,,
96,Tyreek G.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",79,4,0,1.0,9/16/2018,This place is terrible. I was really excited to try their food as I had seen some pictures on social media. The gentleman behind the counter was not very helpful and almost seemed like he had an attitude. In addition the food was subpar and the advertised Pico de Gallo I had on top of my tots turned out to be just chopped tomatoes and raw onions.,,,
97,Bonnie G.,"New York, NY",127,476,780,3.0,11/1/2017,"Rustic, thick French fries here. Tried just the mesquite BBQ sauce (like eating a rack of ribs, amazing) and the garlic aioli (super strong and savory). Still, not totally enthralled by this place and likely wouldn't go back for a while.",,,1

99,Jackie M.,"Bronx, NY",11,76,55,2.0,8/13/2018,"So disappointed, we came here based off their Instagram page photos, firstly the guy on the counter barely acknowledged we were there, want a milkshake....nah....haven't got that....ok I'll have a Diet Coke then.....nah haven't got that, ok what do you Have? Sunkist Or reg Coke, ok I'll take a Sunkist.....got one that was roasting hot, had to switch it for a Coke instead. The guacamole is smashed avocado, the pico de Gallo is chopped tomatoes and onions. The portions are TINY!! My husband got Mac n cheese tots with an extra charge for about 10tiny dogs of bacon on top. So disappointing, we came all the way from WestChester to eat here, the menu is tiny and then they don't have half of what is actually on the menu, we're going to find another place to eat now, cos we're still hungry. I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here, $25+ for 2 tiny portions of tots and 2 sodas....go to Macdonalds....",,,
100,Jeffrey H.,"Manhattan, NY",24,10,71,5.0,5/13/2018,This place is absolutely delicious. Whenever I'm down in the east village I make it a point to come here. Every time I've gone the fries are always cooked so perfectly and they have an awesome variety of different flavors. I've recommended fryguys to a few friends of mine to go and check out and each one had great things to say! Can't wait for the next time I'm down in the village. Oh and the decor is pretty sweet too!,,,
101,Drew F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,31,1,5.0,10/8/2017,"I came with a big group so we tried a bunch of their fries and dips. All were so good, fresh and seasoned really well. The Southern guy is absolutely delicious, fried chicken and gravy are spot on. I had it with the guacamole which added a nice fresh and cold element, to contrast the hot crispy fries. Also had the cheese fries and the sweet potato fries - there was something for everyone. Decor and atmosphere was fun, and staff were all nice. Wait time was only five minutes, which was filled with throw back music. Will be back soon.",1,,
102,Kameko E.,"Plantation, FL",105,3,1,3.0,5/26/2018,"Got there when they opened. Another lady was there who had an issue that they only accept card... not a big deal for me. Ordered the fire tots with mac and chz. First the noodles where put on top and the cheese sauce was drizzled on top of that, not mixed together... not really what i was expecting. Then i take a bite and the sauce and noodles are ice cold. I asked the gents if they could warm it up and they said they would just make me a new one and apologized, blaming it on just opening. So the new one comes out and is only chilled now instead of freezing cold. Im starving by now so i just eat it. The tots underneath were actually really good, but unfortunately were not as enjoyable as they should have been with the cold mac & chz. I might suggest that they actually use the stove in the back to heat things up before serving them.... just a crazy idea from an observer.... Overall disappointing experience especially bc i went out of my way during a short trip to new york to try this place... should have gone to Katz around the corner...smh.",,,
103,Sara E.,"Philadelphia, PA",94,232,142,1.0,3/10/2018,"$6 for dry, cold fries? You've gotta be kidding me. The guy at the counter was friendly. The decor was tacky as hell and nothing stood out.

104,Rumana M.,"New York, NY",30,22,30,5.0,11/1/2017,Came her for the first time and was not disappointed! The service was good as well as the cheese fries we ordered. Will definitely be coming back to try their other menu items. The decor is fantastic! I was at awe the while time I was there.,,,
105,Anupam T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,4,0,4.0,6/9/2018,"I'm a big fan of local family owned businesses and this place didn't let me down. Wonderful twist to something simple as fries. Great toppings for delicious late night munchies. I went with 5 of my friends and got the Frycano, which had people on the streets stopping outside the window to take a picture lol. It tasted just as good! Only thing I'd change: I wish the place was a big bigger. There's isn't that much room to sit especially if you have a fairly large group. Luckily there weren't any other customers there when we went around 10pm so that wasn't an issue for us.",,,

Were out of ingredients, and chicken was 20% deep fried chunks of unidentifiable. Burnt, lukewarm fries. Was excited to come here to taste all my favorite things together but ultimately disappointed.

As a child of the 90's I love the Lisa Frank decor, unfortunately,​ that's the only thing I loved about this place. I ordered the tator tots with cheese sauce, the sauce tasted like a powder mix that wasn't fully mixed together. It was worse than the queso at Chipotle!",,,
109,Kapil P.,"Richmond, VA",0,24,2,2.0,4/29/2018,Cool spot but poor service. We ordered two orders of classic fries and waited 30-40 minutes for our order. When the fries finally came out they were cold. Overall poor experience,,,

The food took a bit of a wait due to it being such a busy night, but it was well worth it! They also checked in every once in awhile to make sure everything was perfect, which was really appreciated.

111,Meghan O.,"Astoria, New York, NY",1,29,21,4.0,10/22/2017,"Very fun! The inside is decorated with florescent cartoon animal wall murals, black-and-white photos, records and disco balls. There is very limited seating but if you come during an off-time it's a nice place to sit and enjoy the funky decor. The staff are very friendly and ask about the food. The soundtrack is a fun 90's throwback and it's located central to a lot of bars and restaurants. The fries are delicious and I would recommend the loaded Southern Guy and Drunk Guy combos which are very filling.",,,
112,Michelle R.,"New York, NY",0,29,0,1.0,3/20/2018,"Terrible experience. I know they deliver through grub hub and seamless, but I guess they feel since they're not doing the delivery themselves the quality of their food shouldn't matter. Waited an hour and 30 minutes for some fries and the young man I spoke with truly didn't care. I told him I'd like to put in my order again so I can get my food at least semi fresh. I was told there was nothing he could do. Definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I know. Do better, guys.",,,

I typically never leave reviews (tbh this is my first) but this place, and these fries, deserve the highest praise. They have so many toppings to choose from, with the fries themselves being perfection. So. The fries. They're crispy, fresh and thick cut Idaho deliciousness with the option of being covered in cheese, bacon, guacamole and more.

Upon arrival, me and my sister checked out the menu that the guy behind the counter handed to us without a word. We sat down and decided we would get one order of Mac and cheese tots and Mac and cheese curly fries. When we ordered, the guy behind the counter paused, looked at me for about five seconds in silence, and then said ""so you want..."" and repeated my order. We said yes, but then he proceeded to tell us that they didn't have curly fries. All you sell are fries and you don't have curly ones? okay, no big deal. we just ordered the Mac and cheese tots. He then began to cook our order, and once he was finished, he placed it on the counter without a word. we didn't even know our food was done! So we got our food and then he went to the bathroom for about 10 minutes, leaving the store unattended. While he was in the bathroom, someone even came in, waited at the counter for 7 minutes and then left because of the lack of service. We began to eat the food, AND HOLY MOLY IT WAS GREAT. some of the best tots I've ever had, and I've had a lot. After we finished our food, we cleared our table, handed him our tray, and left... all in absolute silence. The only time he spoke to us was to tell us that they didn't have curly fries.

The chicken was perfectly crispy and the gravy was the perfect amount of sweet for the savoryness of the fries and and chicken. Best fries ever! And an amazing atmosphere,,,
122,Nancy D.,"Woodbridge, NJ",0,14,7,1.0,2/22/2018,I saw this place on insider from Facebook. The article made it look so good. Save your time money and energy and skip this place. The fries were definitely from an old batch that were refried and served. The pulled pork was a served cold which made the already dried out fries cold.

They let us add pulled pork onto the drunk guy which was the best of all worlds (hello guac, bacon, queso, and bbq pulled pork!). Fries were nice and crispy, I was concerned that they might be soggy with all the toppings. The portions were huge and we couldn't even finish one order.

Still, don't know why our sauce cups were only half full...Look, not trying to be harsh, but if I'm paying 20 dollars for French fries you gotta give us something to talk about here.

My friend and I got back with our fries that looked like they were cooked in the dirtiest oil ever, were undercooked, and there was hardly any cheese--and I hesitate to call whatever runny orange residue that was there cheese. We just looked at the pictures of the other cheese fries and they looked a lot better than what we got, so maybe it was just bc they were closing but cmon FryGuys--isn't the late night crowd your target?

The owners history is an NYC entrepreneurial inspiring story and the inside of the establishment is super fun with disco balls and 90s artist inspirations like Janet Jackson, Diana Ross, Cher, 2Pac, Biggie and more. You get to listen to old school 90s hits while you wait for your delicious fries- which makes it fun vs. waiting inside those typical terrible lighting fast food places that makes you feel like you've hit a new low in life. This place is the opposite feeling! I also love how the fryguy recipes are unique. My absolute favorite is The Drunk Guy- that avocado and bacon yum yum yum!! They are open super late so very convenient for drunken nights down in the LES and they DELIVER!!! Honestly- when it comes to a quick, delicious filling snack this hits the spot!!

I can't feel my face and I'm afraid of what will happen ""on the other end."" That being said, I hope this business does well and expands, either by opening another location (like Washington Heights????) or by doubling the size of the shop, since there's only about four tables making this better for takeout or for a single person to dine.",,,

The restaurant opens at noon. We showed up at 2:30 and was told we had to wait while they were doing a photo shoot. We waited about 5 minutes for the camera crew to leave before going in. We asked if they were open and the guy behind the counter said not for another 30 minutes to an hour. He proceeded to explain that they were closed for a Thrillest shoot. I asked why didn't they just plan the shoot before they open to the public and he had no answer. I told him we drove from Westchester specifically to come there and he shrugged his shoulders with an unemphatic ""sorry"" and proceeded to tell us that he'd love for us to give them another chance just when they're open. Well, there were no signs of the closure, no postings online, and the camera crew got a few take out orders so they were obviously cooking. Poor planning and blowing off potential customers means more than any Thrillest post.",,,
