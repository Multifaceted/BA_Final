We had the smoked salmon ,gravlax appetizer. and the Roasted Salmon entrée.  Food was great. We will come back. The wine recommended by the waitress was very good.",,,

Updated review",We weren't impressed during our recent visit. The smoked octopus was flavorless.The paella was a big plate of mushy rice.The kale salad was good...hence 2 stars.Also those cute wine glasses are gone & are replaced with average bulky unappealing ones.,1,,
2,Sarah B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",198,134,290,5.0,10/14/2017,"My most recent hidden gem on the UWS, this was a fantastic find for date night: charming, cozy, and welcoming.  Everyone we encountered was very helpful and attentive, making us feel pampered and welcome. We ordered the tzatziki & pita to start: SO good (and they brought out more pita because we were polishing it off). The bread tastes like it was baked over a fire, I'm in love.I ordered the grilled octopus appetizer as an entree and it was surprising large. Great grilled flavor and perfect texture, surrounded by vegetables.My boyfriend ordered the Branzino, which came with crispy Brussel sprouts and a squash purée- everything was cooked perfectly and delicious.We split dessert because you get a free one with a yelp check-in (!!!) and went with the tart of the day, which was peach & topped with vanilla rum ice cream & caramel drizzle - best dessert I've had in ages.",1,,
3,Kelly G.,"West Seneca, NY",131,75,115,4.0,2/23/2018,"Sat at the bar for dinner. Bartender was very helpful. Limited menu, no daily specials, but nice choices. Started with the tuna appetizer, which was tasty, but a little too much Olive for my taste. Had the seafood paella, which came with an abundance of seafood and rice and was so hot, I had to wait a bit to eat it. It was delicious, and was super happy with my choice. Small place, but it is NYC, so not terrible. Great people, nice atmosphere, I'd return!",3,1,1
4,Teresa L.,"New York, NY",255,403,259,5.0,6/9/2017,"I'm a big fan of Chef Michael Psilakis' restaurants. I frequent MP Taverna about once a month when I visit family in Astoria, and my sister-in-law just held her bridal shower at MP Taverna a few weeks ago, where even the food and service during a private event were excellent. Thus, I had high hopes for FishTag.SERVICE - Since our plans ended earlier than expected, we showed up about 30 minutes earlier than the set reservation time. The host said it was ""not a problem"" and seated us promptly. This great service continued throughout the night. Our appetizers came out within 10 minutes of ordering, and the entrees followed about 20 minutes afterwards. The manager also greeted each table to ensure that all patrons were content with their meals.DRINKS - I wasn't in a mood for a mood for a cocktail that night, so I opted for a glass of red wine. The heavy pour was very much noticed and appreciated. FOOD - I wasn't in a mood for a heavy entree, so I opted for the smoked octopus as my entree. It was served, in pieces, with a colorful medley of purple and yellow fingerling potatoes, slightly sautéed spinach, hearts of palm pieces, and a smear of an olive puree. It was delicious and paired wonderfully with my wine. My husband ordered the seared swordfish, cooked medium rare. This entree was served with two finger-long Greek sausages. My husband is not a fan of olives, so instead of the olive-laced bulger salad, he swapped this for a bed of crispy brussels sprouts.AMBIANCE - Although this is listed as a casual restaurant, patrons dressed in a jacket, shirt, and nice jeans/slacks. I wouldn't come rolling in sweats. The decor is sparse; there isn't a plethora of artwork or decorations adoring the walls. The walls are white, lit by metallic wall sconces over each table, and the tables are bare, unadorned by tablecloths. It was a perfect setting because the unpretentiousness allowed you to focus on the food itself.I'm a big fan of this restaurant, and will definitely be visiting again for future date nights.",,,2
5,Emi B.,"Manhattan, NY",157,359,1387,3.0,4/16/2017,"Came here for brunch, it was empty when we arrived around 1pm on a Saturday, two groups came a while later.Overall this place was not bad but also not amazing.I got the smoked trout hash as everyone said it's amazing, I thought it was not bad but a bit too salty. Thanks to the potatoes to tone it down.My friends got salmon omelette and eggs a la kosta which were not bad/not amazing as well.",1,,2

7,Angela C.,"Flushing, NY",9,76,84,3.0,4/5/2017,"Sunday brunch was surprisingly underpopulated as there was only one other group at 1P.We sat in the back which was fetchingly lit via skylight. Coat check was available and accommodating seeing as they took our bags even though theirs was a small closet space.Our server was great and talked through the menu when requested. He also helped me pick the shakshouka which I wasn't entirely impressed by. This was my first time eating it and all I can recall is the cutting acidity of the tomatoes to the point where my tongue was desensitized--until I tried my friend's bacon. Not only did it come 5m after the rest of her order was served (they did apologize for the delay, but why not hold everything back so it arrived at the same time instead?), it was so salty that she barely finished one strip before she finished her eggs and potatoes. When I tried it, my shriveling tongue underwent its death throes and I had to call quits. Final note is the chickpeas were firm like the texture of freshly reconstituted beans. I'll have to try more shakshouka to see how this holds, but my gut (and palate) tells me this was way off the mark.My other friend also ordered an egg plate which left her hungry. Portions are on the petite side, which is how I prefer it, but all big breakfasters are now warned.We used yelp to get a complimentary dessert to share and chose the passion fruit chocolate tart. It was good, but not memorable. Of the components, I liked the whipped cream and sauce best. If it was sold in a bakery, I wouldn't buy it.If only for the food, this would be a 2-star review, but it is a really lovely place to catch up with friends, and the staff were funny and nice.Silly me, should have come here for their seafood.",1,,1
8,Claire W.,"San Francisco, CA",535,207,1813,3.0,3/3/2017,"Really cute restaurant tucked away on the UWS with an intimate setting, great service, and good food.I had high expectations going in for their seafood, but unfortunately was not blown away. The Crudo of the Day was scallops, which was raw and paired habanero sauce that gave it a nice kick. It was surprisingly refreshing and not at all what I expected. The octopus was soft and tender, but the rest of the plate consisting of potatoes and spinach was just okay. The seafood paella was a soup-based paella. The rice and mussels were definitely the best part of the entree. The rest of the seafood was pretty forgettable. I would advice against getting the swordfish. Though it was cooked medium rare, it was extremely dry. The sausage and the grains were the better part of that entree. Mango sorbet was bomb, and the ice cream was pretty good too.It was a great dinner, but for the price, you can definitely get better seafood elsewhere in the city!",3,2,3
9,Ron W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,2.0,4/8/2018,"Sunday night dinner. Awful. Appetizer of Tuna Tartare was ok. Main course was spaghetti with clams. Surprise topping with Parmesan cheese. On clams? Really?Brownie desert was mediocre. Service was non-existent. Entrees came late and not together. Plates weren't cleared. Couldn't get anyone's attention. 5 blocks from home, but I won't go back.",1,,
10,Nicole B.,"New York, NY",19,101,10,3.0,1/7/2018,"Sunday brunch, pretty empty, only 3 other parties were there. Okay coolOur waitress was really nice, suggested we get the pre fix lunch (tea/coffee, brunch plate & drink for $22). I ordered the ricotta pancakes & my date had the lamb burger. The pancakes were good, I loved the crisp, crunchy crust. The syrup was amazing. The lamb burger was pretty good, I'm not much of a lamb fan but it was nicely seasoned and the cheese added was a little spicy, so it gave the lamb a little kick. Sat in the back, near the sky lighting - extremely cold but it also was only 15degrees outside. Overall this place is okay. Nothing grand but Nothing horrible. The staff makes it better. If you're in the area and hungry, go for it!! I will come back for another brunch date and for dinner. I'm not sure why brunch was so empty but no complaints from me, I didn't have to wait for a table LOL",1,,1
11,Crittendon N.,"New York, NY",178,17,36,5.0,3/14/2018,In love with this gem I found on the upper west side. Everything was great but the tuna is something to write home about .. when I first had it it was the special. Flavors are layered with a bit of spice that go perfectly with the cooling yogurt sauce . The ambiance is cozy and the staff is very friendly. Definitely will be returning!,,,
12,Meg H.,"New York, NY",88,115,6,5.0,8/27/2017,Follow these instructions carefully...Go for Brunch and order the Deluxe Brunch...Choose the Trout Hash and Ricotta Pancakes to share along with the Salmon Platter...Thank me later. Service and food A+++,1,,
13,Mitch L.,"New York, NY",1,11,0,3.0,6/4/2018,"Went in for dinner Saturday night. Air conditioning not working on a hot, humid night... the staff seemed annoyed by the problem but not empathetic to the guests (like we were experiencing their pain). The staff were all nice and friendly, but it wasn't perfect...Drinks took a very long time and were delivered with server's hands on the rim of the glass (ick!). Please don't hold the glass where my mouth is going to go. But overlooking that, the drinks were quite good. They were out of a bunch of things, which was disappointing. And the server didn't know what they were out of until after we had ordered - which is even more disappointing. What we were able to order was seriously delicious. I will give the place kudos for the flavors. But whoever is in charge of de-boning the fish didn't do a good job. And it's a fish restaurant. Found lots of bones in smoked fish appetizer and branzino main dish. Lots of bones. What we liked: octopus app, paella, Greek spoon salad, pasta with clams. This place gets 3 stars despite some missteps because the food is tasty and the staff seemed well-intentioned and a bit overwhelmed. Hope to have a better experience next time...",,,
14,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,3.0,3/5/2016,"What am I not getting, Michael Psilakis? About a year separated my visit to Kefi and my visit to FishTag, and while you're certainly consistent, it's not in a good way. While you didn't do anything ostensibly wrong, I can't say you did anything ostensibly right, either. And unfortunately, I had to pay for that. Literally. Pretty much the epitome of a three-star review.FishTag had been on my list for ages before I finally committed. I live close by, and Mediterranean food happens to be my favorite cuisine. So when I saw that Gilt City posted a deal that packaged two apps/two entrees/two drinks for two at Fishtag, it seemed ludicrous not to jump at it. Due to my experience at Kefi, I went in cautiously optimistic. Serious, serious emphasis on cautiously. The similarities with Kefi started almost immediately. We walked in, and a man who appeared to be the host wasn't acting very host-like at all. He ignored our awkward presence for a good five minutes (he seemed more aloof than mean-spirited, but still) until saying he'd be right with us...which meant more waiting. Thankfully, all aspects of the service after this point were positive. Just not a good first impression. Then came the drinks. I can't seem to find the cocktail menu online so I'll do my best to recall the various drink ""attempts"" we had over the course of the night. One was a whiskey-based drink with egg white and some other interesting things. Unfortunately, the ratios were completely off. I'm pretty sure there wasn't even alcohol in there. While the drinks did get progressively better from there, they were all pretty lackluster. That said, we were both well aware that FishTag is more known for wine/beer than cocktails. But given that it's an allegedly nice restaurant, we expected more. Of all the cocktails, I'd recommend the Spiced Manhattan. It's made with rye and cloves, among other things. The Alchemist was also okay, if you're more of a gin drinker.Now for the food. We were more enticed by the appetizers than the entrees (as I pretty much always am), so we went for three apps and one entree instead of two and two (obviously FishTag didn't mind this). There were a few highlights, but overall it was quite ""meh"":Royal Sea Bass Ceviche w/ plum sauce, cucumber, red onion, chives, yucca chips (C+)Though my dining companion thought differently, I really did not like this dish. I'm not sure if my taste buds did something funky beforehand, but regardless, this whole thing was off. It tasted straight up weird. Similar to the cocktails, I just thought it was quite unbalanced. There was this odd sourness that overpowered the whole dish and it just didn't do it for me.  Smoked Octopus w/ fingerling potatoes, hearts of palm, snow pea leaves, pumpkin seeds, date & green olive puree (B+)I've had some damn good octopus in my life, so my standards are quite high in this arena. I actually liked the octopus pretty well, though it was hard to tell with so little on the plate (in no world should that amount of food be $16. Just no). The garnishes seemed kind of arbitrary, but the octopus itself had nice flavor and the yummy crispy skin I like so much. Definitely one of the better choices of the night.Bacala (salted cod) & Skordalia Brandade ""Melt"" w/ kefaloteri, smoked eggplant, oven dried tomatoes (A-).You might need to finish and entire bottle of water while eating this dish. I love me some salted cod, so I wasn't at all surprise when I took to this baby immediately. But between the cod, the cheese, the skordalia and the eggplant, there was a lot of salt and overall flavor here. I wouldn't say it was ""off"" like the ceviche, but it's definitely powerful. Of everything we tried, this one was easily my favorite.Braised P.E.I. Mussels w/ spiced fennel & shellfish broth, garlic, chickpeas (B/B+)Again, this was NOT bad. The mussels were cooked well and had nice flavor to them--I've certainly had much worse. I struggle between B and B+ simply because this meal was underwhelming as a whole. B+ if it's relative to everything else we experienced here. But B in any other case. The chickpeas were unnecessary and I found their presence strange (weird to say about food, I know). Unless you fished around in the broth (no pun intended), you probably wouldn't know there were chickpeas to begin with. It's almost as if Psilakis said ""Hold on, this dish doesn't seem 'Mediterranean' enough for me. I know! I'll just thrown in some chickpeas. That'll do"". Anyway, the mussels themselves were decent and the broth was perfect dipping material. Just lose that extra s***. Overall, this meal was adequate. But it's not worth the money. I'm an indecisive person, but I can say that with complete certainty.",12,5,6
15,Evan P.,"Washington, DC",115,842,0,4.0,3/26/2017,"Great hidden gem on the Upper West Side with a very friendly, accommodating, and all-around wonderful staff. We were welcomed immediately and made to feel right at home. The staff was able to accommodate a few guests showing up late, and got brunch cocktails started right away. They have a great selection of cocktails and these cocktails are half price with brunch (or reduced if you have a large group getting a pitcher). The food was tasty and reasonably priced. The trout hash was delicious. The staff really distinguished Fishtag from other brunch spots and just made this an all-around enjoyable stop.",,,
16,Harry S.,"Leonia, NJ",0,4,1,5.0,5/6/2018,One of the best fish houses on the island of Manhattan. Great appetizers.. awesome service.. I have never left unsatisfied. The place is consistently putting out great food.,,,
17,Frank L.,"Jersey City, NJ",62,32,9,3.0,10/28/2017,"We had a party of 4 for 7:00 on Saturday and was quickly seated. Server was prompt and friendly.  Very good start. But that's when it all unraveled. After the prompt and attentive start, there was no service for 20-25 mins. No server come by to refill water or check the table. Manager eventually came and said that it will be another 5-10 mins for entree. Then it is another 10 mins of no service or attention. The food finally arrive and is fantastic. But the lack of service or even interim check in is unacceptable. If the service was at least average, this would have been a 4.5 rating.",,,
18,Rachel D.,"Norwalk, CT",0,23,0,4.0,4/7/2018,"Good date night option if you love seafood and smoked fish. We shared the kale and smoked trout salad appetizer and ceviche. Trout salad was tasty but mostly kale with barely a tablespoon of trout, so I'd order a smoked fish appetizer instead next time. Both apps were lightly seasoned to showcase the fresh tastes of the veggies and fish. The paella was delicious, with lots of mussels and 3 jumbo shrimp plus chunks of fish, and the saffron rice was delicious. Wine list has good options, and service was excellent. Would go back and try different things.",,,
19,Nicki P.,"San Francisco, CA",196,25,23,5.0,12/20/2017,Omg the red rub tuna.... and the branzino... and the salmon. You can't go wrong. They're also very conscientious about getting you to a show if you have tickets at the Beacon. Cozy. Great wait staff. Pricey but worth it.,2,,

Updated review","This is an update of a review written several months ago.  Three of us ate at FishTag this past Saturday.  The food was very good and the service outstanding.  However, towards the end of the evening, the host managed to destroy the experience.  With EVERY table in the restaurant unoccupied with the exception of ours and a quiet couple next to us, the host seated a young, exuberant quartet right behind us.  Any other seating choice would have provided them, and us, with a modicum of privacy and space.No longer able to hear our own conversation, we left; never to return.  Perhaps decisions like this are the reason the restaurant was deserted by 9:30PM on a Saturday night.  Perhaps not.  I'm content to leave it as a moot issue.",,,
21,tim w.,"Austin, TX",283,16,1,4.0,9/27/2017,"Food, cocktails, and ambience were excellent. Service was good and especially when my ignorance of ""crispy copra"" caused me to send back the paella to have the bacon removed. They re-prepared entirely.However, the place was too warm. A bit more ac, please!",,,
22,Julie K.,"San Francisco, CA",0,10,3,4.0,3/18/2018,"VERY closet to the Lucerne Hotel (where we were staying). We were able to get last minute reservations on a Sunday night, no problem. Food was great - Fish & Chips and Seafood Paella. It also came quickly which was nice. We might have ordered appetizers but too many of them had scallions or onions in them (and one of us has allergies). Service was good - though there weren't enough people (the bartender was also running back in to the restaurant to take orders!). If someone called in sick, no problem, but if they always staff this number, they really should consider adding one more wait staff. We probably would have ordered more beer or coffee had someone asked - and our additional orders, and those of other folks would more than pay for the other person. All that - we had a nice time and enjoyed the food. We'll try it again when we return to NYC.",,,
23,Stephen B.,"New York, NY",40,265,41,4.0,12/10/2016,"Some friends recommended Fish Tag so I thought I'd give it a go and met a friend there for dinner.  Very nice!The server at the bar, who also greeted us took care of our coats, was very nice and explained the beer and wines that the restaurant offers.  Very personal touch.  They also have very nice specialty cocktails.  I had a wonderful bourbon-base cocktail with honey and other stuff which I don't remember.  :) Tasted great.  We then sat at a table and ordered dinner.The shared starter was an order of Baba Ghanoush served with pitas.  This was very creamy and tasty.  Fabulous!  For entrees, we had an order of the Mussels and and order of the Paella.  Both of which were excellent.  Serving sizes were larger than expected, but not too large. I basically cleaned my plate.  :)Hope to go back soon.",,,

25,Ryan T.,"Manhattan, NY",11,75,95,4.0,10/17/2016,"Tucked away in a discrete below ground location, Fishtag is truly a lovely intimate little UWS gem. The atmosphere is impecable: loved the brownstone like feel and despite the upscale feel, the restaurant is lively and never feels stuffy. Our server was a little slow but nothing to complain about as she was otherwise great. The food was outstanding and, as we came with a party of 6, we got to sample a large portion of the menu. Recommendations include:Appetizers: charred octopus, catalán shrimp, gazpachoMains: whole fish of the day, sheepsmilk dumplings (best thing we had for sure), lamb burger (if you're not a seafood lover)",1,,
26,Anne J. F.,"New York, NY",1,34,4,3.0,6/15/2017,"this place has one of the most off putting entrances I've seen. It's down a flight of stairs into a windowless basement. I sat staring at a blank wall & broken furniture through a dirty below ground window,, wondering why on earth wouldn't the owner at least hang a mirror to reflect the inside of the restaurant (a great design feature for the diner who has to face a depressing wall). The rest of the walls were TOTALLY BLANK,,,not  a SINGLE piece of art. Weird! NYC is one of the art capitals of the world. The chopped salad was excellent, the branzino was very tasty, the fried fish was good & so was the sauce  but the chips were dried out,,, it was served with arugula instead of the frisée listed on the menu, Why doesn't the server just let you know??",,,
27,Catherine P.,"Morris Plains, NJ",0,23,16,4.0,10/16/2017,I very much enjoyed Fish Tag. The service was excellent and the cocktails were wonderful - a great list of house cocktails - creative and very good indeed! For appetizers we had the Tuna Tartare and the Gravlax. My husband liked his Gravlax and I thought the Tuna Tartare was perfection. It came on a bed of herbed ricotta cheese and was topped with crunchy garlic chips. The presentation was lovely and the mix of textures was excellent. We both had the Branzino which was very good indeed. As I had checked in in Yelp I got a free dessert and chose the fresh Baklava which was some of the best I've had. My husband did not like it as it wasn't very sweet - which was precisely why I loved it. They make their Baklava with dates and walnuts and the texture and flavor were excellent.,1,,
28,David H.,"New York, NY",4,14,30,1.0,2/27/2017,"Came for Sunday brunch and left feeling extremely disappointed, unhappy and completely ripped-off.  The place was relatively devoid of customers; should have taken this as a warning sign...Ordered steak and eggs for $25 and the steak delivered was literally two bites, probably less than 3oz.  Served in a half-size plate with a bunch of potatoes.  To add insult to injury, the steak tasted a bit funny, as if something was off, (and perhaps it was ultimately, a gift to not serve too much of it to a customer due to food safety concerns?)The waitress was pleasant and ambience was good but will not be returning to a restaurant that clearly isn't focussed on its customers.Never had such a poor brunch offering before after living and eating in NYC for almost twenty years.  Reminds me of that old Burger King as, ""where is the beef?""Would not recommend to anyone.  What a way to ruin a perfectly pleasant start to the day.",2,,

30,Bou L.,"Manhattan, NY",415,23,17,5.0,12/21/2017,"Came in for brunch a few Saturdays ago. We originally wanted to go to a nearby place, but the wait was over an hour. We saw this place had good reviews, and thought we'd check it out.Like other reviewers mentioned, this place was basically empty for brunch. We were literally the third party in the entire restaurant. In fact when we called asking if there would be a wait, the employee who picked up laughed (we eventually found out he is a funny guy). Anyway, my friend and I don't understand why it was so empty. The food was not horrendous. In fact it was really really really good. Per other reviewers' suggestions we got the trout hash and some pancakes. The portions were large, and they even gave me a complementary mimosa (which likely happened because we were one of the only customers there...). Everything was decently priced to as it was on par with, if not cheaper that, the surrounding brunch places. So again, not sure why it was empty. Maybe the idea of a med restaurant for brunch sounds strange? To me it also did at first because I was craving good old fashioned eggs with toast. But this place had all of that with just a slight twist. I highly recommend!",,,
31,Teryl P.,"Alexandria, VA",0,7,0,5.0,12/18/2017,Wonderful atmosphere and even better food. I highly recommend the spoon Greek salad and the Paella...both were absolutely delicious.

I'm actually glad I found this spot because it was very casual and laidback, and great for the group of friends I came with. Some of my friends were visiting from out of state, so I had planned this lunch so everyone could get together and catch up :)Our waiter was very friendly and patient, explaining the menu to all of us and the drink and food options. I ended up getting the lamb burger, since the ricotta pancakes didn't have a stone fruit compote that I was interested in that day (it was plum, so meh haha). I ordered it to be cooked medium, and it was pretty good. Most of the time when I eat lamb, it has that kind of funky odor, and this time it did too, but at least it wasn't OVERPOWERING...the sauce on the burger was spicy and good! It came with a side of thick cut potato wedges which were really great! The rest of the table ordered the prix fixe, and my favorite drink from their bunch was The Bittersweet! It was just the right amount of sweetness and very enjoyable. Would definitely recommend this spot for brunch!",2,,1

They have a prix fixe option for brunch, which I ordered. For $20, you get coffee or tea + a brunch drink + any egg or brunch plate. I got coffee, The Bittersweet (pomegranate juice, pineapple juice, campari, and sparkling wine), and shakshouka poached eggs. I loved the drink! It was a nice change from my standard mimosa.The shakshouka was pretty good as well.

38,Cat L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",156,334,467,4.0,2/16/2015,"Fishtag is a delicious, affordable brunch option for those looking to get away from the popular (and crowded) spots. I came here on a Sunday afternoon around noon and the place was quiet and barely 1/2 full, and it remained that way during our entire meal. I absolutely loved my choice of trout hash but was not crazy about my friend's shashuska. I would want to try the smoked salmon dishes next time as well as the dinner menusMy only complaint that the portions were a little on the small side and that the brunch menu wasn't very big so there's not much you can do to supplement your meal. Still, I highly recommend stopping by here for brunch if you're looking for a quiet meal in the Upper West Side.",1,,

They were so understaffed that after sitting for 20 minutes with no one coming to the table we got up to leave. There was no manager on duty. I looked around and there were almost no waiters and lots of tables still waiting to order.If you want a relaxing environment with good service, I would never bother with this place.",,,

The salmon was cooked perfectly - medium rare. And the salad that accompanied it was delicious - light and crisp and very refreshing. The wine list is not particularly impressive here, though.",,,1
42,Leslie P.,"Lake Jackson, TX",2,41,5,5.0,7/13/2017,"Part of the neighborhood! I felt like a regular on my first visit. I might not have chosen this from the outside, and I watched a couple of potential patrons peek in, see an empty bar waiting area, and so miss out on the warm welcome that every visitor received.  The manager, Greg, spoke very knowledgeably about the food and its preparation, and steered me away from the hummus toward the Smoked Tuna, which he said would provide more taste bud excitement with its creamy dill sauce.  He was right, and then when he saw me avoiding the olives on the side of the appetizer (the Smoked Tuna was also accompanied by radishes, picked, and other delicious fun) he asked about my preferences and then ran down to the kitchen to have the chef omit the olives in the salad on which my grilled salmon was served.  Now that is personal service!  The crispy skin on the salmon contrasted beautifully with the succulent medium rare center, and it was a beautiful thick piece of fish which more than filled me up.  Finally, my place at the bar gave me a great view of how warmly each customer was treated as they came in and as they left. Many were regulars, but even first timers entered an area that channeled the old Cheers' theme song, ""Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name; and they're always glad you came!""",,,1

We made a res' for Sat but didn't need it... granted we went mad early for brunch, 12pm.Almost everything on the menu looked good but we finally settled on the prawns on bruschetta, a couple orders of the smoked trout hash, and we shared an order of the bourbon french toast.The prawns were super fresh and had a great texture, the smoked trout hash maintained the flavor of the fish, and the bourbon french toast was good (could have been more bourbony thought).The atmosphere is great for being able to enjoy the company of your friends and the staff are very nice. We were able to catch up with each other without having to strain to hear the person across the table.We mos def found a new brunch spot!",2,,

Updated review","Thank you, Mr. Psilakis, for your kind invitation  for a return visit to Fishtag.  We three thoroughly enjoyed our recent dinner.  All went well; we found the Catalan shrimp and ceviche and baba ganoush outstanding starters.  The branzino, baklava,and fruit tart did not disappoint, nor did the service.  The noise level, reflecting an energetic evening scene, is quite loud and for seniors, a bit off-putting.  Again, we appreciate your response to our earlier observations.",1,,

My husband loves the fish and chips because it's crispy.  We can't wait to come back and try other dishes.",1,,
47,Joy Y.,"New York, NY",255,802,1189,4.0,1/10/2015,"Finally got to try this restaurant. I had very low expectations of food due to other reviews but was pleasantly surprised. First off their menu online is outdated and the prices of dishes have risen by around $2 across the board. Guess I could have pulled a Harvard-Business-Professor on them.Ordered their gimlet to start with, which was a refreshing summer-y kind of drink but the bartender seriously needs to get better ice. It melted way too fast and 10 minutes in my drink tasted like watered down lime juice.I ordered the octopus ceviche appetizer special which comes with crispy pita. I thought the octopus was well cooked and loved the acid in the dish but the onions were quite pungent and overpowering. For my main I ordered the swordfish rare and it came out medium. The protein came atop of the notorious 1000-ingredient bulgur salad but I actually quite liked its flavor.",,1,

Clearly fish is the way to go in this establishment. Recommended!!,1,,
52,Shas S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,59,1,3.0,8/25/2016,"Very cute place with excellent food and service. We tried the trout hash and it was delicious. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because of their bacon. We ordered a side of bacon with our brunch and what we got was the most unappetizing looking thing ever--A big, thick blob of fat. It might be the new chic interpretation of bacon, but we wished we had been warned.",1,4,

54,Roy R.,"OZONE PARK, NY",54,62,60,5.0,2/13/2017,"I had a great overall experience here to be quite honest. The food was very good. I particularly liked the saganaki. It was the best I've ever had. It was savory with a hint of sweet from the honey and then came the crunch from the nuts. Although it would have made my cardiologist cringe, I could have easily eaten three saganakis back to back to back and not felt any kind of guilt about it. That's how good it was. The service was great too. It was evident that they were well trained and well versed on the menu. FishTag, in my opinion, is definitely a worthwhile stop.",,,
55,Neal N.,"Chatham, NJ",437,393,653,5.0,8/6/2015,"I'm basically giving this place a 5 based on the Smoked Octopus alone. It's smokey (of course) and super tender with just enough char. The Greeks seem to be masters of grilling octopus and squid, and this is no exception. It was heavenly. One of my favorite dishes of all time.With that out of the way, I came here during Restaurant Week. My date and I ended up with salmon tartare, smoked octopus, PEI Mussels, lamb burger, panna cotta and banana brulee. We had also opted for wine pairings - she went with red, I went with white. Personally, the wines didn't do much for me in terms of complementing their respective dishes.Salmon tartare was good, but nothing life changing. I guess it's hard to compete with smoked octopus.PEI Mussels were quite meaty. The chorizo and chickpeas added flavor and a little texture. Lamb burger was incredibly tasty. It was like biting into a big patty of gyro. I also appreciated the large potato wedges.Panna cotta was boring. It seriously needed a lot more flavor.Fermented banana brulee was excellent. Crunchy base. Lots of flavor. Overall, I'm definitely glad I tried this place for NYC Restaurant Week and would gladly come here again.",2,,1
56,Maly A.,"New York, NY",155,665,1212,3.0,7/24/2014,"Ambiance - OK, different layout, intimate.Service - very good, attentive & friendly. My friend and I came here on a Friday night as she had been wanting to try out the place for a while. We started with the  TUSCAN KALE AND SMOKED TROUT SALAD & CATALAN SHRIMP for our appetizers. Both were really good. For the main course I got the LAMB BURGER & my friend got the LOBSTER BUCATINI, both recommended by our server. We were unimpressed. The Lobster Bucatini was very bland, no flavor at all & I had asked for my burger cooked medium but it came closer to med-well/well done so it was dry. We did mention that to our sever and she was very concerned about it so the service was definitely attentive. We ordered the sundae to share.....our server brought us an extra dessert on-the-house since we didn't care much for our main courses. That was a nice touch of good customer service. Perhaps the place is better for a brunch spot? Might give it a try again for that. Overall, it was just OK, nothing spectacular or memorable.",1,,

We were seated right away, water glasses filled consistently and server took our order promptly and efficiently. After that, we waited an hour for our food, waitress came over to apologize and say our dishes were being plated, but the food did not come for another 10 minutes. I mentioned it was a long time to wait for food and her answer was ""I'm sorry, can I get you anything else?"" My answer was ""a round of drinks on the house"". No reply. However, within minutes a manager (I assume) came over and offered us a bottle of Cava or wine for the inconvenience. That's how a good restaurant is run, although I shouldn't have had to remind them. Also, they should do a better job of listing ingredients, my husband ordered the spaghetti and clams and it listed coppa crumbles. He had no idea it was bacon and does not eat bacon. It should be listed as bacon or coppa bacon crumbles at the least. It also had what he thought was crabmeat, but that was not listed in ingredients, he is allergic to shrimp so he has to be very careful. I had the salmon and it was very good.

Same quality as kefi keeping it greek influenced and with a lot a lot of flavor. The brandade melt is a must have appetizer. It's all about the bread, they have this amazing bakery evidently since every bread in the dishes is a star. This one, grilled, super moist and crunchy. It's a skordalia (garlic and potato dip) mixed with cod fish over this amazing bread with eggplant.Then the entrees, the trout hash is to die for. The smokey flavor makes all the difference with a perfectly fried egg in a skillet with potatoes. You can't ask for more.

Very small portion but smokey and juicy. 2. Smoked Sablefish- for anyone know about Sable, it's like Lox but better. Both are smoked fish but Sable is buttery and delicious. Only problem is that this was very small as well. 3. Coconut Dessert4. Atmosphere was nice- felt like I was in someones house having dinner. Cons: 1. Both entrees- the lobster bucatini and swordfish were mediocre. My lobster bucatini lacked flavor and I had to ask for parmesan cheese to make it better. Sigh.

Nice brunch prix fixe deal that comes with a drink -- of course, this is more and more the standard for NYC brunches these days (yay!). I had the smoked trout hash, which was pretty good but not that memorable. The patatas bravas though was quite disappointing, bland and under-cooked, and memorable for my inability to bring myself to finish this despite still being hungry from the small portions. It's okay if you live in the area and just want to have a low-key brunch, but I wouldn't trek to the UWS just to eat here again.",2,,
63,Alan L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,1,4.0,9/25/2016,"We had the babaganoush small bite with home baked pita which was very good. Also had simply brolled shrimp with micro greens and fresh cilantro (6) served with seasoned Greek yogurt smear. Well seasoned and presented but shrimp were a bit small although grilled perfectly, not too dry. For mains my wife had grilled branzino again perfectly cooked accompanied by Brussels sprouts which were delish. I had the lamb burger which was on the money. The smashed fries were great too. Greek cheesecake and coffee topped it all off. Best of all my wife said she was very happy and you know the old saying about the happy wife.

One of my plates was chipped.    I give one star for appearance.  The outside looks somewhat beaten down.  The inside was really average.  The walls were cracked and there was an attempt to paint over the blemishes of the place which were kind of obvious.  The price was quite expensive.  The appetizer I had was like $10, which was not worth it.",,,
69,Richard D.,"Manhattan, NY",8,11,0,3.0,7/22/2017,"Perhaps everything would have seemed better had the air-conditioning been better on this extremely hot evening. The manager, Michael, said he was putting us in a spot where the air-conditioning was working effectively. It was not. This may sound very picky, but again, it was an extremely hot and humid evening.The food was fine, some of it better than fine. The sheep's milk dumplings were delicious -- light, and the sauce, fortified with onions and sausage chunks, was terrific. It was served with nothing else. So we had to buy up to very good crisp brussels sprouts. Dumplings, however, at $25 for a smallish bowl seems a bit high. One of our friends had smoked octopus and smoked tuna (appetizers as entrees). They were good, undersalted. Our waiter (Willie) was helpful and hard-working. The manager stopped by, and he seemed genuinely interested in our enjoyment.This review, as I re-read it, seems a little crabby and unpleasant. I guess...well, here's the thing. I have been to MP Taverna in Astoria twice, and both times we found it wonderful. I recall the food as being less fussy. Perhaps it's my imagination, but I recall even dishes similar to the FishTag dishes being heartier.In any event, an okay evening, and we'll give it another try when we're on the UWS.",,,

The signature cocktails are not very good, they list a lot of flavors that they don't really deliver on, and the drink was pretty weak and small for the price. We got one of the smoked fish appetizers and it was literally 3 thin slivers of fish (for $15), but the fish was tasty. On the other hand, the entrees are very generously sized, I had the Branzino with brussels sprouts and squash puree. Very generous amount of fish, sprouts were good, a little greasy, squash puree was more of just a garnish and didn't really taste like squash, it actually just tasted like lemon, goes with fish I guess.

I asked, you came to a restaurant to have Fish and Chips? Hey whatever she wants, she gets. My Salmon was good, but not WoW, but her Fish and Chips was WOW, the cod was sweet and fried to perfection.

As we began to order, however, we were told that our selections weren't really the correct balance and that the kitchen would probably arrange in courses different than what we envisioned.

77,Adam T.,"Denver, CO",0,6,0,2.0,12/23/2017,"This is a below average fish restaurant.  I lived in NYC for 33 years and now come to visit.  While the staff was friendly and moderately attentive, most of the food was very dry and salty.  This is all about the food.  Overall the prices seemed fair and portions ok if the quality  had been better.  Sadly NYC is supporting this restaurant - a great food city - while my now city of nearly 15 years, Denver, would run them out of town within 12 months.  I'd rarely think this.  But places like this flop in much less culturally sophisticated food cities.  Appetizers: -sable was above average-pastrami salmon was good quality salmon with no flavor to the seasoning.  -salmon sushi stack was left over pieces of salmon and ""Fishy"". I think the fish was plenty fresh, just scrap parts and low quality.  Dinners -paella - they were nice enough to sub Clams for muscles.  Seemed like all fish wax good quality. However, Cod, shrimp and clams were bone dry. Rice had Almost no flavor other than salt.  This sounds horrible, but there is more saffron flavor coming out of a box mix and less salt than in this dish.   Yes, I've tried  box mix and also traveled through southern Spain for weeks. Box mix and southern Spain are extreme ends of the spectrum. This was rice with salt and dry fish. Not on the spectrum. -sea bass - again - dry as a bone. Crispy skin can be real nice on fish.  This tasted like the part of the fish we all try to avoid. It added a really bad flavor to the fish. The side dish was a boring and tasteless corn. Friends ordered -fish and chips. I think the reviewer who posted long john silvers flavor profile was being generous.  The breading was very thick, extremely greasy and the fish was not flaky at all.  It was somehow dry.  Fish and chips may not be the ultimate delicacy outside of a few rare places, but it shouldn't be this low quality. -Lamb burger - why do they add pork to such a fatty meat ?  The pork overwhelms it and you can barely tell it was lamb. Personally, I don't ultimately care about burgers but this was not good.  Sweets-apple tart seems to be made with baklava dough and is tasteless.  1/5 scoop ice cream covers this almost fruitless pastry.",,,

When we arrived at 1:30pm,  the restaurant was pretty empty; only three other tables were occupied. The host kindly offered to check my umbrella and coat, so I checked just my umbrella.The $18 prix fixe for a cocktail, coffee/tea, and entree looked like a great deal but I decided to just get an entree since I normally don't drink during lunch. I went with the Eggs a la Kosta, which was two poached eggs, wilted spinach, and guanciale served on two pieces of toasted bread. The eggs were poached unevenly - one's yolk was not runny at all in the middle, and the other's was only slightly runny. That aside, I enjoyed the rest of the dish. The spinach paired nicely with the saltier guanciale, and the lobster avgolemono sauce was thick and creamy. The dish also came with a side of potatoes that were delicious and seasoned very well.My friend went with the Baked Egg Skillet, which he thought was a little disappointing. He was expecting more tomato and chorizo in the flavor, but it was basically scrambled eggs in a skillet with pieces of tomato and chorizo mixed in.Our server was friendly and the service was generally good, though nothing special. Overall, Fishtag is a decent spot for a quick and inexpensive brunch with a few friends.",,,
85,Vanessa S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,27,2,2.0,6/9/2016,"It was somewhere between bad and fine.The ambience is wonderful. 5 stars. The service, maybe 4 stars - the waiter was not super attentive, but charming and delightful the times he did come by.But the food... the food was pretty bad, and all in all very forgettable. Each dish felt like it was trying to do something creative, and each time, that one element ruined the entire dish.The ceviche - tough, gigantic slabs of fluke, slapped down on some endive in order to deceive you into believing that you don't have to use your fork and knife to penetrate it. You do.The greek salad was sort of edible, but the warmth of the kale semi-cooked the other vegetables. Not enough to make them taste like something different or enjoyable; only enough to take away the crunch.The branzino was similarly disappointing. The fish was cooked well, but the head cheese really didn't go with it and completely overpowered a delicate fish with the saltiness.To cap it off, the presentation on all of these was unappetizing. I'm all for variety of hues and textures, but it looked like someone accidentally ate and then vomited a physical color wheel into each bowl that was put down.It was close between two and three stars because the food was OK and the service/ambience were nice, but it's quite pricey and therefore it's an easy two stars.",,,
86,Diana D.,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",2,3,2,5.0,2/20/2016,"Went here on a Friday for an early pre concert dinner as this is one of the many restaurants near the Beacon theater. Great selection of wines, beers, and cocktails on top of a delicious seafood/Mediterranean driven menu. We shared appetizers of smoked octopus (tender and tasty!) and the prawn bruschetta (so flavorful, definitely a fave!!)... Main course was the salmon with Greek salad. Very well prepared and salad complimented the salmon. One friend had the special of the night, white cod fish and chips, and wow the portion alone was beyond what was expected. Thankfully we made a reservation as the place filled up quickly shortly after opening hour. Bar area is kind of a modern rustic design with plenty of seating. Dining area is a bit small but still comfortable. Will definitely want to come back and try the rest of the menu!!",1,,

The foot was great, and portion sizes were decent.We had the smoked salmon appetizer to share at the start--about 4 pieces of salmon and 4 small-ish slices of bread, all of which were great. My brother had the trout hash, and I got the smoked salmon omelet (a new addition, I suspect). The hash didn't have a huge amount of fish but everything tasted great and ended up being very filling. The potatoes that come with the egg dishes were much better than the typical breakfast potatoes I was expecting; they were nice and crispy and not too oily.I definitely recommend this as a brunch spot!",,,

90,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,4.0,12/14/2015,"So many rave reviews about the trout hash...so I ordered it. My conclusion: it's alright, it didn't wow me, it was a rather small portion. It was a small piece of trout topped with a fried egg and way too much mustard, which overwhelmed the whole dish. I would recommend going for an omelette instead, especially if you're ravenously starving. Our large group enjoyed our Sunday morning brunch, though the service started out slow. We had to flag down our server to put in our order. The food arrived promptly, however, one of our friends had to wait extra to get her trout hash. That's always awkward when everyone at the table has their food, except for one person. Then you feel bad if you don't wait for them - do you eat or do you not eat and let your own food get cold? That is the question. Good manners says that you wait. My friends were very satisfied with their entrees - the lamb burger, the ricotta pancakes, the omelette and salad. Good coffee.A part of the Chef Michael Psilakas family of restaurants (think Kefi), Fishtag has a limited but well done menu, with some French influence. It wasn't terribly crowded on a late Sunday, which is good because the space is definitely cozy. Reasonably priced. This is a nice little brunch place, I'll have to come back and explore some of the other items on the menu.",1,,1

We were waiting until the right time to try it, and what better time than Restaurant Week? The menu was generously portioned--the appetizer choices included a bulgur salad, which I jumped on. And the entrees were great as well--I went with the salmon, and it was cooked perfectly. For dessert, I went with a blueberry item that was more like a muffin split in half? But it was still good. Our server was quick and just attentive enough without being a helicopter waitress. The decor is nice--it reminds me of a kitchen in a large country house. In the middle of the main seating area is a nice wooden table with a display of cheese. They all looked appetizing, and I look forward to our next visit.",,,

Granted it was char grilled but most of what he had were burnt. The waiter apologized and gave us a fresh batch but still burnt. For his part, our waiter did a good job.

The service from Josiah was concerned, complete, and informative. The food was more than good enough to hit the treat bar, and we plan to be back. Here's the deets (11/22/14):Prozena (wine), 38: We had a winner! Good value!Trout and kale salad, 12: The trout was terrific. This was a good combination.Catalan shrimp, with patatas bravas, 13: The whole dish was pleasant - the Staub serving dish, the potatoes, the harissa butter sauce with black sesame seeds - but the shrimps were disappointing. This is an item to skip on future visits.Branzino with head cheese, crispy Brussels sprouts, and squash puree, 26: An excellent dish, perfectly prepared and presented. The branzino was deboned, and rolled with the skin into a serving form. TOTAL: 96.90, with taxBONUS: The wine list is a friend of the people, according to the GF, and offers a variety of wines and serving options in glasses and half-bottles.TIP: Nice, large bar area for dining.TIP: Smaller dining room makes bookings nearly a must. A lot of the diners overheard arriving on a Saturday night had bookings.TIP: Very complete bar for spirits and beers. The menu provides more pairing information than I've seen anywhere before.",1,,1

Loved the round table in the middle. Service was nice, but definitely could be a tad bit improved - servers were informed but seemed not as knowledgeable as they could be. You just could tell.But food. wow. knocked it out of the ball park.1) kale salad - fresh, lightly tossed in dressing which wasn't too overwhelming. Smoked trout added a nice smoke touch and textural difference. 2) Sheep milk dumpling - this was nice. Sauce should have been a bit more seasoned because sheep's milk tend to be very bland, but the dumplings were extremely soft and fluffy. nice.3) Grilled branzino stuffed with head cheese - omg. wow. one of the best Mediterranean fish I've tasted to date. So tender and juicy with salty/meaty goodness from headcheese. oh man. would DEFINITELY order this again.The head chef always tweets a special word for some percent off the bill which is very nice and considerate.

Dinner was excellent - we had gravlaks (small portion, be aware), chopped salad (a cross between Israeli and Greek, very fresh with what I think were roasted peppers - made it smoky/sweet and went well with everything), striped bass special, and grilled shrimp appetizer.  Didn't have dessert but it looked great.

Eight raucous girls drinking up a storm for at least two hours at the adjacent table. Not much eating going on; their main courses arrived when we were paying our bill. Unbelievable decibel levels. Management needs to manage these situations more deftly. Sure that's tough but it can be done.2. Our food was generally fine -- but why the fuss over the ""bacala melt""?

105,Cassie W.,"New York, NY",143,37,24,2.0,7/29/2015,"I've been to this restaurant twice, both times for brunch. This place is hard to find, as it is below ground level, which is great because it is never crazy packed. Good food without the crowd. The prix fixe option is always a good deal, 20 bucks for a brunch entree, drink and coffee or tea.I gave this place a 2 star rating not because of the food but because of the service. Our waitress snapped at us multiple times. There was a mix up with our drink orders within our the pre fix orders ( coffee brunch drinks are not included) when my table asked why as they were the same price as the regular brunch drinks, the waitress clearly didn't know the answer and basically told us is just the way it is. We had a party of six, two of us got there early, when the waitress came she only brought 2 menus, when I asked for the other four she snapped and said that she would bring them when the rest of the party showed up...but ended up bringing them only a minute later.Overall I love the food at this place. I highly recommend the egg white omelette, its very fluffy and light. Unfortunately I was not able to enjoy my food due to the terrible service.

Toast was crunchy and provided a nice contrast with the fish texture. The green paste (peas I think?) was light and slightly creamy, which complemented the main ingredients;Octopus salad - nothing beats perfectly grilled octopus you know what I mean? After having this I became a fan;Kale salad - tossed with salmon, apple slices and onions, this dish was refreshing and summery.Entree:Grill salmon - having had salmon for appetizers, I wasn't quite sure if more salmon was going to impress me. This dish however exceeded my expectations. Medium rare with slightly charred, crispy skin. Drizzled with lemon juice, mmmm... Definitely one of the best salmon dish I've ever had;PEI mussels - shellfish broth with some garlic and spiced fennel. This one was simple yet still tasty. Soaked the bread with broth and it was fun time!Dessert:Panna cotta - what a great way to finish the meal. The whole thing was showered with coconut flakes. Impeccable.Service was excellent!

108,Nelson W.,"New York, NY",453,537,935,3.0,1/30/2012,"Fish Tag is a fair and competent neighborhood restaurant that services the UWS residents with an elegant dining experience.  With great service and an intimate atmosphere (if not a bit cold), it is a perfect dinner spot for couples and small groups for a night out.  Reservations in advance are highly recommended with only a modest number of tables.Upon first visit, the most memorable dishes include the lamb burger, smoked octopus with chorizo, and the off-menu short-rib appetizer which was simply amazing. The meat was so soft and tender it practically melts in your mouth.  The sauce was surprisingly light with the perfect amount of sodium.  The branzino stuffed with head cheese was a fail for my taste. Branzino should not taste so heavy.  The head cheese was creamy and drags down the texture to an otherwise a well-cooked fish.  Not a good combination.    The biggest disappointment belongs to the menu, which albeit considerate with recommended wine pairing, is too hectic for the common observer.  Appetizers and entrees sandwiched between each other, only to be distinguished by color, the menu is uncomfortable for the naked eye.  Though it does look aesthetically pleasing in photographs.In the end, the good moments are offset by the forgettable ones.  Fish Tag is a fun, reasonably-priced experience, but it is not worth going out of your way to try.  I am sure it succeeds to be more than just a neighborhood restaurant to a lot of patrons (especially given all the positive Yelp reviews), but not for this fish lover.",3,1,1

113,Michael B.,"Chicago, IL",212,602,2848,3.0,12/8/2013,"The New York restaurant scene, like everything else in that town, is insane, in your face and off the charts.  The food quality, cutting edge culinary innovation, global ethnic diversity, tradition, history and energy paired with knowlegable, demanding, diners make New York a town with high standards and little tolerance for other than the the best, in whatever cuisine, style and genre that may be.  New Yorkers don't settle, they select, and expect...!    From knowlng exactly what a ""regular coffee"" should taste like regardless if its from a street vendor, Korean deli or train terminal to the overwhelming selections of bagels, schmears and Asian noodles, New Yorkers have plenty of options for everything, and generally within a 2-3 block radius. That said, FishTag holds its own as a destination for those expecting a quality night out, at a reasonable cost in a charming, comfortable setting. Though the food did not trigger my ""wow"" reflex it did deliver on everything I was looking for in terms of balancing ambiance, comfort and sophistication for a quiet neighborhood restaurant.  (In fairness we were there on a Monday when a lot of chefs are off and it was still very good). Housed on the garden level of a townhouse in a residential neighborhood, Fishtag provides a  seafood retreat for neighborhood residents.  Hip selection of music compliments the ambiance but is not loud enough to distract from conversation.First the cocktails, large and strong.  The limited menu is mostly share plates with a limited number of entrees and a few delicious desserts.  The servers were all delightful, helpful and authentic.Nice place for a night out with friends.",2,1,2

My friend chose the wine pairing and I went with the beer pairing so our waiter came with our first course and gave a brief description of the booze. I actually ordered creamy soup and who would have thought it could make such a splendid combo with the beer from Alphabet City Beer Co.? My friend also couldn't stop praising the wine pairings throughout her meal so they really know how to accentuate their cuisine.Although it was a lot of beer for just dinner...

Skip the Sabrinas, the long lines, blah blah, and come instead to FISHTAG. Why?: you can make reservations! (o what, that exists?); not spend for $$$$$ for a ""special"" salmon benedict and get a Smoked Trout Hash instead; and sit among cozy European+modern decor?Let me preclude this by saying, I am not keen on fish. Esp. the way it is cooked in Western cuisine is so bland, i.e. just add salt. But FISHTAG is a whole 'nother story. The Brandade Melt (brandade is salted cod. yes we wiki-ed, but don't expect me to know how to pronounce it) was toast with an amazing cod spread and light veggies on top. The cod was salty but no overpowering and balanced out the appetizer. The Smoked Trout Hash but just a whole category of it's own. Egg on top of tender trout on a bed of sauteed veggies and great potatoes, it's a whole different take on the norm. The trout was seasoned and cooked perfectly - flaky and tender. It was salty enough but like the brandade, rounded out the dish instead of overpowering it. The potatoes and veggies had a slight spice to it and were seasoned well leading to an overall amazing, holistically flavored dish.O, and can I say healthy omega 3s as well?!",1,,

One of the best in NYC and not skimping on the portion. My only complains would be the lack of A/C - it felt stuffy with a large crowd on a Thursday night.

We ordered the deluxe for the table, which is the same as the prix fixe with an order of the smoked salmon. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't recommend it over the prix fixe--it's about one small-ish piece of salmon per person, which I didn't really find to be great value, although it did taste good. My entree was the short rib croque monsieur, which was a little different take on most breakfast sandwiches and was fairly tasty, although I must admit that I am partial to smoked gouda, which might affect my view. The rest of the prix fixe is decent value, and it's a nice place for small- to medium-sized groups with nice lighting with the open roof. I'd return to try more dishes or for non-brunch meals.",,,

The homemade greek sausage that they serve with it serves as a great counterpoint since it's vibrant and bursts with flavor. In order to get full here you'll have to order an app to at least share.

More recently, i tried MP Taverna in Irvington a week after it opened and was very impressed that the consistency and quality of the food that i found at Kefi was brought here to Westchester.However, Fishtag was a disappointment. I felt that the Octopus appetizer, which is usually solid at his other restaurants was not as memorable. The size of the octopus was smaller and it just didn't have the same smokey wow factor.My striped bass smelled a bit fishy when it arrived but the taste itself was good. Overall, i was just disappointed in the octopus since I hyped it up to my friends. The desserts were a bit too much too.On the brightside, I came here for my birthday, so at least I didn't spend any money here. Also, my friends didn't pay too much compared to a typical steak birthday dinner, so at least they didn't spend too much money on a subpar dinner. I'll stick with Kefi & MP Taverna.",2,2,1
124,Kristine C.,"Chicago, IL",51,189,16,4.0,12/8/2013,"We stopped in here for a quick snack after the holiday parade. The place was empty expect for one other person, that is probably to be expected. They have a nice craft beer menu and interesting eclectic brunch menu. We enjoyed the quiet atmosphere on the holiday, the service and food. We ordered off the brunch menu. Because we were saving room for a big turkey dinner later, we shared the brunch prix fix. It was perfect for sharing. I would have also ordered this on my own, it's a great deal! For our brunch drink we decided on the Bloody Mary with Dog FishHead IPA. It  was great and spicy and interesting and perfect. Then we shared the Smoked Trout Hash. Mmmmmmmm. It's a nice portion served in a hot skillet. There was enough salmon for every bite. I would have liked a bit more sauce to spread around the dish. I would go back to try more of the dinner dishes.",1,,
125,Courtney A.,"Manhattan, NY",2,41,0,5.0,4/21/2015,"There are so many great things to say about this spot.  The food is spectacular, and the folks that run this spot are just great, solid people.  I could write forever about the brandade bruschetta. Yum!I work at a school, and yesterday, we hosted an etiquette training session at FISHtag.  This Etiquette Luncheon was our second annual one that we have had at the restaurant.  This year, Billy, the manager, worked with me to ensure that the menu was exactly what we wanted -- something simple, yet new and exciting enough to be an experience for our students.Chef Michael's restaurants are all delicious - go to these places for the octopus and the bruschetta itself, WOW!  And, the prices aren't Domino's Pizza, let's be honest.  But, Billy (and the other manager, Gianni, in years past) was incredibly understanding of our need to make it an attainable price point for our students.  For food as fresh and fantastic as FISHtag, most other restaurants would have a chip of pretentiousness on their shoulders.  Not this place. This is a business done well--good food, good people.  Your taste buds deserve a trip, and you'll be giving business to a fantastic group!",2,,

The shrimp was my favorite but they were all good. So why only two stars? After getting our drinks in less than 2 minutes we waited close to 45 minutes to get our order of oysters and appetizers. Everything came out together and the hot items were cold. All of this without even an apology. There are definitely better places to dine at on the Upper West Side.",4,1,1

129,Uygar D.,"Manhattan, NY",11,75,92,4.0,8/12/2013,"The chef Michael Psilakis (from Kefi) experiments with new ideas in this cute little UWS space. We ordered 1. TUSCAN KALE AND SMOKED TROUT SALAD 2. GRILLED PRAWN, FETA & SPICY CHILIES BRUSCHETTA 3. GRILLED BRANZINO STUFFED WITH HEAD CHEESE. We shared all 3 dishes. The tastiness of the dishes is in the same order. The kale salad, as boring as it sounds, was out of this world. The smoked trout made it into heaven. The bruschetta was also nice, and the bronzino was below my expectations. But that's because my expectations were a bit too high, and this was still quite yummy.Please note that Head Cheese is not a type of cheese. Rather, it's  terrine or meat jelly made with flesh from the head of a calf or pig (sometimes a sheep or cow). So don't expect fish filled with cheese.I highly recommend dining at Fishtag.",1,1,1
130,Cici T.,"San Francisco, CA",282,455,409,4.0,5/12/2011,"Absolutely delightful! It's restaurants like Fish Tag that on retrospect reminds me of why I love trying new menus, discovering new niches, and exploring the concrete jungle.Fish Tag features fresh seafood, such as simply grilled fish with braised greens delicately plated, mussels in spicy tomato broth and basil, prawns with cumin and garlic, and sheep milk dumplings with jonah crab and sea urchin. The menu is refreshing with a fun but mature take on seafood fare that is to be enjoyed with a glass of white or red, such as an explosive or bold white, a light and fruity red, or anything in between.Portions are dainty, and therefore I would recommend an appetizer and entree for a person with a healthy appetite. And perhaps you may have room for dessert!The tilefish crudo appetizer, for a lack of a better way to describe it, was breathtaking! The mini pieces of raw fish were accompanied by muscat grapes, its sweetness thoroughly infused, as well as crushed almonds that lent each bite a tiny but noticeable crunch. Piquillo peppers and shishito aioli with olive oil and lemon juice brought the flavors together for something that was balanced but oh so moving.The smoked octopus appetizer was not the star of the night, but it was delicious nonetheless. Chewy in texture, the octopus was mixed with mushrooms of the same color and likewise gummy texture. The two, if not paying attention to the food, could be mistaken for each other. Thin slices of chorizo were placed atop the broccoli rabe, and to the side was a light puree (supposedly pomme puree) that was fluffy and slightly creamy.For entrees we had the grilled branzino stuffed with head cheese that came in a buttery broth and mushrooms confit. For those that don't know, head cheese is not a cheese, but rather is a terrine or meat jelly made from flesh as well as some organs and gelatin. The head cheese was surprisingly subtle, but carried throughout the meal a sustained and flavorful taste that worked well with the branzino.Lastly, the grilled striped bass was simply prepared with EV olive oil and lemon juice. Even so, the skin came out to a perfect crisp and the flesh was well seasoned. The braised greens were not wilty, but robust in flavor and with a vibrant dark green color (fresh!), such that when paired with the bass, brought out the flavors of the fish.The white wine we chose was light and delicate. Unfortunately there was no room to spare for dessert.The atmosphere at Fish Tag is clean with dark accents of wood that gives a homey and yet luxurious feel. It's a relaxing atmosphere, a great place to unwind after a hard day's work, and has a staff of fairly young men that give the restaurant a more upbeat feel. I would give Fish Tag 5 stars, except that my companion felt that one of the servers was a bit too sarcastic for his taste. Otherwise, Fish Tag is 5 stars in my book!",5,4,5

132,Jeff O.,"Manhattan, NY",266,278,671,3.0,6/30/2013,"3.5*Prices are nice for the quality you're getting, and I especially like that the beer and wine menu is carefully thought out. The food is good but not great, mainly because there tends to be too much going on.Scallop ceviche, for example, offers delightful wafers of supple seafood, but is overwhelmed by mango and citrus that have a cloying effect. The shrimp bruschetta, again, features lovely shellfish but the bounty of accompanying veggies kind of hits you over the head instead of tickling your fancy - the components all become one big flavor. The smoked octopus is more successful - big, meaty, tender tentacles are surrounded only by sauteed greens and potatoes, letting the oceany flavor shine.Like I said, prices are fair - had that food, a nice saison beer and a cool glass of yeasty prosecco for $59 plus tip.",1,1,2

The menu is designed in a way that makes wine pairings for every dish apparent. Our serve helped us refine our choices so that we each got the perfect glass of wine with every course. We started with the cheese and adored the stinky cheese! Everything we had was absolutely delectable. Our serve Josh was so helpful! When you are dropping $200 on dinner it's nice to have someone willing to explain each dish and help you make the right decision.

I don't know a lot about wine and what style of wine goes best with the meal, so it was a very impressed with the layout of the menu.

140,Stephen S.,"New York, NY",33,42,0,4.0,1/16/2016,"Went here on a whim for Saturday brunch, as I didn't want to fight the usual crowds at Jacob's Pickles and GETE. Arrived a few minutes before noon, and waited at the bar until they opened for brunch at 12pm. We waited with a few other couples, but otherwise the place was uncrowded. Friendly host seated us in the back dining room, which has several skylights, and our service continued to be good throughout the meal. We opted for the $20 pre fixe, which included coffee, tea, one brunch drink, and an entree. I got the smoked trout hash, and my husband got the ricotta pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs. My has was great, with fillets of salty, crispy trout over vegetables and potatoes. The vegetables seemed to be flash cooked, and potatoes were crispy, and there seemed to be a bit of a buttery broth in the bottom of the dish. This was all topped of with two poached eggs and a whole-grain mustard hollandaise-ish sauce. This all came together into a great dish. My husband had the ricotta pancakes, which were large, thick and delicious, topped with maple syrup and sliced strawberries. Scrambled eggs were great, and dark yellow, like they were made from some happy, battery-cage free chickens. Husband's bellini was par for the course, and I had the chipotle bloody mary which was great. If we go back, and have the same experience, Fishtag gets 5 stars...however this first visit was great and we will definitely be back.",1,,

142,Ilana E.,"Gloucester, MA",0,4,0,1.0,9/10/2016,"Tonight I notified our server that I have a gluten allergy before ordering. When my entree came i again asked if the dish was gluten free because it had crispy shallots which appeared to be coated in flour. I literally asked 3 times and, after I stupidly ate a few bites, she came back to tell me it did have flour in it. I now have a rash on my face. While the manager came over to apologize, only a few drinks were taken off the menu and we were still charged for my entree. I am beyond angry about their lack of respect for a food allergy and the lack of compensation for their error. Needless to say I will not be going back to Fishtag, which I am disappointed about since it used to be my go-to date night restaurant on the UWS.",,,
143,David N.,"Brooklyn, NY",123,589,852,4.0,12/10/2012,"I saw this looking for a dinner place before our show at the Beacon. We wanted something light before dinner and bit more classier than the rush of diner before a show. FishTag fit the bill and the menu look great.The restaurant has an unassuming façade on the lower part a townhouse. I think if I wasn't looking for it I might have walked right on by. The interior is a cozy interior with white wood paneling reminiscent a dining room. The service was great with an attentive server but she didn't hover over us. Water was filled promptly. The food also came out rather quick. Our appetizers of smoked octopus was delicious with the greens. The Ceviche was tart well balanced dish. I only wish there was a bit more. Our main entrees of swordfish and the crab dumplings was cooked just right. The dumplings where 'pillowy' and the sauce while it looked heavy was the opposite. The downer of the meal for us was the desert. The apple baklava was more like an apple pie. The coffee mousse wasn't a favorite.FishTag, even with the slightly hidden restaurant has seem to be found the people as the room quickly filled up as the prime dinner time arrived. I can see why. Good service. Excellent food that is on par with the pricing. I'd just skip the desert next time though.",1,,1

From the pictures it looked like a clean modern design with a nautical inspired theme that served up fresh seafood. In reality it is a run-down tiny restaurant in the basement of a brownstone. From the reviews, I was hoping at least the food would live up to expectations, sadly, no. The smoked salmon and spinach omelette was something I could have whipped up in my own kitchen for a fraction of the cost and with much better taste.

We went for a simple drink and it was the most uncomfortable experience!I walked in at 9:45, not realizing they closed at 10. The bartender offered us seats and menus without mentioning the 10PM closing time at all. His laptop was on the bar with papers scattered everywhere and he was disgruntled that it was not working properly. I scanned through the cocktail list and inquired: ""Can you recommend a cocktail for someone who doesn't like something too sweet?"" He responded: ""None of them are that sweet so get whatever."" Normally when I ask this question a bartender will offer recommendations, or describe some of the cocktail options. This bartender instead seemed impatient and annoyed. I opted instead for a glass of wine. I felt rushed and in the way, as the bartender then loudly made 3 cocktails right in front of me--slamming down the shakers on the counter right by my wine, despite the rest of the bar being vacant. He then was very rude to one of the waitresses--scolding her for placing one of the cocktails on a serving tray because it was not yet garnished.All in all, a terrible tension-filled atmosphere and an unhappy impatient bartender made for a very unpleasant nightcap.",4,,

Highly recommend and would definitely return here.Atmosphere:* The restaurant has a cozy and upscale atmosphere on first floor/basement of a brownstone. It would be well suited for a date, special celebration or more casual dinner at the bar. we were there on a Friday night and was a lively atmosphere and not too loud for a small spaceFood:* Varied and refined fish heavy menu, as would be expected from name of restaurant, with some Greek influences* We tried:- Kale and Trout salad was an interesting and nontraditional combination of flavors but would recommend; good portion size- Salmon Tartare was delicious and fresh; would have liked a bit more spice (pepper, jalapeno, etc) but that is a personal preference. only wish they used a different type plate rather than such a long dish- Grilled Branzino was spectacular and one of the best fish entrees tasted in years. Perfectly grilled and Brussels Sprouts and squash puree a solid accompaniment- Fish and Chips was hearty and flavorful. Loved the pickled onions but not a fan of the shoestring potatoes (small amount of bland potato sticks). Very large portion- Chocolate Passion Fruit tart was interesting and somewhat unexpected with the tart passion fruit cream balancing well with the chocolate. May have been a little on the hard/dry side and not overly sweet. Enjoyed it but would try something else next timeOther:* Fantastic service; attentive and helpful waiter* Inventive cocktails and fairly large wine list",,,1

First, I really have to say I really appreciate the concept of their menu, but as a person slightly OCD, I was not a fan of the overall view of the menu.  Their one sided menu list their dished from light to heavy while pairing sections with different drinks.  This certainly helped my friend decide what kind of drink she wanted while having the appetizer and then with the entree. The service was okay.  The server that actually took our order was nice and made plenty of recommendations, however the one that followed up with us through out the dinner seemed to always be in a rush and it was difficult to get his attention. For appetizers, we had:Smoked Salmon - as per our server's recommendation, it was truly buttery and melts in your mouth. Smoked Octopus - it was okay, i've had betterScallop Ceviche - I liked the fact this the scalloped was thinly sliced, I've had some where they just cube or leave the scollop whole. For our entrees, we had:Grilled Branzino - This was the first time I tried this, and I was surprised.. probably my favorite dish of the night. Lamb Dumplings - I was slightly disappointed, I read the yelp reviews and it seemed to be a favorite. However this is was also on the restaurant week menu, and the dish came out looking a lot smaller than what I've seen on the yelp review.

154,Anna Y.,"Oakland, CA",80,39,3,4.0,4/20/2014,"Pssssttt, did you hear? There's this great brunch place in the UWS with little wait that makes the best pancakes I think I've ever had. I know, insane, right? I'm letting you in on it but let's keep it our little secret. I say this because I almost don't want word to get out on this amazing place. Had reservations for 1pm Easter sunday brunch but it wasn't full when my party walked in, probably could have done without.  The overall menu was reasonably priced, with $11 to 16 entree options and a $20 combo that included entree and drink + coffee. We ordered the ricotta pancakes ($11) and the salmon plate ($16). The ricotta pancakes, as I told my friends, were ""So good, so good I want to suck face with it."" More ricotta than dough on the inside, the ricotta barely oozed out of the pancake when you cut in and it was just the right amount of crispy and gooey. It was also so sweet I barely needed to use the fruit compote or the honey syrup that came on the side. I take one star off for the salmon plate, while presentation was beautiful, I did think that $16 was a lot to charge for a glorified lox sandwich that was more bagel and a lot less lox. Overall great place and I will certainly be trekking out again soon to reunite with my pancake love.",2,1,1

Came here on a Friday night after getting a recommendation from a friend and totally drooling over the menu.  The interior is great, a little trendy but cozy.  Staff at the front was pleasant. For our dinner we had the kale salad, shrimp and feta bruschetta, the branzino with head cheese and swordfish. I liked my Branzino dish because it was so different than your normal fish. The brussel sprouts on the side melted in my mouth.  The skin, however, on the fish was a bit on the chewy side which I never have experienced before. I also enjoyed the shrimp app. Good taste all around, can't complain.  The other 2 dishes we were not crazy about. The kale was far too tough to be put in a salad and extremely under-dressed. I think it has potential but what we had was not great.  My boyfriend had the swordfish which was underwhelming in flavor.  Not something he was used to in Kefi/MP.  Overall the service was only fair. It took a really long time for our dishes to come out and our server never asked us how we were doing or how our meal was.  I don't think I'm making it back to this restaurant.",3,,

The menu consisted of brunch items and not lunch items. I had the brandade melt for appetizer. It's some sort of a cheese topped over bread. I thought it was ok and quite fulfilling. For entrée, I had the eggs a la kosta, which is 2 poached eggs with spinach and home fries. This dish was also ok. And dessert was nothing special, just ice cream and sorbet. The restaurant's atmosphere is very casual.",1,,

164,Sasha G.,"New York, NY",600,553,333,2.0,1/28/2012,"Occasion: ""Let's catch up!"" date with my old college roommate. Reason: It's NYC restaurant week! (one of many apparently)Why else?: We both love seafood! I made a reservation. 9:15PM but we arrived at 9:35PM. I'm always late to places (terrible habit, I know) but I called beforehand and the hostess said it would be just fine. We were seated. Greeted by a waiter and we were handed about 10 menus. No lie, what the...? I was intimidated by the number of the menus. Like, where the heck do I start?? Luckily, we KNEW we wanted to order from the designated restaurant week menu. FOOD: 1st course: We BOTH had the smoked tuna app. BLAH. Bland, boring, UN-spectacular. We described it as a less harsh-tasting lox. It was unmemorable and I do not recommend it. It was served with plain slices of radish (what I assume was for pure decor because did not enhance or compliment the tuna) and slices of bread that was too damn charred. Eh. 2nd course: We BOTH had the scallop ceviche. Once again, NOTHING special about this ceviche. It was in dire need of some flavor, some SALT. I don't know... I was like MEH the entire time I ate it. Well really, it could be eaten in 5 bites tops. I did find the pieces of grapefruit to be an interesting selection but not great. The thinly sliced cucumbers just didn't rub me the right way. Cucumbers in my ceviche? Reminded me of pickles and I am NOT a pickle lover. 3rd course (main course): I had the SALMON. It consisted of a seared filet of salmon served with A LOT of Greek salad. The plate was in desperate need of a carb-- like some potato or couscous or something! There was just TOO much salad on this plate that was the size of half the table. Seriously.... HUGE plate. I did think the plating was aesthetically pleasing but taste trumps all. You give me ugly ass food that tastes AMAZING, I'm okay. But this was the opposite of that-- the salmon was in desperate need of a crack of sea salt and black peppercorn. It would have made it SO much better. The Greek salad (tomatoes, onions, feta, olives, oregano but NO lettuce) was good but not special in ANY way. My favorite part? The salmon skin....... it was crispy and I ate it rapidly. OH HOW COULD I FORGET?! The damned plum vinagrette that I didn't know was plum vinagrette because I don't read menus closely enough but had to ask the waiter because it was disgusting. EHHH. Plum vinagrette nightmares. My friend had the pasta option. It was gross. Bland too. Sucked. Dessert: There's only 1 option. Date/Almond Baklava with a scoop of almond ice cream. The baklava was not great at all-- way too chewy (as if it were sitting for more than a day) and tasted TOO much like cinnamon. I've had better baklava at my local falafel joint. The ice cream was good but who messes up ice cream? well, only if you over-churn it. The i/c was good but the almond was overwhelming. The service was okay. The wine pairing was also okay-- the first course sake made me want to barf. The end.",2,,

166,Esther L.,"Philadelphia, PA",482,264,138,3.0,2/12/2014,"We expected more from FISHTAG on February 7, which is why we chose it for a birthday dinner after reading the reviews.The octopus that everyone raves about was tender but stringy. I would not get it again; it was so dissatisfying that we ordered octopus for dinner last night again within the week at a different restaurant, Amali, where the tentacles finally scratched my itch.We got two orders of octopus for the table, with high expectations based on the Yelp feedback. A whole tentacle arrived which I guess is novel for some people but made sharing the appetizer difficult. Sadly my favorite part of the smoked octopus appetizer was was the heart of palm salad it sat on. We also got ceviche, prawns, smoked octopus, grilled scrapple stuffed branzino, swordfish, tilefish, braised mussels with fennels and chickpeas, lobster pasta... Nothing was truly standout except the branzino with head cheese.Disliked having to ask for bread while we were waiting and waiting for our appetizers. When we did, some toasty bread arrived pre-drizzled with olive oil. Fine.Entree portions were small. Two of the desserts we were eyeing had run out for the night. We were going to order cheese and charcuterie but after waiting 20 minutes for our server to take our order we just asked for the check instead. Came out to about $55 per person.3.5 stars: the food and service were mostly just ... fine. Bonus points for good drinks though. The cocktails were very good; had the Winter's Gimlet and Thyme Goes By. The wine list was decent however the menu said nothing about the longer 6oz. pour; the cost and amount caught us by surprise. Both were subtle and well balanced almost reminiscent of haute Japanese mixology. The typeface on the menu was difficult to read. We liked the foam padding around the room which helped with the acoustics.The one novelty we really appreciated about this place was the organization of the menu, which was color coded red or black according to portion size (small vs. large plate), and the dishes were ordered from top to bottom by lightest to heaviest. The heaviest according to this list were a pasta dish the lamb burger.Maybe we'll try this place for weekend brunch.For similar Mediterraneish cuisine with better food, service, and portions, I highly recommend Amali in midtown instead.",1,1,

I had a beer from Queens (a lager) which was refreshing and tasty. They have a smaller selection of beers, a much larger selection of wine and cocktails. My friend got a drink called the Alchemist which tasted of citrus with a hint of ginger. Yum!  As for dinner I had the lamb burger with smushed fries and whipped feta. It was very good and filling. The burger was so big it became a bit of a mess but every bite was eaten. My friends had the roasted salmon which looked delicious and they were quite pleased with it.

Plus three selections of cheese and two main dishes. I highly recommend the smoked octopus and kale salad with nuts and trout. The fig ice cream was very good too. The Greek coffee ice cream was pretty nice as well.The service was quite knowledgable and friendly. Our waiter made excellent suggestion for my taste of wine and cheese.

We tried the Greek salad and saganaki, which was good but not great. I'm partial to traditional versions of these dishes. These were more creative rather than Greek styled.

174,Marina G.,"Glendale, CA",9,128,0,1.0,8/3/2015,"What a poop show of an experience. The best part of the meal is the wine, bruchetta, and ethan ( the waiter).  Our waiter, Ethan, was amazing. He was so accommodating and so kind. He deserves a raise. He is such an asset to Fishtag. The wine we purchased was the Pinot Grigio. We liked it so much we got two bottles. The ambiance is cute and friendly. it is chic with a modern twist. It was very nice. The food: Shrimp bruchetta: this was delcious. Worthwhile and worth getting. Unique flavors that mesh together. Not that I would ever come here again, but if I were to I would order the bruchetta. Ceviche: good and decent. Not worth the cost, but not bad. Branzino: both grilled and with the cheese. The cheese branzino was better than the grilled one. Nonetheless, both were dry and unimpressive. Mussels: DISGUSTING. It smelled and tasted terrible. Not fresh or properly cleaned at all. Public Health should come to check out the mussels and how the mussels are handled. I am sure it wouldnt be approved by the public health department. Every time I think of this I get sick. Waste of money. Talapia: The quinoa was decent. Fish was dry. Banana brule: Good solid dessert, but apparently they only serve this for restaurant week. Panna Cotta: Another complete miss. Lavender was too strong. I wouldn't ever pay for this. What a waste of money. Icecream: Caramel, Dark Chocolate, and Bananna. All three were good with strong flavors. Not worth raving about. Nothing special. Total Cost for 6 people: $332. Overall this place is nothing special, and definitely not worth a money. I would NEVER come back nor recommend it. :(",,,2

One friend had the tomato soup with clams that, he said, redefined tomato soup itself. What I love most about this restaurant is the fact that its food is crave-worthy. Not just good. The space is small, but you don't feel like you're part of another table's conversation. They manage the table layout well. And, the new manager (unlike the previous guy) is responsive to his customers. When I FIRST ate there years ago, I asked if they might install a hook in the restroom. (I have yet to meet a woman who wants to put her purse on a coed bathroom floor.) Incredibly, the old management copped an attitude. A hook was never installed. The new manager, Brian, promised a hook by the time we book another reservation. Then he apologized and brought our table a bowl of sorbets on the house.

The Adler Clan chose the vertical smoked salmon sampler featuring a wide variety lox each delectable in their own right. Joining the table of appetizers were: saganaki, Greek salad, trout salad and baccala with eggplant. The entrees of grilled salmon and bronzino were equally tasty.

So the second time I spent $80 for my wife and I have a crab sandwich with salad and wine in a jelly jar.I like seafood, and I don't mind paying $100 or more for dinner, but I really need to get a lot more than a cafeteria style place with over cooked seafood..",3,2,1

Fishtag was a convenient location and had a good deal going for brunch cocktails (a fun variety of different mimosas and bloody marys- most noteworthy being the one with pickle juice and dill). Nice space, but nearly deserted on a Saturday. Our waitress, whom was very sweet, highly recommended the trout hash... which sadly came out as a very underwhelming fried egg on top of potatoes with little bits of fish.The winner of Saturday's brunch was our friend with the french toast- a brick sized piece of brioche and fruit compote.Everyone was satisfied by their food and the price was fair, but I don't think I would ever bother going back (for brunch at least) with the many other choices available in the area.",,,
189,Vanessa S.,"New York, NY",99,108,20,4.0,5/5/2013,"My brunch at Fish Tag was a great experience! The restaurant layout was open & spacious, and my group of four was seated immediately on a Saturday at 1pm (the place was half-full). This easy-going atmosphere is a vast difference from most brunch spots downtown where it's normal to fight for elbow room & sit out excruciating waits. Why do we New Yorkers like doing this again?Anyways, it would've been stupid to have not ordered off their brunch prix fixe. $18 for a french press coffee, a brunch cocktail, and an entree is a good deal considering that a cocktail alone is $8. There are different types of entrees to choose from (griddle, eggs, lunch), but each category is limited enough that you're not paralyzed by indecision. I went with the smoked trout hash, which fulfilled my usual brunch craving of eggs and potatoes without over-saturation in fat or oil.After our bellies were full and our minds dizzy from drinks, my friends and I happily floated down the street to the American Museum of Natural History to walk off our delicious meals.",2,1,2

194,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,3.0,1/20/2012,"It's easy to walk past Fish Tag given its odd location on W. 79th Street. And once inside the lay-out of the dining room leaves much to be desired. The front is a chic but low key bar that seems ideal for grabbing a drink with friends if you live in the neighborhood. Further back is the main dining room on a mezzanine level with a large table at the center, the purpose of which is a little confusing. Is it a display table or a functional serving counter? It's distracting to say the least and something that detracts from your dining experience. Fish Tag's fish centric menu reflects Chef Michael Psilakis' Mediterranean roots as well as his penchant for good drinking. Be warned, deciphering the menu card practically requires a legend box. It is color coded and includes suggested wine and beer pairings along the side margin. Then there's the separate menu for their selection of smoked and cured fish as well as cheese. The beverage menu is equally extensive and meticulously categorized according to region and flavor profile. Enlist the help of your waiter and making sense of it all may or may not get easier. One good thing about their beverage menu is that wines can be ordered from  1/2 glass servings making it easy to create your own wine pairings according to each dish you order. When you do finally decide on your food you'll find that Psilakis manages to serve up an array of dishes that maintains the integrity of the fish while pairing it with surprising ingredients and accompaniments. This means that you get fish that's fresh and not smothered or drowned in heavy sauce and you get to enjoy the fish for its inherent qualities. It's something that purists would argue can only be attained when fish is cooked with a minimalistic approach. But Psilakis does so by pairing a well-seasoned and perfectly grilled piece of salmon with a refreshing Greek salad, a grilled striped bass on a bed of squash puree, a seared fillet of swordfish along with sausages and other similarly unique combinations. Of the more substantially portioned plates, the grilled branzino stuffed with head cheese is particularly good. The interesting flavors work well together and the side of broccolini and oyster mushrooms add another layer of earthy flavor to the dish. So take your time in examining the menu and order with a welcoming palate.The service, unfortunately, could use a little refinement. There's certainly enough staff to attend to the room so it's unacceptable that place settings remain incomplete unless commented on by a guest, or for drink orders to be forgotten or orders confused. That said, the food is above average and certainly one of the better options in the Upper West Side. Whether or not the over all experience is worth a second visit will be up to each guest to decide.Report Card (out of 5 stars):Ambience: 3.5 starsService: 3 starsFood: 3.5 starsPrice: $9-$25 plates;  1/2 glass serving of wine from $5",,,

The trout hash and the ricotta pancakes were amazing; The shashuka was good, but not as unique or strongly flavored as the other two.The combo brunch option is a really great deal, and the prices overall are surprisingly low for a place that looks new and 'experimental' in cuisine.

We were seated at the same roomy circular banquette in the back; service was again friendly and engaging.We shared a couple of nice charcuterie plates as I sipped a glass of prosecco -- we asked for warm bread and got toasted Italian slices drizzled with green olive oil: appreciated. I started with the Tuscan kale and smoked trout salad -- fresh, good interplay of textures/flavors... delicious. For my main I had the tilefish special, perfectly grilled with super-crispy skin over mashed veg and sauteed spinach: really good.One companion had the lamb burger, grilled rare -- I tasted and it was terrific.Glad to see Fishtag is still a worthwhile stop in this part of the UWS.",,,
199,David B.,"Lowell, MA",96,45,5,4.0,3/23/2014,"If I lived in NYC, this would become a regular spot. We realized somewhat late in the day on a Saturday that we had failed to make dinner reservations. There was nothing available online so we tried calling the restaurant. It took a bit of rearranging times but they were able to squeeze us in. They were very accommodating. The waiter was well versed on the menu. We started with an assortment of meats, cheeses and smoked sable. All were good but the standout for me at least was the LARDO. If you have never had the opportunity, this is the place to experience it. For the main course, my two dining companions got the sheep milk dumplings which were superb. I tried the Bronzino with head cheese.  The fish was cooked well but I personally probably would not order it again. The pork/fish combo sounded better than it tasted. The beer/wine selection is great. There were many different options for everyone at the table.",,,
