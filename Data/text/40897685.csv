Was disappointed in the steak in the steak salad, meat was super fatty. However, salmon sandwich with fries was outstanding! PS. Fries were amazing!7/10 will go back.",,,
1,Sam K.,"Atlanta, GA",9,86,246,2.0,10/12/2018,"Wasn't my first choice and went there after failing to locate the place we wanted to go to. It's right in the heart of time square. It was warm inside the restaurant which I liked. Had breakfast here. The food was just okay. Would have given higher stars if the food tasted better. Initially ordered an omelet which was too oily for my liking and it came with a side of potatoes. My boyfriend ended up eating that so I could order something else. I then ordered French toast which came with fruit. The French toast was more on the soggy side and could still taste a bit of the eggs which tasted not all the way cooked. The fruit didn't taste fresh. I have had better breakfast elsewhere and for better prices but then again, the location you are in prices throughout that area will more than likely be slightly inflated than if you were to venture out a little further. I also saw a couple of fruit flies. Not the worst place but not a place I would personally voluntarily go to again.",1,,

Not only that, they were empty half the time. We finally ordered our food and thought, well this won't take too long... WE WERE SO WRONG! It had to be at least another 30-45 minutes and that's not even the worst part. Right when we got our food, we were asked to MOVE TABLES!!! So to sum it all up we waited for at least an hour total and once we got what we ordered we were asked to move. We will not be returning to this so called restaurant.

19,Zina H.,"Terrytown, LA",75,2,1,1.0,9/20/2018,"Waitress gave me a mean face and called me a bitch after walking away from my table.  She was mad because I complained about all the bugs flying around inside there including on your food and into your food.  I had a salad and I had only taken about three forks full. The salmon filet on my salad was overcooked, and I was not asked how I want it cooked.  The manager did not believe me when I told him the waitress called  me a bitch.  Since I had eaten very very little of the salad I said that I did not want to pay for it because I was not satisfied with it including the bugs that had gotten on it. This the why the waitress was mad.  She accused me of eating more than half of the food already and that was absolutely not true.  She further stated that there's nothing she can do about the bugs even if they did fly on my food.  She said she was going to talk with her manager but she doubt if there's anything he will do about me not paying for the food.  Lo and behold the manager was reluctant and he did not believe that she called me a bitch.   However there was another waitress who had helped us the night before because this was our second time visiting there. That waitress attested to the fact that we were very nice people and we tipped her.  All in all I was called a bitch and a liar.  The place is filled with bugs and most of the staff and management are not friendly people. It appears all  their salads are pre made in bulk and everything is already mixed together.  The kitchen it totally out of view thus you cannot see what goes on in there.  I was leary about that because the place does not seem clean; the bathroom was nasty. Please don't eat here. I wish I could give them a zero and not a one. Thank you",,,

Had we seen them, we would have passed on by2 veggie burgers were the order. Supposed to come with a spicy coleslaw & guacamole, we were pleased to see a homemade patty. Lots of peas & corn in the patty which provided a unique but unfortunately bland burger - the coleslaw was not spicy & there was not a lot of pepper jack to add flavor But to give credit where credit is due, the burger was pristine in the sense there was no crossover hamburger grease from the grill. So props to you!So while this wasn't the best burger we've ever had, it was also not the worst. So A-OK about sums up our impromptu dinner.  We were thankful for the open tables & place to rest our weary feet while we waited until the theater doors opened",8,3,7
23,AJ S.,"Rockville, MD",2521,207,1238,3.0,2/25/2016,"My friend and I came in here for breakfast one morning after walking around Times Square on our impromptu day trip to NY. The first floor was PACKED, but the hostess handed us two breakfast menus and instructed us to self seat at any table upstairs. I guess it was the tourist in me, but I really enjoyed having breakfast with a beautiful view of the busy city streets. However, the food is nothing to write home about.I had their corned beef hash & eggs. The corned beef portion was super skimpy and some of it was burnt. They placed mini pieces of toast on top of the corned beef, which ended up being soggy from the steam once it got to me. I guess the eggs made up for everything because it had the runny yolk that I like to sop up with my morning toast. It was just an average breakfast at best.If you don't want to walk around all over Times Square to find a decent breakfast option, then this place would suffice. Other than being a convenient breakfast stop, I wouldn't really go out of my way to dine here.Being so close to Times Square, you're obviously going to see inflated prices. I'm not sure if it's worth the lackluster service and average food, though... At least the natural lighting was on point.",16,11,14
24,Mike W.,"Ballston Spa, NY",1,5,0,1.0,10/22/2018,"Waitress takes our orders and doesnt write anything down (trying to impress us or something like anyone cares). Well she gets one of the orders wrong by bringing a vegetarian a turkey burger. Thats kind of a big mistake wouldnt you think? Instead of admitting it was wrong she brings it back into the kitchen like the runner made a mistake. The waitress five minutes later brings out the correct veggie burger meal...Except it's cold as if rushed. So we tell the nearest worker the foods cold and he brings it back. Meanwhile everyone else has their food and is halfway done with their meals. Finally the order is brought out. the food wasnt too bad, but really was nothing special. We get the check and theres the extra turkey burger instead of veggie burger. Now I know she screwed up in the beginning. The burger was swapped out for the correct price. had the burger been slashed out of the check (like any restaurant wanting someone's second chance) I might not be writing this review.

31,Dalmiro C.,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",454,247,2615,3.0,12/4/2015,"TSQ became my place of choice for both lunch and dinner while in Times Square area.It's not a cheap resto but neither expensive. You have to consider that you are blocks away from Times Square and your are basically paying FOR THE LOCATION. I can't emphasize this enough. There is a Mc Donalds 2 blocks away if you want a usd10 meal...I tried both the Chicken Club Sandwich and the Steak Frites and they were great. The steak was really tasty, wide enough with medium rare cooking. Being from Argentina it made me fell like being at home.Stella Artois Draft beer was my beverage of choice, served cold enough in a beer chalice.Waiting time for sitting was insignificant but my order did took a while, so take that consideration if you are in a hurry.The stuff was friendly and they figured accurately that I was a tourist, reminding me repeatedly that the 20% tip wasn't included.

The service was good, the view was good.However the food was seriously one of the worst I've had in New York! I had a Caprese and thought meh can't have a bad one so ok sure lets do it! I was wrong... The overall sandwich was so dry, bland and tasteless. Keep in mind that I am not a picky eater, I eat pretty much anything and don't go spice crazy. But it was so dry and tasteless with no sauce whatsoever. So for $16 you get some bread, arugula on the side (still no sauce), a few tomatoes and bland mozzarella.  Acceptable for $6, not for $16!!The only good thing were the fries but I mean it's hard to screw up fries!Hubby's burger was better but overall meh especially for $17.All and all, there's so many places in time square, so don't come here unless you want an overpriced meh experience where you regret even setting foot there.But your call :)",1,1,

37,Tom D.,"Peabody, MA",57,305,11,3.0,3/5/2016,"If I had checked yelp prior to deciding to eat here, I probably would have gone elsewhere, but alas, I was starving and not willing to walk around too long before settling on a place.  We happened to snag a parking space nearby (after hurriedly pulling our vehicle from the hotel garage and getting hit with another day's fee) and this was pretty much the first place we came across. We were seated promptly at a table by the window. Sounds lovely, but the sun was beating down so hard this February morning I was sweating throughout my meal. Like all NY restaurants, seating is tight but not uncomfortably so. For food, I opted for the croque Madame, basically a grilled ham and cheese, and added fried eggs. The sandwich was huge and I had to eat it with a fork and knife because the eggs were plopped on top. It was served with some pretty good potatoes and a small mixed green salad.  Honestly, after poking through some other reviews, I'm surprised to see such harsh food critiques. I thought the dish was presented nicely and was actually quite good. My partner felt similarly about his dish, which was basically the same as mine but served on a croissant. The one food negative for me was the coffee. Not a very effective pick-me-up. Service was a little rough. Not unpleasant, just a string of infrequent one word interactions. It was difficult to flag our server down for water/coffee refills.  I enjoyed the decor. TSQ was certainly not as upscale, but it reminded me of a couple of brasseries I've enjoyed immensely, those being Gaslight in Boston and Modavie in Montreal if anyone reading this visits those cities and is looking for recommendations. Getting to NYC is not something we get to do often, so it's unlikely I'll return here with so many other options, but if you're staying in Times Square and just want to grab a bite before hitting the road, this place will do.",2,,

We were also there on New Year's so I try to cut any venue some slack especially on a day when they're also dealing with drunken patrons and a busy private event delivering multiple dinners at the same time.   To be fair, some of the waitstaff were sweet and attentive too.  And we kind of calibrated our expectations to not be the Fanciest Meal Ever.I don't, however, forgive food poisoning - EVER. Consider that I started writing this review on my phone because I was too miserable from being sick from mild food poisoning to type the review on a computer.  We went here for New Year's because a friend was playing music, and had a multi course meal, including lobster bisque and salmon.  The food was pretty non descript, but some parts were tasty, like the lava cake. The food that caused me to be sick (probably the salmon), however, is unforgivable.  I can't include a direct link to their list of health inspection violations (a816-restaurantinspectio…) but they do have them, and repeated incidents - with a lot of classic cross contamination issues that gave me problems.   Gordon Ramsay would probably have a well deserved conniption fit with this place.   Please avoid it unless their violations go away.",1,,

The only people in a party of 10 who found their food edible ordered either a burger or the chicken sandwich.

Yes the food is pricey however people have to remember where you are, in the heart of midtown. Don't know if I would return back however wouldn't complain if I did.",,,

They added the spicy garlic chili sauce on top, which gave it a little kick. Definitely a decent portion for this appetizer and worth the money)The restaurant is cute and welcoming. It's around the busy Port Authority area so there's a lot of foot traffic. The service is good. I like the staircase but I get nervous about people falling haha. The bathrooms are upstairs and are not that great, it's like 2 stalls and one door doesn't even lock.

It had a very fun atmosphere, you're right there by times square and the walls open up like a garage so you feel like you're eating outside right at T.S.!One complaint I have is the waiter was not polite at all. He sat three people in front of us for no reason. He never refilled our water and he brought us our ticket like 15 minutes after we were finished, even though he saw we were ready and waiting, he was in the back doing nothing and having casual conversations with a table next to us.

I got to say, it's not actually too bad!  The bar food was decent, for what it was.  Is it a little cheesy?  Of course, otherwise!  It has to be. It's in T-SQ.  Is it a bit expensive, yeah.... it's got the typical tourist mark-up. If it wasn't for Tropical Storm Irene, this place is probably a 2 for the area.  But these are good peeps during a storm.  Totally nice, and relative to a few of the other standard places in my neighborhood, it was lively on a rainy, evacuated night.  TSQ will always have a special place for me during adverse NYC conditions.",1,,

There was a chill in the air, I asked to be seated away from the door. She then said I could wait for a table to be cleared. She then gave us the option to sit upstairs, which we decided would be acceptable to us. She tells us to go upstairs and seat ourselves at the top of stairs. There was a group next to us when we sat down,  they were waiting for a server to take there order. We looked over the menu, and were never even greeted by a server. After about ten minutes the group next to us flagged down a server that took their order. The server never acknowledged that we existed. After ten minutes, yes I timed it! We flagged down the server that delivered the drinks to the table next to us. We tried to place an order with him and were told our server would be with us shortly. After over 20 minutes waiting, we walked out. As we were leaving I asked to speak to a manager,  and was told that they were very busy.

TSQ could be your place.Bright Spots:1. the portions are extremely generous (insert old joke about the food & portions being bad)2. the wait service was good and friendly - no complaintsEven with the large portions the food is incredibly over-priced.This is an ""if you are desperate"" option",,,

The special was $4 drafts so I ordered a Bud Light. Apparently the special was for bottles. Fortunately, I'm ok with that so there was no problem there.Neither of us ate so I can't comment on that but I will comment on the state of the bathroom, and the service.First of all, the bathroom is beyond disgusting. There were 2 stalls but one was occupied so the one I had to take had a broken lock. As in, it wouldn't lock at all. Second, the stall itself looked gross so there was no way I was placing my butt on the seat, and of course there were no seat covers. On top of that, the door to the restroom itself didn't close so here I am in a stall, whose door doesn't stay closed, in front of the bathroom door that doesn't close, hovering and trying to keep from touching anything. Needless to say I was not happy.As for the service, my Mom and I had been sitting at the table we were at for probably a good 30 minutes. When my Dad joined us he ordered a drink. The waitress actually had the nerve to ask if my Mom and I paid for our beers already. This waitress had walked by our table at least 5 times in the time span it was just the 2 of us and my Mom and I were up to the bar every time we wanted another.It's super close to my job but I will never come here again.

I know New York is expensive but these were very high for the type of food they had. I went with the least expensive option and got a panini. It was just average. I have paninis all the time. I get them from a frozen dinner. I get them from the restaurant I work in where the average price is $9 for one. Both opinions were better!

Service was great at first, very friendly and helpful, but after we ordered, he disappeared and never saw him again.The menu seemed like one out of a sports bar, not a brasserie. I thought a burger would be safe, but I was wrong. There's a thing called seasoning, which really helps the food taste better. I'd like to dedicate this paragraph to the cole slaw. A friend ordered a Reuben, which is pretty hard to mess up, especially in NYC where you can get the right bread for the sandwich. It was accompanied by a cup of cole slaw which looked creamy and delicious, but when it reached my lips, I thought I was going to throw it up. The odor brought back terrible memories of finding rotten shellfish buried in a walk in. It reeked and tasted like rotten fish. By the time a server came up to the floor we were on, we had had enough. When he cleared our near-full plates, I asked him to smell the cole slaw and the face he made was very similar to mine. He told me he was taking it to the manager, but later on we found out he hadn't. Overall, the food was terrible, the service just wasn't there, and it was very poorly managed. When we left, I asked the manager if he found anything wrong with the cole slaw and his response was ""If you didn't like it, why didn't you tell them to replace it?"". I won't be back. I hope they shape up, because they are a trap to tourists and a disgrace to French brasseries.I gave it one star because the beer was good.",,,

We had four drinks for ~20 total:Margarita: Pretty Standard, it's not huge like other places, but it's not watery either.Sangria: We got a pretty heavy handed pour for this drink, but it was still tasty. Made with Hennessy VS, and only $5. Good deal.Peachy Keen Bellini: I was disappointed in this drink because it is not a true Bellini. When I drank it, it was far from the true taste, and it was a very small portion.Big Apple: I did not like this drink either. It tastes like the green-Gatorade with vodka in it.Atmosphere: When you first walk in, the atmosphere looks really nice, it matches the pretty lights of Times Square - but when you take a second look, you start noticing the little things. Chairs aren't pushed in, tables aren't cleared, empty drinks take up various spots...it looked like there used to be a big party here and everyone just up and left.Staff: The staff, when around - were reasonably attentive. Overall, when I was there - I felt like I was ""just another tourist"" to them. They seem to know that most people are there for drinks, so they don't try to pressure you to try the food. Note: many of the drinks on the menu are out of stock or are no longer made.Final Thoughts:You get what you pay for at TSQ. If you're paying for the food, you sit in a different section of the restaurant. If you're paying for drinks, don't expect anything special. It's still a fairly new establishment, so I'll check back on it in a few months - but there are plenty of other deserving places in NYC you should try first.",1,,

I had to use the restroom after walking in... walked up 2 flights of stairs and it was finally a bit cooler, went into the bathroom and it was awful. It looked like a subway station bathroom it was horrific, then being in there for a few moments it got so loud and sounded like trains were going over my head, which was definitely not possible. Finally, walked back downstairs and we had ordered dinner, I figured I'd order something simple as we didn't have too much time before the show. I had asked for a Ceasar Salad & my boyfriend got one of the steak specials. Not too long after, our food arrived.... low and behold in my salad was a dead fly. Now, normally I understand that sometimes bugs get into salads but this looked as if it was really in there. It was stuck on a piece of lettuce drenched with dressing. So, I told them they didn't seem very phased and I sent it back & 2 minutes later a new salad comes (which is actually the same salad minus the fly, GROSS). My boyfriend's steak was OK at best.

166,A B.,"Jersey City, NJ",14,36,0,1.0,1/17/2015,"If I could give negative stars, I would.  What a complete waste of space and money. We wandered in here for one reason - we were freezing cold, and it was the first warm place that had empty tables.  I wish we would have kept walking.  We should have realized that for a Friday night, the place was completely dead - only three tables of people (all tourists).  That should have been a sign.The food is DISGUSTING.  I ordered french onion soup and a pepperoni flatbread - two things that are pretty impossible to mess up.  Unless, of course, you just microwave frozen processed garbage and serve it to people.  The soup was bad - the broth had a weird chemical taste, and the ""flatbread"" was so obviously microwave pizza - like a Totino's frozen pizza.  It was TERRIBLE.  The prices were about the same as other Times Square locations (in other words, overpriced), but the food was SO BAD.  Do not bother.  Just grab a slice of pizza next door, or go to McDonalds or something. The quality of the food is the same, but you'll save your money.",,,

Updated review","Pretty much the worst meal I've had in NYC. Cold fries, less than average turkey and bri sandwich. My boyfriend ordered a pastrami of some sort and the meat was cold and so was the au jous. Once he sent it back and ordered the turkey and bri that I had, it came out in the form of the saddest looking saggy piece of shit you've ever seen. RUDE. EVERYONE WAS SO RUDE. The only good part about it was the location, but that coupled with shitty food and shitty service, id rather have a great meal in the middle of the projects.",1,,

169,Manny R.,"Baltimore, MD",0,3,0,2.0,6/29/2015,"Good Service. Crowded Dining. Subpar Food.Both my friend and I were starving after traveling all day to NYC and we were looking for a cool place to eat. Visually this restaurant looked really cool with their old time New York feel and floor to ceiling windows open since it was a beautiful night. When we got in, we were seated immediately. There were plenty of open seats, but the hostess placed us at a tiny table between two other full tables. When we asked if we could sit elsewhere because it was very crowded there, the hostess didn't seem to speak much English and we were told no. The hostess then moved a chair to the side of the table since you literally couldn't sit at the second chair because it was so close to the other diners. We saw this cramped feeling and table move requests being made by 3 other tables while we were there.The food sounded really good on the menu, but when it came it did not meet our expectations. Both the Sangria and Mojito were extremely strong. This is good for a bar, but not for a restaurant. The Truffle Mac and Cheese was the perfect proportion, but the taste was on the smokey side. The Penne ala Vodka tasted a lot like creamy tomato soup over undercooked noodles. This was disappointing because our waitress was so great and attentive.",,,
170,Jordan N.,"Charlotte, NC",0,21,0,1.0,6/17/2016,"Do not go here. Food is gross, service is slow, place is grimey. We should've yelped before we came in. The only good part was my giant Stella.",,,

172,Monika O.,"The Rocks, Australia",0,20,8,1.0,6/14/2015,"Ate here whilst on holiday in NYC and experienced the worst meal of the trip. The servings are large however, over priced, bland and sloppy. I was asked by the waitress whether we wanted water for the table to which I replied 'yes' only to find out when we grabbed the bill that the water was $9... Thanks for the heads up!

174,Dominique S.,"Stamford, CT",3,30,5,2.0,11/27/2016,"Stopped by to grab a bite to eat with my cousin since there was a 45 + minute wait at Olive Garden. First off, why advertise happy hour on a sign outside it if you don't have it..We got seated right away and had our waitress come maybe 10 minutes later. I ordered a red sangria (delicious by the way, just a tad bit too sweet) & my cousin ordered a Long Island ice tea (which she said was a little strong, but hey you can't go wrong with that) and a beer. We both ordered the mac & cheese, which by the way was $14 a piece. It came out ridiculously fast, not even 5 minutes after ordering and was alright; you can definitely tell it was powdered mix with some shredded cheddar on top.. nothing special, but big enough portion to fill us up. Our waitress never came to check on us, except when we were finished with our meals. Our bill came out to $60! I mean I know it's Manhattan but geez never again! Mediocre food and ok service, but not worth coming back to since there are so many other options.",,,

176,B M.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,12,0,2.0,5/13/2015,"Went here for a quick dinner before seeing a show with my lady.  As we were in a time crunch, it was difficult to avoid places far from the theater but didn't dare bother checking out some of the popular restaurants in TS with lines out the door.  This place didn't look too crowded.Service was excellent for the most part - we were in a hurry but the waitstaff was very accommodating and efficient. Bathrooms were a mess.The biggest issue was everything was so overpriced!  Not that the food was bad (it was decent enough), but when your sandwich costs around 20$, well unless there's something innovative through appearance, style, or ingredients used, I think we can all agree that's way overpriced.  Thankfully I had a large lunch earlier so wasn't that hungry and got a quesodilla (13-14$), which would've been much less expensive anywhere else.  Mine was a tad soggy but overall okay...Most entres were 30-40$.  Consider this place an option if there's nothing else.  It's clear they take good advantage over their location and prices that follow so unsuspected tourists can pay up!",,,
177,Mark D.,"New York, NY",7,64,3,1.0,3/14/2012,"Pretty much the worst meal I've had in a while. Everything from the food to the decor was just terrible. Stopped in here after missing a reservation and finding many of the Times Square restaurants with long wait times. If the disgusting bathroom or the hole in the floor next to our table wasn't signal enough to leave, after receiving the food I should have bolted for the door. Everything tasted off - like the weirdest, blandest, most questionable food I've ever tasted. The crab cake tasted like a carrot loaf and was served on a pile of guacamole (?!?). The calamari came drizzled with an unidentifiable sauce and the carrots and celery with the wings looked like they had given up on life. Should have run in the other direction when I had the chance.",2,1,

Their food was served cold, the Reuben that was ordered by my friend had two bites taken out of it and put back down on the plate because it was so terrible. My sliders were cold as were the fries. There was a gentleman that came in at the same time and he immediately got up and left because his crab cake was still frozen. My friend and I sat at our table trying to leave and we sat for a good 30 minutes before we even were asked how we were doing. I understand we're in New York and things tend to function differently, but come on. Really??! I mean... If there was ever a time to do a dine and dash... It would have been today. Absolutely terrible with incredibly shoddy service. I advise the populace to not be patrons at this restaurant.",,,

181,Whitney P.,"Richmond, TX",2,1,0,1.0,12/19/2015,"Came here on a trip through NYC. We had been walking for a long time and just came in without checking on Yelp. Never again. We got in and they  rushed us to order. We told the waitress we wanted to start with chicken strips. She then told us we needed to order everything at once or it would take too long for our food to get out. She kept asking what we wanted to order while we were trying to look at the menu. So we quickly decided on the penne alla vodka and a Cajun turkey burger. My husband asked for no coleslaw on the burger and we were assured that it would not be on it. Got our food and they messed up both the appetizer and my husbands dish. Coleslaw everywhere and the bread was soggy. Turkey patty was dry and basically gross. We weren't checked on at all and we never even got water to drink. When we asked for a Diet Coke, we got regular Coke. My husband is a diabetic and couldn't even drink anything during his meal because the wrong drink was brought out.To top it all off they added a 12.00 tip in automatically. Not worth it at all.",,,

186,Alonzo W.,"Yonkers, NY",27,32,22,1.0,12/24/2013,"Just left with my wife and daughter, and the food came out lukewarm and quickly got cold. The only saving grace was the large portion sizes. We sat downstairs near the entrance and I can take the wind as the door opens and closes, no problem, but, the door was broken and constantly had to be manually closed by either staff or the next patron asked to close it behind themselves. In my opinion, it was just not worth the money, as with several in the Times Square district, there is not much attention to detail, and more often than not.....mediocre food with spotty service.",1,,

I ordered the French Onion Soup and the Pastrami Sandwich. I hate to say it but the French Onion soup was probably one of the worst I had ever had. First of all, how do you burn the cheese? This was a first for me; second, the soup base was totally bland. I found it hard to believe that you can mess up French Onion Soup. However, I do have to give the restaurant a thumbs up when it came to the Pastrami sandwich. The Pastrami was cooked and sliced just right. I also like the fact that they used deli mustard instead of yellow mustard like so many other restaurants that I have been to.Overall, I think my experience could have been much better if the soup was made right. The service was excellent and the staff was very attentive.",1,,

I had a cheeseburger and fries, which was cooked perfectly and very tasty; my wife had a buffalo chicken sandwich, which was tasty, but carried a little too much hot sauce for her taste.The staff were officiant and reasonably friendly (dare I say 'England friendly' compared to the usual 'American very friendly') Also, it was a little surprising when our original waiter sat down at the table behind my wife and proceeded to eat his lunch too!The place was a little dated and tired in terms of its décor, especially the male toilet, which when I entered I thought I had accidentally stumbled into an abandoned staff toilet. My wife also felt similar feelings towards the female toilets.A slightly bizarre experience all in all, with okay food.

That's all that we were looking for, an opportunity to get a drink, nothing more.We sat down and it wasn't too crowded, but service was slow. The bartender was slow in getting to us so we could even order drinks. Once we did, it took a while to get the drinks to us. We just watched her making drinks and socializing with other people. Lame. We ordered a Chocolate and Peanut Butter Pie as well because my friend wanted to save the cheesecake dessert for Lindy's (see that review).The pie was actually the BEST thing of the night. It was rich and chocolaty and delicious. It was just plain out good! But the drinks were all right, but the service was like molasses! I couldn't get out of there fast enough.
