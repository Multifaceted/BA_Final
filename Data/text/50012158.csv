0,Tal O.,"Brooklyn, NY",294,119,1320,5.0,10/2/2018,"Intimate cozy underground spot for jazz music lovers!  Its bare bones focus is the jazz experience. It is not pretentious and is a nice place for a relaxed evening. A bunch of musicians were in the crowd and came up spontaneously to play along with the main act and it was nice to see the different styles and hear different instruments. We came an hour after the show started (we came at 12am) but we were still let in (at a half price cover charge of $10 instead of $20)We grabbed drinks by the bar and got a nice table up front. I loved mezzrow very much, for me it was a most simpatico, charming little place (staff was really great too specifically the host). Im hoping to come here again soon.",4,2,5
1,William C.,"Chevy Chase, MD",219,26,1,3.0,9/2/2018,"Reserve a table ahead of time, and get there early to get a good one! If you have table seating, it is a great place to see some jazz up close.If you're at the bar seats, however, you aren't going to be seeing anything. The first time I went, I made the mistake of just showing up and paying the $20 cover to see... literally nothing. We were even too far away to HEAR the music clearly. Thankfully, the cover also gets you into smalls afterward, which was a blast and has a way better layout.Also of note: the beer menu is a scam. Last I went, there were two columns, ""Pint"" and ""Pilsner."" Huh? One of these is a size and the other is a type of beer. Worse yet, the pint is not even a pint!!!I literally tested this. A pint is 16 ounces, people. Any beer drinker knows what a pint looks like, so I was immediately suspicious when I saw the tiny mug with a 100-mile thick glass bottom, but of course I wanted to be sure before giving them sh*t on Yelp. Thankfully, my gluten-free friend ordered some 12-oz bottle of soda after I'd finished my beer... muahaha. Experiment time.Sure enough, I poured at most ~11 ounces of soda into my ""pint"" glass, and it filled the darn thing to the brim. SPOTTED. Not a pint.",,,
2,Sam P.,"Kennesaw, GA",0,12,2,5.0,7/29/2018,"Stumbled on this gem during our trip to NYC and could not be more pleased. There's not much to report because it focuses on one thing Jazz. And if you want an intimate evening with purveyors of this art craft look no further. We were able to catch Luis Perdomo and Rufus Reid burning it up on July 28th. Get tickets, get in line a bit early and you will get seated right up front. Note that you will be seated with strangers, but break the ice and talk!We lined it so much that we stayed for the second set as they had a couple unsold seats for the second set. Awesome. No food to speak of, just solid drinks. Oh, only one bathroom. Other than that check it out.",,,
3,Steve S.,"Denver, CO",6,454,2,5.0,11/1/2018,"Awesome little spot. Village Vanguard was full so walked around the corner to see Pasquale Grasso and Ari Roland. caught 11:00pm set. Love this place. It's in the basement, so you'll hear the subway when it goes by every 10 minutes...feels like it's coming through the wall. Nice and helpful host at the door. Good drinks. And very special guest showed up, one of the greats, Gene Bertoncini. I love NYC.",,,
4,Nikita P.,"Fullerton, CA",38,216,148,4.0,9/9/2018,"We tried to get into Smalls, which was sold out (of course) so we decided to go to Mezzrow instead. We managed to snag a table right by the stage, which was fantastic. I felt like I was at a private event where I had somehow managed to get on the guest list, lol. The jazz was great and the musicians had someone they knew in the audience come up and sing a few numbers with them on stage.",1,,1
5,t.j. m.,"Los Angeles, CA",1983,52,126,5.0,7/24/2018,"This our favorite jazz spot, tied with bar 55. It's a classy place and people treat everyone like a very important person (VIP in jazz talk) and the small plates are just enough to compliment the rose lemonade that is ordered (cheese plate, olives or mixed nuts) and they have cocktails for every jazzy tastebud in your mouth of blues.  It's a small place, but as far as jazz hallways, this one is elegant, covered in memorabilia and the patrons are people you would want to come over for cordials and conversation while a Harold Lloyd film plays in the background.  The bartender and staff are A major and there is never a flat note in the joint.  Guests drop by, vocalists ooze soothing sounds of better times- reservations are recommended, because they keep it to a cool cat crowd but never crowded. Tell 'em t.j. sent ya. And order a rose lemonade to toast Rose Petal Pistol.",5,3,5
6,Lawrence P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,2,1.0,7/15/2018,"DISORGANIZED AND SEATING IS COMPLETELY A MESS. We've been to Smalls many times and decided to check out Mezzrow. We made a reservation for the listening room and arrived 40 minutes before the show. After we were seated and ordered drinks, the host came by and told us he needed to move us. This seemed inexplicable to us. Apparently a larger party arrived later and to make room for them, he wanted to move us to the back of the room facing the wall. He told us we had to give up our seats or leave. If this would bother you, then you should avoid coming to this venue.ARRIVING EARLY DOES NOT MEAN GOOD SEATS. You will be seated and shuffled around by the host in order to fill all the seats in the room. Preference is apparently given to regulars and larger parties. Definitely NOT A PLACE FOR A DATE, as couples are easy to shuffle around to make room for others. We thought this was unfair and decided to leave, especially since the band was just all right. With all the good Jazz venues in West Village, there's really no reason to come here.",2,,
7,Dina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",97,20,7,5.0,10/3/2018,"AMAZING. Very cozy, underground type setting, I found it fascinating that people just go up to play, maybe I will be up there next ;) Really truly lovely, everyone who works there was cordial and pleasant.",,,
8,Elle L.,"New York, NY",19,55,52,4.0,10/15/2017,"Wow. This place and the way it worked was a mess. I read online that walk ins were welcome. We go and arrive around 7 and wait in line. We had seen something about reserved seating...but we hadn't realized that reserved seating meant you were the only ones getting a seat. The place is tiny and very very tight. If you walk in and opt for the bar lounge area...don't do it. You are literally standing a foot away from the entrance door where people are crowding and pushing you out of the way for $25. It was terrible. My roommate went up to the guy and checked to see if we could get our money back (no harm in asking). The main guy was a huge jerk. I want to call him a different name. The host, on the other hand, was very nice. He suggested doing a reserved seating for the next showing. We payed the $5 difference per person and left to get food and come back. That's when it finally got good. We were sat super close to the performers. You felt the music and wow. So nice. So in summation, if you go...get the reserved seating beforehand and arrive early early early!!!! If you're claustrophobic then this isn't the place for you. But after the whole ordeal got sorted we really enjoyed ourselves.",3,,
9,Linda B.,"Chicago, IL",99,294,698,4.0,9/29/2017,"We tried to go to smalls but the line was intimidating so we ended up at Mezzrow. That  worked out just fine.There are obviously regulars who all know each other, but the people from Mezzrow go out of their way to make everyone feel welcome.There's a $10 cover plus one drink minimum which isn't bad at all. We arrived about 1130, which was the start of another set. The music was very enjoyable, and both my cocktails were smooth and clean-tasting. I'd definitely come back.",3,1,1
10,W J.,"Manhattan, NY",2,102,22,5.0,8/17/2017,This is one of my favorite little jazz clubs in New York City. I love coming here to tune in to the great musicians. The staff is wonderful. It's a cozy little hole in the wall in the West Village and I always love it!Friends of mine like Kenny Werner and Kate McGarry and Keith Ganz have all played here. So wonderful to see them in the space.Check it out!,2,,1
11,Ali K.,"Manhattan, NY",110,239,1311,4.0,12/4/2016,"Intimate, old school and New Orleans charm on a smaller scale.  The cover goes to support the artist playing that night so be aware that there is a one drink minimum at the bar or seats. Also the evening is broken into shows and the jazz doesn't go on forever allowing you to come here after or before dinner or drinks with friends and relax and get away. The rumble of the subway you can feel passing by not too far from the jazz club just adds to the charm in my opinion. We were seated relatively promptly after the preceding show was over (would strongly encourage you to reserve your seats, it's a small intimate space, limited seating in the listening room). The host and server were attentive and friendly. The only minor issue was the soap stains on the glass but I suppose just a one off issue. Your tickets also get you into Smalls, sort of Mezzrow's sister club. So two for the price of one :)",2,,
12,Daan K.,"New York, NY",19,71,40,5.0,12/22/2017,My favorite bar and jazz venue of New York by far! Great listening room in the back and bar area with great drinks and the best bar staff one could think of!!,,,
13,Leontina P.,"Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",1,1,0,1.0,5/12/2018,Music could not be better. Sits not so much. But the bad thing is they allow people on the bar to talk louder than  the music - sometimes you cannot hear it. Totally ruined the experience,1,,
14,Julie K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,12/31/2017,"Jazz pianist , Pete Malinverni's Wednesday night late set at 11 pm  , is a very special evening out . I have been many times to Mezzrow specifically to hear him . He is such a soulful player , and his choice of tunes , along with his intimate style of playing  and communicating with the audience , will transport you into another era.The setting is cozy , and lends itself perfectly for his trio. What a beautiful way to spend a couple of hours .",,,

16,Charles M.,"South Gate, CA",1,16,79,4.0,10/28/2017,Unless you have a good mouth piece to get close seats I recommend a reservation. We got midway and that was a tight fight. Jazz rings throughout though.,,,
17,Kate H.,"New York, NY",73,57,31,5.0,8/27/2017,"We stopped by the other night to hear Nellie McKay. A perfect, intimate space to hear jazz with a cocktail in-hand. Note that there is a cover charge and you are required to purchase one drink per person. But totally worth it for one of the best listening experiences in the Village.",,,
18,Kumar S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,7,0,5.0,4/4/2018,"Just returned from the most delightful two hours listening to Pete Malinverni, the very talented pianist, and his guest, Karren Allyson, a lovely singer.The highlight of the evening, though, was the playing of Pete's stundents; Pete is the head of Jazz Studies at SUNY, Purchase. Listening to his students restored my faith in the future of jazz in America.Will be back there on Wednesdays when Pete performs.",,,
19,Becky P.,"Rolling Hills Estates, CA",143,164,64,4.0,12/29/2015,"What is great about this place across the street from Smalls is 1. You can get in 2. The music is fantastic. The drinks aren't bad either and reasonably priced for being in fancy jazz land. Good wines and basic beers and whiskeys. The sitting area is small / intimate and they respect silence during the sets which is nice, no annoying background chatter. The only drawback is that the service is pretty slow and the owner or guy who sat us had an attitude. You will wait forever seated for your drinks to arrive so going to the bar is a must. No real food options, just some cheese and olives you can order so eat before.Overall a really cool nook to listen to bands and super chill to stay and see the jam sessions after the regular sets. Great vibe.",1,,
20,Rebecca D.,"Winchester, MA",0,11,0,5.0,2/23/2018,"Great experience here!  Music (jazz piano) phenomenal.  I wanted to give this place 5 stars, because it gave us everything we came for an more, though I did consider 4 stars just because of the waitress - she may have been having a bumpy night - she wasn't exactly unpleasant, but..  The best part about the place is the ambiance and -- on the night we came -- the musicians.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.",,,
21,Alexa H.,"Santa Monica, CA",39,1,0,5.0,7/3/2017,"Music is exceptional and everyone who works there is super friendly and awesome!! Literally favorite jazz club in the city, plus ticket to mezzrow also allows you to swing by smalls. THE BEST",,,
22,Josephine Z.,"Queens, NY",748,432,173,4.0,5/26/2016,"Mezzrow has great charm. Exposed brick, intimate seating, and the gentle clinking of bar sounds accompanying live jazz. In the jazz circle of the West Village, people take Jazz here seriously. Live Jazz can stop you in your tracks, either by being beautiful...or by being weird. The night I went to Mezzrow, I was having a fantastic time. The drinks were good, we were given the seats up in the front in the listening room, and the crowd was all smiles. The piano and the soprano saxophone duo was great when they started jamming and jiving. Then it got weird when the saxophone player began banging on the piano chords with his instrument, and the piano player began hitting saxophone keys. Then the piano player stuck paper in the piano chords, and that's when they lost me. Big fan of Jazz, and expression of arts. But that was a weird one, guys. I'll definitely be back some other night...probably for a different set.",1,2,3
23,Lisa S.,"New York, NY",57,62,2,2.0,7/9/2017,"Obviously we were just here for he music in a small and crowded venue, but the waitress had to ruin the experience by constantly stalking our table to order drinks when we had barely had a chance to review the menu. Her service was completely impersonal, she kept bumping into us and cherry on the cake was 18% auto gratuity. It was the worst table experience I've ever had which overshadowed the performance. She kept walking among the tables during the performance distributing and collecting checks during a filmed performance in an already view obstructed event. Clearly she was only concerned about her compensation for the night and not on the guests' and musicians' experience.",2,,
24,Aimee K.,"Saint Louis, MO",3913,799,2629,5.0,10/24/2015,"There is one thing for certain, and that's the fact that I love an amazing underground jazz club. What a perfect thing to do on a chilly fall Tuesday in New York.On the night we stopped by, there was a cover - I believe $10 for each - which we didn't mind paying. There were a few guys already playing and the seats appeared to be full, so we grabbed two stools at the bar. The bartender was seriously great and made some badass manhattans and old fashions - I could have enjoyed her drinks for hours. Unfortunately, we couldn't see the music from the bar.Much to my surprise, the super nice man at the door who was collecting the cover came up to us and let us know there were two seats open at the front of the room! We gratefully (and quietly - this crowd was focused on the music) made our way to them and sat there for a good few hours. The same bartender kept our drinks filled, and we watched as three VERY talented 20-something women played the saxophone, piano, and bass. They were just incredible, and the venue made for such a unique experience.This place is dark, sexy, intimate, and the drinks are strong. The only thing better than the drinks is the music.I'll be back on my next visit. You might want to call ahead, though, because I think they're usually a lot busier than they were on the night we went.",7,1,5
25,John J.,"Wyckoff, NJ",1,17,5,3.0,6/25/2017,Great little place to sit down and get a couple drinks.The atmosphere is perfect and the music is intimate. This is hands down my favorite place to go. The reason I don't give it the full 5 stars is that everytime I've come here the stinky door man ruins my mood with his rude behavior. You would thinking listening to such beautiful music would cheer up a man like that.,2,,
26,Tim P.,"London, KY",11,87,4,5.0,7/28/2017,"This is probably my favorite jazz club in town. If you are looking for great live jazz, this is the place to go to. The music is amazing and the drinks are good and not outrageously priced. And did I say the music is fantastic? You have to pay a cover to get in but for a slightly higher up charge you can sit in the listening area close to the stage where others around you are not allowed to talk or even look at their phones so that you can focus entirely on the live music. In fact, during the performance someone spoke and everyone shushed them.",,,
27,China B.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,8,0,4.0,8/18/2017,It's small n therefore a small crowd would have the place packed BUT I loved it great live jazz by some great artists if u r an admire of jazz please stop by u won't regret it I definitely wanna come back,,,
28,Alexandra W.,"Manhattan, NY",2,88,0,4.0,4/9/2017,"Great music. Saw Eddie Gomez. They also have really good drinks, great wine list w an awesome cab and not too $$. No food so eat before. Place is easy to miss. Downstairs. Super cozy. Arrive early to get better seats in listening room not hallway. And would def book reserved seats ahead. Place is tiny and seating is extremely cramped. Be prepared for that and you will not be annoyed. Narrow hallway to wait for seating and you will share tiny table w other people and sit side by side. If you can deal w that you will love this very cozy, very NYC jazz spot w excellent music and drinks",2,1,
29,Janis W.,"New York, NY",133,9,0,4.0,3/29/2017,"I love mezzrow and have been there many times usually in the front tables. Last night was crowded and for the cover fee of 20, sitting in the back tables where visibility of the band is less the issue so much as you cant really hear the music. there are speakers in this long club far from the band but they are for the radio or CD player, not the band. Kind of shocking there are no speakers for the band. Spike, please get that set up!! you hear the bar more than the band if you happen to get stuck in those back seats!",2,,
30,Ava A.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",10,12,0,5.0,3/13/2017,"Everything you could possibly want from a jazz club, I loved everything about it. The greatest kind of vibe and atmosphere, and amazingly talented and genuinely passionate musicians. Simply wonderful.",2,,1
31,Ashley B.,"New York, NY",305,32,32,5.0,4/23/2015,"Fantastic jazz club!! It was my first time here and I loved it. We definitely lucked out and scored a table directly in front but even if we hadn't, it still would have beena great experience. The performers were incredible and authentic. This place was a dimly lit, narrow and intimate, classic jazz joint. The people here seemed like true lovers of jazz and showed a great deal of respect as these amazing performers were on stage. This place makes you so proud to live in New York City.",8,,2
32,Andrea S.,"San Francisco, CA",2,19,0,1.0,9/3/2017,"The spot is great if you can get a seat, but not worth the cover if you cannot. It gets filled very quickly, and if you're not seated you can't hear anything but the chatter of the 18 year-olds who also crowd the place. The staff is overwhelmed and overworked, pushing and shoving quite forcibly to make their way through the badly laid-out and packed club. A wasted $40; we left after 10 minutes.",1,,
33,Lucas F.,"Brasília, Brazil",1,6,4,5.0,5/27/2015,"I read about this ""new"" jazz club some weeks before my second trip to NY and I had a great luck to be able to see and hear the master bass player Ron Carter and the great pianist Ethan Iverson right in front of me.Great sounding room, beautiful piano, small and cozy place to hear great music.No food, so a stop at a near restaurant before or after the sessions is recommended. No minimum drink consumption, though.Certainly a place that I will visit every time I go to NY.",1,,
34,Ezra K.,"La Mirada, CA",10,20,28,5.0,2/26/2017,Must go jazz bar in New York. The most intimate setting with amazing musicians that put all their passion and love into their performance.

36,Dawn I.,"Tampa, FL",60,69,18,5.0,2/19/2017,"We were able to show up right before the 9:00 set on a Sunday night and get seating. We really enjoyed listening to David Hazeltine. The vibe here is laid back. The space is narrow and although you wouldn't be able to see much from the bar area, you could still hang out there and enjoy the music. I tried one of the mixed cocktails and found it to be tasty. Was a nice balance-not string but not weak either. The perfect drink to help one relax and enjoy the evening.",,,
37,Rene B.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,342,798,3.0,1/10/2016,Went here on Saturday night after trying to get into Smalls.  We paid $20 each to get in and the only seats were in the back where you could not see the band.  This was disappointing.  If you pay a fee to see a band - you want to see the band otherwise you can listen to jazz on the radio.  However after a few songs we were able to move closer and we could see the band and feel part of the experience.  So if you go make sure you can get a seat near the band otherwise you can save the cover fee and go to a lounge with jazz music.,1,,
38,John M.,"Miami, FL",0,15,3,2.0,12/8/2017,"this place gets crowded and you don't get to see the musicians, so is like listening to live music on the speaker system. $7 beer and pricy cocktails.",1,,
39,Paul C.,"Long Branch, NJ",115,17,20,5.0,1/22/2017,"Do you want to hear legit Jazz? Mezzrow brings you the best Jazz Musicians into an intimate speak easy setting underground. The ""music room"" is $25 and shaped like a rectangle with the musicians playing in the front/top of the room and people sitting on the sides. The ""listening room"" is $20 and a very narrow/ long rectangle before you get into the ""music room"". I sat in the front row of the ""music room"" literally 2 feet from the piano. Its a completely different experience to be up close versus hearing the music play as you walk into the club. Get there 45 min before show and try to get the ""music room"". The drinks were great too. Another cool thing is that its same owner as Smalls Jazz club across the avenue and your tickets work at both clubs (not sure if thats all the time) so you can hear a lot of music in one night if you want to. Such a great night!",,,
40,Jonah K.,"Miami Beach, FL",387,1556,10,3.0,5/25/2015,"Great staff in a hidden spot. Owned by the same people who own smalls so you can get in here before a show for free. We didn't show up on time and we were so far from the group playing that you couldn't see much if anything. The place is more like a room and a hallway than an actual open room. The staff is wonderful all around, but if you come to hear/see live music then you may not enjoy it as much.",5,,
41,Ross B.,"Atlanta, GA",0,13,0,5.0,12/29/2016,"Mezzrow.... Yes it's a bit cramped, perhaps even claustrophobic. But I honestly believe it's the best jazz club in NYC for after hours shows. If you want an early 7:30 show you might want to go to blue smoke or the village vanguard but for a late night show nothing beats Mezzrow. It's an ideal choice for after theatre... or why not extend your night after an early show? The night is still young. Go to Mezzrow at 11:30 or midnight I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",,,

44,Darryl R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,26,0,5.0,1/2/2016,"Enjoyed the evening at Mezzrow. Music was excellent. Johnny Oneal did the late set and was very good. The shape of the club is a little awkward. The front has seating at tables and the people there are really into the music though there was some talking. The back where the bar is and the hallway are not good spots to see or hear the music. A lot of loud conversations in the back. Why do people come to hear great musicians  and spend the night talking? Would they do that if they were listening to classical music at Carnegie hall. Its disrespectful to the music, the musicians and the patrons. The ambience is nice and the service was good. Will be back",3,1,

Standards from the Great American songbook played by creative masters. If you feel like talking - do it softly at the bar away from those who happily pay their $20.

It was great to see Spike do his thing and other old faces from the old Smalls days and the drinks were affordable and delectable.,2,,2
54,Jeff P.,"Jackson Heights, NY",2,30,1,5.0,2/4/2015,"I've been to Mezzrow several times now, and it already feels like the place I want to hear my favorite musicians. The room itself is acoustically outstanding, and the piano duet configuration is always interesting (think the old and badly missed Bradley's).What Mezzrow also has going for it is the owner, Spike Wilner, an accomplished pianist, owner of the equally hip (but different) Smalls. Spike is not only a gentleman who respects the musicians and the patrons who come to hear them.

55,Carolyn F.,"Buffalo, NY",0,53,0,5.0,5/12/2016,"Loved this place!  I was visiting New York and a friend recommended Smalls for jazz.  Smalls was packed and standing room only and this club was included in my $20 admission so we decided to check it out.  So glad we did!  Great, relaxed, cozy atmosphere.  Was not crowded at all, jazz trio was excellent!  Great drinks and we ordered a cheese plate which was wonderful too!  Service was also excellent!",,,1
56,Katie T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,1/17/2016,"This place is cute and cozy, but the MANAGEMENT is terrible and unprofessional, the owner promised my friend and I for a table but then he gave that table to someone else came in after us without reservation",2,,
57,Natalie K.,"Valhalla, NY",0,17,1,5.0,7/16/2016,"Lovely, romantic ambience to listen to jazz, relax and enjoy drinks. Admission price is reasonable and they have a separate student admission when you show your ID. The musicians they pick to perform are wonderful- I was so enthralled with the music I lost track of time for when I had to actually leave! Will definitely come back again.",,,
58,Alex S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,2.0,2/6/2016,"It's a nice place, but recently has become very crowded on weekends.  That's made it less fun, hard to hear the music., etc",1,,
59,Rosie N.,"Woodside, NY",6,40,79,4.0,2/16/2015,"Great location, we went on Saturday for Valentines, for the free set around 7pm.  The piano player was great and connected very well with the audience. The services was great once a more established Waitress came in she was very friendly and attentive, She wished us all happy Vday. Our original waitress was new and seem very nervous. Great experience looking forward to going back next week.",,,1
60,Armando R.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,29,1,5.0,3/5/2016,So awesome. We came for the free piano jazz show and had wonderful cocktails. A great atmosphere.,,,
61,Elizabeth B.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,1,5.0,3/8/2016,Went here last Saturday night for the free show. Mezzrow is a true hidden gem. I hesitate to even write this review for fear that more people will find out that you can enjoy an hour and a half of great jazz for the mere price of a drink. Don't tell anyone please!,,,
62,Uga B.,"Cranston, RI",234,14,1,5.0,10/16/2015,"I had a great date the other night at this comfortable and cozy piano lounge in the Village. The drinks were very reasonably priced and the music, which was played by lounge owner Spike Wilner, set exactly the right romantic mood. He even took requests from the crowd! I couldn't have been happier here.",1,,
63,M M.,"New York, NY",0,30,0,4.0,2/22/2016,"Kevin Hays on piano, Gregoire Maret on harp, a Tito's on ice and a table up front... sometimes  this City loves me back!   Of course the place is tiny as hell, but you can't have it all!",,,
64,Ian H.,"London, United Kingdom",0,8,0,5.0,5/29/2015,This is the kind of place you really hope you'll find. From the exposed brick to the beautiful warm Steinway to the talented line up. You can't help but wish this was in your neighbourhood.,1,,
65,Catalina A.,"San Francisco, CA",0,7,0,4.0,1/6/2015,"This setting is really intimate and cozy, and you get to be very close to the performers, which is great. The service was good. Overall, this is a pretty good jazz spot; I docked them a star because they 1.) do not serve food 2) charge for peanuts and 3). do not keep peanuts consistently stocked, which means you will be out of luck if you arrive hungry. Additionally, they do not do free refills, which I did not appreciate.  Aside from that, however, this is a pretty solid little spot.",,2,
66,Bob W.,"Mountainside, NJ",0,11,0,5.0,9/3/2015,this is a perfect nyc hidden place -no cover jazz at 730 - the piano player was one of the best I ever heard   nice décor -drinks  at a fair place and nice staff,,,
