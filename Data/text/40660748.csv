0,Susie W.,"KNICKERBOCKER, NY",222,109,90,5.0,11/17/2018,"PROS:- can actually make a reservation! YAY! (so rare now a days in NYC)- its very loud downstairs, but dont let that intimidate you, it is very intimate and romantic upstairs, they have a HUGE space- amazing food, all the dishes that we picked out DID NOT disappoint, except the baklava dessert, the texture was a little weird, I guess the expectation was that it would be similar to a baklava and it came out completely different. All the savory dishes were great, very rich in flavor and high in fat, with sprouts of green on top hopefully to balance out the fattyness. It is great to share among others so you get to try all different type of foods all night- my favorite: lamb meatballs, fried hen of woods, brussel sprouts, short ribs - great service CONS: - I really cant think of any :D",,,
1,Angelka B.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",0,7,9,4.0,11/10/2018,"BEST OCTOPUS EVER!!!!!I should start with if you have decided to spend a night there, you MUST try octopus. This is the best octopus I have ever tried! Grilled, juicy and not dry !!!We had 2 or 3 of those!Small plates! It's not good or bad, it's up to you what you prefer. Good wine! Even if you go with less expensive option for $50-60 per bottle, you are safe, it has very good taste! So go for it!And the last thing why it's 4/5 stars, they accept only AMEX or CASH!",,,
2,Jordan V.,"Port Moody, Canada",45,285,60,4.0,11/7/2018,"Yes yes yes. This is what small plates is all about.The Scallops. Succulent and moreish. (We did order more)Brussels Sprouts with Goat Cheese. Pungent but sweet.Roasted Beets. Earthy yet creamy.Black Truffle Burrata with Meyer Lemon and Artichoke. Rich and zesty.Ricotta Gnocchi. Fluffy with a wonderful sauce.Mushroom flatbread. Probably one of the best flatbreads I've ever tasted.Braised Shortrib. Melt-in-your-mouth and deep in flavour, but with a nice hit of fresh grated horseradish.Rabbit ravioli. Hoppy? Nah, just good.So in short, every plate we tried was fantastic. The space provides a great atmosphere. The two levels are surprisingly intimate and cosy feeling.The service was attentive, but slightly condescending. This was the only real miss in our experience here.",,,
3,Jennifer D.,"Manhattan, NY",161,340,2193,4.0,10/22/2018,"Hidden away on a residential street with no signage to mark it in a beautiful brown stone you'll find Alta. The atmosphere is cozy, romantic, and beautiful. Rustic, low lights, candles. Great place to go with a group and share delicious tapas and excellent wine. 4 of us shared 7 plates and one dessert. Dates and olives wrapped in bacon, grilled octopus, paella,  brussel sprouts, chilled eggplant, linguini pepperoncini, braised short rib, and the butterscotch foam. The highlights for me were the braised short rib - melt in your mouth beef over a wonderful beet pasta, the octopus - nice char on the outside tender inside with tangy cilantro gremolata, and the paella - shrimp, clams, calamari, mussels, chorizo, over charred saffron rice.. Nom nom. Great wine list and excellent sangria. Expect to spend some coin tho you'll be glad you did because it's a relaxing and lovely dining experience.",2,,1
4,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",3,59,26,3.0,11/12/2018,"Atmosphere is nice and on the formal side.  Got the rabbit ravioli, burrata cheese and scallops.  Flavor of all of them were good but the texture of the ravioli wasn't the best. There wasn't much chew and the outside was not aldente. Scallops were perfectly cooked and had excellent seasoning.  Pretty pricey for the portion sizes.  Not sure that I would come back here again.",,,
5,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,4.0,5/15/2018,"A bit of history for ya: the word ""tapas"" comes from the Spanish word ""tapar,"" which means to cover. In the olden days, sherry drinkers in taverns would use a flat item, like a slice of bread or meat, to cover their drinks to protect it from fruit flies; this developed into topping this ""cover"" with a snack. It became standard to make the snacks as salty as possible so people would keep ordering sherry. And boom! Here we are at Alta having entire meals of tapas!Ambiance-wise, perfect date spot. Dim, romantic, sophisticated, slightly cramped, irritatingly loud after 7ish. AMEX or cash only. Hostess was so friendly, but the waitress, not so. Tapas means quality cool food with pricey tags. What we ordered: Shrimp tapa with chorizo, avocado, garlic sherry vinaigrette - 3/5 tiny portion, but the shrimp was tasty, and what I was particularly impressed by was the two tiny pieces of chorizo. Wish there was more!Steak tapa with parsley root, celery, tomato mustard - 5/5 significant portion, cut up to share, cooked perfectly. This was my favorite. I practically inhaled it. Must get!Asparagus tapa with pesto, cured egg, pine nuts - 4/5 a lot of thought was put into this. If you'd like a creative, but healthy dish, get this. I loved how thick and fresh the asparagus was. Lamb meatballs tapa with red pepper, brown butter labneh, pine nuts - 5/5 I've never had meatballs quite like this. They had a sweet and tangy aftertaste that I couldn't get enough of.Overall, pretty restaurant, great food, meh service, and extremely loud crowd. I'd recommend you try it if you have money to throw around and don't mind the volume.",9,7,10
6,D C.,"Manhattan, NY",181,21,1,4.0,11/13/2018,"Killer small bites menu, perfectly executed.  Place is super popular and there can be a wait - book ahead, ask to sit upstairs & enjoy!!!",,,
7,Jamie G.,"Waltham, MA",73,78,6,5.0,11/13/2018,"Great service and atmosphere. Love the architecture. Food was so flavorful. We shared the tuna crudo, Brussels sprouts, foie gras, pork empanadas, roasted beets. The empanadas were the only thing I wouldn't order again.",,,
8,Jing X.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,4,3,1.0,10/13/2018,"Terrible terrible customer service! My husband called and made the reservation for my birthday dinner. We got there around 5pm when there was almost empty on the third floor and I saw a window seat. Since it was my special day, we requested for that window seat. First they told us that seat was reserved for special dinner menu, so I asked what special menu? They said it was for a Birthday. I said today it's my birthday too and since right now no body was sitting there can we sit there? Then their manger came and told us no window seat is available in the entire restaurant(though at that time the place is more than 2/3 empty!) I got really annoyed by how inconsiderate they were and said then we will go to another restaurant. They were like: go ahead, we don't care. So we left and went to another French wine bar nearby which the service is 100 times better than this place! I would NEVER go back to this place and would NOT recommend any of my friends go to this place neither!",2,1,
9,Jackie S.,"New York, NY",946,751,3018,4.0,3/25/2018,"Alta has been on my foodie radar for some time and I finally made it in. WARNING: It's cash or Amex ONLY, come prepared (thank goodness they told me when they called to confirm my reservation). Speaking of reservations, make one, or else you won't be seated. This place is a zoo.The food is fantastic. It's tapas so your best bet is to order a bunch of plates and share. The only thing is that most of the portions are pretty small with a heavy price tag. New York City, man.Anyway, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My friend and I shared the fried goat cheese, salmon tartare, black truffle burrata, octopus a la plancha, ricotta gnocchi, and the lamb meatballs. My favorites were the goat cheese and the gnocchi but everything was good. The rose sangria is excellent, and the glass is very big. Our server was great and super attentive.When you come, ask to sit upstairs. The ambiance is very romantic, a great date spot fit for foodies.",5,1,3
10,Dawn Q.,"New York, NY",330,47,26,5.0,8/9/2018,"I went here on a Wednesday night for a tapa-style dinner. I enjoyed the vibe from the moment I walked in - the bar would have been a great place to grab drinks even if I hadn't stayed for dinner. We were lucky enough to sit upstairs and had a great view of the entire room. The ambience was romantic and intimate (although could get pretty loud). We started off by ordering drinks - this was the only disappointing note of the evening. I got a red sangria and my friend got a white sangria. The red sangria was very watery. It was a hot day, so I'm assuming the ice had just melted but it was overall tasteless and disappointing. My friend's white sangria was much better.For dinner we ordered the brussel sprouts, octopus a la plancha, ricotta gnocchi, and the lamb meatballs. The sauce on the brussel sprouts was rich and delicious. The octopus was soft and not chewy; I could have done without the chickpeas but overall good. The ricotta gnocchi was rich and cheesy, and with bacon just hit the spot. Lastly the lamb meatballs had delightful spice! We finished with dessert: the warm chocolate cake. GET THIS. I repeat. get this. For the chocolate lovers out there it was the absolute perfect end to the meal. Overall, the dishes were pretty small and rather pricey (it was tapas style) but we felt that for the two of us it was the appropriate amount. Each was delicious so definitely worth it. I would absolutely come back here with a friend or a date.",,,
11,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,3.0,2/15/2018,"3.5. I had my Valentine's dinner here and to be honest, it was okay. Nothing stood out or was memorable for me to return. No happy hour on Valentine's day. I'm guessing this applies to other holidays? We were seated upstairs around 6:30pm. It wasn't busy. The ambiance was intimate. The service was quick and efficient. The food came luke warm. We ordered: - Salmon tartare: Don't reccomend at all. I somehow had high expectations being that the portion was extremely small. It tasted very fishy and I didn't like how the salty cracker overpowered the fish. - Brussel sprouts: Very good. Possibly my favorite dish of the night. They were cooked nicely and the creme they served it with was addicitive. - Ricotta gnocchi: Average. The sauce was too bland and watered down for my taste. Might just be my preference. - Braised short rib: Average. I was a little upset they didn't serve it with spaghetti but instead pappardelle. But it tasted good. The short rib was tender but I felt like something was lacking in flavor. - Red sangria: AWESOME! It came in a large glass. It was absolutely delicious.We weren't impressed to stick around for another drink or dessert.",3,,3
12,Eric K.,"New York, NY",603,72,78,5.0,4/25/2018,"Spanish tapas are my weakness, and alta does them justice. Four of us were quite stuffed. One of my bucket list items is to now eat the entire menu, which costs $500 or so. The things we liked were:Brussel sprouts: our first dish, and was an amazing first impression of Alta for us. The apple and creme made the brussel sprouts sweet and juicy. Definitely worth getting again.Black truffle burrata: I don't like cheese, but my friends loved this dish, so I defer to their judgement.Grilled eggplants: ""meaty"" and marinated well. Well balanced by the other veggies on the dish.Octopus a la plancha: really soft and chewy! The chick pea and lemon flavored this really well as well.Paella: it had less rice than I had hoped for but countered this with more seafood than I expected. Rich and flavorful, the rice was infused with seafood and herb flavor.Salmon tartare: the tartare was really soft and rich. Spread on bread, it was like a meat jam :)I definitely want to come back. Service was excellent, and the ambiance was really nice.",,,
13,Reema P.,"Lexington, KY",65,33,69,5.0,7/23/2018,What lovely service! I called because I was unfamiliar with the townhome info restaurant concept and the hostess came out to find me in the rain! Was immediately seated as I came in as my table was held. The server made great recommendations ... helped me pick! The fried goat cheese a must! The Falafel jam packed with flavor! The Brussels sprouts had a nice balance of flavor ... wanted more apples in the dish! And the dessert butterscotch was light and the passion fruit was the fun flavor in it! Nice cocktails!,,,1
14,Esther S.,"Manhattan, NY",290,146,384,3.0,2/26/2018,"Cute place, but food is just mediocre. I was excited to try this place after reading all the positives reviews, but I did not have the same experience.The place looks small when you first walk in, the bar is right up front and the walkway to the back is narrow. However, once you get to the back it opens into a whole new room with 2 floors- my friend and I were seated upstairs which was a cool spot.They recommend 2-3 dishes per person so we ordered the following:1. Fried goat cheese w/ honey2. Brussels sprouts3. Lamb meatballs4. Grilled wild shrimp5. Braised short rib6. Ricotta gnocchiThe only memorable dishes were the brussels sprouts and shrimp. The fried goat cheese was fine, but nothing to rave about. The braised short rib was overcooked and dry...I couldn't even finish my piece and I love braised short rib!Server was very nice but he seemed to be rushing us out..the check came 2 seconds after we finished dessert and they kept coming back to clear our plates when we still had food on it.So many other places in NYC I'd rather dine at so I wouldn't come back.",1,,
15,Yinglu W.,"New York, NY",1,212,198,4.0,1/12/2018,"Pretty good place to chill out. I like the tapas style a lot, trying different things at once.We ordered salmon tartare, which has always been my fav appetizer, fried goat cheese and a focaccia roll. The second one was too sweet and the original flavor of cheese was destroyed.Drinks were lower than my expectation.The environment was very unique and interesting im general.",,,
16,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1478,4331,5.0,12/31/2017,Really fantastic food.

Coat check girl was a little out of it and took forever to retrieve our stuff but it's nice that they offer it. Definitely one of the best spots for tapas in NYC and WAY better than their sister restaurant Cata.,,,1
17,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, NY",202,201,22,4.0,9/1/2018,Alta is a beautiful little tapas bar in Greenwich village tucked away on a side street. Just perfect for a date night with delicious wine and small bites. The fried goat cheese balls with honey were the perfect compliment to a glass of rose. Would love to return!,,,1
18,Gisele Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",87,62,516,4.0,12/28/2017,"The way to do it here is try a variety of the plates and appetizers! Don't stick to one or two.Small yet delicious and exciting tastes. We did  octopus, artichoke and goat cheese and honey for appetizers and 2 types of pasta short ribs which is kinda sweet and scarritella sth ( I don't recall the name long one) which was a bit spicy but overall great experience",,,

21,Vanessa G.,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",12,51,18,5.0,6/3/2018,"An unforgettable tapas meal! Great dishes for everyone you know - they have pasta, red meat, poultry seafood and of course, paella! We ordered quite a few plates (we were really hungry) and left the restaurant super satisfied. Our server was amazingly helpful in advising us on what wines were the standouts on their extensive wine list that fell within the price we were looking to spend on a bottle. They were also accommodating with allergies - we asked for the paella without clams specifically and they said no problem. The decor and feel of the place reminds me of a tavern in Spain or Portugal. I suggest starting with the paella (it's filling) and then moving on to meat or seafood and veggies. We tried the lamb meatballs, pork empanadas, scallops, hen in the woods, falafel and cumin chicken wings. Delicious and really well crafted food. Pork empanadas were really good (and I grew up eating them so I have higher standards for them!) Can't wait to go back! Note this restaurant only accepts cash or American Express.",,,

23,Stacey T.,"New York, NY",152,143,152,4.0,12/5/2017,"I came here with a group of 8 for a friend's birthday and had a table in the back. From the outside you would never imagine that it was so expansive inside. They have the sub-ground level and I believe 2 levels above it. We ordered the ""whole shebang,"" which is the entire menu and wow was it impressive. My only criticism is that the food comes out SO fast that it seemed like a bit of a eating marathon. Initially we were brought several plates to start but then it seemed as if 3-4 more plates would come out every few minutes and we even ran out of space. Very exciting, but mildly overwhelming. We also had a few people with dietary restrictions and didn't always know what dish was what since they were brought out so fast. It would be nice if they offered pitchers of drinks for larger groups. We had sangria coming strong all night by the glass since they don't offer pitchers. The desserts were very unique and interesting. They were accommodating in providing a candle for the birthday girl. Looking forward to coming back and reordering a few menu highlights- brussel sprouts, lamb meatballs, short rib, empanada and some of the fish dishes to name a few.",,,
24,Deemy M.,"New York, NY",14,58,65,3.0,5/2/2018,"My boyfriend took me to Alta for my birthday, the restaurant is really lively with dim lighting and a nice romantic ambience. Walking into the restaurant from outside you would not expect how huge and open it actually is.The food at Alta was amazing. Every dish that was put in front of us was gone in less than 2 minutes.  Everything was packed with flavor, had depth and freshness. What we had:Brussels sprouts: 5/5 amazing! a must try, I don't know how they made the veggies so goodGrilled Shrimp and Chorizo: 4/5 also sooo good, and packed a punchMushroom flatbread: 3/5 this was good but just a typical flatbreadBlack truffle burrata: 4/5 really fresh, I mean it's a ball of cheese how can you go wrong thereSkirt steak: 4/5 cooked perfectly and so flavorfulDessert: Alta candy bar: 3/5 meh, it's just a fancy snickers bar, it was nice to try but I wouldn't order againOne big disappointment was that he told the waiter to bring the dessert with a candle to celebrate my birthday. The server completely forgot about it, brought the dessert without the candle and didn't apologize for it. Just found it odd since we went late and the place wasn't busy. That took away from the birthday experience.Overall a good place to try if you love tapas.",1,,
25,Sujoyee C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",39,71,1,1.0,7/26/2018,"Alta is one of the best rated restaurants in NYC and we decided to do dinner last week. We ordered 6-7 small plates as our server recommended and we were extremely disappointed. Let's start with the good things: 1. The ambience & the place : Gorgeous! A beautiful eatery tucked away behind quite a mysterious door. Absolutely beautiful! 2. The service: Point on! They were extremely nice and suggested us based on our preferences. 3. Drinks: We ordered the No.1 and the No.4 : Extremely disappointing! The drinks were bland and mine was rather bitter with too much alcohol. 4. Food: - The beer batter Spring onion : Again, sounded super fancy! Extremely bland. Something I'd happily never try again.- Black Truffle Burrata : The Black truffle was not infused rather decorated on top - which I found strange. - Mushroom Flatbread : Its very hard to get this wrong. Literally, very hard. Except, I doubt it had any cheese on it. It was mushed with too much mushroom. Totally bland again! We ended up cancelling rest of the 4 dishes and getting the check! Now, I could be the one without the right palate to enjoy this, and one could argue but bland is bland no matter which way you look!",2,,
26,Rebecca L.,"New York, NY",192,338,98,4.0,3/31/2018,"We celebrated my friend's birthday here on a Friday night. Our group of 12 ordered the ""whole shebang"" which is the entire menu (except desserts). Ordering the whole menu was a really great dining experience as there was a wide variety of items to sample- pasta, risotto, paella, seafood, brisket, lamb, etc. The whole shebang may seem expensive at $550 but really a pretty good deal when split. The amount of food was perfect, we were all stuffed by the end of the meal and could barely finish the last items. A few of the dishes were a bit of a miss (like the paella- too salty) but overall everything was delicious, flavorful, and unique. Many of the dishes were mushroom and cilantro heavy. I'd have to say the best item would have to have been the brisket and beet pasta. Although the place was very busy, service was attentive and the food came out quickly and nicely paced. The restaurant is a great spot for groups as it's very lively, energetic, and loud. The space is fairly large with two levels of seating but the tables are very close together. Alta is a great place for friends to catch up, enjoy wine, and share a meal. One thing to note: this place accepts Amex or cash only.",,,1

People ate with their coats on. I kid you not. I would have done the same except I coat checked like an idiot. So the food.  My taste buds jumped a couple of times but not throughout the whole dinner. We ordered the following: Goat cheese. DeliciousTruffle burrata. DeliciousFava bean falafel.  It was fine. Scallops.  Probably my favorite. Short rib   Hanger steak The steaks didnt do a thing for me.  I've had much better.  The two cocktails we had were fine and strong.

28,Wiley L.,"Fairfax, VA",0,2,0,4.0,11/11/2018,Had a fantastic dinner here. The tapas dishes come out very fast and are absolutely delicious. Theres a good range of the tapas and are a decent size for sharing. The service was wonderful. The only downfall was the sommelier who was not knowledgeable on the wines and could not distinguish between the roses and reds. We racked up quite a bill because the prices are on the hefty side. But the next time I am tempted to try the whole shebang which is 600.,,,

The building is really cute- our table was in a quiet room on the 3rd floor. Service was fantastic- friendly server made great recommendations. Be warned- it's cash and Amex only. We tried two cocktails at the bar, and though I didn't love them, they had a good wine by the glass list. Best to come with a group so you can sample as many of their fabulous small plates as possible. Here's what we were able to try...*Scallop carpaccio- fresh, light, delish*Fava bean falafel- not my fave, but still very good. Small balls, crispy on the outside, soft inside with just a bit of pickled cabbage*Trumpet mushrooms- This dish was beautiful! Mushrooms were larger than I expected and served with a light potato espuma (cheesey foam), almonds, and pesto drizzle- yum.*Brussels sprouts- generous portion of crispy cabbages sliced in half with a few green apples, pistachios, and a creme fraiche. So good*Roasted octopus- with chickpeas and a pretty lemon pearls. Also recommend*Linguini pepperoncini- small serving of perfectly cooked pasta in a rich, savory, slightly spicy sauce*Mushroom flatbread- loaded with earthy porcinis and savory with a fontina cheese sauceI was worried we wouldn't have enough cash for dessert, but figured it would be worth it to do a quick ATM run if needed. Dessert was also delish- light, creamy, chocolatey goodness.Cannot say enough how fab this place is. Beautiful presentation, great service, fab food. Highly recommend.",,,
33,Andrea C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,61,34,5.0,5/2/2018,"Wow I remember when I first came here when it opened, like 15 years later the food is still outstanding.  Tapas style you can't go wrong with any of the seafood dishes. The grilled shrimp & scallops are divine.  The carrot dish is unreal, they roast the carrots or must get their carrots from a farm with rich soil Bc it was like eating meat!  The paella was great and so was the bacon wrapped dates!  I thought the weakest dish was the fava bean falafel. Dessert is good too we had the strawberry cheesecake (very light in a cup).I guess the only criticism is the drinks were expensive and they served in small glasses with a lot of ice so I barely got much sips in before my drink was done. Had to be a bit of a critic and point it out to the bartender who adjusted accordingly after.The hostess was really nice!",,,

As for the food, the salmon tartare tasted mediocre and you can taste the truffle in it. The pan roasted sea scallops tasted the best out of the dishes I had. The Paella which is basically the seafood rice looked amazing from all the pictures on yelp, however it was extremely salty. It was so salty to a point that I needed to drink water after a few bites. As for the desserts, I prefer the warm chocolate fondente over the labne cheesecake. The chocolate fondente wasn't that sweet since they used dark chocolate. As for the labne cheesecake, it isn't the normal cheesecake we are used to since they use greek yogurt.",,,

40,Elyka A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",188,184,526,4.0,4/14/2017,"Came here for dinner with 2 girl friends and we got off on the wrong foot, but the manager made it up to us by offering us a free round of drinks.I won't bore you with the details but we had a mishap with the hostess and our table, it was nice of them to comp us a round though.As for the food:The Brussels sprouts are so good, just order them, you won't be disappointed.  They're sweet, crunchy and perfectly cooked. We ordered 2 because we liked them so much!Pardon Peppers. I didn't love these, they were a bit too spicy for my liking, and I'm not overly sensitive to spicy foods. The fried cheese was delicious.The fluke, also very good.  The foie gras was very smooth, I enjoyed it a lot.Overall the price is right and food is good.",2,1,1
41,Sonal B.,"New York, NY",55,170,20,4.0,4/22/2018,"Great food, service and ambience. But you better have a reservation for a quiet day because just in case you are having a good time and decide to extend your stay there, they will come and kick you out since they are expecting to turn tables more than once every eve.",1,2,1
42,Aradhana D.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",2,16,0,5.0,10/28/2018,"Soooo delicious. Every item our table ordered was amazing.

The fried goat cheese, the scallops, and the duck confit are all the flavors I was able to enjoy during this visit. Must try!!",,,
44,Jessica H.,"New York, NY",103,79,341,5.0,5/20/2017,"It's a superb tapas place while combining features of modern American cuisine. I enjoyed every bite of my dishes here - highly recommend Alta as a great hang out place with friends. I was satisfied with every dish I ordered. They all turned out to be higher than expectation. Ricotta Gnochi, which is the poached egg with bacon and black pepper, tastes so nice! I almost finished it in one bite, and did not want to leave even a small piece on the plate. Another of my favorite was the Paella, always the must-have at a Spanish restaurant. The Paella is so special, compared to so many other Paella place. The seafood placed in the Paella was so fresh and delicious! We also ordered the sea scallop, tomato toast, and grilled hanger steak. I have expect good food here, but they all turn out to be beyond perfect, surprising me with every taste:) The final highlight of our meal here was the pear tarte! It's sweet however not too much. Should definitely have a try for this one!The experience here at Alta was very good, giving me a spectacular experience for Spanish food with modern American features. However the portion for each dish is not that much. For two people, it's better to order around six dishes not including the dessert. It's one of the best Spanish restaurant I've encountered in the city. Hooray!",,,
45,Allene T.,"Manhattan, NY",2142,1291,3204,5.0,2/27/2017,"I'm not sure how I had never heard of this place until recently, but I'm definitely glad to have visited.  Alta is located on the south side of 10th St off 6th Avenue and doesn't really have a real sign, so you'll likely walk right past it the first time around.  I booked a company dinner for 16 people here and we were seated comfortably.I loved the atmosphere at Alta - it was busy, but not too crazy loud, and the lighting and overall mood was perfect for a Thursday evening dinner.  The ambience here would be perfect for a date.  We had pretty much one waiter for our entire party the whole night, but he managed it pretty well, I must say.  They have some signature drinks here that are numbered - most of our table got the #6.  They also have a selection of craft beers available as well.I was fortunate enough to order the ""shebang"" - basically the entire menu, for $520.  We also ordered all of the desserts.  I counted, and that's literally 45 dishes or so that we ordered - twice.  For a group of 16, 2 of the shebang fed us well.  I can't say I've ever tried so many dishes in one sitting before - this was even better than a tasting menu!  I would definitely suggest ordering everything on the menu if your part is large enough - I did the calculations and you save a few dollars.Obviously, we tried way too many dishes for me to describe them all here, but the few that stood out for me and my colleagues were the following, which we decided were ""must get"":- Fried goat cheese and honey- Short rib + beet noodles- Foie gras- Fried hen of the woods (a mushroom)- BRUSSEL SPROUTS (everyone was raving about these Brussel sprouts - they come in close competition with the Brussel sprouts at L'Artusi)- Paella- Mushroom flatbread (but it smells funky)- Lamb tagine- Black truffle burrata- Lamb meatballsFor dessert, we tried them all.  However, what really got us going was the apple fritter ice cream sundae thing.  SO GOOD we ordered more.  You have to get this!  Everything else (labne cheesecake, chocolate cake, baked Alaska, trio or sorbets)  is nothing compared to the apple fritter.For a tapas place, Alta gets 5 stars in my book for having a massive, diverse menu that anyone can enjoy.  Having tried the entire menu, I'd say I only didn't like the pork belly.  Everything else was delicious and it was topped off nicely by a delicious dessert.",7,1,3
46,Katie H.,"New York, NY",354,203,100,5.0,4/14/2018,"This place is a 4.5, but I will round up to a 5. Came here with a group of three people and we ordered 10 different things. I will list everything down below and rate the dish (1-5).-Bacon wrapped dates ($7): 4 stars, classic, no surprises here-fava bean falafel ($12): 2 stars, probably my least favorite thing we ordered...the falfel was soft and squishy and didn't have much flavor-roasted beets ($13): 4 stars-brussel sprouts ($13): 5 stars, we got two orders of these. I really enjoyed the creamy sauce that was drizzled over the top of the brussels & they were perfectly cooked in my opinion-grilled wild shrimp ($16): 4 stars-seared sea scallops ($20): 3 stars, the scallops were cooked well, but I thought they were a little too salty and did not have much depth in flavor-octopus a la plancha ($20): 5 stars, quite possibly my favorite dish of the night. the octopus was perfectly prepared-- the outside was crispy and the inside was soft...no rubbery texture -ricotta gnocchi ($17): 3 stars, I've had better gnocchi in the city, but I guess this isn't an italian restaurant that specializes in pasta-braised short rib ($24): 3 stars, this was a dish the waiter said was a ""must have""...I thought that the meat was flavorless. the beet infused pasta, however was extremely flavorful and was one of my favorite things I tasted tonightOverall, the quality of ingredients was great and most everything was well prepared. I thought the service was good, but not amazing and the ambiance of the restaurant was sophisticated, but not stuffy. I wish some of the flavors were punchier and more unique; however, I think if you avoid some of the dishes above that I thought were mediocre, you will enjoy your time here at Alta!",1,,
47,Khusbu P.,"New York, NY",188,174,350,5.0,4/12/2017,"Omg- this just got added to my list of fav restaurants in the city. I wanted to dine at Alta for the longest time and I was finally able to go on Saturday night!! Best night ever!!  Remember that Alta only accepts cash and one type of credit card (American Express?). There's an ATM right around the corner if you forget to bring cash- we forgot to bring cash haha. One dish that you must order would have to be the BRUSSEL SPROUTS!! I'm not one to rave about brussel sprouts but writing about it is making me drool. So so so good. The risotto, fried goat cheese, and hen of the woods were also amazing! Alta is the most perfect spot for dates and when grabbing dinner with friends. The ambiance is cozy and romantic but still loud at the same time which is why it's a fun place to celebrate birthdays and get together with friends. There's balcony seating as well which I loved! Go eat at Alta right now!!",1,,
48,Luc B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,15,7,2.0,7/20/2018,I was really looking forward to eating here. I really loved the decor but on entering the entire restaurant was an ice box. I know it's hot out but really it should not be uncomfortable. Our server said they were expecting full capacity that night. It's a shame because we cut our dinner short and couldn't get to try the paella or short ribs. I understand that the kitchen must be very efficient but we felt like we were being pushed out. The dishes came out so fast that we barely had time to enjoy any of them . We felt like they wanted the tables to turn over fast and not give the guests time to linger. What a shame because we had already spent $300 and could have spent more,2,,
49,Hadas H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",21,8,7,5.0,10/4/2017,Best place ever!We ordered 4 dishes and a desert.The food was perfection and amazingly delicious.

51,Doreen L.,"Queens, NY",1187,990,6587,3.0,1/15/2017,"Alta is a very romantic restaurant nestled in a West village townhouse. The service is excellent, the setting is cozy, candlelit and reminds me of Spanish balconies and open spaces. The food quality varies, depending on what you order. Alta was on my list of restaurants to try for a long time. I wanted to get a group of 6-8 to try the whole Shebang (everything on the menu for $520). But I was happy to try the restaurant first.  For a Friday date night, we had a group of 4 selecting 7 items off the menu. We ordered the tuna tartare, lamb tagine, black truffle burrata, Hudson valley camembert, fried hen of the woods, PEI mussels with lobster broth, and grilled octopus. The best dish was the soft gooey savory aromatic burrata. The grilled octopus was perfectly grilled but very very small (one tentacle). The other small plates were good but not mind- blowing. I would suggest your order 2 dishes per person because two of us left the restaurant a little hungry. We went for dessert and drinks afterwards. Then pizza.",12,4,5
52,Melanie G.,"Manhattan, NY",133,110,29,4.0,7/31/2017,"If you like charming, dimly-lit rooms, tapas, and want to impress someone, you might want to check out Alta. If none of the three apply to you, then you might want to spend your hard-earned cash somewhere else. This place is delicious, cozy, and super cute, but PRICEY for what it's worth. It's also kinda loud and hard to hear what your date is saying (so maybe not the most romantic setting for a first date but if you're 4 months in and still want to impress her - do check this place out! hah) ALSO, IMPT: They only take AMEX and cash. Hope you've been rolling in the dough recently. The restaurant is located in a picturesque townhouse in the West Village and claims to only buy from local growers and other trusted purveyors. They recommend 2-3 tapas per person and plates range from $10-20 each so things add up. The food's remarkably tasty!!! And you can choose from a wide variety of meats, seafood and vegetables with a Mediterranean flair.  We ordered: Octopus a la plancha - grilled octopus with toasted chickpeas and a green cilantro sauce. Not sure if it was worth $18 but it was a large piece of octopus! I like the chickpeas-octopus-green sauce comboMushroom flatbread - dry and pretty blandBraised short rib - HIGHLY RECOMMEND. If you get anything here, get the braised short rib pasta. The dish is a huge piece of tender short rib above a delicious and unique beet infused pappardelle pasta. THE BEET INFUSED PASTA WAS AMAZING. Think this was my favorite dish of the night. Fried goat cheese - This was highly recommended by Yelpers but I didn't think it was too special. The wild lavender honey tasted delicious with the cheese (Why is every restaurant super into lavender honey these days!??!) but I'm not quite sure how I feel about fried goat cheese. They also have a pretty unique cocktail list! The bartenders were super friendly with suggestions and the like. :) TDLR: Nice ambiance, interesting dishes, GET THE BRAISED SHORT RIB, very pricey, AMEX AND CASH ONLY",2,1,

55,Katie P.,"Manhattan, NY",288,15,1,3.0,8/13/2018,"5 Stars for the vaulted ceiling and ambiance of this romantic venue, but 2 stars for the actual food (from a vegetarian's perspective).  I ended up getting served fish (on accident) and it just ruined my meal.  I found the dishes to be innovative but not that exciting from a taste perspective.  They do have a fantastic wine list, though!  It would be a fun place to celebrate an anniversary if you have no dietary restrictions and are willing to spend a significant amount of money on small plates.  I wouldn't return personally.",,,

60,Kaitlin F.,"Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, NY",179,97,26,4.0,8/13/2017,"Alta was a really great find in the West Village. I was looking for a classy happy hour spot, and it definitely delivered. Walking in, it looks like a small intimate restaurant with a bar. When you head back, you see how large the space really is. It is also just really adorable from the outside - cute lights and vines down the brick building.When sitting at the bar, you can participate in happy hour. The happy hour deal for wine and tapas is really hard to beat. $8 wine, $16 for 2 small plates. Honestly a steal for the quality of wine and food you get! I tried the lamb meatballs and the shrimp. My friend got the empanadas as well. All of the dishes were really great and very tasty. The portions were also pretty large for tapas. Service at the bar was good, but not stellar. Obviously, during a happy hour, that is understandable. We had to get the bartenders' attention a few times to put in our orders and to close out. However, overall, fine service.I would definitely love to try Alta for a full meal as well in the near future. But the happy hour really is great!",,,
61,Nancy W.,"New York, NY",556,27,5,3.0,3/1/2018,"3.5: 5 stars for the ambience and 3 stars for the food. My party of two was able to get seated immediately at 7 on a Friday night without a reservation, which is rare but I highly recommend getting here earlier because the restaurant was nearly empty before 7 and got exponentially more crowded after 7. It's a perfect spot to catch up with a friend, take a date, or come with family.The food was fairly underwhelming and not too warm, as if they had been sitting out for awhile. Most items tasted pre-made and heated up before placing on a plate with fantastic decoration to cover it up. Between the two of us we ordered:1. Housemade parker rolls (garlic rolls with butter): this was the worst of the items we ordered. The rolls tasted like stale old bread that you microwave for a few seconds too long in the microwave and it comes out crusty and hard. The only flavor came from the garlic. 2. Roasted beets: this was one of my personal favorites, though my friend found it underwhelming. The beets were probably nothing special but I loved the goat cheese panna cotta and can't stop thinking about it, and it definitely pulled the plate together.3. ""Paella"": this was another one of my favorites because it was actually warm and tasted like it was freshly cooked. The seafood and chorizo in this was generous. Of course it doesn't taste like actual Spanish paella if that's what you're looking for, but it was flavorful. It was one of the largest portion among the dishes we tried and enough for a person as a standalone dish if you have issues against sharing (but this is 100% a sharing place!).4. Ricotta gnocchi: I liked the texture of the gnocchi but I didn't find the dish too flavorful. It wasn't memorable at all.5. Lamb tagine: this was fantastic relative to most of the other dishes we ordered, but again, nothing like actual tagine. The lamb was generous and the overall dish was good, but not something that stood out either.Overall, there is not a single item of the ones we ordered that I would order again. Would I come back and try other items on the menu just for the ambience? Sure.",,,

I'm just visiting, and unfortunately didn't have anyone to join me so I could order more dishes.   This restaurant would also make for a very nice date night, or a special weekday dinner with your Mom. I tried the house red wine (which was surprisingly complex and tasty) and the eggplant, tomato, breadcrumb cavatelli. The eggplant was rich and creamy, and the dish had just the right amount of spice. So good!",,,
63,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,11/7/2016,"It's been over a year since I had a fabulous birthday dinner at Cata, Alta's sister restaurant. My experience there was all kinds of wonderful and I still remember--quite vividly, in fact--a number of the dishes I tried there. Yet somehow, Alta--the older of the two restaurants--had grown stale on my ever-growing restaurant bookmarks. Newer, less-reviewed spots kept shooting up to the top, and Alta became more and more neglected. Thankfully, I can say with great joy that Alta has finally been checked off. Though a different vibe than Cata, the execution at Alta is just as, if not more, stellar than its sister spot. The food here is creative, varied, beautiful, well-balanced and delicious. And the space itself is remarkable in its own right!Perhaps one of the reasons I forgot about Alta is its concealment. Despite being in a popular area, Alta is hidden on a predominately residential block. A bit of searching is involved. But once you've entered, you know you've arrived at the right place. The space itself seems like a flipped apartment building: three floors connected by two old-school, narrow, carpet-clad staircases. While the first two floors are a bit more like Cata (""hip"", dark), the third floor feels more like the living room of your most treasured relative. This is the floor we happened to dine on. While I still somewhat wish we were seated elsewhere (I enjoy dark lighting, despite it not doing much for food photos), the third floor is cozy and intriguing. And somehow, the service was efficient despite the sheer size of the venue. The one underwhelming area (I'm getting it out of the way first) for me was the cocktail menu here. Whereas Cata has a separate cocktail menu *just* for G&Ts (my favorite drink, so I got lucky there), the Alta menu is more austere. Not many options, nothing too notable. The one highlight for me was the Lavender Collins, which is a refreshing gin drink perfect for getting the night started. My advice is to start out with a lighter cocktail if you're in the mood for liquor, then switch to wine (in contrast, *great* wine selection here) once the food starts to arrive.The food menu at Alta is vast. I always have a difficult time choosing at tapas spots, but this menu was particularly heart-wrenching. Everything just looked superb, and judging from what we did ultimately order, it probably was/is. There's something for everyone here: seafood, veggies, tartares/crudos, meats, cured dishes, grains. Important note: AMEX AND CASH ONLY. BS, in my opinion, but it's excusable. Excellent Eats, below:Grilled Octopus w/ blistered beans, kalamata olive celery salad: AI'm spoiled when it comes to octopus, which means I also have high standards. This yummy tentacle was definitely up there with some of the better preparations I've had. Cooked perfectly, crispy skin, very flavorful. The salad beneath has a few extra hidden pieces of meat in there, for when you start to lament the dish's conclusion.Salmon Tartare w/ truffle, black rice crisp, salmon roe: A+There's something about tartare. I can't get enough of it, and it's plates like this that keep me consuming a questionable amount of raw fish. Simple, delicate, delectable and beautifully presented. The salmon roe on top felt downright luxurious. If you can, try to eat each crisp in multiple bites. Crispy Okra Salad w/ heirloom tomato, cucumber, vadouvan, basil: A-Peculiar dish for a tapas restaurant, but I'm not complaining. We order brussels sprouts almost every time we dine out, so we decided to opt for the okra as our veggie. Didn't blow me away but it was more than solid. Fantastic flavors and textures and a great interlude before diving back into more meat.Spanish Mackerel in Saor w/ currants, pine nuts, clove, spanish onion: AI was hesitant about ordering a cured dish here given the wide array of other choices, but I'm wholly satisfied with this decision. Each bite was solid and complex with tons of flavor. Tasteful, aesthetically pleasing and a nice change of pace from what I'm used to ordering out.Porcini-Braised Short Rib w/ spelt pasta, beet puree, horseradish: A+I'm glad we got to devour this towards the end of our night at Alta because I hope to remember it for days and weeks and years to come. Melt-in-your-mouth good. And for a red meat dish, all components were refreshingly healthy. The flavors here worked together in the most harmonious of harmonies, if there is such a superlative. The perfect amount of horseradish, which can be difficult to execute.Bacon-Wrapped Dates largueta almonds: A+++Usually one receives bacon-wrapped dates at the beginning of a meal, so we started to worry at a certain point that our order had been forgotten. But thank god we received it last, because these were no question the best bacon-wrapped dates I've ever consumed. The almonds in the center were *the* most pleasant of surprises. We didn't need dessert after these: pure indulgence.",8,3,7
64,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,5.0,10/19/2016,"Similar to its sister Cata, Alta also features a down-to-earth type of tapas, with a tilt towards modern American type of cuisine. I really should say that I have enjoyed every single bite of my dishes - everything was provided flawless! So my friends and I came for our school reunion. Decided to try a bit of this and that, we went for the fried goat cheese balls and grilled shrimps as app, the cured mackerel and paella as main dishes, and eventually the pear tart as dessert. Definitely their paella was among the top three in the city - especially for a seafood lover like me as the bowl contains about 85% seafood and only 15% rice. The mussels and clams were also giant in size and have completely absorbed the broth base, well executed!  I would recommend getting the pear tart as well - the combo of pear and tart was just that good, that you would never want to miss it!If I had to name one short-coming, accepting AMex or cash was probably the only one, causing lots of inconvenience. Yet I should fairly say that food here was in general of higher quality and the speed turned out to be relatively fast. Do yourself a favor and get the lavender gin cocktail, and thank me later! Very refresh while still carried a light touch of flora.Loved this place, suitable for all purposes.",11,8,11

The vibe is even cozier than Cata, with dim lighting and a multi-story seating plan with lots of cool balconies. Because we were in a group, we ordered the Whole Shebang, which is literally one of every dish on the menu. Major standouts include the fried goat cheese, bacon wrapped dates, mesclun salad, grilled eggplant and grilled radicchio and the octopus and pork belly. I probably wouldn't do the whole shebang again just because I like having seconds but it's a good way to get the breadth of experience. Either way - great under-the-radar west village option with lots of hygge.",2,2,2
66,Andi C.,"Austin, TX",131,56,19,4.0,1/3/2018,"Fantastic little spot in a redone home in Greenwich Village. The location has charming little corners but the center is grand and open. We had reservations, but had to wait a little for a seat, which we were then taken to the 3rd floor, in a smallish room with 5 or so other tables, kind of away from the hustle and bustle, which was fine for a date night. We ordered a few tapas, from the octopus to the eggplant . All of these tasted pretty good, though not remarkable or extraordinary. That is, until the star of the lineup was served to us- the braised short rib with beet pasta. This, you must order. Service was great, and our bottle of wine complimented our food nicely (a Ribero del Duero blend). If I were to return, I'd be interested in giving their pork belly and paella a try, and would also like to sit in the more active areas of the restaurant.",,1,

68,Amrita A.,"New York, NY",180,220,726,3.0,4/27/2017,"Came here for dinner with my hubby and we both were craving tapas style food. While the ambience of this place is just right for an intimate, cozy and not-so-quiet dinner, the food wasn't exactly spectacular. We have been to a few great tapas places and this wasn't up there for us. Alta has a small little ""rabbit hole"" entrance but is actually pretty big on the inside with two floors of seating and if you're dining on the first level you can actually look down onto the diners below which makes for a wonderful and different visual. It's dim lit and has a cool vibe.I got the red wine sangria which was probably the biggest glass of sangria i have ever had in a restaurant (definitely a winner for me ;) and my husband got a whiskey cocktail with citrus notes( forgetting the name) which also very good.For food we ordered the following-Brussel sprouts (with granny smiths , creme fraiche and pistachios) - totally worth the hype and a must get.Burrata (with truffle oil , crispy garlic and dressed greens)- a very good dish but having said that I have never had a bad burrata in any restaurant .Shrimps with chorizo- the shrimps were a little tough and the dish itself was nothing greatSeafood paella with squid ink- a really well made paella with a good seafood to rice ratio. Loved this dish.For dessert we got the apple fritter ice cream which was very average and totally avoidable. This is one big reason why i took off two stars. With two drinks , 4 main dishes and a dessert our damage was $116 not including tip which was pretty pricey given the quantity and quality of food.",3,2,2

As an example, in my mussels, there were maybe a dozen or fifteen mussels and lots of sauce and (very good) bread. So you have to fill up by eating a lot of bread dipped in sauce. Not bad, but not very good for the price they charge. And it's the first place I ever have been told that they only serve margaritas on the rocks - and there were sure a lot of rocks!Bottom line: the price-value relationship is out of line. We have definitely had better for less.",2,,

72,Natalie J.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,187,2,4.0,5/9/2017,"I'll start this review by saying that I'm awarding four stars purely based on ambience and food.  I've experienced tapas and pintxos all over different parts of Spain, so it's hard not to complain about how gosh-darned expensive and non-casual tapas and small-plates are in the U.S.  This review does not reflect the fact that Alta was particularly crazy in that regard--for the total bill on our dinner, we could have sent the birthday boy to Spain with a little bit of spending money leftover (I wish I were kidding).Eight people, and most of the party settled on doing ""the whole shebang,"" so I swallowed my misgivings and went along with it because birthday.  So yes, we sampled--emphasis on the ""sampled,"" as we each had approximately one bite of everything--all 44 dishes, and I have to say that each and every one of the 44 tasted so amazing that I had a hard time narrowing down my favorites.  I guess I'd say the blistered peppers, brussels sprouts, beets, all of the seafood, and the roasted pork belly.  The group also decided to add on the desserts--all very good but nothing remarkable.  The quality definitely went a long way toward lessening the sticker shock--I can't even begin to imagine how mopey I'd have been if I'd paid that much for crummy food.Once dinner started, the food kept on coming.  Toward the end, when we realized we had missed some of the dishes, our server arranged for the missing items to come quickly.  He was a little obnoxious giving the hard sell on dessert but not egregiously so.  Overall, given how hard it was for me to look back and distinguish much of what I had beyond the fact that I remembered it was all good, I think I'd prefer to stick to a couple of items from each category with a smaller group next time.  I doubt there will be a next time (but I guess one never can say never).  Delicious but just not worth it.",1,1,1

I'd definitely recommend this for dinner with friends, family or a date. Ambience: Really liked the ambience of this place. Very cozy two-story restaurant! Service: Food came out fairly quickly and waitstaff was friendly and attentive. A bit annoying that it is cash and AmEx only. Food: Portion sizes were fair and a bit larger than I anticipated. Trumpet Mushroom - great! The potato foam was light yet rich! Lamb meatballs - very good but nothing too memorable. Brussel sprouts - roasted cabbages with creme fraiche, they were definitely the best brussels sprouts I have ever had! Drinks: Cocktail No. 4. - a bit too strong for my taste (all I could taste was the gin), but still pretty good nonetheless.",,,1

76,Mel T.,"New York, NY",414,1210,2866,2.0,9/20/2016,"A group of girlfriends and I came to Alta on a Friday night at around 7 to celebrate one of the girls' birthdays. A few of us arrived early, so we decided to take advantage of their happy hour by the bar ($8 house red/white wine).When we were seated, we started browsing the menu and a lot of things popped out at us. Here are some of the things we ordered:Salmon tartare (truffle, black rice crisp, salmon roe) - this was probably the best one. The salmon tasted fresh and the black rice crisp complemented the fish well. However, none of us were expecting the portion to be so tiny. It was three bite-sized rice crackers with salmon. But it was so good that we ended up ordering secondsPEI mussels (harissa broth, preserved lemon, cilantro) - nothing special. I feel like I can probably make this at home. Seems and tastes simple enoughPaella (crispy saffron rice, mussels, clams, shrimp, chorizo) - it didn't have as much flavor as I'd expect a paella to have. Also, the rice was a bit mushyLamb meatballs (charred red pepper sauce, labne) - this was on the dry sidePorcini braised short ribs (spelt pasta, beet puree, horseradish) - didn't try the short ribs but the pappardelle or whatever sheets of pasta it came with was pretty goodFoie gras terrine (smoked eel, plum mostarda) - this was my first time trying foie gras. I got it mixed up with pate so my taste buds were definitely surprised upon that first bite. I don't think I like foie gras - too fatty for meRoasted pork belly (charmoula, lollipop kale, garnet yam) - had this weird leftover taste to it. You'd be better off grabbing some from Chinatown - half the price, double the flavor, triple the portionIf you're looking to have a full and satisfying meal, Alta is not it. But if you're looking to try a bit of everything (and you're in the mood to splurge, because these dishes add up QUICK) then maybe you'll like this place. Just expect the dishes to be hit or miss.Tip - cash or Amex only",2,,
77,Ella And Jonathan Z.,"New York, NY",24,12,4,2.0,2/17/2018,"We were very looking forward to coming because the menu looks amazing but the whole visit was disappointing. The food came out so fast we couldn't believe it! We got an appetizer even before  we got our drink. The blooming mushroom was kind of rough. Didn't taste so good. Dates were just ok. Burrata was also pretty chewy, and we eat burrata all the time.  Tiny bread basket that's extra $. No other bread offered. Paella was not good as well, barely any rice. The Tina tartar was so weird. That's an item that's hard go screw up but they managed to. The only good thing was the dessert, the candy bar. Delicious. Service was just blah. The waitress seemed new. And them not excepting Visa is so weird. Also, the food presentation and playing could be so much better.",,,

I'd skip the paella if I went again.",,,1
80,Lena K.,"Los Angeles, CA",610,15,8,5.0,6/18/2018,"Food here is a 5. We ordered the lamb meatballs, seafood paella, lamb tagine, grilled eggplant, bread naan, and hen in the woods mushrooms. Everything was absolutely delicious, especially the lamb dishes. Service was ok (they messed up an order which was annoying), but food makes up for it. Also pretty ambience, I would recommend sitting on the top floor so you can look down on the candle lit chandelier",,,
81,Rose K.,"New York, NY",397,452,591,5.0,3/28/2017,"Alta, you are my ideal date. Unassuming appearance from the outside, kind of shy and hidden at first. But upon walking in, you open up into that perfect warm kind of light. Just cozy and intimate enough, but not so that you're elbow-deep in other chilly New Yorkers. Rustic decor, and a romantic upstairs seating area. Your menu is inventive and playful, yet when the food comes out you demand to be taken seriously. A side of beet-infused pasta with the braised short rib makes me think I'm being healthy. A crispy-rice-cake take on ""paella"" leaves me wanting more, and the octopus a la plancha is tenta-lizing (if you know what I mean). The service? I couldn't be happier. Your server Colin geeked out with me about theatre tunes, he's even played all my favorite characters in musicals. You certainly know exactly what I like. Was it love at first sight? Ladies don't kiss and tell. But how do you know I'll be back? Because you know how to tease with that fine print at the bottom: ""THE WHOLE SHEBANG: 520."" It's like you're daring me. Don't worry, I'll be back to take all of you. I might even have to bring more friends for you to meet. Was it good for you? It was good for me.",3,2,3

Because we all know amex charges the highest interchange and if you're good going to accept that you may as well take visa and MC or post on your front door cash or amex only.

86,Alejandro H.,"Manhattan, NY",16,56,0,3.0,10/23/2017,Cash or AMEX ONLY.Food was good but overly hyped and priced. I had better food for lesser but you're paying for the lovely atmosphere and well decorated environment.Unfortunately I cannot give more than 3 stars due to the poor service that we had to endure. There was one rude waiter  who was bringing out the food and slamming it on the table. We had a large party and the waiter was frustrated about who the order belonged to so he started slamming the plates on the table and not telling us what it was. Also I literally had one glass of water through my 1-2 hour dining experience. I asked for water three times and never received it. Might have been a busy day but no excuse for a pricey restaurant. I recommend this place for its food if you want to spend.,1,,

88,Arthur C.,"Manhattan, NY",408,236,30,5.0,2/27/2017,"Alta was one of the most self-indulgent culinary experiences I have ever had. Guess that's what happens when you order the whole menu.I had dinner at Alta for a company event with a party of 15. As a result, the easiest option for the group was to choose the cheekily named ""The Whole Shebang"" option, wherein you order all 40 items on the menu. So we did exactly that, times two. As a result, I like to think this review will have a rather complete idea of what to get at Alta.In no particular order, the highlights were: fried goat cheese, brussels sprouts, fried hen of the woods, roasted royal trumpet, pork empanadas, braised short rib, and foie gras torchon. Three or four of those dishes combined should make for a delicious dinner for two.But when there are highlights, there are lowlights, if only in relativity. Those would be (again, no order): tomato braised rabbit, roasted pork belly (dry!), and Spanish olives. On their own merit none were terrible, but simply not at the same level as the rest of the - ahem - 40 dishes.The whole shebang was obviously followed by an order of each dessert. Yes, I tried them all once again, and the walnut rosehip sundae was hands down the winner: decadent yet airy. The winter sorbets crammed in some cool flavors as well, especially the cassis (blackcurrant). As with all tapas places, you always feel like you want to eat everything on the menu. Alta is no exception, save the fact that you can have everything. With excellent service and a solid drink service, there really is no reason not to come. Just bring some friends with you.",3,4,3
89,LauRawr S.,"Astoria, NY",105,4,2,4.0,4/23/2018,Everything was absolutely delicious. I will be coming here again. It's layout makes it a Perfect date spot with its cozy feel & yet it is also perfect for big parties as the place just seems to never end with more than one floor. I felt like I had stepped into a Spanish hacienda. I ate at the bar with my friend. Please be aware that it is cash or Amex only. This is the only reason for the four star.,1,,

The small town house entrance leads into a large restaurant with several floors and sections. We were on the second floor with a balcony looking into the first. Apparently there are 3 floors! The decor was dark and sexy. The service was nice but a bit slow...On to the food! Large menu with options segmented by raw, fish, meats, etc. A good mix with something for everyone. The standouts were-Brussels sprouts - I always order these but they were spectacular at this restaurant! Savory and flavorful and crunch with pistachios. We took off the creme fraiche but still excellent.-Mussels - plump PEI mussels in lobster broth. Yum!-Mushroom flatbread with truffles. Perfectly portionedThe fluke ceviche and fava bean falafel were ok but not especially memorable.Overall a great place and one to add to the restaurant rotation!",,,

95,Betty Ming L.,"Westchester County, NY",60,357,42,4.0,3/4/2017,"A bit pricey but a lovely spot for a special dinner. I asked for a quiet, romantic table-for-two where we could hear ourselves talk. We were seated upstairs on the balcony, looking down at the dining room. This is a GREAT location. Ask for it.As for the food, we ordered six tapas that were served in groups of two -- making three courses. And then, two desserts. With two glasses of wine, one coffee and one tea, the tab came to $162 before the well-deserved tip for the attentive server. (Note: There's no decaf coffee.)The waiter had suggested four-to-six tapas. If I were to go again, I think four would've been plenty. Most of the dishes were in the $12-$13 range. The two pork tapas were the most expensive and were unexceptional. In fact, I would never order the $18 pork belly again. We were hoping for something melt-in-your-mouth. But the meat was stuck to the top of a chunk of something hard and chewy. The short rib tapas was huge and the meat was tasty -- but not worth $23!So if I were to go again, these are the savory plates I would order: Our three favorites were the brussel sprouts, roasted beets and salmon tartare, each $13. Roasted royal trumpet ($14) made for interesting mushrooms with a potato foam (a light sauce). The sundae and baked Alaska ($12 each) were very sweet but pretty and enjoyable. As for payment -- Alta only takes cash and Amex.",1,,2
96,Phyllis K.,"New York, NY",44,22,28,5.0,6/25/2017,"Went there for a date. The place is hidden in the street and kinda hard to find. No sign outside. But gives a vibe of intimacy and special ambiance.The menu is really inclusive, from veggie to meat to seafood. It's all small dishes and the waiter recommended that we order 5/6 plates for two people. Good for people want to taste more things.Tried foie grad and salmon tarte, the classic, very special.Also tried fried goat cheese dipped in honey, very good.I liked the braised ribs most, very smooth and tender, paired with noodles, soaked in gravy and have an orange scent.The seafood paella is very good, more like a seafood stew than paella because there is more seafood than rice which is good.Very fresh and seasoned to the right point.Wine list is mostly from Spain so I have no idea what to order but it turned out fine.Not very crowded on a Friday night.A little expensive if u were to go all out for wine and dessert. Overall I would recommend it for date night and friends hangout.",,,

Overpriced.I love tapas and small plate locales - been to plenty in the city and know to never expect a full plate. However, I know by comparison that some of the plates here are half the size of similar restaurants, but priced the same if not higher. Our group of 6 spent quite a fair amount (upwards of $70pp) and I when I left I still felt the need to go and grab a slice of pizza. Incredibly disappointing. Sort of felt like a jerk since I was the one who picked the restaurant for the group.Oh, and cash/AMEX only??? The savings on CC transactions clearly don't make their way down to the guests.",4,1,

Was definitely a fan of the paella, roasted pork belly, and salmon tartare. The other items were not bad either, but did not stand out from the pack.

A bit hard to find since the building# nor the name of the place was visible at all out front but once you do find the right door, the interiors is so inviting and beautiful. 2 levels of seating and they didn't do the ""let's just cram as many tables as possible"" thing either which I appreciate a lot. We ordered 2 rounds of tapas for 4 ppl but ordered 5 orders of their goat cheese croquettes with lavender honey because they were THAT amazing. Other stand outs are the crispy skin black sea bass, the naturally sweet roasted Brussel sprouts, refreshing beet salad, the fall off the bone short rib, creamy Burrata ""dip"" and the delicious Paella topped with what I think was a dollop of some squid ink concoction and fresh seafood. I LOVE their order everything on the menu option for $450!!!!! Especially if we were dining with a good sized group I think this would have been perfect!

We requested a table on the 2nd floor on the balcony, and it was absolutely perfect. The ambiance is romantic and just beautiful, perfect for a date night. On top of that, the service and food were excellent. Jordan, our server, was the perfect mix of helpful and non-intrusive. He also spaced out the meal perfectly since we ordered about 7 dishes to split. Food: - Fried goat cheese - excellent and perfectly fried but really what made this meal fantastic was the lavender honey. - Philadelphia surprise - I'm not a huge fan of fried wontons but my husband said it was good. The least favorite dish of ours- scallops - scallops were perfectly cooked and the peas and sauce were delicious accompaniments. - burrata with black truffle - delicious and creamy.- ricotta gnocchi - this was one of the best gnocchi's I've ever had (I even had gnocchi in Italy) the bacon with the sauce and poached egg made the gnocchi even more sumptuous. Highly recommend this. - short rib - our favorite dish of the night. Short rib was tender but the real hit was the beet pasta served with it. When eating everything together, there was a meaty and Unami taste that just wowed our taste buds. We also had beers and red sangria, both good! Ended the meal with the Alta does Candy Bar dessert with was tasty and decadent. Highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back again!!!",,,

The veggie dishes (asparagus, burrata w/ greens) my friend and I shared were wonderful and tasty but the meats (chicken wings and steak) were less flavorful or interesting - hence the so-so rating.The staff was very friendly and tentative but they only accept CASH OR AMEX and didn't give us any notice of this until the bill came. We ended up having to find an ATM and get cash out to pay which really isn't ideal.

I was told that they won't accept credit cards over the phone and I would have to fill out a CC authorization form.So I give the guy my email address and 20 minutes later I still haven't received it. I call the restaurant and they say they're sorry but they're about to send it. 15 minutes later, still nothing.I call again and they say they sent it. I ask them to repeat my email address back to me and of course they had it wrong despite the fact that I read it back to them letter by letter the first time.So I repeat the address to them again and we hang up. 5 minutes later I get the email but no attachment. I call back AGAIN to let them know.A person whom I can only assume is the manager because his voice is on the restaurants' answering machine tells me that he sent it. I repeat that I didn't get it and he says, ""well I'm looking at it on my end and it shows I sent it"" and then he hangs up on me.Of course, 30 seconds later I finally actually get the email with the attachment. I fill it out and send it back and call the restaurant to confirm receipt.Again, the manager answers the phone and immediately transfers me to someone else who confirms receipt.I get that this is their policy and I get that he had no idea what my situation was, but here I am trying to spend money at HIS establishment, the LEAST he could do is not be a total douche.Needless to say, he won't have to worry about authorizing any more of my payments since I have zero intention of ever going back and neither should you if you have any interest in being treated with a modicum of respect.Oh, and the food's not that great either. It's ok. I can understand this sort of arrogance if we're talking about fine dining, but this isn't exactly a Michelin star restaurant. Far from it.",,,

118,David F.,"Manhattan, NY",193,47,48,5.0,10/6/2017,This place was great! Very unique blend of flavors. I came here on a date. The restaurant is quite large despite it's not so flashy external appearance. We almost missed it. There are three floors. You first walk in passed the bar. The ground and mezzanine are a little more lively. The third floor is more intimate. The fried goat cheese and Brussels sprouts are a must as many people have reviewed. We also had the salmon tartare which was great. The Paella was an awesome seafood blend. A little salty because of the squid ink but I really enjoyed the flavor.  The short rib is seasoned with horseradish which I found quite unique. For dessert we had the candy bar which was essentially a Ferrero Rocher in a bowl! So good. Be prepared to spend some money though. Our 7 dishes and 1 dessert brought out bill to $160 before tip. This restaurant is a cash and AMEX only place. Highly recommended. Great for date night. Casual hangout with friends and large groups. Great versatility.,,,

121,Marelle C.,"Manhattan, NY",182,144,0,2.0,11/13/2016,"After hearing such good things, my family and I were excited to check this place out. Unfortunately, we did not have a very good or memorable experience. After sitting down and looking over the menu, we decided to order 8 items between the 3 of us (one selection from each area). We had bacon wrapped dates/olives, salmon tartare, brussel sprouts, paella, ricotta gnocchi, lamb meatballs, boquerones, and camembert, Everything was just OK. We weren't blown away by anything in particular, but the tartare and paella were our favorites. Service wasn't exceptional. Our waiter was friendly, but our water was not refilled unless we asked for it. The food also came out way to fast. We would've preferred to have some time enjoying each small dish, but instead they rushed all 8 food items at us within 45 mins. When it came time for the bill though, we sat and waited forever to get someone's attention. With regard to ambiance, we enjoyed the look and feel of the restaurant. It's situated in an old brownstone and there is no signage outside, so it's tough to locate. When inside, it has a warm old feel. A drawback though is that it is extremely loud.  We happened to be sitting near a few larger groups who were practically yelling at each other across the table. It often felt like we were enjoying our meal at a NFL game as opposed to a nice restaurant. Overall, I don't recommend coming here. The food wasn't worth the poor service and sporting event level noise. Glad I tried it, but I won't be back.",2,,

I started with the No. 1 drink. It is a jalapeño vodka cocktail. Yummy. The rim on the glass was a perfect addition. We had Brussel sprouts, beet salad, goat cheese balls, hen of the woods, paella, risoto and two desserts (chocolate cake and lemon tart). We loved everything except the paella. It was filled with octopus and little rice (if any). The flavor was fishy also. However, everything else was very tasty. I would get the beets and Brussels again for sure.

125,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,5.0,9/15/2015,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Alta is a lovely, charming restaurant with an elegant, yet homey feel, in a converted townhouse in the West Village area. The place is easy to miss because there is no sign out front, so you have to be looking for it. My friends and I were seated downstairs near the fireplace and we ordered 5 dishes to share. First came the bacon wrapped dates and olives (I requested only dates since I don't like olives) which were stuffed with almonds. This was amazing! The bacon was perfectly crispy, full of flavor and the dates were sweet, chewy, wonderful. The roasted almond added a bit of crunch and wonderful taste. Then, the brussel sprouts, mixed with granny smith apple, creme fraiche and pistachio. The brussel sprouts tasted so good and were juicy, with great seasoning. I would have liked more apple in the dish though. The lamb meatballs had a charred red pepper sauce and some sort of white cheese. They were pretty good, but not particularly memorable for me.Roasted salmon came on top a summer vegetable salad of squash, corn, tomatoes and string beans. I enjoyed this dish a lot. The salmon was charred just a bit with the skin still on it and was slightly flaky, not fishy at all and was just delicious. And the salad was nice and fresh. We also ordered the roasted trumpet mushrooms, consisting of porcini caramel and breadcrumbs. This was quite good with a very savory, appetizing sauce with the best tasting breadcrumbs I have ever had! As for dessert, we tried two different ones: First one was the Chocolate Peanut butter Napoleon, which consisted of chocolate cream, peanut butter ganache and malted milk chocolate ice cream. This was delectable with perfectly flaky cake with layers of yummy chocolate and peanut butter. And the ice cream was creamy and sweet. The other dessert we had was the Georgia Julep Parfait, which came with roasted peaches, bourbon ice cream, mint granita and pecan praline. I really enjoyed this. The bourbon ice cream was superb, with amazing rich bourbon flavor and paired perfectly with the refreshing peaches and roasted/sugary pecans.The service was top notch and since one of my friends knew the host, our drinks and desserts were free! We weren't expecting that special treatment, so were pleasantly surprised. And I would absolutely come back to try other dishes and that's saying a lot, because I normally don't like dine in the same restaurant twice.",11,7,11

I highly recommend: (1) The foie gras torchon (AMAZINGGGGGG);(2) the fried goat cheese (yummmmm); (3) Grilled eggplant; (4) Black truffle burrata; and (5) Braised short-rib.

We got the fried goat cheese, black truffle burrata, ricotta gnocchi, the agnolotti, chicken wings, and the empanadas. All dishes were fantastic, if not brought out a little too quickly. For a dinner of three with drinks, we were in and out of there within an hour. The menu is perhaps a bit overpriced for how small the dishes were, even by tapas standards, but everyone was happy leaving the restaurant. The waiters are knowledgeable and the restaurant has a really cool vibe inside. If we were a group of 6-8, we definitely would've done the whole shebang (everything on the menu for $550).",,,

Dim lighting, with soft music playing, giving it a really nice intimate feel, so would definitely recommend it for a date night!Ordered the bacon wrap dates and fried goat cheese as starters, and was pleasantly surprised and pleased by both! Then on to the roasted beets, and the brussel sprouts which were very soft and rich in flavor! (My favorite dish) Also had the chorizo and shrimp skewers and chicken cigars which were both delicious! Lastly had the lamb meatballs... Must say, they were a bit disappointing, especially after seeing so many pictures of them posted! I was definitely expecting more, probably would not order them again, only because everything else I ordered blew them out of the water!I definitely plan on making another appearance, hopefully sooner, rather than later!

137,Jenn E.,"Seattle, WA",247,358,134,4.0,11/18/2016,"Came here for a weeknight dinner with a group of 5.  We were seated upon arrival on the top floor (note that the dining areas span multiple floors!) in a cozy dining room with a fireplace (unlit) and just one other party.  We started with a round of cocktails which were all great.  Highlights for me were the Las Flores (hibiscus, lemon vodka, st. germain and rhubarb) and the Lavender Collins (gin, lavender, soda).  The Lavender Collins in particular was really light, refreshing, and had a great taste and scent of lavender.After browsing the menu, our group decided to opt for about 3 dishes per person, with a heavier emphasis on the vegetables given that we had 1 vegetarian and 1 non-beef, pork or lamb eater.  The food came out in 4 waves of 4 dishes which was perfect, except that the last wave had only 1 dish for our vegetarian.  If you have a preferred sequence of dishes, definitely let your server know.Dishes were delicious with some really outstanding options.  One of my favorites was the fried goat cheese in lavender honey, which I could have eaten an entire order by myself, perfectly balanced between savory, sweet, salty and crunchy.  The raw tuna was also very good, a little spicy, good mix of flavors with the turnip and caperberry on top.  The lamb tangine is a MUST get if you like lamb - easily my favorite dish of the evening.  The lamb was incredibly tender, the spice profile was comforting yet interesting, veggies were cooked well and it was a very satisfying dish.If you like dessert, the dessert that had a glass of spicy hot chocolate, a churro, and chocolate chip ice cream was very fun though insanely rich.On the other hand, a couple of dishes fell a little short for me. The brussel sprouts almost felt like a dessert with big chunks of apple and a sweeter sauce, so, it was interesting but not my favorite.  Same with the beet salad with goat cheese panna cotta - the beets were very well cooked but it had a little too much cheese and sweetness.  The short rib was good but a little underwhelming in the flavor department next to the lamb.Service was slow at times, for ordering and getting drinks / water refilled which was unfortunate as it hampered an otherwise really good experience.  Maybe it was because we were on the top floor but the restaurant wasn't full and it felt annoying to have to constantly wave down anyone we saw just for water.",,,

The decor was Italianate and spacious-a rare combo and delight in crowded, modern NYC. Dim lighting and vines creeping up corners and walls complete the look! I love tapas-I just do-and I couldn't wait to try as much as possible! These are the dishes I tried:Bacon-wrapped olives-really good! olives were juicy and bacon melted off the toothpick.Spring vegetables-tasty and delicate with a light sauce.Pork empanadas-pork was flavorful but crust was too doughy. Cilantro sauce on the side was awesome!salmon tartare-the biggest disappointment of the night. I'd read so many good things about it but the flavor was bland and the seaweed wrap overwhelmed the salmon. Boo.Paella-solid paella but not the best I've had.Red sangria-great!

139,Ozge C.,"New York, NY",4,11,5,4.0,7/9/2017,"We really liked this place. The food was top notch, a mix of different flavors but super delicious nonetheless. Our waitress recommended us to have 2-3 dishes for each, but she made a caveat that each dish was in different sizes so it really depends on what you order. We initially ordered 5 total; bacon wrapped dates & olives, baked goat cheese, grilled octopus, pork empanadas and Brussel sprouts. Out of this 5, all of them except sprouts were on the smaller side with first two being snack sizes. We ended up adding paella and grilled eggplant but oh boy, they were huge! In the meantime, there was a confusion and they brought us a second set of empanadas and when we told them we already had it, they still gave it to us as a compliment! Long story short, the sizes are really different so don't assume anything and order in waves! One other thing we really liked about this place was the spacious seating upstairs. Unlike many other spots in NYC, you are not squeezed between other groups.

The tapas were delicious and the menu is reasonably priced. We had the salmon tartare, which was a standout due to the black crisp rice. The grilled calamari was wonderful as was the Cod.

One of my favorite dishes were the brussels sprouts - they made what could've been a basic dish very flavorful by adding pistachios. The Royal Trumpet Mushrooms were also great - the parmesan foam was really special, it had a cheese flavor but it had an interesting creamy texture to it. The linguine was also great with a bit of a spicy kick and the risotto was super creamy/cheesy so the two pasta dishes balanced each other out pretty well. Everything we ordered here was satisfying overall. I had no complaints but there really wasn't anything with a ""WOW"" factor.

Glowing lights, woodsy, rustic, charming, warm, cozy, romantic, inviting...gorgeous! Surprisingly more seating than I would expect, seating downstairs and more seating upstairs. Tapas style, small plates, order a few plates per person because you'll be hungry if you order less. Did you know you can order the whole menu for $450? Just saying, it might be worth it for bigger parties. I was here for a work dinner and we tried a good portion of the menu. Really there wasn't anything bad. The only thing that I didn't love was the spicy sauce on the short rib. The pork belly was delightful. The grilled octopus was excellent. The bass was delicious. The paella was good. The pulled pork empanadas were awesome. Bacon-wrapped dates were yummy. Roasted beets were wonderful. Shrimp was yummy. There may have been a few other things that I ate that I don't remember, maybe because the wine was so good :)Of the desserts, my least favorite was the olive oil cake, but the other three desserts we ordered including the sundae were all really good. Service was a bit slow, we were always trying to flag down our server to order more food or drinks. Understandably they were very busy and slammed. Atmosphere, ambiance, vibe, energy. If you're looking for a raucous good time or a romantic dinner, Alta's it.",3,1,4

152,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,324,577,5.0,7/11/2016,"Excellent tapas place! Expectations were set quite high after reading the glowing yelp reviews, and Alta definitely did not disappoint!The space itself is beautiful in a warm, rustic sort of way. Woody with a lot of candles and a real candle chandelier too! There are two levels and we got the balcony seating which was wonderfully intimate and romantic. The music is soft and the restaurant was not too noisy. Great setting for a date.The food is really creative and delicious. Like any tapas place it features a number of small plates and I'd recommend about 4-5 of these per couple. We had:- Bacon wrapped dates and olives. Good, because bacon makes everything better :) The sweetness of the dates goes better with the bacon than the strong flavor of the olives- Grilled shrimp and chorizo. Shrimp was well cooked and had a nice smoky flavor to it. Chorizo was a bit on the saltier side. It came on a bed of delicious avocado based sauce which worked really well.- Lamb meatballs. Really juicy, spiced with cumin and other flavors, and served with a dollop of lebne. Bursting with the signature flavors of this place.- Pork belly. This came on a bed of spicy sauce with a date paste-based accompaniment. The pork was perfectly cooked and the sauces really enhanced the flavors of the meat.- Grape leaves. Packed with duck confit, these were much nicer than any grape leaves I've had anywhere else.- Dessert was a chocolate coffee cake with coffee ice cream. This was outstanding! Not too sweet and full of rich flavor. It came with chocolate pearls that added a fun texture to the dish.The drinks here are good too, the sangria was solid and the raspberry ginger beer mocktail was delicious and refreshing.The server was mostly cold and to the point, but not in a rude sort of way. I'd dock half a star for this, but since they give you your privacy it works well if you want to focus all your attention on your date.",1,,
153,Steve A.,"Seaford, NY",0,2,0,4.0,1/14/2018,"Hi Everyone. I wish all a very Happy and Healthy New Year. My girlfriend and I are foodies in a HUGE way. We love our usual ""go to in a pinch"" places but what really turns us on is checking out different ""new to us"" restaurants that are tucked away, with ambiance, charm, excellent food and drinks. Many in the group may know this restaurant, so  those who do, forgive my enthusiasm but Alta in Greenwich is absolutely WONDERFUL!!! As soon as you walk in you notice the warm Tudor style decor with dark wood and accented earth tones. It has multi - levels. We sat on the second floor and looked downward into the first floor dining room. It gave us a chance to take in the charm and ambiance. The first floor dining area has a lovely fireplace but right of passage to sit by the fire is a four top. Next time we're bringing friends. The tapas style menu had just the right amount of variety as to not confuse the patron while offering something for every palate. We began with a White Sangria and a Diplomat,  made up of añejo rum,  ginger, and syrup. The sangria was ok, tasted a bit more like a mimosa, but what a perfect drink the Diplomat was to warm me up on a bone-chilling night. I ordered it neat, so I could savor the wonderful blend of rum, ginger, and syrup. We shared an assortment of perfectly condimented olives for starters, and then moved on to a creamy goat cheese beet salad. Salads rarely deserve a leading role but this one won an Oscar!! The sea scallops were perfectly pan seared and full of flavor. The bronzino was light, flaky, and too hit high notes on flavor. Service was friendly, attentive, and made us feel as if we were a guest in their home. Just when we thought it couldn't get any better we decided to order dessert; something we rarely do. We shared the Butterscotch Foam. I can only say this to describe it; AMAZING!! Light, flavorful, and not too sweet. The chocolate chips added a nice texture to this delight. We were so impressed with this wonderful treat, we ordered a second and complimented it with another espresso. I would strongly recommend Alta on 64 W 10th St, Greenwich Village, N.Y.. 212-505-7777.Absolutely wonderful place. If you plan to dine early, reservations aren't needed; however strongly suggested at 7pm and later, as we watched the entire restaurant fill up quickly at 7pm. We can't wait to go back!!! I hope you enjoy Alta as much as we did. God Bless.",,,

First of all, its deceptively large. You have no idea what you're walking into. The place is wonderfully lit and very intimate. Perfect for catching up and rounding off your weekend. We were waited on by DJ who's personality it very warm and calming but cheerful. A couple recommended we let DJ order for us. He did a very good job. We have a beautiful rioja (crianza 2006). I will come back again.",,,
155,Ridd M.,"Montclair, NJ",188,73,66,3.0,2/27/2017,"Hot spot in Manhattan that I think you should definitely try once. Ambiance is great and its a really nice spot for a date or girl's night (imagine fire places in the winter!). Also, they can accommodate larger groups so that's a plus if you want to do a celebration of some sorts. This is a tapas bar and their serving sizes are true to this. My table was a little shocked at just how LITTLE some of the dishes were (and the prices were near the 20's for these). I think each person needs to order 3-4 plates to get decently full here and even then, you can probably go eat something else afterwards. The things we did order were all pretty good though (nothing to rave about but I liked the fried goat cheese). They do have a few vegetarian options on their menu, which is nice. I think making the portion sizes just a tad bit larger (to try and meet the price tags) would still keep the ""tapas"" atmosphere but make the experience a lot more worthy. Go here for a nice dinner (just bring your wallet full as they only take Amex or cash :)",1,,1
156,Ce S.,"Queens, NY",16,17,3,5.0,5/29/2017,Went there last week with friends. I like every plate that we ordered. Seafood stew was my favorite. Lamb was good too.Make sure you bring cash or American Express card.,,,
157,Ryan K.,"Cranford, NJ",78,192,0,4.0,3/26/2017,"Food: Alta is a small-plates restaurant so we tried lots of things. Started with the blistered peppers, fried goat cheese and honey, Philadelphia surprise and the focaccia. I enjoyed everyone of them, but the philly surprise was definitely the most unique and maybe the best tasting. Our next round included the Brussels sprouts, the scallops, the ricotta gnocchi, the lamb meatballs and the braised short rib. Similarly to our first round, I tried everything and everything was delicious. The short rib was topped with horseradish and served over some beet infused pasta. The pasta was cooked perfectly and clearly very fresh. I also love horseradish so this dish is probably a ""must"" for next time. The other dish that jumped out at me was the ricotta gnocchi. Tender, unique, delicate and a little rich at the same time. Of course we had to finish our meal with a Molten chocolate cake and a baked Alaska. The chocolate cake was nicely done, but it was served with coffee ice cream which we all agreed was just not good. Perhaps my table just doesn't like coffee ice cream, but next time we'd supplement with vanilla ice cream (which our server assured me would not be a problem). I don't think I've ever had baked Alaska before so I really can't compare this one to others, but it was awesome. I wish we ordered two!Service: On point. Our server was a professional, friendly, clean well dressed 30-something. I was a little concerned at first when they brought out our initial orders so quickly, but the pace normalized after that. We stayed for almost 2 1/2 hours (ordering beers and wine) and there was no indication they wanted us to move to the bar etc. Happy with the service.Atmosphere: pretty cool. You basically enter at the basement level and are immediately greeted by a warm appropriately lit long bar. Beyond the bar is the main dining room, but this place has many different smaller rooms for people to eat in. We ate somewhere on the second or third level in a room that probably sat 20ish people. This place is both comfortable and romantic, and should be enjoyed by couples as well as groups.",,,1

159,Alex P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,9,0,1.0,1/4/2018,"What a huge disappointment! Went here on Christmas Eve/ My Birthday celebration. The place wasn't that full as we were expecting, so it was perfect. But... the staff was terrible. Our waitress came 12 minutes after as we were sited, not really friendly at all. We ordered appetizers that came 15 minutes after. The main coarse was wayyyy to late, and we all got food at the different time, so by the time I got my meatballs, half of my guest ate already, the second half was still waiting for the food. Our waters were never refiled and the waitress really avoid us, so that we had to ask the manager to send someone to us. Ordered a dessert. but never got the spoons. I mean, I do understand it was Christmas Eve, but if you are open, please make sure everything operates as it supposed to be. So wont come here again ever(",,,
160,Athena L.,"San Diego, CA",4,26,25,2.0,3/27/2017,"I went here for my birthday dinner with my family. It's a beautiful place and yes the food was good, not the best (bacon olive and date(not a good combo, meatballs were not good either)  but not worth the price. It's extremely expensive for such small portion. A few things we ordered that were small were the falafel, striped bass and risotto. There are other tapas places in the city that are as good but served a bigger/normal portion size such as Boqueria. I don't mind paying for delicious food but the portion is extremely tiny, unless you are looking to spend $500 on a birthday dinner for 5. I advise going elsewhere for good tapas, we definitely did not feel satisfied and the restaurant didn't do anything special for me even though the reservation noted it was a birthday dinner.Also this restaurant only accepts cash or American Express which is not clearly advertised except on a small note at the bottom of the menu. There is no ATM in the establishment which was annoying as someone had to leave to go find an ATM to help pay for the meal.",,1,
161,Dara S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,8,0,3.0,3/13/2018,"This is a stereotypical romantic West Village restaurant with a cozy, intimate ambience. The portions are predictably small but intense and flavorful. The servers were generally prompt. These things would all be fine if the waiters themselves weren't so awful. After dinner we left a generous tip, and we waited for change. We'd already given them at least a 22% tip--definitely above average. My date overheard the waiters and bartenders counting money at the end of the night and openly complaining about the tip, saying 22% wasn't enough. WTF?! Not only is this unprofessional, but it's rude. The waitress then came by and saw an additional $10 we'd gotten in change (after already paying our tip) and took it right from us. So tacky and not cool. I'd expect better from a place with those prices and pretensions.",1,,

164,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,4.0,2/9/2016,"After trying its sister restaurant Cata, Alta managed to sneak under my nose for quite some time, despite it actually being the older restaurant of the two and seeming quite popular when it came up on my Yelp search. Just a stone's throw away from my apartment, I was sort of surprised that Alta had never really crossed my mind previously. You think you have a firm grip of the food scene in New York, and something always proves you wrong. The entrance to Alta is very unassuming, so you'll actually have to pay attention when searching for the place, or else you might miss it. The inside, however, is enormous, and at the same time, pretty tightly packed with tables on its two floors. I was a fan of the lighting and decor, and found the ambiance to be suitable both for group dining and for intimate dining.Anyways, in the realm of tapas, the idea of getting a bunch of small plates seems great, but I'm always wary of portions and value. However, Alta, like Cata, does a good job of maintaining quality and value at the same time. In terms of our order, we decided to go pretty standard, with a few outliers. My favorites were the lamb meatballs which were nice and tender, the bacon-wrapped dates (a perennial favorite), and the grilled octopus. The grilled octopus was a bit on the smaller side, but so delicious that the dish redeemed itself in terms of value. I did find the presentation to be a little less impressive than I had expected. Some of the dishes, like the meatballs and the empanadas, while delicious, were strewn all over the plate in a very neglectful fashion, which was odd, given that the pictures on Yelp all looked decent. I usually don't care too much about presentation as long the food tastes good, but the way everything was sloppily arranged was sort of a sign that the chef may not even have put in the minimal effort into the dish. Just something to note, and perhaps it was just something that night, but not anything that ruined our experience.Service was pretty nondescript, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It was just very interesting that our waiter was far less magnanimous compared to our experience at Cata. Nonetheless, our drink refills came quickly, and everything came to our table, including our check, without a hitch. Prices, again, are on the expensive side, but the variety and value is there. In general, I'm a fan. I'm very glad I managed to find Alta after all these years. Will definitely be back to try some of the more adventurous dishes.",34,18,31
165,Joseph T.,"Merrick, NY",95,1540,40,4.0,3/20/2016,"Alta is a cool tapas bar serving up an eclectic menu of dishes. Alta has a very large bar which is accommodating for walk-ins without reservations (even on a Saturday night).We started with white anchovies and fried goat cheese balls. The white anchovies were topped with onions and herbs which added elements of bitterness and herbiness to the salty anchovies. To my surprise, they were not oily at all. The goat cheese balls were way too poignant for my liking. The fried cheese balls were very sharp. There was honey drizzled on the plate to add savoriness and sweetness, but it was still too sharp for me.Next, we had the foie gras with eel terrine. The eel terrine had a texture similar to jam. The foie gras and eel had very unique flavors. I'd characterize them on the savory side. The last dish (and my favorite) was the braised short rib. The short rib meat was juicy and tender. It sat on a bed of beet spaghetti. The pasta had mild beet flavors with the consistency of standard gluten spaghetti. It was topped with shredded horseradish which had the texture of shredded Parmesan cheese with the undoubtably flavor of horseradish. The staff here was very friendly and attentive. I appreciated how quick the dishes were ready. I also liked that we were able to immediately sit at the bar whereas other places had wait times around 90 minutes.",2,,
166,Ashley K.,"New York, NY",312,126,296,4.0,3/8/2015,"I sat at the bar on a busy Saturday night without a reservation and boy did we get lucky.  Shortly after arriving at 7:45 the place became so crowded with young 20 somethings most of whom looked like they were on a date that there was not even a place to stand.  I was in shock as I only chose the restaurant because I skied on the resort in Utah bearing the same name.  The unmarked door also made the little entrance hard to find on the little side street in the west village.Everyone was enjoying the drinks all at typical NYC prices $10-$15 each.  The sangria is their specialty.Food: This is where I take away a star although I love the idea of a tapas bar where you can pick exactly what you want and slowly eat your way through the evening.  I liked most of the dishes but did not LOVE them.  The mushroom flatbread was the weakest of the items although it was recommended to us.  It was peculiarly spicy and lacked crispness.  The spaghetti squash carbonara was the surprise as they accidentally made an extra order and it was on the house.  It was complimented well with bacon and parmesan.  The gnocchi and beats were a little forgettable but tasty and the seared sea scallops were great.  They were paired with a cauliflower puree with capers, currants, and pine nuts and was exceptional.Overall I rate this a 3.5 and would definitely love to return as the bartenders alone kept us entertained but expect a pricy evening full of hipsters!   CASH ONLY! *unless you have American Express but I don't know anyone who does",2,,1
167,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",731,1177,35,4.0,1/28/2016,"Walking into Alta was like walking into The Secret Garden. I crossed through the ivy-covered front doorway into a magical land of romance and indulgence. My friends and I were seated in the main dining room, near a roaring fire which added such amazing ambiance (and a rustic outdoorsy smell). There was also an upper floor with seats around a balcony, keeping the main dining room's ceiling fully two-story. We started with wine (rose for me) and tasted nearly half of the tapas menu. Our server helped us to understand the portion sizes, and there were a few items where we needed more than one order to satisfy our party of five. Standouts included the Fried Goat Cheese with Lavender Honey, Grilled Octopus, Roasted Sea Scallops, Pulled Pork Empanadas and the Lamb Meatballs. But my absolute favorite dish was the Smoked Mozzarella which was just so delicious and unexpected, served on a skewer with some toasted bread. Dessert was also delicious, especially the Chocolate Peanut Butter Napoleon and the Lemon Scented Olive Oil Cake (served warm with Olive Oil Ice Cream). My only complaint about Alta is that it is incredibly noisy, and I oftentimes couldn't even hear what the person across from me was saying.",6,1,5

All the dishes are tapas so you can split multiple with your date or group. My date and I had 8 courses (no dessert) and were perfectly satisfied. I think most people would get less, but we like to EAT.Best dishes: The steak tartare is always my favorite. A generous portion served with pretzel chips. The spaghetti squash was also surprisingly amazing, tasting like full pledges spaghetti carbonara without all the calories. Best bang for your buck? The $5 fried goat cheese with lavender honey-- always a treat. The Damage: Without drinks we spent $100 on food, no tip. So overall about $150 per couple.

173,Rey S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,30,71,4.0,5/13/2017,"4 STARS Came to Alore for couple of occasions. Place is near West 4th, hidden away between brown stone houses, from the flashy bars around the area. Good bar, even better tapas.TL;DROverall (4 stars): A rustic tapas place with cozy seating, that has a bar at the front and with a daring menu. The service is good, food is delicious and a bar you can spend the rest of the night, this is a great place for a full night out. A little pricey but it's tapas so nothing new.FULL REVIEW:Service (1 star): The staff greeted us right away and accommodated a large group with center tables. I expected a little less than stellar treatment because we were a little loud and few of us were a little picky with our dish choices but they were very pleasant to interact with and more than understandable.Menu (1 star): GREAT! Wide range of choices and you'll find interesting gems and takes on your typical tapas menus. They have a great bar with a selection that would cover anyone, this includes wine.Pricing (0.5 star): Its not overly pricy still ranges in the higher end when it comes to tapas. You're looking at $12-20 a dish with small but could be shared between two people. The bar prices are as expected, $10-15 for you straight and mix drinks.Presentation/Atmosphere (0.5 star): I like the space because it sends a rustic, old timey vibe. It has two floors but it's condensed in a very small space. Walking throw the aisle of tables may require some acrobatics and contorting acts go get by as the tables are very intimately close. However, the crowd is pleasant, a bit older, so more understanding of the space. Taste (1 star): absolutely delicious. I have always enjoyed their menu and I am always surprised by a new dish I try. Not your normal burger and skewers, albeit they have that. Lool tastes better than it looks, that's when you know the place is doing something great.Bill: A little over $80 for 2 people, about 4-5 dishes and two drinks.Enjoy!",,,

The food, service, and atmosphere are bar none some of the best I've ever experienced. The room is candlelit, with a 2nd floor balcony providing more of the romantic seating that exists on the 1st floor. The bar is somewhat noisy but you can still find an intimate corner. Now, the food...to die for. From goat cheese balls to flat breads to chick peas, everything I've tasted is divine. They also have a full cocktail & wine bar, so that you can indulge to your heart's content. Overall, this place is a great date place or somewhere cool to get toghether with a group of friends.

You probably wouldn't find this place unless someone tells you about it or you happen to notice the bar stools while strolling through the Village, which is exactly what my wife and I did.We each had a nice cocktail -- I had a Spanish Manhattan, which was made nice and strong with hardly any sweetness, just the way I like it.

182,Stefanie S.,"New York, NY",0,4,2,1.0,4/27/2018,"What restaurant calls you the afternoon of your reservation, leaves a message to confirm and then calls again 3 hrs later saying they've cancelled because they didn't get a verbal confirmation? This one.  Ever think people have meetings and can't answer their cell phone all day? Maybe if you need a verbal you should call a day before and not a couple hours. The city's best and most popular restaurants don't pull that.",,,
183,Danie G.,"ELMHURST, NY",38,12,61,4.0,8/22/2016,"Four stars for ambience, food presentation, and amazing friends goat cheese. Service wasn't as great today. I had to get out of my seat to get salt since I just couldn't seem to get my servers attention even though he was in eyesight. I will say that he was busy folding napkins and not just idling away. Seeing Luis however, who wasn't our server tonight but was in the past made up for the lack of attention as he came over and greeted us. I had the fried goat cheese with the wild lavender honey. This is a must. The tangy goat cheese, coupled with the perfect amount of crunch pairs very well with the light floral honey. Black truffle burrata... Well it's served with summer truffles, to which I'm learning are o.k. The black truffle burrata was good for what it is and had a nice shaving of summer truffles. Alta no longer has the mushroom flatbread to our great and I mean enormous disappointment. Instead there is a spelt flat bread with thinly sliced zucchini and topped with dollops of charred ricotta. I wasn't a fan as the spelt has a bitter aftertaste and the flatbread itself was under-seasoned, but if you want a vegetarian option I'm sure it'll be right for you. The soft shell crab was great! Fried to perfection and seasoned just right. The chili aioli was not to overpowering with the light delicate fry of the crab. I wouldn't say that it had a Meyer lemon salad, as it was more like a garnish and not big enough to be a ""salad"". The Valdeon blue is so delicious with the blueberry cardamom preserves... I will definitely come back!!",,,
184,Nir F.,"Jersey City, NJ",86,3,0,2.0,4/4/2017,"Alta is definitely a good tapas place. But it's also quite expensive, and your expectations scale. The plus side is that it's a nice place, very elegant. The menu does have some things that are more unique relative to other tapas places. That said, they're only more unique, not necessarily more delicious.I can't say that I regret coming here but I don't ever plan to come back. Bocqueria and Sala 19 are a little more conventional, but the food is also better at little more than half the cost. I suppose if you really go to tapas often enough to get tired of other places you may want to work Alta into your rotation. But if I'm going to a tapas place once every few months it will not be this one.Also, minus a full star for only accepting cash and Amex. It's fairly ridiculous to not accept 3/4 of the major credit card companies, at a place where your cheque is likely to be a couple hundred dollars or more.",,,
185,Christina G.,"New York, NY",404,474,103,5.0,10/24/2016,"This is a fantastic restaurant all around. It's ultra romantic, so a perfect date spot, but good for lots of other occasions as well. They have a lovely bar, and a nice cocktail selection. The actual dining area is cozy and beautiful, and the atmosphere is amazing. For whatever reason, the décor makes me feel like this is a perfect Fall/Winter restaurant. Probably because they have a big fireplace that makes it feel cozy and rustic inside. The service was excellent, and the sommelier selected a fantastic bottle of wine for us. Wish I could remember the name. We tried several items off the menu from each category. Everything was delicious and I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong with any of it. The menu is great, and quality of the food is excellent.  They have some of your standard Spanish tapas options, but the selection leans more heavily toward a Mediterranean influence, which was a refreshing change. It is somewhat pricey, but worth every penny. I can't wait to return.",32,13,25
186,Joanna N.,"New York, NY",846,415,2009,4.0,10/26/2015,"I picked Alta for my quad date with my girlfriends and all of our boyfriends. It was the perfect choice. Alta has a very unassuming front with no signage. Upon entering is the long, narrow bustling bar area. Past the bar, you're transported to a quaint and rustic two story restaurant that is just so romantic and warm, perfect ambiance for a date. The chandelier centerpiece is also quite gorgeous.I'd been to Alta once years ago and did have a great meal. Since there were 8 of us tonight though, we decided on the whole shebang. Priced at $450, you receive one of everything on the menu -- all 40 tapas! It was definitely a well-balanced meal and more than enough food. Some of the tapas were smaller than the others and only allowed each person a bite but everyone got to taste everything. Overall, everything was solid! A few notable favorites -- fried chickpeas -- these were so simple but so delicious! paella -- the crispy saffron rice was incredible soaked in the black garlic aiolifoie gras torchon -- so rich and yum spread atop the allspice crisps with a smear of grape jellybraised short rib -- the ribs were extremely tender but I much enjoyed the beet spaghetti that this dish came with. chestnut fettuccine -- delicate, subtle flavor but hearty and deliciousgrilled calamari and grilled octopus -- both of these dishes were grilled to perfectionFor drinks, everyone had their choice of beers and cocktails. We also ordered a white for the table, a Trapet Riesling 'Riquewihr' -- it was so smooth, mildly sweet and perfect that we ended up ordering 2 more bottles.Service was fine. The tapas just kept coming one after another.The bill for 3 bottles of wine($43 each), a handful of beers, few cocktails, the whole shebang + tax and tip(auto 20% I think?) came to $804. Great evening with great company. Will be back again and I'll know exactly what to order.",7,2,8
187,Stephen P.,"New York, NY",99,20,0,1.0,2/26/2017,"The menu is interesting and varied, but not so diverse as to be truly interesting.  The service is very good and the room is beautiful.  BUT the portions are microscopic and you can easily run over $200 for two without trying too hard - to insist on cash or Amex is a deal breaker.    Had the chance to speak to the chef due to happenstance.  Honestly, painfully smug.  I don't say that lightly and I wouldn't have mentioned it if he wasn't so damned arrogant.Like many reviews here, we went and ate somewhere else right afterward.  Do yourself a favor and check out that somewhere else first and skip Alta altogether.",,,
188,Mina C.,"New York, NY",12,73,151,2.0,5/4/2016,"The place is adorable and perfect for a date night.  I have wanted to try Alta for the longest time and since we were in the neighborhood, we decided to give it a shot. We didn't mind sitting at the bar and found two spots not long after we arrived. The service was good but the food wasn't what I expected although the presentation was very nice. We had the anchovies, paella, shrimp and lamb tagine. Nothing really stood out enough for me that would make me want to come back again.",,,

191,Catherine A.,"Bangor, ME",274,575,1400,5.0,10/26/2016,"One of my all-time favorite restaurants in NYC. The menu has changed a bit since my last visit (RIP Philadelphia Surprise) but the flavors and quality are still every bit as good, if not better. I recommend a reservation, and please note this place is CASH ONLY (or mastercard). We recently dined with 5 people and were given the five star treatment by our waitress. She recommended ordering approximately 3 items per person, however, we ordered two per person and were all full by the end. Highlights include the Fried Goat Cheese with lavender honey, the ricotta gnocchi, the mussels (the sauce is to die for), the brussels sprouts, pork belly, pork empanadas, the tomatoes and the lamb tagine; however, I really don't think there is a bad option on the menu. If you're hungry and feeling adventurous, you can try everything on the menu for about $500.",1,1,2
192,Elizabeth B.,"Boca Raton, FL",0,24,2,5.0,10/1/2017,"What a great meal! Hidden on West 10th Street, this  wonderful spot really impressed us! We had the mussels which were wonderful and then took the advice of our amazing server (I think her name was Rebecca) and had the paella! One of the best loaded with seafood and a crispy rice cake. We then ordered on her suggestion the hanger steak which is something I would have never ordered. Omg! That was fantastic. The flavoring of this dish exceeded any expectation! We then took her suggestion of the Alta Candy Bar. So worth the calories.Loved this place. Loved our server. Cannot wait to go back",,,
193,NJ D.,"Mercer County, NJ",155,104,30,3.0,10/12/2015,"We came here with a 5:30 pm dinner reservation eagerly anticipating a nice dinner prior to a show in the city. The place is a little hard to find, as there is no sign out front. Very unassuming, which is kind of cool. You make your way inside past the long bar to a very cozy, inviting and intimate space. You feel as though you've just entered an underground club.  We were seated in the maining dining room, kind of smack dab in the middle of the room. I would have preferred to sit upstairs in one of the tables overlooking the main dining room.  No luck, as the maitre d told us those were reserved. Ok, fine. On to the menu. We started with 2 huge glasses of red sangria (which they only sell by the glass, no pitchers), which was really tasty and strong. We sampled the following dishes, which on the whole, I was a little underwhelmed by:  - lavender goat cheese (I had heard so much about. Was good, but nothing spectacular, IMO).- calamari (not fried, but fresh with a sort of black ink sauce, with red peppers. Very good).- trumpet mushrooms (ok, but not my favorite)- lamb meatballs (ok, but tasted like they were missing something)- scallops (just ok, I think I make better ones at home)- pulled pork empanadas (my boyfriend seemed to enjoy, I don't eat pork)- beef sliders (served in a puff pastry, I think this was my fav thing that we ordered) We were by no means full, so before we racked up a $250 bill trying to get full on two bite plates, we decided to try a dessert (apple crostada) which the server said was pretty much full size, and move on with our night. Bill ended up being $130 with 2 glasses of sangria. Not horrible, for dinner in NY.  However, we got to the show and ordered a pizza as we were both still hungry when we arrived.",2,,1

195,Sargam M.,"Manhattan, NY",78,156,0,4.0,1/21/2016,"It is a charming restaurant in a converted townhouse,easy to miss because there is no sign out front - you have to be looking for it (as you should be, based on the food :) ) We ordered the following:1. fried goat cheese with lavender honey: great start to the meal, it didn't feel overly rich / heavy. The savoriness of the goat cheese was well met with the honey2. roasted beets: was ok, felt like it was missing a little seasoning3. chestnut pasta: great dish, the fettuccine was delicate but still felt like a hearty dish4. bucheron gnocchi: amazingly soft gnocchi, with a perfect sauce5.

Ambience is still great but without great food it's hardly worth mentioning. Server was catatonic and showed no interest. I actually got sick the next day. Go figure. Won't be back. Too bad Alta. Maybe you need to take inventory right about now before too many others notice.,,,

Updated review","""Don't do it"", they said.""You'll waste food"", they said. ""It's for parties of 9, but really we recommend it for 12-15"", they said. ""Let's do it anyway"", we said. 50 dishes. 8 people. Everything on the menu. The Whole Shebang. Killed it, we did. Then we had some cake.After going back again, I'd have to say that I still think that the food is good, but not amazing. I suppose now I can somewhat say that with authority as I've tried everything.Some 4-5 star worthy items, in order of preference:- Braised short rib with beet-Barbaresco spaghetti- Japanese grilled eggplant with feta and watercress- Lamb tagine - meat fell off the bone and the root vegetables, so delicious!- Fried goat cheese, lavender infused honey- Crispy brussels sprouts, apples were a great addition to this dish- Warm creamy polenta, not usually a fan, but always willing to give it a try in a different form, pleasantly surprised by this texture and preparation.- Housemade pizza - fontina cheese, crimini mushrooms, thin crustPS. I've attached a blurry menu.",9,3,3
198,Ariel M.,"New York, NY",225,73,21,4.0,8/24/2016,"I'm not going to be too hard on Alta. I came in with really high expectations of the dining experience here. We got a number of good dishes, and a few not so good dishes. Do get: heirloom tomatoes... Omg we ended up ordering a second serving of this. Heavenly. I also think it's tomato season so any plate of them would be devine, but I'll give alta the benefit of the doubt. Also get: lamb tangine. Really good flavors and filling. Lamb was tender and well braised. You could skip: the white anchovies. These are normally an interesting staple that we get at tapas restaurants, but these didn't make the cut. Also skip: the shrimp. We were expecting a hot, sizzling shrimp and ended up with 4 luke warm shrimps on a plate. Meh.",3,,

About 20 dollars a plate for the such little food is really pricey, but its perfect for a light dinner.  It's cash and Amex only accepted",,,
