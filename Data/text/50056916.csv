0,Kevin H.,"New York, NY",26,118,165,5.0,11/10/2018,This place is the best Philly cheese steak place in all of NYC. The steak is very moist and juicy! The chicken is so flavorful and not dry at all. My personal favorite is getting the Steak with hot cherry peppers and meaty cheese wiz!,,,
1,Peter T.,"New York, NY",11,66,683,2.0,9/30/2018,"The cheese steaks are pretty good ... if you ever get them. And if you do, they'll likely be not what you ordered.Last week we ordered two cheese steaks, fries and extra wiz. It took almost two hours to get to our apartment.Tonight we ordered two cheese steaks with extra wiz and there was no extra wiz. FAIR WARNING! Do not expect to get what you ordered!In the immortal words of Fo rest Gump, ""Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue."" And I will not be stupid enough to ever order from this place again.

2,t.j. m.,"Los Angeles, CA",1983,52,126,5.0,8/23/2018,"Well, it's real.  A second place that you can get an authentic, very very very VERY delicious Philadelphia cheesesteak.    It's all there. Cheese Wiz. Onions. Finely chopped steak. And. They. Ship. The. Bread. Up. From Philadelphia. Every night.  Half baked, and then they finish the baking on premises.  My god, it's a winning approach to the cheesesteak, and it's very different from 99 miles to Philly.   But 99 miles to philly is closed now, never more to be again.  So I say shorty's reigns supreme, and if you want authenticity without the 99 miles to Philly (literally twice over) then shorty's doesn't come up short, if anything, I hope it's in it for the long game.Wit wiz please.",7,6,5

Thanks for the cheese fries and side of bacon strips?? Someone was so lazy they couldn't be bothered to chop up the bacon. Honestly, these weren't even good and ended up in the trash after two bites.",,1,
4,Mendel F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",132,75,78,4.0,2/15/2018,"This little bar in flatiron makes great Philly cheese steaks. I've never been to Philadelphia, so I can't really compare to what an authentic one tastes like, but this was pretty damn good.A few of us showed up on a Wednesday night, and were seated at a table right away. There was also bar seating available. The service was quick, and the food came out right away. We ordered cheese steaks and bacon cheese fries all of which were really delicious, and we subsequently scarfed em down.The walls are lined with TVs so it seems like a great spot to catch a game. They also have a great beer selection, so if you have a beer snob in the group Shorty's should satisfy em.",,,1
5,Lon H.,"Fremont, CA",511,705,3540,4.0,10/4/2017,"I was visiting our NYC Office earlier this month and my co-worker suggested cheesesteaks from Shorty's.  I'm always in the mood for cheesesteaks, so I was game.  The first thing that caught my eye was the size of this cheesesteak, since It definitely isn't for the meek.The steak was tender, tasty and cooked perfectly.  Along with the onions and bell peppers, this was one tasty sammie.  By the time I devoured the whole thing, I was ready for an afternoon siesta.  I also stopped by for some drinks with my co-workers after work one day.  We watched a couple of MLB games and sat at the bar enjoying our brews.  The staff were friendly and we had a good time.",4,1,2
6,Farrah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",55,478,1585,4.0,3/24/2018,"Happy Cheesesteak Day to meeeee (and everyone else, I guess)! Being hungry and finding out my regular Cheese steak haunt is out of commission prompted a search leading me to Shorty's.  When each of the locations had a solid 4 star rating I thought it was safe enough to go and have a whiz it with for my Cheesesteak Day celebration. The atmosphere is unpretentious and are free to enjoy your food and/or conversations without feeling harassed.  You might mistake them for stand-offish but they are just laid back.  I was a bit early so bartender offered me a beer (she even had recommendations and allowed me to sample a few). The selection was unique and broad.  I ended up having a Stella Artois Cidré . Finally, my friend arrived and hungrily, we ordered cheesesteaks shared an Italian fries. The wait was average (10-15minutes).  A nice lady from the back brought it out and we couldn't help but to drool.... crusty, chewy bread oozing cheez whiz and a peek of steak  so juicy and delicious.  The fries were better than average and the sprinkling of seasoning and Romano were a nice touch.The sandos were so good (sorry to say it was even better than my regular place) I ordered two for the road (I would never be forgiven if I didn't bring the bf one). I will surely be back, and likely try the other locations if I'm in a cheese steak mood.  Next time I might try the cheese steak spring rolls.",1,,
7,Natalie A.,"Clark, NJ",101,316,856,4.0,9/27/2017,"Not a bad cheesesteak at all, especially one you can order through GrubHub. Decent price and did I mention it's through delivery?! I'm glad I don't live in the city anymore because this would easily be a go to take out food for me. Some interesting apps on the menu but really it's all about the cheesesteak! Fresh ingredients but not exactly a huge cheesesteak, you're going to want to get your own at this place unless you're sharing some side dishes. The sweet potato fries are pretty delicious as well!",,,

9,Rhea J.,"San Bruno, CA",0,4,2,5.0,10/20/2018,"Checked out this place in May because we wanted to watch the NBA playoffs in a quiet spot near our hotel. Shorty's did not disappoint in every aspect: access, location, cleanliness, service, and food. I know nothing about what a real cheesesteak looks and tastes like but if you're hungry and not picky there's something for everyone on their menu. The bartender was also the server and even though we sat at a table he made it a point to walk over to us several times to check on us. No matter where you sit there's a TV screen in your sight. Given it's NYC and there are hundreds of places to spend your tourist time and money, this is a spot to break from being a tourist.",,,

It might seem like a splurge at almost $20 for Cheesesteak and fries, but think of the amount you are saving for gas and tolls to Philly for a cheesesteak! This place does not skimp on the meat at all! It is flavorful, meaty, and extremely gratifying. Cajun fries or Italian fries can be your added bonus!",,,

For some reason, New York can't produce anything that is as good as what's on South Street.Shorty's isn't bad. The steak is passable and the bread is decent.

18,Andrew B.,"Brooklyn, NY",219,387,217,4.0,2/6/2017,"Shorty's slings up some damn fine cheesesteaks in the guise of a generic midtown Irish pub dive bar. Came here on a Friday for lunch because I hate myself and want the rest of my day to take as long as humanly possible. A steak, fries and a beer is $16 - but they will tack on a fee for more expensive beers and don't tell you which is which. I ordered a two hearted and it was an extra buck fifty which is kinda shitty but whatever. The steak came out pretty quickly and was hot as hell. I know this because it's 3 days later and the roof of my mouth still feels like a burn victim. I got a 'whiz wit' which I truly believe to be the only legit cheesesteak and it was fantastic. Huge, perfectly toasted roll piled high with gray meat and highlighter yellow cheese just like god intended. The sweet potato fries were 'ok' and I didn't bother finishing them as the steak huge. Service was amicable, crowd was 'bridge and tunnel demure' and the place was clean enough to eat in. I'll definitely be back. Oh, and the food coma was legit, so come here at 1 on a Friday at your own risk.",2,2,3

Ordered the club cheesesteak and found it to be fairly bland and meet unseasoned with a small portion of meat placed on top of veggies to hide the lack of meat and cheese. The fries were a seasoned battered dip fry. Although I wasn't too impressed by the sandwich unfortunately, both bartenders were great and provided phenomenal service. The space itself has a nice number of tvs for viewing a good game and although I did not drink appeared to have a good beer list as well. Although the cheesesteak was meh, the bar itself has allot of promise.",,,
23,Cindy U.,"New York, NY",276,412,694,2.0,3/12/2018,"Number of visits: 2If you're looking for a greasy hangover cure, Shorty's is definitely the place to go. If you're looking for a good cheesesteak sandwich, Shorty's would not be on the top of the list for a recommendation. The cheesesteak sandwiches are paired with fries that are on point, but the sandwich is a little too messy, full of grease and just isn't appealing to look at. It is something that satisfies a craving once in a blue moon, but there are definitely a few fast food restaurants that serve up a better cheesesteak than Shorty's unfortunately. For anyone looking for more drinks, there's definitely a handful of choices here so that you can continue your rage or just enjoy another glass with your cheesesteak. Tons of bar seating and stools around for you to snag a seat, make a seat and share a seat!",,,

26,Elizabeth K.,"New York, NY",297,141,53,5.0,6/17/2017,"How have I never reviewed this place? This is my go to spot around my office for Happy hour. It's a super chill bar with great music, great staff and a fantastic beer/cider list. They have a lot of unique beers and I love trying all the new ones I've never heard of.All draft/can beers are $5 during happy hour which goes until 7 pm during the week. They also discount their different fries which are really good. In terms of food, I've had their buffalo wings which were definitely a bit spicy (so if that's not your thing, def tell them), but they were super good. My next move is to try one of their philly cheesesteaks.I must say, I'm not even a huge Philly fan but this bar has character and is super home-y.

My boyfriend is a HUGE Philadelphia Eagles fan and we have come to Shortys many times to watch the game. It is super crowded so make sure to come early if you want a seat (with your whole party or they will not seat you) but the most fun you will have on a Sunday.

It was a far walk from our hotel, but worth every step. The environment is laid back as it is basically a bar, and all the employees were so friendly it made me wonder how people can say New Yorkers are rude! Then comes the food, which did not disappoint either. We decided to get two different cheesesteaks to split, and they were both delicious and very filling. I would definitely recommend this place for a few Friday night drinks and some great food with friends!",1,1,1

My go to place after work most of the time because of the great HH and great selection of beers on tap. HH from 4-7 everyday and the prices are great for this location. I'd have to say they serve one of the most authentic Philly cheese steaks around. Not quite like Philly, but darn close. The fries here are some of the best money can buy, always fried to a perfection with a soft pillow textured middle of fluffy carby goodness.

It's a pretty low key, non fancy place but a solid place to watch some sports. The place is not tiny but not large, either.The food:Cheesesteak with onions and Whiz- It was good, it wasn't terribly exciting but definitely a good cheesesteak. It's a good place to get a Philly cheesesteak when you are no where near Philly.

For $11 you get a huge sandwich with tons of sliced sirloin. You can choose from American, Provolone, or Whiz, but there's obviously no contest because why wouldn't you order something with something called Whiz on it? It's probably disgustingly unhealthy but you're already in a bar eating a cheesesteak so just go all out. Wings are also tasty, the spicy isn't too spicy for my delicate tastebuds, and the service during lunch has always been fast with no wait for a table.

Finally after 3.5 hrs of waiting I asked to cancel the order, the staff was extremely rude and was blaming me for ordering with them on a busy night. Why would a restaurant take an order and give an ETA if it knows it's backed up and can't fulfill the order. I'm positive there are much better places to order a cheesesteak in the city.",,1,

When you need that fried greasy lunch it really hits the spot. My favorite is hands down the buffalo chicken cheese steak but it's a really hard toss up with whether you go with the yeungling rings or season fries on the side cause they both are incredible. There are plenty of tvs surrounding the bar which would make it great to watch game although I never have. They even have a to go counter in the back if you want to grab something real quick.,,,

This was my first time at this specific shorty's. As we entered we noticed that the restaurant/ bar was pretty empty and looked as if it were closing. All the ketchups, menus and utensils were on a table. I went up to the bar and asked one of the bartenders if the kitchen was opened she replied yes, I asked for a table and just stared at me. I then went and grabbed out menus and sat down, after about 5min she stated that those menus were dirty and she'd bring us some. Im not sure why it took her so long to say anything if I explained that we would like a table. We sat ourselves and she came back with a few menus. She took our orders and though the food came out relatively fast she never bought us any utensils or sauces she just sat on her phone.Shorty's kitchen staff never seems to disappoint, the cheese steaks were great as well as the fries and monzerella triangles. The service in this location isn't the best, the bar was not full and this was a Thursday night a little before 11PM. I definitly recommend any shorty's locations for their cheesesteaks but I probably won't be back to this specific location",,,1

We ended up with a couple cheesesteaks, onion rings, and cheese fries (#YOLO). The cheesesteak was exactly what I needed/wanted. My hands stopped trembling and the ringing in my ears subsided with the first bite. The side of cheese fries provided a perfect, artery clogging complement. Yes, I ate it all.We shared an order of onion rings (my weakness). They were made in-house and served with a spicy mayo sauce.

Went straight to back window where they do to go orders. Asked a nice waitress who was walking by what i should order. She told me if its my first time to order classic cheesesteak. So thats what i did. Classic cheesesteak with fried onions, whiz, and some old bay fries. Came to $16 and was ready about 10 min later. Went home and dug in.Cheesesteak was ok. Decent. Definitely pretty large. And the steak was good. As was the onions and bread. Just wish the cheese had been added first so that it would be evenly dispersed. Instead it was slapped on top, stuck to the paper wrapping, and not mixed throughout the sandwich at all. It was just on top. Kinda wack. The fries though? Holy shizznit. Awesome. Obviously battered and fried. And old bay seasoning all over them. Heavenly. Do yourself a favor. Get the old bay fries. And ask them to mix the cheese in well on the cheesesteak or put it on first or something. Definitely gonna try this place again and order a different sandwich.",3,,1

They have a solid beer list and an impressive ""Wall of Whiskey"". I love my whiskey...just not during lunch on a weekday...I suppose...lol.I wish I would have known that they had a special (A Select Draft Beer & A Cheesesteak, Chicken Cheesesteak or Broccoli Rabe Sandwich for $12) and I would have taken advantage of it, but instead I ordered their breaded chicken cutlet buffalo sandwich. It comes with two options of buffalo sauces - mild or hot. I went with mild. You can also choose if you would like blue cheese or ranch sauce, I like blue cheese, but I'm a ranch sauce girl at heart so ranch it was.This sandwich was $10 and worth every penny since it was so freakin' big (and thick, yeah yeah - that's what she said). I was only able to eat half and the other half is wrapped up and going to make a fantastic dinner in about an hour.While eating (at the bar since there were no tables during lunch time and tables that seat 4-5 people are reserved for groups of that size...always) I saw a sign that said they have trivia on Monday nights at 8pm and a special of $12 pitchers of Coney Island beer during said trivia. I love bar trivia and am sort've an addict, but not really but kinda. I definitely plan on coming back for this at some point...and for lunch, because my sandwich was definitely up there are far as buffalo chicken sandwiches go.My boss had a cheesesteak and being that this wasn't his first time having it, I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that he's a fan (he's also the one that chose coming here). We shared ""Italian fries"" which came with Italian Seasoning topped with Romano Cheese and they were pretty delicious. Crispy, thick fries and really nicely reasoned without being overbearing. I would like to note that they have Old Bay Seasoning fries. OLD BAY SEASONING. Yeahhh...I definitely have to come back.EDIT 2/10:  They have draft/sandwich specials but they're super specific about which ones (I think it includes their Philly Cheesesteaks and SOME, not all, of their chicken ones). This is pretty stupid since the ""South Philly Style Sandwiches"" part of the menu features sandwiches that are the same price. Not cool and that really takes away for me when I'm here for lunch.

74,Eric J.,"New York, NY",497,923,1710,5.0,10/6/2015,"Likely the best Shorty's location in all of Manhattan in my opinion. Never actually been to the UES location, but I have been to all the others, and I'll make this generalization because the Nomad location is the most centrally located, the space is relatively large, and due to that large space, there's no shortage of roaming staff to take your orders or clean off your tables. As a native of Philadelphia as well as its surrounding suburbs, I always feel at home at Shorty's, and it's just a fun place to be. For Eagles games, despite the larger space, you have to get here at least a couple hours beforehand to ensure a seat at the bar or one of the tables. Otherwise, be prepared to stand for the entire game. That being said, it's actually pretty easy to strike up conversation with the rest of the Philly fans around here, so it definitely helps to pass the time during commercials. There are TVs everywhere, so standing room ain't too bad, since you'll definitely have a view of the game at least somewhere. During Eagles games, there are always loud chants going on, or the occasional Eye of the Tiger or Rocky Theme playing here and there, and it just makes you feel good about life, and that your team is going to win. Whether they actually do win or not, is a different story.As stated in my reviews of other Shorty's locations, the food is just better than your average bar. The dough for their bread for their cheesesteaks is ""imported"" from Philly (from Le Bus Bakery, I believe), and the sandwiches use some quality ingredients like sliced ribeye, broccoli rabe, fried onions, and of course, cheese whiz, the most quality ingredient of them all. The mozzarella triangles and wings are also pretty bomb, as well as the Italian fries. The beer menus are pretty extensive too, although nowadays, I just go with a lager (Yuengling). The prices are actually slightly more expensive than that of most sports bars in the area, but the quality is always a little better, so I can't complain. As mentioned before, there's a lot of staff around on game day, as well as during regular hours, and they're all very friendly and attentive. I'm actually very impressed with how attentive they are, given that most of the sports bars in NYC have mediocre to horrendous service on NFL game day. Shorty's, no matter the location, has easily become my go-to place for all things Philly sports, so obviously I'll be back at this location in the near future.",26,15,21

79,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,9/21/2015,"I'm not sure I'll ever be impartial in reviewing Philly bars. They're simply the best. And Shorty's is no exception. I can't imagine how fans of other NFC East teams can stand coming in here. Actually, I can. Because it's how I feel as a fan of all things Philly in the cold, heartless streets of NYC everyday. I digress - Shorty's is an awesome spot to watch a game. Fantastic crowd, down-to-earth staff and an impressive drink selection.I came here on Sunday for quite possibly the worst game of football I have ever witnessed. But game aside, I still sincerely enjoyed the venue. The space is long and narrow with tables lining the back wall. Fellow Yelper Eric J. was tenaciously committed to getting a table here for the game so thankfully we had a place to sit. I get the sense that to snag a seat, you either have to a) be a regular here (of which there are many) or b) get here quite early. Otherwise, you'll sadly be subjected to standing for 3+ hours. That said, because you're among friends as a Philly fan here, people are really generous. This is more about an homage to Philly, but the camaraderie here is just fantastic. As in, I felt like I could easily give anyone in this bar a hug. And I don't think I've ever felt that way anywhere in New York. So I gotta mention it.Okay, onto some more objective facts (relatively). Can't speak for the food, but I was very impressed by the beer and whiskey lists here. 10 or so craft beers on tap as well as a whole ""Whiskey Wall"". Didn't investigate the rows of whiskey but I was fully satisfied with the beers I tried. They've got a good variety, which I took full advantage of. I still consider myself somewhat of a craft beer noob, so I tried as many as I could (in moderation.....though I almost wish I drank excessively to forget the game I was watching).Service: Top notch. Despite the rowdy fans, servers here are quite attentive. If I worked here I'm sure I'd get caught up in watching the games, so that takes some serious self control. And you get that familial feel there too - because there are so many regulars here, the servers are more like friends who happen to be taking our drink orders. So that's a nice change from your average sports bar.Lastly, no shortage of TVs here. When the Eagles are playing, they're on pretty much every TV. So regardless of where you're stationed, you'll easily be able to watch the game. They leave one or two screens open for other games so if the game is getting out of hand (see: this past Sunday), you can shift your attention elsewhere.Final tip: Bad/inconsistent cell service here. Just something to keep in mind if you're trying to meet up with friends/film the scene on Snapchat/whatever else you may be doing on your phone.",6,4,7

Personally I found the cheesesteak to be a little on the drier side.  However, their Philly Burgers are amazing!  I ordered the Green burger with broccoli rabe, spinach, and provolone.  The cheese was in a melted to perfection, the burger was super juicy and the broccoli rabe, spinach and pickles added just the right amount of texture and flavor.  On top of the sandwiches I also ordered an order of fries- I'm a fan of good fries that don't need extra seasoning and is crisp with every bite.  I waited to finish my burger before attacking the fries and surprisingly, they stayed super crispy!  I must say, the food definitely outweighs the service.

I haven't tried my fair share to make that call, but it was definitely up there. There are many ways to customize your hero: I chose to add hot peppers and mushrooms to my Steak Special with broccoli rabe and provolone. The hero came 15 minutes later wrapped in paper foil and piping hot. First bite had so much flavor that it was getting juice all over my hand (heh heh). At first I couldn't find the mushrooms, but then I realized they were chopped up and mixed in with the meat. As I continued, I alternated adding ketchup and Tabasco sauce to my sandwich, which only made it taste better. We also ordered a basket of old bay fries, which was an interesting combination - it wasn't bad, but not sure if I would get it again.The drinks selection is pretty good. Shorty's has a daily drink special along with happy hour. As we came on a Friday, we partook in the Shorty's beer + Jameson shot special for $10. I'm still not a fan of Jameson (unless it's chased by pickle juice), but the amber beer was actually really good.The service was also really great. The waitress and bartenders were on point and very entertaining and even danced with our drunk friends that showed up much later.

I need to reiterate this : Pretty damn close on point. The Philly had a nice oily consistency but not overly so to make it inedible.  I would say that you can definitely taste the oil that adds a nice moisture texture on the steak itself but it wasn't overpowering.  The steak was DELISH.  The bread definitely from Philly and the quality of it shows.  The cheese in which there are 4 different types available (Whiz, American, Provolone and my personal favorite Pepperjack).  Obviously, I went with Pepperjack and it gave the overall Philly Cheesesteak just the right meltiness, kick, and FLAVOR that complements it oh so well. ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.I came in for their lunch or rather daily special ($13.00) for a Philly Cheesesteak, Chickensteak, or Broccoli Rabe Sandwich WITH a draft beer.  The hours for this special deal is MONDAY-FRIDAY 11am-7pm AND 11pm-CLOSE.  The draft beer selection applying to this deal is standard domestic BUT if you want to choose a different beer not included in the deal for $1 or $2 more you can have have the beer you want.  ***ASK YOUR LOCAL SHORTY'S BARTENDER ABOUT THIS BEFORE ORDERING.***I will be back to try their Chicken Cheesesteak as well as more Philly Cheesesteak.  I can't wait to try their other locations to see if it is quality no matter the location.FAN.",,,

88,Shakira W.,"Brooklyn, NY",142,208,243,3.0,6/14/2016,"So let's get real. Ever since I went to Philly for a wedding and committed the ultimate sin of not getting a philly cheesesteak it has been haunting my tastebuds. Cravings so strong that even when I'm just few weeks from being on vacation (sorry abs) I just had to stop at Shorty's. Walking in I was a little thrown off because even though I had just ran out of work at 5 (arriving at 5:07), there were so many people there that seemed like they were several drinks in and gave it a Friday vibe (it's Tuesday, and there are no tacos here). Maybe this is where people who dont work during the day hang? But anyway, aside from that, the set up is more of a bar where you dine in. After a few turn arounds and finding that I was indeed in the right spot, I located the ""To-Go"" station which is all the way in the back corner surrounded by empty kegs. Even though it says ""To-Go"" it gave me the feeling it was an employees only area. $17 later I ordered fries (regular, since they dont have steak fries) and a cheesesteak with whiz, grilled onions, peppers (you will pay extra), and lettuce because that's how I like it. Since there was only bar seating I headed home with my taste buds doing jumps for joy.I get home, mouth watering and ready and see that the peppers I paid extra for were no where to be found. How sway?! and to make me even more hangry, they didn't even cut the cheesesteak! nor did they slice the bread deep enough because the steak was practically not at all inside the bread. This is definitely not Philly but I guess to a New Yorker this place will do. Overall my excitement turned into a complete disappointment and wasted carbs. *Also, if you are from the Philadelphia area and have had the real thing... if you dare say this is better or remotely close, your street cred is revoked.",1,2,1

The cheese is always good. make sure you ask for the fried onions, cuz it's always good. the italian fries were really good too. crispy but also soft on the inside. delicious, well seasoned. it is kinda expensive though... i don't know if it's worth half a cheesesteak... but still tastyMy friend and I got a cheesesteak each and shared the fries and it was a great meal. definitely hope to come back to try some other sandwiches!",1,,

There's Philadelphia pride all over the place, tons of sports memorabilia and games playing on their T.V's.After trying Tony Luke's philly cheesesteak in motherland of Philadelphia, the standard was set pretty high for me. I ordered their cheesesteak and I was very impressed. The steak was very juicy and flavorsome and the provolone binded the sandwich together very well.

The interior is fairly dark and a bit divey. The beer list is pretty good though with about a dozen beers on tap including some good craft beers and some from PA. If you're a PA transplant, this is probably the place for you. The service is friendly as well and those cheesesteaks are pretty good.",,,

Fries are crisp and tasty, too.  They've also got some impressively cheap drink offerings.",1,1,1

My friend got a Dogside Beer (wasn't good because she is a beer drinker) and I got the pint Black Raspberry Sangria. Boy, if you are a light weight like me, choose something else because they made the Sangria super strong and it got me a dizzy and tipsy lol The servers on the floor were very attentive and the music was pretty kick ass with a mixture of oldies and what's popular.

Came in around 12.15pm on Wednesday and it was very busy, but I managed to find a sneaky spot at the bar. Service was quick, had a Lagunitas while I waited for my old bay fries and chicken cheesesteak. Fries came quick, and they were amazing, crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside all the while cocooned in the delicious flavor of the seasoning, I'm not a fry person, but these were the best. The chicken cheesesteak is breast meat chopped up fine, I had friend onions and American cheese with it, it was very very good, the bread is outstanding, so fresh. Needless to say, I  leaving with a to go bag, lol, to much food and I am very satisfied.While seated at the bar taking my time, at the back is the to go order counter, and there were people walking up and using it.

I would ask them to leave out the Italian hot peppers, or at least add avocado to balance things out. The provolone served little purpose in the flavor profile except for keeping the veggie ingredients together with its gooey texture, and I probably wouldn't miss it in the sandwich if I ordered again (good news for vegans!)The Yuengling onion rings were cut thick and had a thick crusty batter. The skin didn't stay as well to the bigger onion slices, but nonetheless taste great. My only regret is that the order hadn't come with more!",2,,1

It's crazy because this review is actually not for a cheesesteak (haven't tried it from Shorty's yet- I thought it was a BBQ joint for the longest time), it's for the Old Bay Fries.  Wow. I have not seen these much around NYC (well it's a Maryland thing) but these Old Bay Fries are AMAZING.  Only other place I've had them is at seafood joitn Mermain Inn - those are good too but skinny. These are crispy, thick, and the Old Bay spice dispersion was spot on. They even maintained quality while traveling 1 hour (since I did to-go).   You get $5 for a medium size box (portion size is perfect- not too light, not too heavy).  Be sure to get this when you come. I'll be back for the cheesesteak.Service was also prompt (from to go window- which they kindly make available to separate from those dining in), even at 9pm (lateish) on a weeknight.",3,,

The pizza steak was fantastic and so were the chicken tenders.  Prices are extremely great for NYC. $11 for amazing cheesesteaks, $5 for a bucket of the best fries that lie on the east coast and good beer options.It's a must stop!! For a sports bar, it is clean and well taken care of! Please note- these guys do not serve any pizzas! That's why we wanted to go there in the beginning but this food beats a NY pizza any day.

Got a wiz without with mushrooms...with extra wiz on the side of course. Oh. My. God. The wiz is just plain tasty and the bread is ON POINT.

Total order can cost you $20 dollars very easily.So I order a basic cheesesteak with whiz and fries. The service was pretty fast since 1) the place wasn't very crowded 2) its just chopped meat on bread with cheese and onions (nothing really complicated here). The waitresses were normal - very low key and doing their jobs. Nothing extraordinary here. So I bite into it and the cheese melts into my mouth with this meat and I realize....its an average cheese steak. There just wasn't anything special. My friend had the chicken club and she said it was below average too. On top of being burnt, she said it tasted bland.I've had better for half the price. I guess being New York the prices match but price/quality ratio is poor here. Just get chipotle next door...a burrito might satisfy your taste buds more.",,1,

This immediately made me skeptical as i wouldn't expect to walk into a bar and have a true grimy cheesesteak. However I was wrong...The cheesesteak here isn't on the Philly level, but its delicious. It had all the staples of good cheesesteak and caught me completely off guard. I had mine with the usual hot peppers and a little ketchup and enjoyed every bite of it. I also had an order of seasoned fries that were delicious. Not too much salt, just the right amount to make it a good addition to the cheesesteak.When you're used to getting cheesesteaks in Philly from hole in the wall places, you would never look at this place and suspect you could get a great one here.

The mozzarella triangles & the happy hour drinks are the only redeeming items. $5 Ketel One & $4 beers= yes please! It's when I go to eat anything more that, ultimately I'm disappointed.Many friends, including my bf, a Philly native and cheesesteak aficionado, swear by these cheesesteaks in NYC. I find them either bland or overly seasoned, nothing in between.Mediocre service and a disgusting food situation put me over the edge when I was there this week.3 employees and their friend stood around one end of the bar, making themselves some drinks, one employee even eating a yogurt, talking amongst themselves. The male bartender seemed to be the only one actually working for a while, and he was good. I ordered marinara sauce on the side for my cheesesteak (it didn't come of course, and I had to ask again), which, can we discuss the $1 charge for that? Sweet/hot peppers (actual food sides) are on the menu for 50c each, but sauce is $1?!The Italian fries were tasteless, despite the alleged seasoning. My cheesesteak just tasted like pepper, which was bitter and unpleasant. The bread was soggy. Then, about halfway thru my cheesesteak, I BIT INTO A HAIR. It was cooked in the middle of the sandwich. So gross. Luckily, once I finally waved down the bartender, she actually did the right thing and removed it from the bill without my having to ask. My appetite was ruined at that point, and I'm quite certain I'll never eat here again.I find the food slightly better at the Upper East Side location, but overall, theses cheesesteaks never seem to be worth eating.

I had the buffalo chicken cheesesteak. She had the cheesesteak with provolone and sweet peppers. We shared some sweet potato fries. My chicken cheesesteak had the coolness of ranch (the hell with that devil business of blue cheese), and the heat of buffalo sauce.

STARS, STRIPES, CHEESESTEAKS, AND BEER! this is why we won World War Two.the menu is pub food. it's probably among the best damn pub food I've had ever. this was perfect, because Caroline and I were meeting up with one of my friends who just spent a year in Australia and has missed American-style heart-killing cooking.we kicked things off with Yuengling-battered fried onion rings and Italian fries. the onion rings were awesomely crunchy, not too soggy. the fries were perfect; dusted with a liberal amount of parmesan cheese and spices, and the right balance of crunch and  softness.several options for cheesesteaks here. you can get basic ones, or more decadent styles. like a moth drawn to flame, I pursued the honey chipotle steak with pepper jack and threw on sweet peppers for just 75 cents extra. back in my college days, I could house one of these in under a minute, but in my old age I have learned that food is meant to be appreciated.the texture was right, the portion size was ridiculous (served on freshly-shipped-from-Philly bread), and the flavor was ridiculous. cheesesteaks will run you about ten bucks or more, but they are hefty! you can always just eat half for lunch and half for dinner, but I have a hard time comprehending the meaning of ""portion control"" on weekends.the beers - yeah, you can get Bud or Miller if you're a CHUMP - but why do that when Dogfish, Delirium, Lagunitas, Southampton, and many more testaments to the diversity of beer are on hand here? prices aren't bad either.service was laid-back, friendly, and relaxed (there were only two servers in the place). they didn't mind that we were there for several hours. specials throughout the week, like deals on shots or cheesesteak/beer combos.the music? perhaps it was just that day, but it was a solid lineup of 90s rock awesomeness. we were all happy with that.I will most definitely be going back to Shorty's to eat more cheesesteaks, drink more delicious beers, and be all that I can be. thank you, good night, and good luck!",3,7,4

I was a little disappointed. It was a sunny day on Saturday. I thought I would eat in the park so I place my to go order. The cheesesteak had no flavor. It was basically meat and cheese on a roll. There was definitely no wow factor. It's not a good thing if your fries are better than the cheesesteak you are suppose to be famous for. Yes, the fries were good. Do I think they were worth $4? Nope. If I'm going to spend $4 on fries they better be flowing out the box. Quality of the fries was decent but the quantity was lacking. I've experienced better.",,,
172,Steven G.,"Brooklyn, NY",23,292,0,2.0,10/2/2012,"Went to the E.31 Street location. Holy Cow! A $5. cheesesteak for $9. Only about five inches long and $9.  A pretty BAD value. Carl's, a few blocks away and especially Shaggy's in Staten Island are much better values. In Phila. a nine inch cheesesteak cost $7.50. OK, this is not Philly. The taste of this ""mini"" cheesesteak was not bad, so they earned a star for their taste. The ""plain fries"" were also bland and had a taste that I did not like. The order was large and cost $4.00.  Perhaps larger than most people would want.. When fries are not good, the order is often too large for me. My advice: Make the cheesesteak nine inches long. It would be a decent (but not great) value for $9.00.  You may get one or two more stars with some value for the money.",,,

I had the special which was cheesesteak (wiz this time), Italian fries, and a blue moon beer.  That's was absolutely awesome.  For me a little pricey for lunch as I usually work in Westchester but well worth it.  The friend I had lunch with had a salad...way to make me feel fat, salad was huge and looked delicious! Overall great experience at this location of shorties. I wish I had gotten the bartender name because she was great too (brunette).  Thankfully we sat on her side because the first bartender was not helpful at all and a little dismissive (blonde).",,,

The bread was fantastic, as was the flavor of the sandwich ingredients.

Although a little skimpy on the meat, the flavor is what you'd come to expect from a nice Philly cheesesteak; whiz and fried onions abound.My main gripe, besides lack of beef, is the fact that their french fries are, like Rihanna, battered (too soon?). Anyway, I know this is a preference thing, but I'm a potato purist and I appreciate a crispy, simple, salty fry. Battered fries are way too heavy and greasy and make me feel like I need a shower after consuming them. I gave my entire fry order away to my coworkers.I ordered delivery and it took over an hour to get to me, so the food arrived cold.

But here at Shorty's, I think I may have found the best steak I've had anywhere...even the ones that I've had in Philly. This looks like a pretty new joint opened right off the corner of 27th and Madison, and the interior is a winner - nice new barstools and elevated chairs to sit at, plenty of standing room to accommodate a crowd, and for the sports lovers out there - probably 15 well-sized flatscreens wall to wall above the bar and along the wall where the booths are. I can imagine this being paradise on Sunday afternoons in the fall.As for the food itself - in short, awesome. I've never paid attention to the rolls much for steaks before, but I'll be damned if you can't tell the difference between a freshly baked steak roll and the crunchy, crispy, day(s)-old rolls that most places use. The steak isn't ground as much as I've had elsewhere, but it's still succulent and juicy, particularly when you do it right and get some Cheez Whiz slathered all on it! That's heaven in a warm roll there, all for $9. It's a little pricier than Carl's or 99 Miles to Philly, but it is unquestionably superior in quality. My girlfriend got the roast pork special, which is also ridiculously good. Stuffed with delicious broccoli rabe, provolone (sharp or mild - your choice), and au jus on the side (a very nice gourmet touch that adds flavor back to the pork), this is a winner of a dish.I will definitely be coming back here. After this, I don't even know if I want to go back to Philly and stand in line at Pat's. When this is a mere 2 blocks away from my place, I think I've found the new cheesesteak love of my life. Their beer selection is also impressive (who else has Delirium Tremens on tap?! I've never seen it before). It's a great addition to what is generally a sleepy part of Madison Avenue and the NoMad (is that the right name?) area.",5,1,2

Shorty's just might make it.Philly cheesesteaks are the draw here, but there are other things on the menu and there's a full bar, with an impressive selection of beers, bourbons, and single-malt scotches. It's a small but nice-looking place, with most of the seating at the bar; lots of TVs, should be a fun place when there's a game on, or even if there's not. A nice addition to a block where everyone wants to be a lounge.Shorty's claims to have the most authentic cheesesteaks in town, with bread brought in from Philly each day. To be honest, I like Carl's a little bit better, but this was a close second. The Italian seasoned fries were crisp and molto delicious.So here's to you, Shorty's. Hope you stick around.",5,,

189,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,4.0,9/13/2013,"Philly is the home to the cheesesteak, but Philly is also two hours away. When one longs for a mighty cheesesteak around Manhattan, we got Shorty's. Shorty's is your all-American sports bar that serves up Philly style cheesesteaks. You come here to have a beer, watch the sports games on the wall to wall flat screen TVs, and gratify yourself with a Philly style cheesesteak. Awesome.Be bad and order your cheesesteak with Wiz. However, they do offer it with the option of American cheese or Provolone, and with or without fried onions. I ordered it with Provolone because I tend to avoid the 'less healthier' options, but my guest, who ordered it with the Wiz, had the better of the two cheesesteaks, obviously. The focus of Shorty's cheesesteak remains in the Philadelphia imported bread they use, which is very fresh and pillow soft. The roast pork is juicy, tender and tastes amazing slathered in the melted layers of cheese. May I add that the Old Bay fries here are worth having as a side; crispy, hot, perfectly seasoned, and pairs nicely with the cheesesteak. They have a full bar and a good amount of domestic beers on tap. While cheesesteak is their main highlight, they have a menu that includes many other things such as South Philly hoagies, a short list of sliders, and a selection of salads. Also, while pork is default meat for the cheesesteak, they offer chicken options as well.The night I was here, a Jets game was on, and you bet it was jam-packed and extremely noisy. That might be the one major negative because there's no real system for a table wait if you are a walk-in, and a wait could honestly be forever. The system is to just simply wait by a table or seats at the bar and snatch at the first opportunity. They do take reservations, however. Note: if you come here from 11AM to 7PM or 11PM until closing, they offer a $12 deal on cheesesteak plus beer. They also have weekend brunch options from 11AM to 2PM.",8,1,6

191,Benjamin C.,"New York, NY",61,110,2,1.0,3/6/2014,"Please be advised, the stuff I'm about to sling is based only on their roast pork. My philosophy is that Philly cheese i pretty standard everywhere but roast pork is hard to master. You have been warned because I'm about to sling a lot of mud.Shorty's is the perfect name for this place because they fell short on the roast pork. I wouldn't even say it's an homage to roast pork because I didn't even feel like they were trying. The menu says the breads from Philly and I felt like that was their only redeemable quality.Some background is I spent some time in Philly and am a gigantic fan of Dinics in the Reading Terminal. It is THE place to get your roast pork, broccoli rabe and sharp provolone. First off the sandwich was small and over priced. The pork was bland and for some reason they gave you a small cup with pork juice to dip. I guess logistically it made sense for take out but.....no. The broccoli rabe was this sad looking booger green colored chopped up mess with no bitterness a rabe should be. Lastly the fucking cheese was a melted mess. True sharp provolone doesn't melt that easily and I've tasted Brie sharper than the provolone I was given. Three distinct flavors were not found in this one sandwich. Did they originate from Philly or were they kicked out?I would come back because the bar seemed cool, nice place to watch the game, plenty of fried food but the main reason is I want to try their philly cheese...and see if they managed to fuck it royally.",,2,
192,Franny A.,"New York, NY",840,1280,1046,3.0,11/2/2011,A sports bar that serves a wide array of cheesesteak and the like options.Hoagies are fresh from Philly which if you are an aficionado makes a difference.Cheese steaks with whiz or provolone are $9 with onions.  I had the cheese steak with cheese fries($5) and everything was fresh and tasty.  Service was very attentive and you can watch the games and soak up that meat with some beer as there is a special of beer and steak before 7 for $12.,1,,2

It's a great place to watch games, and the staff has always been super friendly to our group. It's also the only place I would order a cheesesteak outside of Philly. (They import the bread!)",,,

Delivery takes an hour (no matter what they tell you)  Note: I am 1/2 block outside the delivery range for the only 2 locations in my area ...But they always deliver to me. If you eat at the Maddison ave location you will find a friendly fast staff.",2,,

I do wish I could come here more often.The food is excellent. Cheese fries and cheese steaks are delicious. It's a great place to be when you want to catch a game with a few buddies.",,,
198,Jason M.,"Campbell Hall, NY",52,71,30,3.0,9/28/2015,"Those looking to go here, be warned, the menu has changed!  Cheesesteak is average, nothing to write home about.  Bread was fresh and so was the ingredients.",,,
199,Scott H.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,38,36,3.0,2/19/2015,"I don't think it's that bad, it just had some heavy comparison faults. If they just didn't insist it was as authentic to the real deal, it would have been better then it was.  When you compare, I just not there. The bread had a crusty top. It should be super soft. And with no whole or sliced hot peppers available is a sin. Offering chopped is just not the way.  they're meant to blow your face off. The ones served, really? Feh. But with good people and good music, it's good, but don't call it authentic.",,,
