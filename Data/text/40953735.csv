0,Patricia H.,"Hartsdale, NY",4,93,0.0,4.0,7/27/2018,Love their whole wheat bagels. Wayyyyy better than their plain bagel if you ask me!Also have been here for lunch.  They give a little appetizer (bread with tomato and other seasonings) - it was delicious but can be eaten in one bite.  The roast chicken was OK - a little dry.The Caesar salad was pretty good.,,,1
1,Darya M.,"Long Island, NY",54,64,16,4.0,11/7/2018,"Me and a friend were shopping at Saks when we decided to grab a bite to eat. Now there are tons of options around this area but we figured lets hit the RF Center area. We chose this spot mainly because it wasnt super busy and the food being served looked good. We were seated promptly and the waiter asked us for our drink orders. We both opted for water and lemon. Because we both wanted a lighter fare, we ordered salads. I got the goat cheese and arugula salad with grilled chicken. It was delicius. Not sure what dressing they used, but it was super fresh and tasty. The goat cheese was crumbling just the right amount and the walnuts were nice and roasted. Im usually picky with grilled chicken but it was generously seasoned with salt and pepper! The staff was ok, but next time would opt for a different item on the menu (maybe a dinner item). Area is great and theres iceskating! Only downside is it's in a very touristy area and get very crowded!",1,1,2

3,Ed A.,"Jersey City, NJ",239,386,43,3.0,2/16/2018,"Summary: lots to choose from, but average taste at bestCucina has a lot of good things, and a lot of not-so-good things going for it. It's like a battle of good vs evil, dark side vs light side (for you Star Wars fans), Yankees vs Mets (for you New Yorkers), Giants vs Patriots (for you decent human beings located outside of New England). At best I can say that the battle ends in a draw, and with it, an ""ok"" 3 star rating:Pro: wide variety of lunchtime foods (sandwiches, soups, hot plates, daily specials, salad)Con: most of the food is very bland. The sandwiches in particular are a low point - I think I'd prefer Toasties or PotbellyPro: usually a quick line - not a long waitCon: Prices are expensivePro: it's 10% off if you use the Cucina mobile appCon: they always run out of the Clam Chowder on Fridays during Lent. Always!!!",,,
4,Malia K.,"Honolulu, HI",277,123,45,3.0,1/3/2018,Thankful to find this place on Open table.  Had been looking for many days on yelp and open table trying to find a restaurant close to Rockefeller center that would accommodate our family.  We had a party of 9.  And we had 2 senior citizens and 2 picky eaters... For days I had called and tried to make reservations to no success.  Everyone told me due to the holiday high season they would not accommodate us.  We wanted to have dinner as a group since it was our last day together in the city and we were celebrating 2 birthdays.  As we sat down to our show at Radio City Music Hall I figured I'd check open table one more time.  Did another search for our party size and time and low and behold this restaurant could accommodate us.  Thankful!When we arrived another group was just leaving and they quickly set up our table.  Our server was efficient but did forget a couple of our drink requests.I liked the Cesar salad and onion soup I ordered but the bolonase pasta I ordered needed more flavor but it was service able.  I also got the key lime pie.  It was nice and creamy but I like a more tart lime taste.  My family got a variety of items on the menu and they all generally seemed happy with their meals.,,,
5,Dolores D.,"Phoenix, AZ",237,472,2749,5.0,11/30/2017,"Went to visit the top of the rock and was looking for a place to eat and found this place. It was pretty packed you can sit down and they have another place if you want food on the go which they have more to choice from like soups and salads to other entrees. They did decorate for Christmas which looked cute. The food was super delicious. It is a bit pricey but pretty reasonable cause it's New York. They had a great deal for $36 which was an appetizer, a drink, entree and dessert. The Ceaser salad was amazing and the entree was really good and so was the dessert. They do not give refills. It's $4 for a drink. Kid meals are $20. Also they give you 3 options to tip at the end. Definitely will go again.",,,
6,Kimberly H.,"Queens, NY",182,385,1495,2.0,4/16/2017,"Made reservations for lunch during the weekday and experienced how accurate the overall Yelp rating of 2.5 was. Even though we were seated immediately it took a while for our server to come. It seemed pretty busy during peak lunch time. The server took our drink and food orders and we waited for a while for our drinks to be served. We ordered one glass of wine and one iced tea but it took about 20 or so minutes to arrive. I watched a lot of the servers bring trays of drinks to other tables but I guess ours were forgotten. We shared the New England clam chowder for the appetizer which came out pretty quickly. It was the soup of the day. It was creamy and tasted okay. The first entree of pesto pasta with chicken came out next and it was a pretty large serving. Our second entree of fish and chips didn't arrive until much later and we had to remind our waiter for it. I think it was also forgotten because once we asked for it we received the dish within 5 minutes. It was too hot to eat. Again, the serving was pretty large. Service was pretty shoddy throughout the meal. Everything you thought couldn't go wrong went wrong. Missing drink orders, missing entree, no bread and butter, no water refills and just in general poor service. At the end the waiter did apologize and blamed it on the busy lunch service. Next time if I'm around 30 rock I'll pick somewhere else to eat.",,,
7,Caroline D.,"Santa Monica, CA",118,137,78,4.0,10/26/2017,"Okay so the food is average, BUT, what makes this place really special is that all of the perishable food becomes half off after 5pm. We always go down here to snag dinner or lunch for the next day. My picks are the salmon salad and the half roasted chicken that come with two sides (I opt for the mashed potatoes & roasted veggies). The best part? You can get both for less than $10.",3,,
8,Amber F.,"Collierville, Memphis, TN",59,8,2,1.0,11/11/2017,"Rude people. Lied to us. We asked for a booth because there were many empty ones. They said they were all full for a big reservation. Then, we watched as they slowly filled them all up, with parties of 2.... not together.",,1,
9,Joshua F.,"Edgewater, NJ",0,10,2,1.0,12/22/2017,"Pros: tables available at lunch on a Friday (now I know why). Cons: pretty much everything else. Service when the place is empty took 10 minutes just to place a drink order and it went downhill from there. Server did not know the menu, items ordered were not delivered, 'medium' steak might as well be called 'Trump' and come with ketchup it was so over cooked. Verdict: avoid this place and eat at a falafel cart.",,,
10,Willie W.,"Antwerp, NY",0,75,236,4.0,11/19/2017,"We were tourists in NYC for the first time and we were lost, tired and hungry.  After finally finding the restrooms we wandered around and finally found a place to sit.  In fact, even though every other place was packed, we got right in to Cucina and Co.They have a somewhat small menu, but that must be how they move people through do fast.  It wasn't even ten minutes after we placed our orders that the food was in front of us.My burger was cooked exactly to order on a toasted bun, with a hefty pickle and crispy fries.  My wife had the steak panino. It was tasty, and big enough that she finished it on the bus ride home.The staff was friendly and welcoming, and we got refills on our diet Coke without asking.",,,

Food was okay for the money you'll spend here you could eat somewhere nicer with better food and better serving. DON'T RECOMMEND AT ALL! We ended up paying the tip however turns out our waiter was only scamming us.",1,,
14,T T.,"Hoboken, NJ",17,276,42,3.0,12/5/2017,"This is underground at Rockefeller Center. It's next to more high-end restaurants and a Starbucks. They have an area for take out (there are tables just outside the place -- all indoors) and an area for sit down service. This is not a ""fine dining"" place and it is not cheap but it's very clean. I go here for coffee and dessert (to-go) and sit at the general tables in the mall. 3.5 stars overall.",1,,
15,Melissa V.,"Valley Stream, NY",1,2,0,2.0,2/20/2018,"All three people in my party had issues with the food and the dishes had to be sent back. Food is ok. Service is alright, food took a while the first time to get to us and even longer the second. Not worth the price. Probably won't be back.",,,
16,Angel G.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",7,43,4,5.0,10/11/2017,Decided last minute to stop and eat here.  It was an excellent choice.  Food was fresh and very flavorful.  I ordered penne caprese with shrimp and it was delicious.  The bruschetta is also excellent.  We came here for lunch and it was great.  Very nice wait staff.  I'll visit again next time I'm in NYC.,1,,
17,Coaster C.,"Monkton, MD",0,114,0,3.0,12/13/2017,"This is your typical grill and pub style restaurant. They serve burgers, fish, and salads. Nothing really to write home about though but good if you can get seated right away.",,,

19,Steve D.,"Lone Tree, CO",4,7,1,1.0,1/11/2017,"My wife ordered the salmon. Due to her dairy allergy she had to order it without any sauce. However, when it arrived it wasn't seasoned in ANY WAY. No salt, pepper or anything other than plain cooked salmon. She is allergic to dairy NOT flavor!  I ordered the chicken parmigiana. It was pedestrian. The side of spaghetti was only a little better than canned spaghetti. To top it off they charge $3.50 for a small glass of coke and don't refill the drinks. What does it cost for a refill of coke 5¢ ?  Not worth your time. Stay away!",1,1,
20,Philip M.,"San Francisco, CA",404,786,1109,2.0,4/27/2015,"My girlfriend and I were trying to find lunch around the Rockefeller Plaza after doing some touristy stuff. When we came upon Cucina & Co, we decided to head in there for lunch. I expected to pay high exorbitant prices for an average quality meal, considering we were in Rockefeller Plaza. What we got was a poor quality meal for a good price. I paid almost $12 for a half-chicken entree with two sides. It was inexpensive, but the quality of food was terrible. The chicken was too dry to eat, except for the drumstick portion. The mashed potatoes were too runny, there was no fluffy consistency. The side vegetables? the best part of the meal lol. Gf got the clam chowder. It was almost a pint's worth for a little under $5. She said it wasn't very good. I tried some of it too and thought even the Progressive can Clam Chowder taste better than the chowder at Cucina & Co. I love the cafeteria-feel to this place. There's hot foods, salad bar and a drink station. You select everything you want and pay at the check-out lines. Sadly, the food preparation here could use some work.",,,
21,K. O.,"Spokane, WA",0,107,1,3.0,10/2/2017,"Visited NYC with friends and found ourselves at Rockefeller Center at lunch time.  We couldn't all agree on where to eat but Cucina & Co. had a bit of everything.  There were hot meals, sandwiches, soups, salad bar, etc.  Two different checkout areas made for quick payment.  The deli in located on the ice rink level of the Center and there is a seating area right pass the checkouts.",,,
22,Rohit K.,"Baltimore, MD",0,1,0,2.0,4/5/2018,"This is probably one of the lesser restaurants in New York that I've eaten at. They provided us with a buffet that consisted of frozen watery chicken Parmesan with dry chicken, the vegetables were watery and over cooked and did not look appetizing. The pasta tasted okay, but could have been cooked better. The bread was cold and not fresh. While I understand that it is hard to provide for a large group, the food could have been better, but the service was good.",,,
23,R R.,"Parlin, NJ",7,41,12,1.0,1/26/2017,"Disgusting! I went here for lunch today and was SO DISAPPOINTED. It is as if this place knows NOTHING about SALT and/or PEPPER! Two very BASIC ingredients to give food some damn flavor. This was the blandest white food I have ever had. I ordered the sesame roasted 1/2 chicken (sticky skin, yet bland taste), mac n cheese (where is the DAMN salt man?!?! and despite the color, I was pressed to find any cheese) and mashed potatoes (they don't use milk or salt in them) with a small dollop of gravy (at least it made the potatoes creamier). That was $11.50+tax right down the drain. I had to hit up Tri-Tip for some fries to hold me over until dinner. DO NOT GO for any lunch or dinner options.",,,
24,Malini A.,"Enola, PA",82,303,980,2.0,12/29/2016,Located on the concourse level of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Was very crowded in December. Service was slow because of being so busy and finding a seat  was also difficult. Tried their mozzarella and tomato panini -  was average. Not a great place,,,
25,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",950,1044,25525,2.0,1/6/2014,"Came here on Sunday with my boyfriend, his brother, his niece and nephew who were in town from Milford (or Middlefield...I forget - all these towns begin to sound the same after awhile). After doing some site-seeing around Rockefeller Center with them we developed quite an appetite...and that's putting it mildly...it was like 1ish and I hadn't eaten anything all day, plus dinner the night before was like 5 pieces of chicken the size of McDonald's chicken nuggets, lol. I was ready to eat a cow.This isn't exactly a neighborhood filled with culinary greatness and the first thing that popped into my head was Cucina & Co. Years ago during my make-up artist days in Herald Square, I was OBSESSED with the Cucina & Co. in Macy's cellar. Their ""make your own pasta"" station was sinfully amazing! They made their alfredo, marinara basil and vodka sauces on the premises, offered different types of pastas, delicious add-ones like blackened chicken, shrimp and more. The shrimp scampi was amazing, reasonably priced and a fantastic portion which sometimes because both my lunch and dinner. Unfortunately this Cucina & Co. is the complete opposite. It was so disappointing and I was embarrassed at how dismal it was.So the actual location is fine. Everything looks relatively clean, well stocked and the people in the kitchen were friendly. The food offering in the rotisserie section were sparse...I was going to get chicken tenders but I was told it would take about 20 minutes, despite there being about 10 in front of me...they were old and apparently just there for display purposes. Kudos to them for the warning I suppose.I ended up getting their mac n' cheese as did my bf's niece. The boy ordered their chicken lasagna, his nephew got and brother (I think) got the baked ziti and they ordered a large order of fries for them to share.The Mac and cheese was decent...considering that it could have been worse. My order was freshly out of the oven, something tells me that in about an hour it might have been awful. It wasn't creamy, overly cheesy or crispy anywhere. I like my mac n' cheese creamy with a crispy, baked top layer...doesn't have to be overly cheesy as long as the flavor is there. The flavor was there because yours truly used two packs of the black pepper that came with my plastic cutlery. I would have given anything for some Cholula sauce. But again, it could have been worse right?The boy's grilled chicken lasagna was pretty decent. I had about two bites and was pleasantly surprised at how it wasn't shredded chicken meat mixed up in a watered down tomato sauce, but there was actually a breaded chicken cutlet inside which served as its own layer. It might have even been breaded with Italian herbed breadcrumbs...it had what my mac n' cheese lacked...FLAVOR. It only they could work in some of that breadcrumb into the mac n' cheese casserole dish. His nephew dug into his baked ziti and seemed to like it. If I had to judge it visually, it looked a little dry and the sauce looked weird. Lol.The fries (of which I only had about 4 or 5) were really salty and oddly buttery. My boyfriend commented that they were very similar to Burger King's fries. I haven't eaten there in what feels like years, but I DO remember not being particularly fond of their fries (or their food I'm general) because there were way too salty. Considering how lackluster our food was it was almost hurtful at how much everything was. My flavorless mac n' cheese was $9, for a crappy serving and for something that I could have made better with a Kraft instant box. I had actually made homemade (not it of a box) mac n' cheese the afternoon prior and it definitely kicked Cucina & Co.'s butt. Maybe they should hire me on a consultancy basis, lol. The baked ziti and grilled chicken lasagna squares were pretty small and not dense enough to justify the size of it - also $9. I hate feeling like I was overcharged for something that's subpar.Also as I mentioned above, the kitchen staff was pretty friendly - the lady at the register was not. I mean she really couldn't ring up my overpriced bland n' cheese, I mean - mac n' cheese on the right side? I seriously had to walk around - I'm not a tourist, but I feel bad for tourists that do come here because it's such a poor reflection of NYC and embarrassingly so for being a part of the Rockefeller Center experience. I'll never be back here again if I can help it. In heading to the nearby restroom I came across a ""Bill's Burger"" chain restaurant, really wish I would have known about it because I bet it's eons better than this Cucina & Co. 2 stars and that's cuz I valued the opportunity to not starve and stay warm in the seating atrium outside of this craphole.",2,1,1
26,Sally S.,"Coppell, TX",0,2,0,1.0,12/17/2017,"DONT GO!!!!!!!!!! We tried to order chicken tenders and the waiter (who was also the manager) denied our order saying ""no."" He then said that it was a kids menu only and we could not order it even though there was no age limit on the menu. We were even willing to pay extra for the tenders!!! Highly do not reccomend. Very rude people.",,,
27,Yasmin P.,"Astoria, NY",13,12,1,5.0,11/24/2017,"This review is mostly about the service I received when visiting Cucina, which at times can be just as important as the food itself. First off, let me say this place is located in the heart of the city, so it is ALWAYS busy and packed. Always. So if you're looking for a nice quiet meal away from people, go somewhere else, but also, it's your own fault- you shouldn't be in Rockefeller Center to begin with. Secondly, if you do brave the hordes of people, get the Burrata and Toasted Peppers- perfection! Anyway, back to my point- the service.  Imagine my surprise when I wander in, expecting a zoo-like experience and instead get greeted by a warm, gracious smile and top notch service from my waitress. Was it peak lunch-time? Yup. Was she swamped? Probably. Did she let it show? Not in the least. I know she must have had a million other things to take care of just based on the constant flow of people, but I watched as she treated each table as if they were her only priority. As a former industry person, I know I can be a really picky diner when it comes to my judgement of service. This young lady stood out to me enough to merit her own yelp review. Thank you to Nancy.",,,
28,Pam S.,"Anderson, SC",0,3,0,1.0,1/6/2018,"On our first visit to Cucina, during the Blizzard, my husband and I ordered chicken noodle soup and a grilled cheese. The soup tasted liked canned only with no flavor. The next day I only needed to purchase two waters. The girl at the front register was putting something on a shelf out of a box and told me to walk to the back of the place because she was busy. The young lady at this register was one of the rudest people I encountered in NYC. She was so rude to the lady in front of me and then acted like she was doing me such a favor to take my money. By the time I walked to the front of the place the other young lady was checking people out. I understand they deal with tourists all day but if you dislike your job that much find another one.",,,
29,Carol C.,"San Antonio, TX",0,4,0,5.0,12/13/2017,"Really had a great lunch at Cucina & Co Cafe today - the rotisserie chicken was delicious and satisfying on every level.  For dessert, the cheesecake with raspberry sauce was absolutely incredible.  Best was the service from Dante and Hannah, two individuals dedicated to their craft of providing quality service even during busy times.",,,
30,Genie G.,"Scottsdale, AZ",71,241,934,3.0,12/8/2015,"Overpriced and overcrowded with marginal service. I had a turkey club salad which was very good, but the fresh pepper I asked for came when I was about 1/3 into my meal. Extra dressing requested by my lunch companion came in even later. We were informed of missing menu items only after we tried ordering them.  The restaurant puts on a check a suggests minimum tip of 18% (going up to 23%) - I took it as a bad joke as the service was barely deserving of a minimum gratuity. Although the food in this place seems to be good, I will not be back - the overall experience is not worth it.  Wait service - 1 star; food and host - 5 stars.",2,3,2
31,Lincy T.,"Dumont, NJ",15,28,42,3.0,11/21/2016,"The food here is not amazing nor does it suck.  The service is good but the prices are kind of horrendous.  For example, today I ran down to get lunch and ordered a tuna melt and fries from the sandwich station.  The lady gave me my tuna melt but no fries and when I told her I had asked for fries, she told me they didn't have any.  I was like...well why didn't you tell me that when I ordered??  Whatever the case, I was in a time crunch so I grabbed a bag of chips and went to pay.  My tuna melt and bag of potato chips cost me $12.45.  And then when I came upstairs...there was no melt...my sandwich was cold!  So overall, you don't really get much for what you're paying but it's good if you're in a pinch or don't want to go outside and look for something that's really worthwhile.",1,,

Not hard to mess up a panini. But it was awful, dry meat, no sauce for flavor. Tasted like burnt bread. Asked for some pesto mayo, but that was not a option for some reason. So they brought me Chipotle mayo which helped, but not like pesto mayo does. Wife's salad had dry chicken, which was the worst salad yet. Co-worker ordered pizza, and being a local, was disappointed with it. Service was worth more then the food. That panini was maybe worth $3 not $17. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",,,

I've tried everything from the rotisserie chicken, rice bowls, to pasta specials and have been disappointed every single time. Including a drink, you will spend about $15 on a very poor meal.

The food is Magnificent, from their Pasta down to the Mac and cheese (which is my personal favorite). The Host seated us fairly quickly and their wait staff was nothing but polite the entire time. I highly recommend if your in the area and would like a bite to eat before you continue your destination. The food is a bit pricey, but only as much as you would expect from the city. I dont recommend seating for a long period of time though, during lunch hour, a line would start to build up and it would sort of be your fault :D although I doubt They would up right kick you out the restaurant.

42,Cristal B.,"Washington, DC",1,2,0,1.0,11/12/2016,"This must be the worst place on the Rockefeller Center area. I went for dinner with my family, 3 adults and my 10-year old daughter. After we sat down to have dinner, she wanted to eat something she bought and the waitress came by and asked her to stand up and leave the restaurant. We said that she was a child that she could not just leave and the waitress said, that this was policy, that my daughter could not stay there. She asked my child to leave the restaurant. It is unbelievable, completely humiliating, and beyond reproach that they would kick out a 10-year old child from a restaurant while the adults sat to have dinner. If you want to have a pleasant experience, where children ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST, DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE. This must have been the worst dining experience. Unbelievably, the manager indicated he would take responsibility and that he was okay with the actions of the waitress. In fact, when I asked to speak with someone above him he refused. I wish the owner would have been present because I am absolutely certain, their behavior would have differed.

44,Vickie R.,"Clarksville, IN",0,8,0,1.0,8/8/2017,"This place is a joke. I would rate it negative stars if I could. My daughter and I had to use the restroom and we were constantly referred to this place. We walked in being friendly and the staff was so rude. We asked to use the restroom if we bought something and the lady we asked laughed and asked if we were serious. We said ""yes we really need to go so we don't miss our tour.""  The lady look at us and said that we weren't allowed to because it was against their policy but we could use one that was 3 blocks away. As we walked away she yelled at us to tell the people that referred us there to stop telling people to use their place as a restroom. It was for paying customers only, after we offered to buy stuff to use the restroom. She was rude and it was uncalled for. I will not go back there and would happily stand in front of the place and tell people how unpleasant the place is and how rude the service is.",,,
45,Manuel G.,"Wollongong, Australia",0,1,0,1.0,4/11/2016,Only gave one star because the waitress was so nice. Food is overpriced and horrible.

For my entree I had an amazing Grilled Chicken Paillard shaved fennel and baby arugula salad. I passed on the dessert after such a wholesome lunch. The salad was REALLY good. I typically don't go for salad's but this one was definitely impressive in my book.Our waiter was a little distracted and all over the place. The restaurant was fairly packed,  but nothing too crazy from my perspective. So that is the only part that took away from my experience here. I love the fact that Cucina and Co. could be a casual walk through or a sit down, it makes it more appealing at any given occasion. Not to mention it's central location.",4,,

50,Rowena Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",478,1158,545,4.0,5/5/2011,"Not sure why this place got such low ratings but I'm a fan of their fruit salad bar. They have fresh cantelopes, melons, strawberries, grapes and pineapples.  You know how sometimes certain places have the mixed fruits already pre-packaged for you and everything either tastes sour or bitter? Well, this place doesn't do that which I really appreciate.  You can pick and however much you want. It's a bit pricey (it's weighed)but you get the quality freshness. I also tried their breakfast sandwich this morning - bacon and egg on a roll. Nothing spectacular but I appreciate the Director chef coming out and making the sandwich for me. mmm bacon..it's what keeps my morning going.",1,,2
51,Mariana V.,"Queens, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/14/2016,"I meant to write sooner but I only have to say. Absolutely outstanding service! I came in on Saturday night was a little busy but hostess managed to accommodate me and my husband just cozy enough, very welcoming environment, she was super sweet, charismatic and patient, our waitress was absolutely the greatest, she took very well care of us throughout the busy tables, I honestly would have thought everything would feel so rushed but it wasn't. I'm very impressed! However, I must say it saddens me to see and witness the rudeness of some customers, I must disagree with a comment down below, that being I was sitting right next to this incident when occurred! No child was ever yelled at nor neglected or asked to leave at any moment; it is restaurant policy and I assure this is at any restaurant that it is policy that being i work in the business myself, that any type of food purchased outside the business is not permitted, so thus being said all that was being said was that it wouldn't be fair to allow them to consume sushi which is totally different from the food they serve! To be consumed within the restaurant, which is pretty accurate to any New York restaurant, shorten to say the least, people don't listen to these lies that people write because they simply are too stubborn and refuse to see things any other way but there's. That young lady did nothing but nicely advise them that the outside food was not allowed to be consumed in the dining room. Needless to say Cucina, thank you for such wonderful service! Will be back soon!",,,

54,Jason P.,"Forest Hills, NY",543,1119,3574,3.0,4/29/2008,"I've been working by Rockefeller Center for the past 2-3 years and frequently go down to the Rockefeller Plaza concourse to eat lunch. There was one place that always seemed to have a good crowd, but I usually walked by it because it looked expensive. Today, I decided to take a look and see what they had. There were various areas stationed to get different types of food (salad bar, entrees, soup, coffee, and an assortment of desserts ranging from cupcakes, brownies, and cookies).I decided to go to the entree stand which only required a 2-3 minute wait. This was mainly because the 2 guys behind the stand were quick, particularly because Rockefeller is such a high trafficked area and it gets very busy there for lunch. I decided to go for a half rotisserie chicken and 2 sides (mashed potatoes and teriyaki stir-fried vegetables), which was $8.75 + tax. The chicken was decently sized and the side proportions were very generous.When paying for my meal, I noticed they also had a Cucina & Co Gift Card, which you get a 25% bonus in value. So I bought a $20 gift card with a value of $25. A good deal I said to myself, taking note that the food looked very fresh and delish!And now to the review of the food: The chicken was very juicy on the leg/thigh, but the breast was a bit dry to my liking. The skin was crispy and mighty delicious. The mashed potatoes were nothing to rave about, your average buttery mashed potatoes. But the stir-fried vegetables were cooked just right (not too raw/crunchy nor overcooked/soft). I did find the veggies slightly oily but good nonetheless. In all, I will definitely go back to try out their other foods and am glad I got the Gift Card.",2,2,2
55,Margie C.,"Long Beach, NY",1,1,0,1.0,12/30/2014,"The fact that I work in a restaurant I usually give places a slack for everything because I know how things work and how it feels.. But I have to say this is by far the worst place to eat in knowing that it's in a tourist spot!! Hosts are terrible, gave us an attitude because we wanted to seat towards the inside since we have a kid with us and they immediately said no. Okay, I understand because servers go on a rotation so I let that pass, ignored the attitude.. Server came and greeted us got our order. Took 30 minutes for the food to come out, and another 10minutes for the kids food to come out. Which is too long because usually entrees comes out atleast within the 20minute ticket time! We weren't even half way done with our food and the server came and asked if we wanted dessert! Basically he's trying to hurry us up! Not to mention they don't have enough Parmesan cheese for the table!!!! My aunt wanted her food wrapped because she wasn't able to finish it, and of course the server threw out the food!!!! I just had it! I called the manager and complained about the whole entire dining experience. To put the icing on top Chris, who's the manager, DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!! It's a shame because the food isn't bad at all, it's the staff that makes the whole entire dining experience horrible and makes the guests not want to come back!!!

63,Jeanne J.,"New York, NY",1,8,0,1.0,1/1/2015,"NOTE: We went to the sit-down restaurant; not the take-out place.Why the one-star review? Because if I could give less, I would (but that is not an option on Yelp right now).Let me start by saying I live in New York and am aware how restaurants sometimes treat locals differently from tourists. On 12/30/14, my visiting relatives and I decided to have dinner at this place because: a) everywhere else was crowded; b) it was too cold to go out to another place; and c) the hostess said they could give us a table for 8 right away. I'll start here: the hostess had a huge attitude problem, looked me up and down as if figuring out if I was a tourist or a local, and said two things to me which automatically made me cringe:1) ""Table for eight? Are you all ordering entrees?"" (Umm, say what?)2) ""If you don't like this table, don't touch anything and I will see about setting up another table,"" when I asked for another table away from the entrance where it was terribly cold.When we finally sat down and ordered right away, it took a while for the for the food to arrive. OK, I understand this might be due to the fact that there were 8 of us - fine. But then I noticed that there were no forks on the table. What is a restaurant that cannot even properly set the table for its customers? We had to wait another 5 minutes for 8 forks to be delivered to our table.The entrees finally started arriving, after an eternity, and of course they brought my 3 year-old niece's food last: A very simple pasta dish with butter sauce! Does this really take forever to cook? And Cucina, take note: at other restaurants, they bring the kids' food first! Remember that!Within 2-3 bites of our entrees, the waiter came to our table NOT to ask how everything was, but, get this, to ask if we wanted to order dessert. I told him to come back after we were done with our main dishes. Was he freaking kidding me??The food was at best MEDIOCRE, and after eating less than half of my $24 pasta dish, I asked the waiter nicely to pack it for me. It never came back and after I asked him what happened to it, he said he didn't hear what I said so he threw it out. I asked for the manager and that guy (Chris) didn't even know what to do. The look on his face was just total confusion. I swear they were probably plotting to scrape the garbage in order to give me my leftovers back. In the end I didn't want it anymore. We could have skipped the tip, but my family members are way too decent and still gave them 20%, which they did not deserve AT ALL.I will make it my personal mission to let all my tourist (and local) friends know about the incompetence and unprofessionalism of this place to save them from being subjected to the awful treatment given to us.",,,

The waitress was very pleasant and especially with it being so busy, one could easily get overwhelmed, but she was courteous, patient and quick, considering we had a 2yo at the table! The service I'd give 4 stars but the food was average, thus the total 3. It's not something I'd go out of my way to go to again, but it's conveniently located down on the concourse level with a few other restaurants to pick from, so it's an option.

You can get a half of a small sized (think game hen) chicken rotisserie and a couple sides (I got roasted potatoes and wild rice with corn) for $9.If you hit the restaurant option, you may or may not get better food, but you'll pay even more for it.

Second time I actually got take out at the counter to take upstairs with a coworker. I had mac and cheese, and it was not so good. For a container of less-than-mediocre mac and cheese, $8 is a bit hefty, I think. But I should take into consideration the fact that I work in a building chock full of tourists.

The prices were kinda steep, even for NY. $10 for a bowl of soup and $4 for a single small cup of hot tea? Dinner entrees were also pretty limited. It was well past dinner hour and our dining area wasn't full but no one came to take our order until I waved someone down after a good while. Then they messed up the orders - my bf didn't get cheese fries like he asked and I ordered the shrimp scampi and got some bolognese pasta with chicken instead. I didn't complain because we were in a rush so we just ate it. I asked for two plates since we were sharing and no one ever brought them. The waiter was MIA after we ordered, never stopped by to refill drinks or anything. We ordered a single dessert and got it way after the family next to us, who had the same waiter, came in AFTER us and ordered multiple desserts. They also cleared our table and didn't bring a single utensil for the dessert and again our waiter was nowhere to be found. We asked for the check and I pointed out that he had charged me for the shrimp scampi but it wasn't what I received. It took him another 20 minutes to bring us the correct check, at which point we were late for our show and demanded to speak to the manager but she never came out. The hostess kept apologizing saying how busy it was but by that time the place was closed for serving and half empty.This was the worst dining experience and service i ever had.

87,Robyn F.,"San Francisco, CA",62,461,1,3.0,4/18/2007,"This lunch destination isn't bad for midtown.  Some of the food is overpriced, but there are some good deals here. -Recommended: Half-chicken is only $6.75!  For an extra $2, you can get 2 sides.  Usually enough for 2 meals.  This is half-price after 4pm. -Not recommended: Lasagna is too salty.  Other entrees are a bit pricey at $7.50.  Combined with sides, price is over $10. -Tip: Get the Cucina card!  You get $25 on the meal card, and you only have to get $20.  Definitely an arbitrage opportunity here. ;)",5,1,1
88,Esther E.,"Flushing, NY",401,248,138,1.0,12/12/2010,"HOLY BALLS. We stopped by this place for a quick coffee and dessert and the waitress rudely told us that we can't do that. More exactly, she said ""You guys can't just sit here and have tea and dessert"" and she said it with a 'tude. Dude, okay we can't do that but do you need to be such a grinch. This place was getting packed due to the location (tourist trap) and it took like a good 15 minutes until our rude waitress came around. UGH. The menu was limited but the prices were decent for the area. Too bad I didn't get to try anything or enjoy the loud ambiance more.",3,1,

Updated review","I got lunch here today with a couple of coworkers.  I had the chicken and rice teriyaki bowl with no vegetables, a chocolate chip cookie and a 'Citrus Energy Green Tea' Honest Tea (no quote on the inside).  The cookie was really stale, but I ate it anyways.  $12.35.Photo - static.px.yelp.com/photo…",1,1,1

91,Lorelai L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,8,1,3.0,9/25/2011,"I come here whenever I want some simple, no fuss, and quick food.  I have never dined here.  I prefer to grab the food and sit around Rockefeller Center.  I haven't really tried many things here, but it is my go-to place for chicken tenders.  They are moist and actually tender while crispy on the outside.  I know it seems redundant to say that chicken tenders are tender, but believe me, some places can really mess up such a simple dish!  I do like that they have fesh squeezed orange juice here.  I love my OJ in the mornings.The other thing that I have had here is their ham and cheese roll.  I like to have them heat it up on their panini press.  The cheese melts and the roll is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It is so simple, but so satisfying.They do have big parties here often on the weekends, but I don't usually dine in so it doesn't bother me much.",,,
92,P. P.,"Montclair, NJ",0,48,7,1.0,12/29/2013,"HORRIBLE! Bad service, filthy dining room, HIGH prices - lousy food! Our server was friendly - and I could see her standing around a lot chatting with other staff - but them she'd be so busy we wouldnt see her for a while - she never asked if the food (that someone else brought out) was correct (it wasnt) or if we wanted another drink (we would have) - buy the time she got back around to us - we needed a check - and that took a while too - so we never got to give them a chance to correct their mistakes- but the food we did have here was TERRIBLE.

95,Paul U.,"Brownwood, TX",0,9,4,1.0,12/19/2010,"Took my family there tonight at around 7pm. First off the hostess outside insults us by saying ""just so you know, it's $15 per person minimum"". WHAT?  Did we look like we couldn't afford such fancy high ffalootin' vittles?  Well, we still went in because we were hungry. She sits the 4 of us at a table meant for 2. Plenty of larger tables available. Daughters get upset when Dad makes a scene, so I let that go too and we sat knee to knee. My pasta dish was OK, barely warm. Wifes was hot. Daughter ordered the $9 soup of the day. A very shallow bowl of corn chowder with nothing else. All in all , rude poor service and overpriced food. Worst meal of our trip.",,,
96,Lois W.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",16,34,1,4.0,4/27/2007,"Ok so it's really a 3 star restaurant if compared to all restaurants everywhere, however the concourse at Rockefeller Plaza is sometimes my whole universe (when it's raining, for example, at lunchtime and I am forced to choose from food available via the underground labyrinths).  Therefore I am rating Cucina in comparison to the other restaurants in the concourse -- pret a manger, hale n hearty, yummy sushi, mendy's deli, tossed, a pizza place, etc.  Given those choices, Cucina is a very nice option, as it has a salad bar which is decent, hot entrees, sandwiches, soups, and lots of yummy pastries to choose from.  A note on the desserts:  the chocolate creme cupcake (the one with a dollop of white frosting on top) is a sugar-junkie's crack cocaine.  And truly the scones are the best in the concourse.  For breakfast, you can get bagels, oatmeal, all kinds of eggish wraps, etc.   There are some kind of sausage patties floating in water that people seem to order quite a bit.  Now, the french toast I have an issue with.  It's unlike any french toast I've had before, but not in a good or very bad way, just not what you expect when you think of french toast.  It's kind of overly moist and has raisins in it... i'm still on the fence about it. In regards to entrees -- I had the tilapia francaise the other day for lunch and it was quite good -- flaky, tasty, slightly crispy.  Oh - - i had the catfish once and did not like it.  Not sure why.  Just a personal dislike maybe.  They always have a macaroni and cheese casserole but i have never gotten it.   It looks nice though.Overall Cucina is a necessity for the rock concourse.  I can't explain it ,but it adds a sense of civility to the place -- it's a nice middle ground between the fancy seafood grille and  the faster food places.  And, I can avoid the rain, sleet, snow, heat and cars!   Yay for the good ol' indoors!!!!",4,,

98,Perisa H.,"Addisleigh Park, NY",5,11,33,3.0,12/7/2011,"Myself and my son went here because we were going to see the Radio City Show and we wanted to relax and be close by.  We received our bread - freezing cold.  My son order an Hamburger -he asked for bacon (the waiter wasn't sure if they had bacon (they did) what restaurant doesn't have bacon) anyway I order a Turkey Salad  ( I asked for red onions on the side) They didn't have any - WOW - nor did they have BBQ sauce.  I was shocked how an establishment couldn't not have the ""little things""   Burger and Salad were both $17.00 and surprise to see how tasty it was.  We then order a Brownie Sundae - Why did I feel they were back there baking it from stratch.  Overall the food was good but I wasn't too impressed with the service.  The waiter seen that my son spilled some Ketchup on the table and I had to ask for a napkin like 20 minutes later so I COULD clean it up.  This place is okay if you are dining with someone and you both are able to split the bill because my was a whooping $58.00.",,,
99,Denise S.,"Tampa, FL",217,156,49,3.0,1/29/2009,Cucina is good although a bit pricey...but then again what isn't and it's also Rockefeller Center. One thing I do think is a great deal is the half chicken with two sides...also I've been told that after 3pm they sometimes have a cheaper price (for chicken anyway) since they prepare to close for the day.,,,

102,B K.,"New York, NY",1,11,0,3.0,1/24/2009,"Cucina has a largish selection for different lunch food. There's the pasta section, the salad bar, the entree section plus all the pastries and coffee and such. It's a bit expensive. But if you get the Cucina card, you get $25 bucks for every $20 you spend. I think you can put on any amount, so really there's no reason not to get it.The best thing about Cucina though is the daily ""Chef's Table"" special which is offered from 11:30 to about noon. My personal favorite is the lobster quesadilla which, sadly, seems to have dropped out of steady rotation. Judging by the lines though, the most popular is the sliders which are served every Friday.",,,
103,Tatiana V.,"Bronx, NY",66,36,0,4.0,7/4/2012,"I came here five years ago when my uncle, his wife, her son, and my cousin while they were on visit during the holidays. I'm currently writing a review now because I never knew the name of the place and I happen to be at Rockefeller Center yesterday and passed by it. My cousin and uncle's wife's son  wanted to go ice skating, but after seeing the one hour wait, they decided to go join my uncle and his wife to this place since they were already there. My cousin wanted what her stepmother had, which was the most gigantic bowl I've ever seen that was filled with oiled spaghetti and shrimp. She was appalled by the amount of food and said that her and I could share because she wasn't going to eat all of it. She was born and raised in France and when she saw me the first time, she told me that she was surprised that I'm American and I am not fat... We shared the bowl and after completing it, we were both literally stuffed. No one can really eat that much pasta. The pasta itself was really good and had a nice strong garlic flavor. The shrimp was really plump and juicy. You have to like garlic in order to like this dish, if they still have it because again, it was five years ago. We did enjoy our food as it had a lot of flavor. The portion sizes threw us off. As an American, I couldn't eat that much pasta. I would recommend this place if you are very hungry and want quality eating.",,,
