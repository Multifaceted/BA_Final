1,David A.,"Manhattan, NY",121,6,4,2.0,11/4/2018,"What a dreadful, depressing turkey burger. Embarrassing! i'll let this image speak for itself.",1,,
2,Paige H.,"New York, NY",14,183,17,5.0,9/30/2018,"Second time here and it did not disappoint, again! Both times the friend I was with and I got a breakfast of sorts and noted how yummy, fresh, and perfect the meal was. The space is great, especially if you can get an outdoor table on the street, not avenue, side. It's a neighborhood to-go!",,,
3,Paul G.,"New York, NY",196,137,0,2.0,11/12/2018,"I like the room. The tables are well-spaced. The servers really try. But the food just isn't very good. My omelette was merely an egg or two cooked until hard, but was not an omelette. The grilled cheese sandwich didn't have much cheese. My granddaughter ordered hot chocolate and it was made with water rather than milk. Just a block away is Green Kitchen which is a far better diner.",,,
4,Shirin P.,"Houston, TX",14,432,45,4.0,8/29/2018,Decent diner food! Friendly staff. It helps that it's only 3 blocks from our apartment. Corn beef hash was really good! I should go back after a night of drinking to see how I like the food!,,,
5,Jaimee A.,"Manhattan, NY",2265,1601,649,2.0,4/7/2018,"We gave this diner a few shots and I have to say, it is very hit or miss. The first time we went, the food was so so. We had brunch and it was nothing that great. Very basic, not as good as the Green Kitchen.The second time we went, we had breakfast which was definitely better, except the person at the next table found a hair in their food. Enough said.P.S. The staff is...bizarre. I arrived before my husband and the set the table for just me. I told server that my husband was coming and she smirked and said, right. I ordered for my husband and myself (so the food would be there when he arrived). I got another smirk from the waitress. When my husband arrived and she seemed shocked. For the record, I am a very typical looking UES woman. I don't look crazy and don't talk to trees or myself. The serving staff needs to get over themselves.....",9,6,3
6,Kim B.,"New York, NY",339,747,140,5.0,4/4/2018,"Wow, what an upgrade is all I have to say. This is 10x better than the Barking Dog, its near impossible to think that it's in the same venue because it couldn't be more different. That's in every way possible.On a Saturday at prime time, we didn't need a reservation. You can just walk right in. Imagine that! As a negative, there were lots of kids that were rowdy and loud, not so good for our heads. It has a clean, fresh, light vibe. Lots of white and black, simple but still feels classy, although still feels like a diner. The menu is expansive, and I definitely want to try other meals here besides breakfast. I am giving this 5 stars based on me having the best omelette of my life. Now, they may have caught me on a good day, but something about the omlette just hit all the right spots and was so tasty and delicious. I got the 'diet' omelette, and probably will never live that down, but is was full of yummy veggies, egg whites, and I added cheese. The bacon was crisp, thick, and flavorful. It was a total win and I am so excited to try more meals here.",6,1,3

Updated review","I think the food is delicious, I am a person who loves gourmet variety so every time I go I dedicate myself to order something different in addition to this is physical space as such is very nice and clean. a tip do not stop proving the paid apple with the vanilla gelatto is a delight",,,
8,Andrew S.,"Manhattan, NY",6,59,0,1.0,5/19/2018,"Sadly, this is a downgrade from the days of the Barking Dog.Wait staff was nice and helpful, but the food was terrible.  We ordered a well-done burger and it came pink inside.  The waiter replaced it, and the replacement was also undercooked!  My panini was supposed to come with jalapenos, but came with regular green peppers.  Completely bland!  Go to Green Kitchen or Gracie Mews Diner instead.",2,1,
9,J. H.,"The Strip, Las Vegas, NV",0,23,0,4.0,8/25/2018,"We went there on our first morning back in America. We had pancakes, French toast and the ham and eggs. So good!!! The service was great and we were very happy. I read the other reviews and I think York Avenue Kitchen is great.  We walked by around dinner/lunch and we want to go back again.",1,,
10,Allison A.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,2.0,4/14/2018,Dashed hopesOur family had high hopes for this restaurant because we liked Barking Dog but we were disappointed when we tried it. The restaurant staff are very friendly but the food is just subpar. Our kids' pasta was clearly re-heated and my eggs benedict was nothing special. The most basic of elements were there but the dish just didn't come together in an appetizing way. We hope they can turn it around!,1,,
11,Linan C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,95,69,3.0,4/3/2018,"Cute spot with mediocre food. This newly opened, spacious cafe/diner is the perfect spot to shield yourself from the rain or to just spend a few quiet hours. That said, food here is nothing to rave about: the eggs Florentine came with poached eggs that are almost hard-boiled, along with a tiny bit of Hollandaise. The French toast tastes more eggy and sweet. Together, the two dishes left me with a weird salty/dry taste in my mouth.",1,,
12,Ferdinand C.,"Bronx, NY",46,243,11,3.0,3/17/2018,"Just your average diner. But service was friendly. My husband and I stopped by for an early dinner on Friday. We were the only customers but our food took a little while to come out. We ordered the Rutherford burger and Greek burger. The Rutherford burger was fine. Just your simple good tasting burger. The onion rings and fries we got on the side were good, maybe the best part of the meal. The Greek burger is what disappointed. Since it's a Greek burger, I failed to realize, or the menu failed to point out that it does not come on a bun but rather between pita breads. Picture a fat ROUND piece of burger patty with all the toppings sandwiched between two pieces of SEMICIRCULAR and flimsy pita bread slices that's a bit larger than a burger patty. Basically the pita bread next to the patty soaked up all the grease and just fell apart. Also you have to eat the sides of the pita bread first if you want to make it to your burger since pita bread is not the same shape as a burger. If I had know it came with pita bread and not a bun I would've ordered a gyro or just not the Greek burger itself.",1,,
13,Jessica F.,"Greenwich Village, Manhattan, NY",109,4,0,1.0,3/25/2018,"While Barking Dog may have gotten a facelift, the new York Avenue Kitchen will never compare.  The food is average at best when it actually comes out right.  My mother and I came here for the first time for breakfast to try it out, and I can say I will probably never be back again.  We entered and the employee at front refused to help us or a group in front of us but said someone else would be with us.  I realized she meant the older gentleman who was the only employee busting his ass, clearing and resetting tables.  We then sat down and while the waiter was very nice I soon realized that despite the nice new bright decor that was where York Avenue Kitchen drew the line.  I had to get up to ask for water twice, the couple to the left of us had gotten an undone waffle that the kitchen and staff let get served, they brought my mother white toast instead of rye and then he tried to tell me it was rye, my eggs were not over easy, and the pregnant woman to the right of us waited 15 minutes for the wrong omelette.  A side of sauce for $5 brought 2 links, and the $2.50/each sausages were half the size of Barking Dog and over done.  The sausage and my over easy eggs seemed like the only items that were over done.While there were tons of employees working, no one except the older gentleman seemed to care and everyone else just accepted lackluster service and food.Bring back Barking Dog!!!!",1,,
14,Christine M.,"New York, NY",5,15,14,4.0,4/29/2018,"York Ave Kitchen was on point today. Barking dog was my old go to diner so it's great to have a solid replacement. I usually go for the basics, two eggs over easy, however I decided today to try the banana and walnut pancakes and I was not disappointed! Will definitely be returning here again!",,,
15,Paul C.,"New York, NY",0,11,3,5.0,4/8/2018,Warm and welcoming staff. Delicious burgers and lamb gyro platter. Helpful and accommodating with kids. Bright and fresh atmosphere. Reasonable prices. No complaints.,,,
16,Ruben Y.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",265,20,76,5.0,3/14/2018,The best place ever for breakfast brand new in the neighborhood come and enjoy you never gonna be disappointed ..,,,
17,Francisco A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",63,2,0,5.0,3/25/2018,"The location just opened about a week ago and Ive already been to it 3 times. The menu is typical diner food with a lot of options,Great taste too. The prices are very comfortable for an upper east side location and the people are very friendly. It's been very busy, being a new location, so the wait times for food and such may be a bit long,specially on weekends but the food is worth the wait. I've had the Texas burger, the Steak Panini and for breakfast the waffles. Loved all of them. Also I recommend getting the Onion Rings, best ones I've had in a while.Will definitely be going there often.",,,
18,Tein G.,"New York, NY",148,4,0,1.0,4/17/2018,"Let's start with the good - the interior is cute(ish), clean and modern. Now on to the bad + ugly: we came here on a Saturday around 2pm to try out the new place. Right off the bat, the waiters were standing around not being attentive to any new customers walking in. We finally get seated after what I feel to be an awkward 5 minute interaction with the host. I ordered a bowl with potatoes, ham, bacon, and eggs and my girlfriend ordered scrambles eggs and 4 pieces of bacon. I have never been more aesthetically disgusted with food in my life. My bowl came in a soup bowl (which ok, that may just be me, but I was expecting an actual BOWL). Not enough egg, not enough ham or bacon, and a whole lot of potatoes - which I didn't end up finishing because they were bland. But here's where the kicker is - on my girlfriend's plate - was what resembled eggs and 4 sad, lonely, and miserable pieces of bacon, no potatoes (even though the menu had stated COMES WITH). She proceeds to eat them, because what is a girl to do and compliments my cooking (which if you knew my cooking repertoire it doesn't extend far from steak, chicken, and eggs). After finishing our miserable food, we wait for what feels like another 15 awkward minutes of check torture. My advice - save your appetite and go to Gracie Mew's where the food is amazing, they treat you life family, and never, EVER forget the potatoes.",3,4,
19,Peter W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,9/15/2018,"We came here because we live arid the corner and didn't want to walk the extra block to Green Kitchen. Service was SLOW and food was fair at best, everything lacked flavor. Then when it came time to get the check our waitress was no where to be found and had ask 3 times to other waitress before getting the check. Needless to say won't be coming back.",,,
20,Anthony O.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",262,98,84,3.0,5/24/2018,It's fine. I went once and the staff was very friendly and the ambiance was ok. It seems like they're making an honest effort but the results were an average diner deli experience.,,,
21,Philip K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,5/31/2018,After experimenting a very rude hostess we had to leave after waiting for our order for 25 mins longer than it should have taken. The waiter didn't even bother to appease us. Very bad service,,,
22,Ashley E.,"Southeast Portland, Portland, OR",0,2,0,1.0,7/29/2018,"The service staff was nice but the restaurant was understaffed therefore causing the food, diner style breakfast, to take over 30 mins to make. We sat over 15 mins before even getting water or coffee. Then our other drinks were forgotten. It seemed like the wait staff was helping the kitchen cook the food. Additionally, the food was terrible. I've never had a simple diner breakfast taste so bland.",,1,
23,Gilbert W.,"Brooklyn, NY",356,26,4,1.0,7/10/2018,"Stumbled in late afternoon thinking it looked clean (and they had an A rating in their window); but should've stumbled out immediately after seeing they didn't really have many customers. Sadly, I found out why. Ordered Spaghetti with Meatballs bcoz that's pretty much a staple of a good diner, so how badly could they mess that up right!? Well, the tip was when the waitress asked if I wanted to add shrimp/chicken to the order for $9/$5 more. Being confused as this is not a common choice to make in other diners, I declined. Well it turned out I shouldn't have ordered that dish at all. The spaghetti itself was so bland; if it was from a can, it probably would've tasted better. The sauce was also bland. The 2 hard meatballs that came with the dish tasted worse; like they were made last December (it's July), and kept frozen ever since. I'm very sorry to say I won't be going back. The waitress was very nice though.",,1,
24,Brandy S.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,2,5.0,4/14/2018,Wonderful food and they deliver!  The patty melt was awesome.,,,
25,Lisa M.,"New York, NY",65,2,0,5.0,4/14/2018,"Amazing new diner, recently opened! Decor is really nice, clean and bright. Food amazing, we got the Eggs Benedict and Hash and Eggs both perfect! Great portion and cooked to perfection. Coffee really nice and staff very attentive! Looking forward to making this our new local for breakfast. We'll be back. Thanks!",,,
26,Josh S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,3.0,3/17/2018,"Average at best- service was a little slow and awkward, and food took very long to come out.  They're very new, so it was understood that there are a few kinks to work out.The ""messy burger"" was ok- they forgot the bacon (as listed on the menu), and it tasted more like a frozen burger patty than a solid diner burger.  Fries were also very obviously frozen before being cooked.My girlfriend got a waffle, two eggs and bacon- the waffle didn't taste fresh, and the eggs were inconsistently cooked.  She asked for over medium- one was over hard, and one was over easy.Overall, it's a nice looking new restaurant and the staff was friendly, but they have a long way to go before becoming a neighborhood staple.  Wish that it lived up to the standard of its predecessor.",,,
27,B M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,3,0,5.0,7/16/2018,"This place is simply wonderful. Great neighborhood spot, and the staff is always so attentive and wonderful! Always love going in and chatting with the two servers, Sam and Leigh. They are simply delightful and always help me find items that I will enjoy! They just started doing takeout and delivery too, which is affordable and tasty. Keep up the great work @YorkAvenueKitchen!",,,
28,Leigh J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",193,1,0,5.0,7/15/2018,"Great food, great staff!  I personally love the egg white wraps, but they offer everything under the sun!",,,
29,Jennifer G.,"New York, NY",22,18,5,1.0,4/4/2018,"What a major disappointment. Tried carry out this evening with high hopes of having a new go-to in the neighborhood. Ordered a simple patty melt and got an overcooked hamburger patty on a slice bread- nothing even closely resembling a patty melt, or a burger for that matter. Fries were mediocre at best. Overall, this was bad enough that I'll be going to bed without dinner tonight. Too bad.",,,
30,S Z.,"Locust Valley, NY",0,9,0,5.0,3/17/2018,"This place exceeds the meaning of your local diner. The service was amazing! The staff was extremely friendly and the food was fantastic & made to perfection. The owner, Andrew was so welcoming and so informative when it came to recommending items on the menu. Will certainly be back !! Overall from the food, decor, service & staff, this place over-exceeded my expectations!",1,,1
31,E P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,4/22/2018,Nice salmon benedict; friendly conscientious service; good lighting in the window seats.,,,
32,Wei H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",23,3,0,4.0,4/1/2018,"Came with my husband on Easter morning for a brunch. I had the monte Cristo and my husband had the waffle with bacon, ham and sausage. Both were very tasty, not greasy at all. The staff were super friendly. As mentioned in the other reviews, the service crew could use some more streamlining. They seemed lost as to who was in charge of what, and the food took a long time to come out. Will come back for weekend brunches but probably not on weekdays when we don't have a lot of time sitting there waiting.",,,
33,Sarah S.,"New York, NY",0,21,9,2.0,4/10/2018,"Another review said 'hit or miss""-  I would rate this ""miss"", encased in plastic.  The space has been redone, clean lines, but virtually all the view to the windows from the center is GONE.  The waitresses were sweet, but fairly clueless:  how many times do you have to tell them you are okay with your coffee?  Then another one lifts the cup, to refill what you didn't want refilled.  And the mild was brought in those little plastic mini-cups:  it takes 4 of them to make my mug suitably milky.  The butter, jam, and milk are all plasticized: and my salad might have well as been.  No taste in the Cobb salad: pink cherry tomatoes (I thought one half would bounce, so stiff)- rubbery avocado.  The red onion was cut in thick chunks, not thin slivers, so it was overwhelming.  The bacon bits were good, but sparse.  And at $14, there was no chicken- that would have been $5 extra-  chicken, for a salad, for five dollars....!!!  I won't be doing this again-  I will go down two more blocks on York, to a real bistro.  Don't waste your time here....",,,
34,Meyer E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,3/25/2018,Great food Service is fast Great hamburger Great salad dessert is wonderful this is why am leaving five Stars great experience,,,
