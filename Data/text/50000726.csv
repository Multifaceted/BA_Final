0,Manna C.,"New York, NY",300,130,421,4.0,9/6/2018,"Finally made up my mind about this place. It took a while considering I'm here often enough for happy hour. Super solid happy hour that lasts until 7PM, especially in FiDi, where most happy hours end at 6pm. Half off draft beers and half off apps - I'd consider that a steal. Don't expect a huge selection of draft beers. It's not that kind of bar. My go to is the cold ass beer, which is more on the lighter tasting side. I always get the $5 mini b's (three sliders) and I'm usually set. Not a big fan of the junk fries and I've tried them multiple times - large portion but fries were quite cold and soggy. Nachos were ok. The spinach artichoke dip was good to me. I've been here numerous times and I'll probably come back again for happy hour drinks and those mini b's.",1,,2
1,Ryan S.,"Peachtree City, GA",0,49,206,2.0,11/4/2018,"Food: 4/10Service: 3/10Atmosphere: 5/10I've never really had a great service experience here, often skipped over in line if I'm by myself and pretty frequently ending up in server limbo for whatever reason.  Bill's is awfully expensive for being standard burgers and bar food, and the quality of the food itself just doesn't live up to the lofty expectations that the prices suggest.  For the money, I'd say go to satisfy your curiosity about an ""Impossible Burger"" and then move along.",,,
2,Alexander C.,"Brooklyn, NY",266,46,4,3.0,8/13/2018,"Bill's Bar & Burger wasn't too bad and the interior was like any other spots bar. they had multiple televisions for different spots and separate games. Bill's also has a decent beer selection where you will not be bored and can try multiple types if you want. I'm giving this spot 3 stars because the staff took a while to get our drink orders. The table knew what we wanted to get and our heads were up trying to get our waitress attention. But she ended up tending another table or just walking around and ignoring us for a bit. The place didn't look packed, so we were expecting better customer service. The food was decent, I ordered the fat cat burger. It wasn't bad with a English muffin as a bun, bu their sweet potato waffle fries was really good. I ended up finishing my fries before my burger. I would probably go back for happy hour, but not sure about sitting in for food.",,,

4,Louis N.,"New York, NY",369,216,447,3.0,7/5/2018,"Gets packed with a lot of tourists, which makes sense as it's located in a touristy location and connected to a hotel. Good vide, family friendly and lots of sports on screens. Burgers were good, no sides came with them though. Usually you would expect fries to go along a burger, but you have to order them separately from the burger.  Not the biggest burger I've had but it didn't leave me hungry. Good service but the seats are oddly spaced in the booths because the seat sticks out too much in the front and it's uncomfortable when you lean back.",3,2,2
5,Catherine T.,"New York, NY",1391,204,624,5.0,8/28/2018,"I've been here a few times for lunch and it never disappoints. The wings and their artichoke dip is my go-to. Food is always great, service is always fast. I was here a few weeks ago and was attended by Havolin who was behind the bar. She made me her own craft cocktail, the pink flamingo which was tasty and fresh perfect for this summer heat. She was great, very attentive. I also had the toronja sour which was actually perfect for me since I'm a big grapefruit lover. This place also has live music in the evening. Spacious, and trendy. Will always come back if I'm ever around the area.",21,11,16

Updated review","Even after all the hoopla, I went back and had yet another bad example of service. I noticed the manager there, but didn't want to call out that we had spoken previously and that they sent me a gift card because I honestly wanted to see if the service was just...better. It wasn't. It started off rocky. It was fairly empty and we went up to the hostess asking for a table for two, she began to sit us and I asked if we oculd sit in a booth. Instead of saying sure, she walked over to one, took away two menus and walked away. I guess that was her way of saying, sure. Our server was attentive. Then he disappeared for a long period of time. I asked to change my bun, then later found out it was an up charge for it. I was fine with paying it, but that's something I feel he should have shared. Then, I planned on using the gift card they gave me and paying an other charges. I give him the gift card and when he comes back, he came back and replied, ""You can't use a gift card more than once."" I promptly replied, I had been sent the gift card and literally just pulled it out of the envelope. That's when I asked if the manager who originally gave me the card was there and he told me, ""he had just left."" Imagine my surprise when I saw him walking around 10 min later. After waiting 19 minutes, he returned with the check, minus the gift card amount.I tired. twice. But the quality of food and the service is not align with the price. I won't be back. It seems like everyone here hates working here. It's almost sad.",1,,

12,Beril E.,"New York, NY",155,99,457,4.0,2/8/2018,"I have been working in this area for 5 years and can't believe I learned about this place only recently! They have amazing Happy hour specials on weekdays between 4-7pm for those who work around the area.All appetizers are half price during happy hour! I'd certainly recommend the Junk fries. It is the largest appetizer I've ever had; it could easily fill up 3 stomachs. Nachos were okay too but the ingredients were more sparsely spaced than in he junk fries. The spinach dip was just okay. Special mention goes to their sliders (mini B's), which are as juicy as their burgers if not more. Mini B's are $5 during happy hour as well and come as 3 sliders (a total steal). We came as a large group and kept ordering more and more sliders since nobody was getting sick of them. During happy hour, draft beers are also half off and house wines are $5. It is hard to get craft beers at a place like this and do not expect some mind-blowing wine. But they get the job done when you just want a couple of drinks after a long day of work. The bar is spacious with lots of table seating. They accommodate large parties better than other bars do (they connected two tables to accommodate our large party when we were there). The servers were attentive and kind to remind us when happy hour was about to be over. We made complete use of that knowledge. By 7pm, we were buzzed and stuffed. We felt that Bill's bar and burgers did its job right.",,,
13,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,3.0,9/7/2018,"Decent burger, excellent shakes. Very convenient for late night cravings in the financial district. We were staying at the W hotel nearby for a staycation and we were glad to find this place open after a late night out.",,,

17,Simon K.,"Calgary, Canada",5,161,221,2.0,10/19/2018,"This restaurant was on the ground floor of the Marriott hotel we stayed at so we ordered takeout from them after a long day in Manhattan.  The food was okay, not great, but okay.  The low 2-star rating was primarily for the staff service received.  Frankly, the staff that took my order and eventually gave me my food seemed like she hated her job.  Before I left I asked her for some forks and knives. She said yes but I later found out that she only gave us one set of fork and knife with our order.  One would expect that the service would be better for a restaurant in a Marriott.",,,
18,Lisa C.,"Manhattan, NY",153,4,21,3.0,8/3/2018,"Food: 3/5 Service (in the restaurant): 4/5Takeout service: 2/5 (I'm being generous)Overall:I've been here a bunch of times both for the bar and the restaurant. Great happy hour from 4-7pm which is accessible at the bar or at a table. Includes a bunch of half price apps (e.g. wings, spinach dip, queso, etc) and some draft beer specials. There isn't really a ""scene"" here and it's by no means a destination bar. Somewhere to pass through while in town on business or for locals on their way out for the night. The only time you see a lot of locals is during weekday lunch as groups of coworkers tend to frequent the spot.Bar: - The Patrons: I'm chatty with other patrons, and in my experience the evening bar crew is just a lot of out-of-towners staying at the Marriott on business (which Bill's is located in) mixed with a few locals who are largely waiting for takeout orders. This isn't what I would call the ""local hangout"" by any stretch of the imagination. - Drink Selections: As far as drinks go, I've never been overwhelmed by the draft beer selection or the cocktails. But the bottled beer selection is on point .  That said, this isn't the kind of place you come to enjoy a nice craft brew with buddies - it's a hotel-based sports bar. It's a nice spot and I have no qualms with it. Just don't come here expecting a special ambiance or great cocktails or anything like that. Restaurant:No real complaints here. The staff have always been really nice and fun. Today I went to lunch with my family and we had a blast with our waiter Jamaal. You can tell the people who work here actually eat and enjoy the food, which makes their recommendations very genuine.Food:Overall: They are known for their burgers (its in their name after all) but I'm not calling this the best burger in NYC. They offer a huge selection of creative burgers and sandwiches, all of which can be customized with add-ons. So if trying new creations is your thing, you'll likely enjoy this place! Aside from that, a few notes on what I've tried so far:- Burgers: Overall they are fine. I wish they offered different types of buns, as that's the only thing you don't get the option to customize! My favorite is the ""Ultimate Cheeseburger"" which is a triple-decker burger and each layer is a different type of cheese. PRO-TIP: get the special sauce on the side or else your bun will turn to mush and make it impossible to hold. - Milkshakes: these are the best value on the menu. They are delicious, inventive, and very pleasing when served. I'm obsessed with the Campfire shake which is vanilla with toasted marshmallow. Their plain chocolate is great too (black & white style). Regardless of your selection, you won't be disappointed. - Chicken Wings: I am originally from Buffalo so I'm going to abstain from voting. They don't live up IMO. They only come in Buffalo (no variations in spice level), BBQ, and Plain. The wings are breaded which I'm categorically opposed to and the ""buffalo"" sauce is really peppery. I've tried them twice now to give it the benefit of the doubt.....but never again. - Spinach Dip: Nice as a share plate on the table but nothing special. You can skip it and get the frozen TGIFridays version and call it a day.- Classic Fries: pretty good but more often then not come out warm (not hot). PRO TIP: the fries cost extra and don't come with the burgers. I will often tell my waiter to bring out the fries as soon as they are ready instead of waiting for the burgers to finish.",1,,

22,Emily M.,"Midlothian, VA",21,117,451,4.0,9/10/2017,"I went to Bill's Westside Bar in the Marriott. It has a swanky lounge feel to it. I was very impressed with their happy hour drink offerings. The bartenders are very nice, and make an excellent drink. We had the Copper Martini which was served in a really cool copper martini glass! They have a small selection of bottled beers and no taps. So if you want some draft beer you can't get it there. You can always walk around the corner to the restaurant bar for that.We didn't have the food, but the menu looked very good and we'd planned to come back should we have time for a happy hour. It's worth a cocktail none the less!",1,,

They make pretty much every drink you can imagine and the happy hour is the best in the area, strong and cheap! They make good burgers and wings, although the sliders could be bigger, they are like White Castle burgers. Make sure to get a feel for the lounge area across the hotel and the regular restaurant area, they are both two completely different environments but carry the same name. The lounge is perfect for a classy date, featuring live music but they have the same cheap drinks and great food. The bar/restaurant is great for hanging out with friends and watching sports games!",,,

Surprisingly around the area there's not too many places to eat. We passed bills bar & burger about two times because I was set on getting italian but couldn't find any place so we went inside to Bills and were greated by the friendly hostess! It wasnt too packed at lunch time on a weekday. I ordered the wings which were some of the best wings I've had before actually and my brother got a burger which he said was really juicy and delicious. If I was ever in the area again I would definitely stop by!,,,
29,David S.,"Tampa, FL",44,31,7,2.0,10/4/2018,Food was barely edible. Clam chowder was Campbell's fresh from the can. Queso was velvetta  and the sweet potato fries were clearly from a bag and cold. Kids chicken fingers looked like gnarly over cooked road kill. And tasted about the same. Everything was just bad. I'd never come here again and I have to use $15 a Day because the Mariott charges me for it regardless. At least the beer is good.,,,

We had a few drinks and some appetizers. I had some scotch while my friends had some milkshakes. They really enjoyed their milkshakes. They had a cookies and cream shake and the peanut butter monster shake. We also had some Mac n cheese as well as some fries.The service was attentive, friendly, and quick.

36,Arjun S.,"Hasbrouck Heights, NJ",144,67,121,4.0,1/12/2018,A solid burger place in the basement of a hotel downtown.  The place offers a a lot of local beers as well but the burgers steal the show. The service is excellent as well.  We went for the onion rings since we were told they are really good and they are. Light crust on them makes it perfect.  We went for these fries that had everything on them can't remember the name you can see it in the picture.  It was really good enough to share with a bunch of people. I did the spicy burger and I  came out just right.  If you are looking for a place to have a quick lunch with a group or even a happy hour this is a good place to try out.  It has two enterance and more than enough seats for everyone.  The drinks are awesome and reasonably priced.  For a downtown location it's pretty easy on the wallet as well.  Also most of the sides are shareable so order away.,,,

Not one of the top burgers I've had but a very good one. The patty was of the fresh handmade variety, a decent size and was moist and juicy. Nice crispy french fries too.However, I am deducting one star for the lazy service here. This place is not that big and is mainly a bar with several tables. As soon as we walked in, we looked around and stood near the entrance for quite a while. We were never greeted by the waitress (who saw us by the way), we sat ourselves down, and then we had to wave at them to bring us a menu.

38,Shelagh J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,2,0,1.0,11/10/2018,"I was waiting for my hotel room and decided to get a drink at the bar. I have never seen a manager with less desire to help his team out.  There was only 1 bartender and she was drowning in service tickets and had a full bar to serve. She asked several time for the Manager, Will, to help her and he didn't! One time he came behind the bar but didn't help, all he did was pace back and forth and looked at the service tickets. He tried to make small talk with me about the Red Sox, and I had to actually say to him that I think he needed to help his bartender. He left soon after and went to the kitchen while he was in the middle of pouring a drink! The other servers came behind the bar and helped the bartender out, it was that bad. She had to ask so many times for Will help her and he started arguing with her that he had called someone in. He didn't need to call anyone in, he needed to help her! It was the poorest service I had ever seen by a manger. I asked one of the servers what kind of manager Will was because he clearly was a FOH manager, and the server said ""he's a fucking shitty manager"". How can the employees respect you if you're not willing to help them? Isn't it the manager's job to help them? It's clear that this manager needs to find a new profession or a slower paced restaurant. It's no surprise none of his staff respect him.",1,,

48,Justin C.,"New Brunswick, NJ",34,1,0,1.0,7/15/2018,"I ordered takeout. Not only did I have to wait 30 minutes for just a burger and fries (because most of the employees were watching the World Cup instead of actually doing their job), when it did come out, it was all soggy. Also, part of my order was a Big Cat, and it was missing some of the advertised ingredients such pulled pork, the bacon, and the egg. Would definitely recommend avoiding this place.",1,,
49,Stuart K.,"Key Biscayne, FL",39,7,1,1.0,5/28/2018,"Bills burgers used to have a location in the meat market. It was a small funky burger joint with good burgers and my son and I enjoyed it, but it closed reciently and we thought we'd try their downtown location.  The downtown location is a much bigger operation and it's located in the lobby of the Marriot. Our customer experience there was pretty poor and the food was mediocre. It had an indifferent kind of vibe there, and it felt like the sort of restaurant that wouldn't last a season in Manhattan. I am thinking it's surviving because it's in a hotel lobby where they kind of have a built-in clientele and don't need to really rely on word-of-mouth or return customers. There is so much better food to be had in New York City. I highly recommend elsewhere.",,,
50,Motty A.,"Mahwah, NJ",4,107,48,1.0,2/17/2018,"We went to Bill's this evening for dinner. We chose Bill's for two reason: 1. We're Landry Select members and think the brand is usually good. 2. It was convenient, since we were staying at the hotel where it's located.We arrived at 5:45 when the restaurant was pretty empty and were quickly seated - but then, had to wait more than 10 minutes until anyone came over to have our drink order. At that point we were already ready to order. We got the Guacamole for appetizer and a couple of burgers. We also ordered disco fries, since burgers have no sides.The Guacamole was average - not too great and not too bad. We were hopeful for the burgers. The Burgers were the worse we ever had. You may wonder what was bad - The buns were burnt (not toasted) and the patties were:1. about half the size of the bun - which means it was mostly just the bun. 2. They were so overdone that their outside was hard and tasted greasy and burnt.Mcdonald's seems to be an order of magnitude better than these burgers. Since the place has Burger in the name, you'd assume it's at least decent.Finally - service was in-attentive, tough to get anything including refills on drinks or even the check.I would never ever go back - there are so many other options around - this place should not have long before it's closed.",1,,

Thought this would be a fun spot to meet given their March madness advertising. The picture I posted is from THEIR website and if you search best March madness bars in New York City they are listed as best places to watch on many sites. We walked in and they not only did not have the sound on but wouldn't put it on for the only game playing.  They wouldn't honor any of their specials, the ones that they advertised and are currently still advertising.If I'm gathering a group of ten plus friends to watch college basketball this lack of candor really taints your reputation. It's not easy to get ten to fifteen people to agree on a spot and travel from multiple neighborhoods.We had a drink or two each and split at halftime of the first game because of the customer service left taint. We generally like Bill's locations.We ended up cabbing it to another sports spot and are currently having a great time. I think you just lost a bunch of future customers.

Since the weather was nice, my friend and I sat outside on the patio. I ordered the shrimp burger with a fried egg and a side of fries. I was a bit nervous about he shrimp burger but it was actually SO delicious !! The shrimp Patty has whole shrimp in it which is always good--nothing chopped up and filled with breaking or something. Would definitely recommend if you don't want something as filling as a hamburger but still want something burger-like. The fries were just ok--no seasoning on them or anything which was disappointing. My friend got wings (something like honey habanero) which were very very filling and the sauce was thick and tangy. I would definitely return to a Bill's burger location especially since I am a Laundry's card member.",1,1,2

I had the slider's which were fine, but nothing to rave about. The regular fries were absolutely delicious. I loved how crispy they were. But for $4.50, they better have been amazing. I would definitely pass on the onion rings. They weren't very good and there were some that came out with way too many onion layers inside the batter. They're mixed drinks were OK.

Service was fast and that's probably the only really good thing. The Omelette that came out was frankly a greasy mess. The potatoes that came with it were unassuming but probably the best part of the meal. The omelette was dripping in grease and was tasteless even after a few rounds of salt and pepper, it was so bad I couldn't even finish it. The pancakes on the other hand were decent at best. They seemed okay but in comparison to other pancakes didn't really taste fresh, something I would expect from a place with prices like these for breakfast.

74,Melinda W.,"Marlborough, CT",0,5,5,1.0,9/4/2017,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I saw the mixed reviews, figured it couldn't be that bad, and we went for it out of convenience since we were staying at the Marriott. Don't make the same mistake we did... worst $90 dinner of my life! We walked in and asked the nearby waitress if we sit ourselves or if they sit us. She looked at me confused and said she wasn't sure and would go ask. Hm, ok, I didn't think that would be such an odd question. At least 3 waiters/waitresses made eye contact with us when we walked in but not one said anything. She came back and sat us.We ordered the loaded nachos for appetizers, we were starving and they looked amazing. First bite was full of stale chips, chili out of a can, and cheese wiz. Disgusting. But we still were holding out hope...My husband ordered their top 10 burger, I ordered the turkey BLT, and my son ordered their sliders. We also all ordered fries on the side (since they don't come with the burgers and it's an extra $5 or so for fries). My husband's burger was bland and he really couldn't understand how it landed as a top 10 burger. My sandwich was average, not bad, not great. My son who is only 12 years old and does not have a sophisticated palette by any means... didn't like his food. Imagine that! The sliders were greasy and clearly frozen. We all didn't enjoy the fries. They were also clearly frozen food and seriously lacking any seasoning or taste. We were all starving and not one of us came close to finishing our meals. I felt gross after eating what I did and honestly put their food right there with McDonalds or other fast food chains. I expect the price inflation for NYC but $90 for an appetizer and three meals which were NASTY is just a robbery. Our waiter was pleasant for the most part but he never asked how our food was... I'm guessing because he already knows the answer. The kitchen staff who deliver the food are clueless. He came over to our table multiple times with another table's meals and desserts. The waiter had to consistently redirect him. Bill's must get mostly tourists who are fooled by the ambience of the restaurant and the convenience of the location. For those that have rated this restaurant anymore than 2 stars, you are either hungover and enjoy greasy nasty food or are 5 drinks in and forgot what the meal really taste like!!",2,,

That's weird because I always thought of Anderson Cooper as a Bottom.",1,,

I visited twice, dinner and breakfast. The wings were good and my wife loved her burger. Egg white omelet and turkey bacon were adequate in the morning. TV layout is STRONG. If you're a stickler for cleanliness, the staff is a little slow clearing tables. All in all, a solid establishment but nothing to write home about.",,,1

Tonight, I was stuck in the FiDi again, due to a major storm and just could not decide where to eat. I decided to give Bill's another chance. You se, Bill's was often quite reliable for medium-priced delicious burgers and decent drinks. But, About a year or so ago I was extremely disappointed. Poor, confused, slow service, and worse, almost inedible food. But tonight I decided to give Bill's another chance. WOW. AM I glad I did. Food was right back to what I expected. Service was personalized and friendly and everyone called me by name as though I was everyone's best friend. Burger was delicious, and perfectly cooked. While the place was busy, the staff and management paid attention to me as though I was the only person there. I am sure everyone here tonight felt the same way. Bill's is back baby!!!!!",,,

Do recommend for the burgers. Good price as well.",,,
117,Rachel L.,"New York, NY",21,153,411,4.0,2/8/2017,"I've been here twice and enjoyed my meal both times - even more so on my second visit! The place is spacious (i.e. they don't cram all the tables together) and it never gets too crowded (probably due to its location)! I like that there are plenty of booth seats too - but I think most booths only fit 4 people comfortably, so you may not get these if you are in a big group. There are also plenty of TV screens around, airing different channels (mostly sports). First visit, I had the BBQ bacon burger and opted for a pretzel bun instead of the usual. Burgers don't come with fries, so you have to order it separately. We got an order of disco fries to share, but I suggest just sticking to the regular fries instead. The disco fries reminded me of poutine except that the version here was just... Ok. Second visit, I tried the kimchi bomb burger. I think this is a new addition to the menu as I don't recall seeing it on the menu on my first visit. I chose to add cheddar to my burger as it originally doesn't come with any cheese. I loved it! The crispy shallots, spicy kimchi relish and shredded cabbage went so well with the burger patty, which was cooked perfectly medium rare as I requested. My boyfriend chose to have the Fat Cat when he saw that it won the CNN top 10 burger award. Another great burger with caramelized onion and English muffin instead of your usual sesame bun. But I still liked the kimchi bomb burger more! We also ordered onion rings and coleslaw as sides. Onion rings were crispy but not too greasy; coleslaw was not lauded in mayo and tasted refreshing instead.Non-pretentious, inexpensive (burgers are about $11 on average) and the food satisfies. All in all, a great place to chill and eat!",1,,2

I had the pleasure of having Havolin as my server. No matter how busy it got, she still managed to check in with me to make sure I was enjoying my meal.

We were seated almost immediately although it was very full. I was on crutches so they moved me from a tall table to a regular booth . Our waiter was very friendly and attentive . We ordered a Reuben, mini burgers, chicken sandwich, specialized hamburger, cheese fries and regular fries. All items were given a thumbs up by each of us. It was more than filling. Two people could easily split one order of fries. Price is right for items ordered. Recommend!",,,

Bill's is a no-muss, no-fuss burger mini-chain that happened to be right there. I would say that's about the right amount of effort anyone should make to come here - about one block.  New York has hundreds of burgers, plenty of fries and a good number of bars. Nothing really stands out here, except the service, which I found to be exceptionally friendly. There wasn't much of a crowd between the bar and the dining room. Perhaps that's because this level of food is pretty old hat here. It's not bad, there are just better options for those willing to walk even just a bit.",1,,

I got take out and the food was prepared quickly which was nice.  Way over priced however.I got the cheeseburger, added carmelized onions and bacon. Bacon was nothing special. The carmelized onions were good though, added flavor and texture. Adding the onion was .50 and added bacon was $2! So my burger was $12 total, and with a side of sweet potato fries ($5), the After tax total was $18.50!! Pricy, as burger doesn't come with fries.Overall good food , but at the price point I would take my money elsewhere.",2,,

I think there was only one other table with diners at that point. Pleasant young man came over within a minute to ask if we wanted coffee, tea or juice. A minute after that a zombie like young man came over to ask if we'd like coffee, tea or juice. We told him we had already ordered. Took a moment for him to process that. He then asked if we were ready to order our meal. He was unable to answer basic questions about the yogurt, but did offer to find out. We said not necessary. He took our orders and walked away as coffee and juice were being served. Breakfast arrived quickly and the 2 of us who ordered pancakes with bacon were very pleased, as was the person who ordered the yogurt. For a restaurant in a hotel the prices were reasonable. I doubt that I'll have reason to go there again myself but it is a nice place for breakfast near the WTC memorial.",,,

When we walked in the waiter (some bald guy) didn't even tell us his name, he seemed decently nice at first until I asked if I could charge my phone (I even had my own charger & I was on 11%) to which he looked as if I had just asked if I could chop off his hand, his response was a very defensive ""no, no way. If I do that I could get fired."" A simple ""NO I'm sorry we are unable to do that"" would of sufficed. From that moment on he was very rude and provided TERRIBLE service. It took about a half hour to order our drinks (all sprites) and another 15 minutes to get them. Finally we placed our order of fries as an appetizer and 4 salads as an entree. We said ""the fries will come out first right?"" To which he said yes. About another 40 minutes go by and still no food. He finally brings the FRIES AND SALADS over at the same time and says ""you ladies are gonna kill me but these came out at once"" we wouldn't of killed him if he had bothered to refill our empty water glasses in the 40 minutes we had to wait for fries and salads that weren't even supposed to go out at the same time. My friend Sydney politely asked for more water as he dumped our food on our table and he gruffly replied ""in a second, as you can see it's pretty busy in here""The WAITER acted like WE were waiting on HIM. He was a complete and utter ass hole. He never asked us how our meals were and instead started vigorously sweeping the floor instead of checking on his few tables with empty water glasses. When we finally flagged him down to get the bill we asked to split it four ways to which he replied ""oh I don't think I can do that. If I can't split it 4 ways, is 3 ok?"" UM NO. I was a waitresses and it's very easy to split the bill. I've split a bill 10 ways before this guy was either completely uneducated or just plain rude and lazy. About another 15 minutes went by and he slammed the bill down on the table without saying a word. We tipped him $1 each and got the hell out of that place. As we were leaving he said ""thanks ladies, pretty cool I figured out how to split it 4 ways huh?!""Did he want a medal? He said he has worked in the restaurant industry for 15 years which is shocking considering he can't divide by 4 people and he provides horrendous, rude, and SLOW service.

Also, the noise level was so loud that I could not carry on a conversation with the person sitting right next to me without having to repeat myself over and over.This might be a great place to grab a drink with friends after work, but I would not advise having dinner here if you are looking for good food with good conversation.",5,5,6

Updated review","The food was very good.  Service was not up to standard for breakfast.  Walked in at 7:05 and hostess was not at station. A waiter casually greeted us and told us to sit anywhere. There was a wait to take our order. After we asked for coffee he went over to chat with hostess rather than get coffee.  Then he was involved with a discussion with the manager about a colleague not helping him.  All of these actions affected the service.  To the manager who responded:I appreciate your effort.  We were the first customers of the day and the name on the bill was Mike Hammond, my friend.  The person who waited on us was a male.  The manager was also a male.  Neither were very interested in my complaints.  The bill was 46 and change. Saturday night I returned to the restaurant for dessert about 9:30 or 10 pm.  There was no host at either stand, at least 2 waiters failed to acknowledge me so I left.  I complained at the hotel at the front desk.  They said they get these complaints all of the time.  The experience Saturday night indicates that your restaurant has issues providing acceptable levels of service.  It is not just one employee.",,,

I got my life together and went to Bill's. It was Great. ""The Fat Cat"" was amazing, and I thought it was BS that CNN rated it top 10. Upon my first bite of this burger, I found it was NOT a mistake! The fat cat had these deliciously sweet caramelized onions, perfectly melted cheese, and the beef itself was good. It was a little overcooked, but I didn't specify how I wanted it cooked. I'll let you decide who's fault that is! The sweet potato fries were good, but I feel like it's tough for sweet potato fries to really stand out. They're either good or bad. Sooo.. Fat Cat is definitely recommended and I'll be back",,,

So we had to look for an alternative. Seven of us got seated right away.. dont know whether or not it is a good thing when it happens.. I should have been more suspicious. From the first look the place was too messy for a chain burger joint in FinDi. No locals, tourists only.. Suspicious again.. Service was OK, as in not great. Not to sound like an a-hole but it is nice to have a fresh drink at the right time. Food was also just OK.. no WOWs.. Burger was, as the whole place, too messy. Too much going on..Too many ingredients that were too hard to keep together.. Though the mix looked good on the menu, I ended up eating half of the burger with a fork..

The burgers are reasonable priced and extras are very accessible. We doubled up on the patty and added a chopped salad to share. The salad was reasonably sized and tasty, but dressed a little too heavily. Ask for dressing on the side. The burger was just as we wanted - cooked right, juicy and sloppy. No regrets.",,,1

I ordered a side of fries and a Fat Cat burger (caramelized onion, american cheese, special sauce, LTP on an english muffin), which seemed promising given its CNN's Top 10 Burger Award winner status. The staff was helpful when putting in my takeout order and told me it would be about 10-15 minutes. Fast forward 5 minutes and my food was ready.... initially, hungry me was v happy but that soon faded after I tasted the food. The burger was greasy and tasteless, and the fries were completely stale. Perhaps the food is better when you're dining in but, for a $17 meal, I don't think I'm coming back to find out.",,,

155,Suzee B.,"Moses Lake, WA",0,64,2,1.0,4/22/2017,"Went here for breakfast. Huge disappointment. Our waiter took our order & ignored us til he brought the check. Wouldn't even look at us! We had to flag down other waiters for flatware, more coffee, etc. it wasn't even busy. Food was just ok.  We're Marriott Platinum members & had vouchers for free breakfast--maybe the freebies had something to do with mediocre service?",,1,
156,Leah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,10,2,4.0,4/1/2017,"I know it's weird, but I got the chicken chopped salad at a place with ""burger"" in the name...and it was surprisingly great. I bet the burger is the safe option, but Bill's has variety of choices on its menu, so you won't feel locked into a slab of beef if you prefer something different like I did.",1,,
157,Earl M.,"Minneapolis, MN",1,18,0,3.0,6/12/2017,"Mostly hotel guests and tourists. Like many posts have mentioned, service is casual / passive. For example, I had about a third of my salad eaten before the wine I ordered at the same time arrived. I sat with no wine or food for over five minutes before my server checked in. I saw another table sending wings back to the kitchen.Does okay in a pinch, but nothing special.",,,

159,Carolina C.,"Guaynabo, Puerto Rico",6,38,15,2.0,5/23/2017,"Ok, so the first time we came here, our waiter was amazing (shoutout to Gregory). The downside was that the wings came out frozen on the inside--twice. Gregory was very nice about it and replaced it again (it was still cold, but I was hungry). He gave me beer recommendations and was very nice. The second time I came to this place, I got served by another waiter (I don't remember his name), and he was terrible. Took forever to bring things, and literally laughed in my face and said: ""You look like you're 12. I'm gonna have to see an ID."" You can say you just need to see my ID, no need to say I look 12. When he brought out my beer, it was very warm. I'm very disappointed.",,,

We had a high top table, which was small and I'm not a huge fan of but whatever.I had the Onion Soup Burger $10.95 with caramelized onions, gruyère cheese, sherry, onion brioche. It was messy but pretty good. It was the perfect size to be filling but not painfully so. We split some disco fries $5.95, which were alright. I've definitely had better and larger portions for that price.Also, we had a pitcher of beer that the waitress recommended, which was refreshing. The waitress was super friendly and nice. I really liked her. It's a decent quick bite if you need it but pricier than other burger joints because it's a full sit down restaurant (even if they seat you at the bar area).",2,1,1

And the pretzel bun was an nice touch.  If I were you, I'd dumb down your order and speak slow, oh and stick to burgers.  Anything else is a crapshoot.",,1,

166,Nik X.,"New Haven, CT",1,44,20,2.0,1/3/2017,Came here thinking it was going to be fun and delicious. It was also right near our hotel. The waitstaff was OK. Pretty short with us. Not even hi my name is... or didn't give us more then 25 seconds to look at the menu. We got our app in literally 3 minutes. But didn't get out drinks for 20. Food was OK. I get it's NY but I come here all the time with my kids. $14 for a grilled cheese kids meal is just stupid absurd. And I'm the stupid one who paid for it. My chicken wasn't cooked all the way. I didn't argue it because our waitress never came back and someone else gave us the bill. While I got sick from undercooked chicken because my husband said it looked ok. Until he looked again and said maybe not.Never again.,,,

168,Allen M.,"Acworth, GA",1,135,1,3.0,6/6/2017,In the area and staying at the Marriott. Needed a late night meal and Bills was convenient. Had the Southwest burger and it was good. Bun was perfect size for the . A bit of spice from the queso and Pico de gallo which was expected and we'll balanced. The meat had great flavor and was almost overcooked. My one complaint is the fries. A joint that specializes in burgers should serve some extraordinary . These seemed frozen and nothing to be excited over.,,,

170,Bill B.,"Miami, FL",34,44,8,3.0,1/24/2017,"This is one of the most paradoxical reviews I have written. First the good - service, fries, beer and delivers on its theme as a gastropub.  That bad - the burger. It was tough, contained chunks of gristle and lacked taste. The waiter was awesome and the manager bent over backwards when he found out I was not pleased with the burger. I just wish they took as much care in the back of the house as the front. When you are called ""Bill's Bar & Burger"", the burger should be supreme, right?",2,1,1

We were very quiet and polite, but the waiter couldn't even take the time out to introduce himself.The second night we ordered take out.

Food has recently been upgraded and the burgers are great with loads of classic options for appetizers. Service when busy is spotty but went there during the olympics on a Sunday when it wasn't too rammed and found the waiters to be very attentive. Boneless wings are a must.

The atmosphere was alright - very much like a sports bar with a lot of light and TVs around. The service was what you would expect - fairly decent. My biggest complaint would be the food. I just wanted a little snack and I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. I think this is a fairly simple dish and most places get it right. It was obvious the dip had been heated up in the microwave and the chips were extremely stale. If you can't even serve fresh chips, I think there's a serious problem. I probably would've been better off at the TGI Fridays. I can't speak to the burgers since I didn't try them.",,1,2

Updated review","I live right next door and today I got a really bad service from the maître dI asked to sit outside at a table for me, my wife and daughter, but she said you cannot sit more than two outside, so I said that then I'll have my daughter in my lap, and thought it was really strange but she said a few times that we could not sit more than two people at a tableWhen we got out she wanted us to sit at another table because the one we wanted was not cleaned, and clearly I could see it was because she did not want to clean it, but we insisted so she got a busboy to clean it.What then happened is that the busboy suddenly came with a highchair for us and it shows that either your maître d was to lazy to get us a highchair and instead lied to us.This maître d seems to be the laziest I've ever seen and lies because she's simply too lazy.I used to really like this place as you might see from one of my earlier reviews, but this really made me angry.Won't be back for a while.",,,
