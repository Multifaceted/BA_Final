We got sat by the window just as we requested.For drinks we ordered la flor and the tamarind island both which our server carolina recommended, and they were amazing. We started off with the crispy arepas, and as for entrees I had the churrasco and my boyfriend the pollo a la plancha. Our experience was amazing thanks to Carolina, great service.

Updated review","We had a reservation for 5 people at 830pm on a Saturday and while myself and my partner arrived on time, the other 3 arrived late.  When we pulled up, there were qite a dew people waiting for tables. They have valet parking for $7 and there is ample personnel to handle the colume of cars pulling up. We got a quick drink at the bar while we waited. The restaurant has to have all parties available before they seat you, which is fair.  We lost the reservation because they showed up almost 30 mins late. We all went to the bar when rhey arrived and we were feeling bad since we lost our reservation.  After ordering drinks, one of the nicest waitresses, Sayuri said she had a table for us. You dont know how excited everyone was to have a table ready so fast. The other waiter, Javier came by and it was all uphill from there.  The had a live band playing salsa when you enter the restaurant.  These guys kick butt playing superbly.While ordering our apperizer, Sayuri and Javier took really good care of us. We ordered the chorizo mac and cheese, the crispy arepas, the chicharon de pollo (chicken on the stick) and the lobster and crab stick. The chorizo mac and cheese has a little bite to it but the flavor comes out. The chicken on the stick was really good and the drinks were on point. My friends ordered a variety of different drinks that are so colorful.  When i 1st walled in, the place is somber in lights and the menus are lighted to see them better. The bartender did not have the Frenet Blanco i needed for my queezy stomach, he gave me a sambuca and it actually worked.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays including my own.  They brought out a flaming thing for dessert and sang for both of us. With great music, the ambiance and the food, there is no way you cannot have a great time here. Sayuri and Javier were constantly checking in on us and were very delightful to have waiting on us.  The really made our day special. When you come here, make a reservation. There is a view of Manhattan so it is quite romantic here. In fact someone proposed to his futire wife this night and the restaurant exploded with joy. We all had a great time!",,,
3,Melody C.,"Brooklyn, NY",18,141,277,5.0,11/3/2018,"I was a little iffy about coming here because 1. It's all the way in LIC and 2. Latin food is not my fave. But I'm so glad I did. I came on a rainy night so I missed out on whatever view this place offers. Blend on the Water was ""yuugee,"" there was a bar area, tables in the main dining area, and some more seats in the back in a more quiet section. My party of six was brought to the quiet section which was good because we were able to hear ourselves talk (until a loud drunk party was also brought to the back). Our waitress, Sayuri, was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu items. We kept asking her about the portion sizes. She told us the fish bowl (midsummer night's dream) would be good for two people, so we also got a pitcher of rose sangria (good for four people). We still shared the fish bowl among us six people (she gave us six straws). We all thought the fish bowl was a lot better than the rose sangria. 10/10 would get again. For the table, we got the chicharron de pollo skewers (lightly battered chicken breast, mango beurre blanc) which only comes with three skewers but we just split it because we still wanted to save room for our entrees. You must must get this! It was soo delicious, mainly because of the mango beurre blanc. We also got the chorizo mac and cheese for the table, some people loved it and some people didn't care too much about it. I also got the chorizo mac and cheese as my entree cause I'm a mac and cheese fiend. It was a bit too liquid-y for my taste and the chorizo was good at first but became too much after awhile. Two people got the pernil (pork shank) which was pretty good; the pork fell right off. Two people got the arroz con mariscos and both only managed to eat half.We told the staff that it was our friend's birthday celebration, and they gave us the complimentary birthday platter with a sparkler/candle. The platter consisted of four different desserts including chocolate lava cake with ice cream, coconut flan, and pina colada tres leches cake. Anyway we had a lovely time here thanks to Sayuri. I would definitely come back again (albeit far) to try the other dishes! Oh, and the menu freaking lights up when you open it. How cool is that?!",,1,

Updated review","Love, Love, Love this place.  I visited Blend with a co-worker after work for her Birthday on a Tuesday evening. The place was packed. We had a little wait but it was worth it. When I checked in I received a free white Sangria which was made just right. *Five stars for the drink alone!*  Our waitress was fabulous - No complaints. The ambience was Beautiful-Definately No complaints.  Music on point. Food presentation was Beautiful and delectable. My Favorite evening spot. Valet parking available...street parking is also available after you ride around for a while. Subway station is a little ways away. Everything is fairly priced",2,,1
5,Daria D.,"Brooklyn, NY",27,141,876,5.0,8/28/2018,"I came here for brunch two weekends ago to catch up with old friends. Our waitress was Sayuri and she was an absolute sweetheart! Not only did we all love our food and drinks, but she made our experience even better. The restaurant does offer valet parking for $7, which we opted for after making one circle around the block (parking is difficult in this area, don't bother). If you check in on Yelp you get a free sangria (per person/per check-in). Do so before entering the restaurant because even when connected to their WiFi, the connection is still pretty weak. The sangria is strong and full of flavor. Definitely recommend it. Some people from our group had other drinks and enjoyed them as well. I am looking forward to returning to Blend on the Water again for brunch and trying it out for dinner as well.",2,,
6,Sarah S.,"Rochester, NY",292,75,286,4.0,10/16/2018,"Came on Saturday around 5:30 PM. We were late for our reservation, but they were still able to squeeze us in, which I was happy about (damn NYC traffic). Luckily they have a valet service for $7, because parking was nowhere to be found. The place is very large with high ceilings and lots of windows. The ambiance is really nice at night, when you can actually see the bridge on the water. During the day, there is a lot of natural lighting. For an appetizer, we got the piononos, which had garlic chicken and sweet plantains. This was a great appetizer, as it had a variety of flavors. The sweetness paired with the garlic chicken was nice. I also got a lychee mojito, which was incredible and came with real sugar cane. As an entree, I got the salmon, which was really finely seasoned and cooked. It came with asparagus, which was cooked tender and also had good flavor. Complemented very well by the pineapple reduction sauce that it was placed in. The mashed potatoes seemed like they were pureed a bit thin for my liking--it was hard to even get them on my fork--but the flavor of the potatoes made the salmon really excellent. My boyfriend got the filet mignon (medium-well), which I had a bite of, and it was great. Since it was someone's birthday, we did do a dessert; we got the sampler of 3 different cakes; the chocolate, the Pina colada, the coconut flan, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It came with a nice fancy sparkler. The chocolate cake was EXTREMELY rich. Like, I'm talking you can't have two bites without having a gulp of water in between. It was perfect for a chocolate lover like me. The Pina colada was a lighter cake, with real pineapples over the top. Coconut flan was good as well. I have to give only 4 stars because of the service--our waitress was a bit dismissive, and kept trying to walk away before we could even finish a sentence. I understand that the restaurant is busy on a Saturday night, but your job will be easier if you actually listen to people before you walk away and they end up having to flag you down again just for a refill or bottle of hot sauce.",4,,1
7,Victoria X.,"New York, NY",536,602,528,3.0,8/17/2018,"1 free sangria with a yelp check-in; spotty service in this area so make sure you have the offer pulled up before you sit downThey have WiFi, but that is also very spotty.The restaurant itself is very big and spacious with high ceilings. For a party of 8, we came on a Thursday at around lunch time and was seated immediately. Our waitress was very friendly and took our orders right away; I ordered the Taquitos de Carne. The drinks came out approx. 5 minutes after ordering, and all the food came out pretty quickly, approx. 15 minutes after ordering, except for mine, even though we all ordered at the same time. I can only guess that the waitress forgot to put in my order. Because my order didn't come, every one at the table had to wait another 10 minutes or so for my food to come out before they ate.The Taquitos de Carne was a 3 pieces of soft shell steak taco - taquitos may confuse some into thinking it's the deep fried egg roll. The steak tacos were good; I just wished it came out when everyone else's food came out because by then all their food went cold. Whilst drinking my sangria, I noticed an odd blue object floating around in the drink. I dug it up and found a part of a scrubber in there. This grossed me out, but it was too late to say anything about it as we have already paid and was about to leave. It was just a bit disappointing to end my meal that way since I had a decent time here aside from my order never being entered, and the blue dish scrubber floating in my sangria. Perhaps some quality control and revision is needed here.",3,,1
8,Patty P.,"East Meadow, NY",54,82,648,3.0,8/13/2018,"Came in here due to the great reviews & tasty pictures posted... unfortunately it looks better than what it is... I'm not saying it wasn't good, it was just ok...Service, they weren't excellent but they were good enough... let's start at the beginning So they have Valet parking but you have to pay for it ($7 not a lot for city location) but really ?! You're getting my money in the restaurant & out of it too ?! (Mind you they park it in the street, i didn't see a lot!) There is a door man, which was very nice & friendlyWhen you walk in about 6 hostess hanging out in the front & although they weren't rude they weren't friendly.. they did sit us down almost right away (for a party of 12!) that was really nice Waitress came, took our orders but didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, nor gave us a drink menu.. since they serve water I guess we didn't notice to half way through which is when everyone called/ ask waitress for them Food came out in a nice timely matter I had the arepas appetizers, they were goodAlso ate the churrasco & it was a bit mediocre... steak was a bit tough, not juicy, edible... but I had better meat, at tons of other places for a lot less My husband had the seafood rice which had tons of seafood taste, in every bite but too many vegetables over powering the dish My son had the sausage Mac/ cheese & he loved it, super cheesy Last but not least, I checked in on Yelp & received a free sangria offer & they wouldn't acknowledge it .. she said it had to be redeemed during certain days/ hours ..which I thought was so horrible...& no I wouldn't go back so there goes that !!!",3,1,1

The waitress, seemed nice, but maybe was new or had too many tables... not sure. It took her almost 20 minutes to just take our order. We were starving at that point lol So fast forwarding, we all got our Entree's, except myself. She apologized and said there was a mix-up and my dish was taken to another table that had ordered the same thing (odd), ok no problem. I waited...My food came out shortly after and unfortunately it was pretty bland :-/  I wanted to tell our waitress but she just disappeared ::poof:: I flagged down another waiter and asked him to get her for me but she never came. Actually, the next time we saw her was when she brought our bill. I had already ate most of my food by then... it wasn't BAD just extremely under-seasoned.

Updated review","Unfortunately only 2 stars due to the horrible table service by the waitress. We arrived for our reservation, and went to the bar for a drink or two. The bartender was great, she was personable and drinks came quick. I received a text 25 min after our scheduled reservation that our table was ready. It was a little long to wait considering we had a reservation, but whatever.The food is very good, full of flavor and a nice size portion for the main course. The poke taco for appetizer was very good, I just wish there was 4 on the plate and not 3.Our server was nonexistent, non attentive, not personable, never came to check on the quality of our dinner, just horrible. One of the worst waitresses we have had in years at any establishment. We waited almost 15 min before she even came over to the table after the hostess seated us. I asked my wife if she wanted to leave and go somewhere else, just then the hostess came over and took our order. The next time we saw her was when it was time for the bill.Mention this to one of the owners as we were leaving, she was apologetic and sincere, but for me the damage was done. This was our date night spot and we just wish the dinning experience was better, no complaints about the food, it was very good.",,,

The food was better than I expected as I am not crazy about latin american food but wow it was delicious! I had the Huevos Rancheros with scrambled eggs instead of sunny side up. It was delicious I cleaned that plate in no time. My friends had the Chicken Vacafrita and the Pernil, both delicious. Cool space but slow service. They were really busy when we left around 2pm so I'd strongly suggest a reservation. I would love to come back for dinner with a night view of the city.",2,,

18,James W.,"New York, NY",165,276,401,1.0,3/17/2018,"This place is absolutely overhyped and overpriced. I, as well as many other Yelp reviewers, are shocked by the plethora of high-rated reviews. My friends and I made a reservation for a Friday night to celebrate a birthday. I would highly recommend making a reservation, especially for Friday-Sunday. The restaurant was completely packed. Prior to arrival, I was a little stressed out about what to wear since the restaurant enforces a strict dress code that is posted on their main website as well as on the Open Table e-mail confirmation. However, they seem to contradict each other on whether or not sneakers are allowed. On Open Table, it says sneakers are allowed (with a collared shirt and blazer), but boots of any kind are not allowed? On their main website, sneakers are not allowed. Since this was a birthday dinner, I didn't want to get turned away for not abiding by their dress code. I ended up wearing straight black jeans, a plaid collared button down shirt, blue blazer, and Oxford boots, and thankfully didn't get turned away. Aside from their confusing dress code, here are some other of their other house rules:1) they don't seat you unless your whole party is present2) there is a 15 minute grace period to hold your reservation before your table is given away- plan accordingly, the closest train station (21st Street/Jackson Avenue on the G-line) is approximately a 15-minute walk to the restaurant3) Yelp check-in for 1 free Sangria- only applies to Monday-Thursday, but the 7% Yelp cash-back applies to Monday-Friday4) there's an automatic 20% gratuity for parties of 6+5) another Yelper mentioned that you're required to order an entree, regardless of how many appetizers/desserts/drinks you order (I'm not sure how true this is since I didn't personally experience this)- but, worth a mentionThe restaurant is beautiful and has high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic views of the East River, the Queensboro Bridge, and the East side of Manhattan. They also have menus/receipt folders that blind your eyes with fluorescent light because the restaurant is so dark and you can't read the menu without it. The whole experience was a complete let down. I felt like this place was ""trying too hard"" with an air of pretentiousness/stuffiness from the dress code, to the Guido bouncer/doorman/gatekeeper, to the overdone, heavy-make-up hostess + waitress, down to the bathroom attendant. Listen, this is Long Island City. This isn't even a Michelin-rated restaurant (far from it). It's not Per Se, it's not Le Bernardin, it's just not of that caliber.The food isn't spectacular and the prices are considerably high. My meal was also interrupted at least 5 separate times by sparklers- by, the 4th or 5th time I saw a dessert with sparklers, the excitement had already worn off and I was getting annoyed. Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming here. The view is nice, but aside from that, the restaurant is really far- isolated from the rest of LIC- probably great for people who live at or near the LIC waterfront and are limited in dining options. The food and drinks aren't anything special and the ambiance was too much of that of a nightclub you'd find in the Meatpacking District- it just wasn't my scene. I would rather eat at a restaurant down the street on Vernon Blvd.",13,2,
19,Esmira J.,"HOWARD BEACH, NY",3,89,187,4.0,5/27/2018,"I haven't been to Blend on the Water in years, because they're usually crowded. But with Friday's beautiful weather we wanted to sit outside. Blend didn't disappoint, they actually stepped their game up. Wait time was minimal and we were seated outside as requested when we made the reservations. Though it was still quite early, we had 5:45 reservations, and were seated a bit after 6 since one of our friends didn't get there until almost 6. The drinks are always consistent, I always get the PassionFruit Mojito, a bit sweet for my liking but it's a good strong. My friends like there Coconut Mojito and Mango Margarita on the rocks. The guacamole is always good. It's our go to app, not discussions needed. They add a good amount of jalapeños when you order it spicy, and the chips are house made. We also ordered the Poke Tacos, which were loaded with fresh yummy tuna atop of the traditional taco condiments. All in all very refreshing, I'd strongly recommend it. For the entree, I ordered the garlic and oil shrimp with fettuccine. The dish appeared small but was quite filling. The shrimps were decent in size, and the pasta was cooked well. There was fresh tomatoes diced into the garlic and oil, garlic was just rite, oil was a bit much. But good none the less. One of my friends ordered the Salmon, very decent in size and served with charred cherry tomatoes (yum). Pineapple reduction (yum, again) and asparagus. Nothing spectacular, but surely good. The seared Tilapia with coconut sauce was delicious. The coconut sauce was fitting, not overwhelmingly sweet and perfectly present in the mean. Coconut sauce can sometimes overwhelm the dish.  Not in this case, everything went together well. We didn't have any room for desserts, maybe next time.",,,
20,Jennifer A.,"Queens, NY",72,119,374,5.0,3/25/2018,This was a surprise dinner for Valentine's Day and I loved every moment. We sat at the bar to wait for our party of 6. I had a strawberry mojito which was perfection!! We were seated right away and given water and menus. The menus were really cool because they light up. We ordered guacamole to start and it was fresh and zesty! There drinks were amazing because we ended up ordering 3 to 4 rounds of drinks after getting served at the bar! Hahaha! Then we ordered salmon and filet mignon for entrees. The salmon was soft and buttery. The filet mignon was tender and juicy. I was so excited that it was cooked to perfection medium well which many restaurants fail to do.I always have to have desert! We ordered the sampler which was great to share.The view is amazing and great for taking pictures! I will definitely return here no questions asked!,1,1,2

Updated review","My husband and I stumbled upon this place by accident over a year ago after having dinner at nearby Water's Edge on a Saturday night. We were looking for a place for a nightcap and a view, and Blend does both those things well. I had a piña colada, which was super yummy, just booze enough, and topped with shaved coconut. Hubby had a beer (he's boring... And mildly allergic to hard liquor). We loved the vibe there- good music, great service, nice views, plus the mix of bar scene, dinner dates, & group celebrations, so we kept it in mind and made reservations for my mom's birthday a few weeks later. She was wished a happy birthday by the manager when we arrived, we got a good table and attentive service throughout our meal, and her dessert was beautifully plated with a sparkler. My husband and I visited again this week and had another good experience, so I figured I owed the place a positive review on Yelp :) Here's what appeals to me about Blend on the Water:+location (As the name suggests, it's on the water- the East River, to be exact. The sidewalk leads you directly to Gantry State Plaza, which is a lovely place for a pre- or post-meal stroll. Gorgeous views of the Empire State Building, Chrystler Building, and the rest of the Manhattan Skyline.)+service (We haven't had a bad experience yet. Waitstaff and bartenders are friendly and attentive.)+drinks (Mixed drinks are good, beer selection is respectable, and the happy hour specials are nice. Free sangria with Yelp check-ins)+food (We've tried the mussels, chicken vacafrita, guacamole + chips, huevos rancheros, arroz y mariscos, and mofongo con camarones al ajillo. Food is yummy and nicely plated. Not the absolute best Latin cuisine I've ever had, but good. My only real complaint is that the mofongo portion was small. The 6 decent-sized shrimp it came with were good, but they could have been served on twice as much mofongo, especially since any dishes that come with rice & beans seem to have so much for food for the price.)Super happy to have this place in Queens... I'll definitely be back!",,,
22,Albert W.,"Brooklyn, NY",196,957,554,4.0,10/3/2018,"Fantastic environment along the waterfront in LIC.  The environment has a very fun atmosphere where the music is somewhat loud.  The service was attentive, though it was quite for a dinner on a Tuesday night at 5pm.  The Yelp Sangria check in was really nice and refreshing.  We ordered the Lobster & Crab Tequenos, Pernil, and a side of Asparagus to share.  The Tequinos were pretty interesting and while you get the flavor of the lobster and crab, the dough of it was pretty thick so I didn't get much filling.  The pernil was very tasty - excellent sauce, rice, and overall flavor.  The asparagus was cooked well.  It is a touch pricey, but the service was exceptional and the complimentary tres leches for my birthday guest was very kind.  A great option to come back to.",1,,1
23,Tiffany M.,"Queens, NY",240,229,469,5.0,3/3/2018,"Came here for brunch with the girls and it was lovely. As you drive up, you'll see parking sucks. You'll be extremely lucky if you find a spot, however they do offer $7 valet which is very reasonable. We had an 11:00am reservation.The decor of the restaurant is very beautiful...Not extremely fancy, but chic. They send you an extensive dress code when making a reservation, however I did see people who violated the code so who knows. The dining room is huge and can accommodate large and small parties. I started off with a peach bellini which was excellent. There are no unlimited drink deals but the brunch drinks are reasonably priced. I ordered the steak and eggs with potatoes and it was very good. Steak was cooked exactly to my liking, still tender, and perfect with the chimichurri sauce. I followed up with a white sangria, which was free with check in, and that was excellent as well. Totally pleased with my meal, drinks, and service.As for service, we had Sayuri and she was great. She's the one who reminded us to check-in to get the free sangria! She was extremely pleasant and she made sure we were satisfied throughout our entire meal. Ask for her and tip well. She deserves it! Before we picked up our cars from valet, we took a picture by the water.

It was a party if 13 people, and Michelle was our waitress and she did a superb job at taking care of us. I loved the guacamole and vegetarian paella, but the others at the table weren't too happy with the other food. We had a fixed menu which included the salmon and chicken and people in which people weren't too fond of. One other thing was that we had an hour remaining for our party and the plates that were full of food were taken off the table . They did give us complimentary sangria at the beginning and tequila at the end. Thank you",,,

Likely nicer in the evening.Went there for Saturday brunch at 1pm, only half of the place was filled. Good service, adequate attentiveness. Food was so-so. My companion did not enjoy the eggs and steak - the skirt steak was stringy and has quite some intense, beefy flavor, but was medium prepared as it states on the menu. My veggie burger was good with nice soft brioche buns. The strawberry mango salad on the side though, was too sweet to my taste, though they give you a nice amount of veggies. Price range is much better than brunches in Manhattan.Overall it was okay.",,,

Waitress had no knowledge of the menu and we went in for happy hour and told her we wanted happy hour drinks and she still let us order something from the non happy hour menu, I get it upsell us but don't trick us. I order the mangu dish, being Dominican this is  atypical breakfast breakfast/lunch and what I got from their kitchen was some blended mess! I kid you not it looked like it was either put through a blender or a juicer. It looked pretty gross and tasted bleh. Find a better place with better food and better service!",5,,

I personally ordered the Taquitos De Carne. Except for the fact that it was corn-based tacos, I liked everything else from the rice/beans/meat bites. I ended up eating everything with a fork cause it was getting messy. But, it was good.Besides the food, the thing that made this place special was the fact that I got a birthday candle and my friends and I got to get free dessert on the house for sharing a picture to social media. They offer many small perks like this among other things. They don't ask questions and are generous in doing so. That's what made me like this place even more.",,,

We ordered the shrimp, chicken skewers and chorizo Mac and cheese. I highly recommend the Mac and cheese. It was so good and comforting on a cold day. The birthday desert was amazing as well. Highly recommend for birthday celebrations but make reservations in advance.",,,
29,Isabel J.,"Sunnyside, NY",858,1500,1260,5.0,1/9/2018,I was lucky enough to have been here a few years back for a Yelp Elite event. I have also been here for appetizers and drinks at the bar but never for dinner.When my bf asked me where I would like to go for my bday I decided this would be a great place since its near my house and I was feeling a bit lazy.We were seated by the window and you would have never guessed it was a cold chilly Monday since the place had a nice crowd. If you are planning on coming here I would suggest you make reservations.We started with the arepitas and chorizo mac & cheese. Both were really good but I really love their arepitas topped with shredded beef.I decided to have the churrasco with cilantro mash potatoes and my bf the pernil.Both dishes were delicious and we both kept raving about how flavorful everything was even the rice and beans.Now if its your bday they bring you a dessert with a nice big sparkler. I had the coconut flan since I love coconut and flan and this dessert didn't disappoint it was delicious.Every dish I had was amazing and one better than the other. I had an amazing bday dinner :),10,6,9

32,Angelina M.,"Bronx, NY",32,73,101,2.0,6/12/2018,"This place has a nice ambiance but that's the only good thing I left with. They're not great at handling large parties. We were a party of 25 celebrating a birthday.1. The reservation was for 8pm and we didn't get sat until 8:20.2. Although we got sat at 8:20 the waiter didn't take our dinner order until 9:30 (I looked at the time)and since we were a large party we were ordering from a prefixed menu with 5 options. I remember feeling a little irritated because service was so slow and I didn't want to be there all night. There was no reason it took an hour and ten minutes to take our dinner order. They should of had two people working the party instead of one.3. The price!! It was $55 for the prefixed menu. It came with two shared appetizers, and it's was shared between every 5 people. which we each got one piece of, and a meal which I didn't eat because it was nasty. I later looked at the prices on the regular menu. It was $10 for one and $12 for the other adding up to $22 for both. So it seems like they up the prices for the prefix menu considering I could of ordered that and my meal separately and not only would it have been cheaper, but I would of had both appetizers just to myself. And they add a 22% tip which I feel is way too generous considering the service. Typically I leave 20% for good service but in this case I would of just left 18%.So i spent $68 with tip for a piece of two appetizers and a meal I didn't eat, and spent 3.5 hours of my life there because the service was so slow. My best friend and I totally regretted going by the end of it all.",8,1,

The specialty drinks are delicious. Love the Latin theme, from the music, to the food. Nothing I can really complain about here. The vibe and atmosphere is very intimate with a dim setting for dinner. The churrasco is delicious and I'd eat it over and over. The sangria is also something I enjoyed very much. I've taken friends here for birthdays and totally had a great experience every time. The dress code is very strict and the parking around here is not great, but they do have valet parking for $7 per car. You'll definitely enjoy it if you make some time to come out here for any occasion !",1,,1

This was close enough, 4.75 stars (yes I'm petty).Celebrated a birthday here with a party of 6. Live music was playing, very much like cafe Havana, expansive bar area on the left side of the restaurant, and breathtaking views of tge city from an all glass dinner area on the right, with intimate dim lighting. Started out at the bar while waiting for our table to be ready (we made reservations, and yes I recommend you do too). For a Wednesday cold night at 9pm, this restaurant was packkkkkedd from the door to the bar.We were seated 15 minutes after our reservation time, remarkably by the window. Every dish ordered was exceptional: apps-arepas were crack, mac n cheese with pork was lip smackingly good, and the chicharron de pollo skewers were succulent!Entree, most of us ordered the churrasco: apparently the best choice as the steak was perfectly flavored, juicy, and boasted generous portions with the rice and beans on the side.Cocktail-fiery Dragonberry mojito?? was well crafted: flavorful and strong, came out with flame on top. Worth the money.People watching index here is high. Tight dresses, latina models, all celebrating their birthdays. Brothas don't bring your girlfriends here if you have wandering eyes lol.The only thing that would give this spot 5 stars would be the friendliness of the servers. Otherwise, fast wait staff and moderately attentive staff. $$ is accurate, the quality of the food to me should make this $$$. Highly recommend dining here!",2,,1
36,Jessica C.,"FRESH MEADOWS, NY",13,75,39,3.0,6/5/2018,"This restaurant is on a prime spot overlooking the city. However they weren't doing outdoor seating when I went. I checked in and got the rose Sangria (which was really delicious). My friend and I opted to just get a bunch of small plates and share them for dinner. We got the mussels, arepas, poke tacos, lobster rolls, Mac and cheese and the avocado salad. All in all the best thing we ordered was the arepas! It was a small size, crispy and with the perfect amount of meat on top. The poke tacos and mac and cheese were our least favorite. Both were very salty. The poke tasted like it was marinated in overly salted soy sauce. The Mac and cheese, I'm not sure if it was a mixture of the cheese they used or if the pork was already seasoned with salt before adding the cheese. We both took one bite and did not continue. We ordered the avocado salad last to help settle all the salty food ingested. The salad was good, nothing spectacular about it. Overall the place and service was good, the food is on the saltier side. I'll come back to try their brunch menu and for drinks.",3,,3

I came pretty early, so ambience was still being low volume music, kind of empty, and fresh helpful faces. Definitely a difference from the night crowds, and the more festive ambience...so I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoyed the low key vibes for lunch! In terms of food as usual pretty consistent flavors. We had the pulled pork arepas...and the arepas complimented the pork, which in my opinion wouldn't be as tasty on its own so great combination. We also had the guacamole and chips. Fresh, simple and chunky guacamole. We had the huevos rancheros which were cheesy, merry and goey deliciousness. For drinks, the sangrita were a hit! Especially at happy hour prices! Two had you ready to take on the day! For dessert we opted for the coconut flan. I don't know who's idea it was to toast those coconut flakes...but we had to order a second flan because one was just not enough for such a delicious little treat. All in all, good service, accommodating staff, and food is pretty consistent. Prices are fair, as portions are not lacking. My go to quick ""fancy"" fix!",,,1
38,Katherine R.,"East Elmhurst, Queens, NY",105,12,11,5.0,7/3/2018,"Love the ambiance and the food is so delicious! The Chorizo Mac and Cheese is the perfect blend of salty, creamy, & cheesy. It's a a descent portion to share with 2-3 people. For dinner I kept it light and ordered the crusted salmon with cilantro mashed potatoes. YES.....cilantro mashed potatoes, who doesn't love cilantro? It's delicious and very filling! It's usually busy on the weekends, but if you make a reservation ahead of time, the smoother your night will go! Brunch is awesome too, if you're a brunch kinda person.

With that said, the staff was very accommodating.  The valet driver told me it was a long wait and held the car while I went in and checked the wait.  At no point did I feel rushed, and there was no line at the valet.  Valet was $7.  They have security at the door (which I  appreciate), who was very polite and right away got us seats for the kids.  The place is very nice, modern, on the water, mostly indoor seating and some outdoor with views of NYC.  The bathrooms are individual with a common sink area.  The attendant was very nice and kept the line moving.  The food is Cuban fusion, and amazing!!  The only negative is that the portions were kinda small.  The waitress was great, very friendly and attentive.

We got really annoyed because the waiter took forever to check back with us. We finished eating and it felt like we had to hunt her down. In fact a different waiter had to come and give us the dessert menu. We ordered the coconut flan. So yummy. Some might think its a little too sweet. The service could have been much better though.

Why did I remove the stars?:my fathers order didn't come in until after the majority of us was done with our food. When his food did arrive, the manager came by to ask him how his food was but was disappointed when his excuse was my fathers plate was a ""special dish"" although my mother order the same one and still managed to get hers on time - one thing that I dislike with a passion is when no accountability is taken and instead points a finger and say ""well you did order something off the menu"" it was distasteful and embarrassing... I was trying to impress my mom with this lovely place I used to talk highly of to get this... after we were done eating my mother made me promise to never take her here again!ughh you can't win.

47,Jessica P.,"Long Island, NY",182,124,232,2.0,5/11/2018,"My husband and I chose this restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary. He made reservations way in advance (approx. a month) and requested to be seated by the window. We arrived on time for our 7 PM reservation on a Monday night and were sat in the middle of the restaurant. I noticed there were 6 or 7 tables by the window that were empty so I expressed to the hostess that we had requested to sit by the window and asked if we could be moved. She went to ask her manager and said unfortunately those tables were taken ""because those people made reservations in advance"". I explained we also had reservations and she said ""Sorry I'm just telling you what my manager told me. If you'd like to wait for a table by the window it will be 40 minutes."" We were hungry so we stayed at our table but it was upsetting. I don't know what kind of system they use, but it didn't seem fair that there were so many empty tables by the window but we couldn't have one. When we left around 9 PM, there were still tables by the window that weren't occupied. For our appetizer we got the crispy arepas and those were absolutely delicious. I'd highly recommend them. For our entrees I got the Pollo a la plancha and my husband got the Churrasco. I didn't like the chicken at all, and the rice and beans were so bland. I've had much better spanish food for 1/3 of the price. My husband did enjoy his Churrasco, but tasted my chicken and agreed that it wasn't good. We were given a complimentary flan for dessert since we were celebrating our anniversary, which we appreciated. The bill was very high, but that was to be expected.

If you are looking for a romantic and quiet dinner by the waterside then this is not it. I think only certain seats have a nice view but ours didn't. The waitress was MIA for most of the time and she seemed rushed and a bit overwhelmed. The margaritas were okay-low on liquor content, nothing mind blowing. Now the arepas appetizer was good excellent. However, my main dish Lomo Saltado was disappointing. The beef was tough and had an unpleasant smell. The only nice thing was the sparkler than came with the cake if it was your birthday.

57,Maggie Z.,"Middle Village, NY",848,301,730,5.0,4/19/2018,"My experience at Blend on the Water was absolutely superb. I came here to celebrate my anniversary with my boyfriend on a Thursday night around 7pm and the place was largely empty, though we still could not find parking in the area and so we ended up paying $7 for the valet parking which is honestly cheap in my opinion, to lessen yourself the hassle of walking the distance to and from the restaurant and the anger of constantly HOPING there will be a spot that soon opens up. The hostesses were sweet and seated us right away at an intimate table by the window where we enjoyed the stunning view of the Manhattan skyline. The décor in here is also absolutely amazing, it's spacious and I felt truly in awe walking in. Happy hours are on Monday-Thursday nights so we fortunately just made it, unfortunately for me, the drinks were WAY stronger than anything I could've anticipated. Half of the frozen margarita had me laughing all night into the next week (okay, just kidding--but there were DEFINTIELY not skimping at all on the liquor that night). For appetizers, we had the cilantro mashed potatoes, the chorizo mac and cheese, crispy arepas, lobster & crab tequenos, mussels, and the skirt steak as our entrée to share. First, we ordered way too much food! The appetizers were enough of a meal for the two of us to share and the skirt steak was just very overwhelming on top of everything else. But.. all the food was truly EXECELENT. The cilantro mashed potatoes were unique and creamy, the chorizo mac and cheese should truly be an entrée of its' own.. as it is extremely heavy, but they did get it right! The crispy arepas were probably the favorites of the night. The lobster & crab tequenos came with a delicious dipping sauce but would probably skip it next time since it underperformed against the other options. Mussels were mildly spicy and extremely small, though they did taste fresh, probably would not get this next time as well since it resembled too much of a meatball taste in my mind. The skirt steak was probably my least favorite, even less than the tequenos, and I would prefer to stick to the appetizers next time. There was nothing amazing about the steak and we asked for it to be cooked medium rare but I felt it came out more like a medium, borderlining medium well. Our waiter was quite attentive, he came to us often to check how we were doing, to refill our water and to take away plates that had been finished. The bathroom was also quite clean and had someone working there to hand you paper towels and such. The service was good. Overall, I definitely recommend coming here for a special occasion or even for tapas/happy hour. The drinks here are a little too intense for my liking but is definitely a bang for your buck. After dinner, there is a beautiful waterfront view of the Manhattan highline just in the backyard of this restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is attentive!",3,,2
58,Lily L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",362,40,42,4.0,6/26/2018,"Came here for a birthday brunch Saturday at 1:30pm and it was quiet packed. Definitely make reservations ahead of time. Delicious food with a view. Blend is located alongside LIC pier and although it's not the best view of the pier, there's still something to look at. Although parking is hard to find around the area, the restaurant provides valet parking for $7. Upon entering, 4/5 guests were present, but we had to wait for the entire party to be seated. I mean, makes sense for a restaurant that's so busy. We got the churrasco with eggs, seafood paella, and guac. The churrasco was delicious; meat was cooked to order and was paired so well with their savory chimichurri. However, the eggs were kind of nasty. We ordered 3 plates of churrasco with eggs and all 3 plates of eggs were undercooked and tasted cold. My boyfriend liked the seafood paella a lot; loaded with tons of real crabmeat and other yummy seafood. The seafood paella is definitely shareable amongst two, he was barely able to finish half on his own and had to take it to go (no complaints there, so worth the price). The guacamole was mediocre, nothing special, probably would've tasted better with a drizzle of lime. Our server was kind. We brought cake and decided last minute we didn't want to eat it there and she still lit up a sparkler candle for us to take pictures and repacked our cake. If you're in the mood for some Spanish food, definitely make sure to check the place out! I'd say it's worth the travel, but remember to make reservations!",,,

So here we are, mid summer and we secured a 730 res, perfect for our schedule on a beautiful Saturday night. Naturally, I wanted to sit outside and within 2 minutes of being outside I said"" we need to go in. Now."" Little bugs. Everywhere. On my purse. In my water. And more than likely all over me. Yuck. There's a lot right there with some greenery so that is most likely the culprit. Sad face.

A shredded chicken thingy I forget the name, good but forgettable, obviously My dinner date didn't say much about his chicken dish and I took about 2 bites of my salmon that he ate the next day and stated ""bland"". Pineapple cake, either dulce de leche or tres leche, very sweet but nice to shareI would go again for the great views and location. Hopefully they aren't existing on that alone.

We were recommended the rose sangria and it was amazing. Got the chicken avocado and rice so good. Recommend to make reservations if you want to sit at table. Bar is first come first served which we did and was quick and great service. Definitely coming back for the happy hour though.,,,
62,Eleni F.,"Queens, Queens, NY",1,6,4,1.0,7/29/2018,"If I could give this place a 0 star rating I definitely would for the worst service. Came here before 5pm and was told to sit either at the bar or wait until ""seating began."" I've decided to go get a drink at the bar and couldn't get service until I had to flag down someone because the employees behind the bar were too busy flirting and kanoodling with eachother instead of paying attention to customers. It took me a good 20 minutes to get noticed. I then got my drink, the employees behind the bar went back to their flirting business. I had to ask for my check and even take it the ""busy"" employee to yet get noticed for my tab. Ongoing until it reached past 5pm, I went back to the hostesses and asked for a table as promised. I was ignored, either given an excuse, and even noticed other customers were getting seated but not me. I asked the 3 hostesses again for a table (the place wasn't even full), and was ignored. My last attempt, I then tried to ask a waitress holding menus if it's possible to get a table. The waitress eagerly answered back with an attitude ""you gotta go to the hostess"" and feverishly walked away. I was fed up at that point. Extremely disappointed.",4,,

Everything I had to eat and drink was delicious, the staff was super accommodating, and the view of the water and Manhattan was BEAUTIFUL. Here are the specifics. To eat, I had the chorizo mac and cheese and the lobster pastries (can't remember the name right now). The mac and cheese was tasty and had a lot of chorizo. If you're not that hungry it might be a good meal. The lobster pastry was also good but def just an appetizer The drinks, however, were the stars of the show. The happy hour caipirinhas  were amazing. I had two passion Fruit caipirinha that we're delicious, fresh and full of flavor. I also had a strawberry daiquiri that had a popsicle in it. You heard right- a popsicle. It was so delicious and cool looking! I loved this place and am really looking forward to going back.",2,,

65,Robin K.,"Queens, NY",342,394,499,5.0,8/4/2018,"I LOVE Blend on the Water!! The only possible gripe I could come up with is that it's too fabulous and popular that you may have to wait. I'm never even mad about the wait; the wait is always worth it. You can, of course, come and sit at the bar for some fun, fancy drinks with popsicles or sugar cane, and that won't require a wait. The food is so fantastic. I love the salads the most and all the drinks can keep coming. The bathrooms are dark and classy and everyone can share the same sinks. Open style, but your own door. So let's talk about the view. THE VIEW. If you have any out-of-towners, this is a must. It is so beautiful inside, so amazing outside (both day and night), and such a great vibe. Always have a great time at Blend.",2,,

(First star of the night, for immediately accommodating guests with reservations). The table also had the prefix menu, which said happy birthday with my friend's name on the cover! It was a very welcoming and sweet!I don't remember the name of our waitress but she was incredible! She was able to switch the chicken skewers for the mushroom flatbread last minute - and checked on us frequently! The name of the restaurant caters to it's one floor interior with a gorgeous view of Manhattan! (The view of the bar was pretty magical as well!) My Arroz con Mariscos was delicious! The rice however was a little dry, however, my love for hot sauce saved the dish! About 3 spoonfuls of hot sauce added a great amount of zest and flavor to the rice!! The appetizers were my favorite part of the dining experience! I'm glad our waitress recommended the mushroom flatbread when we told her most of the guests didn't eat meat! The desserts were delicious as well, and the sparkler for the birthday girl was a nice touch! The only downfall was that it was too dark to the point where flash photography was needed, which can be annoying to the surrounding guests. Overall, this is a great place for an intimate dining experience for every occasion!",3,,

68,Sashamaria B.,"Queens, Queens, NY",18,66,158,5.0,5/4/2018,"The services here is very outstanding. Making reservations for large party is pretty easy. You fill out the online form on the website and less than 24 hours someone from the restaurant emails and confirms your reservation they are very helpful with accommodating all your dine in needs. It's very difficult finding the parking so walk with cash to do valet which is fast and convenient. Can't beat 7.00$ valet parking. The ambience of the restraint is chic. You have a nice city view. The only complaint i have is not enough lights in the night. But it's perfect for birthdays , brunch , date nights and happy hour. The guacamole and chips were freshly made and flavorful. The drink menu have lots of unique variations to choose from. I decided to go with the Tamarind Island ( tamarind purée , Hennessy Vs , simple syrup , lime juice ). It's like more on sweet and sour side but the hint of henny not to strong just perfect. My entree i revamp the original Churrasco meal which consists of Grilled Marinated Skirt Steak Cooked Medium well , White Rice, House Beans, Tostones, Chimichurri, Red Onion Escabeche. I substitute my rice for yellow rice and added asparagus since I'm not a fan of beans. I must say the steak was not dry , chewy or over cooked. It was cooked to perfection veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy flavorful. Not to mention the steak is a good piece. It's a nice gem on Long Island city. Will be visiting again to try the rest of items on menu. Thanks blend for helping me celebrate my birthday.",1,,

Their chicken fried rice and appetizers were excellent but the main course was just ok. The place is also extremely loud.

73,Monique M.,"Queens, NY",198,218,837,5.0,3/4/2018,"If you love views of the NYC skyline, 'Blend' is the place for you! After attending my very first Yelp Elite event at Blend Astoria, I knew that Blend was exactly where I wanted to celebrate my birthday this year. I contacted management to set up a pre-fixe dinner with about 10 friends/family. For $60 (not including tax/tip or drinks), our party received a family style meal including a variety of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Completing the reservation was very easy and one of the managers followed up with me every step of the way. I was able to customize our dinner meal using a number of options provided on the reservation form. Ultimately, the night of my reservation (a Friday night), I was running late. When I arrived to meet my party, the place was packed, barely any standing room. The staff however, were very kind and forgave my lateness. Within about 20 minutes we were seated at a table with a good view of the NYC skyline and backed by vibrant sounds of salsa music. I was extremely happy with everything. By mistake, we were provided with menus upon seating. The menus were LIT...literally. There is a light within the menu for easier reading. Same was provided in the check book...so darn cool! Our server eventually realized the mistake and rectified the issue. Our family style menu included the following: Appetizers - Crispy Arepas, chicharron de pollo skewersEntrees - Pollo a la plancha, churrasco, pernil, and lime crusted salmonSides - Yellow rice and beans, maduros (sweet plantains), and mashed potatoes,Desserts were an assortment of treats including caramel flan, chocolate fudge brownie, and ice cream. Our server also placed a sparkler on the plate for a birthday treat (1000pts!)The food was delicious, fresh, and seasoned well. Among our favorites were the churrasco and salmon. The least of our favorites was the pollo a la plancha. Portion sizes were perfect for such a dinner. About half of my group had never been to Blend, and they were highly impressed with the food. Staff were kind, courteous, personable, and willing to take a million pictures for us lol. Service was impeccable as well. Just a tip - if you are not willing to pay valet, then be prepared to search high and low for parking. I took an uber and had no issues. My family member ended up parking 3 long blocks away. Overall, it was truly a memorable night. Thank you to Blend for making my birthday so special! I highly recommend them to anyone.",10,1,8

Updated review",Its a tradition to celebrate a special occasion here at blend. My boyfriend and I came to celebrate our 6 year anniversary with my one year old daughter! We definitely reserved a month ahead! Every time we go we seem to fall in love over and over again. They staff is definitely baby friendly & they accommodate us with the high chair and all. The food and drinks are delicious! I didn't have enough room for dessert but I kept going because thats how delicious their food is. My server for the night was Alexandra she made my dinner super welcoming and special ! I cannot thank her enough for the amazing hospitality!!! Michele is also the best server at blend! I'm glad she's been around for a while!!!! I def will be back because I love their passion fruit frozen margaritas !!,1,,1
75,Jaclyn V.,"Wallkill, NY",12,84,179,3.0,4/25/2018,"Writing this review was a little difficult for me.  I came here for brunch on a Saturday at 2pm (reservations needed) with my husband and in-laws for my mother-in-law's birthday. The place itself is really nice.  The decor and river setting is beautiful.  The day was gorgeous and sunny! Finally nice spring weather! We were seated promptly and were very pleased with all the food and drink options.  We made some choices and then ordered some drinks. This is where things started to go downhill.  I always check in on Yelp whereever I go and look to see if the venue offers anything for Yelpers.  Blend had an offer of ""a free sangria with dinner Monday-Thursday, or a free sangria with blunch everyday"". I checked in and showed my server the check-in offer.  She glanced at it and said that it was only for dinner M-Th.  I ordered a different beverage- the Blend Sunset Martini, which was really good and sweet. After placing our blunch order, I looked over the offer again and it clearly stated that the offer was for ""blunch everyday"".  I showed the offer to the server again an pointed out that it said ""everyday for blunch"". She said she would ask the manager.  After waiting for 20 minutes, our server came back and said that they do not do that offer anymore, but being that I keep bringing it up, they would honor it.  The remark was said in a demeaning tone.  I did get my sangria, which I watched sit at the bar for another 20 minutes and get watery as the ice melted before it was brought over to my table. Even watery, it was a decent sangria. Finally after sitting for about 40 minutes and dealing with the drink debacle, we ordered our food.  I would give the food here 5 stars if I was rating it only. The food was incredible.  I really enjoyed everything I tried. I had the taquitos de carne, which had so much flavor.  The steak pieces were cooked perfectly and had great toppings of guac, pickled onions, cotija cheese, and crunchy onions.  It came with a side of delicious rice and beans. My husband had the arepas benedictos, which were also amazing.  The arepa was slightly sweet and crisp, topped with soft and well seasoned short ribs and a perfect Hollandaise sauce. Yumm! My in-laws enjoyed their entrees as well- the arroz y mariscos and huevos rancheros.  After completing our meal and having our table cleared, we waited at least another 30 minutes before our server came over to see if we wanted dessert. We ordered the flan and warm chocolate cake.  Both were really good.  But another thing that peeved me was that we notified the server that it was my mother in-law's birthday, and they did not put any candles or sparklers- which seemed to be the thing they do, as three other tables with birthdays received sparklers- on either dessert.  Our entire experience took over three hours- which was a looong time!  In short-Service: 2Decor: 4Food: 5Beverages: 4Timing: 2",1,,
76,Richelle J.,"West Bronx, NY",155,16,10,4.0,10/22/2018,The sangrita was good and strong. I got the flank steak as the entree I did have to add salt and pepper to it but it was still good. My mom got the paella and was disappointed. My aunt got the pernil and loved it. The crispy arepas and the shrimp appetizers were really good. Wish they had more options  for entrees though,,,
77,Joyee T.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,1,1.0,9/15/2018,"This one star is for the water guy because he was the only one that provided decent service. Upon arrival, we were told an hour wait which we agreed to. I checked in around 50 min into our wait and was told 10 more minutes. After 10 min, we walked back to the front and was told another 15. The attitude and lack of customer service from the front desk was a first flag. Our server greeted us and took our order, food runner delivered our food, water refilled by the water guy (every time we ran out of water so A+ water guy). We only saw our server maybe once or twice but never when we needed her. Could not even order a drink. Food was sub par. Tasted like it was just reheated and not worth what we were paying. Overall experience was just terrible. Service bad (except water guy!), food was bad, and atmosphere was bad. Don't come here. Thank you Blend for ruining my birthday!",,,

I was surprised by the amount of cheese in the mofongo though, I could've done without it. While we sat inside, the outside seating is on the water and looks like the perfect outdoors dining location!  The tables inside are a little close together; if it were anymore packed, it would've been difficult to hear our table conversation.",,,

Rightfully so, they serve up some satisfying, tasty dishes and drinks to go along with that view of Manhattan on the water.Here are some notes from my recent Blunch:The Blend Sunset Martini looks beautiful and packs a nice punch (Did I just describe a drink or an Ex? hmm)Arepas Benedictos are the way to go with crispy arepas, braised short ribs, poached eggs, hollandaise and an avocado pico salad. It was the only meal I needed all day! Huge and delicious. GET THIS!If you are more in the lunch mood the Steak Sandwich was tremendous - skirt steak, caramelized onions, cheddar on garlic bread. Another super filling meal that tastes great.I would avoid the chicken dishes or at least the ones that use chicken breast. A person at the table next to me order it and couldn't even eat it because it was so overcooked. Blend comped her meal.It wasn't too crowded making me think that Blend is more of night time place especially on the weekends. The dress code, despite being prominent on the website, wasn't really enforced - saw a mix of overly casual w/ sneakers to very dressy. Not sure if it is stricter at night.

Their frozen sangria is the perfect blend of sweet and sour and perfect for those like me debating between the frozen margarita and the frozen sangria. You don't have to choose! You can have all in one drink. $8 at HH 5-7. $10 at non-happy hour times. Bartender was cool and  indicated you have to get your order in several minutes before 7pm cause the computers automatically switch to non HH prices at 7.Food: Entrées will run you $18-$30.  A lot of birthday celebrations and desserts being lit up with sparklers! I had the Blend Stuffed Burger which was super tasty and had a lot going on. Others at my table had the Filet Mignon and the Pescado Encocado (Tilapia) and there were no complaints.Ambiance: Happy crowd mostly. Super loud inside, bar area is crowded during happy hour, but beware of those people in seats hogging an empty seat for a friend that never shows. I didn't even want to sit down, just wanted to order a drink at the bar and got the death stare. Outside is nice, great views of the city and tiki torches scattered about to keep you warm on cooler nights. There were a couple of tiny creepy crawlees at our table, but moved to another one and had no problems. It is dark outside at night even with the torches, however, Blend has you covered with their light up menus.Service: The hosts/hostesses give you a warm greeting on the way in, if you don't have a reservation, you have to wait until your entire party is there to put your names in. (Tell your late friends a time that's an hour sooner so they will be on time). They were cool though with seating the 3 out of 4 of us when we told then the last person would be awhile.

Apparently, this is THE spot for birthdays and a few dozen other people were also celebrating theirs because there was an endless stream of sparklers throughout the night that I almost felt blind. The food here was phenomenal. I'm sure it doesn't beat the authentic Latin American cuisine in the enclaves of upper Manhattan, parts of Queens, and in the Bronx, but it's definitely a nice swanky spot for good food if you want to celebrate your birthday in style. We had the Pernil,  Chorizo Mac & Cheese, and the Blend Stuffed Burger.The Pernil (Oven Roasted Pork Shank, White Rice, Bean Sauce, Chimichurri) was probably my favorite dish of the night. The pork was very tasty, as with the bean sauce. A bit small-portioned but you will feel fulfilled in general after cleaning this dish out.I also loved the Chorizo Mac & Cheese (Manchego, Cojita, Pepper Jack Cheese, Chorizo, Panko Crust)--mac & cheese inspired by savory and spicy Latin flavors that were on point. The panko crust was crispy and the chorizo really brought out its flavors.I don't really recall much of the burger, but it was small--like make-your-hand-a-C-shape small. Average, at best.Although I love bare-bones food joints, the food was excellent (though small-portioned, which was expected). We did all of the plates family style, but they didn't turn out to be too shareable. The place is huge--kind of like you're walking into a 4-star restaurant in Vegas--decked out with a huge bar, plenty of sofa couch tables, and a panoramic view of the waterfront. A cool thing they have is LED menus. You read that right--MENUS THAT LIGHT UP. A total first for me, but it goes to show you how ""extra"" this place is. Although pricey, it really is a lovely place to spend happy hours during the summer time.",1,,1

One thing of note- the couple in front of us in line was not permitted in as the gentleman had a tee shirt and athletic pants on. Inside I noticed people were really dressed up and lots of tables seemed to be celebrating special occasions.I got a free sangria with a check in on yelp! When I got the bill they forgot to deduct the $10 off for that but the waitress corrected it right away when we pointed it out.Food was okay, not spectacular. I had a shrimp dish and side of chicken fried rice. The portions were kind of small for the price ($13 and $9, respectively). My fiancé had the churrasco steak, a much larger portion, which was pretty good.Drinks were good overall, and the warm chocolate cake for dessert was great.Note that this place is dark inside. Almost too dark. The menus are all backlit so I guess the dark ambiance is on purpose? But it could've been a tad lighter. It's nicely decorated and had a large bar as well.",2,,

The service and kindness of everyone is reason enough to come back. It doesn't hurt that the food was fresh and A1. Tip: dont be afraid to sit at the bar table. I was hesitant thinking we would not get good service but I was wrong. And they had a MMA fight on the flatscreen. Win!,1,,1

Updated review","I've been here too many times to count over the past 2 years and the service provided this time around was atrocious. I missed a reservation for 6 people, by a FEW minutes due to unforeseen traffic. I called and informed we would be late. My mom and my sister walked in explaining the situation just to be ignored and be given attitude by a short girl with long dark hair. It's unwelcoming people like these that compromise businesses. Long story short, we ended up having to wait MORE THAN 2 HOURS after we were told the wait time is ONLY 1 HR 45 MINS after we missed the reservation. Every time we checked in at the counter with your hostesses, they counted down the time (you've been here 51 mins, 1 hr, 30 mins, etc) as if they have some sort of hierarchy. What happened when you have me waiting for more than 2 hours? I could've been to another venue, and home. I stuck around because it was an important occasion and I set my mind for ONLY a 2 hour wait time. Word of advice.... it's better to over estimate for a customer than under estimate. It was complete bullshit what was going on. So many people leaving and entering. How hard was it to put 3 tables of 2 together? You had me waiting for parties of 12 and 16. I ended up speaking to a supervisor and he said he would get back to me on the situation, he never did. He was too busy cleaning tables although he was aware of the commotion going on in his restaurant. I was told I would see him throughout dining, and the funny part is... I never did. Is this how you guys run business when you have unhappy customers? You seem like you want to be unbothered and don't want to settle problems that can be avoided. This is what managers at most places of businesses do. The ball was in your court to make this situation better. The least you could've done was check on me and discount my bill or even offer me a drink for making me wait longer than you told me I was going to. You lost a very loyal customer, and I'll be recommending new places rather than this one while you work on your hospitality skills. Shout out to you Amanda, after all the frustration was let out, at least we came to terms that this was a really ridiculous situation and I appreciate you taking in all the constructive criticism. Overall - atmosphere, food, drinks and waitress.... you guys were top notch and still have a 5 in my books :)",2,,
101,Ashley M.,"Queens, NY",17,101,51,5.0,7/7/2018,"I've been here plenty of times. A bit over priced but always worth it. I've had many things on the menu, all are good!

103,Mikayla R.,"MASPETH, NY",92,49,76,3.0,7/20/2018,"This restaurant is known more for its view than for its food.  The food is almost bland tasting, with little seasoning or extra flavor.  The prices are decent, but the food is not worth the price you pay.  However, the outside seating the restaurant has faces Gantry Plaza State Park and the piers of LIC.  It is within a two minute walking distance to the water, which is beautiful for pictures or just simply for gazing at on evenings where the weather is nice.      Another good thing about this restaurant is that the food comes out rapidly for smaller parties of people.  The waitstaff enters your preferences on an iPad, and your order is thus sent directly to the kitchen.  Kitchen servers bring the food out to you as soon as it is prepared.  This is one of the fastest ordering to food coming out turnovers that I have experienced at a restaurant thus far.    Around 8 o'clock, the dining experience transitions from casual to clubby.  The music changes, and the lights dim considerably.",,,

Updated review",Been here various times. The last two times (one of them being dinner the other blunch) I wasn't too satisfied. As the years have gone by the quality/ service/ and food has decreased drastically. The food has been bland and cold. The waitress took forever to come and GREET us! And we were there for my moms birthday - so complete disappointment. I'm willing to give it one more chance before I cross this restaurant off my to go list,,,
106,Brittany W.,"ROSEDALE, NY",2,23,29,4.0,7/4/2018,Great place for Sunday brunch or date night . Be sure to make reservations for Sunday brunch as this place gets really busy . The staff is very friendly and attentive the food if good not really great it's great representation of Spanish style cuisine but not as flavorful. I had a strawberry and mango salad with steak . There were candied walnuts and avocado. I don't really recall a dressing not that there is any needed juices from the mango and strawberry and sweetness of the walnuts seem it unnecessary for dressing. The street corn seemed to be boiled then grilled so not as authentic as the traditional corn. The corn was tasty but didn't have the zesty kick from the cayenne pepper nor the pizazz from the lime it usually carries  . Check don't forget to check in on yelp for a free frosted sangria that is really made to perfection.,1,,

Updated review","I brought my fiancée here for our anniversary because she'd heard about this place from several different people. Don't take any bag other than a purse or the door bouncer will yell at you...there's no coat check and apparently he doesn't know that things can fit under tables. That was my first impression of this place before I even got in the door. The website also has a dress code of 'formal' that is not enforced at all. It must be for 'blunch' only. All that being said, our waitress was incredible. She was very attentive and personable and made up for the initial interaction. I stated in the reservation that it was our anniversary and they gave us dessert on the house, which was a nice touch. The food was really good and they had some really inventive and creative dishes, including tres golpes deviled eggs, which my table ordered. I had the churrasco with chimichurri sauce and my fiancée ordered the pernil. Both were delicious...exactly what you want that food to taste like. We came to this restaurant because we assumed there would be something especially cool about the decor or at least the view. Unfortunately, the inside is fairly plain and the view of the East River and Manhattan was mostly obstructed. Nearby, however, there is a nice place to lounge, walk around, and take pictures. Overall, it's worth a visit, and I might go back for 'blunch' if someone I know is having a party. But just for a dinner out, Sofrito in Riverbank State Park in Hamilton Heights has similar food with a much better view!",1,1,

111,Wendy P.,"Plainfield, NJ",0,13,8,5.0,8/17/2018,We had the Paella and churrasco with the frozen sangria and the frozen sangria and margarita mix and we loved everything. We had the flan and it was ok. The only thing is that my husband and I are gluten free and the menu doesn't specify what is GF or can be done GF and is a hassle for us and the waiter to go to the kitchen and ask the chef every time  it would be so much easier for us and the staff if they would specify in the menu. Hope they make the change,,,

113,Sneha J.,"Champaign, IL",364,24,13,4.0,8/4/2018,"My boyfriend brought me here for dinner. Our reservation was for 8:15, and we made it to the restaurant just a few minutes before. We were told to wait (even though we already had a reservation) for about 15-20 minutes. When seated, we had to wait awhile for our server to take our order. We actually didn't know who our main server was since there were a lot of servers running around, so the service was a bit frustrating to us. However, the food and drinks were amazing. Everything was so flavorful and filling. The ambience was also very nice. I fell in love with the atmosphere. Great spot for a celebratory dinner date. I just wish the service was more efficient and organized!",,,
114,Kristina V.,"New York, NY",61,162,33,1.0,12/3/2017,"Ok, I will make this short and sweet. The place smells like 4th of July. Apparently everyone has their birthday parties there and they light big sparklers on top of the cakes they bring out. It feels like they should only be for outdoors. We are breathing in fumes and it smells awful. Something isn't right about it. The drinks are the best thing going. Get the flavored caipirinhas or the coquito. So they had to move our table so the manager(?) came over and offered us a round of coquito and a round of desserts. We obliged. The food was crap so I will not even review.When it is time to have dessert, the waitress was like, I have your desserts ready. We told her we didn't choose yet. She then told us that she chose for us. She decided that we would have one of each of their signature desserts. However, that is not what we wanted. We all wanted the flan but she didn't give a crap. At that restaurant, apparently the server is always right. She brought out her, oops, I mean, OUR, dessert plate. - microwaved hard chocolate lava cake- wet pineapple upside down cake being sold as tres leches- and of course the 1 tiny flan.The only thing we liked.Here is the best part - there is a FREAKIN bathroom attendant in the restroom handing out paper towels to dry your hands for tips.

Updated review","I had made a reservation at Blend on the Water on spec months before our anniversary because it is so difficult to get a reservation there.  Granted, there are restaurants that are more romantic and decadent, but this is a great place for a celebration and Blend on Vernon is one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants.  He had never been to this location before, so I figured this would be a treat.  What other restaurant, especially in LIC, has a 45 minute wait for tables at 9pm on a Sunday night in December?!  Again, I am so glad we had that reservation.  One of my colleagues who lives in the neighborhood is baffled by the fact that we make the trip to LIC for Blend (to be fair, we have friends and colleagues to visit also, and the skyline view at Gantry Plaza State Park is magnificent), but the arepitas alone are worth the trek.  Neither of us are big drinkers but a toast over rose sangria was deliciously appropriate.  I had my favorite entree, pollo a la plancha with salad instead of rice and beans, and he ordered pernil.   It seemed that every table was a birthday or anniversary party of some sort and we were all brought complimentary plates of chocolate lava cake and ice cream with a sparkler in it.  It was a perfect evening over all and a great way to celebrate what we hope is the first of many years together.",2,,1

The waitress was very friendly and was sure to check in on drink refills and when to bring out the desserts to celebrate the occasion. The food was delicious. I had the Pollo a la Plancha (chicken breast with rice and Maduros) and we ordered guacamole for the table. The white sangria was perfect and had us giggling while the Bulldogs were served in a huge glass. The trio of desserts offered was perfect for the 4 of us.

We are greeted by a bouncer/failed comedian who states my daughter may not be able to get in because her sandals might be deemed as flip-flops. I'm instantly ready to take my business elsewhere.  He suddenly jokes that he was kidding and we go inside. Weird. Inside, I immediately see half a dozen guys in sneakers, one in a tanktop, and a young couple engaged in a clothed hand job in the corner.  The food was solid 3.5.  The portions were on the small end. The flavors played it safe. The service was a 3. Our waitress forgot a few items. This place gave off a vibe like it was trying to play it off as more exclusive than it actually is. People were waiting for tables with many free ones available. The decor is dark.

The space we were in was a smaller room but you get to see the sparkling Manhattan skyline.  Servers circulated smalls bites during cocktail hour. I really enjoyed their savory braised short rib crispy arepas, and tres golpes deviled egg. The deviled egg was creamy cheesy savory and topped with a piece of salami. The drinks were well mixed and very festive. The meal was buffet style, serving mac and cheese, ropa de vieja, pulled pork (this was juicy well seasoned and delicious!), and cilantro mashed potatoes.

They have a formal attire and for the most part you won't see individuals in jeans, but there were definitely guys wearing jeans that night. The location is great and the view is amazing.

We were not at all rushed and the meal went at a relaxed pace.  Most of the table took advantage of the Yelp free sangria check-in offer.  Sangria was a bit on the sweet side, but it was enjoyable.We started the table off with some guacamole, Mexican corn and a variety of plantains.  The guac and chips were good as was the corn (1 ear of corn cut into 3 portions).  For the plantains we had maduras, mangu and tostones each was great, but the mangu was the favorite of the table, it was so savory and flavorful; we all love it.The Blunch menu includes a wide variety of options that had a Latin flare.  The Arepas Benedictos was fabulous!  Sweet corn cakes covered with shredded short ribs, poached eggs and holladaise were served alongside salad and avocado.  It was really delicious.  The skirt steak and eggs were good, however the steak was a bit over cooked and on the verge of being too salty.  Someone ordered the Huevos Rancheros and he wiped his plate clean.  The burger I was told was a really good burger, but also overcooked.For dessert the Pina Colada Tres Leche sounded odd, but it was excellent as was the chocolate cake which was served with some wonderful vanilla ice cream.A lovely place for brunch with a great view of Manhattan.  Parking is not easy in the area and while they do offer valet there is a $7 charge and it takes awhile to get your car.",5,1,1

The views inside the restaurant are amazing. The main dining area has large windows and you are overlooking the NYC skyline. Now let's get to the main point the food was amazing and the drinks were strong. My Churrasco was cooked to my liking and that chorizo mac and cheese was deliciousness. I will be going back for sure!,1,,

The decor and location is amazing. The location is on the boardwalk under the bridge, with breathtaking views of manhattan! The decor is amazing floor to ceiling windows, modern fittings and luxury ambience! The only con is during the weekends it gets cramped. The tables are packed tightly next to each other! All in all, I would recommend this establishment time and time again! One of my favorite places to dine!",,,
142,Megs H.,"New York, NY",12,25,1,1.0,8/5/2018,"If I could leave 0 stars, I would. I don't Yelp often, but I do if I have a really lovely or a really poor experience. Unfortunately, I am writing this review for the later of the two.I have been to Blend on The Water numerous times before today for dinner and brunch without an issue, have taken my bf here to celebrate a new job, and always make it a point to bring out of town friends/family here for the amazing food and views. Today I visited for brunch with friends who are visiting from out of town and we left moments after being seated.My friends spent $45 on a car to get to LIC from the city, and are celebrating a birthday as well as a 23 year anniversary (celebrations were noted on the reservation, btw). Unfortunately today, I/we had the absolute worst experience in my life dealing with an individual in the service/hospitality industry that I have ever encountered, and I am truly not exaggerating.Upon arrival for our 11:30am reservation for a party of 5 (on 8/5/18), we were greeted by the scowling hostess. After checking in, we were told to step into the waiting area and that we would be seated in a few minutes. At this time, the birthday boy mentions her attitude, but I say I didn't notice it. - Totally fine waiting, I get it. I was a hostess for a years while I was in college. Maybe you have to wait for the other hostess to come back and seat us, maybe you're still putting our table together, maybe you need to wipe down a few menus. Whatever, I get it if I'm not sat right away.11:40am rolls around and I ask the other hostess, who was much more pleasant, about the status of our table and she mentions it will be a few more minutes. - Ok, so we'll wait a few more minutes. Although, we shouldn't have been waiting 10 minutes to begin with since we had a reservation, right? That's why you make a reservation *hello Captain Obvious11:45 rolls around and I check in with the the hostess again. This time, the initial hostess who ""greeted"" us. This is when it all went downhill quick and why I will never return to this place and what prompted me to write this review.Me: Hi, do you know how much longer it will be? Our res was for 11:30 and we're all here.Hostess: (with all the attitude) I SAID it would be a few minutes. So if you could just go back over there and wait, we'll text you when your table is ready.M: Ok, but do you maybe know how much longer it might be? We've been waiting 15 minutes, so I don't quite understand what the delay is.H: I SAID a few more minutes. A lot of people have been checking in at once and it is just the two of us. So you can just go wait over there.M: (with a bit -not all- of attitude) I really don't appreciate your attitude. I'm just trying to understand when we will be sat, because we have a reservation and have been waiting for 15 minutes.H: Well, I don't appreciate your attitude! M: (now all the attitude has arrived because, RUDE) Honey, I am an unhappy customer here to spend money in your place if work and have been waiting quite a while to be sat for my reservation. I would understand a wait if I was a walk-in, but we have a reservation. I am allowed to have an attitude. YOU are not allowed to have an attitude toward me. YOU are in the service industry. I've worked in the service and hospitality industry for the last 15 years and I have never spoken to a customer like this nor been spoken to by staff like this before.H: Ok, you need to go wait over there.M: Sure, we'll continue to wait. In the mean time, I strongly suggest you fix your attitude toward customers.H: Yeah, I wont.We wait a few minutes and are finally sat. While we wait, my friends are questioning whether or not we should even eat there, as they don't trust the food now due to the two unpleasant encounters we had.After being seated, I ask the hostess to send over her manager, and the lovely, gracious hostess I just exchanged words with comes over - I know right, what?! - So she comes over:H: I was told you wanted to see me.M: You're the manager?? That's unfortunate. Never mind.Hostess/manager (why? how??) as she walks away, still with all the attitude: You don't have to eat here.M: I've always enjoyed eating here and have always had a great experience until my interactions today with you.*End of the hands down, most unprofessional and unpleasant service interaction I have EVER had in my life*I will never visit any of Blend's three establishments ever again and will advise all my friends who love it, that the service has significantly declined and it would be a waste of their money.We ended up walking down the block to Skinny Cantina and having delicious food and amazing service! Thankfully Skinny Cantina's service was able to allow us to end our brunch on a lovely note, full of laughs and vowing never to return to Blend.Just as the hostess/manager said loudly to us as we left, I will say to the Blend franchise: Byeeeee",5,1,1
143,Aiden S.,"Garden City, NY",35,110,81,5.0,1/5/2018,"Really cool experience coming here for my birthday. Service is great and it's conveniently located next to the water for aesthetic Instagram pictures. Food was by far my favorite part since the portions are relatively reasonable and priced well. The Mac and cheese was a great hit but the crispy chicken was the winner. Well cooked, packed with flavor, and aesthetically plated too. It came with an avocado salad which went really well with the chicken to mix up the texture of the meal. I would definitely come here again. There was also a live band playing Christmas music which was a plus. Be sure to make a reservation.",,,

They had nice salsa playing.. food can't tell what type of Spanish it is.. we started off with mini arepas they were yummy just sooo small totally a teaser. We all got the churrasco it was delicious the rest of the sides it came with we're pretty bland.. wish it came with more options... the alcohol options omg yum the mango mojito amazing.. comes with a sugar cane. And dessert to die for... even the chocolate cake was so good.. overall great place",2,1,2

From the moment we got there, it was amazing... they have valet parking so you don't have to worry about finding parking, we had a reservation so when we got in we said our last names and the hostess was cordial. We got seated outside and our waitress was amazing, very attentive, the food was amazing but the drinks one the drinks were soooo good. It is on the pricy side but worth every penny. When we were done with our dinner, I was surprise with a birthday dessert and it was sooo good as well. I love this place and will be back soon, we live in Albany NY so a bit far for us, about 3 hours lol",,,

Updated review","We had a reservation. The service was horrible, they mistakenly charged my friends credit card twice and instead of an apology, they told her to call the bank at 9pm. They took a second card and after 5 minutes we asked for the card back and were told ""sweetie, you need to wait for the system to reboot."" We used the valet service and get home only to realize the auto starter remote was missing from our keys. After 15 minutes on hold and demanding to speak to a manager, they tell me they will look into it. At this point I'm hungry, annoyed and tired. Manager calls back and they found the key. I ask for them to send some food. I just got a voicemail stating an Uber will leave in less than 30 minutes and their kitchen closed so they can only send guacamole but they will discount my next visit. I guess I'll be up until 1am waiting on a call to go outside and pick up my key. Update: the manager said that we were charged multiple times and would reverse the transaction. It didn't happen and we had to report this as fraud and have the card cancelled.",7,,

Updated review","After coming here a few times, I can say this is still one of my favorite restaurants. This time, we came back to celebrate Father's Day with brunch. Figured it might be ridiculously busy (highly recommend making reservations), we came earlier on Sunday to look for parking and strolled in five minutes to our reservation time. They checked us in and asked us to take a seat as they will seat us closer to reservation time. I noticed they have done this before a few times and now realize that it may be a staffing issue - they probably don't have enough wait staff on the floor and need to have that next shift come in before they can get it going. Same with nighttime - probably too many tables, not enough staff. We see this happen almost every time we come (except the first time where everything was quick and perfect).I indicated that I had a stroller in my reservation and requested a comfortable seat while also having some sort of view. It's nice that they read the comments and honor your request as much as they can. Initially, I thought the table right in front of where all the customers wait to be seated was going to be awkward but it turned out to be quite comfortable with wonderful lighting! Very thankful they were attentive to their customers and the manager was quite friendly and helpful. Thanks for helping us take our first Father's day family photo! It is loud there so make sure you have people/kids with you that are comfortable with that, otherwise it's earphones for them.Blend's dinner menu is great so I had high hopes when we ordered the burger, huevos rancheros and especially the arepas benedictos. Hubby got coffee and I got orange juice which turned out to be freshly squeezed. Pretty good but for $3.50 I was hoping for a bit more juice and much less ice. Arepas benedictos - surprisingly bland compared to their delicious arepas for dinner. The arepas have the short rib meat on top of the arepa. Needs the guacamole mix with crema sauce that comes with it for dinner menu. I think that would have made it better. The most disappointing was the poached egg. It was COMPLETELY cooked through...boiled egg on top of arepas. Funky combo. Well, at least it came with a really good salad (fresh greens, nicely tossed dressing) and fruit. Burger - hubby didn't get to ask for how it was made but it came well done. He likes it medium rare generally but he was surprised because he still enjoyed it despite it being cooked through. Very juicy, moist, flavorful and tender! Huevos rancheros - the shocker of the afternoon. Didn't anticipate how much we would like this dish. It came with sunnyside up eggs, black bean puree, pepper jack cheese, and chicken. The quesadilla itself (chicken and cheese) was good and all the other toppings were loaded on top. Giant portion and great for sharing. So flavorful! I even dipped the arepa in this sauce and it was great. Overall, blunch (as they refer to it), was good. I prefer dinner over blunch but it's still great for special occasions or if you just want to enjoy a spot with large windows and natural sunlight. Surprisingly not that crowded for Father's Day. Service was very nice and friendly (thanks Melissa!) and we were happy they accommodated our stroller without giving us grief as some restaurants can be.",,,
148,Julian M.,"Queens, New York, NY",0,7,0,2.0,8/27/2018,This place is way overhyped and overpriced. Food was nothing to brag about. Cocktails were weak. Service was slow. The waitress also moved us to another table to accommodate a large party right in the middle of dinner. Overall did not have a good experience so will probably not go back anytime soon.,,,1
149,D H.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",104,2,1,1.0,7/13/2018,I wrote the review that I attached as a photo on their Facebook page and it was deleted. The place was beautiful on the walk in.

150,Kristin M.,"Queens, NY",319,28,52,5.0,5/9/2018,"I cannot overemphasize enough what an awesome experience Blend on the Water is. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is incredible (especially at night) and the service is so friendly. I went to Blend on the Water last night for my 25th birthday with 3 friends, and we had such a blast. Tuesday was 2-for-1 mojitos, and I tried the mango and pineapple mojitos. Both of which were delicious. For an appetizer we shared the crispy arepas, which was perfect for 4 people, and very tasty. Many people on Yelp recommended the Pernil for an entree, so I went for that. The pork was tender, and flavorful. I really enjoyed it! Since it was my birthday, they gave us a free lava cake dessert with a sparkler coming out of it. It was so fun, and equally as delicious as the main course. The waitress was also consistently kind and attentive, and offered us free tequila shots with our check. And the view. How could I forget to mention the view? We went at 7pm, and sat by the window where we could see the sun go down on the New York City skyline. You get a view of both the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, which we could easily see from the window. It was gorgeous, and a great Instagram moment.I will definitely back! This restaurant would be equally as great for a date night as it would be for a girl's night. Highly recommend.",1,,1

Attentive as hell. Thank you. The view is beautiful - even though it was cloudy out, it was GORGEOUS.  We ordered the rose sangria, they ran out of red (surprised). It was good, not too overwhelmingly sweet. I ordered the crispy chicken, it was accompanied with the mango avocado salad and fried rice. The fried rice was all right but the chicken was phenomenal. Didn't think I would've liked the salad but I enjoyed it.",1,1,

155,Emily O.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",6,14,6,1.0,5/15/2018,"Today, my family and I (party of 6) came from our graduation celebration.   We were seated in the center of the restaurant, even though the window seats were not occupied and we called in advance to give them notice that we were coming to eat blunch.  When I arrived, ahead of the group, I were told that we would be seated when we were all there.  Witin 10 minutes, we were seated by the hostess.  The ambience was one good thing about the restaurant.  You're essentially seated across the walkway from the park along the water.   The room temperature was cool, but not frigid.   Muted sunlight came into the restaurant.We were not seen by our waitress after more than five minues from when we were seated or immediately after and her pattern of neglect to follow up and visit our table, or individuals amongst the table, continued throughout the meal.  This was not due to understaffing; there appeared to be two waitstaff - our waitress and another waiter/busboy - for a total of 8 couples/groups/tabs in the restaurant that day.   From quick observations behind me, it seemed that our waitress spent a lot of time at the bar, even though there were staff aside from the waitstaff at that area.   After the long wait to see our waitress, the hostess came back to take our drink orders.   Only one of us bought an alcoholic beverage; he enjoyed it.   Our guest of honor got a coffee - she styled it as an Americano (two shots, ice/water) - with milk, and the other patron got a pineapple juice.   The pineapple juice was watery and tasted funny; there was none of the sour component in the juice, just slightly sweet and watery.   The guest of honor who ordered the coffee with milk returned it promptly, saying the milk was off, slightly clumpy and tasting like cream.   I ordered the ""check in on Yelp and get a free Sangria"" for her with the hostess, but neither the hostess nor our waitress brought it.Next we ordered guacamole, and our entrees; three pernil, one chicken vacafrita, the steak tacos, and the seafood and rice.   Therein came our next problem: the waitress informed us that we were not allowed to customize our food.   I thought the other guest wasn't asking too much; she wanted to switch meats on two similarly-priced items.   Specifically, she wanted pernil instead of steak in the sandwich.  (In fact, the pernil is MORE expensive than the steak sandwich).   They couldn't do it for her.   Apparently, the only alterations (pursuant to what's written on the menu) are for allergies; everything else must be ordered exactly to the menu.   This strictness was not appreciated.   Similar discussions ensued about the white versus yellow rice; the chicken vacafrita and pernil dishes are paired with white rice and red beans, but the steak taquitos come with yellow rice with mixed vegetables.   The colors of rice and beans are not at all clear on the menu, which lists simply ""on a bed of Rice,"" ""Rice, Beans,"" ""mexican rice,"" and, for the sides, ""WHITE RICE AND BEANS.""(Errors in grammar from the original menu.)The guacamole arrived first.  The chips were somewhat crisp, but some had a sheen of oil still left on them.  They were served oddly; some three or four chips already in the stone bowl with the guacamole, then another ring of chips around them.  You basically couldn't see the guacamole at first glance.  This was not aesthetically optimal, because it basically buried the ""star"" of the dish.  The guacamole was on the smoother sides, save for the tomatoes on top.  The proportion of guacamole to chips was slightly less than 1 to 1 (had to scoop the sides for guac a little at the end).The entrees arrived thereafter.   No one was completely satisfied with all of the components of their entree, save for the person who ordered the arroz y mariscos.   The person who ordered the chicken vacafrita reported that her chicken was fine, not overcooked, and hot.  However, the onions on top were cold.  Similarly, the maduros that came with the dish were raw -- as in bright orange/yellow, hard, and not properly cooked.   She ended up eating some of the maduros that another guest ordered as a side dish, which came out fine.  I, and two other people in my party, ordered the pernil.   The pernil was seasoned in a strange way - I'm accustomed to a slightly vinegary pernil, with herbs and spices like garlic, salt, pepper, etc.   Although the plate came with an oil-and-herb cup, the meat itself did not seam properly prepared.   The best analogy that I could use to describe it is like forgetten-in-the-fridge leftovers; it kind of tasted off, or old.  The peices were all soft pieces; none were seared, nor were the edges.  The meat was served in a ""cup"" made of plantains, which were somewhat crisp around the periphery, but at the bottom, they became soggy from the meat juice.  The meat was quite juicy.  The rice and beans were okay.  The rice was slightly watery; not al dente, just soft.",1,,

166,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",2672,3521,16559,5.0,8/27/2017,"The pinnacle of the Blend empire and Miami of the LIC waterfront, Blend On The Water is one of the most beautiful venues in the borough. Be it a good view with good company or fantastic music with a killer drink, one could enjoy just about anything in an establishment that can certainly provide it. The vibes and energy are undeniable here; which is why it is a must visit.The decor is nothing less than scintillating. A snazzy bar in the front with multiple bartenders as well as TVs, and a dining room that could seat an army; all facing a clear window splendor that is the Manhattan skyline. There is also a spacious outdoor patio, which is perfect for good weather days / nights. In the background, there is usually Latin music popping off or a live band on select nights serenading the audience; a substantial asset to the ambiance.The menu is lit. Literally. All of their evening menus illuminate for easy reading in the dimmed, intimate lighting. Though it changes all the time, I look forward to their mini crispy arepitas ($8) and their empanadas / tamales  with that awesome ropa vieja stuffing. The chorizo mac and cheese  ($12) is great starter as is the ""Tres Golpes"" deviled eggs ($7). When it comes to the main entrees, I'm a fan of the Pernil ($20), which comes with a giant shank bone and the Lime Crusted Atlantic Salmon ($27) and the ever so addicting cilantro mashed potatoes.As one could imagine, the prices commensurate with the experience. It's not exactly a place to bring a cheap date, especially with their impressive line of cocktails, margaritas, and sangrias to boot. I could just as easily come here for the drinks and negate the food experience, but I think they all pair together very well.I would be remiss if I didn't mention their amazing crew. There are hiccups occasionally with the wait staff, but it's typically all sorted out with Lance and Anthony at the helm. I've often noted that sometimes service is everything, and considering all that BOTW has to offer, this aspect is really the cherry on top. They manage to make their regulars feel like VIPs and plenty of newcomers feel the same. Parking can be a challenge in the area, so their valet service is very handy. No matter how large the group is, make a reservation. Get crunk on the weekends but enjoy the slower paced weekdays. The winning formula for a great experience: surround yourself with good company + be hungry / thirsty + take in the view + enjoy the atmosphere + let the Blend crew do the rest.",25,13,18
167,Harv P.,"Franklin Square, NY",149,71,60,2.0,9/18/2017,"I really wanted to like this place after noticing the 2000+ reviews but this place is definitely overrated. Made a reservation for a Sunday night for a party of 7. We arrived in two different groups so we all had to be there before getting seated which is fair. We were directed to our table after we were already sitting, one of us had got up to go to the rest room so when the waitress vivianna came she told us we can't be seated as there are only 6 of us at the table and it is a restaurant policy. We told her one of our friends has gone to the rest room and that's when all the attitude began. We asked about the check in on yelp for the free sangria but unfortunately they do not offer it on the weekends. (It was not the biggest deal but it was false advertising as most places do honor the check in's on the weekend). So we placed an order for drinks (a pitcher of sangria which served four) the drinks were strong to my surprising! The waitress was disorganized with the way she checked IDs and kept forgetting whose id she had already looked at which was kind of annoying. It was a busy night for them but I'm sure it was no different than any other Sunday. The food options were limited in comparison to other restaurants, the food was average. No one had complaints but no one was wowed. The only thing I suggest you don't get is a side of cilantro mashed potatoes, it underwhelming. Not creamy/buttery and lacked flavor. By dessert time the waitress got a little bit more friendly but overall not personable to the guests.Two stars: for the view, ambiance, nicely decorated interior, coconut flan dessert, and if it's your birthday they bring out sparklers.Would have been 3 stars if we maybe had a different waiter/waitress.",2,2,

On this visit my boyfriend and I came for brunch  and ordered guava bellinis which were fantastic and such a great deal ! $5 !!! We also both had the torrejas, basically a brûlée French toast with berry infused whipped cream! Omg amazing! We loved it so much super delicious! I want to come back just for the French toast, the home fries were also amazing, perfect crisp! We sat right by the bar which was so perfect for watching the 2018 World Cup!! Nice scenery! Attentive employees! All in all bomb restaurant! So worth it !",,,
173,Jazmin R.,"Queens, New York, NY",170,105,213,3.0,3/4/2017,"This place is definitely very popular, so a reservation is a must! I've been here twice on special occasions and have always been impressed with the sophisticated decor, all around glam and location. The location is perfect because you get views of the manhattan skyline and can take pictures by it. Finding parking is hell around LIC so I would definitely recommend valet parking. Although the ambiance is very sophisticated, the place is small so they try to squeeze as many tables they can. The way the tables are set up are unconformable because you're just practically one inch away from the other table. At night the music and crowd gets very loud so you can't really hold a conversation unless you're yelling across the table. I have tried the Pernil and it was very well seasoned and huge in portion! It's more of a plate for two. I also tried some of the Churrasco made well done and it was not too dry, juicy and flavorful. Also, their Sangria is a little sweet and not too potent, so not my favorite.Overall the food is delicious, so three stars to that.",3,,
174,Delfin A.,"Queens, NY",1,22,3,1.0,9/2/2018,"Just went to this spot with 3 other people and was  refused service due to the shorts I was wearing. I was told that they are athletic and it is not up to par with their dress code; mind you there were folks in the restaurant with short shorts, tank tops and flip flops. The hostess was super rude and made a scene in front of everyone.  Never again will I come to this over priced and poor representation of Spanish food. If this establishment prides itself with ""proper representation"" they should start with the hostesses because the first thing you see when you enter isn't ""pretty or up to par""",,,

I sit outside just be attacked by small little insects that were too annoying to ignore. I get up and ask my waiter if it was possible to be moved inside. She directed me to her manager who told me all the tables inside were waiting for reservations. It didnt take more than 8 seconds for a white couple to get up as well and ask their waiter for the same thing. This white couple is now sitting inside eating, while I was told no. i am now sitting at the bar, after ordering food, with no one attending to my table. Gross service!",1,,
177,Alexis R.,"Ridgewood, Queens, NY",16,11,0,1.0,2/23/2018,"Blend on the Water has disappointed me in a way I have never been disappointed at any restaurant. I have been here multiple times until my visit today. Today my husband, friend and I went in at about 7pm. We made reservations about 1 hour prior and since it was raining the restaurant was not busy at all. We arrived, parked our car and was greeted by our waiter which explained to us that we can not order appetizers without ordering entrees. We explained to her that we have gone there many times and eaten appetizers and had drinks, sometimes even two each and about 3 drinks each. She said their policy is to not allow ppl to order appetizers with out an entree so we asked to speak to the manager. Two minutes later the manager appears and basically told us that we have to go if we don't plan to order entrees. At that point we weren't even sure if we wanted entrees or not! But that kind of service is just unacceptable you shouldn't be forced to order something you're unsure of! I will never return here and I'll make sure to tell my friends and family about the service I received. Chris the manager only offered to give us back our valet payment but told us we had to go! If it was lance he would have allowed us to eat. Smh I won't be returning.",3,1,1
178,Alexis M.,"Brooklyn, NY",31,278,9021,5.0,2/6/2017,"Where do I begin with my review.... There are a few things that I want to highlight:Blend On The Water is located in Long Island City and their decor includes sleek and sophisticated seating,  bathrooms, table settings, and cool windows that have views overlooking the water. It put me in this peaceful, soothing kind of mood as I enjoyed the ambiance. It is probably a nice place to dine at during the summer season.Food- We were able to partake of some of their delicious items on their Brunch Menu. The Strawberry Mango Salad had just the right amount of fruit, lettuce, cheese etc. It was so fresh! Exceptional Turkey Bacon rich in flavor and the Cuban French Toast w/ Berry flavored Whipped Cream was light, fluffy and buttery goodness down to the last bite! The syrup on the side was the perfect accompaniment to this great dish....I wanted to order more french toast but I did not want to be greedy!-lol.Great customer service! Michele was such a lovely person and made sure that we were provided with excellent service. She was warm, friendly, professional, humorous and courteous throughout the entire time. Kudos to this establishment for hiring such individuals like her! It is safe to say that I will be back soon to partake of other items on their brunch as well as their dinner menu!",8,6,11

Updated review","The food here was great! The churrasco steak tasted nice and tender and the presentation was well. It comes with plantains and rice with salad. This is a good place to come for a special occasion. The service could've been better but it didn't ruin our meal. Our waiter only came to check on us once throughout the entire meal and that was only to get the order. I understand this isn't the restaurants fault though, my service might be better next time. The menus are also light up which is pretty and the palace has a really nice décor. Check in to get a free sangria! They taste flavorful and great.",1,,
180,Ant R.,"New York, NY",163,79,18,2.0,2/21/2018,"I went here for a birthday dinner with my gf and specified this in my reservation. Thank goodness my gf is not picky. *wipes forehead*This restaurant is situated in a very magical location overlooking the east river. It really makes for some breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline at night. We walk in, there's no greeter or maitre d. She finally comes out, greets the person in front of us, asks if they have a reservation, tells them to wait a few moments and she'll be with them.My gf and I walk up because we're next. She does not greet us. So I start the conversation. ""Hi, how are you?""  She mutters ""Hi."" I pause a bit to see if she would at least practice common courtesy of at least responding to the question asked and then asking how I was. Nope, not at all. Just the flat muttered ""Hi"" paired with a stare (no smile).So I just give my last name because I was not quite sure how to response to a muttered hi paired with a stare. The food was average. I wouldn't recommend the chips and guacamole unless you absolutely need some avocado in your life..The tortilla chips weren't fresh and the guacamole had little flavor and too much oil in it. The arepas and chorizo mac n cheese were delicious.Here's the kicker. The waitress was aware I had an egg allergy because I inquired if there was any egg in the mac n cheese. She told us there were no eggs in the mac n cheese so we ordered it. We ordered the crispy chicken entree...The crispy chicken entree came out with with a side of fried rice that had these BIG CHUNKS OF EGG IN IT... Still didn't register to the waitress that someone at this table has an egg allergy - or maybe it did and she just didn't care. So I tried getting the waitresses attention so I could order a non egg side. Could not get here attention. The crispy chicken was actually dry chicken. I ate it because I was hungry.  The front of house manager was very visible but more visible in the sense of maybe he was walking around the restaurant a lot so he can achieve his steps goal in a fitness app. He was barely present. We could visibly see him but it felt as if no one in the restaurant realized how sub par their service was and they kind of just get by on that due to their location.I would return here but ONLY to sit at the bar and I know that's taking a chance based off the service that was given on the floor. But I liked the coconut mojitos. Yes, I'm a lush and I have no shame. I would go here for drinks and then go somewhere else for dinner.But really, shame on whomever is running this restaurant. It really has so much potential. But after writing this review and reflecting on my experience here, l would not advise having dinner here. You've been warned.",3,,

184,Brenae L.,"Manhattan, NY",164,140,271,3.0,4/12/2017,"Blend has a great view of Manhattan but the wait for a table outside to enjoy the view can be pretty lengthy. We had a 6:15 reservation and an outside table was an additional 30-45 minute wait. I found the food pretty bland for Latin fusion and the guacamole seemed like they'd poured it out of a pre-made mix, instead of making a fresh batch. The sangria (which is free with a check-in) was delicious and my favorite thing on the menu. Our waitress wasn't super attentive (she stopped by once when our food first arrived but I had to flag someone down to get a refill of water). The website makes it seem like there's a strict dress code -- dress at your own risk. I saw plenty of people in sneakers and super casual clothes.",,1,

Infuriating. There are few seats at the bar and we were 6 so we spent our wait dodging waitresses that were serving tables behind their tiny ass bar area. The one saving grace was the bartender Mario; he was super pleasant and attentive. The food was meh...had the worst Bloody Mary I ever had and the most done ""medium rare"" steak I've ever had in my life. I won't be running to go back.",,,

The pros I had almost all their appetizers food is pretty good. The music is good. Its like a Spanish ambiance and the crowd is mixed. I went early evening so i did not really get to see how lit it gets at night. It has a magnificent view though you can see the river and manhattan and all that good stuff. There is also a ferry there so you dont have to drive to get here. I had the Churrasco with the white rice and the beans and it was very good. Also, there are two restaurants this is the only I've tried. Ill let you guys know how that goes.",,,

Parking is extremely limited, but they have a valet. Also as a friendly reminder please dress up. My cousin wasn't let in because he came in drawstring shorts. Thankfully the valet guy lent him a pair of jeans. Always going beyond the call of duty. 5 star service!",,,

If you plan on going during the weekend, make sure to make a reservation because they are usually packed. They do have a bar area and you can always grab seats there and order food from there.They have a very decent menu with lots of options and everything is reasonably priced. The drinks are on the OK side---I found the drinks to be watered down each time I went.

Period. I have not had any issues with any plate thus far​ and I have been here 6 plus​ times. The views are amazing...right on the water by the Pepsi sign. The place is also very attractive.  People come here to be seen as well as fed (especially on the weekends).Service is generally slow both at the bar and at a table.  I thought it was because of how busy​ they were but I have also had slow service at the bar when I was the only one there for lunch. Sometimes this place does get packed so make a reservation to be sure you get a seat if you are coming for dinner.  The prices are a little high for dinner but they have a great lunch menu that is much better priced.,,,

192,Shantelle C.,"New York, NY",53,190,958,3.0,2/16/2017,"Valentine's Day 2017 :). I went to Blend On the Water for a 10 PM reservation; My boyfriend and I were seated right away; there was no wait, even though the place was packed! Lucky for us, we were seated by the windows. Of course, the view is AMAZING! There was a set Valentine's Day menu of $160 per couple two apps, two entrees, and two desserts. - For our apps, we each had arepas with shredded beef on top. The shredded beef on top of the arepas was really good. The arepa (itself) was not for me. - For our entrees my boyfriend had the pernil; this is not your grandma's or mom's Christmas pernil with the crispy skin, LOL. It was like boiled and soggy, AKA NOT COOL. This was actually suppose to be my plate, but my boyfriend decided to switch with me since he knew I would not have enjoyed it, HA. I ended up having what was suppose to be my boyfriend's entree, the churrasco; this was the best thing we ate. It came well done, just like I asked! My boyfriend had a coconut margarita and a sangria; he said the drinks were good. - Now to our two desserts? OH, RIGHT... WE DID NOT GET TWO DESSERTS, THEY ONLY SERVED US ONE. The ONE dessert was OKAY. * Next time, I'll come for the view and not the restaurant. Oh, and the bouncer was really nice and friendly! He is probably the best person on the staff team!Oh, and check-in for a free sangria? SIKE... I WAS NOT ABLE TO REDEEM IT!",1,3,
193,Jesus R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",11,20,43,2.0,10/12/2018,"Over priced and overrated. This place is truly one of the worst places I've been to in terms of efficiency. When me and my friends arrived we were told that it was going to be a bit of a wait which was fine and understandable. However, there were people there who didn't even make a reservation that got seated before us so that was the first strike. The second strike was when we did get seated the server did not come to us for about 30 minutes and didn't bring our drinks to us for another 30 minutes. The 3rd and final strike was the fact that the server completely forgot what we ordered! Now I don't like to complain because I know the hospitality industry is hectic and can be overwhelming but if you're going to work in the industry at least be prepared for the amount of work you're going to get into. The food was overpriced for the portion sizes. I don't feel like I got the most bang for my buck and I'm not cheap even in the slightest but I don't want to feel like I was robbed. Food was okay at most. It's not a restaurant that prides itself on good food. Just more so for the high class esthetic if you want to snap some good photos for Instagram.",,,

It's basically the skirt steak sliced up and mixed with small potatoes. It's definitely a twist on the usual lomo saltado dish but it was nothing i would order again. The fish on the menu i sampled was pescado encocado . That was very good . If i go back i would definitely order that .  Drink menu is pretty good , lots of interesting frozen drinks and a few decent beers as well .",,,
197,Kemiyah L.,"Coney Island, Brooklyn, NY",57,3,4,3.0,10/9/2018,"I visited this location yesterday to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. I made a reservation so we were seated right away. The restaurant has a romantic kind of ambience, it's dimly lit and the tables are all decorated with tea lights. There is a great waterfront view as well, with the city skyline in the background. I was thrilled when our waiter seemed to be welcoming and energetic, so I assumed the service would be impeccable for our first visit. Much to my dismay, after receiving our food, that would be the last I saw of him for a while. Upon booking my reservation I selected that our meal was a special occasion, and included in the notes that it was my s.o's birthday and I would like them to sing and bring out the firecrackers and all the other fanfare that accompanies a celebration. Well that never happened. Not once did my waiter even stop by to see if everything was okay with our meal, if we needed anything, just nothing. As a matter of fact, I had to flag someone else down to find him so he could bring us the check. Even when he finally stopped by he just slapped the table while walking by and said he'd be back with the check. The food was amazing! The presentation was well thought out and Instagram worthy. I particularly enjoyed the mussels I ordered. My boyfriend said the food was so good he didn't want to speak to me!

The decor is very nice and the background music was playing at a good volume. The food was delicious and considering the venue feels upscale, very reasonably priced. Seafood paella was $20 and very tasty. It was different from most other paellas I've had, but I think this restaurant has their own take on different dishes (it's Latin fusion). We also had the pernil, which I would have preferred not shredded, but the tostones were done perfectly. The beans could have been more flavorful. I got a free rosé sangria for checking in on yelp, and it was good, but too sweet for me (most cocktails are) and only had 2 bits of fruit. It was free though, so I can't complain!
