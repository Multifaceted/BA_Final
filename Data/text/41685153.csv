0,Seth J.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",117,30,0.0,4.0,6/7/2018,"This is a nice, clean gym with a fantastic view of NYC. The cardio machines are set up facing the city view. The gym has a decent selection of machines and equipment, but not as complete as my previous gym. However, membership in this gym includes access to the Palisades Park location. That location has more weight equipment than Edgewater.  It was a tough choice as to which location to sign up with. Palisades Park costs less and has better weight equipment. Edgewater has better cardio equipment plus the view and also includes access to Palisades Park. I ended up choosing Edgewater. Before making the choice, I tried every other local gym I could find. Some were more expensive but offered less in the way of equipment. Others were cheaper but either didn't have sufficient equipment or were dirty. Fitness Factory was the best overall package.",,,
1,Yin W.,"Manhattan, NY",36,2,0.0,1.0,6/12/2018,"I was disappointed by the Personal training company Pure Core.I was misled by trainer Lauren Lopresti from Pure Core to sign a 12 months contracts during their ""free"" assessment. During the signup, I explicitly said I didn't want to make 12 months commitment, and the trainer who signed me up said I can start with two months. Still in a dispute with the legitimacy of the contracts as they didn't provide me with the full text while asking me to sign. I understand the fitness club and the training company are two different entities. But I really hope the fitness club can protect their customers from such misleading and dishonesty from Pure Core.",5,2,

Updated review","Terrible customer service.No etiquette by the receptionist to new clients.I was offered a 3 day pass the day that I toured the facility  for a few minutes. I did not work out that day. When I returned the following week to use my ""three day pass"", I was informed that it was expired already because it needed to be consecutive days. Additionally they counted the day I toured as one day. I requested to have the date changed to start the day I was ready to workout, but was denied multiple times by the receptionist. When I asked to talk to a manager, she responded that there was no one else there, the manager had already left and she could not help me. There was zero understanding for her side and complete ineptitude. TI guess it's a good thing that this was my first experience and learned right away this was not the place to join! Good riddance! REPLY:I did not go to the gym on 5/26I was actually working 24hrs at the hospital that day! Revise your video/audio system carefully and you'll see. I went one day of the week prior and only took a tour. I find it offensive for you to imply that I'm lying. I know 100% I was not there on 5/26. I have never in my life worked out at your gym!This goes to show how poorly you run your business! Thanks for showing the public how horrendous not only your front staff is but also yourself!!",1,,

I love this place.  Some might say it's expensive .  I honestly think it's a perfect price .  I pay about 60 a month ( which includes daycare ).  They are super clean .  I love the class and how the gym is never packed .  Also the staff are amazing .  Sometime last week  I checked on the website to see what time the daycare opened it said 8 .  So when i go to the daycare i notice the sign saids summer hours .  Due to my son is 5 and he's excellent by himself .  I asked the staff member if he doesn't mind he stays in there alone . He's really good and even though i understand it's a liability .  The staff was nice enough to let him stay there alone as I ran and did a quick workout .   Classes are amazing .  So far i have done Zumba cycling and body sculpt .   I would recommend this gym if you're looking for a daycare as well as classes .,,,

Please think twice before joining the this club and take a consideration that they have a hidden fees.After you sign up the contract, they  misuse the contract by threatening to clients that you can't cancel your policy right away.You have to write 15 days ago  prior to  new bill cycle day..It need be written  letter.Orally saying is not acceptable.They have also lots of missing equipment and they charge 30$ maintenance fee for every year for fixing the equipment.It never come new equipment.When I tell them why we are getting charged for this maintenance fee even though you don't keep up the gym.They say that we don't have any missing equipment.You can just use equipment we have instead of missing  equipment.Please make sure that what you come across after you join the clup.As a result,I take a consideration of canceling my membership at gym now.",,,

There are tons of people that come here. It's not a bad gym at all. If the weights are scattered everywhere, that's not the gym's fault.

The only downgrade as compared to is the open air parking (previous gym has a garage). This gym is somewhat smaller and slightly more expensive but the people here are way better with gym etiquette and it's much less crowded. The ventilation is better as well with other gym always being too cold or too hot, with an odd smell. This gym is clean, equipment, floors and bathrooms are in great condition. Staff is always present which is also a plus. I've yet to have an incident where I was waiting for the gym to open on time here. They have a smoothie/ shake counter which has a pretty decent number of options on the menu. Protein Shakes, veggie blends etc... It might not be the prefect gum but it's pretty good for now.",4,2,

9,Michael S.,"Fort Lee, NJ",2,66,11,1.0,2/13/2018,I do not recommend this gym to anyone. Unless you're someone who has lots of money and doesn't mind getting taking advantage of. I've been in and out of this gym for the past 7 years. I've seen it go up and down but it's probably at its worst right now. I have many friends that come and used to come here. Many have left because of the hidden fees and poor customer service. I will warn to make sure you read every single fee that is mentioned in contract and document it for your own safety. They've sent my friend to debt collectors over their own mistakes. This eventually had to be resolved in court. They are always overcharging and their staff is very condescending. A quick peek at their 1 star yelp reviews will show you exactly why you should stay away and Its the same problem. Hasn't changed,3,3,1

I had to move abroad because of my visa status and gave them the heads up three weeks before my departure. Despite calling and sending emails about getting the details for cancelling my contract, I did not hear a word from them. It was the following month that they charged my US account for cancelation fees. In the meantime, I had already directed all the funds to my new account abroad, linking my BOA account in case of last minute payments. I ended up paying foreign exchange fees and transactional fees in addition to the cancellation fees that they charged me. All of this because someone of their staff was too lazy to do his work.",4,4,2

Updated review","I don't know why anyone would complain about this club! The staff is amazing, always friendly and with the view from the new cardio equipment how could anything else matter. I've been to many health club's such as la fitness and the equipment here is probably the best I've seen, the cardio equipment has huge tv screens, all touch screen and the staff will go out of the way to show you how to use them, can't get that from the big box chains now can you?",1,,
12,Gabriela G.,"11, NJ",0,1,0,5.0,2/19/2018,"On the contrary to the latest reviews, I have been a member for a year and 5 months and have had an excellent overall experience. Staff is very welcoming, accommodating & friendly. Club is equipped with everything you may need. In fact, within the last couple of months many machines have been replaced and upgrades have been made. Management and club owners have been working towards meeting the needs of all members.

13,Sharon B.,"North Bergen, NJ",3,11,4,2.0,5/18/2017,"I was loyal and happy with my trainer Angela V. until Pure Core (a personal training outsourcing company) walked in a few months ago. I gifted a pack of sessions for my sis, and she happily used 1 of 4. She texted her trainer Kelsey for another session and he never replied. I've contacted the gym on numerous occasions, and now they say the sessions expired, can not be reinstated and to top it off, ""you did not purchase from Pure Core, you purchased from Fitness Factory"". That's not right! They could not even tell me who my sister's trainer was to review past history. Better business bureau must hear about this. Additionally, I had sessions remaining with Fitness Factory (4 or 5 i believe?) I have attempted to convert those remaining private sessions to a monthly membership. They're still unable to help. It has been nearly 2 months of back and forth. WHAT IS THE DEAL Mike and Jason? Now, a family member is interested in joining. I won't discourage it because the facility suits their needs. But I suggest Pure Core and Fitness Factory get their *ISH* together!",8,1,

Once brought to their attention, they acted as if it was OUR fault. We received the same sort of unaccommodating customer service when my husband's sweater was stolen from the locker room. They need to train these girls not only in managing computer databases that hold financial information, but also in customer service skills because as of now, they are seriously lacking.

In 9 months four trainers left and finally the entire personal training group is outsourced.... with every new trainer you are basically starting all over again. Final group is definitely hustlers, your one hour session will be completed in twenty minutes.   Fitness factory is unable to retain employees or customers. Facilities should be cleaner for sure.

The fact the you also feel like your on top of the person next to you while you are working out is also a NO for me. This gym is extremely small and it seems like machines are always broken.

I think the gym is reasonable clean.  I like how everything is spread out.  It never feels crowded.  Another thing, not a deal breaker but they do have WiFi but most days it is unusable.  I say this because most cardio equipment have screens but there are only a few channels and the quality is lousy.  Think tvs with rabbit ears from the 1970s.",,,

Updated review","You will get a better workout running away from this place than signing up for a membership . The machines stay broken, treadmills lag when you try to put the speed up, weights scattered everywhere . Dirty womens locker room where male maintence workers come in unannounced. Attempted to cancel after my 1 year was up . The manager was one the nastiest humans I have ever encountered on the phone . He was also unresponsive and unprofessional . Now I am being charged for an extra month I won't use . There are plenty of residential buildings with gyms in Edgewater and the surrounding area . Do yourself a favor and move to one of those . No gym stink, creepy men, meat head managers or overcrowding ! You will also be doing your part to put Fitness Factory out of business .",3,2,
21,Gustavo C.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",42,1,0,1.0,1/12/2016,"Horrible Gym, I have been a member for 6 months here and it's the first time I feel humiliated. My entire family has a membership and when we went to ask for another membership. This one was for my cousin which is a student. We asked if that was the lowest price for a student membership. The manager, with an attitude and bad tone, said this gym was PREMIUM and they have these prices because its for certain type of people. Excuse me? Premium? This gym doesn't even have a pool. This was not the way to respond to three of your current members regarding a new membership. We didn't have a problem with the price, but the way of him treating us for just asking a question was unacceptable.",11,2,1
22,Nilda N.,"Miami, FL",0,4,0,1.0,8/16/2017,"While this gym has some very,very nice staff members the manager lacks everything you would desire from someone in his position. Jason is rude and has absolutely no  social skills to deal with the public. Owners reccently outsourced their personal training dept and brought in Pure Core to do the personal training. The deal they offered the trainers who were already there was so disrespectful,most of the best ones left. They are all about money. Many of their new trainers don't have reputable certifications. I have been training for many years and can see the poor quality of some of the new trainers. FF has a beautiful set up in Edgewater but it needs a huuuuuge change beginning from the manager to the way the personal training  dept works. Read about Pure Core and you will see the horrible reviews and long history of complaints. When Pure Core came on board they transferred accounts to them without clients authorizations and treated clients disrespectful when questioned. Many of the people who were doing personal training left and followed their old trainers who were top notch. The only thing that keeps me.there is the classes but the management leaves  a lot to be desired. Machines break down and it takes very long for repair. The place needs revamping: new manager,sufficient cleaning staff to keep the place clean etc. The front desk people,although very nice, have no clue what is going on at the gym,not because they are bad but because they are not informed by management. You walk in for a class and they have no idea if there will be a class or not. Another management issue. Please,rethink your management techniques,get rid of Pure Core ,bring back the awesome trainers you had inform your staff of schedule changes,etc.  Its very simple: provide the service you advertise and keep your members happy.",4,,

All the cardio machines are facing the large windows so it feels like your running outside.. Clean, friendly staff, has loads of classes and they have very new machines!! Compared to all the other local gyms around here I feel like they have the most updated machinery which is awesome. Complimentary towels for every member.They also have a shake bar, sell protein snacks, fresh fruit, and sell cold press juices from juice journey! The locker rooms are very clean.

24,Jennifer D.,"Riverside, MO",97,3,0,5.0,1/13/2016,"We moved to NJ in June, and began our search for a gym in August. As a stay at home mom with very active 1 year old twins, I needed to find something with childcare that fit my fitness goals and my husband's busy work schedule. The childcare was the tipping point to our decision. We are extremely happy we chose Fitness Factory. It beat out another local gym that was walking distance from our house. The staff is accommodating, friendly, knowledgeable, and exactly what we would hope to have in a business we use every day. The girls working in the childcare immediately eased my 'first time leaving our kids with a ""babysitter""' jitters. I cannot begin to describe how happy our boys are when they get to play at the gym and see ""their girls"". I am confident in their abilities to manage multiple kids of all ages at once. The facility is laid out well, and even on a busy night, we don't have problems hitting all of the weights and machines we want to use. The view of NYC is amazing, and setup perfectly in front of the cardio machines. The locker rooms offer plenty of lockers and space, shower stalls, a sauna, and a steam room. The facility is always clean. While it is on the 2nd floor, we have no problems getting our kids up there with the help of the elevator. On the rare occasional I'm struggling to get them out to my car, I've had staff members offer to help me out (how nice!). There is a shake/smoothie bar inside as well, with many optional add-ins. Yum!I can also speak on the quality of the personal trainers. I have been working with Billy for a month or so, as I've begun to train for a fitness competition. He has showed me great new workouts, and my physical progress is apparent. All of the trainers have their own style, and appear to have great results with clients. If you're looking to start with a gym, or to change gyms, I recommend you give Fitness Factory a try.",5,,1
25,Grace Lee A.,"New York, NY",42,308,54,4.0,2/7/2016,"This gym is located in Edgewater Commons shopping center by Outback Steak house and it is overlooking the waterwayI had a 7-day pass for Fitness Factory in Edgewater and I enjoyed the clean facility and the variety of machines. The front desk staff is very friendly and accommodating and professional. The bathroom and locker rooms are clean. They provide towels at the front desk. There is a nice view of the river and the west side of manhattan overlooking the cardio machines. There is also a juice bar on premises by the front desk area, and a child care room as well. Overall a well -managed gym. For all the 7 days I was there, it never was crowded even at peak times in the evening, and patrons are orderly and polite to each other. Zero ratchets.You will need to bring your own lockThe bathrooms are clean. They provide a generic brand shampoo and body wash and the showers are clean and well kept. The water pressure is good as well.There is both a dry and steam sauna in each of the mens and women locker room.My fiancee told me the steam sauna in the men's locker room gets hot and steamy, and he was very impressed by the quality of their steam and sauna facility; however the steam sauna in the women's locker room is very lacking.  The steam and dry sauna area is very clean, however, the steam is very weak and it does not get hot at all. It takes a while to get somewhat steamy, and this is quite disappointing for me. This is one of the reasons why I did not extend my membership past the 7 day trial... This was about 3 weeks ago, and they may or may not have fixed or improved the women's steam situation. IF the women's steam sauna has been fixed and is in beautiful working order, I may consider signing up for an annual membership at this gym (which is about $50 a month for annual membership; there are other flexible/economic membership options as well)Otherwise, if you live in the area, check it outI believe there are some Yelp deals as well.

After many years, I have realized no matter how hard I pushed myself using the equipment available, I simply didn't see the results I wanted. Could it be because I didn't have the right form when using the equipment? Most definitely! This is my first year, where I said - ""I need professional help""!My personal trainer at Fitness Factory is great. She is not a boot-camp-style trainer but every visit I am challenged and maximizing the benefits of each exercise in order to achieve my main goal. There is no diet plan with any of the trainers here but I know all of them speak their minds and make suggestions on a healthy habitual eating and drinking lifestyle. I have developed a good relationship with my trainer where she is open to answer any of my questions or concerns and works with me to adjust a routine or a schedule. After every workout I leave happy, empowered and know I tried something new and succeeded. As far as the facility goes, the staff and other trainers are super friendly and professional. I would say they have a variety of equipment, which includes a few resistance machines such chest press and shoulder press. Free-weight equipment such as bench press, military press, cable cross-over and dumbbells are also available. Additional equipment includes medicine and stability balls and a variety of cardiovascular machines such as treadmills, ellipticals, and steppers. Happy to say showers, sauna and locker rooms are sanitized. Haven't seen a mess yet! For those considering in hiring a personal trainer, I know the decision can be an empowering one.  Especially when it comes to money. In my opinion, yes it is a bit pricey but I found my right match at Fitness Factory and I will drive many miles just to see her.So , Will it be easy? Nope! Is it worth it? Absolutely!

They have an old business model that they lock you in a contract and they wont let you get out no matter what, and even if you move out of area, they charge you a fee for leaving.

Back when this gym was ""Thrive Fitness"" I was a member. I also lived in Fort Lee at that time. I'm on the fence about this gym. I didn't hate it, but I wouldn't consider becoming a member. Pros:* It's clean* They have a sauna and steam room* The locker room is large with plenty of vanity space.* They offer hot yoga and there is a spin room. * There is a room for kids to play while the parents work out. Cons:* I personally don't like the way the gym is laid out. I realize this is partially due to the space available to them, but I don't like it. * I don't feel there's enough cardio equipment should they become busy. Example, there are only 2 StairMaster units. This may be an infrequently used piece but if both are being used, I'm SOL. Neutral:* All of the cardio equipment is connected to basic TV channels and the Internet. They use a system that allows you to either watch TV, play a few match games, or do a virtual run throughout towns around the world.

You are locked in and have to pay little fees, for small things, that should be just part of good customer service. This is a old bullshit model (Blockbuster style). Few months ago my credit card was stolen and I had to update my card on file. I was  few days late updating my credit card on file, they charged me a fees and it was a pain. The person behind the counter is convinced that customers are locked it and they are not going anywhere. If they do they have to pay a fees. This GYM is also over crowded and it smells! The staff is miserable and they never smile ( if they do its fake..you can tell) or say never hello. I usually see them all working out on equipments. Mens locker smells like dead skunk. I have alert on my card because you never know you might get a unknown service charge fee.  Stay away.",3,,

To those that had a bad taste in their mouth from the old Thrive Gym which formerly occupied this space I recommend you come back and try it again. The facility has a nice flow, plenty of unique equipment such as heavy ropes, cables/bands, and kettle balls. I've worked out at Ballys/Cando/Thrive over the years and I prefer it over all of them.

Spin with Paul and Zumba with Ruddy are my favorite. Ruddy is an awesome instructor with great music! I schedule around his classes so that I won't miss them. The lockers rooms are ample in size as well as everything you need to get ready for work. I shopped around for gyms in the area and I'm so glad with my final decision to join this particular location. Staff is friendly.,1,,

They always welcome you in and out of the club. They supply towels and the locker rooms are clean as well. There's a lot of different equipment to use, plenty of cardio, and the studio room is large and available to use when no classes are going on. Also the music is good which is important, many gyms I've gone too have had awful playlists. It's never super crowded, and the member are mostly very considerate about sharing machines and wiping off benches. I've never taken any of the classes but from the times I've seen them take place they are always crowded which is a good sign. They also have a large selection of classes from spin to aerobics, etc. would deff recommend this gym if your looking for a new place.",1,,
46,Jessica Y.,"Fort Lee, NJ",344,35,2,5.0,8/29/2013,"This is the first gym that I've committed to in my entire life. And it definitely deserves it. I absolutely love love love this gym!I started off with a one week free trial that is available for anyone who lives around the area. After that, I ended up loving the gym so much that I signed up for a 3 month membership since I was planning on leaving the state for a month or so after the 3 months were up. Once I returned, I ended up committing to a 2 year membership.The membership for this gym is considered a tad on the pricier end, but all the benefits you get with it make this price worth it. First off, the gym is clean as can be. The staff takes a lot of care to keep the locker rooms sparkling clean, keep the toiletries refilled, and to keep the overall gym environment great. The rooms that the classes are held in are cleaned and there's always an abundance of fresh towels to use for your face and for showers. Secondly, the view is absolutely breathtaking. You can see the NY skyline through the windows when you take a spin class or when you're just on the cardio machines working out. I come here mainly for the group classes offered. There are SO many classes at all different times of the day. There's morning classes for people who have work later in the day or even night classes for people who like to hit the gym after work. I don't do much with the free weights, so I can't really comment on the availability of machines and such.Cardio machines are plentiful and there's an interactive screen attached to almost every machine. There are stairmasters, treadmills, different types of ellipticals, as well as some other machines. This gym also offers a childcare service in an adorable play room. Definitely great for moms or dads who want a quick workout while their kids are entertained. They make smoothies also. I can't say that I""ve tried one, but I will soon! Fitness Factory mailed me a personal birthday card for my birthday along with a free guest pass and a pass for a free smoothie. This gym is definitely worth the price and one of the few gyms that I find myself returning to again and again. Everyone here is very nice and knowledgeable and willing to help you with anything you need. Check it out!",10,1,1
47,Anthony P.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",152,15,1,2.0,11/10/2016,"2 stars for being clean and having friendly staff. It's the patrons that ruin this place. No one reracks weights and the free weight area is always disorganized. No one has gym etiquette here. Also, the machines are not very useful. They remind me more of physical therapy machines or something used for rehabilitation, not building real muscle.

I just called my credit card company and they are cancelling the dispute now that it has been resolved. Everyone seemed nice, but nothing got done until I took more formal steps. Kinda disappointing for such a nice gym and few nice front desk staff members.

Fitness Factory is ho-hum...Its just not that great. Broken machines, demands a Facebook ""like"" to get a free day. Nice view of the river though, staff not friendly, changing rooms OK  but looking dated which is weird as it hasn't been there very long. Lots of other better gym competition in the area. This gym is only for cardio and classes as the weight room is tiny and poorly stocked, they should just remove it. I have no knowledge about the ""Owner is a lawyer who likes to sue negative reviewers"" Maybe should improve the place first, then sue people - just my 2 cents.I would try the free day, but pass on the classic ""lock you into a year"" membership scam that these gyms still do. It seems that gyms in the Edgewater NJ area come and go, this one will probably go when the landlord figures out how to get the permit to put a restaurant in the space, as the view of the river is amazing and cannot be beat - but the gym is disappointing and should be avoided.",4,,

It's not massive or premium like Equinox that I used to go to but since I wanted a gym in NJ, I'll  give it a try. One thing I noticed immediately was their inconsistency in customer service. The first time i visited the girl at the front desk was helpful and pleasant. However the two other times I've gone it seemed like I was bothering the front desk girl. I attended a Sunday morning Yoga class, The front desk person was no where to be found. I looked around and saw a girl gossiping with a friend in the daycare, she looked at me and told me to check myself in. I needed a towel and because she was too busy in the daycare Chatting with her friend, I had to reach behind the desk to get my out towel. When I was finished with my class i asked about personal training. Again she seemed bothered that I was interrupting her and told me to go online and look up the personal training people as she couldn't help me because they are a separate department. What bothered me was  her tone and lack of interest in helping me. I'm hoping the rest of the staff is not like her and treat their client with more care and assistance. Otherwise I will trying put another gym.",4,,

I was a member at Thrive Fitness, which used to occupy this location.  This gym is cleaner, has newer equipment, and nicer locker rooms.But I preferred Thrive, because they actually had more of what people who lift weights need.And here is my issue.  There is only ONE RACK in the entire gym if you want to squat or do deadlift with a free barbell.  These are two of the most important exercises for anyone who weight trains, and there is ONLY ONE place in this entire gym (full of machines) where you can do the squat and deadlift.  If someone else is using the rack when you show up, you could easily end up waiting 30 minutes before being able to use it.  You can't really 'work in' while someone else is in the middle of their sets, because that would involve moving many heavy plates on/off.  Thrive Fitness had THREE racks where you could do these free weight exercises.  (Even so, I had to wait a few times, but never for more than a few minutes at Thrive)I have complained to the manager and some employees about this, and only received shrugs and an explanation that there ""isn't space to put another cage in"".  Well, if they got rid of a few of these machines that hardly anyone ever uses, then there would be space.  Besides, move a few things around, and they could easily accommodate another free weight cage.  Summary:  ONLY ONE PLACE IN THE ENTIRE GYM WHERE YOU CAN DO SQUATS WITH FREE WEIGHTS.",4,1,1
53,Sean D.,"Colorado Springs, CO",3,13,6,4.0,1/3/2013,"I really can't understand why this gym has 2 stars. It's not a 2 star gym.

They also have a very nice scale, which is always appreciated.Overall, the crowd is decent, it's a clean gym with most machines any serious gym rat could want.The only downsides are that one of the guys that works there is kind of an idiot, though minor, and I don't even run into him that often, and that it closes at 6 on sunday, which usually makes me have to rush out : (Also, if it closed at midnight during the week, life would be a lot easier, but alas.",4,1,1

In addition what I also am writing here has been said to staff. I like giving input with new businesses:I've overheard the man a number of times give a tour speaking about surfing the web & Facebook while on the treadmill. These activities promote laziness. Stop mentioning that. Gyms need swagger, hype, and an environment that screams fitness..A tiny community with a common ground... healthy living. Get some swag. 1 star goes to the location, the other the stair master machine & the other to my trainer.What would make this a 5 star gym would be the following: mirrors that you can see your feet while doing squats, more accessories for the equipment, more benches and privacy in the locker room. This gym has a big competitor up the road. Follow suit as MUCH as possible with those guys.Shotty crap bought at bb& beyond in the bathroom with the price tags still on it...soap dispensers and stuff. These aren't durable items for commercial use. Steam room takes a long time to heat up. Don't have all day. (Maybe turn on steam room prior to entry --- but that's ONE more thing to think about)The bikes in front do not really like it when you stand up and pedal. Kinda takes the fun out of the workout.

I only wish that the classes would run on the same schedules. For example, I'd like to leave Body Pump to go to Spin or vice versa when it's finished, not have to leave the class fifteen or thirty mins before it's over. I also would really appreciate there being clocks somewhere in the facility! I know it sounds crazy, but it feels like  a casino! I never know what time it is. Since, I don't wear a watch to work out, I don't want to accidently miss a class I was really looking forward to!  As far as staff, they've all been very friendly. Just wish that I would've received a tour of gym when I first came in. (I signed up when it was in PreSale.) I was a bit intimidated to explore the crazy looking machines at first!

They have financial problems, and word is that they're going to shut down real soon. I have other options to explore, and if you do, you should too. They lied to us about rooftop classes, and if you take a class, all you hear is weights dropping and put back on the racks, as the muscle heads surround the studio.

The staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly. I've taken 6 classes and every one started on time and was a great workout!

However since I only am able to come to the gym on weekends and like attending group classes, I am hoping for some classes that are on weekdays to start on weekends too. For example, the Zumba on Fridays from 6-7 is great but would be better to have it on a Saturday or a Sunday morning too. Currently there are only 2-3 of us taking the class on Fridays but I am sure once the class is moved to Saturdays, you will have a full house like we had earlier in Thrive. Zumba is fun only if you have a room full of energetic people.I am hoping the weekend classes promised for phase 2 begin soon.",3,,

71,Maria W.,"Hudson County, NJ",0,8,0,4.0,7/12/2012,"I think all of the other reviewers haven't been back to this gym. I don't see most of the problems that are stated. They must have really worked on getting it together, although there could still be more improvement.I'll address all 12 points listed on the other negative review  by Dee. D(1) The classes are never on time. Even 2 min is MY time. I sit all day, so every min counts!I've never been to a class that is not on time. I take body pump and zumba and they are always on time.(2) There's no clocks! Put in clocks There are a few clocks now(3) As another reviewer said, please space out the classes so members can take, for example, a yoga class at 6pm and a zumba class at 7pm I think the spacing of the classes have improved. You can take yoga and zumba on the same day or do a body pump and then cycling.  Check out the schedule.  (4) I was misled by their false claims that they were offering ""Bikram Yoga"". As most in the fitness field know (or should know) Bikram is a copyrighted, specific form of yoga. Either they didn't know they can't tell people they were offering Bikram (when in reality it's not) or they flat out lied...I don't know which is worse.They call it Hot Yoga and it is offered many times during the week (5) Additionally, it's $15 extra to take this class and after dealing w rushing to get there and traffic, if the class is full, you're SOL.  I haven't taken the hot yoga, but if it is $15 extra for each class then I think that's a bit too much, especially if you'd like to take if a couple of times a week.(7) Location: In shopping center (near Pathmark & Target) on River Rd (this rd can be very congested, so give yourself plenty of time). I've had no problem so far. I just make sure to get there a bit earlier and park further away if I have to do that.(8) Quality of classes/instructors:       1. I don't get why some of the instructors face you during class?! Turn around so we can mirror you. I don't see the problem with that. This way the instructors can see who is doing it correctly. Most of the instructors do face the mirror.       2. And please, if I'm rushing to get there and spending an hour w you, make it count!!  My biggest turn off is when I rush to get there after work, the class is late (usually late instructor or another class running over) and the class is sub-par.I've only been to one sub-par class, but I don't see her listed anymore as an instructor. (9) The ""views"" were really a selling point when they were signing up people. Umm...what views? If you go when it's dark out, the glare from the horrible, horrible bright overhead lights makes a glare on the windows (as well as the moniter's on some of the machines) and you can't see anything except your own reflection.I agree that the morning and night glare can make it difficult. There should be some type of screen that can come down in the early morning.(10) The reponse to ""Melissa D's"" comment on here is very unprofessional, and I only bring this up because they've lost my paperwork before (taking time from my schedule to get them when they lost) and, like I said above, don't run the classes on time and don't run the gym according to industry standards. This person wasn't a customer, but every business should abide by the standard that the customer is always right. Fine, taking responsibilty for putting the flyer on her car was great, but than saying she put a foot mark on your wall?! LOL. That's just very unprofessional, reflects poorly on your management, and should make you think twice about going here.I haven't seen any problems in this area and I think all the staff has been pretty friendly so far.(11) I pay $40 something/month for a yr. contract. While it's about average for NJ, there are better (better to me in terms of the classe) places in the area for cheaper, so I don't feel like I'm getting a good deal.I feel I""m getting a good deal. YOu can go down the road and pay $100 a month and they don't even offer zumba and hot yoga.(11) They have signs in the locker rooms saying something like ""give us your input or suggestions to make us better"". I haven't seen these anywhere.",,,
72,Sulyca H.,"Edgewater, NJ",0,1,0,2.0,4/5/2012,"The equipment is nice and the space is also nice.  However, I am very disappointed with the classes.  When I signed up in December, I was shown a calender that would begin in January or shortly after and it included 3 morning Zumba classes, 2 morning Pilates classes,and 2 morning absolution classes . But they are only offering 2 Zumba and 1 Pilates (which gets extremely crowded and makes it tough to do certain moves comfortably).  The absolution classes were dropped all together.  Another morning Pilates class would be extremely helpful as well as an additional morning Zumba instructor to mix it up.  I left my previous gym thinking that the classes here would be better, (its not like I was getter a better price), but I feel short changed.I tried the yoga  class early on and did not like the way the instructor taught.The guy in the front and the instructors are pretty nice.The towels are pretty dingy, they smell like no detergent or softener is used and are all thrown in a corner to air dry.",,,
73,Kelly C.,"Weehawken, NJ",0,1,0,4.0,2/21/2012,"I have been a member of various gyms around the area and this one by far is the best.  Pretty much all of the construction is done and it's beautiful.  The machines are user friendly if you feel comfortable working computers.  If you're not, you can always ask for help.  The front desk people are really nice when you walk in and the trainers always say hello to me. The steam room is a favorite and I really like that they have towel service so I don't have to bother bringing one of my own.  Parking is easy and it's also great that the supermarket is right there too.  I also go after work and I have yet to wait for a machine. Great place and I'm so very happy there.",,,
74,Oudomphone Breeda P.,"Weehawken, NJ",141,9,18,2.0,2/14/2012,"The gym itself is an extremely beautiful facility.  However, it was still under construction when I went.  The zumba class instructor was awful!  It was supposed to be an hour long class...and was cut short at 45mins, there are no dimmers in the aerobic room.   I hadn't even broke a sweat.  I used to love this gym when it was Thrive.  It was less pretentious and more organized.  There are hardly any free weights at all and most of the machinery is free motion.  It's all COOL and everything..but honestly...who needs to be surfing facebook when they're on the treadmill????  The zumba class absolutely ruined it for me.  The instructor showed up late, in thigh high boots, full on make up, sans sports bra, and was out of breathe way before I even had a chance to warm up.  awful awful awful and highly unprofessional.  Don't be dooped by the cool factor of this gym, step back and take a look at the greater picture...it offers alot of neato things, but for me didn't quite deliver and is lacking many of the essentials of a traditional gym.  I opted for the place down the road.  The zumba instructor there, is the best i've had by far...ever.  I sweat way more with her 1 hour class, then I do when I play 2 hours of volleyball!",12,11,1
75,Dee D.,"New York, NY",0,18,0,1.0,2/13/2012,"There was alot of hype from this gym before it open. I am really disappointed in it but unfortunately, I'm locked into this place for another year. (1) The classes are never on time. Even 2 min is MY time. I sit all day, so every min counts!(2) There's no clocks! Put in clocks (3) As another reviewer said, please space out the classes so members can take, for example, a yoga class at 6pm and a zumba class at 7pm (4) I was misled by their false claims that they were offering ""Bikram Yoga"". As most in the fitness field know (or should know) Bikram is a copyrighted, specific form of yoga. Either they didn't know they can't tell people they were offering Bikram (when in reality it's not) or they flat out lied...I don't know which is worse. (5) Additionally, it's $15 extra to take this class and after dealing w rushing to get there and traffic, if the class is full, you're SOL.  (unless you want to pay double what you're paying now and add it onto your membership lol). Please, please, let us call head (like every other gym in the industry) and sign up the day of!!! I can't afford $100+/ month on a gym, but I should still be given enough respect to not show up at the gym and be told the class is full. Not industry standard. This is such a money making scheme, giving the silver & gold members first access. I  get it, but let us minions have the chance to reserve a spot after them (the day of or even an hour before the class...be considerate to the fact that as a paying member you're not giving me a solution to driving to the facility only to find the class is full(7) Location: In shopping center (near Pathmark & Target) on River Rd (this rd can be very congested, so give yourself plenty of time). Parking on holidays is impossible. It was stressful enough to get to the gym during Thanksgiving and Christmas (prob the most important time of yr you should be going). Just something to consider, not their fault obviously and otherwise parking is fine. (8) Quality of classes/instructors:        1. I don't get why some of the instructors face you during class?! Turn around so we can mirror you.         2. And please, if I'm rushing to get there and spending an hour w you, make it count!!  My biggest turn off is when I rush to get there after work, the class is late (usually late instructor or another class running over) and the class is sub-par. I can do a workout at home in 30 min and burn more cals than in an hour of most of the class. Maybe offer a 30 min HITT type class, which could allow for #3 in my review (how about a 30 min pilates or ballet booty class followed by an intense 30 min cardio class).

76,Melissa D.,"North Bergen, NJ",0,3,0,1.0,1/2/2012,The gym left an advertisement in the windshield of my car and the paper and ink got stuck. I called the gym and he (the owner) very rudely let me k ow the gym itself does not give out the flyers. I am currently waiting at the gym for someone to get it off. Incredibly rude staff all around.,3,22,
77,Michele M.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",0,4,0,5.0,2/14/2012,"Love Love Love this gym! Everything is immaculate. As a former member of CanDo (that overpriced and rude gym down the road) I was so relieved to join Fitness Factory and be greeted by a knowledgeable staff and state of the art machines. It's also refreshing to have Hot Yoga as an option in a private room. I can't wait for rooftop yoga overlooking the beautiful view of NYC. With my busy schedule, it's nice to have an extensive class schedule offered with different types and classes. I look forward to going there everyday!",2,,

Updated review","This is to Breeda,   I just want to say If you came to the gym and this one situation is what you are basing your opinion on then SHAME ON YOU!!!!  I visited 10 gyms before I landed at fitness factory.  And out of those 10 gyms 2 of them being down the road I have to say there were only 2 that exceeded my expectations.  Forum in Bayonne which is just a bit far for me and Fitness Factory Edgewater.   And even at these 2 gyms do I not like every class or every instructor.   The thing is there are other members who do like them.  That is what is so great about the gym it's something for everyone.  If it's free weights you want have you checked the group fitness studio?  There are tons of them.  There is even an amazing class that you can use them in if you so choose. I have met so many amazing people and I am FAR from pretentious.   I say you probably didn't give them gym half a chance.  I have the ability to give out 4 - 7 day passes being a member and would be happy to pass one along to you if you wanted to really get the fitness factory experience.",1,,
79,Sam L.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,2,0,4.0,2/21/2012,"One of the best gyms around.  Took them awhile to get everything up and running such as workout classes, bathroom amenities, and all the other odds and ends.  VERY VERY clean and exceptional staff.  Equipment is state of the art and very user friendly for intense weight lifters and first time gym goers.  The best part for me is that it is rarely over crowded I work out usually between 6-8 pm and never have to wait for certain machines, this makes it easy to get a full workout in just around 1 hr.  8.5/10 in my book.",1,,
80,Anna C.,"Fort Lee, NJ",0,6,0,5.0,12/24/2013,"I absolutely love this gym!!! The facility is very clean and the staff is very kind. I didn't know which gym to join because I just moved to this area and I am extremely picky. So I tried out a couple of free trials around this area one in Fort Lee, 24 hour fitness, and couple of more and I want to say this gym was the best!! I read other reviews for this particular gym but I don't understand why in one of the review a person wrote that there isn't enough cardio equipment. There are so many elliptical and treadmill and there is always couple of machines open!!! If that person is specifically referring to the stair master I agree but there are many cardio machines. What sold me was mainly the staff. They are very kind and they sure know their equipments. I saw this ladder I believe it is called the Jacob's ladder that I never seen before. So I was trying to read the instructions but this worker came up to me and explained the functions and steps in using this equipment. I was nervous because I felt like if you don't step up fast enough you could fall but that wasn't the case and he showed me how to do it. I don't know how many asian worker there is but he was asian and he was very tall. I asked the lady at the reception desk to tell his manager that he is a very good worker. I absolutely love this gym and the view is fantastic!!!",1,,
81,GGirl T.,"New York, NY",0,66,2,2.0,10/25/2012,"I was gonna join, but they lost me over $15!!! (Read on :)  I used the gym for 1 week for free as a trial period.  For the price, I thought it was worth it... although the cycling bikes don't fit my body.  I think my hips are centimeters smaller than average adult, my knees keep hitting the water holders.  A different instructor told me, I have to put my butt back, but that is not what the instructors do.  Anyway, what was the big selling point for me was the hot yoga... BUT the heat wasn't working.  I took it toward the end of my week, but they let me come back after my trial period just for the hot yoga to try it out.  It wasn't working AGAIN.  (I had never taken hot yoga so I didn't want to join yet without trying it.)  So, I wanted to try it again, but they insist on me paying $15.  Out of principal, I don't know why I should when during my trial period ... and beyond, the heat wasn't working up to par.  What if I join and it's STILL not working?  The manager I had met just 2 weeks ago is already gone from the company so I dealt with a supervisor who, instead of giving up the $15, let me, a potential customer, go.  It was a turn-off.  Also that she wanted proof of what days I came in to try the heat yoga as if not trusting me and acting like I was cheating the system.  Again, big turn off.  Already manager is gone and the supervisor is too strict.  I move on.",5,3,1
