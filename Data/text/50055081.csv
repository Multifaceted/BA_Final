0,Eric U.,"Los Angeles, CA",159,66,543,5.0,7/30/2018,"The hotel is in a great location--just a couple of blocks away from the NRQW, BDF and 7 lines and so close to Grand Central.  It's right down the street from Times Square, but tucked away just far enough from the crazy crowds.  We stayed for 6 nights and it was a like home away from home during our trip back to NYC.  Our room was towards the back of the hotel, and didn't have a great view (would have been nice to see the NY Public Library), but was very quiet at night.  We thought our king bed was very comfy.Like others have mentioned, there's no true check-in counters at Hyatt's Andaz properties, but there is an island in the lobby staffed with attendants.  We never had an issue with availability of friendly staff or any requests during our stay.  Thumbs up for complimentary wine happy hour from 6-9pm.  Another thumbs up for complimentary bottled water, sodas, and snacks refilled daily in your room bar.",4,2,2
1,Adele F.,"Los Angeles, CA",280,232,1254,4.0,11/7/2018,"I stayed here for four nights last month for work. The good:- great Midtown location right across the library and Bryant Park.- super spacious rooms and bathrooms-hi-tech controls for everything in the room- modern, clean design - younger crowdThe bad:- non-traditional lobby sometimes meant no one there to help you. I got locked out of my room at 5am and no one was in the lobby to give me replacement keys (it took a while to find someone)- really weird layout for the building. The main entry looks like a side entry. My room on the 6th floor was so out of the way I thought I was in the wrong location.- no coffee machine in the room! - restaurant not that convenient in terms of time and access from within (one day, I had to go outside the hotel just to go to the restaurant)I would still stay there for business but if I had to pay those rates for a personal visit, I would probably stay somewhere downtown.",,,
2,Ashley C.,"Austin, TX",180,105,76,4.0,7/4/2018,"Make sure you go to the correct building! I initially walked into the event venue site instead of the actual hotel.I really liked my stay here! My room was gorgeous, I felt very comfortable, and every staff member I interacted with was always kind and willing to accommodate. I stayed for three days and two nights which ran to about $530 + $70 for alcohol in the room. WiFi is complimentary. My flight was later than my checkout time, so thankfully the hotel was willing to hold my bags for me (for free) after checkout so I could explore the city some more.This hotel is gorgeous! From the lobby to the elevators to the hallways, I was blown away by the decor. It is an entirely smoke-free property. There is a spa on-site that I did not get a chance to attend but next time - I will :)The rooms were not packed with much complimentary shampoo, conditioner, soap, and body lotion bottles so my friend called the front desk for more and they were quick to deliver them. We also requested ice since we did not find the ice machine, and it arrived within a few minutes.I was a little disappointed how far away this hotel was from Manhattan so if you want to be in the heart of the city, you should probably find a closer hotel. It was definitely quieter and less congested in this hotel/area than Midtown Manhattan though, so it all depends what you are looking for. I still woke up on multiple occasions from the noise but it was way quieter here than around Times Square. Also, if you know the public transportation routes well, it can take you 20-30 minutes to get to the city. The machine was not taking my card so I relied on walking and Lyfts which was generally exhausting!I'll probably come back if I want to explore the Financial District more and if I am around people who know the train/bus system well. Otherwise, I will probably check somewhere else out. Again, it really depends on what you are looking for :)",2,1,2
3,Jen G.,"Manhattan, NY",168,58,92,5.0,10/28/2018,Visited with my friend after leaving nearby Rosé Mansion. We were starving and had no reservation but were able to be seated quickly on a friday evening! The paella was soooo good and so were the apps and drink selection. I'll definitely be back!,,,
4,Victor L.,"Milwaukee, WI",303,74,18,1.0,5/13/2018,"I sent an e-mail to Andaz last weekend and they have not provided any acknowledgement.  Yelp might be the best way to get a response.  The obvious issue here is poor customer service or lack of customer respect...?I stayed at Andaz 5th Ave 5/5-5/6/2018.  I was sent an e-mail asking to rate my experience.  I thought it would be best if I mentioned a few issues with my room that could be improved for future patrons.  The room I stayed in was 919 (I believe).  I am a loyal Hyatt member and unfortunately my experience at Andaz was sub-par, especially for a 4 star hotel.  I didn't feel like I had the time or opportunity to bring up these issues in person (for reasons I will mention below).1) Broken shower handle (the handle would not stay in place despite how much I tightened it).  I had to shower standing in the corner touching the wall because that was the direction the shower head was pointing.2) Over-sized ""rain"" shower head was dirty/calcified.  For this reason the water coming out of the shower head was not down but side-ways.3) Dirty white walls with food/beverage stains- this is a big issue because of how minimalist the rooms are in the first place...4) Dirty curtains with coffee stains?  or something else?5) NO front desk service (I called multiple times over my 24 hour stay and nobody picked up!).  I had to physically walk to the front desk to ask a question.  It was for this specific reason that I didn't even want to bring up my concerns prior to my check out.  The lack of response by e-mail is another example of poor customer service.All these issues I have documented in photographs if you would like them. (edit: I'm gonna just post the photos)I think all these issues could have been prevented easily with a little bit of maintenance and attention to detail. I hope changes can be made in the future to provide a better experience for future patrons.",1,,1
5,Marie S.,"New York, NY",55,263,190,4.0,10/29/2018,"This review is just for the food - specifically the Lemon Soufflé Pancake with the orange poppy seed syrup - it was so good! I did not know that the Andaz was a foodie spot, I'm often disappointed by hotel food. But the chef here has created a masterpiece in the Lemon Soufflé Pancake paired with poppy seeds. The crunch mingled with citrus sweetness was truly unique and enjoyable. Topped with a bit of confectioners sugar - perfection! Will definitely try again!",,,
6,Patrick D.,"Rhinebeck, NY",15,57,30,5.0,10/8/2018,"Wonderful stay. Great lobby staff, excellent restaurant (and I never say that about hotels!) Nice room that was quiet. Great location too! And free minibar (excited booze!). Lousy to really average NYC hotels aren't cheap do it's worth the splurge for a big upgrade all around.",,,
7,Krista M.,"Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",2,19,14,5.0,8/13/2018,"We stayed here in May 2018, in a city view room. The room was very big compared to other rooms. I was nice, clean, and the beds were very comfortable. We had a beautiful view of the New York public library. The hotel is very close to Bryant park and a couple subway stops. We even walked to the Lyric hotel (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child) from here and took about 15-20 mins. Also, it's walking distance to grand central station and Times Square. Yes, it may be a little pricey, but Nrw York is pricey and in this case we were thrilled with what we got.",,,
8,Mark S.,"Merrick, NY",237,40,15,5.0,7/10/2018,"A fantastic property for midtown stays. Super location directly across the street from the NY Library only one block away from the 42nd Street-Bryant Park subway stop. You are right in the center of things yet the rooms were soundproofed enough that you do not hear the hustle of the city below. Andaz properties feature complimentary non alcoholic beverages and snacks in the room. The robes were super comfy and I'm always a fan of the Dream showers featured here. The tv does support streaming off your phone via Chromecast which you can connect to via the Hyatt app which was a really great feature. The room was spacious for NYC standards and the service was top notch. A very solid recommend for service, luxury and convenience",1,,
9,Brian F.,"Powder Springs, GA",123,127,261,5.0,1/3/2018,"I loved the posh feel of this hotel. ""Boutique"" as they call it now.  Upon arrival we didn't really know how to approach is hotel as there is no area to drive into as with every other hotel in the world!  Wifey jumps out and goes inside to get info and the door guy comes out to get luggage and take the car. This is all while we are parked in and unloading zone about 2 spaces long. Don't stay there too long or you will be getting a ticket! You will pay a price for this level of Boutique!  We spent $100 bucks+ on breakfast alone and we didn't get up with full bellies either. [where is the Cracker Barrel in NY]The rooms are spacious for a NY style hotel and we had our daughters with us in one room. They efficiently comped us a roll away bed and we were fine. The shower and bathroom set up was all worth the price of admission. Rain Shower?!!!   All in all I would stay again. The location is optimal for a close to everything weekend and if you have a few extra nickels or quarters it is an enjoyable experience.",2,,2
10,Joy D.,"Washington, DC",231,200,275,5.0,11/28/2017,"We stay at Hyatt property as often as possible when traveling, because they have been very good to us over the years. Andaz is always a preferred option due to the boutique hotel concept. This Andaz is probably my favorite hotel in the city. Love the location, close enough to Broadway to catch a show or two, minus the hectic crowds, noise and traffic. It's also close to lots of restaurants that we frequent when in town.The rooms are spacious for NYC. Service is impeccable. There's complementary wine hour, though we often miss it, but it's good to know it's available. One very minor thing I'd like to point out is the bathroom, spacious but slightly dark. For ladies who wear makeup, it might be a better idea to spread your makeup at the lounge chaise and do the makeup there for better lighting :) This is definitely the place to be when in the city without paying 4 digits/night, especially during a rainy visit when it's the best to cozy up in the room and chill, and looking out at the large windows of the room and waiting for the sun to come out.",2,,5
11,Robin K.,"Queens, NY",342,394,499,3.0,4/15/2018,I visited my friend at her hotel and I was starving so I asked to get some room service for some mashed potatoes. I'm not sure if I was salt-deprived that day? But I definitely sprinkled a handful of salt all over it so that I could taste the potatoes. Smooth mashed potatoes! I also enjoyed that the elevators were safe so that strangers like myself can't just help myself up to the rooms. She had to come down and get me! And some nice seating. I had one issue with the room. There was a shelf or bookshelf or stand of some sort made of glass and it was SO clean that I kept bumping into it. I did not see that it was a piece of glass there.,1,1,1
12,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3836,3381,93,4.0,8/22/2017,"I spent a week in New York this month, splitting my time between the Andaz 5th Avenue, where I stayed with my mom, and Le Parker Meridien, where I got put up for work. I come to New York fairly often, but this was my first trip in years staying in hotels instead of with friends, most of whom live pretty far from midtown Manhattan. As much as I love crashing with friends, this was kind of nice.The Andaz is very centrally located, at 41st and 5th, right by Bryant Park and the New York Public Library. The area was vibrant, and it was easy to get around. A definite plus for a hotel in New York. My mom and I are among that last set of die-hard psychos still playing Pokemon Go, and this was prime Pokemon hunting territory.Another of my mom's obsessions (I obviously inherited this gene, hence my 3,000 Yelp reviews) is with hotel/travel points, and we got a room for cheap, which then got upgraded to a suite thanks to her baller Hyatt status. It was a nice suite, with a sizable bedroom and bathroom and a full-on living room with a view of the city. The bed was comfortable, and the shower pressure on point. The only weird thing was that the bathroom opened onto both the living room and the bedroom, so that unless you kept all the sliding doors closed, you could see the toilet from like every part of the suite. I don't know much about feng shui, but seemed less than ideal.I had a pleasant stay at this hotel. I have enough places to crash in New York that I'm unlikely to come on my own dime, but I was happy to ride on my mom's Hyatt elite coattails. The Andaz was a convenient base for a week spent running around the city.",3,6,2
13,Dave C.,"Ardmore, PA",275,155,71,5.0,7/9/2017,"A wonderful stay at Andaz 5th Avenue across from the New York Public Library. Possibly one of my favorite hotels I've ever stayed at.We arrived at 10 am and was able to check in right away without hesitation. There was complimentary coffee and NYT which I loved/needed as I had gone without my morning coffee upon my departure from Philly.There's also complimentary wine happy hour in the lobby. Fantastic as we all know that drinking in NYC is not cheap by any means.The rooms: The TVs in the room are large with wonderful picture quality. They also have chromecast which is an awesome an unexpected addition. Beds are comfortable and room temperature control is simple. There are also automatic blinds that come down so you're not disturbed upon sunrise.With the location so central, incredible service and friendliness, Andaz is my hotel of choice in NYC.",3,,1
14,Taiyyab Z.,"Fort Lee, NJ",1935,377,5944,5.0,3/29/2017,"Fantastic time homeys :). This hotel has it at all. Great location, huge rooms, modern decor( I mean the got glass closets, never seen that before), great service, rooms had high end tech(maybe its average now) and priced fairly well. We gotten two suites and a regular double bed room( ones to sleep on) lol jk.Located in the heart of the city you aren't far from anything when here. You got good dining, night life, the NYC public library, and shopping all with in less a minute walk from the hotel :)The suites were big enough to have 15 people in it and it still not feel too cramped.The style still surprised because for the price of these rooms I would have thought Id get half of what I got. Plus we had a balcony...I mean come on you know that's the best part of being in the city. Taking in that energy and that vibe. The Bathrooms were amazing. The high ceilings, the mirrors, gosh I think staying at this hotel gave me ideas for what I wanna design my place like one day...ONE DAY :)The Tech part was great...had all the buttons control the curtains and lighting.We used the hotel as our base for my friends Bday party and it definitely served the purpose.I would definitely come back :)Enjoy the pics and Videos !",40,26,36
15,Joanna A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1426,286,861,3.0,4/1/2017,"The day that I arrived things felt unorganized. It took us FOREVER to get checked in. But while waiting one of the workers offered us beverages. The room itself was gorgeous. The couch however was badly stained. The bath tub was great. I was able to take a hot bath and look out the window :) loved the little amenities they provided (bottles of water, popcorn, chocolates) Room service was fast and prompt. There was no breakfast menu in our room so the guy over the phone read me every item they had through the phone. Avocado toast was great (didn't skimp on the avocados!!) Gym was small and horrendous. Felt like I was working out in a dungeon. Overall the hotel was decent. It was a great location (5th avenue) overlooking the public library.",7,4,3
16,Ashley F.,"Massapequa, NY",0,6,0,5.0,3/26/2018,"This hotel was absolutely perfect!!! The room was beautiful and clean,  and was overlooking the New York Library. The location of the hotel is perfect, as it is so close to Bryant Park. Did I mention that the hotel has free wine 6-8? A choice between white and red!! Anderson at the front desk was amazing!! He was very professional and pleasant. He was extremely knowledgeable to what was nearby and gave great recommendation of where to eat.I can't wait to return to this beautiful property!!!!",2,,
17,Tracy L.,"San Ramon, CA",202,855,278,5.0,4/21/2016,"We stayed here for a few nights and loved it!The location of this Andaz is perfect.  It's right across from the New York Public Library and Bryant Park.  Since it's right on 5th Avenue, there is also an abundance of shopping in almost every direction.  Bryant Park is on the other side of the library and it is nice to stroll through it.The hotel is located about one block up from Grand Central Station, so no matter which airport you fly into, it is easily accessible without additional transportation once you get to Grand Central.  We flew into Newark and took the Newark Express Shuttle, which can drop you off (or pick you up) at Grand Central Station or (even closer) at 42nd and 5th Ave.  We walked easily to Time Square, and if you are up for the exercise, Central Park is about a 30 minute walk away.  The hotel is also located close to several different metro lines - I asked the front desk for help on metro lines our first day there.Although we missed it each night due to plans, the free wine hours in the evening would normally be where you can find us!  You also get complimentary bottled water or sparkling water anytime.  The staff was very friendly and helpful as well.  We were in NYC for our anniversary, and the hotel staff left is Prosecco and macaroons for the occasion.  Our room was nice - clean and with a more masculine decor.  Our room is what you would call a ""city view"" (the back side of the hotel), but we were fine with it.  It is a good size and comfortable.  One of our sinks leaked to the ground and left a puddle (that did not get in our way), but other than everything was in excellent condition.  We loved it here - the service, room/hotel quality and location were great.  When we come back to Manhattan, we plan to book here again!",4,1,2
18,Carlos A.,"Los Angeles, CA",1409,1628,1739,4.0,3/22/2016,"Pros:  Mini bar is free with non alcoholic drinks. Very comfortable mattressNext to public library, grand central and Bryant ParkRoom service is very quickFree Wi-FiHigh ceilings in roomsViews of the Time Square ballCons:  Too modern for its own good. The closet is this glass thing that doesn't fit that much clothes. The shower has no glass door so it is hard to keep it warm as heat escaped. There are sharp edges in the shower. Not Quiet - if noise bothers you, I suggest not getting a room facing the public library. The views are great but it is a noisy street",4,,
19,Parham N.,"Santa Monica, CA",320,137,10,5.0,9/18/2017,"Exceptional Hotel Stay. The staff went above and beyond to take care of me and my GF for our anniversary. Our room was next level with a bath tub and a living room area so my GF can have all of her make up and outfits out without being in my, there was coffee ready in the AM, waters to grab as we pleased, wine hour from 6-8 to start the evenings off right, and really the staff made us feel loved which no amenities can replace. In terms of the location, I think its honestly perfect for a visitor who needs access to the entire city. It is in a noisier part of the city so that should be noted for a lower floor room. Also, if you are hanging mostly in East Village, Soho and Chelsea - it is quite easy to access by train. Although some people may want to be able to just walk from their hotel which this location does not do. I was more than happy that we chose this hotel and would 100% stay here again.",,,
20,Nicolette F.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,35,76,5.0,1/2/2016,"The amount of hotels in NYC is overwhelming. There is one on every street! How do you choose?Let me say, I am as picky about where I stay as I am about where I eat. I spent a week looking through hotels in the city and the Andaz kept peaking my attention, like no other, amongst countless other choices.From the website itself, and countless other websites, (Google the hotel, every website has great reviews) and the conde nast top list of hotels in NYC for 2015, I made a very solid choice that this was the hotel for me. One Night, a little getaway, and definitely the best decision I made!!! This was one of the favorite hotels I've stayed in and I'm going to tell you why!To begin, when I called to make the reservation, the gentleman on the phone was helpful , and exceptionally pleasant. The reservations were made same day of stay, quick and easy. Got to the hotel early, as check in time is 3 pm, it was 1pm, and I wanted to get settled in so I could start my night. NO problem at all! Check in receptionist was so happy to help and because it was a first time stay did her best to get a great room with a great view, and boy did she ever! She then told her associate that she would be right back and walked me up to the room personally to give me a tour. Went up to our 9th floor room, when the door opened, so did my mouth! I was in awe of how cool the room was. It was like walking into a James Bond Movie. The room had a Very Modern, Masculine, and Sexy vibe to it. So clean, The floors are a light wood and the closets lining the entryway are all see through glass. They provide robes and slippers, fridge stocked with Complimentary sodas, waters, and snacks. I looked straight ahead as we walked further into the room, the view that she was able to give us, was Spectacular! We were directly in front of and overlooking the NY Public Library Building which is a beautiful landmark in the midtown area. It has such an old New York feel,   looking at it was an extension to the vibe of the room itself! She then explained how everything in the room worked which is something I have never seen in another hotel. All the controls to the room (lights, temperature, window shades, radio) are all on a touchpad next to your bed and throughout the room. It was Incredible! As far as décor goes, the sleeping area itself is minimalistic, sharp, and so clean feeling. No pictures on the walls but between the entrance, view, and Bathroom area, you don't need a thing else to make it feel  relaxing and so cozy. I'm also funny with hotel beds.Most hotels claim to be superior,  then you lay down and by the time you wake up your back feels like a horse kicked it . Or even worse they give you a sheet, call it a blanket, and your freezing all night. The bed here was the perfect comfort, woke up feeling great and blanket was so soft and warm (I need one for my home!). But of all things, The BATHROOM is the BEST part of the room. And was actually a deciding factor in the choosing of this hotel. There are not many hotels in NYC that offer bathrooms this big, or they don't pay much detail to them, its just kind of there. Andaz is one of the only hotels in NYC (I did my research) that put a lot of the focus of there rooms into the bathroom and that offer such a huge and amazing shower. It is also mostly glass in the bathroom, double his/her sink, and a very large shower with a stone bench, and a overhead water rainfall showerhead. You feel like you are in a very upscale spa.  I have never experienced a better hotel shower!The room was amazing and chic. The service and care from the staff was exceptional. Very accommodating, detail oriented, and aiming to please. And everyday they offer a complimentary wine hour 6pm-7pm in the lounge. I don't believe to many hotels in NYC offer this kind of customer service! Thoroughly enjoyed my experience and will definitely be staying again!",2,,1
21,Laura B.,"Lindenhurst, NY",0,35,1,1.0,4/16/2017,"WARNING: DO NOT book a suite at this hotel if you want a guaranteed room with a guaranteed check in time! If a lifetime Hyatt/Andaz VIP guest is in the suite you are expected to stay in they will NOT force the guest to vacate the room! Check out 4pm, but VIPs are entitled to ask for late check out which this person did not, just left belongings behind & walked off, no notification of when his check out would be?!!!!!I requested an early check in? Andaz was not honest in saying not only would there be no early check in, the room was not ready until 7pm!!! The manager I spoke with would only say sorry but there is a VIP lifetime member in the suite! Hyatt/Andaz should decide if this is a building of apartments only wealthy VIPs are entitled to or a hotel!! I am a paying guest with a reservation!! Also, I made the reservation for the Splash suite, the reservation was changed to a standard room with an upgrade without my knowledge or consent??For the horrible way I was treated, I was given a $100 credit?!! WHAT AN INSULT!!! I WAITED IN THE CITY FROM 10AM - 7PM TO GET A ROOM!!! I asked for early check in!!! I was treated like I am nothing unless I am a VIP!!

22,Janet W.,"Playa del Rey, CA",299,52,23,1.0,7/25/2016,"So sad to do do this. We flew in from London. Husband's 70th birthday. As a member of their rewards program at a big level (hubby stays in Beijing Hyatt about once per month for at least ten years). We recently booked a big top corner suite in their Kaua'i property earlier this year. Anyway, he had wanted to surprise me with a loft suite with a balcony where we could enjoy his birthday. We arrived from the UK (although we live in LA) as scheduled, only to find that they were not going to honor our reservation as they had sold It to someone else!!!! We were given a little one room box and were told there was no manager he could speak to. Instead of enjoying our evening and a special birthday in our favorite city, he spent the entire time ranting and unhappy. There has been zero follow up from management. I will be helping him find a new place in Beijing after this.",9,2,
23,Rachel Z.,"San Francisco, CA",627,248,1912,3.0,6/13/2016,"Room: 3Amenity: 3Location: 5 Staff: 4Pros:- Friendly staff: upon checking in, the reception asked if we wanted anything to drink and came back with coffee. A very personal and warm welcome. - Free snacks: anything that's non alcoholic was free from mini bar. - Location: a perfect balance of convenience and peacefulness. Right next to the lovely Bryant park and New York public library, it's one of the nicest part of mid town one can hope for. Cons:- Impractical design:Unique design might be a theme of Andaz hotels, but each with various degrees of success. The artistic decoration and great details from Andaz Tokyo was amazing, which made me set unrealistic expectations for Andaz London and New York. Sadly they both turned out to be very underwhelming. The lobby is small and confusing. There's only an island in the middle, and a guy in uniform who was working on his laptop. He turned out to be the lovely receptionist and explained how things were unconventional here. Indeed! It was great when we were the only guests checking in, but chaos appears when there are several parties waiting to be helped. After the lobby, we have to take the elevator to the 2nd floor then walk a long corridor to take another elevator and then get to our room. The room has a photogenic yet hugely impractical washing area. I'm calling it an area because it consist a sink, a shower cube and a closed water closet, but no door at all. There's water everywhere after showering due to the lack of doors, and this no door policy makes quite hard to relax. There's a serious lack of storage space. No drawers, the ""closet"" has a complicated structure but actually the vertical space is only tall enough for hanging tops, and your jacket/dress would have to sadly drape over some glass surface. Why! The rest of the room looks inconsistently plain.- Dated amenity:The faucet was leaky, the TV was small, and the furniture looks dated. The elevators were very small as well. - CleanlinessThis is the biggest the reason that makes me not want to stay here again. The elevator floor was dirty, and the floor in common area was a bit sticky on both days we stayed there. I noticed some unknown small item stuck on the wall of the water closet and a small, faded stain on the bed sheet, neither was encouraging signs about the housekeeping. The trays from room service outside of a room on my floor have been sitting there for more than 20 hours... All of the cons might seem like small issues, but for a room that costs close to $500 a night I expected a bit more.",5,1,1
24,Niti B.,"Chicago, IL",324,679,172,3.0,7/7/2016,I read the reviews prior to arriving and was so glad I did so!I was fairly warned that the bathroom was modern but dysfunctional with wet floors and dim lighting it was hard to get ready in a zen mode.  I have to also say that it sucks not to have a door seperating the toilet and remainder of the bathroom.  There was no sense of containment of heat in the bathroom either.  And to make things akward there was a framed photograph of two gentlemen that made no sense.The tapping master light switches were a bit frustrating and the glass closet was not very functional as well.The room was spacious since we were upgraded as a complimentary first time visitors and the wing we were on was very quiet.  We had a view of the street but didn't mind since we weren't spending much time in the room.Our hotel host for happy hour wine from 6-8pm was very pleseant.  We chatted a bit with other patrons prior to heading out for the evening.  They also had complimentary coffee in the morning in the lobby since there wasn't any in the room.  I did appreciate the room having free non-alcoholic beverages and snacks to nibble on as we held ourselves over for dinner.Overall a very central location.  With Bryant Park and the NYC library footsteps away as well as shopping and Central Park under your fingertips I would recommend considering staying here with all the warnings well known.,2,,2

The only down side is allllll the noise you can hear on library 5th and 41st. We were woken up every morning very early and we are from Los Angeles so that meant whatever time we were woken up it was 3 hours earlier in our city. We didn't get much sleep and were very tired.,,,
29,Jerry C.,"Atlanta, GA",146,446,195,4.0,12/21/2015,"The Andaz on 5th is an...interesting hotel.It's owned by Hyatt but designed/decorated like a boutique hotel, and it's really impressive how a hotel chain is able to create a space that feels so intimate and trendy.Centrally located in Midtown across from the NY Public Library (FYI: the entrance is technically on 41st), the amenities are fantastic - free non-alcoholic beverages (including bottled water) and snacks replenished daily, bathrobes, slippers, toiletries, and free wifi, too. No pool or spa on-site.Onto the room itself: my family was placed in the North Tower, separate from the main lobby/rooms - our stay was nice and quiet, away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the hotel, but because of its seclusion, our room was just SO far away from the entrance. Definition of a first world problem. These rooms are bigger and have taller ceilings, though, from what I was told.An even bigger first world problem: you can see the toilet when you walk into the bathroom. There's no door or anything blocking you from the rest of the bathroom - there is a little partition that sticks out, but you could definitely see someone sitting on the toilet.Therefore, if someone had to go #2, nobody could shower or, at the minimum, use the sink, unless you're REAL comfortable with each other. If I were with a long-term significant other, it'd be OK, but A) I'm single, and B) I was with my mom and sister. So...I'm happy that I was able to redeem 4 free nights at the Andaz (you into churning?), but I probably would NEVER pay the standard rate ($500+ per night over a December weekend; closer to $250-300 in ""off season,"" which is more reasonable) - if I'm not mistaken, the only NYC Hyatt more expensive than this one is the Park Hyatt.Still, the Andaz on 5th is a fantastic hotel - definitely geared towards couples, though.",3,3,2

31,Kristine D.,"Boston, MA",6,60,63,5.0,9/17/2017,"My first time staying at an Andaz hotel. We have stayed in a variety of hotels around the country/world and we had one of the best experiences at this hotel. The service was beyond excellent. We checked in and the complementary wine happy hour had just passed, but they were gracious enough to give us a glass anyway. The room itself is large and clean and pretty spacious for NYC standards. The style and decor was pretty unique and full of character. When we checked out, were even were given a small parting gift -  I chose an NYC magnet. Though a small gesture, I found it to be kind and meaningful. We look forward to staying here again !",,,
32,Ken H.,"La Palma, CA",467,732,818,5.0,9/18/2015,"Having stayed at several Hyatt properties in NYC. I am confident to say this is my favorite Hyatt property in town. Hotel location is unbeatable. Walking distance to tourist sites and local attractions. Subway nearby, there are transit options to JFK as well (shuttle bus). Many dining options nearby as well but onsite dining are equally delicious.Was staying at one of their splash suite and truly enjoyed. Room layout is bright, airy and inviting. Very, very comfortable bedding and fluffy (yes VERY fluffy) towels, makes me wonder if they are brand new. I had good night sleep there. I also loved the hotel design as I am always a fan of Tony Chi design and I am glad that the hotel kept in a good condition. However, I was let down by the quality of toiletries. I believe they should use more upscale products to match the overall image of this hotel.Friendly service all over but in the morning both front desk and restaurant can be chaotic. Despite the minor hiccups, it is still by far my favorite hotel in town.",5,4,7

Done.In all seriousness, the staff at Andaz made sure my significant other and I had a wonderful experience. I let them know it was a special occasion, and they upgraded us (granted, I don't think it was super busy that random weekday), brought chocolate strawberries and wine, invited us to the wine happy hour event in the lobby, and were just awesome all around.The actual room was a deluxe king, and was VERY nice. Spacious, clean, very modern, styled in a very cool way. Loved the massive rainfall showerhead and the complimentary snacks and drinks as well. Our room was relatively quiet for being on the 4th floor, though if you're expecting to hear a pin drop in Manhattan, you're delusional. I don't know that I have any gripes at all about Andaz, and would easily stay here again on a future NYC visit.",,,

36,Corey L.,"Gainesville, FL",171,95,219,3.0,2/19/2016,"I struggled between giving this 3 or 4 stars, I wish I could do 3.5 stars. I really enjoyed my stay at the Andaz. I come to NYC a few times a year for work and in the past I've stayed at the Algonquin hotel. This hotel is very centrally located for Manhattan so you can get around with ease. Walking in is a little funky because there's not a giant front desk area, there's a little circular table in the middle of the room with a few iPads, that's the reception area. I do think they should do a little more because if it's crowded then you'd have no idea it was there. Rooms are beautiful and state of the art! For someone who's used to traveling in NY and Chicago I don't usually expect a large room because that's just not always an option. These rooms are huge for the city! And have a massive floor to ceiling window! There's control pads throughout the room but also by the bed so you can actually control most of the lighting, the temperature, shade for the window, etc all from your bed (I need that in my house now)! Aside from the booze everything in the mini bar is free and they will restock it, just let them know. And for NYC standards FYI, the mini bar booze is really well priced...and they have Tito's...SCORE!!! The mini bar and closet are see through glass and very striking to look at. The bathroom...wow...love the slate tile in the bathroom and the shower is ginormous with a waterfall nozzle, handheld sprayer and stool with foot bath in the shower so you can fit a few people comfortably in the shower, we tested the theory. Get your mind out of the gutter, I work for a shampoo company and it was National Shower With A Friend Day so we took a spoof pic fully clothed with about 6 of us in the shower. The counters were double sinks with a glass counter...again, very striking to look at! There's also a desk in the room so you can get some work done. Our conference room was very nice and looked straight onto The New York Public Library Building aka the building from The Ghostbusters (FUN)! The catered hotel food on the 2nd floor (separate from the 1st floor restaurant) was healthy and delicious! There's a restaurant in the hotel which did not have the best service but the food was good and the cafe cappuccinos were ON POINT!!! There's also a bar downstairs called The Cellar that has bites and a fun dark, almost prohibition era feel to it. If it's Thursday or later in the week try and get there early to grab a table because it is first come, first serve. They will take your name and call you though. They also have free wine in the evenings in the hotel lobby by the computer/business area. All and all the stay was really good, the knockoff on stars was really due to the service in the restaurant on the 1st floor. And I was there different times during non-busy and busy times, either way the service was not great. I will definitely stay here again though! I'm looking forward to my next trip back.",5,4,3

40,Antaash U.,"Chicago, IL",128,404,68,2.0,1/21/2015,"When I travel, I want to feel pampered, a little like royalty and far removed from my regular life in Chicago.  So, when we booked a room at the Andaz, I was excited to try a new chain, and one that seemingly had quite a large fan base.  I never thought I was a sucker for traditional until my stay at the Andaz.  For starters, when you walk into the lobby, there is no check-in/out counter.  Instead it's a big square desk where the staff have ipads and laptops.  It can be awkward standing in the middle with your luggage while people are walking in and out because of the close proximity to the elevator.  I did appreciate that the room was bigger than a tuna can, but didn't care for the master switch panel that controlled the lights in the room.  I also didn't care for how the shower (i hate when the water sprays everywhere) and toilet stall didn't have doors.  Also, the door to the bathroom in general was more decorative than functional.  Though I share a lot with my husband, there are some things that are meant to be private.  The shower, without a door was also annoying because it was really hard to get the temperature to what I wanted.  In an attempt to be modern and advanced, they really took the fun out of some simple pleasures.Our view, if you can all it that was also fugly.  We had the pleasure of staring at a brick building.  Nice.The hotel did provide complimentary snacks in the room, which were replenished each day.  There is complimentary coffee and cookies in the morning and wine in the evenings.  We worked with Israel M. who booked tickets to a concert and play for us.  Made great recommendations for dinner for us and in general was really, really, really helpful.  He was the only part of my stay that I liked.Finally, most hotels will graciously not charge you for a night due to flight cancellations.  Not the Andaz.  Though we called the hotel prior to arrival and notified them of what had happened, not once did they mention that the charge would still apply.  We had the pleasure of sticker shock upon departure.  They claimed that because they allowed us early check-in, they were sorry to report that they were unable to take off the charge.  Oh, by early check-in, it was a whopping 2.5hrs early.  This is something I will likely remember for a long time and share with my friends who may consider staying at the Andaz.",4,4,

She often checked on me and filled my water cup but never pressured me. I was so grateful for her. On to the food, it was delicious! I ordered the salmon entree.

There were some delays in the beginning with items that we had asked to be setup before our arrival, but the friendliness and quickness of the staff and resolving issues more than made up for delays. We were asking for an early check in and they tried their best to accommodate.  We stayed in the Splash Suite and my daughter loved the bathtub.

The space is very unique and the large glass windows face the NYPL which is beautifully lit up at night to wow guests. The food is incredible!! There are so many choices and the layout is an 'open kitchen' type of feel where everything is freshly made and beautifully presented and served to guests. The bar downstairs at Andaz is also a great little spot for drinks and apps. Try the empanadas! It is dark down there but a large area with so many different seating options.

What I wasn't so impressed with was the portion of the food. I guess I shouldn't have expected too much from a hotel restaurant...still I was disappointed. We had the grilled octopus dish that was only 4 pieces for $19. I think there are better places out there honestly.

50,Danny K.,"Valencia, Valencia, CA",93,1,0,2.0,1/12/2018,I was here from 1/5/2018 to 1/9/2018. The stay here was great and the room and customer service was wonderful during my stay. I tried to call back because they charged me for 2 extra days.  I was talking to the representative for a few minutes and he tells me he has to get a manager that can help me. I was on hold for a couple minutes and he comes back and tells me there is no manager there that can help me. At this moment I have been talking to this person and on hold for a total of 20 minutes. He tells me that there is nothing he can do and needs to get a manager and they are currently not in. I understand because it was 10 pm for me but it was at 1 am in the morning 1/13/2017 local time in NY so a manager not available is understandable. I asked this person if they can take my number down and have a manager call me when he or she gets in.  This is when he suddenly hung up on me. Then I tried to call back over 5 times and he wouldn't answer the phone.  I was very frustrated and disappointed that this person wouldn't simply write down my number and didn't bother to answer the phone after he hung up on me. I've been loyal to hyatt and currently have an Exporist level but maybe this year I will choose another hotel company to rack up my stays.,,,

Our intent was to go to the bar downstairs, but unfortunately a pipe had burst during the cold blast and they had to make emergency repairs. With the downstairs bar closed, they started running a satellite bar on the main restaurant floor off to the side towards the hotel elevators. The bartender was extremely skillful and even gave solid advice as to what cocktail bars were the best in the immediate area. He made my brother a gin martini, and I had a Manhattan with rye whiskey. It was nasty good. Very smooth, and hit the spot. We ordered a few small bites. I ordered the country bread and it came with pears, and a delicious glaze. The bread melted in my mouth. It was like I was in appetizer heaven for a brief moment when I took the first bite. I didn't get to truly experience all that Andaz has to offer, but I know it only gets better from here.

I think her name was like Anna or Belle or something like that. I just remember she had really nice eyebrows. It is located right by the NY library which was our view from our window of our hotel room. The room that we were checked in was beautifully designed with modern decor and furniture. I wish I took it home with me. I also want to compliment on the cleanliness of the room! You can tell the housekeepers really pay close attention to detail.

58,Jenn S.,"Point Lookout, NY",524,755,1299,1.0,9/18/2013,"This review is for the private events/catering, I have not stayed at the hotel itself.I've been in the event planning industry for over 10+ years and know that if you have a very good client who would like to have a long standing relationship with you and/or your establishment, it means the WORLD to your business and the reputation of your business.  And said client is more likely to recommend your business to everyone they know and such.With that said, Andaz has a ridiculous policy for their meeting room space and  they chooses to play a numbers game of how how much they can make vs. keeping great customer retention.  I have a client who had an event there last year and had a fantastic experience so they wanted to continue business with them this year and several years going forward.  Needed a Thursday date in early Dec and I was told that they needed to make a certain quota for that day and that if we aren't booking hotel rooms with the meeting rooms I'd have to wait 45 days in order to reserve the space.  Repeatedly I said this is not a new client but a client that they have done business with just last year can't they make an exception?  I was met with a firm no.  Stupid move on their part.It's a shame because business practices like that in NYC will get you no where fast.  Utterly disappointed.  Thank God for variety in this town and for companies that actually understand customer service and loyalty. I'd give them no stars if Yelp allowed it!",4,1,1
59,Colleen C.,"Chicago, IL",4317,2770,2704,5.0,7/3/2013,"Well ain't this a big ol' slice of New York City heaven? We are Hyatt loyalists, as my husband basically lived in one in Des Moines for many, many weeks. This is probably the only reward out of that situation, so we take full advantage of it. Diamond upgrades, for me! By no means is this a budget hotel whatsoever. On this particular trip we booked a regular room and used an upgrade. So for $400/night we stayed in an amazing suite that would normally be more like $1000 - $1500/night. This is the only way I can justify paying $400 for anything -- at least it better feel like a real, real value. Like I said, pays to be diamond. The Andaz is the Hyatt version of the W. It's trendy, there are ipads to check-in, there are smartly dressed women with red lipstick that serve as the bell(wo)men. It's hip. All of that is present here, of course. We had no issues with check-in or check-out (and we did both at this hotel, twice -- long story), all the staff friendly. Wine and coffee available upon request and even a little goodie upon checkout. They've mastered ""the little things."" The splash suite is pretty deluxe, as the name would suggest. It has a huge soaking tub in the middle of the room, floor to ceiling windows where you can soak in privacy whilst looking out over the NYC Public Library. The room is sharp, clean and modern. Bed comfy. Not a complaint, and Hyatt goes the extra mile with free snacks and non-alkie items from the mini-bar. They don't chintz either -- sea salt chips, chocolates, energy bar. It's not some crap from a vending machine. Again, great at the little things. Location: perfect to public transit, shopping, Central Park, etc. Couldn't ask for a better one. Gym on site (didn't use it). Papers available -- nothing like reading the NY Times with breakfast -- in New York. Room service: Ungodly overpriced. If you are just looking for a quick snack or breakfast to tide you over and don't want to drop $100 -- try Cafe 42 just around the corner on 42nd street, open 24 hours with great options. NYC is the land of convenience, no need to go overboard on room service unless you really want it. Protips: *Become a regular at Hyatt and reap the rewards. Seriously. *Free wifi for Hyatt members. *Arriving/Departing from Newark (EWR)? The Newark Express runs directly from 42nd Street/5th Ave (steps from the entrance) to Newark for $16/pp or $28/rt. A cab is literally $100 and the Newark Express ride MUCH more comfortable, with AC and a large coach bus. Review to follow!",12,4,10

I liked how the place ha multiple counters across the apartment area so that people could put down their food and drinks while they chat.

61,Aimee R.,"Danville, CA",163,333,99,5.0,10/25/2013,"Great location! I love the fact that it's only a short walk to many sites such as the hustle and bustle of Times Square, a block from Bryant Park, few blocks from Grand Central station and a few blocks away from the Empire State Building. There is a really close subway entrance at Bryant Park if you plan on using the subway as your main form of transportation. The hotel was modern and very clean. All of the hotel staff was friendly. My husband and I stayed in the room listed as a Loft but not the XL Loft. The orientation of the furniture in the room definitely made it feel more spacious. Since we had a partition wall which was shared between the bedroom and the sitting area it made the room feel that much more bigger because of the sectioned spaces and high ceilings. The bathroom was really clean and modern. The huge shower was definitely a plus!Another great detail that the Andaz provides their guests with is a refillable/free mini bar. All of the non alcoholic beverages and snacks are replaced each day! It's great to not have to look for a place to purchase bottled water. One thing that my husband and I noticed was that no matter what time of the night that we would end up strolling in, the streets around the Andaz were lit up and never felt unsafe. Of course definitely use your judgement when traveling, but we never ran into any situations where we felt uncomfortable in the surrounding streets around the hotel. We definitely will stay at the Andaz again when we come back to New York!",2,,1
62,Holly E.,"Dallas, TX",41,113,137,5.0,8/17/2013,"The Andaz on Fifth Avenue is the best hotel period.You can easily miss the hotel if you're walking down Fifth Avenue, and that's what is so great about it.  Its a hidden gem right in the middle of it all.  The ambiance is non-pretentious and the staff gives the best service.  Ramon and Joe make the place feel like home and Martha in The Shop is always a welcome face.The rooms have high ceilings and give you a really roomy feel which can be hard to find in Manhattan.  The rooms have a Nespresso machine, coffee pods, a bite of chocolate, and unlimited waters and sodas.  In the lounge in the evening you can get complimentary wine and in the morning you can get complimentary coffee and fruit.The showers are large with a rain showerhead or handheld and a foot faucet as well.  The linens and bedding are comfortable and everything has a light wood, tan, and white color so its very airy and light in the rooms.  I appreciate the automatic blinds and a view of The Public Library is cool.Centrally located, you can get anywhere quickly.  Next to Bryant Park, a few blocks from Times Square, and a few blocks from Grand Central, you can get any subway fairly quickly.  The staff treats everyone well, whether you are a celebrity or not (and lots of celebrities stay here).  Its a wonderful home away from home!The Shop has delicious food - the muesli and fresh squeezed juices are amazing and the oatmeal is one of the best.",3,,1

65,Laurie I.,"Cornelius, NC",44,789,122,3.0,8/10/2015,"Beautiful hotel. Stayed here for a wedding. Loved everything except the reservation staff when making my reservation. I own a travel agency and they first gave me a super high priced rate. The night before I called because there was an online rate for about half the cost and then had a rate guarantee . I got a AAA rate and then tried to hold it under my agency, they would not let me. The manger write to me several weeks later to tell me they paid commission to AAA. I almost laughed out loud, they don't pay AAA commission if your only getting the rate and as an agency owner, I still get commission on those rates. I just don't like being lied to and at 350.00 a night, they don't need to be cheap to those who keep them full with guests. I will put my clients two blocks away  for now on. They do serve free wine during several hours but I never got to experience this. Nice idea though",,,

The bathrooms are fantastic (yes, they have carry the good toilet paper ) It is also a hotel so that is why this place is fabulous !! A good choice for casual meeting with friends or even to meet with work colleagues. There is a waiting period (about 20 minutes) during the lunch rush hour to get a table. This place seems like it would a lot of fun at night, I would definitely come back, maybe with reservations just to be on safe side.",,,1

70,Boris G.,"Danville, CA",62,541,0,4.0,1/20/2015,"Visited in mid-December for an extended weekend stay using Hyatt points+cash.  Overall I would say the stay was enjoyable. Certainly this is one of the largest and most luxurious rooms I've ever seen in NYC (or any city). However if I was paying normal rates I would probably stay elsewhere - the value just isn't here. Here's how it went down: Check-in was fast. Personally I prefer a counter rather than being in the center of the small lobby, but no big deal. We were greeted promptly and offered a glass of wine (complimentary in the lobby from 6-8pm - nice touch). SOP is for the desk clerk to take you to the room, another nice touch. As expected we received the splash suite on the 4th floor. I asked about the street noise as the suite faces Fifth but we were told that there were only 8 splash suites (one on each floor) - basically stacked in the same location. So we decided to keep it rather than risk a downgrade.On the plus side these rooms are quite large - massive by NYC standards. Though it was only 2 of us it could easily have fit a family of 4+ Great views of Empire State and Library, if that's your thing (personally I'd prefer Central Park, but definitely better than facing some ugly edifice). Bathroom was large with a lot of counter space. Complimentary water and soft drinks in frig  - I wish every hotel did this so I didn't have to go out and stock up. Internet connection was generally good though facetime calls dropped in the bedroom. Nice comfy sofa. Minus side - the shower controls were designed by a moron - took me a few minutes to figure out how to operate, and still had difficulty getting the right temp every day. Why they can't use a standard control is beyond me. Also there is no door to the toilet  and very little privacy provided by the swinging doors. Not good for 2 people, much worse if you had more. Much as I hate the standard HR bathrooms, I'd much prefer a normal one to this. In terms of sleep the bed was pretty firm, a plus for me. The pillows were too soft - for some reason nobody offers hard foam or better yet temperpedic. To my surprise I found that the street noise was not troublesome after midnight, but don't plan to sleep in late on a weekday. And then there are the occasional sirens as Fifth Av is a major artery for emergency services. The bedroom is also far from the door, so there is no hall or elevator noise. There was some pounding music from a holiday party one night, but it stopped by 11 or 12. Blackout shades were very good, though one side stopped about 1"" from the bottom. A maintenance guy (who visited to change a light) said that this was unfortunately the best that they could do. Overall good marks for sleeping, but not as quiet as my fav.As others have noted, the room service breakfast was incredibly weak given the price. Pathetic compared to the sumptuous meal we received for the same price at the PH Tokyo. We used the door tag most nights - the food arrived on time but was cold. Coffee drinks cool quickly as they are stupidly served in large open saucers. To be fair management offered to send us coffee drinks directly from the restaurant after the first incident, but I find it sad that Starbucks provides better drinks at a fraction of the price (Nearest location is a block up 41st - but it's jammed). Note - the famed poppy seed pancakes were unimpressive.Housekeeping was subpar (as is often the case) - forgot to restock minibar and other misses. The rest of the staff was pleasant though we rarely saw anyone manning the door. Apparently doormen are not included in the rates. One of the best things about this hotel is the central location. Great for transit as it is close to both eastside and westside lines, as well as Grand Central. $61 on Uber to/from JFK. Easy walking distance to Rock Center, Times Square and some neat rooftop bars at nearby properties. Quick cheap taxi ride to Gramercy Park area, Upper East Side, Village, etc. Really can't be beat unless you want to be close to Central Park (i.e. summer).If you are looking for a modern trendy midtown place near Times Square or Grand Central this certainly fits the bill.",1,1,
71,Sarah M.,"Hayward, CA",1,57,0,5.0,6/6/2016,"Hands down a great luxury hotel:) The rooms were bigger than expected for a NYC hotel. The front desk agents Anthony & this other German American young lady were so nice and very attentive to us. People like them, makes us guests value the Hyatt brand. The hotel is conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan right across from the NY Public Library and Bryant Park. It's also a walking distance to Times Square. I would def recommend this hotel to any tourist or business travelers because of its modern room decor and hotel location and most importantly the amazing staff they have.",,,
72,Devina G.,"Seattle, WA",559,180,340,5.0,7/9/2014,"On a recent trip to my favorite city in the world, we stayed at the Andaz 5th Avenue. Unbelievable great layout of one bedroom suite on the 14th floor - slick and modern with a spacious terrace overlooking 5th Ave. Truly spectacular view. View of the city is also visible through the wall of windows in the bedroom and the living room. Fridge is fully stocked with cool local products free of charge, very comfortable bed, blackout curtains, lovely bathroom with spacious walk-in shower and a foot soak tub.  The entire decor is very contemporary and minimalistic yet artful. Check-in was quick and efficient and I liked the open concept check-in next to the library/coffee bar off the reception area. Room  Location is very convenient for Times, Square, theater district, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central, shopping, etc. Also it's directly across from the NY Library. We had breakfast each morning at The Shop downstairs and they have amazing food, especially their lemon poppyseed pancake. YUM.",12,10,12
73,Bonnie C.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",73,33,11,5.0,5/10/2015,"This review is specifically for the manager of the floor, who I'd spoken with on the phone. I came in with a rather difficult reservation request, and not only was it fully understood and attended to, but I was offered options that put me at ease for my upcoming stay. As a first timer to New York, and having to plan this from the other side of the coast, the seven minutes on the phone made the disconnect that often accompanies distance irrelevant; completely refreshing. As someone who loves high end hotels, and frequents Trump, Mandarin Oriental, and Four Seasons, the service here has exceeded my expectations. Pretty glad I decided to try something new!Will update my review after visiting, hopefully adding to my first impression.",,,
74,Johnny T.,"Nashville, TN",4954,2249,2034,5.0,6/9/2012,"One day, when I rule the world and make all heel under the weight of my iron boot (even despots need good fashion), I will lounge and luxuriate in the Andaz 5th Avenue. Well, perhaps there's no need to encourage a totalitarian regime to enjoy the pleasure's of the NYC gem... but one can dream! And, the dream was realized.From the time you're greeted at the door to the time you're gripping the walls and being pulled out by security, you have no choice but to love the experience. The lobby is spacious and divided into relax, welcome and work areas -- perfect for the division of travelers the hotel sees. After a quick (in theory) check-in, get whisked to your room. I had to go through two elevator banks to get to my room but that was not an inconvenience. It allowed me the chance to model walk (Tyra, I am waiting for my call) through the posh eatery, past the indoor park and around the library. With high ceilings, beautiful flooring and glass everything everywhere, you are guaranteed to feel like a celeb.And, then you get to the room. What? WHAT??? You know that adage about NYC hotel rooms being no bigger than a bread basket? Yeah. Not here. This room was about the size of some 1-bedroom apartments. Gigantic ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, blackout curtains, glass closets, 3-room-bathroom, 3-person shower (what happens in NYC...), desk, light switches a'plenty, FAINTING LOUNGE (a must for all my dramatic moments), fluffy king bed and, get this, FREE GOODIES!!! Everything in the minbar, save the booze, was free and replenished daily. Want some apple juice? Drink it. Need some chocolates? Munch away! For there will be more tomorrow! I stay in a lot of hotels and, for the most part, I am happy with them. But rarely am I so taken with the accommodations that upon entering the room, I jump up and down, squee and throw myself on the bed. That may have happened here. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.",13,10,8
75,John S.,"Buena Park, CA",1399,538,43,4.0,7/23/2014,"Having frequented the Andaz 5th Avenue a few times, I can definitively state that every one of my stays has been great.  Staff is invariably on-point (unlike my experiences with workers at the Andaz Wall Street) the décor is chic and the location in Midtown off of 41st and 5th is ideal for my needs.  But who gives a shit about that stuff when you get:Suite upgrades!:  The past two visits, I've been upgraded to the Terrace Suite and the Splash Suite (newyork.5thavenue.andaz.…).  The former boasted a huge outdoor terrace, a rain-head shower, and a huge living and bedroom area with tons of seating and lounging space.  I exclaimed, ""Baby we are going to buck everywhere!"" to which we tried our damndest to fulfill.  Alas, this past visit last weekend was a solo trip so no bucking...  too bad as the huge tub in the aptly named ""Splash Suite"" was the focal point of the entire suite and could've made for some seriously sexxxafied times.Room Service!:  Those that know me well are painfully aware of how value oriented I am.  It's not like I grew up poor (parents made lots of money) or abjectly refuse to spend money (my painful totals at Ai Fiori and 3rd Floor being a prime example) but it's just a big deal to me that I feel like I get good value for my bucks.  Andaz 5th Avenue gives a very generous $75 breakfast allowance for Diamond members.  This itself is very generous, but when I heard that I could take this allowance as room service in addition to the restaurant dining, I was stoked...  Granted, all of the food here is extremely overpriced ($22 for bagel and lox??) but it's nice to know that loyalty to a brand is rewarded, and that you can eat your meal alone in the big ass ""splash suite"" tub with no one to keep you company...Had a small issue with wifi connectivity this time, but it wasn't a huge deal.  Anyway, naturally, most of these aforementioned perks come from staying at Hyatt hotels 50+ nights a year, but whether we choose to admit it or no, our economy is totally predicated on a ""rich get richer"" mentality.  Keep classy, Andaz 5th.",4,4,4

Andaz sort of compares to Starwood's W, only this is executed on a smaller scale and a much more thoughtful one.Welcome...The cheery girl that checked me in also handed me her business card and informed me that I should ring her if I needed anything. Also, the check in area is a lovely island in the center of the room and not some front desk style rectangle. Very nice touch. Notice I said room and not lobby? Oh, you'll see what I mean!My room was called the Andaz Suite and was larger than my cousin's apartment downtown! Every piece of furniture from the bed to the desk were very well thought out. The color palate overall is just gorgeous and relaxing. Oh, it was a surprise to see that the mini bar snacks and drinks were all complimentary! Finally, a hotel got it right! Who wants to pay $5 for a small can of Perrier plus 18% plus tax plus gratuity?!!?!!?! Crazy people? People from DE?! Who knows?! You can also pre arrange items to be placed into your fridge.My suite faced the lovely courtyard, which I requested because of the noise in this part of town, and it was pretty quiet compared to most hotels nearby. If you plan to stay on the lower floors facing the street, maybe bring some earplugs or ask for some by calling your concierge.The bath features REVOLUTIONARY water pressure from the rainfall head that's seemingly mounted in the sky. The luxurious volcanic tile in the bath is absolutely wonderful. The suite had 12 foot ceilings and they continued through to the bath. It's also worth it to note that the bath and sleeping area are about the same size... That's quite luxurious. I know the nearby W cannot compare!!! Also, the towels are large enough for a 3,000 pound person to use and still have room! Extremely large and sumptuous. This hotel reminds me of home! Don't be alarmed by the copper pot on the floor of the shower... Just try it. It is a foot bath. I was skeptical, but surprised.I think most people should skip the in room dining menu as the prices are fairly high even for this part of town. Plus, this is the part of town that stays open even later than the rest! So don't dine in your room unless you're too tired to leave... Or you don't want to put up with tourists that have unpredictable walking habits! :DAlthough I despise the ""Theater District"" and its tourists... This hotel would bring me back!Highly recommended and a recipient of my not so common five star rating. Final note: So well thought out and they have an excellent phone number. I could live here...

Even the signage on the gym - it is this tiny font on a plain white door - so mysterious! Gym is a good size however.  This place is designed for open collaboration and green trends which is aspirational but ...confusing and often not practical. Another example is that the room lights shut off on their own after so long.  What? Not functional when you're trying to get some work done or putting your makeup on.No one at the front to call a cab either, when you check out.  For the pricey-ness of this place - your money will go farther at other places, such as the Grand Hyatt.",2,,

Thank goodness she escorted me because it would have taken me forever to find the North Tower (I'm a bit directionally challenged) and you definitely need instructions on how to use all the gadgets in the room.I was giddy with excitement when we entered this modern and spacious (well spacious by NY standards) room.  I was shown how to work the light switches, blackout shades and 4 different shower settings (one of them being a rain shower).  I was famished after my long day of flight delays so was psyched when I was told that everything from the mini bar (excluding alcohol) was complimentary. Yum. Everything about my stay was absolutely perfect. My only complaint was that with the special tough light switches I had trouble figuring out how to leave just a small light on in the bathroom or hallway so that I wouldn't trip during my frequent bathroom trips during the night. I ended up sleeping in way too much light (so much for those blackout shades), but then again it's a shame for such a beautiful room to be hidden in the dark. -----------------* yelp.com/biz/andaz-west-…",9,2,5

In my opinion, this should be done automatically with the daily room cleaning. One day we came back to the room 4 hours after requesting mini-bar to be refilled, but it still hadn't been done.   I would have thought this was a one time occurrence, but this happened every day.  This hotel is clearly about design over function.  I've been to modern hotels and really enjoyed the experience such as The W or The Hotel 1000 (in Seattle), but these hotels offer customer service and better customer service in my experience. The open shower idea doesn't mesh well in a city as cold as New York.  Showering means shivering.  There is also very poor ventilation and lighting in the bathroom.  No one enjoys getting ready in the dark.  It would also be nice to have a toilet separate from the main bathroom.  This really doesn't go well with the open shower and poor ventilation when someone decides they need to do their business while someone showers.Overall, it just feels like this hotel is trying to be hip and trendy but is forgetting what really matters.  Customer service and comfort should be a number 1 priority.  There needs to be an overhaul in the bathrooms which are awkward and pretentious.  Also, the photo of the two men holding the toddler in every bathroom is just creepy.",,1,

I've stayed here before and for NYC, the regular rooms are pretty big too.A little about the Andaz -- it has a cool vibe. There isn't a big desk, just a table in the middle with some laptops.  All of the hosts are also concierges so they can check you in/out or find someone to get you a cab, and also you recommendations on places to go. All snacks and non-alcoholic beverages in the minibar are complimentary and if you need anything additional, they'll bring it to you. In addition, they have free coffee downstairs in the morning that is delicious. We had room service and also went to the coffee shop during our stay and the food was exceptional.

Since we work in hospitality it can be easy to criticize, but the Andaz was delightful. From the great location, to the friendly staff, and the amazing room space and amenities it was an enjoyable experience.When we arrived the lady at the door helped load our stuff onto a cart and introduced us to a Host. We were checked in and was told the room will ready shortly if we'd like to get a refreshment at the bar. We needed a stiff drink after the long ride in, so that worked out perfectly. Half way through our drinks the Host approached us with our keys and showed us to the room. All of our luggage was already placed in the room by this time and the Host took great care to show us around and answer any questions we had. Specifically Joy and Amber were both amazing in helping us. Do understand that this is a hotel in NYC, so be ready to pay $67 a night for valet, with no in/out privileges. Or one of the parking garages within a couple blocks for $40-50 a night, but when in Rome. The lower rooms can be a little noisy from the streets, but the views completely make up for it. Our room was on the corner and over looked the Public Library on 5th Avenue and was amazing. The floor plans are spacious and the ceilings really were 12 feet high! If you can upgrade to the Splash Suite I would highly recommend, as it'll give you a nice sitting area along with a tub, big enough for two, but more for show as we didn't use it. The shower though was amazing!These rooms are definitely designed for couples though!  The bathroom is rather open, the shower and toilet area have no doors. The bathroom itself is sectioned off by some closet style swinging doors, but there are no locks. The large shower has a rain fall showerhead as well as a detachable wall-mounted one that can both be on at the same time. There is also a bench and faucet for the foot bath. Getting the water to the right temperature can be a little tricky, so have patience when adjusting. The glass countertops and metal sinks looks nice, but will get dirty fast, if that matters, and they can be a little tricky in those hazy mornings when reaching for objects. We didn't use the TV, but they looked like they would be located in the right spots. Power outlets were right where you needed them and they already have international adaptors in them. There was plenty of closet space, the desk looked nice, and the wifi was functional. Everything in the mini-bar was included besides alcohol which was very nice and the staff was happy to replenish any items we ran out of. Best of all this is a GREAT LOCATION in Midtown NYC! You can easily walk to Times Square or Grand Central Station. The shops on 5th Avenue are plentiful and happen to be right on the way to Rockefeller Center. BTW the Top of Rock was an awesome experience.  I would highly recommend to any couples looking for a fun and romantic place to stay in NYC!",3,1,1
93,Michelle C.,"Philadelphia, PA",4087,1930,2462,4.0,12/20/2011,"I loved my stay at the posh Andaz hotel on 5th Ave. The rooms were very large by New York standards, and that includes the bathrooms. I probably could have fit two Ace Hotel rooms/bathrooms in my one room and bathroom at the Andaz. The furnishings and decor were very modern. The look was pretty androgynous but it was cool. The bed was huge and sleeping was no problem, especially with the screen that could be lowered in front of the window without even getting up. All lights were controlled by touch sensors, which was a little confusing at first and sometimes a little annoying when trying to figure out which lights were controlled by each sensor without waking a sleeping boyfriend. A minibar with complimentary non-alcoholic beverages and snacks was so awesome. How many times have you reached for that bottle of Fiji only to retract at the five dollar price tag? Having a cold bottle of H2O was such a joy in the middle of the night!I very much enjoyed my stay and would absolutely book there again.",4,1,3
94,Ameena D.,"New York, NY",95,448,0,4.0,1/5/2013,"Just checked out of the Andaz 5th Avenue after a 4 night stay and here are my thoughts:The Good:* Great location* Mostly friendly staff* Large rooms* Decently priced for NYC* Free drinks (coffee, tea, water, etc) in the room and in the lobby* Very cool little library for borrowing booksThe Confusing:* The bare walls in the rooms are kind of depressing* There is a serious lack of lighting, even with all the lights on* The shower is designed to leak water everywhere, unless you stand in the far corner of the large stallOverall this is a great hotel for the price. I think the large rooms and great location will make us repeat customers.",,,

96,John N.,"Jacksonville, FL",8,25,0,5.0,1/1/2014,"My Home when visiting NYC - No better property.Visiting NYC for 3x nights - for the 2013 NYC Half-Marathon - and thought I would give Hyatt brand Andaz a visit (based upon Trip Advisor reviews) - and I was NOT disappointed! All the positive reviews are right-on-spot.....this property does not miss a beat.LOCATION - Hmmm, I don't think you can get more centrally located on Mahattan. Property is directly across the street from the NYC Main Library (entrance is discrete on Library Way). The ""S"" train is behind the property on 42nd, and Grand Central Station is one block away. And, the property sits on 5th Ave. You can get ANYWHERE from this hotel, quickly and safely.ROOM - Where do I start? The bathroom is nearly as large as the sleeping area. I dare anyone to find a property in NYC with a bathroom this large. And, the shower is unreal (huge rain shower head wayyyyy up in the ceiling) the shower is literally a RAIN SHOWER!! All you need is thunder and lightning. The towels are the size of car covers. Bed is extremely comfortable. And, the view - - well, I was in the North Tower (there are 2 towers) - Rm 1019 (top floor) overlooking 42nd St and 5th Ave, and I could not have been more pleased with the view. Plus, you can sit on the window ledge inside and just read and watch the city below. The C&O Bigelow tolietries were fantastic (never smelled body wash like that before, nor soap like that). You need a degree in Pysics to figure out the alarm clock, but, I managed (and it takes an Ipod too). There are no light ""switches"" - just touch panels.INTERNET - Complimentary - fast enough, and always available.MINI-BAR - - FREE SNACKs and Sodas (and water)?!??! No, really - - it's free. And the staff was very accomodating (I drink more cola than other products, so they remove the other cans and loaded me up with cola). STAFF - - Ramon at check-in (and at check-out) was the perfect host. All staff that I met during my stay went out of their way - - very friendly - very accomodating. BUSINESS ITEMS - I was there on personal business, but I witnessed several ""groups"" that rented out the 2nd floor ""Studios"" and they loved the event. There is actually a wide-open kitchen/cooking area on the 2nd floor for events - - where I guess you bring your own Chef, and they cook for you. The rental Studios face 5th Av and 42nd St. Have your event here!There are NO annoying ""Tip Hungry"" doormen (doorwomen) or Valets to deal with at this property - it was very refreshing not to get bombarded at the door for a tip every 5min. The wine service on Mon-Thur (I was there Thurs) was complimentary and above average for those ""Manager Wine Servings"". Elevators were fast (never had to wait), and the door key and elevator pass-key process is tip-of-the-spear (no swiping....just hold the key in front of a pad). I never got down to the ""Cellar"" Bar or the weight room - but, based upon the other reviewers, I'm sure that both were impressive.When visiting NYC, I will stay nowhere else! This is my home in NYC.",4,1,
97,Emily P.,"Arlington, WA",0,5,0,3.0,1/16/2017,"I have such mixed feeling about this hotel stay! Would I come back again? Probably not. Especially considering the number of hotels available in NYC, and the PREMIUM price we paid for this 'average' hotel and its services...I booked this hotel exactly one year in advance, planning to celebrate my 30th birthday on NYE 2016/2017. I was very specific in my needs when calling, as I was looking to book a room that overlooked the NYE festivities at Times Square - and I had a large group of people traveling with us. We also needed an early check-in on the day of arrival, and had some specific items that needed to be coordinated (delivery of décor, catering, car service, etc). The initial booking was done over the phone, and went great. We booked the Empire Terrace Suite for 2 nights, at $2,645+taxes per night.Later on in the year, I attempted to make additional room reservations (via a 'block of rooms') and look into setting up a formal event at the hotel for an evening or two. I had no luck at achieving either. After many e-mail and phones calls, and being passed around to 3-4 different 'managers' - I gave up and made other plans. On one specific call to their '1-800/call center number' - an agent notified me of a 'Suite Deal' they were having - and was able to score us a deal on a 3rd night so we adjusted our reservations to take advantage of it.Two months or so prior to the trip, I was able to connect with Michael to get some details sorted out. Within the week prior to arrival, he was un-available, but put me in contact with Jinny. She was also very helpful in preparing for our arrival.The day we arrived, we were told we were 'guaranteed' an early check-in (we had flown overnight so everyone was pretty tired by this point). We arrived to the hotel about 10am, and found out that the guests had not yet checked-out - but they would get it turned over ASAP and would call us as soon as it was ready. We headed to Times Square for lunch. We returned about 1pm, and were notified that they had granted the guests currently in the suite a late check-out, so it would not be ready until 4pm. We pulled up a seat in the lobby, and took a light rest for the next few hours. Super frustrating! At 4pm (the actual guaranteed check-in time for the entire hotel), our suite still wasn't ready. For the next 60 minutes, several staff members shuffled around and they eventually had us in our room by 5pm.The suite itself was FANTASTIC! Beautiful furnishings and décor, two full bedrooms and bathrooms, comfortable beds and linens - couldn't ask for much more. The suite also had a 1,700sq ft wrap around terrace with BEAUTIFUL views! Since it was the middle of winter, no outdoor furnishings were provided.Some details seemed to go okay, and others were such a hassle. I had coordinated all the major details with the hotel prior to the stay, in the hopes that I would not have to spend the trip tracking stuff down or making other arrangements...but my efforts didn't seem to help that situation much.  The catering order arrived and was held 'downstairs' for several hours before being delivered. The extra dishes and items provided from the hotel all arrived on time, as requested. Any packages that we had mailed to the hotel were always 'lost' and it was a serious struggle to get employees to locate them. Check-in and check-out process were both very messy and un-organized.Our 2nd night at the hotel (the 30th of December), the room above us had a HUGE party that lasted into the wee hours of the morning. Loud people, loud music, people smoking joints and throwing them down on our patio, etc...Our 3rd night at the hotel (the 31st of December - NEW YEARS EVE), another group had checked-in to the suite above us...and were also having a huge party. And what a class act these guys were! They spent the evening spitting on our balcony, throwing cigarette butts down, and acting like complete clowns. After several close calls at physical altercations, and 2 phone calls down to management, they finally seemed to wrap things up about 3am. (Remind you, we were also having a party this same evening - but were sure to be respectful of the neighbors around us also celebrating NYE). Our guests sure were uncomfortable out on the balcony (since people were spitting and throwing things from above) which really put a damper on enjoying the views/events at Times Square.We checked out on the 1st of January (New Year's Day), and headed over to another hotel suite in the Soho area. It was a 10th of the price ($260/night), and had MUCH better customer service. The room wasn't quite as sleek, but their efforts to impressive their guests were worth noting (and they held true on their guarantees of check-in and check-out times).",,,

Very modern and stylish. The staff are all attentive, polite and helpful. It's got a great location for vacationers and business travelers; there is a ton in walking distance. The rooms are gorgeous and full of with state of the art tech. Of course being owned by Hyatt, I was a little concerned I would get a basic (not so great) Hyatt experience, but the Andaz is really it's own and operates wonderfully. I can't wait to be back soon.

The shower and bathroom are modern and still seemed deeply connected with nature by the stonework and use of metal and glass.

109,Matteo R.,"New York, NY",132,25,27,4.0,12/16/2016,"Went here for a Christmas holiday party on their ""event"" floor. Food was acceptable, nothing particularly good or bad. Not sure whether it was the selection of the night picked by the restaurant or the requested menu for the event by the host (keep that in mind while reading this review). Choice of food was extremely limited, with the menu consisting of 3 types of dumplings (not filled very much either, with chicken, shrimp, or vegetable as ""fillings""), lo mein, and tuna tartare or short rib sliders being walked around as mini tasters (otherwise I probably would have just eaten those all night). Open bar was nice, but again, a limited selection. Rafaele the bartender was very nice and made great cocktails, in particular his old-fashioned, which was honestly one of the BEST I've ever had. Would I go here again? For a ""free"" social event, yes; for the restaurant, probably not, if the food at the event was any indication. Hotel is beautiful and the event location is great.",,,

The lounge area was pretty spacious - your typical low couches/small square tables as well as high tables/chairs. The environment oozed muted sophistication. You can definitely have happy hour with drinks and a full dinner here - the bar menu is pretty comprehensive.Cocktails: I first ordered Rise of Virtue (vodka and amaro), which gave a slightly bitter taste but it was still flavorful. I also was brave to try the pisco sour (pisco, lemon, egg white, syrup). It was a simple mix and the syrup definitely covered up any egg taste.Food: The roasted flat-iron steak came with kale & brussel sprouts. It's definitely enough for two people to split. The beer marinated skirt steak was tender and juicy - probably my favorite of the night. We had the rock shrimp, which was average (honestly, the shrimp looked measly). Service: We had issues getting our table even after we confirmed our reservation. And our waitress was efficient but also curt.",,1,

116,Alex V.,"New York, NY",223,83,85,5.0,5/19/2013,Love this beautiful hotel designed by Tony Chi. The Andaz is unlike any other Hyatt I have stayed in. Upon entering the hotel lobby you are greeted with refreshments by the hotel staff and escorted to the center of the space where you check in. The person who checks you in gives you his business card should you have any needs acting as your personal concierge during the stay and escorts you to the room.The rooms are larger than most standard rooms in NYC. The decor is very minimal and the colors used in the room are very soothing and relaxed. The room is comprised of rich textures and materials which create a sense of warmth and sophistication. The minibar includes complimentary snacks and sodas. The room however does not have standard size closets and there's not much space to hang your clothes.,3,,

118,Kristen F.,"New York, NY",75,75,0,3.0,6/20/2013,"We stayed in a Splash Suite at the Andaz for several nights in mid-June. The Suite was very nice, with a beautiful tub and tall windows (with a view, to boot!) being it's prime features. The major downfall of the Suite was the bathroom. With a beautiful free-standing tub and a separate bathroom area (vanity, shower and toilet room), the beauty is far from functional. There was no door separating the toilet room from the remainder of the shower and vanity, and the doors into the shower-vanity area were a bit hard to keep shut. With the layout of the suite, that basically translates to zero privacy. I also found the bathroom lighting to be very poor for putting on make-up and getting ready. While my boyfriend loved the bed, I found it to be very firm. I expected a high-end hotel to carry slightly more plush, supportive mattresses. The Suite was slightly loud on weekday mornings, but that's to be expected when staying in the City.  I would skip out on their in-house restaurant; there's tons better in the neighborhood (Madison and Vine is a favorite). The hotel bar makes a rockin' mojito, though! It's central location is great for those traveling on business or pleasure. It was an overall good experience, with pleasant staff and excess space for our stay, but the key flaws of the suite itself will prohibit me from staying with them again.",1,1,1

Modern, artful with a flow to it that feels almost Zen with the city. Tastefully appointed furniture. And excellent food. As well as drinks. Even the bar, while in the basement, still seems to have an interesting flow to it. Almost as if you are sitting in Kitchen Stadium on Iron Chef, but with booze.

We had the croquetas and scallops they were delicious. Enough light in the bar to be engaging or romantic, depending on your party. Seats were comfy and drinks were to die for.

We had the lowest level room that they offered, and it was spacious (especially when you remember that you're in the middle of Manhattan.) I love that they have no check in desk. Instead, you walk in and you are just checked in by staffers hanging out in the lobby. If it's your first time in the hotel they even take you up to your room and explain how all the buttons work. We loved the toiletries and the complimentary snacks and drinks in the minibar. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the bathroom. This thing is huge! The bathroom alone is as big as many NYC hotel rooms. Such a treat.The biggest con would only apply if you are the type of person who likes to unpack for your trip.

126,Jess L.,"New Haven, CT",3282,4310,3309,4.0,9/16/2010,"I came here for a friend's birthday bash, and we had an excellent time. Maggie, our server, was very friendly and helpful in our drink and food selections. The decor is very posh and contemporary. It has a bit of a Scandinavian feel. The use of simple lighting is also very nice.The drinks are spectacular. The Booted Manhattan, Skinny Tie, and Velvet [something?] were really excellent. I'd say the Skinny Tie was my favorite. I wish I had liked the food more, but there were some winners. The beets and feta were by far my favorite. I was a bit disappointed in anything with garbonzo beans, for the beans were a little tough. The beans, spinach, and sweet potato were also too vinegar-y for me. I do not eat meat, but my friends liked the kale in the braised pork shoulder. Next time I'll skip the shrimp; nothing particularly stunning about them.I'd say this is a perfect place for a drink, though they're on the more expensive side of NYC life.",2,,2

128,Eliza V.,"Austin, TX",0,14,4,2.0,4/26/2014,"My recent experience here has been... Let's just go with ""less than ideal.""I stayed in a two-bedroom suite on the 13th floor. The room looked lovely enough, and the view really had the 'wow' factor.However, the problems started immediately. As soon as we arrived, we found that one of the toilets was clogged. They sent someone up to fix it relatively quickly, at least, but after he had fixed it, he walked out with his plunger by his side... which meant that he was dripping toilet water (and who knows what else) from the bathroom to the door. There was a visible trail of dripped liquid on the carpet, and drops just sitting on the wood floor. There was also a visible stain on the floor in the main living area.We went out an explored the city for a bit - the hotel is near plenty of stuff, Times Square being one of them, and an awesome bar right across the street being another!Speaking of bars... The hotel bar left a bit to be desired. They had stopped serving food by 10pm, small plates included. The drinks were fine, but the service was abysmally slow. We ended up changing our minds from getting another drink to simply leaving while we waited for our server to reappear.We eventually decided to simply order some room service and watch a movie in the room. We ordered two bottles of wine and some croissants. About fifteen minutes later, while trying to get the TV to work, we got a call saying that they actually had run out of croissants, but that they could provide pain au chocolat instead. I was disappointed, but agreed, and we continued to wait. While waiting for room service, we called the front desk about the TV. There wasn't an HDMI port available, so we had purchased their 24-hour access to internet on the TV for $15.99, thinking we'd watch something on Netflix (since the selection of movies in both the free and paid sections were terrible). We received an error when trying to use Netflix, simply saying that the page could not be displayed. When the technician arrived, he spent a few minutes looking at it, then called someone. During the process, he nearly purchased the 24-hour access to their selection of bad movies, and was about to hit the confirmation button before I stopped him (speaking of buttons, the keyboard that was meant as a secondary remote for the TV was dead. We had to have the batteries replaced for that as well). He eventually decided that it was just Netflix, and he got everything else working, but since we had only purchased that pack for Netflix... Anyways, he agreed to refund is for that.At that point, we were a bit frustrated, so I called room service and simply cancelled the order (by the way, the room service menu was severely lacking). She called back a few minutes later to say that the room service person was actually on our floor already if we just wanted to have the room service, and I had to explain again that no, we really didn't want it anymore since it had taken quite a while and we were simply going to go out instead, since our plans had fallen through on the movie front.All in all, it was an extremely disappointing first day of our stay. I wouldn't recommend this hotel, but it does get two stars for the location and the view from the room.EDIT: A fun little tidbit - housekeeping called asking for a Mrs. Stevens; I informed them that there was not a Mrs. Stevens here, and they apologized, then said that they saw the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, so they were wondering when we'd like to have the room cleaned. Apparently the DND is only applicable for the door, and it's fine to just call instead to ask us about it.EDIT II: My room key has stopped working twice while here. The first time, I figured it was a fluke, but...",7,1,1
129,Rachel L.,"El Cerrito, CA",184,152,21,5.0,6/24/2012,"Freshest hotel I've stayed in and the service was incredible too.I was put up in is hotel by a company hosting a panel I'd be speaking on the following morning. Because I wasn't paying for it, I didn't really care what I got in terms of room and amenities, but WOW was I please toy surprised.First of all, this place is brand new. State of the art everything.  I checked in at the floating reception area (no old school counters here) and was escorted by the same woman to my room. I kept thinking, is it really ok for you to leave the reception area? You dont have to personally escort me! But that is standard service.  She even carried by luggage.When we get to the room, she takes me on a tour (yes, a tour of my room). It's a two-room suite with the most insane bathroom I've seen (ever, anywhere). She shows me how to turn on the lights, the music, the air.  Everything swipes on and off, like on an iPhone, from various places on the walls. The bathroom is like a mosuleum, enclosed completely in pivoting glass doors. The walk-in shower has three faucets: a waterfall-like pour, a more standard shower head, and another waterfall at knee-height that pours water into a foot bath. Yep, a foot bath.I stayed in my hotel room working all night, my feet in the bath, working in my laptop for an hour. Then I ordered room service. I wasn't very hungry because my room included several complimentary snacks, including fresh stone fruit, organic chips, and gourmet chocolate, so I just ordered a Caesar salad. It arrived in no time at all again, it was the surprisingly pleasant service that stands out most.Lastly, the same petite woman who checked me in also checked me out. She said it was going to be tough finding a cab at this time of day, so without hesitation, she hoisted my bags up on her shoulder and walked with me two blocks to a better location. She stayed with me until she'd hailed a cab and then refused a tip. Unreal.I have no idea what the rates are at this hotel, but if I can afford it, I'll definitely be back.",3,,2

I had an engineer in my room for 2 hours at midnight trying to fit the lights - he couldn't.

Location can't be better: across the street from the NYPL, a few blocks from Grand Central, a fifteen minute walk from Times Square.The room was clean and comfortable. My only complaint -- and it's a very minor one -- was that there wasn't a lot of space to unpack and stash our clothes, so we sort of had to live out of our suitcase. This hotel is very much designed for people travelling alone on business and staying a night or two, not a couple visiting New York on vacation for almost a week. The shower is AMAZING. When it's that big, who needs a door?The best unexpected perk for us may have been the comp mini-bar items.

140,Jeff D.,"Austin, TX",27,10,16,4.0,8/30/2014,"This is truly a special hotel. The little details are what really counts for a weary business traveler, and Andaz has them covered in spades. This is an ultra-modern hotel with hipsters running the place. From the greeting you get by plain-clothed door""people"", to the check in where they casually ask you if you want a beverage while you wait 1.5 minutes for your reservation to be confirmed and a room assigned on their MacBooks, you know this is not an ordinary hotel. You might be inclined to think college students are running the place as part of a school project. They might be. That's OK -- they are a very eager and helpful staff. I knew what I was reserving when I booked the Andaz, but I'd imagine many others do not. So, they person who fills out your reservation will accompany you to your room to show you how it works. It's unorthodox -- there are automation touches everywhere, from the lights and temperature controls next to the beds, to the blinds. You walk in, the lights automatically turn on. No fumbling for controls. No need to turn them off when you leave, they'll time out later. I have an automated home and appreciate these conveniences. The reservation agent will also proudly demonstrate the mini bar. A lot of other reviewers have raved about the free softdrinks and snacks that welcome you. It is a nice touch -- you are paying $400 a night for the room, you should get some ""freebees"" regardless of your ""club status."" My only gripe was that I had requested some specific softdrinks ahead of time (Ginger ale), and they didn't fulfill it. The bathroom, specifically the shower requires a short tutorial. I am pretty savvy, but I would have gotten frustrated without the instructions. It is complicated. Trust me, unless you've stayed here before, don't excuse the staff from showing you around. You'll need it. Both the bathroom and the room itself was huge compared to hotels I've stayed outside the NYC metro. Very high ceilings. The view of the NYC Public library was spectacular. I was on the sixth floor, so with ear plugs I was able to drown out the city noise at night. Combined with the fantastic beds and pillows, I got a great nights sleep each of my two nights. The TV is a unique unit that incorporates a ""mini-computer"" that will allow you to browse the web, watch DVDs and just watch plain TV. Took me a second to figure out that the remote also has a mouse incorporated into it and that you don't need to use it. Just press the channel up and down after turning on, and you are good to go. Responsiveness in the remote and TV was sharp and fast -- two things most hotel TVs and remotes suffer with. Ate at the restaurant in the morning and it was decent, but very pricey. Go else where -- lots of great options in the midtown area.Now for some gripes and tips...The hotel offers two vehicles for guests to use for a fee to get around midtown. There are two tiers in cost. Starts at 35, goes to 45. I had a small party of people that needed to get from my office, which is right around the corner, to go to a restaurant in Union Square. I asked the front desk staff and the driver if I could pick them up since they were on the way. No problems mentioned with that, no additional fees. It was a Cadillac Escalade and my party loved it. 10 minutes from the hotel/office area to the restaurant. Driver was helpful and navigated fine. I get my check-out bill and the driver charged me 96 dollars for the drive. He added a nice tip for himself and a $30 dollar pick up fee for my friends staying at the office (which included another Andaz guest). The tip here is to get all your details from the staff and driver in advance. Ask more questions. I had the pick up fee removed from my folio. Lots of people check out from the hotel, but store their luggage with the hotel while they tour the city. I wanted to do that as well. Insist that they store your luggage in the locked room. To my surprise I saw luggage just sitting out in the far end of the lobby unprotected. I asked the staff about it and they said they ran out of space, but the luggage wouldn't get stolen. Not to worry. Yeah, right. I insisted on getting a spot for my luggage, but took all the valuables out to walk with me for my brief stroll before heading to the airport. Those are my only gripes. I would stay here again. This is not a ""business hotel"" but really, who needs a business hotel nowadays? I really enjoyed my stay and look forward to the next one.",1,,

142,Rachel H.,"Simi Valley, CA",175,687,0,4.0,5/7/2014,"Great place to stay!  We loved that it was across from the Library and Bryant Park and we liked the central location to so many things. Also, it is close to two subway stations, as well as Grand Central. Views of the Empire State add to the charm. The staff just couldn't be nicer! It was quiet at night and we slept soundly.  The only real issue we had and it wasn't huge, was there was a large amount of dust behind both nightstands. On the first morning, we asked that housekeeping please vacuum it when they came, as my husband has a dust allergy, and because it was very bad in general. It never happened, despite our requesting it be done specifically.  Oh well.  Otherwise, the stay was nice - when we called for room service it came promptly and the food was very good.  Some minor constructive criticism - the rooms need some artwork on those tall, blank, white walls to warm it up some.  Also, the disturbing photo hung at eye level when one is  on the toilet of the artist painting the less than impressive art from the cafe is strange and not welcoming. That was the extent of the room's decor and it was off-putting.  There was not quite enough closet space, but we made it work and just ordered more hangers from housekeeping. They were up there with them in a flash. We will stay here again on our next trip to the City, which we hope will be very soon.",1,,1

160,Tiffany T.,"New York, NY",32,230,2,4.0,7/13/2010,"Just opened last week!  I watched this place get built.  Day-by-day, I'd think, 'Ooooh, it looks pretty inside.'  Then, one day, I see people eating inside.  I look up the restaurant online.  Local-sourced, fresh food from familiar favs like Sullivan Street Bakery, Katz's Deli.  I'm sold!  Though I couldn't find a menu online, the price points are a little under $10 for a small plate and round to $12 to $20 for entrees.Entering from the corner entrance, I'm greeted by gorgeous (and quite large) floral pieces, medium and dark wood, shiny metal...There's a community table at the front (5th Ave side), near the barista, then the dining area, then a cozy lounge area closer to the lobby (41st St side).  Open kitchen with wood paneling that can be moved to obstruct or reveal the kitchen to the dining area.Service was super-friendly.  Earnest was our waiter.  We shared (i) a small plate of Seared Salmon with roasted baby carrots and beets and (ii) Entree of Spice-kissed Pork Loin with roasted plums, avocado and arugula salad.  Loved both.  Flavorful.  Portions made for a light lunch.  Totalled to about $40, including tip and no drinks.Will be back.  Everything on the menu that sounded delish.  Gave 4 instead of 5 stars since food was really slow in coming.  Lunch took an hour and a half.  Hoping slowness is a 'just opened' kink that will be fixed.",3,,1

166,Donna D.,"Overland Park, KS",0,6,0,5.0,5/22/2016,"We have been in heaven the last 5 days at the Andaz!!! We have a corner suite on the 13th floor with views of the Empire State Building and the Freedom Tower. Floor to ceiling windows and a huge living area. Our room has a small kitchenette but nice sized fridge with freezer and ice maker. Stocked with plenty of complimentary drinks. We came to the city for a graduation and this has been the best possible space for family living. We are close enough to the theater district without being surrounded by fake Elmos. The service has been impeccable. Great concierge service and we were surprised with a bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries one evening! We used the car service to pick us up from the airport and get us to a jazz club one night--very convenient! The food on the ground floor restaurant is fantastic. My husband ordered the New York strip and it was perfectly cooked. My kids loved the risotto and shrimp...also very tasty and well-prepared. We simply love this place and can't wait to come back. Yes, it's pricey, but it's New York! It has just been a dream.",,,
167,Vikki C.,"London, United Kingdom",194,239,36,3.0,2/18/2011,"Just over the road from our hotel, we stopped in here late one afternoon last year for a bottle of wine. With beautiful black wooden doors, and a recommendation from one of group in relation to the Andaz in London, it seemed like a good choice.We sat upstairs while people around us ate and instead just chewed the fat about our trip while sipping on a really nice bottle of Merlot. The waitress was totally fine about us sitting in the restaurant, and even got me the WiFi code, even though it was only supposed to be used by guests of the hotel. Because it was still earlyish, we wanted to be in vicinity of the huge windows and bask in the light that let in. I wish we'd at least taken a look downstairs though, as I hear that the bar is beautiful. Despite that, it's a nice place to relax for a bit with no stress from the staff. That's a good stop-off in my book.",,,1
168,Diane C.,"Hoboken, NJ",245,530,7,3.0,9/17/2010,"Review for the bar/restaurant on level C:Walked into the Andaz during that freakish tornado storm that blew through nyc... i was soaking wet from the rain and felt oh, so uncool.  Met my 2 galpals @ the bar in the cellar boy was it impressive to walk into that room.  Close to sensory overload to take in the space and surroundings.  Open kitchen, counters w/ sinks and bottles of liquor leading into barside seating, regular dining tables, communal tables, candles, exposed brick, good looking people... it's a sight to see.  Especially refreshing in Midtown Manhattan (not exactly a hotbed of cool spaces).Drinks:Kentucky Islands:  LOVE THIS.  Favorite drink handsdown - who knew bourbon could taste so tropical? Velvet Spice: Christmas in a cup.  Intriguing...Skinny Tie: Dislike.  Tastes like Tylenol.Fresh fruit cobbler:  Yummy like a fruit salad but not too original.  Very girly... I like my drinks boozy so didn't like.Meats and Cheese:Ordered 2 hams - Lachsschinken, westphalian.  Both OK but tiny portion ($10 for a measly pile of shredded ham?) and the ham was shredded beyond belief.  Couldn't really ""share"" because couldn't separate the ham slices from the lump of ham.Ordered 2 cheese - cheddar + Ricotta.  both really good!  and it comes with a honeycomb.  that was yummy!  wish it had better meats to pair with.Food:Roasted pork shoulder:  NOT GOOD.  DRY.  HARD.  DO NOT ORDER.Skirt Steak: Tasty and very cuban tasting.  Cooked a little too well done for my taste and the herbs on the steak were raw and not hot.  The textures did NOT work.In summation:  Space impressive.  Drinks good.  Food pretty bad.",1,,
169,Rita E.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,171,12,4.0,8/19/2010,"This review is for The Shop, Andaz 5th Avenue's restaurant on the corner of 5th and 41st. I'm quite thrilled it opened, not for their locally sourced, elegantly rustic menu (but that's cool too), but because they serve BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE in midtown! The only other location I'm aware of that does so in the city is in Williamsburg, and since Andaz 5th Avenue is close-ish to my office, I'll be stopping in here for a caffeinated treat. When I stopped by recently I ordered a cup to go ($3.25 or so, I recall) from a very friendly waiter. There is no separate counter for to-go service, The Shop seems to expect people to sit down and eat. The casual elegance of the space and the perfectly arranged condiments made up for my awkwardness as I stood and waited. If you haven't had Blue Bottle Coffee before, you should come here and treat yourself! It is completely smooth, medium roasted and not bitter at all. Each cup is individually drip brewed. I'd come back to try the food here some time too.",1,,1

Andaz investors should be ashamed of themselves. My white fish and quinoa tasted like it spent the day hanging out in a buffet at a midtown Korean deli.server (not sure of her name/is blonde) was in a horrible mood and couldn't be bothered to ask if we wanted refills on our wine/water. She was a total pill. The veal meatballs w/ (undercooked peas) were mediocre at best.Possibly the worst meal I've ever had in NYC in 12 years.I'm not being dramatic.,,,

172,Stacy S.,"Napa, CA",41,30,0,4.0,11/8/2010,"Only reviewing the Bar DownstairsWent to The Bar Downstairs on a Saturday evening. Loved that it was hidden, and took a minute to find it. It gave it kind of a speakeasy feel. Walked in and immediately felt warm...like you are in someone's home. The communal bar/tables are very inviting, and normally I like my own space. Love that the liquor bottles are in a box on the bar, so you can actually watch the mixologists make the most exquisite cocktails. The kitchen is right out in the open so you can watch what is going on there too! Normally, I am a purist when it comes to drinks. Vodka straight up with an olive and I am happy. However, I went out on a limb here, and so glad that I did. There were 4 of us, and each of us got something different so that we could try. Each cocktail was made beautifully - some shaken, some stirred. You could really taste the elements of each drink. Though there was a higher alcohol content, they were perfectly balanced. If you didn't find something you liked on the menu, no problem...they would whip something up for you! The cocktails were $15 each, and worth every penny!We also had a couple of small plates. The food was good. Loved the spinach/sweet potato/garbanzo side dish. Fantastic and well balanced. The meat and cheese also offered good selections.All in all, a very nice night! Absolutely recommended and will be going back!",1,,
173,Jaime L.,"Petaluma, CA",80,192,24,4.0,2/10/2011,I went on the best first date at the bar downstairs here and would definitely recommend. It's the kind of hidden location that you walk into and are a little awestruck and intimidated. The staff are very friendly though and I felt really comfortable with the long communal tables. I was very impressed with the drink list and the variety of ingedients in their specialty cocktails. Bring a date here that you are looking to impress!,,,

The huge showers are a unique concept, although the last time I stayed here the shower didn't have a door probably because it was a room suitable for wheelchair access. It was a bit awkward because my friend and I were sharing a room. As for food, the mini bar is free, the cafe downstairs has the best breakfasts (although pricey), and the bar in the basement has amazing tapas.

My friend managed to get us a room at this swanky downtown New York hotel which was right on 5th Avenue! I mean, I've lived in Manhattan before, but I've never LIVED in NY. This place was the icing on the cake to our short but sweet New York vacation.I arrived at the hotel first because my friend got stuck in Washington D.C. on a layover from Spain (silly East Coasters and their ""earthquakes"") :D Let me just say, this place is impressive. I was dropped off by the Super Shuttle on the restaurant side of the hotel (a bit confusing because I couldn't find the entrance initially... it's kinda discreet) and was greeted by a one of their staff almost immediately. He pulled up our reservation immediately and offered me a glass of wine (never had a hotel do that before). I was a bit confused at first because my friend had said that he'd put my name down on the reservation so that I could check in... when the greeter kept referring to me as ""Ms. my friend's last name"". Not sure if they did that on purpose... but it was amusing nevertheless (they did it the whole time we were there). We went with another friend which we snuck in of course (shhhhhh) because you were only technically supposed to have two people per room.The greeter escorted me up to the room and showed me around the place (it's not the biggest room ever, but think Japan sized hotel rooms... if you've ever been there... it's small) and demoed all the switches (touch switches!... though it's not like I wouldn't be able to figure that out) and explained all the perks.The room is enough to fit a bed and a table. The layout is interesting. Glass shelves are in the hallway (there's a mini fridge with complimentary snacks and drinks; just not the alcohol of course) and the bathroom was immediately to the left when you entered the room. There's no door to the shower... I never understood this fad... but what the heck... but the shower itself is super nice. It's a rainfall type shower with even a mini foot bath waterfall thingy on the side.I love the colors and the minimalistic look of the room. Just not entirely practical though. There were blackout curtains too (OMG SO NICE). The pros... location (5th Avenue... come on. PLUS really close to the subway which is incredibly convenient), complimentary snacks (chocolates/sesame bar/err... cookie?... don't remember... they also had water/sodas/juices too and they all get refilled every day, yay!), the service (seriously... the best... didn't have umbrellas and it happened to rain on one of the days... and they lent us umbrellas to use! :O), FREE happy hour (wine tastings which we managed to sample)... I mean this place made the vacation just absolutely perfect and enjoyable. Love this place. Not sure about the price, but I would try and come back if I come back.",1,3,1

My sister was very turned off by this but decided to say hello, the lady said hello back and turned to her coworker and made a face. I didn't appreciate this at all. We were all in our early twenty's, and weren't dressed up at all when we decided to take part in the hotels wine hour but it doesn't justify why we didn't were greeted with stares and whispers instead of hello's and smiles.

187,Terri V.,"Manhattan, NY",159,277,13,3.0,6/4/2011,"We stayed for three nights at the Andaz off 5th Avenue, across from the NY Library,  after moving out of our NYC apartment. Though we had some overlapping business to attend to, the ""Large Suite"" offered us the much appreciated quiet Zen after the stressful, hectic move. The staff was fabulous and attentive with a trendy, chic ambience upon entering the hotel...though sometimes in their attempt to pull off the ""Avante Garde"" impression, the Andaz lost it's ease and functionality. Trying to find the hotel bar was an interesting experience with no direction or door signs available..the staff at the bar were very friendly, but I felt like we were in a cafeteria with most of the room filled with long farm style wood tables that were exposed to the stark industrial metal of a utilitarian kitchen. There was very little cozy space for quiet, intimate conversation.The entry area of the ""Large Suite"" was crowded, donning a long farm dining table and two uncomfortable Santa Fe styled leather chairs, but adjoining was a practical kitchenette area with coffee, refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher and sink.The spacious remainder of the living room, bedroom and bathroom area with its sleek contemporary design offered high ceilings and a lot of closet space, but there were many cons: the electrical design was extremely unintuitive, there was inconveniently no desk, and though the LOOK of the bathroom was very cool, we hated the bathroom and it was absolutely non-functional. It had very LOW lighting and the spacious shower had no door which entertained a COLD, DRAFTY shower experience and a wet bathroom floor. It had a horrible slidebar and heavy handheld that was poorly designed because it kept falling over to the shower floor....absolutely unusable except as a weighted handheld....which left the rainbird 6 feet above your head and a waterfall faucet flowing into the stone foot washing bowl accompanied by stone seat...serenely asian...all nicely extravagant I'm sure, though a simple door for warmth and usable handheld that actually STAYED on the wall would have been preferable. I would stay at the Andaz again because we are Hyatt members with a lot of points stacked up and since the Stanford closed, the only other option is the Grand Hyatt, which we dislike, but I would check out the bathroom before committing to the room and I would not stay in the ""Large Suite"" again.",2,,

Massive and then some. - Tall ceilings in a city where rooms are cramped- Awesome restaurant for breakfast in the lobby (best lox I have had in a long time)- Massive shower with bowls to soak your feet- Room service is very reasonably priced and fees are way less than most hotels- Room service food is excellent. Big pleasant surprise.- Great service all around- A killer gym, love this gym- Love the robes and soft slippers in the room as well.Only 1 knock I can think of: the shower is so huge and with high ceilings, but without a door, you get a cold draft that can be uncomfortable at times. Thank you Hyatt for putting this hotel in midtown Manhattan. I am a fan for life!",1,,

197,matt h.,"Denver, CO",4,393,1,5.0,5/15/2011,"This hotel, simply put, was the best I have ever stayed in.  It is better than the Encore in Vegas and the few Ritz Carlton hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in.  First, the room.  We were upgraded because I am a Hyatt platinum member, which is achieved simply by getting their credit card, and the room (#510) was amazing.  It felt very large, especially for New York.  The ceilings were very high, the televisions (yes, two), were huge and great, the bed was so comfortable, and the bathroom was a trip.  The shower was amazing, with a waterfall like head as well as a traditional one, in addition to a foot bath feature that was pretty cool.  The in room snacks are quality and are all free, and the complimentary evening wine tasting featured a very delicious red that they were happy to keep refilling both me and my wife with.  The location is superb, within walking distance of many great sights.  The staff were super friendly, even though I am not a high roller by any means.  I could not have anything nicer to say about this place, I absolutely loved every minute there.  It is super modern, and the older set might be turned off by the high tech lights, curtain controls, check in process, etc.  But for me and my wife, it was perfect.",1,,
198,Monica C.,"Bakersfield, CA",33,11,3,4.0,6/21/2011,"So I had the pleasure of staying at the Andaz on my first trip to NYC & it was fabulous!  From the moment we checked in until the moment we said goodbye, the staff was very helpful and friendly.  Elaine checked us in, helped us to our room, showed us around and always remembered my name each time she saw me! We had a lovely room and the only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because the lighting in the bathroom and lack of a door on the shower (although they were both quite beatiful, just not very functional).  The bar downstairs was also fabulous, but that is another review!",1,,
