Updated review","Slowly but surely 6B is turning into a dump. I've noticed a few bad health ratings recently, but I saw they were back to A status so I stopped in to get a sandwich (which are usually great). Today, I ordered a panini.... what I received was NOT a panini. The sandwich was not made with panini bread, but with warm pita triangles - not even toasted or pressed. Sloppy, soggy, floppy and pathetic. I gave 6B a shot at redemption and was proven wrong. I will not return - Go to TableTime across the street. Same gist of a lunch spot, but way better.",4,2,1
2,Yaran S.,"Pittsfield, MA",152,277,1366,5.0,1/13/2018,"I almost ate there everyday when I worked in the building. Both breakfast and lunch were great. Very broad selections of yogurt, fruits, meat, fish, carbs, etc. I prefer the food from hot/cold bars to the made-to-order counter. Sushi was very fresh and tasty. Bagels were okay but cannot compete with many other bagel stores in the city.Be careful how much you take because the price adds up very quickly.",3,1,1

6,Shen Q.,"San Francisco, CA",722,115,507,3.0,1/31/2017,"Okay buffet deli place in Grand Central area for busy office workers. The place is hidden in a building between 41st and 42nd on Madison and I couldn't even see it's name until I walked out and was still in disbelief to see 6b (what kind of name was that?!).The buffet area was really big and had a couple of sections: salad, side dishes, meat and SUSHI! I was a fan for sushi and the sushi here was not bad and they had my favorite EEL SUSHI. The rest of things were nothing special but standard for a quick lunch.The checkout line could be really long during rush hours and might take 3~5 minutes to get to the cashier. The price was slightly higher than other deli places in the area (somehow)... Don't think I will make the hike to this place again to meet the big crowd while paying more, when I have cheaper and as good options available just under my building.",,1,

I purchased several other items from the salad bar because of the generous portion size of the MealPal, the 6b food variety, and helpful staff. I'll definitely return to eat here again.",4,1,1

When we go around 1-2PM you don't have to wait for a communal table. * Lots of food options. I personally go for the sushi where you can try a medley of different rolls from Tempura Shrimp, Spicy Crunchy Tuna/Salmon, regular Tuna/Salmon, eel and crab rolls. 6 rolls and pinch seaweed salad for under $7. The freshness of fish and fish-rice ratio is great! * Also love the Shumai and Sauteed Mushrooms.Make sure to watch how much you're putting in your box because it can quickly rack up to over $15!",6,2,4

13,Joe L.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",147,362,1025,4.0,9/1/2016,"This is a gem hidden away in the lobby of 60 East 42nd Street.  It's not visible from the street.  To get there, either walk past one or two elevator banks in the lobby or through the Chase Bank ATMs on the ground floor.  This is your basic Korean-owned deli/buffet place.  I have not yet tried the sandwiches, but the hot and cold buffets are very good.  The food generally is more Asian-oriented.  Their spicy Korean BBQ pork is pretty good, as are their spring rolls and shumai.  I recently tried their pot roast with mushrooms and onions.  The meat was super tender and fell apart as my fork went into it.  They usually have a decent variety of hot and cold veggies.  The spaghetti squash is pretty good.  The steamed veggies aren't overcooked, which I love.I recently tried the creamed mushroom with truffle soup.  The taste may be a bit too rich for some, but I thought it was AMAZING.  I loved the frothy texture.6b is located in Midtown, so, yes, it can get pricy, especially if you decide to go all out, which I am guilty of doing.One thing: because of its physical location, there is no cell or data reception.  In order to check in with Yelp, I had to go out into the street after my lunch.  So, if you are expecting an important call, you may not want to eat here.The place is clean, and I noticed one worker quickly clean up a spill.  The cashiers are pretty quick and efficient.  They definitely run a tight ship here.The seating area is pleasant.  During one visit, somebody was playing a keyboard.  I've only seen this done once, so it is not a common occurrence.  Usually they are playing some light music station.All-in-all, this place is a great find.",5,,1

15,J. T.,"Queens, NY",2,17,3,3.0,9/22/2017,"I've been getting breakfast or lunch from this place for a while as my office is in the building which is very convenient when crappy weather will keep me from leaving said office/prison. Most times the egg sandwiches are fine (I was thankful when they installed a griddle to make fried eggs as opposed to the pans over stovetop) though I've crunched on some egg shells a few times. They also have on occasion left out the ham in my ham/egg/cheese sandwiches. I think asking for a vegetable in the sandwich throws them off. They get pretty busy during breakfast hours so I'll let the flubs slide because they're generally very nice guys behind that counter. But for the record, know that I don't like hamless ham eggshell sandwiches (regardless of how much calcium are in those shells).There are some select rude female cashiers though who have given me the hairy eyeballs sometimes. They rotate so I do manage to get some nice cashiers. One of the nice ones ended up finding a job in an office on the floor I work on so hey professionalism does pay off.Lunch offerings provide a pretty large (but not the largest compared to others in the neighborhood) selection with the decent salad bar, fresh fruit (sometimes still frozen), grilled vegetables, salmon, soups, sushi rolls, chicken/broccoli, fried rice, etc. I am thankful they finally learned how to cook white rice because it used to be somewhat dry and crunchy, practically undercooked. Though it is overpriced overall, it's there for my convenience and in line with prices of other buffet places. Just be cautious of those egg shells.",1,,1

Might not have the widest selection but there are plenty of options for everyone and quality far outweighs the rest. Sushi isn't bad and chefs are making rolls fresh and regularly repleneshing rather than huge trays sitting out. Perfect if you want a few pieces.They also will make a specific roll on the spot if you ask.Their chinese section is actually pretty good, and they have really tasty vegetable options. The fish is always fresh, salmon is skin on and AWESOME. The food in general is never greasy nor salty which would be my complaint for every other buffet style place in the area.To get there from chase/42nd St side: walk through the doors where chase is on your right and take a right into the hallway. The place is the first door on left, across from the newsstand and there are pasta making machines in the window display.From 41st St- through the revolving doors, down the steps and its the first semi-hidden door to the left (back entrance).",5,,1

A really good combination of variety sandwiches with many different types of breads, not just rolls/heroes or wraps. I had ""The Boss"" sandiwch, bulgogi with coleslaw, smoked gouda, and sauce, for $6.95!! You can't beat that. I've tried a few of their other items off the buffet and it's also really good and fresh. I'll definitely be back for the sushi as you can tell they make it fresh and it's not all rice either.Good find!",,,

24,Leah F.,"San Francisco, CA",32,70,14,5.0,7/11/2014,"I've been wondering for the longest time if this place had a yelp page, just so I can rave about it! Indeed 6b is a hidden gem!For the past year, I've been hitting this place up for breakfast/lunch at least 3-4 times a week. Food is NEVER hit or miss. The buffet offers such an eclectic and creative variety. They get slaphappy with the kale and quinoa, but at least it's healthy.Their best hits are the Chinese food, fried soft-shell crab, and pesto filet mignon. On Mondays and Tuesdays, they'll have guacamole and pico de gallo with chips. (No extra guac charge, since it's buffet style. You can just fill up your box with those bad boys.) Alternatively, the salad bar is always very fresh and delicious.Most importantly, their prices are relatively fair. A New Yorker knows what an $8 buffet box feels like. I'm never taken by surprise when my box is weighed.",6,1,2

The space is contemporary and uniquely designed with for-sale art pieces on the wall. 6B offers a wide variety of hot and cold lunch buffet items, which are fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. The menu changes daily but some highlights include: build you own salad with 15+ ingredients, fried soft-shell crab, croquettes, and salmon ceviche. I haven't tried the made-to-order items, but I would expect it to be just as good as the other items. La Colombe Coffee is sold here, too!",6,,2

35,Sunny P.,"New York, NY",1,3,0,5.0,10/22/2014,#2 Hidden Gem Places in NYCThis is my second review of Hidden gem places in NYC series. A real hidden gem in Midtown. The best deli place I have ever been to. The quality is so good that I don't want to call this place a deli. It's better than any restaurant around Midtown. The food is as close to food from Michelin star-ed restaurants. Not many people come here despite its location. And I hope it stays like this forever and doesn't get crowded. Hope they don't advertise this place too much. HahaThe menu changes everyday. They put out only the fresh items. They clean the dinning area so well. Highly appreciate fast cashier line.,5,,
36,Clement D.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,1/15/2015,"As other reviewers said, this is a hidden gem - and truly hidden, there are no signs outside the building so you may have a hard time finding it.I used to work across the street, and I was going there 2-3 times a week for breakfast and another 2-3 times a week for lunch. I am missing it quite a bit these days!At first glance it looks like just another of these buffet place where, let's face it, food is usually plain disgusting. This is not the case. Whatsoever.The first thing you notice is that it's clean, kinda classy even, there is at times some hipster music playing, and it doesn't even smell gross. The second thing you notice is how creative the buffet dishes are. I mean it's almost ridiculous. It changes every day, some items are always there (staples like rice or veggies or chicken or caesar salad), but salads and meats rotate quite a lot. It is not uncommon to find salmon ceviche (in a buffet place?! you kiddin' me??), or some very exotic salads with ingredients you have never heard of unless maybe you live in Williamsburg or Portland.There is also a DIY salad station, and a made to order sandwiches station. You can also order some pretty nice smoothies and juices, but the cashiers make them and it can take a while (it is clearly not their job). Also this is kinda random, but the selection of chips and candies they have is like nowhere else. They also serve La Colombe coffee.The breakfast selection is OK, usually there is a whole selection of sausages and meets, scrambled eggs, frittata, pancakes, oatmeal, fruits, yoghurts. They also have pastries like croissants and danishes from Balthazar bakery - they are pricey but so damn delicious.

The sushi chef does not keep the sushi trays full. He makes like one roll at a time, at a snails pace, and its usually taken up fast and then its like 10 minutes each time till he makes some more,  while the trays are usually mainly empty. So you have to sit there and wait if you want sushi. Usually I just end up going somewhere else since its lunch hour and I cant sit and wait there. I don't understand why they don't make more quantities of sushi so the trays are always full and available.... I'd probably end up spending 100 dollars a week here since they are right down stairs from my office. But instead I end up spending zero here and end up somewhere else. Oh well",,3,

They've gotten my order wrong a LOT, so I would highly recommend checking your food before you leave to make sure you actually got the food you ordered. It's definitely overpriced ($2.25 for a 20 ounce bottle of soda, $5.00 for a Naked Juice) but I work in the building so I come here out of convenience more than anything else. The cashiers are very nice, but there seems to be a decent amount of turnover, so they're not always familiar with pricing and sometimes overcharge you. It's a convenient place to eat with a decent selection (though the choices don't change much), and the food is pretty good, but it's honestly too overpriced. It's also frustrating because frequently there aren't enough cashiers on the registers and the line gets ridiculously long.

Selection is decent and they have rotating options. The sandwiches are the best deal. All $7-8, they use fresh ingredients, and lots of them. They also have a fairly comprehensive salad bar which I eat at least once a week. The best hot food items (I think) are the wings, curly noodle mac and cheese, scalloped potatoes (wish they made these every day), and the chicken primavera pasta. Not healthy though, so I stay away from the hot items as much as possible. I usually go down at 2pm or later, and sometimes they've already started taking up the buffet trays, but I can always find something. I don't often grab breakfast here, but when I do it's a  $4 bacon egg and cheese sandwich which is a great deal.

The variety is great with ever changing buffet items, and the food quality is the best I have ever had for a deli. I would say some of the dishes are restaurant quality. Like others have said, this place is a step up from the other nearby delis like Essen, Sarah's etc. A bit more expensive than those other delis but you are paying for quality that is well worth the money.",1,,
51,Shoshanna F.,"New York, NY",1,103,0,5.0,10/7/2015,"What a hidden gem!  The food here is GREAT-- really high quality, tasty and gourmet.  Quality and food is noticeably better than all neighboring places, e.g. Essen, Sarah's, Marche Madison, etc.  I'd strongly recommend trying it out, but I don't want it to get too crowded!  My only complaint is that it is a little expensive, but you pay for what you get for...I'm willing to pay a few dollar(s) extra per pound to get such good food.",1,,

53,Betty W.,"Newark, NJ",204,71,9,4.0,8/19/2014,"Oh I totally should have been first to comment on this! I have been coming here since the day they opened and I was in anticipation as soon as the sign went up. I work in the building and I come here pretty much every day I'm in the office. I love the iced coffee and they have a variety of Monin syrups to use (my new fave is Salted Caramel). Their breakfast buffet is decent with a bunch of different types of sausages, bacon, three diff styles of eggs, sometimes frittata, French toast or pancakes and oatmeal. Plus your standard yogurt bar with almost every fruit known to man. I love their lunch buffet, especially lately, they have some good offerings about 90% of the time and while not the cheapest it's generally worth it. They have some standard Asian-American fare (lo mein or fried rice, sesame or general tso chicken, dumplings and shumai), some diff varieties of pastas and meats and usually 2-3 types of fish. What I really love about them is they will have some always have some creative and ""Are you really selling this at a buffet counter?"" type dishes which keep me surprised and culinarily delighted. Their hot grill I'm a bit ambivalent about. Sometimes it's worth it to pay for the diff types of sandwiches and wraps in the morning but during lunch I think it ends up being wayyy too expensive. Definitely glad it's a bit hidden so it's not always packed with outside people. Fantastic!",2,,
54,Alan N.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,178,14,5.0,7/8/2014,"Based on the review of Andy C. I checked it out.... it was good, very good. It's also pricey, very pricey-but you get what you pay for. Today I tossed a nice spinach salad, added some grilled veggies, a scoop of shrimp/calamari salad (a bit over cooked)   some impressive pieces of sushi rolls... hey at 10 bux a pound rice adds up. One of those small container things cost 12 dollars. I don't have it like that , but if you do God bless you eat there every day.",3,2,
