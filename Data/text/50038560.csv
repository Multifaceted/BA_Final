1,Nelson L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,82,60,3.0,9/13/2018,"Overall: 3.5/5Almost gave this place 4 stars. I got quarter chicken with salad to go, and it came with bread.The food is good, but there are better value options. Especially when it comes to roasted chicken, a lot of supermarkets have (hot or cold) whole chickens available.Food: 4/5The salad is amazing. The chicken was good.The dressing was soaked into the salad, but it didn't feel heavy.I didn't like that the chicken was on top of the salad and therefore soaking up dressing but it turned out alright.Value: 2/5Considering you can get a whole cooked chicken for $7-$10 at a supermarket (cooked, ready to eat and seasoned), getting a quarter chicken for the same price feels pricey.",1,,
2,Jolene H.,"New York, NY",7,135,51,3.0,9/12/2018,"Yahhh... not impressed. Even for a late-night. Worst? They charge $2.00 for delivery. Macaroni and cheese (as an included side) is artificial, soggy, cheap, and bland. The baked potato doesn't include anything more than a plain-ass potato. The fries are thick and floppy. Chicken? Roasted has a mediocre herb skin, but it's dry and bland within. Fried is crispy and salty - my fave. Still dry, but the dark meat has some moisture. Order at the counter, get a number, and wait maybe 8 minutes for hot stuff to come. Or, order delivery and expect 45 minutes max. Everyone's nice. But everything's better at KFC. Sorry!",1,,
3,Hannah C.,"New York, NY",41,182,98,2.0,7/20/2018,"The good news first:Not many places on seamless/delivery.com that deliver in less than an hour are open after 9pm on a Sunday. Chirping Chicken delivered my order surprisingly fast.Their chicken was very juicy and flavorful, it reminded me of the type of chicken you get at Dominican places.Bad news:When I was placing the order online I noticed that the 1/2 chicken & baby back ribs didn't come with any sides except for pita bread and cole slaw which I thought was strange for the price ($26), but I had a coupon so I ordered it anyway. When everything arrived there were a couple of things we didn't order which makes me wonder if they were included by accident or if the combo actually did come with sides but instead of allowing a choice online they just pick random sides for you. They included mashed sweet potato which no one in my house eats so unfortunately that was trashed, and a huge plain baked potato. The ribs were cooked alright but the sauce on them was terrible, there were also cups of the sauce on the side which I'm pretty sure was just ketchup mixed with hot sauce. I also ordered a quarter chicken which came with a side of mac & cheese that was pretty much velveeta (not a compliment).",,,
4,Sadia H.,"East Bronx, NY",248,344,1837,3.0,11/13/2018,"I've had their grilled chicken platter using mealpal, and I gotta say it's a good amount of food, a quarter chicken with pita, salad, and a piece of rice wrapped in grape leaf, and everything was tasty and fresh.",3,,
5,Koko L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,1.0,11/4/2018,Honestly the worst food. I have been twice and both times the food is terrible. Add some damn salt and flavor to yo food! Just because you sell and cook cheap food doesn't mean you shouldn't care about it or improve it. No one likes the taste of indifference.,1,,
6,Liz G.,"Washington, DC",140,360,96,4.0,5/14/2018,"I was really happy with the fact that I could order online and walk over to the store and pick it up. The menu is a bit confusing, and I wasn't sure how much food I was going to end up with (partially because the prices are so affordable), so I ordered the arugula salad and a 1/4 chicken, juicy, with sauce and potato salad (not having any idea what I would really end up with), and I was really happy with what I got.The arugula salad was actually awesome, and the grilled chicken on top was perfectly cooked. The 1/4 chicken was a tiny, tiny bit less juicy than I would have wanted, and the sauce was sort of a mix between tomato paste and V-8 juice, but taste-wise, it was fine. The potato salad wasn't really my jam- it was a bit too sweet for my taste, but certainly edible, and a nice portion size. Both items came with a stack of flatbread, so all-told, it was a ton of food that lasted a couple of days and fed multiple people. I would absolutely go back!",2,,
7,Abigail R.,"New York, NY",2434,271,957,4.0,12/15/2017,Anytime i'm near a chirping chicken I have to get some chicken! Its soooo good they also have gotten better with the waiting time.

8,Brenda L.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",61,21,10,1.0,8/31/2018,The service is horrible. Ordered a whole chicken a side potato side fries and side salad. The side salad was so small it looks like it should've been complimentary. I called and explained that I actually paid for a salad and got a small salad ( mind you I've ordered this salad before and it was huge) she basically told me to go fuck myself and didn't do anything to justify this situation. Horrible attitude!!! Horrible service! And my food was cold and soggy. SMH!,1,,
9,D G.,"Manhattan, NY",2,14,7,1.0,11/7/2017,"This is the lowest quality of food that an establishment can serve and still meet FDA STANDARDS.   I ordered fried chicken and french fries as take out. I should have canceled my order when the smell of old burnt grease began to perfume the place.  I asked for the fries be made well-done, but not burnt. What I received was old fried chicken, refried at least two or three times already. Hard, as a rock on the outside. Dried and ""minced"" meet on the inside.  Nit sure of the seasoning, but in one bite--I tasted sweet, salty, sour. Fries were limp and soaked with grease.  They were barely cooked.Formerly, this was a spot that my friends and family frequented for years, post after school activities and on Saturday's between play dates.  It was quick, inexpensive and enjoyable. Now, I'll tell you...don't bother. Maybe mid-day is better, fresher food is on the menu?Nonetheless, I am angry that I just wasted $9 bucks on this crap that went in the garbage. It's truly incomprehensible that a cook/chef/food service professional would serve this to someone.  It's sadder, that someone else is buying and eating enough this crap that Chirping Chicken think it's ok.",3,,
10,Michael C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,2.0,10/29/2018,This Place is Ripping its customers Off. WTH charging a $1.50 Administration Fee on ALL delivery's.

11,Celeste B.,"New York, NY",241,514,946,3.0,11/9/2017,I've eaten at this restaurant a few times because it is close to the hair salon I go to. The store itself is spacious and has plenty of seating available. I can't say the staff is friendly but I have never experienced anything negative. Most of the staff unfortunately just look as if they just don't want to be there. I've gone to another chirping chicken in the past around 86th Street further downtown. I remember there food tasting better than this location and the staff being friendly and helpful there.,1,,
12,FaceCollapser R.,"Sea Cliff, NY",0,7,0,1.0,8/21/2018,"I have been eating at this restaurant for about a year and slowly this place has gotten worse. Initially the food was great, the chicken was tender and the salads that accompanied the food were fresh. Over the course of time, they started getting my orders wrong, which I thought to be, 1 time mistakes, but out of 5 orders they would get 3 of them wrong. I also noticed the salads have stale greens and the chicken is dry. For a franchised establishment, I expect much better. I guess commitment to quantity trumps commitment to quality. This restaurant will no longer receieve my support.",1,,

14,Jen L.,"Manhattan, NY",298,120,391,3.0,9/12/2016,"Not bad for the area.We got the 1/2 ribs and 1/4 chicken. The ribs had a tangy sauce and the meat was juicy. The chicken was too charred for my taste, but the meat was tender enough. The mac and cheese tasted like artificial cheese but I wasn't expecting anything artisan considering the prices.",2,2,1
15,James G.,"Bronx, NY",620,11,117,4.0,11/7/2017,"This review is LONG overdue... This is my go-to spot when I'm hungry and want dependable quality food. Literally I order from them at least once a month if not more for the past three years. So why a 4 Star?Delivery via the apps suck (1 hour plus wait time - I suggest calling and placing the order for quicker service), and they tend to forget one of the most important things, THE BARBECUE SAUCE .It may not seem like much yet they have this perfectly blended sauce that goes right with their chicken. Yet, let's get down to all the plus aside from the delicious, mouth watering, day dreaming . They have an amazing macaroni and cheese (for fast food), they offer whole wheat pita bread (taste great with the bbq sauce they almost never bring me lol), and their grilled veggie platter is also perfect - the carrots are sweet and the mushrooms savory. I did find them on Yelp, so I have to thank you Yelpers for putting me on to such an amazing place. Oh price point, it's perfectly price for the quality of food and serving size, however, I just wish they did not forget that damn delicious BBQ sauce.",1,,1
16,erika n.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,2,1.0,5/29/2018,"Man. Such a waste of my money. I ordered the grilled chicken grilled veggie salad. Got notification it would be delivered in 25mins. Well that quickly turned into 40mins.  Delivery arrived without the chicken!!! I was so perplexed because of well, the name of the business, i thought the chicken would be important  ya know like The main ingredient !?Anyway. I wasn't upset. Things happen. I called the restaurant to let the know the fucked up my order! It was at this point i got extremely annoyed and upset - i was told my order was taken from another location and to call them. Whyyyy do i ....  nvm after asking for the number i called the other restaurant and they couldn't even locate my order. So i guess there are magical hungry ppl just placing orders and receiving food to eat.  Idk. After going back n forth with the not so helpful rep. I had to touch base with Grubbhub. They figured it. My correct order was delivered 30mins later. I lost my appetite and didn't want the food any more. I tried to eat it tasted ok. But i just threw both orders away such a waste of money, time and tastebuds! Won't be happening again.  Thanks. But no thanks!! They're only getting A star because i can't post the review without it.",1,,
17,Matthew S.,"Princeton, NJ",1,9,2,4.0,3/8/2018,"I had a very interesting experience with this Chirping Chicken location when asked to deliver to my house about 5 blocks away. The expected wait time was about 25 to 30 minutes, and I was waiting patiently. I received a call at about the time my food would arrive, and it was from the restaurant. Apparently the hostess had heard the wrong address and the delivery man was across town. This bothered me, as I had recited my address to the establishment many times without fault. I then told them my actual address and then waited about twice the estimated wait time for my food to come. I would give this restaurant two stars, but the food was very well made with its own taste that separated it from any other American food place I had been to. The special sauce on the main burger was very original and had a spicy kick to it. Good food, bad service.",1,,
18,James B.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,7/3/2018,"OMG... You would think a place with a 100% Latino/Latina workforce at this place, someone would know how to make a decent tasting rice and beans. NOT!!! Goya from the can has better flavor than they do. The chicken thigh they served with the rice & beans was so damn dry I thought it was the breast meat leftover from yesterday. WTF? I also had the fried chicken wings that were just ok, not worth writing about though. They put the cold salad in the same takeout container with the hot fried chicken... who does that? FYI, nobody I know want to eat a warmed up salad! By the way, I chose not to eat that salad because I'm sure it wasn't properly washed after looking at it. I wouldn't eat there again even if they were the only thing open in my neighborhood! No, this was not my first or second time eating there. I like the food choices in my neighborhood, but ""NOT THIS ONE!"" Today was my last trip to that sorry ass chicken coop!",1,,
19,Richard N.,"Manhattan, NY",3,24,0,1.0,6/30/2018,"For starters, the food is good. Quite good.  The HUGE problem is that if you do take-out or delivery from this place, it needs to be checked VERY carefully.  Out of 6 times I've done this (4x take-out, 2x delivery) 4 of those times the order was wrong...all 4 times in their favor.  Missing items, sauce left out, 1/4 chicken instead of 1/2 chicken.",1,,
20,Heidi C.,"New York, NY",0,15,2,2.0,8/1/2017,"I ordered the chicken caesar salad with chicken via GrubHub. Instead what I got was something that looked like a house salad. Caesar salads have dont have tomatoes in it. And it's certainly NOT served with italian dressing. I called them and explained that I don't think I received the right order. The woman who answered the phone was a bit impatient but said that she wil send the right one. I asked her if she could make sure that there were 2 caesar dressings. I recieved my ""corrected"" order to realize they got it wrong again. Again with the tomatoes. In addition to that...she sent over 3 italian dressings...bruh.Either this woman is trolling me hard or she and chirping chicken have NO IDEA WHAT A CAESAR SALAD LOOKS LIKE.",1,,
21,Theresa E.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,3.0,4/28/2018,"My go to place for a good meal. However, the service at this location can be a crapshoot. When the manager is there, service is on point. When he's not? Cashiers with a hint of attitude, staff huddled behind the counter chatting with delivery men, and ultra loud music. Individual behind me got his large order, sat down, and finished it before I received my basic special of a half chicken with 1 side. Really? When I finally got my take-out order, it wasn't even mine. No apology for that, just attitude. What should have taken 5 minutes was more like 15 -20, and the place was nowhere near crowded. When you got somewhere to go, that's an eternity. Some people just can't be left unsupervised. I'll stick with the Hells Kitchen location. Much friendlier staff, and they get it right; even when the boss is away.",1,1,
22,Thomas E.,"Fort Worth, TX",283,236,225,4.0,4/8/2017,"Ordered to go from here and it was pretty good. I got the lamb gyro with a sweet potato on the side. The sweet potato was absolutely humungous (honestly it was probably at least 1 lb) and it was pretty good tasting too. The gyro was pretty tasty as well - could do with a bit more meat, but it was really tasty and not really expensive so I'm not complaining!",1,,
23,Mona C.,"New York, NY",1,5,0,1.0,8/29/2017,"I've ordered many times before from this restaurant and location and the food was delicious, but this time was different. I ordered 1/4 ribs and a quarter chicken. The food was cold when I received it, it wasn't as tasty. I usually get salad included but had to pay for it and it wasn't even an average size. No pita bread included. But what was the worst is that I found a long plastic thread in my food while eating the ribs. What I would've hoped to have been a delicious meal, turned out to be terrible. I threw it out. Won't be ordering from them ever again.",2,,
24,Felisha M.,"New York, NY",21,37,37,3.0,6/26/2017,"Food was okay, Ordered the chicken wings with fries. Nothing to rave about. I do love the location though. There wasn't any room for me and my sister to eat in so we walked down to Central Park and sat down to eat.",1,1,1
25,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,12/10/2015,"4.5 stars. Quick service, flavorful food and FANTASTIC prices,- especially considering how much food you get. Considering I've only been here once (oddly enough I haven't even been to the original CC location), I've conquered a number of menu items here and thus (don't judge me for using that word, just let me pretend to be highbrow for a quick sec) I feel entitled to write a review.Came here on a weeknight around 8/8:30 with a friend. We were both very hungry, hence (look I used both ""thus"" AND ""hence"" in a Yelp review...I really must be elite) the current familiarity with the menu. Nothing remarkable about the place itself. It's your typical fast casual eatery. Plenty of places to sit if you so desire, but you order at the register. Nice to have the option though. I think we waited about 15 minutes for the food, maybe a bit less. The staff here is awesome and notably patient (being ADD and indecisive can make ordering really really hard for me and exasperating for others), so they deserve a shout out here. For $9.50, you can get a high quality, delicious meal here. That's hard to find. I'll get to the other items I tried later, but for my main, I ordered the 1/4 chicken, which comes with pita, one hot side, and a side salad (I got mixed veggies). The chicken was really really yummy. Don't pitch the skin! I'm a health freak so my instinct is always to get rid of unnecessary extras  but it really does make the chicken that much better. I tried eating this with a knife and fork which was pretty much an exercise in futility. It's the opposite of boneless (which is a weirdly wordy way - alliteration - of saying it's served on the bone) so picking it up might be a better bet. But given that I use words like thus and hence in Yelp reviews (and just in general), I'm clearly the kind of person that would eat this with a knife and fork, right?The sides are served in separate containers, which I wasn't expecting but very much appreciated. If you decide you want to save the salad and/or your side for later and/or have leftovers, easy storage option there. And you can reuse as tupperware! ....which I only just realized now....dammit. I'll know for next time. I've also tried the guac here, which I'd highly recommend. It's not super salty and it's also served in a good-sized plastic container. It's not as salty as a lot of the guac I've tried, so you may or may not like it depending on your palette. Since a lot of the meals are served with pita, pretty much a no-brainer for us on this particular night. Lastly I'll speak to the plantains. I can't remember the last time I had an ACTUAL plantain. I mean, I've had it in chip form (which, coincidentally, is quite good with guac) plenty, but I'm talkin' good ole sweet plantains. I'd recommend these over the guac honestly, but it totally depends on what you're in the mood for. These just really hit the spot. This all being said, I have no idea what constitutes a ""well-cooked plantain"" and a ""badly-cooked plantain"" so maybe I'm not so refined after all. I'll just say these are Andy Dwyer's kind of awesomesauce. P.S. THEY DELIVER!",3,4,3
26,Paul L.,"San Jose, CA",5,6,0,5.0,5/30/2017,"I've been here many times because the food is high quality, especially the meat. I've also encountered many instances where my order was incorrect which was frustrating. I spoke with the manager about this who is a model for customer service. He sent me a larger edition of what I ordered last, except to my apartment, without charge. He was very polite and respectful. If all businesses put the same value and focus on customer service as these guys, they would be unstoppable (as long as the food was as good as this place too).

47,Fazli G.,"New York, NY",26,13,0,1.0,2/15/2017,"Food is ok, delivery service is horrible. Every time I've ordered there was something wrong or missing. Definitely not ordering from here again.",,,
48,Greg W.,"Manhattan, NY",2,54,77,2.0,1/28/2017,"Food is usually decent, but not reliably so.  Sometimes the chicken schwarma will have big chunks of fat.  Also their prices for ordering online are a good 20% higher than if you order over the phone.  Extremely inefficient and this contributes to slow delivery times of one hour or more.",,,
49,Mariangela H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/9/2016,"Unethical or questionable pricing for delivery. They charge more for the food when it is delivered and also when done on deliverydotcom they also add a ""$2 delivery fee"" i thought it was for the delivery boy but i was told that he does not receive those $2 (which would make sense because there is a section for tips in most delivery websites) and on top of that they charge $1 to $2 more per dish at least on deliverydotcom so they really get you.",,,
50,Susan G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,3/10/2016,"Good fast food - bbq chicken delish, salads fresh -sandwiches same. But - Big but for delivery -they tack on 1.50 charge which is ""for the store"" and ""most places do this"" according to person on phone. This is not part of delivery persons tip.  And No they don't - no other restaurant in this neighborhood surcharges delivery. So if ordering for crowd no biggie - but if small order makes it not worth it. End up paying $17for a 10 something sandwhich with tip. So chirping : change this stupid policy!",,,
51,C L.,"Los Angeles, CA",14,33,1,5.0,9/9/2015,"I  *LOVE* this place. Like, really love. Sometimes in New York you just want really simple, cheap but good food. Every meal doesn't need to be Balthazar. However, it's waaay more filling than Balthazar and cheaper. The chicken is my favorite, but the baby back ribs are good too. The French fries are bomb. And bonus: the owner, Jimmy, is so sweet, so nice. He sits in the corner, at a table so definitely say hello. The first time I came, I found out on my way over that my bank account had been compromised and couldn't use my card over the holiday. Not only did he give me the biggest hug, my dinner was on him. Can't recommend this place and it's owner more.",1,,
52,Daniel M.,"New York, NY",208,12,0,3.0,3/20/2016,This place is a bit pricey.. but overall quality is good. The burgers here are nothing special and the fries come soggy or cold when delivered. I gave them multiple chances on that and one of the times they even got my order wrong. Giving 3 stars because the chicken dishes (especially the salad) are really good and come with a good portion of chicken. Stick to the chicken with this one..,,,
53,Chris V.,"Manhattan, NY",103,7,0,5.0,12/4/2015,THE BEST RESTAURANT in the upper west side. GREAT SERVICE take out or dine in amazing chicken/burgers/salad/ buffalo wings/gyro just to name a few. Ask for the tostones only chirping chicken that offers. Also ask for JESSY tell her that Chris sent you.,,,
54,Sian R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,8/18/2015,Guys! Come on! You're at 106 and Columbus! Please extend your delivery radius more that ten blocks! What is that?! Your partner restaurant on Amsterdam delivers 30 blocks at least!,1,,
55,Jasmin P.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,10/7/2016,Amazing food I always get ribs or a chicken gyro ...I love coming here the customer service is on point. Will definitely come back.,,,
56,Amanda R.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,5.0,10/3/2016,I can honestly say this location never disappoints. Not only is it clean but the food and service are top notch. The prices can't be beat and the staff is overwhelmingly friendly. I recommend it to anyone I know who wants an amazing affordable meal.,,,
57,anthony r.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,5.0,10/3/2016,"So delicious! Great value for the money, food is clean and good, the best service and workers. Every time my family and I come here, we have a great meal. I recommend this to anybody looking for some good food!",,,
58,Colton M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,2.0,7/28/2015,"$9.75 for a large order of *spicy* ""Buffalo"" wings. Apparently that's 8 quite small breaded wings with a side of sauce that more closely resembles ketchup than anything remotely spicy...Only earns an extra star for being clean, and not having to order through bulletproof glass. Food quality however? You're better off at a Kennedy Fried Chicken.",,,

Updated review","I must have caught them on an off day when I first ordered.  After the owner responded, I gave them another shot and the food was amazing!  I have since become a regular customer.",,,
60,Ron S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,15,0,1.0,4/2/2016,Very disappointing. Chewy bland ribs. Flavorless chicken. Prefab onion rings. We used to have a Chirping Chicken close to us that was far far better. Will not order again from this branch.,,,
61,Charley F.,"New York, NY",4,34,1,5.0,9/3/2015,"OH MY GODDESS.  I went here for some plantains to sate some carb cravings, and went for a small order of wings too, because WINGS.  I was housesitting around the corner, and honestly just expecting divey gut-busting food, but no!  The wings were tender, juicy and delicious.  I made inappropriate noises while eating them, disturbing the gentle dog I was looking after.  So delicious.  The plantains!  Steamed to perfect tenderness.  Amazing.  I will sleep well tonight.  Thank you, Chirping Chicken!  Oh yes!  It's hot hot, and they gave me a free bottle of water while I waited for my order.  It's a classy joint!",1,,
62,Yas N.,"New York, NY",502,59,10,5.0,7/29/2015,"I've loved this establishment since I discovered the Amsterdam Avenue location while attending Equinox across the street. The lamb chops, grilled chicken sandwich, iced tea, and more are totally delicious. Even my old trainers love Chirping Chicken bc of the healthy selection. The menu is really large and even includes many Latin dishes that I appreciate. My friend and I loved our meals. This new location is really nice and has great AC which is really essential in this heat. Try it out - I think you'll be satisfied! Oh and the staff is as nice as at the flagship location too :)",1,,
63,Madison A.,"Manhattan, NY",208,1,0,1.0,2/7/2016,"terrible wings 0/10 they taste like a undercooked toupee. they are cold, slimy, tough, not juicy at all, and partly burnt. i threw them at my dog and he woudlnt eat them. i threw them at a rat in the subway and it almost threw up. terrible. f you chirping chicken and your slimy wings",,,
