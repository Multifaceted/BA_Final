0,Curtis B.,"New York, NY",2,11,1,5.0,8/9/2018,Went there for the first time after visiting the LIC store. Food is freshly made by accommodating  staff. Prices are good too. Worth a visit to either store.,,,
1,Nicola M.,"Donabate, Republic of Ireland",3,4,0,5.0,5/27/2018,"By far the cheapest place in Time Square to get food.Great selection of food from fresh salad, pasta, ribs, Chinese food. Great for a quick snack have to pop in and Macy's.",,,
2,Wang Z.,"Irvine, CA",0,2,0,5.0,9/5/2018,this is a really convenient food court. I like the spaghetti and the fruit there. The price is reasonable. Good place for travelers who are rush on time .,,,
3,Jeanine G.,"Dumont, NJ",0,11,3,5.0,2/19/2018,I absolutely love this place the food is consistently good and the staff is always super friendly. Those two are not a good combination in New York City however somehow as busy as as place always is they make it work. This is my favorite go-to spot for breakfast on the Run lunch room ready to sit down or dinner to take for the bus ride home to Jersey,2,,
4,Kamal H.,"Dearborn, MI",0,29,0,3.0,7/15/2018,"Very good food but da service could be alot better. I always eat here when i visit & we wanted to order 6 sandwiches and asked him to clean da grill and he refused. What kind of service is that, & da manager didnt even help us. So we walked out & i dont plan on goin back anymore.....",,,
5,Tanvir A.,"Woodside, NY",0,2,0,5.0,1/15/2018,It was dream come true in the heart of  times square. I was hungry and wanted to use the bathroom and at the same time was looking to sit with my family and enjoy some good food.  TSQ food Court  was surely affordable for a place located in the heart times square  in New York city. My whole family of 5 was very happy enjoying their great food and pastries. Great place to visit once again.,,1,1
6,Shane L.,"Las Vegas, NV",2,15,3,5.0,10/9/2017,"As Tourists, this a great place to buy amenities--water, snacks, packaged pastries, fruit, salad, etc. it's like a small grocery store/deli. Prices are very reasonable. The establishment is clean and the staff is welcoming. It's also a good place to catch a bite to eat. The deli makes everything fresh and serves Boars Head luncheon meat. We had breakfast here (about $3-$10/person depending what you order), as a break from the over priced hotel breakfasts.  Also, I noticed that the local NYC workers would come here to eat or buy items too (which for me is a good sign).",4,1,1
7,Delaney H.,"Woodstock, GA",226,16,2,5.0,4/4/2018,Delicious and quick!!! Thanksgiving sandwich to die for and the veggie burger was more than to die for!! Highly recommend,2,,
8,Daniel B.,"New York, NY",4,40,3,5.0,5/18/2017,Right when you walk in you immediately know this place is clean.  Its 24 hours.  The space is new but the owner and his trustful employees are seasoned pros.  Their salads are reasonably priced considering how other places are simply rip offs.  Their seating is limited because its really a takeout place.  What really is great is their service.  Ask for Tony and he'll make you an amazing sandwich!,3,1,
