0,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",20,75,77,5.0,11/16/2018,My cousin is a New Yorker and she recommended this brunch spot! We waited in line for almost an hour for a table and it was worth the wait!! The food is excellent and extremely tasty. We ordered several things for the table and decided to share! Service is slow as it was very crowded. So expect to wait in line and then to wait for your server for every single thing! But we forgot about the wait when we got our food as it is definitely worth the hype! Would recommend this spot to other Yelpers!,,,
1,Alina V.,"New York, NY",237,246,591,4.0,11/16/2018,"Ive been to this location as well as their west village one multiple times, this one definitely gets a lot more crowded than the other. Nonetheless my friends and I ended up coming Â here for brunch last weekend and ended up waiting an hour for a table. Luckily it wasnt too cold yet outside but if you do come here be prepared to wait outside for your table. The location is very small inside so not many can be seated at a time. Once we finally sat down we had a nice experience, I started with a latte which was presented beautifully and I love their sugar packets on the table with cute sayings. We got the grilled haloumi cheese for the table with warm sliced grapes and it was delicious! I highly recommend this to everyone, especially if you've never had haloumi before. My friend and I ended up splitting the breakfast bowl and chicken prego sandwich. The bowl was great and came with 2 poached eggs, quinoa, kale, spaghetti squash, grilled tomatoes, and avacado and a spicy avacado dressing on the side. I was a bit worried about flavor since these ingredients tend to be bland on their own but to my delight everything was seasoned perfectly and balanced very well together. The chicken prego sandwich came with grilled chicken, watercress, and an aioli on a roll. It was good, nothing too special though. It also comes with a side of fries (or an arugala salad) which were crispy and delicious! My friend also got the chicken kebab over couscous and a cucumber tomato salad which she enjoyed. Our waitress was great, very attentive and the food came out very quickly. Overall, great brunch, just be prepared to wait a while for a table at peak brunch times.",4,,
2,Sheila G.,"Seattle, WA",433,52,196,3.0,11/9/2018,"I feel like this is more of a brunch spot than dinner. I read a bunch of great reviews for this place for brunch so thought it would transfer well for the dinner menu too. It was good, but not as amazing as I was expecting based on other reviews. I got the cauliflower dish to start with which if I had that any other day I'd think it was amazing. However, I just had an amazing cauliflower dish and now nothing compares to it. I was hopeful though. I also got the pasta special and the rib eye special. Both were good! But the value of the food for the price didn't match up in my mind. I would be willing to pay $30-40 for a dish if it were exceptional. This was good, but only good. The cocktails were top notch though. And I liked the spot. Not to say I wouldn't ever come back here, but there are other places I'd rather go with similar food options.",2,,1

Updated review","I have no idea why this spot is so popular. It's good, but is it really remarkable? Anyhow, I came on a Tuesday morning at 1030 and already the place was full and we had to wait 5-10 minutes for our table. You're sitting shoulder to shoulder at this restaurant, so it's either the best or worst place to be overheard at depending on your perspective.I ordered the spaghetti squash entree with crusted tofu. It was pretty tasty, the spaghetti squash was definitely cooked in a decent amount of butter but there was some freshness from the julienned radishes.",,1,1
4,Fatoma R.,"Long Island, NY",24,138,402,3.0,10/13/2018,"Came here for brunch with my friend on a Friday. It was super crowded, they also don't take reservations which was a little annoying. Spot is a little small- they definitely cram people in there. There's also an open bar that you can sit at. The staff was friendly, we actually ended up sitting there for a while and got caught up in our talk and they let us sit there for quite some time. I wasn't a huge fan of their latte- tasted a little burnt to me. Loved their waffle- it had a hint of rose water in it- not an overwhelming flavor but just the right amount! My friend had one of their bowls- she was happy with it and and the portion size was fair.The food was good for brunch but I just didn't find it worth the wait. The menu had cute graphics, and the sugar packets also have cute messages printed on the sugar packets.",1,,
5,Janice K.,"Manhattan, NY",36,53,84,5.0,9/15/2018,"Mediterranean breakfast: Poached eggs, avocado, pita bread and salad $12 very reasonably priced brunchLoved it. We also got the green shakshuka. Reminds me of green salsa with egg. What made it was that creamy green ""hot"" sauce they called it. Its amazing. It makes everything wonderful.Vibe is good. Service is good. No wait for 2ppl. Went on sat around 11am. Very reasonable. Loved it",3,,
6,Shaun M.,"St. Louis, MO",42,36,14,4.0,11/15/2018,"Small place inside, super friendly staff, food comes out quickly and solid prices in SoHo. We had the chicken kebab and cheeseburger. The kebab was good and had a spicy sauce for dipping. The cheeseburger was smaller than a normal burger but high quality meat, friend onion and delicious roasted tomato on the burger. It came with a good portion of hot fries. They have a nice size selection of alcohol for a cozy place. It is a good stop when in SoHo.",,,
7,Natacha G.,"Montreal, Canada",52,36,58,3.0,9/4/2018,"Honestly this place is way too hyped up! We were lucky we didn't wait longer than 10-15 mins to get a table. From what I heard the wait time can sometimes go up to 45 mins, ridiculous!At least we had a pretty spacious table, every other table was stuck to each other and they had no privacy. Other than that, the service was pretty good but the food was quite mediocre and pricey for what it was... we weren't full after bfast which was kind of a waste. I would just not go if I were you, sooooo many other amazing brunch places in nyc that are prettier and have better food for a fraction of the price!",1,1,2
8,Isabelle C.,"New York, NY",439,99,348,4.0,10/20/2018,"the concept behind this place is too cute, being inspired by an immigrant love story and aiming to emulate family hospitality in their business. and it sure is apparent upon walking into the cozy space: waiters were singing happily, and little details like hand-sketched menus and custom sugar packets added a personal touch.food is your standard breakfast but with a mediterranean spin. i went with the classic platter ($13), and every ingredient was so fresh; the labne was the perfect zing to complement the egg + avo + salad mixture going on. a little more on the meh side was the rosewater waffle ($13), which was a bit lacking in both rose and fruit. but when in doubt go with the green shakshuka ($12), a tangy take on the normally spicy dish in a traditional middle eastern meal -- SO refreshing!just a tip if dining in the colder months: try to request a table towards the back if possible, even if it means enduring your hunger for a few more minutes! i can't remember if they had a sidewalk vestibule, but the fact that i'm unsure just goes to show how much they need a (new) one. the wind hits the whole first half of the room HARD, which made for a shivering experience. obviously the weather isn't anyone's fault, but perhaps it's time for a better solution!and as a side note if you don't know who freda is, you need to check out the pics i attached. the resemblance between her and the restaurant's iconic logo is uncanny, and i appreciate that LOL.",2,,6
9,Song P.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",70,17,5,5.0,11/18/2018,"This place is definitely worth the hype. We came at 3 pm and the wait was 30 mins. Ordered a bunch of stuff: green shakshuka (3.5/5), rose water waffle (5/5), prego roll (5/5), duck bacon (3.5/5). Everything was so tasty. Would definitely come back. The food quality was top notch. We ate so much but didn't feel incomfortable. The place was a bit loud though so keep that in mind if you are noise sensitive.",,,
10,Charlene L.,"Chicago, IL",233,370,623,4.0,11/18/2018,"I missed my opportunity to come here for brunch as I hear that is the main attraction. Yet, I still didn't want to miss the chance to try this place out. Very cute and unassuming; tight spaces so get ready to get cozy with other diners. I started with the roasted cauliflower served with a creamy garlic sauce and topped with capers. This was so incredibly simple yet delicious! The charred texture of the cauliflower made it a perfect warm dish in the cold weather, while still feeling hearty enough even though it was a vegetable. The garlic sauce paired with the capers were a nice touch as it added a dash of pickled flavoring but also brought out the nuttiness of the dish. Caution- it felt like there was a lot of cream sauce so I'd recommend to go lighter on it. I also tried the peri-peri chicken and as it came out I didn't have high hopes as it looked dry. What fooled me was that beneath the dry spiced rub was a juicy roasted chicken that was full of heat (spice) and flavor! Wow, wow, wow! Taking bites of the chicken with the cucumber, tomato, and onion chopped salad it came with and man, this was a winner. I was so full but couldn't stop eating. The menu looks simple but after trying this place out I get why it's so popular; the flavors are unbelievable and this place is a great example of making wholesome and simple food really stand out.",2,,2
11,Dennis W.,"San Francisco, CA",767,357,1072,4.0,8/7/2018,"Located in Lower Manhattan on Lafayette street, the wait for Brunch on a Saturday morning can be quite long(as you might expect). The wait for our group of 5 to be seated was close to an hour. However, once you're seated and you peruse the menu, you might realize you made the right decision in waiting. The interior is cute and simple, but the spacing between chairs is very tight as in the staff may inadvertently bump into your back every time they walk by(especially if you're seated in the middle bench area as I was). I went with a popular choice, the Madame Freda(Pressed sandwich with duck prosciutto, cheddar bÃ©chamel, gruyere & a fried egg), and we all shared a few sides like the House Cured Duck Bacon and Fries. First off, the Madame Freda was heaven. The duck, gruyere, and egg's textures blended beautifully without any of the flavors overpowering each other. I have never tried cured duck bacon but if you're a fan of bacon you must give this one shot at least. I washed it all down with a glass of their fresh watermelon juice, which was solid and recommended. Our waitress was quick and accurate. All of the staff moved with a motivated frenetic energy. Are there a a host of brunch options in Manhattan? Of course there are but Madame Freda should be near the top of your list.",16,10,14
12,Hee Y.,"New York, NY",344,220,815,4.0,8/18/2018,"Came at around 1PM on a Friday. There were two other 2 person groups ahead of me, but we were all seated very quickly. There's a long table in the center of the restaurant, and the hostess proceeded to seat each 2 person group across from each other at this long table. I've come by this restaurant on a weekday at 12PM, and the line was out the door. This place is definitely noisy, packed, and full of movement. I called the day before, and the hostess said they serve breakfast until 5PM and then switch over to the dinner menu. My friend and I shared the Green Shakshuka ($12), Madame Freda ($18), house-cured duck bacon ($7) and fresh watermelon juice ($7). If you wonder, like I do, if a dish will be too much for one person, rest assured that the portion size is really made for one person to eat. I think I can comfortably say you could order another dish to share or dessert afterwards and you'd be fine. I would recommend the Madame Freda, the runny yolk and prosciutto and cheese taste great. On the website, it says you need to have a party of 6+ to reserve. If you have two people in your group, I think you're fine.",1,1,
13,Angela T.,"Manhattan, NY",26,145,146,4.0,8/8/2018,Trendy and buzzing. Â Delicious brunch food.Had the sandwich with egg and duck prosciutto.The volume is super loud here though and the tables are very tight. Had no wait issue but was there at 940am on a Saturday. I like more spacious places for brunch but this was fun. Service pretty good.,2,,
14,Camille H.,"Brooklyn, NY",162,453,363,3.0,8/5/2018,"Really don't get the appeal and hype. I went here on a saturday morning with a friend and put our names on the list. We were told it would be an hour wait and to check back in 45 minutes. This was pretty accurate.Given the long wait time I figured there must be something super special about this place - their food, drinks, service, decor?Nope. I had a hard time picking out a dish to eat. I settled on the freda dish (any meal with the name of the place has to be good right?) and the special duck sausage they had that day (normally not available).It was good, but it was literally the only thing I would want on the menu. Anyway, the service was ok and we sat outside (it was a hot day so I preferred to be outdoors but the people who are waiting to get in definitely gawk!)",2,1,1
15,Vivian W.,"Los Angeles, CA",194,2,2,1.0,11/16/2018,"I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but it seems inconceivable that $30.13 could be mistyped as $41.13. Also already gave 20% tip on a solo lunch meal. Just a heads up to future customers who dine here, to make sure the charge on their credit card statement matches the cost of the meal.",,,
16,Jessica L.,"New York, NY",24,5,3,3.0,10/21/2018,"The kind hostess told me it would be about an hour wait when I got there on a Sunday at 1230pm, but it ended up being only a 40 minute wait. She greeted us very warmly and made me feel welcomed on my first visit here. I ordered the Madame Freda and the food came out almost right away. The decor is pretty cute, but it does get very cramped in the restaurant. By the time it was the end of our meal, there were empty tables near us. My friend who ordered a $5 latte did say it was on the smaller side when it came out.The only thing I didn't like about it was that they don't do split checks, which is kinda annoying to be honest. I was surprised when they told me that.",,1,
17,Ameya B.,"New York, NY",393,270,445,4.0,7/18/2018,"Me and the Mrs. checked out this place in a weekday for lunch. We were here a little late in the afternoon at around 3:45 pm and were seated right away on a community table.My only complaint with this place is the limited space. It's just too tight and the staff would brush against my back every time they were serving to the tables behind me. Got a little annoying towards the end.Foodwise, an absolutely amazing place. We went to the Lafayette location and ordered Chicken Kebab ($16) and Chicken Prego ($14). Both were really delicious. The spicy, green sauce that came with Chicken Kebab was absolutely delicious.Service was excellent and the entire staff is very welcoming.",4,,2
18,Red C.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",0,32,60,4.0,10/10/2018,Found this place on instagram. Great place to grab breakfast and brunch. They offer all day breakfast until 5 pm. The service was amazing. They have very nice waitress and waiters. The food was greats. The restaurant is small but cozy. I waited for 30 mins before seated. Definitely worths a try. A bit pricy but still acceptable considering the quality of the food and service.,,,1
19,Yoandra V.,"Northridge, CA",79,138,555,5.0,7/6/2018,"My friend and I bumbled into Jack's Wife Freda and even at 9:30am, this place was packed. We were lucky enough that the bar was had 2 empty seats and upon sitting there a friendly gentleman served us an endless supply of water. I wanted to eat healthy this morning so I went with the mediterranean breakfast which comes with eggs, yogurt, pita bread and chopped salad. This is not normally what I would have for breakfast but it was very filling and delicious as well. My friend got the rosewater waffle which came with fruit and rosewater syrup. She doesn't like waffles but she enjoyed it. I tried some and they have a really good batter. The batter was perfect.I like how they have cute sayings on their sugar packets like ""Dude, sweet"" or ""I love you a latte."" They even have a cookbook, a tote bag for sale if you want to take something home as a souvenir. As for the venue, it is very small and can get extremely crowded so for anyone in a group, I highly recommend making a reseveration in advance. By the time we left, there was a big line of people waiting to get in. Also, for any tourists, please leave backpacks at home as the aisles are very cramped and this prevents bags from hitting people. But the food and the service makes this place worth it and it explains why there is a big line outside at brunch time.",8,5,6
20,Krupa G.,"New York, NY",5,66,35,5.0,11/9/2018,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday - super packed just like their West Village location, which is surprisingly a little bigger than the SoHo location. Sitting in tight close quarters can be a little claustrophobic, but the food and service makes it worthwhile. Started off with the fresh cantaloupe juice which was delicious. We ordered the chicken kabob with couscous and side of hot sauce, which was delicious. I could eat that everyday and never be tired of it. Highly recommended and you never leave unsatisfied.",,,
21,Enrique V.,"San Diego, CA",207,318,29,5.0,10/9/2018,Came here for breakfast today and truly enjoyed our meal. We both ordered the Mediterranean breakfast and it was really good. I would definitely like to come back and try some other dishes I'm sure they won't disappoint either. If you're in SOHO and looking for a good breakfast spot this is the place to go.,,,
22,Hanah L.,"Arcadia, CA",413,28,47,4.0,10/18/2018,"Came here on a Thursday afternoon in a party of 6-we had expected the wait to be much longer, but it was only about 30 minutes. The staff was extremely nice in informing us where we were on the waitlist and giving us updates on our table.For those looking for an aesthetic location and decent food for a meal, this is a great place. Plating is beautiful and the ambience of the restaurant was very homey. I got the rosewater waffle and was pleased with the light floral taste of the waffle with the touch of sweetness from the honey syrup. My friends tried a variety of dishes, from the egg shashuka to the eggplant sandwich. Was it good? Yes. Not sure if this is somewhere I'd crave, but definitely a good spot for a casual brunch (and for that great Instagram shot).",,,
23,Aishwarya S.,"Brooklyn, NY",39,74,129,4.0,9/27/2018,I really like this place for lunch or brunch. The ambience is very romantic and happy. The waitresses here are very friendly and pretty. The food is amazing too. Basically all restaurants in SOHO have a cool vibe to them. I had the peri peri chicken and it was peri peri good! The cauliflower appetizer was meh not the best I had. I had the freshly squeezed watermelon juice and it was so fresh and tasted exactly like how watermelon juice is supposed to taste.,,,
24,Angel J.,"Brooklyn, NY",395,101,67,4.0,9/23/2018,"Came here on a Tues afternoon with my girlfriends. It was pretty packed but the wait wasn't so long. For a party of 3, we waited around 15 minutes. I wouldn't suggest this place for big parties. The space we were given was so cramped. We ordered a Mediterranean breakfast, rosewater waffle, and Jack's breakfast. The food was great and the service was great. For brunch, it is a bit more expensive than other places that I've been to but what do you expect for a brunch spot right by Soho.",,,
25,Biana G.,"Brooklyn, NY",424,71,57,3.0,9/23/2018,"The concept and decor of Jack's Wife Freda is very cute and cozy, but unfortunately the food is subpar. I've been here twice now and other than obsessing over the puns on the sugar packets, I'd say my experience was pretty mediocre. The restaurant is waaaay too tight.. you're basically sharing a table and conversation with strangers adjacent to you. The food was also not overly impressive - Over my visits, I have tried the green shakshuka, Madame Freda, pouches eggs with grilled tomato and haloumi and the side of house cured duck bacon. The portions are kind of small and overpriced!! In my opinion there are waaaay better brunch spots in NYC.",,,
26,Gloria T.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,40,709,4.0,9/10/2018,"One of the best brunch places I ever been to. They don't take reservation (unless a party of 6+) so go early and claim your spot. The wait was close to 35-40 mins for two people on Saturday. We were seated outside on a hot and sunny day but good thing it was under the shade. The Rosewater Waffles were so good, the Green Shakshuka stood out and tasted pretty good too. Only thing that wasn't too good was the skirt steak for Jack's Breakfast. It tasted overly cooked when we asked for medium rare. But other than that I would go back again.",1,,1
27,Daniel B.,"Vernon Hills, IL",200,190,57,2.0,9/12/2018,"I've been to Jack's Wife Freda twice now in the span of 5 years, and its never struck me as being much more than alright. It's got a cute, packed atmosphere, where you may find yourself rubbing elbows with the table next to you on a busy Sunday. I'd come early or you might find yourself with a bit of a wait. The menu has some interesting dishes, like Shakshouka and Rose Water Waffles, which happen to be the two items I ordered on my trips. The Shakshouka was decent, albeit a bit small. I enjoyed the bread that came with it, as it was fun to soak up all the leftover sauce. The waffle was utterly disappointing. I'm not sure what exactly the rosewater added to it, or perhaps it was undiscernible to my tongue, but the waffle was bland and boring. The reason its been such a long time between my two trips is due to the negative impression this waffle left on me. Jack's also isn't very light on the wallet, so unfortunately I've never left feeling very full. I'm not sure if I'd return to Jack's as I feel there are simply better places in New York for brunch.",1,,
28,Julie C.,"Manhattan, NY",346,35,205,3.0,6/15/2018,"Came here with a couple coworkers for lunch on a Friday. We knew it was a super hyped up spot, so we came at 11:15 and waiting about 20 minutes for a table for 3 -- not too bad of a wait, and the host was pretty nice.For lunch, my coworkers had the Mediterranean breakfast and the burger, and I had the chicken kebab. We also order watermelon juices and a side of duck bacon. The kebab comes with cous cous and a cucumber / tomato salad. I'd say it was a pretty tasty meal for a weekday lunch, but nothing THAT great. The kebab comes with a small cup of green sauce which was really tasty. I suppose it was reasonably priced at $15, but I don't know if it was really that worth it.In terms of a quick weekday lunch, Jack's wife Freda was pretty good, but nothing to write home about, especially with the long wait. I'd recommend other places if you're looking for a good weekday lunch, or a special place to have brunch.",1,,1
29,Hana M.,"Brampton, Canada",203,65,212,5.0,6/24/2018,An NYC staple. It's Friday Brunch and it has been a 45 min wait. Which is totally fine cause you're here to have a good time with friends and eat good food. I wanted a light brunch/lunch so I got their seasonal fruit crumble pie/tart(???). SO GOOD. Very homey and went perfect with their brewed coffee. And the Labne/tart yogurt quenelle was a great touchWould go back for sure,,,1
30,Sarah G.,"Huntington Woods, MI",398,325,89,4.0,9/9/2018,Last day in NYC. Flying at at 4pm and ALL I wanted was a good weekday brunch. Do you know how hard it is to find a midweek brunch?? I was shocked! Maybe I should open up an all day brunch place because they are pretty hard to find.ANYWAYS...So many people had told me to check this place out so I was ecstatic when we only had about a 10 minute wait. Yes. The tables are all pretty cramped together but thats pretty typical for the city...right? I feel like everything is relatively simple - yet refined. I ordered the poached eggs with grilled tomato and haloumi (and the house cured duck bacon - because DUH) and my husband ordered the prego roll. Everything was super fresh and seasoned perfectly. Our server was overly nice and attentive (I have seen complaints about the service so I wanted to point out how awesome our service was). The interior is cute and simple and the perfect backdrop for any instagram photo. This place was the perfect end to our trip. I would 100% come back.,,,1
31,Julie C.,"Queens, NY",37,94,173,3.0,5/23/2018,"Came around 1pm on a Wednesday afternoon and just to our luck there was a table for two! As soon as we were seated the server brought over waters as we looked at the menu. They offer a variety of items on the menu such as salads, burgers, waffles, etc. My friend and I got the following:Green Shakshuka($12)- we both got the Green Shakshuka and this came with two baked eggs and was served with challah bread. The ratio of shakshuka to bread was a bit off because by the time we finished the bread we still had a lot of shakshuka left. We ended up asking for more bread, which costed extra...The dish tasted decent but the portion size was small and we were still hungry after this. House Cured Duck Bacon($7)- this side came with 4 pieces of sliced bacon. It was a bit too salty for my taste but I would order again. This is a great side if you're looking to share something!The space inside is pretty cramped. There are tables on the sides and one communal table in the middle. The noise volume is extremely loud and I felt like I had to scream over other people just to have a conversation with my friend. Had higher expectations for this place and having paid $40 I would have thought I would be leaving this place full.",4,,2
32,Kenny N.,"Houston, TX",329,62,108,5.0,5/17/2018,"This is a great restaurant to stop by and grab some brunch. Be warned, there is quite a wait due to it's popularity. The wait is worth it. My girlfriend and I waited for about 15-20 minutes until a table was available. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The burger was juicy and the fries were crisp. The kabob was also juicy and the rice that came with the dish was also delicious. The size of the restaurant was very small so it felt kind of cluttered. Still, worth it.",4,,
33,Shayan S.,"Oakland, CA",24,187,79,5.0,9/2/2018,"This is such a lovable neighborhood gem. It's worth traveling for too.I arrived around 1:15 and they said it would be a 45 minute wait. We put our names down, went to Joe and the juice for some juice, and checked back 20 minutes later and were seated. So not bad at all!It has a flair of Middle East to the food which I love. I got the Madam Freda and my friend got the Rosewater Pancakes. Both were really delicious. I love their cute menu, and the interior is nothing notable, just packed full of people. It's not a place with a lot of pretense which it totally can considering it's neighborhood, but thats why It's so popular I think. There's no frills, really down to earth humble eatery that makes really good food. The Duck bacon was truly delicious. And their watermelon margaritas were really refreshing :) Staff was fantastic too.Def coming back again.",,,2
34,Sue T.,"Montclair, NJ",55,25,23,3.0,9/23/2018,"Came here for lunch.The place is very popular on social media and yelp so decided to give it a try. Had to wait about 20 mins for table on a Friday and when we finally did get seated (it was 3 of us) we got a corner table where we barely had room. Our portions were very small but overall good. The ambience is very chill and cozy since all the tables are so close together. While it's a cute place I don't think it's a place I recommend going back just because of the wait time, portions and overall prices of the meal. My ratings is completely based off on the quality of the food and the lemonade. All were good just wish the portions / plates were bigger!Side note: I got the chicken kebab, with couscous and chopped salad.",,,
35,Amy V.,"New York, NY",189,42,38,3.0,10/21/2018,"I've heard a lot about this place and I've seen a lot of my friends come here over the years. Needless to say, I was pretty excited to try this place out. The interior is really cute and pretty small so there is usually a wait! We probably waited around 20 minutes which wasn't bad at all. They have a menu outside so you can decide on what you want to order so you don't have to spend a lot of time in the restaurant doing that. They don't take reservations which is fine and all but I wish I got to leave my phone number with my name so that I could so some window shopping while waiting. Instead, we kind of just awkwardly stood there. However, the that is not the reason why I knocked off two stars. It's more because the food is really mediocre and not anything special. We ordered eggs benedict and the avocado toast with fries. The presentation looked cute and surely pic worthy but when we ate it, it was just meh. My friend finished the eggs benedict and was definitely not even a bit full. The portion size for that is really small (compared to their other items). The avocado toast was good and the fries were crispy at least. The price of the food seemed reasonable ($13 ish) but it left a lot to be desired so I don't think it was worth it. The food wasn't terrible, but it doesn't really leave an impression and I don't have any plans of going back. This is the kind of place that you would try once for the experience/hype, but not really come back.",1,,
36,Teresa V.,"New York, NY",153,170,808,3.0,4/29/2018,"Jack's Wife Freda is more than a bit hyped by Instagram. We were seated fairly fast and service was attentive and friendly throughout our time. The crab cakes were my favorite part of this dining experience and may have led me to be too eager for the entrees that they ended up being a let down. Upon taking my first bite into the Madame Freda, I found a piece of paper in the cheese. We brought this to the staff's attention and they apologized and even offered to make me a new one. I turned down the offer since it was just paper, plus small things like that can happen with a busy kitchen. I wouldn't recommend this dish, however, if you're not huge on cheese. I imagined this dish to look a bit different when I ordered it and it came out a bit too cheesy for dinner. Maybe if it was on a different bread than it would have been a better experience. The Prego Roll was a bigger let down. The meat was great, slight bit chewy, but good nonetheless. My wish is that the roll lasted longer. It was the size of a slider, and, similar to the Madame Freda, probably would have been better on a different bread. If it was served on a baguette then it would have been A+!Overall, a lovely place but don't come in with high expectations for dinner. Breakfast and lunch, on the other hand, can be a different story. Would love to come back to give them another try since service was bomb.",2,,2

I don't think I've had a ""breakfast"" duck prosciutto sandwich like this one anywhere else... certainly haven't found it in Philly yet. The hostess was extremely accommodating and doing everything she could to get us in there as quick as possible on a freezing weekend. She made sure to keep circling back and checking up on us outside even tried her best to switch around parties and seatings inside. As always one of the best brunch meals! Worth the wait if you're not afraid to basically be sitting with the parties next to you.",2,,2
42,Amy Z.,"Chicago, IL",725,239,403,3.0,3/11/2018,"Delicious food negated by the rude service. Our server was Cody according to the bill, a young lady with striped shirt and a cute accent. She hurriedly swung by to check on us, but had turned her head away before she even finished her own sentence ""How is everything?"" It happened again later: she grabbed my fork and knife, and only then asked, ""Are you done?"" - as my plate was swiftly taken away. I understand their business model requires efficiency - the reasonable prices & filling portions have to be coupled with tight spaces and fast turnovers. But Cody had a flat affect and never cracked a smile.The green shakshuka was very watery and disappointing. But the Prego Roll was spot-on with generous portions of tender medium steak tips and lightly garlic-buttered toast. The Madame Freda, served with duck prosciutto, was a tasty spin on Croque Madame and the definite winner at the table. We ended by sharing a rosewater waffle which was a subtly aromatic and sweet closure to the meal.",3,,2
43,Natisha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",190,209,102,4.0,3/9/2018,"Jack's Wife Freda is a solid 4 out of 5 stars. Â The plates are so delicious that I had to buy the cookbook today. Â I was a little nervous to stop in because the majority of the reviews here appear to be for breakfast or brunch only. Â Some other review I read from a popular publication said that you shouldn't even bother coming for dinner (even though they didn't mention that they'd tried). Â But I figured, if it has all these rave reviews for breakfast, why wouldn't dinner be just as good? Â And guess what: I'm right. Â Not only am I right, I'm glad I didn't come for breakfast because 1) I don't have time to wait and 2) that's kinda basic. Â At 7pm the wait was 10 minutes. Â The restaurant is as big as my one bedroom apartment and seems to fit about 50 people. Â Pretty intimate. Â It was loud as hell. Â For some reason, I couldn't hear my friend talking when she was standing next to me, but I could hear perfectly fine when we got to our table. Â It was huge relief that we weren't at the communal table, it just seemed like it'd be a bit much.Anywhoo, me Â and my friend split everything and had a good old time. Â Got the chicken shnitzel, the lamb and eggplant 'lasagne' and the flourless chipotle chocolate cake. Â Everything was good as heck. Â Portion was decent and the flavor was really refreshing and unusual without being overwhelming.It can be a bit pricey to frequent if you're on a budget, but the nice thing is that you can get the cookbook and try things out at home. Â So I'm gonna do that.",3,,2
44,Katie H.,"New York, NY",354,204,100,4.0,3/25/2018,"Would rate this l place a solid 4 stars. Stopped by with a friend for brunch today at 1 pm on a Sunday and had to wait 45 min for a table. We sat down and was immediately greeted by a friendly waitress who took our drink orders. The space is small and crowded, but I would characterize it as homey and the space had a local feel to it, despite the number of tourists that probably were there as well. I decided to order the grilled eggplant baguette with fries and my friend ordered the chicken prego. I thought that my meal was solid, with great flavor and high quality ingredients; however, I am not sure if the food lived up to the hype. There was nothing outstanding about it. There are many restaurants out there (ruby cafe) that have a similar concept and a similar menu and I am not sure if I would be willing to wait close to an hour again. Overall, good vibes, great food, but there was not anything that justified the hype or the wait.",1,,
45,Jenni K.,"Los Angeles, CA",177,255,277,2.0,2/12/2018,"Cute brunch place, heard about it from many brunch-loving friends. I expected the food to blow me away, but it was just alright. The place is a tight squeeze so don't bring any big bags! I went during lunch on Monday and there was still a 10 minute wait. I tend to review the service as much as the food, and the lady who greeted us when we first walked in confused the heck out of me. She just kind of mumbled and walked away...so I had to go to her again and ask her how long the wait was because there were three tables open and she didn't take our name down or anything. Anyways, when it came to the menu, there were many things I wanted to try. Super cute menu by the way. I wasn't too hungry so I got the GREEN SHAKSHUKA (two baked eggs in a green tomatillo shakshuka). It was really bland...super womp on that one. Everything is obviously overpriced...$7 for a cantaloupe juice?! Boyfriend got the JACK'S BURGER which he said was yummy, but way too small (for $16). The fries were good though.I don't know if I'll come back...maybe I'll try the other things but they just seem so overpriced for the portions.",5,5,2

My latestvisit was earlier this week for a late breakfast- around 10am. It's a rather small restaurant with a communal table in the middle and multiple tables for 2 surrounding. The green shashuka is delicious, as are the rose water waffles, haloumi and duck bacon. Definitely get the duck bacon! The bottomless coffee never hurt anyone either. This is a very reasonably priced restaurant compared to Manhattan standards, and it never disappoints! The only annoying thing is that they do not take reservations unless you have a party of at least 6. Larger parties are usually seated at the communal table in the middle, and it looks like it could get crowded. I only waited about 10 minutes for a table for 2, but then again it was a weekday.

51,Ayumi W.,"San Francisco, CA",394,175,325,4.0,1/23/2018,"Here's a tip: get a group of 6+ and make a reservation for brunch! The line is loooong if you come here during prime time business hours and I don't recommend you wait this long. It's good food-but don't wait an hour plus for it. You're in NYC--and heck if you're waiting outside it's probably a nice day and if it's not then stop waiting--enjoy the city! There are plenty of other places to eat. I got the Grilled Tomato and Halloumi with Avocado and poached eggs. They were delicious but I do wish they served more bread. Not enough for all the halloumi and tomatoes they give you. Also I get the decor aspect of the bread on the side but from a utility standpoint, it's not doing so much for me. But another tip, with this dish standing at $14 you can get your budget friendly version at Cafe Mogador in the East Village, which serves the same for $10 (I was just craving this one today so caved in on the higher price)The cappuccino is good - yes they have almond milk- left me shaky which means you know it's got the caffeine overload Atmosphere wise- as a group of six you're crammed into the center at a picnic-style table. Â I was rubbing up against my neighbor my entire meal, so it's not the best place to go if you like your personal space. You won't get any. That being said the waiters are attentive and plenty and will guarantee you that you'll be out of there in a jiffy. Probably trying to avoid a riot from taking place outside.",2,1,1

When I entered, I was welcomed by their friendly staff, and the table was already set up for our dinner. This place radiates very cute, cozy vibes, and I can see how this place can be a perfect place for brunch. We ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees to share as family style- Zucchini chips, salt pepper eggplant, and roast cauliflower for appetizer. I enjoyed the eggplant appetizer the most. For entrees, we ordered almost one of each. Schnitzel was as expected (still good tho); steak was also decent but I had better steaks at other places. I loved how the ground lamb lasagne Â had so much cheese in it! It was my favorite. Peri peri chicken was good too.

We arrived at 5:30 on a Wednesday evening, I'd recommend coming a bit earlier since you can't make reservations (except for larger parties). It was super empty when we arrived and we were seated immediately. We were seated in the corner booth table (who doesn't love booths?). I think they use the menus as placemats, because they never took them from us after we ordered. My sister ordered the matzo ball soup and the curry bowl, I opted for the schnitzel. I absolutely love schnitzel and this did not disappoint -- the chicken was juicy and tender with a wonderfully crisp and breaded outside (side note - why is it so hard to find schnitzel, anywhere?) I've never had matzo ball soup here but it was wonderful (especially on a cold day). My sister loved her curry, I'm not a huge curry person so I wasn't a huge fan, but at least she liked it.The service was great, everyone was super friendly. I ended up leaving my credit card behind and they were so awesome about it. When I called, the person asked me if I had left my credit card there before I even had a chance to finish my sentence, I told them my sister was going to pick it up for me (they had it stashed in the safe), and the waiter immediately recognized her when she came in. I would absolutely come here again and (sadly) I'd probably order the exact same thing.... There's a reason this place has such high reviews, excellent food, fantastic service...

I got the green shakshuka, and my friend got the avocado toast. While the shakshuka was fresh, it wasn't very satisfying; it didn't ""hit the spot"" for me. And my friend said her avocado toast was very average and tasted like she could have made it at home herself. I really wish I liked this place a lot better than I really did, but I don't believe the hype. I would rather wait an hour for brunch at Root and Bone or anywhere else.

I personally ordered the green shakshuka which was popular on their yelp page. The portion was small so I would definitely recommend getting a side dish. My friend got the breakfast bowl which was really good. The resturant itself is pretty small and cramped but is esthetically pleasing (definitely an Instagramable spot haha),,,

I got the poached eggs, which you can't really go wrong with. Perfectly poached and yolk-y, it made for a great social media story.

We were seated in a small creased space, it wasn't very comfortable seating. We ordered quite a bit of food. I had the green shakshuka and rosewater waffle. The shakshuka was very fresh but the cause tasted like it was whipped up in a blender not a stove top, it doesn't taste like it had been cooked or simmered, which I'm sure some else might enjoy but I didn't prefer it. The waffle was good, the syrup did taste like rose water, but there wasn't anything exceptional. I can say though, that the sweet bread dish my friend ordered was quite good. It taste very fresh with a nice palpable texture. Sweet breads are delicate and not easy to prepare, they did a great job here. We tried a few of the brunch cocktails which were a good strength. Overall, it was a nice experience. Would I go again? Probably not. The wait time along with the feeling of being cramped and uncomfortable while eating, takes a lot away from the experience.Happy Yelping!!",3,,1

I've been here a couple of time in the past but somehow totally forgot to leave a review. So as I Â was done shopping in Soho the other day, my bf and I decided to get dinner here. It's always crowded any time of the day but we were lucky enough to get a table outside right away. It's super noisy inside this tiny restaurant anyway. We ordered the Kefta Kebab, Peri-peri Chicken, and French Fries. I've only had brunch here so these are all new to me. The Kefta Kebab is lamb minced meatball with a lot of flavors coming from herbs and seasonings so the lamb smell is not overwhelming at all. It pairs great with the white sauce and pita bread. I LOVE the Peri-peri Chicken! It's a grilled chicken thigh with lots of seasoning on the skin, salsa salad and spicy guac(?) dipping sauce. It's seasoned so well and unique. The white meat is somewhat dry but it's unavoidable when you grill chicken. I highly recommend this dish. French Fries is delicious as well. The price is reasonable and the staff is beyond helpful. Definitely coming back for more!",3,,1
75,Bridget G.,"Los Angeles, CA",9,36,10,5.0,9/9/2018,This place is SO good and fresh! Ordered the chicken skewers and couscous with a watermelon juice. It's definitely a smaller place so I would suggest to call before to make sure there isn't a long wait!,,,
76,Dana R.,"New York, NY",333,157,258,3.0,12/29/2017,"I've heard many great things about this place - even bookmarked as ""high priority."" Unfortunately they missed the mark one cold, weekday afternoon. Â We came in without a reservation and were ready to wait a bit, as it was really packed. And wait we did. For about 25 minutes or so, which isn't too bad for a holiday week. I don't love the layout at Jack's Wife Freda; one long, communal table right in the middle, surrounded by smaller tables against the walls - making it almost impossible to walk towards your seat. We waited about ten minutes after being sat until we order. They were so busy they couldn't keep track of who was who. I feel like restaurants like this could really shine when they're busy. The servers seemed nice, but they really were just way too understaffed that day.The food was fine - nothing really stood out. Got a chicken prego and some fries. Lots of brunch places in the area are so much more worth the price and the wait.",,,
77,Nicholas C.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",201,204,584,5.0,10/31/2017,"In my eyes, Jack's Wife Freda is one of the BEST causal brunch places in the city! If you're looking for a spot with a great abidance, friendly waitstaff, and a variety of food options to choose from look no further than Jack's Wife Freda.My friend and I decided to go to their Soho location on a calm Sunday afternoon. We had noticed there were already people waiting on the sidewalk (This place gets filled up fast), but no one had taken the two seats at the bar. We were offered and accepted since we really didn't care about sitting at a table.The waitstaff along with the bartender were extremely attentive. Right after we were seated they asked us our drink orders and gave us a few minutes to peruse the menu. I ended up choosing the Jack's Burger with a side of fires, along with their special hot sauce. All I can say is that I left full and satisfied beyond a doubt.A side note, this place does not take reservations for parties of two. If you're looking for table service either come early or be prepared to wait. It's that good. They also have a location on carmine street that is apparently less busy on Sundays? (That's only what I've been told)If you have the opportunity, definitely visit Jack's Wife Freda! You'll leave more happy (and more full) then when you had come in!",2,1,1
78,Aakash K.,"Upper Saddle River, NJ",88,18,15,5.0,5/18/2018,"Definitely one of the hotter brunch spots in NYC. I don't know if Jack is just taking credit by putting his name up there but Freda's food is delicious. Although you might have to wait upwards of half an hour JWF is in a fun part of Nyc to explore. Inside it's kind of tight so if you're tall or fat good luck but the ambiance is fun everyone's talking and laughing and the staff is awesome. They have a nice selection of cocktails, ipas, and wine.The food.The Madame Freda is crazy. It's like a croque madam with duck prosciutto instead of ham and it's amazing. Maya's breakfast bowl is another big hit for the healthy ones. I didn't get around to most of the menu but I'm sure they're all good. JWF is known for its hot sauce and while not traditional (its green and avocado-ey) it adds to everything from the spaghetti squash to the French fries. The fries are a must have also.",1,1,1
79,Fancypants X.,"San Francisco, CA",183,2014,3152,3.0,4/8/2018,"If I had to endure the insane wait times I'd heard/read about, I'd be writing a 2-Star review for Jack's Wife Freda because their breakfast isn't worth being hangry for. We arrived at opening time, 8:30am, & avoided that unfortunate scenario. JWF serves basic American breakfast fare with Mediterranean touches. Their dainty portions are plated nicely & photograph well, but will leave you scrambling for sustenance soon after eating here. I ordered the Green Shakshuka -- bakes eggs in a tomatillo sauce, which was watery. The meal was salvaged by my add-ons: avocado & grilled halloumi, a semi-hard cheese that is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. Our server seldomly checked on us. We ordered a drink which didn't arrive until almost the end of our meal. The wait staff is so inundated by the large number of customers they pack into a small space.I'd say JWF is a skip, but I'm sure social media will tell you otherwise.",6,3,5
80,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",201,161,158,3.0,5/7/2018,"Jack's Wife Freda is a decent brunch place, but I personally feel they're way overhyped. For starters, the wait is always at least an hour long. I've tried coming early, late, weekends, weekdays-- I never have much luck here. Since the restaurant is always packed, the interior is cramped and noisy and you need to be pretty aggressive in order to flag down a waiter.The food is great, but not mind-blowing enough for me to willingly return to brave the lines all over again. Of all their breakfast menu items, I would recommend the green shakshuka (tender soft baked eggs in a zesty tomatillo sauce) paired with the duck bacon (I call this the Green Eggs & Ham special). Overall, JWF is an okay brunch place with aesthetically pleasing dishes. Definitely go at least once and check it out, but be wary of the wait.",1,1,
81,Lateefah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",136,138,171,5.0,5/2/2018,"Jack's Wife Freda has been on my list of restaurants to go to since I moved to New York City. And it wasn't until a friend and I wanted food last minute that, I finally got to go last weekend. I was not disappointed. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 3. It was still pretty crowded, but we got there at the tail end of the rush so we were able to be seated right away. The decor is very ""American Bistro"", with small tables, booths on the perimeter of the restaurant, and a shared table in the middle. There is a bar area to the right and space is airy due to the big windows that can be opened when the weather is nice. The servers wear striped shirts, and have a fun sense of humor as they work, which I dig. Overall, I appreciate the ascetics. The server we had was really nice and helped us right away. We both got their seasonal special cocktail. I have no idea what it is called but it was amazing. I also have no idea what was in it, but there were muddled raspberries and any cocktail with raspberries is a win for me. I got the Eggplant Baguette and my friend got the Madame Freda. The Eggplant Baguette was so good for such a simple sandwich. The eggplant was fresh and grilled perfectly, the mozzarella was also fresh, the olive tapenade added the right amount of saltiness, and the pesto was the best pesto I have ever had. I want to recreate the pesto and put it on everything. I had a little bit of my friends sandwich and the cheddar on it was so amazing. The cheese was so rich that it wasn't even like cheddar. Both came with a side of fries (you can get a salad), which were also perfect. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.",1,,1
82,Minna C.,"Hilliard, OH",118,90,326,5.0,4/16/2018,"This small brunch spot is super busy and the wait is pretty long but it also goes by pretty fast! The food itself is totally worth the wait! My friend ordered the eggs benedict, Madame.. something! She loved it and I tried a bite and it was so good!!! The eggs were cooked perfectly so the yolk can soak into the bread! The bread was delish! The arugula salad really pairs well with the main dish! I ordered quite a bit.. being a yelper lol! I ordered coffee which was great and the small sugar packets have different messages on them! Super cute super picturesque! I had a bit of coffee left but the waitress was super nice and just filled a to go cup of fresh coffee for the road! I also order the sashuka? I am probably butchering all of the names but its very fresh not heavy at all! The sauce is more like green salsa style but really good with the egg and the sauce was so good with the toasted bread given. I was afraid the dish might be salty but not at all! If you kind of like fresh but cilantro fresh style... i recommend this! I ordered the grapefruit yogurt as well because this dish is a combination of things i love: yogurt, fresh grapefruit, nuts, and honey! I am so glad i ordered this as well. I was singing a tune each time i took a bite! It was sooo good! The mint leaves in the yogurt also compliments the dish! Gah i want it again!!!",2,,

A special mention to the bloody Mary which is probably the best i have had! For mains we got the madame freda which is similar to croque madam but stuffed with duck bacon. We also got the 2 poached eggs with grilled tomato and haloumi which was a basic no flate comforting dish with perfectly poached eggs and perfectly grilled haloumi. The shakshuka with tomatillos was a little disappointing because of its watery consistency but the server exceeded our expectations by letting us order another dish in its place for no extra charge and with a smile so we got the breakfast bowl which was hearty and healthy and tasted great.Overall a really satisfying meal.",2,,2

They only take reservations for group of 6+. Lucky for me, I came at 6pm for a table of 2 on a Wed and it was quiet. Perhaps they can dim the light to romanticize the ambiance a bit but it feels like a diner without the booths.We ordered the famous burger with fries and the prego roll with salad.

89,Daniel K.,"NoHo, Manhattan, NY",216,43,55,2.0,9/29/2017,"I came across this spot while perusing the yelp app. The reviews were great all across the board so I confidently walked in with high expectations. We were greeted and sat at our table. Everyone, and I mean everyone, around us was eating delicious looking waffles with fresh fruit. I wanted this. But I guess we came at an odd transition time (around 4:30pm), so we were told the majority of the items on the menu, including the waffles, were unavailable. Disappointingly, I settled with the chicken with quinoa salad while my girlfriend ordered the hamburger with fries.I guess My taste buds aren't accustomed to 'healthy eats,' but I thought the entire meal was extremely uninspiring and unsatisfying. While the chicken was cooked well, it lacked flavor (though the additional spicy green sauce on the side was not too bad). The quinoa underneath was, simply put, just bland quinoa with pieces of cucumbers. The cheeseburger was completely underwhelming as well. While the bun was tasty, the patty was bland and tasted like cardboard. The fries were okay, but McDonald's is definitely better. Everything tasted like my funky experiments at home economics class during 9th grade. The only great thing about the place is the service and people. Everyone is so friendly and kind. Decor is bright and nice around and there is plenty available outdoor seating.You know that feeling after you feel super unsatisfied after a meal? That feeling you wish you could just vomit and just re-do your appetite and eating experience? That's kind of how I felt with this restaurant.",1,2,

Like any brunch place in the city, the wait is really long. We waited 1.5 hours but went to a nearby coffee shop to chill out.I totally get in the city that space is a premium, but this place is pretty cramped. We were lucky to get a corner table so we had a little more space, but everyone else was packed tightly.Surprisingly, getting your order is super quick. I would say about 15 minutes? I got the Mediterranean breakfast which was alright. I did really enjoy the flavors of the cucumber salad as it was refreshing and crunchy.I feel like Jack's Wife Freda was just okay. I'd recommend coming here if there wasn't a long line. But other than that, there are other brunch places nearby that probably won't have as long as a wait.",,,

The inside was a little cramped, and we ended up being seated by the door, which was less than ideal given the cold air coming in. I had the eggplant ""lasagna"" for my meal, which was fairly well prepared although a bit on the heavier side, while my friend's steak was a bit lacking on the flavor side but was still decent. It was a decent place for a meal, and you could do worse than to come here for a casual bite in the area.",,,

But the portions are perfect! No one needs an enormous amount of food for breakfast that they'll be forced to save for lunch and maybe even dinner. Just give us a decent portion we can actual stay awake after eating. And that is why this place is a good spot to stop!,,,
93,Chelsea E.,"Columbus, OH",148,135,275,5.0,10/6/2017,"Wow!!! Fellow yelpers you did not let me down with this recommendation! I was in Soho for work so had bookmarked a few places to eat. This one came up as a top recommendation, specifically for breakfast. The reviews were actually so appealing that I was afraid I'd get there when they opened and there would be a wait. Lucky for me I got there about 15 minutes after opening and I was only like the 5th person in there. No wait whatsoever! (Although it was a Tuesday morning) The server was super helpful. I'm not the most adventurous eater so when looking at the menu, I got a little nervous. I had seen pics of the waffle and initially wanted that, but when I got there and saw it was a ""rosewater waffle"" I was kind of turned off. He walked me through other recommendations and I ultimately decided on the eggs benny....Although the thought of a beet hollandaise sauce also made me kind of nervous.After I ordered, I checked a few things on my phone and then used the restroom. When I came out of the restroom, I turned the corner and my food was already there! (Unbelievable- it had to have been less than 5 mins) I was a little concerned when I saw the meal. It was very very Pink. It just didn't look natural. Anyways, I thought ""here goes nothing..."" and took one bite...OMG!!! I will never stick my nose up at unique foods again!! It tasted AMAZING! My mouth is watering thinking about it. It just had all the best breakfast flavors in one delicious bite; eggs, potato, and salmon (I also think I tasted bacon but might have just been the salmon). It was absolutely excellent and I've been telling my friends and coworkers that Jack's Wife Freda is the crowned yelp jewel of my NYC trip. I would highly recommend going here for breakfast. Would even go out of my way to come here next time I'm in town. It was just that damn good!!",1,,
94,Shelly L.,"Cambridge, MA",428,76,134,4.0,4/7/2018,"Came here for brunch with a party of six and boy was it crowded! Glad we made a reservation. Once we were seated, there was barely any room between the rows of tables - everybody was bustling in and out of their seats while the wait staff squeezed between rows to attend to the customers.The waiter attended to us quickly after we sat down and we ordered a variety of drinks - a couple cappuccinos, a matcha latte, and a tea. They arrived quickly and were all delicious. I ordered the chicken sandwich with french fries and was super satisfied. It was delicious and fresh, and the fries were not soggy or oily.Overall this place has good food and quick service - it's just very crowded in the restaurant and it can be hard to hear the person across from you at the table. Try to come at a less busy time if you have the freedom to. I do have to say that it's clear this restaurant is a well-oiled machine - to be serving so many people at once and to keep everyone moving definitely takes efficiency!",,,3

The space is as gorgeous as it appears on Instagram! I loved all the attention to detail, like the custom sugar packets and illustrated menu.I ordered the Yoghurt with Grapefruit which was super rich and delish! My boyfriend had the rose water waffle with a side of duck bacon, which was great.I felt the menu was a little limited, but at the end of the day I'd rather have a smaller choice of perfectly crafted dishes, than too many options!

Space was so small, and so many seated inside - it was organized chaos, in the best way possible!! Food - delicious. I loved the punch in flavors. And unlike most brunch places, food wasn't too oily or greasy. Felt like made a good life decision. Ordered: poached eggs with tomatoes/cheese. YUM!

101,Isabelle L.,"San Francisco Bay, CA",15,164,83,4.0,4/1/2018,"I had breakfast at this place with a friend in an early Sunday morning. If you go there at 8am, chances are you don't wait in line to be seated. But, we got the second last table so this place proves to be popular. I ordered the green shakshuma and she ordered mama's Freda. We had their orange juice as well. I'd say all dishes are very creative, or, they might simply be authentic to their cuisine which makes us feel alien but in a very good way. The service is great. The reason for the 4-Star instead of 5 is for the subtle treatment they had in the egg dish. I can't tell which flavor it's lacking but it's something around the seasoning that doesn't seem quite right, which makes me have some unpleasant raw taste: this is different from the sunny side up raw taste, it's more than that which I'm not comfortable with. Overall it's great with color and taste.",1,,
102,Patrick L.,"Pleasanton, CA",202,70,44,4.0,3/31/2018,"I came here on Sunday at around 12. Yes, I knew it would be a long wait, but my girlfriend and I were still slightly jetlagged so we couldn't wake up earlier. We were told that it would be a 45 minute wait, and she told us to come back around then. We decided to walk around soho and came back in 30 minutes. When we asked where we were on the list, she just said ""you're coming up"". Â We just wanted to check that we didn't miss it but she didn't seem to care. We waited for another 20 minutes as she called many other groups and we got worried so asked again, but she said ""I didn't forget about you"" without looking at the list. This was probably the most frustrating wait for a restaurant that I've ever encountered. Once we got seated, things started to turn around. Â We were able to order quickly and the waitress was was really nice. I got the poached eggs with grilled tomato and halloumi. My girlfriend got the Rosewater waffles. Both were really good, although kind of pricey for what you get. The poached eggs were a little too cooked for what I tend to think of for poached eggs. The grilled tomatoes and halloumi added a lot of flavor to the dish. There's also a nice green sauce on top of it and sour dough is included. The rosewater pancakes are nicely flavored and the syrup is not too viscous or sweet. The cream cheese on top was slightly weird as I'm used to butter or maple syrup, but overall the dish is also not bad.",1,,
103,Zach A.,"Berkeley, CA",3,36,2,1.0,7/14/2018,"Got the Mediterranean breakfast. Ordered eggs over medium. Over medium is always a true test of a kitchen's potential. They sent the eggs out over easy. Told the waitress--who was super nice--that the eggs were under-cooked. She immediately took the plate back to the kitchen. A few minutes later someone from the kitchen comes out with two eggs over hard and says, ""is this good for you?"" If the food on the plate tasted good I could have ignored it. But alas, it was a bland mix of forgettable nothing. Except for the pita bread. I'll never forget the pita bread because they only serve you 1/4 of a full pita, and it's chopped up into tiny triangles because they're charging you $14 for a plate that costs $2, and somehow they need to cut costs even further. Couldn't bare to part with the other 3/4 of the pita Freda? Really holding out on us with the bread, which was the only thing on the plate that could have pulled together the unintegrated factions of the dish.

They don't take reservations for parties under 6 so we ended up waiting a little bit for our table. Luckily, we went in the early evening and did not have to wait too long. The inside of the restaurant is a little cramped and small but it is worth enduring for the delicious food. We started out with the roasted garlic with focaccia bread which was amazing. They give you three pieces of bread with the dish which is not nearly enough. However, if you ask nicely, you may be able to get a few extra pieces. The roasted garlic spread upon on the warm bread is delicious. I highly recommend this dish!For my entree, I chose the eggplant with lamb lasagna. I have never had lasagna which had eggplant in place of noodles so I did not know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised! It was delicious and I actually did not miss the noodles because the eggplant was a perfect substitute. The eggplant paired perfectly with the lamb so I devoured every bit of it. I tried my friend's peri peri chicken which was tender and flavorful. Overall, this place did not disappoint and is worth the wait if there is a long line.",,,

The side salad was okay, didn't really like it too acidic for my taste. The eggs and pita bread was too typical. I enjoyed it but nothing special. Not worth the wait. My boyfriend ordered the jacks breakfast and that came with a skirt steak. Which was AMAZING. It was tender and flavorful. That was the onlyThings worth the wait.

Lighting is very dim here, and the space between your table and your neighbor's is very tight. I wouldn't overeat and risk getting stuck - partially joking. I ordered the spiced beet dip, roasted cauliflower, and Jack's burger - and was pleased with all. Customer service was good, and the vibe was all around positive. I have yet to come here for brunch, and am curious to try the Green Shakshuka when I do.",3,3,4
111,Sapan P.,"New York, NY",206,15,56,4.0,3/2/2018,"We went to Jack's Wife Freda on a weekend day for brunch. The weather was great and even with the increased amount of people there, we were able to be seated in about 15- 30 minutes. The great thing about their location is the proximity to an abundant amount of cafes and stores that will keep you busy while you wait. It's incredibly evident that the staff is trained to deal with a high influx amount of diners. They waste no time cleaning tables as a party is leaving and is actively pushing customers to carry-on once they are finished eating to accommodate waiting guests. They are also extremely understanding about the wait time; we had coffee at the next-door cafe while we waited and the staff at Jack's Wife Freda had no problem with us bringing our drinks into their restaurant and never assisted that we buy their own instead.The food was also great! I had their Mediterranean breakfast that included perfectly poached eggs, with a Mediterranean salad (cucumber, tomato, onion, feta cheese, etc). The dish was also served with creme fraiche which had a nice temperature contrast with the rest of their dish. The pita was slightly dry but went fine with the eggs and the freshness of the vegetables. The cantaloupe mimosa was slightly pricy for what it is. It had a nice sweet/ bitter contrast between the cantaloupe juice and champagne, but again, slightly pricy for the amount.Jack' Wife Freda is a consistent brunch spot that is always willing to accommodate their customers. It's a break quick and convenient brunch spot with 2 locations. They also serve dinner which I definitely plan to try in the future!",2,,

Updated review","Went back again, my friends from out of town really wanted to go here and I couldn't convince them how unimpressive this food is.

I decided to come here because I have heard from a million people about how amazing it is and I just knew I had to try it out, I came here for brunch on the Friday before New Years Eve and it was very busy. My cousin and I had to wait 1 hour, but we did not mind. There is a lot of cute shopping in the area and we just went shopping while we waited. JWF is super small and cozy on the inside. It is kind of hard to move around the restaurant, but that did not matter. The environment was very fun and exciting. The food was to die for. To drink, my cousin and I both got delicious cappuccinos. To eat, my cousin got the breakfast bowl and I got the Madame Freda!! The Madame Freda is so amazing and yummy, I wish I could have it again!!Overall, definitely come here...it is soo worth it!",2,2,2

At one point, they flickered the lights and we all sang happy birthday to someone. The food was good. It looks and tastes a lot better than the menu makes it sound. I kind of went off of what other people around me were ordering. Totally felt like a local here. Only complaint is that the 2 or 3 men that helped us (with putting us on the list, taking our coats, and serving us) were snappy with their attitudes. I felt they were a bit rude and feel like it can partially be attributed to the place being so crowded. You kind of feel like you're on top of each other. My mom really loved it. I felt a little uncomfortable at times.",1,,1

I also like this striped shirts they wear because it gives off some French vibes. For the most important part: THE FOOD!

We were were packed in so tightly with the other customers that I could barely get my legs in or out of the bench seat.The food was also unimpressive and definitely not worth the high price point.

I've gotten a variety of the small plates which are all delicious and inspired by the Jewish comfort food of South Africa meets modern Israeli. Highly recommend for a date! However, for brunch it's not worth the wait. There is always a long line on the weekends but the dishes are all sub-par and overpriced. The green shakshuka isn't the tastiest I've had, and doesn't come with enough bread. The beet and lox Benedict is beautiful, but tiny - I wasn't full after having that for brunch. Overall, skip the brunch lines by going elsewhere and go for a dinner date!",1,1,3

I did not know the background but one look at the menu screamed South African inspiration.The food was delicious and a healthier take on breakfast which we love! Tried the Madame Freda with a side of duck bacon, Jack's breakfast and Mediterranean breakfast. All was delicious and plates were cleaned. Asked for hot sauce and was presented with a fresh green salsa which was heavenly....bottle the stuff so I can have it with everything please!!!The madame Freda is a take on croque with duck prosciutto. It was delicious served with a side salad of arugula and Â pickled onion.The Med breakfast was simple and fresh and my husband loved it. A perfect combo to get the morning started.The Jacks breakfast is a South African fave, steak and eggs for breakfast...can't go wrong. Steak was perfectly cooked and accompaniments were on point.We could not leave without having the malva pudding which is another South African staple. Unfortunately this lost them the fifth star that I was poised to give (which happens rarely). It was more of a muffin than malva pudding which should be moist and rich. This take was quite dry. Still had good flavors but I'm not in favor of this spin on malva pudding.Will I be back? YES YES YES!",10,3,9

There was no wait at 9:15 am, but there were their trademark crowds on the sidewalk an hour and change later.The place is cute, though the tables are packed in. Service is quick and polite.The menu is filled with things you want to eat, some healthy and some more dubious. Nothing that you haven't seen before if you've brunched in NYC-- standard plates with slightly fancy ingredients. Quinoa bowls, green shakshuka, duck bacon, salads, rose waffles, halloumi. Avocados and eggs in most dishes. Very Mediterranean; don't see a strongly Jewish influence beyond the smoked salmon.I went with Maya's grain bowl ($15), with poached eggs, avocado, quinoa, kale, and spaghetti squash. Lots and lots of spaghetti squash. I didn't enjoy it at all until I poured on the green hot sauce, which worked pretty well to cohere it. Portion was quite big.I also had the cantaloupe juice ($6) which was... interesting? I think I liked it but I was always not quite sure. It's very thick. They give it to you in a to-go cup even if you're dining in, which I initially resented but was later useful. It became better as the ice melted.Overall, it was a decent brunch, but I don't understand why you would wait hours (or even minutes) for a table here.",6,3,8

Apparently, a ton of people flake/cancel their name on the wait list too, so your wait time might end up being much shorter. Warning: if the host calls your name and you're not ready? Too Fn bad.We tried all the popular items: * ""nana"" black tea with fresh mint - um, can I order a gallon-size next time?* green shakshuka plus a side of duck cured bacon - order this if you want fancy green eggs and ham - so yum! I could not stop dipping the challah toast in the vibrant green pepper sauce.* rosewater waffle - I would smother my face in this fluffy waffle. Hey, rosewater is good for your skin, right? The honey syrup and Lebanese yogurt complemented it so well too.* peri peri-marinated chicken - sadly the chicken kebab was on the dry side and could use some sort of sauce.Portions were just right for the price; I still had room afterward for a sweet treat afterward (pssst. Eileen's Cheesecake and Taiyaki desserts are a short walk away). Space was extremely tight (hint: don't bring all your SoHo shopping bags here). Service was quick and personable.

Updated review","Came here yesterday for a late lunch with a friend. Food was delicious, everything on the menu was priced well and everything we ordered was super tasty. They serve breakfast food all day long, I ordered the breakfast bowl at 4pm on a Sunday which hit the spot. My friend ordered the grapefruit and yogurt which was also delicious and the tea and fries were perfect to keep warm on a cold Wnter day. Service was a bit slow and the restaurant is really cramped which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Would definitely come back again for the food but advise to come with only one other person as there may be a wait for larger parties due to the restaurants small quaint size.",1,,
127,Danica H.,"Los Angeles, CA",408,97,231,5.0,7/6/2017,"Looking for a cute and delicious brunch spot? Try Jack's Wife Freda. My two friends and I ordered the Green Shakshouka, Rosewater Waffle and the Madame Freda (sandwich with duck prosciutto, gruyere cheese and fried egg). Our favorites were tied between the shakshouka and the rosewater waffle. Surprisingly, the rose flavor was very noticeable in the waffle. The Madame Freda was a little heavier, but still very tasty. While the server was cleaning our plates, he accidentally dropped a small plate on my friend's lap. However, he was very kind and apologetic about helping to clean up the small mess and gave us a book of their adorable matches as compensation. Would definitely return and would recommend to friends!",4,1,4

I bookmarked this place in hopes for the next time I was in the big apple.Leo and behold, I was in NY in the winter of '18. On my last day there, I ventured out to Soho in the rain to finally give this place a shot. The fact it was raining and it was a Tuesday morning probably deterred people from coming. There was no wait! Woohoo! My sister and I shared the rosewater waffle and the Mediterranean breakfast. I also ordered a side of their duck bacon.The waffle was good. It was topped with yogurt and berries and came with honey syrup. I couldn't really taste the rose though, which I didn't mind since I don't like floral flavors. It definitely had a unique taste but it wasn't rosey to me.The Mediterranean breakfast was a nice change from your usual array of breakfast sides. It came with eggs, avocado, cucumber salad, pita and hummus. It was really delicious and on the lighter side. I could see myself eating this every morning. The duck bacon was great. I love duck, and this bacon had a nice quacky flavor.Oh, and don't forget to ask for their hot sauce! It's green and not that hot. It has a tomatillo/Serrano taste which I loved! I licked it clean.I skipped out on drinks because I was going to get a draft latte from La Colombe after. Regret not trying their cantaloupe juice though...This place did not disappoint! Usually, when I look forward to something, it's pretty underwhelming.I would definitely come back again the next time I'm in New York.",1,,1

I had this place bookmarked for a while and took the opportunity to visit with my friend from out of town on a Saturday night. We were immediately seated despite it being packed. This place is definitely a brunch place for sure--wouldn't really come here for dinner.I really do appreciate how nothing is cooked with pork in this restaurant :) I ordered the duck prosciutto sandwich (Madame Freda) which was amazingly good. I never had that before and the pairing of a sunny side egg and gruyere cheese really went well together. My friend ordered the Greek salad and commented how fresh it was put together. The service here was nice too even with how small the place was.,3,1,1

You can still manage to have a conversation since you're seated so closely. Ordered Nana Tea and and the Mint Lemonade. Bummed we weren't told about the watermelon juice though and only overheard the waitress telling the people next to us about it since it's not on the menu. Also ordered the poached eggs with grilled tomato and haloumi ($14) and Maya's breakfast bowl ($17). Prices are a bit high for the portions you're getting, but expected since this place is so trendy right now. Drinks are good. Food was really tasty and flavorful. Everything feels fresh. Only waited about 15 minutes for the food to arrive. Overall, would come again for the watermelon juice but probably won't need to eat here again.

That being said, know that when you go to this place you will likely, literally, be sitting shoulder to shoulder with someone. Like, if you are cutting a piece of meat your elbow may knock into the person next to you. I ordered the Shakahouka which was just okay. Why so darn small?!

The tuna salad was well seasoned and good portioned. The shakshuka was okay. My friends thought it tasted only of cilantro. I didn't like it cuz it wasn't hot. It was on the colder/ lukewarm side. The egg white parts to me were a bit underdone too. It's one thing to enjoy runny egg yolk but to scoop transparent egg whites is not appetizing but that can be a personal preference. The shakshuka portion is also small. It's more of an appetizer portion. Like having soup and toast. So if you're hungry the shakshuka probably won't fill you up.",,,

We checked with the waitress and fortunately, the wait was only 15 minutes long. We knew exactly what we wanted as we were seated, so we ordered the GREEN SHAKSHUKA and ROSEWATER WAFFLE to split:Pros:-Quick service. We received our food in fewer than 10 minutesCons:-The GREEN SHAKSHUKA was the greatest letdown of the day. It was essentially two fried eggs drenched lightly in green sauce with two slabs of barely toasted challah. I expected it to be a hearty dish, but it tasted exactly liked it looked... eggs and bread.-The ROSEWATER WAFFLE was also a disappointment. Honestly, they could've given me an Eggo waffle and I wouldn't be able to distinguish between the two. The edges weren't even crispy or caramelized, and the consistency was soft throughout. The fruit was unripe and sour atop even more sour yogurt. The redeeming quality was the rosewater honey, which was a unique touch, but not viscous enough. You'd be surprised at how quickly it pours out.-Price. Did I really pay ~$13 for half a waffle, an egg, and bread that didn't even fill me up?This place has ruined shakshuka for me. I don't understand the long lines at all - steer clear if you're looking for a decent brunch spot.",11,5,6

We ordered three signature dishes, the duck bacon, green shakshuka and rosewater waffle. All dishes are delicious, including the crispy bread. The duck bacon is surprisingly delicious.",1,,
152,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",369,230,306,5.0,5/10/2017,"Some places just have that feel good factor, and this is one of them. Most of it's due to the awesome staff, which made great food just all the better - they all seem like funny, laid-back, overall cool people. I came in at mid-afternoon when they were doing their shift change, and everyone was greeting each other, joking around, telling each other stories, just having fun. It was kind of like a mini party and made the whole place really lighthearted.The food is also very good. I wanted something light so opted for the green shakshuka, which was perfect for that. The tomatillos had a nice kick, and the challah was actually probably my favourite part. I also got a side of fries - they've got fantastic fries! Even better dipped in the green sauce it comes with. Oh, and I have to mention all the adorable personalised things like sugar packets, pens, even matchboxes. What other restaurant has personalised matchboxes?All in all, you can't go wrong with brunch here. It's on the smaller side but has a lot of personality, and the good food doesn't hurt either.",4,4,7
153,Angela S.,"Manhattan, NY",463,114,77,3.0,11/26/2017,"This spot is smaller than I thought it'd be. It's difficult to walk around as there is very little space to move around. It's really more of a touristy brunch place, but not bad if you're looking for a lighter lunch. I got the Mediterranean breakfast, which I saw a lot of people ordering. The dish was very simple in that it consisted of a chopped pile of tomatoes, onions and peppers, two poached eggs (no seasoning or sauce), a quarter of a sliced avocado, a yogurt sauce, and a few pieces of pita bread (not toasted or anything). Overall, it tasted fine when all together, but as I said before, very simple and not much to it. Came on a Saturday morning and the wait wasn't too bad - about 20 minutes.",2,,
154,Arianna H.,"Westchester County, NY",14,89,27,2.0,6/19/2018,Meh. Meh. The food was just ok for what you pay for. I definitely will not remember or crave what I ordered (Green Shakshuka). Though it seems like people come here more to be seen than to eat. I spent the majority of my time watching people not eating and just taking pictures of their pretty food. I'd rather eat a decent meal than look at a picture of it...but that's just me.,,,
155,Olga K.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",0,3,3,5.0,6/7/2018,"Since discovering this place I can't picture a trip to New York without visiting it. The food is wonderfully simple, flavorful, and comforting. The ambiance also goes a long way. Whether I come here alone or with a few friends, I never feel unwelcome or awkward. The staff are an absolute pleasure and I hope they're as happy as they seem. So positive, it can make your bad day turn completely around. As for the dishes themselves, the peri peri chicken with couscous salad is my favorite so far. The spicy house sauce is delightful. I'm definitely picking up the cookbook next time because when I get nostalgic for New York, this place and its food are where I travel to mentally.",1,,
156,Jenn Z.,"Jamaica, Queens, NY",223,169,1452,4.0,5/14/2017,"Always packed, like a can of sardines. We came on a Sunday morning around 9am and there was plenty of tables but within 30 minutes it was all full. By the time we left, there was a lot of people waiting outside for a table. Expect to sit less than a feet from your neighbors. The green shakshuka (the green eggs) was delicious but the star of the dish was the toasted bread. It was perfectly toasted and buttery. The portion is pretty small for the price, but it leaves you satisfied. The rosewater waffle makes you feel mad bougie in the form of a waffle. The waffle is very filling, delicious and unique - i've never seen a place have rosewater in a waffle. We saw a lot of people get the house cured duck bacon so we got it too. Its really good - I mean, it is bacon after all. Its a very thick lean slice of bacon. Their coffee is from Stumptown, no complaints.",2,1,2
157,Bakchun K.,"New York, NY",75,505,1145,4.0,5/1/2017,"I really wanted to come here for brunch since I heard a lot of good things about it, but it will have to wait. Â I came here for dinner at about 5:30 on a weeknight. Â It is a cute little place, considered small by me, with some outdoor seating. Â The seating is a bit unique, along the walls are the 2 and 4 seater with one giant table in the middle, so I guess if you can't get a seat along the walls, looks like you will be sharing with other people in the middle.The menu is a piece of paper in front of you, it doesn't have that many options but just enough in my opinion. Â It is vegetarian friendly. Â I had the whole fish with cous cous and assorted vegetables. Â The whole fish for the day is trout. Â The whole fish tasted flavorful and they cooked it so good, the fish literally came off the bones like the meat that comes so easily off pork ribs, it was amazing. Â The cous cous was a bit dry. Â  My friend had the fish (salmon) a la plancha sesame soy glazed with sauteed kale and radish with a side of fries. Â I didn't like the fries, tasted like it was fried twice. Â I didn't try the salmon because been eating too much of it lately but the sauteed kale was amazing, done perfectly with a small kick of pepper mixed with other flavors. Â It's a good date spot, the tables are a bit close to each other but not to the point where you can clearly hear other people's conversations. Â I would categorize this place to be a healthy option place for people.",4,1,4

Updated review","The food is still solid but service was ABYSMAL today. Â The servers knocked my bags over - no apologies or ""excuse me"" scattering everything over the floor, AND refused to even take our order after we sat and waited. Â The patrons NEXT to us who were seated after we were were treated with respect and their orders were served before our orders were even taken. Â When I asked the server if she could take our order, she told me that she was busy. Â I had to tell the hostess to send a server over. Â Just the worst experience.",1,,1
159,Sara L.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,14,31,4.0,7/13/2018,"I came here around 1 PM on 4th of July and had to wait an hour to get a table. Because this is a famous brunch place, I wasn't surprised. Once I got a table, I got the food quite quickly. I ordered the crusted tofu. My friend ordered the Mediterranean breakfast. The crusted tofu was great, though it did need some pepper. The tofu was cooked very well and crispy but not oily. The squash noodles were tasty as well. However, the Mediterranean breakfast was definitely overrated. It was good but definitely not worth the 1 hour wait.",,,
160,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",914,269,1028,3.0,4/24/2017,"I've been to Jack's Wife Freda twice now, the first time better than the second. Both times there was a wait - the first was around 30 minutes, the second time was around 45 (but we did come at a slightly off time the first time). Not a terrible wait compared to what you'd experience at, say, Russ & Daughters, but definitely prepare to wait around a little. There's no text system or anything either so you truly do have to wait around, which is a little annoying. HOWEVER, I gotta give credit where credit is due - the hosts/hostesses at Jack's Wife are phenomenal with predicting wait time and keeping their lists organized. Seating can get a little crowded on the inside, so Jack's Wife is not the place for claustrophobes. There are some tables, but most two-tops are sat at the large communal table in the middle, so likely you'll be dining with strangers. The first time we ordered the Green Shakshuka and the Breakfast Bowl. The former comes pretty much as described, two eggs baked into green tomatillo shakshuka, and the latter comes with scrambled or poached eggs over spaghetti squash, avocado, quinoa, kale, etc. The former is $12 and the latter is $16 and I believe they were priced fairly for the quality and portion size. Both were absolutely excellent but I especially recommend the Breakfast Bowl. The second time, we came a little later so got slightly lunch-ier items. I ordered the Prego Roll, which is a Portuguese steak sandwich that came with fries ($16). My friend ordered the Madame Freda (a pressed sandwich with duck prosciutto, cheddar bÃ©chamel, gruyere & a sunny side up egg) - also $16. We also split the peri-peri sweetbreads ($12). The sweetbreads were excellent although the portion size was small. However, we were both very disappointed with our mains. My Prego Roll was REALLY small and was really just some chopped steak on a roll, nothing else. The steak was tender, admittedly, but I ended up filling up on fries which seems ridiculous for the price. My friend was really disappointed with the Madame Freda and said there was way too much cheese and the prosciutto wasn't anything special. Both times, I ordered a bloody mary and coffee (Stumptown bottomless drip). The bloodies were excellent both times, although the second time I had to remind my server after waiting about 15 minutes and getting nothing. Another disappointing aspect of our second visit was that they were terrible about refilling coffee. With such small cups, I finished my first in about 2 minutes, and had to wait 10 before anyone even came by again to ask if we wanted more. YES a girl needs her caffeine fix. Would I come back? Yeah, sure, it's a super cute and trendy spot that has some excellent dishes. I was just overwhelmingly disappointed with the service the second time as well as the dishes we ordered. Will come back at some point for a tie-breaker.",5,3,2

165,Kim Y.,"New York, NY",312,95,777,4.0,5/2/2017,"Delicious healthy brunch food in the heart of SohoCame here on Sunday for a sister's brunch date at 10:30AM. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait, so we walked around Soho as we waited. A little heads up, they don't call you when your table is up so be mindful when you put your name down with the hostess who is often running around. We were seated around 11:30AM. The menu has something for everyone whether you were craving a healthy grain bowl or a cheesy toast or you have a sweet tooth for waffles. MADAME FREDA $16: Probably the most perfectly sunnyside egg I have ever seen! As you cut into it, the egg yolk still oozes over the cheesy toast with a hint of saltiness from the duck prosciutto. But I was not entirely impressed since the cheese had hardened by the time it reached me. And the toast was quite hard. The arugala with pickled onion on the side was quite sad, as the pickled onions did not taste like anything. BREAKFAST BOWL $16: Hearty quinoa bowl with kale and grilled tomato. You won't be missong anything as the grilled tomatoes added a great flavor with the creaminess of the avocado and poached egg. They had this amazing house made green hot sauce that paired perfectly well with the grain bowl. Highly recommended for those trying to fuel up for their Soho shopping. DUCK BACON $6: A much thicker and less fatty bacon. Great bacon, not over crispy. For me, it was too oily as it was sitting in a pool of oil. I would skip this.NANA TEA $4.50: Hot minty tea that is very refreshing, recommended with honey! (Ask the waiters for it). I was surprised by how much I love that minty taste as I often like my tea weak. This was a great wakeup call. And if you finish, ask for more hot water!CANTALOUPE JUICE $6: AMAZING AND MUST GET! Ok I must admit that at first I was quite skeptical since many brunch places often have freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juices, but now I am all for a freshly squeezed cantaloupe juice! It was not overly sweet and quite refreshing!SERVICE: I want to give a huge shout out to our waitress, Abigail! Even though she had big tables, she checked up on us constantly. Another waiter actually took our order, but his goofy side got the best of him as he completely messed up our order. When he repeated back our order, he added items and then laughed it off, but reassured us that he got it. Something felt a bit off and Abigail came to the rescue and save our brunch date! Everyone was super friendly and even though the restaurant was bustling especially on Sunday for brunch, you never felt rushed. I would probably come back for brunch, even on a Sunday, to try the other items on their menu as well as get my fixing of cantaloupe juice! If you do come on Sunday, at around 12PM, the wait is about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. So, if you can, get there before and your wait should be about 45minutes. Not a bad wait for a healthy brunch in New York City!",2,1,
166,Helen Z.,"Chicago, IL",132,74,129,2.0,5/26/2018,Food is pretty but extremely untasty. I think it is important to have a balance between the two. The restaurant is very crowded and waiting time is very long.,1,,

We arrived around 1 PM on a rainy Saturday and were told that the wait for two would be 1 hour to 1 hour 15 min. It actually wasn't too bad considering this place is in Soho and there were plenty of things to do in the meantime. Gotta give the restaurant five stars for service- even though it's extremely crowded no one was nasty and we were served with a smile, and very efficiently. I ordered the Madame Freda which was quite good and light- my friend ordered the green shakshuka which wasn't super filling, but a nice healthy option. Overall pretty good food, although I wouldn't wait an hour again. Great photo opps though ;)",2,1,2

Honestly one of my favorite brunch spots in the city! Though the space is tight in both locations (Carmine location seems slightly bigger), it is still fairly comfortable with great lightning, ambiance and outdoor seating. The menu is right on the table so ordering is quick and for all you germaphobic people, you don't have to touch anything! ::Insert Thumbs up emoji:: Service is quick too. In and out! I've been here quite a few times. This last visit, We ordered the Mediterranean breakfast and the breakfast bowl. I thoroughly enjoyed both of them as they were fresh, healthy and tasty. The Mediterranean breakfast included scrambled eggs, labne, avocado, a salad that was very delicious, and pita. My friend ate everything off her plate! Â I had the breakfast bowl which has a choice of scrambled or poached eggs, spaghetti squash, red onions, kale and quinoa. I felt so good afterwards because I wasn't crazy full and I knew it was healthy for me! My friend also got the cantaloupe juice. Not too sweet and very refreshing.

Though I have to give it to their staff as their service is on point and based on my observation, they have a very good system in regards to overall service. The Menu descriptions are underwhelming compared to what you actually get. I guess Jacks Wife Freda likes to underwhelm and overdeliver. We got the Jacks Breakfast and the Madame Freda. The Jacks Breakfast had the most tender steak with an amazing green sauce that I can not identify. The Madame Freda was a fun twist on the Croque Madame with gruyere cheese and duck prosciutto accompanied by an arugula salad that worked perfectly to cut the heaviness of Madame. I'll be back to try the Mediterranean breakfast.",,,

We got there around 11AM to a line that was five parties in. I found It a bit awkward that those waiting to be seated were just standing on the sidewalk watching those sitting outside eat, but that's what you get with small spaces!

Imagine my excitement when I happened upon it. It's a small restaurant and was packed like any good New York eatery on a Friday night. My olfactory was kicked into overdrive upon opening the door. The air was permeated by odors and smells I couldn't recognize but couldn't wait to taste. We were lucky to get a table by the window as soon as the hostess greeted us. The table next to us was enjoying what I think my nose was smelling. He noticed me staring at his plate, I didn't realize I was being so noticeable. I apologized and told him I simply needed to know what he was having because I want to have it too, not weird at all, right? It was the special of the day he said, braised ribs with potatoes. That settled it, braised ribs it is! Let me tell you, it was fall off the fork, melt in your mouth, satisfy your soul, things my grandma used to make, kind of goodness. The wine wasn't bad either, but this isn't about the wine. This is about the food at Jacks Wife Freda that you simply must go try for yourself. Sometimes we don't even realize we're starving, then little places like these somehow manage to fill us in ways we had never imagined.",2,1,1

The cheese is lightly grilled to perfection and the tomato is nice and chewy. I wish there was a little more toast to go with the meal, but it was still delicious!

Love their steak and eggs, breakfast bowl (spaghetti squash, kale, quinoa and egg), green shashuka, their FRIES, vegetable curry, catch of the day, and pasta of the day.

I had the green shakshuka and it was alright. It was refreshing and filling but there wasn't much flavor to it besides the small kick from the tomatillo. The consistency also threw me off because it just felt slimey...? I went to the Lafayette location and it was super small and crowded. Waiters would bump into you walking past your table because there was literally NO ROOM in the entire place. Overall, my friends and I were satisfied, but it definitely didn't meet expectations.

This didn't bother us very much, but it did make our brunch experience less relaxing and enjoyable.Food: We tried the green shakshuka and the Mediterranean breakfast and had some coffee - the food was fresh and tasty, the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the coffee was good, but overall, we felt that it's a bit overhyped.Given how busy the restaurant is, we probably won't go again during peak hours but would definitely go back for good food during off-peak hours so we could enjoy our meal in a more peaceful environment.Food: 5/5Service: 5/5Ambience/comfort: 1/5",1,,1
191,James S.,"Princes Bay, Staten Island, NY",11,77,12,1.0,5/27/2018,I've waited and waited for a rainy day to try this establishment half an hour wait in the rain I was finally seated .how this place is so crowded is beyond me everything I ate was ice cold they bombard you with coffee even without you asking . This is only a tourist attraction For the life of me I don't understand how crowded this place is ....poached eggs and kale .... 25 dollars one waffle with 3 berries and a foreign type of cream $25 it's not about the money the hole experience has me baffled.,,,
192,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",199,956,810,3.0,2/24/2017,"Jack's Wife Freda is a cozy Mediterranean brunch spot filled with young beautiful people and healthy-ish eats. The food is clean and tasty, the dining room small and a little cramped, and the prices are Manhattan. Service is good, but man, I do not envy them having to juggle the huge line of people or the tiny tiny aisles they have to squeeze through. My friend Maggie L and I shared the rosewater waffle and the chicken skewer with cous cous and salad. I also had a nana mint tea and she had coffee. The chicken was tender and juicy and complimented the green sauce and salad well. We definitely had more cous cous than we could eat, so the portion size is good. The rosewater waffle was okay - if you're not a fan of overly sweet breakfast, this is probably a good fit for you. You get one solid waffle which is a little on the dry side, and comes with a yogurt based whipped cream and berries. The rosewater wasn't noticeable and the syrup was very runny, so this was a meh from us. I left feeling satiated, but not quite satisfied.We showed up promptly for a 10 am ish brunch and had a 10 minute wait for a table. But when we finished, the sidewalk outside was crammed with waiting patrons and the wait was probably over 45 minutes. Given the menu items we had, I would probably willingly wait for about 20 minutes before giving up and getting a chocolate croissant at Ceci Cela. If you're a huge Mediterranean fan and like bougie locations, this is probably a 4 star location for you. If you're a value eater, impatient, or like more traditional American style brunches, its probably a 3 star.",3,,1
193,Jessica E.,"Chicago, IL",125,19,14,5.0,1/26/2018,"This place was recommended to me by a friend. As my NYC trip got closer, she reminded me that I needed to stop in for brunch multiple times. So I did. Quite pricey, but oh so delicious. I got the Medi breakfast which was complete with 2 poached eggs, a cucumber-tomato salad, labne, pita bread & avo! Since I'm a cheese addict, I opted to add 2 pieces of halloumi cheese. Perfect. (except for the fact that it was a $7 addition. wow!) My friend got the Madame Freda which was a sandwich with duck prosciutto, gruyere, cheddar bÃ©chamel & topped with a fried egg! I didn't try it, but my mouth watered as she did!When we first sat down we were quite hungry so we ordered the baguette hoping it would come before our meals. It didn't. BUT it was a delicious addition to the carbs already included in our meals.",,,
194,Shannon S.,"Washington, DC",210,199,817,5.0,2/19/2017,"My friends and I put our names down earlier in the morning, since the wait here can be over an hour! Jack's wife Freda is a popular brunch spot, and we had a great time. The restaurant is small and compact: There's a long communal table in the middle and then smaller tables along the sides. When full, the space is so tight that people were whacking me in the back of my head with their coats or bags when they squeezed by. However, that didn't detract too much from the overall brunch experience. My friends and I enjoyed several dishes: I had the Madame Freda and my 2 friends had the Mediterranean breakfast and the Green Shakshuka. The food was so good, we all gobbled up our meals and wiped our plates clean. The Madame Freda was amazing with the heavenly combination of smooth runny yolks from the eggs, salty duck prosciutto, melted gruyere and cheddar bÃ©chamel, and bread to sop it all up. Omg I'm telling you, it's a must-try!!",3,,2
195,Sonal B.,"New York, NY",55,170,20,4.0,8/13/2017,Whoa! did not expect the peri peri chicken with the green sauce to be so good and fresh here. I expected this to be a primarily breakfast/brunch place and hence the surprise in my expectations. Definitely good spot for lunch. I just thought that the $15 price tag for a chicken lunch was a tad bit much. Maybe $12-$13 would have been more appropriate.,4,1,5
196,Samantha S.,"Huntington, NY",1404,1149,1019,4.0,8/9/2017,"The food here is delicious and unique and affordable as heck considering the quality and portions. We came in later in the night on a Saturday and we were starving. We sat at the bar, which was tiny and maybe a little cramped, but it worked for us. The service was good and attentive and the place was surprisingly steady at this late hour. Like I said, their menu is unique, we started with the beet dip, which came with pita that the bartender brought another serving of when we downed the first one in a few short seconds. We may or may not have been day drinking prior to this engagement. Anyways, the beet dip, well it tasted how it sounds, beets in dip version and I love beets so I liked this dip. We also shared some roasted cauliflower, which was freaking delicious. It had garlic dressing over top and we loved it. For food food, I got the Chicken Prego sandwich and asked for it with salad instead of fries. It was tasty. My boyfriend got Jack's burger and definitely enjoyed that too. I didn't realize until after our meal that they have Matzo Ball soup, dang I love some Matzo Ball soup. Anyways, all that food and our bill was only $70, yeah we didn't have drinks and we got sandwiches and burgers and apps, but it's NYC, so I will take a $70 bill for food. They have adorable matches at the bar too that have cute sayings on them, nice touch.",8,4,7
197,Anna C.,"New York, NY",2,10,6,5.0,5/28/2018,"Went for a late breakfast with a friend. We shared the eggs benny and the green shakshuka. My friend and I preferred the green shakshuka because of the flavorful sauce, we even asked for extra bread so we could really clean up that plate. I'm definitely coming back!Ambiance was very cute and clean, and the staff was really nice. They even have a cook book that talks about the origins of the restaurant and the recipes for their dishes.",,,
198,Phoebe C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,8,43,4.0,6/14/2018,This is the second location that I have been in and I would say that the food was good service was great I definitely would highly recommend to come during nonpeak hours as the line for the restaurant will be long especially during lunchtime. I would recommend a chicken kebab with cuscus and salad or the Greeks salad but deafly asked for their Spicy in house sauce! As for drinks I highly recommend the melon drink it's exceptionally refreshing and delicious,,,
199,Danica M.,"Fullerton, CA",0,13,0,5.0,9/4/2018,"As soon as I walked into Jack's Wife Freda, I fell in love with the restaurant. Immediately walking in, the restaurant gave me a cozy, homey feel. The employees greeted me with a warm smile and were very friendly and attentive throughout my dining experience. I ordered the Prego Roll which is a Portugese skirt strak sandwich with garlic butter and it is by far my favorite sandwich ever! The skirt steak was bursting with flavor and the steak was cooked very well as it wasn't tough to eat at all. I also ordered the fresh cantaloupe juice and it was an interesting take as I think it was mixed with carbonated water or some other fizzy drink. I enjoyed my experience at the restaurant and I can't wait to dine there again!",,,
