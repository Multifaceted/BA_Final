0,Charles K.,"Brooklyn, NY",226,348,513,4.0,5/12/2018,I always come here for breakfast and Cafe Today really keeps me coming back. They have a buffet that I havent tried and then the grill which makes omelettes and sandwiches. I usually get the cafe today omelette with home fries. The cooks work really fast and although there is a long line during breakfast (open until 10:30am) they churn through it. Cash tips pile up on the countertop. They know what they're doing and they do it without breaking the bank. You can get a huge breakfast and coffee for under $9.,1,,1

I personally didn't get food because I was appalled by the manner that I was spoken too and treated.  Even after explaining to the manager how rude the cook was, they did nothing.  Get ready for the experience of a lifetime in this little gem!  Here's a clue chef happy, you're in the service industry, learn some manners. Skip past this one it's not worth the harassment.",,3,

There serve breakfast platters, all types of sandwiches, snacks, and there is even a buffet style in the middle with a variety of hot foods for you to grab that is charged by the weight of how much you want. It's incredibly busy during lunch time and gets crowded but the check out line moves fast to get you out quickly. Most people come in and already know what they plan on ordering too so it can be a bit intimidating when you come in for the first time. There is a different section for the different types of food where you would order and pick up and then bring to the check out line.",,,
3,Cousteau J.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,1.0,9/14/2018,"Finally writing a review for this place after dining here a couple times per week for the past 6+ months.  I typically get the House Salad and it's prepared incorrectly almost every single time.  The salad and ingredients are listed in large font right  behind the salad makers, so I'm baffled as to why this happens every time.  Usually I let it slide because I'm not picky and at this point it's almost comical to see what they come up with.  On the few times I have told them they need to start over, I get an eye roll with no remorse.  Followed up by this is me getting overcharged at the register.  The House Salad is listed on the board as $8.50, but somehow my bill comes out to almost $11 most days. I'm tired of places like this overcharging and providing mediocre product/services.",2,,

13,Rob S.,"San Diego, CA",0,6,0,4.0,7/16/2017,Was in NYC on business and this place was close to my hotel. We don't have these types of we-serve-everything deli/cafes in California and I frequent them when I travel to Manhattan. My go-to is chicken salad on a hard roll with a pickle side. For some reason delis in San Diego put onions in the chicken salad which I just don't understand. Cafe Today does a good job managing the lines that can be lengthy at lunch time. Grabbed a coke and come chips and I was on my way. Adding this to my list of reliable delis.,,,

The prices are fair, the quality of food is good. (Great Burgers) If you do not have patience, this may not be the place for you, they often are very crowded especially between 12:30 and 2.

While the place is clean, it lacks seating and the food options are pretty ""meh"". I decided to try out the buffet. The chicken teriyaki was okay, the edamame and chickpeas tasted kind of off, and the cous cous was very very bland.

I asked for a simple quesadilla with only cheese, two Hispanic guys behind the counter nodded and one with a ponytail/bun started on the quesadilla. I see him add avocado to it and once again remind him I only want cheese. He said yeah yeah and turns away from me as if he's taking off the avocado. I wait 15 minutes only to see that not only is the cheese not even all the way melted through but I have a half cold quesadilla with avocado. I went on another occasion to buy one of the ready to go cereal bowls they have, it was stale and covered in hair and dust.

21,Jim L.,"East Elmhurst, NY",165,12,0,1.0,9/9/2016,"We use this place in my office, so they get two stars because they're always very careful about making sure they get the order correct (never a mishap in the 2-3 years we've been ordering from them).  The food, however, is less than impressive.  I won't say the chicken salad tastes like garbage, because that would imply that it tasted like anything.  Not one bit of flavor.  The tuna melt could stand to be a little less watery--it's chicken *of* the sea, not chicken *with* the sea, and the pita bread it's served on tasted stale three of the five times I ordered it.  There are other, better places to go in the neighborhood; I'd only go here if the others had long lines.UPDATE 8/2017:  Found a chicken bone in my ""boneless"" chicken sandwich.  Never again.",,,

Their Korean food such as bibimbap comes in huge portion, the taste was fine as well.  They've got sushi, salad station, and even lunch buffet. And finally how can I forget about their $3.50 fresh pressed green juice?To me, there's no doubt that Cafe Today is the BEST lunch spot if you take all categories into consideration, because you could pretty much find anything to satisfy the craving when you are in any kind of mood.",1,,

A hot bar, a stir fry station, a sandwich and panini station, soup, sushi, and salad. A+ on the selections.I tried the stir fry. It looked good. And it tasted ok to begin, but as I kept eating, something tasted funny. And my stomach felt unsettled. I wondered if there is something ""off"" about the oil they use. I mentioned this to a colleague a few days later and she told me four of our colleagues felt ill after the stir fry and they thought it was the oil (maybe MSG?).As for the hot bar, there are some hits and some misses.

It's not hard to see white eggshells in a bowl full of clear raw eggs, so I guess they're just lazy.

Updated review","I have gotten food poisoning from the food here THREE TIMES. I thought it was just my imagination at first but after the 3rd time of getting sickened to my stomach for a day after eating the steam table stuff here....I'm DONE. No matter how lazy I am to go elsewhere, I will NEVER EVER step foot into this place again.5/3/2013: I searched the department of health and this place has the following sanitary violation:1) Food worker does not wash hands thoroughly after using the toilet, coughing, sneezing, smoking, eating, preparing raw foods or otherwise contaminating hands.How in the world they get a grade A after that is AMAZING. It absolutely makes sense why I got sick and if you continue eating here you must love eating food from someone who poops in the bathroom and then serves your dinner!",10,,2

Midtown East north of 42nd St. seriously lacks a good Korean restaurant, but fortunately for me, quite a few deli also has Korean food stations including Cafe Today.The udon is so-so, and not any different from other delis, but I love the bibimbap. You will have to line up together with the udon customers, but the staff are very fast and the line disappears quickly enough. The portion is amazingly big. I always debate if I shall ask for only half the rice, but the staff is so nice and ask ""is this enough? do you want more?""  The veges in their bibimbap tastes very authentic and tasty to me, and I never regret getting bibimbap here. Oh, it comes with small cup of kimchi - so don't forget to get it.  By the way, I tried Koso, too.

47,Thomas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,317,135,4.0,2/29/2012,"I passed by Cafe Today (what a name!) on the way to a meeting yesterday and was attracted by it's bright lights and clean surfaces. Restauranteurs take notice : if you want people to come in, make sure your place is bright and clean. I saw a few folks sitting at the window eating out of what appeared to be ramen/udon containers. This gives me hope. I have very few passions in life, besides collecting stamps related to Conway Twitty, learning how to dance on my hands and one day manifesting jedi powers. Beyond all that, I have an undying love for Tofu Soup. Cafe Today does not have Tofu Soup. (disappointing I know) They have practically everything else your standard deli does : hot/cold sandwiches, salads, sushi, udon station, buffet line, etc. Cafe Today also boosts bibambop as well as various noodle varieties. I saw them lay out rice noodles, egg noodles, udon, ramen, mein, etc. all in front of their ""Asian Station"" in the back. I decided to shoot for the beef ramen. It'll set you back $6.95 and comes with a pack of spicy ramen, scallions, bean sprouts, broccoli, mushrooms, beef, and a dropped in egg. Ramen was cooked just the way I liked it! Didn't appreciate the scallions... not a huge fan of bean sprouts. Definitely liked the broccoli and mushrooms... the beef was sliced thin and actually pretty good. It was fresh and red, they lay it out on a salad like line on the station table. They also served stir fry, lo mein and teriyaki dishes at the Asian station. I saw sriracha sauce behind the glass, and the chef (asian of course) seemed to douse the dishes with it every so often. Sriracha fans : this might be your sanctuary!Overall it's a close by option for pretty good ramen, I'll have to review their chicken teriyaki sometime. On their menu they claim it's ""what made them famous"" or something to that effect. I'm not sure if that's superlatives, or if Cafe Today is some kind of chain and actually makes good teriyaki. Stay tuned.",1,1,
48,Karina C.,"Deerfield, IL",0,4,0,1.0,12/28/2015,"Food was mediocre, but the customer service was awful. The associate completely ignored few customers asking to close one of the doors, so that the windchill would not blow on the area with the tables. After one customer shut the door, the associate came and opened them back up, saying ""sorry"". Not the place I would visit again.",,,
49,Mark D.,"Menlo Park, CA",6,47,0,5.0,6/21/2012,"I love this place! I go almost every morning for their iced coffee. Also, they have very good Vitamin Water Zero. The staff are always friendly and move the line along quickly. Do not try to give them a credit card for a purchase of less than $5 though, they will not stand for it. The young female cashier (Sara) is also quite pleasant to look at.",,,
50,Shella P.,"Manhattan, NY",24,40,1,4.0,7/11/2012,"This is my favourite lunch place in mid-town. It's clean, bright and the choice is crazy good. It's the best I've found and is now a lunch staple. In the winter it's also a perfect breakfast spot the oatmeal is great and there are a number of choices.",,,
51,Zach L.,"Massapequa, NY",0,57,22,3.0,4/18/2012,"Was waiting for this place to open up. The previous place Tomatoes, was nasty. The place looks nice. It's bright and clean with a great selection of foods.....sushi, salads, stir fry, hot sandwiches and regular deli sandwiches. There is also a hot and cold buffett with a full individual dessert section. The food is fine considering the type of place it is.  I only wish the staff spoke English a little better/clearer and were more attentive to someone waiting for service.Either get there early for lunch or wait until after 2:00 because it gets crowded. There not much room to walk around.",,,
52,Rob G.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",17,132,0,4.0,5/15/2014,"Very dependable lunch spot in midtown. The food is good, quick, and cheap. And there are a lot of options. I normally go with the turkey club sandwich or the udon noodle soup. The buffet isn't bad either here. We usually go here once a week for a consistent delicious lunch",,,
53,Joanie W.,"Portland, OR",17,54,0,4.0,4/2/2012,"This is pretty much my go-to place for lunch when I'm not sure what I'm craving. I generally love the stir frys (although be sure not to go too late - they close at 3pm and when I arrived at 2:50, the cook huffily scolded me while cooking my meal, assuring me that he is doing me a favor and this will never happen again). They also have a ton of sandwich options, a hot bar, salad and probably almost anything you can think of. Pretty quick in and out, if you're looking for an easy lunch solution.",,,
54,Maria B.,"Manhattan, NY",3,1,36,5.0,9/23/2014,I love going to Cafe Today for lunch. Their salads are the freshest in the area.,,,
55,Caitlin G.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",64,139,32,4.0,9/11/2013,"I've been waiting to write this review for cafe today to make sure it is accurate, and honestly this is my favorite place to come for lunch! I mean I do love the occasional chipotle visits, but in my opinion, cafe today is affordable, reliable, and efficient, with lots of variety.  I'm pretty sure they are open for breakfast as well, but lunch is when things get really crazy.  It's always super crowded, but they have tons of employees and really stay on top of things, so don't be fooled by the crowd.  There are tons of different options for lunch here.  Almost every single thing I've gotten (besides the serve yourself buffet) you end up with a large enough portion to consume for lunch and dinner.  There is a big sandwich bar where you can order all types of sandwiches, flatbreads, etc. however you like them.  There's a salad bar where you can get unlimited vegetable and fruit toppings, and a whole bunch of other toppings and dressings and they'll chop it up for you.  I love the salads! They have cajun shrimp that I really like, and they are constantly swapping out all of their toppings.  They also have an udon noodle station with lots of different meat options and toppings.  It's a huge portion! I can never finish it. And it tastes really good.  They have a whole slew of soups, snacks, drinks, candy, cookies, and all of that.  I personally think the hot bar is the worst options just because you pay by weight and that always ends up being more expensive.  With that being said they do have a large variety of stuff and it is all very good.The service is really good here.  All the employees are especially friendly and patient when you can't pick out your salad bar toppings. The ladies working the cash register are a little cold but their main objective is to shuffle people in and out of there.  I just think this is a great option for lunch because a lot of places will give you tiny sandwiches or charge you per topping on salads, etc.  If you work nearby, I swear you will start coming here multiple times a week! I'm a big fan of cafe today.",1,,
56,Gloria B.,"New York, NY",0,18,4,5.0,7/20/2015,Has everything you can think of/are in the mood for. My go to is the salad bar. Probably the best deal in midtown east and the reason why I've still never had chop't. $8.97 (plus tax) for essentially all the toppings you want + the bread roll. They also have a great deconstructed sushi bowl.,,,
57,Wendy W.,"New York, NY",3,149,14,5.0,11/9/2013,Cafe Today is definitely my cold-weather lunch spot. I love their udon station. I always order the vegetarian udon when the temperature dips. Go earlier though because once I went around 2pm and they had run out of broth so they were using miso soup instead. You would think miso and udon go well together but the soup tasted über watered down. The bibimbap's a winner with my co-workers too. I would hover avoid the fried noodle station though. All the dishes I've ever had there were too oily and under seasoned for my taste. The line sometimes feels long but the ladies are super efficient and the wait's never longer than a few minutes.,,,
58,Jeffer S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,22,0,4.0,10/18/2012,"A pretty solid lunch spot for me, especially since it's just across the street from my office.  It gets pretty hectic during the lunch hour but they're super fast.  The japanese soup with soba noodles is my go-to choice (partly because there's barely any wait at all) and the hot buffet is also a nice treat sometimes. Lots of potential to spend lots of money at the hot buffet, for sure, but over all pretty decently priced for midtown.",1,,1
59,James S.,"Bergen County, NJ",1,17,0,2.0,6/3/2014,"This place was my go-to stop for lunch, however last month they rose the prices on virtually everything on their menu by $1-2. The food is good, however if you are looking for a cheaper and just as good breakfast/lunch, go next door to the Oxford Cafe.",,,1
60,Julia G.,"Manhattan, NY",2,47,1,5.0,8/22/2012,"Every time I eat lunch here (which is now a couple times a week) I'm always satisfied. I've tried the sandwiches, hot/cold bar, sushi, and salad making and have always had a great experience. The food is always fresh and delicious. Sometimes the lines can seem long but they move very quickly and I'm not there for more than 15 minutes. Best lunch spot near my office hands down!",,,
61,Tracey J.,"Manhattan, NY",5,10,18,4.0,8/6/2012,"I used to work near here and in a neighborhood full of cafeteria-lunch spots Cafe Today is a definite stand out. The udon noodle soup is AMAZING, I usually get the tofu vegetable soup (extra spicy!). The line for the cashier looks more daunting than it actually. No credit card minimums which is great :)",,,
62,Brian H.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",2,5,0,5.0,5/24/2012,"This is my new favorite place by work. The best sandwiches I've had in NYC, they give you a lot and it's cheap! They also have sushi, a nice salad bar, a noodle station and a tasty hot bar. I've tried many dishes from cafe today and would recommend them to anyone for lunch in midtown.",,,
63,Nick W.,"Manhattan, NY",11,9,0,5.0,1/9/2013,"I don't know who owns Cafe Today, but whoever it is, they hit the nail on the head. We call it ""Crazy Cafe"" and probably go there 4 times a week at least. You walk in and it looks like a mad house. So crowded, so many things going on, so many food stations. It's ""Crazy"". But they work full speed there. You're in and out before you know it and you either have a huge salad with a million toppings, a sandwich that resembles a WWII fighter plane, or a pile of food from the hot bar that ranges from fresh veggies to whole fish that was probably shipped that morning from the Philippines or the Amazon. Oh and they sushi station that is on point. The best kept secret they have is the noodle station. It's run similar to the Soup Nazi where you order promptly and move to the right. The chefs speed and techniques are second to none. He laughs at the 900° flame that's inches from his brow as he tosses the meanest wok in midtown. Great dishes and flavor from the noodle station in the back corner. Basically, Cafe Today should have 5 stars and be zagat rated. It's the best restaurant in Manhattan.",1,3,
64,Allison M.,"New York, NY",0,82,1,4.0,2/23/2014,Go-to-Midtown spot for fast lunch -- plenty of healthy and vegetarian-friendly options to choose from. I eat the veggie bibimbap every week.,,,
65,LeBron J.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,7/13/2012,"BREAKING NEWS:  Sources say that Cafe Today has agreed to send stir fry superstar Chef Roni along with a 2 year supply of Udon Noodles, to Oxford Cafe in exhange for Chef Giovanni the Pasta Guru and a future 4th round draft pick.  If this is true, Cafe Today will be acquiring one of the most talented chefs in all of the metro area.  This move will put Oxford in a tough situation, as they will have a major void in the stir fry section.  There is no garauntee that Chef Giovanni will sign long term, but this puts Cafe Today in place to make a run for the chamionship this year.",,2,
66,John B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,4.0,11/15/2012,They are great when the people making the food actually put everything on your sandwich etc thats either A: supposed to come on the sandwich or B: what you request to be on your sandwich.  Im not one to complain but its getting persistently annoying.  Oh and keep the grill open past 2pm!!!,,,
