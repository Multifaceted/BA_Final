1,Shannon M.,"New York, NY",31,4,0.0,5.0,11/6/2018,"I love wine but know absolutely nothing about it, so I was a little intimidated to go to a ""wine bar."" I was put at ease almost immediately by the chill ambiance and beautiful setting (love the oval bar!) Our bartender James was incredibly nice and knowledgeable. Most importantly he was very patient and didn't make me feel like an idiot!",,,
2,Preeti K.,"New York, NY",275,48,22,5.0,4/30/2018,"I loooove lelabar. They have such a great happy hour deal here, and such a warm, beautiful space. I've been here several times with friends and have never had a bad experience. It doesn't get TOO crazy during weekdays and I've never had to wait for a spot at the bar or the back table area (granted, I've rarely come with more than 2-3 people). I've had many of their cheeses, the truffle toast, and a few paninis, and have never been disappointed. Everything is excellent and pairs really well with their wines. Service is also great and attentive. This is a perfect spot for a low-key meet up with friends or for date night. Highly recommend.",,,
3,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, NY",202,201,22,4.0,3/7/2018,"This is a wonderful wine bar option in the West Village. Enjoyed happy hour here with good deals, nice atmosphere and delicious South African wine.Even on a Tuesday, nearly every seat at the round table was taken.Would love to return!",,,
4,Ashley P.,"New York, NY",102,97,58,5.0,5/22/2017,"My friends and I came for happy hour and had a great time. It's an intimate and cozy bar, so don't expect to fit your whole squad. I recommend it for a small and casual girls' night out.THE WINE: The bartender let us try a Riesling, which was very enjoyable - somewhere between dry and sweet. THE BITES: We had some Fresh Burrata, and boy was that cheese fresh. The Quail Eggs were an overall crowd pleaser. THE SERVICE was great. We also had the Smoked Eel, but had no idea how to cut it up. The bartender did all of it for us. Thank you!",6,3,1
5,Erin R.,"New York, NY",343,126,65,4.0,12/28/2017,"Used a Groupon here and got to try some delicious wines as well as meats and cheeses. I probably didn't enjoy it quite as much because we were right by the door in the middle of January so I was freezing the whole time. It's a small space so try to get to the back of the bar as much as possible in the winter months. Other than that, though, it was a nice experience",,,1
6,Samuel P.,"New York, NY",104,106,0,5.0,10/1/2017,"Fantastic wine bar in West Village  -  quaint, cosy, dark, unpretentious. You can order glasses from the entire list of bottles, as long as you get two glasses. Their inventory management must be a nightmare -  but kudos! Wine list is extensive with a pretty diverse range  - they were missing some Argentinian and Chilean reds but aside from that the range is fantastic. Setting is a nice oval bar perfect for people watching, and you don't have to strain and wave vigorously to get the attention of waitstaff. The place can get loud though, so you would have to come during odd hours to get that perfect cosy snug whispering ambience with your hot Tinder date. They have small bites available too -  nothing to shout about, but they suffice as nice wine padding for the stomach.",1,1,
7,Ray K.,"San Jose, CA",5,116,92,5.0,9/6/2017,"Loved it here!The set-up is somewhat unique in the sense that the ""kitchen"" is at the bar as well since you'll see all the food/charcuterie prepped and served from the tiny space that the bartenders operate in inside the island.  The bartenders were VERY helpful in choosing out not only the wines but also any questions we had on the cheeses.  The vibe is very unpretentious so no fears on not being any sort of wine expert.  Decent amount of seating at the bar, the only drawback is that if you don't get a seat at the bar the outer seats look a bit removed/isolated and may affect the level of attention you get from the bartenders.I would definitely come back here!",,,2
8,Bill L.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,45,89,5.0,7/14/2017,"We came for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised.  It is a small place with self seating.  Oval shape bar then long small table along the walls.  Felt cozy, inviting, crowded, but the shape of the bar made for easy conversation with your neighbor because you don't have to turn your head too much.  Everything is prepared at the bar, high marks to the staffs working in such tight space preparing various small plates.We had two bottles of wine, one off happy hour menu and one not.  Both of great quality and relatively inexpensive for West Village.  We especially enjoyed the fresh oysters and smoked eel.  Definitely will be a repeat.",2,,
9,Bryan C.,"Hoboken, NJ",174,376,716,5.0,12/8/2016,Anybody that thinks they need a 5 burner Viking range and granite counter top to make great food needs to come here.  With less space that your average closet and nothing but a panini press some great food is made.  Not all of it raw as got perfectly cooked quail eggs over chorizo from a panini press. Service was good as both bartenders worked in tandem to service oval bar.  The bar is this lovely wood.  Place plays music in the background at level that allows one to talk easily.This is a wine bar and there are plenty of good wines by the glass and extensive bottle list.  Make sure to end your meal with the housemade chocolates.,1,,2

11,Grace S.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,119,187,5.0,1/23/2018,"One of my new favorite spots in the city. This wine bar is a few blocks from my office and I'm sad that  only just found out about it! In short, an excellent wine bar, with a huge selection of wines, with some snacks including sandwiches, charcuteries and cheeses. The spot is on the pricier side, but I think its worth it for the quality and the experience. The servers are also very knowledgae about the food and the wine, and provided fantastic recommendations.Apart from the food and drink, the other best part of this wine bar is the ambiance. The space is on the smaller side and I wouldn't recommend it for a larger group, but its a good date spot given its intimate environment. They also have a great happy hour deal from 5-7:30pm with discounts on a selection of wine, charcuterie and cheeses.Don't skip out on this West Village gem.",,,
12,Kyle P.,"New York, NY",163,259,226,5.0,12/9/2017,"This is a great little wine bar in the area. They also offer some small places. Their are seats around the bar, and a few seats on the side. Tons of wine choices and options to pick from. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. This is one of my favorite spots in the city, this place is a great date spot, and never gets to quiet. They have an extensive wine list as well.",,,
13,Tamar I.,"Miami Beach, FL",48,1,0,5.0,7/7/2018,"Lelabar is a great spot for a good glass of wine and some yummy bites.

14,Michelle T.,"New York, NY",349,1105,1096,4.0,8/28/2016,"Solid Happy Hour on a Friday night. We strolled in around 5:45-6:00pm and was offered the back wall area. There's 3 wine options for HH - one red, one white and one rose. I opted for the rose - the bartender comes and lets everyone try their wines first before he pours you your full glass, which is pretty generous. We opted to split their 3 cheeses and 3 meats, which came with bread and mustard. I quite liked the combo - there was, however, more cheese + meat than bread so we ended up just nibbling on cheese/meats at the end. Prices were reasonable and service was attentive enough. If I'm in the area again looking for HH, I wouldn't hesitate to stop by in Lelabar again.",2,,
15,Jane M.,"Brooklyn, NY",135,256,374,4.0,4/5/2017,"Came here for happy hour. A bottle of wine for $28, I'm in! The interior is dark and intimate, don't really recommend for large groups. I'm not sure how to describe the seating but it's basically a circular bar table with the people serving you in the middle. Menu is wines and some food items. My friends and I also had the cheese platters which I think you can pick and choose what you want on it. Also comes with frackers and fruit spread. This was really great to pair with the wines that my friends and I ordered. Anyway, it's a nice place to have some wine and cheese without scraping out a fortune in your wallet. Location is convenient to get to and I will be back!",1,1,2
16,Janet M.,"Highland Park, NJ",120,58,58,4.0,4/19/2017,"Such a cute wine bar.  It's very small, but I really like that.  They have a great happy hour! I've only been for wine, never food.  The one time, the female bartender was super super nice and when sparked up a conversation with us.  Definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a kind of intimidate atmosphere with great wine choices!",1,,1
17,Thalie L.,"Queens, NY",90,302,312,3.0,7/12/2016,"They have a nice happy hour with $28.00 bottle of wine and $12.00 plate of cheese/olive and charcuterie. When we came in, there was weird smell... it is pretty dark. But I liked the fact that the bar is encircling the bartender. It is more a Winter bar for dates. Price are pretty good for the area.",2,1,1
18,Nancy C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",270,150,233,2.0,10/12/2017,"Only bar seating here which isn't the coziest but I guess it's fine for normal, not so touchy people like myself. Pinot noir was good as it's a wine bar, but honestly the food was freaking weird. Well the bread and meat was amazing but the lardo was so unchewable I swallowed it whole. The eel tasted okay but it wasn't worth the effort to avoid all the bones and having to wrestle with it. With all the other good wine bars in the city I doubt I'll come back.",1,,
19,Jason S.,"Portland, OR",1,55,0,5.0,2/18/2018,"My wife and I spent two fun filled nights here after dinner.  The wine selection is so unique and clearly curated with care.  I had a red from Georgia (not the Southern state ;-) ) which was a first time for me and loved it.  They were featuring Langhe Nebbiolo and were pouring a beautiful one from La Morra.  The guys behind the bar were fun, friendly and well informed.  No pretension and no hesitation to pour a little taste as you make up your mind.  There should be more wine bars like this one!",2,,
20,Siyun Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",301,141,285,4.0,1/27/2017,"A very quaint bar in the West Village. I came here with my friend visiting from Australia to kill some time before dinner. We came when it just opened (5:00pm) which also happens to be happy hour! I believe happy hour is until 7:30pm and there is a white and red wine for $8 a glass or $28 for a bottle. Unfortunately my friend was not down for wine so I didn't get the bottle (don't want to be drunk for dinner now...). The bartender let me try the wines before pouring and the pours are indeed generous.We didn't order any food, but the food I saw being prepared by the bar looked really good. The bread looked amazing, will definitely be back to try that. The decor of the bar is also very modern and chic. I like how they hang the glasses on top of the oval bar. Its not very big it did get packed by the time we were heading out at 6:30ish. Also maybe because I brought an Aussie along with me, but everyone in Lelabar seemed to have accents. I guess this is where all the Brits go for a drink? Definitely come check this bar out if you're in the mood for wine, cheese and accents ;)",2,2,1
21,Diana B.,"Oceanside, CA",9,7,0,1.0,5/27/2018,"If you want good service, I suggest staying away from here. Rudest bartender ever. We sat down and the counter was super dirty, and after a few minutes I asked him if he could please wipe it down. He rolled his eyes and responded in a rude tone, ""Just a minute."" I decided to let it go, but then after fifteen minutes he still hadn't asked us if we wanted anything. I asked for a glass of water and got the same response. We walked out at that point. I'm not giving my business to a place that treats customers like that.",,,
22,Stephanie Q.,"Boston, MA",496,1574,1473,5.0,3/8/2016,"This is an awesome happy hour spot in the West Village.You can get a bottle of wine for $28, and on Weds and Sat, they have $1 oysters. Happy hour is from 5pm-7pm, the bar fills up quickly so go early.The bar is a long oval, and the bartenders stand inside. Its a really cool design. They only had one kind of red and one kind of white for happy hour. The normal prices of wines are quite high there, so $28 is a steal. You can also order a cheese/ meat plate for $12- you can choose 3 different items. We went for 3 different kinds of cheese.The bartenders here are knowledgeable about wine. Its also a great date spot.",4,,2
23,Khusbu P.,"New York, NY",188,175,352,5.0,2/24/2017,Incredible wine selection! Stopped by for some wine and cheese last night. The prices are reasonable and I heart they have an awesome happy hour.

The bartenders are attentive and knowledgeable which is always a plus!,,,
24,Maria D.,"New York, NY",0,11,14,4.0,8/18/2017,"Went here with a Groupon. The place was packed because of happy hour. After about 15-20 minutes of waiting, my husband and I got a spot. We got a board with 2 kinds of meat and 2 kinds of cheese and red wine. Nice ambience and worth the Groupon.

25,Collette S.,"Boston, MA",208,241,160,5.0,3/6/2016,"I don't know how I haven't Yelped about Lelabar yet, as it is by far one of my most favorite, if not favorite, wine bars in the city.The wine selection is incredible, a great selection by the glass as well as by bottle. Better yet, they will let you try wines and will open any bottle as long as two or more glasses are purchased.  The cheese and meats are equally as good as the wine, and perfectly paired with great recommendations from the staff!The sommeliers are always on point, so knowledgeable and eager to recommend a wine that you will fall in love with. Very friendly, always up for conversation, and it is clear that they work very hard to please their guests!And the atmosphere is great - one circular bar with some chairs against the wall. Perfect for a date, or meeting up with some friends before or after a night out. I've been here countless times, and will continue to come back and recommend Lelabar to my friends!!",1,,

A bit off the beaten path on the west side on Hudson, but worth the walk over. Cool oval shaped bar, decent bottle prices and wines. A bit loud; we got there at 8:30 on Saturday, and there wasn't any seats, but two soon opened up. Starts to clear out around 9:30ish which makes it more enjoyable.",,,
27,Filipe G.,"New York, NY",131,89,58,4.0,2/2/2017,"Was a great place to spend happy hour. Very crowded though. If you want to chill and have a wine, not the spot. If you don't. Ind the noise, go for it. Price is not the cheapest, but it is worth a try! Check out my other reviews for more :)",,,
28,Megan T. T.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,47,17,4.0,4/20/2018,"This  was a very good find. They have a very nice menu that consists of a lot of small bites, cured meats, cheeses, wine by the glass and bottle, bottle beers and a few sandwiches. We had some nice Brie and beef loin, delish! The lamb sausage was very close to ""sucuk / sojouk"". It was very tasty to me though my boyfriend found it to be a little too salty. The  only issue we had here is that our bread was COLD. Warm bread would have completed my life for the night. Next time hopefully.....",,,

Seems odd to have a list of over 500 wines with no tasting option. Bar tender was not friendly, mostly had his back facing me. Of the wine bars I've experienced in NYC thus far, highly recommend Corkbuzz near Union Square. Great wine tasting options or create your own & amazing service.",,,

And I'm totally cool with that, girls night!!!!!  But for the purpose of being informative on this review, you probably won't find Mr. Right at this spot, unless you bring him.  But still it's got a chill and homey vibe, and dim lighting - and what girl doesn't like that.",,,
33,Ina J.,"New York, NY",7,44,92,5.0,2/22/2017,"Hands down my favorite wine bar in the city.

40,Anne S.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",111,6,0,4.0,4/25/2018,"This place has amazing wines and glorious food - the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the music they play!   My opinion is that a wine bar with such a sophisticated menu should play music that pairs with the food, for example some adult alternative for a relaxed vibe such as Ryan Adams, Hosier, Beach House, Lumineers, Portugal the man etc...not heavy metal and 80s Pop!  I am sure I am not alone here.  You can hardly hold a conversation because the music is so loud and not right for the place.",,,

47,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1009,377,1497,4.0,6/27/2015,"One of my Top 5 wine bars in Manhattan. Great location in the west village, cozy atmosphere, knowledgeable wine servers, great diversity in their wine menu (meaning little emphasis on Napa & US wines and more options from all over the world). I think their food options are pretty good, though not as good as my other top favorite wine bars - Anfora, Terroir, Corkbuzz & Vin Sur Vingt.  Great place for a date or to meet up with a friend, or to just grab a glass of wine before dinner at one of the many great restaurants in the village (ie, The Clam, next door). Not that conducive for a large group though. Overall a great spot, and if you do go, please ask one of the servers for advice on the wine menu and to show you something different and unique and they'll give you small tastings so you can see if you like their suggestions.  Come on, get away from that ""fruit-bomb"" Napa cab you always order...you can do it!",4,3,3
48,Sara H.,"San Francisco, CA",11,29,1,5.0,4/1/2017,"Loved Lelabar. The waiters were so attentive and the space is really interesting -- set up as a sort of elliptical bar around the central area where the bartenders are. The food is excellent and considering it's located in the west village, the ambiance and attitude of the place is very chill. Wouldn't say it's cheap, but it really hits the spot for a ladies' night. Plus they sell wine by the half-bottle, which is deeply underrated.",1,1,1

51,Tiffany M.,"Flushing, NY",128,283,2522,5.0,9/25/2014,"Lelabar is the cutest wine bar! Definitely a fantastic place for a date night because it's small and intimate. The wine bar is basically a round oval bar and you sit around it. The stools are pretty big and there are hooks lined up underneath the bar. It's a little awkward at first sitting beside someone that isn't part of your group, but then you quickly get over it. I recommend going on a weekday evening. I'm not sure how crowded it is during Happy Hour but they have cheap Oysters on Wednesdays. Our bartender was very attentive and helpful with the wine selection. My boyfriend and I got a plate of meat with our wine. We tried the Wild Boar Salami, Prosciutto, and Coppa. My favorite was the Wild Boar Salami.

53,Lia K.,"New York, NY",80,438,102,5.0,3/23/2017,"Love Lelabar. Girls night for much needed drinks and randomly found Lelabar, talk about exceeding expectations. I was early, friend was late, and my gosh, in a time frame of 30 minutes (5:30-6pm) this adorable, charming, oval bar was packed. Almost every single bar space was taken up by couples and groups. I felt a twinge of guilt for taking up 2 spots at the oval bar, but not really, since I was sitting there sipping on a delicious white wine. Perfect wine bar vibe.BTW guys, the wine list, its phenomenal.The HH options are pretty decent by wine bar standards. the HH list is approachable enough, and the book lists seems to have some high end vintages/varietals too! For girls night, I matched my wine palette with my bud, so I veered off my usual path and went with a suggested glass by the wine-tender. We also ordered a Chartercurie platter with 1stinky, 1 goat less stinky cheeses and a coppa. We wanted Oysters, but alas, they run short on these guys (understandably!!). Our bread and cheese were a perfect little bites that honestly turned into a dinner. I was incredibly impressed how the food is prepared right in front of you, alongside the wine-tenders in the TINY oval bar space. Kudos. As the night wore on, my gf and I were definitely yelling at each other, just to try to hear each other. The bottle of wine might have something to do with this level of speaking. I will most certainly, definitely, be back for another happy hour and absolutely for a date night in the neighborhood. The trek from Uptown was totally worth it. Don't forget kids, its 4 glasses to a bottle of wine. Choose wisely. LOVE THIS PLACE. Date night? Check. Girls night? Check. Vino-phile night? Check. Just do it. It's also not too far from Christopher Sheridan stop. The walk is easy down Hudson.",1,,

The wine was a nice, medium-bodied red and the cheese plate was exceptional.  The brie was super creamy and was served with crusty bread.  A harder cheese was also on the plate along with a fig spread.  For the price, the plate was quite full - and filling!I would definitely go back to Lelabar.  Next time, I'd meet a friend earlier to make sure we'd get a seat at the bar.",1,,

Haven't been for happy hour (though other reviews indicate it's awesome for that, too), but it is the perfect neighborhood spot for a relaxing Sunday afternoon with friends or dates or even just on your own.Highly recommend to keep an eye on their site for events that they host - we did a wine tour of France with amazing snack pairings and the whole experience was more than I ever could have hoped for. Learned a ton, tried wines and foods I would never have otherwise, had great rapport with our tour guide, Chris.Great bar, great people, great ambiance. Check it out.",2,,

He shucked them right in front of us and they were delicious. I believe they were Malpec that night which is sort of a NYC staple, but they were still good. We got to spend a good time talking to the chef about oysters too. I say this a lot, and I've worked in small restaurants but I really feel that these establishments could extend their wine lists a little. As long as they are good wines, they sell. I hate when I have to chose between two different varietals that I don't love either. That said, a lot of places do this. We ordered the burrata, liver & a smoked fish & they were all delicious.",,,

But enough about creepy me. This spot is a classy, unpretentious wine bar. And it's full of people of the same kind. You're probably thinking, ""You just described every place in the West Village!"" But there's something extra relaxing about Lelabar I can't quite put my finger on.  The circular bar really allows you to engage with the sommeliers, who, by the way, are awesome. I always leave wanting to learn half as much as they know. I haven't tried too much of the menu but the cheese and meat plates are very good. I was a bit underwhelmed by the house-made pickles but otherwise no complaints.Will clearly be back soon.",6,13,3

You do have to come early or on an off day because the bar fills quickly. It's too narrow and small to really accommodate large groups standing around. But it's perfect for a quiet place to catch up with a friend or two.They have an extensive wine list, and I've been told they'll open any bottle with the purchase of 2 glasses - don't know if that extends to the $1000 bottle of Barolo but hey if someone's game to try I'd like to watch. Their wines cover the gamut from whites, roses, reds, and sparkling from all regions - France, Italy, South America, US, etc. If you can't find a wine here you like then maybe you're too picky. The choices by the glass are perhaps not as varied in terms of region, but they do seem to really try to make a selection that can appease all palates - dry, sweet, bubbly. I'll give them credit. And the bartenders are very well versed in the menu and are happy to help you make a selection without making you feel like a noob. Which is always a bonus to me - even if you have to listen to the obnoxious customers sitting next to you talking about how ""awesome TriBeCa is"" and how they'd ""totally live there if they lived in the city.""

If it wasn't that far we could have easily spend half the week sitting at that comfortable oval bar after work enjoying a glass or two from a large selection of bottles along with delicious little snacks. Whenever our path crosses this area we make sure we stop by to taste their latest bottles. Really friendly bunch of guys behind the bar and Wednesdays and Saturdays they have the oyster special. Their food offering also expanded so you can easily have dinner while enjoying great bottles of wine.

With that said, wine bar done right would be an understatement and Lelabar is possibly one of my favorite wine bars in the city now.The interior, albeit dark with minimal decor, has dim lighting and candles that somehow perfectly highlight the oval shaped counter that wraps around the entire bar. This and the seating definitely sets the mood for things like intimate secret sharing with your significant other for the evening while sharing a bottle from their extensive selection of wines. We sat right in front of the food prep area, so we had a chance to see all the various small bites made - things from beet root carpaccio (which was heavenly, by the way), grape cilantro salad and bottarga, just to name a few. They also have a slew of artisanal cheeses and cured meats to choose from. Try their istrianka salami, that with a dollop of apricot jam, paired with mustard seeds and one of the extra creamy cow's cheeses...soo good!",4,1,4

There is a huge selection. I'm not an advanced wine connoisseur but, really enjoyed the glass of wine that the bartender helped me pick out.  We ordered a cheese, I can't remember which one. The description was salty, sweet and savory with a hint of butterscotch and a bit of a crunch.  Holy cow this was some delicious cow cheese!  The serving was quite generous too.

78,Jordan S.,"Manhattan, NY",869,273,672,5.0,5/1/2015,"This place does everything you could ask for from a winebar right. Intimate setting, limited seating (so that it doesn't become an exercise in screaming and leaning), and reasonably priced, well-executed food that actually shares well. And the fact that you can drink any bottle on the list by the glass, so long as you get at least two glasses? Patently ridiculous. The list is easy to navigate (organized geographically, then by varietal, then by price, and while the variety of reds on offer is impressive (Negoska from Greece? Strong.), in my opinion, the whites are where it's at, particularly if you're down with Chenin Blanc from France (and if you aren't, you're probably a scrub). To sweeten the deal even more, there are featured bottles at happy hour for $28, which is often borderline retail price.The greatest positive, however, is likely the staff, who are in a league of their own. Winebars typically hire either the blasé, well-coiffed jagoffs who pour you the wrong wine while staring wistfully at the equally disentranced 'models' at the other end of the bar, or the over-eager, pseudo-wonkish types who refuse to believe that you have no interest in a magnum of Screaming Eagle cabernet. The vintenders here are genuinely attentive, warm-hearted people. They truly love wine, but don't snigger at the less educated or invested. They're happy to answer questions on any level, whether it's their favorite Kabinett on the list, or what goes best with the Gypsy Salami. None of this is to say that they don't have nice hair, of course. They just aren't dead behind the eyes.  If you like wine, you owe it to yourself to make a visit. And even if the dude (or lady) you've dragged out here for your requisite bi-monthly date night doesn't like fermented grape juice, they've got some pretty dope beers. (Just get him a Pretty Things ""Baby Tree"" and enjoy your Paolo Bea in awkward, silent contentment. You're welcome.)",33,19,26

The wine selection is great and they do have beers available as well for those looking to not imbibe in the good stuff. The $1 oysters were pretty small, but the 3 variety meat plate for $12 was not. Large mounds of freshly sliced curated swine with bread slices accompanied by cornichons and spicy mustard. If meat ain't your thing, they have 3 cheeses for $12 during hh as well. We also ordered truffled toast which was rich and truffley, but the price was pretty high for 3 small pieces of toast, I wouldn't order again.You bet I'll be adding this to my west village happy hour repertoire.

They're also good about helping you pick a wine that you like--I started with one, thought it had too much tannins, and then the bartender immediately recommended me another one, which was great.

The portion size was decent and I enjoyed everything on it. The bucheron cheese was definitely my favorite, it was very creamy and had a nice sharp flavor. None of the meats in particular stood out but they were still very good. I'm not a big wine person so I can't tell you whether the $26 was good are bad, we finished the bottle if that's any indication.  I'd stay away from the oysters.

96,Steve L.,"Tucson, AZ",242,222,251,4.0,2/25/2014,"Are you ready for this OKCupid.com adventure with rayoshine# and #tothegirls? That's right, fill in the single digit and maybe you'll have better luck than I did.Anyway, in the field of engineering, foreseeing failure and redundancy planning are critical elements. Life and dating are apparently no exception.By strange alignment of the planets, I had two dates in West Village on a recent Friday night. Great -- hopefully one out of two is promising. If not, at least I've scheduled both of them at really good spots that I've been meaning to check out so there's not much to lose and at least a cynically-written Yelp review to gain.Date #1 was meant to meet up with me at Gottino over on Greenwich Ave at 6:30pm but I got a text as I left the subway station on 14th/7th stating that work was creeping into the evening. She asked if I could meet further downtown and I hesitated since that could mean anything from SoHo to FiDi. I asked where and she recommended Lelabar. How well-designed a venue!So yeah, I set up shop by a pair of seats at the front. 6:30pm became 7pm became a text ""walking over"" became 7:15pm. But happy hour ends at 7:30pm -- oh no! I got the impression that the day was just not working out well for her but since she knew I was already there, she didn't want to downright cancel. She was still on the phone when she arrived, stating that she had already been on hold for 20 minutes with Expedia.com regarding a $200 credit issue related to booking. She was trying to get $80 back since she redeemed it for a $120 hotel thing but the website messed up (this is the part where you say ""Awwww, he LISTENS!"") and when she finally did come back inside about 10 minutes later, we narrowly made happy hour drinks on time and I told her she should just call again later and try a different rep. I got the house white, she got the house red ($8 a piece and solid).Ok! Date starts! Turns out the last thing she needs is a drink after this stressful day since she was out till 3AM after running into a client at a bar where it was better she tag along and play nice with the client than accidentally come across as snubbing them. Hmm, trend?Anyway, I considered moving us to the Wafels&Dinges cart when she said she lives right by the actual brick&mortar location over on Avenue B. I had an OMG moment and told her how I'd discovered that location when I was at the CultureFIX bar on LES and met the bartenders there Adam (who surprisingly and strangely was connected to my roommate at ""Pete and Chloe's Hangout"" --http://www.yelp.com/biz/pete-and-chloes-hangout-st-james?ob=1) and Tim. When I told J-Dawg (my date) about Adam and Tim, she was all ""omg you know the bartenders?"" and I said ""no, but I got into a conversation with them because I was waiting at the bar while my two lesbian friends were making out elsewhere,""WHEN ALL OF A SUDDENsome butch-looking and very polite lady with a Boston Red Sox hat came over and interrupted us to say it was her 35th birthday. J-Dawg was concerned that this was my just-mentioned lesbian friend but focused more on the lady's exquisite skin and lack of wrinkles. A quick smile test proved her freedom from wrinkles.Anyway, I missed multiple hints from J-Dawg that she really needed to get home and pack. I brush this off in retrospect but I was kinda dense at the time.After learning a little bit about each other, we paid off the bill (actually, she gathered her stuff and slowly headed for the door before I commented that we didn't yet pay for the drinks. oh hellz no!), she took a cab home and I went to the Starbucks by the Christopher Street stop to recover and prepare for date #2 to be held at Mercadito Grove (nice Mole tacos and something from the appetizers menu I can't pronounce) with a native SFer who's a 3L law student at Fordham who still hasn't called me back. I make myself feel better by realizing that May through July = bar exam preparation. Karmaaaaaaaaa ... for both?UPDATE: Ten minutes after writing this review, the 3L student got back to me. No real loss I guess since we're both too busy with life:""Hi Steve,I wanted to thank you for a nice dinner and good conversation the other night, and I appreciated the phone call afterward! I don't know if I felt the right kind of chemistry though, but best of luck on here (and of course IRL as well!)Take care, L-Dawg""Summary: Happy hour wine was nice, bartenders were very personable and relaxed. The food looked amazing (I'll be back to actually try it) and the atmosphere is spot-on.",,15,4

Updated review","What a disappointment.I used to love this place, and used to go when it wasn't crowded, and when they used to give you a decent amount of wine. It was a cozy place, with friendly bartenders and chilled vibe. I haven't been able to pay a visit in a while, and when I went last nite, it was sad to witness the changes... in worse.First of all the prices. You can't find a glass of red wine for less than $13, and when they pour it into yours, you just can't believe how little red nectar you are served. Using big glasses doesn't mean that you can pour less wine because you just assume that your customers won't notice. Anyway, I wasn't too upset about it. The wine was decent.What bothered me mostly was that it was 30 degrees outside (and windy) and I was sitting on a stool below an open window. It wasn't just barely open... it was WIDE open. The cold air was hitting my neck and back. I did bear it for half hour, because I didn't want to be the high-maintenance demanding guy who annoys the crap of busy bartenders who have more important things to do than getting out of their station and close a window. But it WAS cold, so eventually I politely asked him (along with my girlfriend, who was freezing) if it would be possible to close it. To my surprise he said he couldn't bc ""it would get to 98 degrees"". So I replied: ""So you are basically allowing 2 customers to freeze so that the rest can enjoy a warm enough temperature you want them to enjoy? Good... YOU CAN BRING ME THE CHECK, PLEASE"".Now, it wasn't hot inside. My girlfriend went to their cubicle restroom (quite dirty, btw) crossing the whole bar and it wasn't even close to be hot. A couple of people close to the windows (but not under it, like us) were even wearing their jackets. I don't usually complain about this type of stuff. I'm actually annoyed most of the times I hear people complaining about it. But this time it was different. It was windy, and the wind was hitting us.It was sad and quite arrogant of them to treat me like I was the unnecessary customer who could just leave if he wasn't happy with their temperature setting. They did turn off the ac, but it wasn't the ac that was bothering us. I guess they make so much money they can afford to ""sacrifice"" a few customers for the good of the majority (even though nobody else was asking to keep the window open except the bartender). Unluckily, I happened to belong to that minority, and considering the rich selection of wine bars in the city, there is no need for me to ever go back: they lost me for good.",3,,

Did a quick yelp search and voila! Ended up at Lelabar.We ordered a bottle of their happy hour white and the $12 plate of olives, cheese and charcuteries. It was also $1.50 oyster night so we got a dozen. We were very pleased with everything. The oysters were delicious and fresh!The male servers that work at Lelabar (I saw three of them) all seemed very pleasant.   We grabbed one more glass of wine before we left. The total bill came to $80, which I don't think is terrible considering the location.",1,,1
100,Johnny B.,"Rhode Island Sound, RI",0,262,1,2.0,2/20/2016,"I have been here a few times, each time attracted back by their $39 for $60 Groupon deal. Let me just say, it is really easy to blow $100 here on two people with just some simple food and drinks. Also the set up of the place and the lack of seating make for an unpredictable experience - you definitely aren't guaranteed a seat, and you may find yourself relegated to one of the wall tables, which isn't really a table at all. Also I have never been floored by the food - the cheese plates aren't that great, nothing to write home about, and the wine didn't leave an impression either.",,,
101,Jane P.,"Jackson Heights, NY",17,35,10,4.0,11/9/2014,"This is a great, quiet, inmate place you go to when you are catching up with a friend or even on a date. I wouldn't recommend bringing more than one other person here. The wine was a great price, during happy hour $10 a glass and tasted great. Next time I come here I would love to try their cheese and sausage platters because they looked delicious.Highly recommend.",,,1

Superb, topnotch staff - knowledgeable, friendly and they really know their wines - and a great space, an awesome long oval bar that makes for a warm atmosphere. Good for dates, meeting up with friends, and also drinking solo. Great & reasonably-priced happy hour and good food options, including a delicious range of meats & cheeses, as well as exquisite chocolate truffles. Extensive and wide-ranging wine list, and they'll open any open any bottle if you get a couple glasses. A perfect neighborhood bar that welcomes regulars and is also beautifully inviting to anyone who stops by.",,,

Updated review","Came here again with my boyfriend, this time on a Saturday night during HH. Great deals on wine and the small plates. Great array of olives to go with my red. We also tried the $1 oysters from the west coast -- they were just okay and a bit small.Overall still a great wine bar with friendly service!",1,,
104,Kate M.,"Manhattan, NY",10,49,0,5.0,3/5/2015,"I came here on a weeknight with a girlfriend, and it was such a great experience! The bartenders were knowledgable and very nice. We ordered an amazing bottle of red and a cheese plate. The bartenders took very special care to give a nice presentation on each plate that came out.The only downside is that the seating is very limited, so I would say it's not good for a group more than 3. Otherwise, I can't wait to come back!",,,
105,Lindsey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,158,592,4.0,6/19/2014,"I was looking for a wine bar in the area and happily stumbled upon Lelabar. They have an extensive wine collection - from glasses to half bottles to bottles - and a good variety of small bites. We snacked on the eel (painstaking to separate but tasty once you do!), the lardo (yum), anchovies on crostini (double yum since it is served with butter and scallion), and beet carpaccio (refreshing). The bartenders were knowledgeable about the wines and not at all pushy. In fact, ours even comped one of our small bites since we had a couple of bottles! Though this was my first visit, it likely won't be my last.",1,,
106,Irina P.,"New York, NY",31,63,173,3.0,5/2/2014,"Pretty nice, cozy little wine bar. The wine list is good, just enough of a single glass, half a bottle and full bottle wines sorted by grape variety as well as country. Decent ambiance though nothing really impressive. Mostly female crowd yet nothing too fancy.",1,,1

109,Justin A.,"San Diego, CA",97,1029,141,4.0,2/28/2012,"I have come to Lela on quite a  few occasions. Lelabar is quickly become my go to wine bar in the city: Not only is Lela the perfect spot to enjoy wine with the girlfriend, but it also a good spot to bring coworkers and friends. The spot is intimate with a very low-key feel. The wine list isn't huge by any means. Don't take this as a negative though, this is another great advantage to this spot as each bartender knows the wine list in and out. Whats the point of a large wine list anyway? I have to admit, I know nothing about pairing wine and cheese or meat. Every-time I come here, I ask the bartender to bring an assortment of cheese and meat based on the wines we are consuming. I have never been let down by their suggestions once. They also offer sandwiches and chocolates - all good.This is a great little spot in the West Village. It still seems like an undiscovered gem. For selfish reasons, I hope it stays that way.",1,,1
110,Jeanette L.,"Manhattan, NY",13,258,19,4.0,11/23/2013,"Came here for wine, twice in the same night. Great bar setup (for a while I couldn't figure out how the bartenders got in and out of the bar). Had their wine special and it didn't disappoint. Got it again second time around.It's a loud, small and sexy spot. When we came back for a nightcap, it was just a bunch of couples with empty wine glasses making out like high-schoolers behind the bleachers. Food looked good. Would return to sample some plates. Heard there's jazz on Sunday nights. Come thirsty, and not without a makeup buddy!",1,2,3

112,Katherine G.,"New York, NY",1,4,1,5.0,7/25/2015,"This was such a great find in the West Village! My friend and I wanted a casual night out with good wine and Lelabar was the perfect location. It is an intimate setting but you can still feel the good energy from everyone around the oval bar in the center. There was also seating away from the main bar along the wall. It was practically full but never felt crowded. The bartenders were knowledgable and friendly. They recommended a wonderful rosé, my favorite. We didn't order food but we were able to watch the bartenders prepare the cheese boards, etc right in front of us at the bar which was fun. We definitely regret not ordering the watermelon salad because it looked divine. I will most definitely be back.",1,,

The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about wine.  We told them what we were looking for and they let us try 3 different tastings, which I always appreciate.  We also ordered a cheese plate (yum!).  Good atmosphere for a date, esp a first date.  The energy in the place will see you through even an awkward one ;)",,,
114,Margaret T.,"Brooklyn, NY",531,357,59,3.0,6/14/2011,"This place is sexy and packed with couples. Come pre-paired. (oh how i love puns) Tried to come here for the $1 oyster happy hour on Wednesday but was told you have to get here early because they sell out fast. Oh well....next time. They have a few interesting beers (it's a wine bar, yes I know) on their menu so a couple were drunk with pate and boar salami both of which were delicious. The pate especially! I would like that smeared all over my body so I can absorb it through all of my pores...Ok, maybe not as tasty that way but the texture was smooth and creamy like La Mer moisturizer. The wine selection was good but not overwhelmingly long and the bartenders (I guess they're sommeliers...) were giving recommendations that sounded pretty good to people who asked. But then again, I pick wines based on labels so what do I know...",3,7,2
115,Amy B.,"Boston, MA",573,709,623,5.0,7/16/2011,"I stopped in here for a solo glass of wine when I was early to meet my group for dinner. I'm so glad I did--Lelabar instantly charmed me and is on my list of places to return when I'm in New York.Another reviewer nails the vibe when she describes Lelabar as sexy. Dim lighting, beautiful retro architectural details like a tin ceiling, and a gleaming dark wooden bar make this the wine bar equivalent of a boudoir. They've cleverly designed the bar so that all of the bartender's tools are either below or above the bar, creating clean lines of sight.I had a happy hour special, a glass of a Spanish red for $7.50 (there were also white and rose options). The bartender poured a taste before filling my glass--not a typical service with by-the-glass orders but much appreciated. I didn't eat, but checked out other people's food. The panini looked worth trying, and the olive and cheese platter was generously portioned and looked like the perfect sensual cuisine.My favorite part about Lelabar was actually the clientele. I eavesdropped shamelessly on an intelligent, well-articulated conversation between two women and the bartender on recent political events. On the other side of me, a couple swapped tastes of their panini and talked about wines they enjoyed. It was good people watching for such a small joint.Lelabar could easily get expensive with its extensive wine list, but I thought my happy hour glass of wine was very reasonably priced and a great quality. Next time I go back I will plan a longer stay at the bar.",3,,
116,Gloria C.,"Dallas, TX",1286,515,725,3.0,6/6/2013,"5 stars for the delicious $15 glass of Tempranillo I had here (probably my favorite wine all weekend), which I had to completely guess on because the bartender offerred no advice other than, ""we close in fifteen minutes."" It's okay, all we wanted was one glass after dinner so we figured we had plenty of time, especially considering there were about 10 people still there at 11:45. The place is pretty tiny, with bar seating for maybe 15 people around its oval shaped bar but it's romantic and intimate, and I can see it as a perfect date spot. Just be sure you or your date knows a thing or two about wine if you get stuck with the same guy we did.",4,2,2

Came here on Halloween with a few friends and we were not disappointed! They also let us use the Groupon for the Happy Hour menu (double savings, score!), so a definite bang for our buck. Along with our bottle of white wine, we ordered the appetizer sampler (salami, cheese, and olives) and the truffled polenta. The polenta and olives were amazing! But more than that, what we really enjoyed about our experience here was our interaction with the staff. My girlfriend and I were getting ready for our Halloween adventure that night and we basically got ready while sitting at the bar. The guys who worked at Lelabar were giving us feedback and were very patient about us lingering around for so long.I noticed that there were large groups of females at this bar (could it be because of the cute all-male staff?), so I'm not sure I would come here on a first date (although you could). I'd come here with someone you're already comfortable with. Will definitely be back again!",1,1,

I would say most of the wine you can get it from the store in cheaper price.. so in other words.. wine here wasn't that expensive.. We wanted some cheese and meat to pair it with it.. so we just go ahead and asked them to recommend us something.. we had brie as a selection of cheese.. and 2 others I totally forgot.. I am not a huge cheese fan.. So I know nothing about cheese.. I just told them ""NO BLUE CHEESE"".. as for meat.. we asked for their recommendation as well.. we ordered 3 cheese and 2 meats but they gave us 3 other complementary meat... we thought of ordering something but we were both pretty full from all the meats and cheese..At last, we just can't leave with desserts.. so we ordered the chocolate since they said is specially made for Lelabar.. We ordered earl grey, white truffle, and caramel seasalt.. earl grey is my favorite.. their chocolate is really rich.. so chocolate lovers.. make sure you order it!!There was also jazz music playing.

Mind blowing coincidence that made me love this bar even more.Other than being reunited by my star struck wine, the food at Lelabar is inventive and thoughtful.Selection of cheeses and charcuterie plate were fabulous.

I was pleasantly pleased with the wine, all of the cheese and the pairing in general.The atmosphere here is classy, quiet and dimly lit.

Perfect for a first date, catching up with friends, or just enjoying some wine on a mellow night without the hassle of dealing with obnoxious drunks or an overly pretentious crowd. I really like the setup they got going in the room - everyone situated along a large circular wooden bar table, with the bartenders standing inside. Almost like a rotating sushi bar where the sushi chefs can tend to everyone without having to move much. While sharing the same circular table makes drinking at Lela feel a lot more ""communal,"" the chairs are spaced out enough that you can still engage in intimate conversation without awkwardly eavesdropping on the couple next to you. Lela has a pretty impressive list of wines from different countries and regions, at various price points. I went out of my comfort zone and tried their sparkler flight - which included a prosecco and cava from Italy, and a brut from Israel. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed the three sparkling wines, especially the cava, which was most effervescent of the bunch and full of crisp apple flavor. My friend ordered up a couple glasses of the Bordeaux which came at the recommendation of the bartender, and seemed to have enjoyed that as well. Besides the excellent wine selection and chill ambiance, Lela also has a pretty good looking food menu consisting of cheeses, charcuterie and other small bites.

We ordered a dozen and each ate one and discareded the rest - they were absolutely inedible.The cheese plate, on the other hand, was really delicious and a good value.

I recommend the SPATBURGUNDER (German Pinot Noir), this is the wine I finished with.  My wife wanted to try something different from me, so she tried 2-3 different wines, but ended up getting the spatburgunder with me because it was so good, and reasonable compared to others.I was teetering between a 3-star and a 4-star rating.  Would have given 3.5 if that was an option, but the service pushes this to a 4 star rating.  The waiter wasn't bothered about trying multiple wines before settling on a glass.  This was a nice touch considering the price of some of the glasses.I would come back to try their happy hour.",,,

The bar, itself, caught my eye earlier. It seemed mellow and picturesque.  Standing from the outside it seemed so symmetrical, with two bartenders framed by hanging wine glasses, and a moderate amount of people surrounding the oval bar.  I almost felt embarrassed about being disinterested in the wine but the oysters were calling. The noise level was perfect for me.  It wasn't too loud where I feel like my vocal chords would get tired from speaking and it wasn't too quiet where I feel like I need to whisper.  The environment and design of the bar is so relaxing. We started off with the thinly sliced turnip with black truffle tamponade. The bartender was very gracious to us and served it quickly. Next, I popped my friend's oyster cherry.  I ordered the dollar oysters.  I forgot where they were from that night, but they were fresh and awesome. She loved it. To finish, I ordered the cashew caramel with sea salt.  I'd like to just share my friend's words on this dish. ""The caramel is not like the fake caramel you get everywhere.""  She is right. I loved this desert. There was just enough salt to enhance that creamy caramel... I was giddy after eating that caramel. I keep raving to my coworkers about Lelabar.  One day I'll definitely be back.  Next time, I'll probably sample their wine.",1,,1
138,Yuliya N.,"Manhattan, NY",108,26,0,4.0,8/16/2012,"Came with my boyfriend on a Saturday night. The yelp reviews set a high bar and I'm glad to say that Lela did not disappoint. Here's my breakdown:Food: 3-4/5. We ordered a plate of 2 meats, both of which were delicious (as were the cornichons that came with!). We also ordered the beet tartar which was a bit disappointing. Our waiter (more on him later) made us these tiny toasted spicy salami and brie sandwiches which were, no joke, the best sandwiches Ive ever had in my life (ok by this point I was pretty wasted so maybe it was the alcohol talking but they were legit).Wine: 4-5. We started with a flight of 3 spicy, bold reds. They were good, not great. But then our waiter recommended a Spanish red that was amazing (so amazing we had 3 glasses each, and he kept topping us off...). Definitely ask the staff for recommendations: they seem to know their stuff.Service/ambiance: 5+/5. I don't know how they do it, but this bar walks the fine line between being full and overcrowded. Every seat around the oval-shaped bar was taken, but it didn't feel like... well, like a popular Soho bar feels at 1 a.m. on a Saturday night. Our server (Ryan) was knowledgeable, funny, and kept topping us off, whether it was with wine or with extra bread for our salami. The prices are a bit steep (around $15 per glass), but for a nice night out, I'd highly recommend this bar.",3,,

Always a pleasure visiting Lelabar!$1 oysters on Wednesdays are a crazy treat. No where in this town can you beat a deal like that. A great place to take friends who are visiting.,,,
146,Lisa B.,"New York, NY",97,24,6,4.0,10/6/2013,"The staff were super friendly, even as I waited without my friend for around ten minutes just perusing the menu. The interior was cosy and had a nice ambience, although the AC was a little cold which took away from the otherwise warm look and feel of the place, but not a huge issue.The happy hour deals and suggested wine flights are well priced, but otherwise buying by the glass can get a little pricey. I think it's great that the staff let you taste your wine before you commit to the whole glass. Foodwise, some very fresh looking oysters and  lovely cheese and charcuterie selections, prepared with care on the spot. An intimate and cute place, perfect for a date or a catch up with a friend (but not great for groups). I'll be heading back!",,,
147,Rajeshwari C.,"New York, NY",20,89,4,4.0,6/29/2014,"Oh Lelabar, what have you done to me? Every Thursday, I have this incredible urge to rush to you and sip on the happy hour wine. It't not just the wine that makes me crave, but the cheese and charcuterie served with unlimited hot bread as well. I don't stop there, bring on the lamb sausage and more wine once the happy hour is over. I love the feel good atmosphere in Lelabar, disengaged from the outside world. Dim lights and dark wood furniture add to the coziness. Its a wine lovers paradise, having a wide selection to choose from and the perfect small bites to go with it. The seating arrangement is simple yet interesting - a wrap around communal table with the bartenders conveniently positioned in the middle. The bartenders are friendly, help you pick out wine and swiftly prepare your food with finesse. I can go to Lelabar alone, with my girlfriends or on a date night. It's my new favorite wine bar in the city and will rightfully remain so for while.",2,1,1

The bar is too small so come don't come all together. When you see girls come in, offer to let them sit where you are, then chat them up. If you are good looking, with a good personality and not creepy, chances are the girls will be quietly pleased. Maybe suggest taking turns sitting at the bar or on each other's laps? That should get a giggle. Yes, way too many girls here, and that means it gets crazy loud for such a small place. I had to yell at my girlfriend, which only contributed to the problem. Owners should install those ceiling structures to disperse the sound better. It's great that they will open any wine if you get 2 glasses.",,,

Just come on in after a long day at work, sip some vino and take the edge off. Most of the patrons are there on dates, and most are getting cozy so Lela is doing something right.A great selection of wine, with solid daily happy hour options as well. Wednesday is $1 oyster day (See, all the more reason to plan your date on a Wednesday). The bar itself (and majority of the seating area) is a large oval.

154,Vanessa X.,"Chicago, IL",169,487,0,3.0,4/19/2012,"Not what I expected. The wine bar is essentially an oval shaped table in the middle of the room, with space in the middle for the servers/bartenders. The patrons all sit by the bar. There is a smattering of seats against the wall but they face the wall and they are quite depressing. However, I must say sitting at the bar here is a good experience. The bartenders are great, very knowledgeable, very accommodating and very friendly. They will also not feel like they are in your face even though they are standing practically right in front of you and you fear all your dirty conversations will be heard. That's not the case because the acoustics in the room somehow muffles the voices of everyone except those closest to you that you are conversing with. It's communal bar seating, but you still feel like you have your own space. Brilliant!Based on the recommendation of the girl bartender, I tried a couple of wines and finally settled on a sweet fruity one that I really liked. After hours of sitting on the bar seats, I never felt tired or uncomfortable. The thing is, sitting at the bar provides more intimacy than if you're sitting facing each other at a table, because even though you don't face the person you're talking to directly, there is no physical barrier between you. So if you're in the mood for something a little different than the typical wine bar, try this place.",3,,

So, we had them open a bottle of Spanish red having 2 glasses at first, not sure if we would drink the whole bottle.

Small and cozy, but not too tiny, too crowded, nor too reliant on taxidermy décor.

One suggested some wines that were spot on the moment we tried it. Everything is done at that oval shaped bar and their cheese and meats were ridiculously good. Every single cheese we tried (I believe we tried 4) was great and fit the description on the menu. The bleu cheese paired with their in house pineapple spread was by far the most ethereal. I got to the point where the sprig of rosemary on the cutting board started making it into my mouth because every combination seemed to make sense. (It was delish).We went on a Thursday night it was really loud and friendly atmosphere but one thing that I wouldn't call it is romantic. Sure, after a few glasses of wine the place really becomes something more intimate in my mind because my focus just shifts to the person that I'm with, but the oval bar forces a more communal atmosphere and the exterior seating around the walls offers privacy but also distance from interacting with the bartender. The lighting was also dim which is nice and romantic, but at times it made it pretty difficult to read the menu..of which I think there isn't too many since the bartenders had to play cycle the menu around quite a bit as new  people or new wine requests started pouring (ha!) in.All in all this place was really fantastic and date worthy but I don't know if you would propose to your significant other in this particular setting.

I forget what they were called, but we had the French goat cheese and the Oregonian (or was it Vermonter?) cheese... either way, excellent.  They were served with a pineapple spread and fresh-cut baguette, which we got much more of after eating our first serving.It was a quiet night, so the bartenders were chatting with one another as if they were patrons of the bar.  This did not take away from the service too much (except that we had to ask for more bread before we were offered).Wine was not cheap, but it was served in the ultimate red wine glass and was a hefty pour.  We were both buzzed and stuffed as we had to force ourselves to take the train and not hail a taxi on the way home.",2,,1
183,Angelina K.,"New York, NY",158,128,19,4.0,2/11/2011,"If I could sum up my experience at Lelabar in one succinct sentence, I would say: The happy hour made me very happy indeed. We ordered 4 bottles of wine off the happy hour menu, 2 being a merlot blend, 1 malbec (which they had to sub in for the merlot blend after they had run out) and a sparkling wine. I know that we were supposed to keep it classy and drink slow-- after all, we were drinking out of wine bottles made out of real glass, not boxes, but the merlot blend was so delicious, I drank it like I was drinking Welch's. We were pretty happy with the 3rd bottle, until our adorable server (who kept our wooden slab always stocked with bread) lightly suggested that we go for another bottle before the happy hour was over. But, all good things must come to an end and I was pretty miserable the next morning. I do need to go back and use my yelp deal since I didn't read the fine print that said it didn't work for happy hour. I felt a little suckered but my wine buzz overpowered my disappointment.",4,3,4
184,Amador A.,"Queens, NY",427,756,202,5.0,7/27/2009,"I had a great time here. We came for Fridays happy hour. Their Happy hour menu consisted of 1 white or 1 red wine bottle/glass, both very good and beer from all over the world. For food they have small assortment of pressed sandwiched or you can get an assortment of meat/cheese combo which all complements the happy hour wine very good. If you don't want the happy hour menu they have an extensive wine menu and a larger food menu (nothing filling, just small snacks that go well with the wine they carry). I would love to go there Wednesday for their Oyster night as they did not have the Oyster special on Friday. Small wine bar but very comfortable and warming. The bar is 3/4 of the space but if that is all booked there are benches against the wall which still seems very comfortable. Crowd is trendy and young. Great Place I cant wait to go back again!!!!",1,,1
185,Mandy L.,"New York, NY",115,623,1591,4.0,6/29/2013,"This is a beautiful, cozy wine bar that has a large U-shape counter centered around the space--makes for good, communal chit chat.   The wine list is impressive with over 150 options and all are available by the glass.  Yes, this is a wine bar, but the small bites are deliciously addictive.  My favorite is the chopped up watermelon tossed with salt, pepper, olive oil and topped with a light flurry of mint and feta--insanely good and refreshing on a summer's day.  Others enjoyed the grape salad, but avoid this if you don't like cilantro.  And don't forget the $1 oysters on Wednesdays and Saturdays!",1,1,1
186,Aly Y.,"Morristown, NJ",12,265,12,3.0,5/17/2014,"After a disappointing dinner at Le Gigot one Saturday in early May, we thought we'd end the night on a more positive note at Lelabar.  I guess it wasn't our night.  Although I love the concept and their menu, the place was just too packed and noisy.   I thought it was pretty smart to provide a ""cheat-sheet"" with the names of the wines when you order a flight.  I hope to return when the place isn't so crowded.",,,
187,Aaron L.,"New York, NY",313,120,1,4.0,3/20/2011,"While I've already confessed to my online dating habits in my review of Xai Xai, I have to admit that my tastes have evolved since then. No, not my taste in women -- I still masochistically chase after crazy broads like a hawk diving for fish in a lake of fiery lava. Rather, I've needed to update my dating locales to add a bit of variety to my dating venues.Lelabar is just the ticket. There's no particular gimmick to Lelabar's venue: it's unobtrusively decorated, well-stocked, tended by intelligent and patient sommeliers, and despite being a a small space, they have found a way of creating a huge amount of seating by building the entire bar in the center of the room. They do have some surprising deals like $1 oyster night and some very impressive deals for Yelpers on occasion, but the reason to patronize Lelabar is for the atmosphere: this is the only wine bar I know of that has a somewhat playful, youthful ""happy hour"" vibe to it. That isn't to say that it lacks class; it remains extremely mellow in contrast to the area's other traditional bars.I'm still not the biggest fan of wine (I know, I know) but I know a good bar when I see one. Moreover, I know a good date spot when I see one! If you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to give Lelabar a shot.",2,3,
188,Lena S.,"Brooklyn, NY",76,18,3,5.0,8/7/2011,"The dark seductive atmosphere, the endless wine selection, the delectable cheese, the freshest of the fresh oysters, and the exquisite chocolate: yes, this is a date spot. I went there with a friend and my rommate, but literally everyone else was paired up that night. It is actually possible to carry on a conversation at the bar without having to plant your ear at the lips of your companion, unless of course they wish to wisper something softly to you. And one oval-shaped huge bar cradling attentive bartenders in the middle of the room, is a fantastic replacement for tiny tables commonly found in some other wine bars.The wine glasses are huge, which creates a misapprehension that all you had was a fifth of a glass. Very clever and very dangerous oenological illusion.",1,,1

The trains weren't working right, it was too cold, I was fatigued from work, and realized I was underdressed for this kind of weather. Then I got here and forgot about it all. Cozy, dim, relaxing. Great for private conversations. Wonderful for kicking back after work and chilling with a friend or two. Red wine, white wine, fresh oysters for $1 on Wednesdays and Saturdays. I would come here everyday if it wasn't so far away from me. And if I could remember exactly how to get here...",,,

The wines aren't too expensive and any one of the bottles of wine they offer can be opened if you order at least 2 glasses of it. The bar is small, but the space is well organized so you don't really notice how close the quarters are. Lelabar has a great vibe and it gets my vote for best atmosphere at a wine bar. Go there.",1,,

194,Stephanie H.,"Mount Pleasant, SC",272,331,315,4.0,11/21/2013,"Dark, intimate and very friendly bar staff, I have nothing but good things to say of this place. A friend of mine and I went one evening in September this year during the week and the place was populated but not overwhelmingly crowded: not sure how it is during the weekends, since the space is small(ish), but the wine list is phenomenal: medium-sized but very well chosen wines. We had a northern Italian red wine- a 2007 Barolo- that was absolutely out of this world. Winery was Damilano, which I visited while I was in Italy, so I knew we were going to get something phenomenal. Two bottles and a cheese plate later, we both stumbled out and tried buying a bottle online. I think this bar is the last place in the universe that still has some in stock: the 2007s are sold out everywhere!!! Bottom line is that this bar is selective when it comes to their wine list, but they go for the best. Only caveat is that because the wines are top notch, you will be paying for it. The bar does not over-charge (typical up-charge), but you'll be spending some $$ here. Totally worth it for a nice evening out!",,,
195,Sam P.,"New York, NY",1877,875,636,5.0,8/2/2008,"I think I'm in love.  Really it was meant to be - this bar combines so many of my favorite things: Hudson Street, good wine, a charmingly quirky staff, a warm atmosphere, brilliantly subtle decor - a stately oval bar, translucent leaf lampshades, wrought iron filigree - good food, it was a match made in heaven.I popped in here to catch up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while at his suggestion and he gets major credit for finding my new bar crush.  Wednesdays they have $1 oysters so we split some - delish.  He went with a flight of whites, and I settled on a lovely Verdejo (I was even informed that it was a new wine on the menu and that I was the very first person to try it). Eventually we ordered food - two delicious paninis.  I will say they took a little too long to arrive, but that's not enough to mar my love for this place.Come, linger, listen to Miles Davis and Etta James as you sip wine, slurp oysters, and relax.  I feel very certain you'll find me there.",6,3,9

The space is not too big, so it's not good for large groups. That being said, it's a very intimate spot with a cute, romantic atmosphere. They offer a flight (3 samples) of sparkling, white, or red wine for $16. They also have ginger beer and lemonade if you're in the mood for a non-alcoholic beverage.",2,,1

198,Geraldine R.,"Manhattan, NY",11,21,14,4.0,3/30/2014,"I literally ran into this bar because it was pouring out and it was the first bar we ""ran into"" after dinner!  It was perfect!  A great wine list. Even though I wish they had a little more of a selection in the $40 range. It was quaint but not cramped!  Loved it. I want to go back so I can try their cheese plates and such. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars cause I didn't get the full experience. It's a great place for a date, catch up with a friend (that was my case), or a group of friends!  Gorgeous wine glasses as well!  Can't wait to go back!",,,
199,Michelle L.,"Livingston, NJ",219,505,186,4.0,10/13/2011,"This place has a lot to offer. Besides the amazing wine selection, their food is scrumptious. $1 oysters, beds of cheeses and meats, pressed sandwiches and other assorted tapas are perfect pairings for the wines you'll indulge in. While not cheap, the wines are full bodied and the staff is generous in letting you try a host of varieties to find just the right one. While not many are sold by the glass, they do offer to open a bottle if you plan on drinking at least two glasses which never turns out to be a problem. The atmosphere is cozy, warm, very downtown. Happy hour is a bonus so get there before 7:30pm to imbibe!",,,
