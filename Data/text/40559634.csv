I accompanied a friend after a concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom as it was literally next door. I guess it's not advisable to have really high expectations when venturing into a diner, but I thought these guys did a pretty good job. The coffee was refilled without asking, the menu boasts a pretty good selection, and I was pleased with what I ordered. I had the grilled chicken caesar wrap with a side of spicy waffle fries. My companion got a chicken club sandwich with French fries.One thing that should be worked on is the awkward procedure of seating guests. There's no convenient place to actually wait to be seated and we stood right inside the door for a number of minutes before a server finally flagged us down.  Overall I had a positive experience and if in the area super late at night, I would stop back in. It's certainly affordable.",

This time, I was disappointed; taste as if it was from a jar. What makes a good restaurant for me? Consistency....Secondly, I ordered Chicken tenders. I expected real cutlets from the breast; I received what appeared to be chicken pieces from a grocery bulk pack.  This diner is a block from Madison Square Gardens; come on! Finally the coffee was stale.  I will return again only for the Belgian waffles; it's the only consistent item for me.",

I've walked by the Tick Tock before, and this was a diner I wanted to go too.Atmosphere: When Tara and I arrived around lunchtime, it was crowded, but we quickly got a seat. In fact, we got the most corner booth, but it was nice to stay private.The outside of Tick Tock is bright, shiny, and stands out. It's directly across the street from Penn Station, and you can't miss it.It's the largest diner in Manhattan. There are plenty of booties, and tables, and even a full-length bar.Coffee: The coffee was brewed hot and fresh, but I could have used more refills. I also appreciated the personalized mugs.Food: The Tick Tock Diner has plenty of options from breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. There are several healthy salad options and huge burgers too.I decided to order the Tick Tock Pancake Trio which came with a banana pancake, cinnamon, and chocolate chip. Plus there was delicious cream cheese frosting too. To be honest, they were some of the best pancakes I've ordered!Service: I was happy the food came out quickly but the waiter barely came over, and it took a long time to get the check.Overall Thoughts/Would I come back?I liked the Tick Tock Diner, and it's one of my favorite diners in the city.",1

Walked in and was immediately confused as I wasn't sure if I should seat myself or wait. Eventually the hostess seated me and Joseph waited on me. Got some water and a single pancake with bacon and eggs. Ordered well done bacon and it came out just like that. Food literally was on the table less than ten minutes after ordering. Joseph periodically checked on me while I scarfed down the deliciousness in a hurry. Finished, paid and off to the next stop. I see why this is such a popular place. I'm going to try and come again when I get back to New York the next time. Great place, relatively inexpensive and highly recommended.",1

So we went to a movie at the AMC theater on 34th Street in Manhattan. Across the street, a diner is there called Tick Tock Diner. Walking in you feel like you're in the 50's. Very cool decor. We sat down at a table and a very nice waiter named David came over to help us.The place was a little shy of guests but it was nice nonetheless. I ordered a dish called Great Balls Of Fire. Basically macaroni and cheese balls that are fried. OMG, amazing!!The french fries are thick steak fries which are always nice!All in all, I may have missjudged a diner, but i will definitely go back!!",

There are a few great diners left in NYC that are standing the test of time and the great diner-extinction event of the last decade. This is not one of them. But it's alright. This place doesn't hold a candle to spots like Parkview Diner in Brooklyn, or Cross-Bay Diner in Queens, but it's not terrible. One thing I have to say for them is that their menu looks awesome. It's very exciting. Like a menu at Red Robin or something. With huge pictures of juicy burgers, snazzy colors, and modern design. Unfortunately, the food looks 100x better in the menu than it does when it arrives on the plate. Our food was ok, but we were expecting better. And for the price/value? Well, it's midtown so I don't want to be too scathing. I guess we got what we paid for. It was just alright, but I don't think we will be back. Additionally, the service was really slow and it didn't appear to be too busy inside. It's got a great proximity to the big AMC theater across the street though, so this is a prime candidate for lunch before/after a matinee or late dinner after an evening showing. Cheers!",4

I had low expectations upon coming here since it's a diner and not a legitimate restaurant. These expectations were put to same as soon as my meal arrived. My sandwich, fries, and beverage were all satisfying and freshly prepared. The waiter was super attentive and earned every cent of his tip (constantly refilled our glasses, came around to see if we were doing okay, etc.) The prices are very affordable as well. I wouldn't mind coming here for a second to get a quick bite to eat either before or after attending another event at the venue next door.

Served by waiters who make you feel like it is your privilege to tell them your order, Tic Tock takes the bar for a diner and drags it to the floor (if not lower). While most diners aren't expected to be world class restaurants, they can usually be relied on for serving a lot of different dishes of relatively good quality. Tic Tock fails at even this basic test. Against my better judgement, I ordered a BBQ Ranch burger, that came out with a tiny dollop of ranch dressing on a sad looking burger. Despite their boasts about high quality meats, the value of the cow is useless if the burger is cooked dryer then the Sahara. Though perhaps I made the best selection of the menu, as my friends chicken and waffles were 2 sad looking chicken tenders served on top of a luke warm waffle - a far cry from how the meal was actually described. Much like the clocks lining the walls of the diner, eating here will lead you to wish to count the time until the sweet release end of your so called meal.",8

Let me explain to you what great wait service entails. Customer seated by hostess and waiter comes over, greats the customers and recites specials, wine and beer list without having to read off a list. Waiter makes that personal connection with customer by asking if they've ever eaten here before, etc. None of that happens at TickTock.Tick tock, tick tock, the burger came but it was not hot.

At 7pm on a weeknight it was fairly empty, so we got to sit at a full booth which was nice. Our server was very nice when we spoke to him, though it did take him longer than I expected to come over to take our order! He also never came over to check on us/ refill our water during our meal. Our food and milkshake came out pretty quickly. I did have to remind the waiter that fries came with my sandwich and he brought them out soon after. I really enjoyed my tuna avocado melt! They put a lot in the sandwich so it was very filling! The Texas toast was super crispy and buttery! My boyfriend got the garden burger which was pretty standard, as was the cookies and cream milkshake. The fries were nice and crispy! Overall, I was pretty satisfied, especially because of how hungry I was. I think that this place would be great for a late-night meal!",

It even has a bar in the diner. It's called Tick Tock and it has a wall full of phrases and sayings referring to time in some way. Very creative. Chicken and waffles was listed on the menu. I automatically assumed it was fried chicken with bones in. It's really chicken fingers (small, none-the-less) with waffles (big if you like it). That's a skip. Chicken was ok, but leaves you wanting more. Maybe the ""125th Street Buttermilk Fried Chicken"" is better.The turkey burger with bacon strips on it that comes with sweet potato fries was pretty good. Not too dry and the bacon gives it juice and flavor. Good enough for a late-night dinner or snack if you share.The half-half burger is 50% burger and 50% bacon grounded into a patty. My friend liked the first couple of bites. It's probably shareable. It may be too much bacon for one person at one time. Can you ever have too much bacon really? Yes if you're trying to be on a diet.",1

That said, I really do not have any complaints about Tick Tock Diner's food or service. Often, I have to take a train out of Penn Station or a Bolt Bus from 11th avenue, and this place has been a great spot to get some grub before heading out of the city. Now, would I host a brunch get together here? Probably not. In terms of getting moderately priced food in a hurry (outside of a a hot dog truck), Tik Tock is pretty decent. Like most diners in this city, the menu is pretty extensive, and one can get breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner at any point of the day (or night). Since the diner is located near Penn Station, the service is pretty fast. All in all, do not come here with high expectations and you will not be disappointed.",1

Yes, this is the first diner that I actually have seen serve alcohol. Located next to/connected to the New Yorker Hotel.Retro décor with wall full of ""time"" themed phrases with watches or clocks the represent the word ""time"". One can't help but read the walls. Catch phrases like: In the nick of time... 3rd times a charm...there's a place and time for everything...It's about time...Ceiling colored lines reminds me of a rubix cube older style themed restaurants. Service was good.Quite a variety of food choices on the menu...Tried the half-half burger (1/2 bacon & 1/2 ground beef). First two bites were good as it was savory with beef and bacon. However, after that it was bacon overkill... I prefer my bacon as slices on top of the burger. Doesn't hurt to try something different. The crispy chicken and waffles my friend ordered...hold on...we thought was going to be chicken drumstick or something. It was 2 strips of chicken tenders on a waffle. However, it was good but you will ask, where's there rest of the chicken. Fries were a bit bland, but add salt or ketchup and you're fine.  chicken avocado club was good, but too much for one person alone. So we were full and forgot about dessert! Will have to come back and try next time along with some other items.",

Cue the barfing.Ew.I'm guessing the only way this place is still open is because people continuously are enticed by the thought of good, simple, satisfying to the soul diner food.

The TICK TOCK DINER is a unique, distinctive and quickly disappearing pop culture establishment in America called 24/7 operating diner style restaurant. 2.  The TICK TOCK DINER is conveniently located by the NY Penn Station. I do not like sitting in a tiny, dirty, and overly busy restaurants right across from the NY Penn Station. Instead, I personally prefer walking a block from the NY Penn Station, and siting down and enjoying my meal quietly in the very spacious and clean TICK TOCK DINER. 3. The TICK TOCK DINER is a spacious diner with several different sections with completely different interior designs. I like the nice and happy mood and feelings associated with these interior designs reflecting the good and old days of America.4. According to what I saw at people's dining tables there, the foods, served at the TICK TOCK DINER seemed nothing extraordinary, special or fancy at all. The quality and the types of foods served here seems very ordinary and conservative. I usually order the breakfast (about $10) at the TICK TOCK DINER, even it is 11PM at night. This is in fact the only one kind of foods, which I do not feel like wasting my money. I do not like any foods with cheese in it or the meat, which I can not tell the original animal from its shape and color. . I recommend the TICK TOCK DINER, who likes American foods with very reasonably-priced meals around the NY Penn Station area.

Nothing wrong with the service so I will keep it at 2 because of that, but this was the worst bagel and cream cheese I ever had in New York. Where did they get it from? A Costco freezer? in the city most associated with great bagels and the water you need to make them this should be punishable by Fine and a very steep one. The bagel was the same quality as the bacon and the coffee, about the same as a hospital cafeteria on a bad day. The prices are high due to its location, but this would still be poor quality at any reasonable price.I only ate here because I stayed at the hotel, it was pouring rain and I was hungry. It looks nice enough to get your hopes up a little, but the only reason this place is in business is because it is located on the hotel property. If it was down the block, it would not be in business. The New Yorker needs to get something better in place of this. Maybe the rest of their food makes up for this offering but I doubt it. You can walk to Best bagel from here. If you are staying in the hotel don't eat here unless it is raining cats and dogs outside, and be sure to lower your expectations. This is not a legit restaurant, this is a cafeteria pretending to be an upscale diner. It has some cool retro 80's touches and flair about it, but it can't make up for the food.

I was going to an event at MSG anyway and this is basically across the street, so why not. Most other food options around MSG are small, cramped, crappy, or have limited seating - here there was more than enough seats and it was comfortable.This place is connected to the Wyndham hotel and you can access  this diner from the Wyndham lobby. The bathrooms also belong to the hotel, so if you're (rightly) concerned about the disgusting bathrooms, then the hotel probably should get the blame. I'm not sure if this place is owned by the same who own the hotel or not. As far as the actual diner goes, the waiter was friendly and efficient. The waitress in the back and the cashier in the rear weren't that friendly. The glasses weren't exactly new and probably should be replaced. The food came out timely enough and there wasn't a terrible waiting time - but at the same time, we were there at a non-busy time. The food itself was ok. The chicken ""tenders"" were crap - didn't taste that great at all. The fries were average. The ""half & half"" burger I ordered was actually pretty tasty - basically the bacon is mixed in with the ground beef - since they had no exact bacon cheeseburger option. It had that ""chipotle mayo"" which gave it a more unique taste. The soda tasted more towards the flat side, but not all the way. It's pretty spacious inside - much larger inside than it appears to be from the outside. Overall not a bad option for the busy area - you could do a lot worse frankly. If you're looking to fill up before going to an event at MSG or in the area, it's a safe bet.",2

This is from a trusted friend:I was up pretty early last Sunday, prepping for the final day of our quarterly Inner Circle weekend.And rather than spend my prep time in my office, I decided to head to a diner for a working breakfast with myself around 7:30 AM.I googled ""diner near Penn Station that has good waffles,"" found the Tick Tock Diner, and set out to have my ""Lumberjack"" special and get some work done.As you can imagine, at 7:30 on a Sunday morning the diner was pretty much empty.  There were about fifteen open booths in eyesight when I entered.  I asked for my table of one, and the hostess walked me over to a small table for 2 in a tight corner.I was a bit disappointed with the table, as I wanted to set up my laptop without worrying about getting syrup on my touchpad.But, I got it.  I was only one person.Then I looked up, saw another five open tables and absolutely no line at the door, and I knew the max I would be there would be an hour.  There was no way I was going to take a table from some larger party.So, taking a cue from one of our Inner Circle speakers the day before who said, ""You don't get what you don't ask for,"" I walked back up to the hostess and said, ""May I have a booth please?""She didn't respond.  Then a waiter walked over and our exchange went like this . . .""What's the problem?""""I was wondering if I can get a booth.""""How many are you?""""One.""""Booths are reserved for more than two people.""""I understand, but I'll be gone in an hour at most, and I see there are plenty of booths available.""He got quiet.""Ok, ok, she'll show you a nice table.""""Thank you.  I really appreciate it.""The hostess, who still hadn't spoken to me, started to walk away, expecting me to follow . . . which I did.We walked around the bar, past another five open booths, and a few other open four tops . . . and then she showed me a sideways table for maybe three people, next to a pole, in a corner, jammed up against another occupied table of four.The staff was going out of their way . . . to make me uncomfortable.So, I said thank you . . . and left.I walked one block to the west, saw another diner called The Skylight Diner, walked in, and the conversation with the hostess went something like this . . .""Welcome to The Skylight.  How many are you?""""One.""""Great.  Sit wherever you'd like.""Swear to G.  I couldn't have written a better response if this blog was made up.I grabbed a booth.  I ate a Lumberjack.  And I had a wonderful experience.And I will go back.I understand what Tick Tock was trying to do . . . save their bigger tables for a ""potential customer.""  But in thinking about the person (or in this case 100 people) that might walk through the door, they forgot about the most important person . . . the person that was already inside their store.As Producers, Artistic Directors, or even Writers, the most important audience is the one we have.  The ones showing up.  Take care of them and they'll reward you with loyalty and ambassadorship.Don't take care of them and they'll go somewhere else.Oh, and in the 21st century, they might also write a blog about you, telling people if they are ever in the Penn Station area and looking for a terrific breakfast, go to The Skylight Diner instead.",1

Updated review",153,5,"Queens, NY",Anna H.,9976,3.0,765,"My colleagues and I were having ""Breakfast for Lunch"" but with the heavy downpour. I quickly suggested Tick Tock Diner which is diagonally across from our office because 9th Avenue would be tough to get to Skylight Diner. Holy moly as we entered through the street level doors...the line was enormous and apparently another line forming from the hotel lobby...oh just great! No one greeted us as we waited for our table. I kept repeating myself that I have 4 people in my group...of course they sit 1-2 people faster. Finally we got a booth after like 15 mins of waiting then we waited more for menus so we can order. Breakfast for Lunch: Gina - Hershey's Chocolate Chip Pancake with a side of Bacon and cup of hot coffeeMe - French Toast Grand Slam which comes with ham, bacon, sausage and an egg...better than paying for a side at $2.75...come hungry because it's a big portion...french toast definitely wins my heart Grace - Banana Upside Down Pancakes Grand Slam...the center of her pancakes were raw Amanda - Breakfast Burrito with Café Latte Our server Jose was funny and interacting with us that was a plus. One of the busboy in the blue t-shirt was acting mad weird...he picked up my colleague's umbrella and started tapping then placing on our table....then he mopped underneath our table and asked us to lift our feet...strange because we were still sitting there.",11

I love diner food so this hit the spot.I had banana pancakes and bacon. The food was delicious.

47,1,6/19/2018,204,,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",Diana S.,4,3.0,5,"Despite what most people are saying how this diner is a ""tourist trap"" and therefore ""overpriced"" -- These traits are simply part of that Midtown experience and part of Tick Tock's appeal.Located just a block away from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, and an avenue down from the Empire State Building, Tick Tock makes sense where it's at. The options are extensive, and like all diners with seemingly never-ending menus, not everything is going to be perfect. From what I ordered -- a huge Cobb salad and the stacked Steakhouse burger -- the portions are worth the price and the taste has been on-point. I suspect even if you order the Bloody Mary or a standby omelette, you won't be too disappointed. You'll probably be very much satisfied and full. Service-wise, I've seen the staff be pretty accommodating overall. Once, while not even dining in the dining room, I was even handed a glass of ice water while waiting. That's pretty accommodating for the hectic bustle of Midtown (Tick Tock is also attached to the New Yorker Hotel).Also worth mentioned is the lovable ""diner"" decor. Lots of stuffed booths and chrome finishings and colorful graphic posters. It's just a pleasurable time sitting in a place where there once was probably a jukebox playing and sodahops serving. I would recommend if you're looking for a no-nonsense bite in the heart of Midtown.",

The worlds best chicken and waffles was a slop fest of crappy school chicken and average waffles, far from what you would picture. The ""great balls of fire"" contained some of the worst Mac and cheese you will eat. There's something in there that just isn't right. And for goodness sake, stay away from the egg cream soda. If you are into drinking slightly less thick Hershey's chocolate syrup, then go ham. To keep the story short, stay away.",

This place has all its marketing tactics on point with the vintage neon outside and the snazzy menus but the results were sub par. I ordered the Turkey Burger (big heads up: they mix in Anise seed! So if you don't enjoy the subtle taste of Black Licorice....in your burger....this might be a hard pass for you). Now this Turkey Burger is supposed to be Cajun spiced with Candied Bacon, Pepperjack Cheese, Sriracha Mayo, and Peppers with Sweet Potato fries. What arrive (late....in fact the rest of the table got food and were basically finished when mine arrived) was a Black Licorice burger on a white bun with gouda cheese (not melted) and regular bacon and a dot of the ""signature"" mayo. Its was passable but nothing as described. On the service side, we were sat and immediately asked to ordered then repeated by at least 3 other waiters in a span of 3 mins. I ordered a Dr. Pepper (flat with like 2 small cubes of ice -- free refills however....ALL THE FLAT SODA YOU CAN DRINK!)When were ready to order a waitress arrived and started with ""I guess I take the order, he doesnt want to come over here."" She takes 3 of the 4 people's orders and starts to walk away. Haha we all order, eat and wait forever for the check. For a place that is so clearly turn and burn, they do a poor job on the end bit.

We walk another block to 8th ave and 34th st. We looked at our options and decided diner food may be the best way to go...Walked in the door, no one to greet us. My daughter even commented ""this looks like the back"". A man seated us right by the door that seemed to open quite often bringing in quite the breeze from outside. Later we found out that was our waiter, much later. After sitting for about 3 or 4 minutes I began to look around, a guy approached us and then looked at us puzzled. ""you didn't get a menu?"" he askedOk enough about the horrible service let's move on to the saving grace -- the food.I ordered 3 pancakes,  they were a good size. Filled me up. The syrup was really liquidy like it was lite syrup or watered down. Pancakes get a 3 out of 5. My daughter got a deluxe burger with fries. The menu said waffle fries we got steak fries. The burger itself looked unappealing and didn't have much juicy flavor, maybe they hide it under the cheese. 2 out of 5.If I didn't make it seem like I was ready to leave without paying, I may have still been sitting there waiting for service.",

I almost wanted to leave but didn't want to make a big deal. So our waiter (a different person) comes and very rudely says ""What are you guys having"" he never said hello or welcome or anything just straight up ""what are you guys having""... He appeared to be high on meth or something that had him aggressive just due to his demeanor and also because moments later our waiter gets aggressive with a customer and tells him ""What's your problem?!!"" Then tells him ""I'm going to call the cops!"" The man he got aggressive looked to be handicapped and instead of enquiring if he was ok since he spilled his water, he got nasty and aggressive.

I had the brioche french toast with scrabbled eggs and cheese and link sausage. The crust was hard to cut but the french toast was tasty. The sausages were very good and the eggs was prepared right.

However, I was told the veggie burger and mediterranean salad were good.  The seasoned fries werent seasoned and the regular fries are cut like steak fries. Nothing spectacular with the taste. So I seasoned it up with malt vinegar and hot sauce.  Now if you order the chicken and waffles I have to warn you of the type of chicken you receive.  Everyone, for the most part is used to getting a wing, drum,breast, or even a thigh with their waffle. That is not the case here. You will be given a chicken tender.  One large chicken tender on top. The server was asked if it could be switched for  a different piece that resembled a chicken part. He said he would have to asked and eventually removed the tender and brought back what look like chicken nuggets. The waffle was made well on the other hand. I do feel the prices are a bit expensive. I mean $6.95 for fries is on the high end. I guess because we were on 34th street. Well I dont think I will be returning",2

I ordered the Texan omelette w/ chicken sausage and he ordered cornbeef hash with over hard eggs and fries. The food itself was really enjoyable. However, the service left little to be desired. The guy who took our order, I believe his name was Chami, only did that. Walked past us plenty of times, but just staring. Now, we had coffee in the beginning and were feeling thirsty as there was no initial water on our tables. Not once did he ask if we needed anything, just standing about. Now when we talking near the ending of my food, he hands us the receipt and says, 'Pay at the front.' I clearly still have food on my plate. Never asked us for a refill. We were displeased to say the least. Told the front, they essentially brushed it off and told us to call customer service or something.",1

Conveniently located a block from Penn Station on the corner of 8th Avenue and West 34th Street, it's smack in the middle of just about everything. It's also open 24 hours a day which in NYC is great.

(might have been Citibank, if memory serves).Just how do they make their pancakes so uniform?!  Cloning?  It's gotta be a giant robot in the kitchen cranking out each flapjack because every one is identical to the others in diameter, thickness and doneness.  Consistency is one thing, but this is downright Brave New World or 1984.  On the plus side, they offer grits as an option for breakfast sides as well as the standard home fries.  A little on the pricey side for diner food, but remember where you are and having the convenience in the hotel lobby or across the street from the theater for a quick bite after a late movie.  Or maybe after riding in on Amtrak and you crawled out of the depths of Penn Station, you're feeling a little peckish, then the Tick Tock is made to order.",10

Fortunately for the diner its proximity to a move theater saves it from bankruptcy. I thought i would be safe with a toasted vegetable salad. There were only a few roasted vegetables from yesterday in the salad, the eggplant was not cooked thoroughly and still had a delightful crunch that most grazing animals would enjoy, the arugula was wilted and curled and dead. Its saving grace was the unnecessary amounts of sun dried tomatoes covering its shame. Though i will have to say that the fresh mozzarella was edible, likely because it came from somewhere else.

The problem: the service is literally the worst I have ever had in the United States.

What I can say and what most can agree, there is just something so cool about being able to have a burger and disco fries with a chocolate malt anytime you want too or pancakes and eggs because you all of a sudden want a breakfast for dinner and when I say anytime I mean 24 hours a day. The few times I have eaten here have been pretty darn good, service attentive and quick by diner standards and friendly- I like friendly. I do not like mushy fries they need to be well done and to hold up the ketchup that is a food group or the extra gravy and cheese that make disco fries so habit forming. As a creature of habit with certain foods like fries, they do not disappoint here. Not one for salads at diners, though I have gone in with all the typical healthy intentions and probably should follow through because I've seen customers order them here and they look delicious, but I go for the burgers, sandwiches or anything but a salad... I know, don't judge.I look at diners as #1 headquarters for comfort food and that's why I really enjoy them, the only downside as with any diner that you sit down to eat in, you just don't know the struggle until you have had to choose what you want to order...  the menu has so much to choose from- it can be hard to make a decision,  don't be like me, try something new.I'd say ---save room for dessert but I have yet to eat at a diner and have room unless I am sharing the main entrée or go just for the dessert, which again...  so hard tooochoose...

I ended up here with a group despite the poor Yelp reviews.  The reviewers who gave this place low ratings have it right.  The high ratings must be from an alternate universe. One of my worst dining experiences in a long time. Food, service and ambience were all really bad.  I had the minute steak with a cup of chicken/macaroni soup.  The soup was tasteless and macaroni overcooked. I could not identify the cut of meat which comprised my steak but it was incredibly tough. My steak was served with broccoli and fries. I was not offered any choices. Our server was one of the worst I have had.  I usually get reasonablgood service in NYC but this was awful.

I would recommend for a try if you're in the area and you're up for some place you never tried before. The food was good!! I enjoyed their burgers but overall there are so many burger chains out there so it's hard to compete with them. I usually prefer breakfast food at any diner so maybe those are better choices for you when you stop by here. The service was lacking.. They only come by when you're order off the menu, when they bring the food, and then when you ask for the check. Also the bathroom is pretty far to get to... Like I said, I recommend for a try if you want some place you never tried before but don't expect a surprise.",
138,,7/14/2017,2,,"Bronx, NY",Luci D.,32,1.0,27,"Tick tock...the name fits perfectly to the exact thoughts I had when getting my chicken and waffles. I was staying in the herald square area for the weekend and missed breakfast at my hotel. My boyfriend and I began searching for delivery options but gave in to going out and giving the the rainy morning a shot. Tick Tock dinner came up in our google search, though it didn't have 5 stars reviews we figured it's a dinner ""they can't fuck up pancakes and waffle"". We arrive to the place and it was clean and neat. Our server arrives to our table and apologizes for the wait and  wishes to take our order. He seemed rushed when the place was not full...I asked him questions on how the chicken and waffles plate is. He then sarcastically rushes me and said ""its chicken and waffles"". I replied by saying, I know what chicken is. The question I'm trying to ask is what's the preparation of the chicken, is it fried chicken. He then said yes, it's battered Fried chicken. I proceeded with my order and was looking forward to eating a fried chicken and waffles for the first time. Further more we ordered mozzarella sticks, a chorizo omelette and mashed potatoes. The mozzarella sticks arrives and it was square shaped, it still had a frozen look to them. Thankfully it was cooked but not mealty. Some of the cheese in the middle was still stiff. My BF gets his food & looks good...here comes the good part. I get my food 5min after his (no clue why) and on my plate I have a burnt waffle with 2 strips of chicken fingers (I wish I had taken a picture of that). I WAS LIVID!!!!!! Not only was my food delayed, but I got chicken fingers and burnt waffles. I tell the waiter immediately and he says it's chicken and waffles. I replied and reminded him that he specifically said it was battered fried chicken not chicken fingers from a frozen bag. He now changed his story and still not apologizing, said ""I don't know. I don't work in the kitchen and the kitchen serves whatever they have. Sometimes is not fried chicken sometimes it is this"". I told him to please remove my plate and get my order corrected. My Bf was now eating alone and felt terrible and begged to share his food with me. But even after all the food nonsense I was hoping my order would be corrected. After another 10min wait, I got back the same burnt waffle. It was very obvious they did not make a fresh one, with one burnt chicken finger. This is not a joke. I told the waiter to take my food away. I wanted to get up and leave right at that instant. It was now 12pm almost 1 and I was at a diner on 34th street having problems with a breakfast order and a waiter who was not helping and knew nothing about the menu. I gave in to eating my bf toast and some of his eggs. The waiter brought over the bill and then said I'm sorry. After all this time, I'm sorry did not cut it. I have worked in food and beverage as a manger and I would personally fire the waiter or suspend him. This was not okay. He spoke more than enough and did not represented the establishment properly. The customer service was terrible, so horrible that I didn't eat.Going forward I do not recommend Tick Tock diner to anyone. Right across from them there is a Dunkin' Donuts and you will probably have a better chance there.",1

The diner itself is big and clean with plenty of seating options but the decor has a bit of a 90s, garish-colorful vibe. I ordered a Western omelette without cheese and an iced coffee. The menu looked big and the prices were reasonable for the area but the quality of the food definitely shows that the diner caters more to tourists than locals. The peppers in my omelette were unevenly cut and thus, both partially raw and partially stewed. The home fries were cold, mushy and had a bitter heavy aftertaste of old oil. The coffee was very watery - the way iced coffee tastes when you pour steaming hot coffee into a cup of ice. However, the waiter was efficient and kind enough to give me a refill to-go and I made sure to tip on the full menu price of my meal.My biggest complaint is probably with the patrons at this restaurant and management's reaction to it. Quite a few of the people around me were very rude to the servers and acted very entitled to everything. One woman insisted on hogging a whole booth that may seat 4-6 just to herself while there were large groups waiting - just because she wanted to sit by the window. The server for the section politely tried to offer another seat - even window facing, but the woman was belligerent and his manager came over and undermined him. Although I am aware of the importance of hospitality, seeing employees mistreated always makes me lose my appetite.

182,,1/8/2017,143,1,"East Northport, NY",Nicole P.,4,1.0,18,"Stayed the night at the New Yorker hotel, everything was great. Decided to catch breakfast at the Tick Tock diner. We were immediately seated, with a dirty plate. About 5 minutes later a bus boy came to deliver us forks and knives, we asked for the plate to be removed he said ""I don't do that"" and left. Frustrated, we still stayed. No waitress/waiter came by for 30 minutes, no one asked us for drinks, water, anything. We sat at a table with a dirty plate. We decide to leave after waiting and who I assume is the manager offered to give us a new table. I'm sorry but what will a new table do? We simply needed some beverages and our order to be taken. Sadly, this will be our last visit to the Tick Tock diner. Unfortunately we can't even rate the food because we didn't even get the opportunity to order.",3

We came in, ushered to are seats and basically rushed to place our order. Our waitress was very rude but hey at least she smiled through the rudeness! If you want a quick meal sure go ahead hit the tick tock diner up, food was mediocre and prices were alright.. But service isn't the best.",2

186,,4/3/2017,46,,"Queens, NY",Ilona N.,44,2.0,66,"I haven't been here in a very, very long time but my husband and I decided to stop by after seeing Deadmau5 play on April 1st.We weren't planning on getting a huge meal or anything spectacular, as neither of us was really hungry. We just wanted a place to sit for awhile and talk about the concert. This is a HUGE diner with tons of seating.The bathroom is downstairs, and the ladies bathroom had the most scalding water on two of the three sinks. Hot enough to brew tea or melt steel beams, your guess is as good as mine. The other people that were in the bathroom with me bonded over that we had to share one sink to wash our hands. We should have went somewhere else. It seems they were over their heads and insanely busy. The menu is okay enough, but nothing spectacular and the prices are higher than most diner's I frequent.Our server was very abrupt with us, which I guess I can slightly forgive for them being so busy.I wanted a sundae, but he told me they were ""out,"" yet they were able to make milkshakes. Weird. We both got an Oreo milkshake and I ordered a  bagel with cream cheese. The milkshakes came out after about 5 minutes, and it took about 20 minutes just to get a bagel.The oreo milkshake had a very weird taste to it. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it didn't taste anything like an oreo, or even chocolate or vanilla for that manner. The server never came by to see how we were doing, or if we needed anything else.I also had the worst stomach ache of my life after getting home. I am a very sad panda. Perks: Tons of spaceSubway was located right outside so that I could curl up in the fetal position and regret my choice of milkshakeCons: Service is really lacking - slow, abruptMenu is a bit pricier than other dinersScalding water in bathroom",

190,,2/2/2017,399,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Johanna B.,1233,4.0,484,"I had eaten at Tick Tock Diner a handful of times years ago. Honestly, I couldn't even tell you what I had. Yesterday, my friend and I decided to have an early dinner there. By early, I mean 5 PM. Situated in the middle of busy Herald Square, I arrived a bit earlier than my friend and was seated promptly. The place is massive, clean and has a nice retro look to it.As with all diners, I combed through the many pages of the menu to find something satisfying. Although I find some diners to be charming, I rarely frequent them. My friend and I were both in the mood for a salad. I chose the Mediterranean with grilled chicken and she selected the Salmon (with a side of an English muffin). I drank water but also asked for some lemon on the side. Our waiter was extremely attentive and brought over an entire dish of lemon wedges. I am sure there were two lemons in that dish). My salad had a lot going for it: grilled chicken cooked perfectly without being dry or over done, grilled veggies such as eggplant and zucchini, sun dried tomatoes, avocado spears and chunks of delicate fresh mozzarella. All served with a side (thank you for putting it on the side!) of balsamic vinaigrette  dressing. This was a serious salad and one of the most delicious I have eaten maybe anywhere! And without the upscale prices. I've no idea why this diner received such a low overall rating. Perhaps my friend and I were lucky and chose the perfect time to have dinner but we were pleased with the  en pointe service (water glass never remained empty too long) and the food. A day later and I'm still impressed with the salad I had eaten at Tick Tock Diner.",
191,,2/7/2017,26,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Lulu H.,11,4.0,146,"Solid diner with lots of seating in a super busy area. The food is good -- not stellar, but good. However, the dining area of this restaurant is very clean, so I come here a lot when I have to kill time around this part of town. It's a good place to get a cheap-ish meal, some hot coffee, and quick service.",
192,,1/18/2018,1,,"Ogden, UT",Shawn N.,28,2.0,29,"So in all fairness I did read the reviews prior to dining here, however since late night options in the 34th and 8th area are limited I did give it a try...regretfully.  The theme is a wanna-be old school dinner and seemed to be crowded most of the time as we were passing by.   I can only imagine it was from travelers on their first visit without knowing better.  Ordered the chicken club sandwich with avocado.   In my opinion it's hard to get a club sandwich wrong in most cases but the chicken was so dry I was finding myself deconstructing the sandwich in search of moist bits.  I actually had to order a side of ranch for a moisture source.   2 people 2 drinks and 2 sandwiches (we both ordered the same thing) came to $35.  It also seemed weird that our waitress asked that we not leave her tip on our card as she normally didn't receive her tips.  If you are looking for crap late night food, hit up the crap pizza place across the street or Mcdonalds.  You'll end up saving $25 bucks.  Definitely one to miss.",1
193,,4/18/2016,3,,"Waltham, MA",Vicky Z.,94,4.0,100,"After a 4 hour Amtrak ride from Boston, we were hungry. This diner was conveniently located a couple of minutes from Penn Station. From the reviews I had read, I wasn't expecting much from this place. I actually really enjoyed it and wished our hotel was closer to it so I could have gone there again for breakfast. I had the eggs Benedict, which were really good! I devoured both eggs. They came with potatoes, which were completely flavorless. If I had not read on the menu what was being served on the side, I would not even have known they were potatoes.The service was a little slow, but it was pretty busy when we got there. Everyone there was really nice. Overall very lovely atmosphere. Not sure what all the negative reviews are about.",

I didnt eat all day and  was super hungry and just wanted something quick and close by...so I went for it and I regret it. I got the Monte Cristo and Banana Pudding pancakes (which was delicious) and my friend got the Protein Breakfast... everything besides pancakes tasted okay, nothing special, so when you're starving it doesn't really matter. Half hour after eating there me and my friends' stomach was killing us, we got really bad stomach aches and about and hour later we both ended up in the bathroom. JUST STAY AWAY.",1
196,,9/28/2017,0,,"New City, NY",C B.,0,3.0,49,"Tick Tock has a few things going for it.  The place is clean with a nice enough diner atmosphere, no complaints there.  It's got a pretty unique menu, at least by my experience.  There are two menus, though, so you should ask to see both if you're not familiar with them.  I don't know why there are two, but there are.  There's overlap between them, but some significant differences, too.  The food is typically good.It is due to the service that I did not give it 4 or 5 stars.  The service varies significantly.  Ironically, I think the times I got most irritated were those when the manager seated me and took my order.  The food came out promptly enough, but there were never any followups to see if everything was okay or if I needed anything, and I had to flag someone down for the check.  Perhaps this was because my table/check didn't ""belong"" to any of the regular server staff.  Twice now, when the check did arrive, someone had scribbled out the 15% and circled the 20% suggested gratuity.  I always tip 20% on the total and I still found this offensive.  At the register, he actually had the audacity to point out the 20% and pretty much inquire whether I wanted to leave it there at the counter or at the table.  This was way out of line as far as I'm concerned.  I believe a customer owes a server a gratuity unless it was a truly poor experience that the server could have prevented.  However, the amount is up to the customer, and you shouldn't be ""requiring"" 20% when you did the bare minimum.  I think this guy needs a refresher in his management and customer service training.",

The food here is decent and they are located right on 34th and 8th which is conveinient..... Pros1. They are reasonably priced2. The food here is pretty good3. They have a pretty decent sized menu4. They will charge your phone as I discovered on 11/14...Cons1. The service leaves a bit to be desired... I was with a party of 6 on my last visit and they took quite awhile to take our orders. Also, the waiter did not even check on the table once! 2. They add an automatic gratuity, I dont care for that policy in any establishment, especially when the service is sub-par3. For some reason at night, they put many of the chairs on top of tables and have the tables in a very sloppy manner. Appearance means alot and it does not seem they care in the wee hours of the night.Overall, good food, but the service needs a major overhaul.",2
198,13,9/27/2015,452,15,"New York, NY",Mardory V.,1951,3.0,484,"Well, the customer service here sucks. Our waiter disappeared throughout the time we were there and extended our stay by 30-45 minutes. Granted, we were not in a rush but it would have been nice to not have to get up and go to the counter person to pay our bill or flag anyone passing by for assistance.The full three stars go directly to the wonderfully crisp and non greasy grilled cheese with tomato and ham and that ice cold vanilla milkshake (which possibly saved my life late night).  If you don't know what else to have, get this. The side of fries will fill you up if nothing else will.Bathrooms are downstairs past the connecting hotel entrance. To reach the restrooms, one descends a staircase which allows a glimpse at their private party room. This is possibly the best feature of the diner aside from the food. They are open 24hrs and are a pretty solid choice if needing a typical diner experience-- minus the service-- before heading home. Definitely beats any other late night food option in the area.",19

Then a group came in and we were completely forgotten. Was never asked for a refill, and never took our dirty dishes off the table. I sat there for 35 minutes trying to pay. Couldn't get our waiters attention, so I asked another if we could get our check and he said yep and walked off...never came back. Then when our waiter brought food for our neighbor booth I said excuse me, he looked at me and walked off, so I walked out.",
