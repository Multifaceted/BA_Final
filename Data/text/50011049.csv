0,Jonathan S.,"Queens Village, NY",109,60,151,4.0,8/14/2018,Always Wanted To Come Here For Some Seafood.It Was Worth The Wait. The Food Very Flavorful. Tons Tasty Options. The Customer Line Was Out The Door. This Was Just A Monday Lol.  I Can Image What Fridays Look Like. Definitely Stopped On The Side Of The Road & Body My Whole Plate Of Food. Would Definitely Patronize This Restaurant.Good Job.,,,
1,Ant S.,"New York, NY",1,9,5,4.0,8/8/2018,"Food is DELISH!!!!! You can either have your order steam or fried. It's made to order (can take up half your lunch hour!) but once it's prepared it's SUPER fresh and HOT! I have yet to be disappointed! HOWEVER....Do not even bother try calling your order in for pick up, the woman designated to take orders answers the phone when she feels like it. Once you're in the spot, the girl taking the orders is EXTREMELY SLOW! Once you're at the counter, she'll walk away, to do other things outside of her duties, without taking your order meanwhile there can be a line out the door (another reason why your entire lunch hour might be spent waiting on your food) At the point that she DECIDES to take your order, she's rude! And don't you dare get up there and still be indecisive about what you want (as you might be; because almost everything on the menu looks GREAT), she'll give you the ""I'm waiting"" look. SMH!Otherwise the food is Good! And the male cooks are nice!",1,,
2,Diana P.,"Brooklyn, NY",202,22,7,4.0,7/21/2018,"First time here and it was Divine!!!! I always hear the commercials and  figured I'd stop by while in the area. So there's 2 sections of the restaurant. One is a prefix menu and the other portion, you select what you want, pay by the pound and tell them how you would like it cooked. I ordered a salmon filet, corn, red potatoes, onions, shrimp, and broccoli for approximately $25-30. I read the reviews of the butter garlic so i asked the staff to only had on 1 big spoon of garlic butter and i added a bit more seasoning. I gave it 4 stars because i did find a strand of hair. This is strictly a take out spot.",,,
3,Chanelle H.,"Hamden, CT",14,49,58,5.0,10/3/2018,"Everything is so so so good here and so fresh. I usually get the crab legs, which are great classic crab legs. The lobster fries are also amazing, but I'd recommend getting them earlier In the day when the lobster sauce is freshly made. They kind of just have the lobster sauce on simmer over a fire all day. The shrimp is solidly good. The sauces they have are amazing. Overall 9/10 food experience. If you live in Harlem and like seafood this is it!",,,
4,Courtney C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",481,39,180,4.0,6/5/2018,"Perfect place for all of your seafood cravings. They have a wide range of menu items and none of them have failed me yet. From the seafood to the chicken wings, everything is spot on every time. I can't wait to try the 24K wings. (If you try them before I do, let me know how they are). The sautéed shrimp over rice with garlic butter is my favorite dish. Everything has FLAVOR which can be lacking from some steamed seafood places. The portions are ample enough to save some for lunch the day day and that's always a win! The wait can be a little long at times because they're so popular, but it's definitely worth it.  Last, but definitely not least, they are CLEAN which is super important when dealing with raw seafood.",,,
5,Christine C.,"West Bronx, NY",9,114,134,3.0,3/30/2018,"Listen, Okay. DISCLAIMER: I'm a struggling vegetarian. As I jokingly put it I'm a chicketarian (like pescatarian but instead of fish. I'll only eat chicken, no red meat, fish, goat, etc. just chicken.) I give this disclaimer because I've been doing good at being healthy and it's been a LONG while since I had a ""heavy"" meal. Now, I had this meal y'all. Me and my aunts friend went to this place after finding it on Yelp. It was open until midnight, the reviews were good , there was a 10% discount coupon, so we thought whyyyy not? Off rip the place is kind of small but they had a lot to offer and it got the job done*. What most don't know is that you DONT NECESSARILY have to purchase the meal options on the board. You can certainly go into that glass room and pick out your seafood and other veggie assortments. The room isn't just there for the crew but everyone.My A.F (aunts friend) had a tiny fit when she realized she could get the veggies she wanted after all. The problem with the store being small is that it gets packed easy. And with everyone wanting to wait inside, because they walked and not drive or (I'll touch on this later) they didn't want to miss there number being called so....you know how that goes. We was gon' wait! The system they have in the 'kitchen' is flawed as, tickets can easily slip from where there sticking it, and I've personally witness someone say that they've been waiting for a while for their food and neither the person or the kitchen had the ticket but the food was ready.   To also add, it does take a while for the food to be ready.*takes breathe* As for the food itself:I ordered the garlic butter wings with fries and Mac and cheese (*hides face*) And boy were the wings good. It was crispy and delicious but I shouldn't have gotten them with garlic butter because baby that BUTTER WAS REAL BUTTER or something, it had me immediately feeling like an asthmatic, unhealthy, clogged [which I believe happened as fast as it did because I hadn't eaten that ""heavy"" in a long while]. But the crispyness of the wings beautiful. If you want wings get them naked or try another sauce. The Mac and cheese was alright: thick, very cheese. And the fries were fries. My A.F. Ordered broccoli, carrots, potatoes steamed all together and Flavored in garlic butter (y'all the butter again), with another order of herb salmon, collard greens and yams. We're a sharing family so we all tasted the plate and can I say I did not enjoy 1) the BUTTER (but the veggies were good), 2) how salty the greens were (but the texture was good, and 3) T H E.  B U T T E R. [its too much and it instantly made me and everyone fall asleep after eating]Lastly, the passion fruit and mango juices are good but they need to be diluted a little because it tasted like straight concentrate and sugar. Overall, I think the Lighthouse was a good stop to make, but with the wait and the food choices I made. I'll come back at a later time. For some dry wings or steamed veggies (because growth) lol.Be blessed y'all",1,2,1
6,Alana P.,"Bloomfield, NJ",17,129,374,5.0,5/12/2018,"Small spot. Not the type to order in. Order to go. It has a very southern and Harlem touch and atmosphere. It's a small place, so again, you want to order and then go. I doubt that you can call in an order to pick up. It's quite a very popular spot amongst celebrities and the likes. Parking is a pain. I think I circled around like 4 times or more before I found a place to park. If you're rolling with a friend or two, it's best to drop off the person and have them order, while you place the order, etc. All meals are cooked right in front of you.",,,
7,RandBlues L.,"New York, NY",88,43,0,4.0,11/4/2018,"Visited a few weeks ago and I feel obligated to take one star off because of the wait and customer service. I chose to walk in and place my order. The restaurant was very crowded as space is limited so I was already thinking oh boy this may take a while. The lady taking orders was preoccupied by whatever was going on with her coworkers and myself and the gentleman in front of me stood there waiting to place our orders for at least 5 minutes before she even acknowledged us. It took 10 minutes for me to place my order although there was no line, and I waited another 15 minutes to get my food. I was annoyed by the near half hr wait until I got my food. Love at first bite. I had the fried fish and shrimp with seasoned fries and macaroni & cheese. Every bite was amazing. I can't explain it. I guess it really is worth the wait.",,,
8,Jamila C.,"Somerville, NJ",186,249,1148,4.0,8/29/2018,"It's hard to justify giving them any less than four stars even though our order took about an hour to push out. And that's with my number being skipped AND the argument between two coworkers behind the counter which caused one of the workers to walk away from packing my food and another taking over. By then, I just wanted to leave..but with my food. I ordered the catfish strips, mac and cheese, and yams. Everything was good, especially the catfish. I looked over at the fish market while waiting for my order to cook and felt reassured that my fish was fresh. And if you come here, also order the mango drink (my gawd).",7,2,4
9,Brandon H.,"Lithonia, GA",5,53,13,5.0,10/13/2018,The food here is amazing!! I ordered the salmon and shrimp covered with rice with a side of Mac & cheese! It was heaven in my stomach!! It was soooooo good! When I come back to New York to visit I'm going to come here again to eat! It was worth the wait.,,,
10,Alex W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,38,151,5.0,8/30/2018,"By far the best seafood restaurant uptown! The food is so good, and you have endless choices of how you can have your food prepared. My favorite is sautéed curried salmon, with sautéed rice and vegetables. The food is filling. The prices vary so depending on what you order, it can be inexpensive or expensive. But, regardless of what you order you will be very satisfied. Also, the wait time can be a little long but it's worth it. It's very crowded afternoons and evenings from Thursday to Sunday",1,,
11,Shola A.,"Oakland, CA",212,51,150,4.0,4/25/2018,"Food here is always great but the wait is always long! As of recently they no longer take orders over the phone if they are too busy. Once you order your meal be prepared to wait around 20-30 mins. All the food is prepared on the spot which is nice. The food is always flavorful and amazing. Finally got around to trying the lobster fries which were great, but it's definitely a side to share. Another one of my favorite dishes are he sauté salmon with jerk sauce over rice. I get it every time and I'm always happy makes me forget about the long waiting time",1,,1
12,Michael C.,"Malibu, CA",7,16,12,5.0,8/18/2018,This is my fav spot #ShagatRated for the best cooked and seasoned food in town. I drove from Queens to the Bronx to Haarlem to get this.. worth it.,,,
13,Godiva B.,"Spring Valley, NY",1,12,6,2.0,8/25/2018,"Surprisely, I was very disappointed with the food and the service. The staff was not friendly at all and it took them forever to acknowledge me.

16,Lindsay B.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",102,2,0,1.0,7/12/2018,I have tried to like this place plenty of times. Their food is tasty but the customer service is so poor I can not support this business. The employees fail to properly serve customers. They will give you an attitude for ordering food. I received no utensils with my order when I went back and asked the lady rolled her eyes. Very very very poor service.,2,,
17,Mary L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,29,9,5.0,3/22/2018,This is my favorite soul food spots. Truly a hidden gem. I tell all my friends about this place. It's a takeout restaurant but the food is beyond amazing. You gotta ty it for yourself. The honey BBQ wings are always on point & the candied yams is to die for .,1,,1
18,Felisha M.,"New York, NY",21,38,39,5.0,4/19/2018,"Nice establishment, if you want to eat in, seating is limited. Its a Fish Market so you can pick out your seafood fresh off the ice as well as order from their menu. I enjoyed the food here,  had Crab Alfredo, Salmon, Macaroni Salmon, Yams and Greens.... sooo yummy. I had to wait a while for my order as they were making everything fresh, but it was well worth the wait!!",,,
19,Ju M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,3,5,5.0,5/6/2018,Amazing food. Mac and cheese was great. Fried fish was great. Candies yams was great. And the lobster fries were banging!!! The wait was a bit long but I'd say it was worth it. Will be back next week!!!,,,
20,Sarah S.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",40,13,35,4.0,1/21/2018,"Really good seafood (not going to say it's the best in the city but it holds its own). The wait is usually long but the food is made to order so that's to be expected. I had the Loaded Lobster Fries, which comes with fried shrimp, and was shocked at how much food you get (seriously the box weighed like 7 lbs). Needless to say it's definitely something you want to share. My only issue with it was that I wished the fries were crispier.",2,,1
21,Gregory M.,"Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, NY",0,5,5,4.0,7/25/2017,"The light house is a small seafood spot in Harlem. This a fairly new business, about a year old. Not only is it a restaurant but they also a seafood market where you can purchase all kinds of shrimp,fish, lobster and crab.The food here is very good. I got the fish and shrimp dinner. For $18 you get a very generous portion of fish, about 5-6 medium size shrimp and two sides. The fish and shrimp were seasoned perfectly. They Had a Cajun flavor to them but not too salty. For my sides I chose the seasoned fries and the collard greens. The fries seem to be hand cut and are nothing like the freezer fries you get at most fish spots. The collard greens were decent but not great. They were cooked perfectly and were flavorful but they were more vinegary than I prefer. While here I noticed they offer seafood linguini and also steamed and broiled seafood. All of these items looked excellent! I wanted to try it all. I can tell they have some high level cooks in there that really know how to chef up some seafood. Tip: don't bother coming here to dine in. Grab your food and get the hell out of the way. This place is crowded!Light House earns 4 stars from me. The food I tasted was delicious and the serving was more than filling. They can certainly improve in the ordering process and how they manage the line. It was like a free for all with people trying to get the attention of the person taking the order. I judge then too much about that because the place was very crowded and they did get the food out fast. I will certainly be back to try the linguini amount other menu items and could see myself comeback often for a quick seafood fix.",1,1,
22,Chantel W.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,5,1,5.0,8/6/2018,"What I love the most about this location is that majority of the workers are African American. The food is great the customer service seemed okay. My only complains are the flies, I understand the raw seafood area but something needs to been done about the flies for sanitary and health purposes",,,
23,Latoya P.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,2,0,5.0,7/30/2018,"This place is off the chain, well the seafood is. Omg, the lobster fries is to die for. The portion is larger than I can manage. Love everything. I only wish I could dine in but maybe it's for the best cause food like this should be eaten at home where you can get down and messy..",,,
24,Brian D W.,"Bronx, NY",13,12,9,5.0,7/5/2018,The best seafood in the Tri-state area!!! I don't say this a lot but everything on the menu is good you cannot go wrong with this place.,,,
25,Semaj A.,"Bronx, NY",8,9,166,2.0,1/30/2018,"Let's just say I had high expectations of lighthouse because I've ate here before more than what I've posted on Yelp and I'm very disappointed.. for starters it was very greasy I literally titled my container to the side and the amount of grease actually made me feel nasty, second off the Alfredo clearly has the taste of jar Alfredo wasn't from scratch, third it was wayyyy too much Alfredo sauce other than the cons the pros were the salmon and shrimp were both cooked to perfection! Lastly for 25$ the least they do can is give you a slice of garlic bread! Lighthouse this wasn't your best dish! Hopefully this was just a off day for y'all!",,,
26,S S.,"Randolph, MA",0,4,5,5.0,9/14/2018,"First time here and everything is freshly prepared! The only downfall is that it takes forever but they're legit cooking it on the spot.

I was very disappointed, I know they could do better. It was like they gave me the corner burnt piece of the pan.",,,
29,Consuela E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",74,2,0,5.0,7/15/2018,First off the food is delicious it's like so worth the extra your have to pay for it being a little more on the expensive side of fish market fare. However the cashier here is so freaking rude if your seem confused will just stare at your before rolling those big ugly eyes takes your money without saying thank you. I ordered two fresh juice drinks for which I was told the cops would be brought our I'm waiting on line and just happened to notice the cops had been sitting on the counter this lady is a real bitch thank God she isn't cooking.,,,
30,Patricia L.,"Cooksville, Mississauga, Canada",0,2,7,5.0,6/21/2018,"This is the best seafood restaurant in Harlem !! Everything is cooked on the spot and seasoned to perfection.

33,Camille P.,"Elmont, NY",72,40,43,5.0,3/4/2017,"Heard a lot of good things about this place and decided to drive from Long Island to Harlem to see what the hype was all about. Let's say, it was worth the drive out there! I heard that the lobster fries with wings were very good and decided to order that. Yes, it does get pretty crowded and you will wait a good 15-20 mins to get your food, but it was worth the wait. Too delicious! Will come back again . So happy to find a place that serves delicious seafood. Don't have to travel to only City Island for deliciousness",4,,
34,Renee S.,"Queens, Queens, NY",6,50,29,2.0,10/8/2017,"What can I say about lighthouse? I've been coming here for over a year, and while the food is outstanding, the organization and the way they do business is just disturbing. I really want to give them 5 stars, but their operations are just so terrible. Probably almost every other time that I come here, my order is mixed up with someone else's. Once I got all the way home to learn that the $60 steamed seafood meal that I paid for was switched with someone's fried fish meal. Now, to be fair, every time that my order is wrong, the staff is extremely apologetic and tries to accommodate me best possible. Usually tossing me a free desert or something. But the wait here is very long and to spend even more time waiting for my Correct meal to be prepared again is just painful. The place is too crowded and tight to be waiting for extended periods of time like that. Not to mention, it's hot and sweaty inside because it's so crowdedLighthouse is super popular and the wait can be pretty long. If coming during a peak hour, Definitely come with at least an hour of time to spare. Maybe need more time if your order is mixed up. I had stoped coming for a while because I was fed up with my order always be wrong or taking way too long. Regardless of the frustrations of dealing with my orders being mixed up more often than not,I'll  still patronize again because the food is just that good. The staff is pretty nice--I just hope lighthouse can get organized and stop screwing up orders one day lol",1,,2
35,Shakeria G.,"New York, NY",28,85,80,2.0,4/10/2017,"I wanted to love this place, but!. First off it wasn't to crowded for a Saturday night but I was definitely prepared. We ordered our food I got the seafood platter babe got a fish dinner. My seafood platter was ready I'm about 20 minutes fish dinner took another 25 minutes..The food wasn't sitting anywhere where it could have stayed warm just sitting out so my seafood was on the warm side not hot by the time I got home.. Anyway after cleaning up the mess from the poorly wrapped food in car I finally get home to enjoy my food and first bite into my lobster tail I was turned off.. It was so salty.. Way to salty to enjoy.. Which was very dissappointing to say the very least.  I really wanted to like to like this place but I cannot sacrifice my health earing here again.",1,1,

I was trying my best to be kind... and I was. I had to remind them about my food in the steamer. Then they were like, oh, sorry. OMG! I wanted to break things. Both times we got steamed muscles / crab legs / brussel sprouts /broccoli. They were seasoned with Old Bay, butter and garlic. SO SO SO SO SO good and meaty. We were going to another place to get muscles and they were so tiny. I am not sure why it took us so long to come here. Again, the wait is a nightmare and so is the ordering line at night but it is definitely worth the wait. Good people watching.Prices are reasonable. Service is slow. Business is clean and well maintained.",1,,

I Literally waited here for 55 minutes to get crab linguini Alfredo, sautéed shrimp & steamed crab legs!! For a fish spot that's also take out this is absurd. It gets worse... After waiting for over 35 minutes for my order the lady calls my number and I thought that finally my food was ready and she proceeds to tell me that they do not have any linguini!!! No linguini???? Sooo you didn't make my food after 40 minutes or realize that upon ordering that you had absolutely no pasta left!!

I travel all the way from the Bronx to Harlem to get the delicious fried catfish and shrimp that I'm craving.  The sides are pretty good, but I don't really care for all of the salt and there are sometimes splintered bones in the collard greens.  The line is always crazy when I go (late night), but the old school soul music blaring from the speakers makes the wait go by faster.  I also like that people can pick out their own fish and produce, though I haven't taken advantage of that option yet.  Parking is crazy, lots of double parked cars, but it's worth it.",,,

51,Quin S.,"Manhattan, NY",114,99,388,4.0,7/19/2015,"I found Lighthouse on Yelp and was glad it was so nearby. I was hungry. Seems like a fairly new business, still getting their flow in order. The staff was friendly and the top chef has an outgoing personality as he is confident you will love his food! Made the visit fun. I had the Fish/Shrimp combo with Mac & Cheese and Greens then a slice of Red Velvet Cake.  I enjoyed it all. concerns: my fish could've been fried a lil harder (guess I can simply request that next time) and the Mac recipe may need a revamping (more cheese & flavor) Will I return?

53,Tomar B.,"Jersey City, NJ",2,25,0,1.0,10/14/2017,Our second time and thoroughly disappointed. The food was overpriced and OVERRATED.  The fried Whiting tasted like either the oil or fish was old and the Mac and Cheese WASN'T cheesy at all. DONT WASTE YOUR $$$.,2,,
54,Christopher W.,"Englewood, NJ",5,13,16,4.0,7/8/2017,"Good food, Instagram ad a little misleading, thought they had a sit down area.  Had the seafood platter seasoned well.  Wish I could have tried the lobster fries but wasn't ready as we were early that day.  Overall good prices, good food",,,

56,Asiah C.,"Brooklyn, NY",461,318,165,2.0,6/13/2016,Disappointed to say the least.1. Thought it was a sit in after viewing the Instagram page for months and drooling at the food but it was only a fish market where you can order food to go.2.One of the employees got fired in front of all the customers.If i were to ever step foot back in here i guess i would do the option where they pick the seafood and then cook it.This review is based on a visit in 2015.,6,6,1
57,Adrienne N.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,12,0,5.0,1/14/2018,Delicious seafood. Good prices. Excellent service. Line can be long but it is well worth the wait. So happy this place is here!,,,
58,Marci A.,"Manhattan, NY",55,317,179,4.0,5/22/2017,Oh my god I have never had more amazing wings than the wings I've had here. I've honestly been craving them for weeks since I got them and I cannot wait to go back. I'm truly giving them 4 stars because of these wings. I also had the mac and cheese which has a bit of spiciness to it that gives it a nice kick. And I tried their salmon with potatoes and corn (the special which is only $8) but I was not impressed with this because I have acid reflux and they added Cajun spices to my salmon without asking me so it completely upset my tummy. I guess next time I go I'll ask them to hold off the Cajun and/or simply order my wings and go.,,,1
59,Alexandra W.,"Manhattan, NY",39,27,16,3.0,8/21/2017,"Now i want to start by saying to really do like this place but i am writing this review due to the inconsistencies i always encounter when i come. The food is great i usually come on Fridays and I pick my fish and veggies and i have it broiled. This past Friday i came in and picked up my somewhat usually order (2 fliets of salmon, just under a pound, 10 jumbo shrimp and my veggie medley). Since this is a custom order is tends to cost more than the usual fried stuff. My order after ordering my side & a drink was like 32, like i said my Friday usual lol. I usually wait for my food so i sat in the corner and wait. This day was a SUPER long wait but i waited patiently as always finally when my number was called there seemed to be an issue. It was unclear on what was mine (not strange this happens ALL the time) so after a lot of back and forth and waiting i was presented with something. Wasn't what i ordered :( ... Apparently the order before mine was a sautee order and mine got mixed up. I didn't even have the pieces of fish or shrimp i order... I ended up leaving with the sautee order because i did not have another 45 mins to stick around and wait ... Needless to say i am disappointed because when you do custom order your items are weighed and you pay based off the weight and i pay extra to have it broiled. So if i pay 26 for salmon and shrimp and then i get something that wasn't what i paid for i am not a happy camper, and too often this happens when i go. I really wish they would get a better system so peoples food are not mixed up. I go once a week and at least one a month my order is correct and its usually because its when the owner is there and if he sees me waiting he remember and will double check but there have been times when my order is lost and then they go pick out what i ordered again and redo it. So while the food is great i really think they need to work on their process or at least have some kind of check process because too often i am wasting time correcting something that should of be clear when i placed my order and worse that i paid for it and didn't get what i paid for. I need you guys to do better as i want to continue to be a customer but its not the best thing when your customers are used to mistakes ... eventually that will lead to us going somewhere else if we continue to be dissatisfied.",3,3,4
60,Tamy K.,"New York, NY",5,16,17,3.0,1/14/2018,This place has great fish but i have to say the cashier is acting as if she is doing you a favor. No smile and she speaks as if she is sick and came to work. Unfriendly. We called in to pick up the food and it actually took us a lil longer but it wasn't ready and they started preparing it when we arrived. When I got in and started to say what the purpose is to call in for the order they for faster. I monitored the owner another time when I was there and I know he cares a lot about his business. I'm sorry but I didn't feel welcome this time.,,,
61,Jamila W.,"New York, NY",2,5,0,1.0,9/16/2017,I'm sad to write this review. I ordered the calamari and fries. The food has decent flavor just a bit too salty. The entire meal took a left when I got dog sick. Idk if it was the food itself or the oil they fried it in but their food is no good.,2,,

Updated review",I had been jilted by lighthouse before but I am so glad I kept coming back. They've changed their cooks and their staff and Michael always makes sure his customers leave with a smile on their face. Their menu has expanded and the new chefs seem to know what they're doing because the food is amazing. I definitely recommend. Side note: I know this is a seafood spot but their wings are probably one of the best I've ever had (try it with their special 5pc w chips for $6),3,,2

I desperately wanted to support this small business but after so many disappointments I can no longer spend money here. They forget orders, they make wrong orders, they run out of food, they are slow, slow, slow, some days they decide they are cash only, different cooks, different outcomes... Don't bother calling an order in, it won't be ready when you get there or they'll just sell it to someone else if they run out of food. Who runs out of linguine??? And they never apologize for sh*tty service. Like they are doing you a favor by taking your money! Avoid at all cost, or at the least until they're under new management.August 2016",6,4,1

You can choose how you want your food cooked. You can even go as far as picking the pieces you want cooked from the large freezer yourself. It does not smell like the fish market in there and the fish is fresh.The staff was pleasant and the chef was outgoing and passionate about his food.The spot was small, not for dining in, but perfect for take out!I ordered the Sauteed Salmon on yellow rice, fried jumbo shrimp, mac and cheese, collard greens, and macaroni salad.

79,Toni S.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,18,7,3.0,7/19/2017,So ... the first time I came here the food was phenomenal I ordered the fish and shrimp combo with coleslaw and seasoned French fries .. the food was so good that i decided to get the same exact order again and this time the food was horrible the fried fish was old and dried out and taste like oil the coleslaw was bitter and the fries were not seasoned I guess this place is hit or miss depending on the cook for the day I went on a Monday so whoever cook on that day SUCK! Request for fresh fish!!,,,
80,Traci B.,"New York, NY",133,69,50,1.0,3/25/2017,This used to be a great place until the other day when I ordered shrimp with rice and found a HUGE piece of glass in my food. It was buried under the rice so when I took a bite it felt like I was eating ice. I was so taken back because I would never expect something like this to happen at a good place like this. I would've taken it back to address the issue but it was already after 11:30pm and too late. This ruined my experience here forever.,3,1,1

The area where the fresh seafood is being sold is extremely clean!! I am new to the neighborhood  and looks like is this is my go to place to pick up fresh fish, look for Lenny if you need any help, hes usually cleaning fish. Feeling lazzy to cook?  You can just ask them to steam your seafood for free or saute it for $2.00. I have not yet tried the food but I am pretty sure i will soon!!",,,

I'm used to southern style coleslaw but this slaw had the a vinegar flavor Charleston style. Had the salmon with lobster cream sauce; it was exquisite. For the price you can't go wrong. You select your fresh fish form the adjacent freezer section and it is weighed and cooked while you wait. The seating area is limited to 5-7 bar stools.,,,
85,Aja R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,1,3.0,6/29/2017,Their wings were good but the mac and cheese was dry and nasty potato salad was good also. I'll definitely get the honey zing wings again tho.,,,

I follow Lighthouse on instagram for a few weeks now and I finally decided to take a trip there. Everything was going great until I got to the register. Since this was my first time I did not know this establishment does not accept credit/debit. They only accept EBT food stamps and cash. I'm not really the cash handy type I'm more of a c.c. swiper. I was disappointed to hear that and immediately got turned off and didn't follow through with my purchase.However the food did look delicious and the staff was very helpful in assisting me with selecting what i wanted so I plan on trying them out again with cash on hand!,8,4,1

Not to expensive & well seasoned seafood will get 5 stars from me anyway... the sides I had chosen were mac & cheese n their potato salad (weird combo I know ) the staff was very pleasant they were on top of their orders and just really kind....after many months of skepticism I'm not disappointed & I will be making many more trips back to this establishment,2,1,

89,Laina R.,"Piermont, NY",26,14,10,5.0,12/24/2015,"This is probably one of my all time favorite fish markets. They'll make it anyway you like either steamed, fried, sautéed, etc. They have a large variety of sauces and butters to satisfy any, and all tastebuds. They're often very busy so I would just suggest you stay on top of your order and to verify before leaving with your food. I've never had a problem, and everything is always so fresh. Whenever in the area, I always pass by. Enjoy!!",7,1,1

The website boasts fresh seafood, but I found out that was a lie after I tasted the fish sandwich. My son ordered steamed salmon and shrimp. While the salmon was tasty, we don't know how the shrimps tasted because they were not cleaned!! How could they cook and serve that to people without removing the intestinal tract? That's just lazy and nasty!! I drove down from Westchester, waited over and hour and spent more than I normally do for food that ended up in the garbage. I wish they had to option not to give any stars.",,,
91,Remy T.,"New York, NY",220,21,80,4.0,6/28/2016,"I have always wanted to go to this fish market ever since they opened at that location, unfortunately I didn't get to go myself to purchase food from there the times I've eaten food from them so I can't really comment on the store itself, but the food omg it was delicious. Worth every penny, I got a lot of different seafood to steam so my food came up to just about $40 I believe. I was able to use my Yelp check-in discount code which made it a little better. But I honestly feel it was worth it. The steamed clams was soooooooo good, the only thing they are missing is the minced garlic and they will be good. I will definitely keep getting my food from them. Worth a try. I love the fact they put it in aluminum and not styrofoam plates, it keeps the food hot.",,,

And they make the food right in front of you. The only thing though is the wait time. You have to be patient. Depending on wat you get, youll wait about 25 minutes for your food but Id say its worth it. Jay Z was playing in the background was a plus.

Had to wait on line for at least 15 mins while the man at the register spoke to other customers around me and chefs. Finally placed my order and was estimated a 15 min wait, which I was fine with.

My bf ordered the shrimp with mac n cheese and yams and a blueberry lemonade.  All of the food was good except for the collards.  They were extremely salty.  I didn't realize it until I was home and I wasn't going back. The banana pudding as mediocre but not terrible. The blue raspberry lemonade tastes like a blue jolly rancher.  I for one do not like lemonade so this made the drink a lot better :)The place is very small so don't plan to dine in. There are about 4 stools and a counter where you can sit. I do like that you can pick out your own fresh seafood and have them make it.  The first star I took off was for the customer service.  While the cashier was very friendly and helpful, the rest of the staff was terrible.  The cook and one of the girls were arguing the whole time I waited for my food.  Yelling at the top of their lungs.  It was very unprofessional.  The girl, however, was really trying not to say anything.  It was the older man (cook) who kept on and on. It was a bit ridiculous. The other cook was just being rude to customers in general.  I don't know how long this place has been in business but it seemed to be too busy for them and they were all overwhelmed with the amount of tickets.  The 2nd star was taken off for the portions and price.  For the high prices, they don't give you big enough portions.  I may come back to this spot.

It's a fish market that sells cooked food and seafood dinners but they do have maybe 6 seats so I guess it's a restaurant. I had the fish and shrimp meal with collard greens and the greens were way too salty for consumption. Overall I would say I'd go back but their payment options are very misleading. They have a register with a card swipe and a credit card machine right next to it. Their menu board even says they take cards but they have a paper sign up on the window to the fresh fish area that says cash only.

So many of my friends rave about it as if it is amazing, but my experience was not even close to what I was hoping. I had the fish sandwich and my wife had the shrimp dinner which was $18 bucks with two sides and to me just seemed to be way overpriced. Both dishes were underwhelming. My wife had mac and cheese and yams. The mac and cheese had no flavor at all. It was borderline terrible and needs a lot of work. The yams were actually pretty good. Oh yea, and let us not forget the strand of hair that we found in our food! Yum Yum! The fish sandwich was okay. It was edible, but nothing I would desire to come back for. I didn't try the shrimp, but my wife let me know that she was not impressed. Not sure that we will give this place another shot.",1,,

The seafood was flavored well. They just need to puncture the Styrofoam so the fried food doesn't lose its crispy goodness.  Also, this spot is super clean because it is take out. Staff are nice. They have a fish market which is open during early hours. And they take credit cards!!! I wish them nothing but success because they are a great addition to the neighborhood.",3,,1

So we place our order and after waiting for 20 minutes, half of the order comes out. We wait another 10-15 minutes for the other half of the order to come out.... And nothing. Then one of the people behind the counter, asks what we're waiting for... We tell them, another 5-10 minutes passes and nothing . Mind you were number 21, and they're calling orders 32 by then. So we proceed to inquire on what is taking so long and if we're coming up next. They disregard our questions . So we wait... A few more minutes.. The staff was confused and disorganized and basically gave away our order to someone else. We tried to explain to them that they gave away our order... And instead of them making our order next, they continue to serve those that came way after us.. My boyfriend just asked for his money back because because we had waited over an hour for our food... And it didn't appear like they were going to make the 2nd half of the order. No apologies from them or anything, the WORST customer service EVER! Didn't get to try the food and I won't be because I'll never give an establishment like this my hard earned dollar!",22,2,2

They should have more seating room at least another counter or something but doesn't look like thats happening...The service...the service is why it gets 4 and not 5 stars. Everyone working there was nice and polite...however...it was so busy that they seemed almost flustered with the business. Orders were slowed down and forgotten and had to tell 3 or 4 people what I ordered before it finally came...and getting the food takes between 15-30 mins thats the only frustration... but great food , nice people....worth the wait and trip to Harlem",,,1

122,Mental O.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,16,1,3.0,2/16/2017,"Heard about this restaurant for a minute now and with all the big talk, I decided to try them out. 1. The lighthouse fish market& Restaurant is small for the amount of people they allow inside at once to order. 2. This place is really intended for take out, so I don't know why they consider it a restaurant with only three barstools at a counter. 3. This establishment is pretty unorganized wth no crowd control. . 4. The food is more tasteful than other places I tried before, so I give them that, but don't try to save leftovers for the next day, because it won't taste the same. 5. I like how they prepare your steam food fresh and their prices are reasonable. 6. I won't rush to go back no time soon, due to the fact they stated that my order for two would be about 10 minutes and it took them more than a half hour to fix mines. It would not hurt to try them, however you've been warned.They even except EBT cards, so you may get a idea of the customers that patronize this place to order.",1,,

Seems like heaven.... I was like a kid in a candy store selecting snow crab legs,salmon filet,broiled snapper,scallops and a wide array of vegetables.i had the salmon and scallops sautéed with a hint of cayenne pepper along with steamed potatoes,corn,Brussel sprouts and carrots. That was just the beginning......threw in some steamed crab legs with corn and potatoes and a whole snapper that was roasted(broiled)like I was in Jamaica..........as a person easily influenced by my stomach,I was amazed at the care they took in preparing the food and was drawn to ordering the ""crazy wings"" with fries......best decision ever...staff friendly,wait customary,food delicious....Couldn't be more pleased.",,,

FIRST THE SERVICE HERE IS HORRIBLE. Mixing up orders and to much fraternizing with the customers but u have to tell you about a specific event that have turned me off for good. So I ordered for deliver: the girl on the phone did not know what I was ordering or how much it was. She clearly made up a price; I order the same thing often so I know the price. So when the delivery man arrives with my food, he tells me there  is surcharge for delivering this far. Okay cool just would like to have to known that when she quoted me a price on the phone. After I opened my food (sautéed salmon and shrimp with broccoli) is COVERED IN SAUCE AND OIL.. Clearly not edible. I call the restaurant to discuss what they delivered to me and the girl on the phone  says to me "" you didn't tell us you didn't want to drain the sauce"" .. So when you order pasta at a restaurant do they include the water they boiled it in!!??? She then acts as if I am the problem so she finally agrees to send me a new meal and refund me the extra money they charged in the beginning. When the delivery guys arrived again he says there is no refund but when I show him the original meal.. Even he was disgusted saying is that butter. It's so sad I keep trying to give this local business a chance but they cannot get it together. This is it for me.",4,2,1

My friend and I visited here after I had a minor surgery. After reading the reviews I had to say something. #1..A black establishment in Harlem trying to help the community eat healthy and FRESH FOOD!! Men busting their asses to get the food out as best and as fast as they could. I had no problem whatsoever with the staff and to see good looking men of color working hard was a damn turn on to be honest! They were friendly and honest that they didn't have what was on the menu..I totally understood. #2..They are COOKING TO ORDER it's not a pot of shrimp pasta ready made to plop in a styrofoam container so you can get to work on time from your lunch break! The wait is necessary, If you can't wait, come or order when you can wait! #3..THEY CATER TO WELFARE RECIPIENTS!! Do I need to say that again? Ain't no shame in my game I'm a proud holder of EBT with what little I get to help me with my financial obligations so TUH! Have your cash money or your EBT, simple.#3..The food was GOOD! My friend and I ordered a lot because we knew we wouldn't be back soon since we're from Queens. We spent over $150. They didn't have a few things but next time we'll call to make sure they do.  All in all let's not be petty!! Big up establishments such as this one instead of tearing them down. I in no way saw rudeness but I feel for people wanting better customer service. That comes with practice and teaching so..they'll get there. People waiting we're not pissed to me, maybe hungry but not HANGRY. We're friendly so we made conversation with whoever, I saw smiles on black faces and no attitude. It's a small place and giving what they're working with I'm commending them! I'm going back soon and I'll take that train ride and spend my Cash or EBT to have quality food made by my people  much love Lighthouse",1,,

I came into the restaurant before it got busy and placed my order. They told me 20 minutes. I returned to get my food after 20 minutes and they said that my order was being prepared. After seeing people who came in after me get their orders I began to become impatient. Two of their employees repeatedly told me that my order was being prepared without acknowledging how long I've actually been waiting. Once I was finally able to speak to an employee, I told him that I had been waiting 45 minutes. They begin to look for my order and realize that the order slip is sitting on the counter and hasn't been prepared yet.Now I've been waiting for over an hour for me order that was supposed to be ready within 20 minutes.Long story short.

158,Mel R.,"Boston, MA",0,5,0,2.0,7/22/2015,"Recently visited this restaurant anxiously desiring their food. Now, what I didn't know was that I was going to have to wait over an hour to get my food, while most were in and out within 15 minutes. After complaining after 30 minutes, they started to finally cook my food. 15 minutes after receiving 75% of my food, I asked how long it would take for my lobster to be done. While the pleasant and very helpful cashier (also assisted here and there with getting meals together and out) was trying to get the cooks to speed up my last order, the person who looked to be in charge tells her, ""yes, it's almost done for 'him'"". He was referring to a customer whom he knew that had arrived 40 minutes after me. The cashier told him that my lobster order was next, not his male friend. Well, 10 minutes after that, that customer left.. assuming with MY lobster. The man in charge ignored the fact that I was there over 45 minutes waiting on food. So, I had to wait an additional 20 minutes for more lobster to be cooked (it was ""frozen"").Extremely unprofessional. One of the cooks and the person who looked to be in charge did more personal talking than making sure customers had a pleasant experience and that the food came out in a timely manner. I had drove all the way from Boston for a good night out in NYC. This restaurant took over an hour of my time getting my food to me, tampering with my mood.I visually noticed a person who was there before me (repeat customer) complain about HIS food taking over an hour from which he ordered it. Although he was pissed he had to wait that long after working a 12 hour work shift on his feet, he was compensated for waiting by them offering him a free meal (in addition to his order). Lucky him, huh.So, pretty much, I plan on never visiting this unprofessional restaurant again, regardless how good the food was. It was hot in there. Crowded. Very uncomfortable to have to wait on anything.",,,

I can't tell you how many new restaurants I've stopped by to peek inside or ask for a menu then received no engagement. The guy behind the counter waved my husband and I inside so that certainly encouraged a return visit to order food on a future visit. We did just that. I really enjoyed the shrimp and chips--lightly seasoned in fresh oil made to order, delish. The fries were really tasty and cooked perfectly. This isn't the usual fish joint so be prepared to pay a few more bucks. I wished my order had at least 2 more shrimp and I look forward to trying other items on the menu.

He was very friendly but holding personal conversations with others off the line is very unprofessional. Looks like a new business in the hood with potential. Food wasnt that great at all. Very bland and seasoning was unevely distributed.,2,1,1
162,Andres M.,"Bronx, NY",47,47,3,1.0,7/3/2015,"I love the food here, but the service is horrible. I called ahead to place my order, was told it would be ready by the time I got there only to arrive 10 minutes later and have to place my order again. Gentleman behind the counter told me 2 minutes, 10 minutes later I was still waiting. 30 minutes after I called I finally got my order; only to have it wrapped the wrong way. Stay away if you want decent service.",4,1,1
163,Annie D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,1,1.0,3/26/2016,"I would give this place a 0, but because I cannot I have to give it 1 star, but make NO mistake, this place doesn't deserve 1 star. I read the reviews before patronizing this place and wanted to check it out myself. Folks, believe the reviews! I cannot believe that this place is still open. Please take note that I am calling it a ""place"" and not a restaurant for a reason. Consumers need to ban together and shut this place down and make a statement on what happens when you open up a ""restaurant"" and have unacceptable slow service. The health department should shut down this place down because its frankly disgusting. You have the owner (tall, black dude) who does NOTHING, but walk around in the little, cramped ""restaurant."" I witnessed so many things in this restaurant while waiting on the line 30 minutes just to place an order. Then you wait another 30 minutes to get the food. The owner just walked around and it NEVER once occured to him to put on some gloves and get his ass to work. I am all about supporting black owned businesses, but c'mon the service sucks and the food is NOTHING to write home about. The oil looked dirty and stale. I saw an employee cleaning the windows with windex over the raw seafood. People walking around where you cook the food with no gloves, sweat pouring down their face. It was simply DISGUSTING. At one point, the owner opened the steamer to get something out of it and burned himself by first, not wearing the appropriate pot handles to retrieve very hot food from the steamer and two, being so akward with retrieving the item from the steamer that he spilled the gravy all over the floor. I never saw anyone (in the 30 minutes I was there waiting for my food) come with a mop or something to clean up the floor. Again, how is this business still open?? I live in the area and I remember seeing how disorganized it was to get it open and up and running and its as equally as disorganized now that it is open. Simply Horrible. I woud not recommend anyone patronizing this place. This is not a restaurant that can cater to a large volume of people. Simply ridiculous. My advice to the owner- do better or shut it down or you will be forced to shut down!!! My advice to potential customers and/or customers who patrionize this place currently-Stay away! Its not worth it. I almost forget to add that this place DOES NOT accept credit cards. You must pay in cash. Now, you tell me....does this place deserve to remain open in 2016 when they cannot invest in the ability to accept credit cards.",5,3,2
164,Leen M.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,3/21/2015,"The service is awful. The wait for my food took almost forever. I ordered muscles along with some other stuff the other stuff came first so the guys in the restaurant rushed the muscles and of course they wasn't done. I'm so upset because my time is very limit and when I do eat out which is not often I want to enjoy it but, I didn't this time I hope this restaurant gets better with service and food",2,2,
165,Alex P.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,3.0,10/7/2015,"First, I'll say the food was really great & the dessert (coconut cake & banana pudding) was truly amazing, best I've ever had. But, what prevents me from giving 4 or 5 stars to this establishment is the lack of organization. **If you place an order, do not go outside, wait inside and make sure your order is not forgotten and accurate**On the day I went, the place wasn't even completely packed, there were about 6 or 7 people there. And There were about 4 or 5 workers squeezed into that small area behind the register, unfortunately these employees weren't exactly in sync. Even though one worker at the register wrote down on the ticket how I wanted my seafood seasoned, the cook clearly did NOT read it because he says he didn't know of my request. I told him that my request for jerk seasoning was written on the ticket and he shrugged. Ultimately, I waited 30 mins to get one order of crabs (which was not jerk seasoned) bc other customers would ask to get their stuff out of the steamer before the timer ended and then my stuff was forgotten & pushed to back.",,,
166,Malik M.,"New York, NY",385,1,0,1.0,11/2/2014,"I wish I could write a review on how the food here but I've officially been waiting over 2 hours to receive my food. If delivery is not a priority for this place then they should really not deliver. I live maybe a 5 minute drive away from this establishment and have called twice about my order once at the 1 hour mark and the second time at the 2 hour mark. When I called the second time whomever answered the phone said ""2 HOURS!?!?!"" as if they were as confused as me. Then checked my order and said ""the order is in route."" Thats it? No sorry for the delay etc. etc. etc. just your order is in route. I can not recommend you ordering from this place EVER. There is no way my food will be hot by the time they get here. I am pretty sure I will have to call for a refund.DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE",,,
167,Furaha G.,"Westminster, CA",1,4,1,3.0,10/4/2015,"I went to this restaurant at the urging of my daughter who follows a fan of the restaurant on instagram. I was impressed with the fresh seafood selection and the variation of the sauteed ingredients.  I selected Bosa fish and Colossal Shrimp to be deep fried. My fish was prepared with some unknown spices and was good; however, it was the shelled and not deveined colossal shrimp that I was unsatisfied with the cooking method.  When I inquired about the shrimp being deep fried, I was told it was lightly battered, but it was not.  Who in their right mind doesn't de-shell shrimp for frying and clean it for that matter!",,,
168,Carm B.,"Paramus, NJ",0,3,0,4.0,9/5/2015,"During my trip to Lighthouse this week I ordered fried shrimp, mac and cheese and yams. The shrimp was fried to perfection, mac and cheese was a little cheesy for my taste buds and the yams were exceptional. Would definitely visit again. I appreciate how everything is cooked to order. For take-out only.",,,
169,Tony W.,"Greenwood, NY",87,29,1,1.0,7/25/2015,"They are the worst. Went in there to order the lobster tail stuffed with shrimp and the girl looked at me like I was crazy. She didn't even know what I was talking about! I told her to look at the menu where it clearly states that what they serve. She was like ""okay, let me see if they can do that."" She then turns around ask one of her co-workers if that can be done. He said ""Yeah, we can do that."" As if it's a special order. ITS ON YOUR MENU!!! so he then goes to the back brings out a huge lobster tail saying ""we can kill a man with this!"" And tries to sell it. Um no. The menu says it $25 for the tail stuffed with shrimp and you want to cut me a deal and sell it to me for $40 dollars!! REALLY?? They were totally unorganized and ill prepared to do what they say they can do. I rather fry up a chickens ass before I ever to eat there. Black businesses want support from one another but then turn around and act shady. FUCK THAT.",4,3,1
170,Lenin V.,"West Bronx, NY",28,2,0,4.0,11/30/2014,I visited the establishment on my day off to get the licious fish and chips that are made out this supreme place. the fish was fresh  and the ambience was clean everybody was polite I'm going back 100 more times. But please know that your order may take a while they have a number where you can call the order in.,,,
171,Zee W.,"New York, NY",0,7,0,1.0,11/2/2014,"Worst customer service and delivery ever! I called to place an order and was asked to hold for quite a whole while the employee yelled and cussed at his staff before taking my order. I placed an order for delivery at 3:45pm. An hour later my food hadn't arrived so I called the restaurant to find out status of my order. I was told my food was on the way and informed they'd ran out of corn. An hour later my food still hadn't arrived. I called the restaurant and was told the delivery guy was on a bike and got hit by a car an was taken to the hospital.  He asked if I still wanted my order and told me they'd ^) have to remake it and send it with a driver. 10 minutes later my food arrived with a delivery guy on a bike.  I asked him if he was the one who got hit by a car and he said I didn't get hit I almost did. He told me my total was $18, however online the tilapia dish was only $8. He said you can just give me $8. I handed him a twenty and he told me he didn't have change.  He said he'd go to the store to get change but asked if I watch his bike.  It was 40 degrees outside and I wasn't going to watch his bike. He should have had change!  I should have got my food for free!  Really disappointed with this place. Don't waste your time. The owner has no integrity! Who would lie about someone getting hit by a car an being hospitalized to trying to overcharge me!",6,9,1
