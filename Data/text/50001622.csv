0,Brandon D.,"New York, NY",675,55,175,5.0,8/8/2018,"AMAZING. Okay, so this place is a great combination of things. 1) it is a great little place to get together with a few buds to drink a good beer and play board games. 2) they've got surprisingly GREAT food here. 3) the service / bartenders are super friendly. Food/drank: 5/5. I had a really good Gose beer that was crisp and refreshing, just what I wanted. More than anything, what really blew me away with this place was it's BEERCHEESE AND BREAD. IT WAS SERIOUS. I'm from the south, and we know good food. This ranks in my top 5 beat bar snacks, ever. The beercheese was flavorful, decadent and not too much of anything aside from delicious (meaning it was well balanced). Paired with the thick cut, butter charred bread, it was a combo that could honestly give any restaurant appetizer a run for its money, regardless of it's foodie-vibe / $$$ price range. Seriously, if you're in the area, just go back for this. On top of a great beer rotating selection, you'll get to experience this amazing beercheese and take your friends. They will love it (and you)!Atmosphere and Service: 5/5. Vibe is sort of like a dive bar-ish, maybe a bit more elevated, but not pretentious at all. Folks working here were friendly and attentive. Small space in the front that opens up to back which has a great collection of games and more space. Again, a good hangout for people either starting the night off or ending it with one more round (and the beercheese)! Could be a good date spot, as it's casual and cozy. Price to experience ratio: 5:5. If you're looking for a good neighborhood bar, this is the one. The food takes this place way above some of the others around, honestly. With a rotating beer selection and $6-$10 brews, prices are average for ale houses. The food I had was $13 for a jumbo beercheese, and it was well worth that and more. If you're a sinai student or Steep Rock Member or student in general (I think?) you get a 10% discount. Check out Earl's.",2,1,2
1,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",961,976,2710,4.0,11/18/2018,"It's a cool place to hangout, it's a very small local bar with a few beers on top but with some pretty kick ass grilled cheese sandwiches and cheese related items. Once you get there, you head for the bar where you find the menu and where you do your ordering. After ordering, they give you your drinks and you find a place to sit where they deliver your food to your table.The food:Beer cheese- New York State cheddar cheese spread with toasted Sourdough bread. This is the item to get here, it was really good, it kinda had a pimento cheese feel. So, the first thing you do is take the piece of garlic and you rub it onto the warm sourdough bread, then you spread the cheese on top then eat. I enjoyed the cheese spread, it was nice and had a little bit of a kick, but the warmed sourdough with all that buttery goodness was really good, it kinda felt like a brioche. yelp.com/user_local_phot…N.Y. State Cheddar- Pork belly, kimchi, fried egg on Sourdough. I thought the sandwich was really good. I enjoyed the egg and the quality of their sourdough was really great, it was a different kind of sourdough than the one served with the beer cheese. I did enjoy the sandwich but I did wish the kimchi had a little more kick, I felt the kimchi needed to be more fermented and it would have been nice if the the pork belly had more flavor and I wish the pork belly had some texture to it since it was soft throughout. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",4,2,3

Funny they had a can of Melvin DIPA on the menu, we have a bunch in the fridge.There is dim lighting, board games, a small but diverse beer menu and a whole open space to meet new people and have a great time.",6,3,5
3,Sophia P.,"New York, NY",535,226,62,4.0,9/11/2018,Cute cozy space with a smaller but excellent local beer selection and lots of good bites. Cabin in the mountains vibe. It's a very casual atmosphere - owned by the same guy who owns Steep Rock the bouldering/rock climbing gym. Good place to hang out with 2-3 friends. Space is tight but it's open seating. My friend and I got the bread and cheese which came with a lot of bread and was super filling. Looking forward to dropping by again when I'm in the area. Menu was extensive with lots of carbs and cheese and some pickles.,,,
4,Vanessa W.,"New York, NY",454,130,313,4.0,7/4/2018,"Definitely recommend Earl's Taco, the beer cheese, and the watermelon cider.Don't let the Earl's Taco sit too long though or it gets pretty soggy. The scallion pancake shell worked super well with the braised pork shoulder. The radish and shredded cabbage added a clean crunch. Absolutely delicious.The beer cheese was exactly what you'd expect yet somehow better. The crispy bread it comes with is slightly buttery and the perfect base to slather beer cheese on.The watermelon cider was crisp and refreshing. Perfect for summer and perfect with heavier, greasier food like you'll likely end up getting.The pickled eggs weren't anything special. Basically hard-boiled eggs with a bit of a pickled flavor, mostly from the pickled veggies topping it.The NY State Cheddar Grilled Cheese is filled with pork belly and a fried egg - how do you not like the sound of that? If you also like kimchi, this is the grilled cheese for you.That's not their only unique grilled cheese offering, though; they also have a Gorgonzola Grilled Cheese that comes with a ginger fig preserve and potato crunch. Sounds like something I'd be down for!There's also a strawberry guava sour beer on menu that I'm looking forward to coming back to try.",,1,
5,Danielle K.,"New Orleans, LA",707,189,98,5.0,10/1/2018,"This is a beyond amazing place and a staple for me. Not only do I love their atmosphere with wooden tables big enough to house a group but their rosemary and goat cheese mac and cheese made with rigatoni is to die for. It's perfectly balanced and perfectly creamy - a real treat. They have ""beer cheese"" that comes with decadent bread that is reminiscent of pimento cheese dip. They always have a nice selection of beers. Sometimes I wish they had more wheat selections, but I also like ciders and they always seem to have a good one. Recently, it was a peach cider but it's been strawberry before. No New Yorker should be able to say that they've never been to this cute little dive.",3,,2
6,Randi G.,"Bronx, NY",44,83,69,4.0,9/26/2018,"Hanging out on the Museum Mile? Making your out of town guests think you're super fancy? This is the perfect spot for a post-cultural outing to show you still know your roots with a good hole-in-the-wall establishment. This place is a welcome stop amongst much fancier, less fun places in the area. GREAT beer selection, hearty foods and lots of seating to hang out and chill and talk about the Picassos you just saw. (Get the beer cheese...make it a jumbo size. The bread is as outstanding as the cheese!)",1,,1
7,Courtney O.,"San Diego, CA",733,911,1083,5.0,7/24/2018,"From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but step inside and you'll find a really cool interior space and a restaurant with awesome food. I was so surprised when I walked inside. The front area has a few tables and bar stools with a bar and the back has a larger dining area. I love that the menu is a little eclectic. It has some Asian and Pacific Islander inspiration. I got the Hawaiian plate. I'm from Hawaii and was craving some familiar foods. It comes with rice, macaroni salad, spam and pork. They cooked the spam well and the rice was good too. It's hard to replicate real local macaroni salad but they gave it a solid try. I also liked that the plate came with a side of this sort of Kim chee like slaw. It was tasty and added a lot of flavor to the plate. My friend got the taco and instead of a tortilla, it was wrapped in a Korean pancake. What a good idea! We also split some beer cheese. It was really good with the thick cuts of bread. I really liked the food here. Everything was super tasty and good!",,,1
8,Kyle D.,"Chicago, IL",291,660,1202,4.0,3/7/2018,"Overall: Cozy, humble, and delicious, Earl's is the place to be for a laid-back meal.The good: The TBD breakfast sandwich, which is a classier McGriddle, really hit the spot. The brioche buns were laced (and seemed pan fried) with maple syrup and served with jelly on the side, which took the savory yet sweet combo to the top. As for the atmosphere, it is humble, semi-divey, and unique. The lone cashier/server was friendly and the music was good for a low-key morning.The not-so-good: They don't serve OJ, due to the fact that they make their ""OJ"" in-house, so they have to save it for mimosas. The food also took awhile, considering we were 1 of 2 tables. Atmosphere: 8.5/10Service: 8/10Food: 8.5/10",1,,
9,Helena F.,"Derwood, MD",81,242,109,4.0,10/2/2018,"This place is a hidden gem in NY. Their beer is awesome (and I say this after spending four years in Prague) and they have an awesome beer cheese to go with it. We grabbed brunch here and it was simply delicious! Although I am not able to be a regular because I don't live nearby, I would probably be one if I were a New Yorker. Cheers!",,,
10,Joan S.,"New York, NY",320,80,209,5.0,7/2/2018,"This is a place that people from my school often go to to hang out - and for good reasons too! This place has great drinks, lively/casual ambience, with very memorable Beer cheese. Food:Beer cheese...AMAZING. You need to try it for yourself to know but the bread is absolutely delicious and when you top it off with a generous spread of beer cheese...you're in carbs heaven. I always get this when I come and it's a favorite among my friends who frequent Earl's as well!Drinks:Not much of a drinker myself but their wine and beers are decent!Service:Super friendly staff!Ambiance:There are larger tables to sit as soon as you enter this place but also seating in the back including more tables and booths. They have Jenga blocks too, which is fun. At night it can get crowded and a bit hard to have conversations with the noise level when it's crowded.",1,,
11,Marjorie M.,"Goshen, NY",2,2,0,5.0,11/8/2018,OUTRAGEOUS! The Earl Taco is beyond words (pork shoulder) and the Kirkland is most definitely the best hotdog I've ever had! Not to mention the atmosphere is totally chill and the craft beer is cold and delish! IT'S A MUST!,,,
12,Amber K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",50,79,138,4.0,2/6/2018,"Don't even take the time to wonder what Beer Cheese is...just run to Earl's and try some...now. Honestly no way to describe it other than heaven on bread. When I first tried it I was expecting some fondue type cheese spread where they really overpower the beer taste in with the cheese, but that was gladly not the case. Okay so now that we've determined if you are coming here, you are getting the Beer Cheese 100%, we can move on to actual dinner. I've tried the Spicy tomato soup and the Calabro mozzarella (mayo, pickles, potato chips on English muffin). When I tried the soup last time it had a really overpowering ginger taste which I wasn't a fan of, but I've tried my friends other times and it tasted great so I think it just depends how they make that batch. The Calabro is probably one of the weirdest sandwiches I've had, but it was strangely good from all the different flavor incorporations. A classic to get is the Cuban Rueben and I think that is one of their most popular items.Earl's is always packed with not a lot of seating so watch out when going at prime dinner hours. They have board games that you can play at the table which I really like as Jenga is on the menu almost every time I go with friends.",,,
13,Yvonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",74,370,972,3.0,5/27/2018,"3.5 stars.  I was craving grilled cheese, so naturally I came here to satisfy said craving.  Good selection of sandwiches -- I particularly liked the NY state cheddar grilled cheese with pork belly, kimchi, and fried egg.  Lots of flavor and a filling sandwich.The beer cheese is a popular starter, but I'm not a huge fan of it, although we didn't finish and ended up taking it home, and I heated up the beer cheese at home and enjoyed it more melted.Finally, we also tried the scallion pancake taco, which was closer to the size of a burrito than a taco.  The scallion pancake was surprisingly good, but overall, as a sandwich/taco, it wasn't too memorable.",1,,
14,Sonam S.,"Hicksville, NY",44,31,15,5.0,5/2/2018,"Came here for brunch on Sunday as we were in the area. Ended up splitting the mozzarella grilled cheese and of course, the beer cheese.Loved that the grilled cheese was on an English muffin! To be honest, I always go for the beer cheese and it never, ever, ever disappoints. When you rub the garlic on the bread and the slather the beer cheese on and bite into it, it feels like a garlicky slice of heaven. And one that I want over and over and over again.",2,,

16,Thomas E.,"Fort Worth, TX",283,236,225,5.0,9/18/2017,"YUMMY!! Came here with some friends after spending the day in Central Park. Got the beer cheese dip- really great. Spicy, cheesy, garlicy with some deliciously toasted bread. All good things to say about this. Then the sandwich with the pork belly and kimchi - really enjoyed this. Good deal and definitely worth it. Bread pudding - had some of my friends' and wow it was heavenly. SO good. The flavors.. the texture.. the sweetness cut with some tartness of an apple slice.... nothing but good flavors and truly delicious.Some nice beers to choose from too.Overall great time for Jenga and food with some good friends. I will for sure be back !",5,,
17,Elizabeth K.,"New York, NY",297,141,53,4.0,4/29/2018,Really can't go wrong with some beer cheese and a quality brew. There are not that many good beer spots uptown that have a vibe like this. The bartender was super nice and let my friend and I try beers before we ordered. Definitely be prepared to share a table with strangers as this place gets packed. That's the only con. It's so crowded! Beer cheese for life though. definitely go.,1,,
18,Deana B.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",342,101,295,5.0,11/27/2017,"Earl's is one of the only places that I can convince my downtown friends to make a trip uptown for. It's the perfect place to casually hang out with your friends or chat up the bartenders or locals and enjoy some amazing food and beers without breaking the bank. I lived near Earl's for years so I've had almost everything on the menu. You really can't go wrong but I'd highly recommend the Beer Cheese,  Calabro Mozzarella Grilled Cheese, Earl's Taco, Tomato Soup, Cuban Rueben and Mac & Cheese. Since I've been here so many times, here are a few of my ""veteran Earls-goer"" tips:1. Come with friends if you're hungry or indecisive so you can share a few things.2. Rub the garlic on the bread that comes with the beer cheese. You'll smell but it's worth it. 3. The mac & cheese and the Calabro pair well with the tomato soup. 4. Order just a side of beer cheese for your chips that come with the sandwiches or for your bread that comes with the soup. 5. Treat your bartenders well and they'll treat you even better. Everyone that works here is awesome and makes you feel like you're home. As far as the drinking goes, if you're a craft beer lover, this a must. There are 6 beers on tap and usually 6+ cans to choose from. The selection changes every few days but they will bring back fan favorites. If you're not a beer drinker, do not worry. They have canned rose and red or white wine by the glass. If you hate beer and wine, then order some fresh water on tap and still come for the food. Yes, Earl's is quite north but yes, it is totally worth it.",,,
19,Kevin S.,"Astoria, NY",0,10,17,4.0,7/23/2018,Great comfort food!! Loved the toast with cheese dip. Wasn't into the Mac and cheese almost tasted like it had Gouda in it but the grilled cheese was really good too!,1,,

I enjoyed this. The other dishes were spoken highly of, around the table. Tomato soup for one. But at the end of the day, beer and cheese. Beer and cheese. Beer and cheese.

24,Brian S.,"Mount Vernon, NY",12,104,11,4.0,2/16/2018,"Earl's is a really cool little place with excellent beer, good music and, in my one visit so far, really good food.  I had the gorgonzola grilled cheese sandwich, made up of a pretty generous slice of cheese, fig paste and potato chips (that the menu refers to as ""potato crunch"") on a brioche bun with some chips on the side.  If I am perfectly honest, there was a bit too much fig paste on the sandwich, which takes away some of the bite from the gorgonzola, but that's just my personal taste - it was excellent all the same.  This place has a very Brooklyn/Bushwick bar vibe, which admittedly is pretty cool when it's not packed, but I imagine it gets pretty loud during happy hour/late in the evening.Overall Earl's is a really cool little bar/restaurant, definitely standing out above most places in the neighborhood.",,,

Beer cheese is my absolute favorite and this review isn't about the food but the service. Tonight was a horrible experience. I ordered a jumbo beer cheese ahead of time and the guy confidently said it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. It's taken 45+ mins and now my family and I missed the beginning of the super bowl due to their inaccurate timing. He offered a drink on the house but by then I just wanted my food and to get back to my place.,,,
26,Bryant R.,"Manhattan, NY",101,518,0,2.0,12/29/2017,"Mediocre craft beers and thick breads with salty, decadent cheeses, this place is a nice concept at a decent price point which makes it all the more disappointing to have to dock a couple stars for the indifferent if not mildly hostile service experience that I encountered this week. An unexpected concept for the neighborhood as one walks in and can almost imagine that they've teleported to a dive in Williamsburg or the East Village, almost. The annoying part was that on Wednesday afternoon, the server saw me waiting for many minutes before she took any new orders and then proceeded promptly to ask someone who had just sidled up for their order without acknowledging me. . . . It gave me the impression that she didn't want my ... kind of person patronizing the place. Luckily, the other gentleman notified her politely that I had been waiting first and she sullenly took the order and eventually delivered it to our table.",1,,
27,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,3.0,11/1/2017,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for lunch on a weekday. This place is a little non-descript so be on the lookout for it.Inside there is a front bar section and a back section with some booths. It is a bit dark, but fine enough for lunch.After looking through the menu, we decided to split the kale salad for 2 with pork belly and the cuban reuben.The cuban reuben was decent and a good size for the price. My main gripe about the sandwich is that the flavor of the meat sort of got lost in the cheese and mustard.The kale salad was huge--especially for the price, but just did not have much going on. I also thought that it was wayyyy overdressed, though the croutons were good. The pork belly was also outstanding as most pieces melted in your mouth.Overall, this place is a bit clunky and sort of an awkward space. The service was fine, but we couldn't tell if we were supposed to order at the bar or get our own plates or anything like that since the waiter did not seem too attentive. Nevertheless, the pricing here is super reasonable for the area and there are a couple interesting items on the menu. Definitely stick to the meat and you'll probably be happy.",3,,

Any who, upon entering I was happy with the interior and the feel of the place. Made me feel like I was home in Astoria. The back of the bar has A LOT more room than the front and it was pretty cozy. There was even room for a company happy hour on about 4 beer garden tables. Furthermore, there was plenty of room for coats and work bags! Pricing: High, but fair for the area.

We waited a ltitle while for our food but I think it was just really busy. We ordered the beer cheese dip and sourdough toast as an appetizer and oh my golly gosh, it was so good. The toast was buttered so nicely and the cheese dip (it came with garlic on the side too) was amazing - I wish I could recreate it.As our main dish, we shared the taco. The shell was a scallion pancake - um hello YUM - and the filling was brisket or pulled pork I can't remember but boy was it tasty. I left feeling very happily full that evening.

It took some nudging for me to convince my companions to cross the Park Ave Rail. Grab a menu by the bar and find a table to give yourself some time to decide on what to get. It is a simple menu, but you might find yourself in an internal conflict for a decision. The uninflated prices were a comforting find in NYC. Order and pay at the bar, and the bartender will give you a number. The portions are more than enough and at an amazing price. The NY state cheddar grilled cheese sandwiches (""Pork belly, kimchi, and a fried egg on sourdough"") were the size of a toddler's head. The best part of my Cuban Reuben (""Braised pork shoulder, house-made pickled vegetables and peppers, beer cheese mustard, swiss on marbled rye"") was the rye. It was perfectly crunchy with the ideal amount of fat and toastiness. I hope one day to master the art of such perfectly cooked bread.Edit // -1*According to the NYC open data project, earlier this month (April 2017), they had ""Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.""",2,,

Guthrie's doesn't serve food so if you want to eat, Earl's is probably the better choice.I came here and had a few beers. The beers are pretty pricey here, especially considering the neighborhood. Around $9 a piece, but to their credit, the selection is ample and rotating. We order the beer cheese which comes with a stack of toast. It was absolutely delicious. I couldn't get enough of it. It reminded me of a creamier pimento cheese spread. The tomato soup was also pretty good but nothing mind blowing. It did go well with the beer cheese and toast. We also got the bread pudding which was good but a little too sweet for my taste.Overall, I'm not sure if I'll be a regular here. The prices are a bit high for me and I'm frankly not that big of a beer aficionado. I much prefer Guthrie's with their selection of 2 beers and a wall of  liquors. The beer cheese though, I'd probably come back for that at some point.Also, I was told by a couple random girls at some point that people in the city know Earl's as the bar where you go to meet young doctors.

37,Michelle L.,"New York, NY",869,559,1899,5.0,3/6/2017,"YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM. So yum! My roommate trekked here on a cold Sunday afternoon for Brunch and it was so worth the walk in the cold. Earl's is a casual bar/sit down place that serves amazing food. You order at the bar and they will assign you a number and bring it to you. I can't say what it is like during the evenings but I bet it is super fun. A great place for people to chill, drink beer and eat beer cheese while playing Jenga.For brunch, they only serve the brunch menu Saturday and Sunday so menu is different. We shared the beer cheese regular size which was huge. It could be easily shared between 3-4 people. The bread was out of this world. Perfectly toasted with a buttload of butter on it. The beer cheese was delicious. It was creamy with kind of a ricotta texture. It was cheddary with a hint of spice to it. So good with the bread.As for the main meal, I got the NY Cheddar Grilled Cheese. Just as delicious. The bread was again beautifully buttered and toasted. Soft with a crisp crunch on the outside. It contained a fried egg, cheddar, pork belly and kimchi. It all worked wonderfully with each other. So much of everything in every bite. It was a fat meal but so worth it. All of it was so cheap too. Eight bucks for the sandwich, seven bucks for the beer cheese. Cheapest meal I have had in the city in a while. Worth every cent and calorie.",15,6,9

They have a variety of games, including Jenga you can play and I've found the staff to be really pleasant and helpful if you don't know a lot about beer.

39,Samantha W.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,2,5.0,11/11/2017,"Earls beer and cheese is the epitome of the perfect neighborhood joint. It's small, dark, and has family seating that can turn even the strangest of strangers into your best friend. Not to be outdone by the vibe, the food and beer offerings are incredible.With a constant key rotation of local favorites like other half, Grimm, finback, threes, single cut, interboro (need I go on) the taps are always pouring the freshest and most delicious beers out there. This place even gets some cans from Alchemist every now and then if you're lucky. There's no reason to get anything but the beer, but if you want wine they've got a couple boxes they can pour for you.The food menu is a never rotating list of about 10 items you can choose from. They focus on doing what they do at the highest level and they nail it. My favorite is the pork taco, which I've literally dragged friends and family into Earls so they can experience this incredible dish. When people respond that it's ""the best taco that they've ever had"" I know I nailed the recommendation. The beer cheese is a classic, and other dishes like the kimchi grilled cheese with a fried egg and even the salad deliver with mountains of flavor.Earls beer and cheese is a must try.",,1,

Delicious, and definitely worth a try, but next time I'll probably go with a simple grilled cheese and dip in their awesome tomato soup. The soup has a slight kick - and is chunky.

Updated review","It's in the name and quite possibly the best beer cheese I've ever had. Don't let the exterior fool you, as you walk into the door you see a small area but keep walking, the back of Earls is where it's at! Small booths, large wood planked tables, huge tapestries and dim golden lighting really make this place a fun, neighborhood go to!",,,
46,Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",962,883,4893,5.0,12/16/2016,"We were supposed to come here a while ago for a going away get together for one of my husband's coworkers but instead, went to another bar. Some time after however, hubby called me because we luckily had similar schedules. We rolled up and found parking nearby. We ordered our food and drinks at the bar. They actually lead with the request that you make your order at the bar. There aren't any servers; all you have at your disposal is the bartender and a guy that occasionally brings food upstairs from the kitchen. We stayed true to the restaurant name and ordered a small Beer Cheese and Torpedo Sandwich. I was unsure of which beer I wanted but tried the Bloodline and a Maui Coconut Porter. Both were really good so I decided to take both. The beer cheese was served with thick, buttered toasted bread slices and a couple garlic cloves. I wasn't sure what to do with the cloves so I sliced them up, rubbed the raw garlic on the bread, put some garlic slices on and smeared some cheese over the whole shebang. It tasted great. Rustic cheesy goodness.We didn't order much off the menu but I would love to come back here for an after work drink and small plate session. Too bad hubbs changed jobs...",5,2,5
47,Inga S.,"Manhattan, NY",19,10,0,5.0,4/28/2018,"I have lived in the neighborhood for 6 years and this is my GO TO spot. I absolutely adore Earls. The waitstaff and owner are amazing. Everyone is so friendly and approachable, it's easy to go there solo and meet new people, or keep to yourself and it not feel odd. The sandwiches are all delicious - and the goat cheese Mac is a must have. If you have a sweet tooth, try the bread pudding. I love it and I typically don't like bread pudding! They rotate their beers on the regular and once something taps out, they rotate something new. They don't serve liquor and only have three wine options (red, white and rose). You have got to go if you have the chance. It's a great neighborhood spot! So lucky it's so close to me.",,,

Bar was empty and the bartender made it very clear she did not want to be present. Served us two beers to guess which was with and mixed up the food order. When we thought the confusion between beer cheese and a sandwich was cleared, ended up waiting an hour to find out the correct order was not placed. Very upsetting as I was planning my whole night to end up at this bar to have it ruined by incompetency.The fact that she made it clear the order was not put in was a slap in the face.",,1,

We went during brunch/lunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was no crowd. I would recommend coming during that time. The food and service is what left a lasting impression for me. I decided on the pork belly Sandwhich. DELICIOUS. It's jammed packed with pork belly a fried egg and cheese. So freaking good! My sister ordered the pot pie and she raved about it. The prices were super affordable too which made everything taste that much better. The selection of beer is pretty nice!

It was SO good. We started sharing the beer cheese. My friends are experienced Earl frequenters, and expertly explained the process: rub garlic on warm toast, spread cheese, eat, repeat. :) I recommend this process.Then, I shared the Ruben (which is apparently new on the menu) and the NY cheddar pork belly thing. I love, love, loved the Ruben, and was too full after to fully appreciate the ridiculously large portion of the pork belly grilled cheese.

The beer cheese is not to be missed. The mac and cheese is quite good - though more creamy than cheesy, perhaps. The Cuban Reuben is one of the best sandwiches I've had -- braised beef, cheese, and vinegary slaw -- all on buttery, perfectly toasted bread.

Got drinks and a large beer cheese and left buzzed and happy. The second time I went was on a random weekday afternoon. There were maybe 6 other people there and a couple of us wanted a study break. We got the small beer cheese, which can easily be shared between 2 people and was even able to get some studying done there. While I haven't gotten any of the actual food, it looked really good from what I saw. The beer cheese is so garlic-ey and on top of that it comes with fresh garlic on the side.

It's even better than the real thing!I ate at a lot of restaurants that are more well-known and expensive during my trip in NYC, but I liked this hole-in-the-wall the most.

Earl's Beer & Cheese, located in a hole-in-the-wall on the Upper East Side, knows exactly what it wants to be - a hip bar with comfort food for locals. The space is small, only seating two dozen people comfortably, with a rustic simple decor. When we dropped by on a Saturday night the place was packed with young people playing board games supplied by the bar. It all starts with the beers, which is exclusively microbrews from all over the country. This Pennsylvanian for example was able to enjoy a Neshaminy Brewing Company beer during my visit. The food here too is also magnificent in its perceived simplicity. In came the name didn't give it away, they specialized in grilled cheese, but also offer some sandwiches and tacos, with unique and fresh ingredients that turn the dishes on their collective heads in the best way possible. My favorite of the food was actually the Cuban Reuben ($10) - juicy braised pork shoulder, homemade pickled vegetables and peppers, mouth watering beer cheese mustard, topped with Swiss cheese on toasted marbled rye. It was excellent and was a step up from your typical bar fare. I adored Earl's Beer & Cheese, and not only because they had PA beers. The food is stellar, the atmosphere is inviting, and it feels like an authentic locals bar without trying too hard. Definitely worth a visit.",1,,1

Aside from all this though, the bartender was one of the friendliest I've ever encountered and did not hesitate to give me samples of all three beers I was considering when I made my first order (of course I'd go on to order all three as the evening progressed..). Which brings me to the beers! They only had six or so on tap but they were all great choices so it was more a matter of the order to drink them in rather than which to get.

Work was going to be pretty chill today, and heck, it's Friday, so why not? The place is pretty small, use Google maps to find your way there because there's no big sign indicating its existence. There's one counter-top by the windows for 3 people, a long table that looks like it used to be a bowling lane, and the bar area by the cashier that seats 3 people.It was our first time there, so we ordered what other Yelpers suggested, the NY State Cheddar grilled cheese. I had heard that it has pork belly in it, so imagine my surprise when I found that it also comes with a fried egg and kimchi. Kimchi of all things! I'm Korean and haven't had kimchi in forever, so it was a fantastic surprise. The pork is a little salty, but overall the sandwich was pretty bomb. And it only cost $8. For all of that, plus a side of potato chips, to cost only $8 in NYC, it's a great deal. We are definitely coming here again, next time to try their other grilled cheeses as well.

It's cozy and casual, and has a great menu of beer and food listings. Regardless of when I go, the staff is always beyond friendly and so helpful in offering drink selections. I would say the only downfall is the smaller size of the space - unless you're lucky with your timing, this place isn't super conducive with drinking in large groups.

They have a unique selection of beers. I have tried their nitro Old Chub, which I would recommend if you see it on their menu! We ordered their beer cheese which was pretty delicious. The beer cheese had the hint of the lager and paired well with the thick cut bread. I wish the bread was a tiny bit less oily, but I like that it's toasty. The shredded pork in a scallion pancake is a different option that was quite tasty. It was a bit spicy and paired well with the lime, queso fresco, and crunchy radishes. It was huge so could definitely be split or when you have a healthy appetite! The Gorgonzola grilled cheese was lackluster. For $8 it wasn't really worth it. It was sweet and salty.

The only reason this place gets positive reviews is because it's in a part of town that has few other nightlife options.The Upper East Side (actually this is East Harlem but I'll humor the folks that think they live in the UES) is a place that's hard to find quality, affordable options for 20-something's to hang out. You're likely to only find Murray Hill style college bars and pretentious options near here so this seems like a logical in between, right?Wrong. It's overpriced and underperforming. At upwards of $8 for a grilled cheese I'm wondering why I don't go to the corner store to buy a 1/4 pound of cheese and a package of buns and grill up my own concoction. It's not a ""meal"", it's something you eat when you drink. It's drunk food. You eat it because the beer makes you hungry, then the beer clouds your judgement. You could eat Tupperware and it would taste good if you're drunk. Not worth the money. The beer is $7 at minimum, and for that you can get yourself a 6-pack at any corner store. In short, you'll spend $20 on a small, subpar sandwich and a beer. Stay home. Go downtown. Do whatever. But don't pretend that this is some incredible place.

It was our first time so we had to order almost everything.  NY style grilled cheese - actually our least favorite item.  Don't get me wrong, it was good but I barely tasted the cheese so if that's what ours in the mood for, this may not be the one.  The butter toasted made the dish.  I wish they sell the bread to go.The Earls Taco - a must order.  Using scallion pancake as the base is such a brilliant idea.  I couldn't really see what's inside but I remembered savoring every bite.Spicy tomato soup - great complement to everything else.  I dunked and dipped the bread, chips and taco into the soup.  The bread pudding - served piping hot, it really got me into the holiday mood.

Transit nerd pro-tip: If you wait to watch a southbound train go by, you can wave to the conductor, and he'll most likely wave back! I was way too excited about this interchange.So the latest big news is that they have EXPANDED! This tremendously popular place is no longer the size of a thimble. There is now an open back room with I think 5 more large tables, so I no longer have to restrict my visits to summer off-hours.I've tried a few things on the creative menu, but have settled on the mac and cheese, which always allures with its creamy decadence and sprinkles of rosemary. I also like Earl's Taco, which combines slow cooked meat with flecks of Mexican cheese, a cabbage slaw, and a delicious hot sauce. The taco comes on a scallion pancake, which I think is brilliant, and lends a uniquely satisfying texture and thickness to the dish.There are a lot of faux-hipster/creative/foodie restaurants (Supply House, I'm looking at you) on the Upper East Side that don't deliver, and are merely trying to cash in on a trend, but Earl's Beer and Cheese is the real deal.",9,9,9

Everytime I took a bite of beer cheese I was mesmerized,Omigod, you guys, omigod.This is a small hole in the wall that is simply amazing. Hidden in the border of the Upper East Side/ East Harlem, its totally worth the trek. There is no waitress service here, you order at the bar. I really enjoyed drinking my cider as well as Ithaca Wheat Apricot Beer. Plus points for having Ithaca Wheat- it has subtle hints of apricot, making it fruity and girly. For guys, there are IPAs here. You must order the beer cheese. Not ordering beer cheese is blasphemy. You will get a number and you can place it on your table, someone will bring it out to you. There are 2 sizes for beer cheese, normal and jumbo. Normal is enough for 2 people. It was so good, I wish I could have the jumbo to myself.This is how you eat it: Take a slice of thick crispy bread. Rub the garlic on to your bread. Spread some delicious beer cheese and indulge. I didn't know what to do with the garlic at first, I assumed you were supposed to chop it up into pieces and put it on your bread, thankfully my friend was smart enough to figure out that you were supposed to rub the garlic on the bread. The beer cheese tastes like sharp cheddar, and does not really taste strongly of beer. You can even do take out, which I think I might. Take out will cost you an extra dollar.They have also sandwiches and tacos here, which I heard were pretty good. Can't wait to come back. Omigod, Earl's Beer and Cheese is simply... life changing!",1,2,

The grilled cheese was super unique, containing miso mayo, pickles, and potato chips on an English muffin. I don't even like mayo or pickles, but decided to be adventurous and found the result of this odd combo to be quite tasty. My friend ordered the mac and cheese, and said it was good as well. The vibe is very Brooklyn or LES despite it's Harlem/UES location. Prices are super cheap with all of the food items around $10 or less. I recommend checking out if you are in the area!",,,

Now don't get me wrong, Just a stop or two down the 6, and I am in the glory of bars that is Yorkville, but there is really nothing like a truly local bar that you can walk to from your apartment. I thought for sure Earls would be our go to, but sadly it I don't think this will be it. Like I said, high hopes were had walking into this place. to hold a solid rating with that many reviews is usually a great sign; we grabbed a seat at the tiny bar (which I dug, it was awesome seeing two people get that much work done in such a small space), and perused the drink menu. I will say that the tap selection was on point, they have a rotating line up that is small but full of craft beers (you're not getting miler here, and that is A-OK). I had an Evil Twin Molotov Cocktail on tap which wasn't bad, but I thought I would move over into the can selection. This is where things started to get a little dicey for me; the can selection again was thorough, but there was nothing really...well all that good on offer. I had a Newburgh Brewing Cream Ale, which ran around 7$ (I get it, NYC rent is high), but was truly awful. Were that it, this place would probably get a higher rating, the food is outrageously decadent looking, and they have a decent enough vibe going on; country bar meets city, with a heavy hospital bar feel...seriously if you described this to me before going in, I would definitely say it's a place in my wheelhouse, which is all the more upsetting - I should love this place....tears. I think the thing that really pushed this place over the edge though was the wine. ""Earls beer and cheese"", yep I get it, who orders wine at a place like this? My girlfriend, who didn't really want beer, so she made the fateful decision to order a glass of wine... that came out of a box. No bueno. Look if you want to be a pure beer place, do it up, it's working really really well for other places in the city (ABC Beer Co, looking at you). BUT if you're going to offer a product, make sure it's halfway decent (..at minimum), because that wine? Eww. Sorry guys, the beer I had was nothing that special, the wine was atrocious and the whole affair was pretty overpriced for the neighborhood. Amazing staff, great vibe but my new neighborhood bar? I think not.",14,11,13
133,Lu H.,"New York, NY",1217,408,1956,4.0,2/11/2015,"Six of us were lucky enough to score seats around the one small communal table (max seating eight or ten rather small individuals).  Post rock climbing at Steep Rock, we were starving and it was rainy and there were fewer things that could have brought more joy and anticipation than the warmth, gooeyness, flavor, satisfaction (and more) promised by the fare at Earl's Beer & Cheese.Almost everyone went with the NY State Cheddar Grilled Cheese.  Read the ingredients: Pork belly, kimchi, fried egg on sourdough.  Can you manage to go wrong with this?  Lest you are vegetarian, the combination of juicy pork belly and kimchi is nearly irresistible.  I only resisted because I knew I could try someone else's grilled cheese, and curiosity is a powerful motivator.  Earl's taco utilizes scallion pancake as the ""taco shell"", and is stuffed with braised pork shoulder, queso fresco, and a combination of Asian-style vegetables including cabbage and radish.  I might have also gotten the tomato soup, because after two plus hours of climbing, I genuinely felt as though I could have eaten the world.  Impossible to regret my decision, or any decision made here.  The bite of grilled cheese that I tried, with flavorful savory bits of pork belly, was absolutely delicious.  Could I have eaten a whole grilled cheese?  Actually doubtful.  The bread slices were thick and soaked in butter (or perhaps just pork belly juices).   This is not a problem, except from the perspective of finishing the thing.  Did I mention it comes with chips?  My taco may have won the grilled-cheese lovers over.  Each bite was surprisingly complex -- savory, sweet, hint of tangy.  Texture in each bite, and the scallion pancake shell was nothing short of genius.  It was fairly large and dense, more than enough for me to share bites with everyone.  The bread pudding was, in fact, stupid good.  As difficult as it was to face a hearty, warm dessert after such a satisfying meal, we found the courage to do so and shared two orders.  Far more moist than your usual bread pudding, this was served in a very hot cast iron baby skillet, which kept it warm for the several minutes it took to dig in.  There were chunks of fruit throughout and fresh cream atop the bread pudding.  Decadent, rich, fulfilling.  All things you might want from life, in this little skillet.  A delightfully gluttonous meal in which we replenished all calories spent climbing walls.  I hope to be back soon.",7,5,5

The sourness of the kimchi really balanced out the saltiness of the pork belly and cheese. Get this one to share because it's a big portion.

This aptly named sandwich features decadent pork belly + kim chi + fried egg + cheddar between the best possible grilled pieces of thick toast. To. die. for. The bread pudding here is absolute perfection. Dining here without trying their bread pudding would be an abysmal tragedy of meteoric proportions. I have been dreaming about this bread pudding twice a day ever since trying it. The marriage of flavors, the texture contrast of the chewy/crispy crust on the soft bread pieces, the slight amount of melty whipped cream, I can go on forever, but it's better if you just try it for yourself. Seriously, do your taste buds a favor and get the bread pudding if you know what's good for you. I finished the entire NY State cheddar sandwich and half a bread pudding without any feelings of impending food coma, so the sizing is just right.Their selection of craft beers on tap changes daily, what more could you want? tl,dr: if ever in the upper east side, stop by Earl's and get the NY State Cheddar Grilled Cheese + Bread Pudding if you want to know what happiness is.",1,1,1

161,Joe K.,"Manhattan, NY",13,80,89,5.0,7/18/2014,"Okay, full disclosure, I'm having a period of doubt regarding whether or not certain types of Yelp reviews should be written, or even read. I'm cool with reviews of static entities, things that are what they are and don't materially change. A museum or an art exhibit? Have at it. A one-time happening, like Simon & Garfunkel playing Central Park? Perfect.But what about entities that change? No two performances of a play are the same. No two trips to the Highline are the same. No two meals at a restaurant are the same. Is it accurate or fair to give a restaurant a star rating that will live forever in hyperspace based on a fleeting impression? Shouldn't the reviewer make a dozen or so trips to the place under consideration before their opinion is considered validly formed?The answer is yes, all that is true. But I just had a sandwich at Earl's Beer & Cheese that blew my mind. It's called the New York Cheddar. And my mind is blown.I was in the area, thinking about maybe stopping at Dough Loco, when I passed Earl's and decided to check it out instead. Because I hadn't planned on this stop, I wasn't sure what I should be ordering. And their menu, written on a chalkboard that towers over the single, large communal table, is a wee bit confusing. So I settled on the New York Cheddar (all the sandwiches seem to be named after the type of cheese they contain). Pork-belly, fried-egg, the eponymous cheddar, and kimchee. Can't go wrong with that.Or can you? Because after I placed my to-go order, I started to think, ""What have I done? What type of idiot orders a sandwich with melted cheese and a fried-egg to take out? This is going to be a disaster.""But it wasn't a disaster. After a 15 minute wait that I spent watching their TV (tuned to ESPN with the sound off), the counter guy handed me a nicely packed cardboard box containing my sandwich. When I opened that box  20 minutes later, inside I found my New York Cheddar, still warm, wrapped in heavy paper and resting serenely on a small pile of potato chips. It was pristine. And delicious.Since I've itemized the interior of the sandwich above, let's focus for a moment on the exterior.  It was a high-quality white bread, lightly toasted, more than up to the task of containing the goodness inside.Did I mention that the sandwich was delicious?So, where I'm at right now is, I'm thinking that after I have about a dozen more of these bad boys, I'm going to have something to say about them.

Arriving there, the space itself is very tiny but cute! There wasn't a lot of seating and this was at 6:30pm on a Wednesday night. Luckily, when my friend arrived, we snagged two stools at the bar and were pretty comfortable. I ordered the NY State Cheddar Grilled Cheese, my friend ordered the Calabro Mozzarella, and we decided to share the bread pudding. I thought the NY State was alright - a lot of pork belly, which is great for meat lovers, but in my opinion it overpowered the kimchi and the actual cheese in the sandwich, so I wasn't extremely impressed. My friend thought the Calabro was alright as well, nothing too special (kinda wished I took a bite of hers). The bread pudding was good but SO SWEET. I personally do not have a huge sweet tooth so this was not the dessert for me but for everyone who loves their sweets, you will love this. Overall, for the distance I had to travel to get there and whatnot, I wouldn't come here too often but if I'm around the area, I would love to stop by and try another grilled cheese and the tomato soup!",,,

If this isn't a gem in this neighborhood (or in NYC), I don't know what is. Beer cheese. Toasty bread, soft cheese, and 2 garlic cloves. Uhh... what do we do with these raw garlic cloves? WE RUB THEM ON OUR BREAD, SON. Ingenious. Just ingenious. Pulled pork taco with scallion pancakes. I never really liked pulled pork, but when it's full of fat and flavor, I'm game. With the crispy scallion pancake on the bottom, it just worked. Cilantro and lime on pork. How perfect can life be? Oh, by the way, they are NOT closed on Thursdays. And yes, I ran home to write this review.***3/9/12 (next day)Damn right I went back the next day. Pork belly sammich with kimchi and fried egg. As good as what I had yesterday. Golden egg yolk sipping into toasty bread and salty pork belly. I never liked kimchi but it added just the right kick to this. I've been spreading the word to strangers I see on the streets and at work. This is serious.",18,25,16
167,Anthony F.,"Miami, FL",1,2,0,5.0,4/16/2016,"Earl's Beer & Cheese.It has beer. It has cheese. It has beer cheese.The atmosphere is really chill and laid back. The bartenders have always been nothing but nice to my friends and I, which is a plus because in order to order food you have to go to the bar. There's a back section with more tables. There are board games you can take and play with your friends. Do it, because drunk Jenga and drunk Guess Who is awesome.The beer is decently-priced craft beer, but the food is what makes it special. Good portions, good prices, and definitely lots of cheese. It's really a pretty small amount of money for the sheer amount of really good quality of food you're getting. If you gotta get something, though, get an order of the beer cheese. It's unbelievable. You really can't go wrong with any of the food, though. Everything I've tried here has been top-notch.",,,
168,Yani I.,"New York, NY",204,100,240,4.0,1/31/2016,"Now the place is even better since its expanded. I do miss the cool bar and doughnut place next door, but Earl's still has a very chill and feel good ambiance. It's self service, you order at the counter and pay at the counter when you leave. No frills, hipster kind of vibe that does have some funky stuff on its menu like the Bloody Beer during brunch which was a little too much to acquire to. The Beer Cheese was excellent, but then again anything with cheese is great. I had the Huevos Rancheros which was pretty good. It's a nice neighborhood place to hang out at that also serves up seasonal drafts that are nice to enjoy while catching up with friends. Go by all means. It's like Williamsburg in Upper Eastside, plus he L train won't be in service anymore so this is a good alternative if you need a hipster fix.",,,
169,Caroline T.,"Brisbane, Australia",2,50,24,4.0,1/8/2016,"Great local beer and grilled cheese bar tucked away on the upper east side. It has a great casual atmosphere and is a perfect pit stop when you fancy a comforting grilled cheese, especially in the cooler weather.The New York State cheddar ($8) includes pork belly and Kimchi - delicious! Beer cheese is good as well. Nice little selection of beers. It's all very well priced for New York.Happy to have this place as my local!",,,
170,Justin C.,"New York, NY",117,451,87,2.0,7/23/2014,"Meh, I really don't see what all the buzz is about this place.  I was around the block, and a few times said to myself, hm, should check out this place, amazing reviews, photos of what looks like good food, and cheese and beer, what can go wrong...Me and my sister both ordered the NY State Cheddar Grilled Cheese, and shared an order of the mac & cheese.  First off, it was lunch, and only 5 other people in the place, so it was not busy.  Minimal amount of pork belly on the grilled cheese, significantly more kimchi then pork belly.  I must compliment the bread and perfect amount of time they took to toast the bread though, perfect.  The grilled cheese itself, meh, nothing to write home about, in the words of Jim Carey ""i've had better""...The mac and cheese, wow, left a LOT to be desired...  We didn't even get halfway through it.  It just wasn't very good, the goat cheese was congealing quickly, the shells were nice and al dente at least.Meh, not worth the wait (for dinner), or hassle.  Go elsewhere..",1,,
171,Derek B.,"Auburn, AL",191,540,239,5.0,6/10/2012,"Read about this place in a magazine a year or two ago and had been meaning to try it ever since.  Finally got around to trying it combining it with a trip to the top of the Met to check out the summer display.  Beer Cheese - Yum, this is a great concept.  Kind of like a beery pimento cheese spread. Delicious toasted bread and garlic to go with it (try it with the garlic on the bread and without, both ways are great).  Sandwiches were great.  NY cheddar with pork belly and kimchi was an awesome combo, as was the mozz and pickles.  Bread pudding is unique and delicious.  Very french toast tasting to me.  Awesome beers at reasonable prices as well. Wish I tried this place earlier!",1,,1
172,David B.,"Pine Bush, NY",56,12,29,5.0,3/7/2016,"Great place awesome menu of sandwiches , I love the Gorgonzola - fig ginger preserve, potato crunch on a brioche. Great IPA's",,,
173,Alex Z.,"State College, PA",359,45,7,4.0,1/4/2016,"Came here on a weekday to catch up with old friends, and found the place to be pretty good (and crowded). Overall it was a nice place, if a little tucked away and small.Pros: drinkable house wine, great beer cheese, cozy and warm atmosphere, generally good food (grilled cheeses especially).Cons: A little too small: there isn't a lot of space sometimes and one of the booths is actually partially blocked by a pipe. The beer selection, while adequate, wasn't very large.",,,
174,Jacquelyn Marie R.,"Manhattan, NY",383,57,7,5.0,9/24/2015,They have cheap food for such a great quality! I had the salad with half a buffalo chicken sandwich and some goat cheese Mac and cheese. Ugh so great and so affordable! Definitely go if you're in the area!,1,,
175,HY K.,"Sunnyside, NY",7,61,0,4.0,1/4/2016,"This place has yummy food. I speak for the kimchi grilled cheese with pork belly and egg served with chips and the beer cheese. It's an oily messy ooey goodness. But the kind you can only handle once in awhile. The bread accompanying the beer cheese spread is rather oily though... While supremely satisfying, the whole thing was so rich and heavy that with each step I took I felt like the oil and fat I consumed was sloshing around my stomach. You have to order from the bar and while the bartender wasn't rude or anything, she wasn't exactly welcoming either. This is worthwhile to try, come hungry and prepare to leave feeling full from it's rich rich food.",,,
176,Han C.,"New York, NY",151,397,80,4.0,10/18/2014,"The Earl knows what the people want, and what the people want is beer and cheese.  The East Harlem location is a cozy one - everyone's elbows in each other's backs as everyone tries to sink their teeth into brilliantly grilled cheeses.  It's not for those who need lots of personal space, but perfect for anyone else who appreciates the ultimate couple: grilled cheese + tomato soup.  The sandwiches are delicious.  The fried egg + lightly spiced kimchee + crisped pork belly + cheddar is a dream. The bread is inches thick!  Your teeth will be completely enveloped in crunch and flavor with each bite.  You think it couldn't possibly get better, but it can !   The tomato soup here is lightly warmed, creamy and flecked with spicy bits of ginger.  and you need to dunk every sandwich into that soup like your life depended on it, and you'll feel born again.  Rejuvenated with each spicy bite - savory, cheesy, meaty, eggy - beauty!  We had the mozzarella + potato chips + pickles + fig jam sandwich which is slightly sweet and plenty lovely too.  And then when you finish all that, dunk every potato chip into that soup, and find complete happiness.",,,
177,Sarina S.,"Brooklyn, NY",78,266,300,4.0,10/16/2014,"It's small, crowded and dingy...but the food is fantastic! Must try the beer cheese, mac and cheese, and pork belly sandwich if you're in the mood for some greasy meaty and tasty. Only been there thurs/fri nights and there's usually a wait to sit or order take out. But definitely worth the wait!",,,
178,Maddy G.,"Omaha, NE",245,252,856,4.0,10/14/2014,"I first of all love the idea of a whole restaurant based on beer and cheese. My dining partner had to run to a nearby pharmacy for some lactose in order to indulge but he said it was worth it. The kimchee fried egg and pork belly sandwich is the way to go, washed down with some Octoberfest beer. The atmosphere is great for a casual sit down meal as are the prices ($8/sandwich). Perfect way to pregame a museum date.",,,
179,Ben W.,"New York, NY",514,772,435,4.0,5/20/2014,"Beer and cheese aka heavy drink and food.Even though I moved to East Harlem almost 9 months ago, Earl's has been on my list from the start and last week was my first visit to this neighborhood spot. The restaurant itself is TINY, seating for only maybe 15 people in a narrow space, but luckily Wednesday nights aren't too busy.Their menu is a combination of sandwiches, soups, small bites, and macaroni, all with one thing in common: cheese. You place an order at the counter and when we placed ours, asking if it was enough food for two people, she replied, ""MORE than enough."" She wasn't kidding.For starters we got the namesake beer cheese. Served with 6-7 thick slices of buttered toast, the beer cheese was an interesting combination of flavors. First, you take cloves of garlic and rub it onto the bread before the spread. The rough texture almost grates the garlic and adds an explosive element to the appetizer. The spread itself was tasty. I wouldn't say exceptional, but in combination with the garlic and bread, made for a great starter. Some bites were a little bitter (could've been because of the beer) and a few slices' crust were so hard I had to eat around them, but no other complaints.The NY cheddar grilled cheese was so good and definitely the best value of the meal. Served on thick,""Texas Toast"" style bread, thick slices of yellow cheddar was melted with some pork belly, kimchi, and fried egg, giving a Korean flair to the American classic. I thought the bread was a perfect fit for the flavors and the pork belly was surprisingly tasty for what it was. I wished for more kimchi: the juices had soaked into the bread and I wanted just a little more of that stinky, fermented flavor. The fried egg was clutch and when we sliced the egg, spilling the yolk over everything, it created gooey perfection. Even the pork belly was well-made, not too dry and not too fatty.The mac & cheese was the bf's least favorite dish but it did all right by me. The rosemary was definitely the deciding factor. It gave it a fragrant, floral aftertaste that added depth. Without it, I would've been bored with the dish in two bites. I might make mac & cheese with goat cheese myself now because it added substance to that stinky, goat's milk flavor (some) of us love. The pasta was al dente and a solid course to round off our meal.On to the beer, their draft and can selections are notable for their variety and prices. Almost all the beer and wine was $7 each. The server/bartender/busser gave some great suggestions when I was selecting my first and second beers. The bf got a glass of wine big enough for two servings and my Allagash Dubbel and Phoenix Pale Ale was served chilled in a stein.Overall the experience was refreshing and I'm glad I finally visited this neighborhood spot. The fare is on the heavier end, so I definitely won't come on a regular basis for the food. However, Earl's will definitely be a place I take friends if we're going out in the area or as a pregame before heading downtown.",1,,
180,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,5.0,10/10/2011,"It's about time that the far Upper East Side where East Harlem meets starts getting spots like this that you would normally find only downtown. Earl's Beer & Cheese is located in a pretty vacant stretch along Park Ave and 97th where the train overpass meets the tunnel underground. Not much of a view but who cares when all you need to look at are your terrific beers and wonderful cheese plates.As others here have mentioned the place is insanely tiny. Personally, that does not bother me as long as I can grab a seat or spot to enjoy my brew. For others I can see where they would become claustrophobic quickly. When we arrived here around 6PM on Saturday there were only around eight people there, but by 7PM  I had counted around 25 and it was jammed packed. This place has become popular very quickly in this neck of the woods, and for good reason.Basically, it is one long communal table that seats 8-10 people. A small counter with a few stools looks out the front, and there is another narrow counter along the wall to stand at. Really, before we left a few hours later there still must have been close to 25 people in there and it was rocking. They were playing a cool mix of 80's rock and I remember hearing The Cars and The Police playing a lot. Also, it can get a bit warm in here but they had the whole front open letting in a nice evening breeze. The place resembles a faux hunting lodge with mounted deer heads on the walls, murals of deer in the woods, and a bathroom that looks like you are in a wooden shed. The menu features some creative takes on cheese. We had the Beer Cheese which was terrific. Comes in basket of bread that is presented as toast points buttered on each side. So airy and crispy. You get a good amount of spreadable cheddar beer cheese, and a tin with garlic cloves too. Yummy, yum, yum!Mmmmm......Beer Cheese. Just thinking about it is making me drool.There are other plates such as a cheese board, grilled cheese sandwiches, Asian Gnocchi & Beef, Mac & Cheese, a gourmet Eggo waffle with foie gras, cheddar, and coffee-cured bacon, among a few other items to choose from. From what we tried, and talking to the people around us eating, everything here is on-point. Just order at the bar and the staff will bring it over to you. Accepts credit cards too and everything here is pretty cheap overall. Can I mention the beer selection? I was pleasantly surprised at the craft beer options on tap and in cans. Draft beers served in glass mugs go for $5 - $6, and canned beers run $3-$8. They even have Growlers To Go  - $19 Refills / $4 for a Growler. The four line beer selection rotates and they bring in different brews constantly. Autumnation in cans, Victory Pilsner on tap, and Troegs Stout on tap were just a few that we enjoyed. They pair exceptionally well with the cheese plate selections here.Personally, I love a small place like this that serves the local community. Saw a mix of younger newbies and older stalwarts of the area in here. There was even a group of older ladies visiting from Poland that came in to down a few pints next to us and then head out. It was too funny. Again, this small place is probably not for everyone, especially if you can't deal with crowds and being squished next to other patrons. I guess it also depends on what time you go as I heard that right after work hours / early evening is very busy. Still, this has become a new favorite of mine in my hood. So glad it is not downtown or in Brooklyn, as it is only a few minutes walk from where I live. Easy access for me to go and try out some more wonderful cheese concoctions and thirst quenching tasty beers.",27,15,27
181,Ashley P.,"Bronx, NY",2,14,0,3.0,7/6/2016,"The place is a hole in the wall. Initially it doesn't look big when you first walk in but towards the back there's more seating. However, it is tight. The food was fine. They didn't have much variety in beer for happy hour. My co-workers raved about the bread pudding and the mac & cheese. I had the NY State Cheddar. I didn't like it. If Kimchi is your thing you'll love it. Overall, this place was just okay.",2,,
182,Parthvi P.,"Houston, TX",0,24,0,2.0,9/22/2016,"This is a cute little place, but there menu is small. I wanted to try their New York cheese sandwich and I wanted to substitute something from the sandwich and they said they cant do it. Why can you substitute something from the sandwich? I dunno, whatever. We ended up ordering the beer cheese which is just okay. They said it comes with garlic, and its a full garlic which is tasteless. You have to sit there and cut it into bit pieces to eat the garlic. Its not a spread or minced. Then, we also ordered Mac and cheese, and so disappointed. The pasta wasn't cooked all the way and it was very hard to chew and also very dry.",,,1
183,Christopher R.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",110,38,99,4.0,12/6/2013,"Good beer, good cheese, what more does one need!?Hidden on Park and 97th is this little gem of a place. Earl's Beer & Cheese is no misnomer, the dishes are simple, creative, and very tasty and the people are really chill. I ate here on a Wednesday night with some friends, and this place was packed with people, which is a great sign of good food to come.The Food: Simple concept, but executed in such a way that it feels like fancy southern comfort food... With a twist of course. We orders the NY State Cheddar($8): fried egg, kimchi, pork belly, melted cheddar all sandwiched in between two thick slices of French bread well seasoned with garlic and oil (think deep fried, thick, and chewy/crunch bread... SO GOOD). Our group also ordered the Earl Taco ($11): a fried sesame taco shell with braised pork shoulder, cabbage, cilantro, and queso fresco, I didn't try any but now I regret it. It was HUGE and it looked so juicy and good. I would definitely try it next time. Our group also shared an order of beer cheese ($12, jumbo size) - again, thick juicy bread with cloves of garlic and cheddar cream on the side. ON POINT. The only caveat I have with the sandwich was the pork itself could have been a little more robust, but it was still really good!The drinks: several good flavored beers. I highly recommend the Pumpking beer, I usually don't like pumpkin beers, but this one was so good!The ambience: dark, small and bar like. The place can get a little cramped for seating. There is one large communal table and one main counter top... Trust me that it all works out. The service: not the fastest, but definitely well worth the small wait. It was one man who was taking orders and drafting beers for everybody, but again not that many people can fit inside. Overall very scrumptious and enjoyable, and somewhere I'd indefinitely recommend to friends and a place I'm coming back to a few more times.",2,,1
184,Swing R.,"Bayport, NY",3,22,0,5.0,12/29/2016,"An outstanding place for great grub. The cheese is wonderful. The tap beer selection could be improved. Not everyone likes the IPAs, some of us prefer flavor with Porters and Stouts.",,,
185,Essy S.,"New York, NY",11,81,7,5.0,8/12/2015,"OMG! What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said??Earl's beer and cheese was awesome, the BF and I ordered 3 different things off the menu - the Beer Cheese, the Foie Gras taco and the Bread Pudding -- and we savored every crumb.We already plan to go back in the immediate future to sample the rest of the menu. 5 stars because Yelp couldn't have said it any better : Woohoo! As good as it gets!",,1,1
186,Vanessa F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,20,51,5.0,1/11/2017,"I love this place. We go here as a post-volleyball game spot and it always makes my night. I agree with other comments about the service: it can be difficult to place your order given you have to go to the bar, and if the bar is full, it's hard to squeeze in to place your order while staying out of the way. However, the bartender/manager is great and the staff aims to please. They are down-to-earth and accommodating. Every time I go, I get the tacos and an IPA (the taco comes in a scallion pancake as the shell - amazing and creative). The atmosphere is also nice - dim lights and an eclectic group of people from those playing jenga to date night, to sports fans.",,,
187,Jon S.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,647,1,5.0,1/2/2014,"My first love here was the taco, which is essentially a pajeon burrito. This is a gut buster - I mean, pajeon is a meal unto itself and here's just a replacement for a tortilla. It's bold and something that brought me back several times, but four years into a love affair, I'm here to say it's not the only reason to come. If anything, I've started steering people away from the taco. It is a just a bit too heavy to recommend - that pancake perhaps should be a little thinner, or there should be a hotter sauce to help sop up the weight of this thing. Also, the taco is probably the furthest thing on the menu away from cheese. Yes, there is queso fresco, but it is the fourth or fifth most dominant place in the dish. Go for the cheddar grilled cheese, which also brings serious Korean influences with the pork belly and kimchi, but leaves room for a sharp dairy kick. If not hungry (or very hungry and in need of an appetizer, tack on the freshly made and excellent beer cheese). The taco may suck up the attention - and stand out the most when trying to order - but the menu makes no wrong foot. Earl's is tiny enough that one large party can fill the place, so I never come here anything larger than a party of four. Otherwise, you may trek up to 98th street and find it impossible to eat cheese for an hour or more.",1,,1
188,Jessica H.,"Austin, TX",80,120,199,4.0,12/18/2013,"This place is the bomb! It's tiny so beware I'd you have a big group. They have beer and wine but the real draw is the food!I had the spicy tomato basil soup which was delicious and is served with a large piece of homemade bread.The Mac n cheese is made with goat cheese and is creamy and amazing.The earls taco has a pancake like tortilla that is sinfully good. The innards are delicious too (pork, slaw, and yum)I can't wait to come back and get some of the grilled cheeses!",1,1,1
189,Ron H.,"Ithaca, NY",22,24,1,4.0,5/10/2016,"We enjoyed both the NY Cheddar sandwich (grilled cheese with pork belly, kim chee, and fried egg) and the beer cheese plate (very garlicy spreadable cheese). Both beers we ordered were tasty -- a flavorful Lagunitas Aunt Sally Wild Ale and a smooth Neshaminy Creek Cream Ale -- and the bartender who took our order was very friendly and even switched the tv to the Kentucky Derby for us for a bit so we could watch the race.",2,,1

191,Helen D.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",75,254,168,3.0,6/12/2014,"I have no idea how I walked past this place for THREE YEARS without noticing its presence. Better late than never I guess. I came by during my lunch break, and the first thing I noticed was how tiny the place was; I can't imagine what it's like during dinnertime.I asked for a recommendation and both workers suggested the NYS Cheddar grilled cheese (pork belly, kimchi, fried egg, cheese, thick bread). It was certainly the most interesting grilled cheese I've ever eaten. I'm not a huge fan of pork belly so I didn't really like it. It tasted fine and I'm sure people who love pork belly would have raved about this one, but I'll pass for next time. The meat was a big slab that fell out when I took a bite, and it was too chewy for my liking. The bread was also too thick and hard so I couldn't get a bite of the whole thing. I craved a beer but alas I was only on lunch break... It would be frowned upon if I went back to work smelling like alcohol.Even though my arteries were protesting after lunch, I would want to come again to try the other things on the menu.",,,

195,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",143,726,51,4.0,8/5/2016,"This turned out to be a pretty cool spot. I guess they haven't always had the back area but it seems like they have a decent bit of room now. On a Friday night we didn't have any trouble finding a table. The tap selection is small (8 beers I think) but varied and you can almost certainly find something new and exciting. I had a Jack's Abby Brewing Smoke & Dagger Rauchbier ($7) which I though was super tasty. My friends and I split some a jumbo beer cheese which is definitely enough to satisfy 4. It was a pretty tasty and a little spicy and overall very good. One of my friends went for a mozzarella grilled cheese and was disappointed, it was served on an english muffin and looked a little lacking/lame from where I was sitting. He also got a tomato soup which he raved about and the spoon I had was pretty tasty. The bar isn't huge but you shouldn't have any issues with a group of 4, anything more and you'll have to hope one of the longer tables is open which can easily seat 8. Service was friendly and I have no complaints about the bartender. Earl's is definitely one of the better bars in the area and one I'll keep in mind in the future.",,,

Updated review","Had a really tough day at work and all I wanted to do was get some good food and some beer and wine. Came here and walked up to the bar, and was  ignored by a bartender with short curly brown hair. So I walked around to get someone else to help me. Finally got some attention and ordered, hoping for a better experience. Once we get our food we ask for two forks. The curly haired girl said sure and walked away, and went back to the bar. And again completely ignored us and continued to bartend. It was very awkward and uncomfortable, I ended up having to return back to the bar to ask the blonde bartender for the fork. Won't be returning. Food is good but service ruined it",,,
197,Ed L.,"BOWLING GREEN, NY",0,24,15,5.0,7/3/2015,"This review is just for the cheddar,  pork belly,  kimchi and egg on sourdough.   Fantastic!   The gooey richness of the perfectly browned bread and cheese is supplemented by the rich egg yolk.   The pork belly was a good combination of fat and lean adding meatiness  and tender fat.   The kimchi adds has a little cruunch and spice to the sandwich.",,,1
198,MinhDuyen N.,"New York, NY",115,145,773,4.0,7/18/2016,"pretty damn good place for beer and cheese. the cheese spread is amazing and the bread, well... it's just down right buttery and thick, the way toast should be. i can eat a whole regular order (a lot of spread, some garlic cloves, and about 7 or 8 thick slices of toast) by myself, and most of the time, i do. i try to share one or two pieces but the kindness stops there. the tacos are pretty good as is their spicy (not too spicy) tomato soup. their sandwiches are also on point, especially the one with kimchi, fried egg, and pork belly. beer selection isn't extensive as they usually rotate what's on tap but i'm still a huge fan simply for their food.",,,
