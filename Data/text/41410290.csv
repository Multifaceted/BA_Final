If you like loud music, great bartenders, good wings and fresh cut fries, come ride the iron horse...This place just needs a bull riding machine to take fun to the next level.

1,Giselle C.,"New York, NY",497,42,75,3.0,10/29/2018,"Heard good things about this place. Honestly wasn't all that impressed. It wasn't busy at all. Inside there is a bar at the front a couple tables in the middle and then a pool table at the back. To enter the place you have to go through a front door and go up some stairs before you can actually enter the bar area. IWe were looking for a low key sports bar to watch the game but this place had such loud music that we were legit yelling at each other. The bartenders are not super friendly and we're chatting with customers more than taking new drink orders. Therefore many people were just standing around waiting to order. Also, they have a $20.00 credit card minimum so it's around a 3 drink minimum. Otherwise cash only which I thought was super weird for the area. Probably wouldn't come back. Also, drinks weren't that strong.",,,
2,Katie H.,"New York, NY",354,203,100,3.0,8/18/2018,"This place is hilarious. I had a good time, just don't feel like i can give it more than three stars. There's a swing and a pole on top of the bar and you'll see the bartender doing crazy things with patrons on the swing. There's a wheel you can spin for shots, swinging, etc. We came because the beers here are incredibly cheap maybe $2 for a PBR. Interesting crowd lol but they have pool tables and tvs for your entertainment. The biggest upside are the cheap drinks. Other than that, not my scene haha.",,,1

There's a swing above the bar that the bartenders and patrons (if you're daring enough) will swing around on. They do serve food- I ordered something once and I wasn't too impressed- but I didn't have high hopes anyway lol. Good selection of music from all genres. Only 2 bathrooms- which can get annoying, but for the most part, they are pretty clean. All in all a cool spot to get a few drinks. And oh, buybacks are non existent here, unless the owner is around, he hooked it up",2,2,2
5,Millie T.,"Brooklyn, NY",17,13,3,1.0,10/14/2018,The bar was nice place to go listen to music. I decide to eat a burger and this was the worst burger do not know what kind of meat they used horrible definitely wasn't beef. When I ask for my burger told the bartender to add cheese. I got the burger noticed there's no cheese mentioned it to the bartender. She apologized and was like give me a minute I'm thinking she's going to take my plate and take it to the kitchen. She comes back few minutes later with a plate and 2 slices a cheese. She apologized told me she's sorry next round on her. My burger was cold and I was just not happy by this point because any place will take your plate take it to kitchen and add the cheese for you. I wanted melted when my burger was hot. I asked for another drink and my bill and she definitely charged me for the last drink.,,,

8,Zaneta O.,"Westbury, NY",953,773,3110,3.0,10/16/2017,"I think your experience at the Iron Horse had much to do with the attitude you walk in with. If you come in with high expectations you may be disappointed but if you are just looking for a cheap drink locally and some loud music to drown out your sorrows you might just be in luck. The centerpiece here is the swing that's mounted above the bar. Fortunately I did not drink enough to climb up there, but four years ago me would have been all over that. Yes, I am admittedly less fun in my older age but not so pretentious that I can't hang out in a dive for a couple of hours.The bouncer Richard is super cool. He kept us company on our vape breaks as he worked the door. He's a very personable down to earth guy. The bartenders were attentive. I can't comment on mixology as I only drank beers but they were quick, cold, and served with a smile, so I can't ask for much more. We didn't eat here but the kitchen was also likely closed anyway. The bathrooms were cleaner than expected for a spot like this.For entertainment you can play pool or watch one of their screens. The occasional dancing on the bar shenanigans will definitely ensue at some point during your visit. Although this place screams ""hook up spot"" none of the patrons were particularly douchey or aggressive and there was a decent male to female ratio. Will I be back? Sure. My friends live nearby so I will likely end up here again at some point.",10,2,5

There's a swing over the bar and depending on when you go the bartender will do a little dance on the bar. Very Coyote Ugly vibes, but I thoroughly enjoyed the entertainment. There's a pool table in the back and a jukebox that you can choose music to play from. The Jukebox has old school and new music which is great.

I looked up ""dive bars"" in NYC because we all know dive bars are fun and pocket-friendly, haha.Upon entry, we noticed the bouncer was a bit aggressive, but I didn't take offense to it because I'm sure she deals with a lot of shenanigans. (Not a bad thing...if you come here, expect to get down!) We sat at the bar and ordered a beer (I got the Rolling Rock) + a shot for only $7 (great deal, btw.) As the night went on, we ordered more rounds of drinks and ended up at the pool table in the back. We also took a few pictures in the photo booth (for memories, of course!) and then we returned to the bar...where the famous swing is!I must say that the swing is VERY secure- in fact, it doesn't even swing side to side, so I felt pretty safe. The bouncer helped me get on and made sure the bar was clear of drinks and people in the way. Once I got on, I couldn't believe I was swinging in the middle of a bar (literally, lol.)One of the bartenders approached me after I got off the swing and started to whip me, lmao! (Yes, this actually happened.) I was laughing the whole time because it was so unreal to me.I also got on the bar and danced for a whole song and got a free shot- this is actually a THING at the Iron Horse. As you can see, this bar has tons of (fun) things to do, so don't come here expecting to have a relaxed night! Cause you won't! By the way, all this fun wouldn't of been possible if it wasn't for the super friendly and fun bartenders (Eliza was one of them.)My friends and I definitely had a night to remember at this spot.

21,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,3.0,10/5/2016,"I bookmarked this bar about two weeks ago; I knew In advance I would be coming, after reading a couple of favorable reviews, the overall four star rating, and the close proximity to my office.  However, I began to read more comments last night along with the responses from the Iron Horse representative on Yelp, and I became apprehensive about even coming here today. I've never saw responses from an ""owner"" that were so unprofessional, condescending, and overall insulting, Zbigniew S.,may want to re-think how he replies to former customers, or potential new customers because I don't believe people like being insulted and may stop patronizing this bar.Now, onto the review...We arrived here about 6:15 the seats at the bar was filled, and we opted for te small toward the back. I thought they would have a server come over, but the small menu at the table mentioned you must order food and drinks at the bar. I opted for the Rum Punch ($7), which was great and my friend had a beer. The bartender was friendly and helpful. We snaked on some French fries ($4) which were much too greasy and some mozzarella sticks ($8). Shortly thereafter, the bar emptied out and we were able to sit at the bar for round two. The bartender then mentioned after we were done there was a representative from Coors, and we could each have a beer on the house... sweet!Overall, I wanted to dislike this place, but I had a decent time here. They even have outlets under the table where you can charge your phone... The bartender did an impromptu swing on the swing right above the bar, and poured shots of Jameson and Fireball down the throats of patrons at the bar. I would recommend this place and return in the future.",4,2,5

29,Claudia T.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",139,4,0,1.0,7/18/2017,"My boyfriend and I wanted to check out the nightlife in NYC because this was our first time in the state. We got there at around 10:30 and got a couple cheap drinks going. I'm not going to lie, this bar had really cool features; nothing like I've ever been to before. They had a juke box, a swing on top of the bar, a pool table, a real photo booth, and joystick games built-in a couple of the tables around the bar. The bartender was really nice and even though she was the only bartender working with 3 or 4 more parties, she gave us adequate attention. The scene and the crowd would definitely have been more fun if we had been more drunk. HOWEVER, the reason why I'm giving this place 1 star is because the bouncer threw my boyfriend out FOR NO REASON. The stools at the bar were all full and we had just ordered another round of drinks. Just as the bartender was making us our drinks, the bouncer asked my boyfriend to get out of his seat because there were other people waiting for a seat. Obviously, my boyfriend refused and nicely explained to him that we rightfully sat down here first, and it's not like we weren't ordering drinks... like EXCUSE ME?! There were plenty of other people he could have asked to give up their seats but he chose us... why would he ask US out of all people, to get out of OUR seats that we RIGHTFULLY had first, and not anyone else.

By the time he got to me he was so out of breath and thought cpr may be required. After seeing my i.d. We were allowed into his kingdom.  This guy wondered about flirting with the female locals and looking at us like we were scum. The barmaid was reasonably friendly and did her job well.

Wether its taste in music, international travel, scuba diving, hula-hooping, or even balloon animals all the bartenders are awesome. You also can beat $2 cans of Schaeffer. Makes me feel like its the 70s again. The owner Ziggy is a cool, no bullshit business man, who knows exactly the type of place he runs and why.

From the photos it looks like a very nice place for yuppies to explore their white trash inner divas. Good job on being so stuck on yourselves. Wanna be Honda Davidson trash.  Edit you are a disgrace to PBR and your waitress ""bartenders"" look like Craigslist ""therapeutic massage "" rejects. It's also funny how butthurt the owner is, too attack some woman over her honest opinion. You must be real pleasant to work for, I'm sure you are probably some short man syndrome Mommys boy, how much have you spent on domestic violence defense. You brought this onslaught of having your character questioned by attacking a Yelp reviewers freedom , you are a piece of shit.     Using fire in the manner being shown here in a work place environment , violates numerous OSHA standards and policies. In your attempt to gain viral marketing from attacking yelp reviewers on their honest opinions. You may just have exposed yourself to being reported to the afore mentioned government labor organization . Hopefully no one reports you before you can remove yourself from Yelp, that's really your only choice to try and cover up your gross workplace safety violations, that have been openly documented on this site. Toodles.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_Gen…Fire Safety is serious business, you are exposing your patrons and employees to unnecessary injury and risk of legal action.Still waiting on a witty reply from the owner....Probably not sure how to handle this one. I can be on plane within 24 hours too come do a review in person, I'll bring some friends from OSHA with me too. Safety first.Also so the owner has replied to a message the business inquiry, thus making this review an interaction with the actual buusiness. The owner has decided to take it upon himself to personally attack Yelp reviewers directly, now he can deal with it on his end. Most of his responses are an attempt to humiliate the reviewer, who are using this app to express their opinions , such as it was intended.",,1,

Moreover, she gave us free shots and then was pushing us to give her 25% tip. We gave her 18% and she changed the bill to 26%!!!

56,Emilia C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,25,0,3.0,9/20/2017,Been here about five different times this summer and it was a pretty good experience every time. One time though I went to close my tab (was at $50 and I wasn't in any condition to be ordering more) and the bartender told me that I would have to wait another 45 minutes before I can leave. I was a tad confused by the statement and didn't want to cause a scene so my friends and I stayed. The swing on the bar is fun but the bouncer won't stop grilling each and every person that comes through the door. Makes me a bit uncomfortable. I am also just finding out through Yelp that they have food!,,,

Yee-Haw!Its the kind of dive bar joint made famous in the movies. Think Hogs & Heifers and the flick Coyote Ugly. Same basic theme. Female bartenders dance on the bar, they drag up giggling gals and sometimes drunken guys to shake their booty up there, and have some patrons also take a wild ride on the swing above the bar with loud rocking tunes in the background. Ride 'em cowgirl!All the while cheapo drinks, beers, and shots are being served. Take a chance on the Wheel of Misfortune for $5 and earn a libation based on whatever it lands on. Some are funny and some are a bit embarrassing. Like Truth or Dare for a drink. Be warned!Kind of a narrow bar space. Good rock music playing. Fun sexy female bartenders slinging drinks, and also performing on the bar doing some semi-slutty acrobatics and dance moves. $3 PBR's and Natty Lights. Pool table. Photo booth. Happy hour. They serve a bar menu of food here too but I did not sample any the night we were here. Too busy pounding down those cheapie brews!Overall, par for the course as it resembles a few different bars here in the city doing this kind of thing. Seems catered to the 20-something bridge and tunnelers bro and sorostitute crowd. If this is your kind of thing you will be in proper company.Overall, it's good unclean kitschy fun!",16,11,13

Some times its you get something good other times you get o'duols The swing on the bar is great fun though I haven't gone up there yet but my girlfriend has and she loved it. Sometimes it's funny to watch dopey guys get pushed around by the bartenders when it's their turn to go up. All in good fun though.If you get bored of that there's a so-so condition pool table in towards the back. Overall a cool place to go to either get the night started or to finish it off.,,1,
61,Stephanie P.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",949,1044,25525,3.0,6/1/2014,"I could see how Iron Horse could easily be a 4-5 Yelp stars place based upon the potential to have a really fun time here and for their consideration with people who's taste buds (and livers) have varying tastes and budget points.After a nearby Yelp Elite event, I wanted a ""night cap"" and I wanted it to be on the cheap side. Hey there large Iron Horse street sign advertising $3 cans and not so priceypants wells! Food also? Sweet! Upon further inspection of this bar I realized I had been here before...about 3 years ago during Santa Con when it was like 2ish and (thanks to having 1 particular b*tch of a coworker at the time) I was the only sober female Viking Santa in the place. Super crowded bars (dive or not) where everyone is acting wearing their ""I'm soooooo drunk! pants"" tend to be on the morbidly painful side when you're sober and a spectator because bartenders won't cut off their increasingly rowdy/slurring patrons in favor of serving the new girl a vodka soda.., I didn't have a great time that afternoon until I went next door and could actually get service. Now, I know this experience was due to mostly external factors completely out of Iron Horse's control - so I chose to not review the place at the time.So enough of memory lane, let's gas pedal back to my most recent time here - I'm with my girls and not riding solo like my first time here. Unfortunately it was more of a 2-3 star kind of experience...and not because it was a Tuesday night, lol.The 2 bouncers on staff - awesome! They were funny, friendly and I know it was the bartenders first night so it was sweet how they would help her out whenever she needed to be acclimated with something. Because it was her first night there I won't be harsh about how I waited over 10-15 minutes to start my tab. pay for a round of drinks and/or ""Wheel of Misfortune"" spins and order a last beer as orders were being taken for people who had just arrived. I thought that the $5 ""Wheel of Misfortune"" was a Yelp deal but it turned out to be standard, but it caused some confusion with the bartender who seemed to not know what Yelp WAS and wasn't going to change us for our Wheel spins because she thought our Yelp deals gave us free spins. I was honest and let her know it didn't and that she should charge us...and then I proceeded to wait 10-15 minutes so I could pay for them. Yarg.Policy speaking I found it really stupid that I wasn't allowed to put $1.50 on my tab to play pool on the table in the back - especially when my tab was already over the required $20 cc minimum without including the measly pool charge I wanted to add...no pool for us that night. Had they facilitated adding pool to my tab we would have played 1 or 2 rounds, stayed longer, tossed a few more drinks back and thus spent more money...silly decision on their part. Where they DID excel (and where I would consider bumping my rating to 3.5 stars) was with their awesome Wheel of Misfortune and the even more awesome music playlist...I knew I was going to have to immediately channel my inner Britney/JLo/sexy octopus (inside joke...lulz) when Salt & Pepa's ""Shoop"" was playing when we walked in.I would definitely come back here again if in the neighborhood and in a low-key, divey kind of mood. Bring cash though if you want to play pool and be patient with the bar staff. With the right company and fun clientele this place is a guaranteed fun time.",3,,1

Updated review","This must be a bar only for night time. Upon entering the establishment my guest and I were 2 of 5 people total. The only server doubled as a bartender. She was nice. She took our food order and we asked for waters. Just as she was putting in our order a group of her friends showed up and we were forgotten about. After 20 minutes I walked up to the bar and asked for our waters from the order. She poured water in a plastic cup and left it on the bar for me to grab. Mind you she took our order for 2 waters. When I asked for the second water pointing to my guest she again just set it on the bar. When it came time to pay we were hit with the ""credit has a $20 minimum."" Our bill was $18.75. When I asked the bartender/waitress why she had not mentioned this upon asking if we were paying cash or credit she replied with a shaky ""I'm sorry I got a concussion last night and I'm just trying to remember everything, my brain is scrambled blah blah blah"" I had just watched her tell her entire life story to a group at the bar 5 minutes earlier so I wasn't buying it. If she really had a concussion then I'm a little disappointed that IRON HORSE had her as the only person on. To top of this whole experience the food was so greasy that it sent me into a flare with my GI complicated and I vomited all night long. Will not be returning.     *** the bar still has yet to comment on their only employee on the floor having a concussion so severe she forgot to tell us things***",,2,
65,Enrique G.,"Brooklyn, NY",124,75,31,5.0,9/11/2016,"I always have lots of fun here, beautiful girls and always fun.

66,Priti R.,"New York, NY",320,405,57,2.0,5/21/2015,"What? Why is this place so popular?My friend and I went at 1:30am on a Saturday. This place was near empty! And whoever was inside were all guys at this point. It felt extremely awkward to be the only two girls in the bar. Not to mention there was a fight going on outside that nearly took us both out on our way in. Perhaps we missed the party, but I thought this was NYC. Maybe start your night here, instead of finishing it?",10,2,1
67,Terrence J.,"Wellington, FL",79,3,0,5.0,8/7/2016,"I had a fantastic time at Iron Horse last night. The beer was cold, crowd was lively, bartenders were awesome. The manager George took time out to ensure I was enjoying myself and yeah sure there are always a few obnoxious people who just can't handle being told ""No!"" Case in point some mess named Victoria who insisted she be allowed to dance on the bar with the other grown ups. But she looked like she could barely stand up straight and while I might have enjoyed watching her face plant off the bar due to her tantrum I'd rather not see the bar tied up in litigation for the guaranteed Injuries she would have inflicted upon herself. Luckily she was only a small part of the night with a very loud mouth. Maybe they could video tape people absolving the bar from any responsibility...Nah too technical. Keep the bar for people who are both old enough to drink and mature enough not to act like self entitled children. Iron Horse is awesome! Hands Down, drinks up the best saloon in Manhattan! Will surely be back again.",2,3,

69,Stephanie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1398,568,597,2.0,4/10/2016,I would have given the Iron Horse 3-4 stars because the bartenders are really sweet and attentive and the drinks are really cheap. Not to mention this place will give you a good laugh with the entertainment. Whether you are a native New Yorker or a tourist you can enjoy the show here. The bartenders dance on the bar and they bring the patrons up for fun as well. If you get up on the swing with the bartenders you will get a free shot. There is really nothing else like this in NY that I have ever seen. Unfortunately the female security guard here is extremely rude!!! They have USB and regular chargers under the bar which is awesome!! But it was dark and I was having a hard time catching the plug. The security guard SNATCHED my charger out of my hand literally and made a very snide comment because she got annoyed. There is definitely no reason for them to be that aggressive and rude. This is a DIVE BAR and they take the fun out of it. She kept eyeballing us the entire night. For privacy reasons you aren't allowed to take pictures which I understand but they will approach you if you take your camera/phone out. And before the swing show begins security will step on the bar and stand over you until you remove all of your stuff off of the bar. It was a very uncomfortable feeling and we left after 2 drinks. Unless I hear that security starts to take a non aggressive approach I will not be returning. It is inexcusable to snatch something out of someones hands.,23,5,6

The most recent visit solidified the spot as somewhere I'd make a more regular appearance.My friends and I came to Iron Horse after a lengthy bar crawl on Stone Street for our friends birthday. The bartenders (Angie, in particular) were friendly, attentive and personable. The drinks were cheaper than the going rate in the area ($7 for a shot + beer) and the antics were wild.If the swing dangling from the ceiling didn't provide enough entertainment for my crowd, the bartender whipping our friend on his birthday (with his own belt) certainly was.

I've been to many bars and I think I know the protocol, but this was ridiculous this man was intentionally ignoring us. Eventually the guy standing next to me did the exact same motion that I had been doing for the past 10 minutes and got the guys attention and ordered for me. The food was cold, the drinks were so so... there's really no point of me ever going back here; the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.",6,1,1

Updated review","I've since left New York City and moved upstate. I sorely, sorely miss this place. My original review was written 5 years ago, but my love for the Iron Hizzy still burns strong. Whenever I visit my best friend/former roommate who now lives in New Jersey, guess where we wind up? Riding the goddamn bus from NJ to the Financial District to slum it at The Iron Horse. Since I left, the smell has, in fact, gotten worse, which I didn't think was possible. But as you approach the place you'll see people fleeing, shaking their heads and cursing about the stench. Shit yeah, it's bad. Think of it like hazing. You want to be in the club? Power through it or get out. You wanna hang out at a stuffy lounge that smells like baby prostitutes and Axe, paying $18 a drink? Didn't think so. Put on your big girl panties and shove a travel sized Febreeze in them. I brought my mom to the Iron Horse in 2011 to show her the place I always talked about. At first she was disgusted. An hour later, her alter ego, ""Veronica"" was tugging on a shirtless man's dreadlocks in a way that made me feel dirty on the inside. My parents have since divorced.I was back there a few months ago and to my surprise, even though it's been years, who do I see but Mr. Dreadlocks. The memory of Veronica/my mom inappropriately stroking his bare pecs sent a shudder down my spine. Moments later, longtime bartender Melanie, slides me my vodka Red Bull, points at Mr. Dreadlocks and shouts: ""remember when you made out with him!?!?? HAHA you were so drunk!"" No, I do not remember making out with the same man my mother violated. Whatever your age or position in life, The Iron Horse will cut you down to size and no one is safe. But couldn't we all use a little more adventure in our lives? Live on Iron Horse, live strong.",11,32,6

I didn't even argue and she made a big emphasis to kick me out again for going in the bathroom her and I said okay again. I even went to the bathroom later by myself and she followed me to the bathroom again. This place sucks, dont go if you're gay, dont go if your gay friend is there cause they'll be judged.

Cheesse charged extra what is fine since it was stated in the menu. Cesar salad was a disgrace. Cesar salad usualy contains fresh vegetables not just lettuce and crutons charging chicken 2$ extra is a insulte. Had better salads for less money. I understand that the price of 10$ is a bargain but a receiving a lesson in tipping in USA made us feel very uncomfortable. First off all were charged 6$ more beacuse off a mistake of the staff, all payments done in advance, went back to correct the mistake. We also work in service industry but paying in advance and being shamed for leaving only 20 % tipp is inacceptable. I do not mind leaving a good tipp but for a good service and food, what was received was far from it. This bar is good to get a 2$ can of beer but add service to the price if you don't want to put yourself in a uncomfortable situation.",6,2,1

Updated review","I went to Iron Horse a few months ago for the UFC fight. While the atmosphere was again, great, there were some differences from the first time I went.First of all, there was a drink special advertise outside and I don't believe I got that price. When I went to close my tab, I had two different receipts with different prices. I signed it, but was definitely overcharged. I let my credit card company handle that, no big deal. My friend also was victimized by the minimum charge thing and even asked if they would just add a dollar to get to it and they wouldn't. It took about 15 minutes. I know from working in customers service that there is a law where you technically can't have a minimum charge. Places do that so people just don't charge a 3 dollar beer and that's it. I get that, but to not bend a little bit when a group has been there for several hours is a joke.Overall, if I'm in New York again soon, I would go here. I would just hope to get these common courtesies.",1,,

Updated review","Last night for New Year's Eve, Iron Horse raised the price of the small cans of beer to $4 each (they have always been $3 since they first opened) just because it was New Year's Eve. I understand management's comments regarding it being because there was no cover charge, yet it just wasn't expected and was never done in previous years. The bartenders are excellent and always put on a great show. Although, I'm not a regular, I do notice the energy level of the patrons tends to rise whenever rock or country is played on the jukebox, so I disagree that most patrons rather hear pop/club music. But, as long as the bartenders remain friendly and entertaining, I guess I can't complain too much. I am an old guy and the changes I've seen at Iron Horse over the years have not been for the best in my opinion. Therefore, I will no longer be coming here since too many changes have been made, while my tastes remain the same. I have been going to bars for over 35 years, so I definitely know without a doubt how a bar should be run successfully in order to keep loyal patrons coming back and keep their doors open. Absolute proof of this are the bars that last the longest such as Duffs, The Patriot, and Doc Hollidays. However, I edited this review by adding a couple more stars only because the current bar-tending staff deserves it.",8,4,4
84,Tiffani G.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,146,227,3.0,2/16/2016,"Such a fun place to go! Their wheel of misfortune is so worth the 5$! I came here for my birthday last year. I never knew anywhere in NYC had a swing on the BAR! It was so bizarre to me, and I mean all my friends tried to get me to go on it but that wasn't happening. The bartenders pour shots into your mouth straight from the bottle and people get pretty wild dancing on the bar!Only problem I had with this place was the size. It's pretty tiny. Not too clean, meaning sticky floors but how much do you really expect from a dive bar with drunk people everywhere. They have a photo booth which I loved!",4,,1
85,ChrissyKitty P.,"Upland, IN",265,5,0,1.0,8/24/2017,"The worst service I've ever received, even at a dive bar. The bartenders were all rude and the bouncer was downright offensive. She snapped at clientele, grabbed a tiny girl by the waist and slammed her into a wall, and snapped at me multiple times asking if I spoke English (so racist to boot). It wasn't until I threatened to press charges for racial discrimination that she backed off. Management, if you read your yelp reviews, I'd take a good long look at her because she's losing you a LOT of business.

87,Molly M.,"Beaverton, OR",23,68,14,5.0,12/31/2015,"Iron Horse is an absolute blast, and I definitely recommend checking it out if you're not from town and looking for a unique experience. Our first night in NYC was spent hopping around Brooklyn and Manhattan bars. This was the last one of the night, and it was definitely a treat! It was an ultra friendly vibe - we were greeted by the extravagant bartender as soon as we walked in. Patrons were all super drunk and super friendly. There were pool tables in the back of the bar, a jukebox to the side, and a swing ON the actual bar. I asked what the Wheel of Misfortune was, and the response I got was ""The Wheel of Misfortune, man!"" The bartender spun the wheel, pulled me onto the bar, forced me onto the swing, joined me on the swing, (motor boated me?!) and poured a generous amount of fireball in my mouth. I was so taken aback by the situation - no one does stuff like this in Chicago that I've seen. The man next to me spun the wheel, got a nice little dance and tease, and a free shot, and a little submissive action. Security was super nice, (Richard was a sweetheart) drinks were CHEAP, and overall this was a fun experience that I recommend, especially to tourists!",6,6,1

We were there at an odd time (just after lunch on a weekday) so, barring a few solo guys drinking at the bar, we were the only one there...A group of 6 girls reunited and looking for a fun, dive bar.... And fun was had! Dark,  loud jukebox, pool table... Even a photo booth!Awesome bloody Mary's, tried the Big Apple and loved it too!! Very accommodating... The bartender (who was awesome by the way) even gave us credits for the jukebox so we could rock out to our tunes. Having a great time and we were about to leave when the bartender asked us to take a ride on the swing (I hadn't even noticed it when we arrived!), so swing we did, with enthusiasm, to 'The Devil Went Down to Georgia' blaring on the jukebox (almost too enthusiastic as I almost swung my friend's head into the ceiling!) Unbeknownst to us, a shot from bottle to mouth is required before exiting the swing, which seems fitting...  :-) I'd totally recommend this place for a  group looking to let loose and have a good, down to earth, time without costing a fortune. We'll come back the next time we reunite in NYC, and we'll be sure it's in on a Wednesday so we get the same bartender!",8,6,5

Went to the bathroom and came back to  table dancing, well bar dancing. This place's energy immediately went from chill to a random hell of a time. Out of towners were cool people you could just talk to and get an understanding about. Bouncer was also pretty chill. Bartender definitely knew how to work an extra drink out of anybody and every one, can't blame her for that. Wasn't the cleanest of places but I knew what to expect when I stopped by at 2am. Cleanliness would have gotten 5 stars from me but still two thumbs up over here.",,,

The bartender was really nice and offered us for free shots for dancing on the bar. So yes we were the drunk people dancing on the bar while it was empty. It was a dark, dive bar -just the way I like them. (Penn State game was playing in the background).The drinks were cheap, the bartender was awesome, the vibe was great- definitely go!",4,,1

So, of course, I followed, soon I could smell the cigarettes and drunks that were outside. Once inside I realized it was the place was my kind of place. The craziness, the fun, the booze, the swing! It was the perfect way to say goodbye to NYC, it was also the best way to assure I slept my entire flight home.

They have a swing hanging on top of the bar(Weird right !!). That's is actually the most fun part of this place. We walked in close to 10 on a Thursday night.They have a really nice happy hour serving pbr for just $3 bucks. On Sundays they give some complimentary snacks with Pbr.There were two bartenders, one Asian and the other blonde. These girls jumped on the bar and using the swing they performed some really kicks ass moves. There were full of energy and made the entire environment very vibrant. They also involved the patrons(3 girls) to come up to the bar and perform using the swing.Girls get free shots when they perform on the bar. After the swing act they performed on some songs with their cowboy boots(Coyote Ugly theme).It was definitely a fun night spent at this bar.Now I know what is the best bar in the financial district.",17,10,15
101,Tessa D.,"Back Bay, Boston, MA",270,237,584,1.0,7/22/2015,"My boyfriend and I came in one day a while back ago to kill some time before an event, and it was truly a bizarre experience. When we went it wasn't particularly busy, maybe a dozen people or so, and we managed to snag two seats at the bar. When we first entered I hadn't thought much of the place, it just seemed like a regular dive bar with a bit more noise. Then I noticed things were a bit off, the female bartender was most definitely under the influence and doing a very poor job at hiding the fact. My boyfriend and I ordered beers and she couldn't fill the glasses correctly. She could barely tell us the prices of what we'd ordered. And I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable about her attire. She was probably in her mid to late 30's and I could see her thong and she was wearing a top that barely covered anything.At the other end of the bar there was a couple who were drunk and the bartender was hanging out with them, and they eventually all got up on the bar to do shots and dance. At one point the guy lay on the bar and the bartender poured whipped cream all over his chest for his girlfriend to lick up. My boyfriend and I were both utterly confused with the situation. The bartender then put a half full beer bottle on her head and proceeded to walk around like she was a model, then she tried to dance with it on her head and fell over. And I don't even want to get into the swing situation, I can't imagine how many drunk girls have fallen off of that thing. Sure, the night was amusing, but in a pathetic kind of way. I felt embarrassed for every person in there. I most definitely wouldn't ever come back to this bar, it's not my kind of thing. It's trashy and cheap, and I'd only go if I was a VERY different kind of girl. We finished our drinks and got out as soon as we could, this place was a complete s--- show. It is what they advertise as though, so at least they follow through?*EDIT (my response to note on my review) * So sassy, sassy, sassy. I'm not an uppity person who only goes to bars that have a starting price of $15,  I spend plenty of time in dive bars and I actually prefer them to so-called ""stuffy, high end, classy places"". And honestly, McDonald's is someplace I'd prefer to your bar. Gimme a sausage egg McMuffin over this mess ANY day. But anyway, I was simply stating in my review that your establishment was not my cup of tea. I discussed my experience and because of what happened I felt inclined to give a single star. Yes, you follow through with what you advertise, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. If other people do, good for them, but I don't. Had your bartender not been a drunken mess I probably would've given a higher review, but having someone slur their words and shout at me while spilling beer all over the place isn't professional or pleasant. You're trying to portray me as an uppity person with no desire to experience things out of the box, but you need to accept that your establishment simply isn't the ""best"" at what it's doing. You advertise that you have ""talented"" staff, but why did my bartender spend 50% of her time drinking and the other 50% falling down? Is that her talent? You're a novelty that some people will enjoy, but it isn't carried out well enough for me to bother.",36,37,20

110,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10929,3.0,6/3/2014,"I don't think I can hate this place or love it. I came here about a year ago once when my friend had an interview in the neighborhood. I was on my lunch break and he asked for cheap. I basically gave him two options: Jeremy's in the Seaport or this that I had never been to before. When I came in, it honestly wasn't a horrible experience. I had a pbr and possibly chicken wings that weren't the worst I've ever had. $3 cans. Cool beans. There were girls at the time bizarrely swinging from the ceiling and dancing on top of table tops. Not what I expected for a mid-week beer pick me up during work lunch hour. BUT the bartenders on staff totally did buy everyone at the bar Irish car bombs. For what reason?! I have no idea but I gladly accepted it. Came here after a yelp event last week. There is some kind of Yelp check in offer, which is kind of pointless. It's $5 for spinning the Wheel of Misfortune. Which when writing this review, I initially wrote 'Wheel of Malice', that I personally think sounds way more bad-ass. But it's $5 normally anyway. It has a huge range of options on the wheel. I wasn't actually going to do it until every single one of my friends decided they had to and I felt peer pressured. Options range from doing a shot of whatever is listed to dancing on top of the bar to getting a crappy Rolling Rock, etc. Lucky me landed on a double shot of whatever the hell I wanted well liquor. I couldn't imagine doing their worst vodka in their line up so finally decided on whiskey. It was Evan Williams. I remember a time when a jug of Evan Williams stayed in my freezer for the better part of 2 and a half years. The fact that I downed the shot, upside down on top of a bar stool with the guide of the bartender girly was impressive. Even for me. Even for her. Shoot. She said I took it like a champ. Pats back.My friends wanted to stay longer. They played some pretty groovy 90's tunes. There's a pool table. Only problem was that one of them had issues with getting her card charged both right and in a timely manner under 15 minutes. I was restless and drunk and left at this point. But above and beyond all, I think this is a last drink of the night kind of bar. It's a little dark and grungy. People were complaining I guess about how much well drinks cost - About $8 on non-happy hour prices. This is not that kind of bar, folks. It's PBR, Rolling Rock, and a shots kind of place.",3,,

It's always a fun place to go, the energy is always up, the jukebox is a cool thing to have, the pool table brings people together, and the photo booth... Well... ;) The beer deals are great, and the beer + shot combo is a fun combo. The wheel of misfortune has a lot of fun shots and things to do, and the swing above the bar (which is supervised for safety) is totally crazy, in a fun way.This one bartender (who is engaged) was just way too pushy about her tips however, and had no shame in being a slut about it, but it is what it is.Overall it was a fun time though!",2,,2

The crowd may be hit-or-miss, but the staff are always accommodating. Half the bartenders are out to get you, and the other half are committed to making your night mental[1].

I could understand why he was. When we ordered our drinks and the bartender said $8.00 dollars for the 4 of us ($2.00 PBR's + shots), I know then why this man was drunk.  Believe me; we were on cloud 9 when we left the place.  The bartenders were very friendly and the service was great. One bartender girl jumped on the bar and started using the swing.  That's right people; they have a SWING in the middle of the bar along with a few dance poles.  She performed some really kicks ass moves on that swing while someone else was sitting on it. There were full of energy and made the entire environment very vibrant. They also involved the patrons to come up to the bar and perform (dance) or use the swing. You will get free shots if you do.

Rest assured I lead a very quiet life otherwise, but Iron Horse is the Ryan Gosling of dive bars and resistance is futile. Surprisingly, the crowd is friendly and not creepy. When my girlfriends are in town, I like to bring them here to kick off the night... with the hope that they get drunk enough that we won't have to proceed to some snooty establishment in the Meatpacking District afterward.  The barmaids are the best, they're friendly, fun, and actually very talented.  They definitely know how to work a crowd and keep it going.  Friday and Saturday nights are generally a mess; a fun, fun mess.  Ladies, leave the mini skirt (and dignity) at home and get on the bar top (don't worry, the bouncers will help you down).",6,7,10

I've never been to this place before nor read up anything on it prior to coming. My first impression upon walking in made me want to walk back out. It was small and filled with some biker looking folk - I just overall felt a little intimidated until the music started playing and I got some drinks. Then everything just felt like something from Coyote Ugly. I came in a group of 3 and each of us have fairly different taste in music. Damn near every song that played got all three of us singing along with everybody else in the joint. Two rounds of shots and beers had us dancing on top of the bar.

I personally did not realize what I was walking into, I was already pretty shwashted and did not even take a moment to read reviews or look at pictures. This girl just wanted a bar!! Lol We go inside and the bar was absolutely PACKED. Luckily we found a table for all of us to sit at. The bar in general was pretty big. On the bar the have this AWSOME swing that customers can ride with the assistance of their bar dancers. Yes the bar had dancers who also dance on polls that are also on top of the bar. They have a pool table in the back where my boyfriend was majority of the night. The beer selection was decent and the bartenders were extremely quick to serve even with all the customers they had. Inside they also have a wheel called the wheel of misfortune, it's $5.00's. It consists of different shots and actions you must take or do, some pleasant some not so pleasant. My friends and I were getting ready to go but I refused to leave without taking a spin from this wheel. The bartender came over, took my money and spun the wheel. Into the microphone she screams blowjob shot and goes ahead and makes me one. Yup that was the last drink I finished my night with, a lovely blowjob shot and it rocked. I would definitely visit this place again if I'm in the area. It is an extremely different bar for NYC and a cool experience.",6,5,4

The unmannered, unproffessional bartender had the nerve to announce not being tipped to all 5 patrons in the establishment over the microphone, Normally I would be upset but the one who should be embarrassed is the manager for hiring staff with clearly no experience and education.  It's unfortunate that established lose patron because of incompetent staff, I guess it's either nature of the business or perhaps poor hiring by management.I hope this post helps new patrons to redirect their hard earned  cash, business and time. I attached the receipt to show the waste of money.",32,30,12
132,Dan L.,"Franklin Park, NJ",26,8,3,5.0,10/7/2016,"Best place for a burger and draft beer for $10 bucks. The burger is big and juicy. So much better than BK or MickyD or the famous burger joints.

The bartender (Goodness, what was her name? Christina, maybe? Adorable, high-energy brunette!) was very playful and attentive and put us all in a party mood. More and more people started rolling in in the course of the night, but it never got uncomfortably packed. I like it this way, but I'm told weekends are always packed. We stayed there till closing and didn't even realize how the time flew. Here's my list of reasons to love the Iron Horse:-Bartenders will dance and perform and get the crowd going (regardless of capacity)-We are encouraged to dance on top of the bar and when you do, you get a free shot poured directly into your mouth, followed by a pump of whipped cream.-Actual swing above of the bar. Go ahead and climb on! Put another person on your lap if you'd like. Don't worry about falling. Richard, the sweetie-pie bouncer, has his eye on you and his arms ready to catch you if you fall...male or female (though females are preferred).-If you hula-hoop, grab one and go crazy!

I personally ended up hula hooping on the bar all within, I don't know.... 3 minutes after stepping foot into this bar....

It's the awesome bar tenders and shenanigans that keep us coming back. George and the girls are amazing. They really know how to treat you and make sure to get everyone involved from their bar tricks to pulling you up on the bar to dance or take a ride in the swing.

Updated review","As a lover of true blue dive bars, I'm a fan. Having visited a couple times recently, Iron Horse is quickly becoming one of my favorite bars in the city and is definitely my favorite Manhattan bar south of Canal. You get the sense here that you never know what will happen on any given night. Your provocatively clothed bartender may or may not be getting shitfaced with the customers. You might see swinging over the bar or you might see hula hoop dancing. You might see a birthday boy get his shirt ripped off and nipples covered in hot sauce and then be spanked by his friend's belt.$2 cans (or $3 after 8) and 7 for a drink and shot makes this not only a highly entertaining place to let loose and throw back some drinks but also an affordable one. I can't quite remember the name of it, since I've never encountered this beer outside of Iron Horse, but I like to order the cheap can that's sort of German-sounding (not Rolling Rock or PBR) with an Evan Williams shot.Tip well! These ladies work hard.",,,
150,Susan B.,"New York, NY",0,5,4,3.0,8/2/2015,This is a good local spots for cheap drinks after work. This place small and locally owned so everyone is friendly. My co workers enjoyed it as well and we will be coming back again.,,,

Regardless, very chaotic bar. If you are a single guy between the ages of 19-23, this is definitely a go to spot. If you are a girl with some class and don't want to get hit on by every guy in the bar... I suggest staying home and having a Wine night and Sex and the City night with ya girlfriends.",6,6,1

155,Dr. H.,"Newark, NJ",0,9,0,2.0,9/12/2016,"Prices are good for the area. Bartenders were meh, very aggressive on sales but friendly.  2 stars is because when my friend went to close out her $110 tab, she tipped $15 for 10 drinks ( ~ $1 per round, how hard is it to pour a shot? or open a beer). She did not get anything fancy, no special services, and the bartender came back and ASKED HER WHY SHE DID NOT TIP 20%, did she want to add more?  WTF? I understand this is near Wall St. so the traders come here and blow wads of cash on these ""hot"" bartenders but really, to demand a bigger tip? Never again.

Not my idea of a good ol' time but I caved after some begging. Oh did I mention the ghetto/ home made swing on the bar........... with thick metal chains??? I didn't get that at first BUT THEN the show began. 3 bartenders that looked so drunk they might fall off the bar while ""dancing"" started stomping around to some rendition of ""Cotton-eye Joe"" and pulled up the only man that did not have tattoos and started to rock him on the swing. Then they jump on top of him and try to do some sexy leg moves while flying through the air. Then I realize that the poor bartenders aren't drunk....... they've just been kicked in the head so many times from patrons on that darn swing that they are permanently confused.

163,Anna F.,"Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, NY",251,239,2100,3.0,5/28/2014,"A solid three stars, Iron Horse is unapologetic for being the way it is and doesn't give a damn what you think.I like that.After a Yelp event earlier one evening a few friends and I decided to wander in here for a night cap.  I hadn't been here in over two years since Stephy P. had me join her here for Santa Con so it was interesting to see this place at night, in the dark and sober.  The place has an odd entrance two doors and a few steps before you're actually inside where you're greeted by a bouncer and a long wall adorned with booze galore.Checking in on Yelp we noticed there was a $5 Wheel of Misfortune - all of us did this, by the way, possibly because we forgot we were not in our early twenties anymore.  The bartender spun the wheel and whereever it landed is what you got a shot of and the misfortune was that maybe you'd get a can of Coors Light (ugh).  If you got a shot, you climb onto the stool with your back arched facing away from the bar as the bartender climbs onto the bar bring your face back, her hand cupping your chin to ensure the liquor doesn't get on your clothes and BAM! pours the shot down your throat like you're in your early twenties again.  Well worth the $5 in my opinion - it's fun, suspenseful and is perfect is you're feeling nostalgic.  While waiting to pay, I noticed there was a tiny shelf with different flavored Svedka's and rum that were all $4 for a shot of them and whatever else was on that shelf.  Next to that was a shelf with board games and Twister!My friends and I clustered to the back of the bar praying for more early 90's hip hop and danced in our chairs just a little bit while one of my friends let loose around the table.  It was great - no one stopped us or told us to calm down presumably because the bar was relatively quiet (i.e. not too many people were there) and that their cameras were their for surveillance and their ""own amusement"".  At one point, my friend noticed a man on the bar installing something on the ceiling which we would later find out was a chair that one could sit and swing on top of the bar at their own discretion!  This was way better than the pool table and photo booth I noticed at the back of the bar.This place is pretty chill and fun but the prices are not.  Nine dollars for an amaretto sour? Yikes. I only knew this after the bartender gave me the drink.  Speaking of money, it was this girls first night and she almost let us not pay for the Wheel of Misfortune because she wasn't aware that Yelp notified Yelpers of the deal that Iron Horse already offers.  Also, she was confused - which was a given since we had a cash/credit card situation - about how to ring up my friends credit card and was flustered enough that according to my friend the bartender walked away to serve other customers.  Fair enough since things got complicated but, still.  Learn how to deal with pressure and start a tab while starting a drink - it may have been your first night but this is your job.Anywho - I'll be back if I have a good reason to be!",4,,1

You can pay $5 to spin the wheel and get a random drink but be prepared for it to be poured down your throat and not handed to you in a glass. The bar tenders are super friendly and really fun!

Updated review","Okay, I really want to like this place, but I went back recently and I just can't.No extra tips was forged this time, but the actual charge was pretty much just made up. My bill was $50. I had 2 well drinks at $8 each, which leaves $34 for the 3 shots of Fireballs. It's not even a round number for crying out loud. At least make an effort to hide what you're doing...People go to bars to relax and unwind... if I have to constantly worry about fraudulent charges, then is it even worth coming here?",5,1,1

The only thing that I didn't like was the security/bouncers. They are way too friendly with the women and unprofessional. It feels like there consumers as well there to drink.It is there job to help women down off the bar when dancing but way too touchy friendly. I addressed one guy about it he was pretty cool like ""Im doing my job"". I understand that and all but no need to be all on my lady when she's not on the bar anymore.

The bartender was walking sloppily on top of the counter pouring guys free shots while their heads were wedged awkwardly between her boobs. My friend and I were the only two girls in the bar surrounded by men who looked like bar hopping was their day job. I feared for us to be honest. Finally, after the bartender got off we ordered two beers. She then picked up two cups, put it down and then forgot, getting on top of the bar counter again to strip... I mean dance. We watch as she wedges men, who certainly should've stopped drinking weeks or years ago, again against her chest to pour free shots. Then, not surprisingly, one of the men come up to us and his intelligent one liner is ""You Chinese?"" ""No..."" ""Japanese?"" 'Wrong again."" ""Chinese?"" ""You're on a roll"" ""LET ME BUY YOU GUYS A BEER"". He asks again for the two beers we asked for ten minutes ago after the bartender gets off. She slurs her words, picks up the forgotten two cups, puts it down and then gets back up on the bar. At this point, it is laughable so we leave. If I didn't know that this was a bar, I could've easily mistaken it for a really bad strip joint. If I had gotten my beer, I would've given this place three stars.",11,14,4

181,Erica M.,"Chicago, IL",25,103,113,1.0,7/12/2013,"Came in on the 4th of july because they were grilling free burgers and dogs. Definitely for the racy crowd. Bartenders in scantily clad clothing and swinging on the bar table. SUre it's entertainment, but watching a bunch of horny men drool over these ladies is not comfortable. An experience to be had once. Don't expect to come here to find a suitable future date.",4,4,2
182,Brian R.,"Atlanta, GA",114,97,70,5.0,2/12/2014,"Whether it be afternoon or night, weekend or weekday, this place is always awesome. The location is off on a side street around the usually quiet financial district, but once you step inside it feels like a party. Fun, laid back type crowd. Bartenders are a blast. The swing on top of the bar is a nice touch. Also don't forget to try your luck for 5 bucks with a spin on the wheel of misfortune...trust me, you won't regret it. No scratch that. You might regret it if you take offense to having a bottle of whiskey poured down your throat, however, I do think that if you are playing the wheel you are most likely not the type of person that minds getting wild once in a while. Go for it.If you're in the South Street Seaport /financial district area and are in the mood for a drink and a good time then I recommend giving this place a shot.",1,,1
183,Alyssa T.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",1,3,0,5.0,12/23/2015,Such a great vibe at this place! I love the atmosphere everyone is always so friendly and Erica the bartender is the best. She makes sure everyone is having a great time and enjoying themselves. I will definitely be back to the iron horse again!,,,
184,Maria M.,"Yonkers, NY",0,1,0,5.0,7/12/2016,"Went to iron horse for my bachelorette party this past saturday night. I had a blast! The drink prices were amazing, the music was hot, & the bartenders were the best! They were beautiful, friendly, & so much fun. I danced all night & even swung in their swing!!! Best night ever :-D",1,,1
185,Anne-Marie B.,"Katy, TX",187,258,145,4.0,5/20/2012,"I wanted to hate this place, I really did. It's just not possible. You can walk in there a complete introvert, and somehow, those crafty bartenders will have you dancing on the bar in no time (I mean, not me of course...)!",,1,
186,Revathi N.,"New Hyde Park, NY",0,4,0,3.0,12/12/2015,"This was the place my friends and I went to frequently in our grad school days! So much fun and the swing is awesome! The only reason I'm giving it a three is because I'm not a huge fan of country music, but when you're having fun, even that doesn't matter!",,,
187,SaSi C.,"Washington, DC",59,82,2,3.0,7/4/2014,"Maybe if they had the firebreathers, I'd consider giving this place four stars. When you first walk in, it can get a little overwhelming just because the place is super narrow and gets crowded; plus the bar is right there when you walk in. There are mini tables to your left and if you go to your right towards the back there are another three sets of four tables and one two seater as well along with a pool table. The drinks are really good and standard price for Manhattan drinks but way too expensive for dive bar drinks. The bartenders are super nice. The  doormen outside are a bit weird but the one inside(tall and stocky with reddish hair) is nice and kinda cute ;)I didn't try the food but I'd say I'd be back so I can try the food then.",,,
188,Michael C.,"Long Island City, NY",71,44,18,5.0,4/23/2014,I'm reading all the one and two star reviews on this place and I think to myself....that's why I go to The Iron Horse. I was lured into TIH the first time because some girl was pressing her boobs on the window as I walked by. Enough said.,,,1
189,Jess G.,"New York, NY",137,142,277,4.0,11/15/2013,"This bar is so much FUN! i don't even know how to begin this review...I have spent Thursday, Friday, Saturday nights here and the atmosphere has been equally great Yes, there is a swing at the bar. Yes, you get a free shot for going on the swing or for just dancing on top of the bar. And yes, I have been up there plenty of times. I just think its amazing, that you get rewarded with a free shot for having fun! Seriously, what else could anyone want from this place? But if you are a little shy and don't want to embarrass yourself just yet, this place also has cheap beer which is always convenient. Also, all through out the night the bartenders will have different shows to entertain the crowd. Let's just say there is fire, dancing and balancing involved. So if you want to see it you must head down there immediately!! PS. if you are young looking to meet someone this isn't the place, but if you want to spend an awesome night with your group of friends you will not regret coming here.",1,,2
190,Michael G.,"Brooklyn, NY",20,19,16,3.0,9/21/2015,"Total dive bar in every way. Cheap drinks. Pool table in the back. Swing on the bar that customers can go on- at the end of the ride you get a free shot in your mouth! Fun to pop in, couldn't imagine staying very long though.",,,
191,Breno R.,"Worcester, MA",0,9,23,5.0,8/7/2015,"Beers cans are cheap, the bartenders are awesome and you can swing over the balcony with them (if you're lucky) with a shot at the end... Can't be bad!",,,1
192,Laura S.,"Durham, NC",103,67,0,5.0,9/10/2013,"I've only been here once and I must say that I had a great time!!!  My friends and I came here for my bachelorette party and I can say that we were treated wonderfully and had a really really fun time.  The place is a little divey and I could see how it could be a little awkward for the sober and snobby, but they know how to have a good time.  They were really great to my party and myself!  They gave me a bachelorette sash to to wear (which I accidentally forgot to take off as I was leaving...sorry Iron Horse) and let my friends and I dance on top of the bar with another bachelorette party.  My friends enjoyed spinning the wheel of misfortune and the bartenders gave them two shots for the price of one (which is nice).  I can't say that I'd come to this place a lot because it's a bit over the top, but if you're looking for fun and good service I'd definitely give it a try (especially for a bachelorette party!!!)",2,,
193,Christine N.,"Los Angeles, CA",610,69,24,5.0,3/15/2013,"So much fun! This made my New York experience ten times better, but that's only if you are willing to try anything on the Wheel of Misfortune. For 5 bucks, you can get shots of Patron to blowjob shots to any shot you want from the bar (only if you are willing to dance for it). For example, I danced on the bar for what felt like years and in return, I received a Johnnie Walker Black Label shot. WINNING. This bar is for you only if you are willing to let loose or else you will be annoyed of everyone who is super wasted and having fun. I also love that they have a pool table and arcade games. The bartenders are great! They are super attentive to everyone and super genuine. It's extremely rare to even have the bartenders pay attention to you nowadays. Where else can you stand on the bar and dance without getting in trouble? Security guards even help give you a boost to get on top of the bar rather than throw you out when you try. Another great feature are the swings, yes you are seeing this correctly, there are swings here where the bartender swings you and dances on you as you swing. At the end, they even give you a shot with whipped cream for surviving. Six dollars for a beer and a patron shot, double win. I would have been content to buy the shot at 6 dollars or the beer at 6 dollars but both? I love you Iron Horse. Please don't ever change, unless we have inflation of course.  So great. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for some cheap drinks and somewhere to go buck wild for the night.",6,3,4
194,Aisha D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/12/2015,I loce the iron horse ... i go here all the time its upbeat and the prices are super affordable. Their happy hour is great .... my favorute part thi is the swinging bartenders Diana is the absolute best ... I make it my business to go when she's there. She's not just a bartender she's a friend ... I also love the bouncers they are cool but don't play with them lol you will get kicked out with no hard feelings ... they take very good care of the patrons,,,
195,Sara J.,"Buffalo, NY",1,7,8,3.0,8/30/2014,"Not much else to say except I got on a swing ON THE BAR with my BFF! The Iron Horse promises to be a good night. I vaguely remember a woman in the shortest skirt in America, hula-hopping up and down the bar. Guaranteed hook-up joint.",,,
196,Ashley W.,"Chicago, IL",127,10,0,5.0,10/27/2014,I found this gem just walking through NY by myself after a bad day. I am from chicago and automatically felt like home walking in this bar. Bartender Erica was purely amazing and really fun! She was not only a bartender but id practically say a entertainer and everything in between. What A amazing bar i will definately go back there next time im in town.Xoxoxo,,,
197,Elaine L.,"Manhattan, NY",33,43,50,1.0,1/24/2015,"The bartenders was so rude to me , kept ingoring me and she only was helping my friends. My friends had to get my drink for me. Rude as hell , never again",5,1,1
198,Darrin J.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,5.0,11/17/2014,"Haha. Oh my where do I start. Well the iron horse is a fixture, it's a Wall Street biker bar, but it's not like a biker bar I ever seen before. It's like a real live   ""Coyote ugly"". It's almost too fun. Don't go! It's already too damn crowed I don't want you in there as well. Drinks are moderately priced but they pour so much down you throat for free it come out to be cheaply priced. To get a free hit just get on the swing or do something stupid.This place is pretty far out.",,,
199,Will I.,"Yonkers, NY",1,29,25,3.0,5/22/2014,I have to be honest here. I would think a place with this must to off would be more entertaining. Give a good happy hour & hot bartenders for the drinks to flirt with and this place could rival Coyote Ugly. The wheel of misfortune is the best part. Spinning the wheel to see what you get is ballsy enough to visit. The ladies here on the other had are questionable. I've visited a couple time prior to today and only once have a seen a hottie here. The other time I brought the hottie here.,,,
