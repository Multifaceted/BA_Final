0,Mary S.,"New City, NY",0,13,8,4.0,11/9/2018,Had to celebrate my bday at Philippe.Haven't visited here in a while . We were seated in the red room upstairs which was nice because it was more private . The food was good . Service was fast But the waiters  kept messing and mixing our food orders up . The waiters were nice despite the mix ups . I enjoyed my selfReservations are a must,,,
1,Rich M.,"Falls Church, VA",2,15,0,1.0,11/17/2018,"Where to start...... food is mediocre at best.  Hot and Sour soup was greasy and tasteless ( a theme), then had chicken wraps....tasteless    Crispy beef was OK but could not tell it was beef.... how is that possible? We hope it was beef but would not bet on it. Food was delivered by effectively throwing the plates on table. And they quickly wanted to pick up unfinished plates.  Music was loud and annoying but not loud enough to drown out pretentious conversations around us. Nothing special. Will never be back.",,,

Our waiter came off a bit neglectful to our table while others seemed to have better quality of service.T- Timing was a 5 the food was prepared and served fast!A- Appearance of the venue was a 3 the space had an elegant touch to it but was tainted by the organization of seats. People were way too close to each other.F- Food was a 4 they definitely delivered in this section. From appetizers to entrees they had a great selection of food that met our expectations for the type of restaurant we were in. The dessert was the only setback from a perfect 5. F- Frequency, was a 2, likely will not return. The place was overhyped I honestly expected more. This place earned a solid 3.2 in our book.",,,
3,Alex F.,"Seal Beach, CA",4,71,13,3.0,11/19/2018,"When we arrived at the restaurant the hostesses were confused about our reservation. Which is odd because they called me this afternoon to confirm our party of 5. We went with expectations to have a phenomenal meal. We ordered hot and sour soup and won ton soup. Nothing special. We then had lettuce wraps, barbecue ribs, vegetable dumplings and pork soup dumplings. Again nothing special. For dinner we had the Beijing chicken, seven spice shrimp, Crispy beef, green beans, pork fried rice, vegetable lo mein and sweet-and-sour chicken. Again nothing special. I don't know how this restaurant has such great reviews when the food is no better than PF Chang's. The service was above average.",,,

It was the perfect date night and the food was delicious. I had the pleasure of a few celebrity spottings with Cyndi Lauper walking past our table a time or 2. I would have liked a little more enthusiasm from my waiter as he appeared tired and agitated but overall the experience was pleasurable. I'd definitely visit again.",3,1,2
5,Rose I.,"Manhattan, NY",85,377,3164,4.0,8/22/2018,"I really really wish there was a 3.5. I'm going to be generous and round up. The Chinese fare here was not bad; I did enjoy the first and second courses of the restaurant week dinner menu.The apps were very good:Shrimp satay prepared on a skewer with Chef Chow's famous peanut sauce - 2 skewers with 2 pieces each on a skewer . Healthy size portions with delicious sauce Dumpling sampler (6 pieces total - 2 each of shrimp, chicken & vegetable). Appreciated that the skin was not too thick and again generous (filling)Ordered entrees with sides like house fried rice and  vegetable stir fryBeijing chicken - chicken breast, sweet red bean sauce with walnutsFilet mignon & green beanstenders with spicy brown garlic sauceBoth dishes were quite saucy and not what I was expecting (in preparation and in presentation). While I was expecting higher quality fare, i did enjoy the dishes as they were tasty and satisfying.For dessert, tried the:Fortune cookie red velvet cake with cream cheese icing, fresh raspberriesDark chocolate layer cake with milk chocolate crème filling, dark chocolate glaze, miso-caramel ice cream, fresh raspberriesBoth tasted like they just came out of the fridge and, while they sounded interesting, were actually quite average I was still hungry after the RW meal that I also ordered the Crispy Duck with house made pancakes and additional brown rice . I really enjoyed the duck - too bad it was not part of the RW menu. I'm feeling confident the regular menu has outstanding dishes- the restaurant should highlight them to pique diners' interest... as so far it has done to mine",,,

Updated review","Another Fabulous Friday, and yet Another Fabulous Lunch at Philippe.  It's like coming home, it just feels so right.  I went with a healthy lunch session today.  Chicken and Lettuce Wraps, the Wok BRANZINO over a bed of Auvergne, Special Rice & a Lychee Martini.  I decided to pass on dessert today because the portions are amazing and I just don't know where I would put the dessert away.  Dessert here is always A++++. There is also a lunch special available for $38.00  - tax and tip not included.  Try Philippe out for your next lunch. There is also outdoor seating and chill music.",2,1,1
7,Michael N.,"Manhattan, NY",341,79,160,4.0,10/12/2018,"Great Chinese food. Can't say it's worth the price tag for fried rice but the spot is extremely trendy and has a celebrity following. I went here for dinner two years ago and was 10 mins late for my reservation and the hostess was going to turn me away. My girlfriend got a manager and got us an accommodation in one of the wine cellars by the kitchen. We had a nice corner and ordered Surf and Turf. Washed it down with Pellegrino and had Baked Alaska for desert. Waiter was funny and kept everyone entertained.... I recommend going for the experience. If you go , don't be late !!!!! Or else",,,
8,vivian r.,"Fayetteville, NC",53,114,74,5.0,9/16/2018,This was the most delicious Chinese food I've had in a long time. The sea bass was amazing. I really want to go back soon.  There's a really nice atmosphere at Philippe. A great place for happy hour or dinner or lunch. My goddaughter and I ate here before our show at Carnegie. Great decision. Great drinks as well.,,,
9,Stephanie A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1398,568,597,3.0,8/8/2018,"Overrated.I expected to come to Phillipe and be blown away being that this place is mentioned in damn near every rap song but unfortunately I wasn't. Now for the record anyone who knows me knows that I do not fancy Chinese food to begin with in all fairness but this place did absolutely nothing for me. I had the infamous chicken satay and thought that it was mediocre. My entree was less than thrilling as well. The drinks were descent. The vibe was cool but it didn't feel upscale. This place Im sure is watered down by now. It wasn't the worst but certainly wasn't the best. Definitely would not care if I ever came back here. When Rick Ross said ""she thinking Phillipe Im thinking Chipotle"" dont see that much of a difference!",14,9,6
10,Jackie S.,"Staten Island, NY",133,158,519,5.0,8/15/2018,"So happy I stumbled upon them during restaurant week! The lunch special menu was filling and generous. I believe it was around $28 for three courses!  An appetizer , entree and dessert which is super worth it. Cute place setting , there was little porcelain pandas to hold the up chopsticks. To start we ordered the chicken lettuce wraps which were sweet and savory! So delicious. We also ordered the vegetable dumplings. They were great as well. They came out in a cute steam box. For the entree we ordered the crispy beef which was amazing! The sauce is the best thing I have ever tried. The beef was soft and tender not chewy at all. For dessert we ordered the warm brownie with coconut sorbet. Everything was delicious I can't wait to go back.",2,,3
11,Cristina G.,"Brooklyn, NY",182,293,616,4.0,5/19/2018,"I'll admit that I didn't want to like Philippe's. The idea of a super high-end Chinese food restaurant where there is an emphasis on beautiful people seating you and catering to your every need is a little much for me. I'm more low key and casual when it comes to dining out. The idea of spending crazy money on what I thought would be basic fare had me just seeing dollar signs every where. I did not want to like it here just for the simple fact that fancy people come here to feel fancy. I liked it though, I really did. I surprised myself.I came in about 20 minutes before my friend arrived and the hostess (who was beautiful, tall, and wearing one of the tightest black outfits I've ever seen - bless her and her genetics) greeted me immediately. I told her my friend had made a reservation and that I was early. I just wanted to sit by the bar. She smiled and walked me over to an empty seat. Friendly service so far which shocked me. I ordered a glass of wine at the bar while I waited and soon my friend arrived. Our hostess, along with servers in white suits and red ties, escorted us to our table. Very extra but very friendly. We didn't even look at the menu since my friend comes here often. Here's what we ordered:The crispy beef - SO good, would order over and over again ($24 for one person, $54 for 2 people - WHAT??!)The lettuce wraps with chicken which were, again, amazing ($18) and probably one of the cheaper menu items considering the portion sizeThe chicken satay skewers - the signature pink creamy covered chicken with the famous peanut sauce that everyone here orders ($18 for 3 pieces, gasp) and posts to social mediaWe also ordered some forgettable dumpling dish but the name is escaping me since the other dishes blew this one out of the waterVery fancy, very extra, and concluded dinner feeling very stuffed. As we wrapped up our meal, some famous rapper and his entourage sat next to us, or so I was told. His name escapes me because it was ""Lil"" something and I never heard any of his songs. Whatever. I do remember that they ordered the pink chicken though. A crowd pleaser!Dessert was up next - on the house, since the person I was with knew the staff well and frequents this place. I powered through dessert even though I felt like a beached baby seal. They brought out cappuccinos, fruit salad (this was $16 when I checked the menu later), sorbet ($12 when I checked) and a flourless chocolate cake ($14). I was ready to be rolled home since I did DAMAGE on these desserts. They weren't unbelievable or anything, but everything was fresh. Knowing how much these would normally cost, I didn't want anything to go to waste.Shockingly, I think I'd come back for a special occasion. I don't think I could bring myself to make this a habit or become a regular here to the point where I get my own free round of desserts, but I appreciate the quality food and service here... even though it's all a bit extra.",1,3,
12,Farah S.,"Deer Park, NY",168,52,57,4.0,9/6/2018,"I came here on a weekday evening for restaurant week! The service was great and the menu options were great! For the apps we got lo mein and chicken satay, and both were exquisite! I even loved it more than my main (steak). The red velvet cake they had for dessert was also tasty. Overall a great spot, although I wouldn't have come here if it wasn't for the restaurant week deal as the food or atmosphere does not seem worth the price.",,,
13,Abben H.,"Ann Arbor, MI",375,58,150,3.0,3/5/2018,"My sister booked a reservation here for my family while we were staying in NYC. The restaurant has a great vibe and atmosphere with a shiek selection of music and subtle bass thumping in the background. We ordered the peking duck spring rolls, pork soup dumplings, crispy kale, and salt & pepper eggplant as starters. For entrees we got the chilean sea bass, wok seared branzino, crispy beef, and filey mignon.  My favorite dish was definitely the filet mignon and chilean sea bass.While the food was cooked well and tasty, I was a bit unimpressed with it based on the price. I feel like for this price category, there should be more creativity and artistry expressed in the dishes to set them apart from your typical Chinese restaurant. They don't do anything flavor-wise that made me go ""DAMN, that was good."" The presentation was mediocre but since it's dim in the restaurant, you can't see too much detail anyways.I would say that the service was on point. There are a ton of waiters walking around all the time so they make sure that you are taken care of.If you want good, authentic Chinese food, just go to a hole in the wall or family restaurant in Flushing and pay 1/3 the price.",2,,1
14,Michael Z.,"Lyndhurst, NJ",233,531,406,5.0,5/6/2018,"I had an absolute AMAZING time here tonight. Amy, who is in charge of events, and Derek, the manager are absolutely wonderful and helped us have a fabulous complimentary dining experience. My party and I ordered the spare ribs, steamed dumplings sampler, and chicken satay as an appetizer. The satay is hands down the best I've ever had. The peanut cream sauce is delicious. The dumplings were perfectly cooked, and the spare ribs mouth watering. As our entrees we split the lobster lo mein, chicken jo lay, and crispy beef and they were all good. The crispy beef is triple fried and is beyond delicious. For dessert we split the pear tart, chocolate lava cake, and baked Alaska. I'm not a fan of chocolate cake in any way but I actually enjoyed it. I had never had baked Alaska so that was a pleasant surprise - did you know it's ice cream cake!? News to me! It's presentation is super fun. Wrapped in cotton candy and set on Fire it was certainly a treat. I absolutely enjoyed my evening here and will be sure to come back in the future. They can accommodate large parties in several of their private rooms. The wine cellars are my favorite and are perfect for a private dining experience.",,,
15,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,1/26/2018,"As someone who grew up on homecooked Chinese (Sichuan) cuisine, I can see why a lot of diners might shy away from Philippe. The prices are definitely higher than your typical Chinese restaurant, but neither the food nor the dining experience here is typical.I dined here with a larger group so was able to sample a number of dishes. From the appetizers, I would recommend the Chicken Satays which are super tender and served with an addictive peanut sauce. The noodles are also solid, but my preference was for the Vegetable Lo Mein, which are hand-pulled and served with fresh vegetables and cooked in an addictive sauce. The Lobster Noodles were also a seafood lover's delight, with plenty of chunks of real lobster meat.I think where the restaurant really shines is in their Peking Duck, which is carved tableside and there's elements of showmanship and skill from the chef. The skin is crisp and packed with flavor, and the meat has just enough fat to make for a delicious bite. It's served with pancakes, hoisin, and celery, so you can make yourself the perfect Peking Duck wrap. The Beijing Chicken was also a group favorite, featuring tender chicken meat in a bright red sauce.For the dessert: the Cotton Candy Baked Alaska makes for a great closing spectacle, and features a Baked Alaska hidden in a dome of cotton candy. Yes, there's fire, and yes, it's delicious.For special occasions, I'd recommend visiting Philippe for a unique dining experience and a modern take on traditional Chinese dishes.",34,9,22
16,Christine H.,"Manhattan, NY",39,118,142,3.0,8/9/2018,"OK. The food is super mediocre - So sorry to write this. The interior is cool, it's awesome, feels clubby and swanky. The birthday cotton candy baked alaska is incredible. But honestly, the food did not taste great and it was almost bland or not well prepared. I love Chinese food and Asian food in general and I could say I am a foodie in these cuisines. Caters to the American palate perhaps. Highly recommend birthday sparklers and dessert. Not the other food.",,,
17,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",119,301,527,4.0,9/29/2018,"I wish I could give this restaurant 3.5 stars because I had an amazing meal the first time and the second time was just ok. I would definitely recommend ordering the walnut shrimp appetizer. It reminds me of popcorn shrimp with the spicy mayo sauce that you get at Japanese restaurants but at this place they serve huge shrimp. I thought that the lettuce wraps were pretty bland. We got the dumpling sampler and my favorite was the shrimp by far. The ribs were also very good and a big portion. The sauce on the chicken satay is amazing but I didn't love the texture of the chicken this time. For our main dishes we got the crispy duck, Kung pao chicken, crispy beef and pork fried rice. The table really enjoyed the crispy duck and I liked the flavor of the Kung pao chicken but it seemed a little over cooked. The sauce on the crispy beef was strange as it was so sticky. Also the fried rice was just ok.",,,

Updated review","They have redeemed themselves where not only did we have our duck, but we got to bring the remainder home.

22,Shantelle C.,"New York, NY",53,190,958,4.0,2/16/2018,"My boyfriend decided that for Valentine's Day, this year, we would go to Philippe by Philippe Chow! I WAS SO EXCITED!!! Now, let me tell you about our experience...When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess and taken to our table upstairs, which probably was the most cramped area. We asked to be moved to a different table, as they put us between two tables and we were so close to the other tables that it felt like we were sitting with the people next to us on both sides. They accommodated us with no problem. Now lets move on to the food... My boyfriend had the chicken satay to start; he was not a fan. He told me that the chicken had no flavor and the sauce tasted like melted peanut butter. To me, it looked disgusting (HAHAHA, do not tell him I said that!) I chose not to have my own appetizer. Now, they had a main course and the special valentines day menu. One item on the Valentine's day menu which we ordered was the bottle of Rosè. Something I found strange was they never left the bottle by our table in a bucket of ice; instead they took it with them to who knows where... maybe even helped themselves! I really mean this, since the bottle only had like three and a half servings/refills of a champagne glass.The main courses were really good. I had the Beijing Chicken (minus the walnuts) and egg fried rice. My chicken was EVERYTHING! It even tasted amazing the next day!My boyfriend had the Spicy Pepper Mignon with chicken fried rice; he loved it. The garlic sauce was marvelous! HAHAHAHA!",,,

Seems like a very popular location so it can get a bit loud at times.Food was good, however the Lychee martini was a bit too sweet for my liking. My favorites were the crispy duck salad and the vegetable fried rice.The chocolate layered cake and coconut sorbet dessert was rich and decadent, and the perfect ending to a night of indulgence.",,,
25,Marie S.,"New York, NY",55,263,190,4.0,6/28/2018,"Making me drool, just remembering the Chicken Satay! Best ever! And I don't even like it usually. I only ordered it because it was one of the choices on the Prix Fixe lunch menu (please see the menu photo I uploaded from a week ago). As for the rest of the meal, the Crispy Orange Beef was the biggest disappointment. To describe the experience, imagine spaghetti thin strands of beef rolled in dense thick soggy fried dough with a tangy greasy orange sauce. Honestly, I've had better versions of this dish at my local Chinese restaurant. That shouldn't be. On the other hand, the dessert was delicious. I ordered the Warm Cocoa Brownie with coconut sorbet, strawberries and fresh whipped cream. The sorbet was especially good, perfect texture and balanced, not overly sweet. Very very good. Ambience - enjoyed the intimate atmosphere & cute Panda chopstick holders. Waitstaff attentive but not pretentious. Felt very comfortable. Nice diverse crowd, like seeing that. Seemed everyone was being treated with equal consideration. Like seeing that too. I guess my only complaint (and this is a complaint about restaurants in general) is that the waiter was Russian (I was curious so I asked) but the staff cleaning up were all Latino or minority. This bothers me especially now with everything going on in the world... Don't like seeing divisions of any kind & I'm beginning to notice them everywhere. Makes no sense & needs to change.",,,1
26,Merlin C.,"Manhattan, NY",245,576,74,4.0,4/14/2018,"Philippe is what you think the awful Mr. Chow is, and it has some of the best Peking duck in the city. In case you can't tell, I've been using the past few months to comprehensively assess -- both in NYC and nationwide -- the best Peking duck on offer. Phillipe ranks high. As high as Hakkasan? It's tough, and I need to meditate a little more. But what we had was pretty sublime and unbelievable, and it beats the Price to Portions Ratio (P2P) at Hakkasan. Perfect cutting and distribution of the lean and the fatty, the crispy and the squishy on the skin.The rest of the meal? Ehhhh.... Dumpling sampler was insulting from a P2P perspective. We're talking 5 dumplings. I could get 25 of these at Golden Unicorn -- with the same quality -- for the same price. Handpulled noodles were OK but nothing special, and again, outrageous P2P. I ate the whole thing in 3 gulps. Sweet and sour chicken was a joke and tasted like anything you could order from your typical greasy spoon corner joint. What?!Another issue that ultimately prevents a vaunted #MerlinFIVE: poor logistics. We had a reservations at 8 PM but nobody seemed to know when we'd get seated. One hostess said that we'd be seated ""soon,"" but ""soon"" never really arrived. Then another dude promptly walked by casually and took care of everything. What?!  Get it together, ""Phillipe.""

29,Jennifer L.,"El Monte, CA",309,109,79,2.0,3/21/2018,"Unfortunately, I would describe this restaurant as an overrated overpriced Chinese restaurant.. My friends and I were visiting New York and really wanted to come here for the Peking Duck, regardless of the ""okay"" reviews it had. We definitely learned the hard way why; food and service was not up to par and everything was overpriced. We ordered: Peking Duck $75 (4/5) it was good, but overpriced (Average price for Peking duck is $50). *Tip*: We called in to pre-order it as it takes 45-60 minutes to prepare.Hot and sour soup $10 (2/5) it was okay and overpricedChicken Flat Noodle $18 (0/5) bland and overpricedChicken Satay Skewers $18 (2/5) meh, overpricedCotton Candy Baked Alaska $18 (4/5) this was good, probably the only thing I can see matching its price point.Service (0/10) absolutely horrible, for a fine dining restaurant you would expect the service to be above average. Our waiter barely paid any attention to us as he was too busy trying to suck up to the table next to us. Basically gave us the impression that we were not good enough for his service even though we ordered one of the most expensive dishes on the menu.

30,Veronica V.,"Queens, NY",172,74,53,3.0,4/3/2018,Came with a small group of friends and my first tip is to be on time for your reservation because they will not seat you until whole party is present.  Of course I was the one that was late.  In general I wasn't very impressed by the menu options.  It looks like they are overcharging for regular Chinese cuisine.  I opted for the crab legs which were very fresh and tasty.  All sides had to be ordered separately. Very impressed with my dish however was not overly impressed with my friend's dishes.,3,,
31,Correy K.,"Brooklyn, NY",160,135,28,3.0,3/9/2018,"Let me start off by-- HOW DO YOU OVER COOK WHITE RICE? Or dare serve plain white rice at these prices?Warning- It just gets worse.I must say I felt rushed to order and complete my meal since the waiter was going off lunch duty.  He kept disturbing and standing over me and I had to ask him to give me space. I can say for what I was spending it was NOT a good idea. I loved my chicken satay and my friend said his hot and sour soup was perfect. The chicken noodle is over priced and just mediocre. The chicken with walnuts is dry and could be candied walnuts! However, I was not pleased with the overcooked crispy steak and had it made over. The brownie with coconut ice cream was nothing special. The whipped cream was just  okay. The bathroom was dirty, the floor was very nasty and I used it after one of the cooks. It was very dark in the bathroom and up a few steps- I don't know how handicapped or wheel chairs would be treated here, as the eating area is down stairs. When you walk in the place looks dark and closed. The modern soft rock music played through the meal which I found odd it wasn't more cultural. There were plain tables with white tablecloths very close together and we were seated so close to the next door couple -- I felt like it was privacy invasion!! There were plenty of other empty tables. There was a long bench seat along the wall and I was in the  crack of the pillows feeling unbalanced till the neighbors left and  I  was able to move my table. The food is costly lunch- we actually had the $28 lunch special-if I went to Chinatown it would have been $28 for both of us with FREE TEA! If that was included no one offered.For the price and  the neighborhood: I would have loved to be WOWed by a special meal or presentation. Nothing rated to give that OH- Look, I am eating Food on East 60St and its so special. The place looked more like it was saving on electricity and rushing to get us out. I was even still eating and they were so eager to say-- are you ready for us to prepare desert. Like seriously.... there was a party of 8 -- that sat after us and was getting their food as I was eating.Adding in: My friend gave the server $5 for recooking my meal When I gave the bill back- the same server asked to I want change. Yea, sure take another $7. How much tip do they think they deserve when he wasn't even the original Server? {0.15 x $48.00=$7.20}. You didn't do much but annoy me. You deserve $12 that's over 20% - Over Priced tips and food. mhm... makes me wonder.... Also, I didnt see Al Sharpton dining on 3/8.",5,1,

We ended with chicken noodles...I ate way to much but I just couldn't stop! The chocolate cake with coconut ice cream wasn't as good as its description. Others around us ordered the Baked Alaska.

For entrees, we ordered the Chilean sea bass, wok-seared branzino, filet mignon, crispy beef, and vegetable lo mein.Everything was good - my family loved the Chilean sea bass and the filet mignon, and I was quite impressed with the eggplant. But for such a high price point, I expected great across the board - especially in terms of the flavor profile and presentation. The crispy kale was bona fide kale chips on a plate, and the vegetable lo mein was not that far off from what you could get at your local takeout place. I do wish they had a couple extra vegetarian items on their menu, as I basically covered the full gambit in my order.There was always someone nearby to take care of our every need. Service was on point, and I felt like at some points there were double the number of waiters than there were people at our table. Because of the high cost of our bill, I had correspondingly high expectations and the full dining experience didn't live up to the hype. Especially given the limited plant-based options, I probably would look elsewhere for Chinese food.EDIT: The day after posting this review, the general manager reached out to me saying that he and Chef Philippe would personally take care of me the next time I came to visit. I always appreciate when the restaurant cares enough to engage with their customers, so I give them credit for this personal touch.",1,,1

Updated review","This is one of my fav restaurants. I've been coming here for 10 years. Food is always perfect and on point. My server is always excellent(I forgot his name) but I always get him when seated in the back to the left. Although I do feel this place was more exclusive and higher end a few years back, not sure why they lost a bit of their touch. The restaurant has some minor flaws appearance wise. I noticed the floors were in need of touching up (the GM did reach out after this original review and said they are scheduled to be redone Memorial Day weekend) and small minor details. However years ago this place used to be a Gem and it seemed so much more classier. It may be I have noticed more about the restaurant because today was my first lunch experience. Overall still great and will be coming back!!",,,
36,Kwesi D.,"East Orange, NJ",75,1,0,5.0,10/24/2018,"The food and dessert was exquisite. No complaints whatsoever. Staff was amiable, lovely ambiance, and great food. Definitely one of my favorite place to eat!!!",,,
37,Jeremy W.,"Queens, NY",1514,243,883,3.0,7/12/2017,"I never understood the hype behind Philippe chow. I've came here on numerous occasions and the food is nothing special at all. This is one of those resteraunt's were you're paying for the name. I swear people make such a big deal out of this place and make it more then what it is due to the celebrity hype surrounding this resteraunt.The service here is top notch i can't deny that, but when your paying close to $500 for a party of 4 for some over priced Chinese food it damn right better be. This food is the same food you can get at any great Thai or upscale Chinese resteraunt. There's really no difference in my opinion. The ambiance and decor is top notch and it is a beautiful resteraunt located on the upper east side, not to far from central park. Other then the service here their's really no ""It"" factor when it comes to Philippe chows. Is there always celebrity's here? Absolutely, every time i've came to eat here there has been big name people in this resteraunt and the list goes on when it comes to big name people. I have been coming here for years and my right hand friend's friend Darwin use to manage here, so it was always a walk through and love.The food is decent, but like i've stated earlier the prices here are ridicules and the food is nothing special. The wait staff also is hit or miss and even though service is great, you can also get that one waiter who caters to you all day, but expects a outrageous tip because thats what he's accustomed to. I use to come to Philippe chow when you was able to smoke bud in the basement cellar and this going back 2-3 years. Yes you heard right, if you was a some body or knew someone you could do anything in this resteraunt, which was mind boggling to me my first time coming here with my boy, bit that came to a end with people started complaining about the smell of marijuana :). What I do like about Philippe is its a huge resteraunt with upstairs, down stairs, and a beautiful wine cellar in the basement thats very intimate for date's and special events. They also have a beautiful full bar on the ground level with multiple sides to eat on the main level. The upstairs is amazing as well. If you don't mind spending a couple of hundred of Chinese food i guess you'll enjoy this place. The portions here are minuscule, so their's no just ordering rice and a entree and only spending $ 100 dollars. You're coming out of you pocket here, but if you're coming here for a special dinner its worth it. You cant put money on a love one's birthday or anniversary, but if you're  just coming here to eat, you're better off going else where. You'll get your money worth some where else and for half the price. Overall this place is over priced Chinese fusion at its best. If you're groupie coming here to eat and see 50 cent or someone famous you'll love it, but for me this place is average at it's best.",23,16,16

39,Weich Y.,"New York, NY",20,280,6170,5.0,3/29/2018,Love love their Peking duck and the stir fried flat rice noodles with chicken  they make a great vodka dirty martini too and they use quality olives. This time we tried the filet mignon with snow peas - the sauce is so good (make sure you mop it up with lots of fluffy rice). I've tried all their dessert now but you must get the warm chai spice pear tart. Forget about the bomb Alaska. The tart is where it's at ‍‍‍,,,
40,kristine m.,"Manhasset, NY",204,73,1451,5.0,2/11/2018,Amazing experience dining in the private wine cellar last night. You are escorted through the kitchen to a back staircase which leads you below the kitchen to find two private wine rooms. The rooms are intimate and exclusive. We had the pleasure of meeting Philippe Chow as well! Everything was delicious! The crispy kale and peanut sauce with the chicken and beef satay was unreal. The salt and pepper calamari was so tasty and perfect. The green prawns and Chilean sea bass were amazing. The best was the dessert! The cake was enclosed within cotton candy and then ignited with fire to burn down and reveal the cake. What a treat! Service was excellent. Definitely a hands down 5 star restaurant!,1,,

I would definitely come again.",1,1,1
43,Nathalia N.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",22,18,29,3.0,10/20/2018,"Maybe I had higher expectations and was disappointed.  However, there are other dishes I want to try and will go back. We ordered 1. shrimp spring roll: thin, crispy exterior and 2 bland shrimp inside - definitely use the sauce. 2. Shrimp dumpling nothing special3. Pork fried rice - stood out because it's a good portion in a small deep dish and didn't have any oil. It was missing something...flavor, onions, scallions4. Kung pao chicken: chicken chunks, with a sweet sauce, scallion, peanuts and pepper somehow it was still bland. 5. Lastly Peking duck, no flavor, off course full of fat, and it didn't have crispy skin.The food was fast, attentive service,white cloth table give it's a classy ambiance, candle on the table and the cutest chopsticks holder (panda).",,,

But the fried rice was bland, the lo mein was actually not good. And everything is way over priced for what it is.

The server was very knowledgeable and very attentive. We did have a lot of drinks and the environment wasn't well suited for that during the day given the fact that we did get a lot of stares from people each time we ordered our drinks. They do have an amazing lunch special which includes a drink an appetizer and an entree. The food was OUTSTANDING. The chicken satay sticks we had heard so much about exceeded our expectations. Everything was delicious the lettuce wraps the ribs and the orange chicken exceeded expectations. Prices for lunch were very very reasonable the food was amazing. Will deff be back with a large group of people.",2,,
51,Nikki B.,"Far Rockaway, NY",0,34,15,4.0,9/8/2018,First; let me start off by saying Yes the food is tasty.  I made reservations for 10pm I arrived a few minutes early. The hostess informed us that there was a little wait so we could either sit at the bar or sit in the little waiting area until they call us. The bar tender didn't not have us waiting long so that was a plus. I had the I had the Philippe passion drink that was ok m y date had the Midnight Mojito which was ok. So once our table was ready the hostess came over to me and said your table is ready you can bring your drinks up stairs but you have to close out the Bill. Her not knowing  it was already closed out as soon as we ordered So that annoyed me a little bit. Don't assume the bill was not going to be paid. Now as we were sitting around downstairs waiting I notice all the Caucasian entering the restaurant were walking in and being seated down stairs. Now It's time for me and  2 other African American couples to be seated and of course they Sat us UPSTAIRS. along with another African American Couple that was already up there.  (Not to make it  a race thing; but more of a being observant of what is going on) The only good thing about that was that it was more of an intimate setting since there were not a lot of people seated up stairs.  Since it was my birthday I didn't mind.  Now the great thing was how attentive our waiter was to all of the customers seated in the same area. I wish I could remember his name.  On another note I had the red dragon rose sangria that was really good.  I tried the shrimp satays they were also good and the Vegetable lomein was good as well. My date really enjoyed the  sweet and sour chicken.  So overall it wasn't a bad experience. Would I go back Yes but it's no rush!,1,,
52,Natasha R.,"New York, NY",1,21,1,3.0,8/13/2018,"Dined here during restaurant week on 8/10/2018 and I'm glad I chose to come where the prices are a little cheaper... 6 ppl in total and it came up to $450 the food is just overpriced Chinese food... I feel like you are paying for the name.. 4/6 of us ordered the fillet mignon and each ordered the steak differently (well done,medium rare) But when the food was bought out to us they just called out the name of the dish and didn't specify which was which... major downer. And for such an expensive restaurant u would think they have that all together. The desert however was delicious. I had the fudge cake with ice cream and the ice cream was salted. I never had ice cream that tasted like salt lol... I probably wouldn't go here again. I'm glad I got to experience going but never gonna spend my money again... I'm a real foodie...

We also tasted the Shanghai Philippe cocktail for the first time and were not impressed so we went back to our usual, him an apple martini, and me a lychee martini..

I order the peking duck spring rolls and they were really tasty.  The added crunch of the wonton wrappers made them even better than regular peking duck because he gave it an added texture.  I understand the lobster main dish is a 2 1/2 lb lobster.  I will have to try that next time I go.Damn Al just looked up from his conversation ...

My friend and I came here and they were literally at our side. We shared four things which were the chicken satay, chicken lettuce wraps, vegetable fried rice and the shrimp dumplings. Satay is just crazy that's all I can say. Shrimp dumplings steamed had a whole shrimp in each one! Fried rice nice and flavorful and the chicken lettuce wraps were super light and delicious.

62,Nickie R.,"Houston, TX",45,182,248,2.0,8/13/2017,"I wish my experience was better here but the food wasn't good. The chicken satay tasted like something you'd get served on an airplane or hospital. The peanut sauce on top had no flavor and as it was paired with non crispy flavorless chicken, so the entire dish was texturally off. I got the velvet chicken as an entree and the chicken was overly mushy & tasted like it came from a soup can. My friend got the nine seasons special prawns and she couldn't eat it, the sauce was terrible and the shrimp were hard like it was over fried. The only reason I'm not giving a 1 star is because the drinks were decent and the bar tender was attentive so A+ for service. Save your $ and go eat elsewhere.",3,,2
63,Simone W.,"Bloomfield, NJ",158,109,259,3.0,8/3/2017,"Unfortunately issa 3 stars for me ! In honor of restaurant week 2017 we put philippe's at the top of our list. This was definitely one of those places I looked at with high regard. This place has a lot of celebrity buzz but I was definitely not impressed at all. The service sucked , there was no warmth or personality. The waiter was extremely rude , he didn't want to explain anything to us even though we explained to him it was our first visit here. He never once came over to check on us. We had two encounters with him. He took the order  and he brought the check simple he didn't earn that $35 tip but I digress shawty! The food was BOMB and that's was the only thing that kept me sane. I didn't waste my time ordering any alcohol after reading reviews about the drinks and they were super OVER priced  not surprised at all. The food though listen , the chicken satay tasted like chicken cheetos on a stick and I say that in the most amazing way it had such a familiar taste to it so good ! The szechuan pork and shrimp dumplings took my taste buds on a ride. Don't get me started with the 9 seasons prawns those are not for the weak OK they are SPICY and will take you to the moon or bathroom depending on how your stomach works. For dinner I chose the Beijing chicken and it did not disappoint now that basic ass jasmine rice they give you "" complimentary"" with every meal they can keep. We had to order a separate order of chicken fried rice for $14 bucks that did feed 3 people but trust it wasn't a lot. If you want glorified Chinese food then ok come here if not keep walking right by.",2,6,3

65,Amber B.,"Hudson County, NJ",713,309,861,3.0,12/26/2016,"To me, this place is all hype and that's it. When you're paying Philippe Chow prices for a dinner for two you would expect to have an over the top meal. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case when I dined here. To start, I ordered the Guns and Roses drink which was horrible (way too strong and bland). My bf went with a blue moon and that's standard so it was fine. For the appetizer, we went with the chicken Won Ton soup and I really wanted to like it but it lacked so much flavor. The soup tasted a bit watered down. I mean to be honest here, I've had better at local mom and pop take out place. We also ordered the chicken satay and again that was a miss for me. I wasn't a big fan of the peanut sauce for one and the meat wasn't satisfying. For the entree we ordered the shrimp fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. (Because by that time I didn't want to deal with anymore disappointment) I just wasn't a fan of this place at all. I will say the service was good, our waiter was very nice and pleasant so that's where the bulk of my three stars came from. Also,  the front door girls are extremely unwelcoming. You're covering a nice restaurant -- learn how to properly greet your guest and spend less time on your cell phone.

Of course the prices are going to be higher and the food isn't the most ""authentic,"" but Americanized Chinese food can still be very delicious and nuanced. The location, the service, the ingredients used, and the decor justify the higher prices.The chicken satay is very good to start off the meal. The steamed fish is amazing as well and you can tell that the fish is fresh. The tuna tartare was equally excellent. We've tried most of the menu, but definitely go for the duck. For $78 you get an entire duck -- not a bad deal to split with a group. Finally, the desserts are delicious as well. Order the baked Alaska for a cool snapchat story.",2,,1

I started off with a patron margarita then I tried the chicken satay & veggie dumplings which I loved! I normally don't like peanut sauce but the sauce on the chicken satay was very delicious and didn't taste at all like peanuts. For the main course I got the crispy orange beef. When I tell you I will be back for that beef !!!!! I will be back for that 100 percent. It was small crispy pieces cooked just right. We had the cotton candy dessert and it was lit on fire.

I really liked the vegetable spring rolls and steamed vegetable  dumplings. I wasnt a big fan of the chicken satay or the peanut sauce drizzled on it. For entrees: i had the Kung Pao Chicken.

One of my friends was not feeling her  house mignon meal. I alerted the waiter and he exchanged her meal with the Kung Pao Chicken -- with no issue.

74,Sash S.,"New York, NY",108,66,25,2.0,5/1/2017,Very very mediocre Chinese food - I had the chicken satay and the crispy beef with sweet orange and carrot sauce. Both were very poor. The stay wasn't tender and the peanut sauce was not visually appealing. The beef was crispy but was shredded resulting in very little meat. Finished off with vanilla ice cream - tasted like the average ice cream at a supermarket. The only thing that was decent was the service.,4,1,1

Chicken satay with peanut sauce that's delicious enough to drink was the most surprising part of the meal. Who really expects to be blown away by peanut sauce? That night, I was. The lettuce wraps were phenomenal, as was the standout of the night- Peking duck. This, of course, is not a casual meal that can be casually consumed on a random Wednesday night (unless you have the type of bankroll that permits that, in which case, congrats!) This is definitely a special meal that feels celebratory in every way. The service, as expected, is top notch and attentive without being overbearing.

I was blown away at every delectable bite of food I ate. The Chicken Satay is other worldly. Crispy yet the tender chicken in a red bean paste and the peanut sauce perfectly balanced. The Beijing Chicken has a great texture and the red sauce is sweet and sour and sooo good.  The Bronzino was delicious. The hot garlic taste is so refreshing. The shrimp fried rice was perfect and the green beans were perfectly cooked. Firm but tender and quite flavorful. Anyone looking for some out of this world not your local takeout Chinese should definitely eat here.,1,,

85,Carlen Z.,"New York, NY",267,14,67,2.0,8/13/2017,"Just another testament to the disparity between OpenTable ratings and reality. I had super high hopes for Philippe when I booked a reservation during Restaurant Week for me and my parents for my dad's birthday-- an upscale Chinese restaurant with so much acclaim was something new and exciting for us. It was a change of pace from the restaurants of Flushing and Chinatown, which tended to be more on the crowded, slightly dingy side. But I'll take a dingy, crowded restaurant/food court in Flushing or Chinatown any day if it means I'll get delicious Chinese food out of it. Philippe might be a place of white-coated waiters, and sleek, well-manicured hostesses, but they are not fooling anyone with this food (well, except some celebrities, apparently). I want to reiterate that we ordered from the Restaurant Week dinner menu-- maybe Philippe's normal dishes are different, but the food we got was not something I expected out of a place as highly acclaimed as Philippe. Appetizer:The tuna tartare appetizer was beautiful and tasted just as great, but the spinach salad looked like someone just dumped a bag of spinach into a bowl and brought it over. The Peking duck rolls were not much different from your standard egg roll, aside from the tiniest bits of duck meat inside. Definitely more egg roll than Peking duck, imo.Entrees: Filet mignon, Peking chicken, spicy prawnsThe star in this course was the filet mignon. The serving was pretty generous and the meat had a nice texture and wasn't too chewy. The spicy prawns, on the other hand, were lukewarm and basically just some fried nuggets thrown on top of a bed of what seemed like duck sauce with chili flakes (???). Lastly, the Peking chicken. Maybe I lack the nuanced palate to make any judgments, but this tasted no different from sweet and sour chicken you'd find elsewhere (sorry). I guess what also irks me is the labeling of Peking chicken when there is no indication of what makes it ""Peking"". Peking duck needs no explanation but what is Peking chicken??Dessert: Dark chocolate layer cake, fortune cookie red velvet cake, assorted ice cream and sorbetDefinitely Philippe's redeeming factor. The chocolate cake was not too sweet (that sounds like a bad thing but it's actually perfect in conjunction with the other two sugary dishes), and not too big either. The assorted ice cream and sorbet came with mango sorbet, raspberry sorbet, and vanilla ice cream-- the sorbets were very refreshing and not too tart, and the vanilla was... you know, vanilla. Aaaand the fortune cookie red velvet cake. I have to be honest-- I was most excited for this part of the meal. The fusion of an American classic with a Chinese-American classic sounded like a really fascinating and promising dish, but alas, it was the most disappointing one. I kid you not: it was a red velvet cake. Covered with red sprinkles. With one fortune cookie plopped on top. And a Pocky stick stabbed through the middle. I still think it has potential to be developed, but at its current stage... I have nothing else to say.Service was pretty good. I was disappointed in the 20-minute wait time, despite having a reservation and being there on time (my parents were literally two minutes late, but still). The service otherwise was pretty wonderful, and the waiters and busboys were very attentive. So if you wanna feel like (or are) a posh celebrity dining on mediocre, overpriced Americanized Chinese food-- sure, come to Philippe. Otherwise, take your money to Flushing or Chinatown.",2,,1
86,Jouleya R.,"Union City, NJ",1,18,5,1.0,7/27/2017,"I came here for my babes birthday... when I made the reservation through open table I:1. made a note to put candles and sing happy birthday when we order dessert2. Called and said it was a birthday dinner3. Pulled the waiter to the side and reminded him to add candles and sing happy birthdayWell none of that mattered because THEY FORGOT. To make it even worse they didn't even light there famous dessert on fire in front of the birthday boy, they did it behind him and then slammed it on the table. I will never come here for anyone's birthday. I was so disappointed in the lack of effort for the special night. I'd also like to add that they put us in the back room and the AC was on full blast it was like a refrigerator we couldn't enjoy the food because it was too cold. Ever single person that came in complained to the waitstaff including the men.  Smh Complete fail for this birthday dinner.",4,,
87,Emery G.,"Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ",422,330,2484,3.0,2/20/2016,"Came here on Valentine's Day. We had no problems reserving a table. They warn you that if you cancel after the day before your reservation it's $50. No problem. There is a parking garage around the block that I parked in. $50 for the 35 min. Haha New York you're so silly, for real! This does not reflect my review just saying parking is near. So came in about ten minutes early and was greeted by the hostess. Waited about 5 min until our table was ready. The waiting area is a lounge and it's very comfortable. Escorted down to the back room. Great atmosphere. The decor is very elegant yet subtle. Classy. The tables are snug but bearable. The drink menu has plenty of options, pages and pages. The dinner menu is simple and self explanatory. Knew to try the chicken satay appetizer. After that we just winged it and ordered chicken and broccoli, chicken jo lau, and chicken fried rice. The chicken satay was out of this world. That peanut sauce that it comes with I can just eat with sown white rice. It's so creamy and rich it can be paired with something so simple and make it amazing. It really is his famous sauce. The chicken being orange gave me the impression that it would be seasoned but it wasn't that much. Not overpowering at all. It was delicious. Wish we just ordered a bunch of those with some rice. It would have been perfect. The main entrees were honestly not impressive at all. Could have been that we ordered the wrong things but to order three wrong things hmm. The chicken fried rice had no flavor at all. Even with the eggs and vegetables in it. Same with the chicken and broccoli. There is supposedly garlic sauce on it but didn't taste a thing. Yes it's great quality chicken. Not that paper thin chicken from the Chinese spots but no flavor at all. The chicken jo lau was a little bit better than the rest because the sauce tasted like a buttery garlic sauce. But it left a weird aftertaste flavor in our mouths like bitter garlic almost. At this point we were thinking we were just better off going to the corner Chinese spot. Also this place is inconsistent. Our dining experience was lovely. The service was on point. Attentive waiters who fill your water glass when almost empty. They clear the tables once done in a timely manner. We got our food in about 10 min after sitting down and ordering. Our reservation was at 4pm and we left the restaurant at 4:30pm. Sounds like we were being pigs but we just got our food super fast. BUT the table right next to us who were sat way before us didn't get their food as quick and their order was messed up. Also on Valentine's Day everyone leaves with a rose. I didn't get one. I would give this place another shot in the future possibly.",4,2,5
88,Loanne N.,"Short Hills, NJ",378,35,34,2.0,8/15/2017,"Don't waste your time here. Food is overpriced and bland. It's an upscale Chinese restaurant that's unnecessarily upscale. Save your time calories and money and head to Chinatown for $7 dishes that taste way better than here. We came here on a Friday night. It was pretty busy, with an intimate setting and white table cloths. The only reason I give it two stars is because it wasn't terrible food, it just wasn't good either and definitely not worth the prices. Also being Asian I have higher expectations for Asian food. Had it been cheaper I would've given them another star, but for these prices I expect great food. For appetizer, we ordered the vegetable wrap, chicken skewers, & the Peking duck rolls. The vegetable wrap was bland, chicken skewers were an ungodly color of orange, and the rolls were way too oily. For entree, the only thing that was decent and eatable and somewhat tasty was the Bronzino fish. Dessert we tried the mochi, fortune cookie red velvet cake, and another chocolate cake. Mochi was fine (can't really screw up mochi but you can probably get the same ones in the freezer isle of a supermarket). The fortune cookie cake was a red velvet cake covered in red sprinkles with pocky and a fortune cookie on top. Nothing special there either and tasted cheap especially with all the sprinkles. I can say that service was amazing here and they were very attentive. But other than that, I would never come here again. If you want an authentic experience for chinese food, go to Chinatown. You won't get the fancy upscale experience, but you'll get an authentic one.",1,,1

Salt & Pepper calamari is a tad bit too salty but good quality. The Peking duck was absolutely amazing!!!!

A trendy restaurant with a chic interior that absolutely lives up to all of the hype is a rarity in NYC. It is spot on, each and every single time I go. Let me first start by saying the service is grade A, waiters with impeccable manors are extremely attentive and always within a glance away. The chicken satay and beef satay are a MUST along with the lettuce wrap (chicken). The portions are actually decently sized and the mixture of spices and zangy tastes will have you writing your own yelp review. Kung pao chicken and crispy beef are JUST as good of mains as the Satay's and lettuce wraps are for appetizers. When you go out to eat you expect the best- Philippe will be worth every penny, even down to the tip.",,,

The private room allowed ample space for the nearly 30 of us to chat and mingle with a glass of wine in hand. We sat down to a fixed family style meal with several courses. Our appetizers were my favorite course, with vegetable spring rolls, duck spring rolls, spare ribs (my favorite dish of the night), steamed dumplings, ginger salad, and shrimp dumplings. The pork dumplings, although a bit watery (that is my overall opinion on steamed dumplings in general, not specific to Philippe), were presented in a traditional basket and were obviously crafted with such precision and care. They were beautiful to look at. Our main courses included filet mignon and green beans, chicken and broccoli, lobster with ginger sauce, Chilean sea bass, and Peking duck. The filet mignon was my favorite dish, as you got the familiar taste but with a much higher quality cut of beef. The lobster was just okay, I didn't find the meat to be super flavorful but the sauce was quite tasty in moderation. The Peking duck was served traditionally and had a perfect crisp to the skin. The only dish I didn't care for as much was the chicken and broccoli, which didn't seem to differentiate itself from any other Chinese restaurant.For dessert, we had a chocolate cake, scoops of sorbet in coconut, mango, and passion fruit flavors, and the fortune cookie cake.

Hint: their lunch special is a lot of food and is very affordable! I almost always order the same things when I'm here so I'll list my personal picks:1. Chicken Satays - you must have this. You can't leave without having an order of this!2. Peking Duck3. Pork Soup Dumplings4. Spare Ribs5. Chicken lettuce wraps (if you want to go on the lighter side)6. Crispy beef - my favorite dish!!!!!!I also always order the litchee martini. Can't go wrong.",3,,
124,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1009,377,1497,4.0,2/4/2016,"*This review is only for drinks and dishes at the bar*Upscale Chinese restaurant with a nice high-end bar area in the front.  Been coming here regularly over the past few years for after-work drinks, and finally decided to do a review.  Met some ex-coworkers here for drinks and food in the front bar area and as usual, the service and food are really good.  Technically they're not allowed to serve main dishes at the bar (only appetizers), however, they make a special exception for us, which is great.Cocktails are pretty good and they have a decent wine list as well, given that wine pairing with Chinese food is fairly hard to do, due to the soy flavors, spiciness, etc.  So, I was surprised and happy to see that they had JJ Prum on the menu, who is an excellent German producer of Riesling (off-dry), and it paired perfectly with the food.  At the bar, we shared these plates:Chicken Satay with Chef Chow's Famous Peanut Sauce- THIS DISH IS THE BOMB.  Whatever you do, ORDER THIS DISH, it's SIMPLY AMAZING.  Once again, if you only get one thing here, GET THE CHICKEN SATAY.  It's CRAZY CRAZY GOOD!  Like nothing you've ever had before.Mayonnaise Prawns with Candied Walnuts- This is the 2nd BEST DISH on the menu.  Also, make sure you order this.  Sounds strange to order a dish with mayonnaise on shrimp, but I assure you, YOU WILL BE HAPPY YOU DID.Lettuce Wraps- they were fairly standard and nothing to write home about compared to the two dishes above.  I'd almost go as far to say that I enjoy the wraps at P.F. Changs better.  But oh well, you can't win them all.  Just stick with the Chicken Satay & the Mayonnaise Shrimp, that's all you need!Peking Duck Spring Rolls- were pretty good, but again, nothing to write home about.  I mean, they're fried spring rolls, and taste pretty standard across most Chinese restaurants.  Stick with the first two dishes I mentioned.So, I haven't had a sit-down meal here yet, but from those two awesome dishes above, you probably can't go wrong.  Just be aware that this isn't your run-of-the-mill Chinese spot.  It's high-end and attracts a business clientele along with a music industry (hip hop) clientele, which sounds odd...but we were here once when Jay Z & Beyonce were here, and, another time when Russell Simmons was here, so you get the idea.  Also a great place to grab a drink after-work, But as with most upscale spots in Midtown, it's not cheap, but worth it.  I recommend it.",9,3,7

126,Celine T.,"Manhattan, NY",148,19,19,5.0,2/16/2017,"Came here for my birthday dinner and definitely was not disappointed.  I've eaten at Philippe a few times prior to my birthday, but I haven't been back in years!  The atmosphere is chic and romantic with dim lighting and intimate setting. Regarding food, I would recommend to start with the chicken and beef satays and lettuce wraps.  The portions are made for sharing so it can fill you up before your entrees arrive.  As a main course, we ordered the crunchy beef, kung pao chicken and mixed fried rice. We definitely ordered a little too much (or we just didn't bring enough of our appetite!) because we ended up taking home a doggy bag.  Nonetheless, the food was delicious and memorable. When it came to dessert, it was like a mini live show right in front of our table.  Our waiter brought out this plate of what appeared to be a huge fluff of cotton candy.  Then he began to torch the outside of it, and as it melted there was a strawberry shortcake-type of cake inside! And trust me, the dessert tasted as good as it looked. I think what made Philippe stand out from other NYC restaurants, was their impeccable service.  From the busboys, to our waiter and even the floor manager, everyone was so friendly and attentive to our needs.  We felt right at home and the staff really went out of their way to make my birthday a memorable one!",1,1,
127,Lucy L.,"Washington, DC",8,44,40,3.0,4/23/2017,"Second time here....the service is great! The food however was a bit of a disappointment this time around. Started with the modern Mai Tai which was average but could've been stronger. Can't go wrong with the  chicken satay....loved it! Ordered the prawns and crispy chicken. When it came out, it was a late full of friend shrimp and chicken...huh? No sauce on it and it was very salty. Usually I send stuff like that back but since I dined with someone new, I chalked it up and ate what I could. Tried the steamed snapper which was flavorful. The vegetable fried rice wasn't hitting it for me so I'll pass next time. Don't think I would be a future diner here",,,
128,Kristina B.,"Lindenhurst, NY",5,3,4,1.0,7/17/2017,"To whole this may concern, Greetings, I would like to share with you my experience at this restaurant on 6/18/17. The experience was terrible, the customer service specifically. When my family and I arrived, we checked in and was told we would be seated next, I watched multiple parties come in and get seated before us. I went back to the check in podium about 20 minutes after I was told to wait to see what the status was and I was told that I had not been checked in. THEN!! When we were going to be seated we were offered seats in the wine cellar... I accepted because I did not know what it would entail, when we got down to the basement , it smelled ! It was very cold and dark with a leaking ceiling.I had my one year old son with me who began to cry when we got down there. Also !! There were only African Americans seated down there which I am. I took high offense to being offered to sit somewhere it was cold smelly and dark because I would be seated faster. Then when we were seated upstairs the waiter was not friendly or patient, he would ask us what we wanted and walk away while we told him what we wanted. He seemed as though he was in a rush. Overall this was a terrible experience for this being an expensive ""upscale"" restaurant.",3,,
129,Sarah L.,"Roslyn Heights, NY",80,183,341,5.0,1/29/2017,Let's start with I LOVE Philippe Chow's. They use to have a location on Long Island that I use to go to all the time so when I am in NYC it is a must go to for upscale Chinese food. If you like good Chinese well look no further this is the place for you! The service is always good and the food is always consistent and delicious every time I go. The main dish portions are kind of big and good for sharing. I highly recommend getting lettuce wraps and chicken satay for starters. For my main I normally go for either Kung Po chicken or crispy beef with a side of fried rice. If you love Chinese food like I do then you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.,1,1,1
130,William K.,"Long Island, NY",6,14,2,5.0,4/13/2017,"Had dinner here with some friends before seeing Seinfeld. The food here is amazing! I can say with confidence that this is the best Chinese food I've ever had.We had the Crispy Beef, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Spicy Pepper Filet Mignon, Velvet Chicken and the Peking Duck. Highly recommend! The only thing we were not a fan of is the Peking Duck.",,,
131,Poppy Z.,"Manhattan, NY",2,27,3,1.0,2/15/2018,"Way overpriced chinese food ... if you looking to splurge and am too lazy to go to chinatown for 1/3 the price, go for it. Ambience is dark, more suitable for date night with asian cuisine!",1,,
132,Chelsea T.,"Patchogue, NY",252,201,1755,4.0,1/29/2016,Came for the pre-fixed lunch w/ a martini! Although this place is pretty pricey they give you a good amount of food! I can't say it was the best food I've ever tasted but I was satisfied and happy when I left. I started with the lychee martini- it was really good!! But I think every lychee martini I've ever had was pretty delicious and not as expensive. We ordered an extra appetizer: vegetable dumplings. They were decent but I wasn't in love. My appetizer was the chicken lettuce wraps. They were really good and filling! The sauce that came with it was really good as well. For my main course: crispy salmon. It was good but wasn't he best thing I ever tasted. Dessert was mango sorbet. I also tried the raspberry. Both were very tasty. I also had a coffee that was pretty strong! The service was great! The atmosphere was great! I would probably rate it more like 3.5 but overall a good experience!,3,,1
133,Melanie D.,"Queens, NY",249,496,310,5.0,1/26/2015,"My boyfriend me took out to Philippes for dinner, and it was so delicious. The service was outstanding and everything else was top notch.  For appetizers we had dim sum, which was fairly small but delicious none the less. We both had alcoholic beverages which were nice and strong. For dinner we ordered fried rice with bits of chicken in it, the broccoli filet mignon and some kind of chicken with spicy sauce on it. We could've easily skipped on the chicken it wasn't anything special, but oh my the broccoli filet mignon was to die for ! It was soooo good I've never combined the two in my life with a spivey sauce like they did. I would only go back for the broccoli filet mignon because the portions were extremely small for a big price. Safe to say we cleaned out each plate and left nothing behind. Lastly, dessert was fantastic. It made the dinner complete. I had their chocolate fudge cake and an espresso shot which was actually huge. The cake was so delicious i thought about it for a week after. The only complaint I have is how the tables were too close together, there is no privacy between conversations but then again it's Manhattan and everything cramped in this city. You won't be disappointed if you come here !",3,,1

136,Zulay A.,"New York, NY",191,113,3,4.0,1/5/2017,"I have dined at Philippe in the past but with public figures down in the private cellar so of course nothing less than stellar service was provided. This week I made a dinner reservation to catch up with my friends, upon arrival the hostess informed me that our table will be ready in 10 minutes, no biggie, we went to the bar and grabbed some drinks there, the table was not ready in 10 minutes, it was ready after 30 mins. Our waiter Florin from Romania was delightful and pleasant from start to finish, he eased the tension we arrived to at the table for having to wait so long on a weekday and with a reservation. The lychee martini is my go to drink and personal fave, I tried Shanghai Philippe which is supposed to be champagne vodka and elder flower, but the taste was bland and the house champagne they use lacked in taste. Food was solid, we went with chicken satay, Beijing chicken, spicy mignon, tuna tartare ( off the menu special of the day) and fried rice and veggies. For dessert we ordered the new Instagram worthy cotton candy Alaska, whoever came up with this bravo!, the burnt pieces of cotton candy mesh well with the ice cream cake.  Overall I had a great experience at Philippe and happy that us regular people get the same service as celebs and known figures. However, they should manage reservations better Also, very interesting to see the dynamic between the upper east side society and the wannabe Instagram models who frequent the place with their louboutin soles and loud designer bags",1,3,

139,Carson T.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,13,0,3.0,10/26/2017,"You probably check out the menu before you head out to test out another restaurant. We did, so as far as the prices, we knew what we were getting into.Confirmed - prices on these small servings of Chinese food equal what amounts to what is being charged for the new iPhone X.. outright high for Chinese food. But we give them some latitude due to the high rent and enormous bus staff they have working there.Cuisine - we had the special Mr. Chow Noodle Pork flavoured dish. Supposed to be spicy but it was not as hot as the Black Shimp with Black Bean (which is okay with me). What wasn't okay was their signature noodle dish came out lukewarm.We also ordered the Crispy Shrimp and Chicken dish which had a bit of golden garlic in it. A dry tasty dish. May want to get something with some sauce just so you can add it to this dry dish.Meals were served with a bowl of white rice. Want Brown Rice? Pay $6 extra. Nothing special about the taste of the white rice so all you get from it is an elevated blood sugar level on your glucose test. The meals were good but did not live up to the very high price tag (average $24 - $32+) per dish.Wait staff - unusual, we had the one token Asian waiter and several non-Asian bus staff. The service was impeccable and our water goblets were always topped off without asking.Seating - As you enter you hit the busy bar area first. Then you enter the back where you turn right and the room splits into a long room to your right, and the squared off room to your left. The squared off room seemed like it was reserved for the quieter crowd whereas the longer one on right seemed like it was for party goers or louder audience. Kudos for service - great for impressing a date, but tables a bit close so no privacy. I overheard the conversation of the two Gloria Vanderbilt ladies next to us, more info than I needed.It seemed to be one Asian waiter, one Asian Hostess, and a few dozen non-Asian workers. Don't know who was in kitchen.. perhaps Pillippe?Ambience -  Progressive and clean.Seating - During the week we arrived at 6:00 PM and it was empty. Seated right away. Arrive at 7:00 PM and it pretty busy.Prices - Very high but not shocking for the area we were in. A dinner for two guests ordering one appetizer and two main courses (no drinks nor desserts) set us back $92.00.Thoughts - Asian cuisine, I've had better or at least same quality in Chinatown (NYC and Brooklyn) but the service here wins. I guess it's a mashup between Asian chef and Greek restaurant management.Bon Appetite!",,,

Dishes that stood out were the chicken satay, Kung pao chicken was unbelievably delicious with the perfect amount of juicy and crispy with such tasty sauce and the green prawns. For dessert we ordered the warm chocolate cake which was very good, but I wish it had more of a melted chocolate center. Nutella martini was just ok.

But my order was meh- mediocre and overpriced at $12+ for a small wonton soup and $16+ for a small Pork fried rice. It was definitely not worth the price.

For an upscale restaurant, people were wearing jeans , sneakers, some were dressed as if they were just going to Burger King- on the opposite - were what looks like rich white old people and their fur coats.   The hostess and hostesses were bit snotty. We had to wait a while for our table despite  having reservations. Food: spinach salad- it was fine, good salad dressingVeg. Lo mein with hand pulled noodles: lacked vegetables- it had a few stands of red peppers that was it. The sauce was nothing to write about- average Chicken fried rice: nothing special Chilean sea bass: cooked well- the sauce was good ( good umami) King prawns- it was okay.Overall I did not see anything special about this place , nor did the food warrant the price they were charging for each dish. Service was spotty: bt our waiter and the wait staff : disorganized. Made a mistake with our order. The other wait staff kept making mistakes and bring food or drinks to the wrong tables. Go else where- too much hyped, which I didn't know when I made reservations. I thought the food was same quality as Chinese take out.",4,1,

Food is unique but approachable for the less adventurous. Lower level bar is small and nice for upscale drinks after work.

170,Johnny A.,"South Amboy, NJ",6,109,142,3.0,5/22/2015,"You go here to pay an arm and a leg for Chinese food and to potentially see a celebrity right? I mean, surely you don't come here because you think the food here is amazing and worth the cost right? The food is good, but not nearly worth the menu price in my opinion. The service is pretty good and the waiters and hostesses do a great job of making you feel welcomed, but the owner and waiters will quickly let you know how important they perceive you to be by who they acknowledge in the room and how often they tend to you. I, personally wasn't bothered by this because 1. I'm not a celebrity and 2. I'm not dropping $500 on a meal... it's just something to be aware of. Don't feel bad if the waiters and owner doesn't schmooze with you while you eat. TIPS:1. Skip the dumplings2. Order the chicken satay3. Ask for extra rice4. Try the crispy beef. It's a little sweet, but very good.All in all this place is decent, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",2,,
171,Minnie V.,"Manhattan, NY",1,93,58,2.0,2/5/2017,"Food is good but a bit overpriced. Dumpling are fine, nothing special and a bit doughy. Chicken satay was way too much sauce. So overpowering we didn't eat them the waiter offered to take it off the check. But they didn't.  Fried rice was awesome.  Lettuce wraps were great.",3,,
172,A O.,"Stanton, CA",84,8,2,4.0,5/13/2017,Service was excellent. Food was on par with the service. Dish I can remember is the chicken satay. I must say when it came out it didn't look appetizing imo just because of the orange color.. but wow that chicken satay is crack!!,,,
173,Fatima C.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,2,0,1.0,9/9/2017,"Terrible Customer Service. Don't be fooled by the glitz and the glam. Mediocre food.I came here for a birthday celebration and left with a headache. Not only was there clear seating segregation(most of the minorities whether big or small groups were placed in the back), the waiter  incorrectly charged us as well. Since when do waiters take tip while taking payment at the same time??? Tip is given last. This man had the nerve to assume his tip amount. The food wasn't that great for us to even consider a tip that hefty. As soon as I noticed, I told him about the mischarge. He claimed to make the change. I left and realized that the changes were not visible on my bank statement. I called the company to discuss the issue and also pointed out the seating arrangements. Instead of apologizing, the man on the phone dismisses the conversation. Talk about awful customer service! Next time try to understand your customer's frustrations before claiming that you're right and the customer is wrong.I guess Mavado was right about this place!",1,,
174,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,2/11/2016,"This is NOT your local take-out joint.A friend and I met at Phillipe for a rather elaborate mid-week dinner, because we BOTH needed a break and to indulge. Arriving before her, I sat at the beautifully appointed bar and sipped on a glass of perfectly chilled and fruit Pinot Grigio. (Admittedly, I wanted a cocktail, but $17 - $19 wasn't quite in the budget for a drink that night. Heh.) Once she arrived, we made out way to our table. There are various dining areas, with the front one being a little more boisterous, noise-wise, than the rear. Luckily, we snagged a quiet table for two in the far left corner of the rear room. Too bad I wasn't on a date with my beau, because it's quite romantic. ;-)Between the two of us, we split quite the feast! While at the bar, we both spotted a man with the chicken lettuce wraps and were trying not to drool. We ordered our own, along with the Crunch Duck Salad, which was delicious, though the dressing kind of pooled a bit at the bottom. But, going back to the chicken lettuce wraps, they were as heavenly as they looked! Honestly, after eating a few wraps, I didn't know how I'd manage our entrees. Still, we persevered! We split Chicken and Broccoli and the Crispy Duck with pancakes. The former was delicious, if not a tad bit bland; it could have used a touch more salt. The Crispy Duck with pancakes was perfection! Parts of the duck were so fried, it was almost like cracklings or chicharron. OH, I was in love! Served very simply with julienned cucumbers and green onions, hoisin sauce, and perfectly-sized pancakes, these made for an excellent entree. For dessert, we split a very simple Warm Apple Crumb Tarte with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Though seemingly out of place in a restaurant serving Beijing cuisine, I will eat ANY dessert that has apples. Ha! This was an excellent tart, so fresh that it was steaming when we cut into it.The service was top notch! Though it did take our waiter a little time to get to us, initially, I picked up on many instances of the staff's attentiveness. At the bar, my water was refilled without me asking, as as we dined, we got refills on lettuce wraps and hoisin sauce constantly, again, without ever having to ask. My mere complaint would be the bathroom. Located near the facade on East 60th Street, it was COLD in there. Brrrr! Not sure if there is a lot that can be done about that, however...In a city full of take-out joints and home-down Chinatown haunts, it's rare that I eat in a restaurant with Chinese cuisine that is so refined. Phillipe definitely is a notch above. And, truthfully, almost 24 hour later, I'm still full. Ha!",3,1,3
175,Jessica G.,"Manhattan, NY",263,107,189,4.0,2/19/2016,"I'm a big fan of Philippe. Philippe Chow's specialty is high end Chinese fare, previously lending his talents to Michael Chow's established Mr. Chow, and now at his own restaurant. I have visited both and prefer Philippe's intimate atmosphere and more attentive service to the scene at Mr. Chow. The incomparable Mr. Cheng also followed Philippe to his place, hand-pulling his famous noodles, which are a must-order. I have been here on many occasions and it works well both as a date spot and a place to have a large birthday party. Here are the dishes you can't miss out on:Chicken Satay*** -absolutely ridiculous. Good luck stopping yourself from eating more and more and more and more and more!!!Mr. Cheng's Noodles*** -perfect texture, mixed with the savory pork sauce... irresistible Lychee Martini***Ok. Now that you've ordered those, I'll offer some more of my favorites.Beijing Chicken -great for a main protein, it should please everyone. Sweet but not too sweet. Crispy Seaweed -really interesting take on a seaweed dish, light but crispy and delicious. Good as a side dish (close enough to a vegetable)Peking Duck -they slice it right next to your table. The bird is HUGE and insanely good, one of the best in the city. Salt and Pepper CalamariGreen Prawns My family also loves the lettuce wraps, but I don't love lettuce so they're not worth it for me. I've tried almost everything on their menu and it's all great... writing this review made me want to go back.",3,1,
176,Kadeem C.,"New York, NY",56,27,87,5.0,5/16/2015,"Philippe is an excellent restaurant. Perfect for a birthday dinner! The waiters accommodated my reservation as expected..Coat check was offered immediately afterwards.  We chose the Peking Duck Spring Rolls and Chicken Satay as the appetizers. The spring rolls had a nice crisp along with its tender/juicy meat. I loved the sauce served on the chicken satays! Originally, we chose the Black prawns and Three Within as entrees but the waiter suggested the Nine Season Spicy Prawns and Beijing Chicken. This was a great suggestion! We enjoyed the both entrees along with the tasty lobster fried rice. The birthday girl loved the sparkler surprise in her red velvet cake along with her personal bottle of Moët Rose Imperial. We had a great experience and would definitely come again. Compared to Mr. Chow and Red Stix, Philippe wins!",1,,

178,Tiffany B.,"Brooklyn, NY",191,8,0,4.0,3/7/2017,"The prices are a bit on the expensive side, but the food is amazing. The peanut sauce for the chicken satay is to die for. Ended up getting extra to put on my fried rice. The Beijing Chicken is sooo delicious. So is the Chilean sea bass and the Peking duck. I was full a half an hour into the meal but couldn't stop eating because the food was so good. If you have no discipline, do not come here. You will leave broke and nothing to show for it ,but and over bloated stomach and pictures (if you   better...the waiter was either hovering or no where to be found.

Updated review","I've been here numerous times because I enjoyed the fine Chinese cuisine. However my most recent visit, left me with a sour taste in my mouth (and it wasn't from the sweet and sour chicken). The quality in clientele has diminished greatly. The smell of Marijuana lingering in the restaurant is unacceptable. Keep your ghetto ass guest in check.",2,1,
180,Sach S.,"New York, NY",3,36,0,2.0,3/10/2016,"I haven't been this disappointed in the longest. Went with a group of 4 for my birthday dinner. We ordered 4 apps (chick satay- decent, fried calamari-too salty, crispy seaweed- eh, shrimp dumpling-no tatse) and 4 main courses, jo lau chicken (decent), Crispy salmon- drenched in sweet and sour sauce, crispy duck- decent, and prawns and broccoli-decent. The drinks at the bar were the best part of the night. Overall, I say save your money and order chinese take-out at your local chinese spot.",2,,
181,Sabrina J.,"Queens, NY",1,5,0,2.0,7/20/2017,"I'm so disappointed with my horrific experience at Phillips yesterday. After eating out at very high end restaurants and the other Phillip locations like the one in LA, I left so angry and so unsatisfied that I just had to say something and warn future customers. Yesterday as I was trying to enjoy a meal with my boyfriend I was handed a cocktail with a fly...I immediately told my server and instead of a warm apology I got an attitude. He made me wait 15 minutes for a new drink and acted like the fly in my drink wasn't a big deal which I thought was disgusting and repulsive. He didn't even take the drink away and left it right by me. When I mentioned the manager I was informed that he was on his way to see me but never even came. I had to complain multiple times about this drink for them to at least take it off my bill. This is not the type of treatment anyone should ever experience at a high end restaurant. Although the food is good the customer service isn't up to par.",2,,
182,Gretchen V.,"Newport Beach, CA",0,1,0,2.0,4/29/2017,"Phillipe was recommended by friends who live in upper east side.  Food was delicious, but service was quite disappointing.  Never asked if I wanted another drink, never asked how the food was or if we wanted anything, and dessert took over 30 minutes and since it was baked Alaska - having them light it on the other side of the room and lose the presentation was crazy.  The place is too pricey for lousy service.",,,

Can you please bring Philippe to ATL please! Anyway, the wait staff is always super nice & i never have to wait to be seated which is a plus! I order the same thing every time I come.. Chicken satay or lettuce wraps for appetizer, bejing chicken for entree, and the sorbet for desert. Granted I know you can get the same meal at Mr. Chow and the new restaurant Red Stix but they don't compare to this place trust me! Don't believe the 3.5 stars this place is really good! Your check might be a little expensive but it's worth every penny. Only downfall is the parking! Street parking is never available when I come so I always have to park in the garage which ends up being pretty pricey once I leave. Oh and a quick tip... Their lunch special is also available on Saturday :) For close to $40 you get a 3 course meal and a martini!",3,1,2

I came here to celebrate Chinese New Year with my mom. The food is incredible. I recommend the chicken with walnuts and the lettuce wraps to start -Superb!The menu is pricey, but I am okay with paying more money if the food is worth it, and it definitely was. I also had the red velvet cake for dessert, which was also terrific. Definitely worth the $15 price tag!I will definitely come back many many more times.",1,,1

Our server was nice enough to give us a complementary drink and move us to a different dinning room with a working AC. The second time here the AC was working just fine and the bathrooms were clean, and every visit since. This leads me to believe that they truly listen to their patrons concerns.
