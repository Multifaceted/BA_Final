0,Mike M.,"ROCKAWAY PARK, NY",44,82,95,5.0,6/14/2018,"I'm here for dinner before the ballet.  This icon is not for the feint of heart. The menu is always oriented to the culture and period of the opera or ballet being performed.  Tonight it's Italy because the performance is the timeless Romeo and Juliet.    This is truly the last vestige of civilization.  The food is just absolutely delicious.  Have never had a bad meal here.  The service is from another time and place. Jason my waiter is always assigned to me by the maitre d' James.  Attentive doesn't describe adequately the level of service.  The wine list is full of the very best the vintners have to offer.  Generally I opt for a bottle of chateau neuf du Pape But I start with a Bordeaux, the house wine,  because I'm solo tonight One dines under the Marc Chagall masterpieces and is transformed back to another era.   White table clothes and Reidel crystal are all pristine   The clientele is decidedly older upper crust.  I know many of the people because of all the years I've been associated with the American Ballet Theatre.  Tonight the ABT is sponsoring a party so the restaurant  is packed. Anyone looking for a true unique experience needs to come and enjoy this amazing place.",2,1,1

Reservations were easy to make online, and surprisingly it wasn't crowded at all. 11:15 AM was the perfect pre-matinee time. We opted to go for the pre-fixe brunch menu which was surprisngly on $45 and included an appetizer, entree and unlimited Grand Tier Bellinis. I went the breakfast route and started with the Yogurt Parfait which was great! Very filling, topped with granola, pineapple, banana and coconut. I had the soft scrambled eggs with house-smoked salmon and baguette. It was great. The atmosphere was the perfect holiday brunch. The staff was friendly, location is beautiful and there was even a performance by a young opera singer. Wonderful way to enjoy the holiday season and feel a little fancy!",3,,
2,Cyce S.,"Manhattan, NY",33,8,5,4.0,4/1/2018,"Having first experienced Sunday Brunch at Grand Tier in January 2017, I thought it would be the perfect place to celebrate Easter after mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral.Today I had the Spring Lettuce Soup and Wild Mushroom Risotto and both dishes were presented delightfully. The highlight was the recital from rising artists Kang Wong (Tenor) and Zalman Kelber (Piano).Sunday Brunch at Grand Tier in Lincoln Center is the place to revel in the senses of sight, smell, taste, and sound. It might become my new Easter Sunday tradition.",1,,
3,Larry R.,"Burlington, VT",158,151,20,5.0,1/10/2018,"High-octane dining. Singular experience. Put the food in some divey food-geek spot in the middle of nowhere. It would stand up. Well. They make good food here, and they don't have to. Because they are in one of the most unique and stunning spaces on the continent. Look left; look right. Those are Marc Chagall murals. Look up. Those are gorgeous Austrian chandeliers. Look out. It's the plaza of Lincoln Center. Look around. You just don't get spaces of this, well, space, in Manhattan. Meanwhile, the food. For a starter, most of us opted for the crab cake, and it did not disappoint. Oh, to have something crabby at the start of a winter that seems to have already gone on forever. Sublime, yet fun. Then we all had the filet. It did not come out piping hot. Because they were cooked expertly then allowed to rest, and the result was divine. I think it was the best filet I've ever had (it's a tricky cut to cook, and most cheat by wrapping it in bacon). Totally worth the $7 up-charge on the prix fixe. A nervy Sonoma Zinfandel was only $80. We weren't being cheap, but we all like old-school Zin, and it was a great counter punch to the assertive treatment of the filet. We all loved our desserts at the interval. The chocolate souffle was by the book, and this is good. Just the right size. Gorgeous balance of light and rich. Kids, don't try this at home (I have; it's never what you'd hope). Oh, and for the booze nerds (that'd be me) in the crowd, I ordered grappa just to be contrary. It was AWESOME. Battery acid from a really expensive car, in a way-too-cool glass. Let these people do their thing and you won't be disappointed. Go off piste and trust them. Good fun is not cheap. $175-ish per person (big tip), and we didn't worry about the bill as we were ordering. This is why we work.  Once a year we trek to New York City, and our cards have been punched at some pretty awesome spots (Robert, le Bernardin, the Mandarin). But this is now our go-to for a night at the opera. Great food, service, and atmosphere. Next year, if there's nothing worth seeing at the Met, we'll come here for the food, the service, and the place. HIGHLY recommended.",4,1,3

Looking up at the grand stairway and the incredible chandeliers you can't help but feel magical! The food is great too! I always start with salmon cakes and end up with the baked Alaska ... and the view of the fountain and Lincoln square city lights at night... ugh you can't beat that! The city comes alive through the 20 foot windows which makes a great view day or night! Enjoy!,1,1,1
8,Vanessa H.,"New Hyde Park, NY",565,98,87,2.0,1/16/2017,"I had family friends visiting from out of town and had thought this would be a good place to bring an out-of-towner. Brunch + opera, how nice does that sound? I was somewhat disappointed with my visit.  Service: Our friends had been seated first and when we arrived and checked in with the waitress, she didnt even bother to show us to the table and had just suggested us to walk in and look for them. What was the point of checking in if we could have done that in the first place?Second, our waiter greeted us fairly quickly and proceeded to take the orders around the table. After that, he was barely seen. We had ordered 3 prefix menus (39$ with endless bellinis) and 2 a la carte entrees and share plate. The waiter had gotten one of our orders mixed up but it took a few minutes for the food runner to track him down in order to fix the mistake. Endless bellinis, you would expect them to refill the glasses correct? Our glasses were not refilled AT ALL until we asked. If you looked around servers were walking around refilling everyones glasses except ours. Food; We had gotten the figs and cheese share dish which was good but a little on the bland side. Amongst the table we had gotten a mushroom risotto, (2) soft scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, (2) benedict royale and a smoked salmon platter. The risotto was incredible salty to the point where it was inedible. When the waiter was informed, he had walked away as if he had not heard us. The benedict royale was good. The eggs were not overcooked but the potatoes were a little dry and bland. The soft scrambled eggs were a little too much eggs to be honest. You get one baguette, a bowl of soft scrambled eggs with smoked salmon topped with some truffle. It was a little too much. I did not try the smoked salmon platter.I will most likely not be returning to visit. Oh, and the performance started around 1:30PM and there was a tenor who came out to perform for a little bit. I expected more.",5,2,

10,Daniella S.,"Roslyn, NY",570,429,3949,5.0,10/19/2015,"Sitting beneath the grandiose ceilings (I want to say vaulted for their loftiness) and the massive  Windows one is captivated all the more by the Marc Chagall diptych of the Triumph and the Source of Music. The muted acoustics and old modern  elegance of the dining area is one of the best reasons to frequent the Grand Tier but the absolute proximity of the Opera is the practical reason to dine here amongst fellow opera goers. The food is plated to perfection and if you have any complaint whatsoever you mention it and will be compensated graciously.Enough vegetarian options to not have to request a special meal, you will delight in their selection.We come here often enough to make the waiters recognize us and address us, and who doesnt love that?",3,1,1
11,Steve V.,"San Francisco, CA",0,6,2,1.0,9/30/2017,"Terrible experience. Seated at 6:18pm. No one paid any attention to our table of 4 or took our order for a very long time -?30 minutes. After they took our order nothing really happened for another 30 minutes. Finally, at 7:22, we got fed up and asked to speak to managers because we still hadn't been served and it was almost showtime. The manager never showed up, no one ever apologized, and our first course arrived around 7:25. Needless to say, we had to really rush it and the rest of the 3 course meal. For a $440 meal it doesn't make sense to provide that kind of service. Don't make a mistake - get dinner elsewhere then go to the opera.",2,,
12,Hafina A.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,25,2,2.0,10/25/2017,"You have to pre-pay for food.  We were there last Friday night and they didn't bring all the food we had ordered and paid for.  Then when we asked about it the waiter almost caused us to be late getting back to our seats at the end of intermission.  What we did eat was OK, but not worth the over $235 for 2 people that we paid.  I emailed them about the issue but they never responded.Total rip off",1,,

The actual food was pretty decent. I had the lamb pappardelle and it was a bit too salty for me. My sister had the smoked salmon which she loved and my mom had the grilled salmon. Overall good experience. We also decided to have dessert during intermission. Overall a bit pricey but worth the experience.,6,,2

Updated review","A friend and I came for brunch prior to a performance at the Metropolitan opera of La Donna Del Lago. In order to dine at the Grand Tier, you must have tickets to a Lincoln Center Performance. The Grand Tier is so pretty. Magnificent Crystal Chandeliers hang from the ceilings. The place wasn't as crowded as it normally is for brunch. Probably due to the holidays.I started out with a yummy Lulu cocktail. It had Citrus Juice and Prosecco :). Our appetizers consisted of Charred Octopus and Salad. I had the octopus which was very good. My friend said the salad was excellent.We both ordered the Soft Scrambled eggs and Perigord truffles, It included a Toasted Baguette, House Smoked Salmon, Melted Leeks and Shaved Black Winter Truffle. It was delicious, but had too many leeks for me. I asked our server if I could have the Brioche French Toast instead. Our server Raul very graciously took the Scrambled eggs back. The French Brioche Toast arrived shortly afterwards. It was the BEST French toast I've even eaten!  It included Roasted Honeycrisp Apples, Whipped Mascarpone and Walnuts!  My friend just had coffee for dessert. The coffee came in a lovely French Press. He loves their coffee! No dessert for me. Watching those holiday calories :).I must say our server Raul was an absolute delight. Would definitely request him again.This place is definitely for someone who has deep pockets or somone who wants to live it up once in a while.I give the brunch my Fab 5 Star Rating!!!",66,45,62
15,Akira O.,"New York, NY",74,400,73,5.0,3/9/2016,"Absolutely perfect dining experience.  The food, ambiance, view, service is excellent and I have to say I enjoy the restaurant more than the opera... The menu is rather simple but is absolutely perfectly executed. I'm not a chef but I can appreciate the solid techniques behind the cooking from the chicken liver mousse, soup, branzino to even baked Alaska. There are not many restaurants I can continue to eat even when I'm full and this is one of them. In my book Grand Tier scores much higher than Lincoln Ristorante.",2,,1
16,Russell W.,"New York, NY",37,143,0,5.0,1/11/2016,"The Metropolitan Opera and the Grand Tier restaurant are probably some of the last bastions of civilized living in New York.I love this place. Make a reservation for two hours prior to the start of your show. Sit and eat.The food is very good. It isn't particularly creative, but it is tasty food, well executed and plated in a way fit for the beautiful settings. The service is excellent and friendly and the restaurant runs like a well oiled machine.From the moment you give your name at the front desk you know that you are in a place which does what it does very well. From the timing to the food everything is executed with precision.The reason I like to get here 2 hours before the show is because I like to go to the bar on the Grand Tier for a cocktail and to look out on Lincoln Center before hearing the sweet chimes of the xylophone letting you know to find your seats.The best part of the experience to me is desert. You order it after dinner, along with coffee and cocktails and then at intermission return to your table where, as if by magic, your desert arrives for you to enjoy.If you have never had the experience of dining at the opera, you really ought to. This is just a whole other level of sophistication. However, I find that the stuffiness you might expect just isn't there. While it is sophisticated it is also just downright fun.Oh, and people...this is the opera not a rock concert. Leave your jeans at home, put on a tie and be ladies and gentleman not guys and girls.",5,1,1

18,Cesar S.,"Philadelphia, PA",773,178,685,5.0,10/22/2015,"This place is truly amazing. Is located in the second floor of the Metropolitan Opera in NYC. And you have about 35 minutes to enjoy you dinner or small plates. I had smoked salmon with salmon caviar, a cheese plate and a soirbet to finish it all. The salmon was served with creme fresh and a little bit of micro greens and croutons with extra virgin olive oil, bread on the side with unsalted butter also on the side to accompany the salmon. It was quite delicious! The cheese plate was in the same category of flawless. Rich assortment of cheese with a variety of crackers, some good quality red wine to gel wash it down and soirbet of mixed berries, pear and peach to end my Turandot intermission. And of course fresh brewed coffee on a French press ;)The service here is a smooth well oiled military precision machine that lives nothing to be desired! When you come to the Met, give it a try! You will love it!!",6,3,4
19,Judith J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,2/4/2018,"Sunday brunch before NYC ballet performance seemed like a nice thing to do on a rainy January afternoon.  Walking up the red carpeted swirling staircase of the Metropolitan Opera House set the stage for music, beauty, elegance and an afternoon to remember.  The $45 brunch menu, Bellinis et al,  sounded delightful, but my 2 friends and I decided to enjoy a light meal and order a la carte. My chicken salad was no ordinary chicken salad.  It blossomed into a feast of tender grilled chilled, toasted pistachios, apples, cheese, sprouts, endive and more.  It was a delight of flavor, texture, color and satiation.  My friends both order smoked salmon scrambled eggs and by the look of there empty plates they were also pleased.  The ambiance at the Grand Tier takes one to another space and time.  It sets a mood of wonder from the tall ceilings and windows to enormous cascading flower arrangements and of course the magnificent crystal chandeliers.  Oh My!  Such beauty.  If you ever need a place to refresh and restore your psyche take time and visit this special spot. To highlight the mood you will have the joy of listening to performers from the Met sing and delight you even more.Next month I am going for the entire brunch with Bellinis!",,,
20,Joe B.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,2.0,3/4/2017,"Since moving back to NYC, My husband and I have been enjoying the Opera.  We took my step-son and his wife for what we had hoped would be a wonderful opera ""experience"" - seeing Carmen and eating at the Grand Tier (which we had never done).  We had so anticipated a great experience that we pre-booked it for a second visit (tonight - La Traviata).  What a disappointment.  The opera was amazing - the dining experience not so much. I wish we hadn't already booked it again and invited two friends as a celebration.I was expecting - elegance I suppose.  And more than that - fantastic food.The approach is like a cattle call... you wait in line - people are rushing to get to the maitre d's desk - which does not exactly set a relaxed tone.The dining room was lovely.  But the dining experience was not.First of all - you should order as soon as you sit down.  Find what you want - and grab it.  Of the four people at our table - two of us ordered entrees that - we learned way too late - were no longer available.  We had to scramble to find new entrees.  If you want wine - order it quickly as well - it took forever to reach the table.After informing me that the beef I ordered was gone (which took an extraordinary amount of time) - my server raved about the Salmon.  When it arrived - it was luke warm - and not fresh.  I am assuming he raved about it because it was one of the only entrees left.The rest of the dishes were passable - but not great.  The souffle was lumpy and heavy... the ice cream was melted at intermission by the time we got to the table.Our server was very friendly - but clearly rushed and over his head.  The staff in general - though smiling - seemed overwhelmed.Now - I can be forgiving because they are rushing 200'ish people through dinner in time for the opera.  But - if that is what you are offering.  Get it right.So - we will see what tonight brings.  We are going with two very good friends and have told them to dial down their expectation.",2,,
21,Lisa O.,"West Orange, NJ",0,70,8,4.0,5/14/2016,"Hadn't been here for dinner in several years, and we were truly impressed with the quality of the food (although it is rather pricey on the a la carte menu). Apparently others agree, as the size of the restaurant has now expanded significantly from what I remember into the Grand Tier outside area. There is a $59 prix fixe ""ballet menu""; we were not given it when seated but we saw it around us and asked. There is a limited selection of items on that menu, with only 3 entrees, and dessert must be eaten before the performance (you cannot come back at intermission as you can if you choose off the regular menu). The soft shell crab appetizer, at the market price of $25, was really fabulous. Perhaps even better than the crispy fried crab were the accompaniments, including a truly delicious and delicate sauce made from avocado. Felt the same way about the slow roasted entree salmon: excellent fish, but the accompaniments, including morels, asparagus, peas and a pistachio pesto, were the true stars. The coconut cream pie dessert (on prix fixe menu) made me glad they gave me the extra fork to sample my husband's: a truly contemporary tart-sized version that almost tasted like cheesecake with a luscious crust and sprinkled with toasted coconut. Portions are very nicely sized, and very much enjoyed the house special Negroni.",3,,
22,Jon F.,"Westerville, OH",1,118,325,5.0,4/30/2017,Fabulous place to eat before you see your performance.  Eat first and dessert is waiting for you at intermission.  Excellent wine selection.  Service was great.,,,

We let our waiter know we would be back for desert during the intermission and pre-ordered that course. Highlights from our meal include the artichoke soup. This soup was amazing - black truffles and goat cheese espuma are all you need to know! Hopefully, it will still be on the menu next month - I'm looking forward to having this soup again, perhaps more than the performance (and I loveeeeee the opera). My dining companion was thrilled with their branzino. A perfectly executed, warm, Valrhona chocolate soufflé was waiting for us at intermission, along with a very delightful sugar plum cake (the eggnog mousse and caramelized plumbs were outstanding).We feel so lucky to have a restaurant, of this caliber, at the opera house.

31,Marlene D.,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",231,138,113,5.0,2/7/2014,"I felt it was only fair to write a nice review about this restaurant, since I had such an excellent time. I saw Die Fledermaus with my friend at the Metropolitan the other day. A friend of mine had recommended The Grand Tier Restaurant, and after hearing about this, I simply had to try it out. What a great idea that was, to be able to sit down during intermissions, and have great food, impeccable service in such a convenient location, just steps away from our seats at the performance! My friend and I had made arrangements in advance, and had everything planned out in such a way that during each intermission, champagne and some food was waiting for us, at the most romantic table located on the Grand Tier level of the Metropolitan Opera House, with a view of two breathtaking Chagall paintings and a wall of windows overlooking Lincoln Center's fountain. All that was missing from this enchanting scenery on this wonderful evening full of romance, phenomenal food and champagne was a ring and a proposal. Too bad my friend is a girl, and unfortunately I am straight. : ) Now I will go on by addressing points other people made regarding 'geriatric' people visiting: I remember one table next to ours, that had one superbly dressed gentleman, probably in his sixties and two very well raised and well dressed children. Other than that, I was too busy enjoying my company and everything that our wonderful waiter Todd was serving us, to really be bothered by futile things such as the age range of other guests. My friend actually thought that the age range was pretty diverse. Just think of the average opera-lover, and you have a pretty good idea of who you will be surrounded by. Seriously: If you expect a restaurant that can only be visited by opera ticket holders to be filled with a bunch of 20- and 30- year olds, you need to get your brains checked out.  I'm quite picky, so if I liked it here, so will you. Unless if you are like some other reviewers that always like to find the negatives in a positive situation, well in that case no one can ever please you. The food: ""Gerber quality"" and ""for people with dentures"" some whiner I mean reviewer stated somewhere else? Ahem. I beg to differ. We very much enjoyed the warm bread, that was nice and crusty. Trust me, that bread would definitely not have been easy on dentures. I enjoyed my smoked salmon appetizer and also liked the hearty crab cakes. The Yukon potatoe puree was alright. The chocolate souffle was a great dessert and I liked it more than the cheesecake.I thought the quality of the food we were served overall was exquisite. The service:We could not have been treated better than this. We felt treated like royalty. Compliments to everyone! I'll be back soon! : )",8,5,2

36,John T.,"Holmdel, NJ",1,38,135,4.0,5/8/2016,"Just shy of perfect. The prices are extremely high, but what you typically expect for the venue. The value would be better if the food was exceptional, but alas, it's only excellent. The location is exquisite with its vaulted ceilings and floor to ceiling windows makes dining there wonderful. The service is very good, but not as attentive as you would expect, but generally, there are few opportunities where you have to wait for something. I have been going here for years and the previous chefs were remarkable. Now, they simply cannot live up to historical standards. Unfortunately, they changed the salmon appetizer, which used to be accompanied by capers, onions and diced eggs. They also dropped the wonderful chocolate fondue desert. That desert is something you always remember. The brunches have gone downhill, but are still pretty good. The souffle is incredible and definitely recommended. The coffee is mediocre. The cheese dish is excellent. They used to have a wonderful sirloin for the matinee, but no more. Now, it's eggs or french toast. Meh.",,,1
37,Honey P.,"Manhattan, NY",12,78,2,2.0,2/18/2013,"My fiance and I had a double date w/ our good friends at this restaurant prior to seeing Carmen on a Saturday night.  I was looking for a good restaurant prior to the show and decided to pick this restaurant b/c the reviews (via opentable) were very good and I liked the idea of having our dessert during intermission.  1) The hostess was very on point for this type of restaurant (4 people = ~over $500).2) Ambiance - This restaurant needs some renovations.  My opinion - it seemed like the ambiance of a cruise ship.  I think putting candles on the tables would lift it up a bit.  Maybe dim the lights?  3) Waiter - our waiter seemed a bit flustered in the beginning, but he picked up over time.  To be very nit picky -- the waiters need an update  on their wardrobe (again, for this type of restaurant).4)  Food - it was good, but not great.5)  Coat check = $3 each ?Possibly, my reviews are also based on the fact that I had dinner at Del Posto a few nights beforehand and a couple years ago, we ate at Picholine prior to watching La Traviata.  Both restaurants were above average (in all categories), whereas I found The Grand Tier to just be 'average'.Would I chose this restaurant again prior to seeing another opera show?  No.  I will search for a nearby restaurant.",1,,

Artichoke soup, burgundy tips, baked Alaska all 5 stars , service was excellent, attentive waiter and  made a excellent wine selection. Went to see barber of Seville and had dinner there. The Met is seriously impressive place. The food wasn't cheap but you get what you pay for. And it was a half and half young and old crowd. Go get your culture and opera on and enjoy. Seriously though this is a NYC treasure and one of the many reasons why I love my NYC",1,,
39,Pam C.,"San Francisco, CA",4,21,2,5.0,5/25/2014,This restaurant deserves a Michelin star. The service is friendly and impeccable. The food is presented in beautiful and creative ways. And everything was delicious! The fennel and garlic soup with lemon zest was creamy and divine. The cod in creamy broth with radish and sea beans was special and cooked perfectly. It was so special to eat inside Lincoln Center's MET Opera House before the ballet began. You felt like you had the place to yourself and it was fun to look out at the Lincoln Center fountain and all the people coming and going below. The only thing that could use some updating was the cheese plate. I don't think parmigiano belongs on it and they could use a nice brie or creamy triple creme.,2,1,1
40,Kristen Q.,"Palms, Los Angeles, CA",213,725,1448,1.0,7/28/2010,"I'm guessing with a 5-star review... none of these reviewers have visited the Grand Tier Restaurant in quite some time-- in fact, I see the last review was over 2 years ago!Uhhh, how can I even rate this restaurant with any stars when they did not care about food allergies when we alerted our waitor that the fact that ""(insert food name)"" could cause a member of our party to die!Not even one ounce of concern. It was simply as if I stated, ""I do not like the temperature of this room."" No reaction whatsoever! How upsetting!Anyways, the low-down on the food. Ordered the prix-fixe with wine (addt'l $10/person)Complimentary bread: not soft, not hardSoup: cold tomato flavor with jumbo shrimps. The shrimp was the best part. I ate those and left the rest.Main course: Salmon with green beans. The salmon was dry. I was disappointed. Costco salmon is better. Couldn't they have marinated the salmon a bit more?Dessert: Cheesecake. Not bad. I didn't bother finishing it.I'm glad I had this experience once. However, I doubt I'd dine again ...I thought that the restaurant experience was about seeing a performance with the American Ballet Theatre and being able to come in and out at perfect timing to eat on the munchies. It was not this. We had to scarf our meal down right before the performance and race to see the ballet performance before it started!",1,2,

42,Jacqui P.,"New York, NY",0,31,0,3.0,2/14/2016,Have dined here for years during intermission and was shocked last night to be served  the smallest bowl of soup I have ever received for $21.00. The restaurant was also freezing. Not a good combination for an expensive meal.,,,
43,Danesh J.,"Jersey City, NJ",178,387,466,3.0,11/16/2014,"Their reservation system is a word document. You call, then email, you choose from the very limited menu, then email it back. The document is not user friendly and confusing. Seeing the menu and that the two intermissions only lasted about 30 min each (doesn't say this anywhere on the document btw, they mention this on the call), it was best to do wine and cheese for the first then dessert for the last (a bit of sugar to keep us running for the final piece).  It was a nice break compared to just standing around. The restaurant is two floors down from the top. When the lights come on, just walk over there ans check in. If you're there for the second, just walk back to the same table. Fewer people seem to do the 2nd intermission, so if you want a more romantic setting to do romantic things, the 2nd is prime time.",,,
44,BM G.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,6/5/2012,"Classic rubber chicken cuisine.  Could not be more generic. total rip-off fishing for people going to the opera and not familiar with the area.  28 bucks for 10 gnocchi (the 'entree version') that tasted totally bland (counted them!  And don't get me wrong: if they had been hand-made or in any other way special I would not complain about the size of the portion, but this is generic food of the cheapest kind).  The only asset they have is their location - that's it!  My advice: Go to one of the Boulud places across the street (or anywhere else in the area - there are so many great restaurants) and get some real food!",1,,
45,Alan G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,2,1.0,10/30/2015,I have been an opera subscriber for 45 years. When the Grand Tier restaurant began to serve intermission dinners I quickly became a regular customer 9 or 10 times each year. When my wife and I dined there last night we found the revised menu quite poor and at an unjustifiable increased cost.  The service as always was great. I am planning to do everything I can to not return and to dine at one of the many better dining establishments in the area before each performance.,,,
46,Adrianna G.,"Belmont, CA",583,60,44,4.0,1/18/2011,"The plan: Buy rush tickets for Tosca at $25/piece at 6pm.  Book reservations at Grand Tier for 2 at 6:30.  Finish in time for the show.The plan was flawlessly executed  - we got our tickets, our food was divine, and dinner ended at the perfect time for us to get seated for the opera.So why 4 stars instead of 5? Because our waitress was very rude - my friend and I wanted to split everything so that we could have smaller (healthier) portions and try more dishes.  We still ordered $100 worth of food.  It's not like we were being cheap or anything, but the waitress was not accommodating in the least bit.  She told us that ""the chef won't split the entree"", so she brought a plate and made us split it tableside! She also kept making fun of us - ""let me guess, you are going to split the dessert?""When I asked her if Patina Group, who owns the restaurant, was based in Los Angeles, she scoffed at me and said ""oh, definitely not..""  I have dined at the flagship restaurant Patina which is located in LA's Music Center.

47,Tom B.,"North Palm Beach, FL",15,7,1,5.0,10/5/2014,"A night at the Metropolitan Opera is always a special occasion, but adding dinner at the Grand Tier really adds to the fun.  We have eaten there many times but this is my first review, and it is a winner. They do an amazing job of giving you a great meal, good service, in a beautiful spot, and it all happens with time to see the curtain rise on the night's production.  Don't forget to have desert and coffee at the first intermission and smile as the other patrons watch you enjoy.",2,2,2
48,Doc B.,"East Freehold, NJ",0,30,2,3.0,11/18/2013,"My wife and love fine dining and well orchestrated evenings out. I'll give both the good and bad of Grand Tier. First the good. It is located on the grand tier level of the Met Opera and the only way to get a seating is to have a ticket to the opera. So you know you will be in a crowd of like minded people out to enjoy dinner and a show. Secondly the room is massive with vaulted ceilings, snowflake chandeliers and gorgeous Chagalls hanging right above. The moon rose over the plaza and provided a great view. The service was punctual and professional. Compared to other high end restaurants I would give them a solid B. Food was relatively tame in presentation but tasteful. Wines were available by the glass and bottle and fairly priced. Don't look for fabulous Boudreaux or Chablis but you can find good pairings. Dessert was a highlight, served during intermission waiting for us at the same table we had for dinner. Now the bad. We are a relatively affluent couple in our fifties. We are used to good seating and attention at most restaurants. We are usually of average age of other patrons at restaurants but here I felt like a teenager at a fine French restaurant. We were relegated to the seating next to the service board so got a fine view of all the servers, patrons and other staff. So not a place for romance and conversation with my bride. I felt like I was at the bottom of a geriatric ladder. The average age of patrons had to be above 70. I suppose I need more seasoning to get better seating. Something to consider when booking. You can't take home your leftovers. My wife left half of her dinner because she was full. You can't substitute things you don't like. Dinner is a timed event by design. Not a real problem but it felt strange to move so quickly through such a rich dinner. So you will have to do your own QPR for the elegant surroundings, location and relative dinner service and quality. I may do another meal here but would definitely book a better seating ahead and lower my expectations. Overall an average high dining experience with potential for a much better service.",,,
49,Leslie S.,"Los Angeles, CA",81,441,2,2.0,12/12/2014,"Going to the Grand Tier and expecting the same quality and service as say Patina in Los Angeles, a member of the same restaurant group, is like going to a Wolfgang Puck Cafe and expecting to be on par with Spago...it ain't going to happen. The difference between those two comparisons is at least at Wolfgang Puck Cafe you're not paying Spago prices. I'm still more than a little irked by my experience last night at Grand Tier and if it wasn't for the amazing 2005 Vina Ardanza Riserva I enjoyed, I would have given 1 star. We had a 6:00 reservation before seeing La Traviata and I arrived a bit early. I was one of the first tables seated in what was quite possibly the worst table in the place. After politely asking if I could move to one of the many two tops that were empty I was shown the second and third worst tables in the place. I asked why I couldn't get something better than looking at the Hostess stand and having everyone congregating around there butts in my face or amongst the potted planrts and and the table set up to sell memorabia I was told people have already requested certain tables, sorry but I'm calling BS on that one. I had a bad taste in my mouth already and the food and service did nothing to change that. Our waiter was not only non-existant but had no personality and said somewhere between 3-5 words the entire time. Oh, and we had to basically tackle him to get our check but in his defense, he probably thought we were workers taking a break at the break table. The food did not fair much better. I ordered the acorn squash with arugula, iberico ham and marcona almonds and I'll admit this was very good. I also ordered the parsnip soup with truffles and this was the only dish that was served at the proper temperature. My partner ordered the fish, I think it was sea bass? with beans and what came was a tiny nugget, and I say nugget because it was grossly overcooked on top of what looked like canned baked beans. I think they prepare all the entrees ahead of time because everything is cold and feels like it's been sitting around for awhile. I ordered a side of steamed spinach that arrived in a pool of water and was very cold. I flagged down our waiter, finally, and very nicely asked if I could get some that wasn't cold and he looked confusedly at me and said ""It's cold?"" uhm yes, very much so. He returns a few minutes later with a plate that was maybe 3 degrees warmer. I left my $12 mound of soggy leaves alone. My bfriend insisted on having dessert, I personally just wanted to get out of there, so he ordered the creme brulee which again, was served very cold and the refrigerated cup you get at my local bodega is way better. I was so dissappointed at this whole experinece and before tip the bill was over $200. DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR, SKIP THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!",1,2,
50,Michael G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,66,0,4.0,3/9/2012,"I will start by addressing a ""tip"" in another review which said the dress code is formal. There is no dress code. On a weekend most people will be dressed formally. It is not required. And they will not only not make you feel uncomfortable, I have been given one of the best seats in the house and I was not dressed formally.But dress up. It's The MET ! If not here, where ? On to the restuarant. The hostess was very nice. The waitstaff as well.

54,derrick c.,"Bronx, NY",4,48,5,1.0,7/3/2011,"If I could rate it lower, I would. First let me say that the food is not terrible but it is highly mediocre. I decided to give it 1 star because a meal for 2 cost $150 including the tip. We each had a glass of wine and we both had the salmon. I had asparagus as a side and the lady I was dining with had mashed potatoes.  I could only imagine how much the bill would have been had we decided to have some appetizers or dessert and coffee. The salmon was bland and the asparagus was steamed and not really all that tasty. A couple dining next to us ordered the fruit plate as their dessert and it looked like it was purchased from Costco or something. The service was good but when I go to eat, I want good food as well.What really ticked me off is the fact that this place has the potential to be awesome. We were going to see Swan Lake that evening so it was really an excellent idea to make reservations at this restaurant because it is located inside The Met. My belief is that the restaurant takes advantage of the fact that they are located where they are. It would be just as easy to serve some amazing food there but the fact is, they don't have to because people will dine there anyway because of the convenience. I have no problem paying $150 for a meal, but it has to be worth it. I don't want to walk out of a restaurant feeling as if I didn't get my money's worth and that is exactly what I felt when I left this place.",3,1,

Updated review","Second visit I tried the Sea Bass, which was unremarkable and served with the smallest possible quantity of eggplant/zucchini sautee (maybe two tablespoons?). Not sure why the Lilliputian portion sizes. There was a delicious cold carrot soup, though. Excellent Key Lime Pie. The room was absolutely freezing for some reason and it did not improve after I complained. Service was excellent. Best coffee around. But the small portions are just silly.",,,
56,Elizabeth R.,"Paris, France",6,21,0,5.0,1/22/2009,"Went here recently while going to the opera (obviously), and I was really impressed at the logistics of this place.  The only negative thing about the experience was our fault, not the restaurant's. (more to follow)First of all, this is a beautiful space.  If you are going for a night at the opera, you might as well go all out and put up the cash for dinner here.  We joined the herds as soon as intermission began, and were impressed by the logistical feat that this restaurant had achieved.  For intermission dining you are required to place your order ahead of time, but still, when we arrived at our table our appetizers, wines, entrees, and desserts were ready and waiting.  The entree plates were even positioned over little flames to keep warm (im impressed by cuteness).  I started out trying to act appropriately for the setting, but I eventually started wolfing down my food as I realized intermission is not very long.  Because of this, it's difficult to reflect on food quality, although I seem to have tasty, although blurry, food memories.This is the part that was our fault, not the restaurants, that we probably should have only planned on desert for intermission dining, instead of appetizers, entrees, wines, and dessert.  Next time I would go for pre-show dining and then have dessert at intermission (something to look forward to!).In any case, this was a great part of a wonderful evening at the opera, and I would recommend this to anyone already shelling out opera-level cash. yum!",7,3,3
57,Sarah T.,"Los Angeles, CA",86,239,27,5.0,1/27/2007,"Yelling 'THIS SHIT IS GOOD' in the halls of the Metropolitan Opera auditorium will probably get you some dirty looks but that was what I wanted to do when I had the CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE. Just surf the web or Zagat's and you'll hear about it. I'm not even a huge admirer of these foo foo French concoctions. It was just the right amount of sweetness and so well made, you know yo mama's chocolate cake recipe won't hold up to this. It's not a regular restaurant because you can ONLY eat there before an opera or split up your meals between two intermissions. I didn't go for a full-blown meal. But I made a reservation at the restaurant before the show started. Then at intermission, you come to your table and it's immediately there. There's enough time to eat it all, just as long as you keep a good pace of shoving it down your throat. After all, it's only an intermission. BTW, it's located on the second floor of the opera house (grand TIER...) so you be needing an opera ticket to get in. But it makes going to the Met Opera all that more special.And if your buddy doesn't like operas, you can bribe him to go eat here. FYI, for some reason, it's F-ing freezing in there.

58,Adrian B.,"San Francisco, CA",14,80,7,4.0,9/2/2007,"Ok, four and a half stars.  Five if you count the service.First off, you eat here ONLY if you are going to the Opera.  Because the restaurant is IN the Opera House, on the Grand Tier (hence the name, Sherlock Holmes I ain't!)The food is excellent, falling just short of being outstanding.  The salmon is excellent, as is the chocolate souffle.  If this were just any restaurant in Manhattan, I'd say, okay, but not worth $200 plus.However, the amazing thins is how they coordinate it all.  You see, they just serve during intermissions really.  So, you put in your order when you arrive at the opera (you DID make a reservation, didn't you?) and then there is a flurry of activity as the intermission approaches, as all the waiters try to coordinate serving hundreds of patrons simultaneously.  You walk out at the intermission and they direct you to your table.  There, your dinner is waiting for you, piping hot, the wine poured, etc.  Did I mention that hundreds of people are sitting down simultaneously?  It goes off without a hitch AND the food is pretty outstanding.Okay, I'm impressed.",6,,1
59,Tricia K.,"New York, NY",17,132,0,4.0,10/28/2011,"A wonderful place to start off an evening at the opera. I dined here last Friday before a fantastic performance of Anna Bolena. The dining room is as elegant and grand as can be. Service was attentive and polite. The clientele is definitely more mature, i would put the average age around 60. However, everyone was in high spirits and dressed to impress. My boyfriend recognized Brian Lehrer from NPR, and that upped the coolness factor for him.The restaurant is expensive, but the food, while un-inventive, is worthy. You are there for the atmosphere and the experience, and I think it is good that the food is classic and does not distract from the atmosphere. We started with the watercress and endive salad.  I enjoyed the Branzino with capers and tomato, and my boyfriend had the spinach tortellini. For dessert, I had the opera gateau, which was delicious. It appears that there is only one pre-theater dinner seating. We arrived a bit late for our 6:30 reservation, but were seated without trouble. However, it seems that perhaps they begin filling the tables in the front (overlooking the plaza) first and then work their way back, so for a better view, arrive early (that could also be a space for members).",,,1

61,Orfelina A.,"Rahway, NJ",5,8,0,3.0,4/5/2014,"My husband and I have been to the grand Tier twice, and will probably return the next time we go to another opera, mainly because of how convenient it is to have good food during intermission, for the service and for the setting..... You can't beat it. The first time we had appetizer with champagne and everything was perfect. The champagne was perfectly chilled, oyster and tuna fresh and delightful. Last night we were running late after dinner and decided we would get dessert at the Grand Tier  And I wasn't as pleased..  Service was great but our proseco was room temperature, the chocolate soufflé was just ok and for $17.00 I expected delicious, my lemon desert was very generic and the cappuccino was good, but for $90 (including tip) for two very average desserts, two glasses of proseco and one cappuccino you can understand why I would expect perfection. I guess there is a price tag for the setting which is lovely. We will return, as I indicated earlier for convenience, but I will make it a point to request my drinks be poured upon my arrival and I will stick to things you can't mess up, such as oysters.",,,
