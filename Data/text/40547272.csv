0,Saumik D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0.0,5.0,11/10/2018,"Generally I am extremely sceptical of 'speakeasy' places, with their 'door policy' and attitude! Having read some of the reviews it seems that ownership have genuinely taken on board the comments.Extremely polite lady at the door, seated immediately and a very helpful and friendly waiter.Refreshing to see this positive attitude and demeaner at an establishment such as Death and Co. Long may it last!",,,
1,Norman L.,"Brooklyn, NY",257,63,13,4.0,10/8/2018,"The decor didn't wow me for an established speakeasy in Manhattan. We were seated at the bar, but it was a tight space to sit. I had three cocktails and they were all absolutely well balanced. I always try a rye cocktail at any new watering hole I patron, but especially a place where they charge $20 for a drink. If they mess up a simple rye cocktail then it shouldn't be a place to go for fine spirits. I had the original old fashioned, which was well balanced like most bars I go to. Surprisingly all the drinks I ordered were well made and well balanced. I hate it when I ordered a drink and the taste of the spirit would be overwhelming compared to the rest of the ingredients. Great drinks, poor lighting. I would prefer better seating options and a bit more intimacy.",,,
2,Filippo E.,"Manhattan, NY",54,4,1,1.0,9/28/2018,"I walked through the door and asked if the bar was closed, they said yes and I said sorry and thank you. then I asked if my two friends that were waiting outside could walk through the door, see the place and leave right after.two tourists, and I brought them there because I am (most likely I WAS) a regular and I was proud to show them one of the best bars ever.well, the rudeman (gentleman would be an overstatement) that was supposed to be at the door (he was inside, nice way of being an host) told me ""no, no, it's ok, no"" while pushing me out.well I think this is nothing but an unnecessary display of arrogance while I was very polite and respectful, and it wouldn't have been no harm just to let them see your place.anyways, if you think that you don't need new customers or that manners are not important, than maybe success got over your heads.customers aren't always right but they sure pay your bills.that's it from a former regular, since from now on (I'm sure you don't care but I'll say it anyway) I will no longer be one.",1,3,
3,Sarah S.,"Chicago, IL",4699,2638,17919,5.0,9/6/2018,"I'm fairly certain Death & Co is the darkest bar I've ever been in. It's so dimly lit you can barely read the menu but my friend & I were sat at the bar so could use the lovely candlelight to aid us. They don't take reservations so you have to roll in & hope you can snag a spot! Death & Co is a fairly hidden little cocktail bar behind a big door, then you are escorted to your seat if one is available.The bartender at the main bar was just fantastic the evening we went - friendly, quick and eager to help. They have a great many cocktails available with my friend settling on Inspector Norse and Scarlet Tanager, both setting up back a cool 17 bucks. Drinks are expensive but we both agreed they were very well made, excellent combinations and the best drinks on a 5-stop-cocktail-bar-hop we did that evening.Death & Co is expanding and I'm hoping they open in Chicago! I have a good feeling it would do really well in my city.",17,9,19
4,Theresa B.,"Washington, DC",637,487,1254,3.0,9/7/2018,"The only reason I'm giving a three instead of a two is the atmosphere/concept. Yes, it's badass and gothy as hell. That's the point. There are skulls on the stair banisters, the bar is literally pitch black with the exception of candlelight, and I was living for it. That was basically it, though. The manager/bouncer/whatever was shamelessly rude when we and a few other people tried to open the door like 5 minutes before they were technically open, essentially slamming the door in our faces. I get that it's New York and your bar is trendy and cool but I'm still about to give you my money. You can be a little more gracious.Every drink I had here with the exception of one was totally repulsive. EVERYTHING somehow tasted like whiskey regardless of whether it had whiskey in it or not, and I'm all for strong drinks, but there's a fine line between strong and ""I cannot physically swallow this.""When I basically told our bartender that I had hated all of my drinks so far, he did go out of his way to ask me what I like and make me the bubbly, fruity wuss concoction I was really just hoping for at that point. That was nice of him and I appreciated it, but overall, I was still disappointed.I would recommend going here once just to experience the uniqueness of it, since in my opinion, that's all it really has going for it.",5,4,3
5,Scott Matthew C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",2,46,67,3.0,7/31/2018,"It's a dark candle lit room.Candle lighting is nice. However, if the space was bigger and the tables were spaced out it would compliment the candle lighting. It's hard to read the menu. Let your eyes adjust or use your light on your phone. Lobo: 5! Refreshing! Inspector Morse: 4 stars!The Lonesome Crowded West : 3 Stars!",2,,
6,Andrew L.,"Chicago, IL",105,73,231,5.0,8/6/2018,"There was about a 2 hour wait for 2 people. It was still worth waiting for. The place is very dimly lit so it is hard to read the menu unless your a cat. If you don't have feline vision, you can use your phone for lighting and hopefully nobody will judge you. I had the primrose to start. I normally am not a big tequila/mezcal fan, but they were able to done down the agave in this drink considerably. It was replaced with a nice smokiness taste and citrus aroma. Great boozy drink to start with.My sister had the hummingbird. She said it was the best cocktail she's ever had. You have to take her word with a generous helping of salt because she is a college sorority girl so she knows nothing about good quality drinks. It was damn good though. For our next round of drinks we asked the bartender to make us something she thought we would enjoy. I asked for mint, lime, pineapple flavors and got something super delicious (but not sure what the name was, even if it had one).My sister wanted passionfruit. She got that too.For my last drink I had the day of the dove. It was both very Scotchy  while being really refreshing. I can't believe it worked as well as it did. I guess this place is called death and co since after you drink here you can die happy.",1,1,
7,Julie L.,"Pompano Beach, FL",81,93,119,4.0,7/3/2018,"I'm not sure if they take reservations or not but be prepared to wait. I was here early on a Tuesday night and had to wait about 30 minutes for a party of 3. Dark, speakeasy vibe. A little nosier than others and unfortunately the booths can be very aggravating. The party next to mine kept laughing and bumping into the booth which easily swayed mine. This did not make for the most pleasant experience. Try to get a booth seat with a back against a wall! There is a vast selection of cocktails and the servers are more than accommodating if you have any trouble selecting. Everyone in my party loved all of the drinks that were ordered. They also have a small bites menu, we ordered the pretzel. It's served with pub cheese and mustard and it was delectable! Fun place but cocktails are a little on the pricey side for what they were.",2,,
8,D P.,"Denver, CO",0,18,1,4.0,11/18/2018,"Not great but not bad. Underwhelmed to say the least. Cocktails were delicious but nothing mind blowing. We were quoted a 2 hour wait but thanks to my smoking hot wife, we got in in 20 minutes.",,,
9,Cindy T.,"Milpitas, CA",152,43,65,4.0,9/19/2018,"I had an interesting experience with the ""wait"" since I didn't really have a wait - I came around 6 on a Saturday and there was only one group outside. The host got my name and number, and I asked if my friend and I could come back later and he said yes, just text us when you're ready! I texted him after our dinner around 7:15 and he said we could come and the table was ready for us. Safe to say I didn't wait at all! As most said, it's very dark but I didn't have trouble reading the menu. We asked our server for drink recommendations on something light, easy to drink and gin based and she gave us 2 great options! I got the Catamaran and if you like Gin and coconut this is the drink for you. We also got the cheese plate, nothing special - 3 types of cheese, grapes, macadamia nuts, honey. As of mid September 2018, they're still on the Summer menu. Drinks are pricey but it's NYC - you're paying for the experience.",,1,
10,Rashi T.,"Portland, OR",8,65,10,4.0,10/25/2018,"This is the longest I have ever waited to get inside a bar, and i have been to same great bars in the city . The wait time was almost 2 hours and when we did get in , i honestly did not feel that the wait did justice to the experience .Don`t get me wrong the place indeed is good and the drinks were quite fascinating as well. The bar was dimly lit and indeed very crowded which explained the long wait . We ended up befriending the guys right next to our table and they made some awesome recommendations for drinks .I would give the cocktails a 3 on 5 since most of them did not cater to my taste , but I am sure they do a fab job of it since they are so popular , just not for me. Overall a good bar for one of those bar hopping nights .",,,
11,Guido V.,"Kenosha, WI",69,249,715,5.0,4/8/2018,Death and company was recommended to me by a friend (thanks Beth) and she did not disappoint one bit.  This evening a friend and I were the first to enter.  The first things to note as you enter is how substantial and initiating the entry is... Huge Door being managed for entry based on age and traffic of course.  This is a small and intimate bar.   The first thing you will notice is how incredibly DARK it is inside and how massive the bar itself is... So many bottles!  Bartending here is pure art and science - these mix master are really working as you watch them mix your drinks which are superb.This was on my must do list for a long time... I will be back!The rest I will leave for you to experience for your own - you will enjoy it.,2,,4
12,Steph M.,"Lincoln, RI",94,41,0,5.0,10/13/2018,My brother goes to the Culinary Institute of America and is really into craft cocktails. Apparently this is a place to go among his culinary friends and we let him take us here. We were so impressed! The drink menu is awesome and we got some food. I am still dreaming about the cheese curds and want to go back just to get them. They were So good and the batter on them was amazing! We also got fries which were really tasty and the seasoning was great and we got the popcorn. I am a popcorn lover and this has great seasoning on it. Can't wait to go back and get the cheese curds!!,1,,
13,Elaine N.,"San Francisco, CA",748,857,2327,5.0,9/12/2018,"Definitely worth visiting for their artisanal cocktails.  I got the Paradise Lost - Rhum JM Blanc, St. George Green Chile, Yellow Charteuse, Pineapple and Lime which was great. Dark and intimate ambiance, plenty of bar and booth seating available, and on the louder side.",2,1,1
14,Hannah D.,"Philadelphia, PA",201,286,789,5.0,12/30/2017,"This place definitely lived up to its reputation. We were fortunate that we arrived right before 6 PM because a line formed quickly. They don't take reservations and it's a small place.Exterior was interesting craved wood.  The interior was cozy and very dimly lit. It had a nice intimate atmosphere. The waitress was on point. The drinks selections were extensive and menu had most spirits.   However if you told her what you were in the mood for she made very good recommendations.  She asked for preferred liquor, citrus, sweet etc.  We did not have a single bad drink.  They all had funny names which makes it hard to remember.  Nice place to talk not too loud.Food wise we only tried the fries which was standard.  We had dinner reservations elsewhere for dinner.  Overall great ambiance and interesting cocktails- would certainly return!",4,1,3
15,Sam K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",626,305,525,2.0,11/30/2017,"If you're into the smug hipster scene and expensive drinks that look great on paper, yet are terrible, this place is for you! We arrived around 10:30pm on a Saturday night, and put our names on the list to get into this speakeasy. The door man told us we would be 25th on the list. So, we went to some other nearby bars while we waited. At around midnight, we got a text that our group of 4 had a table ready. We quickly paid our tab at Mother of Pearl and headed over. The vibe was dark and pretentious as we entered. However, the doorman was friendly and showed us to a table inside. As we looked over the menu by dim candle light, very bad hipster music played in the background.Unlike everyone else at the table, I enjoyed my drinks. I wish I could tell you what they were called, but I can't find the names on the menu from their site. One was like an old fashioned and the other was a rum drink. Sorry, that's all I remember! My friends hated all of their drinks. However, my wife had the Hawaii 5-0 and, though she didn't like it, I thought it was good, as did the rest of the group.One of our friends asked the waitress some educated questions about drinks on the menu and she didn't have a clue what he was talking about and gave BS answers. By all means, try this place, if you want. You may like it, but we didn't. Mother of Pearl, around the corner was wayyy better IMO, but a much different atmosphere.",11,6,4
16,Amanda W.,"London, United Kingdom",230,96,259,4.0,1/1/2018,"TLDR: dimly lit speakeasy with friendly staff and creative cocktailsHave been wanting to try this place for a while after seeing it on a number of speakeasy / bar lists online. Arrived around 12:30am on a Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised that there was no wait.When we walked in, the place was full and pretty loud, with all tables and most bar seats occupied. We were seated at the bar near the door and, while it was a bit cramped, there were luckily purse / jacket hooks under the bar. We began flipping through the extensive menu and decided on the star sapphire (tequila, gin, vanilla, grapefruit, pimento) and sierra norte (mezcal, chile, honey, cacao, don's mix, lemon). The star sapphire was pretty fruit-forward and the perfect mix of sweet, sour, and spicy. Given that I'm not a fan of mezcal, I found my sister's drink to be too strong and barbecue-like.The bartender was very nice and attentive, refilling our waters periodically and asking if we needed anything. We decided to get another round consisting of a celine fizz (gin, grapefruit, elderflower, lemon, egg white) and dreamscape (brandy, escubac, sour apple, nocino). The celine fizz was a cocktail retired from the menu but prepared when I requested something that was gin-based, citrusy, and had elderflower liqueur. I found it to be a bit one-dimensional, tasting like a gin and tonic with a hint of lemon. The dreamscape was too strong for my liking and tasted a bit like an old fashioned.Overall, I enjoyed the ambiance, service, and creativity of the cocktails and would be interested in returning with a larger group to try some of their large format drinks.",2,1,
17,Dorothy E.,"New York, NY",2,11,13,1.0,8/26/2018,"Very rarely do I leave a bad review but I felt inclined after my first experience at Death & Co.On a Saturday evening upon opening, my girlfriends and I wanted to meet up here for some cocktails before our night out. I arrived and opened the door at 5:59 PM and I came face to face with a gentleman who preceded to close the door on me and said ""We open at 6:00 PM"". The group of guys behind me laughed because of the ridiculousness of the interaction one minute before opening. Since it was my first time, I did not realize ID check and seating requests happened outside.After waiting in the short line,  the same gentleman asked what my party size was. I had a party of 4 but two of my girlfriends would be arriving later. He said that he could only sit a full party so I asked if my one girlfriend and I could sit at the bar. Once my other girlfriends arrived we could see if any tables were available...apparently not! He told me that no, I could not sit at the bar and that there were some nice bars around the corner...So, I've lived in new york for 8 years and this is the most inhospitable and ridiculous customer service I've ever had in New York...especially in the east village which is known for their good food, good drinks, and awesome diverse people. I understand some places are more difficult to get into but I find it hard to believe that a bar that just opened at 6PM on a weekend with less than 10 people inside would not let 2 women sit at the bar. I've heard good things about this place from friends and colleagues but I won't be coming back!",5,,
18,Myles C.,"Brooklyn, NY",436,198,30,3.0,6/16/2018,"Hm. Well we came on a Friday night with no reservation so I expected a wait. They texted about an hour later (we were at McSorley's) and so we went from $5.50 beers to $17 cocktails. I'm not going to say it was a mistake but there are definitely some things to note. It's dark as sin in there, with pretty much exclusively candles providing any sort of light - I suppose the mood they're going for is the 1700s. And that's including the bathroom. I sat down on the toilet seat because I was afraid I'd make a mess in the darkness. The weird part is that despite the ambiance I thought they were trying to create (dark, sexy, intimate), it was LOUD, people talking as if deaf and occasionally a girl screaming with laughter. I could barely hear my friend and we had to lean forward to talk to each other. If that was part of their plan to make it intimate, well done; otherwise, there are some major discrepancies in the atmosphere they were trying to convey. Anyway, service is pretty standard, as were the drinks. I had a 'Lobo' and was not blown away in terms of complexity or flavor - the mezcal overpowered the other ingredients. If you're familiar with Philadelphia, this bar was almost identical in vibe to The Franklin Mortgage & Investment Bank (bar). It's not a bad bar, but nothing about it stands out besides the price - and not in the good way.",1,1,
19,Samantha W.,"New York, NY",230,67,103,3.0,7/5/2018,Honestly it was a cool experience and the drinks were pretty good but the whole system to get in was a mess. Our friend put her name down at 8:30 and we weren't given any indication of when the table would be ready. We went to eat and got a text around 10:30 but by the time we got there (~15min) they'd already given the table away. At that time a friend had to leave so we got into a completely different line for a group of 5. We didn't get in until 12:30,,,

I never used my card again  but someone used itmy card number make a $300 purchase later that evening.

22,Chelsea T.,"Boston, MA",398,127,878,5.0,11/6/2017,"I am a HUGE fan of Death & Co., even after just one visit.My companion and I went there on a Saturday night around 8PM, and there was already a wait. But no worries - there is a lady up front that will take your name and phone number down and let you know when a spot opens up. We didn't have to wait too long, it was just about 20 minutes. *** If you are into craft cocktails - make sure to get a bar seat so you can watch the bartenders work their magic! The menu is a tad overwhelming if you don't have a preference on the liquor base of choice. I usually go for rum or gin-based cocktails. We got:- Dixieland Julep (Pierre Ferrand 1840 Cognac, Ron Zacapa 23 Rum, Lemon Hart 151 Rum, Bittermens NOLA Coffee, Fernet Branca, Pineapple Gomme): The coffee in this was a little overwhelming for me, but this is definitely a very potent drink- Sugar Magnolia (Tyrconnell Single Malt Irish, Redbreast 12yr Irish, Dolin Blanc, Lustay Papirusa Manzanilla Sherry, Campari, Rose, Peychaud's, Absinthe): My companion liked the complexity of this drink but found the lingering aftertaste of absinthe to overpower the other components of this cocktail.- Golden Lancehead (Rhum JM Agricole Blanc, Clear Creek Williams Pear, Chareau Aloe, Green Chartreuse, Lime): This drink was good - but I was a little tipsy and can't recall exactly what it tasted like.- Side Eye (Tapatio Blanco Tequila, Del Maguey Vida Mezcal, Leopold's Sour Apple, Strega, Ginger, Lime, Celery Bitters): We agreed that this was our favorite - there was just something about the bitters, sour apple and tequila that mingles perfectly together. The atmosphere of the bar is great, music isn't too loud, and the bartenders were very friendly. After tax and without tip, the four cocktails came up to close to $70. Definitely not cheap, but the experience is worth a little splurge. It would be a waste to come here and get a beer/wine. Get the cocktails!",5,1,5
23,Elizabeth R.,"Minneapolis, MN",283,604,1320,5.0,10/30/2017,"YAAAAAS.This is my kind of cocktail lounge! It's dimly lit (use the candle to read the menu), the cocktail list is varied, the servers are floating around like ghosts, the snacks are tasty, and they're playing Joy Division. What more could I ask for, tbh? Nothing!We showed up here to add our names to the list around 8 PM on a Saturday night. For four people, there was a wait of around two hours. NBD, we headed down the street to Amor y Amargo to pass the time. Two of our party abandoned us for donuts and bed, so we updated the man handling the list via text message and we were promptly given a spot inside.I'll be honest: the man handling the door is obnoxiously pushy about making sure you go outside. There are no signs that you aren't to enter until greeted by the man with the list, but he acts like you should just know. I assume this deters several people, but it's also New York so I expect people to be jerks for no good reason.Once inside, it's dark and leathery and everything my frozen little heart desires. I'd been up early and it was around 10 PM at this point, so I just had a single cocktail before making my way back to my Airbnb. I went with the Between the Lines, which was DELICIOUS. I savored every sip of that cocktail. We also had the Crispy Fries with bleu cheese and chives, which were also delicious. I did find the hunks of bleu cheese too large to stay on the fries easily, so they were a little challenging to eat. The fries were perfectly crispy, though!It was a little loud, but it appeared to be a very small space with many people in it, so it's not that surprising. I could still easily hear my friend across the table and I could hear the server, so it wasn't terribly off-putting.I'd really like to go here on a more relaxed night during the week, and also preferably when I hadn't been day drinking since noon. (Vacations are the best, amirite?) Definitely a must-stop on my next visit!",3,2,4
24,Mel T.,"New York, NY",414,1210,2866,3.0,10/25/2017,"I've heard about Death & Co but never thought to give it a visit until recently. Two friends and I were in the area for dinner. One of them suggested that we put our names on the list before we go to dinner so that by the time we finished, there would be a spot for us. So that's what we did. We went back at around 9 (on a Thursday) and were able to get in without an issue. In fact, the place was half empty. I'm not sure if it was because it was still early, or if maybe Thursday is just not a poppin' night. I'm not complaining though because that just means there was no wait for us.Inside, it's very dark. You'll need the candlelight just to look at the menu. It seems like a romantic place to bring a date but it was actually pretty loud in there, so I don't know if I would recommend that. We browsed the extensive menu and I finally settled on the Concrete Jungle (Elijah Craig bourbon, yaguara ouro cachaca, orgeat, mango, cholula, lemon). I really enjoyed it. It was perfectly made and not too sweet.I don't see myself grabbing casual drinks here since it's pretty expensive (cocktails start at $16).

Secondly, my adorable sweet mom grazed the guys arm to ask him a question and he screamed at her disrespectfully ""first of all don't fucking touch me"" wowww I was floored.

26,Ashley M.,"Austin, TX",83,250,116,5.0,4/16/2018,"I discovered Death & Co on an Esquire list of ""Best Cocktail Bars in NYC"" and made it a priority to stop by during my trip to the Big Apple. Man, am I  glad I did.Death & Co reminds me of my go-to cocktail bar in Austin, The Roosevelt Room. It is quaint like most places in NYC, elegant, dark, candle-lit, and above all, sexy and romantic. First of all, the entrance is a big, conspicuous wooden door with no signage, so kind of a speakeasy vibe. When my friends and I arrived on a Friday night they said there was a wait of an unknown length. They couldn't even give us an estimate of how long it would be, but we put our name down anyways. Not very convenient for planning, so we wondered the neighborhood looking for an alternative when maybe an hour later BOOM we got a text that our table was ready. Success! They could improve by accepting reservations and setting a time limit per table to allow more customers to enjoy this place, and to also give walk-ins a better idea of when they may get a table rather than ""unknown"".They have an extensive cocktail selection (including ""luxury"" options with the price tag to match) and a small food menu as well. I don't remember the exact name of what I ordered nor can I find it on the online menu, but I know it was fruity with both Tequila and mezcal, and one of the better cocktails I've had anywhere. Food wise, the beef sliders and cheese curds were phenomenal. I've been to a lot of cocktail bars across America, and Death & Co is one of the most impressive I've experienced. It lived up to everything I heard about it and then some. Come here.",2,1,2
27,Stephanie P.,"Oakland, CA",62,373,30,4.0,8/19/2018,"I have pretty terrible night vision, and I did not find this place as dark as folks are saying. I read my menu w/o problems and found it quite exciting--the choices of really thoughtful and over-the-top cocktails. This is probably the only place I would pay the money for the cocktails we got, which ranged $17 to $22. They were all special, and it's definitely a special-occasion place at that price point.I can second per another reviewer that the door man is stellar and professional. We had three total cocktails, which I believe were based in tequila, Japanese whiskey (Yojimbo--the $22 one and super special), and Rye, with all kinds of potions and ingredients we'd not thought heard of. To be fair, we came on a Monday night on a rainy day in August, so we managed to skip the whole wait thing. I think we were in and out in less than one hour and had our experience with no wait time.Why not 5 stars? Well, I don't get the whole, sit under air conditioner and get rained on thing in NY, and I don't feel kind about it. If you're getting dripped on throughout your stay at a restaurant you should be accommodated in some way (see also my review for Reunion). I had AC dripping on my head, glasses, and table, and although the server offered to move us as soon as something else came available, I don't see why we couldn't have just gotten a shot of Amaro or a few bucks off the bill.This seems to be an NY thing, but I don't grok normalizing it. It's just not comfortable to feel like you're getting rained on indoors.",1,1,

29,Courtney B.,"New York, NY",25,103,92,5.0,4/9/2018,"Had a great night at Death and Co. When I stopped by to put my name down the man at the door was very friendly and polite. He took my name and number down on an iPad that texted me a confirmation I had out my name down and I would be notified when a place became available. Once you are notified your table is available, you have ten minutes to return to the bar. When we returned, the host was very nice, had remembered my name and sat us immediately. One of the bartenders immediately came by and provided a food and the drink menu. He was very pleasant and checked in to see when we were ready. I ordered the Recordar (sp?) as it was one of the few menu drinks with mezcal which is my favorite. This drink was delicious and I would highly recommend. The mezcal flavor was not overpowering and it was served on a single large ice cube. Next I told the bartender some flavors I love and he created a custom off the menu mezcal drink which was very cool.  We also ordered shishito peppers that were very tasty. I've hear a lot of good things about their food in general and am excited to return.The staff was all very nice and prompt especially impressive on a Friday night. If you're looking for a unique cocktail experience or just a really great drink you should give this place a try!",2,,1
30,Urszula P.,"Manhattan, NY",56,151,472,4.0,4/22/2018,"I've loved this place for years. It's a very low lit, romantic space with a very large cocktail menu. However, you can always go off the menu if you feel inspired or ask the mixologists for their thoughts.Their system actually calls you back when your table is ready. It also helps to go in bad weather since less people are out. You can enjoy a drink next door at Amor y Amargo while you wait.",1,,

All cocktails tasted delicious. It's a great place for a date or hanging with friends. The only issue with this place is the wait. We arrived and were told we had to wait. We went to kill time and an hour later we get a call saying they're ready for us and when we arrived we had to wait like half an hour. Other than that, it's a cool bar.",,,
34,Laurel P.,"Edmonton, Canada",223,394,155,5.0,4/17/2018,"I had Death and Co on my must-visit list while we were in New York. It came highly recommended by friends and I've definitely spent some time drooling over their cookbook.I was warned that you should prepare for a long wait here. However the day we visited was cold and stormy which seemed to keep most New Yorkers at home. Lucky for us, we were able to walk in at 8pm on a weekday and get seated at a nice cozy corner booth. Since there were only 2 other groups in the bar, it made for a quieter atmosphere.The Periscope cocktail was incredible, definitely my favourite of the evening. It's a great option for those who don't particularly enjoy sweet drinks but still want something with interesting flavours.Overall the service was excellent and I love the low-lit atmosphere. I would love to come back here on a busier night to how lively it can get here.",,,
35,Adelina M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",391,303,676,4.0,1/19/2018,"What a fun place to come to. It's been open for about 10 years or so and really I cannot believe that this is the first time that I've ever visited. Just to tell you they don't take reservations and seating is first come first serve. The place is not huge inside so if you want to go I would suggest going early and waiting in line. And trust me the cocktails are worth the wait.So when you walk in it's just dark. The bar is lit by the candles from the tables and from the lights under the bar. Slightly off-putting at first but you get used to it quickly.I cannot even explain how extensive their menu is. There were pages and pages of different cocktails and if you couldn't find something good on that list they would make something up for you. The staff was so friendly and easy to talk to and was even available to think of good selections when being so busy. I appreciate good service when the bar was as busy as they were.If you go hear the cocktails are usual New York prices. You will probably be paying about $15 per cocktail so if you're looking to get tipsy this might not be the best place for you to start. But I will say that after two drinks I was feeling pretty good.The menu is really interesting because it tells you exactly if the drink is like shaken or stirred, the name, what type of glass it will come in, and the exact ingredients. The menu was awesome I really think that is probably one of the best parts of this place other than the delicious cocktails.We also ordered some food we got the sigmund's pretzel and the cheddar cheese curds. Both were delicious. The only thing that was sad is that we wanted the cheddar cheese curds over some crispy fries and they were out of fries. :-( for sure.My drink was the Stoned Love. This one had Absebtroux Menthe and Pear Eau de Vie. It was delicious. And the presentation of the glass was just amazing. I wanted to keep on drinking that's all night long. It really was as good as I'm making it out to be. It was fresh and crisp and just so easy to drink. I can't even remember what my other drink was because this one was just so good that's the one that stuck in my mind. I got to try out a lot of the cocktails since we are a party of five. But I will say that that Stone Love stuck in my mind and I will be getting that if I go back.Death & Company is an experience and anyone visiting or living in New York should try it out. It is fun and even better the cocktails are delicious.",4,1,3

The wait on a Saturday night is crazy so get there, get your name on the list and wait. The places isn't huge, which is typical for your friendly neighborhood speakeasy - this also explains the wait, which is well worth it.  Food: Cheese curds These curds are fire . Don't ask questions.

40,Akhila R.,"New York, NY",788,141,240,5.0,6/10/2017,"I was recommended to go to this place by one of my coworkers, who claimed that this place has the best cocktails in Manhattan.The bar is a lot easier to find than any other speakeasy I've been to in Manhattan, there's signage out front next to a large wooden door. The place is pretty small, just a few booths and the bar itself.We came in around 1am and there was no line. We were seated and served promptly. The physical menu looks like an actual book, very well designed and fun to peruse. The drinks are divided into four sections, mainly by light/dark liquors.The wait staff are extremely knowledgeable about flavors and taste palettes not just in the premade cocktails but if you want your own custom cocktail as well. I was really impressed by this when my friends and I couldn't decide what we wanted, the waiter expertly guided as to our drinks of choice!The cocktails themselves are the best cocktails I've ever had. I ordered the Hawaii five-o, a gin cocktail, and ventured out to try cloud nine, which to be honest I don't remember what it had in it other than egg white. The gin cocktail was amazing! It was fruity, sweet at the start but with a smiley aftertaste. It kinda reminded me of smoking a pineapple flavored hookah (in a good way) I was surprised at how dynamic the flavor was! The cloud nine was light and refreshing, and an excellent choice given that I normally don't drink liquor besides gin or wine.Highly recommend this place if you love cocktails and/or have a refined taste for them! (I'm still developing mine, but I could appreciate it regardless!)",5,,1
41,Tiffany T.,"Manhattan, NY",763,185,29,5.0,12/11/2017,"This is one of my FAV speakeasies in NY. Always be prepared to have a long wait if your party is greater than 2 people. I always stop by before dinner to drop my name off before heading off to dinner, this trick has saved me countless hours just wandering in the neighborhood or drinking elsewhere. I'm a big fan of their creative drinks but its not for everyone. When in doubt of what drink to order, the waitresses or waiters are super friendly and helpful in finding something that will suit your taste. Every visit is honestly a surprise because their menu is seasonal and I totally love it. Drinks are a little pricey ($16 / $18) but D E L I C I O U S!",3,,1
42,Mia S.,"New York, NY",4,54,24,4.0,2/20/2018,"Pros: the ambience was on point and there was good music playing.  Their cocktail list can be a little overwhelming, but in a good way. There's a solid set of options for everyone, regardless of what their drink preference is (type of liquor, sweetness, etc).  We also got their charcuterie board and cheese board which I found to be well balanced with the right mix of familiar favorites with a couple more adventurous options.  The honeycomb on the cheeseboard was a nice touch.Cons: not necessarily a negative but this place is a little more expensive than the average cocktail bar (at least by my standards).  Also at one point my party was shushed for laughing too loud by the hostess.  I understand they want to keep a certain vibe and level of decorum, but we were the only people seated in our general vicinity and it really was just a loud laugh.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed this place and would go back.",,,
43,Elizabeth C.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",740,365,876,2.0,11/27/2017,"Did not like Death & Co. Out of the 8 drinks ordered by my party, only one of them sort of tasted okay. My friends and I tried to get into Death & Co on a Friday night and were told that there were 24 parties ahead of us. The doorman said he would text us if we made it off the wait list. We never heard back. On Saturday, the next day, we tried again. This time we were the 27th party on the list! Oddly enough we got a text from them just 2 or so hours later!! We were so excited as we thought for sure we would never get to try this speakeasy out. Once we were seated, we had our orders taken by a waitress who seemed to have no desire to be at work. She answered all of our questions by taking the words we used and placing them in a different order. It was super weird. Anyway, there were four of us and we each ordered two drinks. I tried all, as I mentioned earlier, and blegh. They all tasted like straight liquor. They all had sooo many ingredients, but you definitely would not be able to tell. Oh and not only were the drinks disappointing, they were also pricey. We spent $169 on 8 drinks... yikes. Overall I would not recommend Death & Co... not unless you want to sit in the dark and drink what tastes like rubbing alcohol.",3,1,1

I introduced my friend to the idea of going to these apothecary bars and I came across this one. It's in a location in Manhattan I am very familiar with. Just like the idea of an apothecary, this place was almost hard to find, if you didn't have your GPS handy, you would surly walk pass it. Upon arrival there was a doorman who was very pleasant and let us in without any hassle. Waking in, you walk through a curtained archway into a small room which is the bar. I think the place is an intimate setting, too tight for large groups. We sat at the bar where we were able to get a full view of the bar and the mixologist doing their mixing. To drink I started with Kingdom Keys and finished with The Lonesome crowded west. Both drinks were absolutely delicious. I enjoyed Kingdom Keys a bit more because I love whisky. To eat I got the macaroons, which you are given two flavors, a lemon flavor and a salted caramel and the avocado skewers. Both absolutely delicious.  The avocado had a hint of mint, which now I don't think I can eat avocado any other way. I would definitely go back, hey maybe in a few days.

There's usually an hour wait but seems like Sunday around 9 is the best time to go to avoid the crowd. Drinks here are pricey but definitely worth every sip. The cheapest cocktail I could find was $16 but they can get as pricey as $49 per drink. Popcorn is salty, savory and sweet all in one. Oddly had black sesame tossed onto it as well.

On one of my visits my friends flew home a day before me so I decided to check out the city by myself on my last night.

Sam (bartender) has forgotten more about obscure booze and complimentary flavors than we'll ever know.

It is indeed a hideaway, the windows are boarded up, and the inside is lit 50-75% by candlelight. Don't get me wrong, the environment here is quite lively! But, this is not the kind of place you would go to have a couple shots too many, and then start dancing, possibly on the tables. Even If you wanted to dance, you probably wouldn't get the chance. The location is small, and you may rub elbows just a teeny tiny bit with your neighbors. The environment is a reason to come her in itself. There are not many bars that are lit primarily by candlelight, and it creates an indescribably awesome environment. The only drawback is that you may struggle reading their very vast cocktail menuIndeed, cocktails are the second reason to come here. Their cocktail menu is one of the best I've seen anywhere. It divides the drinks wonderfully by kind of alcohol, and by shaken vs stirred. It is also quite large, so there is definitely something for everyone. None of these are boring either... they are all created by people who are either in, or deserve to be in the cocktail hall of game.I had a Strange Encounters. In addition to the delicious combination of flavors, which had some gentle sweetness. I distinctly remember an absolutely wonderful tang! Definitely something to try if you are looking for a great, unique flavor! Drink was strong too, strong (and large enough) that I felt I got a great amount of bang (tang?) for the buck! Drink wasn't so strong that the alcohol overwhelmed the flavor though!Despite the place being nearly packed, the service was still very attentive (and nice)Will definitely return next time I am in NYC!",2,,

But I thought the people planning to come here had to hear this story.So we were here on a Saturday night. Two guys, planning to get some cocktails before moving on to some other place around to meet with our friends. We got into a conversation with two ladies sitting next to us. We spoke with them for a good half an hour and we were really enjoying our time there. As my friend was telling us a story, he touched to the shoulder of the lady sitting next to us, and all of a sudden, a waiter came and SLAPPED the hand of my friend, and told us that this ""is not one of THOSE"" bars and told that he'd be bringing us the check soon. My friend tried to explain the situation to the waiter. Since he couldn't reach his voice to the waiter, he leaned towards him and got even more of a harsh reaction and was told not to touch him. My friend and me, dumbfounded by the incident, wanted to speak to the manager. It didn't help much because the manager did not want to listen to us and said that we were ""invading the personal space of the ladies.""I could say more about the ambiance or the drinks but wish not speak more of this god-awful judgmental place.

I own the cocktail/mixology book they put out which I love, even though I can't really make any of the drinks because of the obscure ingredients. Needless to say, I had the highest of expectations coming in. I was pleased they were able to seat our party of 6 immediately. This bar is one of the darkest establishments I've ever seen (or rather..not seen because it was too dark). I imagine this is what medieval times felt like, straining with all your might to read by the light of the tiny candle on the table. To begin, I tried the Clockwork Orange. I liked this but it reminded me of other drinks I'd had. Didn't blow my mind, and neither did the other drinks I tried that my friends ordered. My second drink was the something with tequila that came in a coconut shaped cup, wish I could remember the name because it was really good. Most were priced reasonably for NYC but one of the drinks my boyfriend ordered was $25 (!!!!). He loved it but still....damn.Our group shared 2 cheese plates, which were kind of measly for $16 each.

It's just unfortunate that I keep ending up here at dinner time.I put my name down at 8 pm on a Friday and was told that there was only one party of 2 ahead of us. I met up with my friend to kill time at Ruffian (great place for orange wine but unbearably hot in the summer) a block up. We finally got that good text about 45 minutes later. We had to wait at least 5 minutes outside when we returned, which was mildly annoying.We had cozy seats at the bar with a view of the action. I was surprised that there were so many empty seats, but I guess there's a lag for those being summoned by text. Ambiance is great for a date but almost unbearably dark.The menu is big, conceptually organized, and interesting. These guys did launch the craft cocktail revolution. And almost all are $16, which is higher than average but not ridiculous. I went with the Vaquero: mezcal, tequila, corn husk, cacao. My friend had the Dixieland Julep, which on second look has quite a lot of ingredients. It was out within 5 minutes.Mine was up my alley and delicious, though I think I should have gone for something more adventurous as it was pretty smoke dominant. His was quite good.I needed food as I was imbibing pretty rapidly at this point. It took a while to get a menu and order since the bartender was so busy. I got shishito peppers, which I've had here before and are stellar. $8 seems like a ridiculous price, but they are a big pile of perfectly charred, a little oily, and salty Russian Roulette. I probably ate about 20 of these searching for the secret spicy ones.Here's where I made my crucial mistake. I saw the carrot dog on the menu, I thought ""I love hot dogs"" and ""I need vegetables"" simultaneously, and I ordered it.What I received had some tasty toppings on it, but there was no getting around it... it was a lightly-cooked, crisp carrot in a standard hot dog bun. I felt so honored to pay $12 for this.So stick to drinks-- they won't lead you astray. They typically live up to the hype here, though the popularity is irritating. If you really must munch, shishito peppers are the move, but for all that is holy, don't get the carrot dog.",4,3,2
67,Steve K.,"Manhattan, NY",355,69,87,3.0,7/29/2017,"One of the best-known speakeasys (what an oxymoron) in NYC, and after finally checking it out I'm not sure why. Swung by on a Tuesday night so got in with no wait. The dude working the front with the iPad really brings to mind the Prohibition era. Inside is dark as hell with flickering candlelit providing a nice woody, mysterious ambiance. What wasn't as cool was my date and I being seated right next to another party, with the tables being too close to each other so that the conversations from our neighbors were audible and vice versa. This would have been all forgivable if the drinks were actually good - they were weak, but obviously the price was inflated. I'm not expecting to get turnt at a classy speakeasy but you would need at least 3 drinks here to get a buzz..",1,2,2
68,Rapas C.,"New York, NY",241,72,211,5.0,8/11/2017,"Despite the wait, it was amazing. We were told there were two parties of two ahead of us so we thought it was going to be quick as was going wait at a park nearby, but since it was too dark we decided to go into another bar. Turns out to be perfect timing since we were done with our drinks, we were going to give up on the line and go home but happen to get the text right then. We headed over and waited outside for around five minutes for them to finish up.The menu was very extensive and my friends and I, since we are still kind of new and not very knowledgable about cocktails, we were like ""i don't even know any of these words"" it's like looking for a glass shape that I like with the illustration and try to see the base if I might like it. But obviously that's not a very wise choice so I gave up and just waited for the waitress to come by to ask for a recommendation.I told her I like gin and something more citrus, which she then recommended a drink on the menu that started with ""Hawaii"" but for some reason my guts was telling me that I wouldn't be a fan so I told her I also don't want it too sweet, which she then offer to get something off the menu that I might like and I decided to trust her. My friend also asked for a gin but with some sparkle so she also went for something off the menu. We had no idea what kind of drinks we were going to get, but that's the best part about speakeasy to me so I was very excited.We both LOVED our drinks and since we couldn't get over it and already spent an hour waiting in line, we asked her for a second drink--we want the same thing, but different! lol. and yes we both also DIED over our second drinks. Very, very happy with our experience and would DEFINITELY go back, hopefully the next time we will get something we enjoy as much!",1,,1

Comparing to all the other speakeasies I've been to, their drinks are just ok. And by that I meant just ok for the area. Their drinks are still reallllly awesome comparing to other cities and states.

What if it rains?"" ----- ""Death Becomes Her""Take my word for it, fellow immortal Yelpers, neither ""washed out color"", ""cracking paint"" nor ""irksome condensation"" could keep us away from ""Death & Co..."", the East Village's unrivaled, dark and dim ""speakeasy"" with a reputation that's just as unparalleled. Having friends that reside just a dolmen or so away from this place proved to be a bona fide attribute as they knew to phone in advance and further ensure our coven of 5 a table within our entry 2 hours later.In all truth, I was chocolate wasted at arrival. While I vaguely remember being carded, we walked in and were afforded our reserved booth. For what it's worth and as most have indicated, this place is IMPOSSIBLE to get into. Repeat: EMM-POSS-SEE-BULL!!!!While we'd eaten earlier, stricken with 'hanger pains' we veered towards ordering a few small bites coupled by a large quantity of booze. Our brief wait allowed us to further enjoy each others company, people watch and soak up the ambiance. I wholly envision ""Death & Co."" being the lavish lair for Lucifer or even more so,.......the blood-thirsty, Gothic / Transylvanian den of Dracula. Dark and sexy as hell (pun intended), albeit mysterious and beguiling. The 1,213 additional reviews, outside of my own, serve as testimonies from the bar's survivors yet I just as easily question how many departed without bite marks upon their necks.What TRULY deserves its own testimony is the cocktail catalogue; yes.......CATALOGUE! Evocative of, say......the annual Sears holiday catalog, this thing was quite possibly the most ginormous ""Bible of booze"" that I've ever held. Prepared to sin, we ordered the $60.00 ""Scorpion Bowl"", consistent of: ""Siembra Valles Blanco Tequila, Bacardi Heritage, Wray & Nephew Rum, Passion Fruit, Velvet Falernum, Allspice Dram, Orange, Lime, Angostura Bitters"" ---- and served, flaming.Compliments to the servers ANDDD the bartenders. This elixir was far from ""flaCCCCid"". Four sips into said ""potion"" and well,.......""I could see right through you!!!!""As not to become additional statistics, we requested the crispy fries ($8.00 - inclusive to chives and bleu cheese) as well as an order of popcorn ($6.00 - infused with a ton of garlic). **** MY THEORY: Garlic + Vampires = Substantiated LifelineThis ^ seemingly proved beneficial ...........emphasis on 'seemingly', and we were spared our lives (or so I thought), however I'm driven to think that perhaps something was in that little dranky drank' caus' I ain't been right since.....We were so ""stupid tossed"" when we stumbled out, just before sunrise, that it's a blessing we didn't wake up within the morgue. Thank God for Uber and thank Him again for our friend's close residential proximity.To any electing to veer against my 5 star assessment of this tempting tabernacle......you likely deserve a stake to the heart. As for me,....well, I've got this place calendared for the next blood moon. I'll likely require a ""touch up"" by then.In the interim...........Siempre Viva!!! Live forever!!!

77,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",914,269,1028,3.0,11/12/2016,"We came, we saw... And unfortunately, Death & Co did not conquer. We arrived at around 5:45 pm (they open at 6:00) and people were starting to gather around the bar. Around 5:55 or so, the hostess came out to inform everyone that they would be opening in a few minutes and we should form a line according to arrival time. We were seated third. As a party of two, we were taken in and given bar seats. Strike 1. The tables were obviously coveted real estate, and there were plenty of two-tops open, yet we were not given one. We ordered drinks (The Devil Made Me Do It and The Vigilante) and the charcuterie plate. The drinks were okay. Both were rated (by a number of dots on the menu) fairly adventurous, and yet they both tried like drinks we've had a million times before. At $16 for our cocktails, I would have expected better. They had a few ""luxury"" cocktails in the upper $20s as well. The charcuterie plate was underwhelming (really small at $16) with one meat we thought smelled and tasted exactly like cat food, really crispy bread, mediocre andouille, and (credit where credit is due) delicious mustard fruit. There was loud rock music playing in the background and the bar was fairly loud for a speakeasy. I wouldn't necessarily consider it a romantic date spot or classy cocktail bar. Overall, Death & Co failed to impress. I would put it one notch below Raines Law Room and several notches below its more conveniently accessed neighbor, Angel's Share. I would maybe come back and try another round of drinks sometime, but I won't be rushing back - especially when there are superior cocktail bars in the same price range.",4,2,2

We walked over & I loved the huge wooden doors and etched metal signs. The doorman caught me off guard, I thought it was just a dude hanging out. He let us in after a serious ID check and a five minute wait. We were seated in a dark corner booth & I swear I couldn't see the table. This place is dimly lit, very mysterious & built for vampires. I loved it and was also too tired to deal. The menu is split by alcohol type & we all tried different cocktails. Each one was tasty and had we not been rushing to the other place, I think we would have hung out longer and eaten more. The problem is these speakeasy bars add up! This is definitely a great hidden gem to check out if you like well made cocktails & appreciate a vintage atmosphere.",4,,4

It was a great selection. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. They were a pleasure. The bar had a lot of interest, so they had a waitlist for all the seats including the ones at the bar. There was a 30 minute wait for two seats on a Saturday night. There was no standing room. The atmosphere was extremely intimate.",,,

The service and amazing drinks got them up to a four. The girl at the door was super rude. SUPER rude. I'll give them 4 because she shouldn't affect the business as much as she already did. I started with a delicious mezcal negroni then decided to change gears. I forgot exactly what drink I had but I'm pretty sure their was gin and I know there was a splash of an IPA in there. It was bomb. That remained my drink for the rest of the time we were here. We kept asking him about other drinks he was making and he was more than happy to inform us. The ambiance is great here, the bartenders, servers, and the drinks themselves. Even with the SUPER rude girl at the door, I'm pretty sure I'll be back.

81,Emily D.,"New Brunswick, NJ",195,175,58,5.0,5/3/2017,"I've been here twice now, both times with friends. The first time I came, it was around 9pm on a Saturday and we put our names on the list for a table. The wait was 2 hours so we went around the corner to a different bar for a round while we waited for the text. The second time I went was around 6-7pm-ish and we were told the wait was 45 minutes, which it was. The thing that I like about this place is that they are consistent. Their drinks are consistently strong and delicious. The staff is consistently knowledgeable, friendly, welcoming, and professional. And any night that I end up here is consistently a very good night. It's not a cheap place, but I think it's worth checking out if you have never been there before. The first time I went there, I believe I got the Rumor Mill. I was going for something strong, a little bubbly, a little citrus-y for after dinner and it hit the spot. Super strong thanks to the absinthe. I enjoyed it. It was the only drink I got during my first visit and honestly, it was all I needed. The second I went, I got the secret weapon, which did not taste strong at all, but I felt it later. It's not overly fruity, but there are some sweet and sour notes to it. It tasted acidic and delicious! I originally wanted to get the Lost Cause, but they were all sold out of that one. I can't say I remember what my friend got, but he enjoyed his drink as well. We ended the night by splitting the Zombie Punch which is very very strong and comes in a little pirate man cup. Having had a couple rounds before going to Death & Co. that night, I was done after that in terms of drinks. For food, we did order the fries and they were amazing. I don't know if it was because I was highly intoxicated at that point or if they were actually good, but I do remember noting that they were the crispiest fries I had ever had. They also smelled like heaven. If you like sophisticated drinks and care about atmosphere, definitely go here. It's perfect for a date. You feel very classy. If you're not on a date, that's totally fine too. It's lots of fun to come here and every single time I've been here and sat at a table, I've always started up conversations with the tables next to us (it's very tight seating so it lends itself nicely to conversing with your neighbors). Very fun, very dark, a place that I recommend to friends when they're looking for a cool place to check out besides Please Don't Tell.",3,,1

Dim, intimate lighting. Cozy booths to the side for groups. My friend and I sat at the bar. Not ideal, but we definitely got a lot of one-on-one attention from the bartender. All the drinks are well crafted and unique. $15 for a cocktail, which is what I'd expect for an upscale cocktail lounge in NYC.

It was cold out and there was a crowd walking in at the time so we entered this public place of business to find the doorman to ask our question. As we did, he came out, brought us back outside and was extremely nasty about us walking through the door and when we tried to kindly explain that we just wanted to check in on our wait time,  he told us that we ""knew deep down that it was wrong"". Frankly, he was a complete asshole to us. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt in that he thought we were trying to pull something and explained we really just wanted to check in on our time and he continued to be a complete asshole.

87,Amy L.,"Brooklyn, NY",260,109,303,3.0,7/8/2017,"Location: This hidden bar is not as hidden as some I have seen or read about. I love the big wooden front doors!Environment/Service: We came around 1030pm at night and the hostess standing at the door told us for a party of 6 we have about a three hour wait and she is not even sure we would be seated. When she told us it was going to be a three hour wait or longer, we didn't bother to stand there and wait till a spot opened up. One of my friends really wanted to try this place out, so he gave his number and she will text us once our seats are available. We left and lucky we were still in the area, because the hostess texted us back within 30min. I subtracted a star because why tell us 3 hours and tell us we might not even get seated tonight because 30min to 3 hours is a huge difference of time. Whatever, we still decided to come back and try. Very dimmed inside and definitely not your usual lounges that are packed and filled with people. Too dimmed to the point where you have trouble reading the menu. I like that you are guaranteed a seat instead of standing in a crowded area. It's not crowded and over packed due to the wait list of getting inside. Bartenders are very attractive and they are very knowledgeable of their menu and have great recommendation for their drinks. Once they serve your drinks, they didn't really come back and asked if we wanted more, even though they took our finished drinks for sure. More on the upscale side for sure!Drinks: Since this hidden bar is known for their personalized cocktails, there was many cocktails to choose from. Their wine and beer menu was small, but understandable since it is mainly a cocktail bar. Definitely have unique cocktails on the menu, as well as the presentation of their drinks (which is creative and unique as well). Their drinks are packed with liquor and are very strong. If you are a person with an interest in light alcohol, better tell them to lessen the alcohol!Not really my type of environment, but worth the experience. Will I come back? Don't think so.",,,
88,Melissa L.,"Silver Spring, MD",6,82,13,5.0,6/14/2018,"This place has become destination. This is one of those places you don't mind waiting to get into. Beautiful cement engraving and beautiful doors on the outside while a host/hostess awaits outside and checks everyone's ID. Once the doors open, it is dark and candle lit. Tables alongside the left side of the room and a few to your right. I always prefer to sit at the bar. The bar is hightops stools, obviously. The back wall is just a huge selection of spirits. Some of them I have never heard of before. This is not one of the places you get a regular gin and tonic and call it a day. This place you come for the cocktails. Separated by spirit, each drink has its own flavor profile. There are some tiki drinks, hard drinks, more balanced drinks. I always go for one hard drink and another balanced one. Death and Company, I also have their book. Beautiful velvet cover with so many recipes inside. I always love coming here. I feel taken back to another time because it's so dark.

But a take your time, fresh ingredients and creativity cocktail. Death and Co is one of those hidden bars in NYC you'd walk by and never know was there. Behind this black door lies a speakeasy looking bar that does what it sets out to do; provide excellent drinks in a cool and loungy atmosphere.The door policy is similar to other hidden speakeasy type places in NYC in that you leave them your phone number and they'll text you when your table is ready. There's no standing inside, so everyone is at their respective seats being served drinks and small bites. As mentioned, the drinks are excellent. I had three different cocktails, all with their own personality. The bartenders put time and effort into the drink, and it shows.

We came around 9 PM on a Thursday night and had to wait about half an hour. The entrance and the wait perhaps hyped us up a little too much. The inside is very dark and tables are quite close together. It was difficult to read the menu with just the one tea candle on the table. I decided on the Hawaii Five-O for myself and my friend ordered a drink with tequila and watermelon. My drink was decent, but my friend did not enjoy his drink. We've both had better cocktails elsewhere. Additionally, we asked a couple times to be moved to the bar and were told we had to wait for an opening, despite there being several seats available. Towards the end of the night, we were finally able to move to the bar, which was slightly brighter and more enjoyable since we got to see the bartenders making the drinks.

I'm sure it can be tough dealing with impatient people but he was in good spirits and fun to talk to. He had dice tattoos on his hands and my friend and I forever know him as Dice Man. The interior is chic and dimly lit. The drinks are expensive. I've never had bubblier champagne than the one here. My friend had a glass of whiskey and she said it was great.

We gave our name and number to the lady by the door and she entered it in her iPad, saying it would be about an hour's wait. We went to grab a bite to eat, and about an hour later, we got the text that our table was ready. Once we got there, the place was quite full. It was really loud! Not from music but from the conversation level of the other patrons there. Not the most intimate place to grab a drink for sure. One major gripe we had was that the air conditioning just was not working. It was one of the hottest days of the summer, and it was stuffy, hot and really unpleasant inside. We asked the server if they could turn up the a/c and she seemed a little annoyed that we'd ask, saying it was already at its maximum. Then we asked if we could be moved somewhere else, and we got a curt 'no'. They have an extensive cocktail list divided up by alcohol type, and a lot of care seems to go into making the drinks. We got the Sundance kid that came in a ceramic coconut, and the Busy earning, which was their take on a Manhattan. The drinks were balanced and well made, but unfortunately we couldn't enjoy them as much given that we were sweating buckets. I think the ice melted too fast too in the heat. Couples to our left and right were leaving after one drink, probably because of the temperature.I'm sure the drinks are good here, but the space really should be managed better.

We had the beef sliders which were ok and the popcorn which I wouldn't order again but hey, this is NOT an eating establishment so ignore that! We came for the cocktails and were blown away by each one. Luckily, my wife and I have very similar tastes so we enjoy getting different drinks and tasting each others'. There wasn't one we didn't love. I also like it when I can tell a bartender what I normally enjoy, give him other insights to my palette preferences, which he then uses to craft something unique. That's what happened here and I knew I was somewhere special because the mixologists here have it going on! Looking forward to coming back here next time.",1,1,1

My friend and I went on a Saturday night and it was packed. You basically stand and wait outside the door until the host comes out with a list. Put your name on the list and they'll text you when your table is ready. It's very dark and quite loud inside but a fun experience nonetheless. We waited at a bar down the street (Huertas) which I would highly recommend doing if you have to wait as well.",,,
101,Michelle V.,"Orange County, CA",442,255,619,4.0,5/8/2017,"It's a hard to find lounge/speakeasy off of 6th st where they doors are wooden and can be kind of dark. There's generally a line outside usually especially on the weekends- wait times can be 2-3 hours at peak. I went on a Sunday at 9pm and got in with a 20 min wait. Can be touristy because it's been in so many publications so I'd suggest weekdays and Sunday nights. Drinks are good. Service is slightly slower than i'd like for a fancy bar but over experience a 4/5 because of that. If drinks were cheaper and wait wasn't so bad, I'd give it a 5/5. For this type of wait, I wouldn't attempt to go back, I enjoyed PDT and Angel Share way more than this place. I'd definitely go back if there wasn't a wait and I wanted to kill time, it's still a nice atmosphere.",,,

103,Mendy Y.,"Austin, TX",547,534,421,3.0,5/8/2016,"3.5 stars. I was excited to finally try this speakeasy but it's perhaps one of the most ordinary of its kind. There is a doorman/bouncer/greeter standing just outside what looks like very plain wooden doors. He takes your name and number and texts you when there's room. We went pretty early on a Saturday (around 7 pm) with 4 and got in after about 20-30 minutes. Once you walk in, you see a curtain and then nothing more than an extremely dark bar. It is intimate and I do like the vibe, but the drinks were not at all impressive. The menu is very large and organized by types of alcohol. I tried the gin-based Jasmine and it tasted like a fruity cross between a gin and tonic and cranberry vodka. When I pay $15 for cocktails at a speakeasy I expect the drink to be very complex and delicious, but I felt like Death and Co's really missed the mark. Service was good and I appreciated that we didn't have to wait a long time, but don't really think I'll be making a regular habit of visiting.",3,1,
104,Sally L.,"San Francisco, CA",478,389,1123,5.0,5/4/2016,"One of my favorite speakeasies in the city because the cocktails are always ON POINT and rarely disappoint (I've been here 3 times). Pretty extensive menu with a bunch of non-recognizable ingredients, but bartenders/servers are happy to go through them with you. Yes, there's usually a wait (unless you're super lucky), but it's conveniently located next to 100 other amazing bars in East Village. So it's really not a bad deal to pass time at one of those places until you receive your text message from Death.FYI, choose ""shaken"" for less alcohol flavor (the drink will be more infused with whatever other ingredients there are), or ""stirred"" for more alcohol flavor. All my ""shaken"" drinks were lovely.Perfect for small groups and noise level is just right.",2,,2

Around 11 on the weekend, we had to wait about an hour before we got the call. The menu is pleasantly extensive, with many creative and unique selections. For $16 a pop, they are not the place for a frequent visit, but our drinks were good. The $7 side of spiced nuts is also a bit pricey for what you get but still delicious and a good pairing for the drinks. As far as bars go, I prefer a place without table service, but like I said, if you need to impress a date, this is a good spot.",1,,1

108,Nick C.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",366,1032,1857,3.0,3/1/2016,"Death & Co. is one of those cool ""secret"" cocktail bars that charge a good amount of money for an interesting drink. It's not so secret since the door isn't hidden or anything. It's hiding in plain sight right on 6th st. I still almost managed to walk right by it, but the guy at the door could tell we were looking for the place and invited us in.I love the ambiance inside. It's small, dark, and intimate, with cool chandeliers and modern comfortable furniture. But they were playing music, and it didn't really fit the atmosphere. They actually serve food here too, but I was here just for some after dinner drinks. The drinks are sorted by the liquor used in them. I opted for my waitress's suggestion, the Sundance Kid. It was served in a coconut mug, which reminded me of Otto's Shrunken Head, a tiki bar (and my favorite bar) a few blocks away. The Sundance Kid was refreshing, with a good amount of jalapeno flavor.Honestly, the drink wasn't that good, especially at $15. A drink from Otto's is cheaper and tastier. Come to Death & Co. for the ambiance, and if you're looking to have a conversation.",6,3,3

There is a very detailed menu, but you are better off having your server craft a delicious cocktail for you!

111,Irina S.,"Manhattan, NY",15,9,0,4.0,4/18/2018,"Finally got a chance to try this place last night and it was excellent. There was a minor wait of about 30 minutes but they texted us when we were up. The atmosphere is excellent with the dark mood lighting and cozy small feel. The drink list was extensive to satisfy almost any palette; they even have a luxury cocktail list for people looking for a fancier/more expensive liquor. The wait staff was super friendly, inviting, and communicative.  Even the food we got to try i.e. the French Fries and Pretzel, was good. I would highly recommend checking out this place if you are looking for a cozy speakeasy and/or some yummy drinks. My only comment for slight improvement is the music list. I didn't feel the music played matched the atmosphere or vibe of the place; would have definitely made it even more enjoyable!",,,

113,Christos M.,"Flushing, NY",4,40,5,4.0,8/6/2017,"Get here early to put your name on the list. You don't want to be stuck after dinner at 9-10pm trying to roll up here to get a seat. I'm 1/2 on getting in here and have been told there's 20+ parties ahead of us. The door guy will make sure you are taken care of if you come early. Summer Menu:They have everything you can dream of for drinks. I would recommend to order off the menu and have the bartenders make you up something special. Otherwise we got the Zouzou and the Outlaw Country. Both drinks are from the Transformation portion of their menu. This part of the menu relies on the different ingredients being manipulated to give distinct flavors in a drink. IMO this is where a good bartender shows off their skills. The Zouzou was fresh and very refreshing. The cognac brings some balance and sweetness which is amplified by the lemon in the drink. Outlaw Country is their take on an old fashion. They add vanilla and two types of rum to the mix to bring out a different sweetness to the drink. We also ordered candied nuts which I could live without next time. They have their atmosphere nailed down. Quiet enough to carry on a conversation and enough background music that you aren't in silence. Very cozy where your date will lean into you. The door man keeps the place full but you aren't tripping over anyone. Bottom line: Take an old friend or a second or third date to get to know them better here. Good for a group of 6, nothing more. The bartenders will take your tastebuds on a trip you won't forget.",1,,
114,Frank W.,"New York, NY",217,104,69,3.0,12/7/2016,"Often considered an elite speak-easy within Manhattan, I had long been a fan of the trendy and dimly lit watering hole. But after my first visit back in a little over a year I was rather disappointed in the change of pace. The menu has been reorganized to reflect a historical timeline of the evolution of mixology. The new menu comes across as a simple marketing stunt/ploy and an attempt by Death & Co to be ""cute."" I much preferred the older menu which was organized by spirit. Plus the older menu also had the provocative quotes which were much more entertaining than the evolution of mixology.I ultimately ordered the ""Night in Tunisia"" which was fairly delicious (although it was served with a flower which seemed to immediately classify the drink as girly). The cocktail itself tasted a little bit like something you would get on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. Not to mention all the drinks are $16 and up, which is slightly more expensive than the last time I was there but this is expected given drink prices for elite speak-easys everywhere have been on the rise.",3,,

Hype wasn't worth it and we had three bars in that area serving very good cocktails so I will pass next time.",2,,
116,Sarah M.,"Federal Way, WA",102,1,1,2.0,2/8/2018,"I was super excited to visit this place. We had a game plan to show up early in case it got busy but ended up being the only two people there up until open. As soon at they opened, a bouncer came out and said hello to us. He then turned to an older couple walking up to him and said ""two for dinner?"" We'd been waiting an hour for the place to open and got seated after this couple. Whatever, a little annoying but no big deal. So we decided to sit at the bar- mind you, were 23 and 24- but get seated in the far corner even though we were only the second party to be seated. The bartenders were kind but obviously more attentive to the older couple. As the evening continues, I notice they're only seating older couples in the front of the bar and the younger people are being pushed to the side of the bar. It was so irritating! I spent so much time being excited to visit this place and was literally treated a million times better at the McDonald's next door (we only had bar snacks at Death- they didn't have a dinner menu?). If you're an older couple, this is the place for you. They must assume you have more money than me, so none of your needs will be unmet at the wonderful Death & Company.",,1,

Unfortunately we were told that they had just seated everyone and that we would have to wait around 45 minutes. Fortunately, they took our name and number and texted us when the table was ready. While we waited we went to The Eddy which is right near by (The Eddy was good, not a speakeasy though). Once they texted us we had 10 minutes to get there. Fortunately we made it! We ordered the Blood & Thunder and then an off menu drink that Yelpers recommend. The drinks were on the stronger side and were presented perfectly - in huge glasses packed with ice. They sort of resembled alcoholic snow cones. All of the drinks around us looked colorful and fun too! The atmosphere reminded me of a club vibe but because there is a limit on seating, it did not feel overcrowded and uncomfortable. Definitely come here early to avoid a wait! Good drinks and an upbeat atmosphere satisfied my expectations! 4 stars because of the wait. To me it isn't as much as a speakeasy as it is a bar that doesn't have windows. There is someone waiting outside to greet people so it did not feel that secretive.",1,,

I ordered the Sierra Norte, a mezcal based cocktail and loved it! Super tasty and loved watching it being made. My boyfriend on the other hand was indecisive and asked our bartender for recommendations of something smokey but fruity. The bartender (who's name slips my mind) created an off-menu drink called the Naked and Famous, a different mezcal based cocktail with yellow chartreuse,  from their old menu. My boyfriend loved it! Overall, great cocktail bar and happy I finally got to try it out. Can't wait to come back and try more drinks. FYI, when we left an hour later, there were already people lined up outside to get in. The bar definitely filled up throughout the hour.",,,

122,Michelle Y.,"La Canada Flintridge, CA",148,52,109,4.0,1/5/2017,Another well attended speakeasy in this side of town. Death & Co is marked simply by a solid wood door with a bouncer outside and a flooring (mat?) with its name. Reservations are required. Drinks: cost is standard for nyc. Drinks were nothing fancy. Plenty of spirits to choose from and bartenders will whip up something off menu if you ask them. I asked for an off menu mezcal mixed drink and was satisfied.

126,Lauren M.,"Manhattan, NY",58,56,0,5.0,1/12/2017,"FAVORITE BAR IN ALL OF NEW YORK.Ok, let me start by saying, I am not a heavy drinker. I can barely handle a glass of wine before I'm tipping over. I don't frequent many bars, in fact, I like to avoid them altogether.However, a date brought me here and I was immediately charmed by this place. The decor is spectacular. And you can't beat the ambiance. It is dimly lit and mostly dark, but it only adds to the charm.There's no windows at all. You have to approach the bouncer and he will let you in or put your name on the list. The wait for this place is crazy on the weekends, but it is always, always worth it. Plus, they can text you when your table is available, so you can go hang out somewhere else in the meantime. The menu is beautifully made, I mean, I felt like the cover was made of leather. The pages are thick and even the font used just matches the theme of this place. When I step inside, I feel like I'm in a 1920s era speakeasy. People are having conversations, but the overall volume isn't too loud or too low, just right.The servers and bartenders are also 100% friendly and are open to suggesting drinks for you, based on your tastes. Every drink I've had here has been excellent and usually recommended to me. The drinks are also a bit strong, but then again I am an extreme lightweight. The light snacks they have are great as well. 'Everything' flavored popcorn goes well with any drink you have and you can eat the whole bowl without feeling guilty. I've also had the chocolate cake, which is a perfect finish to the night.This is a place you go to unwind, relax and enjoy yourself. It is also a nice, romantic spot for a date. If you want a loud, screaming bar with cheap shots and underage drinkers throwing up on the ground - do not come here. While my date that first night I came here didn't work out, I do have to thank him for showing me one of my favorite places in the entire city, Death & Co.",,1,

After waiting maybe about 2hrs to get in, the anticipation was super high. Their cocktail booklet was huge; something like a drink bible. I love how well arranged their drinks were. It was categorized by the type of liquor which is helpful. I had a rum cocktail from their rum section which was poured into this pirate mug and swirled by a cinnamon stick! It was tasty with a hint of sweetness. It was like a rum punch but not too overwhelming. For $15 it was totally worth it. Service is great too! they're quick on refills with water and their errands. I suggest coming super early around opening to get a seat. If not, I'm sure they take down reservations!",3,,
128,Deegle D.,"Somerset, NJ",16,5,0,3.0,4/6/2018,"This place can run hot or cold.  I have experienced both (multiple times) and it always depended on the doorman.  Get a nice one and you may pass through the doors.  Once you are in, you are golden and the drinks are fun and exciting.  Its so damn dark and I love it.  Get someone who has had a bad day or just doesn't like the way you present yourself and you don't have a chance in hell of getting in.  That's the way it works there though so if you realize this beforehand you might not be so pissed when they stop looking at you and pretend that you aren't there.",,,

Updated review","Can't beat the drinks here. It's just impossible to get in without a reservation. On a Fri/Sat night, be sure to have a back-up plan. THE WAIT:We put our name down for five people around 9:45pm on a Saturday. They told us for a 5-10 top, there were a couple groups ahead of us, and it would be about 1.5 hours. We didn't get a text until 12:20am! We still showed up of course.MUST-HAVES: Busy Earning (for the whiskey lovers), Paper Tiger (for the spicy lovers).RUM* In the Name of the Queen (summer royal tea infused plantation rum, masoned kirsch, pineapple, lime) - 4 starsLighter, tropical-tasting drink. Described accurately by the server, who said the tea would have tropical hints. A bit sweet for what I was in the mood for at the moment, but my friend liked this.WHISKEY* Busy Earning - 5 starsWell-loved at the table. So much so that a girl sent back her drink and got this one instead. My boyfriend's a big lover of whiskey and he really liked this; while I'm not usually a fan of whiskey drinks, this one was really well balanced and that smokey flavor was great! GIN* Paper Tiger (Perry's Tea, Lustau 'papirusa' Manzanilla Sherry, Serrano Chili, Grapefruit, Lime) - 4.5 starsI love spicy drinks and this was great! The salt on the rim was an added bonus, a dashing of sea salt that was light but effective. This really hits you with the spiciness, so if you don't usually like that in a drink this may not be for you.-- My boyfriend loved this spot so much that we came again that same week! There was a 30 minute wait on a Tuesday night at 9pm. He ordered his Busy Earning again, and I got...SHAKEN* Sundance Kid (del maguey vida mezcal, calle 23 blanco, st george green chili, jalapeno, coco lopez, vanilla, lime) - 4 starsMore tropical than I'd thought (served a coconut cup!), but still refreshing. Quite spicy, but it's also quite masked by the sweeter hints. They pile ice over the brim, so you can't take your time too much or your drink will get watered down.",2,,
130,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",547,270,1485,4.0,11/23/2015,"We came here for my birthday on a Tuesday for a party of 5. We had dinner in East Village and wanted to check out a Speak Easy for drinks. We stopped by Death & Co around 9pm and the bouncer said it was an hour wait. It's clearly harder to get in with a larger group. He took down our names and said they would call when our table was ready.  We heard stories about bouncers being at the door but our door host was friendly. Although, the bouncer did laugh at us when we called Death & Co a speakeasy, because he said any place with the restaurant name on the door is not a speak easy. Good point. We looked at the door and it clearly said ""Death & Co"". Opps, our mistake!We went to a bar around the corner to wait until our table was ready. They actually called us within 30 minutes. I assume a lot of people put their names down and end up leaving to go elsewhere in East Village because they don't want to wait. Their loss!The place was dimly lit and very intimate. There is very limited seating, but we got seated in one of those sofa booths which was very comfortable. Death & Co has a very comprehensive cocktail menu - we each order different kinds of drinks - Gin, Bourbon, Tequila, or Vodka based cocktails and everything was delicious.  The drinks are strong and well presented, priced around $16, so I would say you get your money's worth.",1,1,2

I loved it.  I'd probably go and order it again if I come back to Death & Co.  So, so good.I was tempted to order a third drink but decided not to since I had many other places to go that night since I was visiting from out of town lol.  But I'd love to go back to Death and Co.  it's a classic bar that makes fine cocktails.  It's easily in the top 5 bars I've been to and probably makes the top 3.",1,1,1

I ordered the outlaw country, a play on the old fashioned - it was very good and I usually drink my whiskey neat. My partner had the Hawaii 5-O, a sweet yet complex gin drink. All and all I really enjoyed my time here. I can't not mention the ambiance, it was exquisite. It was so dark so pictures won't do it justice, you'll just have to come check it out for yourself!",,,
139,Nicole R.,"Union City, NJ",220,140,357,5.0,7/29/2016,"Death & Co is hands down the best cocktail lounge I have ever been to in NYC.  This place has every ingredient needed for a great time out.  From the outside it looks a bit intimidating because of its all black decor which gives off this suspense as to what is in store.  When you walk in you are greeted by dim lighting, chandeliers, seats at the bar, and some tables set up on the side.  My friend and I came here on a Friday evening around 7 and were lucky enough to have the last two seats at the bar.The drinks were oh so good and oh so strong!  What I loved best about their setup and service was the cocktail menu itself.  The drinks are organized according to their liquor family.  If you are in the mood for whiskey they have a page dedicated to those types of drinks.  In the mood for gin you turn to that page, and so forth.  The cocktails are $15 which is a steal for getting drinks in this area and worth every penny.The mixologists take their time with each drink they make and it is entertaining to watch them go to work on them.  Each drink that comes their way is perfectly crafted and you can tell they  take pride in creating these speciality cocktails.  My first drink was called ""Tramps Like Us"" and the second one was called ""Whole Lotta Love.""  These cocktails were amazing!  Pretty to look at and satisfying to drink.If there was ever a place to repeat time and again it's definitely Death & Co.  As a wise man once said, ""There can't be good living without good drinking."" - Ben Franklin",4,2,4
140,David M.,"FLUSHING, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/7/2017,"I'm leaving this review not to rate their drinks but for the guy outside with the iPad taking names and phone numbers for the wait list.He was irritated and annoyed that everyone was asking how long the wait would be or if he could check how many people were in front of them. Of course, he tried his best not to show it but when I asked him where I was in line after waiting an hour he snapped and put me on the spot. Told me with the worst attitude that instead of watching him I should go somewhere else to wait and that he'll check but that this would be the last time (I never asked before). I told him to forget it and left immediately.Look I get it, customer service is difficult and sometimes you just have a really bad day. But to use a potential customer as an example for the rest of the people waiting outside to stop asking you how long the wait would be? Now that's just disrespectful and messed up. Not only did it feel horrible to be treated like that in front of everyone there but that really ruined the rest of my night. Find a better system, instead of telling people when they first get there that it's hard for you to give an estimate with a nasty attitude simply state from the beginning it would be better off if they wait elsewhere. Because if you don't do that then the only way I can gauge how long I would have to wait is to stand there for a while and see how many people leave within that timeframe like everyone else standing there. What do you expect from people who never been there before? For people who are reading this, it was a Saturday night at 9:20pm. I was 20th in line when I was put down on the wait list. I asked the guy at around 10:15pm if he could check my place in line so I can decide to go somewhere else or not. Did not expect such a nasty attitude and I did not bother arguing. Never going here again.",3,,
141,Millie S.,"Manhattan, NY",369,230,306,4.0,8/15/2016,"This is the kind of place you take that one foodie friend who knows all the cool spots to grab a drink/bite - except they've probably already been here because they're the cool foodie friend and all. Stopped by around midnight on Saturday and we walked right in - no line for once! It's very easy to miss the entrance though, so watch out for someone wearing black and hanging in the shadows with a dimmed tablet (shouldn't be too hard to spot...right?). As others have noted, the staff here is really accommodating and always seem to have friendly smiles on. I forget all the drinks we ordered but some of the standouts were: Coffee and Starfish (my first one and favorite - loved the subtle coffee and vanilla), Minaseno, Birds of Prey, and Magnificent Seven. Perusing the drinks menu and reading the ingredients for each mix is half the fun - I loved all the inventive combinations!The kitchen was closing up when we started getting hungry, but we did get several bowls of the popcorn...totally good enough for us, because the seasoning on that popcorn is amazing. I've heard the bites aren't bad either, so I'll be back to try some of those and more on the drinks menu.",2,1,2

Updated review","Like clockwork, I'm intent on popping into Death & Co with every visit to NYC. If my budget would allow it, I'd be here every single night. It's such a great experience and even after so many visits, they still surprise me with a great new drink or addition to their menu. On my most recent visit, I was treated to the same great mix of service and selection. So, I felt the need to update my review and let everyone know that they're still firing on all cylinders. I can't wait to stop by again real soon.",1,,
143,Kelly M.,"New York, NY",101,154,280,5.0,11/26/2016,"I'm so happy that I finally got to check out this iconic New York speakeasy. I've tried a few times before but all of those times the wait was 2 hours so it didn't work out. This time, we went on Thanksgiving eve when the east village was pretty dead so we only had to wait ~10 minutes - a true thanksgiving miracle indeed!If you do have patience and opt to wait the 2 hours (which you should) Amor y Amargo and mother of pearl are right next door and are two of my favorites. East village social can also be fun and is fairly close - really there are a bunch of awesome spots in the area so the wait can fly by.The menu is extensive and beautiful itself. I had a hard time picking but ultimately went with the yellow jacket - a perfect drink for all you spicy tequila loving people out there. My boyfriend went with Lovesick Blues - a drink featuring tequila and absinthe. Not something I would pick but certainly had a nice kick to it.Bartenders are friendly and really know their stuff. I know the couple next to us described what they liked and the bartenders made up some drinks that were a big hit so next time I'll have to try that. Great vibes, greats atmosphere and great drinks - definitely recommend you check it out even if there's a two hour wait.",,,1

146,Vanessa B.,"San Diego, CA",38,300,49,5.0,9/27/2016,"I need a west coast version of this bar stat! The interior is rich and simple all at the same time. I walked in and immediately called it sexy. The servers are knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. The cocktails are some of the finest you will find on this planet. The food is damn delicious. If I lived in NYC I would show up here every Friday or Saturday night and just tell them to take my money.I tried a drink off of their menu and it was great (memory is failing me as to what it was), but then I went to my favorite drink of the moment, the classic aviation, and they just killed it. As soon as I got home I opened up the recipe in their book and tried to replicate. I came close, and it's certainly better than a Food & Wine recipe I was using, but I'm no Death & Co. bartender, that's for sure.We also had the cheese curds, the fried cauliflower, and the meat and cheese boards. All of it was great, but the curds were particularly awesome. I know, you're thinking how can fried cheese not be good? But these were extra good.Be prepared to put your name on a waitlist, they'll text you when spots are open. Lots of good places to grab a drink nearby so don't be deterred by this. You have 10 minutes from when they text you to claim your spot.",1,,

148,Tiffany J.,"San Antonio, TX",306,99,14,4.0,9/1/2016,"Imagine coming to New York to feed your love of speakeasy style bars. You hear about this place and make a beeline after a great dinner. You get to the addy and see just a wooden door....Is anyone home? Is this the place?  Then a hostess comes out with a tablet and asks if we have a reservation.  Umm...no. So we place ourselves on a list and wait to be called.  At this point, this is the only negative I have about this place, the wait...(hence the 4 stars)We then went to a average bar around the corner for a beer until we were called.  Then we got the buzz.  We were the lead inside and I felt like we were walking through the the wardrobe from the lion, witch and the wardrobe.  We were led to a lovely dark speakeasy bar with only strategically placed lamps to illuminate the bar and tables. It was great! It was ethereal.  Just enough to light to see but dark enough for some alone time with your boo or person of the night...:)We had Ole fashioned with American whiskey (can't remember the name, they were just that good). Bartenders were friendly and made GREAT drinks.  I was thoroughly impressed especially with the atmosphere. It felts like you were in your own bubble of light and surrounded by darkness.

154,Greg T.,"West Orange, NJ",271,1298,73,5.0,6/1/2016,"One of the best bars in the United States, let alone Manhattan.As I had been here previously with friends the wife wanted to visit. Being the Memorial Day weekend we thought the wait would not be too bad. We were first on line for the 6PM opening (it filled it up fast behind us) and were promptly seated at the bar in the corner as requested. The décor is old school with dark paneling, dim lighting and plenty of glass and crystal fixtures. The staff is smartly dressed with the bartenders in vests, button downs and ties and the women in cocktail dresses. Votive candles in highball glasses decorate the bar and rest of the seating area. We were courteously greeted by our bartender and given glasses of ice water and menus. I went with the Lord Baltimore as my first cocktail which is two types of Rye, Amaro, Pamplemousse and maple. It was spicy with a hint of citrus from the grapefruit-flavored Pamplemousse. The wife opted for the Hot Gossip which was Plymouth Gin, tonic, Pamplemousse, Doug Fir and Luxardo. She enjoyed this shaken gin drink so much she went with another gin drink as a follow up. We ordered the popcorn (free refill) and the fried cauliflower for snacks and they were both quite good. The second round consisted of the Tramps Like Us for the wife which was Dorthy Parker Gin, Framboise, Aquavit, Campari, raspberry, lemon and Crème de Cacao. She felt ths was the best cocktail she ever had. I opted for a stirred rum drink, the Touch of Evil, which was Appleton 8 year, Cynar,Fernet Branca, Luxardo and saline. A very complex and delicious drink which capped off our stay at this premiere cocktail mecca.A must visit if you can get in.",3,,2
155,Tiffany L.,"San Diego, CA",0,52,9,2.0,1/11/2018,"Always a long long long wait! The worst part is when they tell you a certain number... ie: you're number 30 in line and you ask them approximately how long that Is ... the door guy says "" you can't equate drinks to a time"" thanks buddy.

157,Stephanie H.,"Seattle, WA",246,7,3,4.0,12/28/2017,"Yes, you will probably wait. I think I came here on a Thursday with a party of four, and I think we waited less than an hour? Not too bad considering you can go to a bunch of other places within a couple blocks, especially when it's freezing in nyc during the winter and you don't want to be outside longer than you have to. The menu can be a little overwhelming but ultimately the drinks were delicious. They're using quality ingredients to make these cocktails. Service was not memorable but it's okay- it wasn't bad. Yes, cocktails are pricey, but what do you expect? It's a famous speakeasy. I think the $16 was worth it. Obviously I can't afford to have several drinks here (unfortunately), but I would definitely come back.",,,
158,Abbey M.,"New York, NY",20,116,16,5.0,3/16/2017,Came here on a Wednesday around 7pm for a date and had a couple drinks and appetizers. It's a really fun atmosphere and GREAT drinks!

159,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,5.0,3/30/2015,"Oh, Death & Co, I adore you. You want something more when it's unattainable, right? Well, on a Saturday night, Death & Co is just that. The wait is often up to two hours, but as I've said in other reviews about East Village establishments, there are plenty of other options to visit while you wait expectantly to walk beyond the dark, velvet curtain.So, as you have probably guessed, I last went here on a Saturday. I went with someone who was more of a beer drinker (whereas I'm a cocktail fanatic), so we compromised and went to a rare beer bar while we waited for a table here. We came back an hour and a half later, expecting to be seated, and the bouncer informed us that we still had to wait for a bit. 5-10 minutes of pitiful shivering later, we were in! And we had two seats wait for us to the left of the bar.This place is very classy, and VERY expensive. Don't come here if you're trying to save money. But in my opinion, this is one of the few speakeasies at which the drinks are worth the price. A lot of places like this jack up their prices because they can. Death & Co can too, but the quality of the drinks here is top-notch. I wish I could tell you every drink I've ordered here, but oftentimes I just tell the bartenders what I tend to like and let them do the rest. And I'm never left unsatisfied. Even when I do order off of the menu, I rarely remember the name. Really, though, the bartenders here can make anything. The first time I went here it was on the empty side, so my friend and I got a seat at the bar. We had the luxury of watching our bartender work his magic, and it was damn impressive. So methodical and calculated. So precise. So wow.I initially thought to give Death & Co four stars, but now I can't remember why. When I first became enchanted by the speakeasy culture (despite it all kind of being moot at this point....clearly everyone knows about these placeS), this was one of my first stops. I adore it. Wait aside, these cocktails are deity-status. Paired with dim lighting and a generally intimate atmosphere, Death & Co does everything right to create the ideal speakeasy experience.",10,,3
160,Emily J.,"San Francisco, CA",73,1,0,1.0,1/15/2018,I walked in the door on Saturday evening to see if there was space for two. The bouncer (doorman?) came barreling out of the hallway and physically shoved me back on to the street saying I needed to step back right away. I asked politely if there was space that evening and he could not have been ruder or more disdainful in his tone to me and my friend. I put my name on a waitlist and never heard back. Fortunately there are other East Village bars with good drinks and professional staff.,,,
161,Sophie P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,20,2,2.0,12/27/2017,"First off the doorman was great, it was a cold night but he was still friendly and professional. I've never had a problem with rudeness from the door staff, and they're always pretty accurate about how long they think you'll be waiting. He also handled a diva fit from another would-be customer with grace and good humor, he's a credit. And in fairness, we've always gone in groups so have never sat at the bar, maybe if we did we would be spared the thing that really spoiled this place the last few times we've visited--the bad table service.If customers ask for a specific old-menu drink to start, it's because they think it's one of the best cocktails they've ever had the delight of trying, Death & Co has always been THE best place to get it, and they enjoy the tradition--it's a compliment to the recipe, not a slight on the new menu, which they fully intend to sample afterwards. Try not to sneer ""Don't you want to try something new?"" at them, it sets an unwelcoming tone. Also less than ideal to say a drink we've had before at this very bar does not exist, it does. The issue is you and/or your barstaff don't know the spec--that's fine, but that's not our failing and you didn't need to be so rude about it. Again, the attitude detracts from the enjoyment. If 4 people are at a table, try to get an order from all of them before wandering off bored, you'll know you have all of the orders when the number of drinks equals the number of patrons, it's pretty simple really. Then when you bring the other drinks for the rest of the party and realize your mistake, it's unrealistic to expect the customer has pre-memorized the menu and knows what they want. They'd maybe be inclined to order off-menu in the interest of speed, but can't be bothered with the withering treatment from you on what was a fun evening, so give them a menu. Then maybe try to check back with them relatively quickly so they can actually enjoy a drink along with the rest of their party. Try not to make every interaction awkward and rude--sneers and smug, sarcastic smiles don't go with good service and customer experiences. Of the two ladies on table service last night, one was pleasant and professional, and one was not--I'm sure management could easily work out who's who. The drinks were ok, some of them were actually great, but overall it's not worth the hassle. There are plenty of other places that are easier to access and who can make fantastic drinks served with a smile. We have always brought people here, and recommended it, we won't anymore.",,,
162,Hollina U.,"Chicago, IL",233,325,1,2.0,5/27/2016,"I think all the positive reviews and my friend's recommendation made me really hyped up for this place, but then being sat facing a wall set it up so that I wouldn't love this place. My friend and I arrived just a few minutes after they opened, but the two people in front of us were the last people to get a table, so we were told that we could be added to the wait list and they would text us when a table was vacant. The place they recommended was a sister restaurant/bar around the corner, Cienfugos, which we actually really liked--- more than Death & Co. Sitting right up against the wall is alright, but the cocktails here didn't blow me away, so I couldn't justify sitting against a wall for average drinks. I had gin-based drinks, which is my usual liquor.",2,,
163,Igor P.,"North Miami Beach, FL",4,62,15,3.0,9/13/2017,"I think I'm just not a mature enough drinker to appreciate this place. Everybody in our party of 6 had 2 cocktails while I only sipped on 1 (The Spyglass), mainly because after trying mine and sampling everyone else's I simply did not care for the taste of any of the drinks. My friend was right in saying that you have to appreciate the taste of liquor to enjoy these cocktails. The alcohol is very prominent, which was a turnoff for me as I am someone who drinks for the effect and not the taste. The only food item we had was the cheese platter. It was alright with the exception of one of the cheeses which sent me on a trip filled with sensory overload that I didn't think was possible to achieve without drugs. I am referring to the goat cheese which was strong in taste, but not in a way I enjoyed. When I bit into it the overpowering taste of an old man's carpet which had been covered in dog piss over a 40 year period hit me like a sack of bricks. It was quite strong and I sat still for a good ten seconds saying ""oh my God"" while feeling like I had just taken a psychedelic that was rushing into my system. You know that part of That's So Raven where she gets a vision and the camera zooms into her eye while she freezes and sees something? Yea, that's exactly how I felt - like I was teleported to an old man's home and couldn't get out of a putrid room inside. It felt like my soul left my body to vomit and returned to tell me about the experience, which I regretted agreeing to listen to. Thank goodness for the honey that came with the cheese platter to help cover the aftertaste. Also, check out the bathroom in the basement - look for the stairs with candles on them and you'll be led to a door labeled ""Toilet"". It was so cozy in there and smelled amazing. My friend described it as a place where you would get sacrificed by witches and I'm all about that vibe. So overall, it's a neat place if you like mature drinks and a dimly lit atmosphere. Just be careful, as the darkness makes it somewhat hard to read the menu. I think this how our friend ended up accidentally ordering a $25 cocktail and then practically gagging when the bill came...whoops!",,3,1

169,Andrew H.,"WOODSIDE, NY",149,38,25,5.0,5/16/2016,"As someone who rather enjoys speakeasy's and cocktail lounges, I was rather pumped to finally try out Death and Co.  After trying to get into a different speakeasy a half hour before, my friend suggested we try this one. Since it was a Friday night and we didn't have a reservation, I wasn't sure how long a wait would be. The bouncer outside was extremely curious and tried his best to get us in as quickly as possible. He succeeded. We only waited about 10 minutes a little after 1 am. Once inside, the dark atmosphere and bustling room makes you feel like you're a fortunate person to gain access to this fine establishment. The menu was was really impressive and had I not indulged at other places before hand, I would've gotten more than just one cocktail. However, choosing one was a tall task. I ultimately went with the Slap Pickle. I wasn't disappointed. Pickle backs are my thing so I knew this would be up my ally. And dammit, it was delicious. Speaking of delicious, the free popcorn. Woa. Talk about some damn delicious munchies.After being very impressed by the experience, I will be back to try more of the cocktails. And eat more popcorn.

My friends and I go to nearby bar and wait. Two hours and 15 minutes later we start to wonder about our table or bar seating. Josh says 'You're Next' but then proceeds to let other parties in ahead of us as we now wait outside. Eventually two of our friends leave (reasonable after now waiting 2 1/2 hours). We eventually get in and try to make the best of it in spite of Josh and his bad hosting skills.

We got the text that there was a table available around 30-35 minutes later and had 10 mins to return. Perfect! I had the Short Change Hero, which was so good. It's their take on a whiskey sour. The flavors were amazing! We also had the Lord Baltimore, which was very good as well (a little small but boozy, so it works). The interior is very dark and tables are close. It's worth the wait and being close to your neighbors. Looking forward to more nights here, as long as wait times are less than an hour!!!",1,,
174,Courtney D.,"Sammamish, WA",119,457,107,4.0,3/2/2016,"Arrived at this spot late on a Thursday night. There was a group in front of us and told us we were all just suppose to wait until someone came to the door. After about 5 minutes the door guy opened the door and let in the group in front of us and told us to keep waiting. After about another 5 minutes we were let in and grabbed a seat at the bar. The decor had a cool vibe and there looked to be a good amount of seats at the bar and tables around the exterior of the room. There was a bar book to order drinks on based on the base of liquor (page of drinks for whiskey, tequila, etc.). We had a couple drinks and all were really good!Definitely a good drink spot in the East Village!",2,1,1
175,Alyssa P.,"Bethlehem, PA",0,21,16,5.0,10/26/2016,"This was a perfect little spot for a date night. Our drinks were delicious, the atmosphere was intimate and the employees were all nice. The beef sliders were delicious and I liked the flavors on the fried chicken sliders. They don't take advance reservations, but the wait list moved quickly for us (I expect people put their names in and then went elsewhere.) The hostess who ran the waitlist was welcoming and helpful.",,,
176,Magda M.,"Rocky Hill, CT",37,4,0,1.0,11/22/2017,The worse cocktail bar ever.   The waiter was rude and belittle me when he asked me my opinion about my drink.  And he became aggressive towards me.  Never experienced anything like this in my life.  After waiting an hour to get a table this is not something you want to experience on Thanksgiving Eve.  Simply awful customer service,,,
177,Kozmo C.,"Atlanta, GA",209,390,0,5.0,2/7/2017,"Was able to simply stroll in on a Thursday late night and sit down right at the bar and have several drinks.  So for me it's surprisingly laid back.  Lives up to reputation as one of the best cocktail bars in the country, with a quite sizable selection marked by dazzling variety and sophistication.  Many a pioneering barkeeps have worked here.  Definitely a must-try for the intrepid lover of classic, modern, and cutting edge mixed drinks.  Like other bars of renown, look forward to scintillating conversations at the bar with fellow drinkers from all over the country, or industry dark horse and stars alike.  Fellowship of heady drinkers.",1,,
178,Mark A.,"Fremont, CA",12,46,0,1.0,8/20/2017,"Beware! They added $2 to my tip and thought I wouldn't catch it on my credit card statement. Had to dispute it but luckily I saved the receipt. We also put our names down so they can text us when the table was ready for 2. Once we received a text our table was ready we showed up with one extra friend and they said a table of 3 wasn't ready, but really felt the were just punishing us. So we waited for 15 minutes as 3 groups for a total of least 12 people came out and thanked the doorman for ""hooking them up"" (im assuming they didn't have to wait like the common people). And we just waited and waited as No one else was coming in since it was late. I sure hope the doorman making $15 an hour got those digits. Anyways, the book is really good and worth getting for sure as the experience of the actual place was disappointing.",1,,
179,Jae L.,"Dumont, NJ",161,183,121,3.0,2/3/2017,"I'd say this place is just okay. From the outside, it doesn't look like much. I guess they're kind of trying for that speakeasy feel, but only just kind of. And the bouncer(?) guy with the ipad outside, letting us know the wait times and stuff is interesting. He told us we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, so we headed to another bar down the street while we waited. Came back and we were able to be seated.Inside, DARK. I would say somewhat unnecessarily dark. Needed flashlights/phones to be able to look at the menu. Bartenders were nice, attentive, and explained the drinks well. Definitely pricey here, so don't expect to be drunk if you're on a budget. They do have a great selection though, lots of scotch.Overall, a good experience, but would prefer a cheaper, brighter alternative.",1,,
180,Tina T.,"Manhattan, NY",13,115,201,4.0,7/4/2016,"Upon entering here at 5pm on a summer's evening, it transitioned from light outside to dark as hell. Behind the towering wooden doors is a mysteriously super dark bar filled with all kinds of lively people. My party enjoyed a nice table/booth smack right in the middle of all of this, and struggled from here to read the menu. With the help of candlelight (and excellent service on behalf of the servers on explaining the menu), we ordered our choice drinks of the night (and of course they just had to be the biggest ones there.) Our ""to share"" drinks were a foreshadowing of the night to come...I'm trying to remember if we ordered all three of the sharing options: Porch Swing, Far Into the Night, and the Golden Fang. But I can only clearly remember having Golden Fang definitely, which was beautifully presented in a wine bottle. But the first of our choices, perhaps it was Far Into the Night, which was served in a scorpion bowl and lit in the middle. There's something about the lit Scorpion Bowl that seems to entice many, as people around us started to order the same thing after gawking at ours.The first option was very delicious, smooth, and did not taste as alcohol-ridden as it actually was. Coupled with a cheesy drinking game and it turned out to be quite dangerous. I enjoyed this first option the most, along with the excellent service. Wish it was just a tad bit brighter in here...but perhaps that would be taking away from the speak-easy feels of this place.",,,

The last thing I want to do is stand around outside for 45 minutes hoping to grab a table. I have dinner reservations, all I want to do is grab a quick cocktail and then jet out.I arrive at 6pm. Me and my crew are greeted by the doorman dressed all in black.Gentleman, welcome to Death. Do you have a reservation? Ah, no. Good sir, All I want is to drink a fab cocktail and be on my way. I have dinner plans, we won't be that long. Come on Baby, don't fear the reaper!Death booms out, let me see what she has for you...(Nails biting) Right this way.............Totally different vibe once inside. Its dark. It's elegant. There is Jazz music playing, not any old Jazz but cool Jazz that you play when you want to be cool.There are plenty of seats. Score one for Death!$15 cocktails are the average price, they have them broken into sections. Gin Cocktails, Rum Cocktails, Whiskey Cocktails, you get my drift. They have lotsa Cocktails!!I ordered this Cocktail Whiskey made with Japanese Whiskey, a very smokey mouth feel. It was insane! Sooo good, worth every nickel.My buds ordered some drink with a Mexican chili pepper, sounded good. Next time!If you wanna have a great time in this place, get here early and during weekdays.

182,Fazeela S.,"Brooklyn, NY",197,338,348,1.0,11/21/2015,"Perfect name for the winner of the WORST customer service and meanest staff that I have ever experienced in NYC.*** Remember these words. I WARNED YOU.The staff was composed of the most stereotypically wretched, rude individuals that I personally have encountered in NYC... (My spouse concurs, and um, he was born and raised here folks). The Drinks: Now the drinks were pretty good, not great. **Definitely** not at the level of Freeman's, Dear Irving, Dick & Jane's, etc...The Wait: It's first come first serve. I don't enjoy throwing shade on other women of color, but the hostess/bouncer was just horrid. Our party arrived and waited for about 45 min to an hour - while other groups who came after us were let in before us. But we dealt with that. Asking her questions was akin to approaching military personnel before they are about to drop a drone. She would roll her eyes or raise her voice and shout, ""Do NOT come near here"".... ""Maam, You Must LEAVE the hallway..."". She would see me enter to ask about the wait and would be on the other side of the speakeasy and would dart, no run over in a hot second to basically push me out. The Service: I can't. even. ONE server was knowledgeable about the drinks - and she was the only saving grace. But we had 3 people serving us. The other two were the same as the hostess... rolled their eyes, guffaws. And they were not even good at their jobs. Slow and not too much substance in that area above their neck. We asked them to put a specific amt of the bill on 2 cards and the rest in cash and the server came over and proclaimed, ""We can't do that, only 4 cards accepted"". So I spoke VERY slowly and said, we are only asking you to use 2. She came back and the cash was still in the folder? Not much up there...*** One part Regina George from Mean Girls, one part the female soldiers who engaged in torture at GITMO and Abu Ghraib.",5,8,
183,Jess T.,"Brooklyn, NY",180,191,0,4.0,8/11/2017,Love D&C. Great cocktails and vibe. But I have noticed that the door person always says a ridiculously long wait time and then texts me within 20mins. Is this part of the game to make this place seem more exclusive?!,,,1
184,Tiffany Z.,"Lodi, NJ",23,18,2,5.0,10/7/2017,"Death & Co. may not be as vintage as other bars deemed ""speakeasies"", but what it lacks in decor it gains in service. The bartenders were quick, talented, and intuitive. They basically knew what I wanted before I could even ask. I didn't have to ask or even wait for more water or a food menu. It also makes up for it in prices. The cocktails and food are the perfect balance of luxe at a price point a step lower than other downtown imbiberies.",,,
185,Ashley S.,"Chicago, IL",743,149,10,4.0,7/26/2017,"Really not super in love with expensive bars in general so overall it was like ok, not bad? The drinks here were pretty good and a perfect level of strong. I was kinda overwhelmed with all the choices and menu options. But I really have to applaud the bartenders because they really know what the hell they're doing. I straight up said ""I have no idea what I want but I know I like whiskey and something fruity."" And they said ""ok"" and they came back with some concoction of whiskey, lime and some strawberry? Anyways, it was really good and would come back when I'm able to land a better job. They're very willing to accommodate to your likes and dislikes and are able to create something amazing just on the spot. Really good vibe, even on a Monday night. Will return! :)",,1,
186,Helen C.,"Brooklyn, NY",88,438,1260,4.0,2/5/2016,"My mouse cursor was hovering over 3 and 4 stars for a good 10 seconds before I settled on the 4. The drinks are good, the noise level is bad. The employees are nice, the patrons are uncivil (excluding yours truly, of course). The guy next to me kept his arms on the bar, ramming his elbow into me constantly. Peacocking much? The woman near me complained about the seat where it's drafty. How about wearing your coat? Can't blame D&C for impolite customers though, I get it; just letting the public know that these jerks need to check their rudeness at the door before entering this cozy establishment and not ruin the evening for fine folks like you and I ;)The drinks are all delicious and well-balanced. If you want something spicy, get Paper Tiger. For those who love orange juice with a kick in the mouth, order Jasmine. Want to hold onto the island life but curse yourself for being in NYC? Try In the Name of the Queen. Not sure what to finish your night with? Give Grass Widow a shot. If all else fails, check your liver and order another round by pointing at a random page; I'm sure you'll like that too.",1,,

The menu offers interesting and aged liquor drinks. The hot mulled wine was intoxicating. The aged egg nog was sweet and yummy.   The sliders were detectable and very uncommon. The pork belly was yummy and moist. The cheese platter was delicious, the cheese was high quality, but a tease to be honest, would be nice to offer a larger portion to your customers than you'd feed a rat.  Overall really good.",,,
188,Denny S.,"Brooklyn, NY",216,355,1015,5.0,1/9/2016,"Usually when you go to speakeasy, at least in NYC, you have a rude doorman who will give you bunch of unnecessary grief. Not in this case, the gentleman at the door was very pleasant. He took us to inside and let us choose whether we want to sit at the bar of booth. the mixologists were very entertaining, friendly and most importantly carefully craft your drink. We started the first round ordering from the menu and they were really good. After that, we told the bartender what type of spirits and whether or not you like boozier or fruity drinks.The drinks keep coming and we probably have about 7 cocktails, and none of them were just okay, all of them were delicious and well crafted.My new fave spot to get drinks, good drinks!!",1,,1

190,Beatrice W.,"San Francisco, CA",143,517,81,4.0,6/25/2017,"A trip to NYC wouldn't be complete without a visit to the famed Death & Co.  I'm glad I went but honestly, I wouldn't say it's the best cocktail bar I've ever been to...  While their menu is beautiful, I had a hard time selecting a stirred spirit forward drink that really stood out as novel.  I went with a gin-based drink in the end, and while it was well made, I'm not sure the $16 price tag was justified when most other places charge $15/drink.  Moreover, it was so loud inside I couldn't imagine trying to have a conversation.  Now all that said, the service here is truly excellent.  The staff is friendly, you're immediately served water upon arrival, and the waitlist system works well.  If I lived in NY, I probably would be a regular at Amor y Amargo next door.  But I'd still also recommend Death & Co to anyone who asked because, well, I'm a cocktail nerd who has mad respect their reputation and influence in driving the cocktail revolution.",,,1

That usually means a random crowd - and usually there's a crowd.Speakeasies practically guarantee higher-than-normal prices, so that's par for the course. On the bright side, their drinks are strong, so even if you're feeling splurgy, you won't want to go beyond two cocktails.Decent service every time I've been.

195,Lori L.,"New York, NY",2242,603,6802,4.0,3/1/2014,"Ah, Death & Co. For some reason, I had believed it to be one of the most elusive speakeasies, with the slightly preposterous wait times and the undisclosed phone number needed to make a reservation. A few friends and I decided to try our luck here on an early Friday evening, hoping to beat the crowds that would ensue later in the day. A little after 6PM, the two of us found ourselves outside a wooden door marked ""Death & Co"" and waited to see if we could be seated inside.But, let's get the unpleasantries out of the way first. The bouncer was extremely unprofessional, and remained inflexible about our group situation. Not only did he almost refuse to seat us when one of our friends wasn't present yet, but later refused to give up an empty seat at the bar next to us because he was ""saving it for his buddies"". It may be unfair to dock off a star from Death & Co. for this, but it did make for a less-than-perfect experience.I do, however, give many points for the ambiance. Sexy, dark, and intimate, it's perfect for get-togethers with a few friends and dates. There's a few tables around the perimeter of the room for both pairs and larger parties, as well as 8 or so seats around the bar area. Once we took our seats at the bar, we started flipping through the drink menu. D&C has one of the most extensive that I've seen, and quite possibly the most tempting. The cocktails are sorted by spirits, ranging from gin, rum, whiskey, brandy... basically anything you can think of will be printed on their pages. I was also surprised to see the range of food options available as well, and while slightly overpriced, the selections looked extremely tasty.Throughout the night, we watched the mixologists assemble a variety of drinks; the amount of time and care that goes into each glass is truly admirable and can, at the very least, partially justify the price. The Gypsy Wedding I ordered was almost perfectly suited for my tastes. A Bombay Dry Gin base is accented by the additions of Krogstad Aquavit, grapefruit juice, lime juice, and honey. The rim of the glass is garnished with toasted fennel salt, the contrast highlighting the sweetness of each sip. Expertly crafted, composed of fresh ingredients, and with all components in just the right proportion, I was sorely tempted to order a second glass.Yes, I would return to Death&Co. While the hassle of securing a seat is rather irksome, the quality and caliber of the drinks available makes it worth it.",6,5,5
196,Lisa F.,"Denver, CO",115,323,323,4.0,1/18/2016,"We ended up at Death & Co. after a night of roaming around to this bar and that restaurant. It was kind of a magical night as it snowed for a little and in my mind, that sets the mood for a good time.We were seated fairly quick (a group of 5) but this was around 6 PM so we were early for the cool crowd. We had a great booth that fit us all well.We are new to NYC and I was a little leery of this place only because I've read it's very popular and sometimes with popularity comes complacency.The whole group ordered something different but I will speak to what myself and my husband ordered. The menu is great, as it is broken up in the type of liquor and the cocktails they offer (ie: gin, rum, tequila, whiskey), smart on their part!My husband ordered the Paper Tiger (gin) and there was a great kick to it with the serrano chili but not overpowering. It was spicy, but refreshing.I ordered the Nite Tripper (whiskey) and to be honest I am still living high on it this morning. It was probably one of the top cocktails I have ever had. It was almost indescribable and definitely worth trying...again and again and again!We did not eat anything while we were there but enjoyed our drinks and our water was replenished often which is good when you are doing cocktails at multiple places in this city.I would definitely recommend this place and go back. I would be aware of the wait though, when we left a group of two had a 1.5 hour wait.",,,
