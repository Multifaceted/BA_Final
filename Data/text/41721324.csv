0,Noa I.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",121,42,99,4.0,3/30/2017,"I usually like this location and never had any complaints. The baristas are all really nice and efficient but the reason why I wanted to make a review was because this time, although she was nice, the barista who took my order seemed distracted so made my iced order into hot and I had to wait a little bit which wasn't a big deal. But when I got my order, it was a little warm as if they had put in ice but everything was so hot all the ice immediately melted! I didn't want to wait again for my order to be fixed but it tastes or just feels funny having an iced drink with no ice and is lukewarm.But on the plus side, there's a lot of spacious seating and even some cushions by the window like it's a little nook!",,,
1,Danan R.,"New York, NY",886,1843,43,2.0,8/3/2018,"It's open until 11 pm which is a plus but the service here is not great.  The staff seem frustrated with life and annoyed with having to take orders.  It is a chain so yes, expectations have to be managed BUT even taking that into consideration, the eye rolls is not acceptable.  The drinks themselves are pretty standard and my frappuccinos are always up to expectations.  There are much better locations.",,,
2,Yayrin K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",14,4,0,1.0,10/30/2018,"I come here every other day. People who work here are rude, disrespectful. I told them my drink from mobile order is not ready for more than 10 minutes and they did not even apologize. And they suspected me twice as if i did something wrong. I will never go back here.",,,
3,Phoebe Z.,"New York, NY",208,50,78,2.0,8/16/2018,I ordered a grande strawberry açaí with light ice and the barista didn't read the order carefully and he put a bunch of ice into the shaker and when he was pouring the drink into my cup he then realized that I asked for light ice. He just poured the drink into my cup knowing that it was only 3/4 filled without all the ice. He didn't even bother adding more of the strawberry juice into the cup to fill it up. I had to say something to another barista telling him that the cup isn't even filled. Excuse my language but I paid for a full cup of drink and not for 3/4 cup of drink with a shitload of ice... the barista who took care of my order didn't even give a shit. Very unsatisfied with the service.,,,
4,Marlena K.,"Brooklyn, NY",186,505,1247,3.0,3/1/2018,"Efficient, and open late when compared to other Starbucks! Open till 11PM is always a plus. The inside is PACKED during the day and usually around 1-3pm there's no place to sit in side. When it's crowded staff moves slowly with IDGF mentality but for the most part my drinks are usually good and they keep the line moving.",1,,
5,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,3.0,9/28/2016,"Just dropped in here to pick up some iced coffee to get a caffeine rush while heading to the subway. Had to have a good buzz going on to shop at the Queens Center Mall.Pretty basic location. Normal menu of drinks and eats as in all of them. Free wifi. Efficient service. Bathroom. Kind of a narrow layout with some seating. Nice looking spot though. Already pushing that Pumpkin Spice!Bottom line, it's a Starbucks. The Borg of coffee houses. Resistance is futile.",3,3,2
6,Caroline E.,"Manhattan, NY",201,137,19,1.0,1/11/2018,"Worse than rock center. Waited 30 minutes for my mobile order this morning. After 15 minutes when myself and another girl asked about our orders the barista didn't seem to care at all. She looked at our orders on our phones and went back to making coffee.  When after 20 minutes of waiting, i asked if she was going make our coffees. She made the other girls and not mine. So after she made a few more and I asked if she was going to make mine and I was already late for work at this point. She finally made it after I asked several times and it was wrong to boot. Avoid this Starbucks.",,,
7,Monique M.,"Queens, NY",198,218,837,4.0,7/17/2016,"I stop here most days to pick up breakfast on my way to the 4,5,6 train. Most of the time the staff is quick and friendly but I've had some who aren't as nice. I hate the fact that every time I ask for a bakery item, the staff asks whether I want it heated to which I reply no. But when I receive it, it's piping hot. Stop heating my muffin!! I'm always in a rush so I can't make a complaint or grab another but it's quite annoying. Otherwise, it's a cool spot and I continue to visit daily.",,,
8,Freeyah-Knycky C.,"Brooklyn, NY",44,554,6917,3.0,11/2/2014,"The staff at this SB and most other SBs I've been to is usually very good to me. What occurred on this occasion was so SIC that I'm using this opportunity to correct said injustice. Okay okay I'm joking, it really wasn't that serious but I do think it's a story with a tip to share with fellow Customer Service Representatives. I in no way subscribe to ""the customer is always right"" arseness. Hell no! But I'm quick to apologize to a customer even when I'm far from wrong. To me once you're not disrespectful, I am able to keep on my professional coat. Each weekend of almost 9 months I've ordered a small coffee and a peppermint latte, a slice of banana bread and a croissant from this SB. On this particular morning it seemed to be even more crowded but I was finally able to place my order.I got my pike and  breads and waited for my latte. And waited. And waited then inquired about it. They kept asking customers about a ""chai tea chai tea"" but as I never ordered a chai in life I paid it no mind. The server realize that the cashier mistakenly cashed the wrong drink and told him what I really ordered. Instead of a polite smile or even a shrug of apology. Mr. Cashier went into a hissy fit telling the server ""SHE ORDERED A WARM CHAI TEA and she stressed on the WARM""I automatically thought maybe I made a mistake. But NO, how could I when I never ordered whatever chai is in my life!?Short story, sometimes winning"" isn't all it's cracked out to be. Your customers aren't in competition with you. All we want is prompt (in this case), good service, and good food/product. The End.",1,2,1
9,Candice L.,"Brentwood, Los Angeles, CA",258,63,42,1.0,4/26/2017,"Awful service. Rude staff. It was almost as if they were doing me a huge favor by serving me. Then the coffee machine had an issue. 10 minutes later, I asked how much longer? Uh-oh.....bad move on my part. Unreal. Avoid. Two thumbs down",2,2,
10,Kenneth T.,"New York, NY",180,643,42,4.0,7/7/2017,"I go to a few locations near this one but this one is definitely my favorite. The staff here are friendly and attentive - when they're out of something, they make personal recommendations which I like. The only down side is sometimes it gets too busy to where you're ignored.",,,
11,Zulekha F.,"St. Petersburg, FL",30,26,80,5.0,12/30/2016,It's small but the staff appears friendly. It's not too far from Bloomingdale's so it's great after shopping.,,,
12,Sejla A.,"Kensington, Brooklyn, NY",88,16,10,5.0,11/17/2016,"This Starbucks is amazing!!!!!!!!!! The service is what makes it so amazing. Close to all of the different Starbucks locations have the same drinks and they taste the same- so I would say that they are mostly judged by customer service.I have been going here for over 3 years, and I have not had a complaint yet. All the employees are great (very nice) and they really are quick workers. When there is a long line, I know that it'll pass in a matter of seconds, and food and drinks are always received. I recommend this location to every New Yorker who is impatient (like me haha)!",,,
13,Diana M.,"Queens, NY",78,167,383,2.0,8/12/2015,Lack of seating. I ordered a sandwich and ate it standing up. There's like a 10 foot table with 7 steel chairs. 3 stools over by where they wait for their drinks. - All filled with  electronic junkies. Idk what's up with these two giant radiator things on both sides of the sugar/milk station.,,,
14,Stuart S.,"West Linn, OR",0,27,0,1.0,11/14/2017,You never get what you ask for. Wet cappuccino means dry every friggin time unless you check. Speed more important than accuracy. The chocolate croissant is worse than if Dunklin Donuts made it. God awful. Pass.,,,

Updated review",I don't know if this is a new Starbucks thing or just this location but they barely put in whip cream as they used to! I just got a hot chocolate and it has the smallest bit of whip cream which is unacceptable for a $4 hot chocolate. If I didn't want whip cream I would have asked for it. What was the point of the barista asking if I wanted whip if they wouldn't really give me anyway?...The hot chocolate itself is a bit watered down. What the heck! It has always been such a stable beverage.,,,
16,Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,2242,478,4.0,12/17/2017,"i enjoyed my early sunday visit as i waited for my buddy to pick me up for our journey to white plains and starbucks is a safe bet if you have time waste .the location is lexington ave and 63rd st steps from the mta train station so if you need your coffee fix before heading to work or play you are in luck . not the biggest bucky around but space is use wisely with a giant communal table, some counter seating by front window and stool counter space in back . i like the art paintings on wall which is better then the bland art at some other starbucks . the place is clean and organized which includes the condiment counter which is fully stocked with sugar. straws, napkins, etc and the eats display is set up in a way that you can see what's available pronto , the blueberry muffin and lemon pound cake was steering me in that direction and some decaff cappy also. for a smaller size starbucks i must say that's it spacious in a cozy way , less folks and more space with fast wifi is cool with me. my ride is here so this review is over .4 stars on my yelp meter .",5,3,2
17,Linna F.,"New York, NY",34,375,67,3.0,7/13/2016,"Generally efficient - the line to order moves fast in the morning before 9am. However, waiting for a drink (even one that is easy to make - iced coffee, unsweetened, light ice) still takes longer than it would at Dunkin Donuts.",,,
18,Chi S.,"New York, NY",2,38,50,2.0,10/6/2016,I ordered a small green tea latte and it came half full. Size small is pretty small already. Why did they even make it half full? It's almost like a sample drink that I had to pay for it. Just totally absurd.,,,
19,Amy M.,"Indio, CA",221,206,1161,4.0,5/8/2015,"I have been here many times and John makes the best drinks in my opinion. Very sad that they don't have blackberry mojito this year.

Will definitely be back!",,,

23,James W.,"Los Angeles, CA",2729,1914,8247,3.0,7/22/2015,"I had the hibiscus refresher because they were out of the other one. It was well-made, and wasn't too sweet. I actually came to do work because there are surprisingly few coffee shops open past 8pm on the Upper East Side. This place is open until 11pm, has some outlets, and a communal table that's well-lit. This will likely be my staple late-night working area.",3,,1
24,Alicia G.,"Chicago, IL",340,516,143,4.0,3/11/2014,"You know you're impatient but not lazy when you don't want to wait at the Hunter Starbucks and would rather walk 5 blocks to the real Starbucks. I like this new Starbucks for my tea and pretzel addiction. The staff has always been friendly and the place is always clean. There isn't much seating though, and you can tell the people who are seated have been there for a loooooooong time drinking up the coffee AND the wifi. They always have the pastries I want (don't judge), and it's nice not having to trek to 3rd Avenue to go to the other (of course) Starbucks.",1,1,1
25,Judy S.,"New York, NY",313,1107,1132,3.0,9/8/2014,"I mean, it's a Starbucks so there's only a couple things you really need to know. Unfortunately I didn't use the bathroom, so no comments on that -- other than the huge line I saw for it.1. Seating - There is one of those large computer tables that seats eight. There's also two cushion ""seats"" by the window and a couple of bar stools where you pick up your order.2. Service - When I went (Sunday afternoon), there was a longer line to use the restroom than to actually order something. However, even with how empty it was. The register barista was snappy and seemed way too impatient for a lineless Starbucks. Although I'm not usually sensitive about being barked to (c'mon usually these places have way too many customers; cut them some slack), there was NO ONE HERE, so don't yell at me... Perhaps they are usually really busy, so they are in that ""order and go"" sort of mindset.",,,
26,Celenise M.,"Queens Village, NY",21,9,5,5.0,9/23/2016,Constantly and consistently amazing service. People that truly love and enjoy what they do and it's refreshing to see.

28,Brian M.,"Manhattan, NY",1171,1133,8582,4.0,2/15/2014,This is my 'go-to' Starbucks before I hop on the F train to head off to Queens to visit friends since the 63rd Street Station (F train) is conveniently located right next to this particular branch. Baristas here are pretty good at what they're doing and not distracted by each other and seem to have their shit together. I've yet to see a sign of ghettoness except those awkward times when Chinese ladies peek into the store and try to sell pirated DVDs from China to customers which is pretty embarrassing (must have guts to do that sort of stuff. It's like walking into a Department Store and selling fake Louis Vuitton bags directly across from a Louis Vuitton store lol) But I digress (as usual) yeah. Outlets are available and the overall layout is pretty nice.,,,
29,Victoria O.,"New York, NY",785,815,371,4.0,10/25/2013,"Prettiest Starbucks in the area but very little seating. They have these window seats which are lovely and large but you're not going to cozy up with a stranger even in friendliest of cities and drink coffee on a cushy bench. I love it though. I'm glad they opened one I like though I never sit at Starbucks anymore in the city. Now I have WiFi in the apartment plus an iPhone 5. I used to hang out a lot 3 years ago at the 66th and 3rd, which has a lot of seating and chatty regulars. Still it's nice to have one within a block of Burger Heaven which serves bilge water passing for coffee. I only go to Burger Heaven at all for breakfast because I love the people who work there and the view is so nice. The Artisan sandwich is a nice cheap breakfast option now that Wrap 'n Run has closed for good. The fire/flood a few trips ago was so sad for the owner who still owns one up town in the high 70s. I miss my Caribbean smoothie and I don't think Starbucks smoothies are anything to write home about.Last week, I ordered a tall coffee (that's all I ever order at Starbucks other than the sandwiches) and there had to have been two tablespoons of coffee grounds at the bottom. I meant to keep the cup but threw it out and they replaced it without proof of purchase. I thought that was very nice. I might sit here with my laptop if there were anywhere to sit but the communal table is always jammed. This is like a commuter Starbucks but nicer inside.",,,

Mobile ordered a drink in the morning and they got it wrong; came in the afternoon, ordered in person, and they got it wrong again and were extremely rude when I asked them to make it again. So rude that I simply asked for a refund and went to a different Starbucks. Absolutely disgusting behavior.",,1,
35,Nicolette T.,"Downtown Flushing, Queens, NY",7,56,113,2.0,3/21/2014,"LOL'ing to the in-depth reviews about the quality of their products when this is simply your run-of-the mill Starbucks in a yuppy neighborhood filled with yoga girls drinking green smoothies and mid-20 year old ""business men"" who take more pride in their looks and how they order their coffee rather than the actual quality of it.This is your typical Starbucks coupled with rudeness. I find the clientele to be extremely pretentious. Every time I have held open a door for someone I have not gotten a ""thank you."" 2 Stars for the quick service of this sometimes busy location (which I go to because of the lack of quality coffee around the area) which is really great sometimes if you are in a rush, but their commitment to quickness leaves you with a sense of being rushed, having your order taken wrong, rudeness from the employees, and a loss of personalization that is ""supposed"" to come with the Starbucks experience.Bonus point for the milk/sugar station always being clear because the yuppies already order their sugar-filled upside-down frap mocha caramel machhiato espresso double-flip mocha cherry pies. Minus one for the lack of seating.Overall, this is just a Starbucks. You are more or less bound to either have a good, bad, or mediocre experience at one of their stores. Quality of coffee remains the same, service and store varies, people are almost always pretentious and over-analytical of their product when it is completely unnecessary since IT IS ALL THE SAME. Just not the most enjoyable experience coming here.",,1,
36,Shannon Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",466,750,620,3.0,6/3/2014,"I don't know why I'm reviewing a Starbucks but I do feel that even though all drinks are standardly made at each and every SB, the vibe at each one of them is always different. I give this place a 3 stars. I don't like how this Starbucks is laid out. I feel that they could be utilizing their space a lot better but whatev, its Starbucks. You either hate it or love it but It's still going to be there. I do have to say the morning rush does a good job cranking their drinks to customers. There was only one time where I waited 5 minutes for my drink which sucked but other than that I get my CM pretty quickly.",,,

This place almost always has a long line, yet they keep it moving quickly and I before I can think of what I want I'm next on line.  Even waiting for my order isn't too bad. The staff here is so efficient.The location itself is new, clean, and aesthetically pleasing.

Even with the label printed out, they don't read the special requests. The only thing they read is the name of the drink. I work very close to this starbucks, so I use this starbucks a lot but seriously...they make mistakes everytime!! Not once they gave me a correct drink. What is so hard to just add soymilk?? It's not like I asked for tons of requests!! Besides the order mistakes, they also upset me with insuffient amount of frappuccino. They NEVER fill it up!! I pay for a grande size and what I get is a drink in between tall and grande. That's what gets me even more upsetting bcuz it's an ambiguous amount that I cannot even complain about. As a matter of fact, it's almost a tall sized amount when I hit the bottom of the cup on the table and let the ice leveled straight. Complaining would just make me a nasty customer and I wouldn't want them to remake the drink..don't like slaving people around. The attitude of the staffs are okay however.
