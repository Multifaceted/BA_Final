1,,7/6/2018,282,,"Queens, NY",Shaji K.,1490,3.0,1524,"Stopped by for a quick drink at this bar while waiting for some people. Small intimate bar that's not too fancy or divey with some bar seating up front and small tables in the middle and edges.They don't seem to have a draft list (just bottles from what I could tell), so ordered one of their bottled IPAs ($7). Quick turnaround from the staff as they come around collecting bottles and other odds and ends fairly quickly. Not the greatest price point but around what you would find in the neighborhood.Seems like a solid spot for a casual date but not for a big group.",
2,,9/19/2018,0,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Robert S.,0,2.0,18,This place is way too noisy. Noisy to the extent that it is genuinely difficult to hear what your friend is trying to say (yell) to you. Noisy to the extent that I'm sure the employees incur permanent hearing damage once they have worked there for a week or more. The main point of a bar should be good conversation and that is very difficult here. I suggest you look elsewhere.,

The outside temp was 20, what were they thinking.  I mean we had coats on and it gets warm in the bar but why would all of the windows be open? The beer options were fine but I could not understand why they had the windows open, it was delusional.  Overall: Seems like a tight place to grab night cap but if they keep their windows open again, I'll probably not go in.",

Drinks prices were average ($10 for prosecco). It's small and dark inside. Bartender was attentive but overall this bar was nothing special. Fine for a drink or two.,

7,,1/11/2017,312,1,"Hartford, CT",Jack M.,377,4.0,195,The best part of the bar is the atmosphere. It is small and cozy (especially on the snowy day when I visited) with dark wood furniture and floors. There furniture is creative with a miniature bar/stalls in the middle and a wooden bench running along the window. The prices are fine for the area. The cocktails we ordered were fine but a bit weak and were not served in the correct vessel. There were not any house specialty cocktails or particularly unusual beers and wines. It seemed like a pleasant place to have a drink if you just want a staple beverage. We were able to hold a conversation without having to yell over the music. The music was enjoyable including some of last decade's pop and current music that was relaxed and upbeat at the same time.,2
8,,3/12/2017,120,,"Manhattan, NY",Laura S.,4,4.0,296,"Park Bar is the perfect place to visit for a drink or two, if you're in between activities such as waiting to be seated at a table in a nearby restaurant, or pre-movie beverage. With that purpose in mind, it's great. I've definitely wound up here a few times because I either just wanted a quick glass of wine or was waiting for my table to be ready at the nearby sushi restaurant 15 East.I keep emphasizing not to plan a whole evening here because it gets uncomfortable packed and it's a pretty small place. From my experience, crowd could be a little mix of Wall Street meets Madison Avenue. There's nothing wrong with that, but definitely a congregation of New York's young finance professionals [probably on Tinder dates].",

Drinks were a fair price given the location. The bar is pretty small and intimate. I would go for a date or casual drinks to catch up with a friend. I wouldn't come with a big group. I love the natural light that comes into the bar.,

Music is ok, I like that they mixed some Latino songs in there. There's not much room for dancing - it's really just a square room divided with a high bar top in the middle.",
17,18,10/6/2015,497,12,"New York, NY",Eric J.,1710,4.0,923,"Slowly but surely becoming my go-to bar in the Union Square area. I actually didn't even know it was called Park Bar until very recently. It's always chill, never too crowded, they have great music (particularly, a lot of Michael Jackson), and the alcohol selection is decent and relatively cheap compared to other bars in the area. NOTE: there are no draft beers, but the bottle selection is pretty good, and they have a few rotating seasonal beers along with the staple domestic beers. The clientele is incredibly hard to pinpoint, since it's a very random mix of fratty young professionals, all the way to extreme hipsters to yuppie Chelsea residents. That being said, the clientele is never too in-you-face to ruin your experience and it's never been a problem for me.The place itself isn't terribly big, but it's incredibly low-key, given the location. Bartenders are always attentive and very quick with the drinks. They don't have anything very fancy or innovative in terms of cocktails or mixed drinks, but they'll give you something strong and delicious.In all, the offerings and the space aren't particularly unique or outstanding, but overall performance is just consistent and solid. I highly recommend Park Bar for first dates or small groups, just because you know what you're getting and there's not much of a chance of things going wrong. Definitely one of those places where you can have good conversation, go to a bar without spending too much money, while still avoiding the drudgery of staying in your apartment. Isn't that all you can hope for during a chill night out?",21

I wasn't thrilled with this bar, and I won't be coming back.- It's a dark, small, and very loud bar. So loud, that at 6pm on a weeknight, you have to scream over some maniac in a suit just to be heard by your friend.. or the bartender, who gets very chatty with the customers and you heav to try hard to get her attention to make you another drink.- It smells like a seedy bar. This is not a pretty lounge to sip an expensive cocktail. It's a beer and a shot kind of place (think Corner Bistro.)- There is NO HAPPY HOUR here, contrary to the info they have posted.- The minimum for a credit card here is $20. So it's basically a 2-3 drink minimum. They may as well implement a cash-only practice.",5

They have beer, wine, and some champagne options as well.Food: You can get a bowl of nuts. So, if you like nuts, go nuts.

Their bartenders are insanely friendly and if you sit at the bar, you can't help but befriend them! Davina is amazing - definitely ask for her!! Strong drinks, dark lighting, good music, central location - this is a great place for post-work drinks, meet up with friends before dinner, or a place to wind down the night before heading home.

I happened in here with a friend on a Saturday night, from around 9:30 til midnight and the clientele changed dramatically from the artsy chic to nearly empty to the club era getting a quick drink before beginning their meatpacking club adventures. The drinks are well priced and well served, with an attentive and knowledgable bartender. It can get a little packed but there was too for a seat at all times. A little louder than my liking, but there is an effective music change based on majority clientele at any given time (kind of impressive). *Bonus: I signed my credit card statement after closing out at the end of the night but forgot to take my credit card out of the clip. The bartender actually ran half a block to catch up with me to give me my card back. THAT, my friends, is customer service.",6

No bouncer to check IDs, or at least not at the time I went. It's a small intimate bar. Crowd is late 20s to early 30s I'd say. Dark and average noise in the background.

False false false advertising!!! The menu is standard at all hours: $6 beers, reds $9 or $10 and whites $8 - $10.

What I didn't appreciate was when the bartender checked my ID and I was ready to order but they went to help some other people. I mean why even bothering checking my ID then?!Overall experience... The atmosphere is nice I can't complain. The bartenders could be a little bit more attentive considering it is such a small place. The drinks were whatever... They costs about $8-9 a drink with a $20 card minimum. Basically normal anywhere you go around the city.,1
42,,4/17/2012,255,1,"New York, NY",Teresa L.,259,3.0,403,"I came here on a Sunday for drinks. This bar is relatively obscure despite its location within the vicinity of Union Square. After throwing elbows for bar space at other venues all weekend, Park Bar's emptiness was a welcome sight.I strolled in and the bartender had nothing but smiles for me, joking that I was late. Why hello there, Nick Carter look-alike. The drink menu is pretty average, small enough to fit on a chalkboard behind the bartender. I don't recall a food menu. The set up of the place is very intimate. The tables are meant to seat two people, so don't arrive with a party of 10 and expect to be seated. The room seemed like one big piece of dark paneled wood, and each table is light by two overhead lights and one gas candle. If you're on a date, your date will look great (and probably somewhat scary).I'd recommend this bar if you're in the mood for a drink and wanted to get away from the hustle & bustle of Union Square.",

This review is basically for weeknights.That being said, I LOVE this place! The drink prices aren't too bad, the bartender always remembers me and has a heavy hand (mega plus!) and is such a sweetheart. I come here a lot with my boyfriend and it always sets the mood - great music (an awesome variety by the way, I've heard everything from Lil Jon and Pitbull to Little Dragon and Crystal Castles, it's THAT good!), nice ambiance (candles, dim lighting, very sexy!) and good drink prices. I'm a huge fan. I guess the oooonly thing I'm not big on here is that sometimes I notice couples going into the bathroom and that's a little weird. They hold up the line and it's pretty obvious they were doing some not so PG things up in there. I wish someone who works here would tell them not to do that.But other than that, love this place.

50,,3/19/2013,0,4,"Paris, France",Katja V.,9,3.0,83,"Let me just preface this review with the fact that I love Park Bar... really. I've loved this place for several years. The bartenders all have great musical tastes (or whomever's ipod is responsible for the superb music) and the cocktails they prepare are always tasty (best grey goose and soda in the city). So why not five stars? Well, I suppose because of random incidents that I've witnessed here that I imagine could happen at any bar quite honestly, but the fact that they happened in front of me makes me realize that love is, often times, blind. Case report #1: Morbidly obese bachelorette party on Saturday, 16-Mar-2013. In all fairness, not all of them had a BMI of over 40 - there was approximately one normal looking one, but she was usually invisible from the overwhelming adipose tissue surrounding her. One of them was wearing a feather boa - and trust me, nothing is more disgusting than a fat chic covered in feathers.  Anyways, suffice it to say that it wasn't the fault of Park Bar that this party arrived, but unfortunately this was the only place without a doorman that they could get past the door. Case report #2: Drunken girl face plants onto the floor after taking several shots of Jameson.  From the look of her green eyeliner, I am positive that she was celebrating St. Patrick's Day. How do you say completely f**king disgusting in Gaelic?Case report #3: One of the regulars at the bar offers to sell me drugs. I've seen him there several times previously, but this was the first time we had ever had a discussion (and shared drinks together). After he offers to sell me drugs, I express my surprise that he is a drug dealer to which he drunkenly slurs, ""I'm not a drug dealer."" What makes one a drug dealer again? I must be unclear on the definintion.Fortunately, contrary to popular thought, one bad apple does not spoil a bunch, but rather the amount of oxygen in the air does. Thus, if you can avoid breathing the same air as the minority listed above, you may just end up loving Park Bar as much as I do.",1

I was stumped trying to think of a nearby bar to meet a separate friend at while waiting for Bar 13 to fill up with its usual melange of scantily-clad-yet-slightly-overweight females and the B&T gents who ride in to join them. If that sounds harsh, you've never been to Bar 13.And you should probably also skip Park Bar. It seemed the least offensive from google's comparison of sidebar and union square lounge, and we all tire of the coffee shop...so I gave Park Bar a go. It is set up with tables along the wall, a central longer table and a bench at which 8 leggy girls were seated giggling and sipping on rum and diets, only to give me a dirty look when I set my bag on the ledge to scope out a spot. The drinks are exactly what you'd expect: simple, overpriced, and prepared at lightning speed if you're lucky enough to find space to amble up to the bar. My friend and I snagged a table along the wall we thought was free, only to have several european gentlemen reappear to claim their last sip of cider from the empty glasses on the table. They sat back down with us, and we successfully crowded about 8 people around a 2x2 table. So if you like to cram in shoulder to shoulder while you sip mediocre mixed drinks and wait for the nextdoor club to get busy, Park bar is your place. And you probably do like these things, if you hang out in Union Square - so 3 stars for that.",2

It's near Union Square, so nobody has a really good excuse to not show up or even get lost.Size. Not too big. Not too small. One soon realizes it can accommodate more bodies, comfortably, than you'd expect just looking at it. This has to do with efficient use of space, including the standing bar area and small tables on the perimeter.Service. It's wonderful. From happy hour to raging Saturday, this place always serves with a smile. Table service on the less busy nights is a definite plus. The bartenders are friendly, and Elan (sp?) poured me some birthday shots. Awesome.Ambiance. Simple. No neon, no TVs. Despite being near Union Square, it never gets too busy and it's usually a respectable crowd of young professionals and some cool kids. It almost feels hidden but it's got floor to ceiling windows, so I can never explain why it never gets jam packed, not that I'm complaining.I find Park Bar to be my go-to for all of my gatherings and my guests always comment the great choice of location.

Our willpower seems to be bafflingly weak when it comes to Park Bar. Maybe it's the always lively crowd, or the good music, or the dim lighting. Or maybe it's the bartenders who never give daunting looks of judgement when you ask if they've seen your debit card (tip them well!). The next morning, we often argue over who it was that suggested going there, and try to remember exactly what happened in what order. And then vow never to go there again. Except to pick up the cell phone one of us left last night.P.S. It's super great during the summer when the large panels at the facade are opened up!P.P.S. There's a $20 minimum for credit cards, which has never proven to be a problem to rack up $20 in drinks, even if the purpose of the visit is a ""nightcap"" or a ""quick one."")",3

I have to say I LOVE the list of drinks and prices placed nicely on the humongous mirror behind the bar. Each time I have gone the staff is more then friendly, walking around asking if you need another drink. You know, trying to keep the cash and booze flowing - I get it.Any complaints? Not really. I really like the music selection and since I've only ever ordered wine, I cannot yelp about the mixed drinks. Sorry lads!All in all, this is a good place to get your night started.

We walked in and my first impression, not a great one, was that it was dark and loud. I was looking to chat with my friend, so I was skeptical that this was a good choice. Anyway, when we got to the bar, there were two seats right in the middle, as if they were waiting for us. In my opinion it was the perfect amount of crowded for a Wednesday night. When we sat down, we were greeted by a smile and super friendly bartender. I asked for a cocktail menu and was disappointed when I heard they didn't have one, but the bartender (Yoki --- that's his name) assured me that any drink I wanted he could make, or, even better, that if I told him what I was looking for he would come up with something perfect for me. Who knew I was going to a bar with a mixologist. His drinks evolved as the evening progressed (or maybe I was just getting more drunk... could have been a little of both) and each one hit the spot in a different way. All in all, the bartender was really friendly, which made me more comfortable, the music although loud didn't wind up being a problem because I'm kind of loud too, and the lack of cocktail list made for a more adventurous (but successful) night because I had no idea what I'd be getting each time.

The drinks are a little pricey (12 for cocktails), but the cocktails are definitely worth a try. We also got a pitcher of sangria after a few rounds of drinks, but I was either a little too drunk already or the sangria was really too sweet for my liking.

Personally, I like bars more than I like drinking. At first that may not make any sense but a good bar is about the feeling you get from the crowd and the physical nature of the bar itself.

There is one waitress who always serves me is friendly and talkative, but gets off her shift early (midnight?). Nothing on tap, but I like their selection of beer and well-mixed cocktails.",1

158,,4/26/2006,177,,"Jamaica, NY",Jim C.,0,4.0,120,Laid back. Good crowd plus good cocktails=many a long night for yours truly. Nice and shadowy inside so you're never sure exactly who you're talking to.,
159,,10/29/2008,15,,"Arlington, VA",Lauren R.,0,4.0,120,"Hung out at Park Bar last time I was in the city and I really liked it. It has a nice, warm decor and a good laid back vibe, mostly young professionals but a slightly older crowd than the post-college scene (a good thing in this neighborhood since its so close to student housing). Drink prices were pretty reasonable for Manhattan standards. Its definitely small, but more in an intimate way than crowded. I would definitely go back.",
160,,3/3/2011,11,,"ASTORIA, NY",Sarah T.,0,3.0,29,"I've been to Park Bar twice, and had a very difference experience each time. The visits were about 2 years apart, not sure if that had anything to do with it. On my first visit two years ago, the bar was very quiet and low key--good place for a date or a drink with a friend as the atmosphere was conducive to conversation. However, I went back last night around 8pm and it was crowded and loud; not at all conducive to conversation. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting the same atmosphere I experienced my first time there. Nothing wrong with loud and crowded though, as long as that's what you're expecting. I only had beer, so I can't attest to the cocktails, but they do have a good beer selection. Crowd is young professional and you can't beat the location right on Union Square. I've only been here on weeknights and tend to think of it more as an after work place than a weekend spot.",

Fun and funky bar with no pretention. Just a bunch of fun 20 somethings looking for a fun evening without having to deal with annoying bouncers, high prices, long lines at the bar, or a bridge and tunnel crowd.",

165,,3/24/2008,5,,"Santa Monica, CA",Ned A.,0,3.0,15,"This bar is ok i suppose.  I think I liked it better when I came in the summer and you could sit half in a half out but I assume there's someplace else in the city where you can do that.It seems that price on some of the drinks are just whatever the bartender wants to charge you...our bill showed up with what looked like hieroglyphics and something we eventually figured out was a $40.2 complaints:  There was what i thought was a bouncer but he was switching back and forth between standing next to us at the bar and lounging in a chair in the back instead of at the door.  Maybe he was just a buddy of the bartender but his presence was kind of annoying.And the women's bathroom has no light...and no, it wasn't just out.  Now this doesn't effect me that much and I kind of enjoy having my date splashed with a little urine before we get back to my place but seriously, go out and get a Fisher Price ""Night-so-bright.""  I'll spot you the 3 dollars.",
