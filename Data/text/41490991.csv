We need to wait a few minutes to get in.The service was attentive and it was not overly noisy. We started from oysters to share. Well I am not the oyster professional, the oyster was fresh, small and salty.For the main course:Chicken sandwich: the brioche bun was tasty, the chicken breast was super tender, but I did not taste the truffle butter.Cobb Salad: large serving and beautiful. We also had a French toast as dessert. A little bit too sweet for me but tasty. More food reviews: xuxinyi_nancy.",,,
2,Max And Giselle L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2,7,29,4.0,11/3/2018,"This is our first visit to the Nomad (a one Michelin star restaurant) for a light brunch on a Saturday.  M&G SNAPSHOTOrdered:--Must try - Short Rib Hash (Main),--Recommended - Pork Belly (Side)--Average -  Bay Scallops (Appetizer)Price: $80 (incl tax/tip) for brunch Intolerence Friendliness: Yes (gluten/dairy/egg white free options)M&G Rating: 4.3/5*Max has gluten, dairy and egg white intolerances and will share his insights.HIS & HER REVIEW (43/50)1) Ambience (9/10)If high-end vintage bar and dinning is your thing, this is the spot! The restaurant features a glass ceiling and sunlit garden in the middle of a dark, luxurious hotel. Beautiful and elegant setting, even on the cloudy day we were there. We were seated at a table for two in the centre of the restaurant. You may find it a bit cramped trying to get in and out of your seats and can overhear other conversations. 2) Taste (8.5/10) a. Bay Scallops (Average) - a light palate cleanser, the scallops tasted fresh with a bright yuzu flavor. Nothing out of the ordinary. b. Short Rib Hash (Must try) - our absolute favourite dish and one of the best short ribs we ever tasted. The combination of each element creates such a mind-blowing flavor profile. Melt in your mouth short ribs married beautifully with the savory potato hash, accented by the acidity of the greens, topped with a perfectly poached creamy egg. c. Smoked Pork Belly (Recommended) - Smoked pork belly served with figs and a sweet glaze, the dish was delicious but borderline too sweet for Giselle. We expected the pork belly skin to be crispy and the meat to be tender instead it was firm.3) Presentation - 8.5/10 - Each dish was cleanly presented with a focus on the main ingredients.4) Value for money - 9/10 - Money well spent in a beautiful open sky setting with delicious food. Portion of food is reasonable for fine dining.   5) Service - 8/10 - Our waiter was good and checked on us constantly. He was willing to find out food that may have contained my intolerances.  No coat service was provided. Reservations were easy to book online through their main website and special requests could be added.Overall Impression:  The highlight of our brunch experience was the short rib hash and the unique dining setting. It's always an achievement when we find great dishes Max can enjoy and tolerate. Next time we would love to come back for a full service dinner menu.",,,1
3,Darren B.,"Austin, TX",356,947,2625,4.0,10/9/2018,"Big fan of The NoMad. With it's sultry and swanky atmosphere, fantastic service (Frank is awesome), and delicious burger (great fries too), we had a fantastic time dining here.Their burger, as noted above, was delicious and likely made it into my top 10. It's pretty small in stature, but gargantuan in flavor. The complimentary bread with roasted garlic and garbanzo beans was really good and a great way to start. My only criticism and what prevents this from being 5 stars for me is that while the cocktails were good, they were not $17 a piece good. I've had $10 cocktails that had more depth and nuance to them than these did so that's my only real knock.I will definitely stop in here again and most likely will do their famous roasted truffle chicken next time, as well as a repeat of the burger.",4,2,5

5,Florence V.,"Dyker Heights, NY",90,30,108,4.0,10/22/2018,"Slow but friendly service, some dishes were good but would skip the overrated Chicken for 2. Love the ambiance and lighting and would be perfect for a night out or work dinner. The milk and honey ice cream was good but may be too sweet for some - I have a high tolerance for sweets so it was just right for me. Truffle flatbread was a good sharing dish to nibble on while drinking wine. The squash reminds you of the fall and while the portion is small, the flavor was a sweet and salty buttery concoction. Our favorite was the duck - crispy skin, tender, and evenly cooked. Not too overwhelming as a meat dish.",2,,2
6,Yin H.,"San Francisco, CA",88,463,124,5.0,11/4/2018,"Amazing rich decadent food and ambiance. Come here and prepare to feast for $$$! Service is amazing and they have a great bar where you can get a few drinks while waiting for your reservation. As a group of 4, we got to try everything we wanted on the menu including the chicken for 2, the duck and the suckling pig. Everything was prepared elegantly and portions are definitely on the smaller side but the richness makes up for it. They even brought out the chicken to show you before they carved it up and prepared it 2 different ways.",1,1,1
7,Gab G.,"New York, NY",201,1480,4346,4.0,7/20/2018,"Tried for a walk-in at around 6:30 on a weekday night and got a table right away. I found the service to be really slow, and one of the dishes was cold enough to be inedible, but overall the food is delicious and I had a good experience. My boyfriend and I shared the foie gras, followed by the tortelloni with braised lamb and beef bone marrow crusted with beets. We also had a fish (forget the exact dish). Finally, rhubarb cobbler for dessert. All of the dishes were beautifully presented. The foie gras is heavenly and not to be missed. The tortelloni was unfortunately cold and therefore not super edible, and the waiter didn't charge us for it, which I appreciated. The other entrees were excellent and I loved the dessert. We skipped the milk and honey, since you can get the exact same thing at Made Nice next door for $6.Can't wait to come back and try the bar, as they have a totally different menu. I need that burger!",1,,

Updated review","My friend recommended this place to us, it was very impressive! The service, the place, and the food was amazing. We want to try both roast chicken for 2 and the duck, and we also need to save room for the dessert. So we didn't order appetizer. The duck was my favorite, very juice and the crispy skin. MUST TRY! The chicken was great too, so flavorful and delicious! They cook the chicken with foie gras and truffle inside. Also for the dessert, Milk & Honey is MUST!!!!!!! So good! You will regret it if you don't try it.",,,
9,Efraim S.,"New York, NY",23,342,485,4.0,5/28/2018,"Everyone goes here for the chicken and I didnt order. So if you want a review on that I recommend going to any other review. I started with the tart with cheese. It was fairly below average and I wasnt sure if I had made a single wrong choice or if this was a sign of what was to come. Turns out everything else was delicious, service was 5 stars and the ambiance is well thought out though not my style. First, you get a focaccia which is such an elevated offering over a crummy bread basket. For mains we got these incredible carrots that have so much flavor and asparagus. It is a toss up between the two. They are so different but equally amazing. Carrots are more smokey and almost heave (as heavy as carrots can be) while the asparagus are full of interesting and complicated flavors. To end it we got the cobbler and milk and honey. Order both and thank me later.",4,,1
10,Jesse S.,"Jersey City, NJ",211,109,96,5.0,5/29/2018,"A truly wonderful experience! We made a 5:45pm reservation as it was all we could ever seem to find. The dining was mostly empty and had open tables as it slowly filled up until around 7:30pm. The chicken for two was remarkable just as the previous reviews say. I should have asked a few questions as I was surprised at the presentation and multiple ways it came prepared. However the white breast meat was exactly what you've always wanted it to taste like. The dark meat was prepared to bring out the rich flavors. All of the other food I saw looked solid, but not like this bird. Get this, get this, get this! You also can't argue with the beer pairing. It's dark yet very smooth and pairs perfectly with the bird, imagine that. The service was top notch. They were there whenever you needed and never missed a moment. I will say a bit over the top to get you started and checking in too often. And once you're stuffed and pass on dessert the dishes and bill seem to disappear like magic letting you know it's time to go.",2,,1

They make their pastries in house and I was dying over their Hazelnut Chocolate croissant - next time would like to try their PB and J croissant too! Servings are really big here so either come with and appetite or share with friends. Recommend the fried chicken for the table and the burger as well.

13,Lily C.,"Los Angeles, CA",253,362,330,4.0,8/12/2018,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday with girlfriends after having made reservations prior. It was a really adorable spot, and the servers were really nice and friendly. Surprisingly, it wasn't busy at all and the room never quite filled up. I got the short rib hash, which was pretty good, but I wish there was more! But no worry, that means I had room left to order some croissants. I wish they weren't $7 each, and to be honest they weren't $7 good, you know what I mean? I think Nomad deserves more of a 3.5 star. It's good, but you're paying for the luxury of the hotel and experience, with decent food.",1,,1
14,Diane K.,"New York, NY",216,108,702,4.0,3/17/2018,"Gorgeous brunch/lunch place in Midtown. It's got a lot of seating and a couple of sections with different vibes. My friends and I caught the brunch at 1:30pm on a Saturday. My friend was able to call them and book for 6 at about 2 hours before the requested time. Not sure how busy it can be sometimes but it's definitely a good idea for larger parties to call. When we arrived, the restaurant was not fully packed. We got a nice round table near the kitchen with a couch and 2 individual chairs. The brunch menu was not overly extensive but it is enough to feed everyone with different tastes. They have 5 Bloody Mary for brunch. Some are very interesting, such as 'Bloody Bull' which contains veal juice. It was good but not superb but it all depends on your taste. My boyfriend enjoyed his Bloody Bull very much. $16 a glass, so choose wisely.However, the entrees were very impressive. With prices a bit above average than other brunch places, they are worth a try (note: not for the quantity). 50% of my group selected the 'Short Rib Hash' $28 and they all love it. The 3 pieces of the short rib were incredibly flavorful, although they are not dry-aged, they are comparable. I ordered 'Croque-Madame' $26 - the centerpiece was the buttery, semi-crispy pastry. It came in 2 big pieces and filled me plenty.",4,,2
15,Stefan T.,"New York, NY",105,93,186,5.0,8/4/2018,"Amazing!! That's the only word I have for this place. Had the shrimp fritters as appetizer and roasted chicken as main course. The fritters were good but you can't really go wrong here, the homemade sauce it came with complimented amazing. Roared chicken was one of the best pieces of chicken I've ever had, roasted to perfection and loved the truffle stuffed under the skin. They also have an extensive wine list with bottles ranging from 50$-5000$ so you'll definitely find something you like if you're a wine lover. No comments on service, this was perfect.",,,
16,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",229,142,835,5.0,4/11/2018,"Second visit here and it was even more amazing than the first. Came here with another couple which meant we got to order even more food this time around. It is good to note that they've been rated the best bar in the States, and definitely do a great job of upholding that title. I'm not typically one to order chicken at fancy restaurants but definitely order the chicken. The fruits de mer is also quite amazing. As was with last time, the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable, the food is on point, and the booze even better. I will say, good luck finding your way back from the bathroom. What made the night even more special was the VIP treatment to the special Cuban bar upstairs. The Diplomatico is a converted restroom, now bar, with a balcony. It was an epic way to close the night out.",,,
17,Desiree M.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",170,78,123,5.0,7/23/2018,Definitely worth coming here for the cocktails alone. Steak with the bone marrow on top was perfect.

Updated review","Updated: Dinner 12/28/17My last dining experience at NoMad was beyond amazing... however this time left us quite disappointed and craving for something special - which NoMad FAILED miserably to deliver. The ONLY saving grace - the infamous ""Milk & Honey"" dessert & their semi-attentive service but really not enough to bring us back a 3rd time. While our reservation was at 5:30... we didn't get seated until 5:45 because the hostess totally forgot about us.  We checked in - did coat check - was asked to wait while they set up.  Turns out their ""setting up"" was to create a ""make-shift"" table right by 2 entrances, where my dining partners got bumped & pushed all night long.  Wait staffs were tripped multiple times - leading us to say; ""this table was NEVER meant to be here"" - with a dose of #sideeye.   I would rather NoMad just close out their reservation for that night than to stick their guests in little corners to make that $380 profit.  Comfort over Greed - #alldayerryday Food - left so much to be desired:-Infamous chicken with foie gras/truffle, if one can fulfill hunger with scent - would be great; alas... we are human.  We need actual food.  This chicken was horribly dry, skin was chewy and we could not finish  and it was only 2 pieces.  #foodfailed-side dishes of the dark meat was decent but nothing amazing. -Suckling pig was a total fraud - more like a ""sucker"" pig!  Skin was not crispy, the meat felt mushed together... the taste was completely off.  More artsy than necessary.  Concept over quality, I guess? -Poached pear & bread pudding was tart AF! We didn't like it. Don't get it unless you love a sour face. -Fruit de mer, ""seafood"" offerings - wasn't as good as I remembered.  It lost the wow factor for me. $34 per head, overrated. For anyone who wishes to taste an epic roast chicken with foie gras, take a trip to Robuchon in Hong Kong; out of the world experience! Happy fine dining Yelpers! #willtravelforfood",5,,

Updated review","Update from previous review: they overcharged my credit card, decided my existing tip (almost 25%) wasn't enough and helped themselves to more.Doesn't matter how good the food is, if a merchant is this unscrupulous with their customers, they don't deserve my business.(I will admit, it pains me that I will no longer be patronizing them, their English muffin is that good! ;_; )",9,1,1
20,Joy P.,"Manhattan, NY",2,46,54,5.0,7/4/2018,"Great place for date night!Came here to celebrate our 4th year anniversary, and the food and service were great.FOOD:- Appetizer: we had the morels which was mushroom with sunny side up egg. The yoke was running and the mushroom was delicious! - Dinner: we went with the chicken for two and were not disappointed! The chicken was presented three ways, crispy wings, dark meat in creamy sauce, and the main dish. - Surprise: we were pleasantly surprised with this complimentary egg dish that was delicious! SERVICE: Service was great! Our waiter checked in on us regularly, water was filled all the time, and he patiently explained to us things on the menu that we didn't understand. I thought it was amazing / funny that they showed us the chicken when it came out of the oven but told us it had to go rest and cool down outside for a bit... such a tease! :) Lastly, it seemed like everyone knew it was our anniversary because we were wished happy anniversary by multiple people! So sweet.AMBIENCE:We were seated in the smaller room and it had a darker, more private atmosphere. Seats were so soft and cushioned. Quiet and you can hear each other easily. Very romantic!",1,,

23,Crystal Y.,"Flushing, NY",194,425,858,4.0,7/5/2018,"Lunch reviewI went there for lunch because of their chicken. I mean with the words foie gras, black truffle and brioche, they nailed me. Let me start by saying I wasn't all that impressed and was honestly expecting more with a $94 for two price tag. First, the portion was a bit small, considering it is designed for two. I could easily finish everything myself. The flavors weren't as strong either with the foie and truffle. Don't get me wrong, it is flavorful but since foie and truffle are such strong flavors that I was expecting more. I also wish there were more of the black meat and wings (i know i know... one chicken only has 2 wings). Neither of us was full so we ordered a slice of chocolate cake (not sure why but it was comp). When we were ready for the check, we asked our server whether we can stay there for a while since we needed to kill some time. He proceeded to move us to the library, which is their lounge. They also moved our tab over so we paid at the end of our lounge time. We ordered tea, which was expensive at $8 a pot, but it was comfortable, really nice decor and really attentive service. Their service gained them another star because the food was really 3 stars for me. I would like to try the rest of the menu next time, and I think it is a great place for special occasions.",,,
24,Dorine W.,"San Francisco, CA",0,9,0,5.0,11/19/2018,"Dark, brooding, and mysterious, this place will get you giddy about cozy fireplaces and red wine. With plush velvet chairs and polished tables beneath a vaulted ceiling, it's the perfect place to welcome fall over a shared chicken for two. The side room, or parlour, is no less dramatic, with rosy tones and rows upon rows of framed line drawings. The top-notch kitchen produces an array of seasonally inspired plates, including an impossibly elegant hamachi crudo, perfectly seared duck and house-made tagliatelle made with Meyer lemon and tender lump crab.

26,Elisa C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,58,0,3.0,9/2/2018,"A friend of mine, who I trust about food, told me to go because their roast chicken was better than Le Coq Rico. It's not.I found the roast chicken to be inedibly rich, overwhelmed with foie and truffles (I hope that's why it costs $95 for two.) Yes I am complaining about too much foie and truffles...I couldn't taste the chicken (which was cooked perfectly...the only good thing I can say about this dish) and the combined richness made me nauseous.The lovely cut of filet was overshadowed by its overly salty marrow crust and a burnt-tasting wine reduction.The appetizers were inventive and more successful. Loved the quirky radishes with butter and the fluke crudo was delicious. The artichoke and gnocchi would have been lighter without the heavy mayo-type sauce.So I think heavy sauces and rich accoutrements are the signature of this chef. Just doesn't appeal to me.The restaurant looks like a fairytale, it's just lovely. The service was excellent and we had some great (recommended) wines. I feel like I'd like  to give it another chance, however I wouldn't because of the high prices.",1,1,
27,Manna C.,"New York, NY",300,130,421,4.0,2/8/2018,"I have been to the NoMad for both cocktails at the bar and dinner at a table. The cocktails are amazing but are on the pricer side ($15-$20). My favorite at the moment is the Pandan Express (yes, you read that right), which is super easy to drink. Carrot tartare is phenomenal - I don't even like carrots. Its served in a small jar topped with a quail egg for more flavor and then you spread the tartare on a crostini. Don't worry if you run out of crostini - they will bring more! NoMad is most known for their chicken for two. Once the chefs are finished cooking the whole chicken, a waiter will bring it to your table. Yes, looks delicious and all but there is some lag time until you can get it because they bring it back to the kitchen to cut and plate. Each person gets a breast with crispy skin and seasonal vegetables on the main plate. The dark meat is then shredded and tossed in a creamy truffle sauce. Extremely decadent dish and tasty but felt like the chicken was too glorified. The suckling pig was actually the hero of my night even though it was less glamorous at the chicken. It is a nice cut of pork with crispy skin but super tender meat on the bottom. I took off one star because I tried other dishes and they weren't that memorable. Considering the price point, everything should have been mind blowing. TLDR delicious but pricy cocktails, carrot tartare, suckling pig are highlights and will return.",,,

You can only feel the tenderness of the dish, feeling it all melting in your mouth. The sides of veggies and bread are also quite delicious. We also ordered the Chicken Sandwich, the best signature dish, for sharing. No denying, it's the best. It has back truffle and foie gras together.

My favorite bites was the crispy duck skin with the juicy duck, and the crunchy crackling of the suckling pig. The tortelloni was delicious savory unctuous bite of black truffle and parmesan. This was recommended by our server and it was well worth it! The roasted chicken was ok. The skin was very crispy, the chicken breast was moist and I really enjoyed the stuffing under the skin (black truffle, leek, foie gras and potatoes). But take away the fancy stuffing, its a good roast chicken. You can just give me a bowl of that stuffing!I loved the chicken-pot-pie ramekin of dark meat. They took the roasted chicken, carved it up and served the dark meat in a ramekin with a cream sauce. I would prefer eating the dark meat in a cream sauce with the stuffing instead of the white meat! We also got two deboned chicken wings in a tiny bowl. That was ok. It was crispy and not greasy. But I like Mu Ramen's deboned chicken wing better (theirs is stuffed with foie gras). Their foie gras was beautifully presented(instagram.com/p/BgSDyupn…). It was rich and buttery but didn't have much flavor. Great foie gras has depth of flavors, is unctuous, and has the buttery texture. I really enjoyed the Milk and Honey dessert. It was simple smooth milk ice cream with gingerbread shortbread and dehydrated milk. It was very refreshing and surprisingly light. The service was perfect. The waiters and servers were a symphony- placing plates, taking away dishes, serving everyone at the same time, sweeping crumbs off the table. It was wonderful service without being overbearing or pretentious. It was a great experience! I will be back for the duck, pig, and the dessert! instagram.com/snackchatn…",10,5,11

38,Stephanie G.,"Manhattan, NY",204,18,22,5.0,5/9/2018,"This was my first visit to the NoMad in honor of my graduation from culinary school. Giving the NoMad 5 stars because we had a great experience, it's one of the best lunches I have been to. To start, we ordered the carrot tartare, it was very fresh and it had a kick to it given the horseradish, but I would probably not order it again. The complimentary dish of crudité we received however, I would order again because the chive cream is simply delicious - it's excellent with fresh veggies! The house bread was also very enjoyable, it was filled with scallions and potatoes accompanied by butter with what I believe was fleur de sel. As our mains, we ordered the chicken for two and two chicken burgers (we were 4!) and this was a lot of food! It could have been chicken for 3! The burgers were great, I got a bite of one and tried the nicely crisped fries. And the chicken, it's was the best chicken I've had so far. The chicken breast was juicy and tender and very well seasoned; the asparagus it was accompanied with was also the best piece of asparagus I've had so far! The chicken wing salad was also delicious, it's funny how something so simple like frisée can be so tasty. And of course the rest of the chicken was just as great. While we were terribly full by dessert time, I could not not order us dessert. We shared the lemon tart, the violet macaron and their classic milk & honey. All were very good, but no one in particular really popped. With our meal we also enjoyed some cocktails at the start, I had the pimms cup, great choice! And we had great service. Hope you enjoy your meal here as much as I did.",1,,

41,Tanya E.,"Kailua, HI",269,93,288,4.0,9/7/2017,"I went here for dinner with two of my friends. We were from out of town so I found this place on Yelp. I had seen a picture of the Fruits De Mer, a tower of seafood, and I knew I had to try this place out. I started with an Aperol based drink served in a coup glass. It had nice citrus aromatics that made the Aperol shine. Very yummy. Then of course we ordered the Fruits De Mer for two. Everything was a delight. But my favorite was the raw scallop ceviche like thing. It could be because I favor scallops. The had the artichoke with gnochi, arugula, and feta to share. I liked the pairing of flavors, the arugula's peppery with the saltiness from the feta went prefect on the large artichoke hearts. I choose the corn entree, because when else am I going to see corn done four ways as an entree on the menu. My other dinner guest choose the duck and suckling pig. I was able to taste all the dishes and my corn dish was by far my favorite. The dish had roasted corn, baby corn, and dehydrated corn on a corn puree. Very very yummy. And I loved all the textures. For meats I'd have to say the duck was the winner. The pig had crispy skin, but it was very hard to chew. And the pig meat wasn't as flavorful. The was tender, melt in your mouth med rare duck goodness. I'd definitely recommend trying this if you're a duck eating lover. Our wait staff was very knowledge and friendly. One of the gentlemen even knew of some places to checkout to have a drink after that turned out to be great recommendations. This is a place you need check off as a New York must! You'd have 5 stars if I had loved the pig.",2,1,

We got the carrot tartare, the lasagnette, and the summer truffle flatbread as appetizers, all of which were outstanding. It's almost sacrilege to say the carrot tartare wasn't our favorite app, but the summer truffle was just incredible. The only one I'd consider not getting next time was the lasagnette -- not because it wasn't great, but just because the menu is so stacked with other stuff I'd love to try.For our mains we got the famous roast chicken, which did not disappoint in the least. This is not the type of dish I'd normally order, but its reputation preceded it here, and I'm so glad we went with the crowd on this one -- it was incredible, easily the best of its kind I've ever had (at least that I can remember). I could eat only the skin of this chicken for the rest of my life and live pretty happily.For dessert we got the milk & honey, a staple at all of this group's restaurants, and it was incredible as always.Overall, a fantastic dinner, and I can't wait to go back.",3,,

The cocktails were perfectly balanced, and creative. They sent us an off the menu complimentary uni ""taco"" plate to start off the celebration. They are so delicious. We had the Butter Dipped Radishes, Carrot Tartare with Cured Quail Egg, Summer Truffle Tart with Corn, and the Lasagnaette . They were all so delicious, and screamed summer menu. We shared the Chicken for two. It was roasted whole, and presented to us table-side. The accomplishments and red wine pairing were perfect. The Chicken for 2 is one of the best entrees I've had in the city!For dessert we shared the Milk & Honey, and Strawberry Tart for dessert. They were phenomenal. The dessert wine pairing was perfect.

45,Elisa H.,"New York, NY",1672,521,984,3.0,8/19/2017,"I struggled to designate 3 or 4 stars for this establishment. While it's priced well, cuisine sounding and bordering on posh, a great space with decent customer service- nothing ""wowed"" me about the food. Nothing was subpar but it just didn't live up to what ""the best chicken dish"" would or should deliver, and the gorgeous pate in a jar app was just... good. If I were to rate the bar and mixologists alone, this would be a struggle between a 4-5 star rating. The Sole reason to come back to nomad is their drinks. Languish at their bar and gawk at the sleek leather aproned Pros do what they do best- muddied, shake, measure like scientists in a swanky fluorescent lab with beakers of flavor that will make you a believer. I believe the more you pay, the better the drink better be and that is true at Nomad's bar.",2,,2

48,Steven X.,"San Francisco, CA",606,59,49,4.0,9/25/2017,"This was my first Michelin star experience so was excited to come with a friend on my birthday recently. The bread was unique in that it had potatoes in and spring onions (hope that's right) on, which was a pleasant surprise. I wish it had been pre-cut because it was a little awkward cutting it into portions for myself and my friend, and it was before our utensils got there so I wasn't sure what the etiquette was. I saw at least 2 other tables having this same awkward dilemma with how to split bread. To start we had the crab tagliatelle to share which I thought was just phenomenal. If that had been an entree I may have ordered that. Split between two people was good to whet the appetite. The crab pieces were meaty and it was simple - no extra sauces to complicate the flavor of the pasta and meat combo. I paired their signature roast chicken with a sauvignon blanc; I thought they went well together. I'll withhold an opinion on the wine to more knowledgeable tastes. I will say that their wine list is *extensive* and requires flipping through multiple pages if you're searching for a bottle. I can see why their chicken is so well known. With the skin on and foie gras underneath, it had a lot more texture than I was expecting (good) and wasn't dry at all (great!). Whatever was plated on the side (corn, freekeh, and chantarelles?) made for a good mix of flavors. I really enjoyed the part of the chicken they place in little cast iron bowls that is separate from the plate. Afraid I didn't catch which part of the chicken it was or what it was mixed with.All in all, I'm a fan!",,,

The chicken for two is pure magic. The breast meat is served on a plate with mushroom purée and corn, with foie gras and truffle under the skin. The creamy foie gras and truffle mixture packs so much flavor and the chicken is perfectly tender. The dark meat is served separately with a creamy sauce that carried a hint of lemon. I appreciated the little bit of theater when they brought out the chicken in its cast iron pan so we could see the entire roast before they carved and dressed it.The restaurant begins seating for lunch at noon. If you arrive early for a noon reservation, you can either sit in the lobby or take an early drink at the bar.",1,,1

Updated review","Love the vibe, the decor, service AND food here. This is not your stuffy white table cloth spot it's a fun place with a modern elegance. Lots of couples on dates as well as groups of people at tables for a night out with friends.  The energy is buzzing and the cocktails/wine list don't hurt. We had foie gras and a snow pea chiffonade to start. I was most pleased that they provide gluten free bread from everybody eats upon request. Both were lovely and balanced each other well with the rich foie and the bright, minty crispness of the vegetables.  For dinner my husband has the poached lobster and I had the suckling pig. Both were well executed and beautifully presented. We had no room for dessert I am afraid. This is a good spot for a group or for a couple for dinner. It's not a first date spot in my opinion because it's a bit loud. Good people watching too!",3,2,3
53,Dave M.,"San Jose, CA",0,16,4,4.0,9/13/2018,"We loved it. Great bar with killer bar skills. The food in the restaurant surpassed expectations, and we had high expectations. Portion size was perfect, focus on quality rather than quantity. The beef (filet) was crusted with toasted bone marrow, and it was easily cut with a fork. Great entree. Service is the best I've had in quite awhile, the right amount but not too much. This really is a fun restaurant and bar with great food, drinks, and service. There's nothing I can think of to improve this place, we'll definitely be back.",1,,
54,Darin E.,"San Francisco, CA",295,333,16,5.0,12/24/2017,"We came here as a group of 6 and I was able to try a lot of different dishes. This place has some really good things going for it both in execution (perfectly cooked everything) and good service. If you're looking for a solid dinner with great drinks this place will check that box. IMO what made it really special was how effortless the meal was in terms of thought. All the dishes we ordered were really good (chicken for 2, beef and scallops - no misses) and the service was just enough without being overbearing. The dining room we ate in was busy but still intimate. My only recommendation is to show up early and have a few cocktails at the bar. It's really beautiful and the drinks are made well.",1,,1
55,Anonymous Z.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,2.0,10/14/2018,"We went for dinner on a Saturday and were very disappointed by the food, especially given the hype.  The ambience is beautiful and romantic, and we want to emphasize that the service was excellent.  The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly.BUT -- ""the signature dish,"" the chicken for two, was below average.  The foie gras filling tasted like burnt parmesan cheese with crumbs, and you couldn't even taste the truffle.It also took way too long in-between courses for the food to be served.This restaurant can't continue just to survive off its cool reputation.  Wish we went to another nice NYC restaurant, our money would've been better spent there.  I'd stick to just going to The Nomad Bar or the bar inside the restaurant, their drinks are great.",,,

60,Shivani B.,"Manhattan, NY",21,59,37,2.0,1/2/2018,"My husband brought me here for a birthday dinner, and I have to caveat this review by saying that I'm a vegetarian. And I wouldn't expect much if we were going to a steakhouse. But the Nomad is a Michellin-starred restaurant, which has purposely put vegetarian dishes on its menu so I wouldn't have expected them to miss the mark as poorly as they did. The truffle flatbread (which, let's be honest, is pretty hard to mess up) and the sunchoke appetizers were probably the best things we ate but it all went downhill after that. The two main vegetarian entrees we ordered were uninspiring and poorly done. One of the dishes we had ordered is no longer on the menu, so perhaps they're taking note. The cauliflower entree we ordered was doused in butter and there was no acidity to balance out the heavy flavor.  Maybe this formula works on a piece of meat but the same doesn't apply for preparing inspiring vegetables.I will say the service was really good and the ambience is great, so I'd definitely come back to the bar for drinks. And maybe if you're a meat-eater than the Nomad is a good option for you, but for vegetarians/vegans- I'd suggest skipping this place for food.",,1,

My only criticism is that my boyfriend and I always eat smaller portions of food, but it really says a lot that we would have needed an entire extra dinner to satisfy ourselves had we not eaten a late lunch - everything was closer to a tasting portion than an actual meal, so order accordingly and that's the only reason I'd give it 4/5.",,,
63,Christoph S.,"Williamsville, NY",11,151,490,2.0,12/29/2017,"Disappointment. In a famous place like that it's all about celebrating the food & wine. The expectations are high. Starting with the ambience, the service, the Sommelier, the menu, the wine list, the presentation of food and wine and all together should create a Wow-effect an experience and you know all of this has its price - but the experience should make it worth. In this case no Wow-effect more a bursted water blister. I was always impressed from the career of Swiss Chef Daniel Humm and was following his efforts in the media. On the top of my culinary list to do - was always a visit at the Eleven Madison Park. We were visiting our son in NYC over the Holiday Weekend (Thanksgiving). On the short term - best option was a visit of the NoMad - the restaurant is also under the guidance of Daniel Humm. So we booked a room in the NoMad Hotel and made a reservation for a Saturday night dinner in the NoMad restaurant. As with the wine - if you like the deuxième Chateau it's worthwhile to go for premier Chateau.Let's start with the ambience. The restaurant is setup in two rooms. One room is more or less the 'doorway' to bar. This bar is very busy - a coming and going and makes it also very noisy. The other room seems to be better located. Unfortunately we were seated in the ""Bar doorway"" for me an absolute No-Go for a Food-Celebration. The hostess wanted to seat us to at table where one person literally sat with the back in the bar - an absolute No-Go to even put a table there! After my intervention we got a table on the side - still a lot of the bar visitors were crossing your back, but much better. I prefer the classic 'white' table setup - here no nappes were used - all classic dark wooden tables - ok - It's a very dark restaurant.Honestly I don't know where to start what was going wrong for a 1 star Michelin restaurant. Obviously the Michelin testers judging different in Europe than in the US - so I will give no d... in future about Michelin stars. Let's start what was good: 1) the ambience of the bar in the library where we had a cocktail to start2) the sommelier - Jhonel Faelnar did a great job... but that's about it.What went wrong... 1)  about ambience - everyone entering the bar has to cross the restaurant - so an absolute no go for a good eating experience - a coming  and going - like a chicken house - in your  back while trying to enjoy a $250 meal! Also it's dark and loud.2) there is  a sequenz to the food; if you order an appetizer, a starter and an entree - you'd expect to get the food in this order - but not in the NoMad - the appetizer and the starter are coming at the same time 3) the portions are ridiculously small - if you have a 5-6 course menu that's ok4) if you order a dish  with white truffle - I love truffle (especially the Alba) and ate it all over the world - it should be put on your meal freshly right in front of you ... bot not in the NoMad ... but you pay $44 or plus just for the truffle 4) if you expect to get an amuse bouches - what is usual for a good dining restaurant - you will wait for ever in the NoMad... overall only thing which meets your expectations... is the very high check at the end. Ok we also had some food... NoMad will be one of those places where I go only twice - the first time and the last time. By the way the hotel was ok.",,,

The Library:For drinks with friends and romantic partners alike: nothing beats the comfortable, elegant ambiance of the NoMad Library. They have a fabulous drinks menu and, if you've managed to acquire a table, knowledgable and attentive waitstaff.

Restaurant itself is located inside the hotel and tbh the interior is to die for. Loved the sleek, black doors and decors in general. The dining room itself has a glass roof with natural lighting and tables are not too close that it's uncomfortable. Service was also prompt and professional; water glasses are never empty.Complimentary bread was super flavorful with scallions and potatoes inside. Only downside was that it was awkward to cut into, but with some elbow grease it works. The tortellini with celery root and truffle on top of a Parmesan foam was pretty amazing. The pasta skin itself was nicely cooked (Al-dente) and the richness of the truffles were balanced with the refreshing celery. Plus, the Parmesan foam was pretty cool, in terms of how molecular gastronomy works is beyond me.Signature roasted chicken was surprisingly succulent and bursting with flavors. Foie gras and truffle added to the flavor instead of overpowering it.

Price is up there but I'll never forget the foie gras chicken dish.From appetizers to the entrees, everything were simply delicious. We had a wonderful time here as their ambiance is great, the service was quite nice, and that chicken that will never be forgotten.The appetizers were seriously great. We had this seafood tower kind of thing but it was an elevated seafood dish. You can see the picture. Each had their own unique flavor to it, it's not your regular oyster, crab legs kind of seafood tower. Each had their own twist with their own sauce, and it was very refreshing to say the least. Then there was their amazing egg dish that had so much flavor put into it. You looked it the simple ingredients and then you take a bite of all the different supplements in it, and it ALL had a bunch of flavors and then when you put it altogether, it was super delicious.The lobster: Honestly the lobster was a pretty good dish. However, it was a soon to be forgotten dish when the chicken for two came. The lobster was a good dish where I'm sure we can get at other restaurants. Not saying that it wasn't good but it definitely didn't stand out like the chicken for two. The chicken for two...the most expensive chicken I probably EVER get in my lifetime(or so I think). Simply, damn, fucking amazing. It's split into two ways of being made. I believe the first part only consist of the chicken thighs while the 2nd part consist of almost the whole chicken. Even the chicken thighs were to die for honestly, I actually find myself loving it A LOT. With that said, the whole chicken was soooo good. The way they made this is that when you cut into it, between the chicken skin and the meat, there is actually FOIE GRAS in between. I would never be able to tell you HOW tasty it was but this could be a dish I could have for my last meal and I be happy. Unforgettable, I will remember that chicken dish for a long long time.Do yourself a favor and get that chicken.  P.S. Super writer's block that I finally wrote this review now.",,,

My only disappointment was how my fellow diners could prefer white meat over dark meat. Sorry pals but dark meat is best.

While we weren't exactly disappointed, we were mostly underwhelmed -- the food was sturdy, but not particularly mind blowing or memorable, and the ambiance was so-so. Service was great though.We had:- the famous chicken -- it was good, but forgettable and presented weirdly. A quarter of it is plated, and then another portion (the thighs and skin) is served almost salad style in a cocotte on the side. There was a bit too much going on, and it was hard to eat.- Some sort of carrot coleslaw that was pretty unimpressive; it tasted like shredded carrots in kewpie mayo. No thank you.- A flatbread with ramps and romanesco. This was probably the favorite of the night.All in all, it was fine, just fine, but sort of pricey for a forgettable experience. It didn't strike me as anything extraordinary. I would skip and spend your money elsewhere if you're looking for something for a special occasion.",6,2,1

The downside with the cocktail is the overwhelming amount of ice. It gelt like I finished my drinks within 4 gulps.For starters, I had the bay scallops. It's had a hint of vinegar but nonetheless it was a great starter.My colleague had the chicken for 2 (which I highly recommend) and I had the lobster salad. The salad was good, but if I can go back in time. I probably would get the chicken and eat it whole myself. The service was up to par. The waiter was nice and made sure the food and drinks were good.

Updated review","(Part 2)Personally, I had nearly ten separate meals at the NoMad Restaurant (including the room service foods, sent from this restaurant below, when I stayed the hotel room above for 3 days) in February, 2013. They were mostly complete waste of money and the dining experience. See the detailed descriptions for the each specific meal with photos below.  MEAL 5: disgusting nonedible garbhage breakfast ($55):-pancake: It was not even edible at all whatsoever. Are you insane? I asked the waiter to serve me the American style pancake, and this was what they served me. The restaurant and this waiter lied to me. This junk was nothing but uncooked gooey and tasteless slime. I had only one small scoop of this mess with the fork BUT they refuse to wave the payment. So, I just left it on the dining table. What a disgusting junk they served! Unbelievable! Shame on you, the NoMad Hotel and Restaurant there!   -two eggs sunny side up (nothing special)  -toasts: cold. Should they supposed to wrap these in a clean linen to keep them warm for serving OR put a dome cover to do the same? -salmon salad. This was OK. You can not go wrong with the fine salmon. (see my attached photograph with detailed descriptions.) MEAL 6: tasteless lobster and pumpkin cake & orange juice ($49) -lobster dish: very thin broth had almost no flavors nor tasteless. Also the tiny lobster tasted like a hospital food of salt-removed fake shrimp. It seemed the chef deliberately get rid of the flavors and taste from the lobster for absolutely unknown reasons at this restaurant. Are you insane? This was NOT even a above average good meal at all at the NoMad Restaurant. -pumpkin cake: This was one of the tiny cake delivered with other cakes on a small wheeled dining room cart (just as the Dim Sum is served at some of the fine the Chinese restaurants). The waiter hand-applied the pumpkin sauce with the butter knife and placed this cake and served the dish for my dining table. The flavor and tastes are normal, and nothing special. -orange juice: OK MEAL 7: French Foie Gras & orange juice ($46)- The French Foie Gras, served at this hotel restaurant was the normal size just as I had before in Japan and other cities but the price here, even considering the inflation rate of the money's value, way too much. The taste was good, as it was expected, because all the chef did was opening the imported package of this processed food, slicing it, and serving it on the dish with the garnish. You can not do wrong. The design and tastes of the variety of garnish came with the Foie gras were excellent, and they were textbook French dish. BY considering the very unbalance quality of dishes served here, I imagined that this specific dish was taught to this restaurant by a very different chef in the France. This was the only memorable and real ""French dish"" among my other about ten dishes I ate at the NoMad Restaurant of the NoMad Hotel in Manhattan, New York, sadly. What a waste of money, time, and resources. NOTE: French Foie gras vs. Japanese Foie gras (ankimo): The French Foie gras has been traditionally made from the grotesquely enlarged livers of ducks and geese who have been cruelly force-fed by its body tied up in a cage until it dies with too much pains and explosion of the digestive intestine. For this extreme cruelty and extremely painful deal penalty to the poor animal, not a small number of gourmet people, after enjoying it once, stop eating it ever again, unless you are a French. This was what I was actually told by the French businessman at an international meeting. On the other hand, the Japanese Foie gras is naturally created within the body of the monkfish (""ankou"") at the deep ocean floor. The word to address the Japanese Foie gras is 'ankimo"", which is a made-up word of ""an"" (ankou) and ""kimo"" (liver). Once removed from the fish, it is wasjed with the rice wine and steamed, and then sliced and eaten. The Japanese Hoie gras (ankimo) is very common and popular appetizers served at Japanese resatuirant, and this is because the monkfish is a common fish (and it is enjoyed especially winter in the speciAl hot pot called ""ankou nabe"" in Japan.          Anyway, after eating this French Foie gras (all they did at the restaurant was sliced and served the completely finished product in the package), I feel like I do not have to eat another French Foie gras or any French dishes ever again here in NYC. I was so dissapointed and angry for the truly disgusting meals at the NoMad Restaurant. What they are doing at this restaurant were so disrespectable and insulting to the food ingredients, the high quality heritage of French foods, and the very paying customers. Shame on you, the NoMad Restaurant!  I will NOT recommend the NoMad Restaurant to my friends at all whatsoever.Dr. Takeshi Yamada and Seara (Coney island sea rabbit) Review: August 16, 2017Photos: February 2013",34,33,32

81,Maria G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,80,32,4.0,10/26/2018,"Absolutely stellar from start to finish! Greeted warmly, service was friendly, professional & seamless. Presentation was lovely. The dining room is quite dark & the tables are on top of each other but the soaring glass ceiling keeps it from feeling claustrophobic. Cocktail list was quite extensive & we were very happy with our ""18th Parallels."" They are one of the few Manhattan restaurants that still serves bread which these carbaholics appreciated! The salted butter that accompanied the bread was outrageous! Started with the parsnip agnolotti which I was a bit concerned with since I'm not a fan of parsnips but the flavor was very subtle. We also had the roasted kombucha squash and shared the black bass with mixed mushrooms and a luscious cream sauce. The grand finale was a chocolate dessert which was the only slight miss to me. The house blend coffee was perfect. They are known for a house chicken dish made with truffles & foie gras which looked incredible, even to this vegetarian . After dinner, we moved to the bar for a nightcap. It was a wonderfully special evening and I look forward to returning soon!",,,

Not because the service was poor, but because I had expected so much from the Nomad after waiting for a good chance to go after living here for 4 years. Everything we ordered was mediocre and I wasn't left wanting more of anything. It's a good place to try out with a decent wine menu but don't come here with high expectations. Next time I'm craving a Nomad establishment, I'll definitely be going back to my usual spot around the corner at Izakaya Nomad instead.",,,
85,Ellen L.,"Spokane, WA",1,5,22,5.0,2/10/2018,"We came here for dinner. We entered the hotel by accident through a back entrance to the bar. It was hopping, crowded and noisy with standing room only. We told one of the hosts we had reservations for dinner and he immediately dropped what he was doing and kindly escorted us through the maze of the hotel to the lobby and restaurant. The dinner was one of the best I have ever experienced. The service and staff harken back to an old fashioned etiquette where your chair is pulled back for you when you are seated, your napkin is refolded if you leave the table, your wine glass is primed, and a train of waiters will bring your food out at the exact same time. I was a little embarrassed that we were underdressed for the restaurant, as other people were dressed pretty formally, but I didn't sense an ounce of judgement from the staff. We were treated like Kings. We started with the radishes. The dish was so simple. The most pristine and perfect little radishes were coated in an amazing butter (that had the consistency of white chocolate) and fleur de sel. We had the tagliatelle with King Crab. The dish was simple and rich with pepper, Meyer lemon and sweet crab. The flavors melted in the mouth perfectly. The restaurant is famous for their chicken for two. The dish lived up to the expectations. The stuffed chicken is brought tableside in a sizzling cast iron dish, presented with pomp and circumstance as they explain (in a performance worthy of Portlandia minus the hipster vibe) how it is prepared (under the decadent breast skin is a combination of fois gras and truffle) and then whisked back to the kitchen to be carved and served. The dark meat is put into a pot with an obscene amount of cream and a brûlée crackling of salty chicken skin.We finished with the milk and honey dessert which was incredibly delicious. Overall it was a great experience and I can't wait for our next trip to New York so we can eat here again.",2,1,2
86,Jay G.,"Pompano Beach, FL",5,271,163,4.0,5/7/2018,"This was my 2nd visit to The Nomad and while I had the chicken the first time, I found the truffle and brioche under the skin not my liking. We came back to try other foods.  Wow!  Had the halibut which was amazing!  Also the scallops were equally as beautiful and well prepared. I would have given it 5 stars but the tables are small and the restaurant a bit noisy.  Great wine list also.",,,
87,Lina F.,"South Slope, Brooklyn, NY",154,304,538,4.0,2/9/2017,"This was by far the best meal I had in months!  You don't normally expect this caliber of cooking at restaurant inside of a hotel, but I think it is the area.  If I remember correctly the Ace Hotel around the corner has a restaurant and it is pretty decent.We settled down for cocktails in a room that looks more like a sitting room rather than a restaurant.  The bar is further behind us and that itself is a scene.  The restaurant serves a variety of drinks and the server was super accommodating when I wanted one of their virgin drinks with alcohol.  I can't remember which one - one with yogurt in it A delicious!  We had the fluke to start and the chicken! Hands down the best decision.  The table next to us order two entrees which looks really boring - one beef and another lobster?We ordered milk and honey for dessert and it was so worth it!",1,1,2
88,Lisa L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",363,60,636,4.0,3/25/2017,"Classy and delicious, The NoMad pretty much does everything right. I went with my two girlfriends for a birthday dinner, and it is very appropriate for a nice gno or a date night. The dim lighting definitely does give off a more romantic vibe, so to all the men out there looking for a place to take out their gals, I highly recommend this place! Between the three of us, we ordered one ""snack"", one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert. Snack - Black Truffle: YUM. You know a restaurant is worth 5 stars when the truffles are done right. Not too strong, but not too unnoticeable either, the balance between creme fraiche, mascarpone, and the truffle was perfect. The portion wasn't the biggest, so after we finished a tarte each, we were craving for more.Appetizer - Rigatoni: It was pretty good, but not mind blowing! We just wanted to have a pasta dish in our combination of orders, so we went for it, but I do think that The NoMad does meat, fish, ""delicacies"" better than pasta. You can always save your appetite for delicious pasta at a nice Italian restaurant, so this would not be the first thing I recommend from here. Entree - Chicken: (whole roasted for two) - Now THIS is what made my experience at The NoMad one to remember. Before they cook the chicken, they literally bring out the entire chicken nicely decorated/plated to show you what's going in your stomach. Then, they bring out the chicken cooked/sliced so that it's easier to eat. Initially I was wondering why just a chicken is worth close to $90, and to be honest, I think $90 is slightly overpriced (it's not even like nice steak or anything, it'll definitely be the most expensive chicken I will have had in the future). The entire concoction, however, of the foie gras, black truffle, and other flavorful sides make the dish worth it. Dessert - Milk and Honey: Ugh SO GOOD! I think this is The NoMad's most popular dessert, and I totally get why. The whole milk+cereal tasting ice cream seems to be the trend nowadays, and you can find a lot of milk flavored ice cream these days. BUT this one was pretty fantastic, I just wish it wasn't $16. Overall, it was a really memorable fine dining experience because of delicious food, excellent service, and great ambiance. It was pretty pricey so do expect your bill to be at least $80-100, and I would recommend it for a special occasion.",,,

The food is french and fancy so you know as usual I got the duck. Ugh i just wish  I could marry this duck that's how good it was. This is a place for those sophisticated palettes I must admit.

98,Allie K.,"Los Altos, CA",1,86,24,2.0,7/6/2017,DO NOT GO DURING SUMMER. This normally five star restaurant receives two this time around for an remarkably ill conceived summer menu. Each dish tasted progressively worse. Flavor profiles were uniformly sweet (the incredibly cheap tasting baby corn and basil granola  concoction) or salty (strangely textured crookneck squash with unpleasant steamed squash accoutrements). Lobster was over salted and swimming in an odd minestrone broth. Only the toaster artichokes had the right acid profile (strawberry salad was entirely forgettable and had an errant piece of feta) though the accompanying gnocchi were plump they again tasted cheap. I'll come back for the fall/ spring menus. Bring back the balance and creatively.,1,1,

For entree, I got the mushroom and it was insanely delicious.  The texture of wild mushrooms and egg yolk blended so well. For dessert I really loved the milk & honey and coconut that my girlfriends ordered.The best of all, the service was impeccable and attentive. The hostesses had great hospitality. Before we started ordering, the waitress inquired if any of us had allergy. One of my girlfriends had a variety of allergy complications,  and the waitress took careful notes. They even served special bread starter to accommodate my girlfriends allergies.

The vegetables that came with it were more like garnish than side dishes, but I don't remember any side dish vegetables on the menu. Peach cobbler ($16) was mostly bread.We brought a 9- year-old with us and she didn't order a salad so they kept her waiting for about 45 minutes before giving her anything other than bread.Nice dining room and good music selection. Not too loud. When a light dinner with one glass of wine, tax, and tip costs $100+ the standards have to go up. Hence the three stars.",,,

Ended up getting the chicken for two both times - yes, it's that good, despite the fact that I'm almost sure they throw out like 80% of the bird for presentation purposes. Just let me gnaw on the carcass, dang it. Love that they have different preparations for the white and dark meat.Cocktails are really strong and well-mixed. Can't go wrong with anything on (or off) the menu. My friend got an extra dirty martini, which she loved.Service at the bar is, of course, not as good as at the table. Speaking of which, the bar is insanely crowded after work (to be expected), but you can order a drink and take it to the hotel lobby, which is much more pleasant and has seating.Get the Milk & Honey for dessert! Years later, that dish still stands out in my mind as being fantastic.",,,
111,Ashley C.,"Chicago, IL",11,511,111,5.0,11/14/2016,Awesome brunch and cocktail bar! Loved the ambience. The dark wood and dim lighting make it like an oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city.  We sat at the bar and service was excellent. The bartender was knowledgeable and friendly.The food was also very good. The fried chicken and fries ($26) were nicely seasoned and cooked. The chicken was juicy and nailed the tricky breading ratio. It was also a generous portion. Excellent cocktails. I had the Nod to Nothing cocktail ($16) based on the recommendation of the bartender. I asked for something light and refreshing and this Gin-based cocktail was spot on.  My husband also said that their Old Fashioned was one of the best ones he has had. We will definitely make sure to come back. (I totally get why this is on numerous best bars/cocktail lists).,1,1,1

I wasn't impressed with the bread they served but the fruits de mer appetizer was quite good. The star of the show was definitely the roast chicken for two. They've magically brought chicken breast into fine dining.General: The decor and ambiance are awesome... high ceilings, lamps that provide mood lighting, a library area to sit in, and etc. As expected of a place like this, the waitstaff are top notch and cater to you.Food: The bread they bring you is tasty but unimpressive... especially for anyone who's eaten scallion pancakes before hah.Fruits de mer: A platter of various seafood gems! I did find that my oyster had a little too much vinegar but everything else was delicious. The scallops and hamachi were dressed nicely but the uni panna cotta was definitely the best part. Roast chicken for two: Incredible! The foie gras and truffle complemented the roast chicken breast really well. Each bite melts in your mouth. The skin was nice and crispy while the breast is extremely tender. Dark meat is carved from the chicken and made into a salad for you as well. I did find they oversalted the dark meat portion though.Great experience here but when your paying top dollar, the bread could be a little more creative and no part of the meal should be overly salty.",1,,

118,Bryant R.,"Manhattan, NY",101,518,0,1.0,4/29/2017,"This place is a gimmick.  Cheap quality, bad food at every level.  Will never return. Decidedly terrible food at this price point and considerable attitude. With tip, wine bottle, one alcoholic drink, and food for one vegetarian (two vegetarian dishes were $24 and $28, respectively) and one carnivore with a 20% tip this about a $300 ticket. At nearly $300 for two people, the joke is on the diner.*****They made us wait 20 minutes for our table, despite the fact that the dining room might have been 40% occupied when we walked in.*****The wait seems deliberate.  Perhaps they want to sell overpriced drinks at the bar while you wait, they want to appear exclusive, or perhaps both?Arrived about five minutes early for an early reservation (the place was empty). Hostess suggested getting a drink at the bar. I asked if the table was ready and she gave a curt reply that perhaps we would prefer otherwise to wait in the lobby. 15 minutes after the reservation was supposed to have been I ask if we should expect to be collected from the bar. She again gives a curt yes. 5 minutes later they escort us to a half empty dining room to our table. After a 17 dollar 2/3 pour martini and a $3.50 spray seltzer with generous helping of ice. Chacuterie was good but I could get four times as much for a higher quality at the same price at Murray's cheese.Killer was, waiter offered, I did not ask, more bread for this small chacuterie plate: never got it. For $41,  the suckling pig was warm at best. A couple minutes into it, it was cold. Not very good  I think that we can all agree that a $41 entree should be pretty good.The $95 wine suggested by the sommelier was fine.",2,1,

Our meal was perfectly timed and our waiter was so wonderful.  Everything he said to us spilled so eloquently from his mouth, I just nodded in amazement. The vibe in the restaurant is really cool and the setting is beautiful.  We were in a nook of a room with plush seating and a (non working) fire place.  So it was like dining at home with your friends, relaxed and refined.  Can't wait to go back.",1,,

I have eaten at some outstanding restaurants on several continents but never have I had such an incredible dining experience. First of all, the usual experience is that a meal will have several exceptional dishes, some very good dishes, and some dishes that you might forget. Not so at NoMad. Every dish from beginning to end was incredibly delicious. The taste of the food reflects the attitude that what leaves the kitchen must be at its peak. The service is perfect, never fawning nor inattentive, but rather gracious, friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. The sommelier helped me pick out some delicious wines that complimented the courses and again, he was friendly, knowledgeable ... you get the picture. The setting is outstanding, but it is the staff and the food that shine the brightest. I will return.",,,

It has a glasshouse roof, so the dining room is bathed in natural light and you could see the raindrops pitter patter.I ordered the infamous chicken truffle sandwich. It was in a challah that's almost a footlong, and the tender (it must be cooked sous vide!) chicken breast was slathered in a salty truffle butter with celery leaves to cut through the richness and provide some crunch. It was really delicious. The challah bun was perfectly toasted yet fluffy inside. My one complaint was that the butter was way too salty, and made certain bites unpalatable.The chicken sandwich also came with a salad tossed with crispy chicken skin. That was on point as well.I would highly recommend coming here and checking out what else they have to offer.",,,

125,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",262,1056,2509,4.0,8/13/2016,"I was only in the city one night for business. We were at this hotel per my CEO's request; it was close to the studio we needed to visit the next morning, and had a decent price on a suite for her.The check-in process was quick and easy, and they told me that they'd upgraded my room for free. Yay! I actually loved the look and feel of this hotel. It was very old-New York, old-style, which I adore. Lots of dark paneling, lots of creaky wood floors. That doesn't sound very impressive, but hopefully it makes sense if you look at my pictures. My room was just so cute. I walked in (beware - the doors are very heavy. I had to put my shoulder to them get them to open), and let out an audible, ""Aww!"" The room is very charming - the windows, the wood floors, the dark walls - it just all worked out so well.Upon entering, there was a door on the left (water closet, as it turned out), and a small cabinet on the right (mini bar). The main living area was right ahead, with a closet closest to the door, and the shower and sink around the other side. The windows were large and let in a lot of great light. The bed was very comfortable. I was able to set up on it to work for a bit (I didn't feel like sitting at the desk at that moment), and after returning from a night on the town, it was nice to sink into the fluffy blankets and soft pillows. And, they offer free Wi-Fi!Bonus points for the staff. The manager was able to take me up to the Penthouse for a quick tour, as my CEO is thinking of renting the space. She gave me a rundown on how the space is laid out, which rooms are available, and what we could expect for a party of a certain size.In addition, we had originally requested a late check-out for both rooms. They were booked to capacity, and unable to accommodate when we asked, but the next morning, when I went down to ask them again, they were able to give us late check-out for one room (which was really all we needed), even though I got the feeling it was tight for them. The doormen were so friendly and helpful, and, at the end of our stay, followed my CEO and me out to the corner in search of the car that was supposed to come pick her up. He stayed with her until the car came, even after I hailed a taxi and headed off the JFK for my flight home. I mention this because she was alone on the corner with two large suitcases and two large shoulder bags. I appreciate that he didn't just abandon her to manage those and her phone on her own (especially as I had just abandoned her!)",1,,2
126,Mike B.,"Washington, DC",24,136,508,5.0,9/4/2016,"The restaurant here had been on my list for a while. We were passing through the neighborhood recently and managed to finagle a table. The decor is quite impressive, evoking a bygone age when conspicuous wealth was more closely wedded to taste. The suckling pig was an extraordinary dish, with delicious pork layered under crispy skin. The plum went very well with the pig, and was bold choice in the face of tradition which demands the paring pig with apple. It is rare that I am moved to comment on the aesthetics of a dish, but the pig was beautifully presented. Their cocktails are lovingly crafted and inventive. I'm a beer guy, but I don't at all regret getting one of their signature drinks, instead of a brew. The lasagna eggplant dish was very thinly layered and served with a savory foam. The eggplant had a smokey quality which displeased my SO.",1,,

Updated review","The NoMad is, without a doubt, one of my favorite restaurants in New York. I've been for both dinner and lunch this year and was impressed with both. The only thing that can be improved is their service, which I find slow, no matter the time of day. My most recent lunch started with the butter lettuce salad that exploded with flavor. It had pine nuts, snap peas, and croutons and was so fresh. I didn't love the newest take on carrots with rye bread as I found them overdressed. The chicken burger was sinfully rich but fantastic and the mushroom tart was earthy, on a paper thin crust with ricotta, quail egg and salsa verde. Their complimentary bread is moist and soft with caramelized shallots and a bit of rosemary. Atmosphere is marvelous and makes me feel like I am in Paris. This should absolutely be on your itinerary if you have a few days in the city.",25,12,19
129,Andrew M.,"New York, NY",9,24,1,2.0,2/17/2017,"We were pretty excited when we walked in. First night out in two months since having a baby! Drinks came slowly, cocktail was fine but the wine was whatever and the food was a joke. It wasn't bad. But in the end we looked at our entrees and remembered our appetizers and thought, why didn't we spend $190 on our baby instead of four carrots and a thick slice of celery root? See photo. They tell you they're special carrots but we get better ones from our CSA. Service was friendly. I'm hungry now in the cab but wasn't about to give this place more money. If you were an actual nomad you'd find more food (and better) in the desert. Especially if you're a vegetarian.",3,4,1

133,D. L. J.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,100,541,4.0,9/17/2017,"Nestled in a set of cozy rooms beyond the lobby of The NoMad Hotel, this one Michelin star venue delivers consistently executed food in an approachable environment. It is a very comfortable place to hang out with friends or have a date. The food truly is the star here, worth a detour to experience, well-balanced and interesting flavors.  I believe other aspects of the experience could use some tweaking. Versus its competitors I find the wine list more of a trophy collection and lacking a breadth of quality options across ALL price ranges. Service, though friendly, was not always firing on all cylinders. A solid choice and worthy of a try.Atmosphere- Cozy and intimate setting, with dark wood panels and classic, perhaps old English, accents.- Two tops are still individual tables which are spaced apart a bit more than typical in NYC. Comfortable chairs.- Very dimly lit, we accidently blew out the little candle on our table and it was perceptibly darker.  Expect a lot of iPhone flashlights/flashes.-Listed as 'dressy' or 'casual elegant' but on weekend nights, we have always seen a range from t-shirts/shorts all the way to suits/sport coats.FoodWe were quite pleased with our selections overall, all of which reflected the season and were of high quality. Normally, the house bread is not worth mentioning, but the NoMad's potato and dill concoction is quite unique and enjoyable in its own right. The Foie Gras (Torchon Smoked with Apple, Sunflower Seeds and Fall Spices - $30)  had a flavor profile  that was so well balanced, and portioned excellently so as not to be overly decadent.  I enjoyed topping the included apple rolls with the foie and it's various accompaniments.  When combined, it quite literally tasted like fall. My wife also enjoyed her Prawn (Fritters with Scallop Mousse, Tarragon and Paprika - $20).  For mains, we had the nicely rendered Duck (Roasted with Fennel, Peach and Juniper - $38) which was moist and cooked superbly.  The Suckling Pig (Confit with Seckel Pears, Chicory and Pancetta - $41) is a must order, moist confit (almost like pulled pork) topped with a crispy layer of pancetta.  Both proteins were cooked absolutely masterfully.  For dessert, we are addicted to the Milk & Honey (Shortbread, Brittle & Ice Cream - $16) another classic of The NoMad.  The Pear Cobbler (Pear Ice Cream and Cider Granita - $16) was enjoyable, though perhaps not as memorable.  The cobbler was almost like a very light and airy 'monkey bread' topped with cinnamon crumble.BeverageMany cocktails available at The NoMad Bar are also available in the restaurant and/or Elephant Bar where we were sent to wait while our table was being prepared.  My wife and I enjoyed our Summer of Yes! (Berliner Weissbier, Elderflower Liqueur, Rhubarb, Lemon, Jalapeno Agave, Cucumber - $15) as a refreshing aperitif, the rhubarb was awesome.With dinner we ordered a bottle of the 2015 Alain Graillot Crozes-Hermitage ($80), which is also available by the glass ($25). It had nice aromas, though was still quite tannic and seemed too young to fully enjoy.  I wish the wine list had more breadth and depth in the sub-$150 price range.  It is heavily biased toward Rieslings and rather pricey French options (many/most? four figures), that just don't seem to fit with the casual vibe.  As an example, there are 12 California Cabs: 1x $120, 3x $600-750, 8x $950+. Doing it again, I would have ordered the 2015 Tyler Pinot Noir ($80) from Central Coast, CA which we enjoyed previously.Service- Friendly, though uneven.  Some lags throughout...getting bread, getting check, etc.- Wine director was very nice and interactive.- Staff seemed utterly mystified by our request for bread plates.  Bread was brought on a wooden board with no accompanying plates. It took three staff before we finally got anything and they seemed baffled/put out about it.",1,,1
134,Ashvin R.,"Big Stone Gap, VA",0,15,49,4.0,1/1/2018,"What I'm measuring it against: Moderately priced fine-dining restaurants in major cities.So this is Daniel Humm's much more accessible restaurant and bar--the bar has recently achieved global recognition, and its ""chicken for two"" has been famous for a while. Atmosphere...this is one of the most beautiful restaurants you'll see in any city. Darker tones like that you'd find in an Ivy League professor's study--maroons, forest greens, deep turquoise and deep woods are the colors complimented well by dim lighting. It's a large space with smaller compartments (you will see different ""rooms"" listed on the website). My guest and I were seated in the room that had a fire place (can't remember the name, but I had requested it in the reservation). I feel that was the ideal location--the rest of the place can be quite noisy because it's so popular. The bar area is also beautiful, but since the place is so popular, the beauty and intimacy is lost by the crowd and the noise...bah...Service...Perfect, no complaints. Before calling for the reservation, my concern was that I would only be able to make general reservation and not get the specific fireplace room I wanted. There were no issues however...the hostess over the phone described to me what each room was like in terms of lighting and noise level, and she assured me that my specific request would be granted. Keep in mind that I called 30 days from the intended date, which is the furthest out you can make a reservation. Food...We got wine by the glass, a round of cocktails and the ""chicken for two""--a whole roasted chicken stuffed with foie gras that mostly lived up to the hype. From the original chicken, they take the dark meat and make a glorified ""chicken pot pie filling type thing"" as a side. While good and filling, the side could have been made with more flavor such as thyme and other such things. This is a small complaint, though.    So should you come here on your next trip to NYC? Sure, why not. It's tough to judge a restaurant in a city where the options seem endless, and you do feel you're in a special place when you're here, so why not come? I did give it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons--the chicken filling was decent but not great, and also because there are so many similar priced restaurants in NYC that are slightly better. Plus, my dinner the night before was at Le Bernadin, so that might make for a fair review of the NoMad either.",,,
135,Eve C.,"Manhattan, NY",343,856,805,5.0,8/14/2017,The food is excellent and the service goes beyond. They are attentive but not hovering over you.

137,Jasmine N.,"Benicia, CA",227,32,48,5.0,11/13/2017,"Enjoyed a romantic dinner here. I loved the attention to detail. I recommend making reservations. I must say the service was excellent- our waitress was Alex. Anica and Lindsey were also helpful in making our celebration dinner very special. Ask about the sherry flip cocktail! It's worth ordering for the presentation alone. It comes with an eggshell shooter and a second drink to wash it down- you can't miss it! If you order the prawn fritters, they come with a tasty sauce that you may also enjoy with your flatbread. For appetizers, we ordered the foie gras and radicchio. The radicchio was beautiful, but the foie gras was delectable and easily my favorite part of the meal. For our main dish, we ordered the lobster and duck. I personally preferred the lobster. The duck was good, but next time I would also like to try the beef dish. Finally, for dessert we had the classic milk and honey, which was very good.If you are not a guest at the hotel, I recommend checking out the library lounge in the daytime. It is reserved for hotel guests at night.Our birthday celebration dinner was truly an amazing experience, and I hope to return soon. Thank you NoMad!",,,

Updated review",Okay so was thrilled to be staying here and also got reservations for dinner too. The restaurant was very busy and bar completely filled. We started with a couple specialty drinks mixed at the bar while waiting for our table. Two top was sort of small near fireplace. We ordered the chicken for two and it was stunning and there wasn't anything left at the end of dinner. We did have dessert but I didn't love as I was full from dinner. Wine list extensive and something for everyone.Nomad is a special treat and you payFor it too. Bill topped out at over $400 for two. It was a lot of food and more than we eat in two meals at home.

139,Mutsuki J.,"Manhattan, NY",11,22,0,2.0,11/25/2017,"My boyfriend and I went there for Thanksgiving dinner and we were excited about dining there as it is a well-established restaurant. However, it turned out to be a huge disappointment. - Service: We had a reservation at 7:30 pm and we showed up on time. After checking in, the girl told us to wait at the bar for a few minutes and she would then guide us to table. We were waiting at the bar for AN HOUR until my boyfriend went to find her. We were told that our table was mistakenly given to other people, and she totally forgot us! They offered free drinks to compensate their mistake, but overall it came as a big disappointment considering the reputation and quality of the NoMad restaurant. - food quality: for Thanksgiving dinner, the restaurant offered prix fixe menu for about $155/person. But, the quality of food does not match the price it charges. The taste was ok but as normal as what other American restaurants can offer. The dessert part, the waiter just pushed a cart with a couple of choices of deserts around in the dining hall, which gave me the feeling of the ""cheap"", as it was not carefully prepared for a holiday dinner.

The selections didn't live up to the standard that the rest of the meal set. And the Dehydrated Milk & Honey was kind of forgettable.However, everything else was fantastic. It's one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. The fruits de mer were inspiring, and delicious.

You have access to speakeasy quality cocktails at a Michelin restaurant. I got the brandy and fig one with the big ice cube, it was to die for. As far as appetizers, they have some great vegan ones. The carrot tartar was unbelievable. Creamy and went so well with the thin bread crisps that accompany it. Radish and butter appetizer was interesting, I probably wouldn't order it twice though. It's literally radish with butter, and grainy salt on the side. The venue is very classy, high energy, and of course the glass ceiling! Definitely a cool fun vibe and great date place. You can precede or follow up with dinner at the lively bar at the back. 5-stars!",,,

Wasn't upset waiting in the bar for 50 minutes after our reservation time. Was pleased with the appetizers. Anxious for the famous chicken - never more disappointed in a meal in my 30 years in NYC. Dry chicken breast and nasty sauce. A couple cocktails, 2 appetizers, a chicken for 2 and 1 poached lobster tail = $540 plus $100 tip (after all it's not the server's fault) Feeling abused and sad in my own neighborhood.

I let them know in advance that this was our engagement dinner, and the Maitre D Lindsey went out of her way to make the evening extra special for us. I was really appreciative of what they were able to do, the table they seated us at, and just the whole experience in general.

I was surprised to see poor reviews for service, because there were wait staff everywhere and 3 different servers attended to us. The drink menu was extensive and excellent. There are pages of cocktails, and the wine list, by glass or bottle, was impressive.I had a bloody mary with beets, chili peppers and sherry - quite a combo, which was hearty, spicy and a little sweet. We started with oysters and then I had the short rib hash. The hash was fairly excellent. The short rib was tender and topped with greens and a poached egg. The only thing that surprised us was the attire of most of the patrons. In pics online it looked like most people wore a jacket. We found most people were fairly casual, many wearing jeans and t-shirts. This was not totally surprising considering the restaurant is part of a hotel and we were there for brunch on an 80 degree day.",,,2

I have come here many times over the years, for special occasions as well as after work snacks and drinks. Amazing food, great wine and a fun atmosphere. The chicken for two is a great signature dish and some of the best chicken around. I'm also a huge fan of the radishes (once ordered around 15 orders of them to celebrate a business deal) and the cocktails are amazing (my favourite is the English Heat, which is no longer on the menu, and in the winter the Eggnog is not to be missed). Also great for weekend brunch - try the Bloody bull with your meal. Amazing staff who remember you when you come back. Truly a special place!",,,

Updated review","I've been fortunate to visit here a few more times after my first review a little over three years ago, and I can attest, this place is still as good as it gets. Prices are as reasonable as it gets. Whether it be for lunch, brunch or dinner, the food quality and composition of dishes has not changed and service is still top notch. Classic dishes remain while seasonal dishes are shuffled in the mix. If you're lucky, a few chef celebs are seated at the table next to yours!",2,,2

Inside, yet you feel like you're dining in an outdoor garden. The service was impeccable as well. I started with the radishes butter-dipped with fleur de sel which were to die for. For my entree I had the rigatoni with braised oxtail, horseradish, and beets. An interesting combination, but it was very good. My only qualm was that the rigatoni was slightly under cooked. Another minute and it would have been a perfect al dente. The dessert cart was stationed right next to me during the entire meal so I had to try dessert. I chose the sweet potato tarte which had a bit of meringue and I could have easily had a second it was so good! I am anxious to try their cocktail bar next door next time I am in town!",,,

One of the best experiences I've had dining in NY. Food was exceptional as well; we ordered the burger ( amazing) and the baby back ribs.

153,Wendy L.,"New York, NY",277,462,562,4.0,1/16/2017,"The Nomad Restaurant is your definition of high end brunch, where the ceilings are high and the way the waiters / waitresses roam around resembles the movements of a movie scene. Besides the semi cramped, squeeze as many tables into the space, there's no complaints on the Nomad's beauty. Prices absolutely reflect the environment - it's by no means a cheap brunch. $26 for a chicken sandwich (comes with a side salad with crispy chicken skins), $20 for a burger, and $10 for a side of fries because you can't have a sandwich / burger without fries! Yes, it's a little bizarre (maybe more than a little bizarre) to pay $26 for JUST a chicken sandwich, but the hype for this chicken sandwich is so real. It legitimately was the best chicken sandwich I've had in my life. This chicken wasn't fried either AND it was the breast! It was so delicately cooked, maintaining the juiciness that a chicken breast always lacks. Combine that with a large, massive soft buttery brioche bread (think semi foot long large), black truffle, and foie gras and you have the chicken sandwich that you would have never dreamed of. The ingredients semi justifies the price tag right? I've read how the sandwich can feed two - unless you have a tiny stomach, one person can definitely finish the sandwich alone. Highly recommend you eat the entire thing all at once, while it's hot. Its magic wears off a bit when it sits. The salad that came with the sandwich was good as well. I enjoyed the dressing and the texture of the crispy chicken skins - I wish the skin pieces were larger though instead of being crumbs. The burger was a good burger - it's another one of those pure beef burgers that isn't overshadowed by sauce. Just a beef patty, some cheese, and lots of grilled red onions. Was it the best beef burger I've had? No, I'd award that to Upland. They don't ask you how you'd like your burger cooked, but it came out at a perfect medium rare. The fries were magnificent. For $10, you get a generous portion. Perfectly salty and fried with rosemary. Yum! It was seasoned so perfectly that you didn't even need the ketchup and mayo that accompanied the fries. Make sure you get an order! Every table had one, along with the chicken sandwich. Service here is impeccable as well. It's not one of those popular snobby spots that make you wait for your entire party to arrive before you're able to be seated - LOVE this. My boyfriend was running late and by no means did I ever feel uncomfortable / felt rushed as I sat at my table waiting for him. Also, because we were celebrating our anniversary, they bought out a complimentary plate of their house baked pastries (I was told the pastry cart changes every day based on whatever mood the chef is in that day). We received a banana bread and two baked custard things (not sure what it was exactly, but I was told it was baked at it really really high temperature that the outside caramelizes). Of the two I enjoyed the banana bread more as the inside was so soft and the outside was crispy - the outside was what my boyfriend and I enjoyed the most! My boyfriend preferred the custard like pastry better as he thought it was more unique.  It's a small and popular spot, where people linger, so make sure you make reservations! It's simple and you don't have to make it weeks in advance. The chicken sandwich for sure is a bucket list item that you have to try at least once!",2,1,1

155,Patricia C.,"Manhattan, NY",133,255,1297,4.0,1/26/2016,"Came here for the 2nd time for the boyfriend's birthday last night (our original reservation was for the day of the blizzard, but they easily moved our reservation to two days later), couldn't wait to see if the restaurant was as good as I remember it to be! My first visit was around when it first opened with my family, and I remember loving the food.During the winter, they have a lot of wind-breaking doors near the entrance, so just keep trudging through until you get to a nice classy lounge with armchairs. Towards the right, you will see the host table. We were seated pretty promptly in the main dining room under the atrium. Our reservation was for 6:15pm and the dining room was pretty empty, but I kinda enjoyed that :). Here's what we ordered:COMPLIMENTARY BREADI have been raving to my boyfriend about this for as long as I can remember. I think it was better the first time I had it (I remember it having a lot of zucchini in it), but it was still damn delicious!!! The texture is just so amazing (what asians like to label ""Q"", kind of like the texture of a good mix between bread and mochi), and the onion flavors are YUMMMMMMMM. Not sure if they keep refilling you with bread since we didn't eat it all up to save space for the real food, but they sure used to!START ME UP $16BOURBON, RUM, STREGA, HONEY, GINGER, LEMON, ORANGE BITTERSOne of the best bourbon cocktails I've ever had! I usually hate drinks that consist primarily of the alcohol (I like mixers like soda, fruit juices, etc haha), but this one was great! It also had an interesting aftertaste that I liked, may have come from the strega.FLUKE $24CURED WITH SEA URCHIN, FENNEL & BLOOD ORANGEI guess we should have read the description more carefully, but this is one appetizer I really didn't like. The fluke was cured, which gave it this gummy taste. It also had blood orange all over it, causing the fluke to taste kind of like a fruit gummy. I would have preferred some type of fresh crudo-like dish. Even the sea urchin tasted kind of strange - like someone had pumped a bunch of air into it. Not sure how else to describe it...There was an awesome crunchy component on this dish though, my best guess would be deep fried fish scales!!!TAGLIATELLE $24WITH KING CRAB, MEYER LEMON & BLACK PEPPERSo. Freakin. Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could eat 10 portions of this by myself. The meyer lemon was just an exquisite pairing to this tagliatelle and made it so fresh! Probably one of the most acidic pastas I've ever had, but creamy pastas have a tendency of getting too heavy, so I was thankful for the lemon that cut that immediately. I was also expecting a super small twirl of it, but this was actually a decent portion. Crab was also cooked perfectly.CHICKEN $89WHOLE-ROASTED FOR TWO: FOIE GRAS, BLACK TRUFFLE & BRIOCHE ACCOMPANIED BY CAULIFLOWER, LENTILS & CURRANTSNeed I say more about this dish? Get it! It's slightly too much food for two people I feel, especially after appetizers, and their complimentary bread, but get it wrapped up, I'm sure it makes for amazing leftovers. How do they get chicken breast to taste so tender and moist (I HATE chicken breast usually)?! Insane...The foie gras and black truffle are obviously also amazing, right under the skin (reminds me of a beef wellington!). The main dish is the chicken breast, but they also give you two mini castirons of the chicken thigh.MILK & HONEY $15SHORTBREAD, BRITTLE & ICE CREAMA little too sweet for my liking, but the crumble was delicious :) The dessert is also so pretty to look at!!!Although pricey, I feel like it was well worth it (though at times, with the money I'm spending, I wish I had a tasting menu experience); service is also pretty attentive! One thing though - when my reservation got changed, I don't think they managed to move the remark that it was my boyfriend's birthday, so no candle was put on the dessert when it came out :( a slight damper to the night, but all in all, a pretty great meal!",7,1,2

I ordered a French 75, which was made perfectly. My friend ordered off the whiskey list, which is divided into regions (#teamIslay). Her whiskey arrived with a proper whiskey cube. We ordered fries and the coconut/passionfruit cheesecake (yes, at the same time, because we are adults and it's what we wanted). The cheesecake was great -- shortbread sticks on the side and a lovely flavor. It's cheesecake-in-a-jar, so if you want a super rich cheesecake bite, this isn't it. We loved it, though. The fries were perfect. Thin, crispy, with fried parsley and basil on top. And a great dipping sauce. Can't wait to order them again.",,,
157,Lisa C.,"New York, NY",236,268,129,5.0,2/21/2016,"I am soooo happy to finally cross this restaurant off my severely long bucket list of food indulgences. I initially thought I was coming here for Valentine's weekend which would have made me swoon but the reservation was made for the following week instead. GRUMBLE GRUMBLE- patiently waited for another week. We had an early 5:30PM reservation so the restaurant was pretty empty when I arrived. I was a little surprised to see that the Nomad Library bar was in the back of the restaurant. So the noise level was a bit loud during parts of the evening. But back to the experience.The service was first class. They asked if we had any dining allergies to anything before we began the meal. Great touch since my date has a severe peanut allergy- nuts, oils, everything. I was disappointed to see that they didn't have the tagliatelle on the menu anymore. POOEY. Ordered the tuna tartare instead which was delicious. The main star of the night was definitely the roasted chicken for two which was stuffed with foie gras and black truffle butter under the skin. OMG- that was the best chicken I've ever had in my life. They bring it out to you whole for show and then they bring it back to the kitchen to let it rest and carve for you. The chicken breast was sooo succulent and the skin had that nice crisp. Just thinking about it makes my stomach rumble now. They also prep the dark meat for you in a different manner but the white meat is definitely the star. I can not wait to return and usually I don't try the same dishes twice but this chicken will never get old.",3,,
158,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",319,153,821,4.0,12/30/2016,"The NoMad is like stepping into a 1920s cigar room. Dim lighting, a redish tint to the room, velour, and tons of fancy drinks.My two colleagues and I decided to have a pre-Christmas celebration before the holiday weekend. We had a reservation for three and were sat right outside the kitchen window. There are two dining rooms to the NoMad and both are equally intimate. The menu was small but just enough for us to ask our waiter what every single dish consisted of - no shame. He cordially explained every single dish to us, to our satisfaction, it took a good 10 minutes.The duck was exceptionally cooked, the pig skin was crisped to the point of a perfect crackling, and the scallops were like butter they were so tender.The highlights for this meal however were the celery tortellini, and the milk & honey dessert. One of the restaurants top appetizers; they mix black truffle with a puree of celery (and most likely other ingredients) to make one of the most uncious and delicious tortellini in NYC. The accompanying sauce was foamed which created an even more light but extremely savory element to the dish - absolute perfection.The milk & honey desert was essentially eating a deconstructed custard cake. The milk was dehydrated and sprinkled as large bits atop of vanilla ice cream canelles and drizzled with honey. The cherry on top of an excellent meal.Although the NoMad will only be for the special occassion in my book, I wouldn't hesitate coming back for another amazing meal.",3,1,2
159,Rachel W.,"Manhattan, NY",285,201,532,4.0,12/20/2016,"My expectations for the Nomad were pretty high, and it did not disappoint!  I went with my parents on a (snowy) Sunday night around 7.  The place was pretty packed when we got there, and seemed to remain so throughout the night.  We were seated at this three person table right when you walk in.  It was off to the right, so it was nice since we weren't catching a breeze from the opening door, and it was a little secluded.  Our waiter was great. He dropped off the drinks menu, which is pretty big, and the food menu.  We browsed the drinks menu first. There were such interesting sounding cocktails, but I wasn't really up for a cocktail, so I went with a glass of Chardonnay. The waiter said they had two, and described both, and I was able to pick the one that sounded more appealing to me. After we ordered our drinks, and were still looking through the menu, they brought some bread. It was warm, and fluffy!  It had sweet potatoes and sage on top, and it was so good!  We were all kind of torn on what we should order, so we asked the waiter for some guidance and he was very good.  We gave him some options of what we were torn between and he gave, what sounded like, his honest opinion, and definitely didn't steer us wrong. We got two starters for us to share.  We were thinking the squash and carrot, but they seemed kind of similar, so he suggested the salmon. I made sure the dill with it was easily removable, and we ordered that and the squash. Both were really good, and I was still somewhat skeptical of the salmon, but I tasted it and it was great! It came in a little jar with a few pieces of toast, and you just spread it on. The squash was also really good, with a little cheese on top. Cheese makes everything better really.  I was tempted to get the lobster for my main, but after hearing what the waiter said about the dish I decided to go for the scallops, and it didn't disappoint. The scallops were cooked perfectly, and there were these white beans underneath that paired very well with it.  My mom got the cod, and I had a bite.. so good!  My dad got the pig, and that was amazing too. Honestly everything we all had was great, and we were so stuffed!  We browsed the dessert menu, since you can't not look, but we were honestly so full we didn't order anything else.  The Nomad restaurant was really great. The service was great, especially our knowledgeable waiter, and all the food was terrific. I would definitely love to come back!",5,2,4

167,Jacinda G.,"New York, NY",11,58,39,3.0,9/17/2017,"I selected the NoMad from the pictures I saw on OpenTable and the place looked right up my alley (lux-food spot? I'm in). Almost 90% of my money is spent on travels and restaurants so I've seen enough both in and out of the US to have high expectations of places that want to showcase themselves as such. The Nomad comes in at a solid 3 stars for Saturday Brunch dining.The venue: The place is great. Velvet seating and on the walls. The middle portion lets in more natural lighting, but we were seated on the edge near the fireplace which had a darker, quieter ambiance. The location was very nice. What knocked the place down 2 stars was the service and the food. Firstly, I do not like to feel rushed at the table and it seemed the person who was serving was getting annoyed having to come to the table 3-4 times in a span of 5 minutes to keep asking us if we had selected our drink/food choices yet. The food options were surprisingly basic. I was expecting more exotic food options, not Avocado toast and eggs benedict. The drinks were OK, nothing crazy. My friend had ordered the chicken dish, but it was very undercooked.If you're going for a lovely venue, this place has it, but there are plenty of other options in the city that have just as great (if not better) location and more appetizing food.",,,
168,Jocelyn K.,"Jersey City, NJ",465,862,4808,4.0,12/6/2015,"Dim lighting, classy interior, very polite service. The NoMad is the place to go with your significant other. I also saw a table of a family with very young children. Glad to see they accommodate everyone.Instead of a bread basket the give you a whole focaccia made with onion and potatoes. There is pretty much unlimited fococcia. Our waitress kept on asking if we wanted more. This is the first time I had bread with potato baked into it. Very savory, but not buttery or oily. The bread itself had a rye taste to it.Reading the other reviews, I expected they would bring out the whole $84 roast chicken and then be served a small piece in comparison. I guess they do that to let us take pictures and marvel at its beauty. What do they do with the leftovers? Use it as chicken for their chicken sandwich the next day during lunch?I was underwhelmed by the chicken and to me it is hyped up. Was it the best chicken I've had in my life? Probably not. Was it the best use of $84? Definitely not. The chicken breast was very good in terms of chicken breast. Not dry as dry as chicken breast can be sometimes. There was a taste of truffles, but I still thought the breast was kind of bland. Truffles and Foie Gras weren't strong enough flavors to make the chicken more exciting. There was too much brioche mixed in and not enough richness from the foie gras. I did enjoy the dark meat with the gravy on the side and the root vegetables surrounding the chicken. I wish they gave more of the dark meat, since that's where the fat and flavor is. In addition to the chicken, we got the Fluke, Smoked Nori, Shiso, Matsumato Mushrooms appetizer. This tiny plate is $22. There were some pieces that really soaked well into the marinade and tasted delicious. It is similar to a less strong version of the raw squid. Some pieces didn't soak in as much, but delicious fluke overall.I loved the experience and seeing the whole roast chicken being displayed to us, but if I were to come back I would not order it again. The other entrees sound just as appetizing. We were unfortunately too full to order any dessert. I wish we did, since the desserts sound so unique. I will have to come back just for the dessert.",8,4,8

Updated review","Every time I come I tell myself don't order the chicken and I always end up ordering the chicken, which might be justifiable because they change the recipe every season (also changed is the forever shrinking dark meat portion size). I will say that I have tried the Egg appetizer and fruits de mer and both were amazing too. But I really don't understand the crudite and radishes.Cocktails are the strong suit. I recommend the (occasionally off-menu) bamboo. It's the perfect blend of dry and bitter.",4,1,3

The hotel lobby is batcave dark and the entrance to the restaurant has a curtained area, but once you step inside, you are in a glass-roofed atrium and can look up the side of the hotel and to the sky beyond. The room is very attractive and eclectic, with lots of fresh flowers. The tables are a touch close together for my taste.The food was excellent. They brought a loaf of bread, which had some greens, onions and potatoes baked into the top. Lunch is a two-course fixed price for $34. I had the pappardelle with braised short rib and cabbage as a very rich first course that had flavor depth to spare. Some of the best pasta I've had in a while and even surpassed the linguine with Meyer lemon and black pepper that I had at the Mark later in the trip. For the main course, I had the scallops with English peas and morels. Wonderful balance of caramelization and saltiness on the scallops, with the added richness of the morels and some textural snap from the peas. It was delicious. I also had a cocktail and a glass of wine. So, between those and the $10 supplement for the scallops, I turned a $34 prix-fixe into a $96 check with tax and tip. Yea, me. Waitstaff was professional and solicitous and everything was beautifully presented. The timing between courses was a bit slow I felt, but I was dining solo this time so that may have something to do with it. The cocktail list here is inventive and extensive, and it is well worth it to stop in the dark and luxe Elephant Bar at the back of the restaurant to continue your experience.",,,1

172,Kelly C.,"Springfield, VA",72,222,288,5.0,12/8/2016,"If I could describe this restaurant in one word it would be: ""class"". My business partner and I had spent the entire day shopping in a warehouse for jewelry parts and were not expecting to go to a ""formal"" dinner, but decided to stop in because of the stellar reviews. We are SO GLAD we did. Even though we were not dressed for the occasion by any means, we were still treated with hospitality and the kind of service you would expect from a Michelin star restaurant. What I mean by this is, from start to finish: the doorman, the hostesses, the coat check, the waiter and ""runners"" hands down some of the best service I've received in a LONG time. And now the food. Creative, delicious, satisfying, and exquisitely balanced. We started with the celery root tortellini appetizer with black truffle. Now sometimes I've ordered items with black truffle and you can barely taste it, but are paying for it anyways...this dish was savory and everything you would expect from a truffle dish. Oh, and it had Parmesan FOAM, which sounds fancy, and it was, but oh so tasty. After eating it I realize why the waitress who served it to us was so excited about the dish. I ordered the duck entree and my friend ordered the suckling pig. The portions are perfectly laid out so that you will have just enough room for dessert. The plates were beautiful to look at, but every garnish was a taste sensation adding to the star of the show: the protein. My duck was crispy and fatty and perfectly cooked complemented by tangy and sweet huckleberries. My friend absolutely loved her dish that was recommended to us by our waiter--he highly praised the crispyness of the pig skin compared to the tender meat. She loved her dish as well. We didn't want this meal to end! We decide to get dessert. I had the pineapple ""cake"" and she had the coffee dessert. My pineapple dish wasn't a typical cake, but morsels that once you put together was like a pineapple rum party in my mouth. If you have time, don't skip out on the after dinner coffee! I am already planning my next meal back here. This restaurant was everything we could've wanted in our last meal in the city.",3,,
173,Rebecca H.,"Shelton, CT",19,71,3,3.0,1/19/2018,"This was my second experience dining here. My first was more enjoyable, but being lunch hour, the staff seemed better in control of the service. Last night I was with a large party which I understand isn't always easy to accommodate, but I felt the level of service I experienced didn't match the price tag of the meal. First we were asked to check our coats and the woman running check decided that 5 of us should go on one ticket. We were seated and our host decided everyone would drink wine which is fine, but I politely asked for a cocktail list because wine and I don't always mix. I waited for 25 minutes for a list while everyone else was starting their second glass of wine. It seemed because I was the odd person out, not one person looking after our table could be bothered with making sure I was also enjoying drinks. Not once did anyone ever notice I had finished my drink and with my back to the room it was impossible toFlag someone down. This continued throughout the night. Seriously no one paid any attention. Most of our table ordered the tortelloni to start and most people accidentally said tortellini to which our server curtly corrected every single time. Honestly is it that big of a deal that the guests mispronounce a pasta name that you feel the need to talk down to them. She was really snotty all night. The food was mixed. The TORTELLONI was absolutely amazing, but my chicken after all the presentation fuss really didn't live up to expectations. Breast was dry and the skin was soggy. At the end of the night which I did enjoy (my company was hilarious) we started to make our way to coat check and I was ready before everyone else on my single ticket. Instead of treating me with any level of respect the woman piled everyone's coats and bags on my body! Seriously. Like I was a god damn coat rack. I jokingly let her know this was a bit much and the rest would be by shortly after using the restroom, but she let me know she wanted them off her hands and proceeded to stack everything on me. Great food (or good food this time) does not need to be accompanied by attitudes. Acting pretentious towards guests or like you can't be bothered can really ruin a night. Thankfully it didn't ruin mine, but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and definitely won't return. You can find plenty of fantastic chicken and hand pulled pasta around this city and it won't be served by jerks and won't cost you half as much.",1,,
174,Kyle C.,"New York, NY",107,88,40,5.0,1/14/2017,"I'd like to tell you all about how much I love The NoMad Restaurant & Bar.I've been coming in here at least once a month now for the last year, working and attending classes in the Flatiron district. This place is an industry staple - with a phenomenal menu that isn't too highbrow, with respectable portion sizes and immaculate attention to detail. There are so many ways to go right on the menu, it's almost impossible to go wrong.As a regular, they keep tabs on my allergies, my favorite dishes and drinks - and when I came in for my birthday last month, they treated me with endless kindness and respect; starting me off with my favorite cocktail and surprising me left and right. Every single cocktail on that menu is crafted to perfection. There are some that aren't my cup of tea, but when you find the few that mesh with your palate you'll have trouble going back to anything less. Their sommelier staff is incredibly knowledgeable, hand selecting wines from around the world, regularly meeting with experts to update their selection and get special editions and limited releases for their customers. Just take a look at the wine list - it's one of the most comprehensive in the city. They also have a beer called Le Poulet that Brooklyn Brewery crafted just for their special ""roast chicken for two."" If that isn't quality dining - then I should probably slow down on the drinks. My favorite dishes have to be the roast chicken for two, the carrot tartare, the celery root ravioli, the risotto and the cod. You really can't go wrong. Their desserts are also amazing - everyone recommends the milk and honey, and everyone is right. The Michelin people know their stuff, so trust them and trust me when I say, its worth it.",1,,

Updated review","Brought my husband to the NoMad Hotel for a surprise anniversary getaway and was sure to book our dinner at the NoMad restaurant after hearing nothing but great things about the place from my friends.We certainly weren't disappointed, as not only is the restaurant gorgeous (lovely sexy vibe), but the service was great and the food was just out of this world. I really mean that- the FOOD WAS AMAZING! We ordered the Sunchoke and the Chicken for 2 and we both thought the chicken was probably the best we have had in years. Friendly and prompt service that helped us feel special was icing on the cake. We plan to come back again and again. Loved it!",5,,2
176,Food Junkie S.,"Manhattan, NY",40,70,12,5.0,7/28/2017,"Good heavens! This was some good food.Where do I start?Okay, first. I've had a breakfast meeting here once before, so I already knew how beautiful and picturesque the dining room is at NoMad. It's truly astonishing. I want to live at the hotel now so that I can roll out of bed, put on my house shoes, go down and drink tea while I read the morning's paper in the dining room everyday. But that's another story.Anywho, started out at the Elephant Bar. I'm bummed that the NoMad Bar isn't open right now, will be back for that very soon! (I believe it opens back up in August?)The Elephant Bar is cute though, not roomy, but cute.Dinner was one of the best 3 course meals that I've probably ever had! Now mind you, I am not eating at fine dining restaurants on a regular basis, so when I do it is memorable for sure!!And memorable this was!!I have a dairy allergy and it was really great that the waitress was not annoyed in discussing what dishes can be made without cream or butter. In fact, she started out asking if there were any food allergies at the table. It's nice that some people care, as some restaurants seem to feel like they'd prefer you didn't come with your annoying allergy.For appetizers we shared the Trout and the Corn with polenta and roasted potato (this dish is actually a main but we made it an appetizer).For mains I had the Squash and my associate had the Scallops.Jesus!!  Every. Single. Bite. Was. Flavorful.I cannot stress that enough.The presentation of the food was something out of a food porn documentary on Netflix.What did I do to deserve all of this goodness?? My karma must be finally paying off :)Thank you gastro gods!!",,1,
177,Daniel B.,"Menlo Park, CA",23,18,15,2.0,5/30/2017,"I've eaten here quite a few times and normally the food is fantastic, but unfortunately this latest trip (May 30, 2017) was a miss. The main item I keep coming back for is the roast chicken for two. On this visit the breast was overcooked, ruining its taste and texture. The normally wonderful stuffing of brioche, truffle, and foie under the skin was burnt. The separate dish of leg meat didn't suffer from being overcooked but was oversalted. Fortunately the other items we had were much better and included a foie torchon that was excellent and agnolloti with peas, morels, in a rich tasting yet light sauce. Desserts were also great including their carrot cake and a very tasty interpretation of ""milk and honey"" which had a wonderfully play of creamy and crispy textures with sweet and salty notes. Overall the other items weren't enough to save the letdown of the main course. Normally I'd send it back but we were celebrating an engagement for another couple and I didn't complain to avoid an hour wait to cook a new chicken. If the consistency improves I'd return.",3,,

Brunch probably can only represent 30% of Nomad; nevertheless it already left me enough wow moments.We ordered all dishes for share - starting from their signature chicken sandwich and smoked salmon, and finished with the assorted croissant platter. Definitely opt for the sandwich, it was large in size, filled with foie gras, and was loaded with chicken meat. Smoked salmon was a bit mediocre, however that was completely compensated by the crispy bread on the side. We almost had no space for the croissant any more, so only gave a bite for it - hmm delicious. Loved their chocolate filling!Service on the slower side - had been left unattended for at least 15 min. However everything else simply worked out fine and we all enjoyed ourselves. Romantic decoration inside.",4,2,1

I could not be a slave to my West Virginia roots and ask for more bread with which to sop up the broth!  My savior Stephen politely asked if I would like more bread.  Like a pardoned condemned man I eagerly accepted and sopped up every drop of broth!  That was not the end of my birthday meal though, it was just the beginning.  We then received the whole roasted chicken for two.  The chicken was so tender it melted in my mouth.  The skin was crispy and flawless.  Dark meat was served in a separate dish with greens.  All served with some delicious asparagus.  Dessert was a light fluffy peach cobbler with tart peach ice cream.  The perfect ending to a perfect birthday dinner.  Thank you, you're a great place!",1,1,

182,Amanda K.,"Los Angeles, CA",1215,439,884,4.0,10/1/2015,"4.5Certainly a quality over quantity type of place as a one Michelin star restaurant. Reservations are highly suggested, I was only able to get one last minute thanks to a friend!Anyway, I came here for dinner and found the atmosphere to be instantly sultry and luxurious yet not over-the-top and intimidating. We were attended to politely and frequently and began with a wine and beer. I had a glass of the Cabernet Franc ($18) which was surprisingly light and slightly tart.I'm assuming since the menu is seasonal, the selection was quite limited. My boyfriend and I decided to share the following dishes:- ""Egg"" appetizer ($20): Sunny side-up egg with pole beans, veal ragout and brown butter- ""Chicken"" for two ($84): A whole roasted chicken with foie gras, black truffle and brioche, smoked grits and succotash. While we waited, the server handed us a small wooden paddle with freshly baked bread which was warm with onions baked into it. It had a nice thickness and wasn't too crunchy- we ate all of it pretty quickly! haha The egg was tender and runny with an interesting creamy sauce but the chicken definitely stole the show. A server actually brought it out to show us what it looked like in whole and explained that they would be placing it back into the oven and then cutting and preparing the meat.Eventually the roasted chicken returned in two sumptuous parts: one with the white breast and foie gras stuffing and then all the dark meats in a small iron skillet, tossed in a red-tinted cream sauce.The carved chicken pieces were savory and rich- the foie gras and brioche stuffing added a silken depth and the meat was perfectly moist! The skin was a deep brown and crisp, every single piece was of quality with zero fat. For dessert we of course opted for the Milk & Honey with Shortbread, Brittle, and Ice Cream. The brittle pieces were a nice crunchy surprise and the ice cream scoops were light and not overwhelming.----Great place for a special occasion. The only other fine restaurants I have to compare to is Morimoto and Bouchon in Napa and Novio at the Half Moon Bay Ritz Carlton to name a few. While everything was presumably lovely, I do wish they had a tad bit more selection on their menu. I hope to come here again during another season to see the changes!",6,4,8

Updated review",Came for dinner before the show by the Magician at NoMad Upstairs. Our server Christian was really friendly with great suggestions from drinks to apps to entrees. He also looked into questions we had about the elusive magic show.I loved his recommendation for a cocktail called Paris Is Burning that was off the menu. The pasta app and the soft boiled egg app were great. The seafood tower was okay. The chicken of course is a must though I'm shocked at how they bring the entire chicken and then bring back a small breast each and a small side of dark meat -- what happened to the rest of the chicken? And of course their Rosemary rye garlic potato bread is awesome! I'd come back just for their bread and cocktails.,2,4,2

Updated review","3.5 Arrived a little early and got seated right away. Our waiter introduced himself and service began. The space is beautiful. I visited the Library Bar (towards the back) last year and walked through it during the day. It's completely different at night. It truly comes alive! The menu is small. We took our time deciding while the sommelier attentively decanted our wine table-side. These were our choices:Tomato Salad: summer greens and burrata.  Just blah. Coincidentally, I had just tried the one at Macchialina (in Miami Beach) and this one did not come close. Not even a bit. Disappointing. Chicken Liver Mousse: with pickles and rye. Excellent. Nice portion size, texture, and flavor. Scotch Olives: lamb sausage with sheep's milk cheese. Eh. Not impressed. This one needed more cheese, less breading, or something to balance it all out. The breading overpowered it.Roast Chicken for Two: foie gras, black truffle & brioche with smoked grits & succotash. Showstopper! The hype is real and well deserved. The chicken is brought out and presented table side before they take it away and serve it up again with all the aforementioned additions. The white and dark meat are then prepared and served differently. This dish is a must-try! Butter Poached Lobster with corn, peppers, & arugula. I'm surprised with this dish's lack of appeal. I'm in NYC for goodness sake. This is the ultimate foodists' playground! This is the best Nomad has?  Suckling Pig Confit: smoked peaches, mustard greens, and bacon marmalade. Good, but not as outstanding as others I've had (like for example, the one at ABC Kitchen!). Milk & Honey: shortbread, brittle & ice cream. Very good! I really enjoyed this dessert! It was playful, well balanced, and not overly sweet. Lemon Tart: ricotta ice cream & almond shortbread. Although the lemon was actually a little overwhelming for me, it was still good.Coffee Granita: with crema & vanilla ice cream. Not everyone loved the granita, but I did. Loved this one. Milk Chocolate Ganache: with chocolate fondant & malt ice cream. This was my favorite. LOVED!About the bar- I find it extremely tacky to not allow your diners to visit the Library Bar after service. Let me get this right...I just spent quite a lot on this dinner, would like to continue the night at the bar, and can't? For hotel guests only? Are you kidding me? I didn't walk in right off the street. Adding insult to injury? It was half empty. I visited the Library Bar last year (and reviewed here: yelp.com/biz/the-nomad-l… ) and really wanted our friends to try it. It worked out for us because we got to try Raine's Law Room instead, but that's not the point. The point is, directing your guests to the back bar (or the door) once dinner is done it just not cool. That was a turnoff. Restaurant summary- While only the chicken liver mousse and roast chicken stood out from everything we ordered, I did enjoy every single dessert. Service was well orchestrated the entire night. Our waiter was reserved, yet witty. We really liked him. I absolutely love the vibe at Nomad. It's dark, sexy, and hip. I also loved the varied music played. The overall sound level was loud without it being uncomfortable. There was even a (sort-of) celebrity sighting (Martyn Lawrence Bullard/Million Dollar Decorators/Bravo). At the end of the day, I don't see how Nomad has been awarded a coveted Michelin star. I will go ahead and attribute that to restaurant-nepotism (due to its owners). No. Effin. Way. Would I like to have the roast chicken again? Absolutely. Will I ever choose to return over the many other options in NYC? Nope! The Nomad is more about ambiance than it is about substance. There is NO comparison to Eleven Madison Park to be made here. They are completely different.",4,4,6

188,Nicole I.,"New York, NY",1,49,0,4.0,3/4/2018,"Seems like there's a new fad among the ""new american"" restaurants in town -- vegetable tartare.  I was never a fan of beef tartare, but wow NoMad's carrot tartare blew me away.  It was pulpy, slightly tart, and lightly spiced with horseradish.  I had a side of mushrooms too, which were decent but nothing special.  Decor was stately, grand, and correspondingly quiet.  Portions were on the smaller side, a great perk when you eat out as much as I do, and prices were on the higher side, but overall I was happy with the experience.",,,

Moist, tender, flavorful etc. I was not too fan of how they used the dark meat but nonetheless, it was good.I met Chef Humm back in 2002 at Campton Place in San Francisco.

I loved the velvet seating and the light coming in through the sunroof.Onto the food: 3 people at our table ended up getting the famous chicken sandwich (with foie gras and truffle). This was highly recommended and it seemed like at least one person at every table in the entire restaurant got us. It did not disappoint. The brioche was buttery and fluffy, and the foie gras was rich and paired well with the truffle. I was also very impressed by the veggie burger. Also served on the brioche, great burger and delicious aioli. One of the better veggie burgers I've had at a nice restaurant. And lastly - don't forget to order a side of fries.

This place books up quickly, so I made sure to make a later reservation about a week in advance for Friday night. As we arrived, we were seated right away in the main dining room.First off, the bread that they bring out is so good! Fresh, warm, and has garlic cloves inside it and onions and dill throughout--we may have gone through a couple of loaves during the meal...Anyways, after perusing the menu, we decided to go with an order of the crudite at the recommendation of our waitress. Boy was this a treat! Who would have thought that raw veggies and dip could be so delicious, but they really managed to do that with this dish.For the rest of the meal we decided to split a couple of entrees, the scallops and the duck.The scallops were cooked perfectly and came served over a broth that was super tasty. There were also some pasta and veggies and beans that went well with the dish and really provided a nice texture overall.Though the scallops were good, the duck may have even been better. I am not even a duck person, and I couldn't stop eating this dish. The flavor and tenderness of the duck was so delicious and may have been the best preparation I've ever had. In addition, the corn salsa they served with the dish was also to die for as it had a great freshness and sweetness that complimented the duck well.For dessert, we decided to go with the milk and honey dish. Though it was decent, it was nowhere near the level of the rest of the meal.Overall, this place provides a beautiful backdrop for a meal and serves up some delicious food. It is easy to see why this is one of the top spots in NYC. We also enjoyed some drinks while we were here, but I can't really justify paying $15+ for them since they weren't particularly memorable.

It was past 10:30pm so they were no longer seating anyone for dinner, however they told us the bar menu was still available. We were led to the back, through the dining room, past a few bar areas into this cozy little corner in the library bar, surrounded by gorgeous velvet drapery and a roaring fireplace.We weren't too hungry, so I ordered the kabocha salad with pears, pumpkin seeds, parmesan and a light balsamic vinaigrette, and hubby ordered the dry-aged beef burger, which hesaid was phenomenal and cooked perfectly medium. I was underwhelmed by the salad, however, hence the removal of a star; really was expecting more from that combo, especially since this was one of two salads on the menu. The real star of the meal for me were the ""soft cocktails"" aka mocktails aka non-alcoholic drinks. My husband and I don't  drink alcohol and I'm not into sodas/orange/cranberry/apple juices, so I always get super excited when there are new and interesting drink options. I had the ""cease and desist,"" essentially an orange creamsicle in a glass--unique and delish!--and hubby had ""la pina,"" pineapple, lime and a hint of jalapeno--a little spicy kick that worked incredibly well.Also to be noted, servers were friendly and our water glasses never neared empty.

It's definitely a place to celebrate as the hotel looks so cool and has an awesome ambiance.  It is definitely kind of like a cocktail speakeasy feel with the Library lounge and the dark moody lighting.  Tables and chairs are almost sort of antique-y (but very plush and comfy). We had really great service - everyone was energetic, made good recs, explained to us in great detail about the making of the famous chicken.  It does not actually take THAT long to make (not an hour or so but yes it takes a while), and it is actually not a huge chicken by any means, I think it is just for two because it's super rich.  We ordered it of course - as my brother in law describes, it's bascailly skinned, and organs taken out.. then input with foie gras mixed with brioche and seasonings, then juicy skin goes back on and it gets cooked. It was very well done- crispy, sugary, tender, with good truffle flavor. It's an interesting experience because the chicken is so stuffed, you're sort of eating very different elements. So backing up. To start, we had the scotch olives and radishes from the snacks section.  Both were really delicious.  I loved the scotch olives- fried and stuffed with delicious olives and lamb sausage I think.  We also shared the celery root tortelloni (so yummy and rich, definitely get it) with a lot of truffle.  Then, we a fresh heirloom tomato salad with ricotta salata (yum).  For other mains apart from the chicken, we also had the sucking pig which I highly recommend - crispy skin, and the beef dish which was my least favorite but still good. It was really rare, fyi. Everything was beautifully presented- very artful seasonal cooking.  We happened to order meat heavy dishes but heard the buternut squash was an A+.  Of course, the Nomad is known for being an equally armed cocktail bar and for sure we had some drinks.  I had the Satan's Circus (lol) which was sweet and spicy..and the guys had plenty of beers, and we all shared a great bottle of Cab. For dessert, we ordered three options and while beautiful they all sort of tasted the same lol - the coconut and chocolate which had really good coconut, chocolate flavor, the coffee (very good cold brew coffee infused with shaved ice), coffee ice cream and the famed Milk and Honey which was sweet in a milk-honey way. Definitely recommend checking it out for - for dinner, lunch, a drink and I think they even have a special bar menu if you just want that.",2,,1

In terms of dinner, if you find yourself here I only have two recommendations: - Get the Carrot Tartare w/ picked quail egg. Freakishly good - Avoid the Whole Roasted Chicken for two unless you can spread it among 5 people. It's not worth getting this if it's just two of you since it's really not that good. I've been to French restaurants that have delivered incredible, memorable chicken that I would go back for. That didn't happen at the NoMad. Note: if you're in a community food setting, take the dark meat over the white meat. I'd come back on someone else's dime to explore more of the menu.",1,,
198,Cahill L.,"New York, NY",0,65,39,5.0,8/14/2017,My husband took me here for my birthday. We tried the Lobster tasting. We were dying to try the chicken but decided to go for the Lobster. We were not pressured into it. The service was amazing. They made us feel special by putting us in the side room where you can see everything but you feel like you're the only ones in the restaurant. The service was attentive but not overbearing. The lobster tasting was incredible. Every bit was delectable.  They only have it until 9/1. We were left feeling full but not too crazy. Everyone at the Nomad from the bartender to our server made us feel welcomed and special.,,,
