While the food and drink are slightly expensive, (around 8 dollars for a small drink and croissant) the quality makes up for it! Overall, it's a great coffee store and I would highly recommend!",,,
1,Me M.,"Old Bridge Township, NJ",0,40,42,5.0,4/11/2018,"I wandered in here to warm up & relax. Nobody said anything to me or rushed me out as I sat idle for over an hour. I walked up to the counter because at this point I felt it was only right to buy something & had an interaction with 3 employees over a small container of yogurt. I didn't even eat it yet but my goodness what a polite, friendly & helpful staff here in NYC! I was amazed at the kindness & service I was shown! Kudos to this crew! I recommend it here!",1,,
2,Joe S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,29,0,3.0,10/15/2018,"Nothing special about this particular Pret, nothing mind numbingly bad about it. I never deviate and only get the ham and cheese baguette. Sometimes too much greens but otherwise a reliable lunch option. Customer service attitudes range from very friendly to ""why are you bothering me"". I go to the Pret in Penn Station probably just as often and even though that location is 20 times busier in a much smaller space, I have never encountered a rude employee.",,,

You can excuse an eye roll or short attitude, but every employee I came across this morning was rude and curt.

I've been to enough Pret locations, both here in the city and in Chicago. This place probably has the worst staff. Today during lunch time, whoever the cashier is basically said no hello, no smile, no thank you, and absolutely no facial expression. I get it, you hate your job, but maybe fake a little?? Reading other reviews, seems like staff is a common problem here. Wonder what the management is doing. There's no lack of other food options here. Do I want to come in every day and see staff hating on their job? Probably no.",14,13,12
6,Tonni B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",9,29,7,3.0,8/21/2017,Food not worth the price. Were bland and barely has taste. Coffee was ok. The pret in the U.K. is much better. Salad bowl was good size but no complimentary dressing. Have to buy it separately. The croissant was fresh however could have been heated up a little more.,,,
7,B. K.,"New York, NY",166,10,0,1.0,7/25/2016,"My husband experienced harassment on account of his appearance at this location (350 Hudson street) this morning.For some background, he works across the street at 345 Hudson and dines at this location almost every morning before work or during lunch. He wears a turban as part of our religion (Sikhism) which makes him highly identifiable. As a result, many of the employees that work here have seen him at this location many times before and often recognize him.This morning, he ordered his usual breakfast items and paid for them at the counter. He decided to dine in at the restaurant. A few minutes into eating his meal, an employee named Sadelle (not sure of the proper spelling of her name) approached him and started accusing him in a very rude manner that he did not pay for his meal.  She demanded in an aggressive tone that he produce a receipt. Unfortunately, the man who processed my husband's order did not give him one (in fact,he has NEVER gotten a receipt from anyone at this location - I think it is an NYC thing where people want to come and go quickly so they don't give them receipts). My husband told her that he didn't have a receipt but she could go back and ask the gentlemen who processed his payment. My husband got up off his chair and pointed him out to her.  She gave him a rude look as if she didn't trust him and stormed off.  A few minutes later, she returned. This time she was even more rude in her approach and repeated that my husband did not pay. At this time, he walked her to the employee who processed his order. The employee agreed that my husband paid.  At this point, she did not even have the courtesy to even apologize for making a mistake (both for approaching him in the first place in a rude way and then second for not checking with him even after he told her that he processed the payment). She just walked off and didn't say a word.In summary, this was a very humiliating experience. Sadelle was clearly was treating my husband this way because of his religious appearance.  Instead of double checking with her employees, Sadelle decided to accuse first (and that too, in a humiliating manner). The whole restaurant was silent and watching.I am shocked at this. We will never dine there again and have told our friends and colleagues about what happened. They are appalled and agree to boycott the chain until an apology is offered. The humiliation experienced in front of all those people was unacceptable and dehumanizing.",9,5,
8,Erin D.,"ASTORIA, NY",64,9,2,5.0,3/30/2017,"Lovw their food. I'm always getting their oatmeal and lattes. The pricing is pretty good, slightly cheaper than Starbucks and all organic.

I come here often as I work across the street and I have NEVER had a bad experience here. Which to me speaks volumes because we all have our horror stories of fast food service.

Updated review","So they change their menu rather frequently, which I guess is both good and bad.  The bad is a lot of the vegetarian choices I relied on are gone, but there are still some options.  No more Hungarian Mushroom soup, which really sucks.  The good side is there are new things to try.  Had the avocado wrap which was ok.  Not big enough on its own, definitely grab a soup or chips as well.  Overall I like eating here over Hale and Hearty next store because it doesn't smell like soup at Pret (H&H always smells like soup, understandably), but also because it is a really cheerful and bright place to spend my lunch.  Huge windows are awesome, lots of natural light, and super high ceilings.This is also the quickest place on Hudson St to grab breakfast in the morning.",2,1,1
12,Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1825,1613,269,3.0,8/4/2014,Never been to a PAM before. Self serve coffee BEFORE you pay for it...? I guess the honor system is alive and well here. Plenty of organic and healthy options for food. Open eating space but limited amount of seating. I can see a lot fighting over seats during lunch. Only had their coffee and it was tasty. Prices are below what I expected to pay in NYC. A stones throw away from the Passport Office. Will return to try their food options.,4,2,2
13,Michelle W.,"Brooklyn, NY",549,223,89,4.0,10/14/2014,"Breakfast, lunch, snacks and more snacks... Lately, for me, it's been all about Pret's uncommon ability for satisfying those four most important meals of the day. OK.... so its practically cookie cutter, part-of-a-food-chain ambience can be something of a setback for my current lunch spot crush lasting more than a few days. But with fresh food ALWAYS, fast and super efficient customer service, a clean and pristine environment, and affordable-for-Soho lunch options, Pret has staying power and forever returning power too.   Before my job moved to the less practical Holland tunnel area from Midtown, Pret was reliable and conveniently located downstairs from the office. In fact, I remember it being on my top 10 list of things I would miss most about moving offices. Happy that Pret has maintained its amazingness, and glad that there are so many more locations.",1,,
14,Chris K.,"Denville, NJ",0,4,0,2.0,5/30/2017,"Been going here almost every day for three years. The staff is always pretty rude but efficient. Sandwich wuality has been getting worse and worse and the manager that's on at lunch everyday (loud mouth woman who is always yelling for everyone to get in line) is just an obnoxious bruise on prets branding. Today the service was extra rude to their customers treating them like hungry cattle, and the food I got a solid 3/10. Throwing this nasty sandwich in the trash and going to mcdonalds. After several years as my go to, now I'm just gonna go to Essen.",1,,

16,Hieu H.,"Los Angeles, CA",295,564,485,3.0,10/7/2013,Hip location - check.Cool packaging - check.Fast and cheap - check.Made a quick stop into the Pret A Manger on Hudson to see what all the hype is about and grabbed the ham and egg sandwich and the pesto chicken with avocado sandwich to take with me on the plane.  Big mistake on the pesto chicken selection.  These guys weren't kidding about how fresh their product is.  These were definitely meant to be eaten immediately.  The avocado on my sandwich was already starting to turn an unappetizing brown.I loved the inviting space and warm lighting.  Would definitely go here again.,2,,

18,Fallopia T.,"Manhattan, NY",491,705,1216,2.0,10/18/2012,"The good: they have vegan options, and they're labeled as such.The bad: they have remarkably few vegan options. Everything is pre-made, naturally, so you can't work with the chef to make something vegan. (For some reason, I just doubled over laughing at the idea you could do that!)It's not like I actually work in this neighborhood, so I'm fortunately not tied to the choices in the neighborhood. If I were, I'd either a) brown-bag it or b) go to Westville across the street, which just opened up another outpost to its growing empire. And they have a clean, accessible bathroom--with an XLerator dryer. As one other reviewer mentioned, the vibe here is infectiously cheerful; they must be snorting laughing gas in the back!",7,5,7
19,Cesar P.,"Jersey City, NJ",88,8,0,2.0,8/6/2016,"Stopped in around 9am this morning (Saturday). Rude staff.

I've been to this location when Natasha was at the register and she's also not very good at her job - rude and not familiar with the items listed on the menu.

Unfortunately, no decaf organic coffee.Someone dropped cans by me and everyone awkwardly stared at me. I wasn't involved in dropping them so that was odd.They've still got great offerings.They seem like a respectable business, donating unsold food to the homeless each night.",,,

They make their food selections with natural and fresh ingredients daily. So everyday everything is fresh!!!! NO LEFTOVERS TO SELL NEXTDAY!!! That's amazing to me!!! I tried a chicken Asian wrap!!!! It had fresh cilantro carrots, cucumber, onions,shredded chicken and  a spicy Asian sauce.  Not too spicy but just enough to make it delicious!!!! The place is very clean and in order, almost no wait to pay.  Their motto is made today, gone today and I give you a high five Pret  A Manger!!!",1,,
22,Laura R.,"New York, NY",38,29,14,5.0,9/20/2015,"This is great for a guilt free quick bite on the run. Everything is fresh and delicious.

23,Louis P.,"Brooklyn, NY",372,621,962,4.0,12/14/2011,"Pret A Manger is a much needed addition to this particular location in the south Village. This area on Hudson Street was mostly a barren wasteland after 6pm on weekdays and all weekend, but things are a changin'! We finally have a quick place for a semi-healthy eat that's not a food cart.The place is large and very bright inside, you are greeted warmly and the calorie counts are large and clearly marked by each sandwich. They have a few sushi options along with a large variety of cold sandwiches and wraps and some warm sandwiches like pulled pork.On my first visit i went with the pine nut avocado wrap and instantly fell in love with it. Creamy avocado with fresh nuts, cucumber, lettuce, tons of basil and tomato with a light dressing on a fresh wrap is perfectly to my liking! My wrap was $7.61 which is high but it tasted so good that i will be back. Excited to have Pret A Manger in the area and love the angle that they do not hold unsold items over night and donate it to charity.",1,,

26,Caroline V.,"New York, NY",57,507,1006,4.0,1/5/2012,"This was my first venture into a Pret A Manger and I must say it was very pleasant.  Note that I take a late lunch so I was in after 230PM.  Shelves were still fully stocked but there were no lines really but still a good smattering of customers perusing the goods and deciding what to get.  They were still bringing out freshly made salads to restock the shelves and it's nice seeing that.  It's a large space with high ceilings so even if it gets crowded I bet it makes you feel less claustrophobic and herdlike but I won't know for sure until I venture here for the ungodly 1PM lunch rush.  Anywho...In an attempt to be healthier in the new year (original yes? :p) I opted to skip the trucks outside and instead go for something healthier in here.  Was definitely tempted by the offerings with the word ""brie"" in them but resisted...And then found myself tempted again by the word ""club"" *sigh* luckily it was the california club!*California club: juicy murray's roasted turkey, thinly sliced avocado, savory pesto aioli, fresh tomato, thinly sliced hard boiled egg, mesclun, pret's seasoning and pret's granary.  That is a LOT going into a sandwich.  I must say the packaging and look reminds me of those ready made sandwiches inside vending machines BUT thankfully that's where all similarities end.  This sandwich was fresh, tasty and filling.  All great things at the lovely price of 6.99 + tax.  It's not cheap but it's not overpriced either, especially for the flavor combinations.  I haven't enjoyed a sandwich made on sandwich bread like that in a LONG time.  Thanks for the yummy lunch.  I'll be back again...soon :)Thanks Pret for opening on Hudson!",,,
27,Shana B.,"Seattle, WA",396,81,41,3.0,1/14/2014,"Pret A Manger keeps its service quick and dirty, so I'll review in kind.When you want decent, relatively healthy lunch without having to wait in line (I'm looking at you, Hale & Hearty), come here. It's not cheap, but there are still food trucks on the same street that are consistently more expensive.Chicken Caesar salad is a favorite go-to of mine. (Thank you Pret for FINALLY giving up those cardboard salad containers. Who could toss a salad in those things?)Ham & cheese sandwich is decent (but sometimes the ham is a little too stringy for more taste, and they often skimp on it anyway).Roast beef sandwich is decent - I'd say a step up from the ham.Chicken noodle soup is decent, but if there isn't a line next door at Hale & Hearty (i.e. if pigs are flying), get it from there instead.I come here for iced coffee sometimes when I don't feel like dealing with Starbucks, but I won't lie - it tastes weird every. time. Not BAD, just....not good. Why do I keep doing this?The All-Star on the menu at Pret is the chocolate croissant. It's amazing. Get it over the breakfast sandwich without a second thought - that one's kinda weird too.Last but not least, the brownie is good. But why is it twice as big as it used to be? Some of us have resolutions in 2014.",,,
28,Danan R.,"New York, NY",886,1843,43,3.0,4/19/2013,"I do like the sandwiches here but I have always found the meats to be on the dry side.  The turkey with swiss and cranberry sauce on a soft, fresh potato roll was delish but the turkey could have been less dry.  The roast beef was flavorful but very tough; however, the ham and cheese was fantastic and the mustard spread had just the right amount of spiciness.  The caprese sandwich was also fantastic with plenty of basil and fresh, thick slices of mozzarella and beefsteak tomatoes.  They definitely give you more fillings than Gigi or the Food Exchange and the sandwiches themselves are more flavorful.  Overall, a good catering option in NYC with higher quality sandwiches.",1,,1
29,Hugo C.,"San Jose, CA",300,419,231,2.0,11/13/2012,"I remember years ago hearing about how this British sandwich retail chain was making its way across the pond and bringing with it its prepared food model and a commitment to having an obscene number of registers open to combat long lines.Maybe it was my fault for coming at off-peak hours for either a late breakfast or a late lunch, but I always found myself standing there for a good minute or two, waiting for one of the dozen staffers to look up and ring me up. It's not like they were furiously busy, they were just not really interested in looking up to see if there were any nitwits over there standing in line.The food was definitely quick and easy to grab and (eventually) go, but you're probably better off waiting another few minutes and hitting up a food truck/cart.",4,4,4

All it would take is using gluten-free bread for one item among the many that they have.Instead, I'm relegated to the land of salads here.

Pret is always good if you're looking for a quick/small bite and a coffee. That's exactly what I was in the mood for and they did not disappoint. I got myself a heat up sandwich with mozzarella, tomatoes in a panini type bread. Scrumptious.

Updated review","Soups and sandwiches are good.Sushi? Not so much. Rice was too soft and crumbled when I attempted to pick it up with my chopsticks.  Fish was fresh but the rice made the sushi a ""meh"" experience.What was I thinking getting sushi when this place specializes in sandwiches and soups?  Sometimes, going out of their norm can be a good thing. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.By the way, their italian wedding soup is really good.  Chicken noodle? A bit bland for my taste.Also, I did notice logistically, the massive crowd can be a ""turn off"".  There are hordes of crowds hovering around the sandwich selections as if they are choosing a life-line.  Come on, it's not rocket science as the sandwich is pretty much self-explanatory. Half of the time, you would think the crowd is waiting in line to pay but nope, they just stand there and wait for their friends to pay.  Move out of the way after you finish paying!  Don't let the crowd deter you; the actual line is short and fast.",2,2,1

38,Kai B.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,116,63,3.0,12/11/2011,"I've never understood what the appeal of pre-made sandwiches on untoasted white bread is. But it's a British thing that seems to have plenty of fans here. Luckily they also have a few sandwiches on baguette bread, as well as a few hot sandwich options.It was about a week into operation when I visited and was still a madhouse. I'm not sure if this will die down. This location has a fairly large seating area, which doesn't seem to get much use. I kind of wish they had added more room in the cashier area instead. While they have six registers (and plea with the customers to form six lines), the fact that they're only a few inches apart from each other creates a ""checkout mob"" of insanity.Nevertheless, my Vietnamese sandwich on a baguette was pretty decent. I also had an interesting side salad of cheese, nuts, some kind of grains, and raisins.",2,,

Updated review","I've come around to Pret since I last wrote a review. Everything costs too much, but it turns out to be a good option in close proximity to my office on Hudson Street. I've become addicted to the meatball hot wrap, and I like being able to pick up an apple or a banana or slice of carrot cake. It never takes long to get your food picked and paid for with how many cashiers they have, and they have enough seating that you can usually find a spot to enjoy your lunch with a book in a reasonable amount of peace.",,,

45,Anni A.,"Montclair, NJ",1,34,0,1.0,3/24/2015,I used to be a huge fan. Still love the cafes in London . The ones in NYC are a complete rip off. It's all bread . Barely any protein between bread. The only decent thing is the chicken soup. The sweets are awful. Completely overpriced,,,
46,Carolina A.,"New York, NY",2,7,1,5.0,7/14/2012,"Food is great but the customer service is fantastic.  I just moved to the city so I wasn't sure what the dog policy was here.  I asked if I could come in with the dog and they said no but if I told them what I wanted from the door, they would make it for me.  I got my morning coffee and croissant all while standing outside the front door with the dog!  Great service!",1,,
47,Jean S.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,2.0,1/5/2012,"Pret opened! Great, right by my office. This is the second time I've gone to grab lunch there. They have more vegetarian options that I feel good about, so cool.First time; Awesome. I got a toastie, or whatever, and it was great.Second time: I really read all the packaging and signs..Made Fresh! It's gonna be Delicious! Best Food Ever!  It's NOT DELICIOUS when the paper is left between the cheese slices. It's actually really gross. The last time something like this happened to me, it must have been over 10 years ago at an Olive Garden when the date sticker showed up on my ravioli. Im not eating here again. Harsh, I know. But even the deli can make a better sandwich, and I won't chomp on paper.",,,
48,Paul B.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,151,1,4.0,6/22/2012,"This place is a solid choice for a quick lunch.  Had a chicken/mozzarella/tomato  sandwich, a bag of popcorn and a honey-tangerine juice.   Delicious, fresh and quick.   Good stuff.",,,
