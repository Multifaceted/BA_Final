I have seen her handle twenty people at a time and not only make all the drinks efficiently but with the prettiest smile around. When I am sad because the world can be cruel l come here see Sara and it's like I am lighter than air and nothing matters as much anymoreThank you Sara, for saving me countless times",1,2,1
1,Matt O.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",355,18,23,2.0,10/6/2018,"This was my first time ordering food here (I had been here about a week earlier and just had beer and enjoyed the live band, which was great) and it will definitely be my last time, with the food. My family got there at around 5:30 on a Friday, long before the place became crowded. It seemed as if the hostess sat us and got us waters and took our order. My brother asked what the chicken sandwich came with (like fries or any side at all) and the hostess/waitress just pointed to the menu and read the description back to us. My mom then ask how big the quesadilla was and she answered with ""well it's not that big and not the small."" To me, having worked in the restaurant business for many years, it seemed as if she was new, or had no idea what the menu was about (which is not a good look either way since there are only like 15 items on the whole menu).    Anyway, we ordered the buffalo chicken egg rolls as an appetizer (not only is it listed under the appetizer section (I think they may call it ""opening acts"" although their menu online is not the same as the one we got in the restaurant), but I even told the hostess/waitress that we wanted it before the rest of our food. Well, after about 30 minutes, all of the food came out together, and the egg rolls tasted like they had been sitting out for some time. There were okay, at best, being a little dry.    My brother got the chicken sandwich and he gave me a bite to taste. We both agreed that we liked the chicken, but the bread choice could have been better. I think it was plain white bread or something similar, but the sandwich was so-so.    My mom and I both got the chicken quesadilla. She has a disease where she cannot have very much salt, so she politely asked if she could have no salt added to anything on the quesadilla. I asked for mine just regular (meaning no changes with the salt). I thought that would have been sufficient, but apparently not. When the food runner brought our food, he handed us each a quesadilla and my mom said ""well which one is no salt?"" He stood there for about ten seconds and finally said ""they both have no salt"". Even though I was a little bothered by this because it seemed as if he had no idea what she asked and just spit out any answer that he thought was right, I let it go. But, a few minutes into eating, my mom started to feel very off. She knew instantly that there was too much salt in her food and she had to stop eating. At that point I immediately asked the waitress/hostess for more water (which I had to do about 3 times throughout our dinner service since she didn't offer us any water even though our glasses were empty), so my mom could take her medication. We got the check and luckily made it out so my mom would feel better.      Overall, I was very displeased with the service, attentiveness of the staff, the kitchen, and the experience in general. It's a shame because the previous time I'd been there (again, only for a beer and the music), I quite liked the ambiance.  I'm lucky that my mom didn't have a more severe reaction and that we didn't need to cause a scene or anything since she was able to get out before anything became very serious. I would not recommend this place for the food, at least. There are plenty of other places in the area that can accommodate better.",,,
2,Christina F.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",15,72,221,4.0,8/10/2018,Came here with a group (approx 25 people). We preplanned with someone from Sessions. Planning was easy and flexible. The staff was very welcoming when we arrived. The food was good (for bar food) but the quantity didn't really meet the needs for 25. The live music was great! Good local spot if you live/ work in the UES.,1,,1

Beware, they have an out of date cocktail menu so don't try and get fancy and order something special, stick to the basics and you'll be fine. The service was pretty awful, especially considering I was there early, before the partying crowd.I can see this place being fun. They had a live band setting up (mind you, at 11:15pm when I left they still weren't preforming). It's loud, rowdy, and your typical snobby crowd, but the music is good and there's room for dancing. Not the worst place to hang...",7,3,4

6,Jhavon W.,"East Bronx, NY",13,22,30,5.0,6/9/2018,Great place for a drink with friends when your in the city.

Second, why don't you play salsa music when people are there for salsa. The response was that there is ""nothing we can do"". Yes there is, play the music. Left after 15 minutes.

12,Mykel B.,"New York, NY",366,463,39,4.0,3/30/2018,"Almost a 5. For bar food, the choices were limited... but all were great. The Po-boy was not a REAL Po-boy (a kind of hero-sandwich) but like all the other sandwiches here... a Po-boy on a hamburger bun... but what a great one!! I had the pulled pork... also on a hamburger bun, also great. The place is loud with a live band, and the bar can be packed, while the dining room in the back is pretty empty. So... sit down if you want. It's a good place to just show up with friends... you can probably get a table easily. The kitchen officially closes at 10, they stayed open an hour extra just for us! You're safe ordering from the main dish menu (the barfood/appetizer menu is pretty standard). Everyone of us had a great meal. --Drink Club NYC is a roving group of NYC drinkers, a different bar every week.",,,1

Updated review",I posted a review a month ago and I think it was a combination-of things changing here in a positive way yet yielded some confusion with the regulars - let me be very clear. Session 73 is AMAZING and the bartenders (all old and new) are fabulous.  Takes a little convo and corse correct - which I did he was not responsible and yet made the first move to rectify.  End of day - Monday Salsa is THE BEST and the bartenders are amazing.  Let's get salsaing and FYI the weekends are insanely good!,,,
15,Joseph O.,"Long Beach, NY",0,46,3,1.0,3/22/2018,"We had a horrible experience here the bartending staff is rude and unprofessional. My girlfriend was leaning her head on her arm which was on the bar and the bartender pushed her arm out of the way so she could hand someone a drink, then proceeded to cause a verbal dispute with us when my girlfriend confronted her. We left following this. I choose not to leave a tip and upon reviewing my credit card statement they took it upon themselves to write in a tip that I did not authorize.Completely unprofessional establishment that serves warm beer and cider. I would not recommend this place to anyone for any reason.",1,,
16,Marcy M.,"New York, NY",131,135,313,4.0,8/21/2017,So many good memories here! One of my best friends from school was spending her birthday in the city and asked me for suggestions for places with live music and I sent her here. Everyone had a blast! There is live music here most nights. Week nights are typically a solo act and weekends are usually 90s cover bands. It reminds me of college the way everyone comes together and drunkenly sings. Came here once for dinner and the food is meh but we stayed for the music,1,,1

20,Elana V.,"Manhattan, NY",222,78,230,4.0,3/10/2017,"What a curious mix of people. I had lived around the corner from this establishment and some how never made it in for the free salsa classes or weekend shenanigans. I finally went last weekend for a friend's birthday and as soon as I entered a little after 11pm on a Saturday I see a group of 20 somethings next to a group of 60y/o+ (without a predatory vibe). Somehow it works though and when the live band started up everyone had a blast. We sang together, we drank together, there was a belligerent dude with inappropriate boundaries singing to anything that *may* have had a pulse... it was very New York. The time flew by and I found myself heading home at 3-something AM!Overall a fun time. Would definitely come back when the live music is roaring.A friend of mine attended the free Salsa classes on Monday nights (?) and always recommended it.",2,1,

Updated review","Had high hopes for this place, after reading some decent reviews. Ordered on Seamless...2 hours past designated delivery time, still no food. Called the venue multiple times, no answer. I understand that mistakes are made, but when no one is there to communicate with, it makes the whole situation that much more frustrating. Update: was contacted about the issue. Very professional, and much appreciated.",,,
24,Michael M.,"Rochester, NY",1,12,2,1.0,11/15/2017,"Waitress tried to convince me that the four vegetables (as stated on the menu) missing from the dish I ordered were on my plate, when they obviously were not. She insisted over and over the vegetables were on my plate, but could not point to them. Just what every customer wants when they come to enjoy a meal, to be spoken to like you don't know the difference between vegetables and NOTHING!Insulting and infuriating. Very unprofessional. The place was empty except for us and two people at the bar telling each other stories. We should have known the locals knew enough not to eat there. Food was awful. Staff was condescending and rude. We will never go back.",1,3,1

26,John Y.,"New York, NY",55,149,557,2.0,8/28/2015,"The place has indoor and outdoor seating. I sat outdoors and the table is very small.There is a small menu with the typical bar type food - wings, dips, burgers, and salads. I ordered the tuna skewers, tuna salad, artichoke and spinach dip. The dip is a big portion and was too much for 2 people. Its more like for 4 people. I should have ordered wings, instead.The tuna skewers were okay, nothing amazing. It was bland. The salad could have been presented better and in a larger plate. I've had better food, maybe I should have selected to usually bar food - wings and burgers.",2,,
27,Mor R.,"Manhattan, NY",150,39,2,1.0,12/31/2017,"My friends and I came as a group, a few of us went to the front to ask if we would all be let in since they were crowded, and they said yes. They took money from four of us ($80 cover charge between the four of us) and then kicked one of our group members out! When we asked what happened, they refused to say and refused to refund the four of us with the money we had paid because they said it didn't matter that one person got kicked out because the rest of us could stay (despite the bouncer who refused to let anyone else in!) So four of us were inside with the rest of the group despite them telling us we could all get in and refusing to tell us why they kicked anyone out.  Therefore they refused to refund the four of us, taking our money knowing we wouldn't stay in if our entire group wasn't let in.",,,
28,Dani P.,"Bronx, NY",32,49,44,4.0,10/23/2017,Really loved the ambience here. A cool neighborhood bar with plenty of space. We went on a quiet Sunday and enjoyed 3 beers each and an appetizer of BBQ wings. The sauce was delicious. I had the grilled chicken sandwich which was a little dry but the fries were really good. There's also some scary infused liquors in a giant vat. Cucumber Jalapeño Vodka and Pineapple Chipotle Tequila. We tried the tequila and it was smooth and smoky. Our bartender TC (I think her name was) was super cool and informative when we asked about the infusion liquors. Food came super quick and there was a nice open mic by 7pm. Great place! Will return!,1,,
29,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,2.0,5/7/2016,I visited this place for a meet up on a Wednesday evening and it is your typical no frills type bar on the UES. I will say that beer pipes may need some servicing because I ordered Sam Adams summer ale and it tasted like crap as did the pint of Magic Hat #9. Be aware that some nights the bar has live music and it can get pretty loud.,3,,
30,Elena R.,"Woodbury, NY",0,2,0,5.0,4/9/2018,I celebrated my 25th birthday here and had such a good night. The session 73 staff coordinated with me for weeks before and made everything so easy despite me being really annoying with all my questions. I was so impressed to see signs that marked i had a roped off area in my name for me and my friends. We had such an amazing time feeling like VIPs. That was a lot of their first times going to session 73 and they all said they can't wait to come back. I will definitely be recommending it as the party space of choice for birthdays for a long time!,1,,

32,Marissa K.,"Manhattan, NY",107,192,54,4.0,3/14/2016,"I was a scene kid in high school.  I went to shows at least once a weekend, I wore mostly black, I had a scene kid haircut, and I almost exclusively dated guys in bands. Or at least guys who were all about the music.These days, I am more into accountants. But, I hold affirmatively that when I do find someone good enough to date, they need to be at least a little punk rock.I feel like that is my relationship with Session 73.  We are both mainstream now, but we are still just a little punk rock.Now is a good time to mention I have only ever been there late Friday/Saturday nights.So, Session is my spot.  I LOVE it.  A few months back, I convinced a group of friends to go, saying that they have the best cover bands that do a lot of 80's/90's/00's covers. When we get there I was immediately elated--they were doing The Cure.  I rock my face off, and look back at my friend who says to me ""I thought you meant, like, Spice Girls.""Woops.  I am talking about a lot of pop-punk (blink 182), some grunge (4 non blondes, nirvana), some oldies(billy joel, bruce), some poser-punk that I used to hate but now I like (yellowcard), etc, etc.  There a few different bands and some are more mainstream than others, but I really enjoy them all.The drinks are decently priced, I wanna say 7 or 8 for a whiskey ginger.  No cover.  Its usually not crazy crowded, though the most recent time I went it was.  If you want to rock out, get your dance on, go there.  Surprisingly, the crowd is pretty bro-ish.  I say surprisingly because of the music that is played.  It's like when the popular kids would come to a show in HS and its like GET OUT OF HERE THIS IS MY THING.  But, alas, perhaps bro-ish bars are also my thing now.",1,1,1

We had wings and OMG they were amazing, like better then BWW/Wingstop. I was really surprised that the place was empty since the food was great and so was the customer service.

Her bill was $4.50 of which she handed Vincent $5. He took the money, closed the cash register and then attended to another patron. When she asked for her change; he ignored her then looked at her as if she was stupid. She asked if there was a problem,why she didn't get her change. He rolled his eyes, opened the cash register and threw some change at her, sarcastically saying ""I'm sorry I don't have any quarters"". When she asked again if there was a problem or if there was some sort of bar etiquette she wasn't aware of; he proceeded to say ""you're still talking!! SHUT UP"" and continued to attend to the other patrons. At that point she asked for a manager and someone named Dan came out to speak with her but no remorse was shown.

36,Samiah Z.,"Manhattan, NY",48,3,0,1.0,10/28/2017,"This review is for their ""private event"" option. I did do a search here before holding an event and didnt find anything. Hopefully this helps someone else. I strongly recommend against holding a private event here. There is an open bar option when you select for a private event. It's described as including "" a selection of domestic, import and craft beer"" but at the event we  were only offered Bud Light and Miller Light. Further it includes ""an unlimited amount of cocktails made with call or house brand alcohol"" (and I'm quoting from the contract), however, again the selection was minimal. It also indicated ""one or two white/red wine and we received precisely one of each (cab and pinot grigio). The description of the ""open bar"" option is incredibly misleading and I would suggest you ask exactly what all it entails should you decide to hold your event here. The food options were fine.There was an initial glitch with our food order (apparently the staff wasn't aware that we had switched out an item, though we had conveyed this to their event planner beforehand), however they did correct after I told them so. Finally, our server was incredibly dour, was not versed in the ins and outs of our package and also proceeded to spill red wine on me and two of my guests, with no further apologies or offers to send over our dry cleaning bill. I did reach out to the event planner afterwards to offer her or her manager a chance to explain. Nothing back on that end unfortunately. Will not be holding any more or recommending this place for private events.",,1,

I walk in and the space was great. The instructor was awesome. The music however was really bad. There was no band which would of been okay if they spun a great salsa playlist but I don't even think they had a DJ. They were playing some sort of  wired sudo salsa fusion songs that had hints with reggaeton and cumbia. It was so narly to dance to, not true salsa. After class was over, we danced a few songs and waited around for maybe 30 minutes hoping the music would get better but it didn't. We just walked out.  Had been hoping for an awesome eve of dancing.

We had so much fun dancing with random strangers and the Bartender Tom was very attentive and kept our glasses full the whole time we were there. They have $6 margaritas and sangria all night which is just fine by me! Tom's Margaritas are extremely strong and are fresh none of that sour mix stuff.

There is also a side area they open that's not as loud on busy nights. We wanted to have conversation - and The night we went / early in the week, a female vocalist with a super voice was singing. Also a good spot for a company meet up.  We were there the same night a company was having a get together so we were at a table that after about 30 people came in we at our little bar table became the only ones not a part of the large group ... Lucky us in making a toast the company exec included us - beckoning/ glancing with a look...  how nice?? :/ I wasn't sure if that was a friendly hey leave our area cue like we were crashing the party despite being there before they arrived but we in friendly spirits toasted with them, even applauded the guys toast ha and then I asked the bartender if this was a private party or there was another area we should sit/ if we should move ... He assured us we were good and despite the busy (friendly) company crowd Jason the bartender and one of the other guys were so sweetly attentive. A bar back saw me trying to charge my phone in a non working outlet and kindly took it to a spot up front to charge for me. Another guy not even a bartender behind the bar brought me extra olive juice for my dirty martini and when I forgot to get it from the bar he walked it out to me... And Jason the bartender despite busy busy working the company crowd almost solo at the bar came To our table to check on us a couple times. I was impressed .. Jason recommended the loaded nachos with pulled pork which were so so loaded and so amazing ! The brussel sprouts were also great, cooked and flavored just right. Music was wonderful. Drinks were great and when I wanted my martini dirtier they brought more juice . Plump fresh olives.Highly recommend as a fun casual Ues spot with live music. Fantastic friendly service.

She asked if everything was ok, and I told her the truth - it wasn't that great. She asked specially what I didn't like about it and apologized profusely. She took it off my tab and bought me a drink to make up for it. I've been in customer service for over 12 years and THIS is how you treat customers!! Christina gets it.

We should have listened to the other table instead of being so stubborn.  The food TRICKLED out of the kitchen...plate by plate.  It took over an hour to get our food. I ordered chicken fingers and fries, while my girlfriend had the nachos.  I never received my fries.   The chicken fingers were so cold they were inedible.  Oddly my teammate ordered wings...half were cold half were hot.  THAT scared me... The nachos were straight out gross.  My girlfriend ate some of them just because she was so hungry and needed something in the tank.  I NEVER send food back, but this time I just couldn't deal with it. I told the waitress I didn't want it.  She was a sweet heart and told me she will get a manager....we waited...and waited...to the point where I got up and left to get food elsewhere.  In fact, most of the people we spoke to had to leave to go get food.  All in all I don't see myself ever going back.  I do not recomment this place to anyone.",5,,

The waitress was very attentive and sweet. Second time was for Father's day brunch. This time they had someone playing a bluesy guitar. They need more waitresses or atleast a host early in the day.,,,
45,Mary N.,"Flushing, NY",275,73,94,5.0,5/21/2016,"I came on a Saturday night for my friend's birthday and had a BLAST! I arrived a little after 11pm and there was no cover charge. Even though the bar is pretty large with 2 different bar/music areas, it was packed with people and difficult to maneuver. However, the music and vibes made dealing with the crowds worthwhile. I can't tell you how awesome the music was...it was one hit after the other! The DJ in the back room played awesome 90's throwbacks and '00s pop hits. Me and my friends belted out every lyric and didn't stop dancing the entire night. When we wanted a little break from the back, a live cover band played in the front area. They were really talented with great voices singing some more hits that we enjoyed.Considering the bar was packed, the bartenders attended to me quickly and were friendly, which was greatly appreciated. Definitely will hit Session 73 again soon!",,,
46,Melissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",244,545,8,3.0,1/29/2017,"This bar isn't one of my favorites but it serves it purpose well. I like that there's a ton of space here. I was here with a big group for someone's birthday and it was nice that there was plenty of room and easy access to the bar for everyone. The well drinks were $8. It's a pick a mixer and a liquor type of bar. There is plenty of seating around which is also nice. The music is way too loud but this is mostly to be expected. I've heard bands sometimes come here and I think that the space is nice for a small group with live music so I'd love to check that out. The wait staff was pretty rude to my friend who needed to sit down due to a medical condition so minus one star for that. If you want a cheap bar with well drinks for a large party on the UES then this place serves that purpose and you'll have a great time with plenty of dancing! I did enjoy my time here because I was here for exactly that. If you're coming here for any other purpose, find somewhere else.",,,
47,S W.,"Manhattan, NY",21,77,18,1.0,9/27/2016,"This place has the worst management I have ever seen in the area.  They continually disappoint, over and over again.  I went for their Monday Salsa night and I have to say it was one of the worst experiences I've had with them of many bad experiences.  I run a happy hour group on the Upper East Side and we typically try to work with Bars that we see are empty to bring business to our local community. So I had about 10 members come to the salsa event.  Upon arrival at 7pm for their salsa event you see a sign that says. Class is delayed and starts at 8pm.  No mention on their website, no nothing except last minute notification when you get there.  Things happen, they had a special event,  no worries.  Then we are told that some of their drink specials apply but all the food options, like their $2 tacos are not available nor are some of their drinks specials.   Apparently their private party ordered all the tacos they had in stock.  You knew you were having a special event and you didn't prepare for that and the possible demand from your salsa event? Poor management. So I understand that you run out of tacos, so discount something else on your menu.  Nope... flat out refusal by the manager on duty.  Again poor management.  It's 8pm, no salsa instructor till around 815 830. By this time some of my happy hour members leave out of disgust. The other half stay.  The sound system is poorly configured. Either you can't hear the instructor or the music is too soft.  Poor management and oversight. Then the presidential debate is on and we ask if we can listen to the debate after the class and dancing end.  Sorry, the sound system blew out from another end. The bartender luckily made the effort and tried to put on closed captioning. This place is empty almost every night I pass by.  The management is horrible and it's the reason this place with such potential is such a dump.  The positive reviews are from people who throw private events, and maybe that's done right but you are loosing potential loyal bar customers on a daily basis.  As far as I'm concerned you don't deserve to stay in business.  You also have 10 people part of a happy hour group who will now spread their experience to other people in our group on the UES.If you go for the free salsa class, stop yourself and go to Taj on Monday's, which is what we did when we left.   They don't deliver what they advertise on their website. And they have no ownership when it comes to mistakes and they don't offer a remedy to show they are sorry about the issues they are responsible for.  Management...fail.Salsa event...fail. Food...decent.Waitress...decentBartender...decent.  I'd rate this place a zero stars if that was an option.",4,1,

Good to go with a group of people if you want to hear live music and be able to dance, because this place does have a dance floor and does host decent bands. The misses would be that it's almost impossible to tell what the crowd is going to be like - seems like it's either a young fratty crowd OR a much older early-bird-special crowd. No offense meant to either demographic, it's just hard to tell what the vibe is going to be.Food is mediocre, service usually okay. Helpful to show up already a few drinks in.",2,,

54,Cindy Y.,"Woodside, NY",48,23,2,1.0,3/11/2016,"Sadly disappointing bar/restaurant (really? a restaurant?)You would think you would find a pretty decent place to grab some food and a drink along 1st ave covered in different restaurants offering different cuisines. I was gifted a groupon from a friend who thought it'd be nice to try new places near my new job. So I invited my best friend and her beau along for bite and a drink. I called ahead to ask if a reservation was required with a groupon the guy said over the phone that it was recommended so I gave him my name and mentioned that I had a groupon to use. Once we arrived the place was pretty much empty except for two or three tables outside and one table inside with a couple. It was dark and the furniture was rundown but didn't put me off because I was hopeful that the service and food would make up for it. It seemed they only had one waitress working that night which explained why everything took soooo long. It took her forever to greet us and take our order. And then she wouldn't come back for like 20 minutes. At one point we had even ordered wings that she completely forgot to put in to the kitchen so low and behold we never got them. Then once ready to order dinner she informs us they ran out of brisket. REALLY? On a Thursday night? She apologized saying that they ran out. Then when I ordered a steak sandwich she says that there is only one person in the kitchen working and that he doesn't want to go through the hassle of prepping the steak and that he doesn't have it. So which is it? That he doesn't have steak or he doesn't want to make it?Then she pretty much recommended the appetizers and the pizzas. Sounds more like they don't want people using groupons to consume certain things on the menu. We ended up ordering burgers that took 45 MINUTES to get to our table. The burgers were pretty average. Nothing to make up for the sub par service.It was FAIL after FAIL. Honestly, never had such an awful experience at a restaurant. I was taken aback and really dissatisfied. Maybe for a drink or two or to hear some music but otherwise steer clear of the food and the table service. Not worth it. Even with a deal. I can't imagine having to pay full price on that meal. That would've been the real tragedy.",6,,

Though probably one of the most affordable bars on the UES, our time at Session 73 wasn't anything special or worth returning. The crowd on St. Patty's Day was lacking--which probably should have been our first hint to find another spot on one of the biggest drinking days of the year-- the drinks were poor quality, and the food was very very mediocre bar food.

Prices were reasonable.Even after the event ended, the majority of our party hung around for the live band they had. The band was a 90's cover band and was very interactive with the crowd. Overall the crowd was perfect for our party (mid 20's to young 30's). Good mix of guys and girls. Crowded but not packed.Highly recommend and would strongly consider doing future events there.",,,

The music is great, always a mix of classic rock, 80's 90's and today that has us singing and dancing all night. Aside from the music the decor at Session 73 is a refreshing change for all the dive/college/sports bars that are all over the upper east side. The staff here is also very friendly, after the first few times we came here we were on a first name basis with most of the staff and they even remember our drink of choice, ask for Chachi and Lauren.

It's traditional american fair, but everything is souped up 3 or 4 notches. I used to go here for the entertainment, the great vibes, and the ambiance.

The ONLY reason this place gets any stars is because of the music. I force myself to tune out the obnoxious a-hole patrons and the nastiest, rudest bartender I have ever met so that I can enjoy some good music.

On first impression, I just saw a cute restaurant with candle-lit tables, and thought hmm this place would be good for a dinner date, not a bar scene! But I was happy to find out that is only one part of Session 73- there's a huge other room for the bar/live band, and another whole room for a bar/lounge/dance area. I loved that depending on the song the band was singing or the vibe we were feeling, we could easily switch to a different room to change up the scene. I loved the songs they were playing in the dance room, my kind of club music. In the other room, wasn't the best live band I've seen, and a little loud / hard to hear over your friends talking over the music, but it was still an enjoyable experience. I was surprised it was kind of dead there even around 11pm..it took until about 12 to get more crowded (I guess because the band started around then).

68,E R.,"Manhattan, NY",39,134,32,3.0,8/12/2014,"My night here initially started off very badly and I was planning on giving 1 star but by then end it got a little better. I went on mon for the salsa night.  Online it says it starts at 8:30.  There is a sign in the place that says it starts at 8.  The lesson actuallly went from about 9-10.  Online they advertise their happy hour specials. There is no mention of a $10 cover.  I didn't want to pay (at 8:30) cause it was totally dead.  It was also very very hot. I was sweating.  Not a good look. Especially considering it was empty.  I asked for a glass of water and she said $3.  Not allowed to serve tap water.  This really bothers me for some reason. Keep in mind its like 95 degrees.  I was getting cranky now.  I finally sucked it up and paid the $10 cover since I went all the way there.     So here i am, learning salsa moves in 95 degree heat.  I want to kill whoever owns this place for making me pay $3 for water and having us dance in such awful heat. I was consdiering just leaving after 5 min.  There were about 10 of us at the lesson.  I hate when you have to dance with random people.  My husband and I just wanted to dance together   We got 2 shots and a water for $20.  Ok not that bad actually.  They teach ny salsa which is like the opposite of every other kind of salsa.  I'm used to taking salsa in either the caribbean or DC, where the girl steps back as the first step.  This was the opposite. Whatever.  We only learned basic steps which we already knew anyway, I wouldn't go back for the lesson.  thank god they finally turned on the ac.Around 10, when the lesson was over the band was playing and there were lots of people on the dance floor. But by then we needed to leave to go to work the next day.  So the last part was fun, but there were a lot of issues initially . I would come back around 10 again maybe 1 night if I could.  I'm kinda torn if I should give this place 2 or 3 stars.",1,,

The food was also quite good; the nachos are huge, delicious, and well priced, and the Jerk Chicken Satay was fun and delicious, with a perfect match between the jerk spice and the ranch-based dipping sauce.I was a bit confused/disappointed, as the restaurant advertises itself as ""American Tapas"" or ""Tapas-Style""...The food did not resemble any sort of shareable foods except that much of it came on skewers; The prices also didn't seem to reflect the supposed ""tapas"" style either. We were there on a slow weekend (July 4th) so I can excuse that it felt a bit slow and dead - I've seen first hand that on other weekends it can get quite packed, and I do plan on returning for a busier, more lively night. That being said, our waitress was downright useless; she could barely answer questions about the food, and despite there being under 10-15 people in the restaurant, service was slow, and she was very, very inattentive.

84,Kelly B.,"Mount Baldy, CA",26,29,1,4.0,7/9/2013,"A convenient bar for those of us living on the UES who don't want the pretentiousness of other bars in the area. I love Tuesdays because of the 2-for-1 ladies night and live music. There's always something going on there when I pass by, and it's a very spontaneous decision to go in. The staff is always incredibly nice and helpful for us (one of the bartenders experiments with drink recipes and will try to find something to suit your taste if it's not too busy). The France fries are delicious and I recommend trying them if you're there.",2,1,
85,Jiordan C.,"Manhattan, NY",67,142,490,4.0,11/21/2011,"Groupon brought me to Session 73, so much of my review won't involve their prices (which, given the deal, were awesome). That being said, their selection of tapas is excellent and the setting is really ready for anything - whether it's a late lunch or a casual date, whatever.So I brought my mom for a belated birthday dinner and we loved it. We had a funny combination of things, something like chicken fingers, tuna skewers, steamed shrimp shumai, and fried ice cream.The chicken fingers were made somewhat unique by a nice array of dipping sauces, while the skewers and shumai stood very well on their own. The fried ice cream was great - a little different than I'm used to - and surprisingly light.It's a fairly convenient location on the upper east side anyway, so yeah, I'd definitely come back.",1,,

Recently I had them host my 30th birthday party on New Years Eve and was beyond impressed with how accommodating, professional, and down to earth they were. All of the staff including the owner and manager were present and checking in on us all night to make sure everything was running smoothly. We used the room in the front where they took out some tables and set up a bar inside. We also brought a makeshift photo booth in for my guests. They transformed their normal dining space into a perfect party place with easy access to the band. I would highly recommend Session for not only a fun night out but for your next private event, whatever it may be! They really work with you to create exactly what you need to make your event a success!Thank you session73 for the greatest birthday present, a perfect party!Feel free to message me with any questions!",4,1,2

I've been to plenty of clubs where it is so crowded it is awkward, but these people actually shoved you like with the open palms of their hands and full force. There were bouncers, and they were way way way beyond capacity. They really needed to stop letting people in.They also had a crappy band. Really crappy band. Musclebound balding guy in a tank top belting out country music was not my idea of fun. And they charged me $4 for a diet coke when they had a $3 special on liquor drinks for our party.

Lots of fun events. Service is god awful though. They should stop hiring guys who think they are hot-shit and start hiring people who know how to be a waiter.

95,Iona K.,"New York, NY",32,16,4,1.0,12/20/2015,"So my friend and I came to Session 73 for a painting class.  The class started at 2pm so we decided to come in early to eat at the restaurant prior to the class.  Well I called 2 weeks before to make a reservation and was told that no reservations were needed.  So we both arrived at 12:15 to the restaurant being closed.  Now on the restaurant's website it states that the place opens @ 11:30am. When we spoke to a guy who worked here I am guessing he was the manager he told us that they do not open until 12:30 and there was no reservations for us he was very rude and abrupt.  When we tried to explain that when we called we was told no reservation was needed and the guy we spoke to did not tell us that the restaurant opened later then what was stated on the website yet again the manager was rude.  He acknowledged that the website was wrong and he was not ready to accommodate customers.  The issues I have here are one if the restaurant opens at a different time then listed on the website this should have been communicated we I called to make the reservation. Second the manager's attitude was very inappropriate, everytime my friend tried to speak he rudely cut her off and assumed all of her questions.  My friend and I went to Bareburger across the street and the food was great. The only reason why we went back to Session 73 is because of the painting class, other then that I would not patronize this place.  Note to management, update your website to reflect accurate information. Also your staff needs to have customer service training because clearly this is a sorely lacking trait here at Session 73.  The one star is only because I could not give zero stars.",2,,

She took so long in between drinks we contemplated buying our own bottle at the corner bodega. So, we attempted to drown our disgust in wine and then we ordered the artichoke dip and it came out looking like slime from the ghostbusters movies. GROSS! $13!! Good Joke!! Finally, the busboy ""man"" was even worse if that's possible. He was so incredibly glib with me and when he spilled water ALL over my dress he did not even apologize or clean it up.

One very sad Spanish bar on Cinco de Mayo.There was probably less than 10 customers in the whole place at any given point, and our waitress in the restaurant area was incredibly sour faced and unfriendly- I don't think she smiled even once. So unnerving.The food was decent but definitely nothing to write home about. The menu doesn't exactly scream ""tapas"" with things like sweet potato fries, hummus and pita, cheese fondue and pork dumplings...I know server types hate customers using groupons, but I spent an additional $70, not including tip (which was more than generous despite my far less than satisfactory experience) so I was hoping that would at least bring up my status from groupon-scumbag to paying-customer.The two bartenders, though, are a different story- they were really nice and friendly, and made pretty decent margaritas.

IT gets crowded, but never unbearable, and its close to the bathrooms.  The drinks are good at normal nyc prices. On the weekends, there's usually a live band plays in the front of main room.  The front area bar is much bigger, there are high top tables, a stage for the band and lots of room to dance.  The live band is always really good and draws a good crowd.  I like this place a lot and i continue to come here on the weekends for 2 reasons: its never really a bridge and tunnel crowd and there's always 2 different types of music to listen/dance to.",3,,

Being that I'm in my late 20s, married, didn't go to a state school, and was never really a big partier, maybe it's not totally fair for me to rate this place, but I'm going to try anyway.I came with my hubby, our good friend, and a bunch of his friends that we were meeting for the first time. It was virtually impossible to really mingle or make conversation with anyone because it was so loud and crowded that we were constantly getting pushed into one another and/or having to move out of the way so others could squeeze by. I wanted to try to make the best of it and got myself tipsy enough to dance (because what else can you do in a place like this?), but, other than a few sloppy drunk girls, almost no one else was actually dancing. Different strokes for different folks, I guess, but I just don't see the appeal of having to work so hard to hold your ground or carry on a conversation.On the plus side, the drinks seemed pretty strong and there were lots of attractive, young single people, if that's what you're looking for.  For better or worse, it felt just like the bars my little sister took me to last time I visited her college campus.",7,4,2

When I was handed back my credit card it was layered in gunky old spilled liquor from where she placed it. Reasonably, I took the towel that was right in front of my face to wipe the credit card. That's when the bartender went out on an all out assault about me not using the towel (what?????). In response, I took the tip down a notch because this isn't what I perceive to be good customer service. Now I'm looking on my statement to see that I was charged a flat $99 (don't think i'd notice if it doesn't reach triple digits, huh?) when the real total came to $84.

Crowd is *really* young (with exception of a few people who were *really* old). Live band was good but the music was a touch too loud for the small space...like they crossed over that fine line between rocking good time and bleeding ear drums. Drinks were fine and pretty cheap for NYC ($22 for two mixed drinks and a wine). I have to tell you about the ""hostess."" She was a mess. She looked like a slob, had a puss on her face the entire time, she was rude when we politely asked if there was a place to store a bag (my friend had just arrived from out of town) and gave us a similar sneer when we asked about sitting in the completely empty restaurant section, which later filled up with bridge and tunnel kids. Granted, I may have been pressing my luck when I asked her a third and final question about the start time of the band. The web site advertised the band started at 10:30 so around 10:40, I asked her about this (also politely, since my strategy was to kill her with kindness). She told me ""no, they start at 11:30"" and didn't seem to know/care that Sessions even has a web site.  Oh, and then she proceeded to glare at me like I stole her boyfriend. Yikes.",7,7,

The lead singer had long, black wiry hair; tattoos on his arms; and wore a black tank. Kept trying to get the ladies to dance by pointing at the cougars and random blonde drunk chicks. It was entertaining. The front bar area had a very large space for groupies and dancing. I was surprised by the second bar in the back playing top 40s music. The live band was much more entertaining to be around than the back.",1,3,1
124,Jonathan M.,"Hoboken, NJ",28,160,65,3.0,1/31/2012,"I've been here a couple times for drinks on the weekend, and once for food during the week.  I think Sessions 73 fits nicely into the Upper East Side.  For folks who live around the area, it's a nice spot to go out for drinks on the weekend and catch whatever band they have lined up for the evening.  Drink prices are reasonable, and they have a cool back room away from the band which is a little quieter.  This is nice addition if you are looking to have a low-key party/gathering for drinks.For eats, I came here expecting some regular bar food, but I was pleasantly surprised.  For the price, the quantities and quality was pretty solid.  The menu had a wide variety of items, ranging from healthy to typical bar food.  (ex: Chicken Quesadillas, Steak Kabobs, and Tuna Skewers).  For $11-$14, each of these were definitely worth the money.  Also, not a bad spot for some weekday evening drinks. Their beer, wine, cocktail menu was also pretty extensive. And the lighting was pretty dim in the dining area, so it gives off a slightly more intimate atmosphere.If you are looking for something local & new for dinner one night, I definitely suggest you give Sessions 73 a try.",,,
125,Jane N.,"Woodside, NY",0,4,0,5.0,9/10/2012,"Just had my 30th birthday party here, and it was perfect! The layout of the venue was exactly what I was looking for. The atmosphere was candlelit and loungey and our table was set up on one side, where it was relatively quiet and my guests could talk without yelling. But right around the corner on the other side, there was a packed dance floor with an awesome live band! After enjoying an array of delicious drinks and food (cheese fondue!) and catching up with my guests, we danced the night away!  Meredith, the event coordinator, was super accommodating. I pre-ordered some appetizer platters in advance, and she made sure they came out to our table gradually as my guests arrived. She didn't even mind when I realized that I had ordered too much and had to reduce my order. :) Overall, highly recommend this venue for a party. Their prices are very reasonable, and the drinks strong and delicious. Although I didn't take advantage of this, they also offer open bar/appetizer packages if you have 15 or more people.  I'll definitely be back again!",,,

128,Christie B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,8/8/2014,"Favorite spot on the UESI've lived in the UES for the last 3 years and been to most of the bars in the area for at least one drink.... none of them have gotten me hooked quite like Sessions. After only a few times there the staff knew my friends and I by name and made sure we were always taken care of! The live bands are always GREAT and it is the best spot to have a fun late night dance and yell/sing session. During the week it is perfect after a long day of work to grab a beer and just relax. Being from Florida originally, I have a lot of friends stay with me when they come to town and I have taken every single one to Sessions. Most tourists would want to check out more than one place while on a trip, but we end up at Sessions every night even if only for a last stop before crashing.It's definitely my MacLarens/Cheers/any other tv show bar that the characters basically live in.",,,

On a Saturday night this place gets so packed you can barely move- it reminds me of bars I used to go to when I was a college freshman still using a fake ID.... Not so fun at the age of 28. Good place for you boys out there to hit up at 3am- you're sure to find some drunken girls who may be willing to have a slumber party.

That being said, what I really like about this place is the music.  On Wednesday nights they feature original music by various artists, usually they will play for about an hour each.  The talent I've seen here has been great, and the stage is well situated.  Not sure what the capacity is but, your pretty much packed around 75 - 100 people.  Plus, no cover on Wednesdays (not sure about the other nights.)",,,

What a nice guy!I was however disappointed at the sliders I ordered... they were RIDICULOUSLY small for what I had to pay for them... $11 for 3 sliders smaller than the size of my palm (and my hands are pretty small).

The music is a bit loud, but that is to be expected at a bar.We ordered chips & guacamole, salad, fondue and cheese pizza.  I thoroughly enjoyed the pizza and chips/guacamole. The fondue was served with very fresh fruit and toasted bread bites, delicious.  My biggest criticism of the entire meal is that the salad was way too overdressed, which was unfortunate because the produce in the salad was very fresh and didn't need to be drenched in dressing/oil.",,,

They had this cocktail that included beef broth, but unfortunately it wasn't available when I tried to order it. I got a vodka cranberry, which was fine. I also had the regular pizza at the bar, and it was pretty good.

My date and I sat outside at the sidewalk tables, which was why we even stopped there. The live band was pretty bad, and was easily heard through the door.Drinks were unimpressive and expensive ($11 - $13) for what they were. Wine was also $8 - $13 a glass, and also unimpressive. All were very fruity (which is just not my thing). Beer selection was basic (Magic Hat, Blue Moon, Bud, Heineken) and around $6 (and came in a plastic glass). At least the wine didn't.There are plenty of other outdoor seating bar/ restaurants on the UES that would've been better. This place is fine, just really not worth it.",,,

The bar was way over capacity, the crowd was college students barely 21 or underage. The males sexually harassed every other girl in the bar and could not hold their alcohol. Granted this was all at around 10:30pm, meaning all of them continued to be served the rest of the night. I believe overall there was one bouncer at the door and no one could patrol any area since it was so crowded... Not safe.

The staff has always been incredibly accommodating and the vibe has always been a blast, thanks in large part to the live music. Our volunteers range in age from their mid-twenties to their late sixties, but between the good food (my personal favorites are the chicken fingers and the pizzas), great cocktails and laid back lounge atmosphere, there is always something that appeals to everyone in our group.

148,Juliet A.,"Washington, DC",420,1039,974,3.0,9/14/2008,"3 out of 4 stars ain't too shabby. Definitely has the potential to be 4 stars, but I haven't always had a great time when I've gone so...3 stars it is.Session 73 has a lot going for it. It really tries to be different than the rest of the UES bars (although it attracts the same type of person - namely the mid-twenties yuppie who wants to be seen as the hottest commodity in town). There is no cover charge, which is fantastic, as there is (usually) always LIVE MUSIC playing! Live music, how'd you like them apples?! Disclaimer -- just because there is a band doesn't mean it's worth staying and listening. Mostly young-ish boys trying to be all edgy and cool with their cover version of Sublime or Dave or deliciously cheesy 80's rock. Don't expect to see any up-and-coming rock stars playing here. But I love free music (most of the time) so no complaints from me. Another plus that I have yet to take advantage of (although I fully intend to) is the Sunday night Tango and Tapas. $10 gets you a tasting of tapas along with a tango lesson (all levels of dancers). Anyone want to try it with me? :) The drinks are average, maybe even a tad overpriced. I usually don't end up staying for the long haul, but it is a good place to hit on a night of bar-hopping. In my opinion, Session 73 is best with a group, or at least, more than 2 people :)  I have come with a birthday party crew twice, and always had fun on those occasions. OH and how could I forget - my work holiday party was at Session last December! We had the side room to ourselves and never felt like the space was encroached upon by the revelers on the other side. The food they provided was also really, really yummy.",,,

I haven't been here in years but just spent a saturday night here with some girlfriends and had so much fun I haven't danced that much in ages. The crowd is high energy and the music was a blast(who doesn't love 80s classics and top 40 all in one). The bartender chachi makes killer drinks and never let my cup go empty. The bathroom attendant is a nice touch and I really appreciated the free gum and cleaner bathroom. We didn't come hungry but the food in the menu looked good. I might have to take my husband here for a weekday date night in the lounge. My girlfriend Laura said a friend of hers went on a blind date here and is marrying him in a few weeks so there are clearly some romantic vibes in the air. We ended up leaving around 2 am and the crowd seemed busier then when we got there! It was such a fun night and totally worth the not so fun morning.",,,

After an evening of drinks and good music, I am happy to report that this place is pretty solid.First off, there's a HUGE amount of space. They have a regular bar area, a restaurant space and a private bar in the back. When I was there, it wasn't that crowded in the front but there was some private party going on in the back and it seemed pretty packed. The drinks were slightly on the expensive side (no surprise here) but the bartenders were friendly and attentive; I never waited more than 30 seconds before I was acknowledged and served.Oh yeah, the pizza...We ordered a cheese pizza to munch on with our drinks and I was SHOCKED by how good this thing was. I don't know what they put on their pie but it was friggin delicious! About four people in my group munched on this thing and everyone kept raving about the taste. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't the best pizza ever or anything but it was definitely way above the quality I would expect from a place like this. Definitely recommended!So, all in all, I had a good experience at Sessions and would probably go back if I were in the area. I didn't really catch a fratty vibe while I was there but maybe the crowd varies with the night...I'll have to go back and see.",1,1,1

It's big enough so that it never gets to the point where you literally cannot move. I would definitely recommend this place for a group of friends if you're in the mood to dance at a lower key place!

I had movie plans later that evening, so why not take this opportunity to grab some drinks and appetizers right?  When I first walked in I noticed to the left a huge room with a bar and lots of standing area.  In the other room to the right was a seating area with lots of tables and comfy couches.  More comfortable to look at because you sink into them! not a good look when you're drinking Merlot ;)  there are no meals, only appetizers..which was great for us.  We ordered streak quesdilla and chicken burger sliders.  Very delicious.  The staff was nice, really enjoyed coming here in the late afternoon!  Now, I am curious to what the night life is like there...",,,1
170,Formicas F.,"Queen Creek, AZ",41,383,28,3.0,4/25/2008,"Showed up with a group of 4 for drinks and dessert and were seated in the bar area.  This was fine until the music started- it was TOO LOUD!  The wines by glass were decent- we got happy hour specials $4 per glass before 8 pm!  The chocolate fondue was so/so- certainly not the best I have had.  The cheese fondue was mediocre also.  The breads and assortments of things to dip in the cheese fondue were a bit stale.  A good spot for dancing (they seemed to have a ""dance floor"" but no one was dancing while we were there).  Probably due to the style of music the band was playing- not very danceable but they were pretty decent.  I left with my ears ringing the music was so loud!",1,1,1
171,Jules L.,"New York, NY",87,16,2,2.0,3/4/2011,Restaurant side.  Overpriced bar food disguised by an upscale ambiance.  Jamaican jerk chicken satay was not jerked.  I thought the crab cake sliders were knish sliders.  Fried calamari was fried calamari.  Water was delicious.  One star + discretionary star for atmosphere.,,2,

174,Sarah B.,"Hoboken, NJ",53,168,2,3.0,5/5/2009,We came here for dinner on a Saturday night around 8:30. The place (including the bar) was fairly empty when we arrived and not much more crowded when we left. As we were there for dinner and not drinks this review is not of the bar.Our party of five was promptly seated in the nearly empty restaurant. I believe that was the only time that night we received any type of prompt service. The service was quite slow and the food came out extremely far apart-even for taps. The food was okay- nothing special but nothing bad either. I enjoyed the company and that in itself was enough to distract me from the poor service. I'm not sure that we'd go back again - at least until we've narrowed down everywhere else in the area.,,,
175,cherie y.,"San Francisco, CA",230,25,0,1.0,6/27/2010,"The food here is truly disgusting.  We tried several things, including the seared tuna --hunks of inedible, not fresh flesh festively stuck on skewers.  Pizza was the best thing we had and that was strictly mediocre.  Also, it's overpriced for the bad, bar food tapas it serves up.  There are too many good places in New York to waste a meal here.",2,,
176,Sharifa A.,"Chicago, IL",48,10,0,4.0,4/22/2011,"okay, so i actually went in for food and though they do not have an extensive menu, they have enough! we had:buffalo shrimp-just like the chicken it is in a sort of hot sauce & comes with blue cheese... this is a MUST HAVE!!!steak quesadilla-one word, yummmmmmm!nachos overload-this was cool... i am not a big nachos girl, but my sis loves them & she loves these so i am going to see they are great, cuase i pretty much think nachos everywhere tastes the same.crab cakes- really good... i love crab cakes & i love when u actually taste the crab!the drinks: STRONG! && half priced for happy hour!extra perks: live music!!the place is big too!! i noticed they had a private back room which would be great for an event. I might consider that for the future! :)",,,
177,Laurie M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,5.0,10/28/2011,"This place is a great local hangout.  Everyone always seems to be having a great time, both the customers and the bartenders.  The bartenders are quick, fun and aren't snobby like you'll find in most NYC bars. Also, good prices, and the food is awesome.  Most bars you'd just find pre- frozen fried food whereas at Session 73 everything seems cooked to order with fresh ingredients... (try the goat cheese salad, it was fantastic).Every time I've been the music has been fun, and it seems that the managers are definitely getting something right... Be back there soon:)",,,
178,Jennifer V.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,1,5.0,8/9/2011,"I can't say enough great things about this place!!! I started coming here as a convenient after-dinner spot for the live music and good (and cheap!) drinks. Every night there seems to be a different music genre, which I like. My favorite is the swing night, but I also love Wednesday nights when they have original music by local artists. All the musicians I've seen have been wonderful and it's so nice to have somewhere to listen to GOOD live music on the UES!It took me about 3-4 months to finally try the food, and once I did I was blown away. I hoped everything to be good, but it turned out it's MORE than just good! Everything I've tried so far from the menu is SO delicious and very reasonably priced. You get pretty generous portions, so most the tapas items can practically be a meal. Also, I recently rented out the back room for a party for my boyfriend's birthday and it was the PERFECT spot. Organizing everything with the staff was really easy - they were all so helpful and organized. We had lots of space, our own bar, and it felt like we were the only ones there! The night was a HUGE success and turned out to be so much fun! I love this place!",,,

181,Jennifer K.,"San Diego, CA",118,601,26,5.0,12/8/2008,"Slightly abnormal review, as we were there for a holiday party, and not a normal night, so everyone in the crowd knew eachother/it wasn't too packed/it was well controlled, etc.  Points for great music, coat check, not packing us in too tight, ALWAYS being able to get a drink at the bar.. and the food that was out for the party (esp the crab cakes) was right on for when you get a good buzz and get ravishingly hungry at 11pm :) We had a blast!",,,
182,Allan M.,"San Francisco, CA",90,214,23,4.0,9/14/2008,"I went to Session 73 just a few hours ago and had a really great time! This is my first trip to New York...so everything is just really fun right now...so I might be biased. I don't have much to compare this to...but I had fun and that's all that matters to me. I'm a little buzzed right now so don't mind me if I sound stupid. Anyways, I'm straight....but a guy gave me his number! Supposedly, I'm supposed to be flattered! And I am! Anyone who thinks I'm worth a number is cool in my book! I ordered three shots of Grey Goose and a Jack...it cost $34. Not bad at all. But then I ordered a Grey and Red Bull (Monster because they didn't have Red Bull) and that cost $12...that's a little too much for a drink like that. The music was pretty good here...and they had live music too! They played Madonna..which is hella good when I'm drunk. I had an amazing time dancing to ""Like a Prayer""....made my NY experience that much better. I'd come here again because the crowd is cool and I had a good time. I love NY!",,,
183,Marshall H.,"New York, NY",72,259,1,3.0,10/17/2008,"I live in the neighborhood, and sometimes on a Friday or Saturday night after a few hours having drinks at my apartment, we'll get really lazy and we sometimes end up at ""Sessions""... I don't particularly like the place, but there is always a band playing covers -- but no cover to get in, which is nice.  It's just a good backup place to go when we aren't motivated enough to head downtown and want to hang out somewhere other than the typical sports bars in the Upper East Side 80s.Never gotten the food here, but I have sat in the lounge side and it's nice if you just want to kick back.  There's not much to this place though... it seems like there is always a pretty fair amount of underage kids there.  is that a plus or minus?  You be the judge...",,,

I also think the guy who manages the place is nice but it's strange!On Saturday nights, it is filled with people just out of college who are drunk and sweaty. On Sundays, you have people swing dancing. On occasion, they have good jazz music but make sure before you go that you check before heading there as you may be do some swing dancing!",,,
188,B ..,"New York, NY",16,287,0,3.0,1/29/2010,Cousin's surprise birthday soiree was a success! Cool joint to hide out in the back bar/lounge area where hors d'oeuvres were served. Music was not so good..they played Tupac and gangster rap which makes me wonder about the thought they put into dj'ing events like this.,1,1,1
189,Karin M.,"Venice, CA",61,35,2,1.0,5/24/2010,"ok, the bartender that works there on Wednesday nights thinks it's cool to get really really drunk and tell us about her drunky skanky ways while she serves us AWFUL ""free"" shots. then the dorky manager, Ryan, couldn't figure out how to work a gift certificate on the bar's computer. In the end, I hated the food, the service, and most of all, (not typical of me) the shots. Don't go there unless you want to hear a 21 year old tell you about  how she's wearing the clothes she wore last night to work .... SKANKY",,,1
190,H S.,"Boston, MA",49,379,8,4.0,12/7/2009,"I thought this place was a lot of fun. We came on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday and there was a great, large crowd. The band up in the front area was really good, though we were in the back section, where it was less noisy with less people. There's a bar in the back, too. Drinks are normal for the area, and actually strong. :) Big TV with the football game on and lots of room to sit and relax. Recommended for a group looking for a fun place to drink as this place is nice yet casual.",1,,
191,Jennifer R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,2,4.0,8/26/2012,I came here last night with a friend and we really enjoyed ourselves.  We arrived at 7pm and sat outside and ordered drinks and tapas.  I chose this place b/c I had a Groupon and I'm so glad I bought it.  The food and service was excellent.  We will return for sure.  We left by 10pm so we didn't stay for the crowd.  There was a bathroom attendant which I appreciated.  It seems like a great date place early in the evening and then a fun place for a group of people later.,,,
192,Dana P.,"San Jose, CA",3,56,0,3.0,8/13/2010,"This bar kind of has something for everyone.  The bar is divided in half, one side with a lounge and big couches and banquettes to sit and relax and talk.  The other side is a standard bar with a dance floor and a little stage for cover bands.  Some of the cover bands who play here are better than others, but it's nice that they don't charge a cover charge to see them.  It does get extremely crowded on Saturday nights though- the dance floor is way too small and the path to walk through the bar to the back for the bathrooms or the coat check in the winter is nearly impossible to navigate bc it's super narrow and there's so many people to push through.  I think they also have a private room in the back that you can reserve for parties, but I have never done this so I don't know any of the details.  Overall, it makes for a fun night out if you are prepared to get your feet stepped on!",,,
193,Dennis D.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,34,0,1.0,4/15/2013,"Don't go. Worst service experience I ever had. I don't mind the $8 coronas, guinness in plastic cups, or awful food enough to write a review but the terrible service did warrant it. Despite going on a dead Wednesday night and being the only 2 people at the bar, the bartender paid no attention and acted like she was being asked to donate a kidney if we asked if she would be so kind as to walk 2 feet to hand us the aforementioned overpriced beer or microwaved food. Again, this was annoying but not enough to warrant a review. After having about 5 beers each we asked for the check. I presume she thought we were drunk and wouldn't look at the check to find a random ""$4 drink"" charge on the bill. When I asked her what it was she didn't know what to say and after about 30 seconds of silence asked if we didn't have the ""green wrist bands"". Of course we did not have this imaginary charge so she assured us she would redo the bill. Still trying to not make too much of a bad experience I still gave her a tip. The next day I find out an additional random $20 charge was made. Furious, I called them for an answer. The woman who answered said she would deal with it when she could. I had had enough, told her that was unacceptable, but she did not seem to care. While I did receive an apology from someone else shortly after, the management and service here was reprehensible as they literally tried to steal money in an egregious fashion. Stay away.",4,,
194,Suzanne Y.,"Tampa, FL",4,21,1,1.0,3/26/2011,"This review is solely for my back-room joint birthday party experience with the DJ.  Management and bartenders and space get a solid 4 stars, but the d-bag playing music trumps the 4-star good time that would have been had.  Props for letting us reserve the space with no fee and having drink specials.  We only came here because my friend sharing birthday had been to a really fun party here before, so I was hoping for the same and for the most part it was pretty fun.  I guess the moral is I should have tried to bring my own DJ, don't know if this is possible here, but the guy had a major attitude and not in the way that it's ok to be an asshole because you are so good at it.  I'll admit my booze-fueled ranting at the time may have been exaggerated but my less-drunk friends agreed that this guy sucked.  He was not receptive at all to the dancing public, ALL of whom were there in the back because of our planned party.  He played strictly top 40 pop and wouldn't even give a little respect to or honor a request from me, a birthday girl, whose 50+ friends there were the only ones dancing to his shitty music. He was, is, apparently having some kind of mid-life crisis that made him decide to find a second career being a dick.  All he had to do was play one New Order song or perhaps offer a good suggestion instead and I would have been drunkenly placated. On the bright side, the manager that night was apologetic and offerred us shots for our frustrations, but it was too late and we went home.   I will gradually stop hating, but I doubt I'll come back.",2,1,

I come for dinner (yes, I use Groupons and therefore I'm sure I'm a second class citizen in their eyes) and I continue to be sorely disappointed. ""We forgot to order tuna this week"" was tonight's excuse. PLEASE! If it's too expensive then take it off the menu - or if you don't want to waste it on your Groupon customers then be honest.  But we forgot to order it - 3 times in the past month?

The crowd here was on the young side, but not frat-like, and I didn't feel like an old lady.  The bartender was great and her lemon drop martini knocked me on my ass.  I had to go home after ONE.   A mediocre band played, but there's something very unpretentious and homey-feeling about listening to an 80's cover band.   I'd go back the next time I'm hanging on the UES--whenever that may be!  Oh, also, guy at the door was very nice--no 'tude, which usually leads me to walk the other way.",2,,
