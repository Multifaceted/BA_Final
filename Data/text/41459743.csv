0,Kyu S.,"New York, NY",359,88,76,4.0,7/17/2018,"Tip: Head to the lines farther away towards the back of the restaurant for a shorter wait. There is a card minimum (I think $5? but unsure).I come here for breakfast pretty frequently. The bagels are pretty good & cheap! The lunch buffet seems a bit sketchy at times but I've ordered from the Korean menu closer to the windows in the front of the store several times from the Kimchi fried rice (surprisingly tasty & delicious and comes with miso soup on the side!) to the Yukgaejang (more veggies/content rather than broth) and the portions are generous, the food is cooked right in front of you, and the wait is never too long! There's also a larger seating area upstairs but it didn't seem too well-maintained when I went.",2,1,2
1,Emily W.,"Forest Hills, NY",69,111,752,2.0,8/23/2018,"This review is mostly for the buffet section. I used to come here for lunch almost everyday. Why? Because it was a lot cheaper than most buffet places in the area and I loved coming here! However, since they raised their prices, now it's the same as Delmonico's, I've stopped coming here. The food was not particularly delicious. It was pretty much average and the quality of their food has definitely gone down a bit. The food is dry and bland. I don't really know how else to describe it. I tried one of their sandwiches and it was pretty decent. So maybe I'll come back for that.",,,
2,Sophie Y.,"REGO PARK, NY",298,31,2,1.0,8/2/2018,"Got to say, use to love this place but it has really gone down the drain. They do not go by what their signs say anymore. I got a panini with soup today and got charged full price instead of the ""special combo"" shown outside. I went back in the ask and the cashier said she wasn't honoring it anymore. Hmm then maybe you should take it off. Needless to say even though some of the people there are nice, I would not be going back. I dont support bad businesses.",,,

I guess it's also good for people who are leaving to the airport because there is a shuttle service right next to the deli.They can grab something on the go and enjoy it on the shuttle.",2,1,2

Updated review","It's been 5 years since my last review of this place, but i probably still go here for lunch at least twice a week since i work a block away.   Overall the quality of food is still pretty decent with lots of choices, there are plenty of seats upstairs if you want to stay and eat and the service is pretty quick and friendly.  Being i'm on a health kick,  I usually go for the baked salmon, brown rice, sweet potatoes, corn, sliced avocado, and maybe some salad.  For Korean food lovers like myself, they also sell their own version of kimchi here.  A little package goes for $2 which is quite a steal.  Stay tuned for my next review in 2023.",,,
12,Sean E.,"Centerport, NY",198,246,127,1.0,1/9/2017,"I really truly hate to start off a review in the most overused and overdramatic way possible but... definitely never coming here again.Prior experiences had been mediocre at best - generally not worth writing about (so I didn't.) Mediocre pizza, ramen, burgers, buffet, it does everything but it just doesn't do anything very well. Today though, today stood out. I tell the guy at the counter I'd like a cheeseburger, and he says to me ""No, we're out of potatoes."" I tried to clarify... which took a solid 5 minutes. Which doesn't sound like a long time, but actually count out 300 seconds while explaining what a cheeseburger is. It feels really long. Now I'm nothing but impressed with people working to learn English as a second language, I understand that it's tremendously difficult. But I am unimpressed with the decision to put someone at the deli counter and not give them a vocab list or something.So at last he gets it and puts a patty on the fryer. And then... starts cleaning the deep fryer. Which, great, I'm glad they clean things. But then he starts arranging toppings in their buckets, in the same gloves he was cleaning the deep fryer in! And then he goes back to scrub more of the fryer, and then arranges more toppings, and then, the pinnacle of ""hell no"", he grabs my patty with his cleaning gloves and assembles my burger. I told him to keep it, and change his gloves for the next poor fool.",4,2,2
13,Benjamin B.,"Manhattan, NY",65,73,50,4.0,1/19/2017,"I call this place my Everything Deli. It literally has many types of food and you'll find *something* here for lunch. It's conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan on 41st Street and Lexington.-- FOOD --There is fresh Japanese lunch plates made on the spot, a mini bakery with dessert slices, your typical deli, a pizza section, food by the pound and salad by the pound, plus a large selection of bottled drinks and beer.My personal favorite is the unagi lunch plate in the Japaense section. It's pricey, but I love my eel once in a while.The guys at the Deli counter seem jaded--like every other Deli guy in New York. You better know how to order a sandwich, or you'll have a tough time trying to understand or explain to them what you want. The sandwiches I've had have always been good, just the attitude is a turnoff, but welcome to New York.I think the prices here are pretty reasonable considering the location. You could easily get a lunch meal with a drink for under $10-12.-- UPSTAIRS --If you want to eat in, there is a dining section upstairs. You will find a seat if it's just one or two of you. There are a few folks that take up more space than they need. It's bright near the windows and darker in the middle of the room, which is where you will find some people taking a quick nap.-- WIFI --There's free WiFi upstairs. The password is posted around.-- SUMMARY --I've tried the food at every section of this place. It's a terrific place to bring people who can't decide what they want for lunch and gives them plenty of options. Recommended.",2,2,

15,Wade W.,"Brooklyn, NY",62,80,20,1.0,8/21/2017,Horrible experience . I come here every day  for the past 3 years .  Today  the older man charged me 6$ for my morning sandwich today  . Which usually I pay 4.50 or 5$ .  It's because I asked for my hot sauce under the egg instead of on top the bacon. After he wrote 6$ I asked for a scoop of cream cheese on the side .   Which her gave me label with F(free) . I approached the the lady who I thought was a manager and the older man said he charged me 6 because of the cream cheese .  Total bS  because he wrote 6$ before I even asked for the cream cheese .  My entire office I run will no longer be allowed to bring in food from here  to my office .      Wanna rip me off for a 1$ ???  Now you lose 50 local clients ...  btw @nychealthdepartment  please go inspect the kitchen area .

16,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",543,547,2523,4.0,5/27/2015,Every day gourmet is a 24 hour deli located in between 40th and 41st on Lexington Avenue. First I have to tell you that every day gourmet has every thing that you could imagine food wise. If you are one of those people that cannot decide on what they want to have for lunch today come to this place and you will find something that will fill your stomach up. From the outside every day gourmet does not look like much boy was I wrong. When I say that every day gourmet deli has everything it literally has everything. They have a salad and fruit bar that is huge you cannot tell what's on the other end of the salad and fruit bar that's how long it is. In the back of every day gourmet they have an entire pizza station where there are pizzas that you can purchase as well as slices to go. They have a make your own salad station with a guy that stands behind the counter and you can create whatever type of salad that you want. Their salad station kind of remind me of a subway chain restaurant where you can just pick whatever you want and the worker will put everything together for you. The guy that was behind the counter had a very good memory because when I ordered my food I told him what I wanted and it was not on the menu and he remembered everything I asked for on my sandwich. To the left of the salad station they have a cold cut and hot sandwich station. They do serve boars head cold cuts here and you can get a hot sandwich or a cold sandwich. Their hot sandwich as well as their cold sandwich menu is very extensive. I ended up getting a grilled chipotle chicken wrap with lettuce and cheese. My wrap was very good. They had a lot of different types of grilled marinated chicken they had grilled marinated steak in teriyaki sauce and sweet Thai chili sauce. This deli also had cheeseburgers and gyros. I was really amazed at the selection that they had at gourmet deli. What I also like about this location is they are very close to Grand Central Station but there is also a Dunkin donuts across the street after I get my food I can go to the Dunkin' Donuts get my hot tea and then I can take the train. Overall I highly recommend coming every day gourmet it's very close to Grand Central Station the prices here are not bad and they do have one of the biggest selections I have seen in the deli in a very long time whether you're very health conscious or you want to eat something that will stick to your ribs I really think that every day gourmet will suit your needs for hunger. PROS: - Close to Grand Central Station- huge variety of food- they have a salad station- they have one of the biggest fruit bars I've seen in Manhattan,14,5,6
17,Megan S.,"San Jose, CA",20,258,442,4.0,2/22/2015,"stopped in to grab breakfast. They had a self serve bar. I got cottage cheese, fruit and nuts. Fruit was really fresh and good.

19,Michael C.,"Queens, NY",185,443,1973,3.0,10/16/2014,"I tried their buffet options here on a week night. Food itself was fairly decent about what I expected of these typical food delis catered for the lunch crowd. Its pretty nice they have a large seating area upstairs though, I guess no one really goes up there for bar and karoke so its mostly just people like us sitting and eating in the dark haha.at $8.99 a lb for buffet food it is a little higher than what I've seen at other places in downtown. Seems like I should have tried their Korean food options as it seems to have pretty good favorable review.  So even though its a little pricey it does offer pretty decent food I especially liked the Pasta at the hot food buffet, was not a bad visit after all since got to check out the bizarre arrangement they have upstairs haha",2,,
20,Ray H.,"Bronx, NY",107,138,50,2.0,7/19/2016,The food was not bad. The reason I'm giving two stars is because of the service. The guy making the salads was really rude. He didn't listen and wasn't talking clearly. I don't get why people act that way when it's their job to give good customer service. Probably won't eat here again just because of the bad service.,1,,

Updated review","I just ate here for lunch, ordered the miso ramen and I wish I took a pic. I regret eating it because now my mouth is itching and my stomach is paining. I knew I shouldn't have ate it when I saw the cook dip his spoon in the food and drank some of the broth before serving it. I brought it bk to the office only to see tht it was filled with seaweed and undercooked noodles, the broth tasted like salt and water and the egg was chopped up and thrown into the broth, sinking at the bottom of the bowl, it was truly a gross experience, I will not be going back or recommending anyone from my firm, infact I am sending an office email to let everyone know.",,,

I've gotten egg sandwiches made there and I've also gotten food off of the hot/cold bar. For the most part, everything I've had from Everyday is just OK. Nothing has been really great, but at the same time nothing has been terrible. I really enjoy the cold bar during breakfast & lunch. I do have to say the one thing they do have that is amazing is the fruit on the cold bar for breakfast and lunch. It's always ripe and tasty. The food by weight is so expensive though that a small box of fruit ends up being over $7. Totally ridiculous, but once in awhile I treat myself. I did notice that there's a check in offer for lunch, which is great to utilize as their food is definitely priced high. This place is really quick and easy if that's what you're looking for!",2,1,2

Since I'm new in town (just moved here less than a week ago) and don't know how tax works here yet, I didn't argue.Would have rated them higher if the food was good, but it ended up being pretty meh.Long story short, it was expensive for what it was.",1,,

Jewish Deli (which was very pleasant), I checked out a number of other 24hr. places at 3-4 AM along my long walk back to the Hyatt 48 Lex.This place had basically nothing on the many hot serving areas & had a ludicrous plethora of pseudo-ethnic food, which was not even there.Sure you could grab a ready made yogurt (at sky high prices), but I wanted something more, or at least unique to NY (except the attitude).Speaking of attitude, all the while I was looking around the store for a snack to stock my hotel frig, the workers were cursing at each other.  The manager then cursed out a paying customer, who just took a break from his Taxi job.The Taxi guy seemed to know this jerk, and they argued & cursed about Thanksgiving and why the Deli did not have Turkey.Yes, it was late Thanksgiving night & early Black Friday.Anyway, needless to say, I did not bother to buy even a yogurt there, since not only were they as nasty as the other 24hr. Deli (42), but again did not even ask me if I needed help.I do remember far better 24 hr choices in NYC when I was much younger.They may have not have been overly friendly, but they had great food & decent service back in the day (1980's).  Many of the 24 hr.

I also like how the minimum for credit card usage is only $3.00, while other delis have $10 minimums.I went to Everyday Gourmet with a few coworkers this week and if you walk past the hot buffet, there is a station at the very back of the deli where you can get Rolly Wraps. Basically, you choose whole wheat or a regular wrap, they take fresh dough and then you can put ANYTHING you want in the wrap. You can even choose fillings from the hot buffet! I chose a play off of the Veggie standard rolly wrap but then decided to also include some grilled chicken.Watching them make the wrap is fascinating because once done with the fillings, the employee wraps the dough around the fillings and then throws it in this conveyor belt oven thing.You can then choose what sauce you want with your rolly wrap, including marinara sauce or sour cream.It's a good size portion and I only paid about $6.50!",1,,

There are three breakfast specials to choose from, each $3.25, Mondays through Fridays, all of which are ridiculously cheap and perfect for on-the-go. There's a good deal on bananas (two for $1), but all their other fruits such as apples, peaches, oranges, etc. were overpriced at $1 to $1.50 per piece.I found this place to be extremely busy around 9AM, but the chefs nonetheless filled orders very quickly even though the lines weren't very organized.

Once I get my food, I am out within 30 seconds. No kidding! There are 3 cashiers in the front and 1 more cashier next to the stairs. Each cashier has a ringer and a bagger so it makes the paying process so efficient and so quick!The best part of it all is the 10% discount that comes with the Yelp check-in. I think I'll stick with this spot.",4,3,3
44,Michelle J.,"Brooklyn, NY",142,231,58,4.0,3/26/2014,"I wasn't expecting much on the Sunday morning before I caught my 8AM Boltbus back to Boston. Pretty much all food establishments are painfully expensive in the area but it was 7am and I was really hungry. I was drawn here because it had a flashing marquee so I figured they were open so I'd grab myself a sandwich to go. There were a few other guys here. All of them ordering from the deli. This place also has a Korean buffet available during lunch and dinner I'm guessing. I decided to order a ham, egg and cheese on a roll, which is pretty standard and if you go into just about bodega in Brooklyn you can get (unless they're halal). I ordered and got my sandwich in perhaps 10 minutes and it was pretty good. Though really you can't mess up a ham, egg and cheese. What really set this place apart for me was the price. Whenever you can get hot breakfast food for under $5 on 42nd street I take notice. This place serves good food and on top of that is affordable. You can't really get better than that. Definitely stopping back here whenever I've got a bus to catch or just looking for some cheap eats in the future.",3,,

48,Amanda P.,"New York, NY",76,52,67,4.0,5/20/2014,"I walk by here everyday on my way to work but I'm not a breakfast buyer so I usually walk on past. Last week I decided to have veggies and some sort of protein for lunch so I hopped on into Everyday Gourmet. I got there at 2:00p and it wasn't packed as the lunch rush was over. It's your typical NYC mega-deli with lots and lots of choices. I didn't wander too much as I came with plans for that salad bar. As I was perusing my choices, one of the workers added a steaming hot fish dish to the bar. Now, I know fish sounds questionable/very questionable from a salad bar, but it was a simple dish: some sort of white fish fillets in a tomato-ey broth with a few mushrooms and jalapenos. It looked pretty good and I didn't hesitate to grab a piece before I added a few pieces of steamed broccoli (no sauce added, yes!), kimchi, one piece of asparagus just for fun, and lots of broccoli rabe. I went to the register and was greeted by a really nice Asian guy who rang me up. My total came up to $5.93. Whaaaat? And it was a normal, girl-with-healthy-appetite-eating-healthy-food portion too.As for the food - the fish was great! The veggies were crisp and the sauced items were lightly sauced (which is so rare for these pay by the pound places). I was full, satisfied and amazed that I spent so little on a pay per pound hot deli. I returned the next day and tried their Korean seafood stew and it was great! Way better than other delis making Korean tofu soups. There wasn't too much seafood but it didn't even matter because it was tasty. I'm definitely adding EGD to my lunch rotation.",1,,
49,chanelle s.,"Glen Oaks, NY",0,33,0,3.0,9/5/2015,I go to Everyday Gourmet a few times per week for coffee or lunch. The buffet selection is extensive. The quality of the cold/salad bar is better than the hot food. The prices were raised (again) recently and not posted. It is a block away from my office so we sometimes order breakfast/coffee. The woman on the phone is always in a rush and hangs up before you can get the words out. Half the time the orders are wrong (ex- sugar in coffee when we asked for no sugar. Regular bacon instead of turkey bacon.) Overall it's ok if you are in the area.,1,,
50,Jamison E.,"Sugar Land, TX",7,149,65,3.0,5/7/2014,"I couldn't decide where to eat so stopped into here because the place was packed. It is a take away food court style place offering pizza, salads, sandwiches and Asia food. The salad bar looked really good but I decided to try the vegetable ramen soup and I got a premade avocado sushi roll. The soup is made fresh and was pretty good, not amazing. Be careful because it is HOT with heat. My tongue is still burning. The portion was huge and a steal a $5.99. The avocado roll was pretty standard grocery store quality.

52,Marcy S.,"New York, NY",11,9,0,4.0,7/17/2014,"This deli is huge and it will make your tummy happy. There is a large dining area on the second floor and whatever you're looking for, they have it. Initially, I frequented this place for their salad bar and hot food buffet which offers a plethora of yummy goodies. Then I discovered that they also have a number of stations for ordering other food. They have a station for hot and cold sandwiches, station for burgers, station for pizza, and station for pasta. But the station that really got me excited was their Korean and Japanese food. Being able to order fresh bulgogi, salmon teriyaki, sushi, noodles, and all that kind of stuff is amazing. They actually cook the food in front of you with an open flame and they are delicious.Furthermore, they prepare breakfast dishes in the morning at a great prices. I often get french toast for only three bones. That is a sweet deal.Thee only negative is the decor and ambiance of the place. It looks like they have not updated the place in decades, particularly the second level dining area. It is a little dreary and smelly up there. They would certainly generate more customer flow if they simply modernized the place a little. Though they do get plenty of customers all day long. I believe that is a testament to the quality and variety of their food offerings.",,,1

54,Dang L.,"Houston, TX",127,113,306,5.0,7/9/2014,"This is one of the many delis near my work place so my coworkers and I had to stop here and try it. They offer the usual foods that you would find at other cafe or delis in the area such as salad, cold/hot food buffet bar, sandwiches, paninis, wraps, and smoothie bar. But they also have a Korean food station! My first instinct was to try to Korean food because it was so much more different than the normal sandwich or salad. I got the bibimbap and was very satisfied with my lunchtime meal. They packed the meal in a big plastic container and the hot sauce on the side. This is a great spot for some Korean food when you're far from Ktown! And 9 bucks was definitely a steal for a meal like this because usually it would cost you 10+, not including tip for the dining. What's also unique about Everyday Gourmet Deli is that they have this huge seating area on their second floor! There are huge tables and booths for groups and even a few private glass rooms with TVs. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there was also a bar available if you wanted to start happy hour early. For some of the food stations they also give you a free water bottle or can of soda with your purchase. Checking-in gives you 10% off of lunch as well. (Tell them before they ring you up)",,,
55,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",956,918,1252,4.0,10/14/2011,"I generally don't like eating vast quantities of one thing. I'd rather try bits of everything. This is why I always do well at:a) potlucksb) Chinese banquet dinnersc) salad barsThis unimaginatively named deli is GREAT. Clean, vast. There's an overwhelming variety of food: HUGE hot and cold salad bars, Korean food counter, pizza and burgers, wraps and sandwiches. All of it looking good. At ~$8/lb, only the salad bar is more expensive than others in the area. But it has everything under the sun (even steak!) and everything looks fresh and delicious. Standing in the front looking toward the end of the salad bar is like staring at the ocean.Today I actually opted for a California burger, crammed with avocado and sprouts. Just $5.50 and I saw them slice up an entire half of an avocado into it. Something I don't see mentioned too much in the reviews here is the upstairs seating. The entire top floor has giant leather sofas and bar seating as well as your regular cafe tables and chairs. It's quiet and barely lit, which creates a moody atmosphere -- weird for lunchtime but still fun and cozy. I'd rather eat here than the usual rickety dirty tables at other salad bars. Also, free wifi. I don't know why they would encourage loitering since it gets very busy at lunchtime, but it's really not the worst place to buy a muffin and plonk down on a sofa for an hour or two.The staff are efficient and don't hesitate to smile at you. :)",1,,

Updated review","Downstairs during the day and upstairs at night... it's like night and day. But it's gotten a lot better downstairs. Good Bi Bim Bop in the noodle corner, not a bad salad bar. Efficient if not spectacular. Three stars for DownstairsAt night, Jenny. Andy, Martin  and friendly upstairs at the UPSTAIRS bar (stairs through the deli) are great. I wish I could rate them separately. The DJ is spot on. He takes requests, but I like him best when he does his own eclectic mixture of K-pop, K-hip hop, and 60s Rock. The bar is relaxed, super friendly and a great place to hang out. It's never packed... just a great place to relax, meet the locals and feel like you're in on a secret. I LOVE this place.

I could probably eat there and have something different for lunch every day, for at least 3 months. That's a lot of variety.I ended up going to the salad bar, and even at the salad bar, I couldn't make up my mind. I saw halves of fresh avocado, and went for those. Then I saw Korean style tofu, and scooped those up. Then the bean sprouts, the breaded eggplant, the spinach, the broccoli rabe...etc. My salad was more like a smorgasboard of a few of my favorite foods rather than any recognizable salad. Surprisingly enough, the soy sauce from the tofu actually brought it all together, so I was very pleased. Not only that, but for such a large and heavy salad, I paid a little less than $10! I expect to pay around $10 for a salad, and for one that size, I was thinking it'd be at least $15. I was quite pleased.I definitely want to go back and try more of their dishes. My friends ordered sandwiches and said they were delicious, so I'm looking forward to getting lunch from this place again.",2,,

74,Thomas M.,"Brooklyn, NY",102,317,135,4.0,2/8/2012,"I love Tofu Soup. Or Soon Doo Boo Jigae for those of the Asian persuasion. I should have just lead with that, since those of you who know what I mean are most likely Asian anyway. I digress. Being trapped in the upper 40's on the east side is far from conducive to a diet high in spicy soup, soft tofu and seafood. There are some options however... Olympia on 2nd Ave. makes a ""tofu soup"". (They don't call it by it's proper name) And so does Everyday Gourmet Deli. EGD gets 4 stars on account of being the best Soon Doo Boo in the area, but I suppose that's not saying much when they have only one competitor. The soup is just flavored right, seafood is adequate amounts, and you do usually get a shrimp in there. Don't see too many clams or squid, and for $9 it's not a great deal. But in terms of taste and flavor, this place is top notch. I've hadt he buffet here and the food isn't bad, the rice I would skipb ut the oxtail is certainly very tasty. I also had a seafood gumbo once which was again very good, real shrimp and even some clams. I'd skip the ramen here, its cheap but just tastes weird.

90,Vinay K.,"Manhattan, NY",76,79,171,3.0,4/4/2013,"Reasonably priced deli especially for mid-town and great for Sandwiches, buffet and Korean/Japanese food. The soon do bu Jigae is as good as Korea town glad i dont have to trek to Ktown for that. Over an all a great lunch spot with a big space for seating upstiars.",,,
91,I G.,"New York, NY",2,14,0,4.0,4/27/2011,"Here are a few of the reasons that I keep coming back to this place to pick up lunch:-Great salad bar and hot food bar options, and I mean serious variety. There's fried rice, noodles, pasta, sushi, ceasar salad, build your own salad, potatoes, fruit, etc. -Deli counter in the back with great sandwiches-Korean counter in another corner of the store-Huge drink selection (including beer and wine)-Convenient location, close to Grand Central so it's easy to stop by on the way home for those days you're too tired to cookMy only caveats:-Gets very crowded, you have to be quick and sort of graceful in order to be able to get to all the food you're want to pile into your container-Their mac and cheese is not that good (the cheese is too artificial tasting)",,,
92,Jeremy D.,"Brooklyn, NY",19,160,220,3.0,1/22/2011,"Been here a few times. If you get the packaged sushi it actually tastes fresh, and is quite tasty. A lot of the Japanese food is quite good. There's also a discount for Yelpers, so you can take advantage of that by checking in. Thing is, there's all sorts of stuff to try here, all of which is pretty decent, so it does the job.",,,
93,Sarah C.,"Lafayette, CA",185,140,1,4.0,2/4/2010,"I've been coming here for breakfast every weekday morning for the past year. What first attracted me was their $1 breakfast special (for bagel with butter and a small cup of coffee). However, even after this special has ended (I believe new management came on board sometime in October?), I still keep coming. Why? Here are my reasons:1. Coffee - I'm not sure why, but their coffee is pretty unbelievable. I think I asked them once what brand it is, but the woman at the cash register replied that she didn't know. So, whatever it is, it's pretty darn good coffee.2. Good bagel selection.3. Mario! Very good at what he does and VERY friendly and sweet. Now that my morning breakfast routine is $2.25 instead of $1.50, I am still coming despite the 50% increase in prices over the past year. However, still very reasonable. Just praying that the economy wouldn't overtake my ability to keep buying breakfast every morning!",1,,1
94,Anton P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,17,0,4.0,4/8/2011,"Best bet for lunch sandwhiches in the area. I walk 4 blocks to this place and I am always happy. Decent price, good sanwhiches. They have a variety of specials and they're all worth it. ALSO, one of the largest seating in the area. This place must pay way too much in rent.No clue why people comment on buffet food when you can't seriously expect it to be on par with ready made foods.",,,
95,Christina B.,"Brooklyn, NY",97,105,1,3.0,2/22/2012,"Everyone in my office has been telling me that the Korean food here is now better than Delmonicos.  I tried the udon today (which I know is Japanese, but they have at the Korean food counter) and it was quite good, with lots of vegetables.  They made it nice and spicy as well. I think there could have been more meat included, and I like the tofu at Delmonicos better.  I am interested in trying some more items there to further develop my opinion.",1,,
96,Felicia K.,"West New York, NJ",73,346,17,3.0,8/19/2012,"Nice typical NYC deli/convenience store with the hot/cold buffet bar, and apparently a bunch of Korean food is available. The upstairs seating area is huge and kind of weird, with dim lighting that makes you feel like you're in a restaurant. There's also a bar complete with strobe lights or whatever up there, along with restrooms and a mini internet cafe. Parts of the ceiling are peeling off, and there's a fountain engorged with fake flower arrangements. It made me think of internet cafes in Japan.",,,
97,Tom F.,"Chicago, IL",68,102,13,3.0,8/24/2012,"Good, solid, high-volume deli for lunch. Service could have been a little faster when i was there but I got a good buy for good food.",,,
98,Mike L.,"Pleasant Prairie, WI",0,12,0,3.0,2/3/2013,"Good 24-hour go-to joint, Lex and 41st.We were staying at the Affinia Shelburne about 4 blocks south and this place turned out to be a nice place to grab some unpretentious food quickly.  It's like a hybrid convenience store/buffet restaurant/deli/bar/bodega (although it's Korean owned, I think).  The good thing is, as Stephan would say -- ""this place has EVERYthing.""  Choose your buffet items wisely, especially after 10pm or so.  Immense cold and hot buffet selections, pizza slices in the back, a full deli (Boar's Head), sushi staion (not late-nite) a stocked cooler with beer, water and essentials, and tons of snacks.  As such, the quality is generally passable (or less) except for the fresh fruit which was out of this world.  One night we came in and three Asian gentlemen were standing around the buffet table enjoying their yogurt/fruit/granola parfaits, smiling away.  The amaz thing is that there is this expansive room upstairs that is a bar after dark, and there are affordable internet stations up there as well.  They must own the building, because the upstairs is frickin huge, private rooms, couches to lounge on, tons of booths/tables and even a litle koi pond.  Sorry, Stephan fans -- no punch line.  Just a great choice in a neighborhood that's a little challenged for food choices, especially late nite.",,,
99,Robert B.,"Dingmans Ferry, PA",8,283,49,4.0,4/29/2012,It's great for what it is. It gets an extra star for being one of the only places open late on a Sunday and for having a good beer selection!,,,
100,Dina P.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,14,0,1.0,8/20/2012,This place as the rudest staff I've ever come across in a Deli. They are way over priced for the quality of the food. Food is sub par if that. Soup does NOT come with bread. Food made in haste without the customer in mind. I would not bother going here. They've lost my business.,,,
101,Jacob Y.,"New York, NY",184,467,120,4.0,3/26/2010,"During one of my first visits to my company's NYC offices, I was introduced to Old Bridge by one of my colleagues who is from New York.  In fact, his exact words were ""this is one of the best delis in the city!"".  With that being said, I always listen to the locals.And boy was he right.  And boy was I glad.  This place serves very freshly made deli sandwiches...Japanese dishes (sushi, udon, etc.), and the typical buffet assortments.My favorite...chicken salad club.  Outstanding.Give it a try.  This place by far beats the deli inside the building I work at!",,,
102,Chris J.,"Manhattan, NY",215,231,0,3.0,7/24/2008,"A Jack-of-all-trades, but mastered none. While that cliche fits me like my favorite underwear, I must admit it's equally as appropriate as a description for Old Bridge Gourmet Deli.  Jack-Off-of-all-trades. Boy I'm precious.  My mom is so proud. I just sparkle. There's an Old Bridge Gourmet Deli near every office building grouping, whether considering Midtown or Downtown it doesn't matter.  When Downtown it's Riverside,  Midtown calls it Old Bridge Gourmet Deli. Like Denis Rodman in a wedding dress, Old Bridge doesn't know what it is.  Is it a grocery store selling staples?  A salad bar? A juice/smoothie bar? A deli? A pizzeria? A restaurant? A place for sushi? Whatever the f*ck this place is, it's clean and that scores serious points in my book.  I eat here at least once a week.  I usually stand in line for a sandwich or wrap.  You can create your own, or order off a board.  I prefer the former.  It's reasonably priced [$7 for a chicken wrap with lettuce, onions, etc.]. I would recommend creating your own wrap, because the bread isn't really great, usually soft and tasteless.  I take comfort knowing it's here and convenient, more than the ""great food.""  It's safe, like me sleeping with my down comforter on a winter's night.  When I scratch my head and ass and think about what I should do for lunch. I go to OBGDC.  I suggest you do the same, save scratching ass.",4,6,4
103,Linda C.,"Queens, NY",16,709,0,4.0,10/21/2010,"The price keep going up.It is now $7.99 a pound.From the hot and cold buffet, I usually get half a slice of meatloaf, a slice of roast turkey, 5 pieces of pea pod, a small piece of soy sauce tofu, 2 small pieces of whole marinated mushrooms,  a piece of  canned artichoke heart, a piece of canned heart of  palm and a small pile of cold  glass noodles. This is about a pound of food.They have a special for breakfast for $1.25:a butter roll or bagel with a small coffee or tea.the coffee is not bad.They also make sandwiches or burgers to order.There is also sushi, juice, noodle  and a  pizza bar.Tip: if you are on a budget, skip the heavy items( rice, noodle,tomato,potato salad, cole slaw,mashed potato,etc).You don't want to pay $8 a pound for the above.Go for the following items:salmon                                                beef briskit                                                 oxtail                                                 fried chicken                                                 baked shrimp                                                 fried shrimp                                                  meatballs in gravy                                                  baked virginia ham                                                 baked chicken                                                 baked fish",4,4,4
104,Pam S.,"Brooklyn, NY",186,412,399,4.0,4/24/2007,"If mid-town Manhattan was my classroom and I was a teacher, this deli would be my star pupil. But I'm not a teacher.. I'm a ""young working professional"" stuck in the land of sh!tty lunches... save for the street cart and this place.. and maybe Pret. I'm here 3 out of 5 lunch days a week. The scoop-and-weigh (aka ""Scoopy"" as it is known around this office) bar is extensive and has everything from Chinese-style dishes (roast pork, fried noodles, fried rice, sauteed vegetables in brown sauce), to a wonderful array of salads, fruits and very fresh greens.. to rich hearty pasta dishes and roast chicken/fish. Mix and match to suit your mood - everything is fresh and tasty. They also have a great sandwich counter which uses Boar's Head meats, and dece smoothie and pizza counters. PLUS! Lots of seating upstairs for people to enjoy lunch outside of the office as well. Always a great place for a working lunch break. Don't be surprised if you come here and recognize me as I shovel food into my mouth while bitching incessantly with my work buddies. It is a weekly routine.",3,2,3
105,Martha R.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,21,1,3.0,11/5/2007,"Cood review based on ONE beautiful aspect.... OK maybe two. 1) The breakfast coffee and bagel deal.Small coffee + bagel with cream cheese = $2.002) The sandwiches are really good, the freshly sliced cuts when you order are probably the secret.I'm usually not too crazy about the salad bar, but recently had a very pleasant surprise as I encountered a beautiful tray of tater tots.edit: They've become a bit stingy with the cream cheese on the morning deal.",3,,2
106,Brian B.,"New York, NY",2,12,0,4.0,8/6/2010,"Went here for lunch last week. Fortunately, I took a later lunch so I was able to reconnoiter the joint prior to making my selection. This place has a lot to offer, including Japanese Ramen, which I'm stoked about. I didn't have it, but the fact that there are three Japanese men behind the counter is very encouraging, as pointed out by another reviewer.The prices are better than some of the other delis around midtown. I wanted to find out if the ingredients were fresh so I snagged a vegetarian sandwich with sprouts, red pepper, tomato, cucumber and avocado on wheat - for $4.50. Definitely crisp and flavorful veggies.The french fries, on the other hand, were soggy, but I think they were just victims of condensation in the box on the walk back to the office. No biggie, they were still tasty. Will eat in next time.I hope to have good things to say about the Ramen after my next trip.",,,
107,shannon w.,"New York, NY",25,23,0,4.0,1/5/2012,"I love this place - it's convenient to my office, and chock full of helpful, friendly staff members.   The food is decent, and like every deli in this area they have what seems to be an endless array of options to choose from.  Really the distinguishing factors are value and the juice bar.  I often come just for the juice - it's AWESOME - literally you request what you want in it and they make it right in front of you.  As in, ""Good morning!  Can I get a beet, kale, carrot and orange juice?""  And 3-5 minutes later its in my hand, for a mere $5!!!  And when I get a sandwich (disclaimer/apology, I'm a vegetarian now), it's literally stuffed with a full fresh avocado.  For another mere $5.  Lines can get a bit crazy, but they move all the patrons through pretty swiftly so the wait is never crazy.",,,
108,Yvette V.,"Flushing, NY",0,2,0,1.0,2/26/2014,The service is very poor.  The workers do not speak English well are not polite who are serving the food to you and always gives me the wrong order.  I have to tell them so many times what I want.  I even explain it in Spanish to see if they understand and they make up their own prices.,,,
109,Anna M.,"New York, NY",0,56,0,5.0,11/1/2010,"This place is amazing!

They have everything, from Chinese food to sushi! They have so many options, and it is really a lot of fun to make different combos! You can get your own coffee, and they have different flavors too! The fruits and veggies are always fresh! I has a couple waffle fries, but they were a little cold... but they were almost out of it, so they were probably going to refill it. It was good though!",2,,

113,Olga E.,"New York, NY",16,55,0,4.0,3/2/2009,"This place is a typical midtown eatery that caters to anyone's taste during a busy lunch. Everything is either prepared (hot/cold buffet) or can be made very quickly (sandwiches and soup). The selection here is typical. They have a hot and cold buffet ($6-7/per pound), deli section ($6-8/per sandwich) and pizza, Japanese food selection ($6 -7 for Udon soup or bento box ), salad bar , sushi ($5+) and drinks, yogurts, and other small snacks. I personally prefer the Japanese selection. They try to alternate their bento box selection and sometimes give samples. The Udon and Soba are also the cheapest around and they can make it really spicy for you if you wish. Also, they have the bigger (an slightly cheaper) selection of sushi and sashimi than most similar establishments (Bistro), even offering a sashimi salad with ginger dressing.Everything else I believe is pretty typical, although the hot / cold buffet is not as good as the Bistro one (down the block on 42nd and Park).",,,
114,Melli B.,"Pembroke Pines, FL",131,292,468,4.0,4/13/2012,"Everytime I'm in New York, I make it my business to grab take out from here. The buffet style, food by the pound, deli is one of the best I've been to in Manhattan! If you go around noon you have a choice of a wide array, fresh hot and cold foods. Everything from fresh vegetables, to grilled salmon is served here. The cold section includes cold salads like tuna and chicken and fresh fruit. They even have marinated mushrooms. On the other side, you can get deli sandwiches made fresh, hot soups, hot pizza, sushi, fresh squeezed juices and an array of packaged snacks. I typically go for the food by the pound. I have yet to put something in my container that wasn't delicious! Today I had fresh spinach, mac n cheese,rice with veggies (fried rice), and baked new potato. Full of flavor, fresh and tasty. Good, good stuff! The food costs $7.99 per pound which can be pricey if you get more than 2 lbs. I usually pay anywhere from $9-13 and I'm stuffed and there are left overs. I really like this place!",1,,1

I always get the chicken udon, which comes with just the right amount of shredded chicken and chopped veggies. Might not be the most authentic, but it is damn tasty.
