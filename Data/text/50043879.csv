0,Marley M.,"New York, NY",401,134,281,5.0,11/17/2018,"I was hesitant about coming here due to their reviews but I had a great experience! I think what makes this place a bit off for others is the fact that their menu changes every three months and the items on the menu are ""eccentric"". For example, I've never had tuna sashimi with bacon bits. It was strange but still very tasty! The overall vibe here is eccentric. I definitely recommend making reservations.The staff was sweet and informative and the food was very fresh. I would certainly return here!",3,3,6
1,Yaroslava Z.,"Midwood, Brooklyn, NY",93,9,4,3.0,11/18/2018,"The place is definitely better suited for getting drinks than dining.I liked the kale caesar, the rest of the dishes we ordered wasn't anything I enjoyed. The host staff was confusing, I waited for a while to join the party that was already seated and went on to look for them on my own. My side of the table was inclined towards me. I had to move my plate towards the middle and kept loosing cutlery as it was sliding down the slope. The wait for drinks is pretty long but the drinks were good. I think the place looks stylish and is good for drinks with your team from work etc.",,,
2,Ron B.,"San Francisco, CA",8,150,1,2.0,11/15/2018,"....bland, lacked separation of taste.  Im still trying to find the flavor.  Over-priced, seriously over-priced!!!!  No, seriously over-priced.  New York has too many restaurants with better dishes than to settle for high priced bland dishes... I say dishes because I'm still confused on the identity of the Restaurant.   Small plates check!  Small plates of what?  Swarmas?  Dumplings?  Tacos?  What the heck?  At least give me something that I can brag about! $104 plus not worth it. Bottomline - read the above review.",,,
3,Nicole C.,"Brooklyn, NY",290,61,98,5.0,11/4/2018,"Vandal fits my typical Yelp search to a t: hip, trendy restaurant. I've only been to Vandal once before, but remembered enjoying the ambiance and overall experience, so I took colleagues here for a birthday celebration. WE LOVED IT. Here are some of the highlights:- Service is impeccable. Staff is friendly and attentive, and don't get annoyed if you want to order food in rounds. They took the menus and brought them back when we were ready to order more, which I thought was a nice touch.- The vibe is cool. The restaurant is pretty big, but it gets packed with people of all ages. It's the kind of place that makes you feel like you're in the know for being there.- The food - the most important part! I am now vegan, and they had a pretty extensive vegan menu. The mushroom sopes were the best thing I had. I am already planning my next trip back to get them again. The eggplant meatballs were tasty, too, and I also really enjoyed the veggie enchiladas. - The drinks - also amazing! Their cocktail menu includes creative options. Not normally a cocktail drinker, I couldn't turn down the Trigger Finger. If you love bourbon, this is for you.I told my wife what a great time I had, and we are literally planning on going next week. Hope you have as good an experience as I did!",,,
4,Ja'Nice G.,"Brooklyn, NY",334,5,3,1.0,10/30/2018,"I don't know if I went on a bad day or this is how things are normally run here, but I can't ignore how bad the food and the service there was. I ordered the chicken tacos which were super tiny and ridiculously mediocre in taste(and not to mention slightly cold). One taco = one bite. Being that there were 3 tacos, after the first bite/taco I went up to the waitress and expressed that I was not happy with my meal. She asked if there was anything else I wanted from the menu, which I genuinely did not given that 2 out of the 3 friends I was with told me their meals weren't that great either, so I declined hoping that she would possibly consider removing it from the bill so that the only bad taste I would be left with from this restaurant was the food. This was not the case. She barley even expressed interest toward the matter. And gave me a crude ""give me a second""  In the meantime I stepped away to go to the bathroom and once I got back to my table, the meal was still there in the same spot which was a surprise to me since the restaurant was more than halfway empty and nowhere near busy at the time. 15 minutes later I flagged down another wait to tell him about the food l, to which he replied ""I'll go tell the waitress"". Five minutes later the waitress comes back out and gives me a ""complementary"" dessert, which I later found out was the same price as what I ordered, so it was more like a trade off. I don't know if giving me something I didn't particularity want or ask for was a way for them to erase the fact that the food was bad, but she left the tacos on the bill anyway. The final straw I had with this restaurant was when I asked for the ""complementary"" dessert to be boxed up to take with me in the interest of not wasting anymore food. I didn't want the dessert to go to waste like the tacos did so I asked one of the male waiters in our area to take it to go. He came back with the dessert boxed up in a bag, but what I didn't realize until the car ride home when looked in the bag was that the dessert was completely upside down! Carelessly just thrown in the container. Here is the picture of it. All in all I will not be visiting Vandal ever again.",1,,

It's packing a lovely punch, tasty & refreshing.  Let me warn you - it's really good, you'll convert.  Just check out my food pics, the flavor was seriously present in every dish I ate tonight from start to finish.  Oh & dessert - a big #whoopwhoop!",4,2,3

Updated review","My friend and I went to the bar inside the restaurant around 11:30pm on Friday night. It wasn't busy at all. We each ordered a cocktail. I got Double Dutch and my friend got Taxi Lime. They were delicious and strong. We also ordered crispy bao buns (3 small portions). The bun was fried on oil. It wasn't the best, just okay. Around 12:30am we went downstairs to the club with our drinks. It was crowded and people were drinking, lounging, and dancing. It does seem like they charge some folks for club entry. Four girls (one of my friends and her friends) who were waiting on the line outside were being charged $150 to get into the club. Not sure why though. Glad we got in through the bar/restaurant entrance. The bartender asked the manager and we were able to go directly down to the dancing floor with our drinks. :)",2,,2
7,Karl K.,"Bentonville, AR",99,67,62,3.0,10/28/2018,Service: The waiter were nice and very helpful at explaining the menu.Food/Drinks: I ordered a cîroc coconut with pineapple drink and also a rum and coke drink. Both were good drinks. My wife and my cousins ordered the mushroom pizza which was surprisingly good as well.Area: The area for eating was a bit crowded by the bar area.Overall I would definitely come back again.,,,
8,Quincy T.,"Brooklyn, NY",353,361,681,4.0,8/15/2018,"From the pink bunny, to the tea kart, to the prompt service, and even the spotless bathroom this place is worth multiple visits. Birthday Time! Not for me though, but I was there :)Our party arrived, as most due in small pockets. So finally we were seated and the waiter made himself familiar with the table. He ran off the specials, the drink options, his personal recommendations, and patiently waited for us all to get ready. We order our 1st round of drinks and began to peruse the menu, by the 3rd sip I was ready. There were too many people at the table but we all managed to get our orders in and due to an unexpected wait, we received complimentary shots and crispy Bao Buns... like the name suggests there is some oil involved in this dish. The buns themselves tasted as though they'd been fried... no Bueno. That was my only hang-up with this place.I ordered the Bao Buns (before realizing the buns were fried), sweet potatoes fries, and a Heineken. The fries were the highlight of my meal to be honest. Others at the table order the pizza, sea bask tacos, and the crispy cauliflower taco.... All delicious options. I could tell by the expressions on their faces :).The waiter even discretely brought a birthday cupcake to the table for the Birthday Girl.I'll definitely be back.Food: 4.5/5Service: 5/5Drinks: 5/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Price: 4/5Cash and credit happily accepted.",3,1,2

The decor is also unique and beautiful.My friend and I walked in Friday night without a reservation and were seated immediately. The place was crowded though, but they were accommodating.The menu has pretty diverse options. I can totally see how the food could be hit or miss as it is fusion and that may not be everyone's cup of tea.We ordered the sea bass tacos, short rib meat balls, and pasta squid ink pasta.All three were flavorful and tasted good, especially the pasta. Service was prompt and friendly enough, and we were never pressured to order more.",2,1,2
10,Khin Z.,"Woodside, NY",15,206,11,5.0,10/11/2018,"I have not done a review in 2 years but I was so impressed by the food here that I had to do a review. This was probably one of the best meals I have ever had and I am an insanely picky person! We came here on a rainy Thursday night at 5:00PM, and there were only a couple of tables that were filled. First of all when I first looked at the menu, the names and descriptions of the dishes are very vague and it definitely do not do the food justice. That is when Jorge came in. He gave us recommendations with detailed descriptions of the dishes and he was so right on point! Cocktails ($17)- Definitely on the pricey end. They were nice and strong but unremarkable.  Tortilla soup dumplings (~$14)- Being around the Chinatown area, I was thinking this was a Joe's Shaghai knockoff and extremely skeptical. But Jorge insisted on getting it and he even offered to send it back to the kitchen if we didn't like it (how's that for confident)!This was the most unique yet delicious dish I have ever had. There were 6 individual spoons. Each spoob had a luke warm tomato soup/base with these shumai like puff/dumplings that were crisp on the outside but when you bite in there's this gooey light cheese inside. So hard to explain but a must!!Pan seared scallops with creamy orzo ($34)- 3 gigantic diver scallops that were cooked to perfection! It came with a cheezy orzo side with chunks of thick bacon. My boyfriend said the orzo did get a bit salty towards the last couple of bites, perhaps it needed a tomato base or some acid to off set the creaminess. Main lobster pasta ($34) - PERFECTION! Tons of lobster bits with squid ink tagliatelle pasta. It cane with a creamy, tomato sauce with corn. Such a strange combination but good to the last drop. I wish the portion was bigger!Vandal smores ($14)- Once again, this dessert had a lackluster description but Jorge convinced us! I usually don't like smores because it is too sweet but this just had the perfect sweetness (perfect for sharing). It resembled more of a pie. The top was sort of a marshmallow meringue but it was more creamy than sweet. The middle was similar to chocolate fudge with a buttery graham cracker crust. It came with graham cracker ice cream (also insanely good, closest to a caramel vanilla).  The only critique that I would have is that maybe tablecloths would have made it classier? I mean, they had a bathroom attendant, so why not tablecloths? In addition, the prices were on the high end, so it's definitely a special occasion splurge!",1,,2
11,Andreina C.,"Dallas, TX",457,59,92,5.0,10/2/2018,"This place is super trendy and super chic. Besides that, the food was amazing!! Literally, everything we was delicious. My favorite item was the lobster sobes! The meatballs were also really good! It's definitely a place to go and see and be seen. In addition, there is a nightclub next door if you feel like you want to keep the party going!",1,,1
12,Michael N.,"Manhattan, NY",341,79,160,4.0,10/12/2018,"Suggested to one if my co workers that this place would be great to celebrate her birthday and with most of her friends getting there early and I unfortunately couldn't get off work earlier, Us celebrating all together was short and sweet. However the drinks were good and I remember having a cocktail called the ""Of the Wall"". One more of those and I would have been climbing the walls lol ... Nonetheless we still had a great time. Definitely looking forward to going for Happy Hour on a Tuesday.",,,

Didn't order large plates but small ones; the pepperoni pizza, the chicken tacos and the Chilean sea bass tacos all delicious. The frose was probably one of the best I've ever had, made with absolut Elyx so strong yet delicious. And of course we took pictures with Henry the Vandal bunny. Service was good and the food came out super fast!",1,,1
14,Ashley O.,"Baltimore, MD",322,139,169,3.0,6/30/2018,"I am really sad to be writing this review! I have wanted to try Vandal for over two years and finally had the opportunity to do so last night 6.29.18. I had reservations for 8:30 for 3 of my gfs and I. The hostesses where very sweet and got us seated quickly. The atmosphere was very nyc ish which I enjoy. I was surprised at how casual one could come to dinner but it was nice to see the restaurant wasn't stuck up! Our waiter came around 7 mins after being seated. He explained the menu to us then took our drink orders. We then after about another 7 mins order apps. We ordered the sea bad tacos yum, kale Caesar salad yum, and the eggplant meatballs! All were very good and shareable. He added an extra taco for $8.00 dollars which I guess is okay in price. After finishing our apps we couldn't get our waiter back to our table for about 20 mins. We had to ask another waiter to go find him. He returned and we ordered our meals: margarita pizza-yum, scallops-yum, rosé ravioli- not the best and the linguini- no Our waiter never came to ask how the meal was if we needed anything etc. instead he was flirting with the table next to us the whole time. I get it you see pretty girls you want to chat them up, but still do your job. He finally came back to take our plates away and we expressed that my gf didn't like her linguine so he said no problem he would take it off. We didn't order dessert. Paid and left. Overall it was underwhelming. The apps are good but dinner not so much. I would possible try it again. I will say the crowd if extremely young like 21 yrs old a lot of the girls looked which I found interesting too. Cute place for group dinner or date night.",3,1,3
15,Damon C.,"Bensonhurst, NY",30,8,0,1.0,11/17/2018,Reservations for a party. Made us wait an hour. With a deposit and contract for a DINNER these people served us burnt food after standing an hour waiting with reservations.,,,
16,Shambavi K.,"Chicago, IL",280,566,851,4.0,6/18/2018,"You come for the ambiance and decor, then maybe the drinks and the food. Reading the other reviews, I kept my expectations at bay in regards of to the food. It's certainly great for occasions and for non occasion. There was a long table set up near us for a bachelorette dinner party with 20 or so women. The service was pretty knowledgeable and attentive. Food wise, the 2 of us shared the following:- crispy eggplant: must get! They are fried and dressed just right. crispy yet soft on the inside. easy to share.- crispy bao tacos with beef: set of 3. the bread is fried so it's not soft anymore. it was fine. Worth ordering I suppose.- fish tacos: it was fine I think. Honestly can't remember it too well but it wasn't bad. - the scallops: 3 wonderfully seared scallops. The orzo pasta was in a creamy sauce. It was meh- reminded me of pasta salad but it was actually okay. A different base or execution would be nicer- my friend had a froze which was strong enough and fruity enough for her liking. I wish I can remember what I had cuz I ordered it twice.Overall we had a good experience. Nothing much to complain.",2,,
17,Shannon W.,"Paramus, NJ",552,444,808,4.0,6/6/2018,"I'm giving a bit of a skewed review as I came here for a private event and didn't get the chance to eat here or see what it's like on a normal night, but I love this place. First off, the place is huge and very tastefully decorated. Upstairs has that swanky prohibition 1920s flapper girl sexiness. The event I went to was in the basement, which is downstairs, past a creepy hallway and through unmarked doors. Very cool.The security guy opened the doors and bang, a beautiful long, curvey bar, adorable lounge seating, and a huge downstairs space! The drinks I had were all really good and the little food I ate was tasty (I had some tuna tartare, mini alcoholic milkshakes and onion ring looking churro-like sugary fried dough rings). I would love to come back here, I'm sure the downstairs gets packed on the weekends! Cool spot.",4,1,2
18,Talicia J.,"Brooklyn, NY",171,46,164,5.0,9/11/2018,This place was awesome! I recently turned *ahem* older  and decided I wanted to see what the whole Pink Bunny thing is all about. The reservation process was pretty painless. I called 4 days prior to my birthday placed my card down as a deposit and gave my initial head count. I arrived late as did some of my guests but the restaurant staff adjusted and allowed us to accommodate them as they arrived. I know that is not common practice but I appreciated their flexibility.,1,,1
19,Johnny G.,"New York, NY",192,228,220,3.0,9/12/2018,"It's a two part rating:The restaurant is massive and beautiful. It's such Instagrammable venue - large bunny in entry, risque art pieces, creative cocktails, etc. Ended up there on a Tuesday night with a group and it was lively. The crowd is very mixed uppity mid 20s to 40s creatives from Soho. They have an all day HH on Sunday-Thursday with 9 dollars everything. Its a great deal for the area. Get the Las Palmitas. The bartender was on point, the drinks had the perfect blend of alcohol and mix.I can't wait to go back for dinner. There is also a large sitting section by the bar so you don't necessarily have to sit at bar which I like.The negative is we tried to go downstairs at the end of the night to party the night away and the bouncer was being very pretentious. Like we going to the club not your living room. Why do you have to be angry about letting us in. We ended up not getting in but It was fine the whole experience wasn't tarnished.",1,,

Updated review",Ok .... Vandal- I came back and you redeemed yourself!!! You're back up to 5 stars We came here for Sunday Brunch because all the spot we wanted to go for Cinco De Mayo had no available reservations Not that I mind because I've always liked Vandal.Ironically I happened to have the same server. Luckily it wasn't busy during Sunday brunch and he was much more attentive than before. Not that I think he remembered me or anything. LolAnyway Vandal overall is a good experience... from the decor to the drinks to the food. All was aligned in the stars today!!!I started at the bar because my friends were tardy as usual lol .  The girl bartender was friendly and let me try the frozen Rio de Frosé which is like a frozen Rosé cocktail. Now I am not a big rosé girl at all and in the past my cocktails at Vandal have been ok.  But for some reason - this cocktail made my day!!! This cocktail was pretty and was delicious... so good we had 3 or 4 each  by the end of the meal!!!  My favorite cocktail  at Vandal. As for food - this place is a sharing place (which I love)  cuz I like to try several things to enjoy with others!! We had the crispy cauliflower tacos!!! BANGIN!!! So good!  We also had the braised chicken tacos  which I did not enjoy. We had the prime skirt stalest fried rice which was also very good!!!!  BUT our favorite was the wild mushroom pizza - SOOO yummy we ordered TWO!! I've had this before so I already knew... but damnit it's so darn good. There is Parmesan and cracked red pepper on the side that you could sprinkle. Oh Vandal - I love you!,15,3,13

22,Melissa R.,"Gainesville, FL",105,55,179,5.0,6/11/2018,"They had me at their ""street art meets street food"" concept, but the amazing food and drinks is what keeps me wanting to go back again and again. This is probably my favorite restaurant in New York City. The decor and aesthetic are cool, and the food is delicious. The creative flavor profiles at Vandal never cease to amaze me. While the avocado toast was perfectly toasted and seasoned, the cauliflower tacos and the roasted squash tostadas were the real show stoppers of my most recent visit. The cauliflower tacos are crunchy and loaded with delicious flavors, while the jicama base to the squash tostadas make them one of the  lightest and most delicious treats I have ever eaten. Also ordered by the table was a margarita pizza (tasty but basic), the salmon, a side of haricot verts (a more flavorful take on a basic side), and sweet potato fries (very well seasoned). For desert I ordered the chocolate pudding macaroon while the s'mores pie was also enjoyed by our table. Finally, Sergeant Bell Pepper was my spicy yet delightful drink of the night. While I also tasted the Rio de Frose and Icy Grape, SBP was my favorite cocktail in New York. I highly recommend Vandal to art and food lovers looking for a culinary adventure.",,,1
23,Sheena K.,"New York, NY",327,79,96,4.0,8/25/2018,"I love this place! The food is great the cocktails are nice. The ambiance is really the pull though. It's great for a date night or night out w a friend/friends. We ordered the meatballs, veggie meatballs, cauliflower tacos, fish tacos. All DELICIOUS! The flavors and quality of food is truly on point. We ordered the red bell pepper cocktail (I forget the name) it was more sweet than spicy and pretty expensive so not really worth it. But we also ordered a bottle of white wine and it was yum. I would definitely come back here again.",1,,
24,Hannah M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",913,269,1028,4.0,4/17/2018,"Note: this review is more for the nightclub/evening scene rather than the food/upstairs restaurant, although I have had the opportunity to try a number of dishes here as well. I usually come to Vandal on Fridays around 10:30-11:00 or so and it always gets decently busy without having the ultra-packed, obnoxious vibe of what I would consider to be the true nightclubs in the city (Marquee, Up & Down, Tao, 1 Oak, etc). Vandal has more of a loungey feel earlier in the night, with a really solid DJ that always plays a fun mix of Top 40s hip-hop and older classics that everyone knows. The demographics are a little more varied/multifarious than the aforementioned nightclubs as well - a good number of yuppies in their mid 20s, lots of European tourists, and a solid representation from the 30s-age professional crowd too. The food is, well, still ""club"" food, but again - a much higher caliber than that of its comrades. Those brisket tacos or whatever they call them are to die for, the pizza is solid, and the bao buns are yummy as well. That being said, I don't think I would go for the food completely disparate from the downstairs atmosphere.The whole theme of Vandal is street food/street art, which means that like Tao (which I recently found out is a relative), a number of NYC-based street artists have work up. Think Shepard Fairey, Hush, Tristan Eaton, etc. I can guarantee not everyone appreciates it, but as a patron it's really cool to see. All in all, the food is fine, but I really come to Vandal for the great music, great crowd, and slightly classier/tamer atmosphere than some of the bigger, more aggressive clubs in the city. It's hard to strike a nice balance and Vandal somehow manages. Also note: the cocktails are surprisingly good/inventive for a place that probably makes most of its money selling vodka sodas.",3,1,3
25,Taylor P.,"Mays Landing, NJ",170,99,226,3.0,4/8/2018,"To start this is 3.5 star review, a 3 is a bit harsh but I really don't think it deserved a 4. Scott Conant's (judge from Chopped) Vandal is a shining example of restaurant aesthetic. The whole space(and it's a large space) is expertly designed with art on every wall. The food is an innovative melting pot with a strong emphasis on tapas style sharing. The menu blends Asian, Mexican, American cuisine in a fun way. But what they excel at in terms of creativity, they lack a bit in execution.  I'll start with the positives. If you take one thing from this review, let it be this: DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT SLEEP ON THE EGGPLANT. This side dish of deep fried cubes of eggplant, crackly crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside, swimming in a flavorful miso saucy glaze was one of the best things I've put in my mouth in years. My second favorite item was the sticky rice dumplings stuffed with char sui pork- this was delicious. This was like the Asian answer to arancini. Crispy on the outside, soft, sticky and porky on the inside with sweet soy and chill oil for dipping.Beyond these two exceptional plates, I found many of the other dishes great in concept but not delivering in terms of flavor. There was a noticeable theme of under-seasoning and heavy bites screaming for a strong hit of acid. This left me wanting more as the flavors were a bit muted. Dishes falling under this included: -Broccoli and cheese soup dumplings- good but the flavors were muted-Crispy bao buns- like an Asian taco filled with brisket and a crunchy Asian slaw- the bao buns hold the oil flavor a bit too strongly and the slaw really needed more acid to cut through that-Short rib tacos- tender short rib, but again cherry tomato salsa really needed more acidity or maybe some spice to wake it up-Caesar salad- just sort of fine, pretty basic Caesar. Needed more seasoning, but the Parmesan crunchies were good-NY Pretzel steak tartar- interesting concept, tartar with some crunchy pretzels mixed in, sitting atop a soft pretzel. It had some pickled mustard seeds but this again needed better seasoning and more pickled mustard seedsOverall, this place has a lot of potential. With some tweaks in execution this could be phenomenal food. As is there is some definite room for improvement. Despite some lackluster dishes, I'd go again for the eggplant alone.",4,1,

We walked in at exactly 8:59pm and were seated immediately. The hosts were not as chipper as I would have liked for them to be, but they weren't nasty so its cool. Our waitress was extremely nice and personable, so she made up for it. We ordered chicken tacos as an appetizer. They were delicious!! I ordered the classic chicken parmesan...it was to die for*Insert Drool Emoji*. My waitress recommended a sweet drink n it exceeded my expectations!! We told the waitress that it was my birthday, and she recommended a strawberry shortcake ice cream. I thoroughly enjoyed my ENTIRE meal.

27,Jenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",477,172,201,3.0,8/19/2018,"Came for Restaurant Week Summer 2018. They offer a very eclectic menu of Asian and Mexican inspired food. My girlfriends and I came here on a Friday night and it was super busy. Thankfully, the venue is really large (it's actually hidden behind a small art gallery like a speakeasy!) so there was plenty of seating.I ordered the Yellowtail Crudo as my appetizer (pretty good slices of yellowtail sashimi but nothing special) and the Prime Skirt Steak as my entrée. The steak was very tender and came paired with such fragrant Thai fried rice cooked with coconut milk. My only complaint is that it was a little too undercooked -- I ordered medium and some of the slices were still super red in the middle. It's also way overpriced (at $46!) if you don't come here for Restaurant Week.For dessert, I got the churros with spicy chocolate. These were probably the best churros I've ever had in NYC! They're fried to the point that they practically melt in your mouth like cotton candy. The spicy chocolate was also a lot spicier than I thought. They weren't make-your-eyes-water spicy but definitely had a kick to it.Overall it was a good Restaurant Week experience but I don't think I'd come back for its regular menu. The dishes and drinks are WAY too pricey ($17 for a cocktail!) for a loud and obnoxious restaurant in the Lower East Side that turns into a lounge/club at night.",1,,

It's divided into different sections, the bar looks different from the restaurant and there is a club in the bottom as well. It's really spacious and all the servers are welcoming and friendly. The space is super cool I would definitely bring my camera here. They've paid a lot of attention to the decor and I like the installations a lot. The food is outstanding as well, everything I had tasted really good. We tried the branzino, the beef tartare on pretzel roll, the avocado salad, the fish tacos, the pate meatball, and the chicken and waffles- all delicious, the avocado salad was outstanding as was the meatball. for dessert we had the irish chocolate cake and they were nice enough to bring a cupcake for my friend who was celebrating her bday. for drinks we had the double dutch which I found a little sweet and the lost and found, which tasted a little like cough syrup.

We were sat next to the door and the server station- which in my opinion is a awful table. The food portions are super tiny. The food was delicious but not my favorite.They must serve a lot of sea food because that is what you smell when you come in. The waiter at one point asked if we knew how to read their menus because all we ordered were appetizers. Rude much?The place is great but its not the right place for me.",2,,
30,Vani T.,"Wantagh, NY",86,60,155,4.0,5/22/2018,"The atmosphere and ambiance is absolutely amazing. We went for apps/drinks and the food was amazing. Had the poke appetizer which tasted amazing...the tuna and salmon was very fresh. The creamy avocado and gobu cucumber salad worked well together and very flavorful. Also got the shredded chicken tacos which was delicious...tons of chicken, very juicy and tender. Also ordered the sweet potato fries which was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The downstairs lounge area is very nice...decor and lighting was amazing. I was fortunate enough to enjoy the area before the crowd arrived which was plus. Cocktails- got the pushcart wars and sweet release which was very good but I've had better jalapeño based drinks.",,,1
31,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,4.0,3/4/2018,"I had reservations at 7:45pm and this place was packed. We weren't seated until 8pm. The restaurant is huge and a bit confusing to get around. I do have to admit it was beautiful and like everyone said.. trendy. The place was dark and the music was loud. There was cool wall art and the service was top notch. We ordered to share:- Sea bass tacos: The fish itself was good but it was heavily covered in coleslaw which was not needed. It had a little spicy kick. - Wild mushroom pizza: Thin, not dry, nice ingredients but it was bland. The cheese was salty without any other flavor. I got bored after one slice. - Skirt steak with thai fried rice: The steak came medium rare. It was extremely juicy and moist as if they soaked it in butter. The fried rice was greasy and salty. It left us so thirsty. In my opinion the food was overpriced and mediocre. Dining here is more of a experience. I definitely had fun. I highly recommend checking out the lounge downstairs. It seems closed off but it is open to anyone over 21. After the stairs, you go through a quiet hallway and into a mysterious door that took me a while to find. From there you enter into another world. The bar was gorgeous, spacious, clean and high end. Around 9pm it was empty and a lot quieter than the dining area. I would return for drinks here.",7,,5
32,Chris L.,"Paterson, NJ",116,1102,970,4.0,3/17/2018,"I came here with my friends during restaurant week. This place is a trendy place, a place I normally is not on my dining circle. I sat at the bar to wait for my friends to arrive. The lime gimlet was nice and I didn't get a headache the next day. I got duck buns, salmon dish, and the churro. Overall, the food was just okay. Every item had a twist that I'm not sure was necessary. The churros with the spicy chocolate was a good idea for me. it would have been better with less heat and better quality chocolate.  We had fun, I would probably come back and try the full menu. The bouncers at the entrance doesn't make it an inviting place. But, I guess it works for them.",3,1,2
33,Natalie K.,"Las Vegas, NV",410,316,1806,4.0,7/12/2018,"Come for the huge upside down bunny, stay for the ambiance, cocktails, and food. Dinner with the girls here was my friends idea, and we did not leave disappointed. The decor feels luxurious and chick. The dining rooms feel really opened, while the dim lighting and good spacing between the tables afford intimacy. We munched on eggplant meatballs, wild mushroom pizza, sweet potato fries, sea bass tacos, and house salad. Everything was good but the most memorable was the mushroom pizza. So much so that the ladies ordered another one!The cocktails are bomb! Rio De Frose is strong as hell! I wasn't expecting it from a frozen cocktail. The Double Dutch came recommended by the server and is simply delicious. I had to get a couple to really aquatint myself with the flavor  ;)Acquainting continued to the club after dinner. Located downstairs, it was a nice continuation of the night. Music was bumping and the vibes were chill. Vandal lived up to its hype.",9,1,4

Felt like people were staring because it's more of a date place where you wouldn't bring your parents who are in town, but now I know! We had ordered the yellowtail, the vandal salad, the chicken parm, and the salmon..yellowtail was really good. Only 5 or so small pieces. Salad was interesting. I'm not sure what kind of dressing was on there, it was good but I don't think I'd order again. Chicken parm and the salmon were by far my favorite. Chicken was SOOOO delicious and it was a decent piece of chicken too!!! Salmon was delicious as well. For desert we had this strawberry custard and a mini espresso milkshake. Strawberry custard was so good, milkshake tasted like espresso and nothing else, I wasn't much of a fan. Service was a tad bit slow as well. Overall a nice experience.",,,1
36,Elda P.,"Central Islip, NY",11,69,133,3.0,10/6/2018,"A bit confused with this place. We showed up around 9:30 and made this long line to get in. We went directly downstairs to the ""lounge"" and it was a bit empty. There was a dj playing music that wasn't really in the dancing party mood theme. There were maybe 6 others there just sitting on the couch and apparently once it hit 12 you need to buy a bottle or something ... aha, 600-1,000$ bottle. It was 10:30 and it was literally dead. My girlfriend then needed to go the br and was gone for a couple of minutes and then the bouncer or guard by the Lounge didn't let her back in ! She had to call us for us to get out because they weren't letting her back in. I was really confused considering other reviews? It was also a Saturday night ! We ended up leaving by 11. I'm not sure if the party starts at midnight? So I can't really speak much for this place. I didn't get to really experience ""vandal"" lol. I did see the big bunny at the entrance though and their bathrooms are really clean.",1,,

38,Nicole W.,"Troy, MI",50,164,598,5.0,3/19/2018,"Very trendy spot on the lower East side. Reservations are required and you are given a 15 minute grace period if your running behind. The art work is amazing and the food is fantastic~ it is what you expect when dining at a Tao Group Property. Cocktails amazing and service was outstanding! There were 6 in our group and we each ordered a small plate and had plenty to eat.  (Sorry I was so excited to try the food I forgot to take some pics) FYI if the dish only comes with 2 or 3 items they will add and charge you additional so that everyone can try. It was my friends birthday and they brought out a cupcake with a lit candle and it was delicious! Downstairs you will find another bar and music so you can dance and have fun!! Charge can be anywhere between $1,500.00 to $4,000.00 for a table and bottle service depending on where you wish to sit.",2,,
39,Monique V.,"Atlanta, GA",136,148,663,4.0,2/28/2018,"Vandal was a really nice trendy restaurant, very spacious, free coat check, and lots of cool decor for photo opportunities.My friend made a reservation for 8:30 PM, God knows why she made it that early but even though it was that early we still waited about 30-45 minutes to be seated. But it was fine because we indulged in $17 drinks to keep us preoccupied. We were finally seated in a very large booth room enough for 6 of us. We were immediately greeted by our waitress even though they were slim she was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Tbh I was shocked at the amount of stuff on the menu considering previous pictures and reviews only showed the same 4-5 items. Plus I figured people only came to vandal to drink and nosh.Anyway I ended up ordering the scallops after I saw the size of them. The woman behind me had them and they were huge! They come with a creamy orzo and corn mixture the dish was absolutely delicious.My best friend ordered the salmon with pearl couscous it was delicious as well. The only complaint for my table was that they couldn't split our meals and at the end of our dinner everyone was trying to pay with a card and they only except up to 3 cards, which makes sense as to not over complicate things. Anyway it was all worked out I would definitely come to vandal again.P.S. after dinner we waited in line to get into the club downstairs andFYI the entry is $75 if you don't get on someone's guest list. So make sure you find a guest list.",3,,3

YeahOverallThe place is unassuming in the outside and the decor inside is a bit out there, but the food is great, which I did not expect. Favorite dish: Wild Mushroom PizzaI usually like meat on my pizzas, but this mushroom pizza was so good without any meat that I now question that. The pizza was juicy and flavorful, and the crust was just thin enough to provide a base to support the taste of the pizza itself. Great dish!Also got: Crispy Cauliflower TacosThis was surprisingly good as well! The tacos were juicy and well flavored.Ambience Again, the decor was a bit out there. It was nice though, nothing to complain about.",,,

The buns and the cauliflower tacos is a MUST! Not a big fan of the meatballs but definitely try the sopes. For the dessert we got the vandal smore ( not my favorite ) and the Highlight of the night was the strawberry cream cake which was just perfect. The only thing that lower the experience is that the reservation was for 5 but the 5 was joining an hour later and they didn't want to seat us until everyone was there. So we waited for and hour and half to get seated when the restaurant was empty.",,,
42,Amelia H.,"Brooklyn, NY",51,76,190,4.0,2/25/2018,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!I have been dyyyying to go here for years. This was everything I wanted plus more. We didn't get a drink other than champagne bottle so I can't attest to the drink reviews. It was the perfect volume level. We had no problem hearing one another, which was awesome for a place you thought you would. I have three issues with the place;-I wish the appetizers were 4 a plate not 3 a plate. It's hard to share HALF a small taco. -The other issue was the chicken parm did not come with any spaghetti, which would have been awesome to have together--but I guess it worked out because then I was able to finish the MASSIVE portion it was.-The ravioli portion size was 6 raviolis. NOTHING in comparison to the chicken parmesan size. I don't like places that cannot keep consistency between entree portions. It does not make sense.The service was pretty standard, he wasn't friendly but he wasn't a bad server. Fast & did not get anything wrong.The food was BEYOND delicious. GET THE WILD MUSHROOM STREET PIZZA. The dessert was great as well. No complaints with how great the food was. Really loved the interior & everything about this place.",2,,

I love all the art and how it's decorated. I am a sucker for a fresh dining experience. Came in 15 minutes early for our reservations and got seated right away. The staff was all warm and friendly. The restaurant week menu was put together very well; the stand out with the PRIME SKIRT STEAK which came with chinese sausage fried rice, sunny side up egg, scallions, and chile. We also tried the crispy bao buns, sticky rice dumplings and the old school chicken parm(must have if you love cheese). Everything was phenomenal. For dessert, we had the Irish coffee milkshake shots which were terrific. Very much looking forward to coming back to try out the lounge.",2,2,5
44,Ross H.,"New York, NY",347,106,436,4.0,2/6/2018,"I came to Vandal during restaurant week, and definitely had a good experience.I had heard this place is a nightlife location and gets packed on the weekends, so i was interested to see how their dinner service would be on a week night.It is an extremely large location, plenty of room for sitting at a table for some privacy, or standing in the bar area with others. I came with four people and we were seated right away.The restaurant week menu was great. They had a lot of options, which for restaurant week i was expecting the menu to be a little bit more on the limited side. I had the Bao Buns, Skirt steak, and the Churros.The Bao Buns were the best thing out of the three by far. Crispy but soft buns with a lot of different flavors and textures. Truly a great dish, and from what the server said, one of the best things they have. The skirt steak was served over Thai fried rice and also had a fried egg on top. The steak was cooked perfectly, as it is easy to over cook a skirt steak. There were a lot of asian inspired flavors to the dish, i would defiantly recommend it if you are in the mood to try something a little different. The Churros was the dish the surprised me the most. They were served with a very spicy chocolate sauce. I had no idea it was spicy so when i tried it i was expecting simply a chocolate sauce. Be aware!The drinks here are expensive, as is the dinner menu, so if you are coming here expect to spend $15-20 per cocktail. My old fashioned cost $20.",2,1,1
45,Jihan N.,"London, United Kingdom",74,45,38,3.0,11/8/2018,I really think I liked the atmosphere and decore more than the food. Good for grabbing a couple drinks with friends if you're in a group.

46,Katie H.,"New York, NY",354,203,100,3.0,7/2/2018,"This place was all about the vibe, but there are other places in the area that have better food with an even better vibe. My friend and I came on a Thursday night and ordered the sticky rice dumplings ($14), the crispy bao buns ($16), Prime skirt steak ($46), and the churros! The interior is pretty cute with all of the art murals on the walls, it's loungey and hip. It's definitely a weekend type of dinner. The music is loud and the crowd looks great. Definitely a place where you can dress like you're going out. Our favorite appetizer was probably the crispy bao buns. They were so unique and delicious! The steak I thought was cooked really well, but the entire dish just kind of came out lukewarm. The rice wasn't piping hot and neither was the steak. I think that kind of ruined the meal a little bit for me. The flavors of the food were also not authentic at all. I know Vandal is supposed to be a fusion type restaurant, but it was highly americanized and just pretty flat in flavor. Overall, I don't think that I would return. The food was kind of expensive, understandably for the ambiance and the trendiness of the restaurant; however, there are other places that promote the same type of atmosphere for better food.",1,,1
47,Heidi B.,"Chapel Hill, NC",204,48,37,5.0,1/6/2018,"This review is for both the restaurant and the lounge - my friends and I did both in the same night. Food was fresh, seasoned well and unique! Picky eaters and foodies alike will be satisfied with the menu. My Autumn Sakura cocktail was beautifully simple and yummy. Service was wonderful; we noticed that our water glasses were never empty, and the staff is happy to give recommendations.The lounge has a heated indoor waiting area which is a huge perk in this bitter NY winter! The bouncers were courteous and coat check was complimentary. VIP service in the lounge was comfortable and not cramped. There were always fresh glasses for us. The DJ played fun hip hop classics of the 2000s with occasional EDM bass hits which were great for dancing.My review for Vandal is 5 stars because the overall experience was wonderful and I really had no complaints. Will return next time I'm in the city.",4,,1

49,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,3.0,12/15/2017,"Well I said I'd never go back to another place owned by the Tao group after one of their locations treated me and my company really, really badly. But that same company chose this venue for our annual Christmas party so...who am I to turn down a good time?To their credit, our servers went above and beyond to make sure we always had drinks and anything else we needed. Servers were encouraging us to dance, taking our phones for photos, really doing a great job of us making feel welcomed. The hospitality was on point, so good on them.The environment is just not for me. They did play a good amount of 90's dance-able throwback music, so if you want to dance during dinner, this is the place. People get up from their seats to dance in the general vicinity of their tables. There were many 23 year old's from different states who gush about how incredible and amazzzzzing New York is. The place is decorated to look good in your selfie, so go ahead and take shameless advantage. The signature cocktails were downright undrinkable at points, I tried four different mixed drinks before switching to beer. The vegetarian stuff particularly rubbed me the wrong way, but even the tacos and the lobster mac n cheese all felt like poor attempts at what an outer-borough Irish pub might serve if they were trying to cash in on high end gimmicky food trends, but without the greasy spoon charm. Harsh? Maybe, but you're not here for the food. If you do want something solid, invest in the seafood tower. Raw oysters, shrimp, and lobster were delicious.It's an overpriced playpen for people who aren't from here, and it's highly successful at being what it is. I think they were trying to emulate a Lower East Side aesthetic...I can't really comment on that. If Disney made a ride based off the LES, Vandal would be that ride, so buy a ticket if that's your thing.",4,5,3
50,Sigalit S.,"Brooklyn, NY",300,19,0,2.0,11/4/2018,Pros: Good food and nice environment. Cons: Front Dining room was cold & portions are SMALL for the price. We were all shocked when we saw the size of the Pretzel tartar. WOW It was MINIATURE. I wish I took a photo. Nothing like shown in the pics.  Server was nice at first but became pushy about us ordering more drinks and food. It was unnecessary especially because we all ordered an ample amount. Lastly for my friends birthday he said he would put a candle on the s'mores dessert which he did not. They brought out the two desserts we ordered without any candle. Than I commented where is the candle and 5 minutes later they brought out a chocolate cupcake with a candle. The bill came out and of course they charged us for both desserts and comped the cupcake that we didn't want. It's silly especially because the waiter said whatever we choose will be the birthday dessert. Bad move on the waiters part because his tip would have exceeded 20 % and it was a hefty bill. So he lost out. So watch ur pockets when dining there. I love a good meal and don't mind spending but I don't like being pushed around and being taken for a fool. Btw it was still early and not packed yet so there were no excuses.,,,

Another fun thing to do is to shoot videos on their digital frame; the clips can be sent right to you email.  When you are feeling tired and need a boost of energy, they have a fun coffee cart where you can get espresso.Only recommendation is to have more friendly greeters at the door.",1,,
53,Channelle R.,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",14,55,130,4.0,2/19/2018,"Visited Vandal for an early dinner date. I enjoyed the ambiance and it was pretty quiet early in the evening. We started with the Short Rib Tacos and Red Snapper Tostadas. The Short Rib was super good, tender and flavorful. I never had snapper before and I was really pleased with these tostadas. For the mains we had the Old School Chicken Parm and the 16oz NY Strip. The chicken parm was to die for... really great flavor. I'm not a big fan of strip steak but the seasonings were good and the spinach and matchstick potatoes were a good addition. We ordered sweet potato fries as a side. I typically don't eat sweet potato fries but these were delightful. Super light and nicely seasoned. For the dessert we had the Vandal S'mores. Reallllyyy amazing!!! The s'more was delicious but after a while got a little too sweet but the graham cracker ice cream was an unexpected surprise. I like Beauty and Essex so I was pleasantly surprised that Vandal was as good!",,,
54,Amber B.,"Hudson County, NJ",713,309,861,4.0,11/21/2017,"I don't know how I feel about this place. I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday with a group of 8 and although most of the party arrived almost an hour over reservation time (5:30 p.m), we were still very well taken care of and seated without a problem. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. Our waiter was great and made sure that every single thing we needed was taken care of. The thing I liked most about him was his ability to engage in conversation with the whole table, offer us the best desserts, drinks and what his favorite menu item was (for us first timers). I would say for the service alone, Vandal deserves a 4.5/5. The main let down for me was the amount of food for what you pay. I ordered the burger and it just wasn't fulfilling and the salt and vinegar fries were a miss! My suggestion to Vandal would be indicate that the fries are salt and vinegar because had I known that, they def wouldn't have been ordered. The frose (drink) was AMAZING! And I would def recommend it for anyone looking for a good drink on the menu. I didn't hear too many complaints around the table other than the one stated above. "" The portion sizes compared to prices just don't match"". A few items that were ordered consisted of pizza,big sexy burgers, paella, old school chicken parm, tacos, etc... The Vandal video booth is a great addition and def something to visit while here, BUT don't have the video booth right outside the bar and in the way of traffic. While workers are trying to get food to tables, they shouldn't have to constantly be bombarded by individuals taking pictures and videos. I really did like Vandal enough to come back. This just isn't some place I would visit if I were super hungry but rather for a small bite, a drink and some fun. Don't forget to head down to the lounge after your meal for music, drinks and dancing! So, I would say I'm a fan but please make your small tapas just a little bit bigger.",10,4,6

Came here for a birthday with a menu uniquely prepared for the event and it didn't disappoint!My favorite part of any menu- the dessert- was stellar! The margarita soft baked cookies had an amazing after taste that kept me going for more ( or 10 more ). The churro with the glaze dip on the side should be illegal because it could easily be a diabetic hazard ( jokes people) For appetizers, for vegetarians, the shishito peppers are mildly spicy and easy to snack on! The shrimp cocktail is pretty much the same anywhere so I'm always happy (:The dish that was definitely a winner was the jerk spiced salmon. The quinoa on the bottom was cooked perfectly and blood orange gastrique paired beautifully! If I was never on a budget, I'd go every week!",1,,

Vibe is like what you want if you were a tourist in NYC (maybe?). Dark, graffiti, trying to be funky and trendy and pretty much working. Groups of 16-40 year olds celebrating all kinds of things. A lot of drinking which works because they have the club downstairs. Drinks are very good and strong. I had the palmitas.",,,

They served us a set menu for our company event, and highlights besides the steak included squash tacos and salmon. The drinks were also on point, and service was fast and friendly. The place is swanky and offers a nice vibe for starting off your weekend on a Thursday. The basement turns into a club/lounge later in the evening and it's fun to see what types of people turn up. The appetizers they served us, including a bunch of different kinds of meatballs, were all phenomenal. It seems like a wonderful place to host an event and I would definitely like to return. Plus, the fusion/street themes combined with the prices are so NYC cool that you can't help but feel pretty upscale here.",,,

The food was excellent and we did not find ourselves rushed. It's very loud so if you are going there on a date to have a romantic conversation or just catch up with friends, that probably not going to happen.The place draws a lot of people and the crowd is very young for the most part. We had a table of 8 teenagers next to us. I don't know if I would go back as I can get food that is just as good or better in so many places. We had a bottle of wine and sampled a few appetizers.  We had the snapper tostada's, chilean sea bass tacos, short rib tacos, lobster sopes, dumplings and the shrimp tempura. We shared the main courses which was the halibut, salmon, and skirt steak. For sides we had the polenta and eggplant. There was no disappointment with food or service although the beginning and end of the night can be a little hectic. There were a lot of people waiting to be seated and simple things like the coat check can take a number of minutes while you wait on line.",,,

As soon as we arrived we were seated, the service here was fantastic and the place has an extremely lively vibe that I haven't experienced anywhere else. Now the food was exceptional we started off sharing the Steak Tartare hot pretzel, Grilled sea bass tacos and the crispy bao buns which were all delicious!

Best of all- they catered to our vegetarians beautifully, making sure they had a few separate options to fill in when meat was served.I highly recommend having an event here.  Amazing.",1,,2
64,Mel-Lisa S.,"New York, NY",121,45,92,4.0,11/2/2017,"I was taken here for a bday dinner. I'm not sure if you need a reservation or not but it was very easy to be seated when we arrived because of our reservation. We went on a Wednesday night and it was quite packed. The ambiance is very cool NYC, the rooms are huge and I saw that there were many seating areas, especially for large groups.  We ordered lobster Mac and cheese, the cripsy bao buns, and the pan roasted salmon. First, we assumed because the salmon was a large platter it could be shared for two parties and it was not, I was very disappointed. It too long for them to make it so preferring another platter was not the best decision. It was delicious though. The bao buns is a must order, that as well blew us away. And finally, the Mac and cheese was served on a hot plate which kept the cheese bubbling throughout the meal. Not much lobster for the price $19 but it was good.My ABSOLUTE favorite thing was the dessert. We had the Greek donut and I would be back to eat that again, if anything.Great place to try out on a special occasion, worth the try at least one time.Tip: the drinks are definitely worth the money, very strong.",3,1,
65,Laurel F.,"New York, NY",351,254,539,4.0,10/23/2017,"I visited Vandal with a group of 6 for a friend's birthday and had such a great time! The restaurant definitely puts off an upscale, modern, trendy vibe; and the price definitely matches it. We were seated in the front room at a large circular table. Our waitress was also very friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend the Icy Grape ($17) cocktail. Who would have known vodka and grape juice pair so well! I know $17 for a cocktail is kind of absurd, but this restaurant is owned by the Tao Group, so overpriced menu items are expected lol. My group ordered a bunch of menu items and shared them. I will list and rank my favorites below:Small plates:1. Grilled sea bass tacos ($24) - My favorite! Definitely recommend; loved the chipotle slaw2. Shrimp mofongo ($21) - definitely recommend; shrimp were large & perfectly cooked 3. Chicken tortilla soup dumplings ($18) - average but worth a try4. Sticky rice dumplings ($17) - not a fan & honestly could live withoutLarge plates:1. Skirt steak ($45) - definitely recommend; steak melted in my mouth! Comes over fried rice 2. Flash seared Tuna ($32) - also recommend; comes served rare/cold, great seasoned crust & absolutely deliciousSides:1. Lobster Mac & cheese ($19) - recommend; very rich and creamy; I love the pasta style/cut, have never seen it before 2. Miso soy glazed crispy eggplant ($12) - not a fan & could live without; overly seasoned and way too friedThey also brought out a delicious chocolate cupcake with purple frosting for my friends birthday! It was sweet, moist and a delicious end to a great meal!",3,2,3
66,Heather M.,"New York, NY",35,180,822,4.0,11/21/2017,"I came here for my birthday when it first opened and came again recently for a friend's birthday. The space is absolutely lovely and has great music and a good energy. The menu offers various options for picky eaters but also has some interesting pairings. Both times I went, we all ordered different things and just passed them around tapas-style for everyone to try. I don't think anyone had any major problems with their order and the staff was really helpful but everyone really liked the bao buns. Be prepared to spend a decent amount on food and drinks and take a look at the menu before you go. Service can either be a bit slow or a bit pushy/fast as they try to keep each table within their reservations since they allow back-to-back reservations with a short turn-over window. Please make reservations, bc unless it's an early weekday or close to closing hour, walk-in seating would be tough here. They have a cool boomerang-like photo booth and small night club lounge as you make your way down to the lower level.",1,,2
67,Tracy D.,"Merrick, NY",267,413,2012,3.0,5/1/2018,"I came here the past weekend after dinner with friends for my bachelorette weekend since the initial Vegas plans were foiled in March due to the crazy snow storms. We wanted to go to check out the club area that was separate entrance from the restaurant/ bar, but it was too rainy for us to wait outside on line and get soaked in rainwater. Instead we decided to check out the bar to just grab drinks. Vandal has a real artsy look to the decor of the place with lots of interesting paintings, a giant bunny statue and a very industrial feel on this side of the venue. The bar was packed around 12am, but eventually we were able to hang by the bar to grab some drinks. The drinks were not the best I've had in the city, but for $17 cocktails I'd expect much better. My friend and I felt that a couple of the cocktails we ordered didn't have enough of one element or another to make the drink perfect. The staff was nice enough to fix it though if we didn't like how it was prepared. There are couches opposite of the bar available to sit, however they require you to open a tab to sit there. Eventually we moved there for more room. Our waitress for the table service was very nice and made sure we liked our mixed drinks and had enough water in our glasses. When we ordered shots, she had them brought on a cute pink stand which was impressive.Lots of people used this boomerang photo booth they had in an area between the bar and the other side of the restaurant. It's a cute idea, except the placement of the booth can cause some traffic jam when the bar is busier and a bigger group is using it. Overall it was and okay experience here. Not sure if I'll be back in the near future, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",1,3,4

69,Cassie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",334,176,510,4.0,10/1/2017,I have been invited a bunch of times to group dinners here but did not actually make it here until recently for NYC restaurant week. It was Babes' pick which I ended up enjoying without him. I made reservations on OpenTable about a week in advance and there was no wait time upon arrival for my party of 2.Our server was attentive and made some good recommendations but I arrived already knowing what I was going to get. Even better was that the guy next to us had ordered all the same items and was raving about each one. Fish tacos were yummy; I love sea bass. The steak fried rice combo was delicious without being greasy; the steak was cooked perfectly to medium as I requested. Oh and the dessert hit the spot; ice cream macaroon sandwich was sweet but tart and filling. The frozen yogurt was better than expected. The vibe here was turned up even at 7 PM on a Friday. The decor was vibrant. The bathroom were clean. Overall great dining experience. Regular prices might be too steep for a cheap self!,8,4,8

71,Asher W.,"New York, NY",276,209,583,2.0,5/23/2018,"Have to say I wasn't a huge fan. Finding out that its a Santos joint I was excited to go for dinner. We went with friends on a Friday night. The place is cool. Its your stereotypical trendy New York restaurant/lounge type hybrid. Its got a ton of space, like absurd amount. Its also cool because while you are waiting to be seated there is a ton of open seating in bar area. The drinks were very meh. We got a few different ones. The jalapeno tequila one was good but the tea based one was terrible as was another we tried.Once we were seated service was great. But the food was pretty lackluster. It was a bunch of small dishes, which I get, its nice to try many things. But, it was overpriced and very small. We got like 12-14 for 5 and it really wasnt enough. Would have been one thing if the dishes were $8-14 but they were more like $16-24. Just not economical for the quality. I will say it was nice that they were willing to change the quantity of number of pieces in each dish based on our party. Which is unusual. Good dishes - the rice balls with meat, the tortilla soup dumps (very small tho), the cauliflower tacos were the bombMeh dishes - pizza, lamb meatballs, tartare pretzelsOverall this was probably a one stop shop for me. Won't be returning. Rather take my talents to other Santos restaurants.",1,,
72,Sharon T.,"Queens, NY",850,1051,1785,3.0,10/7/2017,"My review is pretty much written on a clean slate, as I've never been to Chris Santos' other trendy hotspots, Beauty & Essex and The Stanton Social, so I can't make any comparison.I first came here for my farewell surprise dinner from a coworker. Not going to lie--my eyes widened when I saw the prices for some (ahem, MOST) of the menu items. Expect paying an upwards of $20+ for small-portioned food. They don't have any Happy Hour specials, either. My friend also had a 10-person birthday dinner; she originally reserved a table for 8, tentatively, but the staff insisted that we wait for the rest of the party to arrive--while 7 of us were already seated and had ordered our food. We were finally seated at a larger table when our entire party came. Service is overall good here and the staff is seemingly knowledgeable about their menu items.Some highlights:Roasted Zucchini ($12): A refreshing medley of zucchini, tomatoes, toasted almonds, mint and ricotta cheese, this is a great shareable side dish to go with your entrees (since they don't all come with sides).Chicken + Waffle Mac and Cheese ($17): There aren't really waffles, but rather crunchy cheddar crumbs with bits of chicken. The Tabasco adds a spicy touch that doesn't go too well with very creamy texture, IMO.Chilean Sea Bass ($38): One of the better dishes but Chilean Sea Bass, as we know it, is generally expensive. Beautifully pan seared and perfectly tender and buttery, but serving it with bak choy and peas for the high price tag--really?! Chipotle Shrimp Arepas ($21): So, you are basically $7 for an arepa, which is hardly one at all. It is hors d'oeuvre-sized that is smaller than your palms.Bone-in Filet ($58): Probably my favorite dish of all the ones I've tried, but very pricey. Not the best steak I've ever had, but the foie butter and garlic confit was a fancy touch that made it so tender.Las Palmitas ($17): A cool, refreshing citrusy cocktail infused with Ilegal Mezcal that's perfect for the summer. Spicy notes with Thai basil leaves for some zing and aroma.Will probably not be a choice of mine to come here other than for the drinks, although I can see why people like this place. The service can be great and the interiors are very detailed and decked out--blends in with the whole Lower East Side vibe.",3,1,1
73,Angelina M.,"Bronx, NY",32,73,101,5.0,12/6/2017,Came here for brunch last Sunday with friends and had a really great time. I was initially intrigued by the restaurants decor but the food was just as great. We had a problem with a mess up on one of the orders and the manager came by right away and rectified the situation without us asking for him. He also came back afterwards to make sure everything was good. Over all we had a really good time and Sunday brunch is a good time to go if you're looking for something low key. Ps. I highly recommend the salt & vinegar fries,,,
74,Teresa L.,"East Rockaway, NY",40,119,920,5.0,11/29/2017,"Talk about a showstopping personally unexpected visit to Vandal on Bowery in lower east side last night. A chic graffiti art style exterior explodes into an amazing breakdancing grape colored glass like bunny entrance. It reminded me of being at a casino in AC, adorned with the most beautiful blown glass art fixtures.Went in towards the bar area for an after work event cocktail and appetizer before returning home. Was acknowledged  pretty quickly by friendly bartenders, which is always great. Note i was there in 8p hour, so I'm sure that helped being after prime time for a weeknight (Monday).Selected to try their 'Spicy Korean Rice Cakes' for it sounded like it would pair well with my drink selection 'The Ritter Spicy Margarita'. It's  made with Casamigos Blanco Tequila (1st time try, as I personally love Don Julio silver.), Cointreau and Jalapeño. The Korean Rice Cakes came out ironcally looking like little bite size Italian gnocchi. They had a slight crispy exterior that lead into a soft/tender center. The sauce wasn't too spicy at all, so don't worry (non-spice lovers)! Personally expected a touch more on heat, but I suppose it was just enough as it indeed paired well with my Jalapeño magarita.Enjoyed experience very much. Would definitely go back to try out more of what appeared to be a diverse menu. Would say definitely a little something for everyone.",,,

76,Gary M.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,5,2,5.0,6/21/2018,"Vandal has been a constant for the past two years when I traveled every other month between LA and New York. From the entrance to every different dining rooms, it makes sure you know you're not in any regular restaurant. To start things off, their cocktail menu is average size but every drink has been pretty good. My two favorites are Off the Wall and the Intervention. Their New York Pretzel Steak Tartare never disappoints and it's definitely one of their must haves. A few other things we never not order are the Sticky Rice Dumplings, Bao Buns, and Seared Scallops. It's a place where you can start an early dinner and stay late into the night. The decor is modern and unique while the service is tremendous. There are so many restaurants in New York but I'd say Vandal is definitely a must go.",,,

The whole atmosphere is so creative with art installations all over the place. It's the perfect Instagram location. The service is really good and the food is amazing. We had the yellow tail crudo, the fresh shucked oysters,  the pan seared scallops and the simple grilled salmon. All the dishes were delicious. The cucumber margarita is a must try.

80,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,5.0,8/21/2017,"It takes a lot to win me over; Vandal was able to accomplish this task with good food, wonderful decor and good service. I came here on a Saturday evening-- it started off a little rocky because despite having a reservation, I was given a beeper and told when it rang my table was ready. Unfortunately, after about 30 minutes of no activity, the misses because flustered, and wanted to leave. I made my way back to the hostesses (they had three, which is helpful) I was told the table just opened up.We made our way through the crowd, were seated toward the back. Music was bumping, people looked excited-- it just seemed like everyone was having a great time. We ordered drinks and food at the same time since we only had about an hour before we had to leave. We had the Roasted Tostadas (too spicy for me), Margarita Pizza (tasted great) and Pan Roasted Salmon with Quinoa (Salmon was ok; I thought the Quinoa was great). I thoroughly enjoyed this place--everything was almost perfect except the wait time in the beginning and the large crowds of people you have to side step. Also, the food takes quite awhile to come out, so you may want to eat a little something prior to arrival. The Sangria was probably the strongest I've ever had in my life. Both the hostess and server made a point to say Happy Birthday, which shows they actually read the Open Table message, and prices were fair.All and all, it's a place to definitely visit at least once in life. I would use the phrases hip or trendy when describing Vandal-- but without the pretentious vibe. Do order the Sangria, and most importantly, don't forget to visit the photo booth.",4,1,1

Updated review",This was my first visit for my friends birthday and we had reservations on a Friday but still waited about 40 minutes. My feet slowly died while waiting but i guess that's not their fault. It's a very trendy and busy place. Everyone wants to take pictures with the purple breakdancing bunny statue which is located right at the entrance/exit so getting a picture on a busy night is a difficult thing to do. The cheesy parmesan chicken was delicious!!!! The music is the best part of this experience. R&B and hip hop and it's loud. The drinks are pretty pricey at $17+ per drink and not very large either. I would recommend going for drinks elsewhere. I did enjoy my experience I just wish I had gotten a picture with the bunny and that my feet hadn't died. I'd definitely go back in my comfortable shoes and on a less busy night. Great date spot.,,,

Updated review","Came back here for dinner and I actually enjoyed it more than brunch.The dining area is massive, beautiful decor, setup was perfect for dates or for intimate groups alike.I enjoyed sangria with added raspberries (a drink I ordered because my date ordered that as her cocktail-__-don't judge me). And I gotta give it up for the bartender--it was strong!!Meal itself were the salmon tacos and the wild mushroom pizza. Both were outstanding--especially ther pizza.We were unfortunately too full to even consider entrees or dessert, but I can guarantee we will return!",1,,1

I came here for a friend's birthday brunch and there weren't many people there.Which leads me to the service; despite not having many people there, it was incredibly slow. Sloth like even. It took us an hour to get our food. They were slow on drinks and giving us our check.We ordered cauliflower tacos for the table; they were particularly tasty. I ordered a jerk salmon BLT; my family is Jamaican and they had Scotch bonnet aioli as an ingredient of the dish, so my interest was piqued.Alas I was disappointed; the salmon was overcooked and I tasted nary a spice. The bacon was good and I'm glad there was avocado in the sandwich. They did have frosé drinks (frozen rosé) and they were really strong! I loved them.Overall if you care more about ambience, this is your place. If you care about ambience AND flavor, I'm sure there are other places that will satiate your needs. But their drinks are superb and I loved that.",,,

This place was almost empty at first but filled up very quickly as the night went on. Nice bar area with lots of seats. Cocktail prices are steep at $17 dollars each but at the bar it's $9 dollars on select cocktails during weekdays. We ordered the crispy bao buns for appetizer and that was delicious at a steep price of $17 dollars for two (and they were small). Nice marinated brisket  that were flavorful. For dinner I had the salmon with quinoa. That was just very average. I had a bite of my friend's seabass and tuna and both were also just very average. The waitress knew we were celebrating our birthdays and came out with 2 chocolate muffins with candles at the end. That was nice but the muffin was a dry.

On July 26th my friend was attempting to make Sunday brunch reservations at Vandal NYC for a group of us. However, she's vegan and the vegan options for Sunday brunch are limited. Therefore, she called to see if it would be feasible to order some of the vegan options under the Dinner menu. The receptionist went to check with the Kitchen and they couldn't guarantee the vegan dinner options. She continues to ask how many people are vegan. My friend replies she's the only one and host/receptionist replies ""well, if you're the only vegan everyone else should be fine.""This is completely unacceptable and I'm quite shocked at their customer service as I've dined here before and loved it!I reached out to Vandal via their IG and Facebook pages and interestingly enough they went ahead and deleted my comment.",1,,

Bao bunny was good- good flavor, nice and juicy. Tortilla dumpling soup was much enjoyable and great combination of pozzole broth and poblano cheese. Shrimp tempura roll - nothing special at all. Steak tartare pretzel my less favorite - creative idea but no flavor at all. New York strip - steak not well seasoned ( if its a good  quality steak , you don't need much seasoning ) quality of this steak was just average. Seared scallops, was actually seared to perfection.

For food we ordered:Tuna and Salmon Poke Bowl - thought this had great flavors Shishito peppers - love theseCrispy Bao Buns - deliciousRed snapper toastados - amazingArepas - my boyfriend ate all these since they were gluten free2 orders of sea bass tacos - these were awesome as wellBone in filet with Foie butter, so perfect with subtle notes of the foie Skirt steak - someone else in our party ordered this for himself and it looked good, but filet looked betterCauliflower taco - I didn't try these but they looked goodMargarita pizza - again didn't try but looked very good, though probably wouldn't have thought about ordering pizza hereSalt and vinegar fries - loved the sauce and only slight salt and vinegar flavor, they were very goodSoy glazed eggplant - I wish these were a little crispier For dessert we ordered the s'mores dessert, which if you're at all like me and love smores you must order this.Overall with about 2-3 drinks per person and the food it came out to $115 per person, which I thought made sense.  I look forward to coming back for dinner.Club: I had also previously come here with a group of girl friends to go to the club downstairs and we had no problem getting in and had a great time!",2,1,3
98,Sargam M.,"Manhattan, NY",78,156,0,3.0,2/21/2018,"If you're going to Vandal, it's not for the food. This place is very scene-y, and makes for a fun night out....just like the group's other restaurant Tao.The restaurant has a quirky decor with Geishas in various stages of undress, the vibe is dressy, the place is packed until midnight (even though it's a humongous space by nyc standards, with 3 separate dining areas), and the music gets progressively louder as the night progresses. After midnight the lower level lounge gets packed, and rightly so...the music is very dance-worthy :)The menu is a crowd pleaser, with dishes across cuisines - sashimi, dumplings, tacos, pasta, pizza, etc., etc. Everything we ordered was fine, but nothing registered as either amazing or below par - so no dishes to call out here.All in all, don't expect culinary greatness....and Vandal can be a super fun night!",,,

102,Jennifer N.,"New York, NY",929,198,126,4.0,5/21/2017,"So I don't know why I thought I wrote a review for this place when I did not. So here it is. Dined here last summer of 2016; one of my best friend whom moved back to cali :( To be honest don't remember what we ordered but I remember the food being great. There were no complaints about it. Definitely jammed packed back to back. Arrived with a party of 5 and even though we did not getting seated on time. We ended up waiting at the bar and it was just stunning. Art work was just fascinating.Service was ok I guess; nothing against the waitress but it was kind of annoying having to shout to speak over ordering food and constantly saying ""what"" because you can't hear your own waitress. Place kind of reminded me of Bagetalle except less expensive and not so trashy. There was a table behind us louder than the background music and annoying. One of them must have been feeling extra because she decided to take a photo on the table and literally broke the entire table. Everything shatter from the plates to the glasses. #stayclassynottrashyI would honestly say this place is definitely less pretentious then what most places are. Just grown adults getting overdressed for dinner. I would come back for brunch; perhaps dinner again.",9,5,4
103,Nicole P.,"Richmond, VA",7,72,78,3.0,12/29/2017,"Visited vandal for the first time yesterday. The ambiance of vandal is nice, great place for pictures. They are famous for the purple upside down bunny. Everyone gathers around the bunny to take pictures. In regards to the food it is a little over priced and nothing to rave about. The eggplant is good, old school chicken parmigiana, the beef brisket and fish tacos are great dishes to try. The DJ last night played a good selection of music.",1,1,1
104,Heather R.,"New York, NY",212,248,234,3.0,1/12/2018,"Amazing place to be seen and take photos for Instagram, but don't make this your main meal. My recommendation is drinks and food at the bar, then someplace else for substance and to save money. The food is solid, but more like tapas and small plates.. Sashimi is amazing, Chipotle Shrimp Arepas, Caesar Salad, Crispy Bao Buns, Crab cake corn dog ... I'm from Texas, I think we invented food in corn dog form.. lol. It was all great, but not very filling and well, the drinks.. were pricey too. Beautiful presentation, good service, hip vibe,  food is good, but there are better places to eat without all of the mania.",1,,
105,R. R.,"North Providence, RI",7,278,523,4.0,2/19/2018,"Went during happy hour. Drinks were reasonable in price ($9 for $17 drinks). Had a very good sauvignon blanc, and a free shot of frose.",,,
106,Wendrich J. M.,"New York, NY",77,162,518,4.0,2/11/2018,"This place is really trendy and chic. The food is served in really small portions, so be ready to ask for a burger or multiple dishes. I came here for a dinner and the experience was great. Dante was our server he was so nice and attentive. Always checking on us an suggesting items from the menu that we would enjoy.I loved the atmosphere there, so urban yet so classy. People would really dress up to go there. I saw people bringing kids and I would say this is not a really kid friendly restaurant, leave them at home.The prices are moderately expensive, but I was invited by a good friend so I didn't have to pay.There are many good spots within the location to take pictures, starting at the lobby. The walls have massive paintings that are just amazing art pieces. One crazy thing that bothered me was that the restrooms have attendants who are basically there to be tipped. I am okay if that was just for the lounge because it's something typical at other places, but I feel it's not necessary for the restaurant area, especially if there are families taking their kids there. What a kid who goes to the bathroom will tip? Make no sense.Overall, the food tastes good, service is great and the building is beautiful. Plus, the lounge is right in the lower floor for people who likes dancing and drinking.",,,
107,Brittany T.,"Newburgh, NY",7,11,22,4.0,6/11/2018,"Nice atmosphere inside, the drinks were good and the food was average. Service was awesome and prompt.

108,Veronika O.,"Brooklyn, NY",293,40,21,5.0,2/28/2018,"I'm usually really skeptical when it comes to ""trendy"" places because they are usually overhyped as well as overpriced. My boyfriend and I made reservations two days before but we weren't expecting much. Vandal was nothing less than perfect. We were really pleased by everything from the very welcoming hostess, breath taking décor, as well as wonderful food we left the restaurant that night with the biggest smiles on our face. For appetizers we shared the short-ribbed tacos and the crispy bao buns both appetizers were great. For our main course we shared the 50-day aged 36 oz Tomahawk ribeye which cooked perfectly. I really recommend sharing the steak with someone because it is 100% worth trying.  This is a place worth trying and I will definitely be returning",,,
109,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,3.0,7/30/2017,"I could give this a solid 3.5. I love the atmosphere of the place. The decor is beautiful, sophisticated, and unique. It's also fun that there is a bar area and place to dance downstairs. The food is hit and miss. I got the crispy bao buns and they're delicious! Very flavorful, crispy, and something I'd go back for. It was a bit expensive ($15) for the 2 baos shown in my photo. I also go the chicken and waffles Mac and cheese. It wasn't anything spectacular or memorable. To be honest, I couldn't even tell it was a chicken and waffles version. I definitely would not order this again. Overall, loved the atmosphere and the baos, but it's quite pricey.",,,
110,Sam E.,"Los Angeles, CA",1465,396,4622,4.0,5/4/2017,"Came here for brunch. The space is a feast for the eyes from the moment you walk in and nothing short of a fun house feel. Part of the famous Chef Chris santos chain of restaurants, this place is unique and different. We were seated on the patio area where the large hedges block the outside where you still feel like you are indoors without the fuss of the outside. The menu screams a street food fare style food and mostly Asian street fare with a tinge of Mexican. We ordered a plethora of items. The table favorite was the crunchy French toast which is battered and deep fried with a red bean filling. The other favorite was the white pizza. Stay away from the Benedict which was just not good. The hummus and eggs were unique and different and paired well together. Service was slightly slower and although we were one of the first tables to be seated, the food took quite a long time.",9,3,4

112,Cara B.,"New York, NY",255,382,932,4.0,11/1/2017,"Came here for my birthday dinner because I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. I made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for 6 people on a Thursday night on opentable. I was a little hesitent after reading some of the reviews on yelp which said the food was subpar but I really wanted to try this plae and I was glad we did.The restaurant has a really cool vibe. I loved the paintings on the wall in the room we were sitting it. We sat in the front room of the restaurant which had exposed brick and cobblestone floors so I was a little annoyed because the heels of my Louboutins kept getting stuck which kind of ruined my shoes. I would have rather sat in the actually restaurant where it didn't feel like you were sitting in an outside patio but you win some you lose some. I drank the Taxi Line ($17) and it was very good. It tasted like a cucumber margarita. All the cocktail were around the same price but it is expected because this place is owned by the Tao Group so I was prepared to spend a pretty penny. For dinner, we decided to order a bunch of the small items, sides, and 2 entrees to share. It worked out very well. For the small items, we ordered grilled seabass tacos ( I didn't have one but I heard they were good), the shrimp mofongo (they were okay, the shrimp was good but the plantin tasted more like a cake), the chicken tortilla soup dumplings (definitely interesting but not my favorite), and the sticky rice dumplings (which I don't remember what they tasted like aka not memorable). For our large plates we ordered the skirt steak with was delicious and the friend rice is came with was really good! This was probably my favorite thing out of everything!! We also ordered the seared tuna which I did not try but my friends said it was good. For the sides, we ordered the miso soy glazed eggplant which I really enjoyed! I would get again with the skirt steak if I went back. We also ordered the lobster mac & cheese which was so good as well. It was very creamy and the pasta was different shape which I liked. Since it was my birthday they brought me over a chocolate cupcake with purple icing and it was amazing. My friends and I shared it but it was seriously one of the best cupcakes I have had!!Overall, for 6 people who each had a cocktail or 2 the bill came out to around $80 per person. I definitely enjoyed ordering multiple items so we were able to taste most of the menu and I might go back for a date night.",5,,2
113,Shantelle C.,"New York, NY",53,190,958,3.0,12/17/2017,"Vandal... Where do I even begin?Oh, I know... my boyfriend made a reservation for dinner for the two of us to celebrate my birthday. We had other people coming later in the night, so we only reserved for the two of us. We were running a bit late because of the traffic and my boyfriend called them, and they gave us an additional 30 minutes to arrive. They stated that if we did not arrive within 30 minutes of our reservations, it would be cancelled. When we arrived, we made it about 32 minutes late. We went up to the hostess, and she gave us a buzzer. Our reservation was not cancelled; awesome! The buzzer rang within like the first ten minutes! While waiting, I wanted to get a picture with the famous bunny, but there were people blocking it as they also waited for their reservations.Okay, so once the buzzer started blinking red, we went to the hostess and were seated. We ordered our food and I was not flattered. We had Crispy Bao Buns, which were good. We also had a Margherita Pizza; this pizza was fresh... but it was flat and nothing special. My boyfriend had the Old School Chicken Parm, which was the best plate of the night; my only problem with this dish is that it did not come with any pasta or garlic bread... The size of this plate was nice! I had the Big Sexy Burger, and no, I am not saying that it is big and sexy; that is actually the name. I do not know why they named the plate that, if there is nothing big or sexy about the burger. It was actually very small, but it did have two patties. This burger brought fries... sweat potato fries. When I requested for it to be changed, I was told that sweet potato fries is all they carry... and then on top of that, the fries were soggy and not crispy; YUCK! My boyfriend had the Icy Grapes, and as he got more, they got stronger.  Okay, so I forgot to mention earlier that my boyfriend had told them at the beginning that it was my birthday and he wanted them to bring out a cake... so once we were finished, the waitress asks if we want dessert, and he said that he wanted the cake he had requested at first; this girl caught an attitude for like no reason. Her entire demeanor changed.Okay, so once we were done with everything, we left... we are not the type of  people who stay sitting for hours after they finish eating, taking up space. Once we were outside, we received the call, that the other people were arriving. So once they came, they stated that they wanted to eat too, hahaha! So back inside we go. My boyfriend goes to the original hostess we saw, and asks if we can get a table. He was told that we could get a table downstairs, in the lounge if we put down a specific amount and get a bottle... this did not include what my boyfriend and I had already spent on dinner. If you read through the reviews, you can see how difficult it is to get to the lounge, so we did it.When we got to the lounge, there was a bunch of people sitting down, with nothing on their tables. We were about to get seated in like a small two person sofa, and I looked at my boyfriend confused... how were we going to all fit? So of course, my boyfriend said something and they offered us a nice booth, where there were three girls, doing absolutely nothing, with no bottle or food on the table. They really bumped them to give us that booth... and it was worth it. The food in the lounge was even worse... the pizza downstairs was not fresh.. it was cold. The shrimp mofongos were tiny... I wish I had taken a picture! I am not exaggerating when I say that they were the size of like a half dollar coin! the Moet was the best thing of the night, hahaha. You know they cannot mess that up!The food was mediocre, but it was so much fun... gratuity was included on the receipt, so that waiter had a very nice tip! Oh, we also requested that they put a bachata, and they did not. At first the music was whack.. then, they switched it up a bit and put reggae and all that!** From reading other reviews, I noticed that a lot of people were complaining about the customer service... that was not my case! I had an amazing time celebrating my birthday. Big shout out to the Vandal team!!!  XOXO.",1,,
114,Geraldine G.,"Toronto, Canada",210,348,617,4.0,5/6/2017,"This place wins hands down in customer service and atmosphere. It's lively and a great spot to bring friends for a good time.There were four of us and as a place that has so much buzz, all of us said, hands down the atmosphere was incredible. It had this energy that stuff was going on and you wanted to be part of it - even if that meant just being just as loud as everyone around you.We ordered a ton of dishes and overall - not bad food wise. The atmosphere makes me think the food was better than it was but really it was better than what I had anticipated for a 'buzz' restaurant. We tried the nori rolls, fluke ceviche, sticky rice, the korean cakes (my fave), the bao buns, fish tacos, cauliflower katsu and brussel sprouts. For all the food we ordered it was reasonably priced and tasted surprisingly good.One of my motivations for going was the amazing art work thats housed in this space. All I have to say is, wow - if you are a fan of contemporary street art - go!",3,2,1
115,LeAnne B.,"New York, NY",75,143,82,4.0,1/12/2018,"Unique spot - it's a massive place so prepare to wander through taking a gander at the art everywhere while you head back to your chair. They have coat check so that was handy and the food was definitely pretty good. The lobster mac and cheese was super rich and tasted great, but definitely could have used more lobster. The oysters were tasty as well, but one of mine had shell fragments in it that put me off. The oyster dish does come with avocado though and that's very tasty even to just eat out of the container rather than on the oyster. Tuna entree was a bit bland for me but the ice cream for dessert made up for it - they are not playing around with the three scoops because you get a lotttttt - it's certainly a dish to share. I would say definitely a good time here and nice to check out.",,,

The food is good and drinks here are great, but then the real reason you'd come here is the excellent vibe and the ambiance of the place.The space is extremely social-media friendly, right from the giant acrobatic bunny statue at the entrance to the trendy bar, from the vintage car near the nightclub entrance to the graffiti covered walls of the inner dining rooms. The crowd here is dressed to the nines and the entire setup gives a vibe of the kind of place that people go to see and be seen. The drinks we got were well made and strong, no complaints there whatsoever. As for the food, the concept is great (street-style food from around the world? Sign me up!) but the execution falls short. We got the heaven spot mini burger, the crispy bao buns, the street kebabs and the nori spiced tuna rolls. Everything was decent but we felt that the dishes were lacking the sort of punch that the restaurant delivers in every other aspect.Great restaurant overall, and it would be an easy choice for an awesome night out on the town. If they just amp up their food a little bit more, it would warrant a solid five stars.",3,1,1

If you are going for the experience cool, but be ready to be surrounded by 19 year olds everywhere. I probably won't be back.

119,Nicole G.,"San Francisco, CA",250,2,0,1.0,5/5/2018,I went to Vandal lounge last night. The bouncer requested that in order to get in there was a minimum of 75$ tab. I'm almost sure that this tab wasn't required for everybody. So in order to get in I had to give my credit card and drivers license to the promoter. (There were to men at the door a promoter guy and a bouncer) This guy walks me down to the bar and hands my card and id to the bartender which charged my card 75 plus 18% gratuity.Trust me the money wasn't the issue. The thirst of the venue is the problem for me. The thirst to get people to buy 3 to 4 drinks which equals about 75$ is the issue. Very tacky the whole situation. To be escorted to the bar with this man holding me id and credit card to make sure that I'm charge me a upfront fee. I'm truly disgusted.I already had 2 drinks upstairs at the vandal restaurant so why would I need so much drinks down stairs at the lounge.Is the place not making sales. The lounge honestly was not even that crowded. Honestly the place was ok. I just would never go back because of the forced 75$ minimum nonsense. If it wasn't for that I could have spent more. I went to Tao in Manhattan and vegas and they didn't do this nonsense. I only tolerated this foolishness because my sister was already down stairs waiting for me.,3,,

We made a reservation but still had to wait about 20 minutes after we arrived which I think is common for NYC.  We were celebrating a divorce so we actually received complementary glasses of wine when we arrived which was very nice.  The service was great and we had a really cool server with dreads that was awesome.  The food was a bit of a miss though.  This food is PRICEY!!! Maybe its just NYC standard but wow...and the portion sizes are small.  I was not wowed by anything I ordered and I chose two appetizers as my entree and a dessert.  I would definitely come back and go to the night club and possibly just pre-drinks at the upstairs bar before.,2,,
122,Kady D.,"Long Island City, NY",49,2,9,1.0,4/8/2018,"We decided to celebrate our friends' birthdays at Vandal last night. Drinks were good, food was okay - nothing to wax poetic about. Our waitress was competent.After dinner, around 12:30 am,  we decided to make our way to the lounge. We were told that we had to go outside and join the queue.There were less than ten people in line when we reached the door. They were all white. All members of our merry party were black. All the people in front of us were let in after the bouncer requested their Ids. No mention of a compulsory bar tab or table buy. Our turn- the bouncer asked how large our party was. There were 7 of us. 3 girls and 3 guys. Note that the group before us had a similar composition. The promoter/ person in charge of tables ( whatever your call these club going rainmakers) requested that our party either purchase a table with a $600 minimum or spends at least $50/person. We declined both offers. No other party before, and we will later witness later, were requested to make spend a minimum amount.We were shocked and annoyed as we had just spent $700+ at dinner, at that same establishment.We decide to wait on the side to see if our suspicions would be confirmed. After 15 very uncomfortable minutes waiting next to the bouncer, he finally broke. He let in a group of white people with only one request ""Ids please"". No minimum spend request.  When questioned on his decision, the bouncer explained that ""entrance his granted at the bouncer's discretion"". Ha!The kicker after about 10 people were let in with no minimum spend request- Rainmaker guy (obvi white) asked if we wanted to buy a table or proceed with a minimum bar tab. This was an example of overt racism and discriminatory door policies. We were treated as second zone party goers/ citizens and were expected to be let in at a higher premium than fellow white patrons. The sad part- a black man with the help of his white boss enforced it. Enjoy a photo presentation of ""It's 2018, yet black people are not wanted in our establishment""",6,,
123,Alysha C.,"Brooklyn, NY",247,94,77,4.0,5/21/2018,Randomly came here at 2am on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised by this place. So many clubs and bars in New York are tiny and while Vandal is in a basement it's very spacious. It's also a great semi upscale club without the snobby attitude you might get from the crowd at a similar club in Chelsea. The music was GOOD (all hip hop) and my friends and I had a great time dancing. I definitely want to head back here soon as it's so hard to find a nice club that plays hip hop that doesn't make you feel like you have to act or dress a certain way to get in. Two thumbs up for Vandal!,1,,
124,Silvia S.,"Chicago, IL",43,5,22,5.0,7/15/2018,"My sister and I went met there last night. We were very attracted by the atmosphere but a bit skeptical regarding food due to some of the reviews we read. We decided to try it anyway. Well, we had a great dinner! We ordered Bao, Chicken Tacos and Eggplant meatballs and sweet potatoes fries. Everything was delicious and tasty! Our fav probably Bao!!! Since we are Italians, we ended our dinner with a good espresso! The ambience is amazing, the music too. Unfortunately, people sometimes don't behave and it becomes very loud.",,,
125,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,118,0,3.0,10/27/2017,"Based on all of the hype about Vandal, the overall experience was underwhelming. I ordered the bao buns and fries, my dining companions had the sea bass tacos. The food was solid and I have no complaints, but I also wasn't overly impressed with the flavors in my small plate. The drinks were great. Our server was wonderful, she checked in the perfect amount of times. The restaurant was crowded and she didn't make us feel rushed, even tho we were only having a few drinks and apps.The ambiance was cool - some graffiti murals on the walls. I had some more expectations for the artwork. We dined next to some well known basketball players so if you're interested in eating next to ""known people"", you're in luck. Also- the lounge area was not for me. A typical NYC basement lounge, felt a little claustrophobic with the low ceilings. Also quality of everything down there could be a little bit nicer. Overall it's just a typical overrated les restaurant. People hyped this place up and as a result, my expectations were way too high. Standard food and nice decor, but wouldn't go out of my way to come back.",2,,

Updated review","After having a negative experience at my first time dining at Vandal, I was contacted by the manager to ensure that Vandal will meet my expectations again.I am very happy I went back again. The service was excellent! We were seated immediately for our 6:30 PM reservation. Our service Shane was very informative with the menu items and gave us some great recommendations! We started off with the ceviche, which was excellent! The ceviche was fresh and had the perfect amount of spice to it! The bao buns, one of their classics, is also a must try!  We were also given a few items on the house to try, which were amazing! Thank you Vandal for a wonderful experience! Can't wait to return again",5,,1

Lastly, I want to call out the drinks--if you like whiskey get ""The Intervention""--it was amazing!",,,
131,Camille G.,"Manhattan, NY",29,28,60,3.0,4/27/2018,Over priced food and drinks. Everything was just ok.  Cool place to impress out of town guests or a date. It is loud but not so much you can't hear. Bartenders was snobby but the waitress made up for it.,1,,1
132,Liliana M.,"New Rochelle, NY",90,25,58,3.0,4/7/2018,"Disappointing.. Atmosphere and decor were great, waiters were also great, however hostesses were horrible. I had reservations for 9:45 for my birthday and one of my guests was parking her car and was about 5 minutes late and they put us on a waiting list. 9 girls standing there waiting and waiting and when I was trying to speak to the hostess she was just so rude and disrespectful. She ignored me and wouldn't even answer my any of my questions. I considered walking out and going somewhere else that's how angry I was. I would not come back to this establishment because of that specific encounter. We made the best of the night but I don't recommend this place unless you want some nice photos. Their frozen Rosé was also pretty good.",2,,
133,Venise H.,"Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY",52,37,70,5.0,4/25/2018,Went on a Monday night was promptly greeted and seated great customer service the waiter was extremely helpful giving insights into the menu. The wait for drinks was a little slow and the food also took a bit to come but nonetheless we were not disappointed. I can't wait to go back and I'm definitely gonna refer this restaurant to anyone. It's a great ambiance and the decor is so dope.  I had the sea bass tacos to die for !! The sweet potato fries was ok coulda been better. Overall great experience,1,,

He sent us a complimentary Champaign bottle. We really had a great time, the table service was amazing. The music and vibe was great. There is a variety of age group from early 20s to young professional. We had an amazing time, and would definitely go back.",,,
136,Jess J.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",157,213,539,3.0,8/28/2017,"Brunch Review: I came here on a Saturday for a brunch date with my cousins, we had 1:30 reservations which probably weren't needed as the place was fairly empty.. I was actually a little shocked, I mean the place was nice, décor and ambiance are amazing. One thing I want to address because it's something I came on here looking for prior to my visit is parking.  There is street parking not too difficult to find within a 3 block radius, however... it is one hour parking and the machines don't necessarily work.. Despite my running out a few times, I ended up with a ticket.  Anyway on to the brunch.. so my vegetarian near vegan cousin did the honors in picking Vandal, as I stated before definitely a visually appealing place, our waitress was the sweetest too, she was very helpful with menu selections etc. We got a few things based on her recommendation including the Wild mushroom pizza which was amazing! And my Rio de Frose, omg that drink is both visually appealing and delicious.. My cousin got a manly Off the Wall which was delicious as well.  My actual brunch Entrée was forgettable, it was the egg white Florentine omelette, I can't lie I did have plate envy of my sister's lobster and asparagus omelette and my cousins steak stir fry (a little salty)... we order like 3 orders of their salt and vinegar fries because they were so good and also we were still hungry... Ok so here is the thing, when I think of brunch, you are combining breakfast and lunch, I think of being satisfied.. despite ordering the pizza for the table our individual entrees and fries.. all of us were still hungry! My one cousin actually order three entrees, two of them being the different pancakes and an omelette and he was still hungry as well.. they only give two fairly small pancakes with both their canoli (not great) and coffee (better) pancakes.  That was pretty disappointing that we all experienced the same hunger when we done, especially because we spent about $100 each.  We actually tried to order dessert but was told we would have to wait for the dinner dining to start :(  Or waitress did open the graffiti staircase for us and we got some dope family pics so that was awesome.  Would I come back, yes... for drinks and a lite bite, but definitely not for brunch.",4,1,1
137,Stephanie L.,"Brooklyn, NY",137,61,83,4.0,8/16/2018,"Another Chris Santos joint steals my heart. I came here on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday. I had a 630 reservation but arrived closer to 7pm, I did call to let the hostess know that my group was running late (thanks rain and NYC traffic) but when we arrived we were greeted with a ""You're late, what happened?"" which was super awkward and unnecessary since we were about 20-25 minutes late not like 2 hours late and had already given notice but I digress because the food and our server more than made up for our not so pleasant hostess experience.  We knew based on other reviews that we had to try the bao buns so we did and they were soooo good. OMG, I woke up thinking of those bao buns the next day. We also ordered the steak tartare which is served on a pretzel with a mustard sauce and cut into bite size pieces which makes it very easy to share. The last two apps we ordered were the braised chicken tacos and the skewers which were also good but not as memorable as the tartare and bao buns. For entrees we ordered the scallops, chicken parm, tomahawk steak and a kobe beef burger they had as a special that evening. The meal was so memorable that I cannot wait to go back.",,,

Slowly he takes the drinks orders and a few apps. He comes to me eventually and we discuss a drink with lime ginger jalapeños mint etc... and he scribbled something down they looks like elvish. Fast forward 10 mins and he's still there!!! My friends said he was on something - and I then realized he was. Another 5 mins pass and he's still hanging around trying to get the order. My wife wanted vodka on the rocks and he kept insisting it was neat. 10 mins later after eventually asking the manager to change our server, whom he claimed was the best, whatever, our drinks arrive.So here is a run down of the order:2 lagavulin (our server had never heard of it)1 grey goose on the rocks1 virgin margarita1 special organic fresh drink for meThis is what came:1 Macallan 251 grey goose neat 1 grey goose on the rocks1 virgin margarita ""Where's my drink?"" So I asked our second server that I asked for a bunch of things and she said the bar has NO jalapeño, ginger, anything spicy etc. shocking!The food order was pretty much all the veg stuff on the menu and the bao buns for me because I eat farm animals and sometimes game. Gator once. Oh and kangaroo once too. Never tried frogs.We got an extra pizza which was not ordered. Generally the food was ok, but pricey for veg though. The buns I got were good but only 2 for $15. You're better off going to a taco truck but you won't see the pretentious crowd there. Seems like all the women went to a hair dresser for a red carpet event before coming. The dessert was pretty good but then again how can you mess up fried and sugar right?Ok now for our last order of two lemon drop shots from our original guy... when he brought it out he gave it to the wrong table!!! WHAT??? It's the table you just got the order from a minute ago buddy!! Unbelievable...So high point was some good food, the extra candles I asked for (gracias amigos), and some convo about some server in an altered state - effects of the solar eclipse - which it totally cool but take the week off man.I would go back for drinks and just hang. This is NOT fine dining to me. More like a high end bar with a ton of tables for food.Ok ending now. Will edit if I think of more screw ups...",3,3,1
139,Casey R.,"Brooklyn, NY",3153,552,1607,5.0,2/5/2017,"Had an amazing time! Absolutely beyond amazing! My husband once again surprised me with a reservation, even made babysitting arrangements, GO HIM! We had a 10:45 reservation, but decided to get there early to have some drinks, parking wasn't as hard as we originally anticipated. You first walk into a ""flower shop"" then through a door to the reservation area, we were given a beeper, and headed to the bar. There is a cool bunny sculpture in the main area, the place gets a 10+++++ was atmosphere! Beautiful unique art work on every wall. We were also lucky enough to find a seat at the bar! Talk about perfect timing, we ordered the only drink that has Hennessy, which is called (off the wall) it was very good, and damn was it strong! Our bartender was so personable! And kinda looked like Tom Cruise, we stood at the bar for a while getting drunk, talking to ""Tom"" who was also nice enough to do a ""buy back"" I haven't had a bar do that in forever!!! Right on time our table was ready, and the beeper went off (basically flashing lights) by this time the bar was PACKED! I guess I didn't notice because we were sitting down the whole time. We were seating in the front room, kinda makes you feel like you're outside, the waitress was amazing! And explained all the food we were interested in. Also making her own suggestions, which luckily we listened, because we enjoyed everything! We were going to have an entree, but because of all the alcohol in our system, by then...we decided to order a bunch of appetizers. Crispy Bao Buns- MY FAV!!!! must order! I wish I would have had my own order. Grilled Chilean sea bass tacos- another fav! Very very good!!! Red snapper tostadas- good, but small, would order again. Sticky rice dumplings- spicy!!!! The favors was unbelievable, but I have a very sensitive pallet, my husband sure didn't mind, and ate them all up. After eating all that, and also have more ""off the wall"" drinks, we decided that were having so much fun, that we will celebrate my birthday, which is still weeks away, because just in case we don't have this much fun, we can always say the first time was better! Lol So we ordered dessert, the vandel s'mores, which was out of this world! You would think by this point I had no more room to eat, but I couldn't resist, they also brought out a complementary cupcake with a candle, which was all chocolate, very rich in taste! Okay now on to the other things....music! Which was great! I wanted to get up out of my seat plenty of times to dance, which some people did. Yes the music is loud, so this isn't a place for a quiet romantic dinner. But yes you're able to have a conversation. They have a lounge downstairs, there is a line, also bottle service, the music was great down there also, I believe they were playing the same as upstairs. There's plenty of seating if you get there early, but by 2am the place is packed! But great vibes! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a good night out! I can't honestly say one bad thing about our night, nature crowd, great music, service was amazing, and the best part was the food!",15,6,13

A little loud to have conversation with the whole table, but we didn't mind. We had trouble not dancing while we were eating. Would recommend for a birthday dinner. Many insta-famous photo ops.Food/Drinks: [3.5/5] We visited during restaurant week. A good selection of options on the 3 course menu. Wasn't blown out of the water by the chicken parm, the brisket bao was my fave. Cocktails were delicious and ranged from $16-$19.Service: [4/5]Very very friendly and helpful waiter! The service is slow, but people don't come here for a rushed dinner.Overall: [4/5] I will come here every time I am in NY. Think of dinner in a club-ish like setting!

The hostess wasn't friendly and wasn't really trying to figure out why it was taking so long to get us seated, until we spoke to the manager and he had us seated within a couple of minutes. The food was okay. Nothing to rave about. Drinks didn't come iced enough. The doormen to the lounge were extra rude, especially knowing we were coming from the restaurant. If you're looking for an Instagram worthy restaurant, this place will give you just that. But food, service and experience is not something that's valued here.",,,

Unfortunately a few of us were running really late. Although they had a policy of not seating you unless your entire party was here, they kindly brought us to the table with only 6 of us here, with the exception that we start ordering.Food:The food was delicious! We had ordered the NY hot pretzel steak tartare, grilled chilean sea bass tacos, margherita pizza, wild mushroom street pizza, crispy bao buns, balinese beach style branzino, and prime skirt steak. I actually enjoyed all of them except for the pretzel steak tartare. The pretzel was a bit too hard to eat.

The problem was that after dinner while I was waiting for my Uber outside, the bouncers at vandal's club just next door came to me harassing and telling me I was not aloud to stand out there waiting for a taxi or an Uber. I don't know what this people think what hospitality means and what this business is about, but for sure this is not the way you treat a costumer on top of the fact that the street is nothing they have a right on. Terrible experience.",,,
145,Jackie L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,31,59,4.0,10/24/2018,"Tao group at its finest. You walk in and you immediately know who owns the place. Basement level is a night club, ground level is a restaurant. You probably know it from the instagrams of its big purple bunny turned upside down. This is a fantastic place to bring tourists who want to feel that chic New York City vibe. Something glamorous and street at the same time. You'll want to get dressed trendier on the night you visit vandal. My suggestion is to go upstairs for dinner with a group and order a bunch -- nice thing is, they'll give you your dishes with enough for everyone to try. So if there are 12 people, they'll hook you up with 12 tacos. Just be prepared, as most clubs in NYC do, the menu is pricey. Once you're done with the dinner, head downstairs to dance all night. So much fun! Again, drinks are pricey and bottles are crazier. Bottle service is about $650 per bottle. If you're into what party goers from out of the city do in Manhattan, this is the place to be.",,,

The food was hit or miss. We ordered four small dishes between the two of us: sea bass tacos, mushroom pizza, miso eggplant, and the tortilla soup dumplings. The pizza and the dumplings were amazing, the tacos were standard and the miso eggplant sort of didn't fit. We finished with reese's pieces pops and churros. It ended up being a pretty pricey meal but not particularly filling. I would recommend coming here for a snack with drinks, but don't expect to leave with a full stomach",,,

They were so average I would never go back considering the prices.,,,
149,Tash B.,"Brooklyn, NY",176,156,62,3.0,2/12/2017,"Stopped by for Restaurant Week but opted to be a rebel and not try the pre fix menu. Despite having a reservation, my friend and I still had to wait about a half hour. Not bad considering some people have had to wait hours. If you will be in NYC for a while and can get another reservation, I would not wait more than an hour. That's just me.Service was surprisingly great. The waitress was persistent, which only annoyed me slightly since we had to wait despite having a reservation and I think 5 minutes to see the menu is not too much to ask. She did however pop up just when I needed water or to ask a question and I appreciated that. I sat in the back facing the wall while my friend got to sit in the booth along the wall. FYI, you don't want to sit where I did. I missed out on the excitement and ambiance since my view consistent of a concrete wall. OystersI loved the condiments that came with this. The oysters were a little on the small side but tasted great.Sticky Rice DumplingsGreat portion for two people. Nice subtle spicy flavor. I really enjoyed these.Shawarma SaladInteresting. Just tasted like romain with a lot of sauces. I almost forgot chicken was part of the dish since it was put in so sparingly.Blackened Shrimp ArepasThe Shrimp had a nice flavor and the cream was nicely spicy. The ""Arepas"" however tasted like little potato puffs. Not bad but not what I was expecting. Solid dish for two portion wise.Jerk SalmonThe salmon was great and the quinoa which is not my fav was also pretty tasty. Solid large plate. The Lounge:After dropping some serious $$$ I figured stopping by the lounge to see some art would be the obvious next step. Clearly Vandal and I are not on the same page. It was about 11:30pm on a Friday night and I was told that I could NOT go to a club that was in the same building as the establishment in which I just had dinner because I was not on a list.I am NOT the type of New Yorker to wait on lines or go to places with lists (that I am not automatically on). We are on the Bowery for crying out loud this is not Meatpacking. Did I mention the amount of $$$ i spent? I was told they do the whole list thing sometimes and I should come early. I don't understand how those party goers who choose to eat at the establishment first can be denied from entering another level. This section is me bitching NOT about not being considered as part of the ""cool kids"" but the fact I spent 4 hours at this place and didn't get any instagram worthy shots. Would I come back? Eh prob not on my own dime.The food was interesting and an experience but this is a place to go to say you did. Oh and they may want to make sure the mouse traps with fresh cheese cannot be seen, especially for what they are charging. I probably would have forgotten about that sighting if I got to have the complete vandal experience.",3,2,
150,Cyn F.,"Bayside, Queens, NY",53,204,162,1.0,1/23/2017,"I just really did not like this restaurant. I did not like the food at all. I asked for Medium cooked skirt steak and it was basically raw. The rice that came with it was pretty spicy as well. And the random egg on top was not necessary. The appetizers were OK. We tried the mushroom appetizer and the zucchini appetizer. Nothing to rave about.The dessert was actually really good however. We tried the black and white cake($15), the Jameson shots($8), and they also brought out a FREE cupcake because we were celebrating a birthday. All in all though, the drinks are overpriced. The entire place is overpriced. We went downstairs to their downstairs lounge. It's very crowded and gets pretty hot down there. The ceilings are really low. I'm pretty sure it's the basement and they turned it into a fancy bar area with bottle service tables as well. Getting a drink at the bar is an almost impossible task. We ordered a drink and with only 2 bartenders, it took about 15 minutes to get it. We didn't stay long.A cocktail/glass of wine, whether upstairs or downstairs, starts at $16+tax.Only good thing about this place is the ambience and the hostesses/waitress/bartenders. They were all really sweet.I will definitely not be back nor would I recommend this place to anyone. For the price we paid I would have rather have went to a steakhouse!",6,2,1
151,Petrina R.,"Brooklyn, NY",116,146,714,3.0,1/25/2017,"decor, decor, decor! that is what sells the place. I honestly believe that it has abstolutely nothing to do with the food, drinks or the music. Every turn you make there is beautiful art to take you in. I almost forgot what I was there for. Drum roll please......the food was not that spectacular. I was there for my girlfriends birthday dinner and there were only 8 of us. The server arrived 10 mins afer being seated and took another 10 mins to take our orders. The appetizers were wonderful, even better than the main course. The drinks were nothing to write home about.My dinner looked like the walls - artistic and tasted like paste. If you're going to go to Vandal stay at the bar for drinks. Keep your money in your pocket, it's not worth it and all the guest at the birthday party agreed too.",4,1,4

Came here after visiting two other locations to celebrate a friend's birthday. For starters, getting in too late was a hassle. There is a bouncer at the door that really tries to keep it regulated and its hard if a large portion of your group is inside and you still can't get that one guy in. Why? Because it's a guy. The drink options at the bar just wasn't the best as well so we ended up taking a lot of shots to make up for it. The music, the crowd, everything just wasn't for us although we tried to make a good time. Everything else about the venue was gorgeous. We loved the way you secretly walk through a flower shop to get in. The bartenders were so pleasant to deal with, but it just wasn't enough.",,,
153,Cassie J.,"Richmond, Australia",462,59,88,3.0,2/3/2017,"A review in one word: SCENE-Y. If you're the type of person likes to SEE and BE SEEN and be surrounded by trendy downtowners and baby executives while waiting at the tiny bar for an ever-sought-after table in the dining room this place is the right spot for you. I made a reservation here for 4 people at 7:45. Once we all arrived at 7:45, we notified the hostess who then gave us a buzzer and assured us that ""people are finishing up and it shouldn't be too long"". Context clues told us that ""too long"" would actually be more like 20 minutes so we went to the bar to have a pre-dinner cocktail. The drinks were VERY good and the bartenders were very very nice. Steep prices ($17 a piece), but I recommend the Castor Troy (VODKA, SPICY) or the Las Palmitas (TEQUILA, ALSO SPICY). Once 50 minutes past, we went back to check and the hostess was EXTREMELY RUDE. Management interjected and offered to buy our table a glass of champagne each - which was so greatly appreciated. NOW ON TO THE FOOD - we had the restaurant week menu and one item from the regular menu. The standouts were: Steak tartar pretzel (MUST GET THIS SERIOUSLY SO GOOD), Skirt steak (also an amazing choice), Mushroom salad (tastes like truffle so #duh), espresso + Jameson shot (dessert - so good). Why 3 stars? The service was pretty terrible and the food was good, but not great for the prices and what you get. GOOD FOR: Ladies night, balling out for a client or prospective client",2,1,1

My friend made reservations about a week in advance. The restaurant is huge, but it is PACKED. The decor was super ""hip,"" and they played such good music. The music was at a good level. We were able to dance, eat, and talk!To start the night off I had the ""off the wall"" drink, which was so so good. Now the cocktails are a little pricy, but it was so good I got 3! For food we started with Brussel sprouts and oysters. I loved loved loved the brussel sprouts. All the items are shareable, so we shared them amongst the girls.Then we had the sea bass tacos, bao buns, jerk salmon, and the chicken and waffles (can't remember the name of the waffles, but so good). For desert, we had the Greek donuts, some smores thing, and the cupcake. I honestly enjoyed all the deserts. After dinner, we went down to the ""club.""

Updated review","So where do I begin? No longer is this place the ""new"" hot spot still it is very popular a little too much if u ask me simply because it makes for very long wait times even with a reservation. Recently stopped by we had a RSVP for 945 due to crazy traffic we were 20 minutes late I did call to inform them which didn't make jack of a difference since once we arrived by the time we sat down it was an hour later ughhh so not cool. Drinks at the bar while we waited tried the Up all night very good this is stoli with Red Bull orange some raspberry with lemon tasty drink also had the Double Dutch great drink could be a little less sweet add some of that Red Bull & it's even better. Bar area is very crowded not comfortable to have everyone on top of each other people have no concept of the word ""sorry"" or even a simple ""excuse me"" so annoying. They sat us in the front area which wouldn't have been so bad expect it was too hot took them some time to crank up the AC.Food we tried the Crispy Bao buns great tasting brisket is very good. The Crab Cake corn dogs yumm this was delicious good sauce. Next the Chicken & waffle Mac & cheese very good Mac it had a bit of spicy to it. & finally the Chipotle shrimp arepas great tasting grilled shrimp taste good tomatillo & roasted corn combo w the arepa. This is one of those places that u come more for the ambiance than the food & drinks since it is & can get pretty pricey.I do like the place don't like the long wait times now & quick service to drop all the food on you even though we asked that they didn't do that not a fan of the food being rushed out & then super slow at collecting the check.Fun vibe, cool art & very good music playing so far I haven't had anything I didn't like so I will continue to visit from time to time.",7,5,7
161,Frank W.,"New York, NY",217,104,69,3.0,3/9/2017,"Fantastic scene and very cool vibe! They've taken a page from a book of another similarly trendy LES spot, Beauty & Essex, in that they have the decor and atmosphere to attract the who's who clientele and then proceed to make it extremely hard to capture a reservation. Despite securing a reservation more than 3 weeks in advance and arriving precisely on time we were still directed to get drinks at the bar and ended up waiting another 45 minutes before getting seated. The set-up of the restaurant is fairly sprawling with multiple rooms and interesting artwork/graffiti displayed throughout. So Vandal would warrant top marks from an atmosphere perspective but the food is a different story...We all ordered cocktails at the bar - fairly delicious. My sergeant bell pepper was spicy but still excellent; whereas the ladies' cocktails seemed to taste slightly too sweet and didn't pack a punch the way others would be. Following the painfully long wait to get seated, we then had to wait longer than would traditionally be expected to (i) place a food order and (ii) actually get any food. Unlike it's neighborhood brethren, B&E, the food at Vandal was very underwhelming. Every dish we ordered sounded extremely delicious but then as they arrived they all seemed to be quite mediocre. Pork belly buns - mehhOctopus - no flavorbrussel sprouts - very averagesticky rice dumplings - not greatthe only redeeming order was the skirt steak over fried rice - that one was actually very delicious with the egg and veggies. Overall the food couldn't have been more mehh which is why Vandal gets 3 stars.",,1,
162,Sach S.,"New York, NY",3,36,0,5.0,4/30/2018,"This review is for the restaurant.I made a reservation for my wife and I to have dinner here on a Friday night. When we arrived, we were seated immediately and had the best waiter. It makes such a difference when the  service is good and we did not expect this at all. We had the yellow tail jalapeno which was not my favorite but my wife really enjoyed it. We usually get the yellowtail jalapeno app. at every restaurant that has this dish (tao, catch, nobu, etc.). For the main course we decided to share the pan seared scallops and the 35 day aged steak which were both good. The cocktails were good as well.The ambiance is different, a lot of art work, decent music, and the place was packed, but overall, no complaints. We had a good time. Bill was around $150.Must try!",,,

165,Maya E.,"Manhattan, NY",287,80,60,3.0,3/14/2018,"Came here with a friend of mine. We were pretty hungry when we came and ordered a few things to share: the Lobster Mac & cheese (can't find the price for this one), the cauliflower tacos ($14), and the sea bass tacos ($24). The lobster Mac & cheese was pretty good and the portion was decent. However, both taco orders had very small portions and were not filling at all to me. They each came with 3 tiny tacos that were almost bite sized. To be fair, the dishes are advertised as tapas but for the price and average taste, it wasn't really worth it. I will say that the ambiance of the restaurant is nice. The food is average and not really worth the price.",,,

The food was pretty decent and the decor/vibe was great. I went back again for a brunch and it was a huge disappointment. Food wasn't great, service was so slow, and it wasn't busy at all for a brunch on a weekend. Everything came out so slowly that the brunch turned out to be a 2.5 hour affair.",,,

We got there a little early for our reservation , so we hung out by the bar. The atmosphere was really alive! They had a little photo area, where you take a live video, and send it to your email! We sat at our table, and the service was amazing!! Our waitress, was great, the bussing crew, was always, replenishing our water glasses, changing our plates! The food quality, was most definitely a 5 star! The service was a 5 star! We ordered, oysters, tuna/salmon poke, shishito peppers, vegetable lo mein, margarita pizza, mushroom pizza, seared tuna. Then we had 2 desserts. We had the s'mores, and chocolate crepe. Both came with a scoop of ice cream!! I would most definitely return here!!So we returned here last night, like I said we would! Our waitress was Ashley! She was on the money! We went with her recommendation of the oysters and the cauliflower tacos! They were awesome! We ordered the margarita pizza again, and the tuna/salmon poke. We tried the red snapper tostadas! It was delic! She gave us Jameson milkshake shots! Wow. They were good! This can easily be a regular spot for us! The atmosphere is really alive! Love it.",3,1,

171,Alexa S.,"New York, NY",738,187,194,4.0,2/5/2017,"Finally tried Vandal last Sunday night with a friend for NYC Restaurant Week. I've been wanting to try it out since it opened about a year ago. Passed the restaurant a bunch of times and of course it has a cool/trendy vibe like its sister restaurants. When you first walk in it's a flower shop (pretty cool stuff, but pricey! wonder if anyone ever buys anything there?) and then the main entrance to the restaurant is through the shop. The decor is beautiful & each room is quite different. My friend and I were seated in the front room, which kind of has an outdoorsy/garage type vibe. I believe when it's warm out the doors/windows open up, which would be really nice! We took a walk around the restaurant after our meal and the back rooms seemed to have a more lively vibe (a little loud), but that's ok we enjoyed sitting in the front as it wasn't loud and we could actually have a conversation. Unfortunately the downstairs lounge was closed, but would love to check it out on a weekend night for drinks. The food & drinks were great! We ordered the Double Dutch & Las Palmitas cocktails and both enjoyed them! The restaurant week menu seemed to have g options. We also ordered a few things off of the regular menu to supplement (which wasn't really necessary, but of course we ordered anyway). Would definitely recommend trying out Vandal! Appetizers: -Nori Spiced Tuna Roll: I honestly didn't love this at all and it wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting a sushi type roll, but it had a crispy fried outside with raw tuna inside. I told them to hold the wasabi crema. Overall it was OK, but not what I was expecting or what I wanted.-Crunchy Jicama Shell Tostadas: My friend had these and seemed to really enjoy! I didn't try it, but it seemed that the shells were a bit too thin to hold the ingredients in the tostada -Heaven Spot Mini Burger: (Not on Restaurant Week Menu) We ordered 1 burger to share and it was just OK. I expected a lot better from all of the reviews on yelp & photos of the burger. We could've done without it.Main Dish: -Prime Skirt Steak: My friend & I both had this as our main and it was excellent! The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare. The fried sausage rice was awesome and a lot more filling than I expected. The egg on top was perfectly and tied the whole dish together. Really enjoyed it! Sides: -Crispy Eggplant: (Not on Restaurant Week Menu) AMAZING! Absolutely loved this and so glad we ordered. It was crispy small pieces of eggplant and soft inside. So delicious. Dessert: -Almond Joy Pops: I had these are they were really good! They fell apart quickly after just taking one bite, but they were very delicious! -Churros w/ Spicy Chocolate: My friend had these as her dessert & really liked them! I'm really not a churro person, but I did try and they were delicious. Not as doughy as other churros I've tried, which I actually prefer it to be crispy.",1,,
172,Tiffany M.,"Flushing, NY",128,283,2522,4.0,3/8/2017,"Finally found the time to check out Vandal during Restaurant Week! I was a little confused at first because we had to walk through Ovando Flower Shop to get to Vandal. But once inside, it felt like we stepped into Alice's Wonderland with the upside down rabbit and loud black and white decor. To the left was the bar and booth seating. We followed the hostess through the bar and through another themed room. I was taken by surprise at how large and spacious the restaurant was. The decor is pretty sweet! There's even a downstairs area but it was closed off at the time we went. I was so happy we got a huge booth corner table for my group of 3! We settled in and ordered from the the Restaurant Week Menu, which had a good global mix of the items they served.  Out of everything we ordered, I recommend the Spicy Korean Rice Cake, Nori Spiced Tuna Roll, Fried Rice and Churros. I wasn't a big fan of the Crunchy Jicama Shell Tostadas or the Branzino but the food was overall good. For drinks I enjoyed the Las Palmitas, which is a spicy drink mixed with grapefruit beer & bitters.  The service is pretty quick. As soon as we finished eating, they were wiping the tables down and cleaning up the plates for us. Our glasses were always full of water. I would like to come back for the drinks and to try the other items on the menu.",,,

174,Emily R.,"Brooklyn, NY",167,92,339,4.0,12/16/2016,"Ok let's be really honest. This is NOT  the place you go to if your really hungry. You come to Vandal for the artistic decor and ambience. You have Tapas that are tasty with drinks. My recommendations: bao buns, mini burgers, cacio e Pepe arancini, the krispy eggplant. Skip the jerk chicken tostones. They aren't tostones they are pretty much small plantain chip with meat on them...not worth it. Wish we tried something else. The dessert, the bread pudding was delish, I'd skip the smores. The ice cream that came with smores pie was delish. The lounge was fun, the music was really good. There are bouncers. We went to dinner about 6 and went down to the lounge about 8. When I was leaving it was def packed and way more ppl waiting to go downstairs. Music upstairs is the music from the Dj downstairs. Had a great time.",3,2,4
175,Christopher S.,"New York, NY",13,127,72,5.0,3/4/2017,"I, as well as my guests, thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant - both the food and service was excellent. For one, the restaurant is very cool, decorated nicely with lots of people. Our waiter knew the menu very well and was able to recommend dishes to us and explain each of them in detail. We ate a LOT.As for the light dishes, we had the jicama tostadas and tuna roll. I was not overly impressed by each of these dishes and the portions are quite small for what you are paying. As for the street food, we had the cacio e pepe arancini, potato gnocchi, crispy bao buns and wild mushroom street pizza. Each of them were absolutely amazing. Crispy bao buns and mushroom pizza is a MUST. As for the large plates, we had the cauliflower katsu - again, highly recommend especially for the vegetarians. Lastly, as for the extras, we ordered the crispy eggplant (must) and brussel sprouts which were also very good! We had no room for dessert although our waiter, who did an excellent job all night, brought us a complimentary smores. Amazing.I highly recommend.",,,
176,Latrice H.,"Los Angeles, CA",55,353,386,3.0,9/1/2017,"This is a typical NY place. Good ambiance but very basic. The service is mediocre and though the food is good, it is highly overpriced. I had the fish tacos, which were really good but since it's tapas style, you aren't really satisfied. You're honestly paying for the scenery and that's all. The drinks are also priced pretty aggressively. I wouldn't go back to this place but it was cool having the initial experience.",,,
177,Panna F.,"Borough Park, Brooklyn, NY",49,13,8,4.0,3/14/2018,The atmosphere is beautiful! I ordered a frozé and the sea bass tacos to start. I'm huge on steak tacos so this was something new for me. I was expecting some sort of dried fried fish with lettuce inside but seeing how everyone constantly wrote good reviews about them wanted to give it a shot. When I tell you that was the juiciest grilled bass I have ever had in my life with the most delicious chipotle lime cabbage oh my! I ordered the scallops and my boyfriend ordered the chicken parm. The scallops were OK but the orzo / rice (don't remember what is was) with butternut squash and peas were DELICIOUS.  Whatever sauce it was in was perfect. It was a very light dish but filled me up without feeling like I over ate. I felt like the chicken parm was pretty empty to be served by itself but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. Overall really good but I feel like it's more of a one time experience.,,,
178,Akilah H.,"Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, NY",164,6,2,1.0,12/12/2017,"if you're young & BLACK - this isn't the place for you. The service was horrible. We were treated as if we weren't wanted there. Why would a server feel the need to tell us they don't serve something ?! And then when we see it being served to another table we are told ""well it costs $60!"" WTF asked you how much it costs ?! We then requested a new waiter. She was just as bad. Extremely rude - she clearly didn't like her job and we could tell she did not want to wait our table. it took a talk with the manager and 3 waiters to get it together. NEVER AGAIN. our food came out at different times. 3 ppl of our party had already finished eating before they remainder of us even got our food. the food was decent, and the place is beautiful... hence the 1 star.",5,1,

All was going well until we wanted to continue to party downstairs. How ridiculous is it that they wanted us  to pick up our coats and recheck it if we went back downstairs. When we tried to go downstairs they said they don't accept walk ins. Just bottle service. $1,500 min.  Insane!!  You can go get some other suckers to pay that. Be warned. Don't waste your time.",4,,

On the other hand, be prepared to speak loud there. The noise of the people and music is well above the average restautent. Again, not a bad thing as it goes well with their character. The service was very good and the workers were prompt and very pleasant to work with. The food quality was OK but not a wow. I think they can take it up a notch or two.",1,,
182,Khovita J.,"Queens, Queens, NY",2,3,9,2.0,2/4/2018,"I had such high expectations for this place.. I've seen pictures online and heard about the wonderful ambiance/art decor. So it only seemed fitting that my boyfriend and I came to try it for the beloved restaurant week. I had the sticky rice balls (appetizer), the old school chicken Parmesan (main) and churros (dessert); my boyfriend had the salmon/poke bowl (appetizer), grilled steak (main) and the Jameson milkshake shot (dessert). The food was a little below average and overall seemed to need more seasoning. The cocktails are in the 17$ range and are served in pretty small glasses. The best thing I ate here were the churros which were pretty good. In a nutshell, the portion are small, overpriced, and leave you desiring something more.. despite the talked about art decor/ambiance, it's not somewhere I would be visiting again Ps. The steak tartare pretzel is much smaller than in the pictures and can probably be replicated better at home",1,,

Always a good sign when a place is that crowded.I was excited because I love this downtown area so much. I absolutely died and went to heaven with the nomikai canned fizzy rosé!!! My friends had a Taxi Line (tequila with lime and rosemary) and an Off The Wall (hennessy with blueberry).  The bartender was awesome ;) Vandal is classy, fun, and staffed with incredible people. If you haven't been there yet, go soon! And it does get crowded so go early!I also have to say that it is a bit pricey but I'll be back soon to enjoy those great cocktails.",1,,
187,Latef X.,"New York, NY",36,551,620,3.0,2/25/2018,"We just came here for drinks and dessert. Their cocktails are wayyyyyyy sweet and not really refined, but they charge $17 per for them. Definitely not speakeasy quality.We got the sorbets and none of the flavors were that great, but they are okay. Again, all were super sweet in my opinion. It was kind of weird because each one had a significantly different texture than the next. This leads me to think have some consistency issues in the kitchen.The crowd here is pretty unattractive yet interesting for people watching. We came here dressed in yoga clothes, but people get DECKED OUT to come here as if they're in Vegas or something.Music is all over the place -- started with bad wedding music and turned to bumping pop club music by the time we left in an hour. Ambiance is hip/artsy style and the service is actually awesome -- everyone is suuuuuper nice and almost over attentive. You never have to wait long for anything and the workers are attractive young people. Not our vibe, but I can see why certain people like this place.",,,

They fish was so fresh and tasty and this tacos just something else..For main course we got Flash seared tuna ( I would be back there only to get this tuna again!), pan roasted salmon and pan seared black bass.

191,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,4.0,12/11/2017,"I've been to Vandal a couple times, and despite the vibes you might get when you first step in - you'll probably either love the place or think it is way too hipster / trendy for your tastes - I would keep an open mind. The bar upstairs is a bit on the crowded side, but there is a surprising amount of seating in the upstairs restaurant area - the front has a decent amount of space (as well as higher ceilings - helps to mitigate the noise), as well as a dining area in the back that is closer quarters and can be pretty loud. With lots of artwork adorning the walls, it's easy to simply get lost admiring (or trying to understand) the decorative sensibilities, but it has always been an interesting spot to sit down for a meal. Service on balance tends to be quite good (they will come around for drinks frequently, although when they tried to jam a large party I was a part of at a small round table - and deconstructing our original table in the process - that was one of the more puzzling misreads of a situation I have seen anywhere.The food is probably best described as more adventurous contemporary American, but it is very good in its own right, with the entrees being more of the standout. The squash tostadas were a seasonally-oriented vegetarian take on a Mexican dish, with the crunchy jicama shell providing more of a spring-like freshness to the bite. I would say I enjoyed the steak tartare served on a pretzel more; given that the beef was more muted in flavor, it melded in with the pretzel quite well, with the latter providing a dash of saltiness. I will say that I really enjoyed the crispy bao bunds a lot more, though, with it being one of my favorite bites of the evening. With juicy slabs of brisket crisped on the outside, combined with the slightly crunchy bao bun itself (it's not the typically soft bun), it's a delicious, slightly crackling take on an Asian favorite. Next up was a margherita pizza, which was probably the most banal bite of the meal - I could find more interesting pizzas virtually anywhere else...not much to say about that one. The entrees, though, were fantastic. The lobster mac and cheese was definitely on the thicker / heartier side of the spectrum, but there were generous lumps of lobster meat in each bite, and the heavier version of this - meant to imitate lobster bisque drenched over macaroni pasta - was excellent. The pan-roasted salmon was even better, though, with a citrus glaze giving it a bit of sweetness, while it was also topped off with some spices as well. It was cooked a bit more than I generally prefer, but the flavor profile was excellent. Nothing can touch how good the steak is, though. Served atop a fried egg on a bunch of fried rice, the cut of steak is juicy and succulent and worthy really of being on its own (the fried rice was unremarkable filler, IMO). We finished off with some creative desserts. I liked the pretzel-shaped churros better given how generously they were sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar, but the Reese's Pieces pops were spot-on impressions of the popular candy (albeit too peanut buttery for usual consumption).As for the drinks side - the cocktails here are delicious, although I did have one Taxi Line that was a bit too bitter. The Icy Grape is dangerously good, given how much it tastes like you are barely boozy grape juice. And the drinking areas? The lounge downstairs is really nice and cozy, although they should really close the upstairs door to prevent cold air from seeping into the lounge at the far end. The dance floor can end up being a lot of fun, and every time I have been there, the DJs are always spinning some solid beats. That said, when it fills up, the service behind the bar can lag a little given that they inexplicably only have 1 or 2 folks working it even though it can get pretty packed.In all - love the vibe and the ambiance, even though I am not the artsy / hipster type, and the food and drinks are quite good, even if the food sometimes errs on the too experimental side. You might lose your voice given how loud it is everywhere - both upstairs and downstairs - but it's a lot of fun no matter what.",2,,

We ordered 2 Margherita pizza, sweet potato fries and 3 drinks; Lost and Found, Double dutch and The Intervention. I am a henny girl so I picked the lost and found and it was okay. Although, I would of preferred this place to have sweet wine, their weren't any. The waiter was nice, the girls in the front eh! They could be much friendlier and not uptight. The genre of music will change, making us hype then go back to what is this, but diversity of songs, I guess is always good. hahaha Otherwise, I had a good time with my co-workers.",,,

From the atmosphere to the cocktails to the cuisine, Vandal is the quintessential trendy downtown Manhattan experience. The speakeasy entrance leads to an inviting hosting staff with a colorful, expansive restaurant just beyond. Artwork covers the large walls and funky seating is arranged throughout. Frose (or is it Froze?)...such a delicious, addictive cocktail! Food favorites were the mushroom pizza, tortilla soup dumplings, and lobster sopes. But the real star was the dessert. We tried an assortment but faves were the Irish Coffee Milkshake Shot and S'mores. Afterward we checked out the gorgeous lounge downstairs for a nightcap. The staff was excellent and I'll be back next time friends are in town.",,,

And on an added note, I got a ton of really neat snap chats in and a good insta so that's a major win. The concept of the restaurant is that it is based on the best street food from around the world. The restaurant itself is huge, and has a lot of rooms that each have different vibes based on the type of art work in the room. We were with a large party of 10, and actually asked to switch rooms (betchy) so that we could be in a more fun atmosphere, and they were very accommodating.Starting off with the drinks, I stuck to cocktails for the night. I had the pushcart wars (a spicy tequila drink so you know that is just speaking to my heart) as well as the off the wall. Both of them were great, and they had a ton of others that sounded fantastic.Since we were at a large group work dinner we had the privilege of ordering a ton of stuff to share which was the following. Cacio e pepe arancini (very good)Knish reuben  (meh not my favorite, but other people really liked it)New york pretzel steak tartare (a huge hit)Red snapper tostadasBlackened shrimp tostadasHeaven spot mini burger (omg this was so good - i don't know how they did it but it was really remarkable)Crispy bao buns (really tasty)EggplantBrussel sproutsSmores (so good)ChurrosCaramel apple bread puddingFavorites were definitely the pretzel, the mini burger, and the bao buns. There was one thing that I didn't like (i forget what it was unfortunately but it tasted really licorice-y) but other than that I really enjoyed everything and the huge assortment of flavors and options. We also checked out the downstairs afterwards for drinks and it was a fun lounge feel as well.",3,,2

I was intrigued by the establishments unique layout. My chicken and waffles came and it just tasted below normal. I guess I expected it to be out of this world based on some of the reviews I've read. Service was friendly enough. Doubt I'll be back",7,2,2

199,Caroline J.,"Canarsie, Brooklyn, NY",3,14,5,4.0,2/18/2018,"Amazing service, amazing food and drinks .. Beautiful art wall . But the reason for 4 stars is due to the noise and the price for drinks ($18 for a drink) so have money lol . It can get really loud in there. Also DJ Plays good music.",,,
