0,Kent M.,"Edmonton, Canada",45,142,20,5.0,8/20/2018,"The Guthrie Inn made some excellent cocktails and had a breezy fun vibe that made this traveler feel right at home. Although it doesn't offer food, the Guthrie made one of the best cocktails I've had in some time. The Berry Bourbon was boozy and delicious, and I consequently enjoyed far more than I planned to on my last visit.The room is small and cozy, and the bartenders were friendly. The music varied pretty wildly between my two visits; the first evening it was a solid hip-hop playlist (I may have stealthed a couple of Shazam IDs that night). The next time was an early 00s playlist; at one point the whole bar belted out Avril Lavigne's ""Complicated"" together. It was a bonding moment.I'd certainly visit the Guthrie the next time I'm in the neighbourhood!",,,1
1,Matt L.,"New York, NY",362,15,51,4.0,10/6/2018,Great dive bar to go to after work or to catch up with friends. The drinks are pretty average in price and selection ($6-7 for a beer) and you can get a discount as an employee or student of Mount Sinai! Many folks from Sinai frequent this bar and it's friendly neighbor Earl's Beer and Cheese right next door. Guthrie Inn also has retro games and a shuffle board in the back room.,,,
2,Chris P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",378,97,45,3.0,3/16/2018,"A little unclear what kind of vibe this place is going for or what they want to ""be known for"" -- not that every place should strive for that -- but it's strange how unmemorable this place is. Putting negative connotations aside, I mean that in neither a good or bad way. When it's empty you might have a shot at getting the shuffleboard at the back, which is fun.When I asked the bartender what stouts or dark beers they had, she responded with ""We have Guinness and a new IPA"" ...It's an okay place to drop in for a drink at night if you don't want to go farther away from this area.",,,
3,Inga S.,"Manhattan, NY",19,10,0,3.0,4/28/2018,"Great cocktails and a good atmosphere. The service has been a bit hit or miss for me each time I've been, which is why I give it 3 stars. The core menu of cocktails is delicious, and if you go when it's warm they open the window out front which is really nice. Good for small groups (in the back) or a date. I wouldn't go here solo, as the vibe isn't as much of a meet & chat one as it is at Earls next door.",,,
4,Michael M.,"New York, NY",204,454,936,4.0,11/26/2017,"A solid bar on the upper east side. Near Mount Sinai Hospital so tend sot be dominated by the post work hospital crowd. No food, but a nice vibe, good drinks, and a reasonable happy hour.",2,1,1
5,Eden C.,"Washington, DC",3,6,0,2.0,8/12/2017,"The place used to be a great place for a good, late night drink. The bartenders were friendly and made good drinks. Now, this place has gone downhill due to new hires. The head female bartender (I believe someone called her Paige) stands behind the bar and, on numerous occasions, has made snide comments about requests, preferences and barely knew how to make an Old Fashion. As a bartender myself, I get how guests can be frustrating, but that is no way a bartender should act. I've never rolled my eyes at a customer or made comments to customers about other ones in front of their faces to be rude. That is exactly how you lose regulars. All in all, great cocktail menu and atmosphere, just change the attitude.",3,,1
6,Paula C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,1,5.0,7/31/2017,"That cocktail  ""the usual"" is the nicest thing I have ever tasted in drunk format. It is sublimity in itself. It fulfilled all my dreams, and my desires. Go to this place, and live the life you always wished.",1,,
7,Carmen W.,"New York, NY",126,220,179,3.0,11/8/2016,"Went here on a Saturday night and it was pretty much empty.The bar tender was pretty cool though - looked like Chris Pratt's brother! Drinks were not very good and seemed a bit watered down.Crowd seemed to consist of people from all over. Not ""Inn""to this bar.",5,2,2
8,Ashley S.,"Manhattan, NY",286,457,898,4.0,10/13/2016,"They make a mean cocktail here! I came with some friends for happy hour, and we had some great drinks. They have $4 draft beers (only two options but Laguanitas IPA was one which is a pretty decent beer), $5 house wines, and $8 well drinks. I opted for a cocktail because I know that's their specialty. Their well drinks are still hand-crafted. They don't have premade sour mix, so the bartender made me a whisky sour with fresh-squeezed lemon and sugar and topped it off with a lemon rind. It was so good, so I had another. They also have free chips you can get with your drinks - literally fun size bags of chips that are hanging on the wall behind the bar. We grabbed some Cheetos and Fritos and were pretty happy. I will definitely be back.",4,1,3
9,Aaron T.,"New York, NY",47,4,1,5.0,10/23/2017,"Do you want a nice neighborhood bar? A nice spot for a date? Somewhere to bring a close friend or family member for a conversation? Guthrie's has it all. Sit at the bar and chat with the bartenders and the regulars; enjoy the breeze by the window booth or privacy in the back booth. Are you a fan of music? The selection ranges from dance-pop to nostalgic rock to dusty hip-hop. Depending on the mood and patrons, I've heard everything from emo to ambient. Obviously, I have to comment on the drinks: As some other reviews have mentioned--yes, sometimes Guthrie's might be missing an ingredient for your favorite cocktail. Now, you can ask the bartender for something else, or write a pissy review about not being able to get precisely what you wanted. In my experience, going with the former has always led to a super-fun night and delicious drinks. But as for the most important thing: It's the bartenders. Each one is amazing and brings their unique energy to the bar. Whether it's the architecture, the music, the drinks, or the bartenders, what I personally love about the Guthrie is all the various permutations of experiences I've had there--ranging from a run-of-the-mill night out, to learning about something entirely new, to meeting some of the most wonderful people in New York City.",2,,
10,Dew P.,"New York, NY",196,572,76,5.0,12/29/2017,Very cool low key spot.... friendly crowd and they have a shuffle/bocchi board in the back.. The house cocktails are good... I definitely want to try their old fashion...,,,
11,Tony R.,"Henderson, NV",18,5,3,4.0,11/18/2017,"Guthrie Inn is a perfect complement to Earl's Beer and cheese next door. Have a few good beers (and the beer cheese and thick-cut bacon) at the communal table next door, then repair to the Guthrie for cocktails (they have a chandelier and a banquette).",,,
12,Peter K.,"Manhattan, NY",458,655,80,4.0,1/26/2017,I like it. Chill atmosphere. Intimate neighborhood bar. I feel like this is the kind of place where it's just small enough that you could be recognized as a regular. The prices are on par with other bars in UES. $7 a pint on average. Selection is decent and changes month to month. They'll make any cocktail you want. Close to my work place. The locals all chat with each other. It's like my very own dimly lit hipster Cheers.,1,2,
13,Christine A.,"Hoboken, NJ",85,255,116,3.0,4/27/2016,"I came here for a couple drinks with friends a few weeks ago and was excited to see there was a cocktail bar in the upper east. There is a tiny bar up in the front room and saloon-style seating (think wooden chairs, barrels, etc) and tables in the back. I was pleasantly surprised to see drinks were in the $10 range. Score!  But found that the drinks were just okay; there was nothing really special about them.  I wouldn't venture up here just for this bar, but might be something to peruse if you're in the area.",,,1
14,Andrew S.,"Nashville, TN",0,4,0,1.0,11/12/2017,"The cocktail was really good. We got the donkey juice. But our bar tender was trashed and pretty sure we interrupted a drug deal between him and the two other guys who were the only ones in the bar. Looked like a cool place, but the staff was weird and not sober at all. Bailed without finishing our drinks. Bad time.",2,,
15,Samantha K.,"Rockville Centre, NY",0,6,6,3.0,8/27/2017,"We were in the area and saw it on countless lists as one of the better bars on the UES. Ordered a Manhattan and a drink from the menu, bartender said they were lacking an ingredient for each cocktail and substituted. The drinks were still decent but not worth going out of our way for. The space was nice and the music was awesome. Would try it again for a beer if we were in the area.",,,
16,Valeriya S.,"Manhattan, NY",4,2,0,5.0,9/20/2017,"Lovely local best kept secret spot. Great cocktails, not too crowded, good for conversation. Fun music and great staff!",,,
17,Anne S.,"San Francisco, CA",143,237,26,4.0,12/31/2016,This place is a cocktail bar and mixology place. The drinks are creative and wonderful. The ambiance is relaxed and low stress with still a prohibition Era vibe. The staff are fantastic and give a generous pour. This is a great place for a chill night out where you really want to catch up with an old friend and have a great couple of drinks. It doesn't have delicious food and wine like abv. It doesn't have the comfort factor of savory beer cheese and microbrewery beers. But that's not what it's meant to be. It terrific for what it is.,,,
18,Regina O.,"Monroe, CT",0,3,0,5.0,8/12/2017,New to the neighborhood and this place is my favorite find by far. Awesome bartenders and awesome music. There was a female duo behind the bar that kept me laughing and drinking all night.  Can't find a better neighborhood watering hole! My new Friday go to.,,,
19,Gipsita N.,"New York, NY",50,60,99,4.0,9/23/2016,Loved their Bourbon Berry! Lovely drinks cool staff. Nice little bar next to my place. Cool spot to hang out for some nice drinks after work. Open late another plus.,1,,
20,Molly T.,"New York, NY",860,443,1415,4.0,5/8/2015,"Want a good example for ""quiet greatness""? Look no further than the Guthrie Inn. There's nothing fancy about this speakeasy-esque spot. There's very little in terms of decoration, dim lighting, only one bartender, and a menu that doesn't exactly scream ""high end cocktail bar"". But don't let all of that deceive you - this place is, wait for it, QUIETLY GREAT!Came here on a Thursday night to find it quite empty. I went with a fellow cocktail nut, so when he recommended the Guthrie, I figured his word was good. We quickly got two seats at the bar and started quite the journey of a night.We're both the type of person who loves to schmooze with bartenders. Not in a weird/stalky/creepy way, just out of general interest/curiosity. This guy, Francisco, was awesome. We talked all things Manhattan drinking culture. And eventually, after studying the menu for a few minutes, I participated in said culture. And though the menu doesn't stand out as being exceptional, the drinks were still close to top of the line.I can't remember the name of the first drink I ordered, but if I'm remembering correctly, it had bourbon, amaretto, sweet vermouth and brown sugar in it. Thick and syrupy sweet. If the combo souds generally appealing to you but you're not into sugar rushes, our new friend Francisco recommends passing on the sweet vermouth, or just adding a little splash. BUT the star of the evening was the Sharpie Mustache. I remember the name because.....how could you forget a name like that? I was wary of ordering it because the base seemed so outlandish to me - gin and rye. I mean, I'm not saying I'm an expert mixologist or anything, but I would never think to combine those liquors in a cocktail. At least not if I'm intending on drinking it....But our pal Francisco assured me that this drink was THE drink to get. He told us that he drank so many of them when he first started working at the Guthrie that he's sick of them at this point. I don't know how you could possibly get sick of this drink, but then again, I'm not a bartender. As the name suggests, this is SHARP. Like, eye-poppingly sharp. Like, I think my eyes actually did one of those cartoon-bulge type things. Okay, I wouldn't be a good Yelper if I withheld one of the negatives. At one point, our new friend left. I'm not exactly sure where he went. And by our new friend, I mean the bartender. As in, the only person working there. So...be glad I'm not a klepto?Lastly: We ended up befriending another lovely individual that night, who was none other than Francisco's girlfriend. You know when you have one of those nights that seems like one of those classic New York experiences? Thursday night was just that. Sometimes I forget that New Yorkers are not just balls of animosity that don't give a damn about anyone else but themselves - it's easy to get jaded here. The purpose of that little musing is to say that we befriended an awesome couple, and before the night was over, we did shots of Jack with them. Cheers, New York!",3,3,2
21,Fiona A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,6/6/2017,Great local speakeasy vibe.  Super chill and friendly.  I never come to this place without meeting someone new.  Amazing bartenders.  Come on Sunday night for the live music just a chill jam nothing formal.  Love this place!!!,,,
22,Aisha C.,"Hawthorne, CA",99,183,102,2.0,3/27/2015,"So I like this place but the size ruined any happiness I might have had. I ordered the easy peasy during Happy hour and was pretty tipsy by the end of it. Happy hour means $5 jameson shots, $3 off well,  and $2 drafts, which because the bar is small means one beer. Happy hour does not mean half off cocktails, which are $12. When i say it's a small bar, it's literally 8 stools, 2 group booths,  1 toilet, and one bartender. I know Manhattan is expensive and most places are pretty tight but you can't drink comfortably or at all being elbowed in the back. But there are free Doritos so there's that.",2,2,1
23,Katie R.,"Danville, CA",10,4,0,5.0,1/22/2017,"The bartender was amazballs. So much dedication. So much heart. So much talent. An entertainer, comedian and thirst quencher. I have never been so impressed by a human being in my entire life. This man deserves a raise. His bar tending will stay in my heart forever. I will never be the same.",2,1,1
24,Christine K.,"Manhattan, NY",36,64,74,4.0,8/2/2016,"This is a cute little drinking hole perfect for a few post work drinks at a great price. The variety of beers on tap is very limited but sometimes that is a good thing. Choice can be overwhelming and this place just simplifies the whole process. Just what you need after a demanding day at the grindstone! The venue is bijoux but the cosiness cannot be hidden and the bar staff seem to always be playing the BEST tunes!! Happy hour is between 5-7 and this is the prime time to hit the Guthrie as you can enjoy some tipples, then feel the hunger before moving on for dinner having relaxed the day away over some good quality drinks. I have never experienced anything but a friendly welcome and a good laugh with the bar staff and recommend the Guthrie for those who live or work nearby!",,,1
25,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",143,726,51,4.0,8/5/2016,The Guthrie may be one of the few bars west of Lex in the area and luckily it's pretty damn good. I stopped in to grab a cocktail after grabbing food and a beer next door. There were a couple seats up front as well as in back so we had no issues there. I had the Donkey Juice which was strong and tasty. My friends had some tiki drink and some smoky drink which they devoured. At $11-$12 a cocktail the drinks are fairly reasonable and they had beers for only $4 and $5. The bartender was friendly and laid back and while we only stayed for one drink we thoroughly enjoyed our self. The combo of The Guthrie Inn and Earls makes for a great night.,,,
26,Dave L.,"Brooklyn, NY",3391,2363,18241,5.0,12/20/2014,"Pull hard.Their front door can be tight. You may need to add a little gusto to get it open.The Guthrie Inn is a virtual speakeasy, all dim lighting, light seating, and a definite lack of obvious signage. And they serve cocktails. It's a short walk from the 96th Street Lexington station; you'll be sipping fizzy there faster than you can bat your eyelashes.We ended up here accidentally while lamenting the early close of a neighboring bar[1]. I don't know what inspired us to check next door, but luckily we did. During our inaugural visit, a lone bartender[2] served us at the bar, introducing me to a whiskey I've never had. His pour was mean. He might've told jokes.Stop in solo, with a date, or with a few friends. It's that kind of place.[1] Earl's Beer and Cheese, if you're curious. It was a weeknight, so it probably wasn't fair to lament as hard as we did.[2] I've since forgotten the identity of our mystery bartender, but the current bartenders are just as welcoming.",3,2,2
27,K S.,"Rochester, MN",0,22,17,4.0,4/15/2017,Amazing drinks. Crafty - drink makers. Upbeat crowd. Next to earls and you can BYOF - with permission. Some fun games and I go here for my craft drink cravings. Well balanced drinks!!!,,,
28,Lindy D.,"New York, NY",160,72,69,4.0,6/29/2016,"The Guthrie is a staple for the people who live and work in this area. You will frequently find pods of Mount Sinai residents, nurses, etc getting after work drinks here. The bar has a nice-but-small front area with a big window that they open up in warm weather. There is a much larger seating area in the back with little tables. Drink-wise, the bartenders here are chill and mix a good cocktail. There are usually 2 beers on tap and then bottled stuff available. They added a limited selection of snacks - including a little pizza - to the menu fairly recently and that's a big improvement. They do 2 for 1 beers at happy hour which is a great value. I only give 4 stars since the selection of tap beer is limited. Overall: A little local bar with good cocktails. Popular with the after-work crowd.",,,
29,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,4.0,9/22/2014,"Speakeasy type bar on the nether regions of the UES that you can occassionally find me face down at. In a good way! Not much up this way other than the terrific Earl's Beer and Cheese. It's right next door and the area it's in looks like an underdeveloped country. The views across the street are basically of the subway heading underground and some apartment buildings. That being said it's a nice reprieve to hide away in this dark and seemingly obscure spot for an exceptional cocktail.The Guthrie Inn, though small in stature, packs quite a hefty punch when it comes to proper libations. You might find me sprawled out on the cozy leather couches in the darkly lit back room sipping on a Sidecar, Old Fashioned, and even a Sharpie Mustache. The classic cocktail list is one that takes a page out of the Roaring 20's to Maltese Falcon era of men wearing fedoras and the ladies in demure vintage dresses. The bartenders are quite the mixologists with a wonderful encyclopedia of drink recipes stored away and ready to go at your request.Every drink I have encountered here has been excellent, and never have regretted any choice that passed my lips. The place itself exudes a relaxed vibe, and the patrons here reflect that as you won't find the frat boy crowd that populates a lot of the UES bar scene. Cocktails are in the $10-$12 range, and the menu of options reads more like quality over quantity. Decent bourbon list to choose from too. Great choice to bring a date if up this way. Not much by way of seating but the front area also opens up a bit to let in some fresh air. Chill atmosphere. Quality cocktails. A bit sexy and seductive. Earls Beer and Cheese next door. Whoa! What is happening up here on the far Upper East Side? This strange new land actually has some good things going on all of a sudden.",19,15,18
30,Josh K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",292,1301,45,4.0,9/21/2014,"Very very small place, people describe it as a speakeasy but I would call it a fancy dive bar with solid cocktails. It is at times a one person operation, two at peak hours. It feels like it's in the middle of nowhere, which is cool because this place gets a very local vibe. No tourists, no sports fans.The back room is very classy, a U shaped bench seating arrangement where up to 10-12 people could squeeze in. It's inconvenient if it's two different parties, in that case you'd want to go all the way to the back so you don't get disturbed as often by people coming through.Cocktails range from $11-14. Check out the bitters that they have up front and I think they will make you custom drinks if you are curious and ask about them. They will make you something good for all the ingredients you choose.I would come here again, it's a great uptown stop that doesn't feel as pretentious as other speakeasy style places.",2,,1
31,R G.,"Westhampton Beach, NY",0,38,59,4.0,11/14/2016,"We happened upon this place on a Friday night.  If we were looking for it, we probably wouldn't have found it...really a hole-in-the wall kind of spot ~ my favorite!You walk in and know you've found something special.  The bar is small, but crowded. The people are happy and the bartenders obviously enjoy their job.  There's a cool little room in the back also. The rest room is the size of a postage stamp!We had walked in and out of a couple of spots that had only beer and/wine so we were happy to find this cocktail bar.  Peter was a great bartender whom we trusted to surprise us with craft cocktails...he did not disappoint.We met some friendly people at the bar and look forward to getting back someday.

If I time traveled from the 1800's, I'd probably dig a place like this.The antique chandelier is gorgeous and a nice piece to stare off to.It's fun to bounce from here from Earl's after some casual eats and beer to something a little more upscale, but still mildly casual if necessary (you can barely seem anyways..).It's in a strange location, but ideal for the Mount Sinai crowd.Charming - I give it a 4.",1,,

Very chill and a cool place to hang out. However, please note it is small! The drinks are yummy but a little pricey (or--similar to what you would see in other places). Went during happy hour and you can get $3 off well drinks or $5 Jameson shots.  There's a smaller space in the back which could probably fit in a larger crowd of friends (maybe 5 or so). I would recommend checking it out though!",,,

It's a very small space with a little back room area that's pretty cool. The size is perfect for what it is though.

Hell, look at Milk & Honey, they have NO menu.And yes, the place is small. Because it's for people who love a good cocktail, not for a group of 6-8 dilettantes in stilettos looking for martinis (oh, I'm sorry, and the adventurous one who's into Manhattans).I don't mean to sound snobby here, but I've been to a number of nice cocktail establishments, and I came away very happy with the Guthrie Inn.It's not Earl's Beer & Cheese, and it's not ABV, it's not meant to be, and it can't be compared to them. If you do, then you're not getting what the Guthrie Inn is about.Look, if you value a well-made cocktail, this is the best place in the area (for now).(P.S. - It has a bar made of nuts.

Bartenders have been super chill and helpful every time I've been.Only issue is that it can get crammed real quick if more than about 10-15 people are in there at one time.All-in-all a very welcome addition to this part of town and will definitely be back at some point.",3,,2

51,Aisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",49,13,0,4.0,5/11/2016,"This is a wonderful, simple local joint.  Some of the reviews on here have complained about the size--it is certainly a smaller-sized bar--but I think that adds to its charm.  (So does the small, candle-lit, single bathroom.)  The two bartenders that I've met so far were both very friendly and willing to make me less than traditional cocktails.  The mysterious pizza special mentioned on the chalkboard in the front room next to the bar is delicious--they order it from a pizza place nearby so it comes piping hot.  The well-drinks are a little pricey for the quality, but nothing too crazy for NYC and I think generally worth it for the ambiance (especially if you can grab the table in the front room right next to the door).",,,
52,Jennifer G.,"Bronx, NY",310,141,128,5.0,1/13/2014,"Probably one of my favorite bars in NYC. I wasn't expecting this place to be anything spectacular when I first heard of it, but I was surprised when I realized how absolutely delicious the drinks were.The place is very deceiving from the outside as it looks like a tiny hole in the wall. It's small inside, but that makes it cozy. It's dimly lit and rather romantic- I would suggest it for a first date or as a chill spot for friends if you sit all the way at the back where there is a couch. I tried the following drinks: Easy Peasy (my favorite), Corpse Reviver, and Sharpie Mustache. I have to say these drinks are like nothing I ever had. The bartender then created some other drinks for my friends which were good as well, but not sure of the names as he just asked what base they wanted (whiskey) and he added the rest. They're aromatic, flavorful, perfectly iced, and start with one distinct taste and leave you with another. The bartender is skilled for sure! This is a hidden gem! Loved it!I will be going back!",3,,2

While we both love this place, it definitely is not conducive to conversation, which is how we stumbled upon Guthrie Inn to grab one more drink before heading home.The place was largely empty (but it was a weekday night...) and we struck up a conversation with the awesome bartender, Ben, after ordering our drinks. Ben is a cool guy who takes all aspects of his job very seriously and is more than willing to engage in a conversation about everything from the economy to mixology 101. He had a number of infusions of his own creation that he let us sample and walked us through his process. Both the drinks and the conversation were a great way to lift our mood and get us both out of the bad funk we had previously been in. And! We walked away having learned so much more about cocktails! I recommend this place to anyone who lives in the area and have told all of my East Harlem friends about it!",2,,

However, the place is SO dark, you can't even read the menu, which was printed on darker coloured paper, making it even more difficult to read! Moreover, I was severely disappointed in the bartender who told me he didn't know how to make a black russian cocktail. The white russian was on the menu.

Super cozy (aka small), cute environment, and quite frankly, one of the top 2 cocktail bars on the Upper East Side right now. I'm a fan, and I'd never have a problem drinking here. It might not compete with the best downtown bars for overall drink selection and talent of the staff, but what they do have is high quality, it's a friendly atmosphere and I will probably be back.Downside: No food.

65,Amal R.,"New York, NY",30,70,10,5.0,4/19/2012,"Wow. Absolutely blown away. I'm a long-standing patron of Earl's ( I know the staff way too well), and I was slow to warm to their wine bar around the corner, ABV (though I really like it now), but The Guthrie Inn comes in a very close second to the original. It fills yet another much-needed niche in the Upper East Side. With beer and wine covered, they've now added cocktails to their repertoire. The cocktails here are amazing! Honestly some of the best cocktails I've ever had. You have the infamous but all around good-guy, Chris, a former Earl's bartender, currently bartending at Amor y Amargo downtown, to thank for these concoctions.  But be warned, some of them are dangerous, including my first drink of the night, The Sharpie Moustache, which is a mix of rye, gin, amaro and bitters. It's extremely strong, but also in the top 3 cocktails of my life - and I'm pretty picky. All of the flavors come out well. I wanted to go a little easier for my 2nd round and got The Last Word, which is gin-based, and it definitely hit the spot. It's more on the sour side and very refreshing. My buddy had the Martinez, a gin-based martini which was strong and a little saltier, and the Guthrie Julep, which is fairly traditoinal. I tried tiny sips of  both, and they were delicious! As bar snacks, they also serve ""caramel puffs"" (think corn pops but a millions time more amazing) and pretzel-like dried sesame crisps (much better than pretzels and less salty).Location-wise, it's right next door to Earl's. with only a stairwell leading up to the surrounding apartments interrupting the two. It's got a very nifty, almost speakeasy-ish decor. Lots of wood interrupted by by red booths and barstools, a gorgeous red ceiling and chandelier hanging from it, and a larger booth space in the back if you come with a group. Very cool and somewhat more upscale than Earl's next door. Definitely would make for a great date place if you could convince said date to come all the way up here.This is probably the 2nd best bar to hit the UES, with Earl's of course being first. Go figure that I decided to end my night with the mantra ""Liquor before beer, you're in the clear"" and walked all of about 5 feet next door to grab a couple beers at Earl's after. These two being next-door to each other is a dangerously amazing combo. Seriously, go to the Guthrie Inn NOW! There aren't enough good things I can say about this place. Come here soon, because I can only imagine how packed it will get in the next few weeks!",9,5,4
66,Sara B.,"Manhattan, NY",49,120,0,5.0,11/25/2012,"The Guthrie Inn is a gem-- a quaint, off-the-beaten-path space with a warm, inviting decor and a small but thoughtful menu of excellent cocktails. I've said this kind of thing before, but places like this give me hope that my neighborhood is cooler than people give it credit for.My husband and I came by with a couple friends for his birthday. In the course of the night, the 4 of us probably tried half of the cocktails they offered and they were all delicious. The menu was heavy on the gin and rum, my two least favorite spirits, but the bartender gladly made substitutions and prepared a perfect Old Fashioned with bourbon for me. My friends--even my buddy who usually prefers just booze and a mixer--were raving about the gimlet. The drinks were $10-12, which is exactly what I would expect from a craft cocktail place in the city.When we first came in (at around 11ish on a Saturday night), it was somewhat crowded and we had to squeeze in by the bar. Within an hour, though, we were able to snag a cozy booth at the front. The crowd ebbed and flowed throughout the night and was just the right size-- it was never so empty that I felt overly self-conscious, but never so crowded that we were uncomfortable.  I LOVED the decor. The space, which coincidentally has similar bones to my apartment, is long and narrow, with rich red brick walls, dark wood accents, vintage style wallpaper, and leather booths. It felt very warm and timeless, which was just right for a 400 square foot spot tucked away in a pre-war building on a quiet corner of a very residential area.",1,,1

68,Rick A.,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",1,36,0,5.0,7/1/2012,"Don't go here if you're expecting a full-scale mixology place (menu isn't especially long). Also don't go here if you have a group of more than 5. Do go here if you live on the UES and are looking for an excellent alternative to the typical bar scene.Right next door to another great option, Earl's, the Guthrie Inn does for cocktails what Earl's does for beer: that is, squeeze everything into a tiny space and add some hipster. The decor takes you back a couple of decades but is not overly obnoxious. The clientele seemed very similar to Earl's, with a lot of hipsters but also some locals looking for a lower-key spot to grab a few drinks. While it does get pretty cozy, as other reviewers have pointed out, they have some booths in the front and back that are perfect for a group if you can snag them. Drinks aren't overly expensive ($10-15 range) and ours were all strong, so no complaints there.Overall, it's the perfect place to grab a few drinks with friends and is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",2,,1

The room is tiny and cozy, which was no biggie on a quiet Sunday afternoon. The decor had a fun Wes Anderson-ish retro feel, especially the wallpaper, which I covet. I agree that the bartender wasn't the sort of mixology pro you find at other cocktail places. There was that lack of smoothness and finesse in the way the drinks are created. However, our drinks were still interesting and tasty. We went in for one and ended up having three. I had a tequila based cocktail that was smoky, a little spicy, and very addictive. My DH had a Manhattan and a couple of other rye/whiskey based drinks that he enjoyed. Bartender was super friendly.We had so much fun that I called in sick the next day...",1,2,1
70,Vonetta Y.,"Washington, DC",207,588,1,3.0,4/3/2013,"I've been known for saying on yelp, ""The DJ makes the club."" A DJ can turn a crappy place into the best party ever OR turn the most beautiful club into a desert. Guess that rule should be amended to include, ""The bartender's music choices make the bar.""In our seemingly neverending search for a Cheers bar in East Harlem or the UES, R found Guthrie on yelp. We were excited when we finally found it on a Saturday night. We walked in to find a pretty normal-looking scene, with people sitting at the bar and a group up front by the windows. The bartender passed us menus, which we read by candlelight since it's so freaking dark in there. I can't remember the name right now, but I had the drink made of rum with a bit of honey. It was the perfect combination of winter and spring in a glass, warming my throat, but leaving a sweet kiss behind. I also can't remember what R got, but it was nice and boozy.We found a spot in the microscopic room in the back, where, as we entered, the couple sitting there up and left. ""Guess they were going to make out,"" R said. I shrugged. We leaned back and savored our drinks, cozy in the candlelight that sent warm shadows across our faces as looked at each other. ...Then we noticed that ""Born to Be Wild"" was playing. Next up, Tom Petty. Next up, Guns 'N Roses...all getting progressively louder, which made everyone in the bar talk louder, which made me think we might as well have gone to a sports bar, played billiards, and drank MGD instead of coming here. The music just didn't fit, and the discord was actually rather unnerving.Nothing kills a girl's mojo like vintage rock and roll, at least in this space! Such a beautiful space calls for jazz, or at least white-guys-who-sound-like-Black-guys R&B, a la Robin Thicke. (Which made me wonder aloud [by accident], ""Whatever happened to Jon B?"")So, basically, Guthrie Inn could be great. Perfect for a pre-sexy time date. But the music completely obliterated any amorous mood the drink could have worked up. We might try it again on a weeknight (since the drinks were amazing), but if every day has music this unfitting, we might not.",,,

97,Catherine O.,"Manhattan, NY",31,6,2,5.0,6/17/2013,"Best cocktails in the neighborhood, a taste of the East Village (in the best way) way uptown.",,,
98,Ashish P.,"Houston, TX",0,2,0,1.0,2/7/2014,Extremely rude bartender (rudest I've ever encountered in NYC) who provided very poor service and average-at-best drinks and the bar is full of some very trashy clientele that appeared to be regulars. Would strongly recommend not going to this place. Very disappointed as I had high hopes for it.,2,,
99,G G.,"New York, NY",122,304,5,5.0,1/13/2013,"cute, cozy, and an absolute gem in a non cocktail area...great cocktails and nice selection of bottled brown water.. and the lovely option of getting a super delicious grilled cheese next door!",,,
100,F A.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,5.0,11/19/2012,The best hidden gem!  Cozy and unpretentious atmosphere.  Great cocktails and bourbon selection.  The best bar on the UES!,,,
101,Trevor P.,"Manhattan, NY",77,152,7,2.0,6/10/2012,"Compared to other cocktail-focused bars in the city, Guthrie's is very near the bottom of the list. I went here a few times to be sure it wasn't just a bad experience or two... and it's unfortunately a consistently weak venue.While Earl's pulls off the tiny-bar thing in glorious fashion, Guthrie's doesn't make it work. The orientation of the actual bar makes the entire place feel crowded if more than a dozen people are here at the same time. When it's hot out, it's sweltering in here. And the drinks are pretty expensive while feeling a bit amateur-ish. There's a lot more to making a great mixed drink than just putting the right proportion of each ingredient in a glass together, and I feel like that's all that happens here. The bourbon list, however, is slightly above average for the UES, so I usually just go for a straight pour now. It's faster, and it's tougher to mess up.I would have been a lot happier if they just made another Earl's here.",,,
102,Matthew E.,"Manhattan, NY",522,24,1,5.0,7/31/2014,"My go to and local spot on the Upper East Side. Awesome drinks, good bartenders and great atmosphere. Perfect spot to bring a date, or if you just want a relaxing night with some delicious cocktails.",,,
103,B W.,"New York, NY",1,29,0,5.0,1/2/2014,"New favorite neighborhood bar. Never too crowded, drinks are interesting, and the bartender is great.",,1,
104,Moises G.,"Manhattan, NY",3,4,0,4.0,9/19/2014,"goof ambience, if you can't think of anything off the menu, the bartender will make something based on type of liquor and taste. had an awesome time, good vibes.",,,
105,Andrea L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,23,0,5.0,6/12/2012,"If you know Earls and ABV, you won't be disappointed coming into the third establishment. With Earls being beer, ABV being wine, The Guthrie Inn is entirely focused on cocktails. Although there is no food, the place is a bar that not only serves great drinks, but also puts you in a fun and unique atmosphere. The place doesn't have your usual cocktail list (i.e. pomegranate martini) but some truely original recipes that you can't find at a lot of bars in the city (ESPECIALLY the upper, upper east side). It's a truely pleasant experience unlike the usual night out at a bar where everyone around seems to have had one too many. I would definitely recommend and will be back again soon!",,,
106,Blake B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,5.0,12/10/2013,"Quaint, adorable, homey bar - just what the UES needed! The craft drinks are made with love and absolutely delicious and unique, and the music is at a volume where you don't need to raise your voice to hear who you're with (who knew this was possible!?). My favorite place uptown, by far!!",,,
107,R D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,5.0,8/31/2013,"Great cocktails, great bartenders, great vibe, right next to Earl's, right in my backyard. Love it.",,,
108,Valerie B.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",1,14,0,5.0,7/21/2013,"A cocktail bar on my block, yes please! It's dark, it's comfy, and the drinks are great. Come here if you love your liquor. My only complaint is that you may have to stand on a weekend night.",,,
109,Veronica C.,"New York, NY",24,111,15,3.0,6/26/2012,"Earls seems to be the only success at this chain. My friend and I were recently at ABV and the older blonde bartender was truly horrible, and knew nothing about wine, even though it is a wine bar. The other night we came in to check out Guthrie instead of going back to ABV just to be snubbed by the bearded too cool for school bartender.  Pretentious and horrible service. He too knew nothing about his menu or his whiskeys either. Please, go back to Williamsburg and serve PBR, bro. I'm giving 3 stars because they have a good menu and the atmosphere is nice.",,,1
110,S B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,5.0,2/23/2013,"This place is great.  A wonderfully intimate local spot.  More over, the manager and bartender are the best around.  Nothing will get people back to a place more than good customer service and these guys went above and beyond when we had a credit card fiasco... Despite the mistake being on the part of the previous bar that had given us back the wrong person's credit card, these guys were incredibly understanding and even took care of the bill.  I'll definitely be back!",,,
111,M G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,0,4.0,10/24/2012,"The Guthrie Inn is a great place for a low key drink with some good friends. The music is always good, it's never too crowded, and the drinks are pretty awesome. Only downside: no wine served, but if you're into cocktails, you won't miss it at all.",,,
