The workers are extremely attentive, pleasant, and friendly. The food came fresh, hot, and fast. Half off wings and $4 lime shots during happy hour (4-9pm).Ps, the sweet potato fries are AMAZING! Tastes like dessert and comes with marshmallow dip.",,1,
1,Kendra C.,"New York, NY",51,170,469,4.0,10/28/2018,"Really good crazy burgers and even crazier shakes that I didn't get a chance to try. They have all different types, I tried the stuffed cheeseburger which was delicious! Also for a little extra I substituted a charcoal bun, which I'm not sure has real health benefits but made me feel slightly better about eating a stuffed cheeseburger. Also beyond just shakes and burgers, they have decent happy hour deals, like half price wings and cheap drinks, so it's a nice well rounded place. I didn't order a shake last time, but from the looks of it they have huge instagram worthy shakes that look delicious. Definitely worth a trip here, instagram or not",,,
2,Kevin V.,"Glendale, Queens, NY",161,110,244,2.0,10/12/2018,"I'm always down for a good burger joint and lately the gimmick seems to be massive crazy shakes and quality burger. This was my first time at the shake and burger bar and wasn't a really good experience. Today I kept it simple and ordered the bacon and cheddar burger cooked medium a very simple basic order and one of there signature burgers. The waitress then informs me ""I don't know if we have cheddar..."" I would think with one of your signature burgers you'd have the ingredients. Considering the place opens at 4pm and it was a Wednesday night and there were about 5 customers in the entire place at around 7 o'clock. So I substituted my cheese. As for my side I ordered the signature loaded fries. She comes back and  says ""oh we don't have the cheese sauce for those fries..."" seems like they have nothing back there in the kitchen. At this point I was a little frustrated so just got regular fries. The food comes and my burger is a wellDone flavorless hockey puck and the fries are a pretty soggy. At this point I'mNot even going to use the check in offer and get one of the crazy shakes.  The waitress brings us our bill and they do have a student discount of 10% which is good but as I'm driving home looking at the receipt details which I should've done in the restaurant I see she still charged me for the loaded fries that I never ordered. Oh and did mention their internet was down at the end of the meal so we had to wait about 20Minutes for them to process a payment. A first experience and possibly a last this wasn't the way to have a repeat customer.",1,,
3,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",195,144,219,4.0,10/4/2018,"Saw this place all the time and decided its time to try it. It's also burgers and everyone loves burgers.They have happy hour everyday 4-8pm, and wings are half off. They have these insane looking shakes akin to black tap. We got there around 6:30pm and were wanted immediately. There's plenty of options on the menu for burgers, drinks and appetizers.The burgers were very interesting as they had lamb burger as well as chicken and salmon (although they were out of all three that night sadly) but nonetheless the available options still sounded delicious. I opted to create my own burger. The base is $12, comes with the normal works of a 8oz patty that has a blend of chuck, prime, and two other meat types. Almost standard brioche bun, lettuce, tomato, onions and fries. I opted to add a sunny side up egg ($1.50) and to have the charcoal bun ($2) instead. Burger came out and it's actually quite big. I tried the fried first and they were superb. Good amount of crisp, nicely flavored. It's not a large quantity though but I'd rather have a small quantity of good tasting fries over a large quantity of bland fries.The burger itself was good and juicy. The egg really adds flavor to a burger, much like bacon. The charcoal bun was a good choice as I felt like it added a nice texture to it. I'd recommend you to stop by and try this place out. The food is inexpensive and there's happy hour almost all the time. Burgers are fantastic at a great price point and the staff is friendly.",,,
4,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",733,389,4425,4.0,9/19/2018,"I came here with a friend for lunch on a leisurely Saturday afternoon. I have been wanting to try this place for their unique burgers and humongous milkshakes. The atmosphere was chill and inviting. There were several burgers that sounded great and managed to narrow it down to 2: Surf and Turf or the Truffle Mac N Cheese. I finally decided on the Surf and Turf, which came with lobster, melted special cheese sauce and beef patty on a charcoal bun. It was not what I was expecting though and the lobster which was in pieces tasted weird to me, especially with the cheese sauce. I really didn't like it and when I let the waitress know, she responded with: ""What would you like me to do about that?"" Wow, do you really need to ask? It was such an awkward moment and I wasn't quite sure how to respond. She then said she would ask the manager to see if they will allow me to order something else.Thankfully, they let me change my order and I got the Truffle Mac N Cheese, which came with bacon. This was a very good choice. The truffle mac n cheese was absolutely delicious with great truffle flavor. The beef was juicy, charred slightly, seasoned well and the bacon was nicely crispy and worked perfectly with the mac n cheese and meat. The french fries were also very tasty, crunchy with plenty of potato-y goodness.The milkshake we ordered was the Salty Nut Shake and it came as our dessert. It was definitely an impressive sight to behold, consisting of a large chocolate cupcake with peanut butter frosting, marshmallow, nutter butter cookie, chocolate covered pretzels, a whole lotta whipped cream and the top of the glass was covered with chocolate frosting and pretzels. The milkshake itself was pretty good and quite sweet. I really enjoyed the peanut butter frosting on top of the cupcake, which was delightfully creamy and smooth. The cupcake part was just okay. The other aspects I liked were the marshmallow and chocolate frosting with pretzels.The service was decent, except for that one hiccup with the Surf and Turf burger but the waitress redeemed herself after that by being extra accomodating and friendly. My friend and I plan to come back. I would like to try the plantain burger and share another massive gourmet milkshake.",10,6,9

6,Chad S.,"Naples, FL",87,244,635,3.0,7/15/2018,"Amazing staff!!!! Clearly well managed and staff has thorough understanding of how they make more money for themselves... (for those who live in Southwest FL, it's called making your guests feel you care about their experience and want to make sure it's great).  From greeter to server to food runners and bussers, they are all engaging and thoughtful.So your already asking yourself why only a 3-Star rating...  I know, not what I was hoping to be giving them considering I went out of my way to eat here after seeing all the great looking pictures.I came in on 7/14 in the evening.I tried the Bang Bang Shrimp, Surf and Turf Burger, Onion rings.The Bang Bang Shrimp seemed to be freshly prepared, vs the usual freezer-pack special many places offer.  The batter was more reminiscent of a well seasoned, very crispy double-dipped fried chicken batter than fried shrimp.  On one hand I kinda liked it... on the other hand the coating made it taste more like a really great fried chicken nuggets vs shrimp.  The ""BANG"" was missing from the sauce... it was barely a Snap as it didn't pack a lot of punch or spiceAs for the Burger, I see NYC cooks went to same burger training school as the ones in most other parts of the country... which is no matter how a guest says they want it cooked, it gets prepare it well done. While I usually expect this when I order a burger at most places, when I go to a place with BURGERS as half the name and accounting for 100% of their entrees, I expect the cooks to know how to prepare a burger to order. (See my photo for reference if you don't believe me).  It wasn't a fluke, the 2 tables next to me ordered Medium and they all came out well done.  If I wasn't starving I would have sent it back.Usually I wouldn't complain so much... even in this case, a burger is kinda like sex,  even the bad isn't all tat bad, but on top of the burger being over cooked, it was surprisingly lacking flavor... with the cheese and lobster salad topping removed, it was down right bland with little to no seasoning at all... taking me back to my mother's way of preparing burgers and steaks at home (who made me hate steak until I was an adult and tried it some place else).To top it off ( yes, still on the burger) the surf part of the burger was kinda... Mehhh...  I wouldn't say it was bad, perhaps it was just that I expected something different, like less salad base and more lobster meat... like the one I saw in the Yelp pictures taken by the owner.The onion rings were pretty good, and this spicy sauce they served with it was great... not sure why the bang bang sauce wasn't even close to being this spicy.By the time it came to order the shake; which I really wanted to order... Honestly, because I was so underwhelmed by the burger and confused by the shrimp (I did like them... just not as a Bang Bang shrimp dish), I decided I just didn't want to spend anymore money here for something that might again, look totally awesome but not taste as good as it looked.Would I come back?  I'm sure I'd come here for drinks and I'd definitely bring my 13 year old for a crazy shake... just for the novelty... and if I was a broke student because they sell beer and the portions are generous (I have leftovers for a full second meal of shrimp and burger), but as an adult with lots of dining options in this city, doubtful",4,1,2
7,Jamie Y.,"Manhattan, NY",298,73,159,2.0,7/14/2018,"I don't know if I came in on a bad day and ordered the wrong food because I seem to be the outlier. I was pretty excited to try this place out since it reminded me of Black Tap Burger. To my surprise, I was disappointed by the service and food. When my friend and I got there, we waited a good 5 minutes before noticing the small ""seat yourself"" sign at the front. When we sat down, we waited even longer before the waitress even noticed us to take our order. By the time our food came, we were starving and excited to dig into our deceiving delicious looking food. Let me start off with the milk shake. Although it looked colorful and tasty, they used cheap quality sweets on the top. We also got the charcoal burger and the bun was extremely dry. Very disappointed as this place has a lot of potential.",1,,
8,Min C.,"Manhattan, NY",255,52,72,5.0,7/7/2018,"Glad we found this place last minute! My friend and I were trying to find a dinner place before the movies and we saw this new place open up and decided to give it a go. This place is very spacious with a full bar and tv's all around. They even have a dessert shake bar (where they make those big milkshakes). Our server was very friendly and placed our orders in right away. I ordered the turkey burger with black bun (I think it is made of squid ink) and my friend ordered the salmon burger with sweet potato fries. All their burgers comes with fries and you can pay $2 extra to substitute for sweet potato or onion rings, etc. The sweet potato fries has extra toppings like cinnamon and sugar that is put on it (expect it to be extra sweet), it also comes with marshmallow fluff as a dipping sauce (lol?)Anyways, the turkey burger was good but not perfect. I think they need to get rid of the squid ink black bun because it was very dry. The patty itself was good though but having it paired with the black bun wasn't good. I also tried some of my friends salmon burger and would give that a 10/10! Definitely get the salmon burger if you decide to come here! We were so stuffed by the time we finished so we didn't get to order the shake but if you have room for dessert I would recommend one! I saw a girl to the table next to us order one and it looks sooo good! Can definitely be shared because it is HUGE!If I am in the area, I would def come back for that salmon burger!!",1,,1
9,Rebecca L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,43,35,5.0,9/30/2018,"Ordered a burger and peanut butter shake, both were amazing. The burger was cooked perfectly though, well seasoned with full pieces of bacon on top and lots of cheese which I love. On top of that, the brioche bun was actually so buttery and a great addition to the overall flavor of the burger (most brioche buns I get are plain and dry). On top of the great meal, the restaurant staff was very helpful and friendly. I ordered for delivery via Uber eats and there was an issue with the delivery person, so when I called the restaurant to get the issue settled, the staff took care of everything without me having to contact Uber to get my delivery sorted out. Great food and service, I'll definitely be back!",,,
10,Shantelle C.,"New York, NY",53,190,958,5.0,6/30/2018,"Although my boyfriend had this place bookmarked, this was not where we were initially planning to go; I am so glad that things played out how they did and we ended up here! :)The hostess greeted us with great energy and a huge smile, which was very welcoming! We were seated immediately and given menus. After a quick glance at the menu I kind of already knew I wanted a burger; I got the bacon cheddar burger and my boyfriend ordered a grilled chicken club; both of these orders come with fries. We also ordered cheeseburger sliders, and I am not going to lie... the black buns threw me off. LMAO. The waiter assured that it taste just like regular bread! Oh, and as for drinks... the pina colada tasted like it did not have liquor.",1,2,2
11,Tahara M.,"New York, NY",178,49,10,4.0,9/18/2018,I got the carribean burger which wasn't too bad. Also got the guacamole and chips which were delicious. The shake was amazing! I got the salty nut and I would recommend.,,,1
12,Caitlin G.,"New York, NY",384,65,40,3.0,5/9/2018,"Came here around 6:45 right before the HH special was about to end. Food: started with the wings which were half off during HH ($4.50) and they were standard. Pretty hard to screw up wings. Next we ordered a strawberry milkshake, the mac & cheese burger and the stuffed burger. By the name of the restaurant you would expect the shakes and burgers to be delicious. The shake was delicious but the burgers did not live up to the name. The burgers were cooked well, but the flavors just weren't there. I will say that their prices are less than most places for a burger so if you're looking for a cheaper alternative that is good but not great this is the spot. Atmosphere: Interesting! Lots of TVs all around the restaurant playing sports and Disney movies. This makes the spot confusing because there is a full bar with great drink prices (pretty cheap for NYC, especially during HH!) but then Moana is playing for the children at the restaurant. Service: So good, that is why I feel bad only giving the place 3 stars! Very friendly and attentive. Everything came so quickly and my water cup was NEVER empty. Overall, this place is a 3.25 out of 5. I would come again for the milkshakes and the HH specials, however, it is not my go to spot for a great burger.",3,1,
13,Andrea G.,"Manhattan, NY",16,70,80,3.0,8/23/2018,"So I saw this as a new place on yelp, and the reviews were wonderful so I had it bookmarked as a place that I wanted to go. As more and more people wrote in their 5 star reviews I was becoming impatient to come here. Finally I was able to convince someone to come.  We missed the happy hour- which looks like a good deal if you're into beer and wings.The service when I arrived was amazing, 11/10. I was already excited, i feel bad right now giving a 3, because of how top notch the service was. However, I was here for the food. I tried the Buffalo wings, and thought they were nothing special - side note I don't like wings to begin with so I can be kind of a tough critic to begin with.  I then ordered the Chicken Club Wrap , which honestly i didn't like. It seemed like the chicken was not cooked well. I did however, like the fries if that counts for anything. I might come back one more time and give it a shot, just didn't seem like the food was fresh and healthy enough for what I am looking for. The portions just are crazy large, and there seems to be some substitutes for quality ingredients.",,1,1
14,Tara K.,"New York, NY",0,10,6,4.0,9/25/2018,"A large selection of photo worthy burgers and shakes! No complaints here! My Kids (teens +) loved it. Hubby and I enjoyed! It's more of a sports bar atmosphere but they sit you away from the bar. Worth a visit when in NYC! See pics, we ordered a few different shakes!",,,
15,Aleesia W.,"Arcanum, OH",135,48,14,5.0,8/10/2018,"The black bean and corn veggie burger is awesome (tip: add guacamole). Also, definitely upgrade to sweet potato fries... they come with a marshmallow dipping sauce that's to die for. Best part: the Oreo shake ... just as good as it looks.",1,,
16,Danan R.,"New York, NY",886,1843,43,3.0,7/28/2018,"Solid option for burgers and milkshakes with some interesting combinations.  Unlike 5 Napkin, the fries are included and you can choose to upgrade to sweet potato or onion rings for $2, which I recommend.  The onion rings are nicely seasoned and perfectly crispy.  1. The Surf & Turf burger with lobster and cheese on a charcoal bun was a nice concept for a blend of beef and seafood - however the burger itself was definitely on the bland side and got its flavor from the added toppings.  The lobster topping was just okay - definitely more salad vs lobster.  This came out on the well-done side vs medium rare. 2. The stuffed burger was decent with a blend of cheddar and American inside the patty - I recommend getting a schmear of mayo as the bun is a bit on the dry side.  The only note about this burger is that it definitely came out on the well-done side - however, that may be partially due to the stuffing.  3. Oreo brownie shake: Get this if you are TRUE fan of Oreos!  An explosion of a vanilla & Oreo shake topped with cookie dough pieces, more Oreos, brownies, vanilla ice cream, syrup, marshmallow, M&Ms, and sprinkles.  It's QUITE a sight to see and I would recommend coming here just to order one of the Insane shakes.  They are pricey, though, at $15.  Definitely will feed at least 2-3 so bring a friend.Overall, it's an okay venue for burgers and a place to stop by just to order a shake to try.",1,1,2
17,Kristine D.,"Queens, Queens, NY",48,6,6,5.0,7/9/2018,"This place is AWESOME!  Went there last Saturday night and had a blast!  When you walk in, the hostess has a huge smile on her face and greeted you like she was actually happy you are there.  A rarity in the city since most hostesses look like they'd rather be somewhere else.  Anyway, I digress.  Back to the review.After we were shown to our table, which are nicely spaced so you don't feel like you're on someone's date, the server was so nice and pleasant.  She made sure we had what we needed and brought us icey water.  Such a relief on steamy city nights.  The drink menu has a really nice assortment.  You can go straight ole beer to mixed drinks.  I ordered the My Blue Heaven and is was delish!!  Another person at the table ordered the Bikini Martini and it was very tasty as well.We ordered a sampling of appetizers like Loaded Fries, Fried Pickles, Bang Bang shrimp and the most amazing corn lollipops.  We didn't know where to start but I can tell you that everything was sooo good!  The corn reminded me of street corn you can get in mexico.  The Bang Bang shrimp were my favorite...spicy but you couldn't just have one!For the main course we split two burgers because these portion sizes are HUGE!  We had the Caribbean burger and the Black & Blue Bacon Cheeseburger.  They are, hands down, the BEST burgers I ever had.  The meat actually tasted like meat and the toppings were to die for.  And the prices???  So reasonable for the City, we couldn't believe it!You can't leave without trying one of their insane shakes...and boy did we ever.  We had The Salty Nut and the The Banana Cream pie.  Holy goodness Batman!  You really didn't know where to start, but they were so good.  We had to get rolled out of the place afterwards but we left satisfied with smiles on our faces.  We will definitely be back again.If you are thinking of giving this place a try, do it.  You will not be disappointed, BUT....just don't eat for two days before you go because you are going to want to try everything on the menu!Thank you for a fantastic evening The Shake & Burger Bar....we will be back!",1,,

It comes with 5 to 8 wings. The pizza burger was so filling. The upgraded fries tasted v good and was def worth the extra $3. The milkshake was way too much. I had to take the cake to go because I barely finished the milkshake. Personally, I would skip the milkshake next time I come because it was wayyy too sweet.

20,Mirza A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",145,5,15,5.0,5/12/2018,"The Shake and Burger Bar recently opened up around the corner from my school. I decided to give it a try with some friends and boy, did it leave an impression on me! As the name suggests, I ordered a shake and a burger.That first bite of the Salmon Burger ($13) made me feel like a fish out of water because it had taken me to a whole new world. The burger was filled with a beautiful salmon patty topped with creamy guacamole, crunchy grilled red peppers, and the taste-bud tingling bayou sauce which had hints of lemon that made the burger oh-so refreshing. Lemon on salmon is the physical definition of what love actually is. All burgers are served with french fries or various other sides of your choosing.Even though they had plain milkshakes on their menu ($7.50) I opted to try one of the ""Insane Shakes"" which are their artisanal milkshakes. I ordered the Junior's Cheesecake Raspberry Milkshake ($15) because, well, I am a cheesecake fanatic and I love Junior's. The shake arrives fully dressed up in a cinnamon toast crunch frosting all around the mug, a fried donut puff which was warm and crispy, some soft marshmallows, and a crunchy graham cracker. All of this was topped with some sexy whip cream, a luscious raspberry drizzle, and seductive caramel candies. The milkshake itself was the right amount of sweetness and thickness. I loved getting those random bites of cinnamon toast crunch when devouring the shake.Our waitress was kind enough to provide us with extra plates and spoons because she definitely knew I did not want to finish the milkshake on my own. The service overall was wonderful as was the wait time for our food. I did go right around the time they opened so seating was not a problem at all. This is definitely a great place to come with friends to catch up, have some drinks, enjoy great food, and watch some games. At this point, the only thing I am fearful of is all of the weight I am probably going to gain because I know I will definitely be coming back here over and over again!",3,1,

Five people in our party had their specialty milkshakes. Although they did take a while to come out, there is a disclaimer on the menu that because each insane shake is custom-made, it will take awhile to get them. They are works of art and are well worth the wait. The milkshake lady (shakeologist?) came over to apologize because of the wait, which was sweet, but unnecessary because we knew they would take awhile.The food was delicious. I had the salmon burger, which was light and had a slight spice. My son had the Caribbean burger which he really enjoyed. My other son had the Mac n cheese burger, which he also really liked. We shared the corn lollipops, which were creamy and spicy. The only complaint that I have was that the food came out pretty staggered- not a huge deal considering how large our party was. The only issue was that the very last dish to be brought out was the one item we ordered off of the children's menu for my eight year old son, so everyone except him had their food.The waitress was very friendly and apologetic about the issue and was overall very accommodating. On a final note, the prices are extremely reasonable.",,,

My friend and I both had the Left Coast Turkey burger.  I savored every moment of it. The sweet potato fries were delicious; the cinnamon sugar touch gave it a unique taste. The fries came with marshmallow dip. I was a bit nervous to try the dip. Unfortunately I we were too full to get the milkshake but I will be back to try them.

33,Katherine R.,"Hicksville, NY",0,2,3,5.0,8/8/2018,"OMG! EVERYTHING WAS SO AMAZING!!! And the customer service was even better!!! Evie was our server  and she was the best, making us feel like home! she was so nice and funny. We got the fried shrimp and amazing buffalo wings which by the way they are crunchy and so delicious. We also got the surf and turf burger and Mac and cheese which honestly made our mouth water once they came, and let me tell you about the god damn shake! That was sooooooooooo good, it was god in a bottle  we got the Oreo brownie  milkshake to share with my boyfriend cause they're huge and delicious! we heard about this place on the radio about 12 times and we just had to come and it was the best decision we made worth the train ride and 30min walk ‍‍ the price is amazing and the food is beyond, I'm definitely coming back and HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYBODY TO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT",,,
34,Ahmad M.,"Oxon Hill, MD",0,23,1,3.0,9/29/2018,"Great service, delicious shake but the burger was so tasteless i couldn't believe a place like this could remain open in nyc. It wasn't bad, it just was so bland. The bun also wasn't fresh and was falling apart, so the novelty of having activated carbon in the buns wore off fairly quickly. Another thing that bothered me is the food took so long to come, nearly an hour of waiting when the restaurant wasn't busy, but that's not all, all the food arrived together. Appetizers and burgers and fries and desserts just dumped onto the table at the same time. The shake was cool though, glad I got to Instagram that bad boy but I doubt I'll be back",,,
35,Tonie P.,"Bronx, NY",1,2,1,5.0,7/5/2018,"Update - 08.12.18We got off to a rough start, but I am happy; no! excited to report back that the second time around was exceptionally better than the first. I started with the Bang Bang shrimp, which were yummy. They had a nice kick to them! For my main. I had the Surf n'Turf! I did not pivot this time. The 1/2 burger, topped with a generous lobster salad portion and paired with the unique Charcoal Bun was everything! I had my burger with the sweet potato fries, which was like a dessert - the fries are layered with cinnamon and come with a marshmallow dip. The service was quick and like last time amazing! Thank you Eddie and team for a great 2nd visit! Can't wait to bring my family and friends. Check out @toniepartyofone (IG) for more pics.",,,

The order took over two hours to arrive (stated 30-40 mins online), and when i received it, my order was wrong. Food was warm and delicious, but not what i ordered. The deliverer(?) was awesome, very responsive. Word of advice don't order off grubhub!!!!!",,,
39,Valentina H.,"Port Washington, NY",2,30,24,5.0,5/5/2018,"I really love this place! I'm so tired of going to places with cool shakes, but gross food! The Shake and burger bar has amazing food! I had a burger with plátano as buns, it has fried cheese, pickled onions, guacamole and a fried egg, wow! The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had! They come with a marshmallow dipping sauce. The mozzarella sticks were crispy on the outside, but soft and stretchy in the middle.  Great service, outstanding food & delicious and cool looking shakes!",1,,1
40,Nadia N.,"Los Angeles, CA",1,4,3,5.0,6/16/2018,"To review this place is so simple for me to do! The food was amazing, the milkshake was definitely a bang for your buck and are so underrated and I definitely recommend you try one. The service and the owner were so hospitable and really want us to leave satisfied and we really did! Too bad we're not locals and are only visiting from the west coast because if not I'd definitely come every time I had a craving for a milkshake, or for a really filling meal ( like their burgers wow) ! Definitely the spot to go! (:",,,
41,Pasha T.,"New York, NY",40,95,99,1.0,8/22/2018,Bad. Bad . Bad. No water in the beginning. Fries were super burned. Hamburgers were dry and average. Drinks were horrible. The waitress was so bitchy. I just didn't get this place. Never again. Save ur money and time.,,,

The fruit loop shake with cotton candy was big hit!. TV's with sports, the kids were occupied while we had their $4 pints for cheap happy hour and a cheap pitcher of Stella. The corn on the cob ""lollipops"" amazing i like the creative food as its not just a burger place, fresh cut fries! Cant wait to come back for the burger though looked delicious. Our waiter was awesome he knew all the products and was super great and attentive. This is hard to find in NYC. Definitely coming back here to try another shake too - they had like 10 different kinds. Place is big and spacious which was nice. Really great experience.",,,
44,Carlos A L.,"New York, NY",8,5,0,3.0,8/8/2018,"It's ok. Don't get me wrong, the burgers are really really good and so are their fries (although they're kind of stingy with the amount of fries) but their specialty shakes are over-rated. Sure they look amazing & pretty but the amount of milk shake is very little. They over-price the shakes just based on the look. And prepare to get messy & sticky with all the shenanigans they put on top of the shakes. The ambience felt a little uncomfortable too. Yes it's called shake & burger ""BAR"" & their website emphasizes that it's a family friendly restaurant but the truth is, it really doesn't. Their chairs are too high for kids, very gloomy with a mix of 60's music... the chemistry just wasn't there.",,,
45,Eric T.,"Columbus, OH",293,79,0,4.0,7/16/2018,"So I'm in town to see my college boyz and we were looking for a good spot to cap off a Sunday Funday. JDT lives in Kips Bay and had been wanting to try this place out for a while. It had good reviews so we decided to give it a shot. Well, it had a nice environment...kinda on the dark side but clean. The waiters were friendly and we were seated immediately given it was kinda empty. I got the stuffed burger, and we got wings for the table. So I usually order medium rare but let's be honest, it always comes out medium. This was a bit closer to the rare side but still unfortunately missed to mark. It did have a good amount of cheese stuffed inside. They come on these charcoal buns that were a bit on the drier and stiff side for me. Otherwise, a good but not mind blowing burger. The wings were average...but with a happy hour, they were half off, and that was the redeeming factor. Only 2 flavors...buffalo and honey BBQ. We decided to split a shake 3 ways. Got the banana cream pie one, and WOW...it was amazing. The shake had a perfect thickness that you could still drink through a straw...not runny at all. It was topped with banana slices, whipped cream, and graham crackers. To top it all off, the rim was lightly covered w/ an icing and dipped in cinnamon toast crunch! Shakes are on the expensive side at around $15, but totally worth it. If you're a champ, you might be able to take it on solo, but definitely shareable. I'd come back.",,,1
46,Xiomara D.,"West New York, NJ",44,6,0,4.0,8/11/2018,Found this place totally by accident.  Needed a quick bite that was not chain.    We ordered all the outside the box things...sliders and a chicken wrap...both were great.  Place is bright and with the windows open feels very alive.  Will definitely return to try those insane looking fishbowl drinks and milkshakes...will need reinforcements...only not perfect thing...kitchen took a bit to get food out considering they were not that busy.,,,
47,Darren W.,"Upper East Side, Manhattan, NY",130,12,5,4.0,8/30/2018,"Burger was phenomenal, had the blue cheese burger and housed it. The wings were crispy and delicious. It is a true sports bar with burgers, fries, and shakes. Do not come here for a salad or other creative expectations other than the coolness of the shakes. The shakes are high quality and quite fancy. My only criticism is that I did not love the pastry decoration. Not that it was terrible but It was a little dry and it functioned as more of a garnish for the picture you will take of the magnificent huge shake you are about to imbibe. I have been here several times and I keep coming back. My next goal is to take down the fireball milkshake but I am too full to take a whack at it right now. I'll check in when I come back and it will be my conquest. Stay tuned...",,,
48,Jackie D.,"Commack, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/7/2018,"Terrible experience. They messed up my whole order and didn't have any ingredients, the milkshakes were overpriced especially because of how small and no flavor it had. I will not be going back",,,

50,Jay K.,"Manhattan, NY",5,88,0,5.0,7/12/2018,"You'll see from all the other reviews how highly people think of the food here. What you might not see is how important they value the customer experience. After a slight mixup with a recent delivery order, I got a call directly from the owner.  He was extremely empathetic to our experience and offered to have us back any time we wanted. He even offered to meet with us when we came in. Old school mentality to putting the customer first and building a restaurant around customer experience. Refreshing to see that still exists in a time when so many restaurants focus on things other than the customer. Bravo",,,
51,Sam S.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,7/20/2018,"Great food, great service, great vibe, and killer music, too.Tip: That lamb burger may just be the best thing I've had under a bun.  It's a perfect, beautiful blend of meat, toppings, and spices.  I don't think I've ever looked at a plate and thought, ""You know what this needs? Pickled turnips,"" but there they were and oh boy was it tasty; a stroke of genius, if you ask me.  The lamb is definitely my go-to meal, but the standard burger was pretty great, too.The fries are fresh and they've struck that right balance of crisp to fluff to salt.  Plus, the waitstaff and bartenders are kind, the owner is really sweet and he's eager to tell you all about his burger recipes, of which, so far, there's not a bad one in the bunch.Only downside:  The last time I went, I had an orange creamsicle shake and after hearing all about how great the shakes are, I was eager to try this spin on a childhood classic.  Maybe the hype got to me, but I thought it was just alright, a little bit too sweet for my tastes.  But everything else was so good that it hardly makes a difference in my rating and my overall experience.  I'll be back, probably again and again and again.  One of these days I'll brave an Insane Shake.",,,
52,Michelle C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,10,13,1.0,9/20/2018,"Horrible service, they shoved our group into a corner as soon as we walked in just because they were shooting an advertisement. We asked to order, and they wouldn't serve us until we were packing up our bags to leave.  Won't be coming back",,,

54,Jayden O.,"Kelowna, Canada",0,16,1,3.0,10/5/2018,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner a few nights ago and ordered the guacamole and chips, the california burger and the bacon cheese burger. The guacamole and chips were unbelievably tasty, tasted straight from Mexico. The burgers were yummy but very very try. We had to order a side of some sauces and put them on the burgers ourselves. I don't believe either had sauce on the buns. When we added the sauces they were much better but we thought they were still pretty basic nothing we'd die if we never had again. Still dreaming of the guacamole and chips though!!",,,

We had wings and nachos which were not good, seemed as if it was scraps thrown on a plate. Along with the Black n Blue bacon burger that was ok besides the dried out bun. I was so disappointed that we didn't even order a shake (the thing I was excited about the most). The decor of the restaurant was set up pretty nice with TVs all around. I doubt that we will be returning here.",,,

We ordered the Truffle Mac and Cheese burger and the Bacon Cheddar burger, and both were delicious! The Mac and cheese burger was our favorite, especially on the pretzel bun, and the fries were a great cut as well. We also got a regular chocolate milkshake since didn't have room for one of the insane ones and it was delicious!The space was large and looked like a great spot to watch sports or grab a drink. Would definitely recommend trying this place out.",1,,

He said it was his first night there! So we put in our order. One item was unfortunately not put into the system so we did have to wait. The owner, (I'm assuming) was super apologetic and compensated 2 drinks for us. He also came over before we even ordered our food to ask us about everything which I feel is very rare now. GREAT food. GREAT milkshakes. GREAT atmosphere. And GREAT service. If we ever come back to NYC we will definitely be back. THANK YOU for the outstanding customers service.",,,

The service was good...we did have to wait for the main dish but I appreciate that my food was not frozen prior to being delivered to the table. I had the corn lollipops which were good. I had the black and blue bacon burger while my husband had the Caribbean which was good too. I really liked the plantain on his burger. The burgers were seasoned very well and I am soooo happy I brought 1/2 home so I can snack on it later. We both had dark and stormies which were good and a good balance between ginger beer and rum. We had fries but his was loaded. So considering we use to live in the south we have come accostom to loaded fries being one way...So these fries were tasty but we hate  cheese sauce on loaded fries. But due tonpresentati9n I am not sure how you would melt shredded cheese. We had the salty nut shake which is really two desserts in one and I highly recommend it for 2 people unless you are greedy! It gave me a Serendipity dessert feel...which is good. All in all we liked our expereince and will come back for more shake and burgers.",,,

The burger was juicy, and just all around very tasty, added some of the bayou sauce for an extra kick.  The wait staff was also very pleasant and attentive.
