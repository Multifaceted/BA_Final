0,Daniel G.,"Laguna Beach, CA",1191,160,211,4.0,6/17/2018,"I'm staying at The Jewel Hotel, which is a couple of doors down. The restaurant is exclusive to guest of The Jewel and Club Quarters. So there is no wait and the service is exceptional. There was a buffet, which usually I'm all for, with fresh fruit and an omelette station. We opted to sit and order from the menu. I was there for breakfast two days in a row. The guys serving were excellent, very professional and friendly. The only thing that I have a peeve with is places not having some fresh salsa. NOT FROM A JAR. And no, Tabasco is not salsa. Other than that the food was delicious and ask for the orange marmalade!!!",3,2,2
1,Corey C.,"Houston, TX",208,110,121,4.0,7/24/2018,"The Terrace club is a convenient lounge and dinninbv establishment located just inside club quarters hotel on the seventh floor. We were able to grab a quick lunch consisting of delicious crabcake and well seasoned in prime beef burger.  Located minutes from Rockefeller Center and the train system I would highly recommend this location for a quick meeting or a quick meet and lunch opportunity. While the space itself is not big, we were able to grab a quick lunch and spend a few minutes working on interrupted on projects. The staff is very cordial and attentive to any business needs.",2,,
2,Lana T.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",11,9,3,3.0,5/15/2017,"Stayed at this hotel for a work trip. Smaller hotel but great location. Had lunch at their restaurant on the 6th floor. Nice lounge dining area and an outside patio. Amazing view of the city with a clear shot of radio city. There was plenty of seating on the weekday for lunch so I could sit near the edge. Food was alright but pricey. Service was so so, I had to find my waiter to grab my check so I could get back to work on time.",1,,
3,Michael T.,"Desert Center, CA",30,7,16,5.0,5/9/2016,"I am a Clubcorp member, so while visiting NYC I stopped in on the Terrace Club. And to my delight it was a wonderful choice! We enjoy the most amazing salmon burgers. The service was consistent with Clubcorp standards.",2,,
4,Mavis C.,"Miami, FL",96,6,0,1.0,8/16/2017,"Came here because my boyfriend and i were staying at the Jewels and we got 20% off our meal but it was definitely NOT worth the price. When we got there we had to practically look for the server because no one was there to greet us even though it was completely empty (only 2 other couples). Once we were seated we had to ask the waiter to bring us water 3 times because they hadn't even offered us any. Even though the food didn't take long, it was definitely not out of this world and we had eaten way better at way less expensive restaurant during our visit in NY. The waiter didn't even come by ONCE to see how our meal was going or if we needed anything extra, which in  my experience if youre getting 18% gratitude included you should at least do considering the fact that the restaurant was empty. If you're in NY definitely pass on this restaurant considering the fact that it's pricey yet you get better customer service at for example Buffalo Wild Wings.",2,,
5,Charles C.,"San Mateo, CA",125,142,18,4.0,12/28/2015,"I used to have a Club Quarters membership before moving to CA a few months ago. Overall the Terrace Club is well worth the money. Great service, great atmosphere, and just having a place to work from between meetings (both morning and evenings) is amazing. The view is a huge plus.As many mention in the reviews, the food isn't the best and for the price I'd dine elsewhere. The breakfast prices however are more than reasonable.My only major gripes with the Terrace Club are that it's probably faster to walk up the stairs than it is to wait for the elevators. The key card swipe in the elevators also gave me more trouble in a month than I've had with my MetroCard in a year.That being said, if you purchase a Terrace Club membership, splurge on the collection membership as having access to View of the World is well worth it.",2,,
6,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",757,900,1561,3.0,4/17/2014,"Came here early morning for a private breakfast event. There were two different experiences, the atmosphere/service and the food. The atmosphere/service is what would you expect for a place holding a private event for 20 people. Very professional, attentive and proactive. Serving and taking food/drink orders for 20 people during an in-progress meeting is no easy task... However they did it extremely well while not disturbing the flow of things.The food was a different story... I had an order of French toast topped with bananas and it tasted like it was first time someone made it. I took a few bites and that was enough for me. It looked delicious but the taste was a completely different story. I also heard the same from others who ordered this dish as well as others.Very nice place and great for an event, but definitely choose somewhere else to eat if you have the option.",,,
7,Patty G.,"Kendall Park, NJ",14,97,0,4.0,12/16/2016,"My company recently held their holiday party here. I noticed that the staff was very courteous  and was pleasantly surprised by the food (usually the food isn't that good at events like this).  They offered some nice vegetarian appetizers (grilled vegetables, guacamole, grilled eggplant which was very tasty, fried chickpea appetizer) and for the main course I had the ravioli with salad and broccoli. Staff members came over to us very frequently offering appetizers.   I see that a fish dish was offered and it looked nice but I didn't taste it.  There was plenty of seating.  I highly recommend this place for an event.",2,,
8,Jesseca T.,"Los Alamos, NM",128,493,72,3.0,2/14/2012,"Met my customer for breakfast here today. This is an excellent spot for a quiet meeting away from the morning hustle.  We ate outside where they have heat lamps in the ceiling and a view of St Patrick's Cathedral and Rock center (we could just barely see the Today show).Ambiance is understated elegance with an asian influence and an amazing orchid arrangement. There was a fire going, and food set up buffet-style. Lots of meat options, very little for veggies who aren't carb lovers. Thankfully, they had bagels, which is pretty much all I eat when I'm in NY 'cause I am starved for them the rest of the year. Good service, not sure on price since my partner is member.  Good coffee.",4,,
9,Josh M.,"Manhattan, NY",34,25,0,2.0,1/19/2014,"I was staying at a nearby hotel that had ads up all over for The Terrace Club, and offered guests a 20% discount. I checked Yelp and the reviews were OK so I figured I would give it a try for breakfast. The breakfast menu is really limited. I didn't like any of the options listed, so I went for the buffet. The buffet is also pretty limited with eggs, sausage, bacon, yogurt, some breads and a very small selection of fruit. For $16.99 I would have been better off getting a made-to-order meal at a nearby deli. The 20% discount was made moot because they added a 20% service charge.The only part of the meal that I really enjoyed was the ambience. The view was pretty, it was nicely decorated and the crowd was small. It might be a better choice later in the day, but I would not recommend the breakfast.",1,,
10,Dana H.,"Queens, NY",468,72,523,5.0,9/10/2014,This place is awesome for professional meetings. The manager MIRIAN is a sweetheart and makes sure every need is met. I've been a member here for a few years. I enjoy the view (of course!) the complimentary coffee and tea and the water station. It's great to meet for a drink after work too.,,,
11,Hala S.,"Alexandria, VA",23,105,38,5.0,9/25/2015,Had the green salad and soup... The food is outstanding and reasonably priced. I will definitely be coming back to this place...,,,
12,Kristia B.,"Brooklyn, NY",228,590,145,5.0,11/12/2013,"I loved the exclusivity of this restaurant. It was very quaint and quiet. You can tell it was a place for professionals and hotel guests to meet, relax and or enjoy a meal without all of the unnecessary chatter and noise of larger restaurants. I did not eat the food, only ordered a coffee. Neat restrooms too.",,,
13,Maria T.,"Bristol, CT",74,189,64,4.0,4/21/2013,"Having a somewhat bad experience at the hotel (Club Quarters - 7th Floor), I was pleasantly surprised with their restaurant.  The food was great and the staff were delightful.  A plus, we had the whole place to ourselves!",1,,
14,Chelsey P.,"New York, NY",52,83,247,4.0,10/11/2015,"The Terrace Club is a good place for a business lunch or coffee meeting. Often crowded during business hours. The service is slow most of time, but friendly. The lunch and dinner menus are limited. The terrace is beautiful with a view of radio city, St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rock Center. They have a decent happy hour with $5-$7 specials. When it is not happy hour though, drinks and wine can be on the pricey side ($12 and up). They take good care of their members offering complimentary snacks all day, $3 daily breakfast, open houses twice a year with complimentary apps, wine and beer. Members also receive hotel discounts. Overall it is a nice place.",1,,
15,Philip S.,"Seattle, WA",17,733,2,4.0,10/4/2012,Business meeting here on 03 October. Attentive staff. Acceptable coffee. Perfect NY club feel.,,,
16,Amber E.,"San Diego, CA",697,1604,2424,4.0,8/24/2012,"I was staying next door at the Jewel w/ privileges at Terrace Club, so ended up coming here 3 times over the course of a week w/ clients and colleagues, and reallly enjoyed it.  They have a nice outdoor terrace w/ views of Rockefeller Plaza and St. Patrick's church (which is mostly covered in scaffolding right now).  It's not too loud to conduct some business, and there are an assortment of standard tables, and more comfortable leather chairs w/ coffee tables.  Food was very good (liked the shrimp/mango salad and the arugula watermelon salad; very interesting), w/ nice selection and fairly reasonable prices (especially w/ the Jewel 20% discount on food), and they have happy hour drink specials 4-7. I would definitely return when I'm in NY on business.",2,,
17,Michael H.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",0,13,0,3.0,10/8/2013,"The restaurant is small, clean, and has decent food and the happy hour drinks are cheap. Having said that, the menu isn't too interesting and neither is the food. For the price, there are many other restaurants nearby much more interesting and deserving, so in my opinion, this isn't one worth going to",,,
18,Susanna C.,"Long Island City, NY",1,62,0,4.0,9/1/2011,"This restaurant is on the 7th floor terrace of the Club Quarters hotel.  You have to be a member to come here.  There is seating indoors and outdoors.  Outdoors is really great -- you have a view of  Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral and Radio City Music Hall.  We came for dinner and it emptied out by 9pm.  Food was good -- though my salmon was a tad overcooked, my warm apple tart was really yummy.   I'd definitely come back here for drinks and dinner again.",4,,
19,Jeannette A.,"Raleigh, NC",323,162,7,4.0,1/14/2013,"met some clients here the other morning, and i stayed back after they took leave and had some lunch. the lamb was delicious and the service was quite attentive. a bit expensive, and i was very disappointed to find that 2 outlets that i attempted to charge my laptop on didn't work. dead battery, but full tummy.",2,1,
20,H. P.,"Liberty Park, NJ",0,58,0,4.0,12/17/2013,Great view of the tree at Rockefeller Center from the terrace.  Had lunch on a Saturday and thought the food and service were good.  Great location within walking distance to theatre district.,,,
21,Brenda F.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,5/7/2013,"I had such a great experience staying at the hotel for a few days. Even more of a pleasant experience was the private terrace club and restaurant in the hotel. Service was attentive and polite. The manager Miriam was so delightful and made me feel so welcome, I wanted to become a member instantly!  My clients were very impressed by her professionalism, stellar service, and pleasant nature. Food was outstanding and the restaurant was impeccable. There was also an outdoor area that is such a rarity and special feature to have in NYC. What an AMAZING view, and the added touches of flowers and decor really made it charming. Highly recommended. Its a jewel to find right in the heart of Rockerfeller Center. I WILL BE BACK and can't wait to entertain here with family and friends. I would put this on the top 10 things to do in NY. The terrace's club view is NOT to be missed!",1,,
