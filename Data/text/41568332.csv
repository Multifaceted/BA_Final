0,Rebecca C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",25,17,8,4.0,5/3/2018,Found this cool dive bar while going to see my friend in Spanish Harlem. They have cheap drinks available ranging from about $3 to $4. We walked in on a Saturday evening and found a few empty seats by the bar. We were attended to right away and I ordered a PBR while my friend had a Coors.Looking around I noticed the lighting was a bit darker than usual. The good news is that the unisex bathroom was very clean. Don't forget to lock the door while you're in there. The crowd was chill and it seemed comprised of locals. This who weren't ordering at the bar were sharing drinks on the tables or playing pool in the back on their coin operated machine.The bartender was really nice and helpful and took care of us the whole night. But beware this place is cash only. If you try and pay with a credit card you will be disappointed. You'll have to pay ATM fees to withdraw cash.,2,,
1,Syl G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,3/22/2018,"Cheapest drinks in manhattan. Country music at absurd levels. Cash only keeps the Jabronis out. Prolonged eye contact with any of the other patrons will lead to a fight, weird dumpster sex, and/or a long conversation about absolutely nothing.Fantastic date spot! love this place.",2,2,

Whether it's enjoying an $8 double vodka soda or a $20 bucket of coronas, this place always delivers on the good times. Awesome music selection on the jukebox, billiards, and even a dartboard keep patrons entertained for hours. Not to mention the fun pinup art hidden around the place! Definitely a cool spot to check out if you are looking for and unpretentious bar to just kick back and watch a game or something.",2,,

5,Andy S.,"Atlanta, GA",162,101,246,3.0,6/5/2017,"The definition of hole in the wall -- more like hole in the basement. Super dark place. Great beers but somewhat expensive with no deals. Bathroom is the typical dirty gas station look, just make sure you don't drop anything on the floor-- pretty sure that's not water on the ground. Would give a better rating if they cleaned the bathroom and cleaned the beer glasses better.",,,

There is really nothing left to say.But, of course, this is yelp so....Walk in and pretend that you are blind. Walk as far back as possible and, still yet pretending to be blind, find yourself a spot to sit. Don't touch anything, don't look too hard and be forewarned if you make too much eye contact with anyone you may be asking for a date you had not planned on. Sketch does not do this place justice. However,  if you're looking for a random night of randomness and don't really care about where you may end up...go to the duck.  If I ever return it's because I've hit the lowest of the low or because I have a death wish. Not my kinda digs but two stars because the drinks are cheap but strong.",14,11,10

Updated review",This is hands down the best joint in Harlem love our new family here at the Duck Fantastic service and always a friendly atmosphere highly recommend stopping in...say hello for me!,,,
9,John D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,3/27/2018,"Went there Sunday night to meet friends after 12 midnight only to be greeted by some Crotchety Old Hag behind the bar. I asked inquisitively where everyone else was since the place was completely empty. It proceeded to give me a stare, and with a falsely painted smile on her face asked ""What are you drinking?"". I repeated my question as I thought the tones of my voice were lost in the high volume of blaring country music. The response was the same with the exception of the volume and timbre of the hideous creature's voice was noticeably elevated. Now understanding it's response was completely extraneous to my initial questioning, I proceeded to ask a third time since I've mastered the art of New York communication skills. Not even 1 second after my third attempt at deriving the answer to my question was delivered, The Heinous Bag of Flesh then spewed forth it's venom and began howling and squealing unpleasantries focused in my direction. I replied ""You should have then said these things from the beginning"". The answer to the empty bar was now apparent.I finished my cheap beer, paid my two dollars and fifty cents, and proceeded to call all 12 of my friends to let them know that we were not going to meet at The Duck. We all easily found another spot to meet up where the bartender was welcoming and knowledgable on all sorts of alcoholic concoctions.If The Duck indeed wants to succeed as an ongoing neighborhood dive bar my recommendation would be ""Trash the Troll"".Sincerely,John",,,
10,Brent J.,"Pensacola, FL",1,4,0,3.0,7/29/2017,"Don't be fooled by the door with a sign that says the Duck above it. The real entrance is a half a block away, and you enter through a bar that is no longer in service. (When you enter the official bar, you realize the door you can't enter would bring you in the front of the bar.)Smells like a musty basement in the Midwest. And the bathroom door doesn't lock. The only redeeming quality was $2.50 PBRs",,,
11,Eric T.,"Viroqua, WI",303,26,26,4.0,5/29/2016,The bras are history. Sorry. The decor remains eclectic and odd in a non-contrived way. Ditto for the clientele. Come in and see one of the most bizarre DIY speaker enclosures ever conceived. I guess the guy wasn't happy with an off the rack Bose. This place is the real deal. No Edison bulbs and reclaimed wood here.The jukebox is shit and plays horrible modern country by default. Put your money in and god knows what happens to it.  How do you rate a place like this? It's a mess. It's cool because it's a mess and it sucks because it's a mess.,2,3,2
12,Sasha G.,"New York, NY",600,553,333,4.0,11/11/2015,"Seems a bit blasphemous to review a dive, like why? But that's what yelp is about! Definitely a dive, the signs are clear. -dingy -dark -affordable -dated furniture-slight stench Dives aren't for everyone but this being the only one in a 2 mile radius it's certainly great! Besides, cheap drinks in East Harlem? Why not? Also, there's a pool table if that's your thing and if some loud, slightly creepy dudes haven't taken over already! Been here with a group- wouldn't come solo but that's just me. Go alone... If you dare!",6,3,4
13,Lacey D.,"New York, NY",35,29,0,2.0,7/26/2017,"Such a weird experience as it took me awhile to come to the corner of our avenue for a dive bar drink. I was having a great time until we put over $10 in the Juke Box with only 2-4 songs working and Ming at the duck blamed it on us not knowing how to work it. Obviously some of your selection doesn't work but they just roll their eyes . It could be a great environment even if the juke box and drinks are limited but they don't give a f-- about you so deal!

17,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3287,12703,4.0,7/16/2012,"Words just can't describe my new found love for this craptacular bar! I mean, it has a freaking toilet as it's profile picture. How can you not love a dive bar that gives new meaning to what a dive is supposed to be about? Oddly unique yet you feel afraid for your safety just a bit, but still drawn to it like a drug addict trapped in a crack house.Um, what is this dark weird little fake bar before a bar that you have to pass through to get to The Duck? Is this a dive speakeasy kind of thing? Some beefy dude at the door checks your ID and lets you in. Then it hits you when you walk in. What is this wonderful place that looks like a hospital or insane asylum basement dorm room decorated in the most makeshift way? It's almost as if a bunch of drunk college kids watched Animal House and decided to make mom and dad's basement a dive bar with crap they found on the side of the road or in a dumpster. There are wires, cables, extension cords, and surge protectors hanging all over the place. One short and the place goes up in a burst of flame! Beer signage, strange memorabilia, and old discarded bras hang on the wall and ceiling. A few tables and chairs to sit at next to the bar. A pool table in front of a large projection flat screen from 1990. Strange mix of locals, some tourists, and even a tv celebrity hanging out pounding down the drinks. I felt like we were in some surreal reality show. And why the heck is there country music playing in here? Good lord! I am falling in love! Where is Anthony Bourdain when you need him? Surely, he would feel at home here. He loves these bars.Amazing and cute Asian girl named CiCi mans the bar and as soon as our group walks in offers up the ladies a free round of shots. Sorry guys, you get nothing as you have the wrong equipment. No biggie, as this has to be one of the most cheapest bars I have ever encountered. Tap beers are $3-$4. Bass, Blue Moon, Bud, Bud Light, Yuengling, Coors Light, and Patriot. Bottles and cans start at $2.75. Pitchers at $6.50. It's just so cheap it's obscene! I think at happy hour they pay you to drink. We did a few rounds of shots and she was offering them up at super cheap prices. This is the bar to go to on a budget. It's the kind of place where the odd ""people of Wal-Mart"" hang out at. Loooooove it!OK - now for more trashiness. The top of the toilet in the men's room is made of duct tape. Yup.Epic crappiest dive bar in the Barrio! And it's up in my neck of the woods! I am so glad me and my friends are so low-brow that we freakin' love this place! I love a good crappy dive bar!",11,17,12

19,Evelyn A.,"Toronto, Canada",3031,1279,1414,4.0,5/1/2014,"The Duck. Best name. A faux arcade covering up a dive bar in the back? If I were a celebrity and I wanted to hide from the the paps (and money hadn't changed me), this would be my favourite place in the world. Cheap beer, cheap drinks, it's cheap street up in here, and the staff are fast talking, fabulous folks. The only issue is that I wanted to take a cab back downtown, so like the evening wasn't really that cheap, but tipsy Pepper doesn't like to walk, so it is what it is. Don't be me, take the subway or walk. But probably subway because East Harlem at night is still a bit sketchy. I'm digressing... Just go here.",6,3,3
20,Kristy R.,"New York, NY",412,1515,173,4.0,7/15/2012,"Okay, let me begin this review by saying I was very confused when we first walked in.  I was already intoxicated so it was not nice that when you first enter The Duck, you're in a ""fake bar"".  There is a bar to the side with no alcohol, tables, and a bouncer.  The bouncer checks your ID then you mosey on into the actual bar, which is a shit hole.  But it's a good shit hole.  It's the clean portapotty you hope and pray for during a music festival in 90 degree weather.There are wires EVERYWHERE!  Surge protectors hang off the walls with wires hanging out of them.  There is an average size bar and a few tables here and there.  There is also a pool table in the back with some interesting decor above it.  Eff that, the entire place has interesting decor!  There is a bra collection hanging over the bar, but the ladies of the group were all wearing expensive undergarments so you won't see ours up there....Sorry, gentlemen.  Our bartender CiCi was awesome!  She gave all the ladies free shots.  She also said if we danced on the bar, we would get another free shot.  Unfortunately, I don't think any of us were up to the challenge last night.  The beers are also ridiculously cheap.  On average, a beer will run you $4.50 and that's NOT during happy hour.  $1 beers during happy hour ;)Come here to get drunk for cheap and possibly donate your bra.  This place gets 4 stars alone because of how fabulously crappy it is.  I love me a fabulous dive bar.",2,3,3

Updated review","Updating my review with a lower reading to keep the hipsters away. This is not a ""dive bar,"" hipsters! It's a real dive with bad lighting, bathrooms that don't work, a jukebox that ONLY plays country and a mean owner. Stay away!",,,
22,Edgar B.,"New York, NY",0,56,0,4.0,1/23/2017,"This is a nice old-school dive bar in Spanish Harlem. They have a modestly stocked array of liquors and a small selection of drafts and a few cans and bottles--none of which are my usual faves but I just like the place because it's fun. You're likely to strike up a conversation with one of the ""interesting"" characters sitting next to you. One guy hit on my wife (unsuccessfully haha). Generally speaking, patrons are friendly. Decent but ornery jukebox. Seems like the same bartender is always there whenever we go and she's super nice. There's about a 0.001% chance you'll run into douchebags here and hopefully it'll stay that way for a long time. The layout is weird ... keep going if you enter from Lexington; the real bar's in the back.",,,

28,Jeff B.,"Bronx, NY",110,325,21,4.0,4/16/2015,"My kind of place, an unpretentious actual dive bar with actual cheap beer. The bartenders drink with you. The fact that they're able to charge so little for pitchers and stay open in this city makes me kind of resent all the other bars out there pocketing insane profits. The bartenders here are talkative and friendly, which makes it a neat place to go and people-watch even if you're not going with anyone. At one point a drunken, middle-aged Caribbean lady was blatantly hitting on me, stole my seat, and kissed me on the cheek, if that gives you any idea of the kind of place this is. I kind of wish I did bring a friend with me so that we could play pool, foosball, and the other coin-op games together, but the word-of-mouth on The Duck seemed strong enough for me to want to visit regardless, and I definitely don't regret it. I intend to return and also to check out the Patriot Bar in Lower Manhattan, which apparently shares ownership and bartenders with The Duck.",6,1,3
29,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1307,2655,3.0,2/16/2014,"So I found myself way uptown on a Saturday night in some seriously shitty weather for a friends birthday party. Let it never be said that I don't rally. After the festivities died down at her place we all decided to go the only dive in the area. We were shocked to find this little gem.A bouncer stands alone in what appears to be an empty bar. I didn't quite understand what was happening, so I handed him my ID and proceeded to go further into the building where I see another bar, this one with actual people. Me and friends grabbed some seats and put our coats on a random empty seat next to the jukebox that had no CD's in it. The bartender said it had held mainly country, so truth be told I wasn't too heartbroken to find it out of order. Instead the bar was playing some sad, soft rock in the background. Over the course of about 2 hours I was only able to identify two songs: one by James Brown and Beast of Burden. Our bartender was nice and friendly (wish I could remember her name). They've got TV's and usable bathrooms. Not the strongest drinks but dirt cheap ($4 for a rum and coke). Then some guy started rummaging through our coat pockets. My friend flipped on him and I rushed to her defense...long story short I either heroically helped retrieve stolen merchandise from a pick pocket or mugged a total stranger. Pretty sure it was the former. Either way, the evening went on as usual though we held our coats in our laps for the rest of the night. The particular night I went most of the people there seemed vaguely creepy and a mite desperate. It could be the usual or just the combination of a full moon during a snow storm. I'd come back if I found myself in the area again, but I wouldn't come out of my way to drink here.",1,,
30,Shiv C.,"Newark, NJ",109,36,2,4.0,4/9/2015,"This is your prototypical dive bar.  My sister was moving in close to this place and I was waiting for her to bring her stuff so I decided to try this place.  Usually, I have a no drinking alone policy, but I figured to break the rule once and have a beer.The inside is very spacious, with one long bar with a friendly bartender, a couple of tables and a pool table.  The ambiance is dark and grungy which is perfect for a dive bar.They have a decent (not great) selection of beers.  All-in-all, its a nice place to try if you're in the area.",2,2,2

It's right off the 6, note that because if I weren't so hollowly impatient we should've taken that.

R and I happen to live around the corner from The Duck, and since we moved in, we've been intrigued. I mean, what part of a sign that says, ""$1 beers before 8pm"" isn't intriguing? Seriously. So we finally went this past Saturday night to see what was what.We were 2 of 10 in the bar, from which some would interpret that the bar was a total dead zone. Au contraire. That's actually the perfect ratio in a place like this. It's like, why parents like small class sizes: individualized attention, and the bartendress was our teacher of sorts. She was awesome! Nikki, I believe her name was. After we had seat at the bar, she explained what beers there were on tap and in bottles, and even tested out the fritzy soda machine thingy by having another patron take shots of what came out when she pressed each button (he said the Coke tasted like clear, ""carbonated...Yoohoo."" She said she'd have it fixed). Even after all that, I settled on a $3 Bud Light -- because it was $3. R just had a soda, which was like, $1. So, we had a Saturday night out for $4. In New York City. I wanted to cry, I was so happy. Further intrigued, I asked, ""How much is the liquor?"" The most expensive, Nikki guessed, would be about $5.75. ...Say, so a Johnnie Red & ginger would be less than $6???? ""Is this place profitable?"" I asked. She nodded and laughed. ""Gosh,"" I breathed, ""I could actually afford to have an alcohol problem here.""And there you have it, folks. Cheap drinks, nice country music playing (probably would have been something else if the CDs hadn't been stolen from the jukebox. What kind of douche steals CDs from a jukebox? Then I remembered we live in the 'hood. Things happen, I guess.), and a great bartendress. And bar games! What more could you ask?Actually, I do ask that not too many of you come.

I just laughed.  The one upside is that the drinks are cheap, $2 PBRs and $6.75 Top shelf. For a modest amount me and a few of my friends got banged up. A heck of a deal. And they have a few good TVs if you want to watch the game.On the same street is a good Indian restaurant which is open really late and a Kennedy Fried Chicken (ghetto KFC) which are great options for that late after drink meal on your way home.",,1,

This, in addition to the friendly bar staff, Midwestern-cheap drinks ($2.75 cans of coors light, $8 Patron, $6 pitchers, and frozen drink machines), $1 pool table with extra challenging bump in the middle, ample space, lack of a douchey crowd, and wacky country soundtrack, all combine to create a happy corner of the world I have found my way to three times in the two weeks since discovering it. Last time I went I figured out this place occupies the old Dexy's space - some good mojo must have been left behind when they vacated.

But that's almost never open. You have to go in the rear (::insert joke here::) to get to the primary bar, which is a cross between Mike O's East Village-esque observations with a little bit of that fratty NYU area thrown in for good measure. People at one point might have been playing beer pong. Or maybe they were just talking about it. This does seem like the place this would happen.Anyway, I ended up FINALLY coming here because this redhead kid who wanted to take me out a date suggested it. Totally NOT gay, people, so it was a terrible suggestion, but it ended up being an okay time. There are rubber ducks and pictures of ducks everywhere, and I do enjoy a theme. The bartendress was young, cute, and perky in all the right places.

We couldn't get over the decor - random beer memorabilia on the table, wires everywhere, bras hanging over the bar. The cute waitress, Cici, decided us ladies needed a shot on the house and well....we couldn't say no! The place has a decent choice of the usual domestic beers and to my pleasure, even Woodchuck Pear Cider. $4.50 for cider is damn cheap!

Overall okay but not anything special, had some fun but not as fun as other places. The second time on a Friday that same week, beers were still cheap but the crowd was terrible.  I got hit on by every dude there, like creepily uncomfortable hit on. Then nice girl I've been talking to asks to go to bathroom withe me, so I go. She then snorts cocaine in the bathroom and tries to get me to do it too. The. She tells me she's gay and proceeds to try and make out with me. I stopped her but god damn was it terrible.  So overall if you're a girl go with a boy and at least say he's your bf otherwise be prepared to be creeped out, if on weekends.

Dark, dirty, bras hanging from a very low ceiling, which were actually slapping my head.Despite a somewhat shady area, the bartenders were very friendly, and the crowd was even friendlier.

My friend lives in this neighborhood and I have never hung out in Harlem before, so she took me on a little tour of places near her house. We Yelped The Duck, and when I read that it had country music and cheap drinks, I was sold. Yes, there is country music - we heard both Brooks and Dunn's ""Neon Moon"" and Alan Jackson's ""Little Bitty,"" along with a host of other not-contemporary country favourites (that I grew up with!). PBR is $2 and shots are cheap. This definitely seems like someone's basement rather than a bar, and because of that, I am in love. Did I mention that there were bras hanging from the ceiling? I'll post the picture that I took. I desperately want to take my cousin here, because she grew up with me and the same trashy, dive, country music culture.

I could guarantee, as someone who's done security for large scale events and parties, i could do a better job in a heartbeat. And the owner...well...what could we say about the owner...he's negligent. About everything. I don't think he cares at all about the customer experience. He's had this place for a number of years. He doesn't care about the money. It's obvious. If he changed a lot of things about this place, he would make even more money...from me and everyone else I know.

I was completely confused about this situation and wanted to turn around and walk out but the bouncer sitting on a stool in the middle of the empty room told us to go through the hallway. (Yea I thought that was a bit creepy too)I got quacked from behind by some random dude... I don't know if that was a compliment or a ""get out of my way"" quack. Like I said this was a random place.But when we got into the bar area, it was sparsely sprinkled with people. Three guys at a table drinking to a card game, a few people at the bar, and a pool table in the back. The place was actually quite lit especially for a bar; I was able to see the guy that was talking to me... I don't know if I prefer that or not...The bartender was so excited and bubbly; she quickly greeted us with a big ""Hey Guys!!"" Drinks are extremely cheap $3 for a draft beer and $4 for a well drink. I can't complain about that! The decor is well.... it's a dive bar what can you expect.And the bathrooms.... it's call the duck cause you should squat to go to the bathroom, ladies don't sit on that toilet!!!I would give this bar a 2, but it's a dive bar, your standards have to be adjusted.

86,Lana C.,"Lodi, NJ",3,7,0,4.0,4/7/2009,"This bar is awesome!  The owner of this is the same guy who owned Yogi's on the Upper West Side.  If you were distraught (like I was) when it closed you may want to check this place out.  Even if you're not a huge country music fan it's got a great atmosphere and the potential to get better and better with time.  Friendly, hot bartenders,  cheap, strong drinks, a pool table, a small front area and bar but walk to the back and there's an even bigger bar with tons of seating.  I don't know who's gonna haul themselves all the way up to Spanish Harlem but I'm hoping with time more and more people will discover this place.  It's not fratty, not full of upper east side yuppies either-just regular folks who want to hang out and party.  There's a fire station next door too and I hear all the firemen come in from time to time.  It's not a bar for everybody but that's the point.  Bottom line:  If you like badass bartenders, cheap drinks and dive bars this is your place.Um, in response to Charles W-I don't think this bar was meant to be for ""everyone.""  Just as Yogi's wasn't meant for everyone.  People who appreciate a certain ""scene"" will venture wherever that scene is.  I thought the bartenders were both sweet, sexy and pretty badass.  It's true there aren't a lot of people in there but it takes bars a while to catch on.  Also, I'm sick of bars that play frat boy rap so a country bar is perfect for me, and tons of people like me (the same people who packed Yogi's every night).  And I don't know who you think is staff on here?  Me and 2 dudes are the only ones who wrote good reviews and I assure you I don't work there-though I kinda wish I did :)",1,,

Updated review","I recently had the chance to stop by since they re-opened.  The positive things I can say about this place are that they are still using the same jukebox that they once had at Yogi's (great country music jukebox) and the drinks are cheap.  However, the energy level here is NOTHING like The Patriot or Cheap Shots (the two other bars owned by the same owner as The Duck).  The Duck is basically a great neighborhood bar for those who live nearby and don't want to pay too much for their drinks.  However, for someone like me who lives in NJ, it's simply NOT worth the trip all the way up there since it's simply a no thrills bar.  One change that took place since they re-opened is that the front bar is no longer in use.  When you first walk in, you have to walk around the corner to get to the main (back bar).  I heard that they're going to change the front bar into an arcade area.  The ONLY time I heard The Duck being busy was on opening night.  I think the only time it would be worth taking the trip up there is if they have a special theme night or event, that will lure more people from the downtown area.  For me, I'd rather stick with the Patriot and Cheap Shots since those bars are much closer to me and also have a more lively atmosphere.  I DO hope they keep The Duck opened though because it is a great bar for those who live in the area.  And NO, even though it's called The Duck in spanish harlem, it's NOT a gay bar by any means!!!!",1,1,
88,Michael S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,30,3,2.0,2/21/2009,I stopped by one evening for some drinks and experienced nothing but weird vibes and weird people. I'd have preferred to battle a crowd of maniac frat boys with popped collars than to deal with these folks. What's the deal?,1,,
89,Boris C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,6,3.0,5/30/2011,"Well, beggars can't be choosers. ""The DUCK"" is pretty much the only bar in the immediate region, especially if you can't stand the loud salsa music in RICKS restaurant down the block which does furnish a small cramp bar near the entrance. If your looking to drink after 2AM,  it's pretty much is the only watering hole around.  The country music only  juke box  will start grow on you after your third  $2 PBR and the haggard looking  bartenders will start to look better . Don't miss the loner long gray haired gentlemen in a casual dark suit that seems to the official Bar Fly resident.  The bar does  have a authentic feel of not trying to impress anybody, people go to the Duck here to get drunk alone or with friends.  No lower Manhattan artist pretense here, no posturing to come across  as a super successful Wall Street stock broker or a fashion designer, just cheap drinks , with real locals.",,1,
90,Clark T.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,1/15/2009,Finally!  A great bar in East Harlem.  But don't let the location hold you back - the drinks are cheap enough to travel for!  The place is huge and great for group meet-ups and parties and you can order food in with no problems.  A pitcher of light beer is cheaper than a pint in most places.  Check it out - you won't be sorry!!!,,1,1
91,levi f.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,4.0,6/25/2009,"The reason the bar doesn't get 5 stars is because, as others have pointed out, the country music is always BLARING.  I love a good Charlie Daniels song, but not so loud that I have to scream at the bartender for another beer - especially when I'm the only one there.  And the TV selection is god-awful.  They wouldn't put on election returns last November.Tone down the music and this place would be near-perfect (decor doesn't matter when the beer is so cheap).Now, maybe a country and western theme isn't the right approach to a bar in east Harlem, but it seems to be working.  Dexy's (the bar that used to exist in this space) went out of business because, my theory is, they were trying to be too ""hip.""  That being said, minus The Duck, what are the other options for dirt cheap drinks in the area? The bar in the chicken restaurant El Nuevo Ciudad?  El Rinconcito?  Mi Abuelita? The last two places have music so loud it hurts my ears when I walk past on the other side of the street.  La Camaradas has a great happy hour, but then a DJ sets up and it gets pricey.The Duck doesn't get a lot of business, so bartenders are usually pretty friendly - they're excited when anyone comes in.  They have a pool table, a pinball machine, and cheap beer.  What more do you want?  It's not ideal, but you'll still find me in the back nursing a $6 pitcher of PBR until something better comes along.",,,
