0,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",848,3176,11053,5.0,11/19/2018,"Alright, my 5 star review has one big caveat - I went on a Tuesday night, presumably during finals week and with no big games going on.I imagine this place is packed with drunk NYU kids on the weekends. And I guess for brunch.That said, this place is awesome. Their theme is bacon (duh), so you can get flights of bacon infused liquor, bacon Bloody Mary's or Old Fashioned's, bacon bites, bacon + beer flight pairings, or just straight up bacon.We did their bacon tasting flight. It was four styles - pecan (normal), maple, black pepper, and jalapeno. The last two were my favorite, mostly because I love spicy. The jalapeno really had a kick to it. 8 slices to our order (2 of each).We were looking at the menu and said aloud that we should've gotten their fried bacon bites. John the bartender heard us, and said we were in luck because they were actually giving out free samples of that all night! Amazing! Hot and crispy, atop a honey dip, with pickles on the side. Something I noticed was that each of our samples had a sour pickle chip, and a sweet one. They really didn't have to do that and most people would've have noticed, but that extra mile doesn't go unappreciated.For drinks, the bacon Old Fashioned is pretty damn good. Also tried the Bloody Mary, which used a nice mix and had a bit of a kick to it (just the way I like it). They also have 3 sets of taps, and pretty good beers for the most part. Most draft beers run $7-9 (for some reason Stella was one of the more expensive ones).The bathroom is downstairs and is a winding maze (easy to find, just takes a while). Be careful when getting to the bottom of the stairs, cuz the kitchen is right there. Almost ran into servers twice, but they're probably used to it by now.Of course, this place also has a shit ton of TVs. They had every single game on.And if you're into real life games, they do beer pong and cornhole Tuesdays. Cuz y'know, college.",,,
1,Kendra C.,"New York, NY",51,171,469,4.0,11/16/2018,"It's all in the name. So if you're vegetarian or don't eat pork, this probably isn't the best place for you. However, if you're like many people and like all things bacon/pork, highly recommend to give this place a tryThey've got 4 different types of bacon, the real crispy kind. You can buy it by flight too. They've got bacon infused whiskey, that guy can drink as is or even baked into their cornbread. For those who may not like the crispy version, you can get pork belly. The bbq one was absolutely delicious. You can also get it on tacos. If you're done with pork but not done with this place, they have chicken and fish tacos too. This place is a must see for its uniqueness and most of all it's deliciousness",,,
2,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,4.0,11/12/2018,"Large space filled with many TVs for games etc. The service is very friendly and quick (for a catered event). I had the pleasure of trying an assortment of their food-4 different drinks using vodka, bourbon, tequila. Their chicken tacos, kale salad, simmered pork, fried pork ""nuggets"", and dessert bacon, including the bacon cannoli. I love how creative they were. Some things were knockouts while some I'd skip. The chicken tacos felt standard, but the portion was generous and still enjoyable. Kale salad: great break from the heavy heavy. It was delicious! Cornbread: I thought it was too dry. Would be great if they added corn kernels!Bacon ""nuggets"": I have no clue what these are actually called, but they're dynamite!! A must order. They definitely stole the show. Simmered bacon: this was good too. Chicarrones with guacamole: I prefer my chicarrones to have more meat on them. I personally would skip. Bacon desserts- their bacon chocolate was creative but not my favorite. It was dipped in either white or dark chocolate and had pink peppercorn sprinkled on top. Bacon cannoli: so creative. It was odd, but I'm a weirdly satisfying way. Overall, is say this location is worth a visit! Get. The. Nuggets!!",1,,
3,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",229,142,835,4.0,11/7/2018,"I came here for a Yelp event. And as expected, they were vultures. This was my first event and I respected the camera eats first rule. I guess that meant I don't get to eat at all since there was nothing left after I waited. No one cared who was first. It was like the Sea Gulls in Finding Nemo. Mine mine mine mine. This place is great overall. What makes it is the staff. I stayed back and enjoyed it all. Let's be honest bacon is great. And bacon is bacon. Speak to the staff. That's your gold.",3,2,
4,Ange C.,"Staten Island, NY",166,128,211,5.0,11/7/2018,"This review is from a private event! This space is much more spacious than their original location in Hell's Kitchen, not as loud or clunky! There's a lot going on in the space- flat screen TVs everywhere. I had the chance to meet the creator and owner of BarBacon. Concept for BarBacon was to ""introduce bacon in a different way... and show that Americans do bacon better than everyone else!"" Agreed*****Things that I tried:Pecan Bacon- crunchy and slightly sweetMaple Bacon - salty and sweetPepper Bacon- smoky and salty Jalapeño Bacon - slight spicy nessBloody Mary habanero - no lie, there's a kick! And it's refreshing. Old fashioned with bacon infused bourbonMushroom (??) taco- delicious with crunchy onions. Guac and pork rinds- I see what they were trying to do, but I think they could've also tried crunchy bacon (similar to plantain chips) to deliver guac into my mouth. Kale salad- I forgot there was bacon until I happily chomped on a piece of pork belly. Nicely compliments with the green apple and goat cheese. ****Got here at around 6PM- happy hour is from 4-8PM. It's a sports bar, but it has more of a chill/hip vibe. In other words, there is something for most everybody.",1,,
5,Allie R.,"New York, NY",302,99,19,5.0,9/29/2018,"Me and a few friends stumbled upon this place by accident on a Saturday afternoon and let me tell you I'm in love. Our waitress was very helpful and the owner came over and spoke with us a few times - she even brought out corn bread for us to try!The premise is simple - bacon and burbon. They have a lot of signature cocktails as well as snacks and entrees featuring bacon. They have recently introduced a late night brunch menu which I will be coming back to try ASAP. Being here, you can tell the employees and owner genuinely care about the guest experience and I really appreciate that.",3,,1
6,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",76,203,400,3.0,9/25/2018,"I've never been to the Hell's Kitchen location but this location was very nice. My friend and I tried the bacon sampler, beer flight and grilled cheese with roasted tomato eggplant soup. The draft beer flights were decent but sort of expensive for its quality/limited selection. The bacon was not overly salty and flavored nicely in house. I subbed the grilled cheese bread with rye and it tasted average. There was plenty of crispy bacon though. The tomato eggplant soup was nothing special. I wouldn't recommend. Service and ambiance was great. I would return for happy hour.",1,1,1
7,Nell d.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,59,59,5.0,11/17/2018,As a lover of bacon I loved  this place. All things bacon just excites me. Sunshine; our waitress was amazing as well. I ordered their award winning Kentucky Fried Bacon bites they were soooo good. The manager had came around and offered a sample and i changed my order immediately to that. We also had the candied fennel bacon flatbread dish that was good as well. The tasting was also good. My favorite was the smokey one. I will definitely be returning,,,
8,Rachelle L.,"Manhattan, NY",18,8,19,5.0,10/7/2018,"HOLY F@CKB@LLZ THE LAMB REUBEN!!!actually... everything is amazing!I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Brett was a great waiter and helped us pick excellent food (did I mention the Reuben?

It's a nice place to bring friends to eat, drink and just have a fun time And when I tell you the food is amazing I'm not kidding :) this place won't disappoint Barbacon keep up the good work!!Ps They also have cool bacon shirts!!!",,,
11,Alyssa H.,"New York, NY",1,6,3,4.0,11/10/2018,"I'd been excited about coming here since I saw that they were setting up shop here months ago. (I'd known about the Hells Kitchen location but never made it there.) A friend and I finally went on this Thursday night, following seeing a show at the Vineyard Theatre.Overall, the food and drinks were delicious and worth returning for, but the service, while warm, was very disorganized.  When we arrived, we were quickly seated and given food menus, but not drink menus (which my friend noticed existed due to seeing one sitting on another table when she got up to look at the specials board). The owner herself came over to greet us and thank us for trying them out, and we were each given a complimentary piece of their Kentucky fried bacon with pickles -- delicious! We ordered drinks, and then our server quickly departed before we could put in our food order as well.The drinks were very good: the BarBacon Old Fashioned and the Hogstorm. The old fashioned was extremely sweet, might have been too much so in other situations, but the bacon that came with it was a great contrast and they set each other off nicely. The Hogstorm was very much not what I usually drink, but I enjoyed it, even if reconciling my mental knowledge of the individual ingredients and what my mouth was telling me left me a little confused for a while -- everything came together into something that honestly tasted like a cider.We got the bacon tasting and the pulled pork mac & cheese to share. Our dishes came in reasonable time... although I did not receive any silverware with it. (There had only been one napkin/silverware set on the table when we were sat there.) I was able to flag a server down to ask for silver, which I was brought... but then needed to flag her down again to ask for a napkin, which resulted us in being brought a small stack of cocktail napkins. (Which worked well enough but just struck me as a little funny.)As mentioned, the food was very good. I wish I could tell you more about the bacon, but the tasting was just sat down in front of us without any explanation of what they were. (We think that it was plain, pepper, maple, and some kind of spicy. The maple was notable for being thankfully not overly sweet/sugary. The spicy one was our favorite overall.) The mac & cheese was also delicious, with perfectly cooked pasta doused in a generous but not overwhelming amount of cheese, topped with a heap of pulled pork and light bacon lardons.When our plates were empty, the server came by to ask if we were finished, and we said yes. The plates were taken away... but no check came. We eventually were able to flag the server down to get that. The total of about $36 per person felt reasonable for a cocktail and a satisfying amount of food right by Union Square.The place has a fun vibe with great decor... but the creative decorations seemed oddly juxtaposed with a desire to be a sports bar. A football game, that a limited number of patrons seemed to be paying attention to, was on the televisions at a volume so loud that my server had to ask me to repeat my order to her, despite my literally shouting. It took a good amount of energy to try to carry on conversation and talk about the very enjoyable things we were eating with the person directly across the table.Overall, I'd go back to get more of that sweet, sweet pig, but I hope that improvements are made in the service.",,,
12,Jessica H.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,2.0,11/5/2018,"This place is mediocre at best. There are so many better American sports bar themed restaurants in NYC that are better than Barbacon. Aside from the food being a greasy mess it took 20 minutes for us to receive our beers, honestly by that time I would have paid for three!! I also expected to see familiar faces, maybe from HK location but all the new employee's seemed a little lost. I thought this place would have cooler specials and it just isn't all there so it's boring and a place just for a quick bite....if you want overpriced bites. If you love bacon then come for a quick snack but don't spend all your money here it isn't worth all the bacon hype.",,,
13,E S.,"New York, NY",1,2,10,5.0,11/2/2018,Excellent customer service.  The owner is so pleasantful.  Food and drinks were on point. They have an after dark brunch menu during the week days! Highly recommend,,,
14,Ivan W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/7/2018,"I have been to the uptown 9th Avenue site several times over the past couple of years. The Union Square site has the same imaginative bacon-centric menu, but is more spacious.I just tried their improbably delicious sundae made with caramel ice cream, nuts, a cookie, and of course bacon. Highly recommended.",,,
15,Steve C.,"New York, NY",6,25,1,2.0,10/14/2018,"One star is for the waiters and the other is for the Bloody Mary flights.I had high hopes for this place which is why we chose it for a Sunday Football afternoon.  Although when I spoke with the manager to express why I was a bit disgruntled with the fact that they had TVs that were blank and the same game on multiple TVs next to each other, the first thing she said to me was that it's not a sports bar.  I'm sorry, but when you have 20+ tvs and beer and a burger special, you're a sports bar. Right?The wings were not good- they should definitely change wherever they're ordering fromThe Ruben came out looking like airplane food. You know, when something looks slopped together in a somewhat assembly line fashion. They ended up taking it back and melting a ton of cheese on top which made it look even more gross. Inevitably that went back and they brought me the ribs which were very dry and chewy.Food wise, the fries were the only thing they were good. That's French fries tho. It's nearly impossible to mess up French fries with Cajun seasoning.All in all, I probably would have held this in and just not come back, but the extremely poor manner and attitude that the manager expressed was disgusting to us was deplorable. At this point I'm taking bets, feel free to message me with a wager. I say this place is closed before 2019.",5,,
16,Nat S.,"Manhattan, NY",10,70,19,3.0,10/15/2018,"BarBacon markets itself as a food-alcohol fusion bar so it better have good effing food right? Wrong. The wings were HORRIBLE. Sorry but plastic meat doesn't cope with my system. Bar wings should always be top notch. Stick with the fries at this place. The bacon items are great obviously, like the whiskey bacon drink. If you love bacon and you're drunk off your ass, this is definitely the place for the munchies. Price isn't too pricey. Hells Kitchen location is better. Better food, Better crowd.",,,
17,Scott H.,"San Francisco, CA",62,531,64,1.0,9/26/2018,Showed up at 12.   They lectured me on how the kitchen closed a long time ago because it was slow but if I really wanted a glass of wine they give me one quick.   Website says they close at 2am.     I guess I stand corrected.  I walked out.,1,,
18,Nicole M.,"Edison, NJ",411,104,65,3.0,11/2/2018,"Came here tonight with friends for a quick bite. Had the pulled pork sandwich. Pulled pork house made bbq bacon on a pretzel bun with chips. It was pretty good didn't eat the chips but my friends said they were sorta sad. To be honest i could get that sandwich again or not and feel pretty much the same, which is indifferent. They felt their sliders were ok. It's unnecessarily expensive and their bathrooms are a thing of nightmares. Seriously repulsive.",,1,
19,Christian B.,"New York, NY",20,4,5,5.0,9/29/2018,"We had a party of 5 and were seated immediately. After being seated the owner came by and introduced herself and expressed how happy she was to have us here, she brought over a basket of cornbread on her and it was delicious! For my meal I ordered the chicharron nachos and the chicken tacos. The chicken in the nachos were charred and delicious, the nachos are big and can be shared between two people. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is great! Will come again.",,,
20,Marie J.,"Manhattan, NY",219,3,0,5.0,10/7/2018,"I was regular at hells kitchen location and now I work in union square area, definitely my to go bar, the food is absolutely amazing, I love bacon, so there is no way I'll be disappointed, even the salads are amazing, and I'm not even a salad person. The owner introduces herself to everyone and I think this is great, I got a couple of tastings in there and everything was delicious, the bartenders are awesome too, i never set on a table but i believe the wait staff is fantastic and super friendly as well. The selection of beers is super.They're doing a great job in there. Will be back regularly, there is no other place like around that area. Thank you barbacon",,,
21,Michael D.,"New York, NY",4,2,0,1.0,10/3/2018,"Been to the HK location and was excited to find out there was a location closer in Union Square so decided to give it a shot. While the staff was friendly, and through no fault of their own, we came across the worst service I've experienced in NYC. While I understand they are a new establishment, we have definitely allotted for the learning curve. The restaurant was not busy and we happened to be there during happy hour; unfortunately it took 20 mins to get our first drink-- We let it slide! Upon finishing our first beer , ordered a 2nd round and again another 20 minutes!! Not letting this one slide -- . So to sum it up , we invested over 2 hours at this point for some finger food and a couple drinks. We actually timed our final drink and took 21 minutes -- bartenders were not busy!!!! So the final bad experience ( waiting 15 mins for the check, providing two credit cards to split the check and apparently the calculators were broken as we we were both over charged by 20%. Tried to wave down anyone we could for another 10Mins to no avail so unfortunately the waitress is missing out on her tip! We noted both receipts and hopefully this is a lesson to the owner who we met before she left (when we just arrived and were in good spirits). Please take note and fix this otherwise you will not last!!!",5,1,
22,Monty G.,"Queens, NY",0,10,2,5.0,10/26/2018,So wat can I say !!!!The picture got me drooling and I walked all the way from 6th ave for my bacons and they hit the spot as the bacon sampler were super awesome.....,,,

Not writing this place off quite yet.The service was good, but we had to hunt down the server for glasses of water, then again for mayo that was not included on our BLTs, and the appetizer arrived with our sandwiches.Also, please cut your BLT sandwiches in half.

And I am so glad we did. We were greeted by super friendly staff who made excellent drink and appetizer recommendations. We got a bacon taster (um excuse me, a flight of bacon?!) and loaded tots to much on with our bacon infused cocktails, all of which were super yummy. The owner popped by our table to say hi and see how we were liking everything, and really just everyone here has been super friendly and helpful. The server has been attentive during our whole stay. GET THE SUNDAE. Unfortunately  I don't have any pictures because we wolfed everything down before I could snap a shot.

Went there and it has a cool atmosphere, friendly staff BUT everything was a mess.. We waited for our drinks for 20 minutes we ordered 3 drinks each (of course one after the other), we got there at 7 and happy hour was done by 8 so those 3 drinks was the whole happy hour (not that happy) .. Food was ok but the service a completely disaster.. I hate giving bad reviews but maybe if I do they will do something about it to make it work , otherwise this place is not going anywhere.. at the end we asked for our check ,20 minutes to get it and was NOT busy but again we were patient.. i asked my friend would you come back here ?and he said , I'd give it another chance I was like mmmm maybe.. Finally we got our check , bill was $77.25 and our credit cards were charged $45.00 each and tip wasn't included , so we tried to get someone's attention for several minutes but nobody ever came..

33,Steven V.,"Brooklyn, NY",15,10,1,1.0,9/23/2018,"The wait staff is friendly and nice but everything else here is pretty terrible. All the tables are super wobbly. We changed to a different table from the first one we sat in and it was just as bad. Heard the waiter tell the next couple that sat in our previous table that they move the tables every night, that's the reason they are unsteady. We ordered 3 dishes, the bacon burger, the chicken biscuit sandwich and the beer bacon sampler. As soon as we placed our order the waiter came out with the chicken biscuit sandwich immediately without the rest of the food. Not smart bc we wanted to eat our food together but they probably had an extra one ready for whatever reason. 20 + min later the burger comes out (ordered medium well) and clearly comes out dripping red blood rare. So we send it back to be recooked. They then send the bacon sampler out with only the bacon and not the beer. I asked for the beer from 3 different servers. It finally came out 15 min after the bacon dish, hence now the bacon is cold. So these three dishes and one coke  came out to $90. Chicken was over cooked and over breaded (very dry), burger tasted like it came off an uncleaned grill and the bacon was good but cold. Then i give the waitress my credit card and she comes back with two cards (ones not mine) and asks if we want to split the bill. She somehow grabbed another credit card from the bar and wasn't sure if she should split the bill on the card. So even though I work down the block, I would never return here.",1,,
34,Alfredo D.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,2,1,5.0,10/5/2018,"I mean... the name says it all right ""Bar Bacon"" my expectations were just that. Go to a bar that serves variations of bacon. I didn't initially realize that this new local bar now occupies the space formerly known as ""The Royal."" I wasn't looking to be nostalgic on a Friday but it is what it is. I walked into ""Bar Bacon"" and immediately could tell what was the same and what was different. The decor for the most part similar. The layout somewhat different. No more DJ booth and no more velvet sofas that line the wall when you first walk in. Even the U-shaped booths in the back were gone. ALL FOR THE BETTER. The liveliness and attentiveness of the staff quickly made me realize this new themed sports bar/Restaraunt is here to stay. Only my first time walking into the new venture and I already know names. I honestly just came for the Yankees post-season game verse the Red Sox. Then I noticed a ""NO COVER"" advertisement for tomorrow's UFC fight. I'm a New Yorker; have been all my life but I guess I'll be coming back tomorrow. Many thanks to John the bartender (very personable) and Nick (one of the servers); awesome fellow sports fans.
