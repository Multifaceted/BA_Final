We'd eaten at Burgers and Lobster/Le Rivage for their French onion soup burger/Shake Shack previously this trip. I ordered their Amsterdam cheeseburger with avocado; they ordered overlook cheeseburgers with jalapeño peppers. We had regular and sweet potato fries. Oh, and a Nutella shake. They had many drink options. Everything was delicious! Probably my favorite burger and at a good price! The employees were super friendly. They have a counter to eat at inside (the window opens in warmer weather), but no tables. I'm sure many people get their food to go.",2,,2

Medium should be the standard if someone does not specify how they want their burger done.-I am not sure if it was because it was a delivery, but sweet potatoes fries were soggy and kind of cold, I had to put them in the toaster oven.Verdict: I wouldn't object to giving them one more try before making a final decision.",3,,

Not only was I craving a burger and/or hot dog, but I hadn't eaten all day, so I decided to get both. To me, this place is a gem because of its location (it's really unique for where it is located), and the fact that they use high quality ingredients/meat. A burger is a burger and is probably gonna clog your arteries regardless, but there's a huge difference between a McDonald's burger and a real burger. I also despise flat/squishy buns, so the fluffy ones provided here were definitely a plus. Both the hot dog and the burger were cooked perfectly. The burger in particular had incredible flavor, although the picture does it no justice.",4,1,3

Updated review","I hate giving 5 stars. It stems from my belief that it means perfection and nothing is perfect in this world, besides my cousin Ringo. Obvi. However, after a year of trying all the burgers I could in the area, the ""McDowels"" to Shake Shack has the most consistently good, higher quality burger. The fav is the Heights Burger. Simple and well made, like me and that's the true test of a burger. That sauce is delicious, but I'd get it on the side, because there's very few things in life more tragic then oversauced meat. Pause. All the issues I had in my initial review are no longer a problem. There's always a nice crust on the patty and when you tell them medium, it  comes as such. The meat to fat ratio is close to Shake Shack's, but it's defiantly less fatty, so the flavor is different. It's apples and oranges, Felecia. The staff is cool, friendly & genuine. I can only assume that they are treated well by management. If you spend over $10, make sure you get a stamp card for free grub later. It's the best neighborhood option for that quick fix you need, but on an elevated level you deserve over the golden arches. If they had a bar and TV, I'd probably never leave.",11,7,7
6,Shianti B.,"Manhattan, NY",208,81,134,5.0,5/18/2018,"Okay. I've heard a lot about burger heights and today I decided to go and see what its about. It has a nice set up; very nice hole in the wall vibe.The cashier and other staff are super professional and very down to earth. The give great customer service and were super patient with me. (Today I've been loopy, leave me be.) Ok so she took my order and then gave me a loyalty card. OMG!! So I was too excited for this because I love free shit. So the way that works is you got a stamp on every purchase over $10. On your fifth purchase you get a free order of fries and then on your 10 purchase you get a free Burger. Really great especially if you live in the area or just love burgers. But anyway ... about this burger I had!Ok so the first thing that I appreciate about this place is that you can order your burger to the cooking consistency that you like so rare all the way to hockey puck. I ordered the Audubon Burger which is basically a turkey burger with grilled onions avocado lettuce tomato and it was amazing. The turkey burger was cooked well it was flavorful the cheese was melted great everything tastes fresh and I was very very excited. When I open my bag to take the burger out it came in this like weird Burger contraption made out of paper but I like that it was fancy it kept everything together.  I also ordered the gelato Shake; a me zing so good so creamy just wonderful!!!! They do have a vegetarian option for those that don't eat turkey or beef. They sell regular Fountain drinks and beverages there as well they have one of the little machines with all the flavors so you can go crazy if you like. They also have indoor and outdoor seating which was really cool to me it's a bar stool set up no tables. And this is definitely a place where you can go hang out with friends and not too big of a crowd since there's not a lot of space but a nice size you can take about four of your friends and go eat a good burger.",2,,1
7,Chris L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,6,4.0,4/1/2018,"Always wanted to try this place since I hang around the area often enough but I didn't go in before due to the large line of ppl i see inside. This time I was lucky and it was not  crowded at all l. So we enter this establishment and we see that it is very small but still were interested in trying to burgers with big burger pants I ordered the Broadway Burger and she ordered the Amsterdam Burger along with cheese fries and an Oreo milkshake with Nutella. Needless to say the wait wasn't too bad but luckily it wasn't crowded so we were able to sit down and wait. The gentleman at the council was very nice we explained it was our first time here and he was very helpful. He even let us know that you know we can combine milkshake flavors and he recommended the Oreo with nuteella, which was great tasting by the way. The cheese fries and burgers tasted amazing you can really tell that they took their time with the bacon on the burger also the avocado really tasted fresh on the other burger. Ultimately it was just a great tasting meal you know it really wasn't bad I would recommend this place and I would come back granted that they aren't swamped with people.",2,1,
8,June S.,"New York, NY",189,552,4070,4.0,7/11/2017,"The first thing I heard about this place when they opened was their similarity to Shake Shack. Since I like Shake Shack, that was not a bad thing to me. I could see similarities in their offerings, and also their logo. Regardless, they seem to be doing pretty good with high reviews. There is a small seating area right at the entrance with counter table and bar stool chairs. The inside is not very big, just enough to fit a handful of people comfortably. It was nice and clean, bright and open. They had a delivery staffs on stand-by, as they seem to get many delivery orders. They don't have many seating, but a creative way to maximize it. They have a counter with bar stool in the inside, and another counter, set several inches lower, facing the restaurant with metal chairs. I believe they close the window during the cold months, which eliminates the few seats that are places outside.Once your order is placed, then they start to cook your order. This means that it takes a bit longer time for your food to ready, but it will be super fresh! We ordered Overlook burger, Amsterdam burger, Sweet Potato Fries, Cheese Fries, Dolce de Leche Shake, and Mint Chocolate Chip Shake. They do not have any ""set"" items, so everything need to be ordered separately.The staffs were young and chit chatted with each other the entire time. But they did cook the food pretty well, and they kept the place clean. At a place like this, that is much more important than a friendly, polite service...although, it will be nice to get both...I was very happy to visit this place finally. I was pleasantly surprised with their high quality ingredients and the food. It was better than I expected!  I would like to go back and try some other offerings in a near future.",5,1,5
9,Chris G.,"New York, NY",20,139,386,4.0,7/18/2017,"Exterior: A nice modern appearance with cute signage. The front window panel opens to reveal an open outdoor eating experience. Only a small selection of bar stools to sit in so don't show up with a large crowd and expect seating. The menu is easy to read and filled with yummy options. The price is a bit high for burgers. I wish the burger pricing included fries at least. I chose a bacon cheeseburger with a side order of fries and a coke. The fries were natural cut and seasoned lightly with salt. I loved them! The burger appeared to be similar to Shake Shack with a nice soft bun. However, my one complaint is the amount of grease on the burger. There was so much it was dripping down my hand. I went through a lot of napkins but enjoyed the burger nonetheless. I would love to come back here again and try the chicken sandwich. Overall it was a good experience. The staff were very friendly and made us feel welcome.",3,1,1
10,Fariha K.,"Bronx, NY",86,147,76,3.0,12/17/2017,"I liked the audobon location way better, the service is faster and the place is just larger to sit in. I typically like the food at this chain but this review is solely for the burger I had and this particular location. I tried the Audobon burger, which was a turkey burger, my very first. Although the meat was very tender and not dry like most turkey burgers as I hear, the meat lacked spice and seasoning so it was very dull. I did not really enjoy it. The cheese fries were good per usual but I don't think I will get the turkey burger again.. or come to this location. The area is super busy so it's difficult to find parking and the place gets busy really fast so the service is longer. I definitely like the other location and I can't wait to be back! Next on the list to try: the shakes.",1,,1

Their burgers are to die for and so are there sweet potato fries. I've only gotten their turkey burgers, but they're one of the best I've had. The maple sauce they have is so yummy. Their shakes are also really delicious and creamy. I've had the Dulce de Leche Shake and it was to die for. The customer service went beyond my expectations. The first time I ordered online and they called me when my order was ready to pick up and when I went the employees I came across were so kind. The second time I went I ate in, and the service was also amazing. The restaurant is very clean and it's also really nice looking.

The burgers are delicious and always a treat. Love the design of the store and how I can sit and just watch people pass by. Usually I get a regular burger or the amsterdam. Those are always good! I've also gotten the carbless burger, but it fell apart pretty easily and I ended up eating it with a fork.The hot dog was alright as well. The tastey but the bread fell apart really easily :(The shakes are amazing! I always have a little debate with myself whether or not I should get it....( i went to the dentist so I deserve it... but my waist line doesnt appreciate it... ahhh!)Great place to go for lunch or just a snack and hangout while your in the heights.",3,,2
21,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,4.0,9/6/2016,"Seemingly out of place burger spot in an area that definitely needs more of these. Small interior with stools at the window and a full menu of burger options.Since there's not much seating, got an order to go. Went with the Amsterdam ($7), a hazelnut shake ($5), and cheese fries ($4). I like how they give you the option on how you like the burger done, since most fast food spots don't care. The medium patty is incredibly juicy, combined with the guacamole made for a very creamy burger - though held pretty well together by the bun. fries created a good balance, nicely crisped and not too salty. The cheese came as a side dipping sauce rather than a topping, not a fan of it. Shake is not too thick nor too thin and flavorful. A well constructed burger place meal.Service here is quick - took about 12 minutes for the order to come out. Spot also has a modern soda fountain, so wouldn't be bad to get a meal to stay in. Will come back for the other burgers.",5,,
22,Samantha R.,"Seattle, WA",338,12,0,5.0,6/3/2018,"The food here is unbelievable. Simply delicious. The burger patties, toppings and buns are always so juicy and fresh! I am even obsessed with the paper they wrap the burgers in, it makes them so easy to eat even if you're eating it on the go. The assembly of the burgers even is perfect, every time. Nothing s ever sloppily thrown together, this place is classy! The fries are crispy and delicious, and the chipotle sauce is a heavenly, smoky magic sauce! The employees here are always incredibly friendly and kind. I live around the corner so I come here way too often. Love Burger Heights, hands down the best burgers uptown ! I'm not sure if I selected the correct location but the Wadsworth & 182nd is the one I am speaking about.",1,,

I'm not much of a burger person but I have found myself coming back in several occasions. My favorite is the Amsterdam. The Audubon, which is turkey, is also very good and always seems a little larger than the beef burgers in my experience. The Fort Washington, a veggie patty, is also worth a try. Love both their regular and sweet potato fries. I don't order shakes but my friends that have ordered them always recommend them. I like that the food is named for the streets of the local area. It gives the menu character and gives some ownership to the locals. They have opened up a second location in the neighborhood within the last year. Definitely recommend!",,,

The burgers are thick, juicy, and loaded with toppings -- all which make for an outstanding burger experience. Both the regular and sweet potato fries are also super tasty and perfectly seasoned (not too heavy). My favorite part about this place are their gelato shakes.

38,A D.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,71,4,1.0,9/30/2017,"It is with some regret that I write this negative review, after initially being so happy to find a decent burger place so close to work. On September 28th, I ordered a burger and shake from here (for nearly $20). I'd also ordered a burger from here the day before. These were the main meals of my day, having eaten nothing else that was prepared fresh. The following day on the 29th, I woke up early in the night/morning with uncontrollable vomiting. I only threw up the burger, and nothing else was left. It continued on for most of the day, couldn't hold anything down, until family got me to the urgent care after seeing my state, at which point I was promptly put on an IV for extreme dehydration, prescribed various medications, and blood tests ordered (which were found to indicate the presence of an infection. Possible Hepatitis A.) Though I am doing better the following day, my stomach is completely shredded from the food poisoning and projectile vomiting, so much it hurts to move, laugh, or breathe too deeply. Basically have to take tons of electrolytes and stomach-soothing meds on a strict diet.Needless to say, I'm sorry that I will not be visiting this place again for fear of the sanitary practices and conditions.

43,Christopher D.,"Lodi, NJ",100,353,2535,3.0,2/23/2017,I had this spot bookmarked and was in the area and had a taste for a burger. First off very good customer service from the lady at the register was great and helpful. They have a very good quality of meat for the price and very delicious menu selection across the board for burger junkies. The bread was average and simple but everything else in between was very good. Heads up for first timers if you are claustrophobic then you will not like it here because it is pretty tight when busy. I definitely recommend using the chipolte sauce on the side for the first time to make sure you like it so you dont mess up your buger. The sauce has an interesting taste to it which may not be for everyone who have a certain taste for Chipolte sauce they are used to. My rating is really a 3.5 star. It's a good burger for the cost but it could be better in certain areas in my opinion. I would come back when in mood the for a quick bite most definitely.,9,5,5

The place is little on the small side but its still feels cozy, both locations feel family friendly with all the coworkers talking and working cooperatively. What had gotten me alittle more than infuriated was when I tried to use the code ""HOT"" to get $5 off an order I made, for it only to say it was expired. This is after the fact that there the email with the coupon said it was for the 25th to the 27th (I was trying to order on the 27th). It did not state an exact time by which the coupon should be used. Thought it was a mistake, so i take a call to the wadsworth location and a female employee picks up, tells me that she is the manager. She had not heard of this coupon, and immediate answer was that there was nothing she could do about it, then proceed to hang up the phone after murmuring something under her breathe. Short story- I was let down that the code I was waiting to use had expired. But more over irked at the sheer fact that someone could be so unprofessional in handling a customer call.

I've had several of the beef burgers as well and have liked them all. My only critique would be a bit more salt on the patties, but they are quite good regardless.The gelato is also delicious with a few flavors to choose from. I've had the dulce luche and hazelnut and I like both. In-store you can buy Mash sodas which are a carbonated fruit drink that is pretty good. Will definitely be back to the store especially now that the weather is getting warmer and will definitely be ordering more on Seamless!",8,3,5

Ordered the turkey burger & was pleasantly surprised to see  vegetarian options like black bean burgers & veggie patties (pine hurst) available. They also have other light/healthy options available like sweet potato fries which were really good. The hot dogs looked dam good from the pictures (stuffed with caramel onions); definitely would want to try one on another visit. We ordered 2 burgers ( turkey & pine hurst), 1 order of sweet potato fries, 1 medium drink = around $20 something). The burgers were a good portion size well worth the price & tasty.

A basic burger with ingredients that mush into something pretty generic and flavorless- like that episode of Spongebob where all the burgers come out of a machine that make them out of grey goopy stuff.

I don't eat red meat and this place was a great find when you're in a burger mood. My first visit the fries were extraordinary with a nice thick cut. So good I almost thought they were made there. Eventually I saw them bring them up in frozen wholesale bags but they still rock most days. The shakes are great. Only draw back the uptown Heights location as in most fast fresh places... the employees are there to talk amongst themselves and not so attentive. Other than that this place is very good.

I ordered a cab there and when I got home, the food was still hot, so that made me happy! I ordered three  heights burgers with fries, very well done, please... DUH! The fries are really good, I am a little embarrassed to say that they were so good that I ate a few on the cab, because I could no wait to get home... hahahha! I ordered three orders of fries, because I thought that two orders would not be enough, and I was wrong! The burgers are really good too! I did have a small problem... I ordered three well done burgers... and one was a little pink, and seeing that and feeling the texture in my mouth of that one burger was not satisfying. Anyways, the other two were well done and delicious... The "" heights sauce"" is delicious ask for extra!Ooh, and about the place... it is a small place. Some of the people who work there curse out loud at each other, playing around...even though they did not mean any harm, it is really not a cool environment when you hear the staffs cursing in a spot like this.. so if it wasn't because of this and because of my pink burger, I might have given this spot four/five stars.

57,Allison C.,"New York, NY",209,1624,449,4.0,7/8/2014,"This is my 1,000th review (!!!), and I'm so happy that I'm writing it about a new fantastic restaurant in my beloved Upstate Manhattan: Burger Heights.A few weeks ago while walking to the 1 Train, the signage above the entrance caught my eye, and my interest was piqued. This location, between 181st and 182nd on Wadsworth, seemed a bit off of the beaten path. I was unsure of when it was going to open, but a slew of Yelp reviews popping up on my main Yelp page yesterday seemed to show that, indeed, business was up and running!I convinced the beau to meet me up there for dinner. (Though, honestly, I didn't have to twist his arm too hard.) Right away, I was pleased with the vibe it put out: It has that garage door open-style, with two wooden counters free and exposed to Wadsworth. We perused the computerized menu above the cash register to decide upon our burger choices. The menu is small, but we both agreed that's a good thing; akin to a Shake Shack, you've got a few choices to select from with the option to double up on meat patties. I liked that. While there were plain options and two kinds of veggie burger options, I decided to be a bit bolder and go for The Amsterdam: A Pat LaFrieda meat patty with guacamole, tomato, and queso fresca. The beau opted for the Heights Burger with a double patty. THESE. BURGERS. ARE. AMAZING. The meat on both burgers, which we asked for medium rare, almost literally melted in our mouths. The buns were pillowy soft. The gauc on The Amsterdam was perfect and not so overwhelming in which it weighed down the burger or the bun. The special sauce on the Heights Burger had a good flavor with a slight hint of mustard. The lettuce on the Heights Burger, though a little large, was incredibly green and crisp, as if it was just picked from a garden five minutes prior. Also on the docket were a chocolate gelato milkshake and an order of fries, both of which were fantastic. The fries were clearly housemade, and the milkshake had a deep chocolate flavor to it.And can we talk PRICES? I find it funny that, as a New Yorker, I automatically assume that any good hamburger will cost me at least $12. As much as I don't like to admit this, I was honestly shocked, though pleasantly, when I saw the prices of burgers at this place. The most expensive hamburger was about $6.50, and that was The Amsterdam. The basic burger was less than $4. This place is Shake Shack-esque, but leaps and bounds above it. The food quality is fantastic, the space is cute, and the service is friendly, though there are still a few kinks to work out in the order taking process. (Our cashier was nice, but it took her a while to get our order down pat. No matter! I have faith. Haha.) I am so glad this place is in my neighborhood and I hope that it thrives! I know I'll be returning many MANY times.",28,6,10
58,Tony L.,"Manhattan, NY",617,635,594,5.0,9/1/2015,"Holy moly this is a great burger. In fact...I think it may be the best burger I've had in New York - easily beating out Shake Shack for the (undeserved) crown.I got the Heights Burger: a 100% Angus beef burger served with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and their signature Heights sauce...perfectly cooked to a true Medium Rare. They even have an easy guide for how long your burger will be cooked based on the temperature you want it. For just $10.00 I got the combo version of this which includes a fountain drink (with unlimited free refills) and their absolutely SUPERB french fries. A note from their website on their ground beef: ""Our beef burgers are handcrafted and uniquely blended, delivered daily by Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors. All beef is 100% Certified Angus, free of antibiotics and hormones, served on a toasted potato bun."" You can taste the difference. The burger is absolutely bursting with juicy flavor.I'll have to come back and try one of their many other signature burgers (some with lamb and fish!). But it'll be hard to beat the incredible Heights Burger.There are approximately 12 seats, some of which are outside, so make sure you have an alternate plan of where to take your food to go.

The burgers are tasty and sometime are delivered medium as requested.  But you spend nearly 30 dollars for a burger fries and a shake after a decent tip for the delivery guy.  And the price keeps doing up! This is what I have an issue with.  The cheese fries don't come with enough cheese so you need to spend an extra dollar for extra cheese.  That makes no sense. How about enough cheese sauce. If I want more than enough for every fry I'll pay for that. The gelato shakes are Tiny and they just tasted the price. Sometimes they come with too much milk.  If you want a 5 dollar shake it should be thick and tall not a small,,,

So I ventured in and the venue from the outside looks bug. But it's actually small with bar style counter seating. It's cold but they open up the garage door during the summer I bet. I ordered a Cabrini sandwich (lamb) with fries and a hazelnut shake. It's all made to order and they also do deliveries. The burgers are made to you're liking as well and definitely satisfied my craving with their Cabrini burger. The fries and thick and not too greasy and you can see the pepper flakes in them.

My boyfriend and I were craving a burger, and upon looking on Yelp we noticed that BH was in our area and it had some great reviews, so we decided to give a shot. And I definitely don't regret coming to this place. We both ordered the Broadway, which comes with two nice medium thick patties, that has a nice sear on the outside, and nice and pink in the middle. The meat itself was warm enough that whenever I took a bite of it, it just melted in my mouth. Not to mention, it's topped with a fresh slice of American cheese, that's melted to perfection along with bacon and a nice piece of lettuce. I can go on and on about this perfect burger.... We also had the sweet potato fries which were delicious, and the mint chocolate chip shake, also very yummy ! The location itself is small, but very accommodating. They have a few high bar stools to sit on to enjoy your burger, the staff was friendly. Overall a great place to enjoy an amazing delicious burger. The only reason why my review is missing a star is because they got the orders mixed up, ended up giving one of our burgers to a different customer, one of the cooks came out from behind the counter, grabbed it out of his platter and gave it to us.

Ordered my burger with spicy sauce and jalapeños. Not spicy at all, though - I guess I was overly excited for that. The menu is very traditional and there are no exotic or extremely different burgers - it can be a downside or an upside, depending on the customer.

So I order my food right after a white lady ordered her food the people working there are from Latinos so when this white lady order was ready they gave her a paper one bag of her order and then asked the white lady if she want a plastic bag to place her paper bag in with her order so the Latinos was accommodating her with that. So when it was my turn when I had two order that had two paper bags in stead of asking me if I want a plastic bag they just hand me the two paper bag with my order and wasn't accommodating and I'm black. So just to let you Spanish people know something just because you get one out of maybe five white customers to your store doesn't mean that those small group of white people will go and tell their so call rich white friends or family members about ur store. They won't come rushing in to buy anything to make your store rich, that's what you Spanish people fail to understand. It's the black people who go's to ur store and like it and then tell other people they know to go to your store and then on. So stop treating black people that go's to store that pay money too like their worthless because just so you all know white people look at you Spanish people as backs to because you are a black and being born in a Spanish county doesn't make you white. What make you white is actually being white and born in a Spanish county.",,,
81,Chris M.,"Somerset, NJ",690,273,2270,4.0,8/15/2014,"Right on the corner of 182nd and Wadsworth, Burger Heights is a small, space but  high quality burger & hot dog joint offering with shake and ice cream options as well, gearing towards the locals with burger names like Wadsworth, Broadway, and other street names in the Washington Heights area. The rolls & sauces were fresh and new and complimented the rest of the burger very well. Plus they give you options like sweet potato fries to mix it up from the regular fries you'd get elsewhere. The burger concoctions they create stick with trendy-type burgers and about 10 different types pre-made to choose from aside from making your own requests and run about $5 - $9 each. They'll take about 7-9 minutes to cook and serve and you have a small seating area with stools that probably limits itself to a crowd of 15 but there are a lot of people who grab to go. I enjoyed the open wall they have open during the summer and really think this will be a good add to the changing living environment in the area.

Super disappointed after the 20 minute wait (it's a meat patty and a bun, how hard can it be?) to get home and discover a lukewarm burger with a slice of unheated cheese slapped on top and absolutely zero flavor.  I put the bottom half of the burger in the microwave to heat it up and had to cover the whole thing in ketchup so it at least had some flavor.

Anyway it's good food, but I'd rather not go through with that again after the already long wait times.

I assure you it was only because of the bacon and I had no restraint to steer myself away....anyway, the Burger was nice, juicy (medium), and pretty fresh. The sweet potato fries were also very good, but lacking a little salt. What was especially good about them was the honey syrup like dipping sauce though. This easily made up for the fries' NaCl (sodium chloride) deficiency. While visiting and sitting to enjoy my food, I noticed many people coming and going for pick-up that they'd ordered before their arrival. Implicitly this told me quite a few local people just wanted the good food! ...a good sign about the quality of food and rep here.The space was small, but aesthetically appealing with a hip modern décor consisting of wood and aluminum metal panels.

Fries were on point too. Can't remember what my cousin had but he ordered another round so obviously he enjoyed his burger as well.    Staff was very friendly and things seem to be in order. Don't know how it would be if it's really crowded though... The burgers take a while but are worth the wait... This spot reminds a little like Shake Shack.. Parking sucks, take the train, bus, walk or take a cab..",2,,

Once I had my order within 15 minutes (a rarity, but still). I build my burger with beef patty, cheddar, raw onion and Heights Sauce. The Heights Sauce is seriously the best. It's best on the burgers and best to dip your fries in. The thick steak fries are always so tasty and fried perfectly, and one order is enough for me and my SO to share and feel very full after our burgers. My SO gets a custom burger with beef patty, cheddar, lettuce, pickles and Heights Sauce. We've found exactly what we like.I used to use Seamless to order from here, but their website is better to use. I was told that ordering directly through the website makes your order print on their end, whereas with Seamless they have to manually put it in (risking it not even being made at all). So use their website. It's where the coupons work anyway, when you get one.",1,,

I ended up getting the mushroom burger, which was such a great vegetarian option. I like that the menu is really extensive in regards to what is available in burger options: there is beef, vegetarian (3-4 kinds), lamb, and turkey. The french fries are the bomb. They are really big. The only problem is the small space and that it is too crowded a lot. Plus it is a little slow, but I will give them a break since it is the first month of opening.",5,1,1

She explained that they do not take online orders yet since they just opened. Silly me, I didn't realize that there was more than one location! I called the other location where I placed the order on Wadsworth and they told me that they would have their delivery guy deliver to the Audubon location. How dope is that??? He came in less than 10 minutes and the Audubon location let us stay to enjoy our meal. Can I just tell you that the food was AWESOME!!!!

They are less than 10 blocks from where I was located. Since we heard so many great reviews, we were excited to finally try it.Now, the first issue was that the food was TINY and the portion was very small. We felt like we ordered a kids meal. It was a bummer, especially because of the pricing. We spent $30 dollars for two orders. We both got a burger. Mine had avocado and my significant others was a basic turkey burger. The food had good taste to it but the burger bun was literally the cheap packs that you buy in supermarkets. They were not worth the price AT ALL. I could have made the same burger for an actual adult size and been happier. It was really disappointing and you could tell that they tried to cut cost in every way possible by providing the lowest quality bread, meats etc. I would not recommend this place and I'm really disappointed that my experience wasn't better. ):",5,2,

You can tell everything is fresh, and the bun + sauce are delicious! They also have a good variety of other burgers that I can't wait to try. I've never had to wait more than 5-10 mins for my order, and the staff is super friendly and attentive. I haven't tried their gelato or shakes but I've heard people in the restaurant raving about them. The prices are a bit higher than the surrounding spots in the Heights but it's well worth it.

After the first bite, I was blown away. It was exactly what I needed from my burger. The perfect ratio between ingredients and toppings - all covered in the meaty juices, mixed with the melted cheese and Heights Sauce (which I believe is some kind of concoction between thousand island and mac sauce). My two favorite burger places in the city were Shake Shack and 5 Guys. I never compared the two, because I believe you could be in the mood for one, or the other, as they are quite different. Burger Heights is a fantastic combination of both and I will be sure to order again!Oh yea, the fries were perfectly seasoned, albeit a bit soggy (due to delivery most likely), and great tasting!

Maybe next time, I would request for extra on the side?I was reading the reviews prior to coming hear and a lot of them were comparing this place to shake shack. After trying this place out I do have to say that the portions seem to be slightly bigger here. There was also a generous amount of fries.Burger Heights has more varied burgers and I love the fact that they offer you the option of building your own burger.

Unfortunately it's tiny. That being said, if you can, you should eat there because taking you burger to go can lead to some unfortunate occurrences-- mainly soggy bun and cold fries. The burger was good, not a fan of the fries (just a texture preference thing, I prefer hand cut), and the shakes are delicious but tiny. I went on a Friday around 8, they weren't super crowded but there were about 6 orders ahead of mine. I waited for about 10/15 minutes which wasn't bad. I got the combo with a shake (heights burger, regular fries, shake-12.50) and definitely could have done without the fries and wish the shake had been larger. For NYC standards it's a deal I guess.

The burger isn't exactly revelatory, but it's well cooked (to order) and it really does live up to its reputation of Shake Shack in the Heights (albeit with a thicker patty - not a bad thing in my view.) The one place where it far exceeds Shake Shack is their fries. Fresh cut, almost steak fries, anyone who tries these becomes addicted. Their sweet potato fries aren't bad but can't begin to compare. (I would skip the cheese fries too - the sauce isn't that great.) Their gelato milkshakes are terrific too.

Hats off to Ramon Pallone.My go to... to go order is: I'm a classic kinda person so I start with a Beef burger; Lettuce, Tomato, Bacon, American Cheese, Ham, Pineapple, Slaw, & BBQ.Cheese fries, A Split dog with kraut dunk in cheese.If you feel like a champion double the patty!The Burger's are cooked perfect... pink in the middle with dark char grill marks that make me think of a net of flavor holding back the juices inside from escaping. Beef, beef, quarter inch thick SLAB of ham with caramelized skin... this makes it a real HAMburger. Add on a layer of grilled pineapple with burnt grill marks on both sides. Next... thick wavy bacon dripping with melted American cheese with fresh veggies piled ""Heights"" Style. I don't want to forget the Slaw, It has a crispness and bite that must mean it's made fresh everyday. Get crazy and dunk that bad boy in the cheese sauce. Your not eating it right, if your don't have a drip of cheese on your chin.The Fries are so thick it will make your favorite girl jealous! If I may suggest... A secret menu item knows as ""Loaded Fries"" Fries that come covered in Parmesan cheese balls, garlic, & chopped Parsley. In a perfect world the size of the Parmesan cluster would be about the size of a peppercorn. Just popping as you bite.The Split Dog... You have to do Kraut, Cheese, Bacon. I'm not a fan of pickle or onion breath, if you're in to it do yourself a favor and load it up.Burger Heights has nailed the packaging as well. The burger comes wrapped like it is Christmas in burger town! You peel the crisp white paper back... waiting for the first glimpse of your above described masterpiece. First the juice then the glory.The dog is ball park style with the cardboard box that is recyclable. Better yet the entire meal comes packaged in a heavy box that ensures your bun is not crushed in delivery. All delivery trash is recyclable... Well done and way to set a standard!Overall Burger Heights is a welcomed friend to the Heights. This place blows the ""burger joint"" at Parker Meridien out of the water. I think Anthony Bourdain needs to take a trip north of town and crown the new king of NYC Burgers! Burger Heights!Looking forward to trying the Gelato shake...

Several comments were made by digital folk that had made the food  comparable to Shake Shack. I honestly had hoped that the customer service would of been  up to par with many other burger establishments, but I quickly became disappointed. Changing an item in the menu after ordering is simply impossible. And not due to staff, but to management. I left feeling very disappointed, because I really wanted to have an amazing experience, but all that was left  was feelings of me being disgruntled by it all. Especially since the manager "" vanessa"" had given me a side eye. In her reply to change an item, "" its already on the grill so no."" I left with my $7.00 order and to be honest, the burger lacked much in flavor. My first and last experience ordering anything from this place, so buyers beware.",1,2,

She normally has slim pickings compared to the plethora of options I have in the East Village but I was pleasantly surprised to come across Burger Heights. I read several reviews and decided to give them a shot. I placed my order and was given a 45 minute delivery estimate. Pretty standard stuff.After waiting over an hour I called them and they told me to call back in 15 minutes if I didn't receive my order because my food was already on the way. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and waited. 15 minutes later and still nothing. I call back and was told to wait another 20 minutes. Now I'm sitting here dying of starvation because it's been almost 2 hours and still no food.For the record this was supposed to be my grandmother's dinner. She has a great sense of humor so she's making the best out of it however I'm hangry (hungry and angry) and frankly I'm disappointed because I wanted to love this place.,7,2,1

I also had sweet potato fries which is always my favorite, but here the fries were not crisp at all, it almost felt like it got soaked in a water or something.

169,Natalie W.,"New York, NY",0,18,1,1.0,3/22/2016,"In no way is this even comparable to Shake Shack. This is the smallest and most disappointing burger I've ever eaten. I got my friend the Broadway. It came with two tiny slices of tomato (like not even a regular tomato... around the size of a plum tomato), two half-hearted pieces of lettuce, and the saddest strip of bacon I've ever seen. The roll was completely soggy. I wound up having to put it on my own roll and frying up some more bacon to even make it a reasonable dinner. I got the turkey burger with mushrooms. The mushrooms were good, but couldn't make up for the fact that the burger was small and soggy. The sweet potato fries, likewise, lacked any crispness whatsoever, even after I put them in the oven. I would rather go to a fast food joint or a diner than order from here again. Not worth $20 by any stretch of the imagination.",1,,

The delivery guy was so nice, too. In-person service was good and when you order pick-up, they always call to confirm your order beforehand.  I would give service 10 stars if I could, food 4.5 stars, and cost 3.5 stars.  The food here is very good (beef patties are 100% angus) and portions are very filling. If you order at Burger Heights, I recommend getting some of their more unconventional burgers because that's when you truly get a flavor experience and your money's worth. When I got delivery, I got the Wadsworth burger and the sweet potato fries with mint chocolate chip shake. I had only ever gotten the more classic Heights burger the other two times. The pineapple, ham and provolone, and bbq sauce really made the Wadsworth burger unique and the mayo maple sauce (!) made the sweet potato fries taste almost decadent. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as a daily burger joint (like I would In-N-Out) especially if you're on a budget, but as a place to order from when you're in the mood for a slightly more upscale burger experience.",,,

176,Gerald P.,"New York, NY",0,7,5,5.0,10/7/2014,"Burger Heights kills it. I go or order delivery about once a week. Not only are the burgers fresh and tasty, the buns and toppings are as well. I tend to place the burger down upside down because the bottom bun can get soggy when left right side up for several minutes. That would be my only complaint.If you don't want cheese choose build a burger to save a dollar, versus removing cheese from the Heights Burger because if you do it that way you still pay for cheese.I have not tried the lamb, turkey or veggie burgers.The French fries are well seasoned and have a good flavor, and balance of crispness and softness inside. They are almost like home fries, but seasoned, cooked and sized a bit more like French fries. The heights sauce can be requested on the side, and makes a great dipping sauce for the fries. I tried a regular hot dog once and found it had great flavor. One could probably go to town on hot dog toppings and turn it into a full meal.Sweet potato fries are thinner and crunchy. Would like to see regular fries come like this too as option, but like the fries all around.Seating in the restaurant is limited and the tables in the foyer area are too shallow to realistically eat on. The seating outside is awkward because the benches are far too low. So basically there are about 5 or 6 seats. I usually put my bag on a free one before I get in line to order to reserve it before someone ordering figures out they're going to be boned and have no where to sit. There is no wifi. There is no wine/beer. With the lack of seating this isn't really an issue, but it would be nice to have the wifi and wine/beers (and coffee) so one could spend more time chilling there, working, hanging with friends, etc. but it's just not set up for that. It's basically a true neighborhood burger joint.Delivery is reliable, fast, and keeps food in good shape. Though if they put the burgers in the bag upside down it would reduce getting the bottom bun soggy.... But that hasn't been a major issue with the deliveries I've done.",4,1,1
177,Alex S.,"Pittsburgh, PA",405,103,107,4.0,7/22/2014,"When I was in Kindergarten, we had a school publishing section called Cougar Press that allowed us to write books and get the pages bound and laminated. Being every little child's dream to live out their prepubescent years as the next J.K Rowling, I knew I had to get in on this. Drawing from my extensive reading experience, I passionately wrote out a story that I knew would be a hit with the teachers. It was called ""The Turtle and the Rabbit"". And this is when I first learned the word ""Plagiarism"".When I first arrived at Burger Heights and looked at their logo, the first thing I thought was ""If this sign was green instead of orange I would think this place was Shake Shack"". The drawing of the burger to the Font that they use, it's uncanny. When I looked at their menu, once again, I was amazed at the similarities between the two: Burgers(obviously), hot dogs, frozen desserts, shakes. And when I saw Heights Burger come out, it even looked like a Shack Burger. So is Burger Heights guilty of plagiarism? My teachers would certainly think so. But I understand. Ever since that fateful day when I was shamefully sent away from the press, I've realized that people can sometimes be too quick to judge. Sure, the logos pretty much look like twins who were separated at birth. But does that mean Burger Heights is bad? That it doesn't deserve to receive acclaim (if deserved)? Well, let's actually look at the food.As stated, the Heights Burger is pretty much a Shack Burger which means you get two slices of tomato, lettuce, cheese, medium cooked patty, and some Heights Sauce (instead of Shack Sauce). And let's just say that regardless of familiarity of taste, the burger is really good (it actually does taste like the shack burger...). Of course, it is on the smaller side but if you decide to not add on bacon or double patty, it'll cost you $5.33 (including tax) which in this day and age when people are willing to pay upwards of $20 for a burger, ain't too bad. They also have lamb, turkey, and veggie blends if you're so inclined but for what it's worth, the beef patty is a solid offering. But what really makes Burger Heights stand out is where it is, on 177 Wadsworth Ave. In a neighborhood that is not known for attracting many tourists and is far set off from the city of bright lights and concrete jungles, it is refreshing to see a delicious burger joint pop up. Kind of how my teachers would've been refreshed if they had actually read my story and realized that it had nothing to do with that ""slow and steady"" business but how it was actually about a ninja turtle who was trying to save his family from a ninja rabbit. Their loss.So aside from an outlet to vent 20 years of creative frustration, I'm happy to say I would send Burger Heights home bound and laminated. I hope they are the first of many who decide they want to bring more diverse food offerings to Washington Heights and who knows, maybe they'll start serving wine and beer too!",20,17,10

179,P C.,"New York, NY",24,199,355,3.0,10/8/2014,"Burger Heights is a welcome addition to the Uptown restaurant scene, as we are without many fast-food-that-isn't-McDonald's types of places. The restaurant is nice and clean, if a bit cramped. But hey, it's NYC, so lack of space is commonplace. In warmer times, they open up the front of the restaurant, so that provides more room. The staff was friendlyThe fries were very good and I enjoyed them. They had a very nice balance of crispness on the outside and softness on the inside.I had the veggie burger and my kid had the black bean burger. Both patties were on the bland side and tasted like MorningStar Farms patties. It would be nice if they made a homemade patty or fired up a portobello mushroom. I was not happy that they didn't let me sub a veg patty for the kid's meal. The only options were for meat, and my child is a vegetarian. All in all, the experience at BH was good, but I won't go out of my way to return. I've heard that they have a new vegetarian patty, so perhaps I'll give it another try soon!",3,,1

This place is really high quality for a number of reasons. I had a burger with Guac and Cheese, which was excellent. The sweet potato fries were some of the best I've had in recent memory as well. It's also not expensive by any means. Burgers run in the $4-7 range and are really juicy.Second Time: It was SO GOOD that I HAD TO bring my friends to CHECK IT OUT. I went with the Heights Burger, Shake, and Fries for $12 and of course threw on another juicy patty for just $2 extra. On the walk back home, if anyone pushed me, I would've fallen on my side like a dreidel. But this bloated feeling of beef and cheese in my stomach is pure satiety. In the words of Ron Burgundy, ""I'm not even mad; I'm impressed."" The chocolate shake was dank. Regular fries are nothing special though.The only problems with this place are that it does take a while to get your food and that it's pretty tight quarters.

Burger Heights is located in the best street possible, my block. It's between three main streets but at the same time its away from the madness.It's opened dining area allows ventilation and helps with the circulation of people.

The sweet potato fries were pretty good but the sauce that accompanies them was way too sweet--it's essentially like a diluted caramel-y sauce that accompanies the pecan rolls at Cinnabon.

Food was great, but I wish I didn't have to conclude what I just did. Burger must have been exposed, not kept refrigerated, or under cooked (I asked for well done). I won't be trying this place again - I thought I fell in love, but she broke my heart when she got me sick.",3,1,

I order their ""Heights"" burger with fries and Milk shake. The food was well prepared and very flavorful. The fries addicting unfortunately  the milk shake did not make the cut for me. I don't if the ice cream being use or what but that's one thing definitely haven't reorder. Beside that I've been very well fed and alway craving for more.",,,
