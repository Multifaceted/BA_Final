2,Rayski V.,"Milford, CT",354,2,0,1.0,11/8/2018,"- I walk in at 8:55 pm and ask if I can order to go. - They put my order in at 8:58 pm. - I ask how long it will take. ""20 minutes, not even.""- I text my wife, ""It's only going to be 20 min.""- 9:28 pm no food, but I'm cool. - 9:30 pm no food, but not a big deal. - 9:35 pm no food, wife texts me.- 9:40 pm no food, no apology. - 9:42 pm, the cook forgot the sweet potato fries.- 9:45 pm, waiting. - 9:48 pm, food finally comes out.- No apology. No effort to make things right. - Get home, they forgot to include a side.- As an East Harlemite, it made me sad that this is the caliber of service available to me and my neighbors. - Owner, please train your team better. Some simple effort to make up for the delay would have maintained a good rapport. Unfortunately, I left there feeling disrespected as a customer. - First and last time I will give them my business.",,,
3,Lea C.,"Bronx, NY",54,15,0,2.0,9/6/2018,"Let me start off by saying this place came highly recommended by my bf  (who is very picky about food) so naturally I was curious to see what all the hype was about. I came here on Sept 2 at around 7pm with my bf and his friend, restaurant was surprisingly empty so I thought this interesting considering it was a holiday weekend. We were promptly greeted by the bartender ( no server in sight) and after sitting on the metal barstools, we decided to find a better spot. We opted for the outdoor space, but quickly realized that it was a mistake considering how steamy it felt outdoors. We found a nice little table by the bathroom, ordered our drinks and took a minute to look over the menu. The drinks took FOREVER to arrive and we still had not ordered our food. My bf and his bud ordered a mojito ( way too much mint for a 8oz rocks glass) and at $9 it should've been much better. To add insult to injury the bartender's attitude sucked....zero emotion, looked like he didn't want to be there. We ordered our food, finished our drinks ( bartender never came back to see if we wanted another round) just as we were about to leave, the food came. WOW!!!!!!!The food arrived in little red and white boat trays that you get at a fastfood joint or street fair. No plates, explanation, just dropped the food and left. I was shocked, as a former server communication is key and this person dropped the ball. When I asked why is the food being served this way, he casually said I think we ran out of plates...smh. The food was not good... my parmesan wings had ZERO sauce on them and were charred badly. I was so hungry that I ate them but sadly regretted later on that night. A nice woman who apparently worked there came over to see if she could fix my meal. She ended up bringing out the sauce and cheese but by then it was too late. She was sweet enough to give us a round of drinks and asked us to give the place another try....to be honest, I'm not sure...we will see.",1,,
4,Games L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,5,0,2.0,10/1/2018,"The food was blah. Had a chicken sandwich and it was skimpy with chicken. Skirt steak was just as skimpy and gave me the wrong sides, when I mentioned it they refused to give me the correct sides and gave me $1 refund for each side and didn't order to correct it. The east  side burger was meh. Lamb burger was the best part of the menu. Wing were dry and not worth it. Overall it was horrible. You pay 4x more then the deli next door but you better food at the deli.",,,
5,Thomas G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,8/12/2018,"4th visit, worst than the last few times, horrible. There is always a couple of things off per trip here, so i give up. Neglectful service. Long wait for food, drinks when there are no other customers. Food quality and serving size for price is spotty. Employees seem very distracted.",3,,
6,Carmen W.,"New York, NY",126,220,179,4.0,10/27/2017,"Happy hour-12pm-8pm m-fGreat HH !This place is a little gem in Harlem. Baja tacos-12$- these were my least favorite from what we got. Compared to the other two apps, this was laughable-""bajajaja."" It's not gross though, but I'd try something else bc these are just ok. Salmon bites-10$-these were bomb. Don't let ""salmon-else"" get this. Get it yourself so you don't have to share!Alligator bites-9$- I've never had alligator before so I have nothing to compare it to, but these were bomb. However, I think these were ""crookodiles,"" cause it was SOO good, it stole my heart. There's also a cute outdoor area to sit and drink. The staff is friendly and happy. Go here!",2,3,2
7,Ladre S.,"Brooklyn, NY",366,4,0,5.0,10/19/2018,Love Sapoara! My girlfriend and I stopped by last night and not only was the food and an atmosphere amazing but the service provided was impeccable. Our waitress Stacy or Stephanie if I remember her name correctly was so warm and welcoming. We had such a great time. Will definitely be recommending  you guys.,,,
8,Rachel B.,"South Abington Township, PA",191,31,26,5.0,5/11/2018,"What a great spot! Awesome food and perfect drinks!  Came in with a group of 5 and the service was awesome. The bartender Evelyn makes amazing drinks and has a welcoming personality!  We had kamakaze shots and margaritas.  The wings, chicken bites, and totones are phenomenal. Great DJ also.  Highly recommend.  Oh and Evelyn is smoking hottttttt!  She really took care of us. We will be back tomorrow.",,,1
9,Angela G.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",0,23,0,5.0,8/1/2018,"Wings wings wings..  garlic Parm are the best I have ever had.  The sauce on the seasoned fries reminds me of truffle fries.  The staff is polite, could be a little more attentive but it's not unbearable. The all day happy hour M-F Is a bonus. If you're in east Harlem check them out..",1,,
10,Myra U.,"Charlotte, NC",4,23,16,5.0,7/27/2017,"This place went beyond and above making a vegetarian girl feel just right at home. AMAZING customer service. EXCELLENT food. GREAT music. SUPERB drinks. PERFECT ambience. WELL balanced menu. (Enough choice not to feel overwhelmed, people it's a bar for goodness sake!).Finally vegetarians and vegans can go to a bar (in that area) and have a decent meal (not only the ordinary wings, fries and burgers)! So, I obviously have to speak of their delicious avocado tempura! This is my favorite dish, not only is it ingenious to fry avocado, but the batter is light, non greasy and just the right amount for the perfect crunch. Then to top it all, you get to dip it in the most exquisite guava sauce, to die for . Menu also has choices of vegetarian salad with huge chunks of grilled portobellos, meatless burger and a creative spicy yummy guacamole served with real plantain chips and perfect amount of paprika!   they just recently open and seems like they have much surprises on the works!!! I highly recommend this place!",4,,4
11,Jessica T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,1,5.0,7/11/2017,"I never write Yelp reviews, but I am so excited about this place that I have to share:Went here the week it opened, and it was so good that I went back two days later to take more friends - and it was full already with good looking people. It is right at the M15 SBS bus stop at E 117th St and 1st Ave. The staff, and especially the female owner are super friendly and welcoming. Cool decor, upbeat music playing and fun vibe. Creative and delicious food. The back patio should be open soon... can't wait. This is definitely going to be our new local and was much needed in East Harlem. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!",3,,1

13,Julie B.,"Manhattan, NY",278,420,241,5.0,7/26/2017,"Place just opened and is still a work in progress, but I like the direction it's headed. Can't wait until they have the outdoor patio ready! It's owned by a young couple and they are very nice. We had the wood roasted buffalo wings and they were awesome! The guacamole is also great, a generous portion and served with plantain chips instead of usual tortilla chips. Drinks were tasty and the happy hour goes 'til 8 right now, which is awesome. Unfortunately, they were out of alligator bites so I will try those next time.",1,,
14,Jessica B.,"Manhattan, NY",61,54,88,4.0,7/29/2017,"Beautiful new spot in my neighborhood. Love the happy hour prices and the drinks were delicious and pretty strong!My friend had the seasoned fries, he wasn't a fan but I liked them. I also had the plantains and guac. The guac was amazing! But they do need to give you more chips (no refills). I literally ate the rest of my guac with a fork, lol.Very limited menu but I understand since they've only been open for about a month and some change. Our server was very attentive but service was a bit slow only because he was the only one working. But I could tell he was doing his best.All of my complaints are understandable for a new establishment so I'm not holding anything against them. It's a lovely spot, definitely worth a trip.",,,

17,Noel C.,"New York, NY",13,82,1,5.0,8/4/2017,"The best and main attraction here is how nice the owners are!!!  Having been a businessman and salesman for various well known companies in Manhattan and  the Bronx since 2009, I can tell you that CUSTOMER SERVICE will either make $$$$$ or break -$ a business.  Hence, if they don't change for the worse here, (as happens with most businesses 2 years after they open) this great beautiful NEW addition to SPANISH HARLEM will flourish.  Great food, attentive well mannered employees who make you feel welcomed.    I highly recommend this BEAUTIFUL GEM!!!! FAMILY FRIENDLY!!!",1,1,1

20,Lucinda L.,"New York, NY",6,82,404,5.0,7/1/2017,"What a fabulous new find that opened at the end of June 2017.  This is a family owned business and the day I was there, I met the couple who own this terrific addition to the area.  Try the Salmon Tempura Bites and Wood Roasted Wings -- I suggest family style and putting the appetizers in the middle of the table so everyone can try.  I know, the vegetarian delight is the Crispy Fried Avocado with guava sauce (yes, it is delicious) ... The burgers are great and for vegetarians, I tried the Wood Roasted Mushroom Veggie Burger and would eat it againThis place is perfect for friends or turn into the local bar where everyone knows your name. The place is spotless and inviting with the brick walls and wood tables ..",2,,1

23,Pedro C.,"Miami, FL",26,33,5,5.0,1/27/2018,Small place with very good happy hour deal (11am-11pm) and very good food. The NY steak and the shrimp were amazing. They have a great selection of beers and a small outdoor patio for warm weather.,,,

The Chef...Top of the Top with the Cuban/Puerto Rican background.

26,Sherona G.,"New York, NY",138,19,14,3.0,11/2/2017,The food here is amazing but the service has been subpar 90 percent of the time especially during lunch time. Today my waitress took forever getting me water and was very confused. She was also in her Phone majority of the time. A lunch hour is not long enough when your server Super slow. It's unfortunate cause they're food is great,1,,1
27,Carmen S.,"Boston, MA",121,70,1,3.0,8/31/2017,"I really wanted to give this place more stars because the staff is so nice and attentive, they have a nice selection of beer and it's a cute place near my apt BUT I find that their food is a little too expensive for what it is. I'm underwhelmed by the food and prices but if they could just work on those things this would be such a cool spot. The thing that bugged me the most were the chicken wings. You get 6 frozen Tyson tasting chicken wings for like $12 or $13 which es un robo. The margaritas were also no good. I had trouble finishing mine which never happens. Hope they can fix these things because I'd like to see them stick around the neighborhood.",4,2,2

It's new to the area and of course has some growing pains but it is well worth the stop. Nice outside area; intimate. Definitely the best place for brunch, nibbles and alligator!!!The wood grill is amazing.",1,,
29,Eve R.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",321,3,2,5.0,7/23/2017,Food was fantastic!! I had the veggie burger with onion rings. The burger was made to perfection and the onion rings were definitely hand made. Best restaurant in this area for sure!! Will definitely be back.,,,

33,Jawn M.,"Phoenix, AZ",0,5,0,5.0,7/16/2017,Love the vibe in there. Everyone who works there is extremely nice and attentive. Ordered a basic burger and fries and they were both great. They are newly opened so there are still some additions they are making that i think will make it even better (outside patio etc).Like any smaller bar a big key is making sure unsavory locals dont take up the bar all day but i would definitely recommend coming here. Not too many bars of that sort in the area so its a welcome addition.,2,,1
34,Lo C.,"New York, NY",0,12,0,5.0,7/30/2017,"Just stopped by before biking to a concert on Randall's island, and we are happily surprised to find the charming Sapoara!Good food and cute atmosphere.

35,Brittany M.,"Bronx, NY",3,9,0,1.0,8/29/2017,"This place is a joke. I was performing in the area at 8 so was looking for a spot to have a healthy bite before the show. I saw their menu had salads so BOOM perfect. I ordered a simple salad. Mushrooms, arugula, some onions and tomatoes. $13 for a salad, but alas el barrio is gentrified, so what can you expect. Placed my order and waited. And waited. ANNNND waited. It took 25 minutes for them to bring out my salad. There was no protein in it. It was literally uncooked veggies tossed together in a dressing and it took 25 minutes to come out. The spot wasn't packed either. Then when the salad does come out, I am NOT exaggerating, although I wish I was, it was the tiniest salad I have ever seen in my life. It looked like what they put on a burger to add some greens. I literally finished it in 3 bites. So not only did I wait 25 minutes for an over priced salad meant to feed a newborn baby, but I left hungry and had to go buy a meal somewhere else. Only saving grace was the bartender was super sweet. NEVER AGAIN.",4,1,1
36,Maria S.,"Montclair, NJ",0,4,0,1.0,8/9/2017,"I really wanted to check it out and loved the photos of the meals previously posted but they did not have a cook at lunchtime at almost 1pm even though they advertise as open from 11am.
