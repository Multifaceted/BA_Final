1,,10/28/2018,357,,"New York, NY",Daniela L.,37,4.0,144,"I've eaten at Vic's twice now, once for dinner and again for brunch. While I preferred my dinner, the quality of the food, as well as the service, was consistent. The restaurant's ambience immediately draws you in; the decor strikes a balance between clean and modern, and traditional and rustic.The pizza and pasta here are excellent, plain and simple. The options aren't particularly experimental, but it's clear that the focus is on making the ingredients stand out as much as possible. The tomato pizza is a great example of this, a pie with nothing but tomato sauce, mozzarella, a few basil leaves, and some pecorino sprinkled on top. Is it the most memorable pizza I've ever had? No, but it's delicious and worth ordering if you're in the mood for pizza.The same goes for the pasta. At the time, garlic, chilies, and broccoli rabe complemented Vic's spaghetti. The combination of garlic and chilies reminded me of the spaghetti served at another popular restaurant in the city, a personal favorite of mine. Still, Vic's version was unique, and didn't need to rely on a tomato-based sauce in order to impress.I returned for brunch after quite some time, and picked the ""eggs, greens & grains"" from the menu's egg selection; it's essentially a bowl of spinach, feta, charred onions, and almonds, with two fried eggs as the finishing touch. All of the components worked well together, but there was an excessive amount of feta, which made the dish a little too salty. Everyone raved about the focaccia we shared as a table though. In the future, I'll probably stick to the Italian cuisine at Vic's. After all, I have yet to try the ricotta-stuffed borsa!",2
2,,10/26/2018,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Cameron Y.,0,4.0,4,"So I've been here about 10 times, and every time I leave this place thinking the same thing: Food is great, ambiance is cool, service leaves much to be desired (with an exception). I love this place, but the service really puts a damper on the experience.Food: The food is fantastic. The menu changes frequently with interesting recipes and fresh ingredients. The pastas are delicious, portion sizes are just right, and the garlic bread. The garlic bread is heavenly. It's a lemon garlic butter on fresh, flaky bread. You have to try it. They also have a knack for making absolutely delicious vegetables. The egg sandwich with bacon and burrata at brunch was perhaps the best sandwich I have ever eaten. The cocktails are creative and delicious as well.Space: It's also a cool space, although it can get a little loud. I like that I rarely have trouble getting a reservation here. And now the not so great. The servers are subpar and very unattentive EXCEPT for Daniel, who is perhaps the best server I have ever had. He is friendly, personable, incredibly efficient, and attentive. He was our server the first time we dined here, and he made us want to come back. Whenever we dine here, we specifically ask to be seated at one of Daniel's tables. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the rest of the wait staff. There are a lot of servers that seem to move around a lot but not do much. On multiple occasions we've been seated and no one even came to greet us for 15 minutes to give us water or take our drink orders. They then took quite a while to come back to take our orders. The service bothers me basically every time I come here, which is a shame because there is so much to like. All in all, I'd still recommend Vic's, but the service really leaves much to be desired. The food makes it worth dealing with.",1

Anthony was our waiter and he was great! Very attentive, personable, and knocked it our of the park with recommendations. To start we ordered the carrot appetizer. If all carrots tasted like this I'd eat more veggies - so good! My boyfriend ordered the skirt steak (recommended by Anthony). It was so flavorful I wish I could scoop up the chimichurri and take it home. I ordered the borsa pasta and it left a little to be desired on flavor. I could taste the lemon, fennel, and hazelnut but it was all so subtle nothing stood out and instead they were washed out. The place is very beautiful and wonderful for a date night or large groups.",

Updated review",26,,"New York, NY",Gina F.,252,3.0,260,"Lots of good things to say about Vic's: the location, the ambiance, the service. Welcome for drinks and really always enjoy it. However brunch really missed the mark. Again, the setting was really nice and always is and of course NYC crowded but the food... everything was just mediocre. Little gem salad was so overdressed, the frittata despite being garnished with fresh herbs just didn't quite hit the mark. It also included some type of Parmesanish, mayoish sauce that didn't add anything but a heaviness. Was disappointed all around. Interesting enough, everything coming out of the kitchen looked really good. Go figure.",

The food is outrageously good. Don't judge by what the menu says. Who would think corn or carrots could be amazing! The reason the food is so remarkable is that the chef is fantastic about pairing ordinary foods with spices and herbs and making them extraordinary. Come here and try everything. Trust me.,1

Love this establishment.The egg dishes were delicious.  The pizza was good (though not sure my flavors went together for the egg white fritatta - didn't want goat cheese so substitute fresh mozzarella - forgot to take a picture.).  The appetizers were good too.Overall we had great service from our waitress, Barbara, and folks checked on us to make sure we were alright.  She refilled our water bottles.  The only hiccup is the missing side of bacon which she brought and the cucumber soda (which she took off the bill).  We had a great time.  As for the new mom, she was very happy that there is a bench downstairs outside the bathroom to change the baby.  Things we don't think until it is needed.  One of my Yelp friends mentioned the flamingo wallpaper in the bathroom so cute.  Yes, I had to take a picture of the flamingo wallpaper.  Thank you to Vic's employee for taking a lovely group picture.  We don't get enough group pictures when we get together.Sorry to the establishment for disturbing the other patrons with my surprised yelp, when my friend pinched my arm to try to yank the bill from me after I plucked the bill from her.  She (the new mom wanted to pay the whole amount -- no way!) needlessly to say didn't get the bill so we split the bill.",

As a matter of fact there was nothing in it at all except greens.  Odd.  Oh well.   One person got the crispy chicken salad, one got the grilled chicken salad and one person got the frittata.  Everyone liked their dishes.

It's amazing how many vegetables are name-dropped on their menu.We were looking for some light Italian on a chilly Sunday night and Vic's was more than fine. The room was perfectly vibe-y with low lighting, and the atmosphere worked even though the room wasn't very full around 6 pm. Service was extremely polite and on-top-of-it. We were in and out in less than an hour. It's a smooth operation.I went for the borsa (""little purse,"" similar to ravioli) stuffed with ricotta and garnished with a squeeze of lemon and crushed hazelnuts. There was a healthy pool of butter and a sprinkling of parmesan. I wouldn't normally like such a rich dish but this was perfect. My boyfriend had a fennel, dill, and red pepper pasta salad and liked it. We must have paid about $20 each when all was said and done.Also, shout out to the bathroom with its carved pink flamingo walls. Wish I had brought my phone with me.",2

Vic's is not a bad place per se, but we came here with fairly high expectations and felt that our overall experience here ranged between 'marginally above average' to kinda bad at different times.The space is done up in a modern-yet-rustic style and makes it feel like an inviting, friendly spot. Our server too was friendly and explained a lot of the dishes on the menu well to us. Unfortunately, the food did not quite live up to the hype and lacked in execution what it promised in concept.For appetizers we had the Garlic Bread which was a huge slice of bread soaked in butter with little garlic flavor, the straciatella which was rich and tasty, and the crispy sweet onions which were covered with too much parmesan and served with a sharp cheese sauce. For mains we tried the sedanini with ragu which was good though a bit one-dimensional, the seafood pasta and the margherita pizza which were alright, and the much talked-about 'borsa' which was too sweet and came with a sauce that was just too buttery and rich. We skipped dessert after the underwhelming main courses.For a place that apparently leans healthy, it sure seemed to be quite heavy-handed with the butter. There's a ton of other Italian options in the city and this makes Vic's a very passable spot in my book.",1

Came here for a Christmas dinner last weekend and it was so pretty and festive in there, with all the Christmas decorations. Service was on point too. Our waitress was amazing, wish I remember her name! She was so lovely and patience with us when it came to ordering and answering our questions on the menu. Wonderful staff there for sure. Now the food, unfortunately I was not impressed. Neither were my friends. We got the garlic bread, bruschetta, and the Borsa ""little purse pasta"" to share and each got our own entrees. The garlic bread was not what we expected, super thick hard piece of bread. There was a ton of butter but don't taste the garlic at all. Then for the bruschetta, two pieces of toast, half was burnt black. I don't understand why that was served. Then the little purse pasta, great presentation but was not what we expected and taste pretty bland. For entree, I got the tonnarelli pasta (with clams). Pasta was undercooked and overall dish was quite salty. I was drinking water with every bite. For dessert, we ordered 3 different desserts to try and wasn't a fan of any. Everything was just so sweet and not special at all.",1

Conversations can be contained to your seating area and you don't smell what your neighbors eat or get to silently judge their conversations. The service was also amazing. The waitress was extremely patient, attentive and helped us pick our food with some very insightful answers. The food however was a different story. The theme of the food was ""lets use all the butter!"". The garlic bread was extremely disappointing - swimming in unnecessary quantities of butter and suffering from acute garlic deficiency. I had the purse ravioli and this was also very disappointing. The other appetizer was the fried onions - this was just fried onions served with a cheesy creamy sauce. There was no flavor - just cheese in a pasta purse served in what was mostly butter. I got a free birthday dessert with a candle on top so that was nice! Overall great service and ambiance but one of the most disappointed I've ever been with respect to the food flavors.",

Friends ordered the lamb burger, baked egg, some pulled meat, and a basil salad grain side. Forgive me for not being more specific as I was busy tasting all the dishes & helping to entertain 2 young ones so mummy & daddy can eat too.  The food was very good. Personally, I felt everything had a peppery taste to it.  Not being a fan of spicy-yes, pepper is spicy to me-I noticed this right away.",

Large, clean open space with lighting that's just right. Food is exceptional and full of delicious twists. Start with the heritage carrots, roasted, sweet, tender and flavorful with shallots and capers (just the right amount). Don't miss the salt roasted sweet potatoes with horseradish and dill... and also a few capers. Best pasta on the menu is cacio e pepe, black pepper, pecorino and parmigiano. Creamy with a kick. The pasta was  perfectly cooked. Also try the roasted chicken with charred broccoli, spring onions, fingerlings, chiles and basil. Moist with a crisp outside. We made room to share the chocolate mascarpone torta, with salted caramel, blood orange and pistachios. Perfect blend of sweet, salty and creamy chocolate with a nutty crunch. Service was superb (thanks, Maggie!). Plus the prices are very reasonable. Thanks to Lawrence for steering us to a memorable meal.",1

If I lived around the corner I might frequent this joint for its fresh food, within reason prices and casual ambience. But, it's not a place I'd travel exclusively for if i didn't live in the neighborhood.Here's what's great about Vic's brunch: * they take reservations (not a lot of places downtown take reservations for brunch)* staff is polite and gets things right * draft iced coffee is delicious and perks you right up* brunch menu is non traditional and more California farm to table style* we ordered - grilled chicken/greens, egg greens & grains, draft iced coffee, Bloody Mary. Everything was good though the egg greens and grains salad needed something - maybe salt? It was a bit bland and over run with grains.Here's what's not great about Vic's brunch: * it's quite loud during peak hours. We dined at 1pm on a Saturday. You need to yell a bit to have a conversation with someone at your table * the main dining area decor is blah - ask to be seated in the skylit area near the kitchen * the food is overall good but it's not a game changer.",3
23,,8/10/2018,192,,"New York, NY",Janet L.,25,3.0,28,"I had the Calabrian spicy crispy chicken with the spicy sauce on the side. It was a large amount of chicken, a small amount of vegetables, and no carb to balance out the flavor/heaviness of the fried chicken. The spicy sauce is oil-based and tasty (like a Spanish version of Xi'an Famous Foods' chili oil), but definitely super spicy--wouldn't have been able to eat my meal if I didn't get the sauce on the side. I just dipped a piece in occasionally.The main reason for my rating is that the chicken was very, very rubbery and tough. There were maybe a few smooth bites, but most of it had a gross texture that was only tolerable because of the fried coating. I would not get this dish again, and I don't plan to go to Vic's again unless circumstances force me to.",1
24,3,4/9/2018,114,,"Nashville, TN",Rory M.,940,5.0,315,"Vic's is a perfect Italian hotspot for a sexy, Italian dinner. The place was crowded on a Saturday night, even at our 9:45 reservation time. We were blessed with our seating: we had a 4-person double booth to ourselves, which was super cozy and let us feel a bit isolated from the crowds, which heightened the mood. The service and food were 5-stars across the board. All of the food was irresistible, and is described below. Our waitress was a doll - she checked in on us at all the right times, provided the BEST suggestions, and was a pleasure!STRACCIATELLA // This dish took our breath away. I've showed the photo of it to just about everyone I've encountered since this meal. When we asked for suggestions and our waitress started describing this dish, we didn't even let her finish before shouting ""YEP, WE'LL HAVE THAT."" We knew it sounded good, but when it arrived to our table and then touched our lips, we were blown away. One of the best dishes I've ever had, ever. It's served as a loaf of warm and soft bread, cut into slices, and then smothered in ""stracciatella"" which is basically, as our waitress put it, ""the inside of burrata"". I've found I've lately been disappointed with burrata dishes, but this did not skimp out on any of the cheese. Each slice of bread was covered from crust to crust, in a thick, gooey, cheesy layer of this delicacy, and then topped with garlic, pecorino, and lemon. I know it's wild to say a ""cheesy bread"" dish is refreshing, but it somehow was. We've been talking about this dish non-stop, and decided the next time we're both in NYC, we will stop in for this dish, regardless if we have other dinner plans. So, yeah, I liked this dish, and yeah, I would recommend it. Can you tell? ROASTED SUNCHOKES // These tender sunchokes were atop a creamy and refreshing pistachio yogurt and flavored with mint. This simple veggie dish was the perfect complement to the heavier dishes we had ordered. KALE // A very simple side. Just kale sautéed in garlic. It basically tasted like all of the spinach in any Italian chicken dish, but with kale. Not a bad thing, just a new take on the staple, and an easy way to get greens into your diet. MALFADE // After the heavy (but INSANELYGOOD) cheesebread situation, we decided it'd be best if we simply split one large pasta dish. Our waitress suggested the malfade. Well, apparently I'm not the pasta connoisseur I thought I was, because I had never heard of this type of noodle, nor seen it. It was such a fun noodle! It's long, ribbon-style noodles, with whimsical wavy edges! This dish included pieces of delicious, tender duck, and was seasoned with sage. The pasta was cooked to al-dente perfection! Although it seemed like we couldn't eat any more, we had to have something sweet to end our meal. We ordered the TOASTED NUT GELATO, and were also served two rainbow cookies. The complementary rainbow cookies are a nice, unique touch at the end of the meal. What a fun surprise!!!Yes, this is a place I will be quick to return too when I am back in the big apple!",

I also got the borsa pasta. I think the pasta was Home made which has that unique softer texture. Still delicious but thought it could've been a little more fun of a dish. They have outdoor as well as indoor seating which is good to know.,

Great flavor and simple dish-tomatoes: again rly rly fresh dusted with cheese (parm?)-crispy onions: one of my FAVE dishes of the night. Great seasoning and rly crispy. It's a good size to share as well. I'd come back for this dish!Main -borasa: def a richer cheesy dish. Plated rly well and comes in 10 ish or so pieces. -rigatoni: my other FAVE dishes of the night. Really flavorful with the fresh basil and rich with pieces of pancetta. -bufala pizza: rly thin thin pizza. Baked to almost like a cracker. The crust was great and salted well. I haven't rly tasted a lightly salted crust like this one!Dessert-chocolate taste: like a chocolate cheesecake in a way. Very decadent and topped with caramel and with some peanuts tossed in. -rainbow Italian cookie: really great almond flavor!The staff was great!! Our dishes were spaced out perfectly and our waitress was attentive. I had a great time with my two gfs and got to catch up throughout the night. The restaurant feels very new but the chefs seem like they've been doing this for a while :) ! Def would recommend to friends and would drop by again.,

The restaurant had balloons all over, and they were still decorated from the Holidays. For dinner, we split a bunch of different items from the menu. We had the borsa pasta, the bolognese and the sopressata pizza. It was all delicious! The borsa pasta was my favorite because it's a type of pasta that you don't see very often and it was a good mix between a ravioli and a stuffed shell. The pizza was my second favorite because the sauce was SO GOOD!Our waitress was very helpful and tentative, and the ambiance was fabulous. The food is a bit pricey, but that is what you get when you go to the city. In addition, it is great that they had the full menu instead of a pre- fixed one. Overall, my meal was great and I would recommend this to a friend!",1

You can tell the ingredients are of high quality which is great but this places fails in terms of price and portions. I'm not someone who wants huge plates but I also don't want to order steak and get four pieces for $28 dollars (Goto STK where you get an amazing 16 oz. for $29). Still though, the steak here tasted great. For the Service: Not good at all. Maybe it was just our waitress but we received our food before drinks came out...makes sense right? I think not.

No real explanation was given other than that they were ""printing"", waitstaff was pretty scarce so we couldn't even ask for an updated timeline. Fried onions were delicious and pizza was tasty... my main however was not properly described on the menu - I ordered the shell pasta which was listed with mozzarella when in fact it came stuffed with ricotta.

Because I have no time for ""greens,"" I requested they be put directly in the trash. The welcome excess of fontina cheese, a perfectly oozy egg, and homemade pesto on that lightly crisped roll is almost too much to remember in detail because I fear I might pass out from its absence in my life at this moment.

40,,9/20/2018,0,,"Metuchen, NJ",K E.,36,3.0,19,"My husband & I chose Vic's b/c it was close by to where we were shopping, it had a $$ rating, + it was classified as Italian food. Our reservation was for 12:30pm. The dining room decor was very attractive & inviting. Each table was nicely set with a water and wine glass I immediately noticed there was a sunlit room at the back of the restaurant which allowed natural light to enter the main dining room. I also noticed there was a  brick oven in that back room. I suspected it may have contributed to the lack of a/c in the dining room. The menu wasn't as extensive as I expected for an Italian restaurant. There was also a meager number of alcoholic beverages on the menu. I mentioned it to our server, & she presented a separate wine list. The number of wine selections was adequate, but most bottles were priced well above what I expected for a restaurant rated as $$. We selected a bottle of Sicilian red wine that was priced at $48 (which was toward the low end of the range). It was certainly not the best wine I've had at this price point, but it was drinkable. We went directly to ordering our entrees since none of the appetizers were attractive to us (not even the roasted blowfish tails). I ordered the entree called ""Calabrian Chili Crispy Chicken"" which was described to me as boneless chicken coated in rice flour and cooked in a spicy chili oil. Topping was a purple lettuce cousin to endive called ""treviso"", along with fennel and caraway. No starch came with this entree so I ordered Yukon gold potatoes as a side. My husband ordered the broiled Sea Scallops entree. It also came with no side, so he shared the potatoes with me. I have to say that the presentation of the chicken entree was excellent. Very colorful and interesting appearance (see photo). I love spicy food, and the Calabrian dish definitely delivered heat but I could barely taste anything else. Only 4 scallops on my husband's plate - which looked lonely, so shared 1/2 of my chicken with him. Bill was $104 which was pricey (for lunch). Not happy about that!!",
41,,5/27/2018,3,,"Manhattan, NY",Kevin W.,0,3.0,21,"This was my first time at Vic's and I went for brunch on a cloudy Sunday afternoon. I had the baked eggs and my two friends had the baked eggs as well and the brisket sandwich. We started off with the scone and garlic bread, both of which were baked and prepared to perfection. The entrees were a little slow coming out and the pacing could have been improved upon. The food was great overall, although my friend's brisket sandwich was a bit too greasy- so much so that the bottom of his bun basically turned into an inedible sponge. The part that was the most disappointing, however, was the service. Once our food arrived we did not see our waitress again for almost 30 minutes. This is not a joke. She didn't stop by our table, check-in, or anything. We finished eating and had to wait 10 minutes just to flag her down. When she finally did come by we requested the check, which she promptly brought over, however, it then took her another 10 minutes to pick it up. The food was good but for the price, the service needs to be stepped up. The level of inattentiveness was more than just annoying, it got to the point of being perceived as downright unprofessional and borderline rude. I'm more than happy to drop $35 per person for brunch but if I'm going to pay that, I expect better service.",1

The place had great upbeat music on the background, so a chill cool spot for a date or dinner/brunch with friends.The place was packed on a Monday night leading into the holidays. Would advise to reserve ahead.Our waitress, Niall (sp? only Brazilian there), was really nice. When we asked about different plates she was very knowledgeable and unbiased. Felt she led us to choose great things. I would have ordered the entire menu, everything looked amazing.We had:- Shaved cabbage, bulgur, seeds, chili, anchovy basil ($11): Shared this as an appetizer. Delicious, a bit spicy which I loved. If you are not into dressings, ask them to make it light. But the dressing is probably the best of this dish.- Tomato, basil, mozzarella, pecorino pizza ($16): Bf had this. I tried it and was delish, he finished the whole thing (even ate the borders which he had left at first lol)- Roasted chicken, charred broccoli, baby onions, fingerlings, chilies, basil ($26): How not to love this one! Half chicken was cooked to perfection (moisty, but well done). Charred broccoli was delish!- Semifreddo, honey and honey almonds ($11): the ice cream was not very cold, but I loved this dessert anyways. Super creamy and perfect touch with Crispy almonds.We found a gem in their wine list. I'm not giving it away, I'll leave you the challenge to spot it! Last time I wrote about my favorite wine at a restaurant, then they run out and didn't have it anymore. Cocktail list seems amazing as well.Need to go back to try their brunch.

Vic's was certainly not those high-end places, yet it was a better spot for some comfort food with friends.If you are a big fan of Cookshop, or A Voce, then you should be pretty familiar with Vic's. With pasta and house-made thin crust pizza as their signatures, my friend and I decided to share the crab fregola. The garlic helped a lot bring up the flavor, while the crab meat made it more ""meaty"", thus, more fulfilling. We also enjoyed the garlic bread and the fried baby squid. Great portion too, so that we could give a try on many dishes. We shared the honey semifreddo with crunchy almond, as well as the chocolate bombollini. Not a big chocolate fan myself, I found it quite difficult to appreciate the warm bombollini, yet my friend loved it. I personally liked the semifreddo more, especially with the yummy almond pieces spreading around. A solid spot if you crave some simple Italian food and do not wish to drop $$$. Great value.",14

50,,5/4/2018,34,1,"White Plains, NY",Saul G.,84,4.0,738,"Review of a Sunday brunch in late April.Service was excellent throughout - the host's time estimate was spot on and we were seated at a comfortable booth. Unlike a lot of downtown establishments, Vic's seems to have put some thought into customer experience - the booths are spacious with good lighting, the tables seem to be large and well spaced, the bathrooms nice.That generosity of spirit extended to water - still or sparkling dispensed for free and well refilled.I began with a Garibaldi, a Campari/blood orange cocktail that was fine. The Bloody Marys I spied going by may have been a better choice. My companion found her selection of Ribiero too dry, fortunately she was offered a taste first and she swapped it for a Riesling.First courses, although tasty, proved a slight let down. The pizza bianca was delicious but the portion size was too small for $13 -  less food than a slice of Ray's. The cabbage salad was too reminiscent of slaw. I don't recall much bulgur. Maybe we would have fared better with our first choice, the Jerusalem artichokes, but they had sold out.I had no quarrel with the portion size of my brisket sandwich, which came topped with caramelized onions. It was juicy and savory, although I could not tell whether they were aiming for Texas style or bubby style. The mixed green salad that came with it was perfectly dressed and I didn't miss fries or chips. The feinschmecker's spicy Calabrian chicken was also a winner, with a nice crunch, and the grilled chicken over a composed salad with broccoli hit the spot with my companion, who was looking for something lighter. She might have liked a bit more chicken.The Montepulciano also being sold out, I had a glass of a more obscure Italian red wine with round 2, and enjoyed it. The wine is not listed on the online menu, so I cannot identify it for you precisely.For dessert we shared the chocolate mascarpone torta, which had a good flavor of cheese shining through the chocolate.Overall, almost a five star experience. Call it a 4.4.",

Borsa is a purse MADE OF PASTA filled with HAZELNUT, BUTTER, AND CHEESE. Yeah you read that right. They decided to stick the three richest, fattiest foods in there and then put these pasta wonders in a pool of butter without giving you any warning about what's going to ensue in your mouth. Once I put that bad boy to my lips, I started getting dizzy and my eyes popped out of my head for I could not handle the richness of the dish. My life flashed before my eyes and I thought it was all over. All in all those little pasta purses really fucked me up and I haven't been back since because I don't know if I'm ready for it. Are you?

This place is almost hidden between the mass urban jungle that is the Bowery/Noho area, but once you step inside, you feel as if you're in a garden some place abroad. The decor is comforting and light and welcomes you. I sat at the bar and the super sweet bartender immediately introduced herself, gave me a menu, and offered me a drink. Because I was in a bit of a rush, I quickly scanned the menu and selected the Baked Eggs, which seemed super interesting and delicious. Within fifteen minutes, the piping hot dish came out of the oven and as I waited to cool down, I was entranced by how lovely the presentation and the size of the meal. Once the food was at an edible temperature (took quite a while to be honest), I got to enjoy the rich tomato taste, mixed with the creaminess of the ricotta and the balance of the baked eggs. Definitely an interesting meal and something I never would have thought of, but everything worked in its favor. Scrumptious! Can't wait to stop by again and try some of their dinner options.",
53,,4/29/2018,1,,"Brooklyn, NY",Cherie E.,12,3.0,53,"Disappointing. The food is good, there's no denying that. But between it being overpriced and the service being subpar, I don't think I'd come back. The wine I ordered was $17. The waitress came back to tell me they had run out of that wine. Instead of offering a comparable wine for the same price, she brought back the menu and tried pushing a $30 wine on me, that tasted nothing like the one I initially ordered. I found that very unprofessional. We ordered the fried onions (was good but a few pieces tasted like cologne, *puke*), crispy potatoes, tomato pizza, and a large cacio e pepe. All very tasty. Even though every table had a bread basket, we didn't make the cut. Yes, we could've asked for some, but I'm of the opinion that you should never have to ask for something you're supposed to receive. Anyway...we inquired about the difference between the 2 sizes of the cacio e pepe ($12 vs $19). Of course, we were pushed to order the ""large"" size, with the waitress insinuating we weren't ordering enough food and pushing additional random dishes. The ""large"" pasta was pretty small, smaller than the small size the table next to us ordered... explain that one. If you're already charging nearly $20 bucks for the most basic pasta, at least make it worth my while. There was still tons of food and we had lots left over (so much for not ordering enough)  but I was just annoyed and felt like we were getting taken advantage of and ripped off.

Crispy sweet onions and chocolate torta were highlights for me. The pasta was delicious if you like ricotta, the pizza sauce and bread were really yummy but I felt the burrata was nothing special. It's definitely a lot of food for three, a group of three could definitely make do with one less appetizer and one less dessert if you're not famished.

Vic's is great for a group, birthday or celebration, parents, vegetarians, sharing plates. We started with several appetizers: eggplant caponata, crispy sweet onions, whipped pecorino, and marinated cherry tomatoes. Each of the dishes was amazing on their own but they all complimented each other well too. The onions were my favorite and came with a parmiganio dip. OMG SO GOOD. For mains, we shared the buratta pizza, cacio e pepe, borsa, tagliatelle, roasted chicken, steak, occhi. While all of the dishes were awesome, don't miss out on the borsa and the occhi pastas. Borsa was creamy and light, and the occhi is served in a rockstar pesto. We initially looked at the dessert menu and didn't think anything sounded good (because we didn't know what anything was), but have your waiter or waitress describe the dishes. It's actually pretty solid. The honey semifreddo didn't really taste like anything so I wouldn't get it again. The chocolate torta was odd so also wouldn't order that. But the bomboloni (giant donut holes) were FAB and in a chocolate sauce. Yum.Service was great, waitress made the dinner really fun and we never felt rushed.

Came here on Saturday night with a reservation for 5 at 8:30. We arrived 10 minutes late and the table was ready for us right away. We ordered our drinks from our server, Brinley, and that was probably the last time we saw her. Her name being Brinley should have been an indication of how poor the service would be from her. It was almost none existing. All the bussers were very attentive though and got us what we needed which is why I'm giving it four instead of three. We finished our drinks before our food came out and she did not come around until mid eating to see if we wanted another drink. She could have got more rounds out of us but she just was not on top of it. The drinks were really great. I had a wonderful old fashion that the bartender made with rye for me. Also had a glass of Lambrusco with my meal that wasn't overly sweet. The food was wonderful too. They had a lot of fried food on the menu but we were indulging so no one minded. I tried the Brussel sprouts, fried onions, the rapini pizza, the crispy squid, the cacio e Pepe, and the crispy cod. Everything had heat to it. The cacio e Pepe was the right amount of decadent. I loved the peppers with the crispy squid. My favorite was the fried onions. The dipping sauce with them was so good I ended up dipping my pizza crust in it too. Food and drinks were great just wish Brinley's attentiveness could have matched the rest of the place. Also the bathrooms have my favorite flamingo wallpaper so that was a plus.",

Would come back to enjoy just that.I ordered the basil Bloody Mary drink and will note that I added their hot sauce to make it spicy enough to my liking. Wish there had been less ice and more Mary, but that's wishful thinking.Our meal was nothing short of great! We ordered a lemon bar for the table to share (a special today that our waitress talked up). YUM! Not too sweet and just the right note to end the meal on and share.I ordered the brisket sandwich with no bread and it was delicious! I added a lot of hot sauce bc I was in the mood for spice but the meat was very tender  and the potatoes were tasty as well.Split evenly among the group it was a very reasonable meal.

Updated review",351,1,"New York, NY",Laurel F.,544,5.0,255,"I went back to Vic's, but this time for dinner and I was still blown away! Loved the service, atmosphere, and especially the food! My cousins and I enjoyed some nice wine, along with the roasted cauliflower ($14) and crispy baby squid ($13) appetizers. Both were super delicious. One of the best Calamari dishes I've ever had. The sauce was both spicy and tangy, mouth watering!For my meal, I got the half size portion of the cacio e pepe pasta ($11). A very simple pasta dish, but jam packed with flavor. Rich cheese and pepper seasoning. Definitely recommend. We finished with sharing 2 desserts ($10 each): the chocolate mascarpone torta and the bombolini. Both were amazing, but I would have to say the bombolini was a tad better. The bombolini came with 5 light sugar powdered donuts covered in chocolate sauce. The perfect end to a perfect meal!",2

I wish our waiter had asked which portion size we wanted because we forgot to mention it while ordering and it was too late to change it by the time we remembered. Nevertheless, the purses were really good, but very rich (I really wish we had the smaller size). And the cacio was solid as well.",

Giant portion and it comes on a bed of wonderfully spicy veggies-nero old fashioned drankThings you should do:-Ladies: check out the bathroom-Make a reservation.

I yelped upon this gem when I the city for a conference and was delighted to find one last seat at the bar since there was no table available at 7 on a Wednesday. I had the little purse pastas - these were like eating little pillows of heaven. Divine. I started with the toast and goat butter - admittedly something I had never tried. If I had died eating that toast with fingers dropping from the sweet goodness I would have died sated and happy. I had the wonderful pleasure of sitting at the edge of the bar where a new server was studying the wine list and sampling wines. I offered my perspective and so enjoyed a lively wine tasting with my meal. By the time dessert rolled around I was stuffed. But they treated me to an on the house Italian cookie/cake slice that was delicious and just the right amount of sweet. Paired with a cappuccino, I was delighted when I left to head back to my hotel and sleep with a full belly.",

It made me wanna explore more of the inside. i find it odd that the host stand is in the middle of the restaurant, but whatever.The host was easy and nice. I told him I wanted to sit at the bar. I obviously came in on a slow moment. The energy was low, I ordered a gin and tonic and they use this bolyan tonic that is DELICIOUS, no joke like best gin and tonic I gave ever had. I order the pasta Fergola (which was small dot rolls of pasta) it was so light in weight but had such a strength in opposite flavor parodies, that made it rugged and raw. I knew I was eating seafood but my taste buds thought it was a gambler of tomato and meats, it was superb. I had a taste of white wines the bartender let me do because it was slow, I love the ""ooo--orridta"" Cant remember the name but it was white peach  and rosemary bodied, it was amazing. Then I have a a ford's gin martin that was a london dry flavor, it was amazing , with olives, it was amazing as well. Then I had THE LITTLE NECKS which to be honest is a perfect entree. Its little neck clams steamed with peppers and garlic flakes, in a broth, over a pizza bread. IT WAS INSANELY GOOD! Like I will have dreams over that dish. Its amazing. Then I wanted sparkling and they had Lambrusco, which I LOVE. the perfect end of meal wine. It was amazing, super crisp with herb notes and no finish. It was a dream. Food dream. I would totally come back. Im interested in the twists. The food is so lively and personable, and the drink selection is curated very well. Its a nice balance. Such respect. Love.",1

Updated review",0,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Tim B.,0,2.0,16,I went there last night for dinner with a friend and was very disappointed with our meal.First I ordered the garlic bread which I have had before and love and when I got it was covered with some lemon butter cheese sauce.  No sign of garlic anywhere to be found.  I believe that was the sauce that should have gone on my borsa.I ordered the bursa also and found it missing the sauce that was poured over the supposed garlic bread and not having the good flavor I loved so much.Our server never came around to see if we wanted more wine or anything except to see if we wanted desert and when she gave  us the menus to took my wine glass without asking if I wanted more???!Was very shocked and disappointed how the food was last night.  I usually love this place and maybe it was a bad night I don't know.,
72,,12/8/2017,1,,"New York, NY",Emily B.,1,5.0,21,"If I could give this place 10 out of 5 stars I would.  I went here for my birthday on a Thursday around 9 pm and the place was packed.  I would definitely recommend making a reservation to avoid the 30 minute wait time.For food my friend and I ordered the heirloom carrots which were the most unhealthy carrots I've ever tasted and I say that as the highest compliment possible.  We also ordered the crispy onions, and let me just tell you your life will actually change after you have these.  Whether you're starving or not, there is room in your stomach for these. PLEASE order them and use all that cheese sauce they give you to dip them in.  For entrees my friend and I both got the full order of the cacio e pepe.  We weren't able to finish the portions, but wow I tried my best to keep moving because it was some of the best pasta I've had in New York.  If you're not starving, definitely order the half size as the full was quite large, but if you're okay with having some leftovers to enjoy the next day then the full is great.  Aside from the amazing and reasonably priced food, I haven't had this great of service in a long time.  Everyone was so kind and attentive for our entire dining experience.  Our waitress, Erin, was incredible and so sweet to us and definitely made my first experience at Vic's what it was.  We sat in the back by the open kitchen, and when we stood up to leave I got a happy birthday from all the chefs. Everyone went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our time.  It was truly an unforgettable dining experience, and I highly highly recommend going to Vic's to satisfy your next pasta craving.",

There were moments were I was thinking ""What is taking so long"" which isn't a good sign. The food was also just fine. Pastas were standard. The crab pasta was very confusing. I'm not sure what they're going for with that. The Pizzas were standard too. All in all, there are numerous restaurants I would select over Vic's. Nothing is great or terrible, just yea..... They also own Rosie's a few blocks away which is equally meh.",
74,1,4/11/2017,7,,"Las Vegas, NV",Sheena W.,73,4.0,48,"We were planning to go to a different restaurant but they told us that they weren't serving pasta at the moment. We walked out and overheard us talking about pasta and recommended us to come here. It's a pretty big restaurant and it wasn't hat filled when we went. The food came out in probably 15 minutes or so and the service was alright. I liked that they gave you an option of sparkling or distilled water without any surcharge. The sparkling was pretty good. The food was different. Maybe it was just the things that we ordered, but it was interesting. We ordered cod which was fried, carrots which were delicious, garlic bread with goat cheese, and pasta (which I forget the name of) which wasn't the usual noodley pasta. My favorite was the carrot which was grilled and soft. I don't really know how to describe the flavors but it was definitely unique. Not in a bad or good way, just different.",

I was sad but decided the promise of rigatoni was alluring.  Good red wine + rigatoni in tomato sauce = my kind of Sunday night jam.Bar tender asks for my id... (mind you I don't usually get carded at restaurant as I'm well over 30)... and in my senility of course I left it next to the shoe bench.Being the fatty that I am, I was not going to walk home empty stomached.  I ordered the pasta and no wine but I was pretty upset.  It was the kind of anger that consumes you.   The kind when you open the freezer to reach for that pint of new ice cream you had just bought and were looking forward to all week to sit down and devour, but your sister eats it and leaves the empty container so you don't realize until you pick it up. It's called HANGER.Worse, being the old fart that I am, I don't play with my phone during meals.  No surfing on the phone, no instagram, just darting glares at those bottles strategically placed in front of my bar seat, laughing back at me.But mind you, the pasta was worth the wait and the awkward silence.  In the ten minutes it took for me to finish the dish, my perspective had changed from being annoyed that I would have to start another 60+ hr week with no wine to wind down, bitter my weekly ritual was broken, to I should be thankful the bartender thinks I'm his age and I look at least a decade younger.  Going forth, I'll try to act like it.I'm sipping on the rose I had chilling in the fridge while I write this.  Cheers.",1

Baked eggs - you can sop up the tomato sauce with some pieces of bread right after eating the baked eggs and you're good to go. So...yeah it's quite good.3. Some of the drinks. Bloody Mary's here are great - quite salty, but it looks 'stumpy'. V stout. heavy. decorated with salt. Incredible. hit it.",

If it's not showing up in a cheese wheel (the latest trend I can get behind), it better have something else unique about it. The Cacio E Pepe here was very mediocre, but luckily there's a lot else going on for this restaurant.Although I'm quite the carnivore, I found the menu to be mostly veggie and cheese forward so I decided to go with it. The appetizers were amazing, especially the roasted carrots and onions (which came with this amazing cheese dipping sauce). We also enjoyed the garlic toast with goat butter as a starter. The pizza's and pastas were all decent but not out of this world. I loved the ricotta pockets (basically little bites of melted cheese), but would have liked there to be more pieces.The ambiance and overall service of this place are great, which make it worth coming back.",

Updated review",93,,"Manhattan, NY",Rachael F.,46,4.0,235,"Absolutely a great meal.The Roasted Zucchini ($13) with peppers, oregano, and bread crumbs were prepared as well as any such dish I've expereinced. In terms of Antipasti, I'd highly, highly recommend the Burrata ($16) with garlic lemon toast (mmm), charred fava leaves, thyme, and lemon. As far as pastas go, the Cacio E Pepe ($11/$18) with black pper, pecorino, and parigiano is nothing short of scrumptious.There's a solid drink/wine list, though I must say they did bring one of us the wrong drink (a mistake they quickly corrected). Otherwise, the service was top-notch. Everything was brought promptly, the waitress was both knowledgeable and helpful, and even the busboys graced the restaurant with smiles.The ambiance lacks pretentiousness, though I wouldn't be surprised to see a celebrity here (I saw another Yelp user sat next to Seth Meyers recently). The bar area in the front is inviting and the main dining room, made up of both round tables and booths, is peppered with candles. It can play the role of romantic backdrop but also suits as a backdrop for a dinner with friends. Some seats have a view into the kitchen, something I always enjoy taking advantage of when it's an option (it wasn't).I'd recommend Vic's for any type of occasion and am sure it won't disappoint.",1
83,1,2/21/2017,255,1,"Chicago, IL",Anup R.,397,4.0,233,The service here was very good. The food and drinks themselves not bad but little overpriced and nothing was really too memorable for me. The Arctic char was cooked well with a good mix of side salad and potatoes but the char itself was tiny. The cacio e pepe was simple but had good flavor. Would be an amazing dish if some meat or veggie was added to it. The rosmarino drink tasted like a fancy lemonade. I couldn't really taste any alcohol which is either a good thing or bad thing. There was too much ice in the drink as well. I could have drank the whole thing in 15 seconds if I wanted to.,

Although mood lit with nice table settings they are ready for a tired and excited 2 year old with crayons ready and a table built for drawing on.We started with the garlic bread, very buttery and tangy, so tasty. Then we had the soppressata pizza which was really nice but did get a bit floppy towards the end (to be fair we were eating slow). The best dish was the ravioli with braised kale, I think this has got to be up with some of the best pasta I have had. I am not a kale guy but the slight crunch and different flavors were fantastic. My wife and I nearly ordered a second plate but realized we needed room for dessert.

The menu had a lot of egg options which worked out well for me. I ordered the Frittata and at $15.00 I thought it was a little pricey, even for Lower Manhattan.I was quite pleased when I saw my entree. The size of the Frittata was generous. The mix of nuts, squash and other veggies made it one of the tastier brunches I've consumed in quite some time.One star off, because I thought the waiter could have been more attentive.

89,1,5/14/2017,453,6,"Manhattan, NY",Danielle T.,0,5.0,113,"24 hours later, I'm still trying to calm my euphoria post-eating at Vic's. Vic's is better than most Michelin starred restaurants in this city. I had recently near given up on finding mind-blowing flavor in New York. After having some of the best food in the city (Eleven Madison, Aquavit, Atera, Jean Georges, Le Bernadin, Aska etc.), I was just trying to find some delicious food that wasn't so stuck-up. I felt like I had eaten my way through a bunch of sans serif-fonted restaurants with entrees in the $20-35 range with some version of expensive avocado toast or ""seasonal ingredients"" that made Sweet Green seem like a more flavorful and economic option. Getting good Thai food or BBQ started seeming more fun than the new gentrified ""Blah blah blah"" down the street. Then I found Vic's. On a rainy Saturday night, my friends were craving Italian and heard about this place called Vic's. It had availability and they weren't all, ""Hello, you're welcome"" on the phone (as most places are on a Saturday). Instead, we were greeted warmly and told, ""Yea! Stop on by!"" We didn't even arrive at the same time and we were seated -- none of this, ""your whole party has to be here"" bullshit. Immediately, I knew these people knew what was right. The place is stunning. An open kitchen, beautiful flowers of eucalyptus and ranunculus, stunning cherry branches. The lighting was reminiscent of brussel sprouts on a stalk. There was a wonderful symmetry about the place. Warm, but not cluttered, clean but not austere.  Everything looked delicious and I didn't expect it. I thought we were just getting ""Italian."" OMG. This was next level Italian. We wanted everything on the menu and the kind waiter helped us play our game of Tetris trying to squeeze in everything without busting a button. For starters, we had the wood fire oven roasted carrots with dill, capers, and some cracked out sauce that made me grip the table. We also had a lamb belly with watercress and rhubarb that could be cut with a spoon. Then, there was a pizza. This fucking pizza man. This little pizza bufala or whatever. NOM. We were sipping on a crazy good Nebbiolo and losing our brains over the lamb and carrots and before we knew it, we were on to the next. We got the porgy (a white fish) with some kind of chili sauce that rivaled as a better lover than some ex-boyfriends I've had -- it just made me feel so loved and special the way it melted in my mouth, a cacio e pepe that I had been all obnoxious about NOT ordering but then we did (""Why do you want just cheese and pepper pasta? So much looks better"" --- wow I was so wrong -- who knew a simple pasta could be so mind blowing), and finally this potatoes ravioli with tomatoes (that had been marinated and all this other fancy shit), marjoram that was ELECTRIFYING, and delicious cheese. Every bite was full of flavor and love. The spices were so fresh I was curious if they had just been picked. Finally, dessert. We opted for a gluten free torta with caramel, pistachios and orange, with some almond gelato on the side ($3--- who could say NO?!?!?) Plus a glass of Montenegro. WE WERE TRIPPING. I don't even like desserts but this dessert man was un believable I'm having a hard time not cursing out of joy right now. We were loving the food so much. The service so inviting, chill, clever, and genuinely having a good time helping us navigate this beautiful food that was more like manna or ambrosia. He was smart, kind, and there for us. He was taking us on a dance with food.  The bathrooms (the ladies at least) was full of textured flamingo wall paper that makes you just wanna sit and gaze a bit, overcoming the food you just had. The handsoap smelled good, but wasn't trying to prove anything (like some restaurants compensate for shit food with designer handsoap). To top it off, we spoke with the chef at the end. SHE was a brilliant woman who was so humble, chill, and appreciative of Italian food. Her attention to detail and description of the arduous efforts for the seemingly simplest of details made me rethink my life for a moment. She invited us back to chill in the kitchen in the future. She is an American gem. We left in better shape, as better people than we came. I'm definitely going back.",5

Now my friend and her dad are definitely the type that say 15 minutes and they are there 14 minutes and 37 seconds. In this case they were especially hungry so we were half an hour early for the reservation. We decided to hang around the bar and hope that a table opened up. The place was pretty packed especially for a Tuesday so we found ourselves hanging around until even past our reservation time by around 10 minutes. That's been pretty typical in my experiences so I don't really care. The manager was extremely apologetic and accommodating however and they even comped us a round of drinks which wasn't really necessary but great customer service.So with regards to the food: from what I chose this is definitely a ""I'm in hibernation mode"" type place aka idgaf about dat #summerbod2016 look quite yet. We got the goat butter bread (a MUST), the burrata, a side of kale and our respective appetizers. I went with the prosciutto pasta. It was good but extremely heavy given the oil and cream that took up much of the dish and flavor. I enjoyed it but could not finish it given how heavy it was. The pizza looked pretty amazing so I'll have to give that a try next time I swing by. I've recommended this place to a bunch of people.

Soppressata pizza was fantastic as well as the hot pepper and onion pie which was so unusual and incredible. The only problem here is the noise level.

The ratio of sauce to cheese was around 3:1, an overwhelming amount of red.. Unfortunately, the larger portion of the pizza, the sauce, was not good.

100,,7/8/2018,110,,"Chester Township, NJ",Carlos M.,0,5.0,7,I want to thank the other reviewers on yelp for Vic's. Based on the reviews I tried the restaurant out. The pizza was great and the onion appetizer was also amazing.  The atmosphere was great and the service was also superb.  I highly recommend it and certainly plan to come back.,
101,,1/11/2016,47,,"Westfield, NJ",Heather L.,243,4.0,165,"Checked this place out for my sister's birthday and was very pleased! First off, the place gets packed fast so be prepared to wait.  We sat in a comfortable booth with a good view of the open kitchen. The bar area looked a little cramped but luckily where we sat (near the back) which was open with a sort of barn-like vibe.Service was very attentive! They serve sparkling water at no extra charge which was nice. Our waiter was very talkative and did check in frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. They had good pacing between courses. And most importantly, our waiter overhead us talking about it being my sister's birthday and he served her gelato with a candle - even though we didn't tell him directly! For 3, we split 2 mercato dishes ($8-10) and 1 antipasti dish for appetizer. For the mercato dishes, we split the turnips and heirloom carrots - both of which were awesome.  The carrots were well seasoned and excellently cooked. Perhaps the best carrots I ever had. We also tried the burrata ($16) which was composed of leeks, thyme, black pepper, toast over some warm cheese.  Loved the sauteed leeks but it was a small portion and the cheese was sort of hard to cut. The whole dish didn't really feel worth the price.I got the appetizer portion of the mafalde ($13) for my main course, Mafalde is pasta with served with onions, prosciutto, caraway, and nutmeg.  Well seasoned, good flavor, and a innovative combination of flavors.  I had gotten the smaller portion which was still a good size; however, if  you don't get many appetizers or are hungry, I'd recommend the main size.  All in all, a great meal and highly recommended!",

103,,5/16/2017,26,,"Nashville, TN",Mary H.,19,4.0,52,"I went to Vic's with three friends with a dinner reservation around 8. The place was packed, but in a good, cozy, New York way. We ordered a bottle of prosecco ($40, not too bad between 4 people) and each had about 1.5 glasses.We split the goat cheese butter bread, which was AMAZING, and just enough for four people, but we each only had a fourth of the small slice portion. Luckily, we all got different menu items so I got to try a little bit of everything. I got small portion (plenty) of the cacio e pepe, which was a cheesy, romano coated spaghetti with black pepper -- good, but plain. My friends got the ravioli, the ricotta purses with hazelnuts (I think my favorite) and the spaghetti with ramps. Everyone loved what they ordered and had a fun time -- service was just attentive enough without being overbearing, but also helpful when needed. Too bad I was just visiting :(",1
104,2,3/22/2017,594,,"New York, NY",Jess C.,582,5.0,305,"This was my first time at Vic's, but I visited once for brunch when it was formerly Five Points, and ""ran into"" the hilarious Louis CK. (Okay I just creeped from the corner, we did not talk.) It's run by the same owners, and the dinner menu is certainly different (from the brunch menu I remember) with a focus on Italian-American cuisine. They did get rid of the gorgeous skylights and the little garden boxes, and it's got a more rustic, cavernous dining room feel.Anyways, this place was recommended to me as I was planning another large birthday dinner for 10 guests (tearful sob). After a quick email, our reservation was booked (see below for organizer details). We were seated in the middle of the restaurant with several tables pushed together.We ordered all the food to share. Unanimous favorites were the Cacio e Pepe (so simple, yet absolutely perfect!), Burrata (was a teensy small, but comes with garlic lemon toast!), Fried Onions with this cheesy sauce I did not touch (some things don't change), side of Brussel Sprouts (loved the chili with lemon) and the Borsa (""the Purse"" - half order had 5 mini cannoli-looking pastas with bursts of ricotta with each bite). I personally also really liked the bufala fresca pizza (so fresh!). The garlic bread with goat butter was pretty good (I still don't like goat) and the rapini pizza wasn't bad either!Drinks were also fabulous. A lot of the girls ordered the Aperol Spritz for a light drink, but I thoroughly enjoyed my Siciliano drink with mezcal (soo smokey yums), tequila, blood orange, chili, and lime. They also have a selection of mocktails (3) for your non-alc drinking friends.Service was delightful! It was initially pretty slow, we waited quite a while between ordering drinks and food, but we also never tried flagging them down, so they were probably giving us time to decide. Our servers were so sweet and patient, and never rushed us at any point. They brought out the cake at just the right time, and man, I wish we could have all the birthday dinners here!! Hope to be back soon, maybe for brunch too!Organizer deets:- For groups 10 or smaller, you can order a la carte. (If larger, they have prix fixe menus ranging from $55-75.) - No food or beverage minimum. - No cake cutting fee. - No tacked on gratuity for a large group. - No hassle of ""everyone must have arrived to be seated.""",3
105,,8/26/2016,18,,"Manhattan, NY",Kyle S.,563,4.0,86,"I went into Vic's last night for dinner-- Going in- I knew there was so much I wanted to try on the menu. First off, the space is really cute and our waitress was great. To start, we got the burrata and the crispy onions. (I really wanted to get the garlic bread, but it would have been too much food-- however, the burrata comes with two really buttery, delicious pieces of bread). The burrata is prepared with lemon and leeks and was really nice. I didn't know what to expect with the crispy onions, but kept seeing great reviews about them-- They definitely were not what I expected, but they were really tasty. They are coated with a crispy, parmesan-y crust.For our entrees-- We tried three of the pastas... Half orders. We got the Spaghetti Alla Chitarra, the Borsa and the Cacio e Pepe. I loved the Spaghetti- crab, mint, chilies. It was probably my favorite pasta of the night (and the half portion was plenty). The Borsa was also really nice- really great flavors- (The half order comes with 5 ""purses""). Okay-- so the Cacio... I have to say- I wasn't so impressed. First off, I think cacio should be made with buccatini or spaghetti-- not linguini. Also, it is such a simple pasta and works so well with fresh pasta. If they used the same spaghetti as they used for the crab pasta, it may have been a home run. Unfortunately, the cacio here doesn't compare to the cacio at Perla Cafe or I Sodi. Overall, I would be back. I had a really nice experience and the food was enjoyable for the most part. Also, the cocktail menu is pretty solid. I tried both of the vodka cocktails and enjoyed them both.",2
106,1,7/24/2016,334,1,"Manhattan, NY",Devonne C.,131,5.0,42,"No matter how good the food is, service remains such a big factor in your dining experience. After having dinner on Vic's patio tonight I would have to say that this was one of my best dining experiences in the past month. I'll gush about our wonderful server Brinley first and then tell you about the food. Brinley was very knowledgeable about various items on the menu, helping us pick popular options and was quick to fix anything that we needed. She was nice, so easy to talk to and attentive that it kept us in such a good mood throughout our meal.Now to the food at Vic's -- it's pretty great. For an appetizer we had the heirloom carrots and the turnips. Who would have thought that roasted carrots with capers and dill could be so good. They were well seasoned with the right amount of tang and char. In contrast, the turnips with pecorino, arugula and pine nuts were heavy. I thought crumbles of pecorino would be sprinkled on the dish, but instead there was a cream sauce smothering the turnips. I didn't care too much for this dish. For our second course we had the Soppressata pizza. My boyfriend told me this was the best pizza he's ever had and I'm inclined to agree. The tomato sauce was bright and tangy. It held up well to the salty soppressata covering the thin pizza bread. We added a little bit of chili oil to this which made it even more spicy. Our dinner course consisted of the roasted chicken and the half order of rigatoni with guanciale. The chicken was so flavorful. It was juicy, salty and a little spicy. The skin was crisped, adding an amazing contrast of texture. As the biggest broccoli fan, biting into thinly sliced pieces of broccoli, was a happy surprise. The rigatoni with thick pieces of guanciale was the best kind of salty, oily and spicy. It had sprinkles of cheese that blended well with a bite of the roasted purple onion. It was just the way pasta without a tomato based sauce should taste. To round out our meal, we had the panna cotta and the affogato. The flavor profiles for these desserts hit all the right notes. The panna cotta was light, fruity, sweet and smooth. The affogato came with ice cream, candied walnuts and biscotti. It was rich, earthy and sweet. All I can say now is that this is a place I would go back to again and bring my very picky foodie friends.",2
107,,1/2/2018,8,,"Cincinnati, OH",Pat P.,0,4.0,5,Great service and very good food. We had one dish that didn't meet our expectations - we informed the waitress and she quickly remedied by replacing the dish.,

I had ""le borse"" pasta and I really enjoyed it. I wasn't starving so got the appetizer portion and it was 5 pasta ""purses"". One friend had the rapini pizza which she enjoyed and the other had the mackerel and said it was really tasty. Everything was really excellent and for a very good price!

112,4,5/6/2016,374,3,"Brooklyn, NY",Marina S.,892,4.0,354,"I love Italian food, but when I go out to eat, it always somehow falls short on my list of priorities. This is probably due to one too many horrible experiences in Little Italy; if I'm going to carbload, I expect the food to be fantastic and I'm not going to waste it on undercooked, out-of-a-box pasta for tourists.Luckily, I have Vic's to remind me just how fresh and delicious (and even healthy!) Italian food can be. I've only been here for lunch before, but the entire space is really bright and airy, and perfect for a special night or business meal. First, if they ask if you want bread for the table, the answer is yes. Always. It's thickly cut but fluffy, perfectly grilled, and wonderful for sopping up olive oil.If you want an appetizer, head first for the burrata. It comes with a crisper bread smothered in garlic and butter, but the burrata really melts in your mouth. I've also tried the turnips and grilled asparagus, but neither really stood out to me.For my main, I always end up getting the grilled chicken with greens. This isn't a salad (if that's what you're looking for), but thin slices of charred broccoli and other greens with a very moist piece of chicken in a chili basil vinaigrette. The greens portion is pretty small and it's definitely a spicy dish, but one of my favorites.I've never had a problem with service; our servers are always very nice and helpful. On our last visit, we found a small anchovy bone in one of our pastas and they were very quick to correct the issue.Next time, I need to try dinner or brunch!",5

Crispy Sweet Onions - I didn't think I would like this dish, but it was possibly my favorite. Burrata with Lemon Garlic Toast - The burrata literally spread like butter onto the bread. Roasted Chicken - Well-seasoned to melt-in-your-mouth. Provolone Pizza - OUTSTANDING! Soppressata Pizza - Also, pretty perfect with a spicy meat.

What's fried and not tasty, right?- asparagus with ramps: I was excited about this dish as the waitress hyped it up. It had some interesting and vibrant flavors, but either the oil or sogginess of the dish was distracting. Similarly with the main dish I got, orecchiette pasta with anchovies and ramps, tasted oily. first couple bites of the dish were good, but the build up of what tasted like oil built up in my mouth unpleasantly. It's odd that the fried dish of onions was the least oily. Although the atmosphere felt light and pleasant, the food and prices weren't quite right for me.",1

I just came back from California to get a taste of seasonal cooking there, so perhaps I've been some tired with this concept when I stepped into the restaurant. Overall, while the meal was certainly not bad, no single dish really jumped out as amazing. The appetizer dishes at the restaurant have many vegetable-focused options. Baby squid with black olive oil and lemon was more or less forgettable, and while the crispy sweet onions were pretty tasty, after a couple of pieces, the dried tomato and parmigiano quickly overwhelmed my palate. The kitchen has a small selection of pizzas, and the prosciutto pizza with ricotta, poppy seeds and horseradish, while well-cooked, was not the best I've had in recent memory. The best dish of the night was the rye rigatoni pasta that came with braised lamb, oregano and lemon. I was a huge fan of the rustic pasta that had nice kick of lemon. For entrée, I had grilled flank steak, which was slightly overcooked and didn't really have much juiciness that I was hoping for. For dessert, parsnip honey cake with crème fraiche geloto was a nice dish to finish the meal.The restaurant has a really nice, sexy vibe making it an ideal place for a date night. Getting a reservation isn't particularly hard, although it was nearly packed on a Sunday night in the course of my meal. There are usual selections of wine and cocktails, and I did enjoy a carafe of Italian chianti to go along with my meal. Vic's is probably a better place if you want to impress your date with the atmosphere of the place than the quality of food. The concept was certainly very predictable, and the execution still needs a bit of work.",4

Updated review",146,,"New York, NY",Bing R.,2997,4.0,515,"I was pleased this restaurant is here.The cuisine is lighter than the one that used to be right in this spot.Their pizza is very thin and crisp. The edge of the pizza though is a bit wide. I wish it would be narrower so I would not be eating more bread.  Fortunately, it is light and crisp.The pans cotta was excellent! Very light like milk gelatin with citrus slices on top and course let chopped pistachio with sweetened peeled blood orange slices. Located near Public Theater, it's a good spot to dine before the show.The service is good and efficient. They give you a choice of plain water or carbonated water;  free.The mussel soup in north had garlic pieces of bread in it. Nth at was really good. Loved it!  They also serves this with slices of excellent bread!A good place to eat!",1

Updated review",99,,"New York, NY",Norman H.,0,3.0,68,"Restaurants have their ups and downs. Six months ago, I gave this restaurant five stars, based on over 12 visits, and a lot of good food.  Now, however, I feel I have to lower the review. The three stars is based on overall meals.  Were I reviewing the one I ate last night, the review would be one star.For a holiday weekend (Yom Kippur) the place was, nonetheless, packed.  There have been staff changes, and the ""A team"" was clearly not on.  We had a very enthusiastic, very pleasant, server, and she was the highlight of the meal (she could not stop apologizing, for example, because our wine was 30 seconds late). We began with salads:  escarole for my partner, puntarelle, for me.  Now our server asked me ""do you know what puntarelle is,"" and I do.  She was happy because ""I cannot tell you how many of them get sent back because it's bitter greens.""  Well, maybe they're being sent back because the dressing tastes like it is all vinegar and no oil.  This has, in fact, been a somewhat consistent problem with the salads as of late.  The menu speaks of tarragon and mustard.  I tasted neither. All I tasted was vinegar.  Two bites in, enough.  We didn't send it back, but it sat there, pretty much uneaten.  Same story with the escarole (same dressing???).  Cleared by busser, no one says a thing.  Pastas:  the ""famous"" cacio e pepe, and eggplant ravioli.  I think if you didn't know it was eggplant ravioli, you wouldn't have guessed:  no eggplant taste, and a THICK tomato sauce, and so much marjoram, that there's no flavor.  Overcooked too.  The cacio e pepe was also overcooked, and underseasoned.BUT... the disaster of the night, was the side dish of sungold tomatoes.  They are listed as having ""caraway, pecorino, and orange.""  Sounds like a brilliant combination.  No mention of the chilis:  TONS of them.  So many, the dish is inedible.  Again, pushed to the center, and not eaten. Taken away, no comment from anyone. Our lovely server comes back and apologizes about a wait for the wine.  I tell her ""oh, YOU have nothing to apologize for, but the kitchen....""  and we tell her.   Now, to give credit where credit is due, EVERYTHING went off the bill, which was unnecessary.  But what WAS necessary, and didn't happen, is someone in management to come over and talk with us.  Nope.  And yes, it was a busy night, but I saw the manager (i) texting in the back of the restaurant, (ii) chatting with the younger, ""beautiful"" people, and absenting himself as we left.  I understand that people can differ over the acidity in a salad dressing:  I do, and that is why we just kept on plugging:  not to your taste, that's on you.  BLASTING out taste buds with so much hot pepper that you can't taste the dish:  that's on the restaurant.  So is overcooked pasta. Given our history of good, no, great meals at the restaurant, we will come back, but not soon.",

I went with the Eggs, Greens & Grains that included baby spinach, chilies, feta, charred onions and almonds. I think they went a little over board on the amount of feta they put in, but overall it was tasty and was one of the healthier choices with both almonds and spinach mixed in.

Fast forward to tonight- I had a reservation for 4 at 5:30p on a Sunday. My friends and I arrived & were immediately impressed. Ambience, decor, exposed rustic white brick, candles, wood, cozy yet spacious. Add to this they were playing classic hip hop & r&b tracks the entire time. This place works for friends, groups of all sizes, dates, anything. They have a bar near the front and an open kitchen at the back. Okay so the food and the drink. We did family style to try a many things as possible. We started with the garlic bread with goat butter- hit the spot. We split the mixed greens salad which was very fresh, light and enough for two to share. The ravioli, buttery, with textured toasted breD crumbs, very rich- to die for. Cacio e Pepe was cooking perfectly and was deliciously peppery and cheesy. The mafalde received rave reviews. The perfectly al dente rigatoni tasted like an Italian grandma cooked you up her Italian red sauce except it was spicy and had crispy succulent pork pieces in it. We also tried the bomboloni donuts for dessert which were like a cross between churro and a warm powdered donut.We also asked the waiter (his name was Ian and he was the best ever) to advise us on the wine list. He let us try three different reds that paired well with our meals, sooo nice! Loved that. He was overall so knowledgable and nice to us, really made our experience that much better.

The service was by far the best I've had for brunch in a long time. I wish I knew the name of our waitress, a delightful girl with some awesome brightly colored glasses. She gave suggestions. She was attentive. What a dream!I started with the Rosemary cocktail - a little bitter for my taste but not bad. I then had the scone as an appetizer which was the best scone I've had in years. I ordered the egg and brisket sandwich for my main - woah! The brisket was flavorful and tender and the potatoes were some of the best around. They could be my favorite hash browns in NYC thus far... buttery and crispy! Make sure you get something that comes with a side of those potatoes! The portions were large, larger than I could finish, so maybe you share and add an extra side of something. The atmosphere was very chill and laid back. Also make sure to check out the bathroom wallpaper - so cute!",3
135,16,10/26/2014,5000,14,"Forest Hills, NY",Mike C.,64780,5.0,1636,"This new Italian restaurant opening in place of formerly trendy brunch joint Five Points is a solid five star spot.Yet another place to add to the plethora of new options for excellent pizza that have opened in the last few months, the menu here has tons more in addition to that, including some incredible pasta:- Peasant Bread ($3)This bread is so good it almost makes you forgive that they don't give you any bread and make you pay to get some. Almost. They only give you 3 slices of this incredible, hot, buttery and crispy bread and it makes you wish it were complimentary so you could keep asking for more. - Crispy Eggplant ($11)This is a big pile of bright strips of fried eggplant. They are super thin and incredibly crispy, with tons of salty flavor. The waiter mentioned this as one of the more popular starters, and it's easy to see why.- Pancetta Pizza ($15)Similar to the thin-crust style at Marta, this was a really excellent pie. The combination of pancetta, horseradish, poppy seeds and ricotta sounds bizarre, but it tastes so good. The dough is very thin, while the crust is both crispy and a bit chewy. Definitely make sure to try this, or at least one of the pizzas.- Cacio E Pepe ($18 for larger size)Available in half and full order sizes, the pastas we tried were incredible. This very simple Cacio E Pepe was perfect.- Rye Rigatoni ($20 for larger size)Even better than the Cacio E Pepe, this dish with big pieces of rigatoni and plenty of bits of lamb shoulder was definitely the best dish. You will definitely want to order the full size of this.- Parsnip and Honey Cake ($9)Served with creme fraiche gelato, this was pretty good, but in a rare occasion, I much preferred the rest of the meal over the desserts here. The cake was very moist and spongy, and not too sweet. It needed to be paired with the creamy gelato, of which there wasn't quite enough of.- Sweet Ricotta Filled Fried Mezzaluna ($9)This came with 5 little moons of fried dough filled with ricotta. Even less sweet than the honey cake, this was way too bland for me. The pockets were piping hot and nice and crispy, so they were good in that respect, but I wish the filling was tastier.The atmosphere in here was really nice, with a great waitstaff providing perfect service throughout the meal. The music was on point too, consisting entirely of 90's hip-hop and R&B (e.g. OutKast, Nate Dogg, Biggie, etc.). I will definitely return when they inevitably start serving brunch, when they can easily recapture the popularity of Five Points.",23

The restaurant is adorable. Spacious and well lit. Intricately decorated, giving off a chic, french farmhouse vibe. The staff incredibly friendly and attentive. Wine and food moderately priced.When our appetizers came, I prematurely exclaimed ""five stars!"" The fried eggplant was amazing, thin and crispy, served with this rich Parmesan sauce. The burrata was equally incredible, paired with olive tapenade toast and mushrooms.Things went south when we get our entrees. The Pancetta pizza everyone has been raving about fell flat. The crust was charred, the horseradish barely present, and the poppy seeds overwhelming. Seriously, the thing was essentially a ricotta pizza covered in seeds. Given the recommendations, we went with the Rye Rigatoni. Another let down. I don't think there was more than a spoonful of lamb meat in the bowl. I believe they meant to top the dish with lemon zest and instead we bit into chunks of lemon rind. Don't know how they justified serving this. My advice: come by for drinks, sit at the bar and order some apps. They clearly have these down. The entrees? Not so much.",5

Let's get down to business, kids:AMBIANCE: loud, BUT beautiful, warm lighting. Nice greenery and mirrors. They did a good job. Not gimmicky but also not so over simplified and sterile you feel like you're there for a quick bottled cold brew, or something stupid. SERVICE: everyone seemed genuinely delighted that they worked there and they really knew their sh*t about the menu. FOOD: BRUSSELS SPROUTS - really flavorful, tangy and hearty for an appetizer. Go for it. BURRATA - not that creamy. So, like, why?FUSILLI WITH LAMB - decadent AF. Really nice favors, tons of parmesan, a generous amount of lamb. WORTH IT.

Great service, our server was very attentive and made sure to check back to make sure everything was okay. We had 2 cocktail, started with the salad (nothing special, didn't really liked that we paid $11 or more for just leaves). Had the garlic bread as well which was really good but filling, so unless you're with a group I wouldn't suggest it, it got cold really fast so we didn't end up finishing it. Got the 2 pastas our server recommended, can't remember the names but it was the first and last ones on the pasta side of the menu. They were absolutely delicious! Both are very heavy and cheesy, full of flavour - the pasta was cooked perfectly, loved the texture. The meal was a bit expensive considering what we ordered, would probably try other appetizers. Totally worth though and will definitely be returning the next time I'm back in New York! Vic's or one of their sister restaurants! I really enjoyed it.",

Updated review",148,12,"Manhattan, NY",Samantha L.,203,5.0,74,"Okay, I just love this place. This was my 3rd time here, and it does not disappoint! Also, side note - the waiters are all so cute with their denim button downs and William Sonoma striped aprons. Had to say it.I came here for dinner this time at 7:30pm on Saturday. Everything was so good!!FOOD:-Garlic bread: comes on a large, thick toasted piece of bread, covered in butter/oil with garlic. Man this was good! Get this to start for the table. It is very flavorful.-Crispy Sweet Onions: I got this the last time I was here with friends, and decided to get it again. It's bite sized pieces of onion that are lightly breaded/cripsy. They definitely feel much more healthy and lighter than onion rings, but you can compare it to that to get an idea. Comes topped with fresh parm, and a dipping sauce that is very good and creamy. Get this!-Tomato Pizza: this was good to share as well. Thicker crust, tomato, pecorino cheese, and pieces of basil. -Cacio e Pepe: I got this last time I was here as well, and got it again! I really do love it. It's so good, and I would get it again. All the cheesy and peppery goodness.-Borsa ""Little Purse"" Pasta: I adore this pasta (my sister and I split the Cacio e Pepe and this pasta). They look like little dumplings, and are filled with ricotta cheese. The menu says hazelnut and lemon, but thinking back, I feel like there is a truffle flavor? Whatever it was, it was unreal. It's also great to split since the dumplings are so rich in flavor.DRINKS:-Honey Fashioned: Get this if you like Old Fashioneds. Love it!SERVICE:-Very good and attentive. And like I said, cute uniforms.",26
152,1,11/7/2016,1,,"New York, NY",Determined R.,4,5.0,27,"The most wonderful brunch experience in a very long time. The good: the hospitality, right from the manager to the concierge, to our server, to the bus boys. Professional, well mannered, fun loving people. We had a change in seating plan and despite the commotion we created, no one gave us attitude. That's saying something in a wonderful brunch place during rush time. Our server: I didn't catch her name, but she was phenomenal. Didn't lose her patience, or give us attitude. Was very gracious with our guests who had children. The food: par excellence. Everyone on the table enjoyed everything we ordered. My guests thought that I had sampled the place before I set it up for my husband's 40th. Nope, I just looked at the reviews. The scones, focaccia for the table were huge hits. So were the eggs- baked, poached, frittatas, chicken. On point with the salt, well done/ presented food. Drinks: they hit the nail on the head. Very satisfying. We didn't sample their teas/ coffees as we were so satiated from the food. Bathrooms: Epic. Who has such clean bathrooms anymore. I was floored. The bad: 4$ cake cutting charge per guest. When you have 12 people at the table, and we have a bill of about 300, do you really need to charge us to distribute cake? Despite this, they did a very good job of it. The Ugly: Nada!I'm going back to Vic's for sure.",

For an entree, my partner and I shared the small portion of the Crab Spaghetti and side of kale. Both were incredible!  The spaghetti wasn't too citrusy, and the crab had the perfect amount of chile that balanced out the flavor.Lastly the service, from our server who timed our meal well to the helpful busser was superb.",

Secondly they offer half orders of their pasta, which is great for me as i like to taste multiple menu items and hate filling up so quickly. I ordered the cacio e pepe pasta and rapini pizza. The broccoli rabe on the pizza was so tasty. it was not bitter at all, and had the perfect amount of heat to it (from the peppers). The pasta dish was also phenomenal. This was my first time trying cacio e pepe, however Vic's definitely nailed it. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente, and the sauce was light and peppery. perfection!!

This low key, welcoming spot is my go-to when in NoHo. I only wish I could make it there more often. The scene is dim but warmly lit with a casual elegance that provides an unspoken comfort to its visitors, whether you're at the bar or a table. The hum of friendly conversation & just the right level of background music will make you lose track of time - every.single.time.As for my favorites: staff = their GM, Hely, she just rocks - always, drinks = the handcrafted strawberry margarita, food = garlic bread with goat butter, crispy onions, the heirloom carrots & the zucchini pizza.  Then, if you can manage to still have room for dessert,  try their chocolate hazelnut torte amazingness (not the official title on the menu, but if you ask they'll know what you mean).

The food came out so quickly and everything was remarkable (get the Bread with Goat Butter, fo' reals). The Cacio e Pepi pasta was the best I've ever had, and all the portions were generous enough for heaping leftovers.

A good friend took me here a few months back, and my amazing experience prompted me to return last night for my 4-year anniversary dinner - and with so many dining options in NYC, that is saying a lot!All in all, Vic's in a wonderful addition to the culinary scene. The atmosphere is simple and not pretentious, although you very well may sit next to a celebrity (I was an inch from Seth Meyers and had to keep myself from fangirling.) There is a cute bar area in the front to grab a quick bite/drink, followed by the main dining room which has a row of 2x2 tables, round tables and booths, all lit by candles making for a very sexy, relaxed setting, and then there's another small eating area in the very back of the restaurant where diners can witness the cooking magic right in front of the kitchen line itself. There's also a skylight in this back area which makes it much brighter than the main dining room, and a very different feeling overall, but all enjoyable.The food -- I have literally never tried a dish I did not tremendously enjoy. The roasted carrots with dill are excellent and a MUST ORDER. The last time I went I had a cauliflower dish with grapefruit, but noticed it was no longer on the menu when I went last night. I think they may change the menu seasonally. I have also had the crispy sweet onions, softshell crab, garlic bread, scallops entrée and last but not least my favorite - the caccio e pepe pasta! I could go on and on about the diverse flavor profiles here, but they were all delicious and worth ordering. The last time I went I sat in the back near the kitchen line, and I noticed the chefs tasting every single dish before it hit the diners table. The service I have received each time is fantastic (waters were replaced without us even noticing, waitresses were knowledgeable/friendly) and we never felt rushed even though we took our time leisurely ordering and eating. Vic's is fantastic, and absolutely worth visiting!!",5

I went just before 4pm and was seated immediately; there was only one other occupied table. The decor is elegant, a mix between modern and rustic--very lovely. I ordered a half order of the cacio e pepe, which is a Roman pasta dish with a sauce made out of cheese and black pepper. I have never been able to find it anywhere other than actual Rome, Italy. Vic's version wasn't exactly perfect, but it was still delicious, and the closest thing you can expect in a U.S. restaurant. It's not a very heavy sauce, so don't expect something like alfredo. The half order is definitely only enough for one person, and only if that person isn't THAT hungry. It was also $10, so you're paying a lot for atmosphere. The very nice waitress did bring me some fresh bread to eat with it, which helped fill me up a little more.I also got the margherita siciliano cocktail which has tequila, blood orange, chili, and lime juice. I think it would have been great without the chili; with it, it was kind of vile. But I paid $14 for that sucker, so you better bet I was gonna drink it. For dessert I tried their salted caramel gelato. I'm not normally into salted caramel flavors because they're too sweet, but at Vic's it actually had the PERFECT amount of salt to earn the name.

Didn't love the mains we ordered but some of the appetizers alone are worth going back for. Definitely order the roasted corn (AMAZING) and the crispy sweet onions (well done, Yelpers - this one's a winner) - someone described these as less fried onion rings/slightly healthier/so we tell ourselves, and that's spot on. Delicious. The kale salad is good, too. My rating is 3.5 stars but bumping it up because of that corn and those healthy onion rings (but really wedges).The burrata was surprisingly underwhelming. It was pretty insipid to be honest. In a serious test of will power, we did not order the garlic bread but it sounds like this is def worth trying. Ordered the Rapini pizza, which had a nice kick to it from the chilies but felt like it could have been more flavorful. I also was notafan.com of the spaghetti with crab - it was far too fishy for my taste but my dining companions both enjoyed it (nothing stellar but they still ate it).

Okay, this place is absolutely beautiful, but still has such a lovely casual feel to it. The service was EXCELLENT -- if you read more of my reviews you'll see a lot of my ratings are based off of service. IT'S IMPORTANT PPL! The waiter was such a doll (I have to say the matching uniforms are adorableeeee!) He went through the entire menu with us and pointed out his recommendations, told us which dishes won awards, and was SO ON POINT the entire time. It was like he always came exactly when I started thinking I wanted him to be there *tears of joy*. We went with his recommendations -- I had the brussel sprouts and my other half had the brisket and egg sandwich. Oh. My. Gawd. Both dishes were like biting into the juiciest part of heaven. The coffee? Don't even get me started with the coffee. Usually, I don't drink coffee all week I save it for the weekends so when I do get coffee it BETTER BE AWESOME -- this coffee was EVERYTHING. Brewed to perfection. Lastly, no matter how good a brunchy place is I rarely will say ""I wanna try coming here for dinner.""

The area is not very friendly. The Lafayette avenue is not welcoming at night and there is not that many restaurant in the area unless you walk to St Marks place. The place is very charming. The restaurant is bigger than what you expect from the outside. It is perfect for date and friends date. the noise level is perfect. A little bit of music in the background and you don't need to yell when you speak.I did not know anything about the Chef Hillary but the food was very good!!! I was totally impressed! I shared the burrata and the beets with my friend then we had wine. we had the same pasta dish: Borsa. the homemade pasta was cold but the cream inside was hot. the nuts and the lemon made it special. We share a honey semifreddo for desert  and it was very good. What impressed me more than the food was the service! They were so professional. we did not have to wait to long between our order and what impressed me the most is the efficiency of the team, the fact also that they clean table between plates ( because I eat like a pig). THIS IS SERVICE!I will defenitely come back!",4

They said they didn't go for polygamy. I think they were trying to spare my feelings. You might fall for the vegetables, too. The turnips with pecorino, pine nuts, and pesto were unlike anything I've had before, and this was competing with Dirt Candy. They reminded us of slices of pasta. The portion was ample for two as an appetizer. Ditto for the well-dressed roasted fennel with walnuts and juniper. The mains were delightful too, but I'm heaping my notices for creativity and brilliance on the vegetables. The half-chicken roasted was brightened by the peppers, sweet and a just a little spicy. The boneless leg of lamb was under a few artichoke hearts and accompanied by meyer lemons and dabs of yogurt with another pesto. The barrel-aged Negroni had a deeper flavor than most (and beats the bottle-aged Negroni at Marta), but it seemed pricey and maybe a little light in volume compared to the Manhattan, say, that I had a few weeks ago at Lil' Frankie's. With all that, I'm definitely going back. On to the deets (03/19/2016):Rkaciteli, glass, 9 - Macedonian wine.

However, I did like the meal that falls during the breakfast and lunch hours at Vic's this past Saturday.We had a 2:30PM reservation. The restaurant was fairly packed with people milling about and chatting away. Unlike most NYC/SoHo establishments, it didn't feel oppressively crowded. I felt that there was ample space between tables. Service was friendly, the waiter was perhaps a little eager to take our orders, probably because brunch service ends at 3PM.I had a latte [$4.50] with skim milk. It was nothing to write home about. The foam deflated before it got to the table, so it was more like a strong cuppa coffee. Heirloom Carrots [$6]: Wow. The heirloom carrots were incredible. They were slightly oily but I can overlook that, especially when they're caramelized so nicely. I loved the dill and capers which added a savory element to the dish. Grilled Chicken/Greens [$18]: I wasn't expecting a salad when I ordered this entree. But if it had to be a salad, I'm glad it was this one. The grilled chicken was so juicy and flavorful. I really liked the mustard seed ""dressing"" which provided for an interesting texture. The sliced potatoes were great too, giving the dish more substance. The waiter asked if we wanted some bread to start. We were given two slices of crusty rustic bread and olive oil. It was a good warmup to the meal. Surprisingly, it wasn't included on the bill.My friend and I stayed at the table chatting way past brunch hours, the staff was already preparing for dinner service. At no point did they try to kick us out or usher to leave. All in all, Vic's is a very enjoyable place for a meal. I felt like I was at someone's house. And at $29 [splitting the bill in half], it was very inexpensive.",4

Good place. Looking forward to going back.",1

I read that Five Points had reopened as Vic's and I was eager to check it out. The interior is warm and friendly, which is a welcome experience on a cold winter night! We sat at our table and I LOVED the presentation of the water. You've given a bottle of both flat AND sparkling water at the table. (Side note: do they have a Soda Stream?). I love love love that Vic's offers sparkling water for free! Game changer! I've been on a dirty martini kick and ordered one of those. Christine got the Spiked Plum, a bourbon based cocktail with plum syrup. I sipped a little - very yummy!To start, we got the Crispy Sweet Onions served with dried tomato and a delicious parmigiano dipping sauce. The onions recently replaced the Eggplant option that was offered on the menu (and RAVED about on Yelp!). Our server explained that Vic's emphasizes the freshest ingredients and eggplants are no longer in season, so onions it is! They were the fanciest onion rings I've ever had. SO GOOD!For our mains, we got the Prosciutto Pizza, made with ricotta, horseradish, poppy seeds and a healthy amount of yummy, salty PROSCIUTTO!!! This was such an interesting pizza! Poppy seeds? I mean, WHAT? It was a ""white sauce"" pizza and a nice complement to the pasta we got. Based off of Yelp raves, we went with the Rye Rigatoni which is house-made (YUM) and served with deliciously tender braised lamb, oregano, lemon and white wine. We got the larger portion and I'm so glad. It was a generous portion! I'm glad more because it was so tasty and I wanted to keep eating it! This is a MUST order!As my second drink of the evening (Christine started with a glass of wine), I got an Old Cuban with aged rum. So delicious!You MUST visit the bathroom when you come here. The flamingos are incredible. This image is now the home screen on my phone. It is so darn cute!We passed on dessert. We were too full and nothing really spoke to me anyway.

The burrata was good, but cannot compare in any way to the latter two which were exquisite. My friend then opted for Cacio e Pepe (too much pepe for her but I liked it that way), and I opted for the borsa or little purse filled with ricotta: these were like tiny pillows filled with deliciousness. The dessert (chocolate mascarpone torta) was a little dense but still good. Everyone from the host to our waitress were incredibly friendly, smiley and efficient.

188,,10/23/2017,0,,"San Antonio, TX",Randi M.,0,2.0,39,"I visited Vic's with family a couple of nights ago because of a recommendation from a friendly passing stranger on the streets of NYC. We called ahead to try to get on the waitlist, but the person who answered said it is a 30-40 minute wait, and we can get on the list when we arrive. When we showed up 10 minutes later, there were easily 10 tables open and no waiting. Is this a common restaurant tactic? Anyway, we were seated quickly and served by a friendly, well-mannered waiter. A couple of my family members ordered the roasted chicken and I ordered the Pacherri Rigati, a pasta, ricotta and squash dish. The portion sizes were great, but my dish was not. The pasta was really undercooked, the noodles nearly still crunchy. We sent the dish back and the waiter was apologetic and quick to get me a menu to order something else. I ordered a tomato pizza that was delivered in about another 10-15 minutes. While it was more of what I expected, the quality was still not great. The dough was stretched unevenly so the center was very thin and the edges thick and burnt. The cheese was sparse but still tasty. My family members enjoyed their roasted chicken and the atmosphere. While our server was very friendly and doing his best, I was still soured by the quality of two different dishes and will not return.",

The portions are generous and she makes a subtle statement without any pretension.  From anything that uses a dough, scones, pizza or pasta, to eggs or housemade sausages, all are excellent.  The service is great as the open kitchen shows organization and a steady flow.  The cocktails are tasty and well thought out.",

The natural lighting in the back of the space and the friendliness of the staff make the space so very comfortable. One day, some moths ago, I was driving my mother around to take care of errands but ran out of time and had to attend a meeting. I took her into Vic's to relax with her book and a cup of tea while I was gone. We were greeted by staff who heard my conversation with my mother and promised that she would be fine relaxing there.  When I returned an hour later, Mom was content and happy with a craft beer in front of her & a remarkably large brisket sandwich on the table waiting to be wrapped up.  Or so she thought. I tasted the sandwich and found it to be one of the most delicious, moist, flavorful briskets I'd ever had outside of someone's home! Mom did not get to take it home. Nor did she get to take home the wonderful herbed, lemony potatoes that were on the plate. (I wish they'd bring those back). Mom was very pleased with the staff's balanced approach of attentiveness, but still leaving her in peace to enjoy her book. She just wasn't able to resist the aromas coming from the open kitchen, is all. Since then she insists on coming here any time we are in the area together. This past weekend my family was in the area to see a performance at the Public Theater. As we passed Vic's on the way, I already knew where we'd go eat afterward. During Intermission I heard 2 men discussing we here they'd eat and I happily recommended Vic's. They brought their party of 8 over and enjoyed it so much that they thanked me on the way out.This was my sister's first visit and she was really impressed with the food and ambiance. I was already accustomed to Vic's but what really impressed me was a server named ""Angel"". He made the visit particularly memorable with his sparkling personality, passion for his work, knowledge of the wines/beers and attentiveness to detail. He was patient and extremely good at what he does. So much so that I went as far as to ask his schedule because with service like that I'd know it was always the right decision to send friends to Vic's. I mean, I already told you how I feel about the farm to table food and the atmosphere. But Angel brought it up a notch.Obviously - we'll be back.",
