0,Sharrone U.,"Bronx, NY",128,70,423,4.0,6/2/2018,"Went to a Bollywood event at Stage 48. The DJ was amazing, and the people were a lot of fun. Exploring new things makes us smarter individuals. I met a lot of great people at this event. It's was well organized and the security staff made me feel safe. No security worries, just great fun. Go on meetup and find your Bollywood party.",,,1
1,Rahul M.,"New Hyde Park, NY",78,2,0,1.0,9/16/2018,"Horrible experience. This review is for the ""Bollywood night"" party that's held every Saturday night. STAY ATTENTIVE OF YOUR TAB AND WHAT YOU ORDER.Me and my friends were overcharged twice in one night and when we confronted the bartender, she reluctantly agreed to refund us the balance after much effort. She eventually admitted that she did in fact over charge us ""by mistake"". Later in the evening we were short changed ~$25  by another bartender. Once confronted, he proceeded to act confused and said that we never ordered a drink from him? C'mon dude, that's so petty. There are people in my party that were completely sober who saw you pouring us the drinks. When we requested to speak to a manger he completly ignored us. We eventully were able to get into contact with a manager who said he'd review the ""security footage"". He took down my contact info  but I highly doubt I'll hear from him again or see my money back. We were also charged for drinks that we never ordered. Me and my party always tip very well so I'm not sure why the bartender felt the need to overcharge us. Super unethical regardless.I guess a ""pro-tip"" would be to make sure you are vigilant when ordering your drinks and staying alert as to how much they are actually charging you. They try to take advantage of their customers and assume that people aren't paying attention. It's honestly a shame that patrons looking for a night of fun at this venue have to worry about being overcharged/making sure the bartenders or bouncers don't steal from them. That being said, the crowd was fairly diverse and had good vibes overall. The venue is huge and has plenty of space to dance/chill. The DJ played a wide variety of songs and was fairly good in my opinion. There are definetly some really sketchy/creepy dudes there, but they can be avoided if you just stay in your group.  I'd recommend heavily pregaming at any one of the cheaper college bars nearby and trying to avoid spending any more money inside the venue ($20 cover). Since it's Manhattan the drinks at the club are obviously overpriced. However, the drinks seem to me to be significantly more watered down than the other clubs in the area/Brooklyn. Additionally, the Hookah service is non-existent. I went to multiple bars in the club trying to figure out where I could get a coal refill since their coal burned out in less rhan 30 mins (~$30 for a small hookah). None of the workers had any idea where I should go for the refill. Me being frustarted just ended up just paying the bouncer guarding the entrance $15 to get me some coal...however, the guy he spoke to demanded an additional $25 for additional coal and the bouncer disappeared (lol, I should've known better). This place is such a joke, but guess it's on me for expecting at least somewhat decent and honest service for all the money my group and I have spent...",1,,
2,Lindsay C.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/24/2018,"Was here for the Karol G show last night. Either the bartender or a patron  spiked my friend's drink with what we think was GHB (similar to Rohypnol aka roofie, another date rape drug). 15 minutes after finishing her drink, she started to feel nauseated and had to leave the floor. She could hardly walk and fell to the ground then threw up immediately. We managed to get her to a couch because she couldn't even walk to the bathroom and she continued to be violently ill and in and out of consciousness. Thankfully, we got her home and she slept off the effects for 10 hours.She only had the ONE drink, so we know she wasn't just wasted and sick from drinking too much. She never left her cup unattended, and only  looked away briefly when the bartender set it on the counter.",1,,
3,Liz R.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,1,0,2.0,11/10/2018,"I would not recommend this place to anyone! Overly priced and horrible service. I purchased a VIP package $582.71 which included a bottle. Upon arrival I was slammed with an additional fee which I was never told about. $50 additional for bottle fee?!! Me and my party were also removed from our section for another party. We were never advised of a time limit. Although the table next to us had no bottle service and were just hanging out. Why was my party harassed to do so?! The staff are unprofessional! Cherry on top I've been waiting on a refund since then. I've contacted the individual who dealt with my reservation and to no surprise, no reply. Your service was disgusting Stage48! I frequent many places in Manhattan and was appalled by this! Never again!",,,
4,Nicole S.,"Forest Hills, NY",170,173,207,1.0,10/29/2017,"Came here last night for the Halloween Monster Bash. This was probably the worst night I've had in 2017. The tickets said doors opened at 10 so we showed up at 10:15 to a line that wrapped around the block. Standing in line was an experience on its own. After being pushed around by a bunch of kids my friend and I finally had to ask them politely to step back. For the next 45 minutes in line (a total of an hour wait to get in) they kept making rude comments, sniffing us and making crude gestures behind our backs. After enduring this, we were finally let in. The security guard confiscated my pen cartridge which makes no sense to me. I've flown with it. I can't take it into a club?!We get inside and I've never felt a stickier floor in my life. My shoes were stuck. While being stuck in place I looked around. After an hour wait and the realization that there was ANOTHER line on the opposite corner to get in, the place was empty! The DJ looked bored out of his mind. The bartenders looked tired. I was over it. I go up to the bar because I really need a drink now. I order a Malibu pineapple. The waitress hands me a small plastic cup and tells me it's $14. Literally blown away. We downed our drinks and ran out. I asked the security guard if I can get my cartridge back since 15 minutes had past and she told me she turned it in. Most expensive 15 minutes of my life. Terrible night. Terrible place. Boring",8,2,
5,Jessica K.,"Queens, NY",131,134,252,1.0,10/29/2017,"Went for the Monster Halloween party last night. Showed up around 10:15/10:30, doors opened at 10 so the event stated. Stood on a line that wrapped around the block for over an hour. Finally we get to the entrance and were met by security who touched me, my body and chest more than has ever been done at an airport.Went up the stairs and the place was...empty. what? An hour long wait, the line moves and we get in and it's empty? Where the hell were all the people that were on the line?Drinks were disgusting, barely any alcohol for the price they charge. $14 for a tiny ass plastic cup filled mostly with ice. I felt like I was in a college frat basement despite just having climbed stairs to get to the main area. The floor was so sticky it was as if they've never bothered to ever mop spilled drinks off the floor. Worse than a movie theater in the 90s. One star is for the bartender who actually DID give me a cup of tap water to drink. I was fully prepared to pay $$$ for a bottle of Poland Spring, but after standing on that line I was dehydrating into a pile of dust so I didn't care. Pleasantly surprised to get a nice, ice cold, and non-funky tasting glass of water to drink. All other reviews told me otherwise!Very young and obnoxious crowd, not sure what it is about being in your early twenties and having zero self awareness in regards to how you behave in a crowded situation with people standing very close to you.TIPS: If you're standing on a line, or in a crowd of people, then have the situational awareness to not be dancing, pretending to box, and do otherwise pointless shit, causing you to continuously hit, bump into, and shove the people in front of you. Behaving like this and then saying something as brain dead as: ""Don't you see where you are?"" While continuing to act like an asshole, will do you no favors. Adjust your behavior accordingly, have some common sense and consideration, realize you're in a crowd, and stop acting like you were raised by delinquents.Friend had her vape cartridge confiscated by security. When we went downstairs to leave a mere 10 minutes after arriving, she asked if she could have it back. The woman had marbles in her mouth and just mumbled something about how she ""already gave it to blahblahblah"" and then turned around while continuing to speak. We just wanted to get the hell out of here at this point and ran out like our asses were on fire. We should have pressed this person further, demanded to speak to a manager, and gotten the property back. They have no right to confiscate property.This whole thing was such a waste of time. A waste of an amazing costume that took hours to do, a waste of money for the ticket, a waste of money for the drinks, a waste of money for the cab we had to take since this club is in the asscrack of the middle of no where. Just an all around waste.Do yourself a favor and stay away--unless you're in your early twenties, when you're still basking in the excitement that you're now legally able to drink yet also too dumb and still too new to the scene to even realize you're in a shit hole, and paying exorbitant prices for bottom shelf drinks.",3,2,1

Updated review","Okay, not only is this place still charging $6 for bottled water and refusing to offer tap water to customers who are consuming alcohol (which, y'know, should be illegal) -- pretty sure they round up tips! But I cannot confirm since they also do not give you a customer copy of your receipt when you close out your tab, and I did not have the foresight to ask for one or take a picture.SKETCHY AS HELL. STAY AWAY.",2,2,
7,Andrew J.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/27/2018,"Stage 48 is the most trash place I have ever been to. The security is rude, the music changes every 15 seconds. Also if you think paying for a 1500$ table is enough you're wrong, they won't let you on the elevators. You need to look slutty as hell to be noticed. All of the workers there are beat, trashy and unprofessional. I wouldn't go there again if someone paid me. Don't waste your money. Take the advice of someone 24 and knows what a good time is life.",,,
8,Chantel T.,"Woodmere, NY",17,1,0,1.0,10/28/2018,"Had a horrible experience last night for their ""annual"" Halloween party! My friends and I had already purchased a section with bottle service two weeks prior to the party and still had an issue with getting a good table. Although we got in right away without a hassle, we waited a good 30 minutes for them to give us a decent table. The table they did end up giving us was DIRTY! Liquor and vomit was on the floor of the section, the couches were soaking wet and the table was littered with used napkins and also wet. We literally had to find someone and ask them to clean up the section while waiting for our bottle. Next issue was the MUSIC....definitely could have gotten a better DJ selection. Sucks that this party is always sold out every year but this year it seemed a little off! Doubt we will ever return!",,,
9,Cree P.,"Jamaica, NY",152,127,351,3.0,7/22/2017,"I came here yesterday night for the first time ever and first things first it's rather confusing that there are three different lines going on for three different clubs right next to each other. So when I was looking for level 3, which is where I wanted to go, one of the bouncers was kind of being an ass. Like I don't know if he was just poking fun at me or something, but he kind of talk to me like I was stupid, and I'm thinking you can't be mad at me if I'm not entirely sure where to go when there were three lines going on. Anyway, I finally find the right one and walk inside the entrance and find out that even though it's free entry before 12 AM you still have to pay a $10 minimum to get a ""free drink"". Hey newsflash it's not a free drink if you're paying $10, it's a rip off but whatever. And speaking of, their drinks are waayy overpriced to begin with they're not even that  good. And to top it all off, they serve them in plastic cups (the small 8oz ones at that!) and then have the nerve to charge $14 and higher! Definitely a rip off!!And honestly the bouncers throughout this whole vicinity look Shady as  However, The inside of level 3 looks really nice, it's very clean and spacious. I looove the music selection as well! It's definitely dance, turn up, get ratchet kind of music.",6,1,
10,Natalie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",145,158,892,1.0,12/23/2016,"First and last time here. I understand the need to check the customers before admitting them into the club but this one overzealous security not only checked my person and my handbag but removed my wallet from my bag,unzipped and went through it, I had to ask if she's counting how much money I had. Not even an international flight requires that kind of invasion of privacy. Also I don't mind paying to get into the club then paying for coat check, but I do mind when my knee length coat is place on a rack so low that more than half of it is on the floor. Pointed it out to the attendant who simply grabbed the lower half and crumpled it into the hanger. Bad experience from start to finish. Like I said, first and last time.",9,3,

12,Tiffany M.,"East Brunswick, NJ",310,168,377,3.0,5/24/2017,Hi my Adventurers! So I've been here on two separate occasions. Once for the Halloween Masquerade and then for a friend who promotes over here. First off there will always always be a line regardless of whether you're there promoting or attending a VIP paid event. Secondly the staff has been always courteous given the nature of club life. Third the place becomes wayyyyyy too packed to really do anything but stand like sardines. I say this because the other time I was here was with a few friends who promoted. They are able to get bottles and hookah however since you're promoting with a bunch of other people and younger females that just want to get fucked up it becomes no place for a mature crowd set. Yes I felt my age at this place by looking around me. Overall this will not be a place I frequent based on how packed it was.,9,,1
13,Varun B.,"New Brunswick, NJ",69,1,0,1.0,1/1/2018,This place is f trash. Made everyone stay outside in 2 degrees for more than an hour even though we paid for the tickets.

They make sure to check people carefully before letting anyone in. This place is a CLUB, not a lounge so get ready to really dance and be surrounded by many tourists or just young wild people that plan to get hammered all night. Bottle service is always nice, I can't imagine walking around this Place with a drink on my hand. I think it will spill as soon as i turn away and walk away from the bar. That is how crowded it gets! Special performance by Little John this night. He deff. Did his thanggg!!",,,
16,Anthony D.,"Yonkers, NY",7,81,15,1.0,6/16/2018,"This place is exactly what I expected based on the overwhelming amount of 1 star reviews. Literally everything bad that was said about it is 100% accurate. Line wrapping around the block 2+ hrs after doors open because of the super inefficient people working the door. Really nasty and argumentative security for no reason whatsoever. And honestly the most expensive and shitty drinks in all of NYC. $12 for a well vodka/seltzer? Give me a break. All of this would have been fine, but for christ sake hire a sound guy. Every band that played sounded like complete and utter garbage.

18,Chelsea B.,"Secaucus, NJ",325,332,187,1.0,10/4/2017,"I was COMPLETELY disappointed with everything that happened on Saturday, August 26th. The event management was disorganized and all staff were confused.I will start with the false advertising. I researched a ton of venues before making the decision to book at ""Cantina Rooftop: Mayweather VS McGregor Fight Viewing & After Party."" My friends and I wanted to be able to sit and watch the fight without rowdiness going on, have some drinks, and enjoy ourselves. We bought 3 $40 VIP tickets for seats and a free drink. I also called the venue and spoke with someone in advance to make sure it was what we were looking for.With venue entry at 8 pm, we then made dinner reservations for 7 pm at Cantina Rooftop to have dinner so we could get food in our stomachs before drinking, and be there early enough to score good seats.We arrived at the door of Cantina Rooftop at 7:05 pm. There was a bouncer there who asked us if we had tickets to the fight. We said yes. He said we weren't allowed upstairs and pointed to a line to go stand in. ...confused... We were like, are you sure? We have reservations...We all stood in line talking to each other, trying to make sense about what's happening. Seeing if there's other bouncers to talk to, etc. I decided to go back to the original bouncer and ask him why I have a 7 pm dinner reservation if I can't go eat. After waiting my turn, I was explaining to the bouncer about the fight and dinner reservations, and he finally understood that we were there to eat too. My sister and bf are still on the other line because I don't want to lose our spot if there's been a mistake. I talk to the hostess, and am told that our reservation was cancelled because we were 15 minutes late............................ FUMING. There were clearly tables and they were not willing to be accommodating even though it was THEIR mistake. I tried my best, but it was clearly useless and I told her to forget about it. When I got back downstairs, I told the bouncer they gave our table away. He looked at his watch and said, ""yeeeah, it's 7:21..."" ARE YOU KIDDING ME?I went back in line and told everyone what was going on. We had to stand in like for 40 min for STAGE 48, NOT Cantina Rooftop like it said on our tickets. There was STILL confusion with us being VIP or not, because the original bouncer had given me the wrong wristband to go up on Cantina Rooftop and then they had to pass our tickets around to multiple people to make sure we were actually VIP. Then I had to ASK for the free drink tickets. There was a long ass line for cheap fast food buffet, which wasn't satisfying at all see as we were all excited for the night we had planned.When the fight came on the DJ was begging the venue to cut the music and stream the fight audio. He is literally on the mic pleading with the venue multiple times. This was the worst most unorganized event I NEVER INTENDED to pay for. Everyone in the VIP section was FREEZING. People were huddled together and wrapped in coats. The AC vents were blowing freezing cold air onto everyone. The second floor was a nice temperature, but it was harder to see the fight with all the obstructed views. The only plus was the TV screen was huge. I never wanted to come to Stage 48 for this event, and wish I'd never been forced to.",2,,

The waitress came over handed us the bottle and took the juice that was half used from the people before us and took our credit card for her tip and left! Never poured any drinks!!!! THEN we got puked on from a drunken couple that was sitting on the couch next to us.There's no barrier keeping the vip section from having anyone sit down. They ""cleaned "" the couch with a mop and a rag and wiped it all over! Absolutely disgusting!!! Then let let people sit back down in the area that they half assed cleaned. I was upset so they moved us. Well apparently it was someone else's seat. The random girl that was supposedly sitting there also got into my face to let me know that we're in her spot and some guy she was with grabbed our bottle of vodka and started drinking it!!!!!!!! I found the ""manager"" who was useless and rude and told me well you should have kept an eye on your bottle and walked away! I can not believe he said that!

I ordered a Henny and Ginger Ale which I was informed was $16.00..in which they kept to give to the next person..Because I drink Hennessey all day damn near everyday and nothing has changed within it for me to pay $16.00 for a Plastic little cup. When I can go to another Bar and obtain It for a more reasonable pricing. I came to Party and have a good time drinking and so on...I am not paying anyone's rent. I barely boarder cross into Manhattan.  I am truly disgusted and bothered at the fact that the false advertisement is what drew my family/friends and myself over to this establishment to have a good time, Besides the wait in line to an empty nightclub and to add insult to injury the drinks that we being offered where not for me. I gave my ticket to someone else whom obtain a shot of something clear,3 lines to get into the place with 3 spots right next door to each other. I think whomever is the Brains behind these 3 spots. I think you'll need to head back to the round table and go back over the scheme of your nightly flow once again.I am disgusted and I will never visit this nightclub again.",3,,
35,Rahul S.,"Jersey City, NJ",0,1,0,1.0,1/2/2018,"I was here for the NYE. It was by far the worst New Years Eve party experience I have ever had! The DJ was very average! The main screen had a display/buffering failure 10 seconds before midnight, so no one in the club was able to see the balldrop! The real ordeal started when the party ended and everyone lined up to collect their coats. The staff at the coat check counter was very inefficient(in addition to being rude) leading to a very long queue. We waited in the line for well over an hour before we got our coats back. We were lucky that we got our coats back as I know a few people lost their coats. I am sorry but I will never go to this place again!!",,,
36,Sharlene B.,"Brooklyn, NY",7,30,0,2.0,8/8/2017,I went to stage 48  8/5 to see trey songz. the female security guard went in my wallet and looked at my cards. then she pulled the zipper for where my money is. That is an invasion of privacy. (I know my rights) the club over all is set up nice when you walk in your on the vip level. I was on the vip level for a while. Then i went down stairs to the main level. The guys were so thristy on the main level. i had a good time seeing trey but the staff needs to be retrained only giving stars cause i liked the setup of the club with the differnt levels.,4,,

Thankfully the music was mostly rap, hip hop, and reggae which was great and definitely had the crowd going. Last but not least, drinks are $10 and hookah is $30. The coal tasted terrible for some odd reason.",2,2,

40,Adam S.,"New York, NY",1542,292,2047,4.0,12/2/2014,"For some time now, every Saturday night at Stage48 is a gay party, complete with lots of shirtless guys dancing on the dance floor, go-go boys, and world-renowned DJs on a weekly revolving basis keeping the crowd moving from 11pm-approximately 6am, though I've never stayed there that late. This review is only for the weekly Saturday night party. As you arrive, you are directed to the 2nd floor to entry, which is the main balcony overlooking the main dance floor. There are chairs to lounge on and two bars on this floor. Well drinks are $10. The restrooms are also on this floor. Keep this in mind as there are no restrooms on the lower level, but there are two more bars. Lots of room but always ( and I mean always ) super packed! Though it's worth mentioning hat no matter how packed, the a/c works wonders. Plus they also use kryogenifex liquid nitrogen shooters to cool down the dance floor (if you aren't sure what they are- try google). There is a large coat check and never a long wait as they have 4 different coat check stations.  It's on the 3rd level next to the pop lounge where you'll find another bar and a more relaxed space if you need to get away from the beats and bass on the main dance floor. Quite honestly, whether you're downstairs or up in the pop lounge, it's a great party. While not something I personally would attend every weekend, it is definitely worth checking out if you're a gay guy living or visiting nyc and are wanting a night out. Keep in mind there's a cover and usually lines to get in. If you're interested check out their website at vivasaturdays.com",11,4,5

ID's & tickets were checked on line getting past this they search u & your good to go.First time here & upon entering I was like not bad great set up ...Day of the Dead main event was for Dj Boris & Chriss Vargas definitely a great way go both great Dj's.This place is pretty big upstairs area was playing hip hop, mix music at the beginning of the night by the end it was house from what I noticed middle area nice space to hang out & check out the crowd below. Main dance floor was insane packed but not so crowded that u couldn't move around. I'd have to say this was a nice change with Halloween events good places tend to get way too crowded this place was good am sure it's size helps ... Mainly packed below but with enough room to still move around & breath u didn't feel like everyone was on top of u. Drinks we stuck to beer & water , two beers was $18 pricey for sure but at least u know u r not going to get a watered down drink. We pre gamed before coming this was a good idea since drinks are expensive.As for the event itself it was awesome ... Can't beat great music , crazy beats & on top of that everyone dressed in costumes what a fun night.Great sound system & lights the dancers were pretty cool to watch as well. Overall it was a fun experience EDM events tend to be as long as the Dj's are good , we had a great time & chances are I'll come back from time to time.",13,2,8

Unfortunately the rooftop was off limits during both occasions i went. I guess crowd varies based on the event they are hosting.Music: Again, this will vary but I hear they have many edm concerts here. Silent disco has three DJs which included top 40, edm and hip hop and reggae.Prices: Drinks are pricey so pregame if you can. With that said we got free shots from a staff member so can't complaint.Service: Bartenders and other staff were friendly.Overall this is a cool spot and I would love to return on a regular night to see what it is like.",6,1,1

Went through security, was searched and allowed in with a Juul vape/ecig (tobacco).  There was nothing on the ticket or website that said no vapes, so when searched and allowed in with one, we were under the impression that it was permitted. While using, we were approached by a security guard that told us we could either pay $20 to continue using it or we would be kicked out. Really messed up after we paid for the tickets and were never made aware that they were not allowed. In addition, the crowd was extremely young, many seeming to be underage. Will not be going back after getting $20 stolen by security.",1,,

47,Stephen J.,"Manhattan, NY",78,232,3868,3.0,8/27/2014,"Let's face it.  It's really a club and not a concert venue.  And it's basically a large box devoid of any character.  It's also on 11th avenue which is basically the ass end of reality where only FedEx, car dealerships, and storage warehouses live.That said the acoustics were f**kin spot ON - we saw Sleep here and they melted our faces off.  Al's bass rumbled through our rib cages, Jason's drums shook the walls, and Matt Pike shredded our minds as we were standing right in front of his rig - front row to the right.  They sounded incredible.One side note, the place was well air conditioned - so much so that even when the venue stupidly oversells tickets and overfills the venue so that we are crammed in beyond what must have been beyond fire code, we were still cool.Also most concert venues have a separate area for selling merchandise - they sold right on the floor so that created extra confusion between folks standing in line to get stuff versus others who were jockeying for space closest to the stage.Above the stage there are a series of LED screens which before the show displayed this weird effect which made us feel like we were descending into the mouth of hell.  And when Sleep started to play it appropriately displayed Hubble Telescope-esque pics.  All very cool.One other worthless observation to close - the DJ haplessly began the night by spinning the totally WRONG tunes for a crowd that showed up to a metal show.  He/she did recover a bit before the first set but come on, man...seriously...",4,4,3
48,Samantha B.,"Valley Stream, NY",224,6,3,2.0,12/6/2016,"Came here for my cousin's birthday on 12/3/16. We reserved a table and had to go through a separate line which was moving fast. Then we had to go through the security, I had no issues with this process until this Young MA want-to-be security guard grabbed my nipples as she did with all the girls in the group. I was wearing a shirt that did not require a bra, she was doing too much. On top of that she squeezed my butt while I'm wearing stocking and short shorts, I don't know where she learned to pat down but this is unacceptable. Finally she went through my bag which is fine, the problem she went through my wallet to and took out my fronto leaf which is not illegal. She made me pay $10 for it. This was the only downside. Inside at our section it was lovely and the waitresses were very nice and actually checked on us. If people are paying the ridiculous amount for a table you could treat them a little better walking in. Probably never coming here again",2,1,

Alarm because I have no idea what I did and why was he being so aggressive. He couldn't even tell me what or if I did anything wrong. So that given, of course I'm going to resist because I don't know why or where he's taking me. Then he threatened to call the cops on me. Again, I asked him what did I do. All he could say was 'you know what you did'. Thankfully, he just took me outside, which made no sense because I was already on my way out. Either way, this bouncer was very rude and unprofessional. If anything, I should've called the cops on him for grabbing me without cause.The music is outdated, like 15 years ago music. The DJ sucked at transitioning the music. The drinks are small, and they charge you for bottled water. They won't even give you tap. Coat check took about an hour, so you're wasting your time for their open bar promotions. Spend your money elsewhere. This is NYC, there are plenty of better clubs. Especially, where security won't take advantage of you like they did to me.",3,,

So not only are you going to illegally not serve me, but you're going to profile me as a liar. Nice one! Advice to Stage48 - get that guy out of here.

53,Michelle P.,"Sayreville, NJ",0,7,3,1.0,1/1/2018,"I came here for New Years Eve and I would not recommend or come here again. Don't let the cheaper price fool you-- this place is horribly run by angry, rude people. We got in line at 9:50 for the 9-2 open bar. It was 12 degrees outside--a record cold for NYC and I saw on the news that 30 min outside could give exposed skin frostbite. I mistakenly wore open toe heels and a dress thinking I wouldn't have to wait on line. The people of Studio 48 do not care-- they had a line that wraps around the block. We thought it would be a quick line; this isn't our first rodeo, it is our third NYE in NYC and no place has EVER made us wait outside. We were wrong. We waited 40 MINUTES OUTSIDE in 12 degree weather before finally let in, only to wait in another huge line for coat check. The temps kept dropping and it was literally inhumane. I am still cold thinking about it and my toes will never recover. This place will NEVER earn my business again. Once inside, you had to wait up the stairs for coat check and we realized this is literally what is holding the line up. They barely found our name on tickets bc they were doing it manually. Y'all ever heard of a scanner? Another problem is the line cutters. A bunch of girls tried cutting us and upon complaining (when waiting over 30 min in frostbite weather, a bunch of us complained to the bouncer), the bouncer told them to just go behind us, as if that solved the problem. So, if you're coming here, you might as well cut the line because management does not care about the people who got frostbite for their crappy club. He actually guided one couple, presumably people he knows, into the line to cut us. It is amazing how much people who've waited for 5 min will complain about the weather and then be mad you are talking badly about them in line.Coat check is a joke. We waited a full hour before actually getting into the club because everyone is so slow. The coat check lady was rude and gave everyone so much attitude. If anyone is that angry please take a deep breath and try some yoga. There were at least 6 people working behind coat check but only the one woman was actually taking coats and giving tickets. Again, the process was extremely slow (it is literally why the line outside was so long, you're waiting just for coat check), inefficient (have multiple people take coats!!!! There are 2 huge windows, use them), and was not helped by the overwhelmingly negative attitude given to us. Coat check was also a nightmare at 2am when everyone left at the end of open bar. They were flooded with people and it was extremely inefficient. Also, they advertise that they show a live broadcast of the NYE ball drop. Their ""live broadcast"" stopped working before midnight and you could not see the ball drop or anything about the new year because there was just the loading sign. 2018 came and there wasn't even a count down or cheer because management was unorganized and the 18 year olds w fake ids were too drunk to notice. My one and only shoutout will go to the bartenders who were very nice and made solid drinks considering it was open bar. They truly were on point and I hope they have a very happy new year.They also advertise passed appetizers and party favors. There were none of either. This isn't what you go for, but it's worth adding another way in which they did not keep their word.This is a level above a frat party. Don't waste your time or money. Spend extra and go somewhere that will treat you with dignity and respect and not make you get hypothermia. In the mean time, I'd like to send my doctors bill directly to Stage 48.",1,,

It was standing room only. There was no room to move. I was down stairs trying to watch it on the so called platform, but being there for the first hour and only 5ft tall, I, couldn't see anything. So I went upstairs and had to watch on a monitor. Really??? I read the reviews before I went, yes, security was rude!!! They made everyone move from stairs except their 4 friends! Drinks are over priced but you expect that and they poured heavy so that was good! I only had one cause it was such an unpleasant atmosphere.

The male person Gavin was great but since we were handed over to the hostess, it all went down. The women spoke mainly Spanish. Now we do but the other people in he tables around us didn't. They brought us our drinks without the 2 champagnes we paid for. It took at least half an hour of talking and checking. Then the woman said, tip is not included and handed us a bill for gratuity before even bringing our drinks in. Then the cherry on top of it is the coat check. We oaid $5 for coat check and i was handed 3 jackets that weren't ours. When I told the only white woman behind the counter, she gave me an attitude. She had already thrown our tickets away at this time and no way of checking which one is ours. When I showed her a photo of my coat, she said ""don't even show me that, I ain't checking, go get a manager!"" She's the only woman who spoke English behind the counter. So I got the manager who was nonchalant. I ultimately decided to leave because people were fighting and cursing the said woman at the coat check. I would not recommend anyone to come to this place. There's no accountability with the staff. If u take my money to ""check my coat"" u better be responsible for the said coat! Most people's coats are at least a few hundred dollars. Mine was!

On the way in, a bouncer told me that i could not wear my hat. I said thats fine and ill just keep it in my pocket. The bouncer then told me i had to pay 10 dollars for the privelege to wear my hat. I told him forget it and id rather just hold it. He told me i could not even bring it in unless i pay the 10 dollars. I said no way and left it in a pile of hats by him and said ill just get it on the way out. Once inside, i must have paid 100 dollars for 4 drinks and a red bull for me and my girlfriend. Fetty never came out. Upon leaving i went to grab my hat, and guess what? The bouncer told me i still had to pay 10 bucks to now get my hat back. I told him some expletives and snatched my hat and left. DO NOT GO TO THIS PIECE OF S**T PLACE.",6,,
71,Jeff K.,"Mount Kisco, NY",0,54,0,4.0,10/2/2016,"Been here 5 or 6 times for 'rock' concerts, so I can't comment on the dance club aspect. Lots of room to move around, different levels for standing on the floor plus a balcony if you want a different view. Couches line the perimeter which is good for old farts like me who can't stand through 2 opening bands plus a headliner.Had a negative experience here recently in that the monitors did not arrive in time for all the bands to sound check. One of the opening bands was cut and the second's set was cut short. The headliner had to be done by 10pm and the fans were chased out of the lobby after buying merch. The band traditionally meets with fans post show and announced from stage that they would not be back to the venue.",,,

76,Dang L.,"Houston, TX",127,113,306,2.0,8/1/2014,"Warning: Even if you buy a $600 bottle service beforehand, you still have to wait in an extremely long line to get in. They stuff everyone in the line like a pig pen. The line with no reservation was moving faster than the one with reservation and bottle service. I don't even know how to rate this place. Clubs usually get a low rating anyway and this is just one account of one of the nights here. For our group, we put all payments on one card to make it easier. The person who was paying for the reservation was charged THREE times. She said they told her that her debit card was declined so she gave the worker a credit card. My friend immediately checked her bank account and there were two transactions, in addition to the one on the credit card too. Ridiculous. Beyond that disaster trying to get in the door, the music inside was alright. Nothing amazing and it wasn't too horrible. It was relatively spacious as well when it wasn't crowded and the place had two floors. Approximately five bars inside I believe. Three on the first floor and two at the top. They have restrooms on both floors. We had bottle service and apparently they were booked that Friday night so we got a table with two chairs for a group of 12. The biggest reason why we go here because it's conveniently close.",9,,

I did not come for anything besides the performer, and a single gin and tonic. I was as patient as I could be. I'd like my money back frankly as I wasn't going to stay until 4AM to see (like all of the videos posted from people who did stay on Instagram) and at least being able to anticipate that from some of the people working in the club would have been nice.

Went here over the weekend for Halloween. PROMOTERS DON'T KEEP THEIR WORD. I was promised 8 comp entrance tickets for a package of two bottles. Got there and they only allowed 6 of us free entry. So instead they promised us champagne at the beginning of the night and then forgot our champagne. The venue was tiny and unorganized. Had my group standing there for 20 minutes cus they couldn't read their own seating charts. Waited another 20 minutes for our bottles to come after being seated. Then they brought me the wrong bottles, least our waitress brought over the right ones over quickly.Some girl who wasn't even our waitress came up to our table and said we could only buy bottled or seltzer water. We've been going straight to the bar for tap water. NO ONE IN AMERICA CHARGES FOR WATER! If we're paying $700 for the night the least you can do is offer us free water. Waitress stalked me onto the crowded ass dance floor to sign the check. I don't know why they couldn't wait till the end of the night or at least until i was at the table to give me the check. Such a mood killer dancing and signing a check. Some girl pooped all over the floor in the bathroom and no one came to address the smell for an eternity while we waited in line smelling the stinky poop. Dance floor was smaller than the size of my bathroom, felt like a packed sardine in there. Security will try to kick anyone they find puking or not acting right. One of my friends puked neatly into the toilet, made no mess at all, but security was waiting out side the bathroom to take him out. Only reason they didn't was because we said we have a table, and they couldn't kick the whole table out on the account of one sick person who was sober enough to make it to the bathroom, wait in line, and aim for the toilet.",2,2,

Hot 97 had threw a party here with all their top DJs, and the place was jumpin all night. Hip Hop, Trap, Reggae, Soca--What More Can You Ask For?   Came her with my friends for a girls night out. We RSVP'd for free entry, so I don't know how much the cover charge normally is. There was a line down the block when we arrived after 11pm, so two of my friends waited in line while my other friend and I searched for street parking. It took us about 20 minutes to find a park (which was only 3 blocks away) and by that time our friends were at the front of the line. They had everyone enter threw their 2nd floor entrance, where they checked tickets and also had coat check. Coat check is not mandatory, but was reasonably priced at $4. The club has two floors, the main floor was wayyy more packed than the top. I would assume because the 2nd floor became really hot as the night went on and more people arrived.  (I guess heat really does rise lol)  I went to 1 female bartender all night, because the drinks she made were really strong; made it worth the $14 for cranberry & vodka.

The whole process to get in was inefficient: from waiting in line outside the door, getting frisked inside, having to wait in line up the narrow stairs, the crowded mandatory coat check, and then checking tickets again at the small door of the second floor.I forgot there might be mandatory coat check and didn't bring $4 cash. They wouldn't take credit card (despite having a machine conveniently nearby), and wouldn't let me make a quick phone call to friends inside (apparently I was taking up space) . The short spiky haired asian guy at the door had a total attitude problem.I went home, it wasn't worth my time or patience to hobble to an ATM machine or to bother with rude, attitude-prone dbags.*Apparently, I missed seeing a cool fight inside later on in the night!",9,3,2

It just seems like a magical moment with lights, heat and shirtless men. Stage 48 is a bit pricey though. In fact, admission for my party was $35 per person. Drinks were also around $10 or more. That's asking a lot of money for a dance club. With all the bodies in here, it got way to hot to endure. Actually, that is the number 1 reason why we left. We couldn't deal with the heat. The music is okay. I like bumble gum pop dance music or dance hits on the radio (give or take a 3-5 year radius). The music here was neither of those two. Maybe it appeals to someone. Here is a secret, play some super gay remixes of current pop songs, and people will go crazy... at any kind of party.",3,6,1

We were never told this before. We had about 10 people and ordered drinks at the bar. Later on during the night we ended up getting the champagne and were happy about that.The promoters are very rude and degrading. One came to our table and tried to kick us out when we were still drinking our champagne claiming it was ""his"" table.

This is what you call a ""cheap"" club, yet overpriced for everything they try to sell you.I came here for an event and I had to painfully wait for an hour before going in and I don't know if the people that work here is the problem or the people who work for the event was. The admission went from $20 to $25 in a matter of 5 minutes--who the hell pays $25 to get into a club unless you're here to watch a 40-year-old Britney Spears strip? Luckily, I knew someone on the guest list so I walked past the people at the door like a VIP. I've got to say..for a club, this is one of the biggest and spacious venues I've been to. There are two floors with plenty of room but the main floor is where the fun really gets. Don't even think about buying bottles unless you're subconscious about blowing at least $300 a bottle that you and your group will only drink half of. The drinks are expensive and twice the price of a bar but most importantly, water is free! Beer will run you down $8.The scene is like a mini Vegas and you'll see drunks dancing on the couches with their vodka bottles up. Music is not good but still danceable to since it's not typical club music. The layout of this place is pretty neat; bars on all 4 sides of the club and plenty of seats but that's pretty much it.

Tickets were $50, which is insane, but I guess it was to raise funds.... anyway, with that kind of price tag, you'd think it's open bar. But no. Each drink was minimum $12. The event took place on the third floor. There were two lines, one for this fundraiser and one for a concert. My line moved quickly. Coat check was free, and the guy doing it wasn't rude or anything. The place was quite spacious. There was lots of seating space. A complaint I have is that there was a step near the bar where everyone kept falling. This was the cause for THREE people tripping and spilling their drinks all over me. THREE. Who put that step there? Also, one bathroom in the entire place? One bathroom for both men and women to share? Stage48 is also in the middle of nowhere. Past 11th Ave?? Who exists past 11th Ave? At least it was easy to grab a cab on 11th Ave but I left around midnight. Not sure how it'd be around 3am/4am. Also, yes, parking is very shady around here, and the bouncers are paid off to scare you into parking on the street and take your car to a lot and pay.

However, this venue is very outdated and definitely not classy enough for a corporate event. It's not well-maintained at all and actually felt really dirty.We had signed a contract for open bar and passed hors d'oeuvres. The only positive I have for this place was that drinks were quick to get as we had the bar to ourselves and top shelf liquor was included. Negatives were that the food was coming out too slow and ended before our time was up leaving my guests hungry and unsatisfied.The biggest negative throughout this experience though was planning with their event planner. He was often unreachable when trying to confirm this event. My company plans many corporate events and I have never dealt with someone more unprofessional. It took weeks to confirm this event as he was never in his office! When we finally met him at the event, he was just as arrogant and rude. Needless to say, we will never hold another event here again. If you're looking to plan an event, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.

As you approach the entrance, the bouncers ask what party you're there for and they kindly direct you to the correct entrance (I think they have separate entrances for each level). As we were waiting for our bottles at the table, one of the girls from the front came up to notify us that some random girls were trying to get in using my lady's bday party to get in. The fact that the staff had a feeling they weren't part of our party was clutch on their part. Our bottle girl was also very nice by recommending which table would be most comfortable for us all.

Good music though, they need to make the VIPs more private. If your paying all this money for bottles, you would think it would be a little more closed off for your group.

Intimate and cozy spot to view a show with good sight lines of the stage on the main level. Had plenty of seating with tables, chairs, and some sideline leather couches. Good air conditioning.

Nice professional staff here too.Seems they have plenty of live acts and concerts scheduled here throughout the year.

104,Lisa C.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",36,224,353,1.0,1/1/2013,"Went here for the grand opening on NYE 2013.  This was the WORSE club experience I've ever had. The place was overcrowded and people that behave aggressively due to alcohol (e.g behaving obnoxiously, screeching at bouncers, pushing people) should be removed from the venue for safety reasons... and it was only 10:30pm!).Positives:- General admission line moved pretty quickly, bouncers outside were pretty nice.- The asian(?) male bartender on the second floor was awesome.  Took my drink orders as soon as I arrived at the bar and made them pretty quick, definitely gave him a nice tip (unlike the male bartender downstairs - more on him later in the negatives).-Coat check workers kept up a polite attitude despite rude patrons and chaotic atmosphere (see below)Negatives (there are a lot):1. Coat check line upstairs was a COMPLETE NIGHTMARE/DISASTER/ FIGHTS WAITING TO HAPPEN.  Let me explain:  Once you enter the main floor through a set of doors, there is a set of stairs that leads you up to the second floor (and underneath these stairs is a bar).  Once you get upstairs, to the left of you is a set of doors (with an EXIT sign above) that leads to the coat check balcony.There was one bouncer guarding the door and letting people in slowly.  Unfortunately, there was NO organized line, so people were cutting and shoving their way to the front.  Add the traffic from people walking up/down the stairs = lots of pushing/shoving (especially by the clearly drunk people).  This made the bouncer not only yell at everyone to step back but PHYSICALLY PUSH patrons back.  When things get physical like that, it's clearly a sign that things are out of control. I waited 40 minutes to check my coat and gave up.Later, we went through a different set of stairs to try & check in our coats. Before you go into the main room on the 1st floor, there is a set of stairs that leads you straight to the 2nd floor where the coat check balcony is.... no wonder the coat check line from the other end was barely moving.  You have two coat check entry points with no organized lines.  Just a mass of people huddled around the two coat check windows on the small balcony and people trying to go up/down the stairs to enter the actual club space in both directions.  A COMPLETE MESS!Trying to get your coat BACK was the same ordeal. Also, people shouted out coat check numbers without having a ticket to hand in. Other places have a policy where if you lose your coat check ticket, you have to wait until the END of the night to get your coat back.  Why doesn't this place do the same?Suggestions for improvement:  Have everyone go through the first set of stairs to check their coats and enter the club space through the second floor.  Make everyone stand in one or two lines for the two coat check windows along the stairwell.  2. The aforementioned stairwell (that resides over the first floor bar) is a safety concern.  People were tossing ice. drinks, and GLASS (yes glass!!!) into the bar below and at people waiting by the bar for drinks.  The girl bartender downstairs took pictures of the glass and later shut down the bar (I don't blame her).3. There was a male bartender downstairs that repeatedly ignored my drink requests.  I was politely waiting (with cash in hand for tips) for about 20 minutes and decided to give up after he kept catering to the same customers that ordered 10 drinks at a time (and tipped far too less for 10 drinks) & even took orders from people who talked trash about him and were rude when requesting their drinks.  Also, he spent a lot of time cleaning up the bar and reorganizing bottles, at a really slow pace even though there were so many people waiting for drinks... Girl bartender was working hard though and didn't discriminate, props to her.  4. Not enough trash cans or places to dispose of drinks. Dance floor was disgusting (like the floor of subway trains when it rains) because there were spilled drinks, cups, beer bottles everywhere.5. A lot of trashy patrons.  No, I don't want you to randomly throw ice/liquor/champagne at me or my friends.  See, it'd be different if we knew one another and agreed to douse each other in alcohol.  But we don't know one another and I don't want my hair/clothes/shoes to be drenched in liquor. ever.  And I don't want to see you humping each other like bunnies on the dance floor either. Get a room.6. People throwing drinks/ice from second floor balcony to people on dance floor below.7. Men (or should I say boys?) pushing women on the coat check line. 8. Drunk girls cutting the bathroom line saying ""excuse me, I need to use the bathroom"" and rushing into the next open stall... What do you think this line is for?AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",15,9,1
105,Dante A.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",0,2,2,1.0,1/4/2013,"I wish I could give something zero stars, but you can't. If you could, Stage 48 would deserve it. The most unorganized, hole in the wall establishment known to man. Their NYE was a LIE claiming that there 3 floors of VIP with views of the stars and NYC skylines. There were: A) only two floors B) No one checking VIP wristbands so everyone was VIP. C) 1 bathroom in the whole fucking place D) NO ROOF ACCESS High School boys and girls attended this event. The bouncer was a joke. Underrage girls puking were being dragged out of the place. There was 1 person working the coat check in a 100 person line. The music was AWFUL. Not even house, rap, or 90s or anything! It was just beats nobody had ever heard for 5 hours straight.There was no champagne toast which was promised on the NYE package. This place is a piece of SHIT. If you're a band, DJ, or someone looking for a good night in the city NEVER EVER GO TO STAGE 48 OR GIVE THEM A DOLLAR OR A MINUTE OF YOUR TIME.",16,1,1
106,M H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,66,5,1.0,5/17/2016,"TERRIBLE VENUE!!!! When there are hundreds of people in this space, you can't see the stage from anywhere, including the balconies! Small, bad traffic flow, miserable place. I will never go back. It would MAYBE be okay if there were 100 people or less, but then it wouldn't have a stage...Also TINY drinks for $10. In flimsy thin plastic cups where half your drink spills if someone knocks your elbow. Also was there for a live TV event and half the time the TVs were turned off by the guards so people wouldn't stand near the doors. Disorganized communication between staff... I watched them discuss the TVs and none of them even noticed this issue and another TV saying ""no signal"" until several people told them",1,1,
107,Yujin O.,"New York, NY",138,202,110,3.0,1/1/2015,"Bunch of my friends and I went for the new years eve party. We got the vip pass to access the mezz level.First off, the music was great!But as the night went on probably due to open bar it got trashy real quick.They have wooded plank floor and it was literally all spilled with alcohol and empty cups& water bottles.  and the mezz level is designed with a bar located 3 steps above the 2nd floor, so alot of people were slipping and falling. I honestly think that someone could die from cracking a neck bone... It is not safe at all... Many people were hammered and since it was almost impossible to use the bathroom or go up and down the stairs to go to the dance floor or mezz level, it was alot of pushing and shoving and drinks spilling all over the place. But i believe it was worse this day since they made seating areas for the more upgraded tickets. So i would try it again sometime this year and hope the circulation is better.Oh and the coat check location really needs to change, one is right next to the stairs which does not give enough clearance for the line for coat and a line to just pass through (also very dangerous) And the second coat check is in a narrow hall, almost impossible to have two lines.",3,,2
108,William P.,"Elmhurst, NY",100,107,49,3.0,1/14/2013,"I just went to this venue for the first time over the weekend (I think its new) and thought it was pretty cool. While it is out of the way, over by the Con Ed building in Hells Kitchen, its definitely a cool venue to check a band or performer. I went out to see GZA of the Wu Tang, and a few other interesting acts that opened for him.  So lets start with what I liked about the place. First off its two floors, and just the right size, so even if its packed you'll get a good view. The second thing I liked was the all the available seating. There is a lot for a general admission music venue, and if you get there early enough you can score some pretty choice spots. I would suggest up stairs along the railing, bucket seating. The best seat in the house has to be right above the stage, for no extra fee you can have your own seating and table. An added bonus is the wait staff that comes by to ask for drinks, pretty cool. If you are going to see an act you really like, and they're playing here, I would suggest you go for it. Other then that the front door staff seemed pretty lax and were friendly. The last thing I would mention is drinks, expect to pay eight bucks for domestic beers, plus tip.",4,,

110,Vanessa K.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,8,1,3.0,3/20/2015,"I was here for a concert on a weeknight and after that experience I would go again. The environment felt more clubby than other concert venues in NYC (hello gigantic disco ball) but it does frequently operate as a club so that makes sense. There was plenty of floor space and with a sold out show, it didn't feel cramped at all. The sound was great and there was a wide range of lighting effects during the show so the place is fully equipped to handle a variety of acts. The one thing I didn't like was the coat check process. It is located upstairs and the staircase is narrow so once the show ended, loads of people were bottlenecked on the first floor. Once you made it to the second floor, there was still a ton of people standing around in no real order or line, waiting for the coat check. It just seems like there is not enough space for where the coat check is but there is probably not much they can do to change that. The people working the coat check do move pretty quickly though.",1,,1

114,Austin C.,"Tarrytown, NY",142,26,3,1.0,10/6/2014,"I should have listened to my friends who told me how awful this place is, but the opportunity to see Rakim AND Slick Rick in NYC doesn't come around very often, so I took my chances. The first thing we find out is the first headliner, Slick Rick, is scheduled for 10:30 p.m., and the main act, Rakim, for 11:45 p.m. A late start time at a hip-hop show is to be expected, but why have the doors open at 6:30 and no re-entry? So we go in and show the host our VIP reserved seating tickets and she tells us to go downstairs and we'll find seats. We go downstairs and there is absolutely no sign of where we should sit, and nobody to ask where to go. Finally I asked the bartender who responded with a nasty tone and dirty look ""I dunno yo"" (he later served me a 4 ounce, poorly mixed drink for $14). Eventually we found our overpriced ""VIP"" seats conveniently located in the very back of the room, no thanks to the staff. The first act was tolerable. It was a mediocre DJ playing classic hip hop, with some talent-less fools occasionally singing a verse here and there. The next group, called ""Eiffel Life"", was literally the WORST act I've ever seen in my life. After about 4 more hours of awful opening acts, with the exception of one reggae band from Long Island who were actually pretty good, Slick Rick finally gets on stage around 11:30. His performance was somewhat enjoyable, but the sound was absolutely terrible. Couldn't understand a word he said, could barely make out what songs he was doing, and the entire production just sounded like noise (I guess being seated in the very back of the venue turned out to be a good thing, for the sake of our ears). So now it's about 12:20, and guess what? MORE TERRIBLE SUPPORT ACTS. Rakim comes on after 1 a.m,. and again, you can't hear anything but a concoction of awful noise. 20 people on stage, each with their own microphone, yelling ""YEAH YEAH WHAT YEAH"" over the main act. We stayed for about 10 minutes of his performance and got the @#$% out of there. Nas was right. Hip-Hop is dead. And venues like this are putting a nail in the coffin.",3,1,2
115,Elaine W.,"Queens, NY",85,195,310,3.0,11/6/2014,"This is my first time rating a club/lounge, so I don't really have anything to compare this to. My overall experience was good. Went to a concert here the day before Halloween. The venue was smaller than imagined, but still spacious. The security people were nice and down to earth. The lounge chairs/sofas were comfy and it seemed like there was a lot of seats. The lighting and sound system were good. I guess my cons would be that the location of this place is in the middle of nowhere. I mean, yeah I know it's a club and probably shouldn't be in a residential area, but I wished it was a little closer to midtown area. Or a drug store should open near here. My other somewhat complaint is the ladies bathroom stalls. They are so narrow and so close to the sinks. I know there's a lot of girls at lounges/clubs and girls break the seal faster than guys, but com'on. People can barely pass each other while they washed their hands. On the plus side, there is a bathroom attendant. I think the drinks are okay priced for NYC. I don't know how it is on a regular basis, but I think it's an okay place to have a good time.",3,,

When I get there I told them I won tickets on WSOU and the door lady says ""No you didn't there are two winners and they are both inside already"" So I called the radio station, radio station calls them, and I finally get in. I got there just on time for Nile, but it was some BS that they could not tell me what time the headline act was going on when I called earlier in the night.Now that I'm finally in the show it should just be good times full steam ahead right? Wrong. I'm a pit guy. I will be in the pit the entire time if I'm not up against the stage screaming the lyrics. About three songs into the set and A LOT of flying fists later I sit down to take a breather. Next thing I know I look up and I'm surrounded by security. One of the security guys says to me ""You gotta go bro"" and I'm like ""What? What happened? Is there no moshing or something? I can turn it down"" I don't know how much of that security heard being that the band was ripping through one of their many tasty tunes, but they didn't care anyway. So now I'm being dragged out. When we were out of the main concert area I tried reasoning with security and I said again ""What did I do?"" and I could not believe what they said next. ""You know what you did...you grabbed that girl""...""WHAT?!?! WHAT GIRL?!?! Did I hit a girl?"" "" No you were hanging out on the balcony and grabbed a girl now you have to go"" Note : When I go to metal shows I do not find it necessary to put on some facade and dig up one of my old metal shirts, dress in all black, or anything of the sort. As a matter of fact my buddy's bust my chops because I have a clean cut appearance and I'm usually the only guy in the pit with a button up collard shirt. My friend always asks if we're going to a meeting or a concert. Back to being kicked out... I say to bouncers ""I believe you guys are mistaken I've been in the pit the entire time. I didn't even know there is a balcony"" the bouncer gives me a look as if he know's it's all wrong and say ""Sorry bro a girl pointed  you out and that's it"" That is some bullshit. Seriously some girl who's parents did a shit job raising her (clearly if she's at a Nile concert) just points and says that guy grabbed me and I'm out? Come on.

What pissed me off is that the girl charging cover refused to acknowledge that our friend had a comp list for a birthday party. This no doubt had to do with our arriving a little bit early, before the birthday boy showed up to the club, in an attempt to avoid lines.

For example Stageforty8 you can get two drinks and two beers for $40 whereas at the Gansevort itll set you back $55.The atmosphre was awesome.  Staff was VERY serious when searching you. If your sneaking something in they will find it!!!! So don't even try unless you want your stuff thrown out, you know what i meanI will deffinitely go back to stageforty8",1,,
148,Mala K.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,4.0,11/23/2015,This is an amazing place it reminds me of a club I used to go back home in my country.

150,Elle W.,"Ridgewood, NY",253,3,3,1.0,2/5/2014,"I went to Stage 48 for Whisper's TurntUP event on 1/24/2014. It was in celebration of my birthday. I got myself a table and bottle service. The event clearly indicated that two bottles including the table service was $500 before tax and tips.I was already a bit tipsy by the time they returned for the bill to be signed. The amount due was $689.38 and I paid total $750 after tipping them.Later the next morning, I double checked my receipt and remembered that the bottle service should've only been $500+tips= $550 max. and tips would be for me to decide correct?I called their customer service line and was told that my transaction was correct. Apparently, the $689.38 total balance included taxes and tips.( IF I WERE TO CALCULATE THE TAXES FOR A $500 CHARGE, ACCORDING TO NYC STATE TAX, IT SHOULD ONLY BE $44 WORTH OF TAXES) that would mean they charged me $145 for tips. that's about 27% gratuity!!!! (and lets not forget I gave an extra $60 for tips because I saw there was a ""TIP"" section)I spoke to several people over the phone in regards to these absurd charges. Apparently since I had already signed, they took advantage and would not give me a refund of the difference I overpaid.I do not recommend going to this venue for a good night out. The staff is unreasonable. It is clearly wrong how they charge for service. And the receipt doesnt even have the details of the transactions. Just the total amount being charged, A ""TIP"" SECTION, AND TOTAL TO BE SWIPED ON THE CARD.I am not even complaining about the attitude they gave me during my dispute phone call. OR THE FACT THAT I WAITED IN 12 DEGREE WEATHER IN LINE TO GET IN BECAUSE THE DOORS DID NOT OPEN TILL AN HOUR AFTER THE DOORS WERE STATED TO BE OPEN.",1,,

154,Ashley K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,22,0,1.0,10/9/2015,"I produce events globally so let me state my POV is coming from this angle. I was recently here to help manage an event the day of. Simply put, there's far too many cons than pros. CONS: The location is horrible, venue layout is haphazard, there's not enough bathrooms and they have far too many stairs (3 floors) with the elevator being out of service. When alcohol is involved, it's always about safety of the guests. Thus, the less chance for accidents, the better. They did have a staff member in the dark, grungy, narrow stairway watching to make sure people don't trip. But the sight of an employee just standing smack in the middle of an already narrow stairway is not appealing, especially when you have groups of people utilizing these stairs. (Why they don't renovate the stairs or get the elevator to work is beyond me.)The servers were all well-mannered. In terms of management, ehhh = they left a lot to be desired. I train my team to ALWAYS be gracious no matter how the ""guest(s)"" may appear, for I have many clients/donors who dress ""comfortably"" despite their multi-million $$$ status.Granted, none of the management knew who I was for I literally popped in 2 hours before showtime to help assist a colleague. Nevertheless, whenever I asked questions/requested changes, their attitude was uncalled for. They were never blatantly rude but the arrogance was apparent that they didn't want to deal with 'event staff,' only the client. This is one of the worst mistakes mgt. can do, for you never know who can be your potential client. I actually was there not only to help out a fellow peer but scope out the venue for I have a full list of events to produce in 2016 and need to lock in the locations. Well, guess what? They're now on my ""Do not use unless desperate"" venue list. LoLThe food and drinks were good though. They also had a lot of staff so the event breakdown was quick which was great. In terms of PROs, I think this was it.",,,
155,B R.,"Clifton, NJ",0,16,6,5.0,5/7/2013,"The first time I attended this venue was for and Alegria party. Although the fire alarm went off multiple times during the event, I did not let it get in the way of my fun. The place was clean, the music was pumpin and the setup was downright gorgeous.  I do not expect much more from an NYC nightclub. I admit I initially had a problem with security, but the moment I complained, a manager was quick to put them in their place.Since then, I have been attending Viva Saturdays on a regular basis and always have a great time. While it may not be like the marathon parties of New York's heyday, it sure is the next best thing.",2,1,
156,Terresa L.,"New York, NY",140,78,137,4.0,6/24/2015,"I've been here for a few times, once for a fashion show, another time for Shutterstock, as well as for a new watch launch. It is a great space for events like these. There is a huge first floor with a 2nd floor where others can view from above, as well as bathrooms in another space and another small room. I look forward to many more unique events here despite the long walk to 12th Avenue!",,,
157,Adam G.,"New York, NY",29,430,171,2.0,12/15/2013,Saw a show here.  Sound was pretty poor at first.  Drinks were kinda expensive.  Whole audience got herded out fast after the show.  Considering it is in manhattan it is remarkably far from a subway.,,,
158,Rachel C.,"Long Island, NY",128,43,5,2.0,1/1/2015,"Went here for New Years Eve Paid for a table of 6 in VIP Mezzanine package.  It was NOT a table. It was a tiny little square table (usual in clubs) but the chairs were too close together that you couldn't even fit 6 people and the entire night we ended up defending our seats from under age kids. The bouncers at the front door told people to walk around the block and then he would let them in. If you are looking for a diverse group of people this is not the place, it was mostly white catty girls and frat guys. Got into a fight and threw a girl to the ground in here after she started pulling my girls hair. The bathroom situation here was a joke. The bottle service was nice though. Overall I would never use this place for larger groups. It was over crowded, people were doing coke next to us and the seated area for 250 a piece where crappy. You had to defend your chairs and bottle and drinks where all over the floors by the end of the night. If this were my venue and I experienced what I had I would truly think about re doing my whole set up. The security was a waste of money people would jump over the dividers between VIP and the main areas and no one did a thing about it. The staff was nice but they were over powered by the number of people in the space. If you are underage and got a fake you can definitely go here, they just look , they don't do any light checks. There were tons of fights on the dance floor and between girls and guys. The security did nothing even though there were at least 20 huge guys in the place. It was not acceptable most of the time.",3,,
159,Denise P.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,375,245,2.0,1/19/2013,Went here to see Cracker. The place is attractive and tickets were reasonable ($20).  There is seating but most of it was reserved and so we ended up standing. Drinks were stupidly overpriced and the sound was not very good. I would probably go back because of the ticket price and because you can get fairly close to the artists (it's small) but would plan to arrive at least an hour before the show to get a table.,2,1,1

167,Talia T.,"Bronx, NY",0,2,0,1.0,6/1/2015,"Let me start off by saying that if I could give this place zero stars, I would in a heartbeat. I have never felt as though money spent was such a waste at than when I went to this club. I went to Stage 48 for an afterprom party on May 21st, 2015. When I looked online, I thought it would be a pretty cool place; great music, club scene, and awesome V.I.P. perks. Overall great club atmosphere. Boy was I wrong!    On the website, it stated for a good 3 months (which is how long we had our tickets for before the actual event) that people who paid $60 for V.I.P. tickets would receive; free drinks all night, complementary glow stick, line skipping, as well as access to a V.I.P. lounge area. The day before the event, I checked online again and the endless free drinks was changed to 1 complimentary drink. What!? It became clear from that point that the 'club' would use false advertising to collect more money from vulnerable teens.    For starters, when my group and I arrived at the club (around 2am), there was a line. And we, although we were V.I.P., had to wait on it. When we tried to tell them we were V.I.P. they did not acknowledge us, even though we were absolutely positive that they heard us, but they did give us V.I.P. wristbands, so I hoped for a smoother night afterward.    So when we finally get inside, the place is PACKED. I understand that a lot of people would want to come out after prom (like I did) so this was not a big deal. However, their so called ""V.I.P. area"" is the biggest scam ever. The area was open for anyone to hang out in. There was no cutoff point for people who paid for general admission.    At that point in the night, I continued to try and get my moneys worth, and dance with my friends. (even though we literally could not move on the dancefloor). After a while of dancing, I got thirsty and decided to get my single complimentary drink. I walk over to the bar, and ask the bartender what kinds of drinks V.I.P. could get me. I know because it is an underage party that the most would be soda and/or juice, but I was not expecting ""nothing"" to be an option. The bartender (who is literally taking selfies with her phone while speaking to me) tells me that ""V.I.P. does not work here"" and that ""I can't get anything with that."" (my wristband). When I ask how much a drink is, she tells me ""$10."" For Soda. There's no way in hell.     Pissed off, I walk angrily back to my friends and tell them about the situation. That's when a friend of mine (who came before I did) told me that she received a  voucher for her complimentary drink. I then realize that they scammed my whole group by deciding not to give us vouchers. I immediately go back to the front entrance asking for a ticket as I did not receive one. The man at the door literally tells me ""I have no more"". WHAT. I start to get upset at this point because a club knows how many tickets they sell and therefore how many people to expect. I tell the guy this and he says to me ""What do you want me to do, I have no more."" I WANT YOU TO GET MORE. I PAID FOR THIS. He then tells me to see another man, which I immediately do. I just want what I paid for.     I go to the other man, and while walking up to him, I see that he has a roll of ticket voucher's in his hand so I become relieved. That is until I explained my situation and he tells me ""I think I remember giving you a ticket."" WHAT. I then get so angry and start telling him that ""there is no way.... ""when he smiles as if all of this is a joking matter and gives me a ticket. He does the same with my friend behind me (who also did not get a ticket). At that point I was officially pissed off with this party.   THE TRUTH IS THAT STAGE 48 EXPLOITS YOUNG TEENAGERS WITH THE PROMISE OF A GOOD TIME TO GET MORE MONEY FROM THEM. AND THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE YOUNG BY NOT GIVING THEM EXACTLY WHAT THEY PAID FOR/OR WHAT THEIR PARENTS PAID FOR. THERE IS NO REASON THAT THEY SHOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF/EXPLOIT TEENS FOR THEIR GAIN.   At this point in the night, I am absolutely heated. I get my complementary drink (ginger ale, which is absolutely watered down) and try to continue dancing, expressing my points to anyone I can. BECAUSE THEY ARE A CLUB DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANYONE.    They close off the ""V.I.P. area"" and people begin to leave. It is around 4 am now. As my friends and I are leaving, I walk out with the most dissapointed/ disgusted expression on my face, and to rub salt in the wound, a man outside says to me ""Little girl you better put a smile on your face."" Seriously. How dare you. It is clear that the ""security"" and promoters there understand their scam and relish in the benefit they receive from it.To recap, because I know this is a long post, Stage 48 is an absolute ripoff. I share my story to save anyone from an experience like this. Please, please avoid. And share your story if you experienced something similar to warn others.",7,2,2

It was set up for general admission and there wasn't a bad place to be downstairs.  They have couches and tables set up upstairs, but you'd have to be one of the first few people there to snag one of those.If there was another act there I was interested in, I'd come back.",1,,
178,Elizabeth M.,"Garden City, NY",153,2,0,1.0,7/1/2016,"This was one of the WORST experiences I have ever had! I was absolutely disgusted by the whole thing.  Everything about this place is a scam.  Not only do you not skip the line as a V.I.P but the drinks at the bar on the V.I.P. level are not the included ones, how convenient! Not to mention the kind of people in this club.  After waiting at least twenty minutes on a line to get into this horrendous club.  I was pushed out of the way by a bouncer as an ambulance pulled up to take this girl, who was completely unconscious, to the hospital.  After another five minutes waiting for them to get her out, my friends and I were greeted by five other scumbags so drunk they didn't even have the neck control to keep their heads into the trashcans in which they were projectile vomiting into (don't worry it gets better!).  Then after being, again pushed, up the stairs to the main floor, the V.I.P. section was located up two more flights of stairs.  When my friends and I arrived there, we actually thought it was somewhat nice, you know if you can look past the amount of drunk couples hooking up like zoo animals around you, but I guess thats prom night for you! We all tried to make the best of it and stay for 40 min, we tried not to waste our $60 admission.  We stayed right up until I went down to the ground to pick up  a glow stick, another thing V.I.Ps were supposed to get included, and it was covered in someone's puke. My friends and all agreed that it was time to call the limo driver as I ran to the bathroom to clean off my germ-ridden hand to discover even more vomit covering the walls, toilets and sinks as the bathroom attendants yelled to each other, laughing at how stupid everyone was in Spanish.  Bottom line is if you are a group of friends looking for some innocent fun after what is supposed to be the best night of high school, steer clear of this place.  My friends and were not dressed correctly or drunk enough for this party.  If you're looking for a place to chuck your guts though, enjoy this place, just hope you don't go to overboard and get taken out in a stretcher!",,1,

Once inside it was SO packed my friend and I COULD NOT MOVE an inch. I've never touched or rubbed against more people or been touched more at a bar in my life. Eventually had to sneak into VIP just to even be able to relax or breathe. Now all of this might just be bad planning on the promoters end and not the bars fault, either way the worst time ever.

So I'm am very disappointed by the services I was provided, and the manager was NOT friendly as ALL. The price was not worth it and we might as well go to another club that are friendlier to customers. The manager was rude and she would not meet our needs. I asked her for a $50ticket and she refused me by $10 !!!!!!!!!! What kind of service is that. Don't go to this club it's not worth it and it's empty anyways. Also what's really hypocritical is that as I was leaving the club the manager that denied me was smoking a cigarette outside the club and saw me leaving.

She then began to point and continue to scream and embarass me.  I was shocked.  Never in my life had I been treated like this in a bar.  I consider myself to have very good bar manners, and the fact that this was an open bar and I had just tipped generously the drink before, this was disheartening.  The reason I'm sending this email is because I was having a great time until this happened, and now me and my friends are skeptical to ever come back (there were 23 of us).  I would hope that you re-evaluate the type of people that you let serve drinks in your club because this kind of behavior has a group of 23 people talking poorly of the night because of one shocking situation that we had all witnessed.  I hope you take proper actions to make sure the club does not continue to operate like this, because I would like to come back if I know I won't be mistreated again.",1,,

191,A M.,"Trenton, NJ",12,11,0,3.0,2/20/2013,"Saw the Residents there last weekend. Pretty nice venue with 2 levels and plenty of bars. More of a dance club than a concert hall, but still manages to have decent sight lines. Only real con about the place was the sound, it would cut in and out and go from loud to soft constantly. Since it's a new place, hopefully they're just working out the kinks.",,,
192,Rosario R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,1,1.0,2/5/2016,"This is one of the worst experiences that I have had reserving a party package for Level 3 at Stage 48. I had done a booking online for a table reservation but it was a little complicated so it took me a while. I tried booking it for Friday, February 12th and got a confirmation through email but just in case, I called in to make sure it was confirmed. This was January 25th. After three phone calls and countless emails, I was reassured that my package was booked by several of their staff and it was settled. Today February 5th, I received an email saying that Level 3 was not opened on Fridays and I should move my birthday to that Saturday or any other Saturday. My first reaction was to call them immediately and see what was up. According to the woman that I talked on the phone with, someone ""overlooked the date"" and did not notice that the 12th was a Friday. So you mean to tell me it took almost two weeks for you to realize this? On ALL my emails it explicitly had said Friday, February 12th and they were quick to say yes to it all. After asking if there was no way for me to book it on Friday, she told me that stage 48 was closed on all Fridays..... Excuse me? I got fed up and cancelled my booking but never again will I reserve something here. Completely unprofessional.",,,
193,Harris M.,"New York, NY",16,15,0,2.0,3/2/2013,"Fire Alarms. Fix them please. It's not cute to have 20 min breaks in music while the NYFD comes to give you a green light. Getting in was a maze of stairs and passages. Security was awful (no hats? really?). On the positive side, nice modern open layout and plenty of bars. Please fix these problems and you'd be a great and needed addition to HK scene.",,,
194,Melis K.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,1,0,4.0,5/21/2013,i just went there last Friday because of my birthday. At the beginning it was not that much crowded but then it become nicer. I met with Nick there and thats all. Guys are hot in there. I am definitely advising that place for hang out girl to girl. Btw i want to say Hi Nick from here. Hi Nick thanks for the gift for my birthday,,,
195,Gabriela A.,"Charlotte, NC",11,41,0,2.0,11/8/2014,"As a concert venue, Stage 48 is NOT OPTIMAL. I went to see J. Roddy Waltson and the Business on 11/7/14 and was underwhelmed. You definitely can tell that this is a club/lounge and not a concert venue. Unless you're the first or second row of people standing in the front of the stage, or have a prime spot with chairs on the second level, it's almost impossible to see the band play. The sound mix wasn't great - it was hard to hear the vocals, but on the upside the bass and drums were not overpowering. If you're a music lover, try to see the band(s) elsewhere.",,,
196,Alex L.,"Astoria, NY",1,30,1,2.0,4/27/2014,"I decided to try Stage 48 on Saturday night for their Viva event as I had heard good things. First, the location is a bit far out in Hell's Kitchen (past 11th Ave), but, if it's a good club, it would be worth the extra distance. I was there between about 11:30 and midnight. It wasn't particularly crowded at that time and only a handful of people were actually dancing. The age group of the people attending seemed a bit older than some of the popular gay clubs in New York. The setup of the venue itself was nice - good layout, nice lighting, etc. But the single most important thing to me in a club is the music. If you like pop/top 40's music, don't go here. It is the random, unrecognizable electronic/dance music that you will not be familiar with. I am not impressed with this establishment, or at least this event. If you're looking for a good club on a Saturday night, I'd recommend Therapy (also in Hell's Kitchen). It's a bit more crowded, but the music is drastically better, again, if you prefer pop/top 40's. If nothing else, they put a large piece of lime in my drink...that kind of made me happy...",1,1,
197,Ross M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,0,1.0,3/25/2013,"I went on 3/21/2013 for the Rakim and Raekwon show.  The event info I read said doors open at 6:00, show starts at 8:00.  We showed up at 8:10, there's a line around the block and doors aren't open yet.  We go to the hotel across the street to chill and kill time.  We went back around 9:00, was pretty quick to get in, was then directed to walk upstairs.  There's a roped off path to the third floor for mandatory coat check.  It was well run and not super long, but it felt a little out of hand that we had to coat check and it was so far away.  Ok.The opening DJ, Peter Rosenberg, was horrible.  He did a set of DJ Premier tracks because it was Premier's birthday.  He couldn't mix or scratch, and he got on the mic and talked on the mic.  There was another act that literally got booed off the stage, then Pete Rock played.  There were equipment problems and about 20 minutes of nothing before Peter Rock came back out and played, then Raekwon finally got on.By the time Rakim came out, I was so annoyed at having been there for so long and tired, we left about four songs in.  Rae and Rakim are dope, but the venue and organization really sucked the life out of the show, can't think of a worse time I've had listening to artists I really like.  I would only go back to stage 48 if Tupac and Biggie were playing together.",,,
198,J D.,"New York, NY",1,25,0,1.0,2/25/2013,"Went here to see some live music.  Normally I would probably never go here.  Overall a nice place, but even if this was the place for me, I would never go back becuase of this.  I ordered a beer and gave my credit card as payment.  Bartender gave me the beer and check.  It came to $9.60, which I found an odd amount.  When I asked how much the beer was she told be ""$8.00"", I asked what is the 1.60, she says ""tax and gratuity"".  Now even before I asked I got a look at the screen where they put the drink orders in and the $1.60 was an ""auto gratuity"".  They are adding this at will to the credit card bill, most people like me to not really review this, but again $9.60 for the beer made me look.  They are not doing this on cash payments.  Nice scam you have going there.",,,
199,Ruben D.,"Elmhurst, NY",0,1,0,1.0,2/17/2013,"So, the good thing: they had dubstep/trap/moombahtonBut:1. Sound system isn't highest quality, which you can hear when they turn it up (something they are not keen to do)2. The music was off for half an hour or so due to technical problems (superbowl all over again)3. We were surrounded by 16 year olds and there weren't too many people inside anyway (but maybe that's because the US is lagging behind when it comes to the appreciation of decent beats)4. We got thrown out at 1 AM without earlier notice, which sorta sucks if you pay 25$ to have a good night, and is worsened if you find out there's gonna be another party after that (good way to bring in money, a shitty way to treat customers)",,,
