0,Ennei S.,"Queens, NY",5,76,218,3.0,10/1/2018,I only come here for lunch. Prices are very affordable for lunch... starting at $9+. I haven't tried all options just because if I know one is great let's stick to that so I don't ruin my lunch. Service is a hit or miss here. 1st time was great and on point. 2nd time was horrible beyond horrible. 3 and 4th time was good nothing amazing. Feels more of a night pub with how dim it is and the atmosphere. I had stopped by one night and it was packed on a weekday. Great for after work drinks,,,
1,Peri L.,"Brooklyn, NY",95,18,0,1.0,11/7/2018,"Am writing this for a wonderful friend who is disabled. She said she's too used to, and weary of, this kind of treatment to care anymore.I have the good fortune of being able, so get to keep the luxury of being angry on my lovely pal's behalfSee, she was going to a celebratory dinner here. On the 3rd floor. But that floor's tables, etc, were not wheelchair-accessible. She had called in advance to ask about wheelchair access, and they'd said it WAS accessible.. but the insensitive hostess didn't bother to mention, that ONLY THE FIRST FLOOR, was accessible. Because, you know, #Ableist . Also #Numbskull.So the wheelchair transport dropped her off.. and was scheduled for TWO HOURS LATER. And they have a very tight, have to book in advance, schedule. So stranded.Because the hostess didn't bother to check. Because, #OtherPeoplesProblems.My friend has gotten used to being treated like a cross between a leper and an annoying stray, because, disabled, because, wheelchair.But I think she's pretty awesome, and that this restaurant should be avoided by anyone who cares about.. well, not enabling callous able-ism, in places that are, ostensibly there, to serve the public.So: Tonic. Maybe go somewhere else, until they treat our disabled loved ones, with thoughtfulness, courtesy.. and, oh.. ACCESS.And? Hire a hostess who can think about something other than her iPhone. Just a thought.People.Sheesh.dropped off here",1,,

5,Rhea Z.,"Staten Island, NY",107,215,242,4.0,9/18/2018,This review is for the two times I've been here. The first time: Just decided to pop in with friends on a Sunday after we had brunch and were all pretty ready to continue drinking. We sat at the rooftop which I thought was great. Enough space and tables for everyone. Drinks are your city prices which comes with the view and location. DJ was hitting all the right music feels in my opinion. Just an overall good time. The second time: It was girls night out for a Sat night. It was around 11pm and it wasn't super crowded. Still enough space to grab a drink at the bar and of course walk around without pushing anyone.  We again sat at the rooftop and DJ was doing it well that night. If you wanna just chill and have a good night with friends this is where it's at.,,,
6,Jackie L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,31,59,4.0,10/24/2018,"Wish i wrote this review earlier in the season! Rooftop Sunday football on a beautiful day is just Sunday funday at the max. Food is standard bar food -- cheese fries, wings, burgers, wraps. However, really delicious. Depending on what time of day and what day of the week, the bar could be totally packed. But with its 3 floors, you'll likely find space. Unfortunately, Sunday's don't come with meal or beer deals which is a bummer but it's def worth the try!",,,

I replied, ""ok, but we can't be charged for higher prices from what the menu shows"" to which she just replies ""sooo...what do you want me to do about it??""-- ""apparently nothing, may I speak with your manager.""Manager apologized and attempted to correct the bill, but he only adjusted the bill for one of the overcharged items - to which I again had to go to the server station to have him correct the second overcharged item. (2) Cesar Salads = $10 + $3 to add chicken (Menu Prices); we were charged $15 for each on the bill. That's an additional $2 charge than prices in the menu.First attempt to correct the bill only credited back $2 which only corrects one of the salads; second attempt included the correct $4 credit that includes both items.Terrible service, bad staff, and falsely advertised prices apparently happen from time to time - be prepared to check your bill!",4,,1
9,Kay F.,"Harrisburg, NC",0,46,109,3.0,8/22/2018,I was in town for the weekend and a friend suggested we meet here for happy hour this past Friday.  While looking at the menu for appetizers there were at least five items crossed off.  Time to get some new menus printed. The calamari was ok.  We also tried the bang bang shrimp.  Too much batter on them! We had only eaten two (one apiece) when we told the waitress but she didn't even offer to take it back and replace it with anything else.  I didn't even want to bother with asking for a Manager so I took the batter off and just ate the shrimp.  My friend ordered something else.  I guess it was too hot so the frozen margarita machines weren't keeping things frozen.  So after waiting an hour I decided to try the the spicy amigos cocktail.  It was the highlight of my experience.,,,
10,Shoshana R.,"Bronx, NY",181,272,1423,3.0,11/27/2017,"Night in the City... Good spot to pop in for just a drink or to stay and dance your night away. Whatever your mood is this spot can accommodate.I've been here before years ago, still a good place to go for good music, diverse crowd and multiple levels of city life to explore. They can get crowded but on this particular night (11/4) it was just the right amount of people to have room to roam. Didn't order any food but the menu is available if you need a bite to pair with your drinks. This is a NYC spot so be prepared for the accompanying prices, (as New Yorkers we are immune) 4 drinks & corona total $75 (tip included). When you are enjoying the atmosphere and the company you don't focus on the price tag. Drinks were made well and with out a wait, our bartender was New & still learning the lay of the land, but was good to us.",2,1,1

12,Shelby E.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",593,3,0,1.0,11/17/2018,"I'm sure that the actual bar / restaurant isn't that bad, but our waitress is the reason I will never be returning. Her name was Carmela and she couldn't have been ruder. She carded all of us when we ordered drinks and then gave us an attitude as if we weren't 21?? She took TWENTY MINUTES just to get us 5 beers when we were legitimately the only people there around 4 pm. She was chatting with another employee in front of us and whenever we tried to call her over she would just put her hand up at us as if she would come over which she never did. I used to be a waitress so I have never in my life left a zero dollar tip but it was by far the worst service I've ever received. I've never had a waitress be so blatantly rude.",,,

14,Raquel U.,"New York, NY",0,2,1,1.0,7/17/2018,"I went here with a few work friends to try and enjoy the Quarter Finals of the World Cup. So many things went wrong, I don't even know where to begin. We made a reservation for about 12 of us, a table was not ready when we arrived so we asked if we could sit upstairs. My group and I offered to help adjust the tables, that took a solid 15 minutes for the frazzled staff to figure it out. Then, once we got settled, our server took drink orders. After waiting the entire first half of the game, we were told a majority of the beers ordered were not available upstairs. A few friends went downstairs to get the beers they wanted. But also, it was the World Cup...you're really not going to stock up on your beers and be prepared for a busy afternoon? So the bartender wrote out a list of YES and NO (86) beers for the server to show us which beers we can choose from upstairs. Naturally, after finding out the half of our table went  to the other bar to get drinks they actually wanted, our table overheard our server talking shit about us to the bartender...hahaha yikes! I believe she was new, I mean she knew nothing about the menu so that's a safe and fair assumption. Also, she had the entire upstairs section with like five or six 2-tops and 1 party of 12 so I understand she was overwhelmed but...come on, don't put a new server in a section (by herself!)  during a massive game day! Or at least grab the bartender to help her out! The food was alright, but by then, I had a nasty taste in my mouth for this place. It's a shame that the staff was mediocre, because the set up is amazing for a sports bar. I won't be coming back here again.",2,1,

When I called to make the reservation, I asked if there will be brunch special, they confirmed saying yes. Obviously, when we arrived and were about to place the order, they said there's no bottomless special until after the game is over, and everybody would have to re-order entree to get the bottomless. What a bummer. Such a great place and good food, just wished they could have provided me accurate information prior to my booking, and be consistent!

Our drinks came in a normal time, but the appetizers took 45 minutes to come out with no sign from our waiter. So when our food came we had no drinks, not even water. We asked for another round, which then took 20 minutes & our food got cold. The entire dining process took over 2 hours. Food was actually so incredible so it's tough when the service sucks. It wasn't even that busy, there were plenty of open table tops. The service was a 1 star, but the vibe & music makes this 3 stars.Plus there was throw up in the bathroom that had DEFINITELY been sitting there for a while.

22,Maddie T.,"Hoboken, NJ",5,28,6,1.0,6/3/2018,"This review is for the nightlife only (9 pm and later). My friends have dragged me here several times and it has never been a good experience. They have this deal (you have to sign up and then get texted you've won the deal) where one person gets an open bar if they bring it at least three other people, and the three other people get drink deals.It sounds like a good idea but it is not. The entire bar fills up with people participating only in this deal. The result is that everyone is drunk, rude, and kinda shady. To be fair: my friends hate this place less than I do, and cite the good music when defending their point.",,1,
23,Michael D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",153,13,0,2.0,6/26/2018,"We came on a Tuesday night, the service was extremely slow.

Not to mention they took like 25 minutes to arrive.When we tried to cash out that took another 20 minutes just to get the bill. They should be much better staffed. Cool roof spot, but the service and price is not worth it. There's better options in midtown.",,,

26,Daneeque C.,"Chandler, AZ",287,2,1,2.0,8/20/2018,2 stars only for the roof top part of the bar. Service is awful. Waited half an hour for 2 drinks and waited another 45 for food that didn't even get rung in. There were only a total of 5 groups on the patio at the time so busyness wasn't an excuse.

More waiting. More waiting. Got back to us to say they could only accommodate our group at several separate tables or on their unenclosed unheated rooftop. It was 40 degrees. Obviously they lost our reservation and were trying to play it off. No thanks.

We had blue point lagers and the combo platter (wings, tenders, mozz sticks, calamari). It was all okay. Typical bar food but kind of subpar for nyc.

My waitress came to my table pretty quick, I asked her if my margarita was include in the happy hour and when I got the check it turns out it wasn't. I wasn't sure what to get so the waitress recommended the double cheese burger. I got the double cheese burger, it should have had tomatoes, pickles and cheese on it  and my friend got the taco salad. My cheese burger had no cheese and no tomatoes. I guess I must have had high expectations, I thought a double cheese burger meant you would get two patty's but it turns out it's two slider patties. My friends taco salad came out with no chicken, she had to wait 15mins for them to bring out a side of chicken for her to add to her meal. For being pretty empty, the food and drinks took pretty long to come out. I would probably come back for brunch to see how it is.",,,

48,Shelton H.,"Philadelphia, PA",4,7,3,4.0,2/27/2017,"So I had the privilege of eating brunch here with friends (more like drinking our brunch) this ast Sunday! When we first arrived we were immediately escorted to the top floor rooftop.  It was a pretty cool view however the service up there wasn't quite the best reason being there was about 40 ppl up there with only one server (that's managements fault). So, for this reason I decided that not getting any attention for 15min was the tipping point so I headed back to the bottom floor bar. This is were my entire day turned around for the better. I'm greeted by this cool semi hipster looking bartender who I passive aggressively complain to about the lack of service going on upstairs. He replies with ""well hey I'm Duke you're welcome to come down here, sit anywhere and I gotcha and, hey if you don't be a dick to me I won't be one to you!"" ...Well since we were there for the bottomless mimosas it was only natural that we sat at the bar. We all ordered the steak and eggs without thinking because we're here the the BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS! Duke kindly pours up a massive pitcher of mimosas thats more champagne than OJ.  He slides it in front of us and we immediately go to town on it. After about 15 min later the food comes out and LAWD LAWD LAWD the steak was so tender and flavorful. The eggs were fluffy and just right all while sitting on a bed of golden friend potatoes. As we continue to savory the food and get a little saucy off the BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS (yes it's important hence all caps) Duke slides us this shot called a ""blow job"" because he wanted to make amends for the slighted service from earlier. As the drinks start to flow and kick in (4 shots a piece) Duke never let us go thirsty nor un-entertained as he begins to tell us of all of the inappropriate adult things that go on at the back booth . All in all we will definitely drive up from Philly just to kick it with Duke the great food and BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS!!!",3,2,2

55,Tarneka M.,"New York, NY",14,77,0,3.0,8/17/2018,This is a review for 8-17-18. I went for birthday happy hour. At first there was a discrepancy and I was given a happy hour bracelet I spoke to another girl and she got me a free drink bracelet ( I should have got in the first place). The drinks were free for birthday people ( bonus moi) and guests got happy hour bracelets. It is a good deal from 9-1. We arrived after 10 and left after 2. It is a good night out from the hustle and bustle of the work week . The music was good drinks were flowing and decent crowd. Cheers to the weekend..,,,
56,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1049,242,4.0,1/17/2017,"Not once did I think I'd step into Tonic East, but one Saturday I did, and I think Tonic East does exactly what it is meant to do. It has several large, high resolution TV screens for you to watch your preferred game from. When we stepped in around 12:30 PM on Saturday, it was still fairly quiet, and the bartender asked us, ""Is the game you want to watch on here?"" i.e. they'll put on any game you want.They have a $30 boozy brunch, which I did not participate in, but would be a good deal if you can plow down at least 3 drinks in 2 hours. It fortunately didn't get too bro-y during my time there, but I was definitely reminded that I was at a sports bar when the bar had neither Chardonnay, Riesling, nor a Malbec. :( (Who orders wine at a sports bar anyway, much less a specific grape varietal, hurhur)",1,,

Started when we had our table abrutptly physically removed from us after we just ordered food , and was offered a table in the back dark corner inside after we had been waiting on a beautiful sunny day. Got worse after the manager came up to speak to us and offered us a round on the house and we were told by the arrogant and condesending (inappproritely flirting with each other the duration of the time) staff that we were too intoxicated for drinks (hadnt ordered any since our ordeal). If you can avoid this place you should. The staff is rude and unprofessional and there are many other places with more professionalism and better drinks than this.",,,

Our server Carmela was awful. She was glacial, had a terrible attitude, and took forever with everything. She was too busy texting and carrying conversations with her colleagues. She also failed to change the channel to the Pga Championship and kept the tv on an informercial for a medical device.  What a disappointment",,,

I had unknowingly stumbled into this place on cinco de mayo for a bit and thought nothing great of it other than the fact that there's three floors so it isn't TOO packed which is wonderful! Last night my friend and I wanted to do a little rooftop happy hour after work so we remembered this place and made sure they had some specials. $5 margaritas, $7 champagne cocktails! I got amazing quesadillas that weren't on the happy hour menu but they were only $13 and they were huge (AND came with guac that was really good). Another awesome plus is that the happy hour is until 10 PM which is waaay later than most other happy hours around the city. Got a great view of the Empire State Building while relaxing and enjoying my drinks and food. It wound up getting really packed around 7 PM so you may not get as great of a spot around that time. Deducted a star because the service was just ehhh and not really friendly. Will definitely return!",,,
61,Asher W.,"New York, NY",276,209,583,1.0,11/19/2016,"Absolutely worst experience of my life on a Saturday afternoon. We came to tonic to sit on the roof, watch the indiana v michigan game, and drink. First we sat down and waited probably 15 min at least for a waitress to come around. In that time at least 6 other tables were also waiting to get service.Then we asked for drinks and she brought them a few min later. During that time they also served someone at another table the wrong good. And then for another order they couldn't find the people who's order it was so the servers just walked around yelling out the dishes. Are you serious? You just walk around yelling steak skillet till someone answers? Thats absurd. Eventually everyone just started ordering from the bar cuz the waitresses were nowhere to be seen. Then we asked how much the beers were and the lady told us coronas were $8 and cans of stella were $10 but she said she would double check. So we walked up to the bar and asked the bartender and he said everything was $7. Needless to say i left no tip (something i haven't done in probably 5 years) and walked the hell out. Never going back to tonic. Place sucks even when its empty. Waitresses (tall brunette worked the roof at 2:00 on sat nov 19) doesn't even know what their prices are. Makes new patrons wait 20 min to get served. And let's her servers run around yelling out orders to the entire restaurant like its a livestock auction. Inexcusable.",3,,1
62,Louise R.,"New York, NY",245,288,1386,3.0,11/9/2016,"Left the hill for this place to watch the election.  Carol was my server and she was pretty much making runs for the entire floor. She followed up consistently and made sure we were happy with our selections. I returned the calamari because they were generic, probably frozen and just cheap looking. The sweet Sriracha chicken tenders were not very good either. The chicken wasn't marinated, it tasted a bit under done and was smothered in a creamy sauce that was pretty bland. I replaced the calamari with a steak quesadilla.  It was actually really great minus the large chunks of steak that weren't edible because of chewy lumps of fat. 5 stars for Carol,  2 stars for food, 3 stars for ambience and crowd. I wouldn't come back here on purpose.",2,,

64,Julia G.,"New Orleans, LA",0,5,0,3.0,7/22/2018,"I would give this place a solid three stars. We made a reservation for the bottomless brunch on Sunday. We arrived less than 15 minutes late (14 minutes after our reservation time to be exact) and were disappointed to learn that our table had been given away already. I think that restaurants should wait at least a full 15 minutes before doing this, but I will give Tonic East the benefit of the doubt because it was the day of a World Cup game and the place was incredibly busy. We had to wait about 15 more minutes until another table was open. We ended up getting stuck sitting in the back of the rooftop, which didn't have the best view or ambience. We were also disappointed to learn that they were out of bloody marys and could only offer us margaritas or mimosas for our bottomless drink selection. I was definitely looking forward to endless bloody marys and wasn't enthused at having to make a different drink selection. However, our waitress was friendly and did a great job of keeping the drinks coming and making sure they were strong. The food was average - edible, but definitely nothing to write home about. I was unimpressed with my eggs benedict and plain, unseasoned breakfast potatoes. I didn't come in with high expectations for my meal, considering that the allure of this place is the rooftop and bottomless special, not the food. After finishing our meal we decided to get one last drink from the bar before leaving. I ordered the frozen margarita drink and it was delicious - I would definitely recommend getting this. All in all, this Tonic East is a good place to have a casual boozy brunch with friends. Bonus points if you're into sports, because there are multiple TVs covering the walls broadcasting whatever game is on that day. Just don't come in expecting much from the food, because it was adequate at best.",,,

Their marketing and communication for their ""free open bar"" more like false advertisement was confusing. Half of their bartending staff were busy taking pictures and goofing around. One of the bartenders actually had to tell the other bartender to stop standing around and do his job. When a situation happened one of the bartenders came up behind me while I was with my guests and started berating me. Instead of being a civil human being and taking me off to the side he decided to yell so that half the bar could hear. I did not retaliate and was very calm even though he decided to physically point and audibly ""chastise"" me. The manager that was beside him did nothing to rectify the situation even though he believed the bartender handled the situation was wrong.

It was to the point where I could not go downstairs to use the bathroom because the stairways were COMPLETELY stuffed with people. If you made your way down, they wouldn't let you back up, either. Talk about a fire hazard.They also needed more wait staff. Our waitress took forever to bring over drinks/shots, etc. She was probably juggling half the rooftop (which was 100% at or over capacity).When they cleared the stairwell, I went into the bathroom. It was awful. Broken glass covered the floors, garbage everywhere. It was just ridiculous. I understand this is a popular place and everyone wants to enjoy the game here, but the way things were kept and handled were not even close to being acceptable. After the game, most people cleared out and it felt like a normal bar again.I would consider coming back for a game, but I really hope they get their shit together.",2,,

Nicole was a sweetheart and checked in frequently. The highlight for me was definitely my Eggs Benedict (sans bacon). Even with the Hollandaise spread, the English muffin still had a crisp and the home fried potatoes were so warm on the inside. There were a handful of little oopsies (missing silverware, forgetting water, chewy/fatty steak, chilly), but nothing that would keep me from not returning again.

You could get beers for $5 but that would be a bud light or corona (cue in the snob IPA glare....). After 8pm, you cannot go to the roof with draft beer which is down right odd. I tried ordering an IPA on the roof and they said they only served heineken, bud light and corona bottles??? I went with a moscow mule for $13 and then headed out.

I have never experienced such a terrible customer service until last night when my boyfriend and I came to East Tonic for a late dinner. As we sat down, we were not greeted by the bartender who's name was JONATHAN. Not only that the area we seated at was dirty, but we had to wait until my boyfriend asked if we could get a menu because he was paying us no mind at all.  Finally, about 10 minutes of wating, he finally handed us the menu and we ordered. He asked us if we wanted to open a tab or to close it out, but we were a bit confused since we told him that we were just gonna have dinner and No drinks. Then he left and came back with our total and asked for a credit card. My boyfriend then asked if we could have the bill/receipt first (as every other restaurant would do), and Jonathan replied with...""and why would I lie?!"" So my boyfriend said...""it's not that, we just want to see a receipt before charging us"". Then Jonathan replied with, ""c'mon man, don't be hood!"" I was shocked that he even said that!!! Not only that was rude but extremely inappropriate!!!! It was a reasonable request of wanting to have the bill prior to us paying. Mind you we haven't even got our food yet and he was already so eager of getting us out of there!!! If there was someone being ""hood"" it was JONATHAN because he doesn't know how to treat his customers!! Then when he finally handed us the bill with my credit card, he was very condensing trying to explain our bill...which in reality wasn't the reason why we we asked for it in the first place!!! I just can't fathom why Jonathan would treat us with so much disrespect since we have been nothing but patient the whole entire time. I'm writing this review because I want this establishment to know the kind of treatment that we experienced here. I understand that places get busy or bartenders/servers could have a day but there's no excuse in this kind of behavior!!!!

I went for a song request, and instead of saying no I don't take them, he proceeded to tell me to ""to get the fuck out of his face"" and threatened to fight my fiance after my fiance asked him not to speak in that way. I understand not all DJs take requests but there are better ways to tell paying customers this. We spent a lot of money and don't deserve to be spoken to like that or threatened. Also, being that alcohol is involved threatening and cursing the wrong person could create altercation.

Updated review",Below is my review from my night at tonic east. I was told I would receive a check for my dinner because of the situation and also from the employee adding on her own tip. That was July 16th and I have yet to receive any money back from my horrible night at tonic east! I will continue to peruse this matter!! Recently went to tonic east to celebrate my 30th birthday. They had a private event on the rooftop and everyone was way too drunk and it was way too crowded. Could not enjoy eating my dinner. We eventually removed ourselves from the table leaving back lots of food. Then the waitress decided to add her own tip after we leave since the tip part was left open on the receipt. I will never go to tonic east. Too many crazy drunks all over the place doing too much.,1,1,

The rooftop is cool and makes up for his shitty attitude but anyways, he is the shorter, portly, bearded guy. I asked him for two shots of tequila and as I was saying two shots he interrupted me and said "" two shots?! Two shots of fucking what?! Water?! Okay! Fucking water it is!!"" I yelled out ""tequila! Two shots of tequila!"" And he yelled ""what!?"" And "" I  yelled 2 shots of fucking tequila! Patron to be exact!"" Instead he poured me some random silver tequila I think it was Jose Cuervo and proceeded to help somebody else with that same attitude. Didn't even salt the plastic shot cups or provide some limes. To make matters worse, this place gets soo damn raunchy near the back on the middle floor. The rooftop really just is the only place to be. Bartenders up there were cool.

Updated review","We came here for a bottomless brunch and what started as a great day slowly started to fade into one of the worst experiences I have ever had. The waiter I had was named Julio. Once we sat down I asked him for a coffee and he told me he would bring it to me. Once he returned and asked how we were doing I told him I still haven't received my coffee. He apologized and told me he would get it right away. This continued five more times and to keep the rest of the story short I left the restaurant without a sip of coffee. That alone caused me to write this review, but unfortunately that was not the only issue with our service. Once we received our food and started eating there was no silverware or napkins on the table; even though we made a reservation. Furthermore we made a reservation for 12 but only 10 people ended up at the event and they still charged us for 12. Normally I would pay without question but the fact of the matter was that we were promised three tables and only ended up using two. This means that they sold out the other table but still charged us for all three. The only reason I am rating this two stars and not one is because of the bottomless alcohol for two hours. W",,,

Service was really impressive -- for drinks it went well beyond just getting something as usual from an open bar. The food was not fancy in the least -- some typical bar menu items on serving plates that came out on tables. Nothing passed around. Nice to be able to hover if you were hungry while the vultures made quick time of things.Overall a great experience.

As others have mentioned, they let way too many people in. It was beyond overcrowded. Staff had trouble serving with so many people to cater to--it lead to terrible and rude service.I went to grab my first drink and noticed the bar tender was filling up a giant beer dispenser for a table. Since he was just holding it up to the tap for several minutes, I figured it would be easy for him to grab a Bud Light bottle and serve it up while he was filling--I could pay cash. I said, ""Hey, when you get a chance, could you please get me a BL bottle?""He replied, ""Can't you see I'm busy? Filling up this thing takes ten minutes!""Me: ""Okay man. No problem.""Him: ""I'll get to you when I get to you! You gotta be patient!""Me: ""Okay.""Him: (to the guy to my right) ""Hey, what do you want?"" He serves him several shots and then another patron. I wait patiently.Him: That will be seven dollars. No, eight dollars.I hand him the cash, he gives me change. I always tip 20% or more at bars but after that fiasco, there was no way that he was getting or deserved a tip. I don't even believe a Bud Light  costs $8...

They have a huge menu full of actually reasonably priced dishes! On top of some awesome happy hour deals. I sat on the first floor but there's also a rooftop, tons of TV's, and a huge bar.

I came across their menu and thought I'd give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here for brunch. With a group of 8, we arrived around 230. We did not have to wait for a table and were able to sit on the heated rooftop. Our waitress was great! Super helpful and attentive. She made sure our glasses were full at all times.Like most places that do boozy brunch you can expect the crowd to be intoxicated. Especially later on in the afternoon. Since we expected that it didn't ruin our experience at all. It was a fun afternoon and should be on everyones brunch list.",1,,

Spoke to management downstairs who said the rooftop TVs can play any game we want. Went up to the rooftop 45 minutes before the game and requested the tv closest to us to play our game. They didn't make any moves to change it even though multiple waitresses assured us they were working on it. Then 5 minutes before the game, they came back and refused to change the tv to the game requested. Had they been nice about it, we might have stayed and moved spots, but someone literally said ""Go back home if you want to watch your game."" Never have I been treated so rudely and never have I met such unwelcoming people in this city. Bottomless was not worth it, food was not even good, and they clearly were skimping on the champagne in the mimosas. They still charged us for food and mimosas even though we left 45 minutes into a 2 hour bottomless. Do NOT come here to spend $30 and be treated with such disrespect. I have never had such a bad experience.",4,,

It was perfect weather to stay in, drink beers (I was sick so I couldn't), eat tasty food (I did that), and enjoy my Seahawks fans. The atmosphere was nice, the people were cool, and a lot of people were there for the game. I saw platters coming with wings, nachos, large salads. I wasn't too hungry so our group shared truffle tater tots which are tasty and some edaname. We had shots, drinks, and much more going on with out chants, loudness, 12MAN yells and screams. It was a great time with my people. If you are in the area, want to watch the game, or just have a great time come here. FYI: I was talking to some people in NJ last night and they said they LOVE this place to, so I felt like I picked a great place to watch the game. We will be back....

The mimosas were nice and strong!!! Unlike some places, where you can barely taste the champagne, at tonic you get your money's worth!

He was very knowledgeable about cocktails and made me one of his specialty drinks.. He was with a female bartender her name was Melissa and she was good too... Ordered mozzarella sticks and they went well with my cocktail. I spent most of time talking to Duke and to be honest he probably one of the funniest down to earth bartenders I have met and his service was on point..

She tells me I can't pay cash because my card was already swiped, whaaaat? She then say oh btw there's an 18% gratuity. An 18% gratuity for a tab at the bar? Really??

Not hard to find a spot to chill at on any floor. The music is pretty much always good and you can watch the video to it most of the time. Bathrooms are on the second floor and the ""basement"" floor. The ""basement"" floor bathroom is the way to go since the second floor bathroom is only one person at a time. The service on the rooftop is what makes this place eh sometimes. You can be blessed with a waitress that is attentive enough or not at all. It sometimes gets to the point where you have to actually go and find them. Ordered two drinks and it took about 20 minutes for them to come to the table but they were ready in 5 min. We saw them sitting at the bar. The waiters all hang out in the back room which is why you don't see them walking around. Uhm hello? But if you can overlook that aspect of it then you'll be fine. Stick to ordering your drinks at the bar and just standing around before getting a high top table. Oh ! Chips and Guac are pretty good here! The non spicy one, mild!",2,,

Updated review","After that whole altercation I described below. The REAL manager emailed me and informed me that a bartender took it upon himself to ""act"" as if he was the manager.

The vibe is always positive and the drinks are always strong. The bar food is like any other bar food. When I've been here on Saturday nights this place gets PACKEDto the point where you can't even maneuver sometimes, BUTTT it is great if you want to be surrouded by a fun vibe and want somewhere to drink and dance.  So if you're looking for a quiet low-key kind of spot, this probably isn't the place for you especially on the weekends.",,,

It would be totally acceptable to get wasted and do a ""coyote ugly"" dance in this bar. Most of customers are in their 20's (overwhelming majority are in their early 20's). I agree with everyone else - the inside of the bar is borderline toxic.... Food is nasty & over priced for the quality and quantity you get. Drinks are cheap and taste cheap. But if that's what you're looking for, this is the place to go. If you're a college student and just trying to get drunk on a budget and act wild, I would recommend this place. I've seen fist fights inside and outside of this bar. And waaaay too much PDA! All in all, don't come here for ambiance or with the intention of spending a substantial amount of money (because it's not worth it).

144,Jason R.,"Brooklyn, NY",374,425,1488,3.0,10/13/2014,"I came to Tonic yesterday to enjoy Week 6 of Football. I decided to go with Tonic East after looking at various bars in the area and overall I am happy with my decision.Service: The server I had, wish I gotten her name since I was there all day long, but I did not. She had a Revis jersey on and we busted her chops a bit, as I am a Giants fan. Nonetheless, she was excellent, she was extremely attentive despite the fact that she seemed to be catering to the whole rooftop by herself. Always asked if we needed anything and was eager to please. 5 starsFood: Here is where everything is a bit sketchy and why I only gave it a three rating. I understand it ""bar food"" so I did not go with huge expectations, but I would describe the food as just edible. As stated earlier, my buddies and I were there all day (12:45 to 8:15) so we indulged in a couple items on the menu over the course of the day.I had the Margherita Pizza ($10) it was edible, but the not the greatest and a bit small) my buddy went with the Crab Cakes (he said they were the worst he ever had) my other buddy went with the Mac n Cheese had to return it because he does not eat pork and it contained bacon. They informed him if he wanted the Mac without bacon, he would have to get Mac with Goat cheese instead of Cheddar.....that made no sense at all. Later on, I decided to have some French Fries and those were not so great either, but my buddy did go for the Cheese Fries which looked great. Not only was the food not so good, but they also take awhile to prepare, the server would constantly check the kitchen and come back and apologize about how long they were taking. 2 starsAmbiance: The set-up of Tonic is great, they have a bar downstairs with seating along with multiple TV's. They have a middle tier with the same amenties, and finally the Rooftop is on the third level. We opted for the rooftop since it was a nice Fall day. The crowd was decent and was not the obnoxious and loud crowd I have experienced elsewhere. I sat directly under the heater, word to the wise, it is not the best seat because it gets rather chilly up there, but when you put the heat on it becomes unbearingly warm. I spent the whole day putting the heat on and off. 4 starsOverall, I think this place is excellent place to watch Football, but fulfill your appetite elsewhere.",3,2,1

Atmosphere is also pretty great, enjoyed the music & mixed crowd. Big place also, with their 3 floors & roof top deck. However at about $13/ $14 a drink, which for the area (and for me in general) is essentially ""cheap"", considering how weak & watered down they are, they're way over priced. I got not even the slightest taste of Jameson in my Green Tea. In other words I definitely did not get what I paid for in that respect.

The other bartender pointed out that my friend left 2$ tip on the bar and it wasn't enough because he just bought a round of drinks for us after losing my card, meanwhile we were trying to get change so we could leave him more. We ended up taking our tip back. What person in the customer service industry complains and says ""that's it?, I just bought your round of drinks"" to a tip! No matter what it was. If anything you should explain why you have such a bad attitude and ask why you were tipped so little, and if there's anything to do to make it better. I didn't receive an apology.

Can't really get any better than that...Good drinks and plenty a maneuver space made a cool night out at Tonic.

Were told we were able to have brunch on the roof. Sat on the roof for another 5 minutes and was then were told that the servers and bartenders were late and that we would have to be served downstairs. We were ok with because my group and I were hungry and just wanted brunch. After another 5-10 of sitting downstairs and having a bartender just set tables around us and never greet us, we finally just up and left. The manager sat at the bar the entire time this went down and never made an attempt to greet us or help his staff. I have never been more upset at bad wait staff and ineptitude in my entire dining experience. I will never be going back and do not recommend this restaurant to any person.

Took forever to get drinks and then when we tried to pay for them, the bartender ignored our requests to pay cash for our individual drinks and put everything on one person's tab and asked like it was our fault when we pointed our her error. On top of that, drinks were mixed pretty badly.",2,1,1

The food was great, I had a steak fajita which I very much enjoyed. I also liked the drink offers, I had mimosas and margaritas, both were full sized and strong, so definitely your money's worth.

After we placed our order, the waitress comes back and informs us that after the football game, the second floor closes... It would've been nice to know that before we ordered food so we could move to the first floor.

162,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,528,28,3.0,9/8/2014,"5 stars for the rooftop deck and the (relatively) chill Sunday afternoon atmosphere. 2 stars for the food.Bf and I came here to watch NFL week 1 on a gorgeous day. We arrived around halfway through the second quarter of the 1:00 games, and although all of the seats were taken, it wasn't totally packed. We creeped around a bit until we found some seats that worked well for both of us as we both follow different teams. It also cleared out somewhat at halftime, so it's definitely not impossible to find a seat here even during the busiest part of the day. Aside from some really annoying bros doing really annoying drunken bro things, the crowd was pretty cool. And there's nothing like taking in the game on a sun-soaked rooftop in NYC.But the food is just awful. We ordered the honey barbecue wings, which came with bleu cheese dressing. Both the honey bbq and bleu cheese sauces tasted like nothing. Seriously, there was almost no flavor to any of it. I don't even know how that's possible. The dish was also served with the standard carrots and celery, which also incredibly were completely flavorless and dry. Consider yourself warned.Drinks were fine-- I had a Bloody Mary, which was super spicy  (a little too spicy for my taste, to the point of burning my throat) and a Blue Moon. The beer selection on the rooftop is nothing special. When I ordered a draft that I knew was available on the second floor, the waitress told me she couldn't get it for me. Maybe she really couldn't - I don't know. But it would've been nice if I could've had it.Issues aside, I'll come to Tonic again. It's a Penn State bar on Saturdays (my alma mater), so I'll definitely be back to hang out with my fellow Nittany Lions no matter how much the food sucks.",1,,
163,Sunny S.,"Philadelphia, PA",136,380,145,3.0,9/3/2014,"I've been to Tonic many times in the past and now that I live around the corner, I'll probably be coming here more.It's your average bar, and definitely a Murray Hill bro bar.  On the weekends, it can get pretty rowdy, with the first and second floor playing top 40/hip hop and a large dance floor on the 2nd floor.  All three floors offer you a slightly different vibe and it is a good place to stop by for a drink.What I really like about Tonic is the roof and how it's such a different vibe than the other two floors of the bar.  The roof is very chill, has a decent view of the Empire State and Chrysler Building, and you can see a TV from almost anywhere you're sitting.  They even serve hookah up there, but I would suggest not getting it as it's pretty expensive, doesn't last too long, and they charge you for coal.  It's a separate company that provides the hookah, not Tonic, so that could be why.The roof only has a few bottled beers, so if you're looking for anything on draft or any sort of microbrew, you won't find it up there.  The food at tonic is what it is...bar food.  Personally, I'm not really a fan of their food (I've only eaten here twice), but I don't come here for the food anyway.",1,,

But we thought we could just shift some stuff over and we could share the table. These girls asks us if we can move our bags and obviously we said no considering we said we were already using it and that we could share. This girl goes to another waiter (not even our waiter) and he comes over and tells us that we have to move our stuff. We tried explaining to the guy that we were using it but that we had no problem sharing. He told us that there's no sharing, you're either using the table or not. He also said since the girls ordered we have to move our stuff to the floor. We tried to explain again but he said he understands but this is the circumstance now. So we had to move our stuff to the floor. Then these girls got complimentary drinks and the waiter was giving us these looks.

With the rooftop, you get a great view of the Empire State Building. The food here is good; not fantastic but nothing to complain about. My big gripe with this place is due to the fact that they serve you a very small cup of ketchup for your burger and/or fries, but if you ask for extra they will charge you an extra $0.50 per cup. What's worse is they don't even inform you of the additional cost, it'll just sneak its way onto your bill. That's a little ridiculous to me. I'll still come back though because I love the vibe.
