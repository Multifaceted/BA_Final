0,Jordan B.,"New York, NY",312,154,455,4.0,9/7/2018,"I know everyone shits on PHD/the Dream because I normally do too, but came to this location for drinks after work on a weekday and had a surprisingly pleasant time. All in all, it's pricey, but not shocking for the area, and the food & drink were tasty!Met my friend here around 5:30pm on a beautiful weekday evening. From the get-go, it wasn't that crowded, just your usual workday crowd. You enter the dream hotel and take an elevator to the top floor, called PhD. After sitting in our spots, which were not marked, for about an hour, a hostess let us know that they were reserved and we'd have to get up now, which was odd. The space is pretty massive, with multiple terraces, so we moved and found another great spot. Because it's still summer out, we decided to sip on Aperol Spritzes, which were delicious. They even came with some fun colored straws. After a while, we decided to get some food: truffle fries, burger sliders, and mac n' cheese balls. On the smaller side, but great bar food for a rooftop chill.The servers and bartenders were unusually polite for these types of spots. They were prompt and kind, which was the cherry on top of everything else. Toward the end of our night (7:30/8pm), the space got a lot more crowded, so get there early if you want a spot to sit. All in all, not too bad, PhD! I might even be inclined to come here again... when the bank account is feeling okay.",,,
1,Biru S.,"Mamaroneck, NY",321,658,142,2.0,11/3/2018,"I think the two star rating for this venue is well deserved. I was here with a group of people on Halloween. We purchased a table package because the lines here are absolutely insane.  We got seated on the higher level of the venue. The views were awesome, there was a balcony if you needed some air or wanted to smoke. However...... this was a party! Where is the music?!? They had a ""DJ"" who literally put everyone to sleep. By the time it was 1AM, the second floor was completely empty. We rushed through our bottle so we could make our way downstairs where the music was a bit better.  This DJ was doing a better job but it still wasn't quite there. The area is pretty small, drinks are as you'd expect for the Dream Hotel but overall... it was a lousy experience.The PhD in the meat packing district is much better.",2,,1
2,Mel S.,"Hoboken, NJ",0,12,0,1.0,8/6/2018,"Receptionist at the door was a vindictive biatch. I specifically requested that she not tie the plastic bracelet so tight but she did exactly the opposite & then refused to give me the scissors to take it off. Next she proceeded to give me major assitude & tried to get the Bouncer to not let me up to the private party for a club that I happen to be a member. what a bunch of semi-literate losers ... Bouncer was just as much of a dick on the way in & out. I'm guessing he only let me up cuz he knew I'd come after these lousy bastards [doesn't hurt to have the resources to do that]. Upstairs they gave me the tuna with ""dairy"" even after being specifically informed of a lactose allergy. Mr Chatwal - you could really do better than keeping such nasty, incompetent, morons on your payroll. We've met socially & I happen to know your family through boarding school. Word gets around. But judging by the paucity of stars & the horrendous ratings doesn't sound like you have much of a reputation to preserve. Peace out.",2,2,
3,Robert C.,"New York, NY",362,23,15,5.0,10/28/2018,Great spot for a hot date or for great cocktails and delicious bites.  Right near Times Square with a great view of it from high up.  Came here on a Sunday and the ambience was nice and relaxed but the manager did say on the weekends it csn get packed in the club.  Staff was friendly and quick.  Oversll a great experience will definitely come back.,,,
4,Anisha R.,"Manhattan, NY",141,249,950,4.0,5/20/2018,"I finally got a chance to spend an evening at the rooftop even though I have been living right across since almost an year. I wish I had seen this place before. The evening here I spent was so peaceful, not super crowded, good drinks.! I am sure it gets super crowded during nights on weekends cause I have seen people waiting in line even in winters. I especially loved the cocktail collection. I had a tequila based cocktail with fresh strawberry! Absolutely loved it. So wonderfully made, not too sweet and string; just the way I like it. I didn't order any food, but all the dishes did looked quite tempting, especially the fries and the mini burgers. I will surely be back for chill weekend evening to try more drinks and food.",1,,
5,Katharine S.,"Arlington, VA",352,588,461,1.0,7/22/2018,I was not impressed with this place at all. Super crowded and messy. Drinks are spilled all over the place. All girls and a few creepy guys sprinkled in. I would not come back.  One star for the music. The music was good.,2,1,
6,Danielle B.,"Brooklyn, NY",177,22,35,2.0,10/23/2018,"I went here for a friends birthday. I didn't pay a cover charge and we got free drinks inside. There were a variety of people and it was pretty packed but that didn't bother me too much. Some of the workers in there were a bit rude. The DJ was pretty good which made the night more enjoyable. Overall, it was an ok experience but not really my type of crowd.I must say, the view from the rooftop was awesome!",,,
7,Jessica G.,"Larchmont, NY",70,127,367,5.0,7/10/2018,"Wow wow wow. Made a reservation here for a work event for 6:30 on a Tuesday, and it couldn't have been better. First of all, you know we went for drinks but the highlight was the food. Tuna poke chips were the best tuna appetizer I've ever had. Truffle fries were outstanding. The crab dish with kettle chips was mouthwatering and we couldn't get enough of the chicken and biscuit sliders. The shrimp cocktail was also pretty dynamite. We ordered one of everything as we could with our $1,800 minimum for 10-15 people, which really isn't horrible for NY. The cucumber smash was divine and the white sangria wasn't bad. The cucumber smash was perfect for a summer happy hour. We also had the giant Moscow mule which was fun and tasted yummy. Would recommend this rooftop for any private summer party. Our waitress was also incredibly friendly and took great care of us!",1,,
8,Gabe S.,"Tampa, FL",41,157,95,5.0,8/20/2018,Nice rooftop bar in midtown.  View is pretty nice but just a couple of floors up.  Sitting area is superb with a plethora of different sitting areas.  Bartenders/waitress are fast and friendly.  Drinks had perfect amount of alcohol.  Visited during the week in the evening.,2,,
9,C L.,"Los Angeles, CA",281,63,4,2.0,10/26/2018,Super basic. Stayed  at The Dream for a work trip. Wanted to have a chill drink. Made the mistake of going to the upstairs bar which is super clubby. I like clubs but I'm more into cool deep house vibes vs top 40 hip hop. $20 for a Jameson on the rocks! Ricky's downstairs at the lobby level of The Dream is way more quality. For the same price was able to get a fine scotch n much nicer vibes.,,,
10,Kristin Q.,"Middleburg, VA",0,3,0,5.0,10/29/2018,"So, this review is less about PHD Terrace and Fishbowl and more about the extraordinary employee they have, Robert Corroza. Although PHD is gorgeous, and Fishbowl has all of the makings of a crazy fun night we were having a less than stellar experience and were about to head out to see what else NYC had to offer when Robbie happened to hear that we were disappointed in the evening. He responded with such sincere concern and immediately demonstrated the kind of urgency and effectiveness that not only keeps people from leaving but makes them want to come back EVERY SINGLE CHANCE THEY GET. The staff there clearly respects and responds to him and once he addressed the issues we were having with them (which btw he did discreetly and respectfully which as a former manager myself I very much appreciated), each one fell in line and took outstanding care of us. We stayed for every last minute on Friday night enjoying both PHD and Fishbowl and came right back to both on Saturday for an equally awesome time, adding the Rickey into the mix too!I hope that the folks at PHD Terrace, Fishbowl, the Rickey and the Tao Group understand what an asset he is and how truly lucky they are to have someone who not only truly listens to complaints but understands what it takes to resolve them and turn a customer 100% around into a lifer. We will continue to trust this place as long as he's around and if he ever leaves, I'm going to follow to whatever place he goes as I know the service will be there. Thank you Robbie for saving my best friends birthday weekend!",,,
11,Rafael N.,"New York, NY",33,39,52,3.0,9/2/2018,"This place has a beautiful view and nice drinks, but the problem is the management. They didn't have a safe way that you can go to there and have 100% sure of they'll leave you go inside. One week they just said that I should pay 100.00$ in another moment I go on without pay nothing just my drinks, in another opportunity I just buy my ticket on Eventbrite. So they should improve that, stop with the discrimination and leave the people enjoy the place. The space to dance is really small it's another problem too.",,,
12,Melissa I.,"Freehold, NJ",220,307,408,3.0,4/8/2018,"I actually had no intention of coming here for my birthday. I wanted to go to Fishbowl but they were closed due to a private party and told us to go upstairs instead.. so it was much more spacious than the other areas like the 1st floor. The drinks were expensive but that's new york. They were very good drinks though. I ordered the 'Wild Berry' and it was delicious. I usually don't even finish drinks but I finished that one. Everyone else I was with enjoyed their drinks too. We also ordered the pretzel bites which were very good and I loved the dips with it. I liked that this place was more of a lounge than a club but even though the music wasn't blasting, we could barely hear our server. We could hear each other though which was great. We didn't need to scream to have a conversation, we could just talk normal and relax. This place had a nice view of Times Square and a decent place.",1,,
13,Ray Z.,"Chicago, IL",167,1,0,5.0,10/5/2018,"I had one of my best party time at PhD. Very good drinks, dance floor and rooftop view of the city! Thanks to the promoter Adam Cohen. He really made my night awesome. We'd not able to get in so fast if not because of Adam have us on his VIP list! He gave us free drinks throughout the night too. Contact this awesome guy for a fun night, his number is 9293547877",,,
14,Lauren S.,"Brooklyn, NY",12,118,0,1.0,10/16/2017,"This is probably one of the worst rooftops in manhattan. I have been here several times and have not enjoyed any of the experiences. The entire staff is a nightmare- the doormen have been rude more than once and the last time I was there I politely nodded my head to the bartender to get his attention and he waved me away and made a rude face. I still don't know what that was. I went upstairs to the bar instead. The rooftop itself is just couches and a bar, I have never experienced music or dancing on the actual roof. The indoor floor downstairs is super tiny and that's where the dancing is. The music is usually iffy and the crowd is super young and touristy. There are better rooftops in the city, don't waste your time.",13,5,
15,Brittany A.,"Toronto, Canada",222,607,986,2.0,5/4/2017,"This was for sure a ""meh"" experience for me.We ended up on this rooftop to celebrate a friend's birthday while in NYC. The views were pretty cool but the vibes were not so chill.Feeling fancy, I ordered a glass of Moet and the bartender filled the glass just over halfway. When my fiance politely asked her to top it up, she snapped and said ""thats a champagne pour!"" Um ok cool, thanks for everything!!The peeps we were with had ordered a ton of bottles and were hanging out in an area with seating but it wasn't cordoned off so the birthday boy's girlfriend spent most of her night shooing away randoms trying to steal drinks. Just not my scene folks. The highlight of the night was seeing a neon ""It was All a Dream"" sign hanging over the exit as we left. BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!",5,4,
16,Emily F.,"Freehold, NJ",159,36,63,1.0,10/28/2018,"Went here for halloween weekend (Oct 28, Saturday) with a group of friends. I was the 4th person in line along with my friends at 9:45pm, ticket was valid from 10pm-4am. While waiting in line there were a bunch of workers trying to scan our tickets and their phone scanners weren't working, it was very disorganized. My ticket actually never got scanned because they had no idea what they were doing. Then it was 10:05pm and we were still standing outside. We were told they would let people in once their security guard showed up. Suddenly, people who paid extra for fast passes started showing up, and then they allowed them inside, especially for those who had table service or paid for the open bar which started at 10pm and they were running behind.  We stood, watching. More and more fast past people came and went, and we still stood there..watching. They did not balance admitting the general admission line with the fast past line which I thought was poor customer service. Usually if there is no one on the fast past line, general admission should go in, but for some reason they just let everyone in fast past go until there was no one else. So much for getting there at 9:45. We tried to ask the guy why this was happening and he just explained that fast past goes first...ok..Finally at about 10:15/10:20 we walked in..just to wait another 15 minutes to be let into the elevator to go up (understandable). We got there, started dancing, place was getting crowded. They had bar runners going to and from tables with bottle service. There was one RUDE runner who targeted my friend not once, BUT TWICE, claiming she pushed him as she was minding her own business, DANCING on the dance floor as he was working his way through the crowd. He literally yelled in her face twice to the point where she was almost in tears and completely ruined her night. We were afraid to keep dancing in that section so we moved to another section near a security guard. Suddenly a group of girls told the guard for us to move because we were in their section since they paid for that section or something. So now we really had no choice but to go upstairs to the terrace where the music was low and there wasn't any dancing. It was too packed, the bar runner was completely high strung and ruined my friends night, and they were completely disorganized during admission. I heard such good things about this place.. but lesson is..don't come here for a special occasion like a holiday weekend.  As I read other reviews it seems that other people had experiences with rude workers as well. That is a disgrace and no one deserves to be treated poorly as a paying customer.",,,
17,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,325,593,4.0,11/29/2017,"Usually a tough place to get into, but we got in pretty easily on a Friday night. We were just two of us and it was past 1 am but the bouncer let us in with no hassle. Initially we headed here just to get a drink but were pleasantly surprised to find a lively dance club instead!Upstairs the place is more club than rooftop, though they have a small outdoor area which was closed at the time. The space is compact but was absolutely thumping when we went! Great crowd, plenty of people rubbing shoulders and a DJ who was doing an amazing job with the music. The sound system is top notch as well and can rival some of the best clubs in the city. Drinks are pricey as expected, maybe pre game a bit before coming. Also make sure to dress well or you might stand out for the wrong reasons. All in all a really good club in the area.",1,,
18,Paul S.,"Brooklyn, NY",401,147,0,2.0,4/16/2018,"I attended a private event here on a Wednesday evening, following a tech meetup. The event organizers had resolved the back room on the 16th floor.Staff were rude, snobby and unresponsive. The forced a bag check about everyone (what did they think, nerds with contraband?) and ""checked"" IDs of people over 40 (bouncer didn't look, but did scan the licenses in to their computer system for marketing purposes).When we got upstairs, the bartender managed to ignore us (despite there being no line). I walked away and was eventually served by a waitress. Eventually. Food was tasty.Save the attitude for the Saturday night club kids [*]. It's totally inappropriate for a business function.[* Actually, that sort of attitude really shouldn't be used anywhere.]",3,,
19,Tim S.,"Boca Raton, FL",434,482,3771,1.0,9/10/2017,"I had so many good times, good food and good drinks last weekend in New York.   One place earned a 1 star.  The star is the minimum of course, and that I would have given anyhow for the view.  Sadly after that, I gotta say I felt bad I talked my group into going here.  It started with a door man that was overly chill about his job.  He was rude to the group in front of us, then some other people in the lobby.   The group in front of us that was told, ""oh you will be waiting a long time for your turn"", then kicked em out of the elevator for one couple that walked in.  It was odd for for sure.  Once upstairs we were liking the view but the prices were high and, honestly, not served well.   They have an automatic tip so that takes some of the pressure for good service imagine.  We tried to sit down somewhere(we got there about 4 in the afternoon and there was about 6 other people),  but there was reservation signs on all the tables.  We took a seat anyhow, as it had been quite a pro to get this far.  The view was darn near worth all the production, but I will probably hit a different rooftop spot next time.",9,1,3
20,Peggie Y.,"New York, NY",212,180,2469,1.0,3/19/2017,"Came here as a group of 4 on a Saturday around midnight.  The bouncer at the entrance downstairs told us that there's a $200 minimum bar tab in order to get in.  We decided to still go check it out.  Once we arrived, the place was packed, to the point that you could barely walk around.  We were able to find a table at a corner.  As I sat down to look around, I saw all kinds of people in the crowd - people who were dressed up in business attire, people who were having a girls night out, people wearing baseball caps and sports jerseys, college students, tourists, etc.  It's very interesting especially for a place that boasts its classy environment by imposing a minimum charge for groups.   The view was nice, overlooking Times Square, and there's a mini-balcony where you could hang out with your party if the enclosed space is too crowded.  Overall, the space is too small, and it's way too crowded.  The environment is very causal, if you want a classier place with a view, you should spend your money somewhere else.  It's definitely not worth the couple hundred dollars that night for an overcrowded space with so few to offer, other than people slamming into my party and us getting drinks spilled onto.",6,,2
21,Arian R.,"San Francisco, CA",0,1,0,1.0,10/28/2018,The staff was very rude. It was so overcrowded that you couldn't move. It was the worst experience,,,
22,Eddie W.,"San Francisco, CA",593,1285,3273,2.0,7/3/2017,Rooftop bar is small and the service is unfriendly Drinks are water down and overpricedView is limited and not worth the trip Overall Thoughts There are better rooftop bars in NYC,9,2,1
23,Sean E.,"Centerport, NY",198,246,128,4.0,6/22/2017,"Most recently, I went in for the summer launch party with DJ Cassidy. The line was wild - it wrapped around the block! Fortunately I was on someone's list, my +1 and I were brought up fairly quickly. To get it out of the way - if you're not here on someone else's dime, prepare to spend a lot. Minimum tabs are common. I don't know why people are writing bad reviews over it though, I'm not sure what they were expecting - it's PHD for crying out loud. That said, in my experience the bartenders do their level best to make it worth it. I received generous pours and stiff drinks. I stuck mainly to whisky, tried their Blackberry Smash which was pretty good, but a bit too sweet for me. They had Balvenie, which was neat (pun intended) because I don't see that everywhere. Needed a water break and they handed me a small bottle of Evian, which is how you know it's a fancy party, right?The much-hyped DJ Cassidy was pretty damn good; it almost made me want to stick out the crowd upstairs on the terrace. Unfortunately because it was a launch party, the crowd was really, really thick, and we wound up heading downstairs into their indoor area. The DJ below was fine as well, so we mostly camped there and on this outer stretch behind the lower bar. People were smoking out there, but because there were so few, we could really breathe (that's irony for you.)All in all, it was a really good party. I'd go back in a heartbeat, but only if someone else is buying!",3,3,5
24,Naomi T.,"Shingle Springs, CA",400,175,67,3.0,7/20/2018,"I went here with my niece for their rooftop happy hour. I checked in with the front desk, and they immediately asked me if I had a reservation. I didn't recall seeing anywhere on their website that I needed a reservation, so that was very confusing. They let me up to the roof, and once there, I found a very busy rooftop with lots of folks. There were plenty of seats and waitresses walking around with free snacks, which was great. The reason this only has 3 stars is because when I went to the bar to get a glass of wine, it costed $23!! One glass of wine, TWENTY THREE DOLLARS... what a rip off. Of course I paid for it, I'd feel bad not paying for it after they poured it, but I was not happy. The view was great from the rooftop, but I probably wouldn't go back (unless I pre-partied elsewhere, ha ha).",,,
25,Lauren H.,"Aliso Viejo, CA",0,19,3,3.0,8/3/2018,"Came here with a couple friends and the bar is beautiful, I must say. The views of Broadway are spectacular. It started picking up around 11. They have good music and a great snack/cocktail menu (awesome truffle fries). Would be a 5 star experience if it was not such a price gouge. Prepare to pay $19 with tax/tip for a weak vodka sprite in a plastic cup, on top of cover. This is not the bar for girls on a budget.",,,
26,Aziz X.,"Albemarle, NC",74,2,0,1.0,7/21/2018,I was there two nights (Wednesday) ago. The guy by the door is a jerk. I understand minimum spends and differential pricing (men vs women) but there is also differential pricing between men - not sure on what basis. Minimim charge for one male can be $x and for another it can be $y depending on his mood. He might answer a question and just walk away and ignore you waiting for a line to build up even if the  place is empty. Your tab will be locked with  one of the three bars they have in there and you can't use your minimum spend  on another bar in the venue. The place itself is ok and nothing special. Save you money and dignity and go elsewhere. It's less of a lounge and more of small cramped bottle service place. If that's your thing then go for it.,,,
27,Sarah C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,3,5.0,2/22/2018,"One of my all time favorite rooftops in the city!! You get the excitement and energy of Times Square without actually having to deal with the touristy chaos. The different rooms of the terrace provide a different vibe for everyone depending on what you are looking for and the staff goes above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of. (I even had a hostess chase us down when my friend accidentally left her purse behind... that's not something you see often in NYC!) I've come a lot in the evenings but if you can catch sunset cocktails here, it's totally worth it. Music is totally on point too. If it's good enough for Leo DiCaprio to frequent here, then it's good enough for me!!!!",,,

31,Wendy W.,"Houston, TX",565,336,681,2.0,2/11/2017,"Came here at 12:30 on a Saturday night.Line was down the street. Luckily my friend knows people and we didn't have to wait! Thank baby Jesus because there were like 15 people on the upper level terrace level. Why the long line???  You'll soon read... Pros:  Side view Times Square. Small area if you want something intimate. Cons:Side view of Times Square. Small area and ONE bar tender. Drinks were $16 plus for not a happening place I guess that's all you need for the small number of people? Who knows. Forget the upper level. Move to the lower level club area. It may have a different name, however it's all connected. Definitely a younger crowd and a little raunchy (think open toe strappy heels and tight minis in 30 degree weather), but good music and ridiculously awesome people watching. And it WAS wall to wall packed by 1am.Why the crowd doesn't move upstairs and take on a party of their own is beyond me. Instead I suppose everyone loves slamming into everyone and spilling drinks and taking 10 minutes to get to one side of the small bar to the other. What the heck?!?!?'I definitely wouldn't wait in this line unless you're 20 something. Again, thankfully my friend knows folks. There are WAY better places in NYC where the real elite and cool folks hang, this ain't it.",10,10,8

34,Kristie O.,"Beverly Hills, CA",341,18,33,1.0,7/30/2017,"Went this weekend for a friend's birthday. We got there around midnight and the line was basically as long as you'd expect for a ""fancy"" rooftop club. However the staff in the front were incredibly rude and they would push and shove us around instead of using their words (if you want us to step aside, just ask!). We had gotten a table for the night which included bottle service - but the bouncers and staff pushed the 2 guys from our group out of the line, saying that they weren't allowed in unless they paid a separate $150 bar tab and proceeded to yell at them for their credit cards. Now, to me, this is a pretty standard practice if we were just walking in but who would pay a separate bar tab if they ordered bottle service?! The birthday girl came down to figure things out and only after she confirmed her credit card # and table reservation were they allowed to enter (but that didnt stop the staff from being extremely hard to work with or give us dirty looks and roll their eyes the entire time we were trying to figure it out).Inside wasn't much better, with most of the club packed like sardines. The space is just too small and underwhelming for what they charge and to be honest, the only reason why it was bearable was because we had our tiny space at our table. If you want to spend your night with underage teenagers who paid their way in or 50 year old creeps, this is the place for you. Almost everyone is a foreigner and that's probably because local New Yorkers know better than to hang out at this disaster in Midtown, nonetheless.Extremely disappointed but if you find yourself still interested in a PHD experience, I'd recommend avoiding this place and heading down to the one @ the Dream Hotel in Meatpacking/Chelsea. It's much bigger and the rooftop doesn't disappoint. This place.... save your money.",5,1,

The drinks were strong which was good considering that it was pricey. Ordered the chicken & biscuits which were also quite delicious. The bartenders were nice, but the one biggest problem was the rudest bus boy I'd ever encountered. We had a drink menu and a food menu. We hadn't looked at the food menu yet and were busy looking at the drink menu when the bus boy snatches the food menu and gives it to the table next to ours. We stop him and say excuse us we're still looking at that, but he scoffs and angrily walks away.

38,Sam V.,"New York, NY",81,190,470,5.0,4/5/2018,Came on a Saturday night. The first floor was insanely packed with what looked like a college party so my friends and I proceeded to the second floor which you can enter by using the stairs by the elevator. Second floor is much more spacious. My friends got cocktails which were expensive and not that great. They also ordered pretzel bites which they seemed to enjoy. I settled for a beer cause that was def he most affordable thing on the menu. Service was slow so we just ordered at the bar which wasn't a problem.  I liked the ambiance here. It's pretty much a typical lounge in the city with a solid view of city. Def looking forward to coming back here when it's nicer out. Bouncers here made me a bit nervous but it wasn't difficult getting in.,,,

Upstairs nice views, all tables ""reserved"", bar staff attitude unless you are a 10 model, if not you get ignored, and they add tip on automatically.........I guess when it is included you can treat the ""others"" however you want.

44,Tara L.,"Brookfield, CT",275,4,0,1.0,10/16/2017,"I attended a celebration on the PHD Terrace at Dream Hotel last Thursday evening (10/12) for a colleague's birthday.  It was 90s themed so the group I was with was dressed very differently than the attire we would normally go out in.  I was the first of four women in my group who all presented our ID's to the doorman outside the elevator before stepping on.  The doorman looked over my ID, scanned a little black light over it, and held it in his hand as he continued to check the other girls' IDs.  I was a bit confused, seeing as I'm 25 - almost 26 - years old.  And after five solid minutes of holding on to my ID without returning it to me, he started cupping it in his hand, bending my CT Driver's License almost completely in half.  I asked him if there was a problem and he asked if I had anything else to validate my age.  I told him I didn't, because that's my valid Driver's License and I shouldn't need anything else.  But I pulled out my credit cards and insurance cards to validate that I was indeed the person on my license.  He continued to cup my Driver's License in his hand, bending it to the point where we all thought he was going to snap it in half.Another man stepped off the elevator, a manager I'm assuming, and asked what the problem was.  The doorman showed him my ID and said ""The plastic is coming up, see that line?  A real ID wouldn't do that."" (The reason there was a line was because he had been bending it for five minutes, but I digress...).  I continued to show the two men the rest of the cards in my wallet - including a ZipCard that I wouldn't be able to obtain if I wasn't over the age of 25. The manager told me to ""calm down"" and that ""they were just doing their job.""  They continued to look at my license together, then asked the building line behind me if anyone else had a CT Driver's License.  Needless to say, at this point, I was pretty upset.  This wasn't ""doing their job,"" it was borderline interrogation.  Eventually, the manager gave me a half-heated apology and let me go up in the elevator where I enjoyed a $19 cosmopolitan (made by a wonderful bartender - she was super nice.  The only redeeming quality about this place.)I truly believe that if they're going to be as ""strict"" about who they let up to their terrace, they need to have an ID scanner.  Not only is my driver's license valid, but I'm a 25-year-old woman.  I'm not a fresh 21-year-old, I'm not a super petite-looking girl - I think this doorman was just looking to cause trouble.  If he had snapped my valid ID, I would have absolutely called the cops.  However, he bent my ID to the point where I now have to visit AAA the next time I'm home to see if they can rectify the giant line he created down the center of my license.  If it's going to cost me any money, I will certainly be visiting to Dream Hotel again only to inform them that their doorman's incompetency and need for excitement caused him to damage my personal property and that I expect them to foot that bill.",16,6,

My guess is that waiting in line makes the experience much worse, and we got there before lines started.

60,Anna G.,"Manhattan, NY",180,123,191,3.0,4/28/2016,"Located in midtown- this rooftop offers a partial view of Times Square and the expected marked-up beverages that are standard when cocktailing and dining at a rooftop in NYC. The staff is attentive and the bartenders know how to mix and pour a mean drink so you will not be wasting your money/time on a poorly crafted beverage. Definitely try one of their cocktails if you are in the mood - they have a variety of interesting options. Also if you are into fries (and seriously who isn't), then order-up! Their fries are crispy, crunchy, salty and a perfect accompaniment to a pair with drinks and friends. I would suggest calling in advance to reserve a table. If not there is ample room to stand around the bar and their outdoor space offers some seating and a few tables. This location gets packed in the evening so enjoying a cocktail hour timed drink (5-8p) and moving on I would recommend. My overall experience was okay.

I called and wrote to PHD terrace in advance to get a sense of cover and lines so that my guests could be informed and prepared.First, I was told that they could provide no information on lines. Now, I understand that every week can be different and things happen that can be unpredictable.  Still, it's hard to believe that a business is so unaware of their customer base that they can't make a general statement such as ""While obviously there are no guarantees, we typically have lines forming between 10-11pm, so arriving by 9-9:30pm is usually pretty safe to avoid lines.""  Or ""We hardly ever have lines over 10 minutes.""  Or something.  Second, I was told that while there is no ""cover,"" the doorman ***may*** (at his own discretion) apply a mandatory bar minimum of up to $80 per person.  This policy is abhorrent for a few reasons.  (a) Drinks are roughly $15, so a bar minimum of $80 would require someone to consume at least 5 drinks.  For non-alcoholics who want to attend for a couple of hours, that isn't even safe, let alone reasonable.  (b) Some customers will be forced to purchase at least 5 drinks while others can enjoy the rooftop atmosphere while sipping 1-2 drinks.  (c) it doesn't appear to matter how long the people are there, so if they can only physically handle 2 drinks, that amounts to a massive $50 cover.How can I plan a party for that where guests show up at different times?  How fair is it that some people can come in with no bar min while other guests do not have to?  This policy is ripe for discrimination, and potential customers should be aware of this going in.",15,1,2

My girls spent $5000 at Bagatelle and was not comfortable with committing to that. I told him we would just go to the bar and run a tab. He then said he could not let us in without committing to that minimum even if it was to go to the bar. There was no mention of capacity so I am unsure why 20 of us would not be welcomed.

I should also mention the continuous ""you people"" remarks made when speaking to us. Although the  hotel coordinator explained that after 9:30 pm, the hotel guest no longer have preferred access, it does not give the doorman a license to be disrespectful. We spoke to the managers of Dream and they were just as appalled by his behavior and treatment toward us. They made appreciated accommodations for the embarrassment and pledged to speak to the manager of PHD. In review of other negative reviews, it is clear that this is a reoccurring issue. It is sad that nothing has been done to change this tarnished reputation.

Such a great recommendation for this place!!! Amazing staff, amazing bouncers, amazing people, amazing atmosphere, amazing view of Times Square and overall great night!",,,

90,Tianyi Z.,"Irvine, CA",49,16,0,1.0,5/14/2016,"This place certainly deserves a negative rating, too bad one star is the lowest to go. it was about post 1am, when the place got so packed that people touch and bump each other all the time. I was dancing with two girl friends, and all of sudden I saw a guy rudely grabbing my pretty friend's arm and yelling at her. my first reaction was that he's a drunk guy trying to take advantage of my friend. So we took her back to our seat while our male friend held that guy. But, after we were back to our seat when everything seemed to be settled, that same guy rushed over and started to pull my friend, while shouting some ""F"" words. I were to find club security but then I heard that guy said that he's security and he wants us all out. I noticed that he was wearing a earphone and didn't look drunk (but completely rude). He literally dragged my friend's legs and threw her off the floor!!! I've never seen such rudeness ever before. We tried our best stopping him and held our friend leaving this terrible place while a couple of other big tall guys pushed us all the way out. All of us, including my poor friend that got so mad being offended like this, were sober. I think, the club is fully responsible for such unacceptable and even illegal personal infringement to its customers. They didn't claim their identity nor gave any explanation before using violence and dirty words against innocent customers whom didn't do anything wrong. Their rudeness to female customers had no difference from sexual harassement. Many reviews toward PHD (incl. the Rooftop Lounge downtown) reflect frequency of such behavior - bouncers tend to escort customers soon after bill payment to flip table. To do that, they initiated a hustle then used their ""discretion"" to escort ""drunk"" customers whom were actually sober but irriated. Such uncivilized behavior has caused physical and mental injuries to my friends and I. Such a bad memory could last for a lifetime. Anybody that can provide any legal advice for us to seek for justice would be highly appreciated. We should NOT let this happen to anybody else going forward.",20,1,4
91,Drea D.,"New York, NY",60,14,0,1.0,5/25/2016,"This is the shittiest place I've ever been.  The hostess was snobby, incredibly rude, and treated us like we were not good enough to breathe the air around her. She also told us that it was 100$ for a dude to get into the rooftop bar/club. What the FUCK there are like a million rooftop bars in NYC, tbh, I don't know why we even came to midtown cause everything's expensive around here anyway.",12,1,4
92,Guillaume S.,"Manhattan Valley, Manhattan, NY",1,1,0,1.0,7/3/2016,"If you think about going there for 4th, I hope you have not bought your tickets yet, because they are overselling and you might not get in, so you may want to revise your plans... Good luck",5,1,
93,Jenni R.,"Odessa, FL",0,6,1,1.0,3/17/2017,"I usually do not give bad reviews, but this place highly deserves to not even have its doors open. I do not know whom is managing the place, but they need some serious help on being properly taught how to run a business. The employees there are extremely rude since walking through the security line, coat check has no respect, and the guy who opens elevator for you. Honestly, they treat you like garbage and act as if they are officers at a prison. It is not that serious at all in a club. I understand and respect checking everyone as we all want to be safe, but my case was the disrespect and rudeness everyone gave my group. I would not recommend this place in anyway in NY. Especially, when you are there to spend money. If you are in NY and want to have some fun please visit silent disco. Now that is a place to some fun and the service is amazing! I know they will not be open for long and the owner needs to hire a new person to manage it. I'm a business owner and speak from experience.",3,1,
94,Eric Z.,"Saint George, UT",71,2,0,1.0,5/14/2016,"Worst bar ever. After we sign the bill,  suddenly the guard asked us to leave. Hard to believe. The guard pushed us and yelled at us with dirty words. Cann't imagine this stupid thing happened. I strongly suggested you to go somewhere else.",9,1,3
95,Laure A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,5/20/2017,This place was one of the best places that used to come visit every weekend the new doorman is a douche bag his name is Mike and they brought this new spanish hostess she speak barely english,1,,
96,Meghan E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,2.0,9/1/2016,"SOOOO not impressed by this bar/lounge/club. My expectations were pretty high when I found out you  needed bottle service to have a reserved section. I have been to many Vegas clubs and always get table service, but since it was just myself and my husband, decided not to.Drinks-strong and that is why I am giving 2 stars. The food is even good.Scene-interesting...on the terrace we were told we could sit at a table until the party that reserved it arrived. That was nice of them, but I didn't really see anyone with bottle service. A girl was puking in the corner, the crowd was pretty trashy. There were either really old people or 21 year olds that were sloppy drunk. Men were spitting off the rooftop and when we notified security they went to talk to them. Next thing the men, well boys, were spitting on the floor. Overall, very bad experience. Will not go back, will not refer anyone to go there.",2,,
97,Maria L.,"Queens, NY",0,1,0,1.0,5/14/2016,"Worst customer service I had in NYC EVER. We organized a farewell party at PHD. After we signed the $2k check, security guards started kicking us out....some barely drank anything....why????!!!! you won't get any explanation. The dudes treated me and my girl friends rudely (I say that was a sexual harassment). And didn't allow us to grab our belongings before we leave. We ended up losing one handbag there.There were other people on the dance floor who were more drank,and tried to have body contacts with strangers aggressively. We did none of these.  The view was average, you can't see anything but few billboards. There are many better options in the neighborhood. You don't want to waste your money here.",8,,3
98,nadiya m.,"Flushing, NY",0,25,1,2.0,4/4/2017,They get two stars for the nice views.  There security and staff are rude and incompetent. won't return.  Get ready to pay for $15 to $16 drinks.,1,,
99,Peter E.,"New York, NY",89,5,5,4.0,7/22/2016,We stop by for some drinks after checking out the NYC triathlon expo. Great rooftop bar but be careful if you don't have a reservation. They might move you like they did us from a table near the bar but they made it worth our while. Enjoyed chatting with the crowd and there's decent scenery too.,1,,
100,Nick W.,"New York, NY",0,14,0,1.0,2/19/2017,"Waited in line for an hour starting at 11:15pm and didn't get in. There was no semblance of a line, just a blob of people trying to get in at the same time. Rude bouncers and endless promoters trying to push guys away and get girls in. Not coming back. Ever.",2,,
101,Dr. J.,"West Hills, CA",2,31,0,4.0,8/15/2016,Went on Thurs night. My friend had a table so it was easy for us to get in. The best DJ and music for dancing. Good looking crowd. Girls dressed up quite a bit. The crowd was a little on the younger side (25 yr olds) but still fun. Seems like the only downside is that if you don't have a table then you are gonna have a hard time getting in!,,,
102,A A.,"Flushing, NY",0,4,0,1.0,11/12/2016,"I would give this place no stars if I could. Came here for my own bachelorette party and they let us in no problem then changed their mind because we could not bring in ""props"" since I had a straw. Super rude super shitty service. Much better places out there.",2,1,
103,Watch O.,"New York, NY",3,71,21,1.0,9/28/2016,"This was an awful experience with a humiliation and a physical abuse caused by a bouncer named Hector.In the end of July I came here with a promoter guy who collects pretty girls and they just entertain other men for free. I am a classy girl wearing decent clothing only stayed there for 15 mins (I was never drunk or even tipsy). Our group of guys had their bottles at a particular table which was apparently being prepared for another visitors after I've been at the table for about 10 mins. I've figured out this later. But before that I reached to a bucket of ice to add a few cubes to my drink as I assumed it (still) belonged to our group. I took 4 ice cubes. 4 cubes of ice made of water.Obviously the security guy thought I robed them off their property and called a bouncer on me who was ready to escort me out. In the end, there was aggression from Hector's side, he grabbed me by my arm, which caused the drink to spill on my dress. Should he had initiated a conversation with me in a polite gallant explanatory manner instead of treating me like a criminal, an odd disgraceful situation would have been avoided altogether, I believe.It's a shame for this hotel. This blatant behaviour from a rude incompetent nonchalant abrasive bouncer is not acceptable and he must be punished! I hate this place and this guy!!!!!!!!!",4,,
104,Guonan H.,"Cambridge, MA",0,1,0,1.0,5/25/2016,"Worst place ever, rude staff, horrible security and shitty drinks. The only thing I can compliment is probably the location. Should consider transforming  into a observatory for tourists to see times sq.",13,1,3
105,Mew N.,"The Loop, Chicago, IL",0,1,0,1.0,6/4/2016,"We couldnt get into the club because they said that we had problems with some other club in town before. We were like wtf we are new to the city and havent been anywhere. The guards were VERY RUDE AND LOW CLASS. They were yelling dirty words to us when we refused to step away from the ticketing line. I just dont get why they just pick and choose who can get in and who can't. Probably we are not white and that's the main reason that we couldn't get in. This place is such a bullshit and racist ass and rachet. We got a hotel room here but couldn't get some drinks at the fucking place? I don't even get the reason why they came up with this bs about us having problems before. So dumb. They think that we don't have money to pay for those stupidass drinks, but we dressed up with brand names that cost more than their lifetime savings. Lmao sad life those guards. Would not recommend anyone going there except you wanna get some dumbass experiences from those rude/poor guards. I wish there is a zero star or a negative star to rate this rude place",9,1,3
106,Stanley S.,"Ithaca, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/2/2016,my friends and I were taken out when we still had a whole bottle unfinished on our table. they also overcharged me and nobody responded me after contacting them multiple times. worst club/bar experience in the city.,9,,4

108,Christine V.,"Staten Island, NY",0,4,2,5.0,1/6/2016,"Sorry for the late review.. I attended PHD Terrace for an office holiday party. Had a blast! Was very suprised and pleased with the food. expected typical buffet junk but was treated to chicken and waffle tacos, chimichuri steak, and meatball sliders amungst others.  Staff was delightful  (despite my level of holiday intoxication) The handsome manager with the argyle sweater and majestic beard was a doll and the gentle giant security guys made us feel safe and kept me laughing. I've been back twice since and haven't been let down. very different from the Downtown location but equally impressive. Feels much more intimate than most cold cookie cutter rooftop bars, can't wait for summer sunsets on the patio.",,,
109,Bud F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,5.0,1/11/2016,"Cool place. It's two levels. The top story/terrace is really relaxing. Small platters of food available while you have a drink. Bottom level is for those that want to dance. It gets going around 11pm. The venue is very intimate, and I like it. Will return.",,,1
110,Katrina M.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,5/21/2016,"Have you ever been discriminated against?  I was when I went to the Dream Hotel on 55th.  I have walked into their PHD roof top club literally a dozen times since they recently opened.  I have always walked in on a weekend between Friday-Sunday.  I have never paid $1 and have always had admission without issues.   Today they said I owed a $1500 drink minimum.  Their drinks are about $17 so between the five of us we would have to drink 88?  I looked puzzled and asked is there something going on?  And the guy raised his demand to $2500.  If people should be held accountable for anything it should be their judgment on the public.  What changed? My husband and I have literally walked in with hoodies.  Well this egotistical prick at the door that decided I was not ""worthy"" to enter.  Sometimes I can't understand how people can act this way to others.  This ""club"" is always empty.  I used to bring people from out of town there to enjoy the view and have a few drinks, but if this is the type of behavior they condone I will never step foot in there again.",14,,5
