0,Valerie N.,"Manhattan, NY",12,324,399,4.0,10/29/2018,"I'm surprised the score is low since I actually enjoyed my meal. I ordered the eggs benny with smoked salmon, but they did mess up my order and give me lobster instead. My Benedict was delicious and a generous portion. The lobster was moist and the eggs were poached well! The caveat is the muffin got soggy VERY fast. Perhaps if they toasted it longer, it would have been better. Side of bacon was good too! The side bagel is skippable, but the jam that was included was great!",,,
1,Giselle C.,"New York, NY",497,42,75,3.0,10/29/2018,"Food 4/5. Service 2/5. Ambiance 3/5. Location 5/5. This restaurant is located right in Herald Sq, close to the Broadway intersection. It is such a convenient area to locate to, so it's great for groups. The inside is small and is two stories. There is a bar on the first floor. The seating on the first floor is a bit awk because people are waiting for tables and they could be right next to your table while they are waiting. It's awkward.  The second level is a bit cramped and noisy since the noise from the first level will rise up. We came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. We had a mix of dishes ordered from breakfast and lunch menus. The burger and fries that I had were cooked perfectly and the eggs I heard were also very well done. In general the food I would give a food rating for both taste and plating. The beverages though I would rate lower. The juices are expensive and So is the coffee. They don't taste very fresh and our server was MIA so we couldn't ask for refills. Make sure to call and make a reservation because it does get busy. I called that very morning for a table for 8 and we were squeezed into the schedule. A+ for the hostess. Brunch place with my big This restaurant is so cute! From the pictures n yelp and in person it is truly a wonderful find. On the weekends it is not too crowded, and allows for a group to comfortably sit and social for a couple hours. The back room has a two floor vaulted ceiling with skylights so that the sun can shine through. We ordered a couple breakfast items (pancakes and eggs Benedict, and a couple burgers). All of the food was well done, and the server was very attentive. Bathrooms were downstairs and dimly lit. Would return again if I was more of a brunch person.",,,
2,Sean C.,"Kissimmee, FL",265,91,212,5.0,10/5/2018,"I am really glad we ran into this restaurant while wandering around town.  It was a very pleasant surprise - and included a 5% yelp cash back offer!First, try to sit upstairs, the view is great and it's less crowded and much quieter.  We snagged a seat by the window, which was perfect for the beautiful fall day.  Our service was very quick, everyone was attentive; so much, that our waters were never more than half empty. I was hoping for bit more of a brunch style menu, but was thrilled to find the omelet on the normal lunch menu.  It ended up being pretty tasty and came with some thin cut French fries and a salad. I loved the subtle difference from a normal omelet with heavy side dishes.  If I wasn't so bent on getting breakfast food, I would have really enjoyed the bread that came out first. The bread was great, but I wasn't in the mood, sadly.",1,,
3,Ilse V.,"Murrieta, CA",88,222,443,4.0,10/1/2018,"We came here for breakfast during the week after I found it online. I loved the way it was set up and decorated. Staff was friendly and service went fairly fast. Only remark regarding our server was that when we ordered Nutella and Banana Toast she just wrote it down. When the table next to us ordered it she went ""Oh you can also have pancakes with Nutella and Banana"". Wish she would have told us. The Greek yogurt and Eggs Style plate were good. The bathroom unfortunately did not look recently cleaned at all. Kind of surprising at 8:30am. Really a turn off.All in all a good experience though. I'd come back here.",,,
4,Megan C.,"Chicago, IL",466,98,44,3.0,9/7/2018,"We came pretty late for brunch on a Monday, just a party of two. Service took quite a while, we waited at least 15 minutes for just the menus. Our server let us know that if we wanted to order brunch (they stop serving it at 11:30AM), we'd have to order quickly.. yet they didn't come back to take our order until 11:40? Confusing but at least they were still able to cater to my brunch entree choice. We got the flight of dips as an appetizer, it was good! However, I got the Chorizo and Manchego scramble and it was quite underwhelming. Practically no flavor and it was lukewarm when it arrived at our table. My friend also did not enjoy her salmon burger either. I would say this restaurant was a complete miss for us, although we did enjoy the decor, everything was super cute but the food was just not up to par with the prices or the wait that we experienced.",,,
5,David S.,"Alexandria, LA",23,120,49,3.0,9/2/2018,"The food was good quality, but the portions are kind of small. The service was good in getting the food to the table, but it was difficult to get the waitress' attention to get butter for the toast or a refill of water. And, don't even venture into the bathroom. In the men's room, there's one toilet, without a seat!!! I wonder if it's any better in the ladies room?",,1,
6,Janice D.,"Boston, MA",47,80,65,5.0,8/22/2018,"I found this cute restaurant on my way downtown. As its name may suggest, it is located near Herald Square. I came in for brunch by myself and sat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and nice. The bar is decorated with fruits and flowers, what adds to the relaxing asmosphere among the chaos of the city.Due to their advertising on the door, I was expecting a more extensive brunch menu (especially coming in around 11am). Instead, at this time they offered me a menu that had a few brunch dishes hidden throughout. I had the Egg White Omelette, which was divine. The mix of avocado with pico de Gallo was unexpected in a ver serendipitous way. The omelette was served with toasted bread and chips, and its portion was enough to get me through the day. I left feeling very satisfied with the quality of the food, the service and clean facilities. I would recommend it based on my one visit.Ohh... and they do happy hour M-F from 4-6pm.",,,
7,Christen W.,"Bayonne, NJ",0,1,1,4.0,11/13/2018,"Decided to try this restaurant since it was our first time visiting the Harold Square area. We waited about 15min for a table, mostly because the server forgot us since she accidentally erased our name from the wait list. We were seated upstairs which has a nice view and the decor is very pretty. Waited some time for the server to come over to take our orders. Once we ordered, the food came quickly. The breakfast was a little pricey but good. Both my friend and I ordered the two eggs breakfast which came with spinach salad, a piece of whole grain homemade toast, your choice of breakfast meat (I ordered maple chicken sausage), and rosemary potatoes. While the food is quite good, the price and hardly seeing a server come by during the meal is the reason for the 4 star rating.",,,
8,Sou M.,"Seattle, WA",226,168,640,2.0,7/9/2018,"We came to this place for a sunday brunch on our last day of nyc trip. Here's the breakdown on my interview: Ambience: nice, touches of french and elements of macho culture (hats every where), well litService: nice and friendly staff, helpful host. Got coffee refills upon request Food: this is the part that really underwhelmed us. My friend ordered a medium rare burger ($20) and a side of grits. I got the eggs and ribs. The burger came out raw inside, uncooked, and tasteless. The ribs were immersed in a fatty broth, and had no taste or seasoning. I tried to spice it up by adding salt and pepper but i couldnt really change the tasteless taste. Why 2 stars? I think the food was 3 stars but the overall experience, including the value for price was not more than 2 stars. When i pay $20 for a burger and $75 for two brunch plates and coffee, i expect a minimum level of quality.",1,,2
9,Amanda K R.,"Lindenhurst, NY",91,162,1015,5.0,1/20/2018,"Woman's March 2018 - got a sick deal on a room after logging 5 milesGetting the evening started with a appetizer ""flight"" Warm pita with a perfectly portioned  plate of baba  ganoush, teramusalata, tzatziki and something. Spicy.  Yummy. Prosecco chaser and off we go!My mixologist Alyssa (?) was fabulous. Running her butt off but never missed a beat keeping her full bar well attended to. Definitely a spot that will have me returning to.  With all the lights and touristy hoopla that can have a local wishing to get off the beaten path, the Harold was classy, affordable (by NY standards) and an eclectic menu that would satisfy even the pickiest eater.  Well done.  You have a fan for sure.",3,2,4
10,Jamie P.,"New York, NY",552,22,13,4.0,10/2/2018,"Brunch here is great and the location is great. Although it is on a busy street, it is located in a such a convenient location! With the QNRW, PATH, and Penn Station being close by, no one should have a problem getting here. Make sure to get their fish and chips!",,,
11,Jess L.,"New Haven, CT",3282,4310,3309,4.0,11/25/2017,"Looking for a good brunch place in NoMad, I wasn't exactly sure what I'd find. Thankfully, The Harold saved the day.This restaurant is quite unique in ambiance. It's airy, with its central staircase, but there are books by the window that also make it feel cozy. I love the exposed brick and appreciate the legitimate coat hooks.Yes, it's a tad expensive for what it is but not astronomical. Furthermore, their portions are on the larger side.My favorite was the egg with grits. There was a nice amount of bacon in the grits skillet. I'd rarely mention a side salad, but it was dressed nicely. Other solid items at the table were the breakfast panini and mushroom omelette. The only downside of the meal was the coffee, which was pretty dreck. Pleasantly surprised!",5,1,3
12,Caroline N.,"Queens, NY",37,235,1745,3.0,1/19/2018,"When my friend suggested this place for our holiday gathering spot, I was a bit skeptical since it's in the middle of a busy location.  Though, I passed by this place numerous times and never even noticed the restaurant.My friend warned me to get there early as it gets crowded quickly.  No joke, it does!  I am supposed to meet my friend at 12:00PM and got there at 11:45AM.  Got the last table with 2 seats on the 2nd floor before the wait list line started.  I was thankful...maybe I shouldn't have been!  I would like to say outright that our waitress was really sweet and friendly.  The place is cozy and warm.  The reason for the so-so rating is the extremely long wait for the meals to arrive.  I was not sure if there weren't enough cooks in the kitchen or if something happened.  I feel for the wait staff, who had to climb a flight of steel stairs carrying drinks and food, as the kitchen located on the ground floor.While waiting for my friend, I ordered a cup of tea which took a while to arrive so didn't too much of it (Sign #1).  My friend arrives.  It took a while for us to find our waitress and order.  We ordered food.  I was able to catch up with my friend to the point we we're both starving.  We asked the waitress about our food and she went to check.  The meals for the other table arrived.  After 10 minutes, our meals arrives.  The food is great!  No complaints there.If you have time to wait, this is a good place.  If you don't have time to wait, mark this place for another time.",,,
13,Anonymous A.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,3.0,11/3/2018,"I had a very mixed experience at the Harold recently.   While the bartenders are very nice and the food is good - They have issues:1.   They do not inform people when Happy Hour is over.   The person next to me was busy having a conversation with someone and not watching the clock and the bartender asked if we wanted another glass of wine and the patron said yes.   When the wine was delivered, the patron said - it's still Happy Hour, right?  The bartender said - no it was over 5 minutes ago!  The patron said ""you should have told me.  Will you honor the happy hour price?"" And the answer was NO!   That is just not right!   Every where I have ever been - the bartender always makes a pass to everyone 5 minutes before it ends to see if they would like another drink or happy hour food!   The Harold does NOT do that!2.  In addition - a patron ordered  French fries and someone other than the bartender brought the fries and put them down on the bar in front of someone else.   The someone else put their hand in the fries and took some!   When the bartender noticed that they were put in front of the wrong person - he just moved the plate over to the person that ordered them!   That is just WRONG!!!!   Someone else put their hands on the other person's food!!!   WRONG!!!   3.   The vent from the A/C unit was dripping on my head and down my neck.   It dripped several times.   I was wearing a sweat shirt so nothing was ruined - however, when I told the manager - they did absolutely nothing about it - not even offer to buy a drink!   It was dripping on my head!!!!!This place seems to fill up in spite of themselves - so perhaps management doesn't care about these things!   But these were three unacceptable things that I observed in one evening!",,,
14,Britt C.,"Austin, TX",5,53,6,4.0,12/14/2017,"This place was adorable for brunch. It is quite small so it was frustrating trying to get into the restaurant and wait at the host stand. It was very crowded by the bar. However, luckily we were seated in the window area that was tucked away. Our server was absolutely phenomenal- she was so attentive and sweet. Made me feel like I was back down south with her manners!The food was alright. It wasn't bad, but my eggs Benedict were bland. They definitely could do something to enhance the hollandaise sauce. Combined with the large potatoes made it quite dull.",,,
15,Cindy W.,"Manhattan, NY",35,111,336,2.0,10/29/2017,"Food is slightly above average. Waitstaff is nice enough. They each earned a star.But, I've dined here two times and food just comes TOO slowly.After the first time, I swore I wouldn't come back bc we (table of 2) waited for our food for over 50 minutes. Another table (table of 4) got seated after us and left before we got our food...my eyes and stomach probably simultaneously combusted. We asked the waitress to check on our food, and she did twice. And when she walked by us the third time, she looked as exasperated as we felt, staring at the empty table. She was very apologetic and attentive, but we were just SOOOO hungry. Food was fine. I got a salmon burger, and my friend got a regular burger. They put chips on top on the fries.Fast forward a month later. Every brunch place and its mom has a line, so we (table of 2) decide to give this place another try. Should've been warned off by the lack of line during prime Sunday brunch time. Table of 4 gets seated next to us, order is taken after ours, but we manage to get our food just as they're mid-meal. They still leave before us. I felt bad for staring at their food so longingly, but that's just a classic Harold move. Again, asked waitress to check on our food after we see the table next to us get their food, probably a half hour wait at this point, and she says, with a little snark ""Everything just takes a few minutes, but I'll check on it."" Minutes that I just stare at other people's food. But she gets the Tabasco sauce I ask for, and checks on us once our food comes. Food comes 5 minutes later after we ask.Food is average/slightly above average again. Saving grace. We both got eggs, photo attached. My friend didn't like her eggs in the Harold's Scramble (with salmon). They were a bit watery. I liked mine a lot. Potatoes are yum.",1,,

I had a short rib, and the meat is really fresh and well cooked! Servers here and nice, friendly and helpful as well! Of course price is not the lowest that you can fill in your stomach, but you are in Herald Square at NYC so it's always like that. If you are traveling in this area, definitely don't miss this!

Happy hour oysters were warm and fishy (yuck!) food took an eternity. The server stood right over us as we tipped close to nothing (reasonable in my opinion) then chucked, yes CHUCKED, our receipts at us. As we were walking out I told the manager that the service was awful and all she had to say was ""really?"".  My mind is blown.",,,

Well lit but not too bright, the place is simple and with a neat set-up. With colorful, fresh ingredients set out on the bar, I see the tender working away. A packed house, the kind waitress finds us a seat in the back. A bit close for comfort, seating is a bit intimate. NYC style, but they make it work.Their good-sized menu does include many other appetizing options, like the lobster roll and choices of burgers, other seafoods, and more. On this day however, I was in the mood for breakfast food.I choose the bacon cheesy grits. Not too long after ordering, our food arrives and I'm pleasantly surprised at the serving size as my assumption was to expect tapas sized portions.The bacon was crunchy but not over done, they were right on point with the cheese, i added pepper and salt to my over-hard egg, and the grits were a nice texture with no chalky aftertaste.Served with a side salad that consisted of arugula and other greens, toast and some steamed red-potatoes. Well seasoned with simple ingredients, the meal didn't wow my pants off but it was definitely prepared with fresh ingredients and care.I would compare my taste-buds' experience to one I might have at a local family diner.

43,Irena S.,"Manhattan, NY",219,230,60,4.0,5/23/2017,"Stop here for a ""better breakfast"" when in the Macy's Herald Square area.  It looks upscale and often looks crowded but I was comfortably seated here for breakfast on my own one Tue morning when I had the day off and was shopping.  Service prompt and courteous.I had a simple breakfast of scrambled eggs with potatoes, toast and bacon.  Got what I expected, except just a ""little bit better"".  The eggs were scrambled perfectly sweet and creamy, which never happens.  The potatoes were fresh and soft (clearly not yesterday's roast potatoes reheated) and seasoned with fresh chopped rosemary - perfect.  Two slices of crisp quality bacon and whole wheat toast on the side.My only complaint is, at $22 with tip I wish the portions were bigger because I enjoyed the quality of the food, but I left feeling just full enough and not overstuffed, which is how you should feel so why am I complaining?  Stomach light and joyful.",4,,2
44,Heather M.,"New York, NY",35,180,822,4.0,11/5/2016,"This is a very standup restaurant. All the food that we tried was great. We were looking for a decent food spot in the Times Square area that wasn't Korean BBQ (no offense, we just wanted something diff) and it was one of the more decent places still open for food after 10:30pm. The place looks unassuming, as it's tucked away on a small island of a street, and if you don't look really well you will think it is another Irish bar. Okay so back to the food... we had the wild mushroom parpadelle, fish tacos (comes in three), and the grilled calamari. The grilled calamari comes with a mild spicy jerk rub on a bed of green leaves with olives and capers. The olives and capers complement the jerk rub very well and it was very well balanced. If you love mushrooms (like my husband) then you def should get the wild mushroom parpadelle. It's a decent size entree that won't leave you stuffed, but enough to satisfy. It comes in a mushroom/garlic sauce and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The fish tacos are battered and come with a mild small slaw. All in all everything was really great and the service was prompt and pleasant. This will definitely be a staple in my journeys through time square! PROS:- food taste fresh- good veggie options!!! - great combo of flavors and rubs- the kitchen is open late - near/next to multiple modes of transportation, so easy to get to - service is prompt and friendly CONS: - not a huge space, but they have a downstairs and a decent size upstairs dining area - hidden in Times Square*BONUS: they have a great playlist (on the Saturday night I went)... really appreciated them playing some throwback Britney Spears!",4,,1

Another server asked if it was alright and I explained I asked for medium and he says its clearly medium well... although only 1 piece had a small amount of pink on it, everything else brown. Whatever. They took it back and returned with a medium well steak. Ok. I'll take it. Except it was dropped off without silverware. Now I'm waiting for that. Dressing on the Thai salad flavorless.

Our second dish was British style fish & chips, and a house cup of coffee.Quality of food: decent, pretty, and interesting. The poached eggs were perfect, but the fries aka chips were a bit on the soft side (instead of the crisp outer shell I prefer). Interestingly, the mashed peas for the fish & chips had crushed mint in it which was a fun touch!Environment: cozy, rustic, with metal elements. The wait: arrived at 11:30 on a Sunday morning and only waited 5-10 minutes. Brunch traffic is definitely not over congested here!Price range: $14-18 per brunch dish",,,

I actually asked the waiter if it was supposed to be like that, and they said yes so I sucked it up and ate it. The second time I shared the eggs on short rib hash and the challah French toast with bananas and hazelnut butter. These were SO much better. My absolute favorite is definitely the short rib - it was rich, flavorful, unique, and pretty much perfection. Would order again. French toast was soft and fluffy, super satisfying for anyone with a sweet tooth.I could see myself coming back just because it's so convenient, and there's a ton of seating so there's rarely a wait even for weekend brunch.

Business cards ar available for grabs.For Her:Shrimp Cocktail $18.00 - too much mint embedded in the sauce but jumbo size fresh quality shrimps Strawberry Fields $14.00 - vodka, fresh lemon, strawberries & Prosceco.  This is my favorite of the night which is refreshing and nice.The New Go-To $13.00 -organic cucumber vodka, elderflower liqueur, fresh lime, pineapple juice.  Cucumber tasted weird, undesirable and not to be requested again but surely to avoid.New York Sour $13.00 - bourbon, fresh lemon, orange & red wine.  Enticing.For Him:BudweiserThe Harold $14.00 - gin, elderflower liqueur, fresh lemon, basil & Prosecco Dolores $14.00 - tequila, chartreuse, Yuzu agave, fresh lime",9,5,13

Away from rush, nice music, attentive service. It took about 10-15 minutes for our food and we both enjoyed our dishes. Their pino goes so well with steak.Bathrooms are well equipped and clean.

We were not shocked at the menu prices, as we asked for an upscale breakfast place.  I had the delicious Wild Mushroom Scramble.  The eggs were smooth, creamy almost - the way I like it cooked. It had the delicate flavors of mushroom and goat cheese.  The roasted potatoes were not typical; they tasted fresh & with a rosemary flavor.  My dish also had a small side of greens and slices of a nutty, grain toast. BF ordered The Harold-  a breakfast dish aptly named after the restaurant.  It is a scramble with smoked salmon, chives and creme fraiche, side of roasted potatoes, small greens and toast. We were both pleased and satiated with our order choices.  Our service was at a level that we felt it was a good balance of not being ignored and not being too intrusive.

100,Lynsey H.,"London, United Kingdom",216,448,2742,4.0,7/30/2015,My friend and I came here when looking for something nearby to Macy's. The Harold had a nice look so we gave it a go. The decor is really nice with lots of hats on the wall. We sat upstairs and it was great as there aren't many tables up there so it wasn't too noisy. It was 'brunch' time so I had French toast with Nutella and caramelised banana. My friend had the lobster roll. I really enjoyed the French toast and it was a decent portion. I thought the lobster roll was a bit pricey at $20. I would return here if in the area.,1,,
101,Becky V.,"Bronx, NY",0,5,0,4.0,6/21/2018,"Service is great and the food is delicious. Signature drink ordered is 'The Harold' and it's quite refreshing. Fish Tacos are absolutely AMAZING! Francisco is very hospitable and makes great suggestions. I have had the lobster risotto, Denver steak and the branzino. All 3 dishes are fantastic! This place is great for brunch and wonderful for dinner. The Harold is one of my favorite restaurants in this area! It's definitely worth a shot if you haven't tried it yet.",,,
102,Mihael K.,"New York, NY",102,447,1007,3.0,10/2/2016,"The location is nice. Perfect for when you have some extra time to kill before a train, but it gets crowded fairly quickly. The prices are what you'd expect of the area, but the wine list is a bit mediocre and it would be nice if the wine was served in stemmed wine glasses as the stemless ones, while contemporary, cause the wine to be warmed too fast.I would come here more often if there was more of a diverse and interesting wine selection. I do give them props for the Assyrtiko they used to have. It appears to be gone by a glance at their online menu, though.",,,

Food was good. Service was fine. We both ordered an iced tea. Came full of ice and not much tea in a small stemless wine glass. Our waitress offered us each another iced tea, which we accepted. When we got the bill we were charged $24 for 4 iced teas. $6 EACH. I questioned and she said there were no free refills and that she did not make the rules, but was very happy to run our credit cards for payment. I told her ""you should have told us"" to which she shrugged it off. There are much better places in the area, and certainly places that do not charge $24 for 4 small iced teas chocked full of ice. Avoid this restaurant and their price gouging! We had: French onion soup, cobb salad (no meat), a small green salad, fish and chips, and iced tea and our bill was well over $100 with tip. Ridiculous",2,,

After seeing that most places in the area weren't open yet or were swamped, this seemed like a good choice.We were able to grab a seat at the bar quickly and amazingly each downed a bloody mary and a brunch entree in less than 40 minutes from when we walked in, which was great since we were in a rush. The food seemed consistent, good, and decently priced. The other people at the bar were extremely nice and the staff were enjoyable to be around. Overall, they're not pushing the boundaries with their food at all but it's a reliable spot to grab a bite or drink when in Herald Square for me now.",1,1,1

For breakfast, try the Harold scramble. What a great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner - we tried all three!",,,1
114,Elianny S.,"Astoria, NY",155,353,1310,4.0,12/31/2016,"We came here on Christmas day since this was one of the few places that was open. We were there around 3pm and it seemed that most of the other diners were ordering brunch/breakfast food.  I'm normally not a fan of ""normal"" breakfast items but when I kept seeing the french toast it just looked really delicious so I went with that and a side of bacon. Being that we were truly starving I was also tempted by the burger, since I just love burgers! Thankfully we decided to order a burger to share along with the french toast. Not sure if it was because we were genuinely starving but it seemed that the food took quite long to arrive.  At one point we were all just staring at the bus boys walking past us with food, praying that it was ours. After what seemed like an eternity, our food arrived! I was so happy to see my beautiful french toast, crispy bacon and the burger! I didn't even know where to begin, by I went with the burger.  First impression of the burger was that it was overcooked, I like my meat medium rare or practically rare. This burger was medium heading to the well done. However despite the overlooking the flavor and quality of the meat waso very good.  The french fries that come with it were great. I love french fries and these were really good. After stuffing myself with the burger/fries, it was time for the French toast. It was super sweet and made for a perfect dessert. The food here was definitely good, service was very slow but then again it was Christmas so perhaps they were understaffed. This is a great option if you're in the area and not in the mood for Korean food.",2,1,2

Lastly, I drink iced tea, and I think just like anyone else who drinks it, drinks several glasses before finishing their meal. Why would you charge by the glass????? Honestly, a big pet peeve for me- it's not like it's being served out of a bottle but from a bag that probably cost the restaurant $2 and makes 60 glasses.",,,

Their location is right outside the NQR and Path stations at herald square.  They have a bar as you enter and two floors of seating.  Surprisingly we didn't have to wait for a table of four on a sunny Saturday at 12PM, prime brunch time!  That was nice. :)I enjoyed the pistachio pancakes at first. It is sprinkled with pistachio bits on top, giving it a nice crunchy flavor as you take each bite.  However, each individual pancake underneath started to taste bland. It seemed like all the flavor was on the top of the stack, and I needed to use maple syrup to get through the other pancakes.  I got tired of the taste eventually.

It had, of course, been on my list for awhile, and I'm rebuilding my categories of bookmarks, but this one I remembered off the top of my head for being a place I knew I wanted to go. Nestled in the heart of Herald Square with a beautiful view, it's surprisingly good for a place in such a good location. Working in the Touristville that is Midtown, you know that lots of these places use their location as a crutch for the lackluster food they serve, but this place brings good food along with their central location. The space is a little rustic, cozy and chic with a small loft space upstairs. The feel of the space is like you're dining in your stylish bohemian friend's apartment. The food is amazing. Nothing generic about this menu. It was a desperately difficult choice for what to have and pretty much every entree is under $30. Definitely a win there. Duck isn't on a menu everywhere, so it was a pretty easy choice. The duck confit was topped with a thin slice of duck prosciutto, something I've never had. Instead of peppery arugula, the greens to brighten up the dish were fresh mint leaves. The texture of the creamy, rich, spaetzle contrasted against walnuts and pomegranate. The whole thing felt like a non-clichéd version of fall. Rich and comforting, but with warmth and brightness. Throw in a pretty good craft beer selection on tap and in bottles and a lovely server, it was a great meal to start our weekend.",2,,1

But once you're put away from the window, it seems a bit...dim, which makes me super gloomy and tired because the lights they use are yellow. No thanks!Food is not amazing, but it's decent. I got the avocado swiss wrap the first time, and it was yummy! But the second time I went, for some reason, the wrap was MUCH smaller than what it used to be, which obviously made me like = =; The staff is nice, but not as attending as I hope they would be.

Nothing I'd go terribly out of my way for, but a decent option in a busy part of town that typically filled with fast food options or the usual hot dog cart on the sidewalk.

I ordered a Dutch baby pancake, while my friends ordered a burger and egg benedict. My Dutch baby was served in a pan, topped with baked apple slices and berries and came with a side of whipped cream. It was quite yummy, not too sweet and not too heavy. It was somewhat missing the ""poppy-ness"" of a Dutch pancake I was used to, but I enjoyed it otherwise. The service was quite slow, despite not being busy.

It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive. The tuna salad was served with slimy greens, questionable tuna, not fresh at all and yellow beans. The panini Sandwich was so soggy it was inedible with burnt fries. This would explain why there  was no one in there.

After perusing the menu, I settled on the hazelnut apple french toast, which ended up being a great choice. My sister had the eggs benedict with lobster which she was very happy with. The portions were generous and everything was cooked perfectly. The restaurant only uses organic free range eggs, which is a huge plus in my book, and french toast and pancakes are served with genuine Vermont maple syrup.As I mentioned before, our waitress was warm and friendly and she was patient when we asked her to take a few pictures of us. The hostess and the bus boys were also very kind. The interior of the restaurant is warm yet trendy with exposed brick, lots of wood, and cool light fixtures.

Not as upscale as Petit Poulet or Statler Grill, but nicer than surrounding fast food. Easy stop coming on or off a train. Always a crowd, but never crowded. Very few times when I couldn't get a table right off. Nice ambience. Good decor. Something for all menu with a lil' flare in each entree without going crazy gourmet. Menu updates seasonally. Prices are fair for menu and locale. Again, between fast food and finer dining. Great bar staff who can be creative when asked. Several tenured wait staff who can help w choice and happy to answer questions for other things in the neighborhood. It is not the most amazing restaurant in NYC, but 5 stars because it is knows what it is and isn't and is the right type of place for it's location. Solid choice for any meal at any time.",,,

I ordered the Harold Scramble ($15) with a friend and the other two in my party ordered the Salmon Platter ($18). We had expected the portions to be large enough for two people to share, but unlike other brunch places with this price tag, there was barely enough for two people to share. The food was presented well, and was overall tasty. However, the price tag is too high for the portions. My friends who ordered the salmon platter asked for another bagel which was outrageously priced as an additional $6.Overall, taste and atmosphere is good, but does not warrant the price.",,,
158,Aimee B.,"Baltimore, MD",95,120,0,3.0,7/23/2017,"ducked into the harold while exploring mid town and really enjoyed our lunch. food was great as was the service, although like a poster before me - we were astonished to see that a simple ice tea was 6 dollars each (no free re-fills). it's just silly and will be the one of the things we remember above all else when telling others about the dining during our trip.",1,,2
159,Tim L.,"Long Island City, New York, NY",106,1123,125,3.0,6/17/2015,"The Harold is all about appearance and service. It's great on both these points.  A cozy spot amidst the hustle and bustle of Harold Square it's a nice reprieve from a long day of shopping.Unfortunately what might appear to be great food, falls a little short when it comes to taste.  The cocktails while healthy portioned tend to be a bit on the weaker side.Overall though there's nothing wrong with the place, however at the prices they're commanding for drinks, starters and entrees. It's not really worth it.",,,

164,Clare H.,"New York, NY",369,56,130,4.0,5/1/2016,"A solid 4 stars! This review is based on my bar experience (yes it was quite a story!). Food review will be provided after another visit.The Harold is located in the hearts of Manhattan right before you enter Korea town. It's huge restaurant logo will definitely capture your attention and pique your interest. I always walked past this establishment every time I visited ktown but never get the chance to try this place out. I was in ktown on a weeknight for dinner and wanted to find a chill spot for some drinks and cocktails. At the very same moment, my friend's phone was the verge of dying - we were looking for a place that provides an outlet so he can charge his phone. We walked in and asked the bartender whether they have an extra charger, but unfortunately no one does.While we were disappointed and about to leave, the bartender suggested us to stop by Duane Reade to buy a charger and they wouldn't mind us charging our phone by the bar if we come back. We thanked the bartender for his gratitude and went to purchase a charger then return to the Harold to charge my friend's phone. Of course, we used that time to order two glasses of wine while waiting for the phone to juice up.I really enjoyed that spontaneous phone-charing experience at the Harold that evening. The bartender was super friendly and accommodating with our request (normally bars have the right to refuse phone charging requests) and even began to chat with us about various things. We are so thankful and happy that we stumbled upon a nice spot near ktown with such great service! Next time I will come back and try out their food options!",,1,
165,Dave R.,"Jersey City, NJ",966,88,0,5.0,11/15/2016,"I loved my experience here. First of all the food was wonderful I had salmon and a side order of grilled asparagus  and my companion had calamari and a cobb salad-  and we agreed everything was excellent.Beverage wise I had hot decaf coffee which was hot and fresh- and my friend's   ""virgin mary""  was made with great care and  real ingredients. Second of all - location . Located on W 32 between Broadway & 6th  ave - it is super convenient  and very warm and clean.Third - the service  was wonderful. Eden,our server was gracious,asked great questions to make sure that we got what we  wanted- and  reflected her  and the place's basic premise that they had great stuff for us and were glad we were there.All in all #timewellspent.",,,

The atmosphere is very cozy and rustic, and there's an upstairs and downstairs seating area so the wait is never long. I've had the salmon sandwich and chicken sandwich here, and they were both very good. I also like how they mix chips and french fries with the entrees- it's something unique.Would recommend this place!",1,,

169,Reviewer A.,"New York, NY",87,158,6,2.0,12/6/2014,"Updated Review as of 1/30/2015Went back with several girlfriends. We were celebrating a birthday and were in the mood to spend money and order lots of stuff. We all ordered wine...a teeny tiny portion of it came out (almost looked like the amount they would give at a wine tasting), we all couldn't believe our eyes. Then for starters, we ordered the assortment of dips and calamari. There were about 8 small calamari rings and dips were teeeeeeeeeeeeny tiny--soo not worth the money. I asked if they can substitute some ingredients in the two salads I was going to order and charge me as much money as they wanted to. The waiter warned us ""the chef is a major douche, so that's probably not going to happen, but I'll find out for you""...as promised, he returned and shook his head, saying, the chef said no...really? you can't add a few olives and avocado to a raw salad AND charge me $10 if you need to....The chef must be on some powertrip, it's not like some fine dining experience where those ingredients would absolutely ruin his secret recipe. We ordered fries, and again a tiny portion came out.Finally, I ordered some dessert for the birthday girl and the waiter asked, how do you spell her name so that we could write it on the plate...like an idiot, i proceeded to spell it out, only to discover that dessert arrived sans candle or her name.The bill was high too.I guess this turned into a tourist trap. Wouldn't return and don't recommend. Sad turn of events for what I hoped was a promising place. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This place is such a gem! Finally, they built something that's made for locals, not so much for tourists. The menu is great, ingredients are fresh. Portions are generous. Service is good. Love their salads, and sides of asparagus. Perfect spot for meetings and lunches with coworkers.",4,3,3
170,Elizabeth T.,"Oklahoma City, OK",1,7,1,5.0,10/1/2016,"We ran into this little bistro just walking around in Manhattan. The Skinny: Little bistro with fancy (ish) dishes on an affordable price set for singles or couples. I wouldn't say it's affordable if you're trying to feed say, 4 or 5 people unless you're dividing the check. For two of us, appetizer, two entrees and a Diet Coke each - $60. The Good: Everything. The meal was fantastic. Fried (crispy) Calamari was perfectly done and the sauce served with was excellent. The servers bring you a large glass bottle of water that serves the table, but I think they refill the bottle each time - kind of an eclectic take on the old fashioned pitchers servers used to carry around. My entree - the lobster roll with fries was easily the freshest thing to cross my lips in a long time. The texture of the lobster was perfect. Not chewy or tough. My wife got a burger - she's so fancy :) - and it was made right to order. Not over or under done either way. She agrees that this was easily in the top 3 places we ate on our weekend.The Bad: Uh, well... not really anything. It's a tight squeeze to sit, but this is Manhattan. If you're trying to squeeze in there with a Hoveround or scooter, I'm not entirely sure it's going to work out for you. When we were there they had a large, long table, so given that it's empty, I'm sure they can accommodate a large group but if I had a few kids, I'd skip it and head somewhere more family friendly. The End: Honeymoon, first date, last date, all dates, or just a quick bite alone or with a couple friends - this is your spot. Food and ambiance is great. Leave the kids at home.",,,
171,Alexa L.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,1,0,5.0,10/24/2017,"This place is great. I've been for breakfast and lunch.  The eggs Benedict with potatoes was delicious, and I noticed a few other dishes people ordered that looked great as well.  The fish tacos were good too, I think they are an appetizer so they were a smaller portion. The prices are very reasonable (especially for breakfast, unsure about dinner prices) and it's a really cute place inside and relatively spacious for nyc!  If you're in the Macy's/herald square area and looking for a place to eat, I'd definitely recommend eating here.  It's right across from the entrance to the path train to NJ and also multiple subway lines (BDFM and NQRW) which is very convenient.",,,
172,Jay B.,"Warner Robins, GA",1,35,12,4.0,12/20/2015,"The Harold gets a solid 4-stars for pub fare done well. My only criticism was that the host predicted a 10 min wait for a table and it ended up being nearly 30 mins - possibly b/c my name slipped off the list somehow. This issue aside, our experience at The Harold was a good one.The menu is largely standard pub fare - nothing particularly creative or out of the ordinary - but what we ordered was done well. I had the seafood pasta, which was cooked al dente and there was a generous amount of seafood in the pasta. The sauce was light and complemented the seafood very nicely. My dining companion had the steak fritte, which was cooked as per her order (a true medium rare). We finished our meal with the cheesecake and creme brûlée. Both were tasty, nicely presented, and hit the spot.",2,,

174,Jazzy J.,"ROXBURY CROSSING, MA",580,36,9,3.0,3/14/2016,"This place was very CHIC - Loved IT!!!! The food was very good! I was so satisfied with the food, I went back for more. The first time I arrived I ordered the 'Eggs Any Style' (Scrambled with Spinach YUM!) with applewood smoked bacon. The Menu did not state that home fires were included but I did not mind they were Delish!! The home fries were well seasoned baked cut up red potato's. The kind you make at home but would want to get paid for. The second time I arrived I got the Blueberry Pancakes with ricotta lemon cream - OMG!!! This was soooo good.. it was really the toppings that made the pancakes for me. It was literally like an explosion of sweet and tartness in my mouth!What I DID NOT LIKE - The seating. There's enough seating in the place, but they packed us in right on top of another table. Not sure why...The guy was super nice, and kind of cute so it gave us an excuse to talk to him, but we were a little too close for comfort overall.Other then that the waitstaff was GREAT. The food was OK. & The place was spotless!!!",,1,
175,Brian M.,"Flushing, NY",455,25,0,2.0,12/29/2015,"I really want to cut this place slack for being in Herald Square but since I had to choose between 2 and 3 I am choosing the lower grade because I will not be going back. First off, they jam patrons into tiny tables at the front of the restaurant that are so close together you literally have to pull the table out to get in. I saw other couples decline to sit- I should have done that.Secondly, the food was underwhelming and the drinks were weak relative to their price. The service was fine and the decor is actually quite nice -- but being less than a foot from the person next to me and lackluster food ruined the experience. Overall, no reason to return.",1,1,

178,Liza P.,"New York, NY",468,65,184,4.0,4/7/2015,"I work close by so I've been meaning to come here for a while. Their cocktails are really good here. Choose the Basil cocktail if you like gin. It's a bit sweet but it's uber fresh. Started off with the lobster mac and cheese. It was okay. Very cheesy with the top crusted. Only complaint is that there were bacon bits in it. I know I'm going to get some heat for hating on bacon, but personally I don't love bacon in my mac and cheese. I expected more lobster flavor in the ""lobster mac and cheese"", but the bacon flavor overpowered it. As a main my friend got the tuna steak which he really liked. The presentation was clean and unexpectedly nice.I got the mussels in a beer butter sauce. At first the pot that it comes in intimidated me because it looks like a lot. However, the mussels are in the shell so the amount turned out to be just enough. The beer butter sauce is to die for. It is what is keeping this review a 4 star. The fries that come with it were just normal thin cut fries- nothing spectacular. I would say it's a nice place to go to when you want to chill around Herald Square and you're not really feeling Korean food. (As it is right by Ktown)",,,

186,Patty M.,"Henderson, NV",210,56,7,1.0,7/20/2015,"Rude management, horrible food, terrible customer service!Had to walk up two flights of stairs to get to our table. Table was sticky and disgusting. The air was stale with a faint smell of a combination of dirty mop water and urine. Not nearly enough air conditioning - and I'm usually cold. So for me to be hot, it must be sweltering. I ordered GARGANELLI PRIMAVERA described as house made pasta,local corn, summer peas, asparagus, house-made ricotta. What I got was a meager portion of over cooked penne, a few peas, MAYBE a teaspoon of microscopic asparagus , not a hint of corn or ricotta. There was a tablespoon of some flavorless white sauce was sitting on the bottom of the dish. They must have run it through a de-flavoring machine because it had ZERO flavor. The guys ordered the house burgers (at $18 a pop). Described as applewood bacon, aged cheddar, & grilled onions on a brioche bun. served with fries. In reality it was a slab of the cheapest chopped meat, no bacon, no onions, a small bit of cheese. Presentation was very nice. Taste, not so much. My son called it forgettable. For 18 bucks, you'd expect something spectacular. My son, who never wastes food, threw out his left overs. I sent my pasta back. No apology from the server. I noticed he brought the returned dish to the manager. I went downstairs to address the situation and the manager shot me the meanest, dirtiest look so I skipped the confrontation. I walked toward the restrooms and the manager appeared in front of me, blocking my way and said ""can I help you""? I told him I was going to use the bathroom and he said ""they're for customers"". I reminded him we were seated upstairs and he said ""oh yeah, you. You didn't eat"". Seriously? He finally stepped aside and let me pass. This is an overpriced, pretentious, dump masquerading as an upscale cafe. You can do far better at any one of the nearby restaurants or go across the street to the food kiosks for some good cheap eats.",4,4,1

Updated review","I was a bit overenthusiastic with my previous review because I was blinded by the amazing oysters. I've been here about 5 or 6 times now and have tried a large number of things on the menu to say that the food here is terrible. I've never had any issues with the service here, and I love the decor and ambiance, but it is so unfortunate that there is nothing good about the food. Flavors are bland or poorly cooked. Prices are way too high for the small portions. I still come back due to convenience, but I really hope this place improves soon. Also, I'm not sure if it's due to the timing of when I come here, (I've been here early and late in the evening) I've realized the portions of the food, though still small, sometimes vary a bit. I recall ordering the skewers twice and the first time I had only about 5 or 6 skewers? Second time I had it there were 8 with pretty much the same amount of meat on each skewer. I didn't ask about it since there were more the second time but I hope there was a change to make it 8 each time!",,,
