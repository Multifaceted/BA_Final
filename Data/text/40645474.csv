Coffee is still diner light roast but that's ok.This locals spot is close to Lincoln center but feels worlds away and a wholesome feel good spot for breakfast or lunch and is family friendly. This diner manages to have the charm of old school but is above average in the diner category.",5,2,4
1,Mrs L.,"Castro Valley, CA",2,40,15,5.0,8/2/2018,"Loved our lunch today!We left the studio audience of the Kelly & Ryan show, went to the Apple store to fix a phone, and needed to eat lunch asap! We walked over to a brunchy bakery place near John's, and it just didnt look appetizing at all. As we walked back toward Apple store we stumbled upon this little neighborhood gem. If we wouldve blinked, we wouldve missed it. My daughter got the chicken alfredo. It was served super hot with a salad on the side. She loved it. I got the tuna salad sandwich on a roll with sweet potato fries.  It was perfect. Im not gonna lie: I ate the whole thing.The service was excellent and friendly.  Total was $29 something for the both of us. For a sit-down lunch in NYC, $30 for two is a pretty good value.",,,
2,Hannah T.,"New York, NY",205,62,155,4.0,7/31/2018,"There's just something about Old John's that's special. Yes, it's another NYC diner. Everything is a little bit sticky; there are white paper placemats; and, the seating can be a bit crammed. BUT I love it. There's friendly service and decent prices here.Lunch specials are $11-13 and rather filling. (I'm a fan of the Rueben) The burgers are a good size as well. I've gotten a sundae and a Belgian waffle topped with ice cream, and both were good. I haven't tried any of the dinner entrees, but I've had good lunch experiences here.If you're visiting Lincoln Center/the Upper West Side and are looking for financially feasible options that aren't a food truck, I would recommend Old John's.",,,

4,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,3.0,12/21/2017,"It seems like one steps back into time upon entering this diner/luncheonette.I stopped by for a quick bite to eat, since it seems to be hard to find decent eateries in this area that will not cost you an arm and a leg. First, I really appreciated that the restaurant had multiple sandwich options for lunch that were well priced. Unfortunately, I may have selected the wrong sandwich. I ordered the grill chicken sandwich and it was pretty bland and dry. Food aside, the service was quite wonderful.",,,
5,Neil B.,"Brooklyn, NY",575,983,1097,4.0,1/7/2018,"Old John's Luncheonette is a classic, old time (like me?) NYC diner with friendly staff (and as I observed, customers) and mediocre to above average diner food. I took my aunt here for her 88th birthday breakfast. I live in Brooklyn but as a vetern UWS resident, she knew and had been here before and was happy to dine here again!We visited on a freezing cold Sunday (today!) so at 11:45 AM we were still able to sit right down which I surmise is not usually the case because prices are affordable and their old time atmosphere is difficult to find because of the soaring rents and gentrification.I had cornbeef hash, poached eggs and an English muffin. The hash was  too salty but cooked well done per my request, the poached eggs were cooked just right so the yolks were still runny and the English muffin was a bit undertoasted. Also I had assumed that because I had asked for the hash to be cooked very well done, that they would have also cooked the homefries well done, but I guess next time I will have to ask for each entree.My auntie had scrambled eggs with lox. The lox was a bit salty (not Nova Scotia I assume) but she liked it just fine. They were happy to substitute melon for the homefries (which I should have done but sometimes on a cold day, you just need homefries!They are a little slow refilling coffee but it is good diner coffee and when you ask for more, they are happy to pour!The restaurant was quite cold - especially the bathroom - but everywhere was very clean.Prices are reasonable and they accept credit cards",7,4,6

9,Lindsay F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",28,41,21,4.0,3/31/2018,"This is a diner. You get what a classic diner comes with. Quick service. Not always the most attentive. Pretty good food with a large variety of items on the menu. If you don't have extremely large expectations then you won't be disappointed. It's cheap and you get a good amount of food. I have had breakfast and lunch here and both cases I've been satisfied. It'll be the closest to home cooking you can get without breaking the bank. Sometimes the waiters aren't as attentive but just make the effort to get their attention if you need ""a little more ___"" or ""a side of ____"". Know all that you need beforehand so you can order it up front. The coffee mugs are always kept full which is most important on some mornings.",2,3,2

I love the waffles with coffee ice cream and the eggs Benedict but honestly from the many times I've been here with many friends who've ordered probably the whole menu by now, every dish is awesome.

The place was packed/busy but service was very good and the food and coffee were excellent. Thanks very much.",,,
12,Betsy L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,4.0,7/23/2017,"This is a throwback to another time and I can't believe it's still here with the soaring rents and brand naming so prevalent on the UWS. The food here is classic old school diner and will never win any James Beard awards. The space has no design sensibility beyond comfortable serviceability. But it gets 4 enthusiastic stars from me because the wait staff remembers your favorite order even when you haven't been back in months. Because it feels like your Iowa grandma made the same tuna melt and pea soup for you when you were home sick with the flu. Because the twosome booths are the perfect size for you and your friend and the cushions are uncracked and bouncy. It's always bustling but there's never a wait for a lunchtime table during the work week. The milkshakes will remind you of your childhood. This diner is the physical embodiment of comfort food. Nothing to write home about, maybe, but sometimes exactly what you need.",1,,
13,Antoine L.,"New York, NY",48,107,0,5.0,12/23/2017,"Do you like breakfast and good old fashioned American comfort food? Do you like sitting in a diner for awhile, either in a cozy booth or at the counter, having your coffee refilled over and over while reading the paper, perhaps while waiting for a show at Lincoln Center or discussing the film or concert you have just seen? Do you appreciate a laminated breakfast special menu with cheap egg sandwiches or a complete french toast, bacon, and coffee or ham n eggs, home fries and toast with coffee (FREE REFILLS)  for under ten bucks? Do you resent stepping into some ridiculous gentrifier outpost or Lincoln Center chain restaurant ripoff with 8 dollar ONE EGG breakfast sandwiches, 4 dollar cups of bitter coffee WITHOUT REFILLS and do it yourself service and bussing without any comfortable seating? If you have answered YES to any or all of these questions then it is time for you to step inside your friendly neighborhood Old John Luncheonette and let the lovely staff therein take care of you.

14,Lawrence H.,"Civic Center, Manhattan, NY",1,4,0,2.0,4/7/2017,"I would prefer to give 2.5 stars, but I cannot give 3 because of an inconsistent dining experience. I've lived above Old John's for 4 years now and because of the lack of food choices have eaten here for breakfast, lunch and dinner more than I'd care to admit. The experience can be really good. For example the chicken pot pie, eggs and corn beef, and the gentleman who listens to smooth jazz and works the counter at night. However, it can also be really poor. For example dirty water glasses, incorrect food or drinks delivered, waiting for ketchup when you ordered Fries. This issues are more common during lunch time. My friends actually make fun of me for coming here and say I'm in love with Old John. Due to the inconsistency I think it's about time I succumb to the ridicule and go to another diner up the road.",3,1,2

Breakfast is served all day with hearty full portions. There are healthy options available, not just a typical diner style heavy meals. Two had lunch and I heard the chicken soup was one of the best ever. They do have a liquor license here so you might add a mimosa or a Bloody Mary to your brunchy type meal. Jeeze now I wish I had thought of that dinner! Service was fine- that warmer you are the more they open up. They are efficient and obviously they have their regulars whom are treated especially well!

Terrible attitude from the staff, also while I waited on my card to be processed, the same man witnessed a drunk homeless guy that was drinking at the same counter harassing me and could care less.

While there was no line to be seated and plenty of open tables, we stood at the front of the small establishment for just under 10 minutes waiting for someone to seat us. I tried the salmon benedict which resembled catnip out of a can. It was neon pink with burnt edges and the english muffin it was resting on, had clearly been left in the toaster two minutes too long (also crispy black). It was somewhat overpriced and certainly underwhelming... not to mention the dog that laid on the floor next to me licking my shoe.",2,,

33,Justin Y.,"Washington, DC",779,342,81,4.0,12/2/2014,"It's not the best brunch place in the world, but especially around the neighborhood that it's in, it's a great homey diner that you really can't find elsewhere in NYC. Especially at that price.Originally was planning to go to Calle Ocho, but, for all the New Yorkers, we all know that's a ""drunch"" spot. My friends and I were all nursing a hangover so we decided to skip it and go somewhere a little less loud and a little more calm. I found this place on the Google (I love that phrase) because of its relatively cheap meals.It's a small establishment, maybe fits 25ish people? That sounds like a lot (esp compared to ACTUAL small places like Totto) but the layout of the restaurant is in small boxed booths, giving you and your company your own intimate space. The menu is not overbearing and has all of your classic favorites that you would expect at a diner.I ordered the corned beef hash and while it was phenomenal, I thought I got what I paid for. Two of my friends ordered the French Toast and I must say, they didn't look nearly as appetizing as the pictures already on Yelp. It looked like the bread was made from the baguettes, but they said it tasted fine so I guess that's all that really matters.If you're looking for no frills, cheap, and simple, this is your spot. You won't find anything more chill than Old John's near Columbus Circle.",1,1,

I ordered the beef burger (comes on a sesame bun) with cheddar cheese (+$1.00), bacon (+$1.00), lettuce, and tomato. The burger comes with a pickle and coleslaw. They're VERY generous with the cheddar cheese (wonderfully melty) and bacon. The coleslaw tastes like the delicious coleslaw from KFC. I also got a side of fries, since they were delivered, they were a little soggy by the time they got to me, perhaps I'll order them well done next time. The projected delivery time of 10-20 minutes was accurate and my delivery guy was very polite. Overall, the food was exactly what I wanted and I will be a repeat customer.",1,,1

50,Anouska B.,"Boston, MA",63,107,108,2.0,3/27/2012,"Not terrible, not worth revisiting either.Found this place while perusing Yelp during a girlie weekend on the UWS. We wanted a quick breakfast and we wanted it NOW.They have a large bakery selection, and are quick to fill up your coffee. There was only one waiter in the whole joint, but the whole joint was the size of a... joint, and there were only another two customers. Toast, eggs, OJ, pastries, and coffee, for two, came to a grand total of $25. Maybe that's expensive for the variety of places available in NYC, but it didn't burn a hole in my pocket either.I really can't remember how good/bad the food was. I really can't remember more than how quick they were to fill up my coffee. So maybe that's the problem with this tiny diner, a few blocks north of the the Lincoln Center: it's forgettable.I've already forgotten why I chose to write this review.",2,2,2

So I'll go a little into detail as to ""what it is."" When you first walk in, you find a cute, clean, A-graded diner. I was there around 10:30am for breakfast and it was almost full with no wait, which is the best sign for me. I know people are eating, but I don't have to waste time in a cramped waiting area to get down to chowing.There's a tiny, full bar by the entrance which does not fit in the old-fashioned diner decor, and I'm curious to know what kind of people come here for a cocktail. First aid kit is right next to the kahlua. That might be a hint.The waiter was friendly and funny. And (here's where the ""what it is"" comes in) the waiter was honest. My husband ordered pancakes. Safe. I wanted to really try something. I'm a risk taker. So I asked what was better, the corned beef and hash or the eggs benedict. The waiter replied that the corned beef was a lot like what you get out of the can (which means IS from a can, yeah?). ""So the eggs benedict...is that really good?"" He nodded. Not passionately. More like a head tilt and single nod.So I ordered coffee and eggs benedict, because nothing says ""order it"" like a lukewarm review from the waiter.The coffee was good. Diner coffee. Not gourmet. Don't expect more than COFFEE. But do expect a consistently full cup and a good, warm, liquid complement to the food.The pancakes were gorgeously fluffy and delicious. The eggs benedict was pretty good. The hollandaise sauce was a bit lemony for my taste. I'm very picky about hollandaise sauce. Maybe because the waiter wasn't glowing, I was expecting ""eh"" and got better than that. If he had said ""it's the best thing you'll ever eat."" I likely would have punched him on the way out, so he did a great job of putting me in the perfect frame of mind for what we got.The bill for two breakfasts, oj, and coffee was $22.00. In the upper west side, that can't be beat.I will be coming back. The waiter is A+ in my book and the food works for a lazy Sunday morning.",3,3,1

Updated review","Okay, I have to reduce this star rating to 3 stars, because besides the burger, I don't really like anything else.  My boyfriend ordered pancakes from them once and they were so dry and disappointing.  We also got buffalo wings once and they were more like chicken wings in marinara sauce.Overall, I can only love Old John's for the burger and the fast friendly service.  They need to up the ante on the quality of the rest of their food though.",1,1,1
80,Ian R.,"Long Island City, NY",29,116,1,4.0,6/1/2007,"Old John's would get 3 stars if it were anywhere else in the city.  The difference is that this cute little Luncheonette is located in the culinary vacuum that is the Lincoln Center area.   If you are going to see the opera/ballet/philharmonic, and you want to get a bite to eat that doesn't come from a buffet tray or at the expense of your first born, Old John's is pretty much the only game around.  That being said, Old John's really is quite a nice place.  The food is of good quality the service is friendly and the decor is actually quite nice.  I'm particularly keen on the meat loaf.  So, the next time you're in Lincoln Center and you get a hankering for some food, stop in, like you have a choice anyway.",5,3,1
81,Gabe S.,"Chicago, IL",42,87,0,1.0,9/9/2007,"I live on the same block as Old John's Luncheonette and just like Jenny Pear B., when I moved to New York, I was thrilled at the thought of having a coffee shop near my apartment to have it be my second home or a place to meet friends.  Two years later, rather than stop in every week or so, I have been exactly 3 times (once for dinner, one time for pickup, one time breakfast) and have always left disappointed.  The only reason I have been there more than once is because of the desire to have a good coffee shop by my house so badly and hoping that I had misjudged it before.To be clear, It does have a beautiful atmosphere - tablecloths and a cozy red decor, the prices are on par with other coffee shops, but what makes it so dissapointing is the food.  The food is NOT GOOD.  I got sweet potato fries with my dinner, they were limp and flavorless.  For breakfast i had sausage and pancakes.  The pancakes were on the bad side of acceptable and the sausage tasted like bad grease.  It reminds me of the type of food you would find at a Denny's.   My roomates and I have had brunch at least once a month if not more often over the last two years, and when we don't want to make the 10 minute walk up to the low 80's for places like ""Good Enough to Eat"" or ""Cafe Lalo's"" (which are superb!), we go to ""The Westside Diner"" which is two blocks up on broadway, or ""The Elite Cafe"" which is on Columbus and 68th.  Both of those places are significantly better than Old John's for the same price, if not cheaper.Old John's was, sometime around May/June '07, shut down for health violations.  When this happened I saw the employees throwing out several appliances that must have been too old or dirty.  I saw them throw out an oven.  As they put it on the side of the street, i saw a mouse run out from inside it.  One of the busboys stepped on it repeatedly as it tried to run away until blood was splattered on the sidewalk and the mouse was dead.  The employees laughed, as if having a good time.A week after it was shut down, The ""new"" Old John's reopened.  At the urging of one of my roomates who, like me, yearns for a good coffee shop on our block, but, unlike me, wants to keep on giving Old John's more chances, we had breakfast there.  That is the third time I ate there, when I had the pancakes and sausage described above.I myself have decided not to eat at Old John's again, ever, if i can help it.  For me, Old John's will always conjure up images consistent with it's name: old food.",5,1,2

WIld.  Again, what goes for meat loaf, goes for the pot roast, and since I didn't mention the mashed potatoes before.... money.The ravioli are not quite in the same boat as the other two, being the most ""ethnic"" of the bunch.  Spinach pasta filled with asparagus and other goodies, very tasty, when I wasn't feeling so meaty.I think the veal marasala was decent as well.All in all, John's is about comfort foods, and it delivers.  (Figuratively and literally)",3,4,
