Saw the cocktail "" lavender girl"" on a cocktail blog and that made me bookmark and put this place on my radar. Came here on a Saturday night after having dinner in the upper Hell's Kitchen areaPlace is located next to the Dream Hotel on 55th street near 7thThank God it wasn't too crowded. We were able to grab seats at the bar. This is as around 1030/11pm ish . By the time we left- definitely- a lot of space. Inside is stylish although very dim. I liked it but downside was lighting for my fabulous photos was not that great lol. But anyway- I loved the inner decor A mix with some 80's and 90's alternative and pop played that night . Someone who loved the Pretty in Pink soundtrack definitely put the list together lol. New order, psychedelic furs , INXS etc . I enjoyed itThey serve tapas/ small bites . But I didn't try any since we just had a full Korean meal.  But I will post the menu - see photos . Now getting to the good stuff...The coasters are DOPE. Brass and ""the Rickey lounge"" on them The staff was attentive! Greeted not long after we sat down.  Sandro was our bartender and he was great. Makings of a great mixologist. Confident but not cocky... Being a cocktail connoisseur- watching him make our cocktails was a joy. He really put effort into making the cocktails. From the firm shaking ... the exactness and precision  and making the sugared rim to the garnishes.  5 star service alone! I had the Lavender Girl which I enjoyed . Gin cocktail . I also tried the Pomegranate Rickey- vodka cocktail - which I enjoyed also- the ice cube had pomegranates frozen into them. My friend had 2 Lemon drop martinis which she enjoyed as well This place is now on my favorite NYC cocktail bar list . Would definitely come back. Cheers",10,6,10
1,Lauren F.,"Boston, MA",51,283,71,3.0,11/15/2018,"This place is okay, located right next to the Dream, no 100% my cup of tea, maybe I need to give this another try.  A dark small cocktail bar, they have a large selection of VERY overpriced cocktails and wine.  We got one cocktail and one glass of wine for $50 with tip when all said and done.  The service was also just okay.For $24 my cabernet was actually not that great at all!  I was disappointed, they didn't even pour it to have me test it ahead of time, which I actually probably would have changed my mind on what I wanted if I tried it ahead of time.  My husband got a cocktail and they gave a lavish presentation and story behind it which was kind of cool, but there was very little to the drink as it was maybe 4 sips total.  I don't mind paying for a cocktail, but at least have something in the glass or water it down so there is something to sip off and enjoy.",,,
2,Andrea B.,"Los Angeles, CA",18,71,15,5.0,9/14/2018,"We stopped in here for a nightcap after dinner, and we got waaay more than we bargained for. When you first walk in, a warm scent from posh candles washes over you. It's dim and peaceful and quiet, with 80s cuts gently filling the silence. The cocktails looked like artwork -- a sculpture of herbs, liquors, purees, all placed in gorgeous glassware.Rickey's is a must-see destination for all who love an exquisite cocktail made with care.",1,,
3,John S.,"Washington, DC",42,62,312,3.0,11/14/2018,"I like the aesthetic of this place and that it wasn't too crowded and busy for a Saturday night.  Out of the three drinks that we tried, one was good and two were just okay.  I always give service the benefit of the doubt, but I actually had a pretty bad experience here.  After finishing the first drink, I spent at least 15 minutes trying to make eye contact with the bartender who didn't appear too busy.  Eventually a second bartender showed up and made drinks for the couple right next to us (who showed up after we had finished and we had been waiting).  Then both bartenders disappeared together for at least another 15 minutes.  During that time the bar back took our order.  The bartenders eventually appeared again making a couple more drinks and then finally asked us what we wanted appearing as though our order was never communicated to them.  I politely pointed out that there was a mess up and we had placed our order awhile ago already, but the bartender didn't acknowledge the issue.  Honestly you shouldn't have to flag down a bartender at a place that charges $17 for cocktails let alone wait 30 minutes for one.",,,

5,deanna c.,"Ringwood, NJ",4,41,33,5.0,11/5/2018,Stayed across the street at the West Hotel last week and our group of 4 came after an event for a couple drinks. Each cocktail tasted better then the next. We were lucky to grab 2 seats at the end of the bar whichever worked out perfect. Staff was attentive and music was good.,,,
6,Tom K.,"Forest Hills, NY",329,804,47,4.0,2/4/2018,"In all my years of drinking (which expands into decades at this point), I've heard of the rickey cocktail but never actually tried one. You'll find plenty of variations on theme of rickey at ""The Rickey"", the hotel bar of the Dream Midtown that is conveniently accessible from the street. The space does have its appeal. Prior to any alcohol even touching my lips, a survey of the terrain reveals plush, velvet sofas and chairs, appropriately dim lighting and a volume of sound that is perfect for conversation. The sound track of popular and more obscure 80's to 90's hits adds a touch of nostalgia to room, perhaps to remind those gathered of their youth.Busy without being chaotic, on a Friday evening the Rickey still had enough seating so as to neutralize the need to wait. Of course, the menu includes not only rickeys to order but also the story of the rickey. Colonel Joe Rickey, gentleman gambler, political wheeler and dealer, also happened to own a DC bar and gave his name to this liquid mix of gin and carbonated water. It's a refreshing drink that can be perfect for a  hot summer day or, in this case, a cold winter's night. (Alcohol is alcohol, after all)Besides serving up classic rickeys, there many other options, ranging from classic cocktails to in-house concoctions with clever names. The classic manhattan went down smooth and was a slower drink than the rickey, based on the presence of bourbon and vermooth. The gin rickey is $15 and the manhattan, $18. The menu also has drinks for the non-cocktail craving guest, ranging from prosecco to dom perignon. (And bud lite!)Service was friendly, prompt and attentive, exactly as it should be. For a spot of adult conversation, a few rounds of potent potentables and a soundtrack of one's youth, the Rickey is well worth a visit.",4,2,3
7,Janet L.,"City Center, Baltimore, MD",170,30,0,5.0,10/14/2018,"Stopped by here as we waited for our dinner table to be ready. The cocktails were well balanced and delicious. Although the price was steep, it was well worth it. The cocktail was strong but still tasted like a cocktail. The ambiance was also comfortable with plush couches and chairs",,,
8,Christine B.,"New York, NY",38,9,14,5.0,6/18/2018,"I hosted a work event for about 60 people in this space, and it was a hit through and through!  The team really enjoyed their time.... the feel of the space was just what we were looking for; the food was great; cocktails superb; service was outstanding.  The gentleman who looked over our event, Julian Wrede, was absolutely amazing - hospitality at its finest!  The events staff was a pleasure and easy to work with during the planning process.  I worked directly with Elizabeth Mormile, who did a great job of making sure I was considering all of the right things, and making suggestions when I needed guidance.  Would recommend this location for any work or special events!  It's truly a great time :)",1,,
9,Roger M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",6,63,137,5.0,10/27/2017,Very intimate lounge with classic well made drinks.Hotel guest kinda crowd.. but the drinks are worth a try. Good scotch and burbon selection.  Music covers most genre but not that polar. Staff is on point. Place is clean.,1,,
10,Tony L.,"Manhattan, NY",617,635,594,3.0,11/28/2017,"Eh. Drinks are overpriced and unimpressive, but this place is classy and quiet and the perfect place to get away from the maddening crowd. Just don't stay for more than one drink unless your friend is buying!  It's a hotel bar - so that's why you will pay out your ear for drinks that are made better and cheaper almost anywhere else in Manhattan. If you're staying at the Dream Hotel Midtown, you can probably afford it and don't care about quality anyway. Your idea of New York is a hotel just north of Times Square.",,,
11,Lauren B.,"Austin, TX",182,109,55,5.0,1/11/2018,"My friend and I visited The Rickey a few times during our stay in NYC since it was just a block over from our hotel and it had really cool vibes, it's also attached to a night club up top so that's convenient! We really enjoyed this bar and all of their cocktails. We originally came in because we had a free drink through the HOOCH app, but it was buy one get one. And these cocktails are strong! They have a specialty cocktail list and then a wine list, we tried four of the cocktails and all of them were tasty and as mentioned, strong. The staff was really friendly, which was a nice change of beat from the usual service you get in Manhattan with all of the tourists like ourselves.  This bar is in a great location and I thought the prices were really comparable to all of the other bars, if not a couple of bucks cheaper. The interior decor is beautiful, sleek and sophisticated. You could almost Say it's cozy, it would be a good place to get after dinner cocktails after a date!",5,1,2
12,Matt L.,"MASPETH, NY",667,46,66,4.0,1/7/2018,"This was my first time at The Rickey and I must say it was a cool spot. The ambiance: dimmed lights - giving it an almost romantic feel. It was very quiet, which was great because you can hear the people you are with speak. The setup was pretty open and offered a decent amount of seating at the bar and around it. The music being played was low and it was trendy - not hip hop, rap, etc. The drinks were pricey, but then again given the location, it was probably normal. A sailor Jerry and ginger was $16, but a Hennessy and Redbull was $25. A few things I wasn't a fan of (per say): there was no table service, so each time you wanted a drink, you'd have to get up and go to the bar. This was a bit of a hassle being I was with a significantly large group. Also, there was only one restroom. I'm not sure if the venue doesn't see much traffic, but the wait time at the bathroom surpassed 10 minutes easily toward the end of my night there. Overall, I would definitely go back for a date or just to chill with friends. It's conveniently located in midtown and generally has a great vibe to it.",1,,
13,Charis B.,"New York, NY",43,85,111,1.0,12/24/2017,"Terribly slow service. They didn't have their signature drink on a Saturday evening. Staff are incredibly slow even with the place close to empty, and even though we told them we're in a hurry our food and drinks took much longer than expected. Very unenthused and uninterested bartender. The antipasto platter we had to wait more than 20 mins for was good though.",,,
14,Lola J.,"Los Angeles, CA",199,20,323,3.0,10/2/2017,"This place was almost perfect! Except for the fact that they don't carry to-go boxes. I'm sure they have them, however they just expect for you to waste food and money. (The American way) otherwise it's a cute scene. It you want a worthy drink, the walnut sazrec is the perfect representation of a simple yet tasty and classic drink.",2,,1
15,Lauren J.,"Boston, MA",9,72,25,2.0,2/10/2017,"Not a great experience! Went on a Monday night after having dinner in the area. Randomly chose this bar as it looked like it could be cool and I was in the mood for cocktails. My two friends and I sat down and received menus fairly quickly. It was all downhill from there.We selected 3 drinks from the menu and I ordered for the group. The female bartender who took our order came back a few minutes later to tell us that they were out of the ingredients for one of the drinks, so we decided to get a different one. Then, she came back to say that they were out of apple brandy for that drink, but she was using bulleit bourbon as it would taste the same. There's no way that they would taste the same, but I like bulleit, so I said fine.The drinks were decent though priced at a $15 a pop. PDT this was not and if you run out of a bunch of ingredients, you shouldn't be charging for high-end cocktails. Anyway - we decided to stay for another round and just wanted to get the same drinks. After several attempts at getting the bartenders' attention. We finally settled on telling the bar back that we would like another round, figuring that would be easy (no new drinks to remember).The bar back disappeared and we weren't acknowledged again for another 10 minutes when the male bartender asked us if we wanted another drink. At that point, it had been a full hour since we finished our last drink. We said we would like another round. When the drinks were delivered, we asked for the check as we didn't know when we would see them again (mind you, there were only 2 other tables in the whole bar). The female bartender came back about 5 minutes later.... with someone else card. It took another 5 minutes to flag her down and tell her that was not our card.We wanted to split the check up a certain way, so I wrote down the amount to charge each card on the receipt, face up and in green pen. She took our cards and we prayed for a good outcome. A few minutes later, she came back asking if we wanted to split the check evenly.... (ahhhhhh) I pointed out the fact that we had written down the amounts and she went off again to split the check the way we wanted (hopefully).It's too bad this place was so terrible. I liked the vibe/furniture and the drinks would have been great if they actually carried the ingredients listed on the menu. The service was sorely lacking. Lastly - they only had one bathroom, so I waited to use it before we left. Surprise, surprise - there was no soap. When I came back to the table, the female bartender was apologizing for the lack of service. She was nice about it, but the damage was done - none of us are returning.",2,1,1
16,Kelly N.,"New York, NY",75,14,4,5.0,5/29/2018,"Amazing bar, even better drinks! Came here on a Friday night a few weeks ago and stayed for the incredibly refreshing fresh watermelon and cucumber margaritas. Relaxed space, lovely decorations- my new favorite spot!",,,
17,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",982,879,724,4.0,6/25/2017,"Awesome little place for drinks. A hidden gem. Right next to the Dream Hotel. Cute date place or very low key place to grab a drink with a friend. Doesn't get too crowded so you can actually hear each other. Very cool and hipster vibe in here. The bartenders are old school and dressed the part, including their mustaches and hair. It's a dark dreamy little speakeasy, go there. Good wine too.",3,1,2
18,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",219,1497,2289,4.0,6/20/2017,"Great cocktails! Came here for a Yelp event but I was pleasantly surprised to find a quiet and intimate bar in the heart of Midtown. There aren't a lot of good drinking spots on Midtown so I'm glad to have come across this spot. And of course, it doesn't hurt that they mix pretty good cocktails.",1,,1
19,Sunita M.,"Princeton, NJ",71,133,5,2.0,2/9/2018,"Vibe: cool, quiet, relaxed. Prices: ridiculous, even for the city. Staff: greeter was super pleasant & warm but the bartender was NOT. Took nearly 5 min to even greet you, another 5 to hand you a menu, seemed disgusted when asked if there's a happy hour menu, another 5 min to get my drink (& I got wine!). Overall, the rude bartender who didn't bother to see if i wanted anything else or how my overpriced glass even was killed this venue for me. With so many options in midtown, there's no reason to come here",,,
20,Sarah C.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,3,5.0,2/22/2018,Swanky little hotspot that's a bit more intimate vs their other venues inside the hotel. Perfect for date night! We got the charcuterie board to share which was full of a variety and a large size compared to what you would get at other places. I got the Pomegranate Rickey which was both beautiful and delicious! My boyfriend tried an espresso cocktail that was totally on point. The bartenders did a great job listening to our preferences and creating things to our liking. Highly recommend starting or ending your night here!,,,
21,Jennifer M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",175,3,0,5.0,3/12/2018,"Stopped in for a drink before theatre with a friend and we both loved it. The drinks were fantastic and well crafted, the bar tender was prompt and friendly and we also enjoyed a few bites. Had the buffalo hummus crudités and the kale artichoke dip, we added lobster. Really enjoyed everything about the experience, and will come back",,,
22,Will V.,"Jersey City, NJ",35,257,84,3.0,8/23/2016,"If I could give 3.5 stars, I would. But...The Rickey is a fine spot for an after work drink, but for anything more than that it's a tad overpriced and trying a bit too hard to make it a regular hangout. The influence of The Dream Hotel - with an entrance off the lobby - makes me suspicious that this is less of an authentic spot and more a hotel owner's ""concept.""Anyhow, I had the ""Weekend in Cabo"" drink, which was tasty and fresh with tequila, mezcal, watermelon, cilantro, and agave. My friend had the pomegranate rickey, a vodka drink with many ingredients, a pomegranate seed ice cube, and a good taste. The ""Going Back to Cali"" drink was too busy - tequila, hemp, avocado, vanilla, and lime - and tasted more wintry than California influenced. Appetizers were fine, the fig jam and gorgonzola spread on toast was flavorful and our favorite. The Thai basil hummus was plain, but it's hummus and that's to be expected. Decor is ""upscale cocktail lounge"" with a few flourishes and likely looks better at night and not in the daylight (don't we all?).",1,,
23,Michael M.,"Washington, DC",20,5,1,5.0,7/3/2016,"So a friend of mine invited me to meet her at a ""swanky place in Midtown"" and obviously my eyebrows went up. When I walked through the door and sat down at the bar, my fears evaporated. It was a nice, early Saturday evening, and the bartenders took the time to walk us through the (awesome) selection, and made some incredible recommendations, including a Walnut Sazerac that instantly became the go-to for our group. One quote from the staff made it crystal clear that I was in the right place. ""Sometimes you don't need a fancy cocktail, just let the liquor speak for itself.""They could pivot between a carefully crafted masterpiece, and pouring out a neat sipping tequila that makes me want to move to Mexico. I can't recommend them strongly enough, and I'll go back soon.",2,,

25,Eliza M.,"Manhattan, NY",10,12,0,5.0,11/5/2017,"Came here for an event and have to say it was a great space. Passed food was excellent, especially the sliders I probably had 6 of them. Layout of the room is great for intimate affairs and the bar is long so it's easy to get to from all corners of the room. Music wasn't too loud it's great if you actually want to be able to hear the person next to you and it's right next to the NRQW train making it easy to get to.",,,

I wanted a spicy drink and had the most comfortable and tasty bourbon based drink, that included a cinnamon stick being lit on fire!

The bartender took a long long time to say anything to me even hello. It's a pet peeve. Manage my expectations and say hello and drop off a cocktail menu. Let me know that I have made it on your bartender to do list. It's a simple step. She was a lovely tall brunette and had a bar back. When I did get her attention she was pleasant enough...my drinks were excellent! With all the competition in the area. Service has to be the difference....,1,,

Got our drinks, which were good but pricey. We decided to stay for another drink. Not one of the 3 bartenders asked if we wanted another one. One walked right past us at least 4 times and didn't even glance in our direction. We flagged down a bar back and he took our order...and then proceeded to go downstairs without ever telling the bartender our order. Another 10 minutes passes and finally someone comes over and asks what we'd like. We ordered another round and asked to pay right away since we didn't know if anyone would ever come back our way again.There were 2 other groups of people.  Two.  We got the check and the wrong card was given to us. How 3 bartenders and 2 bar backs couldn't keep track of 3 groups of people is beyond me.If you like waiting an hour between drinks that cost $15 each then this might just be the place for you.",,1,
