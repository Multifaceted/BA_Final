2,Joseph K.,"Easton, CT",6,29,0,5.0,7/14/2018,"I was exhausted, dehydrated, and unable to return home for another half of a day.  All I wanted was a quiet place to recharge my phone and recharge myself, with familiar food, and a server who would keep the water coming.  I found exactly that here.  I had the brisket and a cold brew coffee.  They were both very good.  I felt a little awkward sticking around for an hour after my meal working on my tablet, but they weren't busy and let me do it.  Really recommend this place in between the lunch and dinner rush as a good pit stop.",1,1,1
3,Zachary S.,"Binghamton, NY",249,2,4,5.0,11/17/2018,"This is a shout out to Effy's Kitchen!  This is the second time I've been here and I think feel comfortable expecting great food and fantastic service! The two servers Ram and Syrah were so helpful, energetic and accommodative.  My friend and I came here for brunch and we got the $25 special - bottomless mimosas and ANY single platter.  We got the Shakshuka and the Chicken Schnitzel sandwich.  Everything was amazing!!! I can't wait to come back for more!",,,
4,Becky P.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,5.0,11/18/2018,"Enjoyed an excellent brunch here.  My stomach was a bit queasy so I was looking for a healthy/not too greasy breakfast.  I ordered a berry smoothy and oatmeal and my boyfriend ordered the goat cheese omelette.  The smoothy and oatmeal hit the spot.  Oatmeal can be bland, but they made it with just the right about of creamy and sweetness, with fresh fruit on top.  I tried the omelette too and it was good. The hash browns were also very tasty, maybe just a bit too much salt, but others may disagree on that.  Service was also very attentive and friendly and the spot is very cute albeit tiny.",,,
5,Yara F.,"New York, NY",126,259,340,5.0,5/8/2018,"Came here for brunch with a group of four and had a great experience! $25 for 60 minutes of unlimited mimosas and an entree is a great deal. We were seated immediately on a sunny Saturday around 12:30, the vibe/decor of the place is very bright and open with white tiling and wooden accents which is my favorite. The wait staff is very kind and on a nice day they open the windows so you feel like you're outside! The menu is basically diner food with a healthy and fun twist, I loved my schnitzel and cheddar waffles and there is a large variety of entree options!Will be back for brunch for sure!",3,2,2
6,Marissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",16,244,209,4.0,9/3/2018,"Solid food but nothing spectacular.  Since I live nearby, I think I'll get food often - because it's solid and very reasonably priced; but I'd certainly never travel far for it.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich with fries (which were super crispy and yummy), and tried blueberry pancakes which I didn't care for.  The pancakes were kind of bland and tasted like bread.  Not bad but didn't feel like a treat.",,,1
7,Joan S.,"New York, NY",320,80,209,4.0,5/24/2018,"Food:I got the California omelette (comes with salad, baguette, hummus, or potatoes - you pick two) with house drop coffee. The food came out pretty quickly. My friends opted for the lunch with unlimited mimosas (1 hr limit), breakfast platter, and coffee (this was around $17) which they enjoyed. On a second visit I got the smoked salmon omelette with salad and potatoes ($14.95). It was very good with generous portions!! My friend got the french toast and said that it was good! Arrival/wait:I came on a Sunday at 10:30am and there was no wait. Another time I went in a Saturday at 10am and there was also no wait! Drinks:Coffee was fine. For less than two bucks it hit the spot. Service:Service was good. Vibes:Super casual ambience. Great place to hang out with friends for a casual brunch. We were seated by the area next to the street side - a great way to enjoy the weather while brunching!",1,,
8,Sara S.,"New York, NY",183,131,340,4.0,12/28/2017,"Effy's menu features elevated diner classics with a healthy twist. This is a great spot to go if you're craving some comfort food in a cozy setting. I've had their breakfast in-house and via delivery, but it's hands down best enjoyed in person. On both occasions it took a bit for our food to arrive, but when it did it was piping hot. Shaksuka is one of my favorite savory breakfasts and theirs doesn't disappoint. Loved that the sauce was on the rustic side which paired perfectly with the toasted pita + over easy egg. My mom enjoyed her breakfast platter which featured eggs, toast, home fries, and salad. We also shared a bowl of the oatmeal and were fighting over the last bite. I highly recommend their iced chai. One of the best I've ever had! Effy's is a great spot to fuel up before a trip to the museum or a walk through Central Park.",5,1,2
9,Lisa A.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/16/2018,"This was my first time here at Effy's kitchen! I was served by the server, Ram, who was super friendly and professional! He kept checking in to ensure that everything was going well, which it was. Furthermore, the quality of the food was exceptional! Probably the best smoked turkey sandwich I have had to date! The very berry banana smoothie was a refreshing touch to the meal! You won't make a mistake by coming here!!!",,,

The sweetest manager/owner of all time! i love the vibe, decor, and clean atmosphere here. i needed time to go through the menu, i could barely pick what i wanted to eat. i settled for chicken schnitzel and it was delish. salad was good too but not enough flavor in the dressing for me so i asked for more and it was easily provided. prices are decent, you get 10% off if you pay in cash. very happy with the service here, i would totally come back!",1,1,1

12,Edgar A.,"ASTORIA, NY",46,137,653,5.0,10/29/2017,"Incredibly rainy  day in New York City. Powerful winds and broken umbrellas everywhere! Nonetheless, me and my girlfriend stuck to our plans to having brunch near Museum Mile. After doing some Yelp research, we agreed to brunch at this place.Absolutely no regrets, . When I walked in, I was just very happy to be somewhere indoors. Luckily, my girlfriend got us a table before I arrived. I immediately noticed that the place is relatively small and intimate, which I like.I dug the butcher paper on the table. It was a nice decorative touch. The waitress was very kind, and took our orders swiftly.The food arrived maybe 20-25 minutes after we placed our orders. For both meals (Veggie Omelet and Tel Aviv Wrap) the plating of the food was very well done. The amount of food for the price was really favorable too! The temperature of the food was nice and warm. Most importantly, the taste of the food was great! I usually don't order fries, but was in the mood for some today. Their fries  were delicious! Not soggy, with just the right amount of crunchiness.I really dug the service and the food. Would love to go there again when I'm in that area.P.S. They offer a 10% discount if you pay cash, which we thought was a pretty awesome deal.",,,
13,Eric S.,"Manhattan, NY",59,10,1,1.0,10/12/2018,rude customer service. Was trying to order some coffee and the owner got inpatient with me.. It like hey man I'm just trying to get my stuff and pay you. Why can't you be nice to people who want to do business with you? That made me feel disappointed in humanity afterwards.,,,
14,Jacqueline M.,"New York, NY",7,36,11,5.0,8/28/2018,"I was visiting a friend at Mt. Sinai hospital and took a walk with my husband. We happened upon this little spot that looked like a good choice for brunch. We were not disappointed. To be honest, I left this review hanging and we were there a year ago (Feb 2017). I don't remember what we had, but I do know my husband and I look forward to returning. I definitely recommend this place.",1,1,1
15,Vivian L.,"San Diego, CA",597,123,105,4.0,12/17/2017,"If you're looking for a bottomless mimosa weekend brunch, here is the place! They had a deal which included and entree (usually around $10) and bottomless mimosas for $25. The serving sizes are also very huge and I couldn't finish my plate (neither could my boyfriend nor his friend). If you're indecisive like me, get the Effy's Breakfast, which had a little variety (hummus, eggplant salad, tuna salad, cream cheese, feta, 2 eggs, whole wheat pita, green salad). My boyfriend got the shashuka, which I wish I had gotten-- a very solid choice. A cute little place, perfect for brunch and coffee :)",1,,

17,Raiyan D.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",8,59,2,1.0,4/29/2018,"I ordered breakfast from this place today because of how close it was to where I was staying, and I must say, I was thoroughly disappointed with the quality of food. We ordered the french toast, the avocado toast, and the scrambled eggs and toast, and none of it worked. The food did not taste or appear fresh by any means. Also, our eggs were overcooked, and the coffee I ordered tasted burnt. I'm unsure if caught them on a bad day because it was Sunday morning, and they seemed to be super packed, but the quality of food leads me to believe otherwise.",,3,

19,Nathalie C.,"Brooklyn, NY",646,140,496,3.0,10/9/2017,"Effy's Kitchen is okay. Nothing special but perhaps it was what I ordered. A chicken Caesar wrap with crinkle cut fries. The meat definitely needed salt. The place is affordable and they serve large portions. Don't have what I had if you go, that's typical. Have their breakfast and report back! Haha",1,,

When we arrived it was a cold and rainy day there was only one other couple there and they were leaving so we had the restaurant all to ourselves. I assume the lady who greeted us and took our order was Effy, I may be wrong, but she was very nice and welcoming. One thing I love was the all day breakfast! Any place I can get pancakes at 4pm is a winner. The food had a ""home"" taste to it, as if you visited a friend that knows how to cook (Best way I could describe it).One star off for the music. While I love some jams, if it has a E for explicit don't subject your customers to feel uncomfortable, it's just a little common courtesy.",7,,5

23,Kai M.,"New York, NY",5,44,6,3.0,4/13/2018,Reviews for this place had me expecting such great things. Although the food was decent; this is just your standard diner-esque fare. On the greasy side. And not unique in menu items.Good for a quick above-your-average-deli meal.,,,
24,Melissa B.,"New York, NY",49,6,0,1.0,4/7/2018,"The food was tasty but their billing system is junk. The check offers you a 10% discount if you pay in cash but, when you pay in cash, they say the 10% discount was already calculated into the bill. What? So your telling me that, in a world where the majority of people pay with cards, you have to explain to them all why they have just been charged an extra 10%? I don't think so. So unless you want to get ripped off, maybe choose another spot to eat.",,,

Let me just start by saying, the atmosphere in here is perfect! They've made it really inviting minus the pretentious feeling of many LES/wburg coffee houses. The food is simple (& affordable), coffee is also surprisingly great. They have a serious amount of plugs in here, if you need to find a place to get some work done! Also, the staff are friendly and the service is excellent. I definitely would recommend this place for anyone looking for somewhere to hide on rainy/cold days on the UES/East Harlem. (Although I haven't tried it, they seem to have bottomless brunch here on the weekends!)",1,,

Updated review",Effy's Kitchen is a nice local restaurant in our neighborhood. I took my husband out for breakfast and he ordered the chicken schnitzel and waffles and i ordered the salmon and cream cheese omlette. Both dishes were very tasty. The service is great and the ambiance is very chill and relaxed.We will definitely return back to this restaurant.,,,
31,Bryan H.,"New York, NY",3,74,14,4.0,4/2/2017,"As someone who lives in the area I am a big fan of this place.  It is a quaint little brunch place on the border of East Harlem and the Upper East Side.  My favorite thing about this restaurant is the price.  You are not going to find a better value for brunch in the area than you will here. The ambience and the service is great.  My wife describes the decor as southern chic (whatever that means). The food itself was good. Nothing special to be brutally honest and the selection is limited.  I am a big sausage and bacon guy and the only thing on the menu for me was the breakfast burrito. The guests I've taken there in the past have ordered the pancakes and chicken wrap. At the end of the day, despite the lack of variety we all enjoyed our food for a great priceOverall:  4 stars. Great brunch spot near UES for reasonable pricePrice and value 5 starsAmbience 4.5 starsFood variety and taste 3.5 stars",2,1,
32,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,4.0,5/13/2017,"Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for lunch with a friend on a weekday. The place was pretty empty, so we were able to be seated right away.After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the shakshuka. This version of the dish was very tasty and a good size as well. I love that they served it with pita to really sop up all of the sauce.Overall, the food here is good, the price points are low, and the service is friendly. Not a bad spot to check out for lunch if you are in the area.",1,,
33,Denise R.,"Bronx, NY",50,63,118,4.0,6/22/2017,"Cute cozy spot. I love coffee shops. Not conducive for working if u need outlets but fun for a meet up or solo resting point. Cute and simple decor. I had a reg coffee it was ok. The hummus and guac small platter was ON POINT! Overall cool 1st experience. Service was pleasant, crowd was minimal, but this was 5pm on a Thursday.

39,Narinah J.,"Tallahassee, FL",127,10,19,3.0,10/1/2017,"Cute little breakfast spot, a definite go to if you want a casual place to eat... sweats/ gym attire is totally fine in my opinion (I wore leather pants and a white T-shirt, it was chilly)! I had the Italian omelette with house fries and toast as my sides along with the Challah French Toast.  You'll enjoy the Italian Omelette if you like mozzarella cheese. There are thick slices of authentic mozzarella cheese within the omelette. It was good, not all that. I have to say the house fries are very good, very unique to this place. I've never had any like them. The seasonings on the potatoes were perfect and the potatoes literally melt in your mouth. The French toast was good but I've had better. This is a nice spot especially if you don't want to spend a lot of money. You also get 10% off if you pay with cash!",1,,
40,Andrew C.,"Brooklyn, NY",219,124,250,5.0,1/21/2017,"Amazing establishment.  Great Product.  Attentive Service.I usually critique a dining establishment based on its product and service, but the weight accorded depends on the circumstances.I was looking for good breakfast (brunch) food at a reasonable price.My challah french toast (comes with fruit) and side of two scrambled eggs was delicious.  Evidence was my clear plates.The server was attentive and provided seemingly genuine recommendations.Meal for two under $30, I cannot complain.  My french toast was $8.95 I believe.  No complaints.Conclusion, Effy's exceeded my expectations, therefore I shall recommend and plan to return.",2,1,2

Updated review","I barely write review for restaurants because i'm a very busy person but when i do, its 100% true! Been here twice already. And i think i'll be coming back for more. Their classic chicken sandwich is the bomb. Best sandwich ive tasted. And the wings? It is just plain and simple but the taste? Complete opposite! This is the best wings ive tasted in this neighborhood. Make sure to visit on weekdays because on weekends this place si jampacked! People are waiting outside just to get a seat. But on weekdays its quiet and their music is relaxing. Thumbs up effys! Went back for their smooth strawberry smoothie! This is perfect for today's hot weather!!",1,,
44,Charmaine R.,"Manhattan, NY",88,16,22,5.0,1/12/2017,"I was in the neighborhood yesterday, so I popped in Effy's Kitchen for my dinner. The interior is really cute and the people who worked there were really nice and friendly. In addition to this, service was highly attentive. I ordered Shrimp Scampi, btw shrimps are my favorite so I eat it all the time and what I had from Effy's Kitchen was super good - I could have eaten another plate. In fact Effy's Kitchen is now one of my favorites in the city! My food was served with mashed potato and chopped salad. For my drink, I had a glass of Pinot Grigio wine and I loved it! So it's totally another cheat day for me. Looking forward to the next time I come to try their other dishes!Overall, I would surely go back and recommend this place to my friends!",1,1,1
45,Zhanna I.,"Greenwood Lake, NY",0,31,6,4.0,12/13/2016,"A cute local spot for brunch.Please ignore the extensive typos on their menu. My friend and I had a good laugh about it for our entire meal. Other than that, the food is good and well-priced. We came for brunch and didn't have to wait that day because it was raining. I've come three times beforehand and the wait was over 30 minutes, so I picked other places. Seating is limited. The home fries were a bit too burnt for my taste, but I'm sure they would have made them softer had I asked in advance. They definitely made the bacon less crispy as per my request. Unlimited refills on good coffee always makes me happy, too. The crowd that day was young and hip, so I felt very cozy with them and talked to our elbow mates. The food is not phenomenal, but for a local place that does strive to satisfy their customers and offers a typical brunch menu, it satisfied my needs that day.",1,1,1
46,Caleb F.,"Manhattan, NY",289,68,75,4.0,8/3/2017,"Nice little homey spot for breakfast/brunch. Came here with 6 others. Service was kind of slow even though there was only two other people in the restaurant. Omelette with mozzarella and salmon was ~$12. Mozzarella wasn't really melted and had already hardened by the time the food came out. Otherwise, it was decent. The dish also came with two sides including toast and home fries.",,,

54,Brittany G.,"Decatur, GA",28,66,24,5.0,6/28/2016,"Cute cafe in east Harlem and very close to the UES. They have delicious breakfast all day as well as yummy lunch options. The portions are generous for their reasonable prices. My favorite part is the atmosphere. This is a small cafe with a few tables and a bar top, that's it. Very cozy and the soft romantic music is an excellent touch. In the summer there is patio seating as well as an open window front. The food is delicious and they have a great assortment of breakfast, salads, sandwiches, and platters. Wine/champagne is available as well! Great mix of options for vegetarian, vegan, low carb, healthy dishes, and indulgences so there is something for everyone. Definitely a gem among some of the overpriced and underwhelming spots I've been to in the UES. Highly recommend for breakfast, lunch, or tea/coffee if you want a cozy place with yummy food!",4,1,3

When I saw that it wasn't included with my order, I figured that the salad must have been predressed. Nope. It was bland as bland could be. The schnitzel that came with the salad was fried nicely and had a nice crunch. The salad was about $10, a little pricey for what it was. Not sure if I'll be ordering from here again.",,,
61,Kristen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,269,76,3.0,7/7/2016,"The food was alright - not anything to write home about, but not so terrible that I was thoroughly disappointed. We came here at around 7:30pm on a Friday, and yet they were out of mozzarella sticks. We were sad. My turkey burger was alright - pretty juicy and tender, but honestly, could have used a bit more seasoning. My friend was relatively content with her grilled cheese. Our vanilla milkshake was sort of watery and tasted much more like milk with vanilla extract in it. For a place that was basically empty, the service was a bit slower than I would have liked. Maybe it was an off day, but I wasn't feeling impressed in any way by this place when I left.",2,,

Their smoothies/milkshakes are the bomb, the omelettes are amazing, and really their entire menu is the truth! Very few places have gotten me to order from them two days in a row-- Effy's somehow got me to order from them twice within the same day!

I had skipped class, was cramming for an exam and decided to order some breakfast from Effy's. I expected my food to take about an hour. So would anyone else. But when it was late, I didn't worry, because it's seamless, they'll deliver.I lost track of time, and when the doorbell rang for my friends food who had ordered at the time when I should have been receiving my food, I got pissed.I called them and complained, they responded that they had sent my food already. I politely asked them  since I had not gotten my food what they wanted to do. They said they would send me food and refund me, to which I gladly agreed without knowing what was to come next.They just didn't deliver it, blaming the fact that they had a lot of deliveries (no matter how many deliveries you have, it doesn't take more than an hour to get the customer food). When I FINALLY got my food, I received a spilled cup of chai latte and it had gotten into my eggs since the box had been destroyed. When I called they simply ignored it (the tone changes when they put you on hold), and I have not received a refund - it's been a couple days and they said they would do it the evening of.Effy's, this is coming from someone who has been to your restaurant numerous times, and really likes it. But, respectfully, you suck.EDIT: I received numerous messages of the Effy's staff attempting to get me a refund. They apologized to me for the coffee spill. Like I said earlier, I've been there numerous times and their food and service is good, they just had bad luck with seamless that day.",2,4,

Most meals are under $10-11! Because really, should an omelette cost more than that? I had the chicken schnitzel and cheddar waffles - it was delicious and a generous portion. They also have juices and smoothies on the menu. I tried the Kale Whale which I thought didn't have much flavor, so next time I'll just stick with coffee. It's a small place inside, but cozy.

Updated review","I order iced coffee drinks, they come bland, without sugar and with no sugar packets. I order a hot mocha, I'm charged $4.00 for a small cup that is filled half-way, and is also unsweetened with no sugar packets. I was trying to really stick with this place, but no can do. Maybe it's different eating-in, but my deliveries are hit and miss. The half-full small cup of mocha was the end of the line for me.",,,

Food: so so. I'm not sure if this place is serving American, Middle Eastern, Jewish, Southern, or Latin American influenced food. But one thing I do know, ""sautéed kale"" should not look like it was a cold bar garnish just 10 min ago (you know the kind of uncooked greens you place shrimp or oysters on to make them look pretty). I would still like to return again to see what seems to keep other people coming back for more.",,,

84,Daniella F.,"New York, NY",210,37,11,2.0,7/10/2017,I've ordered from here more than a handful of times. The first couple of times were amazing which is why we continued to order from there. The last two times have been horrible that I don't think I will order from there again. The chicken has been so rubbery that it was completely inedible. The fries are good as well as the salad and the spinach pies. I would most likely only order things of the such. I'm overall very disappointed because I used to love it as they have some healthy options. I hope it was just an issue in the kitchen the past two times.,,,
85,Anne S.,"San Francisco, CA",143,237,26,3.0,12/30/2016,"I first went to this place when it was about a mile south. It used to be a cute coffee shop that was perfect to work from. The owner was friendly and usually there. It had a soul unlike 99% of upper east side places. They had food which was nice when you were doing a marathon day of work and didn't want to leave the comfort of a caffeinated haven to forage for food. Since those years they have reinvented themselves up the street. The vibe is similar. Good people and a place with a soul. The food is still basically coffee shop food with a little extra...approaching diner food. It is a good place to go when you want to grab a quick bite in the neighborhood. Definitely not a foodie haven or a place with lots of frills. If they threw a couple couches in their space, they would get even more business.",,,
86,Pnina D.,"Manhattan, NY",76,22,29,3.0,9/1/2016,"Food was good/ok considering the prices. Salad and omelette were actually good but the baguette was quite dry.

We waited a long time to get our food and then about 25 min just to get the check. The staff was nice and polite but I was surprised that no one apologized or even commented about the poor/slow service.

I won't make that mistake again. The ""new"" East Harlem outpost is even better--still low-key and relatively healthful but much more stylish--and well worth the stroll.We've only had brunch here, but it was pretty much the ideal brunch. The egg dishes are fluffy and fillings generous. The home fries are actually chunks of potato (i.e. not crispy at all) but still delicious, as was the side salad. My berry smoothie was good to the last drop, and the coffee is solid.Nice surprises: The service is SO kind and friendly; we asked a million questions, and our server, unflappable, got every detail right. There were no crowds, even on a weekend morning. Free wi-fi. Lastly, the check was very reasonable, and it's even 10% more reasonable if you pay cash (!).",6,3,3

I called the restaurant to let them know, and they did offer refund my order. However when I checked my bank account the today, I found out that Effy's had not refunded me. They double charged me.

94,Daniela P.,"New York, NY",135,202,101,3.0,11/28/2016,"After taking some time to reflect on my experience at Effy's, I've decided that it wasn't as great as I hoped it would be. The best thing about this place? Definitely the prices. I mean, in NYC, I'm expecting to pay around $15 for a french toast plate with literally nothing else but maybe one slice of banana and strawberry. Everything here was fairly priced.We (party of two) arrived at around 1pm on a Sunday for brunch. Thankfully, we were seated immediately, but the place was almost full (it's a small space with about 10 tables). Our waitress/hostess was very nice and attentive and brought us our menus quickly. She gave us plenty of time to decide without hovering or rushing. I was having one of those mornings where I wanted a little bit of everything. I opted for the two eggs with toast and home fries AND the challah french toast with berries (don't judge me). My friend couldn't decide on pancakes or FT, so we opted for both and split them. She got the same order of eggs, but instead ordered blueberry pancakes. Our dishes took a while to come out (20 minutes or so), especially considering that a majority of people had left by then. When they did come out, everything looked delicious. My over-medium eggs were cooked PERFECTLY (no white [nauseating] goo) and the toast was fresh. However, my home fries (diced potatoes) were SO hard. They weren't crunchy, they were just hard, as if they weren't cooked for long enough. It was really lame, as I was really looking forward to yummy home fries. I guess if you drench them in ketchup it would be OK. After finishing that up, I decided to only have half of my sweets (running out of space!). The challah french toast was good, but I definitely recommend eating them while they're hot. After chatting and taking forever to finish our first dish, the other items got cold and hard quickly. Not blaming that on the restaurant at all. They also didn't skimp out of the berries. After seeing disappointment in my friend's face, I knew the pancakes were disappointing - and boy, they were. They were SO dry, with absolutely NO fluff. The middle of the pancake was completely undercooked, which was another bummer. Overall, the food was OK. The service was great, and our waitress even took the pancakes off our bill after we told her that we were disappointed with them. Would I come here again? Yes. I really hope that next time the potatoes and pancakes are delicious!",,,

The French toast came with a wonderful portion of fruit; the only downside was that by the time it arrived, it was a little soggy so I sort of wish they'd packaged the fruit separately?

I ordered their Italian omelette which came with fresh mozzarella(!!) for a really cheap price, wow! I week later I ordered the Mexican omelette which also had high quality ingredients. I thought I had finally found my breakfast/brunch place in East Harlem. Well unfortunately the food took a precipitous drop in quality. They no longer give you fresh mozzarella, the home fries have become inconsistent in quality. I'm not surprised they lowered the quality of the food, as the price was so inexpensive I wasn't sure how they were turning a profit. The food is not bad by any means, but is no longer exceptional as it was when they first opened, SAD!  I don't really come here anymore due to the drop in quality. At least it's still cheap.

120,Edward S.,"New York, NY",587,27,0,4.0,3/6/2016,"I'm gonna be honest with you. I wanted to hate this restaurant. The owners first started this little spot as a sushi restaurant and it was awful. When I came in to try this new concept out, I wanted to hate it, but this time, I was pleasantly surprised.After my morning workout, I stopped in for breakfast and got the pastrami omelette. It comes with two sides, so I chose the chopped salad and home fries. Portions were large and I appreciated the value for a little spot in East Harlem. It came out to something like $8 or $9 bucks. I added an order of chicken sausage after I saw the table next to me order them (yum!) and the total bill was something like $12 + tip.Overall, it's a great little place for standard diner food fare. They have a beer and wine license but didn't notice mimosas or anything, mainly smoothies and juices. Just don't charge me an arm and a leg for a drink and we'll be good.",1,,
121,Christina C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,4/8/2018,"This is one of my favorite breakfast spot in Spanish Harlem. I am all about eating healthy... but I like to balance out and have other options. So If you're looking for some great tasting healthy options or maybe a naughtier choice to select from then I HIGHLY recommend this place. I placed my order on line so that was a plus for me so I don't have to deal with the noisy background and I can take my time selecting my order. Secondly the delivery was fast and the packaging was SO NEAT and organized!!!! I'm super organized so this really impressed me. The brown bags were each separated and so nicely folded in with tape, napkins wrapped and folded with no spill from coffee, green juice or milk shake. That was absolutely great! Nobody likes to have a soggy, wet breakfast from the beverages. And lastly, and most importantly the food was exceptional. My son and I are VERY HAPPY with the service.",,,
122,Nasira S.,"Manhattan, NY",12,6,10,5.0,10/4/2016,The food was really good.

125,Tara M.,"New York, NY",0,68,0,4.0,2/18/2017,"I came here today for brunch and was really happy with the food. It's kind of like diner food with a Mediterranean twist, and though the place isn't fancy, the prices and portions are very reasonable.I had the shakshuka, and would be interested in trying out some other menu items. Perfect for a low key brunch with a couple friends, though it's a small restaurant so best not to go with a huge group.",,,
126,Monica B.,"Renton, WA",5,3,0,5.0,2/10/2017,I was early for dinner at La Shuk and chose to stop in for a glass of wine and some hummus here. The place was adorable and had great music playing.

I placed an order as follows...- Iced House Blend Coffee: was good (probably the only reason I gave 2 stars)- 2 Eggs Any Style with Home Fries and Toast [ Scrambled, White Toast ]: the eggs were fine, home fries were more like diced raw potatoes and my white toast was wheat bread and not toasted- Turkey Bacon $3.75,  this made me so upset, over priced for 4 strips and completely burned",,,

137,Jennifer B.,"New York, NY",355,10,6,4.0,8/6/2016,"Effy's is a well priced breakfast option in East Harlem. I haven't tried the lunch yet but the breakfast is a solid option especially for the price (under $10 for large portions). I have gotten the vegetable omelette and added Brie (extra charge) and basil with the home fries and salad as sides. The home fries are great but I didn't care for my salad too much as it was plain and a bit dry. The service here also gets a bit slow when it is busy as it seems they usually only have one server working. The restaurant is pretty cozy inside but there is seating outside as well. Overall a great brunch option, especially considering the going price a few blocks south for the same thing.",2,,
138,M Gerard T.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,19,1,5.0,6/22/2016,"My first eating adventure in East Harlem. What a great start! The spinach, tomato and goat cheese omelette was delicious. Although I would normally have ordered the home fries as a side, I tried to be a little more health conscious and got the salad and whole wheat toast. The salad was the perfect accompaniment and the toast was a treat with the perfectly served butter. Oh yeah, the iced coffee in the ball jar with just the right amount of ice was a big winner for me b/c lately, I cannot seem to find a good tasting coffee anywhere. Service was phenomenal. I didn't want to leave b/c the music selection was so delightful.",2,1,1

Their fruit bowl is a good price for the area. I love the mozzarella  tomato sandwich with fries. The menu overall  has good prices. I've gone here with a few friends ... this is my go to lunch place,3,3,3
145,Madeline R.,"Manhattan, NY",525,11,0,5.0,4/3/2016,Best smoothie and omelettes on the upper east side. But the best part of Effy's is by far the service. I think his name is Gino? He always remembers my name and order. 5 stars!,3,3,3

I've been several times because I WANT to love it, but without fail, there is something wrong with our order every single time. Service is underwhelming.

My friend and I split a mushroom and smoked gouda grilled cheese and the salmon dish. The grilled cheese was hard to mess up and tasty enough, but the cheese was kind of hard - not melted properly. The salmon was a bad cut and a bit tough. The best part of the meal was the mashed sweet potato side which was very delish. There were also little mosquitoes flying around us / our plates the whole time, which was a bit distracting and kinda gross, even though we were sitting inside because the windows/doors were open.",1,,

This being Easter Sunday some places were not open, but that's why we found Effy's.  My wife had the spinach salad w added avocado and grilled chicken, the greens were fresh and the feta was great.  I had the schnitzel sandwich, which is as filling as it sounds.  I ate the whole thing, since it was tasty and served on a grilled ciabatta.  Their mixed juices are very very good.  I had the Coney Island IPA, which I realize is not a juice, and it paired quite nicely with the sandwich.
