0,Mandee P.,"Manhattan, NY",180,123,186,3.0,10/9/2017,"This place is in the same building as my job, which makes it super convenient. Think about those snowy, rainy, far from ideal deals when you don't want to step a foot outside. So the staff is nice and service is good. Sometimes there's a long wait for my food, but that's to be expected on a busy day, and I see everyone in the kitchen working fast and furiously. For the most part, this place is good and has decent food, nothing too memorable or that stands out. My biggest gripe is matching the quality of food to the high prices. I think it's pretty disproportionate. Then again-""welcome to Manhattan"" right?They use La Columbe coffee, which is really good coffee. Pastry selection is decent as well. My go-to, however, is their iced red peach iced tea. Really, as I said, it's the prices that get me, but I've been a few times where a vendor has hosted a ""coffee"" hour. Being that this coffee hour is on the vendor, prices really don't get in the way.",,,
1,Kelsey C.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,35,7,1.0,10/18/2018,"I cannot even begin to tell you how horrible Eet is. My colleagues and I came down to eat there because my coworker was raving about their salads. My other coworker and I had already gotten salads from the Mill but told her we'd love to come sit with her. About two minutes in a super friendly and apologetic employee told us that ""her supervisor said we had to leave because were eating outside food."" We asked her if we could please stay since our coworker had gotten a salad and some sodas (for us!) there. She said she would try. She came back over shortly after and said ""I am so sorry guys, my manager said you have to leave."" Meanwhile, the place was COMPLETELY EMPTY. We went to speak with the manager to try and understand why. She was so rude to us, I couldn't believe she was the manager. She told us that it was the policy, which we absolutely understood. We told her we just wanted to give some feedback because we really wanted to join our friend while she ate, especially because they were empty. (Well work in customer experience) so we politely said ""it just makes us not want to come back here"" She pointed to the Mill bags in our hands and said ""Well, since you eat at the Mill, you can go eat there."" in the sassiest, nastiest tone ever. It was so rude we actually erupted in laughter and said ""oh wow, really!"" and she said ""yeah thats right."" We left immediately. We work in this building with about 200 employees who are all now ""boycotting Eet."" Good luck Eet, keep allowing your management to treat your customers this way and youll be shut down in no time.",,,
2,Lindsey C.,"New York, NY",139,3,0,1.0,2/28/2018,"This place is just sad. Unfortunately it's the only option in my office building so I have been forced to come here on multiple occasions. I'm disappointed every time.  1.) They are painfully slow (when it's not busy) yet have a staff the size of a small army. Have fun waiting 15 minutes for your eggs, every time.2.) Despite recently simplifying the menu and denying even the simplest of modifications, they somehow manage to deliver a different (sub-par) product every time. The staff doesn't know what's on the menu (probably because it's half French, which makes about as much sense as them giving toast with no butter, YUM). One time they gave me a sandwich with half an avocado just on it, as is. THEY FORGET THE BACON ON A BACON, EGG and CHEESE. HOW?!3.) The prices are high in the first place, fine, but they are gouging people and delivering a terrible product.This place has irritated me to the point that I want them to go out of business. It's personal. PLEASE people, give your business to the Mill downstairs where they actually care about customers, always prepare your order correctly and for much cheaper. EET is BEAT.",4,1,1
3,Dana R.,"Jersey City, NJ",452,1,0,1.0,3/8/2018,"This place is actually the most miserable & overpriced DELI I've ever been to. Can't even classify it as a restaurant because it is such a disaster. The staff is rude ESPECIALLY the ""chef""in the back who went out of his way to be disrespectful to costumers over red pepper flakes ?? They make no moderation to any meal--it is basically a glorified school cafeteria. I would avoid this place at all costs unless you enjoy bland food with a side of attitude. EET IS BEAT",2,,
4,Lucy R.,"Brooklyn, NY",40,67,58,1.0,4/18/2017,"Eet (what?) is in the building where I work and yes it is very convenient at times to just run there to grab something quickly but that is never the case. The wait time for anything seriously takes over 15 minutes. Plus to add to the aggravation of waiting, there is a cook in the back who is a complete and utter weirdo.. Winks, calls me 'Mamacita' and I am so annoyed I don't even want my $11.00 salad by then. You can do better for your lunch and skip on by this joke of a restaurant.",4,1,1
5,stephanie l.,"Forest Hills, NY",7,54,86,5.0,5/7/2014,"I think I am hooked!Being a soup person, I have formed the habit of checking their daily soup and choose one of the soup that I like.  I have either done take-out or eat-in at EET several times, and have enjoyed every meal that I had.  Food is simple, delicious and fresh.  Staff members are attentive and kind.",2,,
6,John B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/21/2016,"If you're looking to leave hungry, with a stomach ache and wait 30 minutes for a lousy form of egg beaters and uncooked vegetables... You came to the right place! This place is likely to leave you with a massive stomach ache from the half rotten vegetables and the pounds of salt they use. Thats used to obviously cover the lack of not having a chef and hiring cooks that have no idea how to actually cook. Sometimes they are making a salad, sometimes working register, sometimes toasting the bagels... Working in the building this place is what is supposed to be a convenience but really its less than that. They way overcharge for everything in there and understanding the area of town we are in.. You think they would be able to toss a salad. They skimp you on everything and you should also expect to pay money for everything even a splash of soy milk. Which you need to cover up the extremely burnt flavor of the coffee they don't know how to brew... or its probably from the day beforethis place really needs some help and some restaffing... However should keep the pastry chef! the only thing they can get right. See my sad omelet ""Eet special"" for only the cost of over $6!!!!",2,1,1
7,Adam O.,"Manhattan, NY",74,74,15,1.0,1/4/2013,"If you watch restaurant nightmares or any of those other restaurant programs where they have inexperienced people working in a kitchen (sort of like a bad science project gone worse), than this is it. Being a culinary school graduate this place manages to break every rule in the book, piss off its customers in more than 1 way and stay in business (for now) .They get you in on the convenience factor and that places to grab food in the area are scarce at best. However, if you have ever ordered, waiting 20 plus minutes for anything from a bagel to a salad to a sandwich then you would understand why people hate this place, oh and they are no bargain either! The manager said ""we are a small place with small kitchen feeding the entire building"". Somehow, larger buildings with cafeterias and smaller restaurants seem to have their shit together to make their experience enjoyable. Other than learning to cook, another thing you learn in culinary school is how to manage a restaurant, be organized and keep customers happy and coming back. This place needs to be on one of those shows so bad.",4,,

Updated review",I need to update on the price of breve cortado...... today I was charged $3.75 instead  and found out I was just lucky that the cashier lady made the mistake last time by only charging me $2.50. I knew it was too good to be true...... urgh. I wanted to subtract the star again but I'll let them keep my 3 stars just because the coffee is excellent.,1,1,1
9,Michelle W.,"Brooklyn, NY",549,223,89,1.0,10/19/2012,"One of the worst service experiences ever! If it takes you twenty minutes to get a plain toasted bagel w/butter and jelly order right then you should not be in the food service business. Especially not in NY. I almost left w/out my bagel. I will NEVER go there again, no matter how convenient it is for me (I work in the same building). BTW the owner/manager should consider replacing their rude and dismissive cashier associates with people that actually care about providing customers with efficient, quick service.",3,,
10,Tej-e B.,"New Hyde Park, NY",16,29,8,3.0,8/11/2015,Limited to people in my building.. Nice view for Quick coffee or lunch or even their cookies are fresh made.. They have lots of organic food you can try and even organic drinks ...,,,
11,Rob M.,"Cranford, NJ",14,43,1,4.0,12/16/2011,"I'm a simple man. An ideal lunch for me can be found at the numerous mega-delis of midtown.  Give me a  place with a create your own salad bar along with sandwich station and I'm set for weeks.Unfortunately when work sends me downtown to work at postworks, there aren't many options in the area where you can walk in,  grab a bowl of lettuce and have some random dude take your salad order. Fortunately for me, Eet is such a place.While they do not possess the variety of options that the midtown mega-delis do, eet's ingredients are extremely fresh and I've never walked away disappointed. Their menu also boasts soups,sandwiches, hot entrees, and daily specials. The prices are a little high, but for the neighborhood, worth every penny.If you've been punishing yourself by frequenting Soho Soups for a meal, do yourself a favor, walk into 75 Varick, tell the security you're there for Eet, and hit up the 3rd floor to check it out.",1,,1
12,Minto S.,"Richmond Hill, NY",149,274,10,4.0,7/5/2013,"My review is a bit biased since I work in the building and this place is so convenient for me.  I love there coffee and cookies and come here at least 4 times a week for them.  The food and salads are also always tasty, YES... it takes a while to get the food but I don't mind since it always tastes fresh.  The seating and feel of the place is great.  My only issue is that the magazines on the tables always seem outdated and the items in the fridge area seem a bit overpriced.",1,,
13,Mr. S.,"New York, NY",9,153,4,2.0,1/3/2011,"Kinda like reviewing the food at Disneyland or Sea World.They have a captive audience, or at least it's a hassle to find other viable grub in this part of town, and this is clearly acknowledged by EET.Expect to pay $12 for a salad and $10 for a gnome-sized sandwich.Cheers.PS. Be prepared to wait for an eternity for that precious booty to be prepared.",2,,
14,Jessica S.,"New York, NY",4,25,1,3.0,10/3/2013,"pretty good for the most part - overpriced, but that's to be expected in this neck of the woods. i work in the building, some i'm there for convenience's sake.employees are mostly friendly, but i have a gripe about the salad bar. for a $10+ salad, they skimp MAJORLY on the toppings, and the guy manning the station (the least friendly of the bunch) mixes the salad with his hands! granted he has gloves on, but ICK. come on, dude. and the grilled chicken is really ligament-y. disgusting.bottom line, come here for the coffee, fruit and sandwiches. skip the salad, it's a major rip. and did i mention the guy tosses it with his hands?!",,,
15,Christine K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,3.0,2/6/2015,Love you guys but really wish you could get a better process for the coffee orders.  Seems like it's very hit and miss whether or not the barista hears the order.  I often have to remind him/her what I'm waiting for.   Looks like there is a new process with names on cups -- that seems hit/miss too.   Not everyone has a cup with their name on it so their orders were being overlooked.,,,
16,Kathy H.,"Los Angeles, CA",23,58,2,4.0,4/16/2010,"Are they a little pricey?  Yes.  Is the food worth it?  I would say yes based on what I've had there.  Plus it's convenient - I work in the building, so on days when the weather is ungodly, it is just a quick little stroll.  I've only ever had lunch, so I'm a stranger to any of the premade stuff.  My favorites so far - pulled pork sandwich (messy but oh-so-delicious) 1/2 roast chicken w/ 2 sides (always couscous & roasted sweet potato), and the studio south panini.  A friend of mine swears by their ""make your own salad"" bar.  What you don't know about eet - they're owned by Splashlight Studios, which is on the same floor.  It began as the catering arm for the people and clients (ie. photographers, models, and their ilk) of Splashlight when they were in the wilds of Chelsea, but then they decided to open up their eatery to the public when they moved to the current location.  Recently they opened up their catering business as well.  If I need something catered and I can work a good deal with them, I'd definitely do it.  They do good food.",1,,
17,Erica M.,"ASTORIA, NY",53,11,4,3.0,2/7/2012,"Limited menu and food is all right enough to grab if you don't want to leave the building.  It is expensive, though.  Lunch on average can cost you $12-$15 total.  But your options are limited if you work in the area.Breakfast sandwiches are delicious, though.  And will run you about $7.",1,,
18,Sunil G.,"New York, NY",8,145,17,4.0,4/12/2012,"This is only for the coffee and baked goods. I believe the coffee is from la colombe which needs no review.

19,Phillip M.,"Manhattan, NY",236,14,0,1.0,7/11/2013,"always really slow and over priced  waited 30 min today to get an omelet for breakfast with no one else in line  got back to office is wasnt even what i had asked for, the FOH is supper nice and helpful but yeah the grill guys are a joke not wasting my morning here again",,1,1
20,Melinda C.,"Paterson, NJ",0,12,0,2.0,12/13/2013,"Pros: In the building and has good coffee. Online ordering available  Cons: Pricey, poor service.Unfortunately the cons carry greater weight than the pros here. More specifically, I've had several experiences where I was waiting long periods of time, staff saw me waiting for this long period of time, and staff pretends not to notice. I went to pickup an online order today that was not ready (had placed earlier and was given a time). It took about 15min for my sandwich and soup to come out (they were not busy). Customers came in, ordered, and got their food while I waited. The person that I spoke to when I first arrived, never told anyone else I was there, or waiting. They never acknowledged me again. On another occasion, I waited during a very busy morning for my drink. When, after waiting until I noticed people after me receiving their orders, I asked about my drink- I was told that it had been made, but they would make another. 1. Don't make the customer out to be a liar- even if you think they are.  2. I was standing there, and at no point did my drink order come up (no one else ordered a red eye).Food is OK at best, and less so for the price. Today I had a rotting avocado on my sandwich. All in all- not worth the prices and inconsistent service.  A last resort for building dwellers.",,,
21,Casey C.,"Woodside, NY",10,44,10,4.0,1/21/2011,"I really like this place. Yes it's overpriced, but what isn't in this neighborhood? At least the food is delicious. I particularly love the Caesar Salad, the Burger and Fries, and the Tomato Basil soup. Though I wouldn't venture here if I didn't work in the building temporarily (it's kind of hard to get to if you don't) it's much better than other stuff in this sparse area.",,,
22,Alexandria V.,"Staten Island, NY",117,77,2,3.0,11/10/2008,"When I first started working in this building, I came here all the time.  However, I slowly began to realize that their foods off the shelf by the drinks is really not good but the food I would order from them to make fresh is delicious.  If they would just improve their shelved food (I've had their sushi, wraps and yogurt that they make and they're not that good), they have the potential to be awesome.  The store-purchased yogurt it good though.Their service is really friendly.  Their establishment is clean and has a cool lounge look to it.My favorite picks so far are the eet burger and the marinara pizza for lunch.  Their egg and cheese on a roll are delicious and if you like feta and mushroom frittatas, those are also awesome for breakfast.",,,
23,Amber B.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,10,0,2.0,1/23/2013,"*sigh* I dread writing this review because I really did love EET for the convenience, the personnel working there and it's the only place around this area to get a fresh green salad. However, it has been poorly managed for quite some time. This is a pricey cafe. Today I paid $10 for a salad that could have been considered a glorified side salad. I usually get a salad because Miguel (the salad chef) is very friendly and he tries to give a little more food that what he is supposed to give. However, the portions have been decreasing by a lot, leaving me hungry after eating. Also, the quality of the food has gone down, noticeably. The greens haven't been fresh, which is surprising considering how long the salad line usually is. They go through greens like crazy. The portions for their daily specials have also gone down quite a bit, while prices have remained the same or have increased. Sadly, I've begun looking elsewhere for my lunchtime meal because I just can't justify paying so much for such a puny meal (and no, I am not the type to super-size anything, I do not abide by the Standard American Diet. I am a very active person and I need to eat). Sorry EET. Just not feeling the love these days. :(",,,

Updated review","Once again this place is a total disaster! It is so disorganized and the wait over 20 minutes for a BOWL OF SOUP.  That was all I was asking for, the manager would not walk over and pour it, instead she said the wait was 20 minutes. I seriously don't understand this place. They are sitting on a gold mine due to it's location and lack of eateries in the area, but can't get this sh*t together. It is so frustrating to deal with.",,,
25,Amy J.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,5.0,4/1/2010,"This place is awesome. The friendly staff always makes me feel welcome and is very accommodating. The food is always fresh, delicious, and they have tons of new items constantly. I dig eet. Mmmm...try the sweets. They are super tasty.",,,
26,Par T.,"Brooklyn, NY",16,31,0,3.0,8/25/2008,"This place is on the third floor of the building I work in so I tend to eat here occasionally.  The food can be hit or miss, the egg sandwiches in the morning are pretty darn good, the wraps around lunch time certainly aren't my favorite and I would not get them again.  I am currently eating the pulled pork sandwich which is so messy that you should eat it with a fork and knife, but it's worth the trouble.  I will eat at Eet again since it's so convenient, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.",2,,1
27,Joanna M.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,5,0,1.0,3/3/2010,"I have tried to like this place after they renovated and came under new management, but I AM SO OVER IT. I've given them five chances, and I just left there, once again in a SUPER BAD MOOD... When they were open before the renovation, the food was really delicious, slightly pricey, but definitely yummy. (awesome burger, delicious steak sandwich, great chicken sandwich, and my personal fave, the margherita pizza...outstanding! My co-workers absolutely drooled over the cupcakes, too..)Now, it is nothing but incredibly rude and slow service, (I just ordered a salad, and it took about a half an hour, while I counted six employees sitting around doing nothing, not to mention three people came in after me and ordered salads and got them before me. And we were the ONLY customers in the joint. ) Once I went in just for coffee, and when I went to sit down, a man (who I assumed to be the owner) said I couldn't sit at that table, but sat me at a table next to it. He acted like I was planting a bomb or something. The next time I went in for coffee, I couldn't even see a single person that worked there. I waited for a few minutes and gave up and left. This was at two o'clock in the afternoon. And how about $15.00 for a cheeseburger and fries? The cheese was AMERICAN on a friggin' beef patty. Just awful.The thing that absolutely burns me the most is that this is a restaurant INSIDE an office building on the third floor. It's not like they have a sign or an awning outside to even let people know it's there...Are they even interested in making money or keeping customers?? Personally, I will never EET here again, and I will tell all of my co-workers to avoid it as well... (and yes, they are super bummed about the cupcakes!) A total thumbs down all the way.",,,
