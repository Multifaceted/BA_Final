0,Jessica G.,"Larchmont, NY",70,127,367,5.0,9/11/2018,"Great find in the heart of midtown! Perfect lunch spot if you're looking for somewhere close to Grand Central. I scoped out the menu beforehand of course, and knew I had to try one of the homemade pastas! Specifically, I had to try the cacio e pepe. I wanted to take half home, but it was so good that I couldn't stop eating it. The sauce wasn't heavy at all, and the pasta was so fresh and delicious. They could have used a bit more pepper, but overall it had a really nice mix of flavor. I shared the pulled pork tacos with my coworkers and they were SO good. There was a really nice amount of lime and the flavors bursted in your mouth for real.My one coworkers likes splitting desserts so we split the tres leches cake with fresh berries and coconut shavings and whipped cream. Delicious!! I've never had tres leches so don't have a comparison but so light and fluffy and the flavor was the perfect bite with a little bit of coconut, berries, cake and whipped cream. When you had each component in one bite the dessert escalated!!",1,1,2
1,Nancy H.,"New York, NY",231,814,2139,4.0,10/12/2018,"Perfectly fine as a business dining place - lunch or dinner. I'm pretty sure 90% of the clientele are from JP Morgan. Everyone is middle aged and above.The hostess is sexy, the lights dim, cramped yet intimate seating, and I'm sure they deal with snobby business people all the time because the floor manager has fire in her speech.Vitae is known for their complimentary duck fat rolls which come out piping hot in a mini cast iron. Fantastic rolls. Their online menu is only a taste of what they offer in house.*Long Island Duck Breast - served two ways, pan fried breast medium rare with a deep fried leg of perfectly flaky duck meat, over a bed of brussel sprouts, pomegranate garnishings, and a citrusy sweet potato *Burrata - creamy, came with two small crostinis and light green sauce*Charred carrot - one long charred carrot on a bed of greens and quinoa, it was good, interesting take on eating your vegetables*Fig Salad - small, figs were good, arugula mix, honeyed almond topping was great*Grilled Octopus - forgettable, texture reminded me of...octopus in a can*Veal meatballs - like any other large meatballMy fellow diners also ordered the Halibut, Risotto, The Vegan, and Filet, all of which were polished off save for The Vegan.Wine per bottle was about $70 and we started with white and ended with red. Dessert rounded the night off and due to the tight seating and lack of the 2016 bottle of Sancerre we were comped the almond semifreddo and panna cotta when we ordered the mango tres leches and chocolate torte. Hands down the only dessert that should be ordered is the almond semifreddo.To top off the night we were sent home with a complimentary Vitae peanut butter m&m cookie. Not bad for a $600 dinner tab.At another seating I had:*Lobster Canelloni - two rolls of lasagna sheets stuffed with lobster and crab meat in a light but creamy tomato sauce, forgettable and not very special (I can get 2 lobster rolls for the price of this dish)*Crispy pork belly - forgettable, dry, and unflavorful*Grilled shrimp - also forgettable*Panna cotta - this panna cotta was much smaller than the one we were comped at the second dinner and much more flavorful with fall spices",1,,1
2,Thom H.,"Syosset, NY",162,525,164,3.0,9/24/2018,"I'm having trouble making up my mind about Vitae. Wife and I ate at 6:00 on a Friday evening in September. We were welcomed by shelves of individual apples in the front vestibule, which was cute, and also smelled of apples. Nice touch.We were seated in the corner booth by the kitchen (there seems to be a pattern with us being seated by the kitchen, it's starting to piss me off ...)One would think that a corner bench would allow for a lot of room, but not. Wife and I are both 6 feet tall, and so the space was tight, and I was sitting uncomfortably on the seam of the cushions. Not the best seats, by any measure, and there were plenty of seats to be had (all cheek-by-jowl, though).Service was spotty, despite the place being almost empty. Our waitress was running around, though it was unclear why, as there weren't many tables to help. She was nice, at least - I'd almost rather that, than fast w/ sass. Mind you, sass I can handle, if I've a drink in hand - but that took a while. Again, inexplicable - the bar was pretty empty too.Now I've seen a lot of reviews, pro and otherwise, that talk about the decor, and high ceilings. Sorry, I wasn't impressed. To me, the space screamed 60's, and not in a good way. But my wife liked it, so i guess it's me.The menu had a lot of interesting combinations, with some standards. I love grilled octopus, but I went with the grilled peach salad instead, b/c of the season. I guess peaches were just out of season, as my (pre-??)grilled peaches clearly came from the walk-in. Was expecting the warm vanilla sweetness of a grilled peach, got the blah bitterness of a chilled one.That said, the kale salad it came with was good, especially b/c of expertly toasted sliced almonds (people, toast nuts whenever possible). So, toasted almonds, but cold peaches? See above about being undecided about this place. My wife's beet salad was tasty but really only b/c the beets were - beet salad has become such a standard that it's hard to mess up.As for entrees, the burger was a real standout. There was tons of flavor in the beef, one of the best burgers I'd had in recent memory, hands down. I liked the fries, though they could have been crispier. Good flavor. But my wife got the veal meatballs for her entree - pedestrian marinara, and meatballs so one-note, I think the turkey meatballs in my kitchen freezer have more complexity.We each got an almond treat at the end, & a cookie to go, both on the house. Thanks. I got the impression that the desserts were good (waitress pushed the fact that they were homemade), but I was stuffed, as was my wife.So in the end, some really great parts to Vitae, and some real duds. I almost feel like I want to come back, just to see if our experience was an off night. After all, it's midtown - there's nowhere to eat. In fact, if I were in midtown again, I probably would come back to Vitae.",,,
3,Leo O.,"Queens, NY",198,504,1567,4.0,8/24/2018,"Never been here before but came here for a business dinner with 9 people. They sat us in the upstairs area. It was really nice and the chairs were super comfortable. I had the grilled summer peaches for appetizer, filet mignon for main course, and chocolate torte and meyer lemon bar for dessert.One thing about the grilled summer peaches, I thought the dish was too salty, probably from the feta. Also probably due to the uneven distribution of the cheese.  The peaches were sweet and it was definitely needed to balance out the dish. It just wasn't enough. They should add something else to help cut the saltiness down.For the filet mignon, medium rare was cooked perfectly. It was easy to cut through and very tender. The thumbelina carrots were a nice addition, just too few I think. I thought the pommes puree truffle thyme panade was excellent. It was just the right amount and it tasted good with the meat.The dessert was also good. I'm not a big dessert person when it comes to chocolate and lemon bars but both were needed to help balance each other out. The service was excellent as well. The staff were extremely attentive to our needs and were very courteous. Overall, I would come back here and try something else. I would definitely recommend this place.",,,1
4,Ingrid H.,"New York, NY",57,96,92,3.0,5/11/2018,".This place is so average but so expensive. I mean, I came with work so our meals were covered but unless someone pays for my meal, I wouldn't come here myself.There's nothing wrong with the restaurant or food per say. The place is nicely decorated and on a weekday lunch 80% of the patrons were wearing suits. We made a reservation and was quickly seated. We started with appetizers including bread rolls with duck fat (seemed just like shiny bread), pulled pork tacos (small but good I guess), veal meatballs (tasted like regular meatballs but were $18), and pork belly (go to ktown to get better ones) to share. Then for my own, I got the the cacio e pepe. Let's get this straight. I LOVE pasta. Pasta is my favorite food/food group, whatever. I can eat microwaved pasta and be p happy. This pasta was no bueno. It was salty and about halfway through I was kinda tired of it (literally never happens with me and pasta). After I finished it I felt a little sick. I think it was just too oily and salty :( Overall, just an okay place. I feel like New York has so many other great restaurants that are similarly priced. If you must come here don't order the pasta. The meat dishes my coworkers got looked better.",,,

Updated review","I came here with two friends for dinner. Turns out, the bar had a happy hour, but the restaurant doesn't. One of my friends got there before our whole party arrived and made this known as we sat in the dining room.  I had no shame. My one friend always had wine from the bar, so she was not asked about a beverage. The waiter asked my other friend if she wanted a drink, she said,  'No, we will both wait' as she motioned towards me.Then, the waiter proceeded to ask me if I wanted a drink. I couldn't lie, so I just flat out said, 'No, I'll be going to the bar to get the happy hour price, thanks.'He didn't like that, so he took our wine glasses off the table and clanked them loudly together, in anger. Then walked off. Completely rude and extremely unprofessional. Idgaf if you didn't like my response or if you talk about me after the fact. I'm not paying double for the same wine and cocktails at the table that's on the happy hour menu. That's crazy. Don't like it? Then don't work in an establishment with this setup or don't work during happy hour.We did partake in happy hour and then proceeded to get a bottle thereafter.Our server remained rude and annoyed by us throughout our entire dining experience. He got upset yet again when my friends just wanted to get appetizers and asked about the portion sizes. They caved and got entrees instead.We were appalled by the waiters' attitude during our visit, but we didn't let it ruin our dinner. Shoutout to the bar staff, who we told the situation to, and were more than willing to accommodate our drink requests.I'll come back for happy hour, but my friends and I won't be recommending the spot to others based on our server. Too bad because the food, wine, & cocktails were really good.",3,,
6,Raymond C.,"Irvington, NY",0,8,0,5.0,11/8/2018,Great new American food and well crafted cocktails. Been coming here for years. It's my go to spot for after work quick bites or full on meal!,,,
7,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3653,952,2096,3.0,12/10/2017,"Food- 2 out of 5Service- 5 out of 5Ambiance- 3 out of 5Came here for a bday and I thought the staff did a great job of making the bday girl feel great. They had a menu that said happy birthday on it and also brought a dessert out for her. Awesome service and i appreciate that since they didnt have to do that.Now comes the review on the food... nothing really wowed us. We started with the pulled pork tacos, octupus, and beet salad.The pull pork tacos were ok. The taco was not crunchy enough and it lacked that punch of flavor that pulled pork normally has.The octopus was an over complicated dish that could have been better if it had a more simple preparation. It doesnt look appealing either with the squid ink rubbed on the plate.Beet salad was the highlight of the appetizers. The beets were prepared well and it was a refreshing salad. They should stick to this theme, let the ingredients shine.For entrees the cavatelli was prepared well and served al dente like it is supposed to be. Solid dish. The udon noodles dish was not my favorite. The meat tasted like it had been sitting out too long. Not a great dish overall. The halibut was also over complicated with a charred top that added an unwelcoming bitterness to the dish. If vitae simplifies their dishes this place will be better but after trying a lot of different things this place did not hit the mark. They need to let the ingredients shine and this place will improve.",5,,1
8,Trevor M.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5,176,260,4.0,12/20/2017,"Great overall meal. The bread covered in duck fat oil was fantastic and the crispy pork belly appetizer was amazing. The whole menu looked impressive, but I eventually settled on the ultimate udon bowl. I highly recommend the bowl as the poached egg, lamb dumpling, crisply pork belly, house broth, and light veggies were a delicious combination. The restaurant was definitely expensive, but the quality and quantity of food was well worth the cost.",2,2,3
9,Maria G.,"Boston, MA",100,1005,5012,5.0,11/27/2017,"Excellent lunch.The food was excellent. My server was so nice and talked me into the burrata ($17, creamy polenta, wild mushrooms, garlic chips). There were so many flavors to it and I was completely sold on that dish. For entrees, I'd say the seafood selection is better than the meaty ones. I will definitely opt for seafood on my next visit. The bread was also a highlight, the flavor must be from the duck fat. A meal to be remembered, for sure. Bathroom is super clean. There are two unisex ones located right by the staircase.A well deserved 22% tip indeed. I was here for lunch so opted out of the wine on this trip. Next time I will. Can't wait to be back.",13,12,13

Had a glass of savignon Blanc  which was fresh, bummed I didn't ask what brand they used. I had the fried oysters as an app. Definitely different. The service was also great. Very nice staff. Elizabeth the hostess was so friendly and very attentive. If I'm ever in the neighborhood I'll stop by again.",4,2,3
11,Terence L.,"New York, NY",334,73,2,4.0,5/30/2018,"Came here for a work event recently and was pretty impressed! Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by a wall of apples, which I thought was pretty interesting. The rest of the restaurant decor was very hip and nicely done. The food itself was pretty good too! I got the duck breast which was amazing and the pork belly appetizer was great! It was a bit pricey but overall a great experience.Definitely recommend if you are in the area!",2,,
12,Sunny C.,"New York, NY",92,155,93,4.0,12/11/2017,"Ive only been here once, on a Friday night so I'm reviewing their dinner service. Place was a bit noisy but not too loud and the crowd was a mix of business people, friends, dates, and some from out of town as well.The bar area was gorgeous as was their dining room. I loved the entrance which had a wall of actual apples! Food: Very meh and overpriced. I had the tuna appetizer and duck breast entree but found both to be very average. The duck had a lot of fat around it so when I removed those areas, the portion became even smaller.Service was horrible! Seemed like just a handful of people working both levels of the restaurant. Good, classy ambience but for the food, you might need to pregame your dinner before coming here:)",,,
13,Peter L.,"Jersey City, NJ",215,123,174,4.0,6/30/2017,"Vitae is your typical sleek 5th Ave restaurant. It appears as modern, swanky, and upscale all at the same time. The decor is simplistic but has enough to keep you interested and sets the right mood for a meal.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and made some incrediblely delicious recommendations. For the starter, I went with the beef buns which is shareable for 2 people. I decided on the chicken for the main. The beef buns were ABSOLUTELY delicious. This is by far my new favorite bun in the city. The bun is stuffed with a ton of beef but also a lot of different veggies/seasonings that give it an extra punch. It literally looks like summer in a bun and taste just as amazing. The portion of 3 pieces is also relatively large, I was pretty satisfied after having 2 pieces.The chicken is also to die for. From the outside it looks very basic, chicken over some veggies. However the moment I had a bite I knew I was in love. The chicken was perfectly cooked, leaving it super juicy on the inside and the skin crunchy on the outside. The veggies that came with it was okay, nothing to special worth talking about. The chicken completely overpowered it and won the day.Since this is a 5th Ave restaurant, expect the prices to be pretty up there. Apps run anywhere from $10-$15 a dish and mains can go up to $40 per dish.Overall, great place for lunch. It can work both as a place you take clients or a date night activity. Great service and delicious food will definitely have me coming back.Pro tip: Make sure you have a reservation, it gets really busy.",3,2,2
14,Maria L.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,6,0,5.0,8/15/2018,I love this place! I don't usually write reviews I just love this place so much !!I work at JP Morgan and it's super close to my work.My coworkers and I usually pass by this place but never really noticed because of the scaffolding until my friend recommended! We came here for drinks but ended up getting dinner because food smelled amazing!Manager was super friendly. she was engaging with her guests and always smiling love her! Like she told me they are drinks are seasonal which is amazing cause they had such an amazing collection for summer It was super breezy! ( my favorite drink blueberry lemonade) and favorite food was pasta lamb sausage cavatelli  Just amazing deff going back for another round!!!,,,
15,Harry Z.,"New York, NY",67,9,20,5.0,7/25/2018,"Pleasant place overall during the weekday lunch hour. The decor was beautiful. The food was a bit pricey but overall good, and came relatively quickly. The crispy chicken was delicious and the pork schnitzel is flavorful (I'm less of a fan on that, but I think it's more about my taste). Good if you want to treat yourself on a busy day, but certainly not everyday stuff.",,,
16,Bella G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,9,0,2.0,6/28/2018,"The 2 stars are for the kind, attentive bartender andsmiling welcoming hostess who presumably have no control over pricing at their establishment. I have been here before a couple of years ago when I bartended in the neighborhood myself, and remember liking the drinks, french fries and ambiance so I popped in for a quick cocktail before an appointment. Much to my utter shock, I was charged 20 dollars for a Titos vodka and soda. This is outrageous even by midtown Manhattan standards- I didn't order some sort of specialty cocktail with rare or premium ingredients. I ordered a mid shelf vodka and club soda! It immediately dawned on me why I was the only sucker in the place at 4 pm on a Thursday. Nice ambiance and staff, but unless you have a Michelin star these prices are a joke. Will NEVER be back because I'm not an idiot.",1,,

18,Edward M.,"Manhattan, NY",203,238,1439,5.0,10/21/2017,"Having seen the top tier reviews on Yelp, but also seeing the top shelf prices on the menu, I had long ago chalked up Vitae as being a restaurant that I could only dream of. But once we got  the company to pick up the tab for a team dinner, everyone's first choice was Vitae! Having started with warm bread rolls, sweet and coated in what we later discovered was duck fat the meal continued to get better from there. Throughout the entire meal, service was impeccable, with waiters coming around to refill wine glasses and make sure that there were no issues. For an entree, I picked the duck breast, which was served with brussel sprouts and bacon (a winning combo no matter how you slice it). The duck, served on the bone, was absolutely fall apart tender and elicited a well contented, guttural, primal moan for the deliciousness of the meat.There is no doubt that the prices here are astronomical and make you question what parts of the meal are going to be served on gold plates, however it is a well deserved treat.",4,3,3

20,Heather C.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,8,0,5.0,4/4/2018,"Hopefully this review can be updated soon, but for now is regarding setting up private events at VITAE, specifically with the help of Anisha and Chef Bellanco.Anisha has been incredibly helpful, responsive, and kind throughout our communications for a fast-approaching business dinner. As I moved forward from the west coast and was unable to do any sort of a preemptive site visit, she and Chef were attentive and made sure to offer photos of event spaces and set-ups, as well as specific options for any of our guests with dietary restrictions as he created the evening's menu. They were also gracious in working within our budget, which fluctuated considerably during the planning process. VITAE also offers customization of event materials (signage, menus) and the option to run presentations in their private dining areas.I would highly, highly recommend seeking out VITAE, Anisha, and Chef Bellanco for any event you're looking to host in the future!",,,
21,Johnny C.,"Queens, NY",139,16,6,5.0,5/25/2017,"My wife made a reservation for my birthday. The dining experience was elevated with a 10 out of 5 service. We decided to go with the 4-course meal for $75 and were filled towards the end. Each course was presented and explained well,  and a new set of utensils were brought out to fit with the course ahead. Ambiance is beautiful as other reviewers would say, but I was pleasantly intrigued by the wall of apples which offers an aromatic scent as you enter and leave the restaurant.  Kudos for the out of the box, yet simple experience. My dessert came with a candle and I'm glad it wasn't accompanied with a crew of servers that would sing happy birthday, instead I was given a bag of housemade cookies and a personalized birthday menu!Superb dining experience; thank you Vitae!",3,2,2
22,Erin A.,"Brooklyn, NY",3,14,0,1.0,9/25/2018,"Terrible experience. Water started pouring from the ceiling onto my lunch. Literally all over the table and onto my food. It took flagging down two waiters to move to a table. They could see that I hadn't eaten. No apologies, no offers for more food, no discount or comped items. I would have spoken to the manager if it weren't that I was on a business lunch. Appallingly bad service. There are so many nice restaurants in midtown...I'll never eat here again!",,,
23,Joy J.,"New York, NY",111,40,147,2.0,11/28/2017,"For the most recent visit I would give 3.5 stars; the 2-star rating is the result of comparison with my visit about 3 years ago. I've always liked their interior design. Some seats are intimate and romantic and other tables are good for big groups. The sevice this time was flawless, which felt like a big improvement from last time (although I don't know if it was bcuz I came with my bf this time, who is a white guy, while last time I came with my girl friend so we were two Asian girls). The biggest let down is the house roll, not in terms of the quality, but the price. Ever since my visit to this restaurant 3 years ago, I've considered (and broadcast) it to be the restaurant that serves the best pre-meal bread in NYC - yes, the delicious house roll used to be served for free. So you can imagine how surprised I was when I saw it on the dinner menu and was sold for $6. The substitute for the house roll to be served before dinner was... It was hilarious and almost irritated me - two small pieces of potato chips! And not even as tasty as Lays! I really don't think keeping serving the house rolls for free is gonna hurt their profit much, especially considering that they charge pretty high for their petit portion of food. So to me, this was a pretty low movement. One good thing was that the entrees we got (duck breast and whole trout) tasted better than the one I got before (diver's scallop).",3,1,
24,Joyce H.,"Astoria, NY",10,48,10,2.0,3/15/2018,So I really wanted to like this place but couldn't for the following reasons:Drinks were super expensive without being at all remarkable. Wine list is very basic.We asked for tap water but were served bottled water for $13!I ordered pasta which was cooked properly (al dente) but was very bland. My friend ordered grilled octopus which was served cold.The food was served suspiciously quick - obviously not cooked fresh which you would expect for the price. Do yourself a favor and give this overpriced hole a miss.,,,

Also they personalize the menu for my husband and I which is the moment so I would treasure forever. They started out with a delicious tasting of oysters and short rib tacos and New England style clam chowder. All were extremely tasty. The pork belly was everything sweet crispy that was a really delicious appetizer. And the scallops was oh my God slap your mama Good!! My husbands filet mignon was delicious as well so tender and juicy and the seasonings. I'll wait a recommended a delicious cocktail call the pink all in all it was a well-rounded wonderful meal.

There were rose petals on our table when we were seated with a menu that said happy birthday on it and the staff offered us champagne on the house. They really made my boyfriend feel extra special. We shared a bunch of appetizers as well as the cacio e pepe and steak. It was great! We werent able to get dessert because we had to catch a magician show at the Lotte Palace but the staff brought us dessert anyway and sang to my boyfriend. Such a great find.

30,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4582,2943,9008,4.0,8/15/2016,"Have you ever been to a timeshare presentation? Well, it is to be avoided at all costs.My wife ""won"" some plane tickets, and the catch was that we had to sit through a two-hour sales pitch about some awful scam. I warned her that this was not a victory in any way, but after it was clear she wasn't giving it up, I insisted we at least go to Vitae for dinner afterward (since it was nearby) to salvage what was sure to be an awful evening. Please believe me when I tell you that dinner at Vitae is the only good thing that has ever come out of a timeshare presentation. A Short List Of Things That Are Great After Timeshare Presentations:1. Alcohol. I got a Vesper, because liquor mixed with more liquor was necessary.2. Vitae's beet-heavy steak tartare.3. Vitae's light and balanced hamachi crudo.4. Vitae's hearty pulled pork tacos.5. Vitae's impeccable service. Not only was everyone swift and accommodating in all things, but they also shower you with gifts from the kitchen (and you know I love the lagniappe). We started with an amuse bouche of a nice crisp, we were given a pastry and a delightfully palate cleansing drink in a tiny glass bottle with our check, and then we were literally chased down the street with complimentary cookies...after we had already been given complimentary cookies by two other staff members.I must admit that I was a bit disappointed in the cacio e pepe. Although the red pepper-infusion gave the pasta a gorgeous color, the dish was lacking (especially at this price point). I realize the beauty of cacio e pepe is in its simplicity, but the flavor wasn't there and $28 is too much to pay for bland noodles. If they hadn't been out of the chestnut agnolotti it might've been a different story, but we probably should've rolled with the summer risotto. Ah well, there's always next time.",22,25,15
31,Elaine H.,"San Francisco, CA",1226,1749,5633,4.0,8/11/2016,"The second I saw the apple wall at the entrance, I knew instantaneously that the chef/owner Edwin Bellamco must have worked at Bouley, during some part of his life. I was correct. Have horned his skills at Gramercy Tavern, and later the French Laundry, Edwin must have possessed some unique cooking techniques.I cannot wait but to bring my co-worker from Hong Kong here, and we opted for the tasting menu. Though claimed as four courses, we were more than stuffed even after the pasta part. Of course, my favorite out of all dishes was the Long Island duck, the sour cranberry sauce was perfectly marinated inside the duck meat that balanced out the savory; not to mention the grilled brussel sprouts. Another highlight of the night was the palate cleanser - made from ginger juice yet not at all overwhelming, kind of like drinking soda.Hmm how should I summarize my meal? The whole tasting experience was fine with no doubt; nevertheless I felt like this place was a bit lack of characteristic. Sure I have tried many decent courses, yet how to make each single one of them stand out remain a challenge.",13,9,14

Updated review","A great restaurant I would definitely recommend. I went for lunch with my husband and friend. I especiAlly enjoyed the grilled peaches with the turmeric sauce. I could definitely taste the turmeric sauce and it went really well with the peaches and the greens. The salmon, one of the main dishes, was cooked to perfection with bits of crunchy vegetables although the sauce was a bit on the sweet side. My main dish was the seafood crepe which had a generous amount of crab and other kinds of shredded seafood in the crepe. Kale, brussel sprouts and broccoli rabe sides were also excellent and the portion was generous. The atmosphere is upscale/business and I would recommend going for dinner.",2,2,2
33,Nicole L.,"Boston, MA",5,204,145,3.0,12/27/2017,"I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could. To start we got the pear, grape, and almond kale salad as well as the beet, pistachio goat cheese salad, which were both pretty good. My husband got the beef tar tar w/ quail egg which he liked and my sister got the octopus and said it was tasty. For a main, I got the red pepper fettuccine (vegetarian version) which everyone else at the table loved, but was too right for me. The table also got the lamb, and the lobster/crab canelloni was a big hit. For dessert the table got a chocolate torte and cheesecake. Beware of gingerales costing $6 per glass! The menu rotates regularly, so don't fall in love with anything (I had my eye on the grilled fig sadly). I thought the chocolate chip cookie to go was a nice touch, but not sure it made up for the prices!",,1,

Started off with a bottle of red wine, then opted to share 5 appetizers and 2 mains amongst the four of us. We had the burrata, steak tartare, tuna and hamachi crudo, foie gras, and crispy pork belly. All of them were absolutely DELICIOUS, with the tuna and hamachi crudo and the crispy pork belly as the stars! As a main, I shared the udon with my friend, which I have to admit was the most underwhelming part of the meal. While it was good, I felt that i have had better udon at other places, and frankly, you shouldn't really be getting udon at a new American restaurant anyways, although I commend the effort in making it interesting! Last, we had some cheesecake which was good but not outstanding.Definitely a pricier meal, but the food was delicious!",2,2,2
37,Eric A.,"Brooklyn, NY",505,274,1594,4.0,6/29/2016,"Located in Midtown just an avenue shy of Times Square, Vitae is one of those relatively still undiscovered gems in the city. They offer great food and drinks with a very trendy ambiance and yet because they're still not quite as famous yet, you can easily score a table or a seat at the bar when many other Italian establishments in the city are fully booked to capacity.I started off with their burruta. It was very fresh, and milky creamy, surrounded by diced cherry tomatoes in a green sauce. it was light and refreshing, perfect for summer.I then ordered the full plate version of their Cacio E Pepe. They offer both a small plate for $18 and the full plate for $28, and while I normally save, tonight I was starving so I had the full plate. If you've never had cacio e pepe, its essentially similar to a Carbonara pasta except they usually don't include an egg yolk in the cacio e pepe, its a very simple but delicious pasta with just pepper, pecorino and parmesan cheeses emusified in olive oil to create a really creamy sauce. The version they offer here at Vitae was just superb. For dessert I ordered the white chocolate ricotta cheesecake a la mode. The cheesecake was decorated with chocolate pearls, whipped cream and seasonal fresh cherries. What sets this place apart is that they lightly warm up the cheesecake in the oven to give it an even more intense flavor. For the gelato, I had a trio of 2 vanilla scoops and 1 chocolate chip scoop. Very creamy and decadent.To end the night I ordered a warm frothy cup of Cappuccino.",10,8,11

I believe I had the Beef Tenderloin, which was very filling!Nice choice of wine. Well-lit bar, great selections. The service was great (nothing worse than having to constantly look for your waiter).

41,Colleen B.,"Indianapolis, IN",114,104,211,4.0,4/25/2016,"What a fantastic dining experience at Vitae! My family visited NYC this past weekend and this was our first restaurant of the trip. I had read great reviews on Yelp and loved the modern decor of the restaurant, as well as the eclectic menu.Our meal began with a sampling of a potato chip with a sour cream and chive sauce. It was a great presentation and had even better flavor! We ordered the duck fat rolls, fried oysters, veal meatballs and the pork steamed buns for appetizers. I do not have a bad review about any of these choices! My favorite were the pork buns. They had a spicy and tangy sauce that truly made them delicious.For dinner, I selected the lamb loin. It came with a sweet potato purée and heirloom tomato reduction. The lamb was cooked perfectly and so tender. Two other members of our party chose the ground lamb pasta, while two others chose the duck confit. The lamb pasta was the favorite of all! It was truly delicious. Everyone greatly enjoyed their meals!I definitely would give this restaurant 4.5 stars if I could. My only complaint is that they were out of a few bottles of wine we had requested with dinner. Other than that, this meal was simply amazing! It was a great start to our NYC trip.",3,3,4
42,Sarah P.,"New York, NY",168,84,30,5.0,8/3/2017,"After reading various reviews on yelp raving about Vitae's excellent service especially for special occasions, I decided to make a reservation for our 1st wedding anniversary. I used Open Table for an easy reservation process and added a message to let them know what we would be celebrating that day.From beginning to end the service at Vitae was IMPECCABLE. As soon as they brought us to our seats the hostess handed us personalized menus that said ""Happy Wedding Anniversary"" (although it was addressed to Mr. & Mrs. MY MAIDEN LAST NAME due to my unchanged Open Table account name... sorry hubby). The manager then personally poured us complimentary glasses of champagne while we perused the menu. We opted for the Chef's tasting menu of four courses ($75) and our waiter made sure to ask if we preferred any specific meal items (I specified a scallop dish).The meal itself was nothing mind-blowing but delicious enough, and they made sure to include a scallop dish for me. I liked how they provided my husband with different dishes than mine other than the appetizer so that we were able to try more dishes.At the end they made sure to personalize our dessert with another ""Happy Anniversary"" message on the plate. The cherry on top was our goodie bags filled with DELICIOUS cookies with personalized stickers (they were printed with VITAE *heart* our couple name) to take home with us.Thank you Vitae for making this wonderful occasion so much more special. We will never forget it!",3,2,2

Glad they were small portions.Beet salad: 2 stars- have had much better.  It was unmemorable.Pork belly appetizer was tender and by far the best of the night!An off night, perhaps.  Or just ordering the worst of the entrees.",7,1,4
44,Jennifer S.,"San Diego, CA",4,66,7,4.0,7/10/2017,"This restaurant surprised me, I was expecting overpriced mediocre food. I choose this place very last minute and still got a reservation on Saturday night. The great Yelp reviews and scallop dish pulled me in. Overall great service, decor, and food. Dishes we tried :House bread - dense and soft, couldn't really taste the duck fat.Croquettes - wasn't too impressed. Texture of shredded meat with foie gras flavor. The bed of pickled beet and Green onion over powered the croquettes.Ultimate udon - liked the texture of the noodles. Meat tasted amazing, soft and flavorful pork. The broth was a tad underwhelming with a strong shiitake mushroom flavor. Scallops - loved this dish. The curry isn't over whelming so the flavor of the scallops still shine. The scallops were seared perfectly, and the soft texture and portion size is worth the high price tag. The only downside of my dish, was that one scallop was over salted. Donuts - nothing spectacular, but the bread was very soft. The cleanest tasting donut I've ever had. Overall I think the food is slightly overpriced, but you won't be disappointed. The only thing that irked me was paying $14 for a glass of wine that costs $22 for the entire bottle.",3,1,1
45,Sachin S.,"De Pere, WI",96,96,48,3.0,6/26/2017,"Meh. The prices are up there with higher end NYC restaurants - around $60/person - but food is okay. I went there for a business dinner with 4 other people. We had a few appetizers: octopus, tuna, pork tacos, king crab. The portions were very small. Almost ridiculously small, especially for the price. Tasted good though. For the main course, some of us had the halibut and others scallops. Both dishes were good. For wine we had a Pasos Robles Cabernet, which was excellent. The drink selection was wide, but expensive. Many reviews here mentioned the service. I was surprised to find the service totally inattentive. Twice we had to get up and ask the waiter to come over. The restaurant was busy but conversation was audible. Nice ambience.",4,,

47,Victoria X.,"New York, NY",536,602,528,4.0,12/7/2017,"I've walked past this establishment many times now and finally had the chance to try it today for lunch. We had a reservation so we were seated promptly as soon as we checked in; they also offer free coat check. The interior is a lot roomier than what it may seem like from the outside looking in. For a party of 3, we had two orders (4 pieces per order) of the infamous house rolls coated in duck fat. I had the whole brook trout and was pleasantly surprised that the bones were removed from the fish, and that made the whole consumption process less messy and a lot easier, which is ideal for a business lunch. For dessert I had the maple cheesecake, which was delicious and better suited for two; don't be like me and try to finish one all by yourself. Service was great and professional throughout the entrée portion of the meal, and I liked that I didn't have to ask to have my water glass refilled at all. My only complaint would be that the wait staff stopped refilling my water once dessert was ordered, and this was when I needed it the most to wash down all the sugar!",3,2,4

I felt so dumb because I waited until day of to make a reservation, and found this spot which was able to take our reservation!First off, drinks are so good!! The Pink Drink was the most refreshing cocktail I have ever had.  All of the drinks I tried went down so smoothly and were absolutely awesome. We had like 6 appetizers, with the rolls (which tasted like hawaiian rolls, and were of course amazing), the crudo (tasted so fresh), steak tartare (again, tasted so fresh, and the parmesean chip to pair it with was perfect), the veal meatballs (really good), and the beet salad (which was also refreshing! and a good light starter). The complimentary chips were actually really good, but honestly a little humorous at the fact that everyone in your party gets one potato chip for free. Still very good though. Entrees were all really good, I had the halibut which was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Everyone also had a mini palet cleanser which was a sparkling raspberry drink. Overall REALLY amazing meal, and would come back again and again and again.",2,1,1

We were very impressed with the food and service. The menu featured scallops in curry sauce and since I don't care for scallops I asked if they could make halibut with the same preparation. They were happy to accommodate us and the resulting dish did not disappoint. Our party also had a risotto and a cannelloni, kale salad and beet salad. All were delicious. After really enjoying the salads and main entrees, we tried three desserts - chocolate flourless torte, cheese cake and strawberry rhubarb. Not a bite was left on our plates. Truly deliciously prepared desserts. Since it was our daughter's birthday, they printed her a special birthday menu to take home, and brought packaged chocolate chip cookies for us to eat the following day (some of which didn't last that long). Very special touch. We also loved the iron work pattern in the wall accents, which was repeated in the custom carpeting, and the beautifully lit wine wall. Overall, we were thrilled to have found such a great little gem a few blocks from our hotel in Times Square, which will remain on our faves list.",2,2,2

Crostini and pesto were good.Main course:-I had the Cacio e Pepe. Let me say that my Cacio standards are extremely high as I just came back from a trip to Rome, and I had this dish almost daily there. While this Cacio e Pepe had a bit of a different taste to it with the red pepper fettuccine, it was Incredible and I am still thinking about the deliciousness of those noodles. This dish is something SPECIAL. Pasta, noodles, butter, egg, pepper, cheese = you cannot go wrong!-My friend had the salmon and I had a bite of hers. I thought it was average at best.- The chocolate chip cookie at the end was a nice touch!I recommend this place and will definitely come back, even if just for the Cacio!",1,1,1

The pink drink is also very different and you don't really taste any alcohol (maybe that's a bad thing). However the king crab is less satisfactory. Crab itself is really fresh, yet the sauce is so sour that I can barely finish it. Aglonotti is meh. The complimentary dessert (something like almond macaron?) is fantastic.",,,

I have never been treated so amazingly at a restaurant no matter what the occasion. It all begin with a special menu printed just for me with Happy Birthday Jessica in the middle. Our waiter was very nice and and attentive. We both started with drinks, I ordered the down east cider (my new favorite) and my fiancé ordered a beer. For our appetizer we ordered the rolls with duck fat and sea salt. When they put the rolls down on our table you could smell them instantly. I've never had duck fat before let alone on rolls and I have clearly been missing out. The rolls tastes just as great as they smelled. Not only did we get rolls but since it was my birthday they brought out a trio of appetizer samples for me and a sample for my fiancé. On my plate was an unbelievable potato chip, fried oyster and the pork taco. I don't eat oysters so I gave that to my fiancé but the potato chip was out of this world and the taco was delicious! For our meal I ordered cacio e pepe and my fiancé got the ultimate udon. Just like the appetizers the meals were fabulous. I was really excited to try the red pepper fettuccine, and now I am hooked. I wish I could buy those noodles they were so good and unique. My fiancé was in heaven with his udon and was so happy with his choice. Between dinner and dessert they brought out a little taste of a watermelon raspberry drink that I wish I could buy it was so refreshing. For dessert we ordered the chocolate torte. This was probably our least favorite thing because it was just so rich and thick, yet delicious. They also sent out the dulce de leche cheesecake for my birthday and that was fantastic. I usually don't like dulce de leche but this was outstanding. To top it off after the meal they brought us a little goodie bag with some cookies with personalized stickers that said happy birthday Jessica. In my opinion, everyone needs to come here. I have never felt so special and appreciated at a restaurant before. This is definitely the best place to have a celebratory dinner. They truly go above and beyond here, thank you!",3,1,3

From the moment we arrived on a Friday night, service was spot on! The menu is printed daily, so the menu we looked at online was different than the one we got- a great surprise to see some different options. They accommodated our dietary restrictions and allergies- and communicated well with the kitchen and staff. The waitress was very attentive & helpful. For appetizer we ordered the burrata which was comparable with per sei And Daniels- fantastic, the grilled octopus had great flavor and prepared very well, for entree, our waitress recommended the Trout which was outstanding. I am so glad we tried this place and we will definitely be back",,,

63,Jon L.,"Brooklyn, NY",172,125,310,3.0,1/7/2018,"Came here Saturday night at 830pm. The place was literally empty. The most awkward date ever. From 830pm to 11pm when we left, there was only 1 other table of 2 people in the entire 2 floors. Reading some of the reviews makes sense why. Many other yelp reviews mentioned how the place isn't what it was 3 years ago. That makes sense. We paid $400 for 2 tasting menu dinners. They sucked. I could swear some of the dishes were microwaved, like the pasta dishes. The risotto was so thick and hard as it got colder my date made a joke that she could beat me with it. You could've cut the risotto with a fork and knife. The other dishes were ehh. Desert chocolate cake and cheesecake were hard and not that tasty. Overall he venue is large and gorgeous. 5/5. The service was decent. Both our servers English was limited so we couldn't understand what any of the dishes were when they explained them. The food is 3/5. Especially considering the price. The value is 3/5 also. At these prices you can eat at a Michelin star restaurant. This place is like an imitation 1 star Michelin at full Michelin pricing. I won't be back.",1,,

65,Joy G.,"New York, NY",1168,787,153,4.0,8/21/2016,"The best grilled salmon I've had in recent memory. Initially, I picked Vitae because of its proximity to the office but I knew I made the right choice when I saw the words ""duck fat"" on the menu. Seriously, get the house rolls with the duck fat. Buttery-sweet and insanely decadent, one roll should be more than enough. Being the ""Beets. Bears. Battlestar Galactica"" person that I am, I had to order the roasted beet appetizer. It came with giant chunks of red, yellow, and pink beets - combined with the generous dollops of goat cheese and pistachio, it actually stuffed me quite good. Which meant that I only managed a few bites of the sesame crusted salmon but it was sufficient for me to discover that I needed to eat more salmon in my life. Passed on dessert because my dress had gotten uncomfortably tight. NEXT TIME: pulled pork tacos, butternut squash risotto, seafood crepe, more of the duck fat rolls, the salmon (!!)Postscript: I really liked the wall of apples even though some of them had acquired that sad crinkly look that dried out apples get",5,3,7
66,Nidhi S.,"Philadelphia, PA",262,3,2,1.0,7/12/2017,"My experience at Vitae left me scarred. I was delighted at 'scoring' a reservation at this upscale, exciting looking 5th Ave restaurant on a summer saturday night. But of course I got a reservation - apparently everyone else is in on the joke that Vitae actually is. The interiors were promising, the restaurant mostly empty. The food was disappointing and disgusting. A seemingly grilled octopus appetizer was essentially raw flesh that sent a spray of salt down my throat. I still gag at the thought of it. My Cacio e Pepe was neither Cacio or Pepe - it was thick, dry and sad fettuccine pathetically garnished with chives. I looked keenly for the cured egg yolk, pecorino and parmesan broth that were promised on the menu - 0 luck. I'm all for creativity, but why mess with classics to such a disgraceful extent? My one star goes out to the service - the waiter was kind enough to replace the napkin I had to spit my octopus into.  Save yourself the time, money, and pain. Just don't go",,,1

68,Dennis J.,"New York, NY",13,773,33,4.0,8/14/2016,"Solid meal in the area. We stopped by as a party of four on a week day evening, and the place was fairly busy. For appetizers, we split the bread, fried oysters, meatballs, and the octopus carpaccio. The bread in particular was outstanding, as was the octopus carpaccio. The meatballs were also decent as well, while the fried oysters were just alright although fairly well prepared. For entrees, we split the cavatelli, scallops, and duck breast. The scallops were extremely fresh and the tasty (although a fairly pricey entree), and the cavatelli was also pretty tasty and freshly made as well. Overall, it was a very nice meal with well executed dishes, and I'd recommend coming here for small/medium sized groups looking for a nice, quiet meal.",3,3,3

70,Irina B.,"Atlanta, GA",48,203,1,3.0,8/25/2016,"So... This place is calling itself a wine bar, but the selection of wines by the glass is extremely limited (precisely two reds that are not Californian).The food was good for what it is, but seemed a bit overpriced. Apps ~18 (very tiny), and entrees around ~$40. While the food tasted great, I just did not feel like the value was great for the experience.In addition, our table was attached to the wall, and inside of it something was vibrating - perhaps the AC unit. All of our food and drinks were vibrating throughout the entire experience. If I may suggest, a table that can be pushed away from the wall might be a better solution here.Overall, I don't see myself going back - too many better priced options around, and this is not onn top of my list.",3,,
71,Laura O.,"Manhattan, NY",320,529,28,4.0,6/2/2016,"I work not too far from Vitae but had no idea it even existed before some friends picked the spot for a dinner last Saturday. Sometimes one must marvel at the sheer number of restaurants in Manhattan.We were a group of 7 adults and one small child. The staff was incredibly accommodating to everyone's needs throughout the meal. And yes, the classy interior impresses. To start, I had an old fashioned, which was sweeter than most but still very good, and made with high-quality ingredients. We also ordered a number of appetizers, two of which I tried:-Rolls brushed with duck fat: Good, and the duck fat was a nice alternative to your usual butter or oil, but I don't know that it did all that much for me.-Pulled pork tacos (polenta tuille, tomato marmalade, avocado mousse, lime creme fraiche): Good but smallish. My favorite part of the meal was my main dish, the chestnut agnolotti. From the cheesy chestnut filling to the prosciutto parmesan broth, each bite was a gift.  The crispy prosciutto on top added a nice umami flavor contrast to each agnolotto.We were also gifted with extras, including the ""amuse bouche"" potato chip, little after-dinner (raspberry?) soda bottles, and a take-home chocolate chip cookie. Gotta love those little touches.",4,4,4

I had the cod with lobster and squid ink pasta. So good. Started with the burrata and polenta and a side of the duck fat dinner rolls. Finally when we got the check, no dessert but they have us these little fruity palette cleansers in a mini coke bottle with little almond biscuit and a chocolate chip cookie. The small things count. Bill was $97. Would definitely go back.",4,2,3
75,Vicky F.,"Tampa Bay, FL",137,468,294,5.0,4/10/2015,"Great environment and I'm surprised that it's not as busy as I thought on a Friday night.Many things that I wanted to try by the previous posts were no longer on the menu. But that means they are constantly changing menus, creating new dishes, and that's a good thing ( drinks and food). I asked about a strawberry cocktail that someone posted a few months ago and the server told me that the strawberry is not in season so they have raspberry drinks instead.I had Crystal Green (a gin cocktail) and I loved it! For appetizer, we had the pork belly and the borrata. Wonderful! But I was full after them. So I would recom ordering only one appetizer to share if two girls are going for dinner. Plus they gave you a small sample taste( a little spoon for each person) and I loved it!I had small portion risotto for entree but I was already full so I took home the rest. But it was really good and creamy. I think the duck was a little overcooked, not in the way that it's dry, but rather too soft, so it lost the chewy part of duck meat.Servers are very attentive! Five star!",6,1,2
76,Emily R.,"New York, NY",94,82,180,4.0,4/7/2016,"Get yo *life*, Vitae!Two points to those that get the Latin reference there.Anywhoo. After Tommy Bahama was packed to the seams, came here with a work colleague to catch up. There aren't tons of options in central midtown, but I remembered coming here for lunch and it was nice. It was busy here too for a Wednesday night, or maybe Wednesday is the unspoken ""hang out with work peeps"" night and I missed the memo.The hostesses were pretty nice. Despite the fact that we didn't have a reservation, they assured us that the two businessmen at the bar would be leaving soon and we could take their seats. 15 min later we were still waiting even though there was one empty chair and one chair full of coats from a group of girls who were waiting to be seated. Rather than ask the group if they would like their coats checked and giving us the seats, the hostess asked us to wait. Ten more minutes go by and we are seated. She apologized and we kept it moving.From there things were splendid. Our bartender/server had all the Cs: cute, courteous and chop-chop service (totally just made that up but it works). He remembered my allergy from the one time I had come here months ago! We ordered sparkling rose, two appetizers, two entrées.My dishes were great. Tuna crudo was cut very thin and the hijiki provided a nice contrast to the mellow flavors. I got the lamb sausage cavatelli which was creamy goodness with a hint of spice. My friend enjoyed her pulled pork tacos and agnolotti. We scarfed down those naughty duck fat rolls too. And to top it off, they gave us the cutest lil coke-bottle palate cleansers! Yep, we *lived* at Vitae. Ok I'm done.",5,5,4

She always claimed the opposite: ""It should be the only way. Live your life and surround yourself with great friends.""Last night, my wife, my friends and I (total group of 7) dined at Vitae and were pleasantly surprised. We left drunk, bellies stuffed and satisfied.The entire staff whom we encountered were all fantastic; front of the house, the bartenders, Molly and her manager Liz (Elizabeth) were friendly, courteous, polite and warm, while providing attentive service. A+We chose the chef's tasting option, which was a wise choice (please see my camera phone pictures). We were not sorry, except that it proved TOO MUCH food for us. I put my ego aside and waived the white flag. That homemade bread with duck fat? You had me at hello. That duck dish. Oh lord. Foodgasm in mah mouth. Some of the amuse bouche were ""redonkulous"": rich bites of umami heaven. Too much to recollect now, but our chef's tasting was topped off with decadent desserts. Molly and Liz were our servers and they answered all of our questions and made sure the wine kept flowing... IN VINO VERITAS? Indeed. Let's wine, dine, laugh and create new beautiful memories for the rest of our lives.Thank you ladies for a great time. Molly, we can continue our debate on which Justin Bieber song is best suited for dancing. Also, if I miss you, good luck to you and your husband on your future endeavors. Something tells me Vitae will lose one of its MVP employees very soon. *groan*Dearest ""Lizzie"" if you continue to sweet talk me (even with my wife right beside me) with your Korean vocabulary the next time I return, I will have no choice but to kidnap you and introduce you to my family. You have been warned.I will come again with my wife for a date night. This restaurant is TOO GOOD to be overlooked. Thank you Vitae for your hard work and perseverance. It has paid off and manifested itself in a beautiful symphony of great taste and service. Amen.",11,5,7
78,A Z.,"Boston, MA",0,14,0,1.0,6/6/2018,"This place is overrated, not worth your money, and hackneyed. Facade. This warm spirit of vitae, is falsely conveyed, not even within the duck fat bread. Save your money and go somewhere else, in a city full of eats.",,,
79,Sha P.,"Manhattan, NY",7,67,101,2.0,8/11/2016,"Came to this restaurant for date night with high expectations. We decided to start implementing date nights into our busy schedules, and we thought Vitae would be a good place to start. Service was good as everyone else mentioned. Waiter was very attentive and even fixed the positioning of our plates. Decor was also very nice.My bf was a tad bit late finding parking in the area. I saw the hostess in the front giving out cookies as patrons left the restaurant. So naturally.. i expected a cookie after dining at Vitae.. but did not get one. Bummer :(Also, everyone mentioned the complimentary palate cleansers at the end of the meal. Nope..once again disappointed. They are now on the menu for $8 :(Waiter did give us a shot of watermelon gazpacho - on the house. Nothing special...but was nice to be offered something complimentary. Ordered the burrata ($18) and pulled pork tacos ($18). Burrata was very good but my bf didnt care for it and basically let me lick the plate clean. The pulled pork tacos were very cute and tiny and was the only thing that we ordered that night that had flavor.For entrees - I got the lamb sausage cavatelli ($28). Im all for al dente pasta..but the cavatelli was not cooked. In retrospect, i should have sent it back to the kitchen. It was so hard and kinda hard to swallow (Woah that sounds so wrong. :] ). On top of the pasta not being cooked properly, there were no burst of flavors..just meh and bland.I made my bf finish the plate. Def not worth the $28.Bf got the duck ($36)... usually duck is aggressively seasoned at other restaurants but it was under-seasoned at Vitae. It's so strange because i normally complain about restaurants foods being too salty. First time in a while where i thought something was truly under-seasoned. Maybe the kitchen was having a really off day. Maybe next time...if there is a next time.. Most probably not... we'll just order appetizers..Got the nutella chocolate cake for dessert, hoping that something sweet would mask the disappointment of flavors we've experienced throughout dinner. Wah. Bottomline: Food does not justify the price. Fortunately, there are sooo many other restaurants in the city.",1,1,

Updated review","Vitae is my favorite restaurant in nyc. They treat you like your a VIP yet as if your home. The servers are very knowledgeable and pleasant, the hosts are very warm and friendly, the bar tenders are so social and entertaining, the food is top notch in both its presentation and taste. Chef Edwin is simply amazing. The bread is addicting, the sea scallops will have you moaning and the warm cookies make it a treat to cheat. Lol. And what can I say about the GM Liz? A most amazing host who really knows how to operate such an A-list venue and it's staff. She rounds out the entire Vitae experience. So warm, friendly and yet such a professional. It wouldn't be Vitae without Liz.  Enjoy!!",2,2,2
81,Matt R.,"Waterloo, Canada",3,46,222,2.0,11/19/2016,"Went here because the reviews looked good and it was close to the hotel. We arrived for a 9:30 reservation and the place was quite empty, a bit of a warning sign for NYC. Since it was a bit late, the wife and I decided to order apps and share. The first 2 to come out were the veal meatballs and the poached pear salad. The meatballs were good, but a bit cold. Very saucy and would have been better with bread, which we ordered, but it didn't arrive. The salad was missing some acidity for balance, just tasted a bit bland. Other than that it was good.  Next we got the burrata and mushrooms, the steak tartare, and the broccoli rabe.  The burrata was an awkward overly salty dish that needed bread. Honestly I've never seen a burrata dish without bread. It was more like a mushroom and burrata stew. To quote my wife ""they ruined burrata for me"". The steak tartare was mixed with beets and served with parmesan crisps. Ratios were way off, not nearly enough crisps. It was ok otherwise.  The broccoli was over seasoned - way too salty, we didn't eat it. Then finally the duck fat rolls arrived. What do I eat this with now?We skipped dessert with disappointment. The service was a bit awkward too. We left feeling the price was off the mark for the experience. Honestly wouldn't go back, or recommend it to friends.",,,

The servers and bartender are doing a great job of making everyone feel welcome. Environment is great place for date, mingle, hangouts and celebrations. Five stars for those...For the foods, we got the pork belly, duck breast, whole trout, fries, brussel sprouts, and chocolate cheesecake for dessert. Everything was good but the trout was the problem...it was over cooked and lost it freshness flavor...I am very picky when eat fishes, it is my favorite food of all...I didn't send it back because I dislike wasting food...and another thing is the brussel sprouts order was missing til we finished the entrees... other than that this is a great spot for gathering!",2,1,1

Updated review","Pretty interior inside. Good service. I cams here with a group of 4 other people. Good place for a team/group dinner. I got a cocktail and it was tasty. We ordered several appetizers (steak tartar, veal meatball, fried pork belly, and burrata) - small portion, and my favorite was burrata. I had duck breast as my main entree. Duck meat itself was tender and good flavor - but it was salty to my taste. What i liked most about this place was their complimentary apricot juice and baby-size macaron AND cookie!!! Apricot juice comes in a super cute tiny bottle with a straw - too cute.",2,2,2

88,Xq B.,"New York, NY",8,26,5,3.0,5/10/2017,"We're trying to find a place to eat near theater district so we can walk to our show the last minute on a Saturday night.. So this is a walkable and not booked 4-8 restaurant so we chose it. They change their menus quite a bit, or their website menu was not up to date.. so I had a few surprises lol. First there no 18/28 pasta portion splits anymore but all are $25 a piece. Cocktail was all one price also($14 I think?), and they don't carry some that I wanted to try any more(no jalapeño infused liquor?? ) For appetizer i had steak tartar, dh had the crudo,  both tasted pretty good, could definitely use more crisp on my tartar lol. There's a lobster pasta offered so I chose that and my dh got the lamb pasta, he said the flavor was ok for the pasta but he left a lot of the pasta itself, and he's a carb guy! I liked my lobster rolled up pasta quite a bit since they put a lot in it! I had 3 drinks and the most impressive was the something ""spring"" one, it's pretty and tasted fresh and sweet. Oh they pushed the duck fat rolls.. it's just rolls I can't tell the difference even if its butter  All and all I think it's good choice if you're in a crutch, the decor was nice and trendy, food and drinks were good albeit not out of this world, we still had a nice time there, and may go back if other choices were not available ;)",,,

My boyfriend made a rezzie at Vitae and I called ahead of time to ask if there was anything they could do to make the night really special. Michelle, the amazing woman who answered the phone, delivered! She asked what the occasion was (celebrating bfs new job) and asked if there was a company logo. When we got there, our table was at the secluded upper level, with no one around us. The table had a congratulatory card addressed to my bf with the company logo. The dining experience was amazing because our waiter, I don't remember his name but he was a dapper man (evening of 2/13), was extremely attentive and gave excellent recommendations. We mistakenly got an appetizer we didn't order, but instead of taking it back, they gave it to us on the house. Two things at the end were the cherries on top of a flawless customer service experience: they gave us the dulce de Leche cheesecake for dessert on the house and a bag of cookies emblazoned with my bfs new company logo!

90,Ryan K.,"Cranford, NJ",78,192,0,3.0,7/28/2016,"I can understand why someone would rate Vitae four stars, but I couldn't quite get there.Food: the chef certainly knows what he is doing and he has built a pretty interesting menu. There were a few of us there. Appetizers included the beef in sticky buns which were awesome, the tacos which were also awesome, the veal meatballs which were fine, but not even in the same ballpark as the veal meatballs from Osteria via di stato in Chicago, and the raw octopus which was surprisingly refreshing, delicate and tasty. Entrees included the seasonal risotto, the scallops and the salmon. No complaints anywhere. I had the risotto which was served with shrimp. It was good. I might even get it again, but it didn't blow me away.Service: pretty good, but could have been more crisp. Had to wait a little for water refills and one of the apps was very late. But our server was polite and appeared clean.Atmosphere: kind of hip, but professional, clean, pretty open, comfortable, maybe a little loud, but it worked fine for me.Misc: pretty good menu. They had some crazy udon dish that I would have like to try or see. The apps were legit. Plenty more I would try. If we had awesome service, I could have probably convinced myself to offer 4 stars, but that didn't happen. That said, while it's a little expensive, I'd probably go back for a work lunch.",,,
91,Andrew F.,"Manhattan, NY",25,21,11,5.0,1/27/2017,"Where to begin... This place is outstanding! I went here on a Thursday night for a work dinner with a group of 13 of us. Let me start off by saying that the service is excellent. One of the members of our party is Kosher and the waiter made it his mission to make sure he was able to eat certain things (Will go into more detail later). This place is very expensive, so if you are on a budget, go elsewhere. Apps... Wow was their menu great. I could eat almost everything on their appetizer list. Before we got our appetizers, the waiter brought the table single chips with some kind of sauce and specks of prosciutto. The server knew our person was kosher and had one chip made without the prosciutto. Great extra touch to accommodate him. We ended up ordering the Tuna & Hamachi Crudo which was really good! Tuna was really thinly cut and very flavorful. Beef Buns were also a big hit as well as the Crispy Pork Belly. I will say I was a bit disappointed with the grilled octopus, but that was it. I'm not a huge beets person, but I heard that was really good too. For my entree I got the porterhouse Pork Chop. It was delicious! Very fatty and flavorful. I took a bite of the duck which was also very good, although I'm happy I got the Pork Chop. If you are very hungry, go with the Pork Chop as it is much bigger, whereas the duck comes in smaller pieces. For desert, I think they wanted to be clever and told us ""They would just bring stuff out"" which amounted to a cheese cake and chocolate cake. They were decent, not great. I'm a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see the actual desert menu as it would be interesting to see what they had available. Overall, I'm very happy about my trip to Vitae and would certainly recommend it.",1,1,1

Our waiter seemed nice but we had to ask multiple times for more water and he did not check on us once, maybe he was having a bad day, just didn't seem into it. Honestly, he was a downer. Food came very fast (which seems suspect) and it was good, nothing special though. Had the Duck with the endive marmalade. I like my duck crispy, it fell a little short (probably wasn't made fresh). But the marmalade was really good. It was served with Brussels sprouts and bacon. It was more like 5 shaving of a Brussels sprout. I was expecting at least a full one! Also tried the cavetelli with roasted tomatoes and lamb sausage. Tomatoes were definitely not roasted. Also, pretty sure there was supposed to be broccoli Raab in there and I don't recall seeing any. Pasta and sausage were good I guess, kind of bland. We asked for grated cheese and that helped. Got the Flourless Chocolate Torte...now that was good! The bathrooms were disgusting. One was clogged and the other was covered in urine. My shoes actually stuck to the floor. There was an event/party upstairs so I'll give them the benefit of doubt and blame the mess on that. Can't say I'll ever return to Vitae.",,,

We also received crisps with creme fraiche and chives on the house before receiving our food. Our food visually looked stunning.The sesame crusted salmon was medium-rare as ordered and came with a bed of bok choy and sliced veggies. My colleagues told me the following about their dishes: The vegan fettucine had an interesting texture because it was made with butternut squash. The agnolotti was well-made and filling. The steak salad was too rare to one of my colleague's liking so he didn't have any. The waiter took notice and removed that dish from our bill, which showed that the staff cared a lot about delivering great ambiance. Waters were refilled at a constant but not overbearing pace.

To start, they had custom menus printed with ""Happy Anniversary"" and our names on them. I've never seen something like this at a restaurant before. After taking our order, they brought out three complimentary bites of some of their appetizers which were all great. Of course our meals, cocktails, and wine were all delicious.

They were bland and the soup was thin. The pork slices were nicely seasoned but the rest of it flavorless. I asked for red pepper flakes to give it a little something, but on par with the service for the meal, those didn't come for 20 minutes (I timed her), at which point my meal was cold and there was no salvaging it. The decor was nice and the menu had cool stuff on it that sounded good, but they really need to work on execution of the food and better service.

105,Kari g.,"Manhattan, NY",5,166,4,3.0,2/24/2017,"I'll get straight to it:1. Ambiance: typical midtown east business fancy kind of place. A little uptight and serious. Not my type of ambiance but clean and nice. 2. Food was good! 4 star for food3. Prices high. Drinks @20$ each and entrees 40-50 per person. But honestly the prices were high for the fact the service was so terrible. With good service they could get away with it. 4. Service: 1 star. Weak. Very weak. We were a large group and since gratuity was included it was very apparent we got snubbed on service. It was obvious other small parties were attended to frequently. Would I recommend, NO. Based solely on service. It was clear since it was included they didn't bother. we never saw them. No one asked about the meal and we had to flag then down for everything. Shameful.",,,

That all said, food was excellent.  In fact the scallop and lamb entrees were outstanding.  Octopus appetizer solid, but not as impressive.  Bread good too.  Wish we could have tried more apps!Perfect for a business lunch or dinner, maybe having dinner with parents if they're okay with a buzzing, loud NYC scene.  Maybe a special occasion dinner if you're looking to stay in the mid town area.",,,1

I met up with one of my friends here for lunch and they sat us on the edge of the second level, overlooking the restaurant. Service was fabulous and the food was amazing! Wonderful spot for lunch, date night, or celebratory meals.Amuse Bouche: Sweet potato chip with Crème Fraîche, Bacon, and Scallion. What a tease. Although I regard most amuse bouche that way. Either way, very tasty and I could have had a few more chips.They also butter you up with these amazing bread rolls baked in a mini cast iron pot with duck fat and topped with sea salt. Oh my. These rolls are so, so, soo yums. Yeah. Eat these.Burrata ($16): Wild mushrooms, polenta, garlic chips, parmesan. The burrata itself was creamy and delicious, but I loved the combination with polenta. Although both are creamy, the polenta added a different texture. Plus, it was nice with the crispy garlic chips and mushrooms.Tuna and Hamachi Crudo ($20): Hijiki seaweed, Holland chile, sea beans, and Sriracha vinaigrette. This was definitely one of the best crudo dishes I've had. Besides the fact that it's really, really beautiful, I was blown away by the flavors. The fish were fantastic, too.Maltagliati ($26): Lamb sausage, broccoli rabe, and roasted tomato. The maltagliati itself was all right, but I really enjoyed the dish. The broth was additionally lovely.Risotto (Half order; $16): Butternut squash, kale, chorizo, and duck confit. Delicious risotto! I don't typically enjoy risottos with an additional starch, but this was creamy and the other elements worked well to add some richness.",5,3,3

The waiter also checked about any food allergies for the table, which is always greatly appreciated. The table next to ours did one of the tasting options, and every dish they had looked amazing.

We each had different dishes and wine for each course and we enjoyed tasting each other's. Every bite was superb. Constantine knew the menu well and took great pride in extolling the virtues of the chef. He had reason to do so! This was a night of great food, wine and service that we will long remember!",1,1,1

Interesting and contemporary menu and all of our dishes were delicious. One minor point, the risotto was a bit a dente along with the butternut squash. The selection of wine is extensive and our Oregon Pinot Noir wine was delicious.  The deconstructed s'mores dessert was fantastic! It was eaten down to the last bite.

From the beginning, I felt that the staff was extremely attentive and put in clear effort to make my birthday dinner a special one. I was greeted with a personalized menu with my name printed in the center. We ordered the four course tasting menu and right off the bat, the waiter asked if I had anything particular in mind that I'd like to try. I mentioned pasta and throughout my four courses, I always got a little something extra that was pasta-related. The food was very tasty and well-done. Perhaps not as creative as a place like Modern but delicious nonetheless. Portion sizes are also HUGE for a tasting menu. At the end of the dinner, I got a goodie bag of fresh cookies. Definitely the perfect ending! I definitely recommend Vitae to celebrate special occasions.",3,2,3
121,Cara C.,"Sacramento, CA",34,161,5,3.0,9/8/2015,"We had really high hopes for this restaurant for the price and also after reading the reviews online. The ambiance of the restaurant was great. Very modern and classy and the staff was great. Our waiter was helpful and attentive. The food: Everything was phenomenal and creative. We had the octopus and burratta to start, and I had the shrimp risotto, others had a few of the other pastas and scallops. The food was fantastic. The dinner portions were pretty good and the appetizers were small. The bread with the duck confit was amazing.The dessert: Meh. It was not even close to the best dessert I've ever had. We had the pana cotta, the cookie peanut butter bar and the affogatto. All pretty good, but not amazing at all. I'd expect more in that department from a place like this. Also, my boyfriend called a few days before our reservation to give his payment info so that they could run his card to pay for dinner before they brought the check, since we were with a large group and he wanted to arrange to pay for dinner prior to the check coming, he gave the hostess or manager his CC info and was told it would be taken care of and they'd just bring the transaction receipt for him to sign after dinner. Well, they brought the check and he told the waiter that he'd already called to give his info to pay, etc. and no one could seem to find it, which was frustrating and worrisome because it might be sitting around somewhere and it kind of ruined the plan to not have everyone trying to pay when we wanted to take care of dinner. I wish they'd have paid more attention to our request on this and made sure that it was handled. It was good but with so many amazing places in NYC, I'd probably try something different next time. Great location though.",2,,1

We shared that we were going to a show and he made sure we were right on schedule.Burrata and salad to start were both great.

Kudos to Graham at the bar who is one of the best mixologist's around. Terrific craft cocktails and even better when you describe your favorite drinks and ask him to go off menu and be creative. The food is delicious and we left enjoying the burrata, pulled pork tacos, risotto....even if the meatballs were a bit of a miss. The chairs at the table and bar make for some interesting twists and turns trying to get in and out of - but once you are in they are quite comfortable.

There are also a few super comfortable booths in the front near the bar for casual dining. Waitstaff are friendly and very knowledgable about the menu. Food- spectacular and beautiful presentation.

I eat by myself, the only customer in the restaurant due to the hour but I enjoyed every bite. I had the fried oysters and the agnolotti as appetizers but they were both really good..

132,Herb V.,"Lambertville, NJ",0,56,4,4.0,5/4/2016,"A very good choice in Midtown just far enough away from the Times Square area to avoid the theater crowd and tourists.And even though the two of us got there a little late (almost 9PM) still had delicious meals with very courteous and polite service.  Started with the Burrata and cheese platter - very creamy polenta and a nice selection of cheese.  Then on to our main courses - and just could not decide on one of the pasta dishes.  But what an excellent idea - a tasting platter of three: Cacio, Agnolotti and butternut squash Risotto.  Enough of all three to enjoy them and fill me up.  The Cacio was just a touch dry but still good.  Partner enjoyed the cod - a nice portion and prepared well.  And while everyone raves about the duck fat rolls - they are rolls with a glaze of duck fat.  I guess OK, but not to die for...Nice decor, good menu and very helpful staff.  Makes it worth walking the few extra blocks",5,3,3

134,Jeff S.,"Royal Oak, MI",103,292,73,2.0,4/24/2015,"Had a horrible experience here, which is unfortunate considering it was one of the places we were looking forward to the most while visiting NY. The service was not at all what I expected for the price, reputation and Yelp score. Our server was a lunk; zero personality, energy and did very little to make us feel at home. He did a horrible job of walking us through the menu, answering questions, etc. We both got the Chefs Tasting Menu and I must admit, the food was very good. Everything was cooked wonderfully, seasoned beautifully and plated to the level you'd expect. That said, you're paying for the service and atmosphere as well and that's what Vitae was lacking during our visit. I think the check was around $350, not crazy but you can do much better for the price in NY. To be honest, the place was pretty dead for a Thursday night -- perhaps our service was indicative of an overall decline in performance? Hard to say but I don't plan on recommending Vitae or going back. In fact, if you're reading this review and interested in a fantastic Italian meal, check out ViceVersa --- delicious menu, impeccable service and charming atmosphere.",7,2,1
135,Artie S.,"Jackson Heights, NY",1,4,0,2.0,10/21/2016,"Okay... so I'm not gonna lie, the food wasn't all that bad (except for the small portions). But why I will never return to Vitae is the service (or lack thereof). Our party made a reservation, but upon walking in, we were not even acknowledged by the host for a good ten minutes because he was on the phone. To be fair, sounded like he was taking a reservation over the phone, but there is absolutely no reason why we should have waited that long. Once seated.. the waiter gave us some time to look over the menu, but once he came over to take what we assumed would be our drink orders, he asked us right away about our entree orders. When one of us asked if there were any daily specials (the menu was much different from what we previewed on the website), the waiter replied with a ""everything on the menu is good, just pick something.""  After our meal, we asked for the check. The waiter leaves the check on the table then comes back not even 30 seconds later assuming we already left cash/credit card... god forbid we had the audacity to finish our conversation and let our food digest somewhat. Bottom line.. food is not bad, but we did not feel welcomed.",1,,
136,B. C.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,7,0,3.0,1/12/2018,"Okay food, but poor value. The pork croquets were somewhat oily, served on a bed of bland cabbage slaw -- overall unmemorable. The broccocli rabe was better. The squash risotto was quite acceptable, but not something I'd think about after this review. Overall, meh. The by-the-glass wine prices were mind-boggling. Overall, had a sense of being taken for a ride. (This hardly 12 hours after a sublime meal at The Finch in Brooklyn, so the contrast was hard to bear.)",,,

Now both the restaurant and the co-worker are off my favorite list!I ordered the ""Colorado Lamb Loin"" (based on waiter's recommendation as it is 'out of this world') and a glass of red wine. Total with tips came close to $80. Wine was ok, but the lamb dinner was atrocious. It tasted like wood. Amazingly none of them bothered to check on me the entire time I had the dinner until it was time for dessert and/or bill payment. Could have used little more salt and/or pepper or extra sauce to see if it was any better Or would have even considered sending it back for another dish.I left half the dinner on the plate as it tasted like dirt. Nobody cared to even ask if it was ok, or why I left half the (expensive) food uneaten. Talk about quality service. Maybe the specific dish is not worthy or cook had an off day that day. Bottomline, I will never visit this place again. Don't waste your time and money. Not worth it.",2,2,1

I've lived in NYC for 11 years and just stumbled on this gem tonight as I was looking on Yelp for a place in midtown (just two blocks from my office!) to take my friend to celebrate her birthday. I called this morning to reserve and a delightfully friendly host made my reservation for me and he asked if we were celebrating anything. I casually mentioned to him that it was my friend's birthday. When we arrived, they had printed a happy birthday message on my friend's menu with her name-wow! We were so touched. The service from our waitress Elise was friendly, efficient and perfectly executed. The food was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. We ordered a peach arugula salad to start, my friend had the salmon roll dish and I had the vegan entree. All were exceptional. We had the chocolate cake and dulce de leche cheesecake and they wrote a happy birthday message on her dessert plate. The whole experience at this restaurant was so exceptionally pleasant, that I feel compelled  to share a review and not keep this unique find to myself. This place had service that was so genuine...a rare find anywhere these days, especially in the city. My friend and I usually feel we have to leave midtown to find a unique place to enjoy a special dinner, but we now know that this is not true. Thanks for making our night so special and memorable Vitae!",1,1,1
140,Cathy S.,"Honolulu, HI",0,14,1,5.0,1/5/2018,"Very nice lunch in Midtown. A few blocks from Grand Central. Staff was super accommodating when I had to push back the reservation time because of a late train and, even though there was no formal coat check, were able to keep my luggage out of the way without making me feel too embarrassed about dragging it into their chic establishment. They do have a 3 course prix fixe for $35 but you have to ask for it. It is not printed on the menu. Burrata and beet salad equally tasty. Veal cavatelli and steak salad were great. They give you a lot of food - I could have been happy with just the beet salad or just the steak salad but then there was chocolate mousse cake and caramel cheesecake to conquer (and I always figure my eating vompanion's dishes are fair game for me to taste). Not cheap but you know when you feel like the chef likes the same kind of food and tastes that you do?  Well that may be why I liked this place so much. If they didn't have the prix fixe, would have had a hard time picking from all the dishes because all sounded great to me. I'm a big Jean Georges fan and Vitae is similar in style. We got a side order of the Parker rolls but, although they were tasty, they weren't anything special for $5 and it was a bit too much food. Then again, sitting here in JFK looking at a 5 hr delay before a 22 hr flight, I'm glad I had a stellar leisurely lunch to fortify me. $100 without alcohol but bigger tip cuz I had baggage (literally, not figuratively).",,,

Service was on the slower side, in clearing the table and checking on us. Otherwise the great dishes and will be back to try other dishes.  My dining mate also had the ultimate ramen, which she stated was the best ramen she ever had.",2,2,2

We also ate the thin sliced tuna and salmon ap which was great. The steak tar tar was good but the risotto was outstanding. We really had a few bites of each and do not eat that much but the weather kept us inside as did the Nutty Toucans. The bar staff was great, very attentive. We even tried the ricotta cheesecake but only a bit each. All in all we loved this place and will return without a doubt.  Ate here in April 2016",2,2,2
144,Cathy P.,"Town of Brookhaven, Long Island, NY",0,25,2,3.0,12/9/2017,Service was good.  They ask if you would like bread then charge you for the rolls which tasted like packaged dinner rolls.  (They did remove it from the check when we questioned it) They don't have the wine on the menu but offered another at the same price which we appreciated.  Brought out a complementary taste plate before appetizers which was interesting.  Frois gras was totally raw.  I had to spit it out!  Veal meatballs (3) were tasty.  Grilled octopus was also.  Ordered filet mignon at $42 which had a strange taste and had what seemed like left over stuffing from thanksgiving on the top.  I couldn't eat it.  Never had a filet mignon taste this way.  Thought this would be a safe choice.

We went inside and were immediately greeted and coat checked. Then, we were taken to a table upstairs and seated. Soon after, we met our server and were asked if we would like any drinks and what type of water we preferred. After that, we were left to peruse the menu and figure out what to order.This is where our server started to show his...lack of expediency. The rest of the staff that did the busing and delivery of the food were quick and attentive, but our server seemed focused on the table next to us with three girls dressed for a night out. Thus, it took a while for us to have our order taken. It took a while for us to get our check. And so on.  Here is what we ordered, though:Burrata - Creamy and rich with a great taste of wild mushrooms. This was a great starter.Brussels Sprouts - Awesome. Very savory and toasty. Excellently prepared with a wonderful texture.Foie Gras - This was tricky. There were so many extreme flavors and textures on the plate that it took finding the right combination to appreciate the dish. The sweet flavors tended to overwhelm, but the crispy kale was a nice touch.Beef Tenderloin - Not amazing, but good. Asked for medium-rare and got more rare than desired. Also, the beef itself was not super flavorful, but the accompanying veggies and sauce helped.The decor was trendy and modern; the atmosphere was vibrant and energized. Honestly, it was a nice meal even though we didn't enjoy every dish or our server. It is a bit pricey, too.",3,1,2
148,Cher A.,"New York, NY",76,90,3,4.0,4/24/2016,"Sigh every time I want to give this place lower stars... They bring it back up with their selective  good service and amazing food. Ambiance: very new contemporary low lighting place. I like it although I've only ever sat at the booth area at the front. Be warned the booth area at the front has 3 booths that are big and cute that can Fir 4 people however it is manned by the bartender meaning service is much slower cause your bartender is busy serving drinks for the bar AND the dining area at the back. A lot of my beef is with the slow service because they seem to forget the booth people cause our only waiter is the bartender Service: twice I came here, twice the hostess was missing. It was like a game of where's Waldo when it came to finding the hostess. We just stood there with annoyed looks on our faces until someone came. No Bueno. and on service like I said above if you sat at the booths your waiter is the bartender and it is slow. However, they are good with their service. They apologize and give you your drink free if they forget it... Which they almost always do, a few times we had to walk up to the bar and ask where our drinks were. They are extremely nice though, so I have to give them that. Also the first time we went we got cookies... The second time we went we got no cookies..so I have to say service is a hit or miss here, it's consistent I'm having non consistent service if you know what I mean? Bad service for 10 mins good service for another 10 mins, bad good bad good... Food: now here is why although service sometimes lack, they get high high marks for their food. Their food is A+++.Duck fat rolls you get before you start will already start playing games with your pants waist line. It's literally bread rolls washed in duck fat. Yes. Try not to eat all of it even though it's tempting because they actually have good food.- Their fried/pan seared foie gras changes every time we come but it's still good. Whether it comes in a croquette or a whole pan seared pate it is DELICIOUS. I came here the first time and they had the pan seared foie gras and I came the second time looking for it but it wasn't there And they had the fried croquettes instead, I liked both but preferred the pan seared one. If I craze foie gras this is my go to place - their take on ramen is delicious, it has a HUGE poached egg with pork belly, dumplings and some sort of steak meat. Delicious, tons of flavor - the cacio e Pepe is TO DIE FOR. It's not the traditional cacio e Pepe so don't come here looking for that... But TRUST me when I say try this comfort so bad it's good for you creamy goodness. It tastes like it was washed in egg yolk and cream and tons of pepper. Delicious - cod with seafood broth -- soft flaky cod with seafood broth at the bottom, hard to fault this one. A seafood lover will agree -- duck dish , the duck is cooked perfectly with a crisp skin. It comes with bacon... Mmmm it's delicious --polenta side dish. Yummy creamy goodness if you are looking for a heavy side, this is it. I love polenta so this is a plusOverall great great food. Would be 5* if it weren't for their inconsistent consistent service. Stick your hostess at the front like most restaurants do, don't let your guests look for them, and make sure the waiters are attentive to your guests.. Don't make them LOOK for the waiter either and make them forget you. If your guests have a where the heck is my waiter look... Make sure to find their waiter or bartender (in our case) and get them to check on you.If it weren't for your meddling delicious food Vitae I could've gotten away less than 4 stars but I just can't cause your food is amazinggggg!!!",2,2,2
149,Tom B.,"Round Rock, TX",75,247,11,5.0,3/12/2015,"My absolute favorite corporate lunch/dinner spot in the city. Sadly its getting well known now and is harder to get into because it is so good! The bread alone is enough for 5 stars as its covered in salt and duck fat, fresh out the oven. I could have it for appetizer, entree and desert!I usually get a table full of apps to share as the main meal because you can't go wrong with any of them and its hard to choose! My favorites are the veal ricotta sliders and the crispy pork belly. If there was a weakness on the menu I'd say its the pasta's but the menu changes seasonally so there's plenty to choose from.It doesn't get better than this, go there ASAP!",4,2,3
150,meerie k.,"Manhattan, NY",43,20,23,5.0,4/3/2015,"Went for dinner last night with one of my friends, and I have to say I was truly impressed by this restaurant. The staff was very attentive but not overbearing. We arrived for our 6:45 reservation and were seated right away. Both my friend and I decided to go with the chef's tasting which I recommend. We had steak tartare, pork belly, a trio of pasta tastings, duck breast, the lamb, and for dessert the apple brandy tart and chocolate hazelnut cheesecake both desserts came with a scoop of vanilla gelato. First the house dinner rolls. Wow!  Nice and warm and glazed with duck fat and sprinkled with sea salt. It was so delicious. The chef started us with an amuse bouche. A trio of tastings which included something with a homemade sweet potato chip, fried oysters, and a duck confit taco. All were delicious, however I have to say the oysters were my favorite. Our appetizers came out next. The steak tartare was great, very flavorful and almost velvety in texture. The crispy pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious and perfectly seasoned. My friend said it was like trying a new drug for the first time. I wish I could have recorded her reaction. The trio of pastas were pretty great as well. Although I wasn't a huge fan of the Black Pepper Maltagliati, the Butternut Squash Risotto, and the Chestnut Agnolotti were really yummy. At this point we were pretty glad that the dishes were served with some time in between. We were getting pretty full!  The lamb and duck breast entrees were great. Both were perfectly seasoned and cooked to the right temperature. They were both succulent and juicy.They then served us a palate cleanser of mini raspberry lime sodas which I thought was seriously adorable. The desserts were phenomenal. The cheesecake was amazing with perfectly toasted hazelnuts. The apple brandy tart was great as well, with the perfect amount of sweetness.At this point, I had a hard time finishing my cheesecake, but I succeeded! When the check came out they presented us with another treat. Mini elephant ears. As we were leaving, they presented us with yet another treat at coat check. Individually wrapped cookies. I have yet to have mine since I am still so full from last night, but it feels soft and looks delicious! This restaurant has definitely become one of our favorites and we will return soon",3,1,2
151,Shani T.,"Boston, MA",148,232,124,5.0,3/27/2015,"I seriously dream about the rolls here. Every time I come, I eat a tin of them myself. Yup, my arteries are crying, but I ignore their silent pleas because these rolls are just that damn good. Cooked in duck fat, seasoned with the perfect amount of salt, soft to the point they melt in your mouth. Never a disappointment.This place is great for lunch or dinner. A good coworker of mine introduced me to Vitae and we frequent the place for lunch. I've been dying to bring my boyfriend here for a meal on the weekend as well and even wanted to come here for Valentine's Day this year! But alas, due to having my wisdom teeth removed, I couldn't justify such a nice meal where I could only half chew and mostly swallow my food.The entire decor of the restaurant is beautiful. It's classy, but I've never felt judged walking in wearing Toms and some simple t-shirt. The place has extremely high ceilings and is very well-lit. The bar is to the right when you walk in and the bartenders are all extremely friendly. The staff in general are all just superb.For lunch appetizers, I've tried the crispy pork belly and the pulled pork tacos. I could rave about the crispy pork belly all day. I never thought a non-Asian restaurant could make pork belly so well. It melts in your mouth. It's so flavorful. It's perfection. The tacos were also very good!I've had the grilled chicken entree (dellicious, succulent chicken with awesome vinaigrette) and the maltagliati. I'm not normally a fan of lamb, but the lamb sausage is quite tasty.This is a place where I literally just want to try every item on the menu. They put a lot of effort into the presentation of the dishes and honestly everything is just so superb. Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots in Manhattan when I'm feeling like a nice meal.",2,3,2
152,Kerri O.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",84,175,875,5.0,2/15/2015,"I dont give 5 stars review as often but Vitae truly deserves all the praise.  Hubby and I came on valentines day and our whole dinner experience was perfect.  I love the decor when I first walked in, it reminds me of a set in mad men with a very retro style.  Upon checking in with the hostess, I was immediately presented with a white rose.  Who doesnt like to get flowers??? I thought it was such a sweet touch and shows how much they care about their customers.They quickly let us upstairs to a corner seat where we had a good amount of privacy and could people watch the downstairs dining area.  We had the five course tasting menu for $85 and we were able to try all the dishes on their regular menu that we were interested in.  Everything we tried was very delicious even their dinner roll is brushed with duck fat.  I epecially love the foie gras, fried oyster, the risotto and the sea scallop but my favorite is definitely the risotto, the rice was cooked perfectly and it has a really rich squash flavor that I love.  My husband raved about all the dishes he ordered as well.  We were so full after the main entree we had to ask for the dessert to go so I can judge their dessert as yet.Service throughout the night was impeccable.  They were extremely attentive and not intrusive, my kind of a perfect service.  I can tell Vitae cares about every single customers and it really shines through their attention to details.  I left the restaurant extremely satisfied and highly recommend this restaurant!",8,4,5
153,Wing C.,"Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",213,1403,9445,5.0,7/20/2013,"4.5 stars! I've always wanted to try this hidden gem especially since it's only about 10 mins from where we live! Been waiting long for a special occasion to roll around since the price can be pretty steep depending on what you order. Last night after 3 long weeks of 9-7 clinic boot camp and hosting our parents, we decided to have our long overdue Friday date night. Made my opentable reservation at 7:30, quickly switched out of my scrubs, and were seated by 7:50!The decor of the restaurant was very modern and trendy. We were seated in the main dining room. Place was packed and for some reason with lots of Asians our age. They didn't look like tourist either (perhaps they were all like me, we all yelped this place?). Before receiving the main menu, we were given home made sweet rolls in duck fat in skillet pan. They sprinkled a tad too much salt on top. But nevertheless, warm, fluffy and delicious. After deciding we wanted to try the 4 course tasting for 75 dollars, I had to say no to my bread downing inner beast - 3 rolls in 5 mins is good enough. For the 4 course tasting, you are allowed to ask for specific appetizer, pasta tasting,  entree, or desserts. My fiance wanted the restaurant to surprise him for all the courses while I knew I wanted to try the seared scallop for sure. So my only request was for the scallop to be on my appetizer. We were given an amuse bouche - pulled pork taco with mint/cucumber soup. My only complaint was why can the taco be bigger? sooooo good. For our actual appetizer, my fiance got the octopus in squid ink and mango salad? While his dish was good, my seared scallop was AMAZING. I would definitely go back to this restaurant just for the scallop alone (they have it as an entree for $38). The broth was rich in flavor and comforty in every spoon! It took a while for food to come out between courses. Our pasta tasting didn't come out for another 15 mins. We were given mushroom gnocchi, shrimp + green pea risotto and lamb sausage pasta. The lamb sausage dish was way oversalted for my liking so I traded it with my fiance for his risotto which he wasn't a big fan of since he's not crazy about green peas (we are so perfect for each other hehe).  The gnocchi was melt in my mouth good and the risotto was creamy but not too rich. I cleared all 3 small tasting bowls.. then ate all my fiance's leftover gnocchi. He wanted to save belly room for main entree while I told myself I will just make room. Before our entree arrived, we were given a palate cleansing drink - mint,cucumber, cream soda shot. YUM, I definitely tasted all 3 elements - indeed refreshing. We waited about another 10 mins before our main entrees arrived. We tried to guess our main entrees by the utensils they gave us. We were right on the money - My fiance was given the lamb and I expected a fish dish - the artic char. Both beautifully presented and so well made. The lamb was made medium rare smothered with curry/some kind of steak sauce and sided with picked onion and scallion. My fish was pan seared with crispy skin swimming in thai curry soup along with green beans, red pepper, and radish. Both so rich in flavor - this was when I couldn't help and dipped the last roll into the broth and sauce and - devoured everything in sight. Our desserts took about another 10-15 mins to arrive. I guess the downside to getting a custom made tasting was the wait in between courses. To our surprise, our waitress presented our desserts with lit candle and congratulated us on our engagement. What a special personal touch! My fiance was given a deconstructed creme brulee with plum while I was given a blackberry sorbet spongecake in rum sauce. I swear somehow they read our mind - cuz we both ended up loving our own individual dish but wasn't crazy about the other person's. My spongecake was sitting on top of a layer of crumbled pistachio. The texture and taste were beyond words. A little taste of heaven was the only accurate description. When given the bill, we received 4 little pieces of home made sweets - peach chewy? coffee/mocha bite. To my surprise, on our way out, the hostess handed us housemade hazelnut cake/bar to go! What a surprising Friday night treat! Wished we were more dressed up.. because this was definitely one of the best dining experience my fiance and I shared. Will definitely return for special occasions! Thanks for the amazing meal. LOVE LOVE LOVE",3,1,2
154,Meghan F.,"Farmingdale, NY",5,43,0,3.0,7/26/2016,"Went for an early weeknight dinner and had the place to ourselves (until dessert). We started with the steak tartar which was fresh and flavorful. They only serve it with 4 Parmesan crisps, but brought out more without us even having to ask. The duck fat rolls are also a must!For dinner I had the pork schnitzel and my husband had the duck. Both were good. The pork is quite unique, as it comes out in puffed dough. It was a little dry but the accompaniments (cucumber, potato, radish) helped. Would defintely return",1,,
155,Nelson W.,"New York, NY",453,538,935,5.0,3/30/2013,"At its very core, Vitae sets a golden standard by which lunch establishments should be measured. And this is not to say that cocktail hour or dinner is any less amazing. Whether one evaluates by the level of service, ambiance, comfort, or quality of food, each aspect can easily stand on its own merit.A classy, professional, and relaxing ambiance makes it a perfect place for business lunches as much as it does for patrons who can appreciate a fine-dining experience. It is warm and comfortable to provide an intimate experience, with high ceilings and an airy dining room to satisfy as a cozy speakeasy. The servers and waiters are some of the most well-trained, eloquent, affable, and attentive ones I have ever had the pleasure to encounter. Delicious food complemented by beautiful presentation for appetizer, entrees, and desserts. You can't go wrong with the crispy pork belly appetizer and excellent seafood. Prix-fixes are available for both lunch and dinner.The cocktail menu and wine list does not disappoint in selection or variety. This whiskey drinker is a big fan of the Old Fashion. A newly spotted announcement for Cocktail Hour is between 3pm to 5pm for half-priced cocktails. The hours are not the most convenient, but if one will make it happen if he/she wants it bad enough.I really can't help but continue to gush about Vitae to everyone I know. If money was not a concern, I can dine at Vitae everyday. A restaurant that knows its strengths and is proud of their offerings is a reflection of great management and vision. Then again, Vitae's origins are derived from quite the pedigree (Bouley, Morrell, and Gramercy Tavern). So quality and excellence are hardly surprises.",6,2,4
156,John Z.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",94,389,249,5.0,2/22/2015,"Great meal!Keep in mind the menu is seasonal and some of the things you read about on Yelp will not be on it anymore.Love the decorations, felt real upscale and if you sit against the wall you get to sit on a love-seat couch (if you're dining upstairs)We almost went for the tasting menu but realized there's no way it would be a better value over ordering your own chosen plates.For $75, you get 3 ""mystery dishes"" and one dessert, and yes, each is smaller than ordering off the regular menu... which means you may just get a $25 salad or flan if its your lucky day. You are only able to indicate foods you TOTALLY hate, or are allergic too. For us, it would have been the first half of the menu with lame salads and cold appetizers.Instead, our party of 2 were able to get 3 full-size hot appetizers, pasta, 2 entrees,  AND cocktails for the same price as 2 tasting menus.Our meal could have easily fed 3-4 people.All the food was fantastic too.Here's a breakdown:Duck Fat Bread - complimentary bread is awesome. Its lightly salted on top. We would have loved to get butter though, and there was no salt on the table.Pork Tacos - tiny little tacos with pork filling. Pretty good, but unremarkable enough to pass and get something else.Veal Ricotta Sliders - basically veal meatball sandwiches. Great taste, but would have been great with more cheese and sauce.Pork Belly - always a favorite of mine. Perfectly cooked and glazed with a sweet sauce. Almost like the boneless pork you get at Chinese food places. Real goodMaltagliati - delicious home made pasta with a meat sauce. Pretty good but could definitely have used more meat and sauce... and salt (which was not on the table)Pork Schnitzel - MASSIVE piece of pork lightly breaded. Really good if you're hungry. Comes with a side of jam, cucumber salad, and roasted potatoes.Duck - perfectly cooked and served with bacon brussel sprouts which were delicious. Probably my favorite meat dish we had. Nice portion size of duck too.Overall - a great meal i'd highly recommend anyone trying out this place out and making your OWN tasting menu",3,1,1
157,Joe M.,"Queens, NY",100,133,9,4.0,4/29/2015,"Came here on a Saturday night and I have to agree with other reviewers that the food was good but I'm not sure about the price for the service. Even though I was told the restaurant fills up in waves based on the pre-show and after-show crowds from the theater, I had a 8pm reservation and was weary about walking into a fairly empty restaurant on a Saturday night in NYC. I went with the four course tasting menu, which included pulled pork tacos, the pasta trio dish, the lamb, and chocolate hazelnut cheesecake. The pulled pork tacos were good, but could use a little more flavor. The pasta trio dish was so so with the chestnut agnolotti the best of the three. The lamb entree was good but had a burnt taste on the underlying sauce..not sure if that was just me or not, and the chocolate hazelnut cheesecake with vanilla bean gelato was great to finish the meal. Portion size for the four course tasting menu was on point as I left feeling satisfied.The food was definitely 4 stars, but the service didn't match my expectations and for the price, I probably won't return.",1,1,1
158,Michelle S.,"Briarwood, Queens, NY",9,14,2,5.0,1/23/2017,I hope Vitae realizes what a true asset their staff is. The five stars is definitely for service. Went for my friends birthday with no reservations on a busy night. They were truly accommodating and everyone from the server to the busser wished my friend a happy birthday. They were also very accommodating towards the fact that my friends could not eat meat. And even sent out a special amuse bouche and extra dessert for the birthday girl! The food was really good. Was it amazingly mind blowing? No. But it was really really good! The entire experience was perfect.,1,2,2

That being said, the food was even better. We loved the amuse for its flavor and tongue in cheek creativity - an uptown (si to speak) potato chip.. The lamb was phenomenal. The bread eater loved the Parker House rolls with duck fat and sea salt. Excellent find especially after seeing where we'd made reservations and decided in a split not to go there.",2,1,1
160,Ryan B.,"Westminster, CO",47,8,1,5.0,2/9/2017,"Absolutely blown away.  Atmosphere, food, service were all out of the park.  Hosted a corporate event in their upstairs private mezzanine, and they went above and beyond.  The service in particular was beyond compare. We had about 15 people; whenever they served a course, they brought an army of servers, one for each guest, and they placed the food down simultaneously.  It was the little touches that really pushed them over the top.  The food itself was outstanding - they provided set menus with some choice, but everything was great.  Big props to THOMAS who ran out server crew.  Big recommendation!",1,1,1
161,Maggie C.,"Princeton Junction, NJ",108,17,17,5.0,2/1/2015,"Fresh, impressive and sensational. Vitae is one of the best dining experiences I ever had.Best make a reservation here just to be sure. The atmosphere is upscale but not imposing. The dress code isn't strict either. The staff we encountered were pleasant and gave us excellent service. The menu has a variety of options without being overwhelming. The appetizer we ordered (Veal Ricotta Sliders) could be split with 4 people, which was nice! For entrees, we ordered Risotto, Duck Breast, and Whole Brook Trout. The Whole Brook Trout was the best trout I ever tasted! The Risotto had a lot of depth in it and had a great myriad of flavors from chorizo to butternut squash. The Duck Breast is a favorite and it's fitting; very tender and just amazing. With a menu that doesn't disappoint and an atmosphere that is beyond welcoming, this place knocks it out of the park.I highly recommend this restaurant! A true gem in NYC that should be experienced with a group of friends, family, or a special date.",3,1,2
162,Shannon H.,"Redwood City, CA",380,224,322,4.0,3/11/2015,"Well I was struggling between giving this place three stars or four stars because honestly the food was excellent. I had a friend visiting and she wanted to go to a place with a relaxed atmosphere but delicious food. I had Vitae bookmarked for a couple of months since I walked by it and decided to look up the yelp reviews. That night they were closed for a Christmas party so no such luck. So I thought this would be a great spot for dinner with my gf. We arrived and were seated immediately. They brought is out some delicious duck fat rolls while we waited. Buttery and delicious. Those things were amazing. We ordered a burrata appetizer, pork belly, and lamb meatball slider for our apps. I wish I would have known the portions were so huge bc we were stuffed before our entrees hit the table. The pork belly and burrata were our favorites. The burrata was soooo delicious and the pork belly was crispy and perfectly cooked. Next were the entrees. We ordered the tagliatelle and the duck breast entree. Both were out of this world delicious. The duck was perfectly cooked and some of the best I've ever tasted. And the pasta was perfect. Couldn't have asked for better food. So all this sounds great but my hold up was the service. I didn't feel like the service matched up with the quality of the food. Our server was very nice but by no means was the staff super professional. I saw them (not our server) with their phones out on multiple occasions. It's like cmon dude at least go in the back where nobody can see you. The vibe of the restaurant didn't match the food. Although the food was very very good I don't think I would come back based on that type of service. Sorry but I'm giving it four stars bc the food blew me away!",2,1,1

Updated review","We arrived in anticipation of a comparably tasty dinner as we've had here a couple of times before. But things didn't go as well...Started with Appetizers:Tuna and hamachi crudo was basically 3 ultra thin slices of still partly frozen and watery fish. Since it was watery and frozen, Not allowing the flavored to come through, if there was flavor.  This was disappointing. The Buratta was a little grainy, Costcos is better! We would have appreciated some crusty fresh bread to accompany the cheese.Dinner was so very disappointing, as was dessert. Upside: The wine was good!Maybe they lost their chef, I don't know, but we won't be back.Sadly, I would NOT recommend Vitae to my friends here on Yelp.",,,
164,Sarah B.,"Brampton, Canada",88,86,321,4.0,3/31/2015,"We came here at 6:30 on a Friday evening. We just flew in from Toronto and were excited to try this spot based on the great reviews. It did not disappoint! We were seated right away at a nice table upstairs. The place was bustling and a lot of fun. I started with a yummy cocktail called ""A dream of spring"" ($18) which was Jameson select reserve black barrel, housemade apple brandy, St. Germaine, honey and lemon juice. It was so delicious.The service was excellent. Jason was so friendly and they were very accommodating to our special requests. I was looking forward to trying the veal ricotta sliders but only wanted to try one (it comes with 3 normally) so they allowed that and charged me a fraction of the price ($4.50) . It was delicious! We also ordered the pork belly ($18) that everyone raved about but we felt it was just ok. It doesn't compare to the pork belly we had in Chicago at ""Two"" which now sets the gold standard. My hubby wanted to try the trout ($30) and since he is not a potato guy, we were able to sub the Yukon gold potato with the brussels sprouts and bacon. This dish was amazing!! I ordered a half serving of the butternut squash risotto ($16) which was rich and delicious. I also ordered a nice glass of red wine to go with my meal. We were stuffed so decided not to order dessert. Total bill with tax and tip was $143 for the 2 of us. A great dining experience and would highly recommend.",1,,2
165,Adam F.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",51,17,0,5.0,12/30/2015,"I brought my daughter here before a show, having picked the restaurant primarily due to its proximity to Town Hall and to the menu, which looked good but not over the top. Little did I know!The hostesses were very friendly, the service was excellent, and the food was fantastic! I was so surprised to find this restaurant tucked in between 'wichcraft and Dunkin Donuts - I'd never noticed it before. The amuse bouche was a wonderful surprise, as was the complimentary refresco and almond cookie at the end of the meal, and the chocolate chip cookie on the way out.We started with the pulled pork tacos (5 in an appetizer serving) and tuna and hamachi crudo. Both were excellent - and had been recommended by our waiter. My daughter had the pork schnitzel, which looked to be battered and deep-fried and was delicious; I had the red pepper fettucini (made in-house) with a carbonara-like sauce, also delicious.The room is cute and not too noisy, the tables are well spaced, and overall I was blown away by the quality of the food and service and by the value.

I am myself a bit torn between disliking some of the items in the menu or going completely crazy for some others. But I still believe this restaurant is a must-try. To be honest you can tell that all the meals are elaborate, well-prepared and well-cooked. I guess this is just a matter of taste as I am not always impressed about their creativity, but all my colleagues are always super happy about their meals. Yesterday I had the Burrata, the Tuna and Hamachi Crudo which were both delicious starters, but my great surprise was ultimately the Cacio y Pepe (basically pasta & truffles): it was so damnnnnnn good, the pasta was al dente and the truffles just added the flavor to a perfect combination. I also tried the Nutella cheesecake for dessert and it was pretty good. Regarding the bar and the service, it was perfect as usual.",,,

There are special little rolls covered in butter and a lovely Amuse-bouches (a handmade potato chip with a french onion dip - YUM!).

171,Timothy H.,"Douglasville, GA",31,6,1,4.0,7/16/2017,Had a fantastic dinner here before the theatre.  The food was delicious and all four of us enjoyed our varied dishes from cheese agnolotti and lobster cannelloni to river trout and Long Island duck.  Nice modern decor and friendly staff.  Definitely would rate 5 stars except my only complaint was the expensive wine menu.  Bottles basically started at $70/bottle and had a huge markup.  I find it disappointing to have a 4-5x markup on bottles rather than the usual 2-3x.,1,1,1
172,Linda A.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",25,48,2,4.0,4/1/2016,"What a fantastic meal I had here with a friend last night!  We shared everything and really loved everything we had!Firstly, those pillowy rolls of heaven (the duck fat rolls) were divine.  We had to stop ourselves from ordering 3 more rounds.  We could have eaten those beauties by themselves for dinner.My friend and I agreed that we would split the pulled pork tacos, the veal meatballs and the risotto.  Everything was fantastic, but my faves were the tacos.  I would come back here again by myself, belly up to the bar and have these with a nice glass of Cab.  Excellent little mini tacos of silky pulled pork.  I would love to go back and try more dishes on the menu.  And yes, the amuse bouches of potato chips were divine.  I was a little underwhelmed by dessert, maybe because dinner was so good.  Definitely recommend if in the area for a business lunch or dinner.",1,,1
173,Ed U.,"San Francisco, CA",4425,4421,35791,5.0,10/18/2012,"Oh my, the set designer for ""Mad Men"" has taken over, or at least that's how the retro decorating touches and my tall flute of Negroni Swizzle struck me when I entered this chic midtown eatery. The walls of the main floor are covered in a fussy spiderweb of shimmering nickel that you see repeated in the floor pattern. The ceiling more loosely repeats the pattern with amoeba-like clouds. One could imagine the staff of Sterling Cooper coming in here for several rounds of highballs and martinis with Don Draper making an inappropriate pass at somebody's sexually frustrated wife. Nothing that exciting happened when I was there with colleagues last week, but it was definitely a memorable evening of culinary indulgence courtesy of the artistry of chef Edwin Bellanco.First off, we all decided to have the $75 Chef's Tasting Menu which allows the chef free rein as to what he serves you. Was this a gourmet version of Russian roulette or a paradise of edible riches? Luckily we discovered it was far more the latter beginning with what were clouds of joy, dinner rolls soft and warm served in a little cast-iron baking tray (see photo). Thoroughly addictive especially as I was liberally sipping my Negroni Swizzle, a very pink Manhattan-style cocktail with Beefeater gin, sweet vermouth, Campari, soda and a pinch of salt. It was like a Shirley Temple gone  dirty...very dirty (see photo). Our first course arrived, Arancini (fried rice ball) on a toothpick and a miniaturized Pulled Pork Taco (see photo).Just a few savory-good bites and gone...all gone. Next were three luscious pieces of Crispy Pork Belly with slices of Parsnip, Honey Crisp Apple, all of it lacquered in an Apple Cider Glaze (see photo). Pork belly is an error-proof dish as far as I'm concerned with the produce providing the ideal contrast in texture and flavor. What followed was a sampling of three of their signature pasta dishes - the savory-great Maltagliati with Lamb Sausage, Cannelini Beans, Roasted Tomatoes and San Tumas; the fettuccine-like Chitarra with hearty Chicken and Ricotta Meatballs, Sofrito and Broccolini; and best of all, the decadently creamy Risotto with Kabocha Squash, Tuscan Kale and Chorizo (see photo).Ridiculously indulgent tasting with the carbs filling my ample belly in short order with the entree and dessert still to come. I was especially fortunate and received the Duck Breast and Confit of Leg with Endive Marmalade, Bacon and Baby Brussels Sprouts (see photo). You would think such a predictable dish would be anticlimactic at this point in the meal, but no, the buttery-tasting meat was prepared with a pink-rare center and the skin providing a nice crispy contrast. At this juncture, we were surprised with 50s-era mini-pop bottles of not-too-sweet Apple Cider Soda to cleanse our palates for dessert (see photo). An after-dinner aperitif is a must in a ""Mad Men"" world, so I had a $13 goblet of 2010 Sablettes Sauterne.It was sweet nirvana that should have sent me to the mattresses but not quite (see photo). By the way, the dinner wine was a rich and vibrant red with an oaky finish, the 2009 Cerasuolo di Vittola. Finally, there was dessert, and I lucked out again with the $10 Goat Cheese Parfait, which looked like an all-white stick of Land o' Lakes butter decorated with a Pink Peppercorn Gelee and Candied Walnuts and accompanied by a spoon-scoop of Kyoho Grape Sorbet (see photo). It was comparatively light next to the chocolate confections that could have ended up in front of me. Stuffed, sated - but I still managed to devour a Lemon Honey Ganache Bonbon (see photo). If I was Don Draper, I'd be slapping somebody's butt by now.FOOD - 5 stars...stellar renditions of well-known standards with a pasta trio that sent me to orbitAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...total ""Mad Men"" retro-chic coolSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very attentive and patient with an increasingly sloshed crewTOTAL - 5 stars...never heard of it before but coming back on my own dine next time",12,7,9

Wonderful service by all staff.For appetizers, we ordered the foie gras, beet salad, and crispy pork belly. Very delicious and I highly recommend the pork belly.For the entrees, we ordered the cod, beef tenderloin, duck, and lamb. We enjoyed our meal immensely. However, I.thought the duck was a bit too salty. Lamb however, was perfect. Food was very fresh and the fusion of flavors made for an interesting meal.We were pretty full, but we really wanted to try dessert. We got the whole selection to share.

175,Michael J.,"Austin, TX",216,108,13,5.0,1/19/2016,"I can't imagine coming to NYC without a visit to Vitae.  The food is delicate and bold at the same time.  My drink of choice is their take on the Vesper.  I've been here several times, it was amazing to be recognized by the management, and treated like a VIP.I'd come here just for the rolls.  The risotto is the best I've had outside of Italy.  Every dish is a perfect blend of flavors.You walk in here knowing you're going to spend a lot of money, and when you get done, you don't care.  You're ready to take out a second mortgage to eat here every day.And when you leave, be sure to get one (or two) of the cookies, and nibble it as you walk down the street with a sly, knowing grin on your face.",2,1,1
176,A And A.,"New York, NY",55,71,20,4.0,2/4/2015,"So I am giving this place 4 stars because the food was excellent. My husband brought me here for my birthday dinner. The athmosphere is super nice and cozy, very stylish but so dimly lit that it's romantic.We decided for the tasting menu but ordered our own wine. Unfortuantely we were ill informed by our server (more on that below) so we left the choice of dishes up to the chef.First, they brought out an amuse bouche of appetizers of which the mini tacos were the absolut best - yum! So good and unique! My appetizer ended up being the Tuna and Hamachu Crudo which to be honest did not really blow me away... it was ok but just not really my thing.My husband got the burrata which he loved.The pasta course was amazing (see pic!). Three different pastas are served in little individual cups and they were all great. The Chestnut Agnolotti one was my favorite - so so good!  I really had to hold myself back eating everything as I knew there was still a main course and dessert to come. My main course were the Seared Diver Scallops which were tender and juicy. Too bad I only got three smallish scallops which I usually wouldnt call a main course but I was already getting full at that point so I really didn't mind. Dessert was a bit of a let down as I got the Panna Cotta and as much as I love love love dessert, I simply do not like Panna Cotta. Luckily my husband let me eat from his apple tart :)After dinner they gave us each a itty bitty bottle of (I think) peach soda which was nice and refreshing. And to boot they send us off with a little baggie of cookies :)So overall this was a very very nice night and we really enjoed ourselfes at Vitae. BUTHere is the big CON:Since this was ourfirst time at Vitae we asked the server about the tasting menu. He explained to us that even if we go the tasting route we could still indicate which dishes we'd like. Awesome! So we study the menu and order some wine. A different waiter shows up to take our order. We tell him we'd like the tasting menu with our own selections for starter and dessert and started naming the dishes we wanted. Surprisingly, he then told us that with the tatsing menu we could NOT order what we wanted, only name certain foods we were allergic to or absolutely hated to make sure those were not selected by the chef. That kind of put us on the spot of just nodding and saying ""ok"" and hope for the best.We assumed that the first waiter might have been new and just didn't really know the exact policy which is kind of unproffessional. Reading the reviews below though I see that we actually SHOULD have been able to order what we wanted even with the tasting menu!  That is super upsetting in hindsight as I got the appetizer I didn't care for (crudo) and the dessert (panna cotta) that I knew I wouldnt like and ended up switching with my husband. So dear Vitae, we love you but  please get your policy straight and train your servers!!",2,,

The hostess recommended places to get a casual drink post dinner, our bartender gave us food and drink recommendation and was an exceptional conversationalist, and our server was patient kind and had a wonderful sense of humor. The food did not disappoint either, although it was a Pri-Fixed menu the courses were paired perfectly and the chef allowed us to substitute my meal for the best scallops I have ever had. We liked the bartender so much we went back to the bar for one more drink before leaving. Overall, I couldn't have asked for a more put together evening to celebrate Valentine's Day.",1,1,1
179,Michele C.,"Newport Beach, CA",1,22,0,5.0,2/26/2016,"Phenomenal is all I have to say. While the hostess wasn't anywhere to be found air about 5 minutes after I arrived, it didn't matter as my party was running late. We were celebrating a friend's birthday and that's all you need to tell them.  From having happy birthday printed on the birthday girl's menu, to the wait staff wishing her a happy birthday throughout the night, the service was impeccable and special.Onto the food.  Wow.  The way it was described, when we asked to have a few dishes explained a bit further, was spot on. We started with the cheese plate as an appetizer (yum), and for my main, I got the scallops which were AMAZING. the other guests raved about theirs as well -- the Alaska crab and butternut risotto.  For dessert, we had the ricotta cheese cake. Which was a perfect way to end.  They also sent the birthday girl home with a bag of 4 cookies and I got to take home a little bagged cookie as well.I've eaten at a number of places when visiting NYC, and this is the first place where I know I must return.Well worth the prices.",1,1,1

But day of, I've seen the hostess turn away people at the door or suggest them eating at the bar as their reservations are booked up. So definitely get reservations!!The service here is pretty great - they bring refills of those duck fat rolls every time they're out - the first time I came here I think we ate 6 pans of them! SO GOOD. I've had their burger, which is insanely good. I wasn't that big of a fan of their seafood crepe (it was a bit too fishy for me), and their appetizers have always been delicious. Their steak tartare is really good, and we had their beet salad last time which was surprisingly good - I'm usually not a fan of beets but it was delicious.Will definitely return!",2,2,2

The pulled pork was average and the guac and sour cream were just fine. I liked the taco shells, maybe the best thing about this dish.My wife ordered the lamb sausage cavatelli. Again it was fine, but we didn't think there were any stand out flavors. Mostly salt from the meat and the noodles weren't particularly satisfying.This restaurant was just fine. The server  was quirky, a bit standoffish but not offensively so. Certainly not a warm guy.I would try other options in this city of so many choices.",,,

Our waiter was very sweet, attentive and gave us some good recommendations. We decided to order the foie gras appetizer which had pistachio powder on it, if I recall correctly. This dish was absolutely delicious. For entree, I ended up getting the lamb sausage cavatelli. Unfortunately, I wasn't too fond of it. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sausage was too salty. I am l am a pastaholic but I couldn't even finish this dish! Made me so sad! My bf ended up getting the duck and he enjoyed it. Not something to rave about but it was good. The restaurant is good for a nice date but if you're a foodie like me, this place isn't going to blow you away.",2,,

Updated review","I was in there the other day and checked in on Yelp and then noticed I gave it 4 stars...WHAT?? just 4 stars? No way! So I am upgrading this to a level it deserves...I asked to look at the dinner menu just to know what's new or old and I was blown away. The sampling and simpleness of complexity really got me thinking. The chef is on course to becoming, with some help from you guys, a well known and respectable name on the New York dining scene. I then took a look around at the interior and all these thoughts came into my head. One being ""this place quite possibly could be pushing the boundaries of design"" and I mean on all levels including the menu.My creative juices started flowing about what I'm going to write and the name Per Se popped in - wow! Could this be inching to that level of food?? If then went through service boot camp I don't doubt it is a possibility. What really got me thinking was the look of someone's drink with two peals of orange standing upright in the glass and the perfectly square ice cubes stacked on each other. This made me look at the cocktail list and I then had to take a double look. There wasn't a single blend that this side the menu that I didn't immediately want to try; even though I'm a wine drinker. I vowed to put it on my things to do before I die list and come back when the weather warms up just enough to enjoy the chill in the drink!I look forward to trying each and every item on the menu because it's simply irresistible!",1,1,1

Updated review",This was my annual birthday visit to my favorite NYC restaurant. The food was is still AMAZING and great value for the price. Did the 6 course chefs choice menu. Make sure you go hungry. Between the two of us we tried 12 different offerings. Everyone was fantastic. Everything from Octopus and Oysters to Steak Tartar and Duck. Unfortunately the service was sorely lacking on this visit. We ordered sodas which never came so we had to ask another waiter for help. Our server was only seen when we ordered asked about another soda which he never delivered and when it came to the check. Which after we left we looked at to find we had been charged for sodas we had never received. We could have had wine for the $30 in soda we were charged. A key figure that was there has recently left.....I will still go back for the food. But now I will have to expect a lower level of service. Disappointed. :(  Would have been 4 or 5 if not for service.,,,
186,Kaylee T.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",0,29,0,1.0,11/2/2015,"Went there for a late lunch [3pm] since they claim to be open all day. I was rudely not greeted by the host who was literally standing there on hold. He told us it was happy hour only and to get a menu from the bartender who had his back faced to us and didnt turn around. I went to the restroom, and stood at the bar again, waiting for a menu. Another worker even told the bartender i was there and he still didnt turn around. I asked the host a question again, and he directed me to the bartender, where i waited for several more minutes with zero service so i left. The ambiance is trendy but they clearly give zero f's about paying patrons. Menu looked average and over priced anyways.",4,,

Grilled Salmon entrée was perfect and very good, while we both love whole grilled fish this dish needs a little work because although it was very good it looked like something they found in an ancient pyramid.

I was under pressure, supposed to book a dinner reservation for a planned outing with colleagues from out of the country, yet at 2 pm I still hadn't told them where we were going. Ofcourse this was coupled with me being bratty and not wanting to go to a place that I'd been to before. No worries, I did a quick search on yelp for a nearby establishment and came across Vitae. The food was delicious and the service was immaculate. No seriously!!!!! My colleagues were thoroughly impressed and loved the food. That's pretty much all that you can ask for when you are the dinner host. To start with I had artichokes and lobster as an appetizer, followed by a whole bass. The Vitae staff does a great job of offering small tasters throughout the meal as well. Clearly they know how to entice me I come back. Smh. I loved everything! My colleague even said, ""I know where to go for dinner when I am next in town"". Amazing. As I sit on the train- while full,happy and prepare to sleep, I am also thinking of when I next will return. By the way, even though I came here for a work dinner, I will definitely return for a social dinner. It was comfortable with the hip background music remaining audible without deafening those in the restaurant. They also made a concerted effort to ask about allergies. This was much appreciated since we had someone with severe allergies in the group. More trout, more lobster, more artichokes please. I'm not often impressed with the full package in midtown east. Wow!",3,2,2
