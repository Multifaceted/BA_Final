0,Andrea V.,"Buffalo, NY",25,47,15,5.0,10/31/2018,"I wasn't looking for a culinary exquisite affair. We came for drinks & an appetizer. The truffle fries with jalapeños, ""The Beetle Juice"". I took a photo of my drink & menu, because I need more of that in my life. The people working gave us an amazing experience. Everyone was GREAT. Bartenders working hard & making fun drinks. I felt like I was in a tiny part of Disney. Can I say that? When I asked Willy Wonka if he was an NYU student, without hesitation he told me he was a chocolatier. It took me a moment to realize he was in character. People inside the bar made it fun. It was a good crowd, and I loved the energy. The actual place. Holy cow!!! Even a piece by Timburton was donated by him, that they told us about. How great to see so much stuff that fills my heart up. Would love to come see it when it isn't Halloween eve to visit with each piece. I got to see his traveling exhibit at MoMa a few years ago. Love love love the work and how it makes me feel. Thank you for making me feel so happy after visiting, The Beetle House.",2,,1
1,Boogiee R.,"Brownsville, NY",1,2,0,1.0,11/18/2018,I was so excited to bring my wife here for her belated birthday present and it was a shit show ! We walk in and i'm excited because aesthetically its beautiful. We get greeted by beetle juice which was fun but too much dick jokes to be honest. We get our seats and Boom ! Dirty glasses and cloudy water in a bottle sitting at the table. We ask for new glasses and did'nt get any until 15 mins later ; she comes back and gives us the same dirty glasses with water on them like she just rinsed them under water! Red lipstick stained on both glasses !Friends that came here said they share a entree and get sides; we attempted to do the same but then we where slapped with a 15$ plate fee if we share. Don't get me wrong it wasn't about the money ! It was the fact that it did not say that anywhere on the menu or on the website! I seen many reviews off people saying they shared food with no problem! Another thing is if you dint drink alcohol please don't go there ! They want you to pay 14$ for Virgin versions of their drinks ! Im very disappointed but very happy my wife enjoyed seeing the tim burton stuff and got to laugh at beetle juice !But they need a new menu ! Stop the Pre fixie ! Its not worth a reservation lmao !,,,
2,Maria D.,"East Meadow, NY",55,3,0,1.0,11/12/2018,"I made reservations for 5 a month ago and when we got there they gave us a table for 4 and when we said we were 5 the hostess gave us a really bad attitude and just made us squeeze in the tiny table for 4. The place is super super small, no exaggeration.The food was horrible. I asked for the Edward Burger Hands cooked medium and the burger came burnt with burnt bacon and the burger bread looked and felt like it was from weeks ago. Their Mac and cheese was disgusting and the filet mignon was way over cooked also. Not good food, not fresh at all. For entertainment they had the Mad hatter, Miss Love it and Willy Wonka. We loved Willy wonka. He's the reason why I'm giving the one star. The mad hatter got drunk and was dancing on the bar. Miss love it was super annoying, she was screaming in your ear way too often and cursing at you the entire time.Definitely not worth the +1 hour drive there and $300 bill.",,,

Updated review","Sophia was our waitress and she rocked! Food was so good! Surprised at how awesome it was. Shout out to the owners doing a great job creating a great energy and atmosphere!That was my review one year agoThis year was really tough. I can't stand this limited prefix menu. Nothing has changed on it in forever and the food isn't something to write home to momma about. We had a party of 4 and one of us didn't want a big meal she only wanted an appetizer. The waiter tells us we pay a fee of $15 plus a 15 appetizer it's insane. The service this year was horrible. It was a Tuesday night. Slow evening. No reason we had to ask multiple times for napkins. And our entrees took so long I requested to cancel and they just brought out the plates the instant I asked to cancel. We also had a birthday girl with us. I asked for the usual cake and song, and every restaurant I've gone to in my life has always given the birthday cake on the house. I was shocked to see we were charged for the cake! This place is a total rip off. I never tip poorly but I begrudgingly left a 10% tip. If they had taken care of us they would of gotten at least 30%. We were shocked our bill came out to $220 for 4 people including two ""prefix"" meals with appetizers and two side appetizers. I don't know there isn't enough I could say but I am not going back and I wouldn't suggest it to anyone else. Yeah the decore is cute and the costume characters are cute. But the waitstaff needs to step their game up. Same with the menu. Anyway. ....",1,,
4,Kasey D.,"Winter Garden, FL",75,131,839,3.0,10/5/2018,"Mehhhhhh. The atmosphere is kitschy and fun. I love all the movie tie ins. But the food was just bleh. First of all, you HAVE to get an appetizer. The menu is a set price. There are two price levels based on which entree you get so you will either end up paying $35 or $45. Drinks are extra. I was a ""level 2"" meaning I got a higher priced entree. I had the Sweeney Beef. Really cute presentation with a razor in it (also possibly dangerous ). But the meat was just over cooked- even though they asked you how you wanted it. And the garlic mashed potatoes it came with were drenched in some weird thin gravy. My fiancé's got the Edward Burger Hands. He felt the same way about the meat- overcooked. The only person who enjoyed their meal was our mom who got a salad. It was GIANT. But freshly made. I knew this place would be small but HOLY MOLY it is small. And the tables are even smaller. The three of us were cramped around our table. It was a fun place to go to once but I don't think I will go back again...",1,,1
5,Garrett S.,"Chicago, IL",169,2,0,1.0,11/17/2018,"Made a reservation about three weeks ago, my flight got canceled due to weather so I tried to call  beetle house to cancel my reservation (if you don't do it within 24 hours you get charged) I called three times and no one answered, and their mailbox was full so I couldn't leave a message. Yelp won't let you cancel the reservation and says you have to call.I tried emailing and got no response. So now I'm out $50 because they won't get a hold of me.",,,
6,JoAnn R.,"OZONE PARK, NY",10,19,15,4.0,10/28/2018,Had a blast. Loved the decor.  The mac and cheese is so good and the chocolate chocolate martini is heaven.Willy Wonka came around often to ask if everything was ok and to restock the candies in the drinksDownside- space is cramped and waited over 30 min for the check.,,,
7,Carl C.,"Waterbury, CT",72,64,27,3.0,9/30/2018,"Cool concept! I was amused by the guy playing Beetlejuice at the bar. He played the character to the t. I think he alone made me enjoy this place more.The place sort of suffers from the lack of space that you sometimes associate with lower Manhattan establishments. Super small very tight environment.  I sat at the bar and you're not going to be able to avoid the fact people will brush up against them you most of the time.  It's not a huge deal breaker for me but it did sort of aggravate some of my friends.I thought the cocktails were interesting. I had the coco Skellington and a drink that was called This is Halloween. I enjoyed both of them.  I also ordered root beer buffalo wings. Full disclosure: I ordered them out of curiosity. They were surprisingly good. If you want a table, you're going to need reservations.  There was a three hour wait when we got there.I think the only thing that down votes the place a little is the atmosphere it creates when you get a beverage or the food. People are waiting on a bar seat behind you and when they bring your food out, I definitely had a few people behind me come in closer and stare at what I was eating.  It didn't ruin it for me but there were times when I wished Inhad a little more space.",2,,
8,Alicia M.,"West End - West Side, Bridgeport, CT",0,1,0,3.0,11/18/2018,My boyfriend & I came here to celebrate our anniversary & for starters we loved the way the restaurant looks. It really embraces Tim Burton's work. The characters that were walking around played their role to the core. My boyfriend & I couldn't stop laughing. Our waitress Jessica was awesome! The place is very tight so unless you have a reservation you will have to stand or sit in the bar. The food is very pricey for no good reason because it's not the best. I definitely feel like this place is only worth going if you want to only go for drinks.,,,
9,Gary D.,"London, United Kingdom",29,1,10,5.0,10/4/2018,This evening was a great start to my trip to NYC. Beetle House is a must-go restaurant in NYC. From the drinks to the service and don't even get me started on the food. The atmosphere was quaint but the interaction between the staff and performers were a class act. The food paired itself well with whatever you were drinking. The management was personable and responsive to every guests' need. The chef in my opinion is in a class all his own.   In conclusion this guest will travel all the way from Bermuda to eat at this restaurant again!!!!!!!,,,
10,Christina C.,"New York, NY",151,94,120,1.0,10/11/2018,"I will never be back. The 1 star is NOT for the staff and the actors. They were all so sweet and friendly. This place is a pre-fixe menu so don't come here expecting to just have an appetizer and a drink. It is mandatory to order 1 app and 1 entree. I knew this experience was going to be worse than i thought when the waitress told us the nachos were the best and we got served cold tortilla chips smothered in cold cheez whiz. Not a good a start. Then came out the root beer wings which tasted like PB&J. This place loves smothering their shitty food with shitty sauces. Now we got the entrees. Mac & cheese. WHY IS THERE RAGU SAUCE ON TOP OF IT ??!!!! disgusting and unnecessary. But once you kind of pick it off it wasn't half bad. We also split a burger and it was not even edible. I don't know what kind of meat it was. It tasted like grease and was crumbly. All the food was pretty much just thrown on the plates. No effort in the plating presentation at all. We told the waitress we did not want a certain thing on the burger and we were told to ""just pick it off"" ... how this place is still opened is beyond me...Drinks: This is Halloween was the most disgusting thing i ever tasted. The bio exorcism and coco skellington were better choices but still not great. We tried ordering beers and their tap was broke. Once it was fixed my friend tried a sample. The beer was stale and flat. Then they ran out of dry ice for the drinks which was part of the presentation. This restaurant is so small. It is like trying to squeeze everyone in a long narrow hallway. Everyone is on top of one another. The worst part is as you're waiting for your table...the staff from the kitchen (which is in the front of the restaurant) is pushing through the patrons with food, dirty plates, etc. If you ever plan on coming here i would recommend to just grab a drink from the bar and embrace the awesome Halloween decor. Skip the food!!!!!! I've had better meals at McDonald's for half the price.",10,3,1
11,Kristi H.,"Lansdale, PA",21,1,0,5.0,11/17/2018,I waited almost 2 years to go here and was looking forward to it beyond belief. We had to wait for our table a little bit past our reservation time but the staff was great..the drinks at the bar were amazing!...the food was phenominal and the atmosphere is very playful. I would give The Beetle House 10 stars if possible and will recommend to absolutely everyone I know. Can't wait to go back.,,,
12,Julia L.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",405,64,36,4.0,10/26/2018,"I was here last night with my boyfriend on a whim at around 8pm. This was my first time here and I probably should have done a bit more research before coming here, but it was a great time nonetheless. In retrospect I wish I would have made a reservation. The whole place is very tiny and crowded. The bathroom is incredible tiny and only one stall for everyone. My boyfriend, and I ""sat"" at the bar (we only had one bar chair so I sat and he stood.) we were lucky to have one stool at all. Besides it being tiny and crowded, it was a very cool atmosphere. I loved the was it was decorated, it was truly Tim burton inspired. The characters were great! The corpse bride, and the mad hatter made an appearance. They were interactive with everyone and so much fun. They had fabulous costumes and makeup. The bartenders where also dressed very accordingly. They didn't smile which I thought must have been on purpose, they seemed to be in character as well. Since I didn't make a reservation I couldn't order food. But I had some of the signature cocktails. They were very tasty but also unique, beautiful, and dry ice was a nice touch. The drinks were reasonably priced, and strong. No watered down drinks here. I would come back here, but I would make a reservation before I do.",,,
13,Kyshia M.,"Oakland, CA",580,345,379,5.0,5/1/2018,I'm so glad I made it here. I love Tim Burton!!! This themed bar was the highlight of my trip. The drinks were really good. We sat at the bar but you can eat here too with a reservation. The bar area is rather small. But the décor and characters make up for the lack of seats at the bar. This place is CASH ONLY! They have an ATM but a local told us to use the arm around the corner for a cheaper fee.,2,1,1
14,Melissa P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",1,24,1,2.0,8/8/2018,"I'd highly recommend Beetle House if you want to stop in and have a drink. The cocktails are creative (and strong!), and the decor and characters are absolutely worth experiencing.However, I was totally underwhelmed by the service and the food. We made a reservation. We had to track someone down once we arrived to ask about a table, and after waiting 20+ minutes we stopped someone again to ask if our table was ready, and they sat us. It's a very small restaurant, and the whole time we were waiting we were definitely in the way, but there was no real waiting area and nobody directed us to stand anywhere else.Once seated, we were again forgotten. After another 20+, we asked the bartender for menus. We ordered food-- the fact that it was a prix fixe menu was disappointing because there really weren't a lot of impressive food options. For example, I probably wouldn't have picked any of the appetizers if I didn't have to. The bartender offered us a free round of drinks for the wait, which helped a little bit.The food was fine, but nothing special. Probably not worth $35, even in NYC.",2,,1
15,Jason K.,"Selden, NY",269,1,0,1.0,11/8/2018,"I went here because it was where my love wanted to go for her birthday. So, naturally I was happy to take her. We had looked at the menu online ahead of time and had seen that the average price of an entree was 15-18 dollars which I thought was reasonable. However, upon arriving at beetle house and looking at the menu, they pushed this ""price fix"" crap on us. Which includes an appetizer and an entree for 35 or 45 dollars depending on what entree you choose. Well we didn't want the apps so we said we would just order our meals and some drinks. But it soon became apparent that no matter what we chose to eat they were going to force us to pay 35 dollars a head.  So okay, we said we would have the app. We each had wings, my love had a burger and I had their Mac and cheese which was okay but they bring it out and it is literally less than the size of my fist. I'm an average sized person, so this was a terribly small portion for charging 35 dollars. I mean we are literally talking pasta, cheese, and some bread crumbs here people!! At most they should charge 15 dollars for this dish and it should have been much bigger. Ive eaten in the city many times. I live on LI not far from the city. There's not that big of a difference in city prices from where I live. I know what to expect of city prices, but this was ridiculous. But I let it slide. The wings were decent. I then asked if they could sing Happy Birthday to my wife and bring out a piece of cake for her, something that has always been on the house every restaurant I have ever been to. So the cake came out, if you could call it that. It was a one inch diameter piece of garbage with whip cream on top. Then the bill came. They charged me 12 dollars for that ""cake"". Again, as I stated before this is something that is supposed to be on the house when it's someone's birthday. Disgusting in my opinion.All told the place is small and tight and the food is mediocre at best and horrible at worst. The prices they charge are outrageous for the fare they are serving. And on top of it they give small portions that can hardly be considered a meal. If you enjoy a gothic theme then it is a fun place, but their food is overpriced, crappy, and delivered in small portions. I would stay away unless you want to spend a lot of money just for the decor and some crappy acting. I suggest they go back to their old and clearly cheaper menu if they want to stay in business. Or hire a different chef and deliver better quality food, and bigger portions if you're gonna charge that amount. If I could give this place zero stars I would. Save your money go enjoy a better meal for half the price, and skip this place. It's not worth the hype at all in my opinion. I won't be returning, unless the Mrs. makes me.UPDATE 11/9/2018: My wife threw up last night after eating at Beetle House. Definitely won't be going back now.",1,1,
16,Fatima P.,"Greenwich, CT",41,3,2,4.0,9/6/2018,"I was good, but is to little. The food was good, except the French fries, I hated. I love the thematic  Is a amazing place for people that love Tim Burton's movies.",,,
17,Darcie M.,"Fairfield, CT",133,2,0,5.0,9/29/2018,"Oh my gosh. Amazing. From the moment I walked through the door I was totally transported into a Tim Burton world and it was better than I even imagined. I won't give any of the details away, but just trust me the interior of this restaurant and the things going on inside the walls is perfect. Even the drinks are amazing, I got ""The Beetle's Juice"". Then the food...delicious. They ONLY have prix fixe but it's worth it. We had the 1st level of prix fixe, apps we chose were sriracha truffle fries (which we asked for to go) and ""brains and chips"" (side note: the names of everything? love it, so creative.). Then for mains we got the Edward Burger Hands and Edward Vegan Hands...yep! Vegan options! We loved our experience and our meal there and will definitely be back soon!",1,,2
18,Brittany B.,"Bloomfield, NJ",458,15,10,3.0,9/28/2018,"Love the decor in the place of course ! However the place is extremely small and to get to the bathroom you bump into waiters on the way. The food was a prefix menu that included one appetizer and an entree and it was pretty disappointing, I had higher expectations. The drinks were pretty good and the service was good and prompt. I probably wouldn't go back to eat, but maybe for a drink and to enjoy the decor.",1,,
19,Iliana O.,"Bronx, NY",162,14,1,2.0,9/4/2018,"The actors, decor and music are 5 stars.  The food quality, cramped space, and wait time (we had a reservation) really dampened the experience for me. I went here for dinner with some friends from out of town for the last leg of a bachelorette party, they loved it because they were die hard Tim Burton fans, but for someone who has experienced great nyc food and restaurants (especially in the East Village), Beetle House is simply sub par. When you enter there is no hostess stand, you basically have to wait around for the hostess while waitstaff and customers squeeze past you. The place is WAY too small for comfort. Once the hostess returned from the back, she didn't greet us, and we had to get her attention. After we told her our reservation and name, it took longer than expected for them to seat 5 of us at a table that barely fit all of us, and should be meant for 4 people. The food was not good at all for the steep prices, though I did like that they had adequate vegan options.  I had the vegan mac and cheese and a veggie burger.  The vegan mac and cheese was ok for a vegan option, my veggie burger was on a roll, like the ones you get on a bacon egg and cheese from the corner bodega, it doesn't belong on a veggie burger...My friends had the regular mac and cheese, and it tasted like it was made with cheese whiz.TLDR: Overpriced, and cheaply made, poor tasting food. I will not be going back.  I would suggest only coming here for drinks if you can find a spot at the bar, their specialty cocktails taste good, and the actors are great.",4,1,1
20,Lily D.,"Bethpage, NY",0,11,8,3.0,6/6/2018,"Upon walking up to this black door, my brother and I were greeted instantly by Willy Wonka! We had made a reservation a little prior to arriving and were seated immediately. The bar was half packed and we were seated in the middle. The host gave us the rundown of the menu and the cocktails and left us to explore. The decor was awesome. It felt just like Halloween and the music was on point as well. Our waitress came over, introduced herself, and took our drink order. The drinks took a little too long to reach our table and as previously stated, the bar was half packed, but not too busy that the bartender was overwhelmed. We placed our food order: Willy Wings, which had a root beer soda glaze, topped with pop rocks and the Nachos Muerto to start. For the entrees: Edward Vegan Hands and Edward Burger Hands. Our drinks eventually came: Bio-Exorcism and The Beetle's Juice. Later following This is Halloween.They were good and the presentation was nice. When our entrees came out, they came out wrong. Everyone was kind of confused- the host who dropped off the plates, the server, and my brother and I. I knew the plate I had in front of me was not the Edward Vegan Hands, so I had unfortunately sent it back. The server was very apologetic and I understood because I also work in the industry and know mistakes happen! It was not a big deal because we were not in a rush. My brother immensely enjoyed his burger and once I got mine, I loved it as well. Both plates were served with a side of sweet fries that came out hot and fresh.Throughout our stay, Mr. Wonka made his rounds to each table, gracing us with his presence. He was very fun and charismatic. At the end of our meal he gave us two little Hershey's Bars (which were surprisingly cold for how warm it was in the place). Overall, the atmosphere was awesome, the food was great, and the drinks were good.",4,,2

My friend ordered a fishbowl and asked i wanted to try, i made the comment i couldn't bc it was coconut rum and pineapple inIt, both i amAllergic to. The bartender overheard and said he could make me one and change those ingredients! Went out of his way to be helpful! It was delicious!! Food is amazing.

I'm a native new Yorker so i am used to the hustle and bustle of a dive bar. The staff here was amazing and very attentive. Julia my server was the absolute sweetest! Being the nosey vegetarian I am, I had all these questions about the vegan burger I was going to order. She had no problem answering any of them [I officially now am trying to create that vegan cheese sauce! PERFECTION] She also didnt mind having bits of conversation with my husband and I, I didnt feel rushed at all. As well as who seemed to be the manager, half way through with my burger I realized there wasn't any of the vegan ""bacon"" on it and mentioned it to julia. No more then a few minutes later the manager brought me a few slices to eat with what I had left. My husband had mentioned it was my birthday and I should get a dessert and she was able to have all the charaters [victor, sally, emily] come up and sing happy birthday with her. That was a weird dream come true. This was an honest to god amazing expirence and being in the food industry, I know the blood sweat and tears that goes into making places like that run smoothly.

23,Justine R.,"Rutherford, NJ",34,250,441,2.0,11/19/2017,"I had read all the reviews. I knew what to expect and what not to expect. And unfortunately, I still have to give this place 2 stars. The decor is nice, dark and ""gothy"" in the relatable sense of all that is Tim Burton. I've heard they usually have a character walking around. Last night it was Willy Wonka. He was nice and entertaining. The music is great too. While my drink was sweet, I will say it was made right. I'd read that they make the drinks weak. Whenever I see that kind of review, I'll usually go for the Martini then, it's usually the safe bet. The prices are outrageous. I'm not talking for nyc. I'm talking in relation to quality. There is none. The pudding is not homemade, yet it cost $10 for a cup of it? My shrimp tasted funny and they ACTUALLY screwed up mashed potatoes. They were served very cold and runny, tasted watery. I enjoyed the Mac n cheese, cause I'm a cheese nut. The Mad Shrimp dish...no! We also had the beef which was a good cut, but lacked a real flavor. Except for a slight burnt taste, but it wasn't. In my experience it means the cooks are not properly cleaning their grill/stove. So at this rate I would have given the place 3 stars. Friendly service and staff but terrible food. It dropped to 2 the moment I got home and couldn't leave the bathroom. We're talking both ends here. I think it was the fish. But obviously I can't say for sure. Don't eat here. Even if you don't get sick, you won't be happy about dropping $150, on a dinner not worth $50.",9,1,

The appetizers we went with were Cheshire Mac & Cheese and the Nachos Muertos. We were famished and dug right in. My Coco Skellington and my date's Beetle's Juice were delicious and strong. Sally came by to talk to us a few times and we made pictures with her. I'd love to come back on the weekend when there are more than 1 character.  I went with the Shrimpy Hallow and he went with the Sweeney Beef. The beef was served with a folded razor!  It was incredibly tender and tasty. My Shrimp dish was delicious. The cheese grits and sausage with the shrimp were perfect. The bar got busier as the night wore on.  My teenage daughter wants me to take her next. She was annoyed that she only got a shirt.,1,,1

While there is no kids menu in print, they did offer smaller versions of the entrees for the kids. We all shared the Brains & Chips, Nachos Muertos and Deetz Cocktail appetizers. Everything was delicious. For a entree, I had the Cheshire Mac & Cheese (sans tomato reduction), my husband got the burger, and my twins shared the Sweeney Beef. The Mac & Cheese ended up being the hit with all the kids. My husband devoured his burger. And the filet was good.On the night we visited (Saturday), we were lucky to meet 4 characters: Jack Skellington, Beetlejuice, Lydia and Mrs. Lovett. Jack sang and even sat at our table for a bit. Because the restaurant was so intimate, we had several opportunities to chat with the characters- who were very impressive. We will be back.",,,
32,Austin F.,"Saint Louis, MO",2,1,0,5.0,8/26/2018,"We were looking for something fun to do for dinner in NYC; I told my wife I wanted to eat somewhere I couldn't in our home town but was also kinda theme-y and kitschy but not like one of those awful Rainforest Café places, you know? So... we found, Beetle House: a Tim Burton themed restaurant and bar!If you know me even a little bit or, God forbid, had me as a teacher then you know about my complete and all-consuming obsession with Tim Burton.My soul left my body.They only played music from his movies and / or 90s / 2000s pop punk (MCR, P!ATD, etc...). Everyone sang along and acted like idiots; it was perfect.I would come back ALL THE TIME if I lived near here. There's apparently one in LA, too that I'm going to have to visit.Employees come out dressed up as Burton favorites and stay in character the entire time, the food and drinks were fantastic, and the other patrons who planned this out ahead of time were even wearing black and white striped outfits reminiscent of Beetlejuice.It's SMALLLLLL but I love what they've done with the place.You have to go! (Call ahead and make reservations)",1,2,
33,Fariha K.,"Bronx, NY",86,147,76,3.0,5/8/2018,"Really weird place that I was a bit skeptical going to. Located on a street with many bars and restaurants, this place stood out because the windows were all blacked out. You literally can't see anything from the outside, I guess that's fine. You don't know if you're entering a strip club or a restaurant, that's cool.Upon entering, the place had a weird old smell that was offputting and it's super small and narrow. The smell fortunately you get used to, but as the place gets more and more packed, especially in the front where the bar is - you realize how much smaller this restaurant. Small and dark. My friend had made a reservation here though so thankfully we got a seat right away. The theme was cool and the menu reflected that. The menu was prefixed though so you should look at it ahead of time. Level 1 was 30$ and level 2 was 45$, I believe. My friend and I decided to split the meal because we weren't too hungry. We ordered the hot wings, Mac and cheese, and the big fish bowl as the drink. The Mac cheese was okay. I think it was pretty bland, the breadcrumb topping wasn't really a wow factor for me. The hot wings though ?! Oh my god. I hate wings but the wings here with the buffalo sauce is to die for. The drink was good too, good for two people and very strong. As for the cosplay.. it was cool. I think the dark and spooky decor kind of did most of the talking. Although the guy in this costume did his best, I don't think his ""performance"" did anything. I think just being in the restaurant fulfilled your tim burton craving.",3,,1

Other reviews state it's small....which is an understatement. It's like ten tables and a small bar. The decor is Burton-tastic! The signature cocktails are delicious! My favorite is the We Come In Peace; so good, our dinner was tasty as well. Burton movie theme songs play throughout! Halloween everyday!",,,
36,Michelle M.,"Staten Island, NY",2,14,0,1.0,10/26/2018,"Terrible terrible terrible!! It's the smallest place ever with only 35 seats. There's no where to wait and everyone is on top of each other (literally). On top of all that, it was a prefixed menu so you were forced to order an appetizer and an entree. If you want to share with someone, they charge you 15 dollars which is bullshit. There wasn't even a lot to choose from, the food wasn't good at all plus the nachos were cold. It's a cool concept but isn't worth going to at all. It only gets one star because you have to give it at least one star to post this review. I think the only thing I found amusing was the guy dressed up as beetle juice. He really was into the character and did a good job.",,,

The food was terrible terrible terrible. The garlic in the mac and cheese was completely burnt and terrible tasting, almost inedible. The fries were okay, but nothing was spectacular or worth the price. I would go for drinks and the awesome decor but that's all.",2,,

Luckily, my friend made a reservation and we were seated quickly. It was pretty crowded, especially around the bar.We ordered a few drinks, I had a couple ""The Beetle's Juice"", they were great. Our waitress was awesome. My friend and I split a prix fixe meal that included dessert. It was cool that they let us share the meal. We also had a few appetizers.

39,Francine S.,"Staten Island, NY",10,27,23,5.0,8/30/2018,"I absolutely love Tim Burton and this place makes you feel as though you are immersed in his mind. The colors of the walls, the art hanging from the ceiling and on the walls, and characters from Tim Burton movies mixing in with the patrons. They even play a mix of music from all Tim Burton's movies. The food and drink menu were both creatively titled. The drinks were strong and delicious. I've never seen plantains served with guacamole before and I had that as my appetizer and it did not disappoint. The place is narrow and very small inside, be prepared to bump elbows with the next table. The staff were all sweet and friendly. I will most definitely go back there repeatedly. I loved it!",,,
40,Vivi M.,"Worcester, MA",1,10,7,3.0,9/2/2018,"I was very excited to come here as Halloween is life to me. The staff were very attentive and polite. The characters were funny and amusing, the ambiance in there is just perfect. So I would rate that 5 out of 5. I was super disappointed in the food however. I ordered the nachos muertos which were ok. My main course was the Cheshire cheese, which was not good at all.   I also had a drink off the menu which was ok as well. Overall the pricetag for the quality of the food do not match. I was not happy paying $53  for one person when I didnt really enjoy my food. So that I would rate a 2 out of 5.",,,

The characters were amazing and engaging and hilarious. I shared the 'big fishbowl' drink with my mom and loved it! Gotta love a drink with candy in it! The food was great! The music was boppin y'all. The staff was very attentive. All-in-all if you're in NYC you NEED to go to this place! Make sure to reserve a table (we did, and i definitely recommend it) if you want to eat dinner as well as drink. I'm so happy I got to do this during my trip!",,,
42,Leah C.,"Hyattsville, MD",78,1,0,1.0,10/27/2018,"What they don't tell you when you make reservations is that there is a pre fixed menu that you are forced to get per person. $35 or $45 and does not include drinks. We came from MD and went with the assumption that we were both going to get appetizers and lots of drinks. I paid 35 for 5 wings and mac and cheese shells with tomato sauce and bread crumbs. $25 for the fish bowl drink which actually was really good.The size: we couldn't even get to a person to check in because the bar is so small AMD over crowded. Look, I know it's a NYC bar and it's going to be small but when I say this is a hallway with bar stools and 6 tables and chairs please be prepared for that. I was expecting over the top Tom Burton decor but it was just some paintings. Beetlejuice was there and the madhatter and they were really fun and nice. Besides the staff this place is the worst I have ever been to and I will never go back.",,,

There is a man who is dressed up as Beetle Juice walking in and out of the bar. The bar was full and we did not make a table reservation because I heard that the food was a mediocre bar food. We got the menu and within 30 minutes spots opened at the bar. We sat down and ordered special drinks. I ordered Bio- Exorcism because it was the least sweet drink on special drinks menu. I loved it! Crisp, clean and refreshing cucumber flavored drink. My date ordered This is Halloween and loved it! We took photos with the man dressed up as Beetle Juice. The decor and dressed up man made this bar fun. I would come here next for a drink or two for a halloween theme night.",3,,

Updated review","I grew some balls and decided to head back to Beetle House for my birthday, almost 2 years since it's opening.The main thing that improved were in fact the drinks. the bar tender was very quick and made the drinks well. i ordered 3 of the tim burton themed drinks and truly loved them, my guests were happy too.my main complaint was the fact that i made reservations for 6 on a saturday night at 9 PM, over a month before the actual date. i showed up with my guests at 8:50 PM, and we were not seated until close to 9:40. I feel as if my reservations were completely a waste at this point. As mentioned before, yes the place is small, but compared to when i came 2 years ago, the place didnt seem busy at all. it seem kinda quiet, and calm, there was space at the bar, no one standing around, things seemed smooth. you would think the hostess or staff would make note of their reservations and make sure to have a table ready by the time the reservation comes in? nope, not here. ive made plenty of reservations in my day, and the most ive had to wait was about 5 to 10 mins which is understandable. however, close to an hour? that really pissed us all off.more decorations--so props to that. although i creeped around alittle bit, didnt get a chance to thoroughly explore, but it did seem like theres more.Food. Well myself and one other guest did the prixe menu. we get an app and an entree for $25. we both chose the gothic pasta with an app. i chose the shrimp quesadillas. well there were 3 small ones and had great flavor. however, they were not hot or room temp. i am not sure if they were supposed to be, but to be honest they were super soft and mooshy. almost to the point to where it was hard to eat. didnt feel like quesadillas, but like moosh that i had to roll together to put in my mouth. they did taste good tho, maybe it was a sauce they had on there? maybe they added too much? it basically just turned into a soupy feeling, maybe too much of whatever sauce or guac? basically no texture. now gothic pasta...this too wasnt hot. the ravioli felt undercooked because the cheese in side of it was not smooth and creamy, and kinda on the cold side in my opinion. the sauce had decent flavor, but was basically liquid. felt watered down. the serving size of the pasta was a good serving tho. no bread given with this but i guess since i wasnt too thrilled about the sauce, who cares. so 3 of my friends wanted to order a side at $7 each, a side note about this. you cant just order a side. you have to ""add it to an entree"". which we didnt know and my friends were hungry but didnt want awhole meal. so one friend added one onto mine and then so did a second. the waitress got nasty with us and rolled her eyes and huffed a little when she said okay no more people can do this. well my other friend who ordered an entree took the last person at my table to add a side to her meal. haha. we might have been annoying, but it didnt state anywhere we can just order a side as a dish, tried to get around the rules. oops.anyway, the service. the service was pretty slow once at the table (drinks at the bar were served quick) and the waiters and waitress here just dont seem to happy to be here. just no enthusiasm, they just seemed blah. ans barely came by us. took forever to wave someone down for something and forget about paying the bill, took awhile, we could have walked out on the bill if we wanted to be assholes.i gave it a shot and there were things i liked, the drinks, and actually making reservations online through yelp was easy--easy to update your reservations too, but in general the reservations were pointless even on a slow saturday night, the food is just not that great, and the service needs help and some smiles. i gave it another shot, but it seems like its the place you should stop into and grab a drink and just stare at the decorations.",24,5,7
45,Sam E.,"San Francisco, CA",17,51,5,5.0,10/18/2018,Halloween lovers - this place is amazing!! Decor and ambiance are amazing. Staff was super fun and friendly. Drinks were festive (but taste was pretty standard). Really narrow place which makes it intimate. Didn't eat the food so can't comment but it seemed like it was on par with the decor.,,,
46,Jennifer V.,"Jacksonville, FL",156,276,817,5.0,4/12/2018,"I wish Beetle House was closer to where I live in Florida. Like most bars and restaurants in NYC, this place is tiny inside. If you want to eat dinner here, I seriously recommend you get a reservation. Luckily, I just wanted to come and spend some time here so sitting at the bar was exactly what I wanted. We could have stayed all night, just taking it all in, but unfortunately we could only stay about an hour. The drinks are tasty and I love how everything is themed. The bartenders and characters are all very friendly. If I ever make it back to NYC, this will be one of my first stops.",,,1

48,Kiara C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",399,7,23,4.0,7/23/2018,"This was a cute and small place. Loved the theme and decor of the place. My friend made reservations and we although we arrived early, we got seated immediately. The hostess was super friendly and nice. Food came out pretty quickly and was delicious. I would have given this visit 5 stars but my friend and I had to ask for water more than twice. It wasn't packed either so I guess they just forgot about the water. Other than that, super cool place, great food, service and picture worthy!",1,,
49,Ken K.,"Manhattan, NY",90,2,0,3.0,7/11/2018,"My daughter and I were really looking forward to this experience.  In fact, we basically planned our NYC trip around it.First, the Good:The decor for the restaurant is spot on. The staff is very nice and were accommodating when we arrived much earlier than our anticipated reservation time, as we had a show to catch after dinner.  The food was excellent!  I had the buffalo wings appetizer and the filet for my entree.  They use a 2 level system for the menu. You pay either $35 or $45 and get an appetizer and entree based on your level.  I like that.Now, the Bad:While they were accommodating with our reservation, they failed to tell us that there were no characters until at least 5:30, which was why we came.  This information is not listed anywhere on the website.The health inspector showed up just after we ordered for a routine inspection.  But, because of this, our food was held up about 30 minutes.  Ultimately this wasn't a huge deal because it allowed us the cushion of time for the characters to show up.  Let me be clear that the inspection was completely routine and there were no issue, as far as we could tell.When the check came, I was surprised by the total.  The menu clearly says $40 for the Level 2 ordering. However, we were charged $45.  When I mentioned it to the server, she said it that menu should have been tossed after they updated it.  I expected to get the difference refunded or at least offered.  This did not happen.  When I suggested they fix the menu l, she said ""No worries!""  What?  No worries to you maybe.  But, I would have appreciated the difference back.  Especially since there were still no characters there yet.We were ""allowed"" to hang out, as The Corpse Bride would be up in about 30 minutes.She was the only character to show up. We were really expecting at least a few.While the food was great, I think they may want to come softer a more family friendly version of the menu, as there are no real options for kids, other than Mac and cheese for $35.  There was a family of 4 who came in and left before ordering.  We overheard them arguing that it was to expensive.So, Beetle House is a cool place if you go at the right time, I guess.  Just double check the prices before ordering.",1,1,1

The drinks were delicious but a little sweet for my taste.I didn't get to try the food because by the time I got there the kitchen was already closed however I am interested in going back and I can't wait to try whatever they have on the menu.

Thank god, our reservation was so late (945p) we decided to do drinks and apps at another place prior so we were hoping to just do dessert here! We were stuffed LOL no biggie though we just took some food home. It was delicious!! Drinks were yummy too!!!! I would deff come back and just sit at the bar for drinks & dessert  And I got my pic with the Corpse Bride! I think they do a different character each night. All in all it was a great experience! Wish they had a spot on Long Island!!",,,1
54,Tina D.,"Wisconsin Dells, WI",10,10,0,1.0,9/12/2018,Horrible!! Entire place can fit in the first floor of my house. Super tiny and cramped. Bathrooms are so small you actually can't even use them. No hostess stand or area to wait for your reservation. You have to stand against the wall while people are trying to squeeze by you. The few tables they have are smashed together. It was terrible so much so that we didn't even eat we just left and went to an actual place that had room for customers. It sounds cool but don't do it to yourself. We were completely disappointed.,2,1,

56,Sara H.,"Virginia Beach, VA",316,26,5,5.0,8/5/2018,Beetle house is awesome! From the decor to the character actors it's definitely worth checking out if your in the city. Try the Mac and cheese it's awesome!,,,
57,Richard M.,"Staten Island, NY",0,5,2,3.0,8/19/2018,"The food was alright, I had the mushroom sliders (4 out of 5) the burger (2.5 out of 5)  and brownie (3 out of 5)The drinks had themed names but they were just standard cocktails nothing to rave about.Over all 3 out of 5 for this place, cool place to check out once and call it day.Be aware - menu is all prefix not always a bad thing but the value was hard to justify, I guess you need to earn when you hire someone in a costume to match the Decour and greet the guests which was a nice touch 5 out of 5 for that one.",,,
58,Lee F.,"Williamsport, PA",0,12,2,5.0,8/18/2018,"I cannot believe the incredible turnaround this place has made in a year. The food is INCREDIBLE and consistent. I got a few of my friends hooked on it to the point that we drive the 3 hours to NYC JUST for Beetle House. I personally get the This is Halloween to drink, the Willy Wings and Cheshire Mac as my entree. I've tried almost everything on the menu though, and everything is excellent. I'd also like to credit the staff, they are so kind and patient every time I'm there. As someone who tried it out the first month it opened, I can truly say Beetle House has finally found its rhythm.",,,
59,Nicole N.,"Brooklyn, NY",156,152,181,3.0,12/31/2017,"We came cause my friend loves Tim Burton and anything about his work. We were quite surprised when an actor and actress dressed as Sweeney Todd & Ms. Lovett came in. The costume was spot on. The guy who played Sweeney Todd was pretty good. It was fun messing with him. Everything was themed and intricately detailed-down to names on the menu. Cocktails were pretty good. The food was well designed but taste wise, I wouldn't stick around for any. It matched the theme too well... in terms of it didn't taste very good at all for human beings still living. I'd come back again definitely but only for drinks. The space is small, and they usually take reservations nowadays. I'd definitely call in to see if they have space. They do do some walkins at the bar though.",3,,

My coworkers and I planned a night out to experience this themed bar and we were not pleased. The food was gross and I wish there was a better way to put it. The Mac and cheese had a gross Ragu sauce on top, I couldn't even take another bite. Absolutely absurd prices for low quality food. Aside from that, I wanted a margarita and it was terrible. I don't really understand how a margarita could taste so bad, but here we are. The one star was for the friendly waitress & the actors who made the experience somewhat bearable. Wouldn't recommend this place.",,,
61,Heather D.,"Medford, NY",55,3,0,3.0,7/9/2018,"This was a cute dive bar / restaurant. I love TimBurton and themed places in general. The decor was on point and they had two interactive charters walking around. They offer a prefixed menu to price options. The portions are great sizes! Food was fresh and tasted great. The only downfall in the size you literally can't move.. elbow to elbow. So for someone like me who has slight social anxiety is was a-little much for me to keep bumping into people and I didn't get to enjoy the quirky decor as much as I would have liked too. It was a great experience and glad I checked it out. On the fence about it I will return, maybe for lunch and try to get a table in the back area.",1,,

I ordered the drinks the appetizers and entrees together ($35-$45 prefix menu) the drinks take a little too long and they weren't so good but well we tried to enjoy it anyway because we were prepared to sth weird BUT we ordered for appetizer a salad, wasn't calculating the time but I uploaded a photo of my drinks on my instagram history and it says 32 minutes ago...

67,Kevin C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",49,147,259,5.0,5/28/2017,This place was very cool and dark lol. I came here because my friend nikki wanted to have her bday dinner here. We had reservations for 6pm. Many of us was late. I arrived 720pm. Let me say this the waiter and customer service was great. They kindly informed us that we would need to relocate to the bar 15 minutes  before 8pm. The waiter explained that they have another large party and they give reservations about 1 hour and 45 minutes to eat. I had just places my order. The waiter was so polite and asked if i would lime to have my food bought to the bar... ( smart thinking because i aint wana carry no food). So my order toom a whike to come out. I go the 30$ prefix meal which comes with an appetizers side and an entree and desertAppetizer was the hot wings mmmm very delicious could habe been spicey but was fresh and tasty Side was mac and cheese. So it was pretty much velvet mac and cheese straight out the box. Lol but they had bread crumbs and tomatoe sauce which made it taste better My entree. Was the edward scissor hand burger. OMG that burger was so big. I got my burger well done. I could not finish it. For desert i got the brownie. They put salt on the brownie. At first it was good but then too salty could nit taste the chocolate as the salt toom away from it. Overall my meal was good and i was full.I got a nice drink not sure what it was called but it had gin and vodka.. it was sweet and i enjoyed it.The bartender made my long island ice tea perfect. I told her how i want it  strong and sweet. She made it just that way i enjoyed my drinks.Now lets start with beetle juice. So i was eating and he ran hp on me. Thst dude aint know im from broomlyn we dont like that. At first i aint know the guy worked there. I was like yo bro why u touching me. Soon enough i realized he worked there and he was in acting mood trying to make all customers laugh.  We took pics with him .. he really acted like beetle juice from the movie kinda creepy but cool.Overall this place was cool the experience and atmophere was great. The food was good. Im not sure if i come here again. But i would def recommend that you come here if you never been its a great experince. Wait as im writing this review i may come back for that big ass burger that had me full until i was writing this review.Seriously if you from nyc check it out if you want a different experience. If you a fan of the movie then you must check this place out. And if your a tourist then this may be a good place to go out to eat at an affordable price,1,4,1
68,Aleksandra E.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,40,96,4.0,2/12/2018,"I was very excited to come an visit this place, but got little disappointed. It's a tiny place where you can barely move , but this is not the point , the thing is that the characters, even though with a good makeup and clothes, are kinda boring. I think they need to engage ppl more , because this is THE THING of the beetle House.  Otherwise, the food is ok , even though I ordered medium rare burger , but I came out well done , the steak could be also better . The only thing that I totally liked is cocktails which are really good . So may be next time , if I ever come will stick with the bar .",,,

The experience would have been better if the group next to us weren't being so dramatic (they Wouldn't drink the drinks because it had dry ice in it, they said the Mac didn't have enough spice). Enough about them... the building was quite small! It makes sense that a reservation is necessary!! The fishbowl was an amazing drink for 2(strong and sweet but you should be aware of this due to the description). The hostess and waitress explained the process very well. You will either have a $35 meal or a $45 meal (both come with an appetizer and entree). The entree is really where the cost comes from. Obviously, a steak or shrimp is going to be pricier than the salad of vegan option. Our steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and my shrimp and andouille were very good as well! The mashed potatoes were ok. My appetizer was the truffle fries, perfect!!! My partner had the nachos, he loved them. We tried each other's but were very happy with our own selection so we kept it at that! Lol!",,,
71,Sumera A.,"New York, NY",0,12,29,1.0,8/20/2018,"Food is over priced and was not fresh. We could not  share plates. There was a funky smell coming from the Thai noodles. Not only was the smell unbearable of the Thai food but it was scorching hot, right out of the microwave. The restaurant itself smelled like an airplane bathroom, as if the toilet had not been cleaned in months. At the time we went their music system was having technical difficulties. The music would go from from volume 7 to 27 randomly. We did not want drink so we asked for tap water. The water was luke warm, no ice, and that too tasted funny. However The waiters were nice. Beetle juice comes out and chats with the guests. But he is not with paying $65 a meal for. I wouldn't go back nor recommend it",2,1,1

When we arrived we were seated and ordered drinks.  Then were told that the menu was prix fixed menu.  I was not aware when I made these reservations.  When we asked if we could just order appetizers,  I was told if that was the case we would have to move to the bar.  I don't understand why when I had reservations.  Why weren't we told.  I do not recommend this place.  It is not really Tim Burton themed either.",2,1,1
73,Peter D.,"Brooklyn, NY",4581,2941,8893,3.0,4/11/2017,"Things You Probably Already Know About Beetle House:1. This is a bar/restaurant devoted to all things Tim Burton, Halloween, horror, dark, and lovely. If that doesn't appeal to you, you might be better off elsewhere.2. This bar/restaurant will most likely be full of people who are into all of the above, and will be celebrating such. If you don't want to be around people geeking out and taking pictures, and perhaps dressed up and celebrating a themed birthday party while screaming, ""CHUG! CHUG!"", you might be better off elsewhere.3. If when you go out to dinner the quality of the food and drink is more important to you than the overall experience, you might be better off elsewhere.4. This is the kind of thing that is as fun as you allow it to be. If you're going to come in here, have fun with it. Things You Might Want To Know About Beetle House:1. It's smaller than you think.2. There will probably be at least one talented performer in costume/character on hand, ready to show you a good time. He may or may not recommend that you taste his Willy (there's a burger on the menu by that name). 3. The food is solid, but nothing spectacular. That said, I tasted his Willy, and I liked it. Although, a few items we ordered didn't have all the ingredients listed.4. If you are the last people in the bar that evening (and even if you're not), the man in costume will gladly hold knives to your niece's throat and pose for other fun photos. He may even wait for your wife as she exits the bathroom, and scare the pee out of her. You would think that she would have no more pee in her after exiting the bathroom, but such is life.",17,18,8
74,Dulce B.,"Mesquite, TX",57,19,25,2.0,11/9/2017,"So we flew all the way from Texas to NY and we had to add this to our list. When we got there I was so excited. We knew you had to make reservations but we thought it was only if it was for something big thinking they also allowed walk ins. But to our surprised we were sent away.On our way out Beetlejuice showed up and started making small conversations with the guest and I thought it was pretty cool. I loved how everything was bettlejuice themed. It was unfortunate that we didn't get to experience there food, but the 5 minutes out the door were kind of interesting since Beetlejuice made small talk with us.",2,,
75,Amanda B.,"Washington, DC",243,253,288,5.0,4/7/2017,"I really enjoyed my experience at beetlehouse. I had to wait a little past my reservation, but the staff was great and I was so press to be there, so I honestly did not care. Themed bars go a long way. Trust if this was any other place, I would have left lol. According to other yelpers, it takes  a while to get reservations. So I got really lucky getting one the same day only hours before. (Must have got a cancel) Surprisingly, the food was good. I truly had my doubts, but everything turned out great, even the cheesecake.   Sucks that it's so tiny. I could definitely get my party on in there.",4,,4
76,Ana R.,"Queens, NY",75,2,9,4.0,7/8/2018,"The theme was awesome. The menus even made the experience complete. I wish it was a bigger place, there was no place to wait for our table so it was best to leave and come back closer to our  reserved time. One big negative thing , and I speak freely due to the fact I manage a hotel. I was not a fan of the back of the house staff , going through the restaurant with frozen bags of French fries and other products where the guest are enjoying dinner. The big idea is to enjoy the decor and the overall atmosphere ; however passing chefs from the front door to the kitchen where it's already a cramped place is not the ideal picture I want to take. Other than that it was a cool place to try out ! Big thumbs up To Beetle Juice and Willy Wonka who made our evening even better !",,,
77,Savannah J.,"Dallas, TX",198,9,0,3.0,4/20/2018,"So... let me start by saying that I enjoyed my experience here. My mother and I took a trip to NYC in October and I was dying to try this place as. I, among many other people who visit this place, am an extreme Tim Burton fan! #1! MAKE A RESERVATION. We went the 3rd week of October and made our reservation about 2.5 months in advance. We were seated immediately by a friendly host.Things to expect: it's very small. I had this expectation going into it and am used to a lot of places in NYC being smaller than you'd think. So that didn't bother me, but if tight spaces and narrow seating (a little less than a foot between tables) bother you... you may have an issue. The food. The food is good. Not great. It is a menu where you have to order by ""pre fixed"" options. I think $35/pp for level 1 and $45/pp for level 2... so if you are wanting an appetizer from level 2 but an entree from level 1.... you have to rethink your choices. Not a terrible thing... but just know you cant just order an appetizer or split an entree. The Cheshire Mac in Cheese was AMAZING! If you're looking for a good veggie burger... don't order the Veggie Corpse Burger. It fell apart and was pretty ""meh"" overall. But I had a few cocktails beforehand so I ate it anyway. (The ""This is Halloween"" and ""The Beetle Juice"" is TO DIE FOR!)The ""character"" we saw was Sally from Nightmare Before Christmas. Great cosplay but overall pretty lackluster in terms of being in character and giving you an experience. It just looked like she stood behind tables and tried to scare people (which, let's be honest, if you're spending your night at a Tim Burton bar... you aren't going to be afraid of someone in cosplay).Overall,  if this place interests you... GO FOR IT! Just know what to expect. Is this a place I'm going to return to EVERY TIME I visit NYC? No. Will I go back if I'm with a friend who wants to go? ABSOLUTELY!",2,,1
78,Alexis R.,"Orlando, FL",100,4,16,2.0,3/27/2018,"I guess I had higher hopes. We visited from FL and it seemed to not live up to the hype. I think the owners could do alot more in terms of decoration and effort. Reminded me of my 13 year old bedroom, but with liquor. Cool theme, solid idea, not the best execution.",5,,
79,Michael M.,"Wantagh, NY",44,2,2,2.0,4/28/2018,"I see a lot of reviews on here saying that this place is small... that is a HUGE understatement. This place is claustrophobic small. We had reservations for 6 at 9:30pm but we still had to wait because there were no tables available. It's a good think my friend couldn't make it and we were only 5 because they stuck us at a tiny table in the corner by the window and entrance. Drinks were good. The fish bowl was really good. The food was eh... definitely not worth the prices they charge. You can't just by appetizers. You have to buy a ""tier 1"" option for $35 or a ""true 2"" option for $45 which includes 1 appetizer and one entree. Portions were small and expensive. Atmosphere is cool, music was good and staff was friendly. It was ok for the experience but don't think I'll be rushing back.",2,,
80,Brittany J.,"Orlando, FL",63,50,122,2.0,3/12/2018,"*sigh* - It's with a heavy heart that I write this review and I'll tell you why.. So, like many people I'm sure - I first heard of Beetle House when it went viral on social media. Myself, being a huge Tim Burton fan was SO excited to visit on one of my trips to NYC. I was in town back in October of 2017 but was unable to get a reservation, so I knew on my next trip I would have to schedule way ahead of time. Knowing that I would be back in March 2018, I made my reservation either late January or early February - I can't quite remember, but it was well ahead of time. When we got to the city for our trip, all we could talk about and look forward to was our reservation at Beetle House. We planned an entire day on that side of town and looked forward to our spooky speciality cocktails and atmosphere. Upon arriving to Beetle House I was very impressed by the outside decor. As one would expect it was very dark and creepy looking and I could not wait to walk inside. When entering we were immediately met by a hostess asking if we had a reservation. We said yes and she walked us to our table. I feel silly not having thought about this prior, but the location itself was 10x smaller than I would have imagined. I feel silly because it's NYC and every location is small so, I should have known better. When you walk in there's a table or two with a long bar follow by a few additional tables. Our server walked us back to the far corner where my party of 3 would sit. The first kind of concerning thing to me was, there were about 6 tables in this back corner and we were sat within 1 inch of a table of 6 next to us. We were so close that our tables were almost completely touching. It felt as if we were sitting with their party. Again, I don't ding Beetle House that much for this because again I understand that it's NYC and they're working with the room that they have. I guess I was just surprised that they didn't space us out more being that it was 4pm on a Friday and there were only 3 tables there (including us). After a few moments a nice waiter came and brought us our menus, explained the menu and where we could find things and gave us some time to look it over. We of course wanted to try the speciality cocktails, so we spent a few moments reviewing all of the options.As we waited we began to look at the food options. We had just eaten at a restaurant prior to our reservation at Beetle House, but were wanting to try the delicious looking cornbread that we saw on the menu. When our waiter returned with our drinks we asked to put the order in. Our waiter looked at us quite confused and said that we could order the appetizer with one of the entrees. We were confused being that we weren't planning on ordering an entree, only an appetizer. We told him this and were told that we could only order the appetizer if we were also planning on ordering entrees and that the tables at Beetle House are reserved for people eating. I was immediately confused by this because there was nothing stating that when the reservation was made. The waiter stood there awkwardly staring at us and I asked him if he'd like us to move to the bar. He then told us that they take reservations every 15 minutes so that if someone came in wanting to eat that we would need to give up our table. I was immediately turned off by him saying that especially being that there were at least 5 other tables currently open. He continued to seem quite confused (as did we) and eventually walked away. We decided at that point that we would quickly drink our drinks feeling as if we were no longer wanted at that table. Now, the cocktails at Beetle House are all around $14. Including tax our bill came to around $50 before tip. Now, if we would have been allowed to order an appetizer, we would have then ordered another round of drinks. But unfortunately due to the awkward exchange with the waiter and/or Beetle House's policy with having to order entrees in order to sit at a table.. we did not. I left Beetle House just feeling very disappointed. I was so excited to come to this location for so long and had such a poor experience. Multiple friends who knew I had a reservation kept asking ""How was it!?"" and I had to sadly tell them how disappointing it was.I give Beetle House 2 stars for the general atmosphere (decorations, music) and the creative cocktails. I wish I could could give them more, but this isn't a place I would recommend to my friends. I hope that if Beetle House truly has a policy about the tables and having to order full entrees that they would make their customers aware when making a reservation. I feel as if that's information that you need to make prominent ahead of time being that I'm sure a lot of people come to a place like this wanting to drink rather than eat.",12,1,

We arrived there and they had ppl dressed up who were more than willing to take pictures with our group! The place is very small but has an awesome atmosphere and delicious food.

84,Matt K.,"Bayonne, NJ",136,4,5,3.0,5/20/2018,This place is cool for a special occasion or the special person into Tim burton atmosphere!  Beetle beetle juice beetle juice!   $35-$45 person person and prefixed menu.  Take a trip and see what it's about!  Kind of pushy wait service with a kind of we got you mentality once your in the door.   Be weary of what you expectations might be lead to because they can get pricey.  Nothing special as far the food went.  Pictures posted are of burgers on the menu.

Cash-only (but there's an ATM there inside).  Super narrow space (very difficult to get past people to get back to the bathrooms). Aside from the rather lengthy list of drawbacks/inconveniences this place is just COOL.  If you like Tim Burton, you'll love it. I'm sad we didn't see Edward Scissorhands but I'll have to come back to increase my chances.  Drinks: I tried The Nine, which is green and quite sour (Midori, sour apple vodka, etc.). It was alright but I'd recommend the Beetle Juice signature drink.  They also have blue fishbowls for 2 which from the description look like AMFs, proceed accordingly.",1,,
87,Frank D.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/27/2018,This place I've waited to make reservations for almost 5 months. I was so excited to come and celebrate my birthday there. Last week when my birthday came I was VERY disappointed beetle house had two characters only. Beetle juice was mostly at the bar only came to my table once. Their other character Victor did absolutely nothing just stood there it's a waste of time and a waste of money. Jekyll and Hyde club is way better I recommend that place.

It did not disappoint. While the place is pretty small, it is chock-full of spooky gems. The decor is awesome and the staff was super friendly. The food was really good and there are plenty of vegan/vegetarian options which was super cool. The best part about this bar is definitely the drinks. There are so many great cocktails to choose from and they are all Halloween themed. My favorite was ""This is Halloween"" which was a cider concoction! During dinner, there were characters from Tim burton movies walking around and visiting the tables and bar,l for pictures...so cool! If you're looking to share a drink with someone, make sure to order the fishbowl. Willy Wonka stopped by and added some nerds to our drink! Overall, really great, fun place to hangout!",,,

91,Heather J.,"Keller, TX",0,1,0,2.0,8/2/2018,"1 star for a cool atmosphere and another for good drinks but everything else was horrible. Made a reservation and showed up 10 mins early only to wait 40 mins before getting a table and we had to remind the hostess we were still waiting.  Very small, it's basically a wide hallway with the bar at the front followed by small dining tables and that's it. Only the corpse bride was around but she was on point and made the evening fun. Our meal was horrible,  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! I had the filet with garlic mashed potatoes thinking who can mess that up, well they did! My mashed potatoes had no taste of garlic and tasted like they were reheated. The menu indicated the filet is seasoned to perfection but so not true and I swear it looked like they boiled it or reheated that too. I took a couple of bites and that was all I could stand.  Staff knew I wasn't pleased with my meal yet did nothing to compensate. To end the night after a couple hours (majority of that is wait time btw) the waitress messed up our bill so they had to refund the full amount and then run it through again with the correct amounts but told us there would be a 24-48 hold on our credit cards for the refund.Seriously, the owners need to take a look at their business and who they have working for them and make some changes. If you're going to go here,  just go to take in the atmosphere and have a drink then have a nice dinner elsewhere. Oh, make sure you have cash on hand because the bar won't accept cards and the ATM machine was offline so I had to go for a walk to find one to get cash. Very disappointed with the overall experience!",1,,
92,Hayley J.,"Manhattan, NY",167,93,3,4.0,2/11/2018,"Wasn't planning on coming back to eat after my first experience, but a friend really wanted to go.  The first time I went, the food was lackluster and there were no costume characters really interacting with the diners despite it being a packed house close to Halloween.  You're paying for an experience, so it was pretty disappointing.  Went last week and the characters, Sally and Willy Wonka, were playful and interactive.  My friend loved it.  Sally even slipped her a note, it was very cute.The restaurant recently changed its menu and removed a bunch of dishes.  It's still prix-fixe, there are just fewer options, and you aren't able to choose your own side without paying extra.  Last time I came, my boyfriend and I opted for the cheaper option.  The food was nothing to write home about, especially the mac and cheese and ""Edward Burger Hands,"" it was just meh.  My friend and I opted for the more expensive, $45, option.  I got the Evil Dead Shrimp and my friend got the Sweeny Beef, and we each enjoyed our food.If you're a fan of sugary drinks, as I am, then you'll love pretty much all of the drinks.  I've tried the chocolate cocktail, the fishbowl, and the We Come In Peace, which tasted like a cookie.  The restaurant is super tiny and most recently we were presented with the check while sipping on our second round in order for them to start seating other reservations.  All in all, I'd go back for a cocktail but I'm in no rush to return to dine.",3,,
93,Max L.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,5,0,2.0,10/6/2018,"Very small dining area. Kitchen staff kept walking through dining area. Character actors did well. No beetle juice, definitely disappointed with that. Salad was mehh, nothing to write home about. Bacon on burger was raw and to get an idea of how raw, when I bit into it all the bacon came out. Bun was very tough. Would have been better if you can just order apps and not have to agree to a prefix. Would come in for a drink, but not to eat again",1,,
94,sandra b.,"Bronxville, NY",3,58,16,1.0,7/8/2017,"Mehhhhhhhhhh. So like everyone else says, it's a tiny hallway with a bar and some small tables. It also smells like a fish tank. We had a reservation for 9 which was miserable to get, and they ask for a credit card when you make it, so if someone in your party cancels- you have to pay for them anyway. So we were seated at 915, and didn't get to order food till well after 930. So I get that it's beetlejuice/Tim burton themed, they had someone in costume playing beetlejuice who was obnoxious. He (accidentally) stepped on my foot while we were standing in the awful hallway of a ""bar"" area waiting for our table, and when I told him he was sort of rude (in beetlejuice style) about it. He then decided he should come and annoy me all night which... made my already annoying stay worse. So the fishbowl drink, pretty but gross tasting. The whole prefixe menu thing is really lame too. The quesadilla was cold. I've never had an over seasoned burger till today, with sweet potato fries that were so salty it was obscene. The roll was old and stale and just blahhh. Then because the menu is prefixe you get dessert too, of which they didn't have what we wanted. The cupcake I got was drier than dry and considering they didn't have what we wanted I'd assumed it was amazing and that's why they'd run out. So, here's the lowdown. For 8 people, with one drink each, it was $500. Beetlejuice was obnoxious to the point I was ready to tell him something about himself, the food sucked, the drink was pretty lame too, and I'm extremely thirsty from the over seasoned and salted food. The music was good. I guess there's that. Just go somewhere else.",11,2,

While the staff was friendly and prompt, the drinks were awful (and we tried a few to make sure it wasn't just the ones we ordered), the food way overpriced and pretty bad. Overall we were pretty disappointed. We actually didn't even eat our dinner, we opted for some window pizza down the street.  We wasted an evening here instead of the many other places we should have eaten or tried out in NY.  I will say the shrimp cocktail was good, however how can you mess that up, its shrimp with cocktail sauce. :/ Overall sorry to say its hyped up way more than it is fun.  Sorry folks, one place I will leave off my re-visit list in NY. We did love the pics with the characters tho, that why I gave it a two star instead of 1.",,,

I got the $35 option with the beetle bread which was average at best. It wasn't particularly great and it was cold like the cheese had been sitting out for a while. My parter got the shrimp (not the mad shrimp that I seen they set on fire, that one was not on the menu anymore). And he got the wings for an appetizer. The wings were great after we got past a small mishap... the place is TINY. And the server put the wings down and one fell on the table and the guy used his bare hand to pick it up and put it on my partners plate and then walked off. We of course requested new wings and were obliged. They were very fast. However the Mac n cheese I got was pretty bland. Not worth the price at all. The shrimp was also very basic. The alcoholic drinks at loaded with alcohol so be wary of that!! There was one character, sally which was neat. But again if you are on a budget I would skip it.

The quesadilla was good, but the tacos were great! I got the Evil Dead Shrimp and my husband got the Sweeney Beef. The rice with the shrimp was a little dry, but the shrimp made up for it. My husband had no complaints about his dish. The steak was soft and my taste of his mashed potatoes with balsamic glaze was excellent! The only complaint we really had was the location of our table. The place is small, which we get, but between customers and waiters trying to get through, they kept bumping his elbow while we were trying to eat. Overall, recommend!",,,

It's an eclectic horror-themed restaurant, modeled after the Beetlejuice movie. After reading the reviews, I was hoping the Beetlejuice impersonator would be present but unfortunately, he was not on premises. The decor is of a ghoulish taste and a little macabre, fitting in line with the them and the menu. The food was really good. I think everyone was happy with their meal choices.

I went to the LA one in October and it was honestly waaaaay better than here in NYC. I was very disappointed. The place is super tiny, but I guess that's just the thing in New York. There were NO CHARACTERS on a FRIDAY night... why!? That's the whole point, the characters! So bummed after I noticed they weren't there, apparently they've been calling out due to holiday travels, but you could have back ups...Anyway, I tried to leave but I was going to be charged so the waitress was kind enough to offer that I just order an appetizer so to not get charged for the reservation. I ordered the Cheshire Cat cheese chips, mediocre and just basic cheese fries, but it got me out of there. Definitely recommend the one in LA if you wanna check this place out.

Upon arriving, we had to track down the hostess who was busy on her phone. We were seated at a table where everyone that walked past, bumped or hit into us.  The bartender brought our drink to us and slammed it down on the table and just walked away. The only high point was our server Derek who was friendly and nice. Food was average at best. Appetizers we could have skipped. He had Sweeney beef, which had good flavor but the meat was a little tough.  I had Goth pasta which wasn't bad. I ordered a chocolate cupcake for my birthday which was bitter and dry. There was some cool art in the place but for a huge Burton fan I was underwhelmed. This place could be so much better.",3,,

Eisley wasn't too much educated on the place but is very small with literally a couple tables that when I got there they were all reserved and there was literally no space to even stand and enjoy a drink. The only thing that I like was the great artwork and customs in theme of this bar from one of my favorite directors. Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to get a drink because the bartender was a little bit slow and not given us the tension even though the place was not as packed. I guess you need to make a reservation call in a bands but just doing the walk by to get a drink and enjoyed the environment what's the only thing that I was trying to look for. Not going to say that I'm never going back but to be fair I will definitely give it a shot again next time I go to New York next month and maybe go earlier to actually half the full experience of this place.,2,,

There was nobody dressed up and no special effect, just a regular Halloween decor throughout the place. At that point we thought we could just grab a couple of drinks and appetizers (which would have been around 50/50$ anyway) but we were told that with the reservation, we were supposed to order the 35$ fixed menu (1 appetizer and 1 main course). The food was not bad but overpriced, the drinks were good (12-14 $ each), but there was no character walking around and no special effect. The only special effect was one of the waiters knocking down my purse from my chair to the floor (the place is very tiny and you do eat elbow to elbow) without even apologizing or anything. I understand my reservation was at 4 and it was early, but it was December 29th, the city is full of tourists who try to go there because of all the advertisement this place is having and I expected to have the same service and entertainment I would have gotten if my reservation was at 7, since I was forced to pay for the full menu.

We actually got a direct eye-roll from the waitress bc we split a prefix meal (it was 10pm and we had already eaten dinner). Food was awful. Mac and cheese had pasta sauce in it and tasted like warmed spaghetti Os. Guacamole looked like the store-bought stuff (super smooth with nothing else in it). Ceiling was leaking.

I got the quesadillas (not the best), salad (surprisingly tasty), and the Edward burger hands burger (average). The desserts were reallyyyyyy lack luster. I got a tiny marshmallow and chocolate brownie square and he got a vanilla cupcake -- both were cold and just seemed store bought. Pretty disappointing for $100.

Too small to be a restaurant. Everyone walking past kept bumping into my bf. trying to get to the bathroom was another task. Food was.......nothing to rave about even though my bf really enjoyed his dish. They are overly priced for what you get. Drinks were great.

We ran a little late getting there but was still seated with no problem. The decor is some official sketches from the great Tim Burton himself. Other pieces are tribute art pieces that help set the mood perfectly. It's very narrow and dark lit (all tables are lit by candles) so if you're claustrophobic this might not be for you.Beetlejuice was our server. Right there it doesn't get any better than that! He catered to every guest, took pics, told jokes, shook your hand with a hand buzzer the whole nine! I ordered the Chocolate Chocolate Martini and the Cheshire Mac and cheese that comes with a center dollop of cool Marinara sauce. Both of which are EXCELLENT.  The mac and cheese is definitely enough for 2 people OR for one super hungry individual. I had to take half of mine home. After i paid the bill I took a few pics of the decor and, of course, snagged a picture with Beej himself next to arguably my favorite art Beetlejuice art piece in the whole restaurant. End result: I absolutely adore this restaurant. As a goth, it's made for people like me. I do HIGHLY suggest making reservations at least a month in advanced if you even slightly interested. But the drinks, food, and overall experience make it ABSOLUTELY worth it! I'll be back in NY in June for my birthday and I already made reservations to come back! Also a Los Angeles location is opening up in my stomping grounds. I can't wait to make that my new go to here on the west coast!",3,2,3

One can see they need to make money, but at least make the food edible...just stick to drinks. The place is too small to be a restaurant anyway.

132,Brenda A.,"Etobicoke, Toronto, Canada",48,65,322,4.0,4/26/2017,"I'm giving this place a four star rating based on the overall experience, and the enjoyment I received from it. First off, it's really easy to miss this restaurant if you are walking by, it's in the East Village, just tucked out of the way.  The restaurant is VERY small, I think it seats only 30-35 people.  You really need reservations to have a meal here. I took my husband for his 50th birthday dinner while we were visiting Manhattan last weekend. (Well I kinda did it for me too, since I love Tim Burton lol....) As I said it's a small space, very narrow, we had reservations for 7:15pm and were a bit early, but were seated within minutes.  Of course you are very close to your neighbouring table, but that didn't bother us, the table was big enough and seating comfortable.The menu has prix fixe pricing/offerings.  You can choose ""1"", ""2"" or ""3"" depending on where you are sitting or what you want.  People seated at the bar choose from the menu items marked with a ""1"", people seated at tables choose either ""2"" or ""3"", with the 2 or 3 option you get an appetizer, main with your choice of side, and a dessert!  For $30 for the 2 or $40 for the 3, that was a great deal, it ended up being a lot of food for either option.I had the beef stew/chilli to start, very good.  For a main I had the Mad Shrimp, very cool presentation and delicious!  I also had the Cheshire Mac and Cheese as my side, very nice and creamy.  After that I was very full and had to take my cheesecake back to the hotel to eat later :)  Okay, so Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!!  I have to say, his appearance really made the night.  Not only was he dressed just like the movie character, he sounded and acted like him as well!  He was very quick and witty with the jokes, very happy to pose for pictures with anyone.  Wasn't afraid to shoot off some off colour jokes, which most everyone loved!  He was able to get a lot of laughs, and some ""screams"" out of the customers, which just made everyone else laugh all the much more.  My cheeks hurt by the time I left!If you love Tim Burton's work and don't mind Beetlejuice humping your leg randomly, please check this place out, the experience is worth it!",2,3,1
133,J Y.,"Williamsport, PA",4,23,0,3.0,12/26/2017,"Conclusion: I don't recommend the place because you won't be awed by it. However, it was interesting and not truly regrettable. Pros--------The decor is great for Halloween fans. Overall it was more Halloween party and less Tim Burton themed though. It hinges on being a con if you're in it for the Tim Burton experience. The costumed actor that met us had a spot on Willy Wonka persona. 5 stars for that guy. The food was good. It wasn't $40 a plate good but it was prepared properly The wait staff was friendly and helpful. The music was very Tim Burton with a little random Halloween mixed in. I enjoyed that a lot. The Cons------------The costumes greater doesn't actually do anything. When you walk in to the bar area nobody greats you or even acknowledges your presence. The whole place is about the size of a large dorm room so it's pretty damned awkward. Once you finally flag down a waitress to get you seated you should be prepared to throw some elbows to actually get to your table. I don't think the patrons are being intentionally rude, it's just that the place is all of about 8 ft wide. The menu forces you to have an appetizer and a main course. It's a significant amount of food and way too much for the casual diner. At either $30 for a burger style meal and $40 for rice and shrimp, the meal size doesn't justify the pricing. I'd also avoid the pricey drink menu. Water is about the only affordable liquid in the building. My girlfriend had a $12 thimble of wine and I sold a kidney so the kids could drink soda. The food quality is mediocre at best. My burger was prepared to the correct temp and my plate of wings was decent. The shrimp was mid sized but cooked properly although nothing to brag about. The rice was tender and they nailed the taste of fresh cardboard. The salad used decent greens and not just iceberg lettuce so that's a relative pro. It nearly made me appreciate remortgaging my house to pay the tab. The music is awesome and you'll know this because their amps are turned up to 11.",,2,
134,Shawn F.,"Covington, KY",62,650,962,3.0,8/31/2016,"They require reservations, which is fine.  That being the case, however, when you check in for your reservation, they should make a note of it, so you're not kept waiting for 90 minutes, completely forgotten & ignored, while they eventually shift the blame on a new bartender. They did comp our drinks, though.That profoundly frustrating initial snafu aside, Beetle House NYC makes for a delightfully macabre dining experience, geared primarily for those who are fans of the films & style of Tim Burton.  Of course, Beetlejuice is emphasized, with the character himself making appearances on select nights (in a perhaps slightly more bawdy & adult-oriented incarnation than the film version), alternating with Edward Scissorhands.  On the night my friend & I visited, when not posing for photos with guests, he spent time behind the bar & delivering drinks to tables.Decor is dark & dreary & again, heavily influenced by the work of Tim Burton, although this establishment has no association with the famous director.  Quarters are a bit cramped, so you may want to make an earlier reservation.I had their Cheshire Mac, which was an exceptional 7 cheese mac & cheese, with chicken, garlic & sea salt bread crumb with tomato, along with garlic mashed potatoes & a virgin version of their Beetle's Juice drink.A fun, tiny place that certainly has the atmosphere right (the music played was a mix of themes from Burton films & other '80s songs) & I'd certainly go back, although I'm hopeful that the issue with our reservation really was a one-time thing.  That's not what I'd heard elsewhere, which is a bit troubling.",4,1,3

The negative reviews for this place are pretty hilarious, when you walk go into a Tim Burton themed bar you should expect things to be a little, ""off"". I mean there's a grown man dressed, as a movie character running around claiming his drinks will get you pregnant.  I didn't eat here, I just hung at the bar and enjoyed my time sipping drinks, chatting with Tim Burton lovers, and watching Beetle Juice creep on every lady who walked into the place, it was awesome. The Beetle House is very small and long so try and get here early in order to get a spot at the bar otherwise you'll been waiting a while for a seat. If want to eat you have to make a reservation, no reservation, no eat. I went with ""Edward's Lemonade"" which is basically Old Fashioned with orange bitters. A solid drink that wasn't as sweet as a normal old fashioned, they use Bulleit Rye, which is a pretty standard whiskey base these days. My Beetle House partner in crime went with the, ""Beetles Juice"", Muddled blackberry and limes, Tequila, Blackberry schnapps, Angostura bitters and cranberry. This was very good and super refreshing and from what Beetle Juice told us may cause pregnancy. - A fun night out. Check- Decent drinks. Check- Random pictures of your favorite Tim Burton scenes.

This is definitely my new favorite place in New York now!!!,1,,1
144,Dominique D.,"Boonton, NJ",463,291,332,4.0,7/7/2016,"If I were you, I'd take the earlier, close-to-opening-date reviews with a grain of salt.Thursday nights in NYC - as you may or may not know - tend to be just as nutso as Fridays and Saturdays. From the bar to the service, you never know if something will fall short.I'm a Tim Burton fanatic. I'm also into 80s goth rock, new wave, current indie, etc. I also despise touristy, themed restaurants.Imagine my delight when I entered and saw that this place was an intimate bar and dining space, with a gothy feel and Tim Burton inspired artwork. The hostess, server, and busboys? Not over the top, at all. Super relaxed and chill, which was a nice surprise. The resident Betelgeuse? Spot on and super fun. The music selection was everything I could have hoped for: a mix of goth/80s/indie rock peppered with soundtracks to the Burton films. The overall experience definitely warrants return trips. I could see myself popping in just to sit at the bar.So how were our cocktails? Both the Sparky's Minty Margarita and the Glen or Glenda were strong (yay!), but I have to say that the Glen or Glenda reigned superior. It was delicious, spicy, and expertly mixed.Though the shrimp dish served engulfed in flames looked pretty bad a**, I had to go with the highly recommended Victor Van Pork. SO GOOD. The honey garlic butter bun didn't really translate but certainly didn't detract from the delicious flavors of the dish. The Corn Bucket was a tasty side that used just the kernels and not the whole cob. The Cheshire Mac didn't quite live up to expectations: the sweet stewed tomato sauce was interesting, but the dish could have greatly benefited from more of an actual cheesy sauce.One of their dessert offerings for the night was a lemon ""tart"" - this was a New York style lemon cheesecake with a layer of meringue on top. Definitely enough for two people to share and sinfully delicious.So there you have it. I believe it's been exactly two months since Beetle House opened, and I am so happy to see that they've settled into their groove. If you haven't gone yet, do so..but relax, and remember that it's inspired..not a gimmicky tourist trap.",5,2,3
145,Tara-Jean M.,"Providence, RI",85,10,5,5.0,1/7/2018,Awesome place!! Friendly staff and a overall cool existence! The dining room is tiny but makes it more of a cozy feel. The whole menu is pre-fix with one meal and one appetizer. A little pricy but a very nice dinner!,,,

The service was great- my only compliant was how small the restaurant is.... it's super tight. It maybe seats 30 people, very small. I went with 3 of my friends and we had a long bar type table- it would have been nicer to have more space and sit an actual table. The Edward Burger Hands burger was great, the Cheshire Mac was hands down amazing- one of the best mac & cheeses I've had and the sweet potato fries were perfect. I had a fish bowl as my drink, liked that as well. Super original, creative and artsy spot with surprisingly delicious food. Worth a try.",1,,1
147,Brian M.,"Jersey City, NJ",192,569,581,3.0,5/28/2016,"There are a lot of bad reviews here...I don't give out 5's left and right...but I don't think this place gets a 1 or a 2 from me...me...me. ~ Setup:Friend and I made reservations about a month ago for a Tuesday at 7:30 PM.~ Cons:- The place is VERY tight. No emphasis on the ""very"". - Prices could be better...even if this is NYC.Those don't even feel like major cons...if you're claustrophobic, go to MSG. If you're tight on cash, go to 2 Bros for a slice. ~ Pros:- Staff. They knew what they were doing, but they were so laid back and chill, that it looked like they were presenting at a Science Fair and all they had hidden under their tarp was a Popsicle. There was this aloof vibe, but they were so nice, it voided it out. - Food. I got the:EDWARD BURGER HANDS.1/2 pound all beef burger,smoked bacon, pepper jack,cheese, whole egg,avocadoroasted pepper,tomato,toppedwith sriracha cream and servedon a toasted bun brushed withhoney butter and garlic.It was good. I don't eat bacon, or things medium well (you can order it however you want, I don't know why I didn't say well done) but it was good. It fell a part on me, but I usually prefer eating my burgers like a burger bowl...is that a thing? Like, imagine a burrito bowl, but with a burger. Knife and fork...Team Edward Clean Hands.My lovely friend got the:MAD SHRIMP.sautéed shrimp with chorizoon a bed of sweet plantainmofongoThe plate came on fire...it's doused in 151 and then lit...on fire. That flame was massive. Huge I tell ya, huge. She seemed to like her meal.~ Kinda Pro:-DrinksI ordered Sparky's Minty Margarita - Muddled limes, simple syrup and mint leaves. Patron blanco, Grand marnier, and a splash sour mix for $14. At that price it should have came in a pitcher...but it was refreshing while it lasted. My friend got ""This is Halloween!"" - fireball, Pumpkin Liqueur, sour apple pucker, apple cider. Garnished with a lime for $12. It tasted just like Halloween...just look at those ingredients...only thing missing was a dead leaf garnish. Ignore all the bad reviews if you're a Tim Burton fan or love Halloween...or gimmicks. I mean, it's kind of dark in there, but hey...Tim Burton. The negative stuff seems kind of isolated, and as time goes on...they'll get better (the printer broke when we went)...so make reservations for Halloween 4 months from now or something and maybe they'll be that 5 Star status you're looking for.All I'm saying really is this...check this place out at least once......or twice...Or 3 times.Beetle House.Beetle House.Beetle House.",13,9,5

My party had reservations for 10:45pm but we were not sat until close to 12am. We really only came here for desserts and appetizers. Unfortunately, by the time we were sat, they were out of most of the desserts so we pretty much only got wings and cheesecake. The servers were extremely nice and Beetlejuice was awesome. I liked the place in general because I love Tim Burton. I just wish they weren't out of most of the desserts and I wish we didn't have to wait over an hour for our 10:45pm reservation.",1,,2

150,Sheila M.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,52,8,2.0,9/8/2017,"We went last night to celebrate the birthday's of three of my friends.  The friend who suggested this place is obsessed and follows it on Instagram.  When you have a restaurant that has a very specific type of customer looking for a pretty special, different kind of experience, it's a huge let down when no characters are present.  When we asked where Beetle Juice was, we were told that he's currently in a play.  Ummmmm, k.  So that requires some kind of commitment and predictable schedule on the actors part, perhaps have a sub ready.  The food was good. However, we could have each dropped $65 at any of the dozen restaurants on the block for just an ordinary meal.  We came for the fun and to interact with the actors and were super disappointed.  If you bother to contact the owner to let him know that you have a group of people excited for their visit, he won't let on that there won't actually be any actors present.",4,1,
151,Andy C.,"Houston, TX",134,29,1,5.0,9/16/2017,"This place is great fun, you are coming here for the Tim Burton theme.  Food was good for a theme restaurant.  The burger was actually delicious and my daughter loved her mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes.  Service was fast and Edward Scissorhands visited our table numerous times to give us haircuts.  My 4 year old daughter had a blast and it is her new favorite restaurant.  Also, a good price for the amount of food that you get.",2,2,1
152,Annie C.,"Flushing, NY",101,49,130,4.0,3/11/2017,"Highly recommended to come fri-sun for Tim Burton fans  just for the experience with the characters. Booked for 9:45 but actually sat down closer to 10:30 I believe. I didn't mind since some people were late so it worked out just fine. Came for my birthday on Friday for Edward Scissorhands but I'd recommend going when Beetlejuice is there as you know Edward is an awkward character and I'm sure Beetlejuice would get the party going. He's still amazing though  looks and acts JUST like him. He plays beetlejuice as well so got him to give me a preview (see my photos/videos) DEFINITELY get the mad shrimp, only wish it came with rice or maybe some bread for the mofongo at the bottom cause flavors were very potent. It comes on fire which my party loved!Seems most of their menu items are on the sweet side so if you enjoy sweet food and drinks, definitely for you! I, on the other hand, am not of fan of sweet things so food was just ok. However, food is definitely much better than I expected for a themed restaurant. Normally themed restaurants cant get the food right as they are focusing on their environment more so kudos to you guys. Cheshire Mac with bacon is made with honey....interesting twist. Beetle bread textures were good, I'd use a meltier cheese.Corn bucket was really good, just hard to pick up the loose corn with the fork they provided  lolSweeney Beef was very dry for a medium steak but the waiter said it's his favorite so maybe it wasn't good just that day. My friends said it's cause they used human meat lol My friends enjoyed The Butchers Stew (chili) and Edward Burger Hands. Fleet Street martini was too sweet for me but the fishbowl was GREAT. It was a pretty small bowl so I had it all for myself. Drinks are definitely strong which is just how I like it :) Cute wait staff too ;) very small spot.",2,3,2

If you don't like Tim Burton, well I don't know what's wrong with you but you should check this place out. The drinks are all catered to different movies that Tim Burton made and they are pretty cool how the movies turn magically into drinks.  It's cool that you can share the food and the way the way they come in a combo is a fresh wind of change that I liked. They only thing I didn't like is that fact that they are cash only in the credit card filled world. And the atm is awkwardly placed by the bar. BRING CASH. But I would definitely go back.",,1,
155,Cindy G.,"Murrieta, CA",150,116,100,5.0,11/19/2017,"This place was pretty spooky in the best possible way.  A couple of friends and I, came in from out of state for a concert (our favorite band was giving their final show in the US). We decided to go when a friend from NYC reminded us that this place was here, since it's easy to forget your original plans when you are having fun.  So we decided to Uber it over there.  We were about 10 min away. On the way there,  I checked yelp and noticed they accepted reservations, and fortunately nothing was available during the time that we were planning to arrive. So we decided to wing it and walk in as we had never been there so we really didn't know what to expect. So once we arrived we noticed it was a very small place. The door is easy to miss as it's black, haha.  When we walked in we were finally greeted by a host, she asked if we had reservations, I replied with no, and she followed up by saying there was no way that we could be seated tonight as she had a group of 17 people and the table of 6 that she was waiting for.  I was like ..damn?! You can only fit that amount of ppl?. As I mentioned before I didn't know that they required reservations, so I asked her if there was any more tables available, that we would be willing to wait, she asked how many there were of us I told her 6 and she said it was impossible to eat there that day. We can sit at the bar and have drinks but will be very crowded as it is a very tiny location. I nonchalantly asked what time the party of 6 would be coming in, at this time it was 8:56 p.m. and she mentioned they were supposed to be here at 8:30pm. She was gracious enough to let us sit at that table as the reservation never showed up. Boom! Hell yea! Let's get the bad stuff out of the way...ConsOnce again - IT'S VERY VERY SMALL which leads me to my next comment - MAKE RESERVATIONS... I cannot express this enough.... It's tiny and you can't just randomly walk in and hope to get a table...we got EXTREMELY LUCKY. So please please heed my advice, make a reservation. It's a little pricey, so make sure you pay attention to what you are ordering, haha. My friends almost had a heart attack when the bill came...lol. No beer or soft drinks apparently.   Bathroom could be cleaned a little more, and it was next to the kitchen which we thought was a horrible idea. ProsThe music was pretty bad ass, we had a great time talking and chilling.  Loud enough to sing but low enough to be able to hear eachother which was awesome. The food was delicious. One of our favorite things was by far the Mac n cheese..so dear God please try it, trust me you wont be disappointed.   By the time the burgers and other food arrived we were full from the pasta. Hahaha.  But everyone's entree was soooooo damn delicious we stuffed our faces as much as we could. Lol.  The mixed drinks we all had were definitely good,  so get dark and try something it. Nobody had anything negative to say about the food or drinks. Willy wonka was found walking around and constantly came to our table.  He was cool... The deco and theme of this place is awesome. Tim Burton's movies are some our favorites and we are so happy we were able to come check this out. Overall this place was great. We were lucky, and I would love to shout out Mariana as she was the host that hooked us up with the table after her reservation didn't show up. She was sweet and welcoming. This place is a must see if you enjoy Tim Burton's films.... awesome deco, great music and delicious food. Once again, (Mariana this is for you...i told you I would do this  lol)  ...guys.....PLS PLS ...make a reservation...sob stories about bdays or being tim Burton's  #1 fan...wont do it as they don't have the space to magically come up with a table. Lol...and you may not get lucky like me.  Happy yelping my friends!",,,
156,Lilah M.,"New Orleans, LA",36,36,8,3.0,9/9/2017,"Have been waiting to try this place-- dropped by a few weeks back without a reservation and though my friend and I befriended Sweeney Todd, we had to turn around and leave. Last night I finally got to go, having made reservations online over a week ago. (Note: you don't need a reservation to sit at the bar, but this place is not big and if the bar is full you will have almost nowhere to stand). We arrived a little early and got appropriately creepy cocktails at the bar, which I didn't realize was cash only (but maybe I should've because there's an ATM right there). We were seated soon after, and overall we enjoyed the night. A few things I wish I knew beforehand: 1- the menu isn't that big. I could see some pickier eaters having an issue. About eight items total for mains and a lot of shrimp, which I don't eat. 2- the menu is set. You pay $30 or $40 for an app, a main and dessert. That's it. There's no option to only do one of those things. This is unfortunate because if this was not the case I would be here all the damn time. 3- due to the size of the place staff and diners may bump into you at regular intervals. The food was very, VERY good. We made friends with Sally and she gave me a cockroach and a note so I think maybe we're dating now. A little disappointed not to get to see a more over the top character, but it gave my friend and I more chance to chat without having to ask Beetlejuice to buzz off, so that's probably for the best. Overall a good experience and would return for drinks only or for visitors who love Tim Burton. I am not a big enough eater to come by for that menu all the time.",2,1,2

160,Jamila C.,"Somerville, NJ",186,249,1148,5.0,2/25/2017,"This restaurant is a new favorite of mine. I've had this place bookmarked ever since its opening, and I'm glad that I ended up enjoying the experience. If you love Tim Burton's films, then it's worth dining here at least once. I had the veggie corpse burger -all veggie patty, topped with onions in a red wine balsamic reduction, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and peppers on a toasted bun. It also comes with mushrooms, which I omitted from my order (because I don't do mushrooms ew). The veggie burger is served alongside of sweet potato fries. I added a little ketchup (don't judge me, it's still a burger), and then I bit into the perfect veggie burger! It was so freaking good. I was eyeing the wings appetizer as the table to the right of me ordered it, and it looked and smelled amazing. I chose not to at the last minute, and I think I still regret my decision. But it doesn't matter, because I still enjoyed what I did get, which also included The Beetles juice off the drink menu (muddled blackberry and limes, tequila, Blackberry schnapps, Angostura bitters, with a splash of cranberry). I have no complaints about the food and drinks whatsoever and also enjoyed the presence of Beetlejuice himself. He was a riot. He had the voice, wardrobe, and makeup down to a T. We were all in stitches as he would head to our table or a neighbor's to do or say something that you would so expect from the Beetlejuice character. He was absolutely silly and everyone loved him. The restaurant is really small and dark -not a complaint, just facts. Reservations are a requirement. I received a text about fifteen minutes before my reservation time to say that our table was ready, so get there early. There's a bar when you first walk in, so you can wait there if you like. We reserved our table through Yelp's app which was quick and easy. A credit card is required for reservations to avoid last minute cancellations; however, there were no issues with that process either. And lastly, the service was awesome.",3,1,1

We got there a little early and we weren't allowed inside until our reservation which was at 2 because they weren't opened yet.After finally being seated in the SMALL restaurant (all of 10ish 2 top tables) we noticed our menus were not brunch, but the regular menu. We were all pretty disappointed.A few of us got some $14 drinks, and we were all appalled by the really small sizes and lack of flavor. WAY over priced.Moving on to the food. It wasn't bad, but was not worth what we paid. I got the $18 Edward Burger Hands Burger, and was expecting those huge topping that you see in youtube videos of huge burgers, but no. Shrimpy little normal topping. While the meat and flavors were good, it was way over priced. It came with sweet potato fries and I feel like there should've been more for that price. Also, who puts only 1 PIECE of bacon on burger?My cousin and her husband shared a ""corn bucket."" we were all expecting it to be ears of corn in a bucket, but it was corn in a dish with some sauces.It was also really dark in here. Walking in from the sunlight and trying to read the menu before your eyes fully adjust was unbearable. We had to pull the old people card and use the flashlights on our phones. Service was prompt but I don't feel like it was very friendly. We were also expecting to see Beetlejuice or some sort of Tim Burton character walking around, like shown in some photos, but that ever happened.This place was a total let down.

My husband ordered the shrimp quesadilla which was slightly small but he liked it. A few members of our party ordered burgers and wings which they said were tasty.

We were seated in a walkway and got bumped into a lot. It seems like if you had a big group (we were only two) you had a better seating choice. I guess from all the hype when this place first opened I was expecting more. But I did have fun, the food was good but the drinks were fantastic. The only bad thing is it's a fixed menu, you pick from options 1 or 2 and get one appetizer and main. While normally that's no big deal for most, we really like to get a bunch of appetizers and split a meal. Everyone was very nice although at the end we did feel like we got rushed out.

176,Aileen C.,"East Hartford, CT",31,4,4,2.0,4/1/2018,"We were very excited about visiting. Small funky place, super nice staff (really all very nice). The price fixed menus did not have many options, no fresh food options. Everything was covered in sauce etc. not very good, we all left scratching our heads. Go for drinks, don't stay for dinner.",1,,
177,Amy G.,"Nyack, NY",176,148,154,5.0,4/14/2017,I went here for my birthday it was awesome it's very small and we had to come back and we couldn't get a table to eat-you definitely need to make a reservation weeks ahead of time! Their drinks are to die for don't order the whiskey drink unless you're a big fan of whiskey it's very strong!,,,
178,Brooke T.,"Ellenton, FL",0,3,0,3.0,8/28/2018,"The atmosphere here is kind of cool, the pictures and lights when you walk in make it feel like something different. However, it's SUPER tiny. Makes it borderline uncomfortable. The menu is set up in a way where you either pay $35 or $45 based on your entree (and you also get an appetizer included with that price.) I got Mac and cheese and my husband got salad. The salad was great, and the Mac and cheese would've been much better except in the description it doesn't mention it's covered in tomato sauce which was disappointing. I ordered the filet, which was delicious, but the garlic potatoes that accompanied it were NOT. He ordered a vegan burger with sweet potato fries and was very happy with it. We ordered 3 drinks from the cocktail menu, Beetle Juice, Glen or Glenda, and the Nine. They were all bad. Little flavor and tasted like strong liquor. Our waitress was AMAZING and the service was great. We left full, but not astounded.",,,
179,Andrew C.,"Providence, RI",0,4,0,1.0,1/28/2018,"So much to say, no energy to say it. Whatever I had has been coming out of both ends. Whether it's the fact that the drinks are made in the same tumblers without ever being rinsed let alone washed, or the food is prepared the same. I was astounded how disgusting the bartender was as far as sanitation. Never once washing her hands between cashing people out and grabbing the ice barehanded. The decor is ok. But for the cost of the garbage they serve, I'd hope for better. To claim this is Tim Burton's place has to be a joke. Unless you are an experiment for an upcoming movie where bacteria and filth invade your body, he's got nothing to do with it. If I had four thumbs, they'd all be pointing down! The one star I gave it is the imagination that it's a shooting star and will ignite this travesty of a business. Don't go! It's about as filthy and depressing as the netherworld waiting room.",3,1,
180,Miri Q.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",58,3,2,5.0,8/6/2017,"I loved visiting this restaurant!! The decor is amazing! The beetlejuice actor is sooo funny and very attentive! The food is good, it's not the best food in manhattan but hey, you don't go there for that, you go because it is fun!!! Right now it is very popular so it will be packed, but try to relax and enjoy the experience!!The drinks are spectacular!!! So yummy!!!!",2,,1
181,Nicole A.,"Los Angeles, CA",848,673,374,1.0,7/5/2017,"Do you want to squeeze into a tiny, cramped space where music is blaring, cold air is blasting you down and you have to wait an hour for your overpriced, over-seasoned yet bland food? Then, I invite you to visit Beetle House. We had reservations for 7:30 and we were seated on time, which was great. The menu is a prix fix so if you wanted to order one tiny thing, you are screwed. You must order an appetizer, dinner and a dessert - portions are gigantic and as I mentioned above, the food is rather lacking. My guacamole tasted very bland, the mac and cheese I ordered tasted like box macaroni with a basic marinara/ketchup sauce and the salted brownie I ordered was more salt, less brownie. They had asked us to move from a table in the back to a table in the front - we were totally fine with that until it became apparent that the reason no one wanted to sit there was because it was right near the door and because the a/c was BLASTING down. They also forgot about us. As I said, it took an hour - probably more to get our food and we were starving by this time. The waitress barely swung by our table, delivered our check and that was it. The receipt was not itemized and I was on a business trip so later, I emailed them and of course, received no response. Do not come here. Such a tourist trap. It's like a group of friends got together one night, got so drunk and decided to just open up a restaurant inspired by Tim Burton without really thinking about the skills required i.e. customer service, cooking skills..etc. If you must come here, get a drink and then promptly leave.",6,,
182,Iris R.,"New York, NY",38,13,2,1.0,7/2/2018,I had the mac and cheese and fish tacos both had no flavor which sucked ! Their was only one waitress so for our reservation which was at 6 it ended up being closer to 7. She took forever to take care of us but at least she was nice. They serve lukewarm tap water too by the way . The decor is cool and beetle juice was funny but I'd never waste my time again. Too bad cuz I'm a huge Tim burton fan !,2,,
183,Ciara D.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,40,2,2.0,3/4/2018,"The concept of this place is fun and the menu is clever. The drinks however were watered down and just not up to par, the food was not good either my party did not enjoy it nor eat it and it's a cash only place and they include gratuity already on the bill which is a total rip off because the service wasn't even that good to get a 20% tip. The only cool thing was they had. A guy dressed up as willy Wonka walking around to greet guests and the waitress was dressed like beetle juice. The way the website makes the place look like a happening spot and dim lighting and great music is so opposite of what it really is. The ravioli and the Mac and cheese pasta was so soggy and slimy it was just gross. Defiantly not worth the $300 meal!",1,,
184,Amber S.,"Pennsburg, PA",0,2,1,5.0,11/25/2017,Was such a great place. I can't wait to go back food and drinks were wonderful as well. The service was amazing. I love Tim Burton and loved this place thank you everyone who makes this place what it is.,,,

Had mac and cheese salad and coke my daughter had black ravioli salad and coke....I spent 100dollars on that? Was just so underwhelming not a place too drop 100dollars...not going back, very unhappy",3,,
191,Stephanie F.,"Brooklyn, NY",491,452,8,4.0,3/11/2017,"It took my friends months to get a reservation here! We were originally booked for a Saturday night dinner at 6pm, but at the last minute the restaurant called us and changed our reservation to 4pm. I'm not sure what the reasoning is, but I understand that Beetlehouse is pretty popular now and they were probably accidentally overbooked. Nonetheless, we were a bit disappointed but were flexible with our reservation.The place basically opens at 4pm, so we were one of the first tables seated. The decor inside is fun, and the theme kind of reminds me of Jekyll and Hyde. The walls are filled with fun Tim Burton memorabilia and the music was a mixture of his movie soundtracks (a lot of Sweeney Todd!!)We read a lot of good stuff about the macaroni and cheese so we ordered the entree as an appetizer to share. The mac did not disappoint! I may have been starved for cheese and carbs at the time after a month long Whole30 diet so I was pretty stoked and very pleased. Well worth it and definitely a dish everyone should consider!For my real entree, I ordered the burger and the pulled pork sandwich. My friend and I went halfsies for the sandwiches. Both were good but nothing could really compare after the mac and cheese. For drinks, they have a menu of specialty cocktails. I had the Coco Skellington which was really nice! It wasn't overly sweet, and surprisingly strong with a nice citrusy taste. My only disappointment was that Beetlejuice didn't come out during our meal. It was probably too early for him. Or maybe no one had the balls to say his name three times...!Beetle House was definitely worth the long reservation wait! It's not something you'll likely be going back to over and over again, but it was fun and cheesy in a way that wasn't over the top!",,2,
192,Franklin R.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",50,1,0,5.0,8/20/2018,"Darkness(not literally) and dining at its finest. The theme Beetle House is renown for goes a long way. From menu options to literal cosplay, they keep authentic. The food was really great and the Waiter was helpful and honest.",,,
193,Alexandra A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2,21,25,3.0,2/27/2018,"Came here on a Saturday night with my friend after the two of us had been wanting to come for a long time. Overall it was a disappointing experience. Originally we were going to get dinner here but when we walked in there was no one there to greet us and let us know if we could get a table so we just awkwardly got two seats at the bar like welp....We sat at the bar for around 15 minutes (not many people were there) with no sign of life from the bartender as if we were ghosts and she didn't see us. Could have easily said I'll be with you guys in a minute. She finally acknowledged us and just said ""what do you want""......so my friend and I split the big fish drink. Still no one approached us about if we wanted to order food/ give us a menu or sit at a table so we just decided that after the drink we would go and eat somewhere else. There were several empty tables so I'm not sure what the deal was. Overall the staff was just absent and the music could have been more lively rock music to improve the vibe of the place it just added to the gloomy staff vibe and didn't have any relevance to the tim burton films. The willy wonka impersonator came out, but he just stood against the wall. The best part about this place was the decorations and the big fish drink was good. I would say it's definitely a place to stop in and see, but don't expect too much or you'll be disappointed.",1,,
194,Deirdre W.,"Catskill, NY",66,2,0,1.0,7/12/2018,"Super disappointed and disgusted by Beetle House. Went for dinner with my 16 year old daughter on Friday night and wasn't impressed from the start. This place is beyond small, crowded, hot and dirty. Water glasses has old lipstick on them, food came out wrong and cold and very overpriced. The worst part was the Beetlejuice character coming to our table and telling my 16 year old she was due for a good f**k. Absolutely disgusting!",1,,

196,Larissa N.,"New York, NY",4,10,0,3.0,7/23/2017,"Only giving it 3 stars because the waitresses were very nice and accommodating and the drinks were good! Brought my cousin in for her birthday since she's been asking to go forever. I thought there would be people walking around in costumes, like the pictures but didn't see anyone. Maybe we came in on the wrong day though. We ordered the guacamole and mac & cheese for appetizers. The guacamole wasn't fresh, looked like the ones you buy in a supermarket pre-prepared didn't taste or look good. The mac & cheese was alright but for some reason both dishes were incredibly sweet and not savory. Don't recommend those! Also ordered the veggie burger and the Edwards scissor hands burger these were pretty good no complaints there.",2,,
197,Maria E.,"Denver, CO",809,1585,254,4.0,12/11/2016,"I was never a huge Tim Burton fan so this place wasn't that amazing for me. Still, I enjoyed it. It was dimly lit and decorated with a bunch of fan art. Sweeney Todd rolled up eventually and made small talk. Apparently, Beetlejuice comes in on different days.The burger was pretty good although nothing special. The fishbowl drink was very sweet and decadent and somewhat lacking in Swedish Fish.The bartender (turns out she was part owner) was amazing. Super friendly and fun to talk to.Walked in on a Wednesday at around 4pm and were able to easily get a seat at the bar. They do take reservations and have table seating but I think you might have to make them way in advance. So if you're eager to come here, just come at a less busy time.",7,2,6

199,Michael D.,"Medford, MA",2,26,10,1.0,12/17/2017,"When I was younger my mother made me eat soap for cursing, It only happened once. However, I would gladly eat that soap again if it meant I would never have to step foot in this place again. This place smells like a musty old halloween costume that you'd find in your grandfathers basement. I wanted to at least give the food a try, and I assumed it wouldn't be too bad. The mac n cheese was abismal and the burger I had tasted like a homeless mans socks. I figured I would drink myself into oblivion and ordered a fish bowl drink. It tasted like sugar, way too much mixer, and an ounce of liquor. There were two times that I almost started gagging at the food I ate. Between the four of us it came to $200. I would literally say that the happiest moment was when I stepped out of that god forsaken bar.",4,4,1
