0,Kadeem C.,"New York, NY",50,131,387,5.0,10/7/2017,"I've been keeping this spot secret for too long. It's time to share it to the masses!  Vibe: very nice, candles staaaay lit on each table-- they do play ALOT of Spanish music, but that's ok. A simple request can change that. -- the windows open up when it's warm out! Plus you've always got a view of what's going on outside. -- the bar is nice. Price: HAPPY HOUR 5P-10P-- hookah $10 ($5 refills)-- drinks $5-$8+-- foods $5-$7+Staff: Pleasant, cool, chill, laid back as there's mostly locals and friends here.  They can be a little too chill at times, but it's easy to get their attention.  ‍I RECOMMEND THIS SPOT!  Visit it, it's a great spot for pre-gaming as well OR stay here all night!",,,
1,Selena C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1,10,0,4.0,4/21/2018,"I like mimosas. The bartenders are friendly and the happy hour is great. Their hookah is amazing. The only reason why it's not getting 5 stars is because one they don't accept cards (which is annoying because I never carry cash and the process of going to the atm is also annoying) and two sometimes their music selection can get boring. I understand we're in dyckman but when playing an hour plus of Spanish music when there's a diverse crowd sometimes turns a person down. Other than that, great spot.",1,,
2,Carlos O.,"Elizabeth, NJ",93,350,756,1.0,8/18/2016,"I usally come to this place with my hood friends. Not the best place to take out a girl or Family. One of the many things i disklike about this place is the music, They will go all night non stop playing one genre. It gets to you after a while of listening to the same things. The hookas are not at all that i had better. Its funny how you will see people wearing basketball shorts in there. place is very sketchy and for some reason all drug dealers and gangsters love coming to this place. You might also keep in mind not to wear too much flashy stuff you will get robbed. Not inside but out side",3,2,
3,Radhaisy D.,"Yonkers, NY",0,7,2,5.0,10/7/2017,Love the drinks here! Happy hour lit! $5 mojitos & margaritas Music could be better.,,,
4,Andrea C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,8/23/2017,I went to Mimosa two days in a row. The first night I went I wanted to pay with my debit card an they told me the machine was down. I informed the manager I could only pay with my card. So she ended up using my card. I went the second day and the same thing. When it came time to close the bill she said her machine was down. I have been to plenty of entities where they either have a sign up or notify you before you sit down that the card machine is down. I don't know what type of business she is running but it is very unprofessional.,2,,
5,P S.,"Bronx, NY",0,4,1,1.0,2/20/2017,"If I could give this place no star I definitely  would this place was horrible !!!!! The margaritas where watery and me and my friends couldn't drink it , we then proceeded and asked the waiter to change them she had an attitude, and came back and they where the same, horrible service horrible music I hated it ! Never again and then 3 margaritas that we didn't even drink and a hookah that was trash the bill came up to $80 dollars.",,,
6,Erika G.,"Middletown, NY",4,40,20,1.0,5/17/2016,"It's a very sketchy place, after a few of my friends and I went there one night a week ago. She used debit to pay for a bottle.  Somehow, after that night her credit card she used as debit  had some random purchases made with her account .... Please watch out & use Cash here !! Will not be coming back to this establishment",3,,1
7,Summer H.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,1.0,1/23/2017,"Racist establishment! The whole place was filled with blacks and when asked why they weren't playing hip hop the response was the owner wants it to be latin sundays, although there were only about 3 latin people there. Please mention latin sundays at the door next time so you won't get any black dollars",,,
8,Sonny G.,"Malba, Queens, NY",2351,420,1223,4.0,11/11/2013,"I enjoyed Mimosa a lot. With that being said  I'm kind of disappointed that this cafe only received and overall 2.5 stars. This place isn't huge,  but it's spacious enough to have seating for hookah, a bar for getting schwasted, and dancing for us wild animals.  The last time I came here was after lounge hopping the area. Mimosa had no cover and a  nice size crowd on a Saturday night.  I have been here on a Friday before as well, and it wasn't nearly as packed, but it could've been the time that I went, which I believe was around 11:30. The music, like most of the spots in the area, is heavily Dominican, as is the crowd (which I love by the way). Lots of Dembow,Tipico, Merengue, Bachata, even some Salsa- and I'll tell you right now the people on the dance floor DO NOT take any breaks. SO LADIES: expect to be cuffin' at the cafe. That one dude that finally gets your attention, and has you swaying and whinin' on him... consider him yours for the night! Besides the Spanish stuff the DJ also played reggae, hip hip, and some R&B... all sounds that I get down to!A few times I've stayed until the lights came on, which is a little after 4am. Everyone is like zombies walking out- messy makeup, sweaty hair, dampened clothes, squinted eyes... and to remind us of how wonderful we look at 4am, after dancing and drinking for hours, there's a huge full-body mirror upon entering and exiting. I actually like this though. I can check myself out during the night, and put myself together before hopping on the 1 train back to TimBuckTwo!If you're looking for a good time with awesome music and no cover, whether it's for drinks, hookah, or some long lastin' dancin, I would definitely recommend checking  out Mimosa Cafe!",8,6,4
9,Yaime L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,6/26/2015,"Normally love this spot. But they are RACIST. Asked the DJ for a hip hop set, he told me the manager asked him not to play hip hop because ""they,"" got too hyper & pointed at a group of African American patrons. Went up to the manager & she went on to tell me no because ""they,"" get too hyper while again pointing at the same group of African American patrons, & security wouldn't be able to control, ""them."" Not cool. Not returning.",3,2,
10,Brittany A.,"Queens Village, Queens, NY",624,372,398,4.0,6/29/2013,The second stop on my first wild night in Washington heights. (Technically 3rd spot but we went into the second for only a moment). I must say the DJ was pretty good. I danced the whole time. A lot of old school rican fellas. All the good reggae came on with the lights. I was literally at the door to leave and had to stop in front of this huge mirror they have to shake it real quick. I would have been doing injustice to my whole Jamaican-ness had I not.Nothing but Latinos. It's all good though. They don't discriminate  and were totally cool with me being there. Actually some big fans of mine. More hookah which is pretty much a staple item in any heavily Latin spot. They kept the bachata business to a minimum but it was enough for me to buss out my salsa with a young Dominicano. I had a blast here. Of course all the guys are aggressive and not afraid to grab you for a dance. They were still cool when I told them to back off. Everyone was friendly and inviting and there was no drama in site. There were a few wanna be thugs but nothing took place. They kept their thugging to a minimum and enjoyed the party. I can always appreciate a spot with minimum drama. I had a great time. Would definitely come back if in the area.,3,3,
11,Kim F.,"Bronx, NY",1,20,0,2.0,8/13/2016,"Tried this place for the second time hoping for a better outcome...still the same horrible service, ladies made our group move from  the table saying it was only bottle service however the other people around didn't have bottles either not to mention it was empty...also the place was cash only and the ATM was down so customers had to leave for cash. Also, the DJ took no request...needless to say not returning to this spot!",,,
12,Eder N.,"New York, NY",186,3,0,1.0,8/15/2015,My cousin lost her phone at the bar and the owner refused to take a look at the cameras. I'll file a complaint to the cops.,,,
13,Rojé G.,"Astoria, NY",510,294,456,2.0,5/28/2011,I've never gotten a hookah or bought a drink from this place. I don't see the appeal of this place at all. It's small and gets really crowded. The crowd is very ghetto and the place was a sausage fest. Why would I want to be around a bunch of guys with oversized white and black tees. no bueno. Good:music is slightly better than other lounges in the areaBad:very small loungegets growdeda lot of dudespretty ghetto,3,5,1
14,Arielle C.,"New York, NY",66,67,6,3.0,4/16/2011,Been here a few times and had lots of fun.Bottle service is your best bet if you go with a couple of people.There wasn't any cover charge and the prices are great! We paid a little more than a hundred for a bottle of Patron which is unheard of in most lounges.On Monday nights they play Hip Hop and Reggaeton and Thursdays are Salsa nights featuring a live percussion band. Not sure about the other nights. Enjoy!,10,1,2
15,Nikki C.,"New York, NY",0,9,6,5.0,8/2/2014,"Love this spot. My second time coming. Definitely coming back. Chill atmosphere, good music.",,,
16,Kerry Ann S.,"Inwood, Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,2.0,9/25/2013,Always loud and and too out of control. Drinks are good and the musics hype but sometimes I just end up wanting to leave.,,,
17,Rita E.,"Brooklyn, NY",60,171,12,3.0,3/7/2010,"A hookah lounge in Inwood, servicing locals, mainly Dominicans? Wow, ok! No bigger than a one-bedroom apartment, Mimosa tries to be many things. First of all, the name, Mimosa. Did I see any mimosas served there? No, but there sure was a lot of liquor. Is this a brunch place? Doesn't seem to be so... ok? It's a hookah lounge for sure, though these are the smallest little hookahs ever; they're personal sized! There's a flat screen tv behind the bar tuned into ESPN (??) when I was there on a Saturday evening, as well as a DJ BLASTING salsa and merengue. So: a bar, hookah lounge, dance club, sports bar?? They also have small appetizers to serve purely as snacks, like wings, I think. Nothing too fancy, all that is under $10, I believe. Not sure what the prices on anything else was, as I didn't pay for any of it. Their mixed drinks are barely worthy of that epithet, this place serves you straight up liquor with mixers as color, I swear! Decor tries to be ""Mediterranean"" by hanging fringed cloths along the ceiling and such. It tries, but it's a little sloppy I think, it's almost more of an afterthought. Sure, Mimosa is fun, I certainly danced, as did others, but this place is so schizophrenic! What sort of place are you? Depends who you ask, I guess. On Saturday nights it can get crowded (of course), FYI!",1,6,
18,Ely M.,"Mahopac, NY",58,62,3,4.0,2/28/2010,"I have visited Mimosa's on two occasions now:Early in the morning on Friday I decided I was doing Happy Hour, and chose Mimosa as the place that would help me reach my goal.......Calling through out the day led me to believe they would not open that day...probably because of the snowstorm ( I dont know why the snow has been such a huge issue this year, as if NY doesnt get tons of snow every year...smh lightweights)...So my happy hour had to be re-routed to another business in the area. Friday @ 10pmFinally they opened.....The place was empty but it was really early by weekend standards.  I was with two friends and we each ordered a vodka cranberry, our check was only $10....I believe they gave us the Happy hour prices because of their late opening, already doing good in my book guys.  Shout out to Morena, a bartender, she is awesome!Saturday @ 2:00amHoly Geezus!  This place was packed!!!!  I think the door man seriously considered not letting me and my 2 friends in because they were really at capacity, but he did.... Gratzi!So after already having some drinks in the system we just wanted a chill time, so decided to do some hookah....They made space for us at the bar, and the light headed-ness began.  The DJ was very good this night, and although the place was full, it wasn't that annoying peoples shoulders in your face full....so we still had a good time.They have a food menu which I haven't tried, but I will in one of my future visits, as this place has not disappointed.",2,1,
19,Emmanuel C.,"New York, NY",13,6,0,2.0,3/21/2010,"I've been a guest @ this piece of Sh*t of a ""Cafe"" only once, and that was last Friday night. The ONLY good thing about Mimosa is that they don't charge for going in. Other than that, everything was lame! This ""cafe"" is literally my living room with a full bar in it. Now, I know exactly what it feels like to be a cigarette in a carton! I could not move, and most of the time, I was stuck where I was standing for a few minutes.The hookahs at Mimosa were OK, and the drinks are nicely priced. But Mimosa gets too packed and the congestion makes it hard for anyone to have a great experience here!",,1,
20,Shelly I.,"Silverdale, WA",2,39,1,3.0,8/2/2011,this place is literally 10 minutes away from home.  Why would i take the subway into the city when i can drive to 207th street?  They have hookah's and good drinks (as long as you don't order anything too complicated)  I love the music.. people actually dance here,1,,1
21,Vanessa M.,"New York, NY",0,100,0,1.0,7/4/2012,If you want to feel like a diseased sardine in a can this place is a must come!!!! This place is horrific.,,3,
22,Diana B.,"Yonkers, NY",110,195,554,3.0,8/8/2009,"Nice decor.  The hookahs all over looked weird but adds something different to the place.  Middle Eastern decor and it was very comfortable.  I only stayed for one $8 drink and did not do the hookah of which is $25 but maybe next time.  It's a good place to watch a game, sit, chat and hookah. I DON'T HOOKAH but maybe I might try it here in the future.",1,,
