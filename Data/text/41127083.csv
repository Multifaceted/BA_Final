0,Vivek D.,"Queens, NY",133,193,75,4.0,10/13/2017,"I've come a few times recently.My go-to item is usually the eggplant parm hero.  I've also ordered salads at the salad bar, which is nice.  The eggplant parm is pretty dope in my opinion.The salad bar was pretty good too.  I probably won't come to this salad bar more often because I can go to one closer to my office that has lunchtime salad bar deals for toppings.  This salad bar charges for each topping.Overall, the place is a decent place to come for breakfast or lunch.  The high ceilings definitely make it nice and airy for customers too.  I'd recommend for people who work nearby.",,,

3,Elizabeth T.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,23,5,2.0,4/12/2016,"I'm very disappointed, for the second time, in this place. I've only been here to get breakfast about four times, and in two out of those occasions they have gotten my egg sandwich order wrong. They rush you to take your order, ignore you while you are telling them what you want and then they get it wrong. The times they got it right was only because I was very specific, telling them what to do and what not to do, and no one wants to be this type of customer. By the way, who puts only one egg in an egg sandwich? They do, so be painfully specific and check your order before you leave and they charge you normal. I give them two stars because of how close they are to the office.",1,,1
4,Christopher B.,"East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY",3,22,0,5.0,2/17/2017,"If you need an affordable breakfast sandwich or platter fast near GC, don't be fooled by the long line. It's incredible how speedy, nice, and wonderful their employees are. Every time I come, the gentleman doing Expo remembers what I want. I walked in today, as he saw me, he called to the front to see if they had a croissant. They didn't but it doesn't matter because I'm still happy about everything. Lunch is good too, but I tend to go more for breakfast.",,,
5,Jack L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,60,2,3.0,2/5/2017,Pizza is pretty good. I've tried both the cheese and the mushroom. It's a little greasy but that's a NY slice! Slices are big enough that you'll be satisfied by only two.The chicken parm sandwich is very delicious. There is plenty of fresh tomato sauce with nice chunks of tomato. The cheese is appropriate in quantity. Hey always toast it just right!Market cafe is reasonably priced considering the proximity to Grand Central.,,,
6,Justina N.,"Manhattan, NY",6,112,39,1.0,12/29/2015,"Food was as might be expected from a place like this inside a mall-type food court. Cheese and pepperoni slices of pizza were average with much better other dining options in a city full of gourmet markets like this one.My dining experience was worsened by the fact that we chose to sit out in the public dining area right in front of the restaurant so that my 3-year old son could run around in an open space; only to have the garbage man tell the security guard to kick us out, which he gruffly did under the pretense that it was dangerous. In summary: this is a mediocre pizza place with nowhere to sit and rude people regulating the public space in front of it.  Rather than trying to improve upon their diners experience, they'd rather try to filter negative reviews like mine by claiming they're not responsible for the public area where almost everybody who gets pizza there eats so we'll see if this remains posted...",,,
7,Lizzy K.,"New York, NY",274,234,168,4.0,3/13/2014,"I started coming here mostly because it is across from where I work, but there are so many choices for breakfast and lunch in the area, so why would I keep coming back here? I find myself to always be satisfied with the way food is prepared here. Whether it is a bagel sandwich with a slice of lox, a slice of whole wheat Margarita-style pizza or a hot panini, this place never disappoints! The service is fast, friendly and the prices are very reasonable. There's also a place to be outdoors to sit as well.",,,
8,K B.,"New York, NY",0,33,5,4.0,4/10/2017,"Expensive but convenient and they have a good selection of healthy, tasty, quick food. I mostly go for the salad bar at lunch.

But I saw the sign for brick oven pizza. Boy...I did not expect good pizza from here, but boy was I wrong. We got the Neapolitan and prosciutto pie. Always need one regular and one specialty pizza. Pizza had a nice crust from the brick oven, but I'd prefer it to be a little more crispier. And the sauce was nice, but I felt like something was missing. Maybe a little extra heat somewhere in the pizza will make this place perfect. If you haven't tried pizza here, you should.",,,
11,Monica T.,"New York, NY",226,1878,25,3.0,6/13/2014,"Got a chicken panini here with pesto on it.  Fries are greasy and pricing could be better but I did have leftovers afterward.  You could do worse for right near Grand Central.  It's very much a ""serve yourself"" style venue, rushed at lunch time so not the place you want to go if you're seeking a relaxing, leisurely meal.",1,,

13,Wendy G.,"Minato, Japan",240,722,1237,4.0,10/4/2011,"Cheapest place that I know in midtown, but this place really delivers the value.

15,Zhi Man H.,"Brooklyn, NY",30,51,45,4.0,10/27/2013,"This is your typical Midtown cafe with salad, hot food, pizza, and sandwiches. I've only tried the hot food section but this place is the best value in the neighborhood for lunch. The small platter is about $8 and you get to pick your choice of meat and a side. The large platter is about $10 and comes with two sides. Trust me when I tell you that the small platter is plenty. Portion sizes are very generous and they just keep piling it on. The large platter is enough for two lunches. One weird thing is that they will also microwave your food to make it really hot. They have a small seating area so that's a plus. Overall, you can't go wrong with this place when you're hungry.",1,,
16,Charles S.,"Flushing, NY",0,7,1,2.0,1/22/2014,"Do yourself a favor and don't order breakfast here. An order of ""2 eggs, bacon well done and cheese on a roll"" turned into 1 egg (unless they were quail eggs, I'm not sure), cold bacon and a slice of non melted cheese. It was fast though. I was in and out in under 5 minutes. Next time maybe take an extra 30 seconds to melt the cheese and heat the bacon, please. But the roll was good!Oh and $3 for a juice is just ridiculous.",,1,

19,J M.,"Brooklyn, NY",129,169,167,3.0,9/5/2012,"I had lunch here for the first time today: 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 soup.  It's a spacious locale with many menu items for breakfast and lunch.  It has a decent amount of tables, and on this rainy NYC day, I was happy to find a spot to dine in since sitting outdoors and enjoying the weather wasn't an option.  The menu consists of the usual suspects: salads, soups, wraps, sandwiches, pizza & more.  Nothing out of the ordinary that you can't find anywhere else or that you'll make a special trip here for.  But, it's decent fare at reasonable prices. I did try the Hungarian mushroom soup, which was actually good (and different from my go-to, safety net, fail-proof soup option: chicken noodle). It's another reliable place to grab breakfast or lunch.",3,2,3
20,Erica H.,"Tarrytown, NY",0,1,0,1.0,7/20/2016,Pizza was terrible.  Staff rude and curt.  Don't waste your time or money here. Tried it on a whim but will never go back.  Praying all day I don't get sick from eating here.,,,
21,Robert C.,"New York, NY",23,13,0,1.0,4/18/2016,Horrible service.... literally work next door and half the  time they mess up the order. Today was the last straw.. I ordered a spinich wrap with turkey and egg whites. Usually when i go here this is what i order or similar. 5 minutes go by i see the kitchen deliver a foil wrapped wrap to be bagged but the guy puts it in the microwave. I didnt pay much attention to it i thought it wasnt mine. The guy takes it out of the microwave and writes the price on it and gives it to me. I was thinking wtf but whatever. Went upstairs and opened tbe wrap... it was a spinich wrap but with bacon cheese and egg... i was like seriously? Did this guy just give me a old wrap that someone didnt want? Ridiculous... i called downstairs and they told me this is what i ordered and nothing they can do about it since i left the premesis. I was like you joking right? I go there atleast 2 times a week and this is the crap service i get?  They just lost a customer because they either took the order incorrectly... OR they wanted to rip me off and give me a wrap someone ordered and didnt want.... ridiculous..,,,
22,Kurt Q.,"ASTORIA, NY",40,186,5,3.0,11/8/2012,"The only reason I might go back is because I'm in this area for work 42 hours-a-week, and you get tired of the same few options (yes, only a New Yorker would be upset with the roughly 86 options within .5 mile).Considering the pricey district of East Midtown, this place is about average. The 1/2 soup, 1/12 salad is a good deal -- with drink, it'll hurt you about $8.50. The problem is the food. The chicken gumbo didn't have any chicken in it. I know that sounds like a joke, but it's not. The one penny-thin slice of chicken I found was something you wouldn't even take a bite off of if it was hanging off a bone. You'd be like, ""eh, that's too small to eat."" The cajun sandwich was a bit dry. I think the pickle moved. Service is gross here. The cashier was so rude: soulless, didn't speak to me, pointed irritatedly when I asked where the spoons were. Whatever, I hope she suffers a long, miserable awful life.Nice atmosphere!",,2,

24,Max S.,"New York, NY",245,328,100,2.0,4/25/2012,"Everyone knows the crazy profits that are made on salads by delis in NYC. The mark up that is made on each ingredient is insane.  Nevertheless, we get them anyway.The markup here, however, is just shameless.  The ratio of ingredients to final price is ridiculous.  3 veg + 1 chicken ended up running me $7 for a small salad.  Wasn't even that good.I see you have ""Brick Over Pizza"" on your door.  Okay.  Let's try a pizza that is impossible to screw up - the margherita.  3 ingredients there - tomato sauce, basil, cheese.  They managed to screw it up.  Not only was the sauce stale, but on a 16 inch pizza that they pre-bake in the morning to sell by the slice, the sauce only covers about 13.5 inches.  Which means that when you pay $2.75 for the slice, when you are about half done with the pizza, the rest will just be stale bread.  The only way this place is still open is they probably have the church next door praying for them.",1,2,

It was a normal Weds morning (was feeling fine and healthy) when I strolled in around 7:30AM to get a BLT sandwich. That was my first and only meal of the day and about an hour later my body started getting chills. I left work early that day; vomited and had constant diarrhea that day and the next. I spoke to the owner of Market Cafe the next morning and told him that I got food poisoning. He was a real smooth talker on the phone and told me ""that no one has ever complained or got sick in the past"". He also took down my phone number and said he would do his ""due diligence"" and give me a call back. Never got a call back from him.

I pass hundreds of spots where I can easily pick up breakfast, but my loyalty is here! Cleanliness!!!

There has not been a time where my order has been screwed up or took to long to prepare. I'm not shy, I asked the owner/ manager if he could make me a coffee I usually order from Starbucks. Five shot espresso w/ water in a large cup. His response ""Do you want brown sugar w/ that?"" Talk about killing two birds w/ one stone. My suggestion, order anything you like, surely it will be tasty, and don't beshy to ask for something not on the menu. You're in good hands! I always am here!Their salad bar is quite delicious. Grilled chicken Caesar is my usual. Pizza is A+. Never tried any sandwiches.... The display is too close to the steam table w/ all that tasty hot food.
