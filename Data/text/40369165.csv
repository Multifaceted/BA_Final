0,Daniel B.,"Toledo, OH",0,20,0.0,5.0,10/7/2018,Dope local bar with chill outdoor space. Come here if you're in the area. A lot of regulars and friendly bartender. Has pool table and TVs.,,,
1,Shirley D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",490,304,623,5.0,2/5/2018,"Love Reif's Tavern. I love the people, I love the chill atmosphere, I love their prices, and I love their pool table. This is a gem in the UES. In the summer they have an open patio in the back which is awesome. I love coming here and playing  pool - it's literally like our own space in the back. The staff is super friendly and welcoming.",2,1,1
2,Dane K.,"New York, NY",7,126,55,3.0,8/5/2018,"Unapologetically divey.  Faux wood paneling, sticky floors, cheap stiff drinks.  There is even a nice back patio that you can enjoy before it gets too late for the neighbors.  Friendly bartender.  Decent restroom.  Pool table that occasionally will accept your quarters.  Good place to swing by on the way home from a bender... for that ever necessary night cap.  Mixed crowd where you will see everything and nothing at the same time.  I'm sold.",,,
3,Yoni D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",88,26,8,5.0,2/11/2018,"Im a divebar kinda guy and Reifs is my favorite divebar in the upper east side. Reifs isnt the type of bar trying to be a diver bar, it just is. You could walk past it a million times and not notice it, but once you been here you will not forget this spot.Walk through the door into a bar that is more reminiscent of a smaller neighborhood spot. No fancy frills, just the bar(e) necessities.  You can come here to watch a game, meet the locals, talk with the bartenders,  or listen to some tunes on the digital jukebox.  In the back they have a pool table, table shuffleboard, and  a huge patio area which is usually free. Come by and meet the locals!",,,
4,Dvo W.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",1,15,32,5.0,3/15/2017,Just the best to chill after a long day. A low key bar with great prices and awesome staff. Pool table in the back take quarters so just ask the bartender to break a few bucks get a Bucket of your favorite beers and chill in the back with a few friends. I love know I can come anytime and know I won't have to wait to get a drink. And there cool with bring food from outside. There is no kitchen so stop at the deli or at the pizzeria and get a snack,,,
5,Natasha G.,"Sunnyside, NY",541,225,278,4.0,7/4/2015,"This place is seriously a dive, but I'm a big fan solely because of the GRILLIN and CHILLIN area you can rent out in the back. Taking it over, filling it with your friends, trucking in your own meat and grill supplies: you can make Reif's your own. The grill itself is pretty big, and there are a bunch of chairs and umbrella covered tables around the patio area, which is located behind a door all the way at the back of the bar. The idea is that you buy a couple buckets of beer from the bar to drink while you're grilling, though it's pretty hard to get the bartender to give you anything more complicated than a liquor+soda type of drink. He will literally laugh in your face if you ask for a bloody mary.Reif's isn't somewhere I'd come to hang out at the bar, but it's great in the summer if you have a big group of people who want to hang out, and if you don't have access to a grill of your own.",3,1,
6,Christopher C.,"Denver, CO",425,1544,295,4.0,4/10/2017,"great local bar, I usually came here when I want one more PBR, great people and great stories always.",1,,
7,Colin B.,"Towson, MD",80,2,0,5.0,7/3/2017,This is a great bar. The bartender and the people here are very friendly. Drinks here aren't expensive at all.,,,
8,Katherine B.,"West New York, NJ",175,146,181,3.0,8/24/2016,"Ahhhh. My old stomping ground. This place wasn't my favorite during the time I lived here but after moving out of the area and returning spontaneously one night, I forgot how much I love the small, dingy location. Nice little outside area, although there's nothing to look at. Nice bartenders and you can tell the locals are the ones that run the show. Besides this, there's not much to say about this place besides the fact that its particularly special to me and that's that.",,,
9,Matt E.,"Brooklyn, NY",780,2201,1846,3.0,8/1/2013,"3.5 stars...If it wasn't for their dirty lines making all the tap beers taste gross, not fresh, and not even that cold, I would have given them a higher rating. Prices for most beers on tap are $6, a little much for such a divey place but well within reason for the city. Bud Light drafts are $4 and $3 during Yankee games. After three attempts at draft beers I switched to bottles of which the selection is fairly slim but at least it's fresh and cold. There's no food but I'm sure they don't mind if you bring some in. The positive sides of Reif's is that it's a real neighborhood pub, low key, and old school. What other pub have you ever seen put together a fishing trip and open it up to anyone in the neighborhood who wants to go? The music playing when I was there was amazing and the best two features is their pool table ($1.50), and a surprisingly clean and large back yard patio (which closes at 10pm). This might be the most underrated outdoor patio in the city and hopefully it stays that way.",2,,
10,Brad K.,"Brooklyn, NY",69,96,2,5.0,5/12/2016,"Great neighborhood dive to grab a drink with no frills.  Laid back but very attentive bartenders, a nice juke box with great bose speakers and a nice backyard.",1,,
11,Joe T.,"Manhattan, NY",5,88,4,1.0,6/21/2014,"Nothing charming about Reif's.  The only redeeming feature is that drinks are cheap and they pour them in front of you.I love old bars.  I try to get to as many as I can before they disappear.  I love ones with lots of old wood and old pictures of ye olde Ireland and old ballplayers lining the walls.  An old bartender reading an old newspaper or polishing the wood when you walk in.   Some regulars quietly nursing their wounds at the bar.  Maybe a couple or two  cozied up at a one of the few tables.  A quiet hum about the place and some Sinatra (or similar) piped in from somewhere.This place ain't that brother.  If you want to feel like you stumbled into a frat house you will be happy here.  It's got that grimy, cheap paneling, we haven't cleaned the place since the Nixon-Administration, if you don't like who we root for we'll pound your head, ""I didn't make it past 8th grade, did you?"", we have Rolling Rock on tap, my mother is also my sister, basementy --  feel to it.  If that's where you are at, head over to Reif's Tavern posthaste. That means ""very quickly"" to you.",,4,
12,Phil H.,"New York, NY",4999,3286,12684,3.0,7/5/2011,"Nice little divey kind of bar a few blocks from where I live. Place has been around since the 1940's and still has that look and feel. Mostly locals seem to patronize this little watering hole. Pool table, big buck hunter game, darts, cheap drinks, decent jukebox, and an outdoor patio area with a grill that you can use to bbq your own meats (need a reservation with bartender).They also have some annual events like a Crawfish boil and fishing trip. You can also bring in some pizza from Delizia next door. A small selection of beers on tap and enough flat screens to catch the game on an afternoon. Definitely a throwback to the past kind of pub.",5,1,1
13,Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,2242,478,3.0,8/3/2016,"a dive bar that has the decor of some frat house basement from many years ago and maybe that's why the locals and regulars feel right at home . this bar has been around since  the 1940s and the old timers sitting by the corner table might be from that time period . the drinks are not expensive and with a few tvs around to watch the game or the pool table to play a few of your own i would say that this place is ok in my book. the juke box needs some updating with song selections but the music playing in the background was good enough and the old photos on the walls gives the place a nice nostalgic look. the location is 92nd st and second ave , upper east side and this joint has an unique gimmick which is that the back area has an outdoor patio set up with a grill which you can rent  and have your own private barbecue .  for me personally i was tagging along with a buddy who enjoys going to dive bars and it work out fine cause while he is at the bar drinking and telling lies to the broad next to him i am playing pool and watching the game on the giant screen tv. a nice place to hang out if you like old dive bars .",4,1,1
14,Melss R.,"New York, NY",82,56,3,4.0,9/26/2013,"Reif's is a chill neighborhood bar. They have a big pool table area and a great outdoor picnic area. This bar does not have an NYC vibe. It's a dive bar where everyone talks to each other. I like going for the cheap drinks and getting take out delivered to the bar. I can see how other reviewers could think this place was creepy. I don't think so, I'd call it friendly locals and the opposite of a douchey bar.",,,
15,Maggie F.,"New York, NY",7,8,0,3.0,7/5/2012,"I was at Reif's for the July 4th BBQ. There are two grills in the backyard. The grill used to be first come first serve. But, now you have to call to reserve your spot. Come to Reif's you'll be drinking with senior citizens and I think this is one of the bars in New York City that is only locals to hangout.To me there's one thing special about this place, that is the history of this old bar. I might l visit again if I am in the neighborhood.",2,,
16,Leslie G.,"Brooklyn, NY",127,278,28,2.0,5/11/2014,"Let me preface this review by saying that I don't live on the UES and am not a regular at this bar, which I'm sure has something to do with my rating. If I lived near here and frequented it often, I would probably have a different view. However, as someone who just happened to stop in one night with some friends, I did not have a pleasant experience. Yes, I realize it's a dive bar, but this kind of went above and beyond (or should I say below) that definition. The general vibe was reminiscent of someone's trashed basement after a house party. There were empty cups all over the place, and the lighting was weirdly bright and harsh. The floor was so sticky that my shoes were getting stuck to it. Some drunk dude stole our pitcher and started drinking directly out of it. Someone else called me a ""gringa"" on my way to the bathroom (accurate, but still not really necessary). The bathroom was completely trashed--even more so than most bar bathrooms...Needless to say, I don't think I'll be making a return trip. I'll leave it to the regulars to enjoy.",1,3,1
17,Perry T.,"Manhattan, NY",101,439,0,4.0,7/5/2012,"I love Reif's! I live right next door, and this place has a very neighborhoody feel. Everyone is very nice and welcoming, drinks are cheap, and there's a patio outdoors where you can grill!",1,,
18,Katie M.,"Manhattan, NY",30,203,9,4.0,7/15/2012,"There is something so inherently awesome about this place.  Beer is cheap ($5 whattttt??!?!), the backyard is open and airy, and the people/staff are super chill.  It's dive-y in all of the right ways.I used to live a few doors down from Dorrian's.  Luckily, that era has ended, and I am more than happy to deem Reif's my local bar of choice.",1,,
19,Ranita C.,"Yorkville, Manhattan, NY",15,5,0,1.0,6/7/2013,DO NOT GO HERE ! It's a creepy bar. A sausage fest of old men and the owners daughter is equally as weird ! If someone harasses you there ...Do not expect support from her ! Creeeeeeeepy. Bars of the Rails is around the corner and is much more fun ! Better crowd and the manager hugged me and bought me a drink after my bad experience at reifs ! This is the 3rd time I gave them a chance . Doesn't even deserve 1 star,2,4,2
20,Katy A.,"Chicago, IL",19,3,0,5.0,8/31/2014,"Our music festival was rained out and we stumbled upon this gem! Great crowd, excellent staff, friendly and welcoming atmosphere... And delicious potluck! Couldn't have asked for a better port in a storm. Wish I had a neighborhood bar like this back home!",,,
21,Eric A.,"Hoboken, NJ",36,4,0,5.0,9/18/2014,"Great local dive bar with a unique personality - a huge outdoor space in the back!  Great for draft beers, pool or darts and to watch a game.  Always have a blast when I go there.",,,
22,H L.,"Bronx, NY",2,272,58,4.0,5/5/2013,Cool place- great patio out back where you can BYOF and rent a grill for around $50. They played great music he whole time we were there. Perfect place for a relaxed get together,1,1,
23,Clive A.,"New York, NY",7,15,0,5.0,11/22/2010,"I live downtown, and HATE most of the bars on the Upper East Side. Reif's is pretty much the only reason you could get me to go up there. I think that says how good this bar is. Relaxed atmosphere, cool bartenders, good jukebox, reasonable drink prices, and a nice deck with communal grill for the warmer months. If I lived in the neighborhood I'd be a regular there without a doubt.  I've always had a good time at this bar. Also, if you haven't even been inside an establishment, why are you reviewing/rating it on Yelp? Seems pretty stupid to me.",2,1,1
24,Mike C.,"Wyandanch, NY",46,135,2,3.0,12/21/2011,"What a weird place! Lots of locals, all of them a little crazy. The bartender (I think his name was Ilya) was the only normal one in there. There was a decent beer selection, somewhat surprising because it was a dive bar all the way.They have one of the internet jukeboxes that never seems to have the song you're looking for, so you have to pay extra to get it -- and thank God they did, because the music they were playing was awful!I'm mainly giving them a good review because the people watching was fun and the bartender was cool. If not for that, we would've been gone after one round.",,,
25,Jay G.,"New York, NY",18,321,359,4.0,9/20/2009,"A small 'hole in the wall' about 100ft east of second ave that doesn't pretend to be anything special. If you are a group of loud chatty picture taking chicks (fattys), this isn't your spot. Hipsters, even highly ranked hipsters, those that have a quick Bukowski quote, those that have an Obama tattoo or two, those that have a wallet full of cash from mom/dad or grandma and of course those that have visions of Vice Magazine swimming in their minds, this is not their type of place either.After a few afternoons here I begin to get a Twin Peaks vibe. Old drunks, young drunks, homeless (looking) drunks and everything in between, astronauts, cowboys, ballerinas, rodeo clowns, cousin Itt, disgruntled housewives, drunken slamhounds, homecoming queens of long ago and usual detritus that shows itself where ever booze is served seem to be the uncommon participants at Reifs. Oh, I can't forget to mention the old guy that drinks his beer with his teeth sitting on the bar.Reifs has a large backyard area which is really nice when the weather is cooperating. Also one can cook up some grub on their grill. Reserve the grill with the bartender. Weekends of course are usually busy. Weekdays I've had the whole backyard to myself, just sittin', drinking and listening to the traffic off 2 ave..",,2,
26,Tom C.,"Staten Island, NY",0,15,0,4.0,3/9/2015,"Stumbled upon this place tucked down the street on 92nd.  Old school and very comfortable.  If you're chubby you may have a problem fitting into perhaps the tiniest men's room in the city.  Pool table and a back yard.  Nice place, I'll stop in whenever I'm in the area and thirsty.",1,,
27,Ninja h.,"New York, NY",0,234,264,4.0,6/27/2013,Great neighbor hood bar. Friendly bartender with friendly regulars.,,1,
28,Dave S.,"New York, NY",13,6,0,4.0,2/27/2013,"A great, utterly unheralded dive behind a non-descript doorfront on 92nd tucked just inside the horror that is the Second Ave Subway construction. When you want a legit, non-douche dive this is the spot. 4 stars + 1 star for $10 buckets of six Budweiser nips. Who'da thunk it?",1,,
29,R L.,"New York, NY",154,459,19,4.0,7/11/2013,Feels like a dive bar but you go to the back and there is a nice patio area.  I like it...fees like a great place to go and feel at home!,,,
30,Andrew K.,"Manhattan, NY",32,69,54,4.0,11/30/2012,Such an odd bar. Without the backyard this place is probably a 3-star kind if joint but that patio and grill is awesome. Beers are fairly priced for NYC and the vibe inside is warm in it's own unique way (but kind of vanilla). All around a decent place to grab a drink - especially in the summer.,1,,
31,Alex R.,"Aurora, CO",40,30,20,5.0,12/22/2012,"Awesome Bar! My girlfriend and I went here after dinner for our anniversary, we ended up staying there till 4 in the morning.

32,Jill B.,"San Francisco, CA",0,3,0,5.0,4/23/2015,"The blond bartender is so hot.  And what a personality.  She's sprite and youthful!  Seriously, this place is off the hook awesome.  Get to it!",,,
33,Stephen W.,"Richmond, VA",15,28,0,4.0,2/18/2010,"I may be biased because I've been lucky enough to live right next door to Reif's for the past year, but without a doubt, I love me some Reif's.  More often than not, I'll stumble into the bar for one last beer (ok of course it never ends up being just one) before the night is done.  The bartenders are great, and there is a constant stream of locals from the neighborhood that you will likely run into most nights here.  It has photohunt and a solid classic-rock filled jukebox that will easily entertain you and your dollar bills for hours.  If you live in the neighborhood, make it a point to come by.  Grab a slice next door from Delizia's Pizza (you won't be disappointed), take it over to the bar next door, and pull up a stool and enjoy a tasty beverage.",3,1,
34,Alanna V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,8/15/2012,"Heard they had outdoor grills. My friends thought it would be a great idea to have some beers while enjoying some BBQ. It turned out that some of the biggest, nastiest cockroaches in NYC decided to join us as well. There was an entire extended family of roaches that LITERALLY crawled ON us.NEVER AGAIN.",1,,

36,Nicole W.,"Los Angeles, CA",129,64,4,4.0,8/12/2008,"Update: I had to up my rating because I had a private party here and the bar tender was awesome. It was easy to book the space and comfortably fit 50 people.When you walk in, you think you might have been magically transported into a townie bar in arkansas, but then you step to the back and find yourself on a recently re-done wonderful patio with cheap beer and life suddenly looks better. Oh and they have big buck hunter in case your friends are too boring to hang out with.",2,,1
37,Cadillac W.,"Venice, CA",13,58,3,5.0,7/14/2007,Ah Reif's...a dying breed and my first stop every time I go to New York.  Perfect place to spend the afternoon watching a game or meet up with friends.  You'll go to some loud trendy place that night and wish you were at back at Reif's playing Golden Tee and jamming out to the oldies.,1,1,1
38,Chris M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,1,1.0,10/3/2011,"Dive bar, which I don' mind at all, but the bat tender was inattentive and the beer was dreadfully warm. There was also a bunch of bottled beer sitting stacked up on top of the ice, just sweatin and getting warm.",,,

43,Taryn S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,11/7/2010,"I don't know whay kind of jerk grades a bar he's never been in but I have been a patron forever. It happens yo be a little slice of neighborhood history. The prices are great, the people are diverse and there is absolutely no attitude involved. Just a good ole' fashioned bar. Personally, I have never seen homeless people or hicks anywhere inside but I have been lucky enough to hang with some pretty cool locals who make you feel right at home. The backyard is great for hanging out and grilling and the 60 inch flatscreen in the pool room is fantastic for watching games.",2,,
44,Eric H.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,3,0,4.0,5/14/2009,This is a great neighborhood bar. Always an eclectic crew but never boring. With some loud classic dive bar music you surely wouldn't bring a date. (At least not early in the evening) Cheap beers and fun beer garden area.,1,,1
