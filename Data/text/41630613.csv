0,Tomas R.,"Toms River, NJ",30,9,12,4.0,11/14/2018,"I love this little cafe/restaurant. You come in and pick what you want. They have sandwiches, soups, salads, wraps, and drinks. They also have small snacks like cookies and chips. If you're vegan or vegetarian do not despair! They have several options available. I got the beet hummus wrap which was AMAZING. I had it with some pink grapefruit juice.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the seating. It was insane when my friends and I went in. Super, super busy at all times so brace yourselves when you walk in!",,,
1,Glorianne W.,"North Brunswick, NJ",0,2,0,5.0,10/5/2018,"This location rocks! We utilised them for catering for a global conference and their sincerity and customer service was amazing. Clear consistent communication and follow up to make sure the order is clear, to make sure we got what we need, to see if there is anything else.  Our conference ran long and we needed more coffee. They immediately jumped in providing more and following up. Thanks to the store manager ""J"" and his team for stellar service!!!Oh and the food is top notch! Flaky delicious croissants and the yogurt parfaits were so appreciated as an option and tasty!",,,

Updated review","Came by for a breakfast pastry the other day and it was tasty! The ham, cheese, and tomato croissant was light and fresh.Service was prompt and there were plenty of seats available too!",14,6,9
3,Stephanie I.,"Oviedo, FL",140,309,63,5.0,11/22/2017,"This Pret is right next door to my usual hotel and across the street from my office when I'm in NYC for work. I am always impressed by the food offerings. Fresh, clean, well-prepared breakfast is always just next door. The coffee is also always fresh and not burned, which is a definite win in Midtown. It's also a fabulous place to have a quick breakfast or coffee meeting with colleagues while I'm in town. They deliver breakfast to my room if desired.",2,2,2
4,Jeanette G.,"Winter Park, FL",17,96,388,5.0,12/4/2017,Outstanding no matter the location! If you value quality ingredients at a mind boggling low price... you'll be happy you came into Prets!,1,1,1
5,Savannah R.,"Mount Hope, KS",501,8,0,5.0,10/3/2018,"Was super exhausted and down, went into this Pret and Shawn (not sure on spelling, but she's a small blond lady) just made my day. She was so sweet and there was a promo for a free coffee which I got! She was so happy and bubbly I would literally come back to this Pret just for her.",,,
6,Stewie V.,"New York, NY",162,135,502,4.0,5/6/2017,"Had a good experience at this Pret A Manger. I wasn't expecting much, but the cashier was very courteous. When I asked for ketchup she brought about 6 packets of it and also brought me a complimentary croissant. Forgot exactly what was the reason she offered me the croissant, but I'm a BOB (baller on a budget) so I obliged and ate the heck out of it. It is a little more expensive than Au Bon Pain, but Pret's food options seem to be of good quality. Never been disappointed by their sandwiches. Good service would definitely return.",,,
7,Desiree P.,"Manhattan, NY",197,4,0,5.0,4/25/2018,"If you need a place to do work on your laptop and you don't mind music playing in the background, then this is the place for you. Place is very clean, staff is friendly, sandwiches are overpriced but tasty.",,,
8,Sara V.,"Seattle, WA",375,175,1297,3.0,12/29/2016,"Coffee is average. When you're down to your last sips of a mocha, there's a bit of cakes on hard sludge at the bottom of the cup. I stirred my coffee but the sludge was too hard I guess. I haven't had any of the food here so I can't rate that. This location is generally packed since it's prime real estate. The workers are nice and the wait time is generally short. Good luck getting a seat here! People like to sprawl out and take up as many chairs as possible with accessories for their computer or bike. Bleh.",2,1,1
9,Juan M.,"Chandler, AZ",1706,1634,25460,4.0,12/21/2016,"Fast, healthier than the competition, and affordable. The organic yogurt and sandwiches are fresh and are tasty. The coffee is fresh and is also very good.",1,1,1
10,Nitza R.,"Miami, FL",0,7,9,4.0,3/10/2018,"Had a cappuccino and almond croissant, both were delicious. Cashiers were all too sweet.",,,
11,Walter R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,0,3.0,9/21/2017,I've been coming to this place for around a year. There often problems with their wifi and I cant believe that after one year they don't fix their internet issues.,,,
12,Sara S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",107,12,5,5.0,7/22/2017,The food is always really fresh and delicious. I've been frequenting this location for a while now and don't expect much as far as customer service goes... but today a nice staff member named Miguel went above and beyond by asking me how my day was going and even giving me his name if I needed anything while I ate my salad. Then (here's the wow factor...) he actually came out behind the register to check to make sure i was enjoying my meal. That was so sweet. He's a standout employee for sure... especially coming from a jaded New Yorker :),,,
13,NotTelling P.,"Freehold Township, NJ",19,273,0,2.0,4/18/2017,"4 stars??? The place is OK if you are in a hurry, but it's nothing special.Had a sandwich with egg, sausage and cheese. The taste was OK, but there were hard pieces on the otherwise soft roll.",,,1
14,Andrea G.,"Fresh Meadows, Queens, NY",339,129,652,5.0,4/29/2016,OMG!! I've been here a couple times (forgot to check in) and keep getting the same thing. Egg salad on multigrain bread with arugula. It is the best. I love love love it!!! The service is super fast too so if you see a crowd don't worry the lines move fast.,6,4,3
15,Srini V.,"Manhattan, NY",469,458,89,3.0,2/16/2015,"I shall only review one Pret ever.  While there are differences across the chain, given that Pret is primarily a take-out place with a fairly standard menu, the experience is fairly similar across the large and growing family of Pret outlets in the city.The Pret salads are healthy but one has to be short of restaurant options or time to get one.  The falafel mezze salad is a good option.    So also their falafel wrap.  The Moroccan lentil soup is always available, but as they have raised the contribution of carrots, turnips and onions in what appears to be their modified recipe, I tend to avoid this soup.  The tomato and feta soup is a great addition to the menu, but is not available on all days or in every location.Pret's assortment has expanded over the years to include fresh fruit, yogurt pots, pastry and juices.  Their registers are run efficiently, often with coordination and intervention from their store managers.  Pret will continue to keep their market share of lunch dollars.  But they will need to keep up with the competition in coming up with new options to keep the menu interesting and the customers coming back.",9,7,8
16,H W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,63,2,1.0,3/21/2017,"I love the Pret a Mangers around town... staff is always friendly, tho food is a bit pricey (when their coffee is as expensive as starbucks then I question them).  But they've always had great strong wifi and plenty of outlets (not like some Starbucks)...so been a regular here on 45th and 6th.  HOWEVER, this particular store just changed their wifi protocols so you can only use it for 30 minutes, as opposed to unlimited.  It was annoying and upsetting... so no more.  Went to the other Pret A Manger and they don't do that, but it is only a matter of time...  Yeah, you suck and really don't deserve the 1 star (is their a negative star?)",,,
17,Tammi W.,"Salem, OR",0,47,0,5.0,8/7/2016,Ate here allot duRing our hotel stay in New York. It's similar to restaurant food@half the price.DELICIOUS Greek honey yogurt with coffee for breakfast. Wraps for lunch. Everything was fresh and flavorful.I also Love that they only keep food for one day and donate the leftovers to the hungry! Very generous~,,,
18,Me Y.,"Seattle, WA",43,88,36,4.0,11/14/2017,Breakfast sandwich on brioche was everything better than than mcdonalds. Stuffed croissant just as great.,,,
19,mark f.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,1,1.0,4/27/2017,"The product is by and large fine, but the wrap packaging is downright fraudulent, and so I will no longer patronize Pret (any).  Wraps are cut in half and packaged in such a way that it appears to be rather longer (thus bigger) than it is, as you discover when you open it and find a gap previously hidden.  The attached photos tell the story, pre and post opening.",,,
20,Ibrahim S.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",3,3,10,3.0,3/12/2015,Good place.I tried a salted caramel latte but not that good.Oh yelp .. Do i have to talk too much to accept the review?,,,
21,Tony H.,"New York, NY",7,62,17,5.0,1/1/2017,"Usually there 2 to 3 times a week. In and out in under 5 minutes. Five stars if you're looking for something that's super quick and consistent. My usuals are fennel meatball soup, pumpkin bisque, southwestern chicken BBQ hot baguette, turkey ham and cheddar hot baguette, and the chicken and avocado salad when I'm feeling fat.",,,
22,Stephanie S.,"Nassau, NY",287,213,27,5.0,6/5/2016,"Can Pret A Manager please come to Long Island?! The people at this location are so friendly, nice and welcoming. I walked in lost and was guided by one of their wonderful staff members (a young woman with brown hair). I was a bit overwhelmed when I walked in because I didn't know where to get what - despite the fact that it's pretty straightforward (I was just personally flustered and prepping for an interview). She politely guided me to where I could get a black iced coffee and she found a seat for me to sit and relax with my coffee. She also told me to feel free to look around and get familiar with what they offer and showed me where the bathroom was in case I needed it -- very sweet person. The coffee was delicious, woke me up, and wasn't harsh on digestion (as Starbucks tends to be - sorry). I would wholeheartedly recommend Pret A Manager as a whole, but this location is now special to me.",1,1,1
23,Izzy C.,"Long Island City, NY",5,99,75,4.0,4/13/2016,Good spot for lunch. Selection is good and fresh. I have tried the sandwiches and salads. Some of the items are a little pricey. Great place to eat or take back to the office for lunch with  lots of healthy choices.,1,1,
24,JC L.,"Arcadia, CA",0,15,4,2.0,10/11/2016,"Update: hi Stephanie, I am not sure if there's a way for me to privately message you my email address.. because I don't want to share my email address here in public. Please advise, thanks! --------I am a regular here, usually all the staff are very friendly and courteous, but there is one cashier girl (short, glasses, brown hair) who just isn't very accommodating. This morning I got an oatmeal for myself and the free granola and brown sugar that are always placed under the oatmeal section was empty. I asked her for granola while paying, and she said ""I dont know"" with a very annoyed look. After i paid, I asked a young man who was stacking up bfast wraps about granola and he was extremely friendly and helpful. It took him literally 5 seconds to go get them.",,,
25,Kevin W.,"Santa Monica, CA",0,7,1,5.0,9/29/2016,Wow we need these in LA. Nice people good food and affordable. I walked in feeling blah and perked right up. Pit of awesome apples granola parfait (that's not the real name) and a pretty amazing blueberry muffin. So easy to screw those up. I'll be back!,,,
26,Jyothi J.,"Houston, TX",1,24,2,5.0,6/17/2016,"Friendly +NYC- doesn't normally go together but this place have the most amazing staff. They always greet you with a smile, make you feel special and sometimes hook you up. The food is always fresh, so you might not have the same options in the evening because they sell out pretty quickly. The place is pretty much always clean, and it's my go to place for lunch. Line goes pretty quickly as the staff is very efficient. I love the lunch all boldThe manager must be doing something right this place rocks",,,
27,Helen L.,"Boston, MA",17,30,34,5.0,3/13/2016,"My friends and I came in to this location to rest. Got a coffee and was met with the nicest and most enthusiastic employee. It made my first experience with this chain absolutely awesome. Also, lots of tables were available, and the music was perfect.",,,
28,Juliana B.,"San Francisco, CA",4,81,77,5.0,1/15/2015,My friend took me here. We each got a soup and split a sandwich but then had to go back and buy more because it was so good. I like the idea that they throw away everything in the end of the day. It's too bad there is to places like this in SF.,,,
29,Optimist O.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,262,2,4.0,2/4/2016,"Hate their new salad bowls (narrow at bottom so they tip when you try to cut things in there), but other than that the place is great. Must be a good manager because the staff are always friendly and willing to help. The best is the croissant and the mac and cheese with bacon. soups are great too - though expensive.",,,
30,Chary S.,"Brooklyn, NY",313,264,146,4.0,7/11/2014,"I don't know how I came across this place, but I needed coffee before my meeting.So I took a peek and saw they had breakfast goodies: cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, pre-smeared bagels, salads and all these organic/healthy options! I was pleased to see this! OH, for the juicers, they got some of that, too: beets, greens and some OJ for all.I got the egg & mushroom mini sandwich, I think it's called broche? I forgot, but it was only 3.99 with my large coffee, I spent about 7-something without tax, yay! The only thing about the egg and mushroom broche - it's bland. No pepper, no salt. Coffee was okay, I was hoping it was tasty even if it's black. But they offer creamer, organic soy milk and raw sugar at the ""help yourself"" section I like to call it.The dining experience was chill, too. Spacious area and lots of comfortable seating. Winner Winner.OH, the staff are super helpful and hella quick with service (:",,,1
31,Peter M.,"Fort Lee, NJ",261,394,863,2.0,7/19/2014,"not sure why this location scoops the soup ahead of time and puts it on a shelf for people to grab. Kinda weird in my book since I would want my soup hot. This location seems to emphasize a lot of self service, eg, pouring your own coffee. Other than, this place offers the typical pret fare.",,,
32,Tatiana B.,"Manhattan, NY",245,98,153,5.0,1/9/2014,"I hate breakfast food. I don't know why.  I just never liked it. Next to my new office, Pret is one of those great places that offers ""lunch food"" starting early morning and all the way through the night. One of my favorites is the club sandwich. It is basically a sandwich version of a cobb salad. As of recently, I also started getting into their sodas. Who would have thought that ""yoga bunny detox"" would be the one?Overall, just like all the other Pret's it's always fresh and on the go. The service is fast and it is not ridiculously crowded for the area.",1,,
33,Shradha A.,"Chicago, IL",696,2165,188,3.0,1/19/2012,"This is the newest location to open and I'm a big fan of vegetarian soups in nyc, i was hoping for more options than lentil soup and a miso soup. The toastie was a good sandwich at 4pm when I hadn't had breakfast or lunch, but the chai latte was too spicy and the soup wasn't hot (but it was 4pm). Not so much a fan and they are just opening another one in my office building in Chicago too.. hmm..",,,
34,Terry S.,"Darwin City, Australia",1,2,0,3.0,10/24/2016,Probably one of the healthier places to grab a quick bit in New York the coffee is average but the sandwich I had was quite good.,,,
35,Marcy R.,"New York, NY",605,41,27,5.0,8/24/2012,"I've never thought of myself as a boring person.Until one day.....I looked at my debit card...and realized I've spend 8.15 every single weekday at Pret-a-Manger for almost a year, LOL!The staff here seem to really love their jobs and are always very friendly and have nice things to say about my hair. I love the cobb salad with ranch. As well as the chicken salad with avocado, and the market salad. I used to think I needed two dressing packets, but you just have to open up that salad and carefully divvy it all up and you can get away with one--there's a lot of salad crammed into those little boxes, which is a good thing!Don't forget to ask for a delicious pretzal role to ensure your salad's enough to get you through the rest of the work day. And make sure they don't forget napkins (they don't have them sitting out with the plastic ware)Highly recommend the chocolate chunk cookie for dessert;)The location on Hudson street near canal used to have the most delicious apple/squash soup, and I have not seen it there or at any Pret in a quite a while. Wish they would bring it back! The tomato basil soup is fine, not too substantial--if your eyes are bigger than your stomach and you order it along with your salad and can't finish, it makes a great pasta sauce for later, fyi.",1,,
36,Kate C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,38,2,4.0,11/3/2014,"5 stars just for the customer service. Smiles, going out of their way to assist, Keeping lines moving. Have only had coffee, can't speak for their food.  Bit too loud, however.",,,

38,Monica T.,"New York, NY",88,635,574,3.0,1/12/2013,"This location is right across the street from my office. This place is never crowded, which is great for us to run in, pick something and run back to the office. I was never really a Pret fan mainly because everything is pre-packaged and you can't customize anything but it serves it's purpose of ""get in, get out"". I do however love soups and would come back for that!",,,
39,Nicholas K.,"Brooklyn, NY",165,11,0,5.0,4/28/2015,"I eat lunch here almost every day. The prices are decent, especially for Midtown. The food is good, it's made fresh, and the selections change seasonally to include new and interesting items. The staff in particular is great. One time I was given a free cookie because I had to wait an extra ten seconds for service. Another time they gave me a free croissant because they were out of bread rolls when I asked for one. They're very friendly here and they take really good care of you. It's why I keep coming back.",,,
40,danny s.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,19,4,4.0,4/10/2014,"Friendly and helpful.  The people here, in my experience, work hard, unlike at so many other places in the city.  It's clean and inviting, too.",,,
