0,Aislinn H.,"ASTORIA, NY",182,281,16,4.0,11/8/2018,"Took my in-laws here a few months ago, since it's been on my list for ages and was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. This is one of the oldest bars/restaurants in NYC, and it definitely has that low-ceilinged, creamy floor, dark wood atmosphere - which is charming I think. It's definitely a no frills place, but for all of that they have a surprisingly diverse menu and it is all prepared very well. Their alcohol list is a wee bit limited compared to other NYC establishments, but to be honest you're coming here for the history - not some crazy drinks menu. The staff is friendly and courteous, if a bit busy, but that's a good thing. Coming early on the weekends (like 5:30) is recommended, you'll get seated right away, which is great since they don't take reservations. I think this should be on every NY-ers bucket list at least one since it is a genuine piece of NYC history.",,,1
1,Joelle G.,"New York, NY",289,763,71,2.0,9/25/2018,I came here because two bartenders in London at top notch spots told me to check this place out. I even looked up the history of the place and it's quite amazing. I happened to be in the neighborhood so I wanted to check it out. Lo and behold I arrive and it was ok. Bartender was nice enough though.,,,1

3,Sarah T.,"Brooklyn, NY",84,192,387,5.0,5/26/2018,"It's not often that I find myself in a bar by myself during the day. However, I was meeting someone close by and other places I found along the way were proper restaurants (is if just me, I feel weird eating alone in real restaurants). This bar was just a stones throw away from where I needed to be and a bar is certainly a place you can hang and not feel that pressure to leave. The place has a rich history and a vibe that goes along with it. The people are friendly and I would go back for a cocktail at some point. I just indulged in some mussels and it was awesome. The garlicky wine broth that I soaked my fresh bread, the fresh mussels and even the ice cold water (beer would be better but I didn't want to drink alcohol). Next time I hope to go with company",1,,1

5,Kristian D.,"Land Park, Sacramento, CA",369,1304,3330,3.0,1/30/2018,"I was fortunate to stay in a great part of New York on my last trip, and the unit just happened to be near The Ear Inn. When I learned it was one of the oldest bars in the city, I made sure to try it out. They are located on Spring Street near the Hudson in a small brick building. It is a bit of a walk from the Spring or Canal Street stations.The interior of the bar is fairly narrow with a medium sized bar and dining room in the rear. On my visit on a Tuesday night, the bar was packed with a lot of older businessmen grabbing a drink and some greasy food. Overall, the bar lacked a lot of unique character compared to most in the neighborhood and was not a good value.If The Ear Inn is slow, you might have a better time than I did. It is not a bad bar by any means, but it is more of an average neighborhood bar serving a local audience. It is an old bar, but it is hard to notice inside.",14,2,8

But we were starving so we decided to roll the dice. ""Oh man,"" I thought, ""here I go ordering chicken with red wine sauce and mushrooms, in a bar.""But guess what? It was delicious!

Located in the South Village this bar has a long history dating back to the late 1700's, with the story behind it's name and sign being a interesting story in itself. It appeared to be mostly locals here but everyone was friendly including the bartenders. Had a quick snack and a couple of beers before moving on. I was able to find something in their small selection of craft beers and the spicy garlic shrimp were simple, tasty and served with some nice crusty bread.",,,

Besides taking our order bringing the food out to us there was no additional service. Several times we needed water to be refilled or additional utensils or napkins and every time we had to go up to the bar or the ""server"" and ask for these items. There were 2 people who were suppose to be working the tables that night but one of them was too busy eating her meal and watching TV to help us and the other was too busy doing paperwork. Did I mention that we were the only patrons eating dinner so it wasn't even a full house where I could make an exception if service was poor. Never coming back.",,,

Planned on meeting up with a friend for pre-dinner drinks and landed here because it was close to our destination. Arrived before the after work rush. It was pretty quiet and had a welcoming dive-y feel. You can tell this place has a lot of history as it has a lot of eclectic décor behind the bar. Bartender was friendly, she let me know there was a daily special board behind me. I decided on a glass of wine as I took in the atmosphere waiting for my friend.

I said.""It's a historic old bar and I pass by it all the time."" He was already there when I arrived.""This used to be the house of one of George Washingtons slaves!"" My friend quipped excitedly. (Tourists - right?)I was glad he approved.""The bar maid however, I think she's been in a bad mood since 1877.""  We laughed and moved from the bar to a table.With charm comes snafus.  The most interesting sounding beers on the menu, all European, weren't available.The beers we did receive weren't cold.They also didn't taste like they had enough carbonation.  There is no happy hour either, I guess because it's historic and it's in soho, but beers started around $6-7.The place also didn't have central air.  So it was a little muggy.  All the negatives kind of keep the place from attracting a certain high maintenance diva crowd, and keeps the bars genre firmly sealed as a ""dive bar.""It's on the far western end of Spring right by the water. The walls are randomly covered with photos and framed art that seems thoughtfully placed and chosen.Food looked decent, heavy pub food, almost kind of 1970s with a 1983 update.Worth a visit - but expect some grit.",6,4,6
17,Steph C.,"Los Angeles, CA",3836,3381,93,5.0,8/23/2017,"I have now been to three different bars that claim to be the oldest in New York City--McSorley's, Old Town Bar, and Ear Inn. I went to the last two with my friend Adam S., and when he mentioned that Ear Inn was the ""oldest continuous bar in NYC,"" I was like wait a minute, Adam, what about Old Town Bar? Are you saying they're lying trash?As it turns out, ""oldest bar in New York"" is a pretty hot merit badge, so there are a handful of spots with viable claims based on small but notable distinctions, such as whether they moved locations, or whether they were ever closed between the 19th century and today. I'm reminded of the time I went on the London Eye, which was billed as ""the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel."" It was the highest Ferris wheel in the world for six glorious years, and now it's the highest cantilevered Ferris wheel.Anyway, it was a great bar, delightfully old school, with a cozy atmosphere and eclectic decor. I met up with Adam around four o'clock on a Friday afternoon, and the place was busy, though not so busy that we couldn't get a table and kick back for a couple of hours. Service was great. Everyone on staff was super hospitable, and we got our beers right and quick. I had a couple Goose Island IPAs, and they hit the spot.I wasn't about to order food because I'd just had two lunches, and had two dinners to run to next, but I did help Adam polish off a plate of dumplings. Not like Irish potato dumplings, but straight up potstickers, fried pork dumplings served with soy sauce. They were pretty satisfying, actually, and I enjoyed eating Chinese food at the oldest continuous bar in NYC. Just another example of Asians taking over the world. (Come to think of it, the London Eye was outdone by the Star of Nanchang, then the Singapore Flyer. The current highest observation wheel is the High Roller in Las Vegas, which is a wonderful American city crawling with Asians.)I had a great time here, and would recommend it if you want a piece of history with your drinks. I'm enjoying my extremely slow crawl of the oldest bars in New York. I might try Pete's Tavern next year, but wouldn't mind circling back for another drink at Ear Inn.",6,3,6
18,Pasquale R.,"Madison, NJ",1825,1613,269,3.0,2/5/2018,No frills. Cold beer. Prompt service. Crammed seating. Expensive brews (basic drafts $8...gotta love NYC). It's nostalgic. It's old. Oldest bar in country? So they claim (and so do 2 other spots too). It's now crossed off my bucket list. It's not very big either and there is limited seating at the bar. Worth a stop in for a drink and I am unsure of how good the food is as we didn't come here to eat.,5,1,3

After one of my friends ordered and received his beer it was my turn to order. Since my other friend and I had decided to get the same cocktail I was planning to order them together. It was loud at the bar. While I ordered the two cocktails (verbally) I pointed at the name of the cocktail in the menu and used two fingers (pointing finger and middle finger) to indicate the number two.The barkeeper suddenly turned very rude asking me what I was thinking showing him two fingers this way and called me rude, followed by showing me the middle finger to compare how bad my two finger gesture was. Me and my friend felt like we were in the wrong place. I tried to explain that I was not aware about what the two finger gesture means other than the number two, but he wouldn't stop. Whereupon we left the bar without the drink.I (am a European woman) still don't know why he was offended and treated me this way.",1,2,

It is one of the longest operating bars in NYC, and you can tell why when you visit!The Ear Inn is a typical Irish pub, but unlike other Irish pubs in NYC, this one feels like you're stepping into a pub from 50 years ago - and it's a good thing! The decorations are unique, and fun to look at! There's a few cool things hanging on the wall about the Titanic, which I found interesting. The space inside is small, so I wouldn't suggest this for large groups, but it's a great place for a drink with a friend or two. The drinks are priced fine for NYC, and the food too. The food is actually quite good for bar food. Totally recommend!",,,1

Updated review","Here I am in SoHo after seeing a Christmas concert at the Greene Space on Charlton Street.I've driven by the place a few times, and am fascinated with the history of the place!It's a Tuesday night and the place is hopping.  The bar is packed with an eclectic crowd   Everyone seems to be in a rather festive mood. The hostess finds me a table in the front section.  The bartenders look like they've just stepped out of the 19th Century.  In fact the whole place is a lively boisterous party.  This place could be a backdrop for a scene out of Dickens' ""Christmas Carol.""My waitress Lorna has a delightful brogue and she recommends a Pinot noir which is delicious I immediately order a salad and the chicken pot pie and Lorna quickly brings the food out.  WOW!   The food is delicious.  The chicken pot pie is probably the best I've ever had!   They made it with bay leaves.   It is different and wonderful   I devour it! The ambience the food the wine is just perfect!John must be smiling down from heaven!!",1,,
23,Krista J.,"Brooklyn, NY",732,1177,35,4.0,5/20/2017,"There's a lot of old New York charm and history at the Ear Inn. And some pretty great food!My friend and I had dinner there on a very warm 90-degree night. Because the restaurant has no air conditioning, and the humidity was insane, it was a bit uncomfortable, even with all the windows open and some cold rose wine. But we still enjoyed some appetizers (the mussels and the dumplings...so good) and dinner (quiche of the day for me, and the hot and spicy shrimp with salad for my friend). Service was fine, though we had three different servers over the course of two hours. And it's pretty cool that they have an outdoor seating space (no tables) for drinking on the curb. It reminded me of London, where there are no issues with drinking outside on the sidewalk.",2,,

Its not one of those places I would seek out to come to, but all of my friends are regulars here. For me, coming here is more about the great company than the bar.",,,1
28,David B.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,277,87,2.0,10/17/2017,"Had such high hopes, and frankly, they would have been met if I had limited my visit to drinks. Dinner is where the place falls flat.Very cool, old/historic spot. Yes, you've probably read that it, along with McSorley's are amongst the oldest continual watering holes in NYC. The place oozes with old-school charm.The bar is simple. A dozen or so beers on tap ($8), and a short, but solid cocktail list ($12). You could easily spend a cozy evening here and have no complaints.The much-hyped burger was indeed the best item that made it to our table. However, the vaunted ""Pat LaFrieda"" beef is no longer a specialty in the City as you can find it all over the place, most notably at the ever-growing Shake Shack chain. You probably won't be disappointed in the burger ($12).Specials:Mussels - 1/4 were not open. This is not a good sign. Tasted very fishy and could have greatly benefitted from a more garlicky base. Mac & Cheese ($7) - How does one screw this up? By putting what seems like Kraft (out of the box) into a dish heated over the open grill. It was a watery mess with flavorless pasta and very diluted cheese mix.Spaghetti w/ Shrimp ($17) - Oof, the worst plate of them all. The shrimps were cooked far beyond what is required and in turn were very tough and flavorless. Likewise, the spaghetti and marinara sauce was inexplicably void of flavor.Avoid the kitchen until you've had enough drinks to make it worth your while and we've got a 4-5 star spot!",,1,

They treated us very poorly for no reason at all. We weren't sure what was going on at the beginning so we let a lot of the attitude go. Then I understood when the guy told my Hispanic friend ""tranquilo, tranquilo"" who had been trying to order a drink for a while (while the waiters were talking and serving other people).Anyway, it kept going on for the whole time we were there: getting attitude, being ignored when we need a drink, getting cursed at because they don't know what we order (pickleback shot, the old fart had no idea what it was)... even when we tried to pay and leave, they made us wait 20mn before they gave us back our card and they didn't want to give us a pen to sign the receipt!

This is your typical irish pub with 5/6 beers on tap a fully stocked bar. My group got there around 6/7ish, it wasn't crowded but there were people occupying the tables/bar. It served as a great in between spot to figure where to go to next. The bartender was nice, the beer was good, and the atmosphere was chill. I would go back for a few pints and maybe to sample some food. Not sure how it gets later in the evening, but I recommend bar you're looking to talk and drink. The music wasn't loud and the selection is solid. The Ear Inn is off the beaten path so it's hard to find unless someone tells you about it or you're wandering around SoHo.

32,Brian A.,"New York, NY",3,37,0,4.0,8/29/2017,"The high review is mostly for the ambiance. This is an old school bar with fantastic old school ambiance combining bits of a dive bar, speakeasy, and steakhouse all into one. It is definitely worth going to get one (overpriced by far) drink. The crummy beer selection has about 7 to 10 beers priced at about $8 a beer. If they could just serve one decent craft beer, I would probably be back. The glasses of crummy wine go from $11 to $13. I came with a friend for the burger (2.5 out of 5) after I saw it on a Thrillist list. The burger is definitely overrated and has no place being on any top burger list. It is a basic bun and juicy but flavorless meat. The burger did not cost much, maybe about $10 ($14 with the tip I included). Overall, come for one drink and ambiance. Skip the burger.",1,,

A stroll to the far west side of the West Village brought me to Ear Inn at around midnight on a Friday. The entire bar was packed, the rear even more than the bar, patrons drinking and eating on in the very unassuming rear, old tables covered with white paper, glasses holding crayons topping them for any aspiring artists. We eventually just posted up at the bar and ordered some fried pork dumplings; for what they were, they were pretty tasty! Drinks were good and cheap; $7 for a pint of cider was okay, though, at that point in the evening, I was sticking strictly to water. (Haaa.) This place is pretty cool, the history is long, and though it's a pain in the butt to get to, transportation-wise, I'd want to revisit to really see what it's all about.",7,3,5
43,Ellis B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,56,10,5.0,3/19/2016,"Why I LOVE the Ear:1)  Sunday nights.  GREAT jazz standards, Dixie Land, swing from highly acclaimed trumpet player Jon-Erik Kellso and his ""Ear-regulars"" band. The music is presented in a casual, ""let's kick back and jam"" manor.  And given the limited size of the performance space, the players are almost mixed in with the tables....feels like you're really part of the music!!  Excellent food.  Great atmosphere. Over the course of several years, I've tried to make it over to the Ear for this great music as often as I can - which isn't often enough.2) The back area is terrific for large groups.  This Saturday (lunchtime) I had reserved the back room for 12.  A few unexpected guests increased our number - but no problem -   our smiling, welcoming waitress Christine (Kristine?) gladly accommodated all of us.  All of the menu items we ordered (salads, burgers, dumplings, etc.) were greatly enjoyed.3)  Lots of easy parking in the area - which isn't the case in most of Manhattan.4) Authentic old New York charm  - in a landmark building.   Fewer and fewer places are like this......",2,,2
44,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1506,175,2.0,2/4/2016,Since when does a dive bar decide to prohibit talking on your cell phone?  This is not fine dining.  Just stupid.  The Bass Ale was flat.  Bartender did not impress but she did offer to trade off my Bass for a shot or another beer which was considerate.Moderately busy on a Wednesday afternoon. Local dive bar; not worth a long walk.  Been around forever. Did not try the food.  Don't recall the background music.,5,1,
45,Brittany A.,"Houston, TX",390,7,3,5.0,11/10/2017,"First day in town and stumbled across this bar on the way back to our hotel. We met Mick, the bartender, who was great! Very hospitable, made great drinks and kept us entertained as well. We met a few guys that were traveling through as well and this is where they prefer to grab a drink when in the area. Fun atmosphere, great bartender, and oddly enough, really good music!! We found out that they had a square chart going for football and bought a few squares. Also, Mick invited us to come by their 200 year anniversary block party on Saturday. We will be sure to be there! We had a great time and are looking forward to stopping in again!",,,
46,Fred C.,"Bergenfield, NJ",125,1,0,5.0,5/24/2018,"I give this bar the highest honor which a man of my caliber can bestow. The menu has one of the most well researched and dynamic descriptions of a historical property that I have ever seen. No where does it claim to be the oldest bar in NY as I saw on a highly rated post, it just runs down the history of the establishment, which is wondrous. Once a river front property to George Washington's ""chief of staff"" of sorts, a man thought to be depicted on the famous painting of Washington crossing the Hudson, and a successful African American. And in later years, a bit of a clubhouse for the seafaring folk that would bless Manhattan's coast from time to time. But really savage folks. Men like me, no doubt, in many ways. On the particular night that I wandered into this dirty pearl I heard tall tales from band members reminiscent of Hunter S Thompson circa 1971 (yes there is live music). And I ate a wholesome meal. And local men insisted on buying rounds for natives and tourists all the same. Not because this was a routine night, but because this was different for some reason. Because usually there isn't a young man from Tuscany sitting at the bar. And usually there isn't a man from New Jersey getting a late meal and a pint. And there would never be another night like it again. I can't say how this bar is every night, and manybe that's the main point. On any night this bar could be a good call. Every staff member I met looked me in the eyes and was as real as real. And every moment was one which a man of my caliber would cherish. Booze and all.",,,

The bar is still using the old register from the I think the 50's.  I think they finally take credit cards now.  It really is a must visit if you want to experience what makes New York such a great place.  If you a beer, steak, potatoes, and nostalgia kind of person.  You'll love The EarThanks, don't ever change",4,,1

I wasn't expecting to find the place open since on a Sunday night in Hudson Square the streets were completely empty. Next I was surprised how busy it was and how diverse the groups of people were there. Next I was surprised how amazing the Saint Summer martini I ordered tasted considering the more 'dive bar' feel the place was giving. Finally I was surprised how crazy good the food was. I won't lie that we were nervous about ordering food considering how 'divey' the place looked but regardless we ordered the mac and cheese and the hot and spicy shrimp. We couldnt' decide which one was more amazing! I also liked that they have paper on the tables with crayons - probably for children but I still had fun doodling.,,,

The theme to this place is like old Irish sailor which derives from it's history of when the dock use to be 5 feet away from the joint and sailors would come through and drink. It was known to be a men's only speakeasy bar, but now WE IN THIS PIECE. Anyways, I can go on and on about the history on this place because of how interesting it is, but it's best to just read it on the menu. It's a low key place and I've come here before with coworkers to get a drink during our lunch time to ease our stress at work. The burgers from The Ear Inn is excellent, it's definitely something I look forward to. Honestly, I've tried their other items on their menus and it was all good and delicious.

My friend and I came in here to get out from the rain and have a couple beers. The prices were average about $7-8 for a pint. The waitresses were old school and could probably be considered ""career waitresses"" at this point. There's nothing trendy or hip about this place.

PRO TIP 2: you will get yelled at if you take a phone call in the bar. texting etc. is fine. just don't be  douche about it. the staff is friendly-ish, but to the point blunt. i appreciate honesty, so to me...i find them refreshing and super likable. to tourists and the entitled probably not so much.  staff is typically one bartender and a waitress taking food and drink orders from the tables. they are hardworking folks, so be patient when the bar is slammed. service is good and done with a smile and clever comments!the bathrooms? divey. old. femmes have to deal with one stall. so for girl groups this place is a struggle. the dudes room have two urinals and a toilet that are WAY TOO CLOSE TOGETHER! i mean close enough that you're definitely getting backspray from the guy next to you who's pissing at the adjoining urinal. seriously, wtf! lol. i know this is an old school joint, but i feel like while i was taking a piss that the guy next to me was my shadow. ugh. this place opens at noon. serves booze soaking food. is close to PIER 40 which is where my posse and i were heading for a boat event. and sell beer at a reasonable price. i wouldn't say it's cheap though. i've had way cheaper in nyc. actually it should be cheaper. 1 star off for the weird credit card policy and 1 star off for the urinal situation. drops the mic no where near the men's bathroom!i out.",42,40,40

After we got our check on our table for 6, she refused to come back after being hailed down for a simple request of water. Their menu clearly states 3 credit card max on orders up to $100. A bill of over $200 was refused 3+ cards because apparently calculators don't exist anymore. The portions of food were pretty big and tasted good but their menu isn't really to date with their restaurant procedures and after an auto grat, our waitress literally disappeared. After getting our cards back and signing an auto gratuity receipt, the ONE water request needed to be asked TWICE. I thought water was a standard procedure at restaurants.

There was a live jazz quartet tucked in the corner, playing amazing music, and some stranger sat at our table and let us share his burger (don't worry he cut it in half first;), and I can honestly say it was the best burger I have ever had. I mean I can't stop thinking about it (and I rarely ever eat burgers). There are some tables in the front near the bar and a section of tables in the back if you're there for more of a dinner with a group. Overall just a really chill place with a warm inviting vibe.

74,Al H.,"Egg Harbor Township, NJ",0,41,0,4.0,3/14/2017,Been to the EAR a few times in the evening and the afternoon. Have never dined there. Sat at the bar and had a beer. Great history and character. You will meet some interesting bar patrons at the EAR.The $30 credit card limit is probably due to the Merchant Fees that business' have to pay the credit companies to allow charges. The $30 minimum probably helps defray the Merchant Fees the business must pay. No mind to me as I carry both hard currency cash and plastic. Many people today only carry plastic and sometimes have trouble paying their bills as a result. The EAR is a bar is a bar. It might be a little rough with the old time bartenders. You could be yelled at by the bartender for some infraction. This place may not be right for you if you are timid and easily offended. The EAR is just an old bar with old bar ways. I am fine with that. I will be back when on Spring Street again.,,,

76,Ed L.,"Honolulu, HI",815,1970,8891,4.0,5/16/2014,"When in New York City, you hit up the Ear Inn in SoHo.At least that's where I went after dropping off my stuff in Jersey City upon arrival. First things first upon my short stay in New York City, is to hang out and enjoy the nightlife.  I didn't do a mobile check in since my iPhone ran out of juice in transit, so I just made a mental note that I was here. I came here with my friend, who lives in Jersey City and arrived here around 7:30pm on Thursday, May 9. This place was already packed to begin with. I guess people find any excuse to party and drink at any time of the day. With that said, a group of marathoner friends had already camped out here waiting for us to arrive. We were basically fashionably late and got a table pretty close to the door. It was okay, since my legs were already kind of tired from the travel and running at least one marathon on this trip. The overall experience was pretty good. We stayed here till about 9pm and left thereafter to another bar before making our way back to the PATH. My Jersey City friend was drunk, so I had to be the sober one to make the decisions. LolThe Ear Inn is located at 326 Spring Street in the South Village district of Manhattan. Since this place does get crowded on any given night, it was interesting to catch myself at a bar, but when in NYC, it's bound to happen I suppose. The noise level of this place can be classified as loud enough, since you can hear people talk, but that's about it. The lights were low enough to be sort of romantic in nature, but I guess that's how bars are. Cant say enough about driving in New York City, so save yourself the car keys and take the subway or walk it.  They have street parking up front or nearby, but its usually a hassle anyway, so public transport or walking is your best bet.  Ear Inn takes credit cards, so that's always a plus for me. As it turns out, since it was my 1st time in NYC, a friend of mine actually took the check after we ate and paid for both our meals. I didn't realize it till he gave our server his credit card without seeing the bill. That's pretty awesome, I think! I thanked him, of course. It was a nice night to hang out with friends with a couple of beers and dinner in New York City, that's for sure!I ultimately found solace with the angus burger, which was okay. It was tasty and delicious, but the price was well over $10, which came with French fries on the side. I ordered it medium.  I also had a couple of guinesses and a corona, which all hit the spot as well.  The beer, while familiar, was excellent as always. The company here was rather good, especially when most of them had run multiple marathons over the course of several years. The Ear Inn seemed too small for the patrons it was serving, but at least it had a bathroom in the rear of the establishment. Not sure if you can call this place a bar or a restaurant, since it does do both. We did sit next to the photo of Abraham Lincoln that had a sign that said something about Republicans. Probably too stoned to remember it though, but I remember that photo.  The company was great and the service was good. I enjoyed myself here before bar hopping around later that night. Recommend it if you are in the area and need to unwind from a tough challenging day. A few beers will help numb it all down. Support local!B",3,,3

The bar itself is fine and I can look past the fact that a server will forget a drink or two once in a while, but there is absolutely no excuse for angrily yelling at a group of 10 people for asking if we can push a couple tables together. You probably also didn't need to sprint across the room and slam your hands down to desperately clutch the table that got rotated a couple inches, either. I promise, we weren't going to steal it.Incompetence aside, this was without a doubt the rudest, least respectful level of service I've ever received outside of a Dick's Last Resort.

The space is tight, but no one seemed bothered by the accidental swipe of an elbow or hand when reaching for your draft Boddingtons the bartender set in front of you.

Also they have an area outside where you can drink on the street!

I love old historical places. My second experience, which was March 2016, was a little less good. The music was incredible and I love everything about the place itself even more this time. However, the folks were aggressively shushy. I don't mind if someone wants to shush me, I can appreciate the need for no talking in order to appreciate the music. Truly, I get it. Go ahead and shush me. That's fine to shush me - I didn't realize my whisper wasn't quiet enough.

I had dinner there and the food was surprisingly good. I also found the prices to be very fair. I didn't have alcohol so I can't comment on that. But a friend of mine did ask for a margarita & she hated it. So next time I'll probably go with one of their signature cocktails. Service was good & I liked the decoration of the place.

The bartender (bald guy with a grey goatee), couldn't quite understand my Brazilian friend's order due to the loud music, but then started berating him for not speaking English properly. That was after he berated a girl in our group for ordering a non-alcoholic drink. Needless to say the night quickly turned sour for us.",3,2,

After the long, hot walk to the spot, we walked right in and had a seat. The place looks as old as it is and has a bit of a musty smell to go with it. Musty like an old, old, wooden ship. Anyway, tried the house ale and a (sirloin) burger. My wife had a turkey club. Both were above average for a bar. I enjoyed the burger quite a bit. I also could have had a couple more beers if time would have allowed it. Very drinkable. Prices were reasonable. It's a bit out of the way, but I would go again if in the area!",,,

They don't take rezzies. It's a Friday night. We head to a great meal around the corner but, come here for post dinner drinks. A dive in the middle of nowhere in the west village? Yes please!!!This place is a whole in the wall with tables in back room and a few tables in the front room with a nice wood bar. A few tvs. Drink prices are averagish. $7 for a large draft beer $8-10 for a shot. They had a somewhat wide variety of beer on draft - Hoegarden, Radstberger, Brooklyn Lager. My favorite part of this bar was the the laid back vibe. No snootiness, just straight drinking. The bartender was hilarious and sassy. Straight off the boat from Ireland, her accent was rockin' and so was her sunny and fun disposition.The food looked amazing. People were still eating at about 10:30 when we were there and I saw burgers and mussels and both looked plentiful and smelled fresh and delicious. I'll most definitely be back here to meet friends for some dinner and potentially make this my go to in the West/South Village.",5,4,5
102,Jane K.,"New York, NY",40,80,33,4.0,7/7/2014,"What a gem! Newly moved to NYC and was looking for some place I'd like to hang out and feel like I'm home. This was it. Yes, it's small. So there. I went on a Sunday night specifically to see the free Jazz since, frankly, it was free and the sticker shock of moving here is freaking me out! This was a win-win night. The staff was super nice. I sat at the bar and positioned myself where I would have good sight to the band when they played. Barry the bartender was a major highlight. Straight talking and honest about the menu and his recommendations were spot on -- as were the recos from the rest of the staff. I ordered the Lamb Burger medium-rare and it was delicious! And it was done perfectly. I also got the fried pork dumpling appetizer -- also very flavorful and not greasy at all.Now let's talk Jazz! The ""Earregulars"" as they are called were top notch! Great chops. I'm pretty snotty about musicians since it is my background and they did not disappoint. The mix was Bass, Guitar, alto sax and trumpet. For such a small place I was worried with so much brass in the house but their dynamics were perfect for the room and mutes were used as well when needed. A few guest performers joined in and were also terrific. One woman sang and blew my mind. Her voice was a time travel to a Bix Biederbecke performance. The clientele was also wonderfully eclectic. The age range was 20s-60s and every shape and size. This place was such a wonderful surprise of good reasonably priced food, good people and culture. With a homey feel. I hope to make it a regular stop. I guess they do music and Mondays and Wednesdays as well.",3,,1
103,Erin M.,"Manhattan, NY",1313,562,412,4.0,5/12/2011,"What I like about this place is that it's very laid back. It's got a timeless appeal because it's got tv's but yet it's got this old homey kind of feel. It's a quaint old place stuck in a city that's modernizing around it. It's not stuck back in the 1800's but it hasn't reached this decade yet either. It's a blend of the past few decades meshed into one bar.Everyone who works here is super friendly, full of smiles and from around the area- they def. make this place feel even more like home! The people who work here are very down to earth and that's hard to find in Manhattan. The Ear Inn has the perfect equation for a comfortable place to relax: It def a laid back vibe- very casual, a little dirty, and a no cell phone policy.  What I like about this place is that people of all ages can come here and either enjoy a meal, drink, dessert or all three together while listening to live band music (they are there every Sunday). I love coming here to go out just to go out without having to get ready and dress up. I will be back, def. a spot to hit up if you're just looking for something fun and casual with nice live music.",,,

The prices, especially for the location, are extremely fair.  The waitstaff were friendly, attentive, and efficient.  I ordered a veggie burger which was totally fine.  Not amazing, not bad, but exactly fine.  My friend seemed very happy with his turkey sandwich, even commenting on the quality of the turkey. The best part was the crayons and white paper table cloth!  I didn't anticipate that the night would include doodling on the table, but it's hard not to when the option is staring you in the face.  It added some fun and whimsy to the night. This restaurant has a no-cell phone policy (meaning, no actual phone calls), which I respect, but the sign informing patrons of that is not obviously posted.  I received a phone call that I had to take and, to be polite, stepped away from my table, and innocently stumbled into the path of the very surly bartender who loudly and rudely told me to get off the phone - in a way I found quite embarrassing.  This was how I learned of the policy.  Other than that, the night was great and I would definitely come back here.",2,,

Great vibe and pub food, they pour one of the best Guinness this side of the pond.  Decent scotch selection.If they have clam chowder, try it.On Friday and Saturday nights, it definitely gets a bit ""bro-y"" and crowded, but avoid these times and you'll love it.  On Sunday evenings, you can see the Earregulars play some great jazz!",3,1,4

We were meeting another couple for dinner. Emily and the rest of her skankified crew were loud, obnoxious and acting very entitled. Standing on chairs, screeching and disrupting the dining area are with their loud mouths. When asked to leave, the motley crew started to whine like children ""their money was not welcome there"". That is 100% accurate. A round of applause escorted their trashy asses out the door.After that temporary interruption, we enjoyed a lovely dinner. The kale salad, quiche and mussels were divine.

We were seated all the way in the back next to the ladies bathroom and i felt like i had 0 room to breathe in this tight cramped space. I feel like this bar tried to cram as much tables and furniture as possible without thinking of space and comfort. Anyway the waitress was really friendly and had a good attitude, the options of draft beer for seven bucks were pretty decent including guiness blue moon and oktoberfest, and they were cold which quenched my thirst;). They also have cocktails and other bottled beers , i havent tried their cocktails but id love to see considering the large options i saw out in he front.

Mickey is the best!  He greets you with his kind smile everyone is yelling orders at him and he still keeps calm shows the utmost respect to everyone. If you ask for a cappuccino Mickey will explain kindly that they don't have cappuccino but his boss Martin has a cappuccino machine hidden in the kitchen and Mickey goes back in the kitchen and makes the cappuccino himself.The conversations with Mickey are always positive.

It's a huge neon sign that once said ""Bar"", but the 'B' is messed up, so it reads ""Ear"", hence the name. Incredible old building was  built before 1812 and was originally the home of James Brown, an African-American United States Revolutionary War veteran, who was the proprietor of a tobacco store on the ground floor of the house. It is rumored that Brown is one of the soldiers near the front of the boat in Emanuel Leutze's painting ""Washington Crossing the Delaware.""In 1817, a tavern opened in the space, making it one of the oldest bars in New York City. Its proximity to the water made it popular with sailors and longshoremen. It had a brewery that was later turned into a restaurant.Today, the Ear Inn is no longer on the shores of the Hudson, as subsequent development saw landfill push the riverbank further west. The Ear now sits between Washington Street and Greenwich street, just east of the West SIde Highway. Ok! All that history is making me hungry. The Ear has one of the BEST burgers in NYC. let me repeat that. One of THE BEST burgers in NYC. I don't know what they do to make them so delicious, but they are huge and amazing. They come with a side of roasted potatoes and a small salad. Although I've only had the burger here, I did sample the New England Clam chowder, which was money, and the dumblings, which were also delicious.

131,Ryan B.,"North Haven, CT",28,145,0,4.0,12/29/2013,"Let me set the stage...Five best friends meet up in TriBeCa for an impromptu night out in the city. While parking, one notices the ""Ear"" sign and throws out the suggestion that we check it out after dinner. Great. Suggestion. Two things I did not like? The waitresses were a bit frazzled when we walked in and seemed annoyed with our ""large"" party. Kinda off putting. They also messed up one of our beers in the first round.Let me walk you through the highlights...1) The bouncer was very cordial and warned us that the place was cash only at the door instead of letting us find out the hard way. He suggested two ATMs we could use. Great first impression.2) The waitresses referenced above turned out to be awesome. They were cracking up at us playing ""Heads Up"" with my iPhone and even came over to play a round. They ended up buying us a round of shots just because we were awesome. 3) Mac n' Cheese was awesome! 4) Cool atmosphere. It just did not feel like we were in NYC. It felt more like a lighthouse. There were a bunch of older regulars dressed in fisherman sweaters and stuff. Everyone has happy. It felt cozy.Oh and it is the second oldest bar in NYC! Very cool!!!!",,,

Go to Fanelli's in SoHo instead.",,,
134,Fred C.,"Manhattan, NY",114,21,14,4.0,10/12/2015,"Great local spot, no frills. Always a great crowd here. They let you stand out on the street and have drinks. Great for a warm weather day. And a cold weather daytoo! I love coming here and having whiskey, beer, andddd the burger!!! Best burger in New York City. So underrated. A friend recommended it and it does not disappoint. A simple high quality burger, nothing fancy. But just perfect. It's also a super historic place. It's been open for a very long time, I think it's some sort of landmark in the city. I see signs in the subways that it's a historical site which is pretty cool. How often do you get to get drunk at a historic landmark? Not very often!

The bar was full of afternoon drinkers and there were a few people outside drinking on the benches.We asked for water to drink and the waitress promptly gave us some bread, pretzel sticks, and butter.For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and crab cakes which came with roasted potatoes and a salad. My friend tried to order the chicken pot pie, but was denied because the last one had gone to a nearby patron. The waitress recommended shepherd's pie so he took that instead. His entree came with a salad as well. I thought my food was pretty good. The salad dressing was creamy (looked like Russian) so I scraped most of it off since I prefer vinegary dressings, but it was still good and a refreshing accompaniment to my shrimp and crab cakes. The portions were generous for the price and I couldn't finish my food. I thought the shrimp and crab cakes were well seasoned and fresh and delicious. I didn't try my friend's food, but he finished all of it, so I assume it was good.There are crayons on the table so we entertained ourselves by drawing on the paper tablecloth.I liked the old-timey ambiance of the pub and definitely enjoyed myself.

MY friend and I were hungry so we ordered some mussels and potatoes. I also ordered a Brooklyn Lager. The mussels weren't that expensive and it was a generous helping.  They were good, but not the best.  The potatoes were good - they were like rosemary potatoes. The decor is cute and simple, actually reminded of me a bar I've been to Nice, France. There are crayons on the table to color and draw on the paper tablecloth.

141,Matthew M.,"Granite Springs, NY",127,54,7,4.0,4/24/2016,"One of my favorite places in New York City for live old timey jazz on Sunday nights (Jon-Erik Kellso & The Earregulars - Kellso (cornet/trumpet), usually Matt Munisteri on guitar, Scott Robinson or others on saxophones or clarinets, Neal Miner on upright bass and others sitting in) and pub food. Their mussels, soups and pasta dishes are delicious and though I don't drink I know that they have a decent wine & spirits collection. If you come for the music and want a table you have to eat and/or drink. Sometimes they seat you in the back room where you can hear the music but a lot of people talk over it unfortunately. I never go on other nights. Don't think they have music on other nights but I know the joint is hopping all week long given their legendary status as one of the oldest pubs in Manhattan, dating back to the 1700s, when the Hudson River Line was right up to the pub. Now it's at least two blocks further not including the West Side Highway.",,,

Updated review","My office is just steps away from this restaurant. They are by far the best lunch place in the area. It's just a neighborhood place, unlike all the chain restaurants popping up all over this area.  I'm guessing it's supposed to be like an Irish pub. But it has Great burgers, great salads, great specials. Girls that work there are always friendly, and attractive.  CELL PHONES NOT PERMITTED!! How cool is that? A place that encourages drinking and eating and conversations without distraction!  Excellent beer selection. There is a sign right outside indicating where the waters of the Hudson River used to be. Most interesting thing about this place, there are three Chinese guys I don't speak much English working in the kitchen.  But they make some of the best American food I have ever tasted. Something huh??",1,,
143,Lily J.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,4.0,8/3/2016,"Really a gem. I first came here over 30 years ago, and the only reason I don't stop in more often it that it's a hike from where I live. But I love this place. The music is great, the staff are lively and loose and add to the atmosphere of stepping back into just about any era you want --over the past two centuries! One of us had the steak, which was delicious, the other the mac 'n cheese special and we shared some tasty mussels. All were priced very reasonably; overall a very nice  evening out!",,,

Jeezus it's so cluttered and claustrophobic in there. No happy hour prices, at least none advertised. Bartender tells you to keep it down while you're conversing.... That's enough for me to give them one star.",,1,
145,Skojo B.,"Albany, NY",0,52,0,4.0,11/18/2013,"So, we were looking for a place to grab a bite to eat before seeing a show at City Winery and the Ear Inn was exactly what we were looking for. Friend 1 ordered the mussels and said they were awesome - they looked and smelled great and there were lots of em. Friend 2 ordered the salmon salad over greens and said it was great. Friend 3 had the cobb salad and said it was tasty. I ordered a burger with blue cheese and mushrooms, side of fries and some salad and it was great. The burger was about $13, salads were like $13, mussels were $10, I don't remember what the wines and Guinness cost. Overall, thought the bill was reasonable. Additionally, I liked the simplicity of the menu and the place itself. Felt like my neighborhood restaurant/bar and had a touch of history. By the way, check out Google Maps and use the StreetView tool. You can actually ""walk"" inside the Ear Inn and get an idea of the layout. Highly recommended place. Cheers!",,,
146,Peter F.,"Washingtonville, NY",0,13,0,4.0,1/4/2016,"We came to The Ear to eat and drink before attending a show at City Winery. I have long been a fan of this funky, old dive but in reading the reviews here I saw a few complaints of rudeness. Since we only dealt with the waitresses I can't speak about the bartender. The wait staff, however, was wonderful. These ladies were sharp, engaging and fun to deal with. Our main waitress hailed from Cork, Ireland and she was a delight. Our table had everything from burgers and chili to a rack of lamb. The entrees were all exceptional (as were the fried dumpling appetizers) and the drinks were replenished with merely a look at our waitress. We got to talk a bit with the chef; he concocts some great dishes in the tiny kitchen and it is always fun to watch him work from the tables. The vibe was happy and upbeat like it usually is at the tables in back. I had their burger, and it was delicious. 82% lean with 18% fat, they are hand-made on the flat top and are so delicious and juicy. Owner Martin Sheridan suggests a martini with your burger, but I had some Jamesons. My cheeseburger was great and the whiskey couldn't dim the flavor..I always enjoy coming to The Ear and this visit confirmed my affections for this bar. Good job, Ear Inn.",1,,

148,Heather J.,"Suffern, NY",35,75,0,4.0,4/19/2015,"A very cool place, short on space but an overall great experience. The burger and beer transported me to a time when  I was in London sitting in a pub. That memory faded until I had to use the bathroom, not so much fun. The food is really pretty good here, decor is cool and prices were okay. Ruwan J's review of Ear Inn broke it down pretty much how it is. But come here and enjoy it, it is a fun place!",,,
149,Mark A.,"Bangor, ME",160,246,34,1.0,4/10/2014,"Maybe I went in with high expectations (as the Ear Inn was on my bar bucket list), thinking it would be a hybrid of Fraunces Tavern and McSorley's, but wow, was I mistaken.  Both of those bars have a clear aura of cool about them and awesome staff -- hell, Fraunces even sports a museum, and McSorley's is so kickass that it only needs to serve 2 kinds of beer.  The Ear Inn on the other hand has...a cool story about how landfill took away its Hudson River shore space?  Maybe some dedicated neighborhood folks who swear by it?  Who knows.The decor looked like an Irish pub merged with your grandma's small living room.  There is hardly any room to stand near the bar due to the management's decision to pack a bazillion tables in the front area -- as a result, there were a lot of awkward exchanges of ""excuse me"" between patrons and wait staff trying to walk by.  Strike one.  The tap was out of the beer I wanted, and the bartender nearly growled at my wife for ordering a gin & tonic, which returned almost undrinkable (9 parts gin, 1 part tonic, 0 limes).  Strike two.  Once finally seated, our waiter had run out of menus and took 10 minutes to return.  I decided to opt for the burger, which I had read was touted by some as being one of the best in the city.  What I received was an overcooked, thick lump on a bun.  My friend barely touched his shrimp pasta, and my wife commented that the mac 'n cheese had clearly come from powder.  Strike three.I mean, I know it's a bar, and food should be more of a filler than a feature there, but this is NYC, which has a higher standard to be met.   Also, it couldn't even offer what a good Irish bar should: good booze and fun.  Needless to say, we chose not to order a second round of drinks (not that the waiter was around to get one) and left as soon as possible.  We had better bars to hit that night.",4,4,1
150,George G.,"Carteret, NJ",24,546,0,4.0,12/14/2012,"This is a great bar with a good beer selection (served in 20oz pints!) and food. Ended up drinking the house beer which is made by Brooklyn Brewing with a close approximation of the recipe used to make Fidelio Beer originally made onsite at the Ear Inn. The bartender was really nice as well as the patrons!Being a bit hungry, we tried 2 different items before making our way to a Holiday party nearby:- Spicy Shrimp: About 5 shrimp in a shallow dish with a really tasty spicy sauce based on Sriracha. A bit of a small dish, but the dipping bread provided made it worth it I think. The bartender was nice enough to bring us out some more bread w/o being prompted so that we could finish up the sauce.- Pork Dumplings: Hand-made and served maybe 5 or 6 to the plate with a soy sauce based dip. These were not bad.In addition to the above, sampled the NYC Hot Sauce they stock made by Belcestro's locally. This was phenomenal and based on habanero. No preservatives, guar gums, or any other rubbish - all natural.Before I mentioned the people here are nice. We started talking with a nearby couple and they ended up buying us a highball of Woodford Reserve Distiller Select. That was some strong Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey but I think it definitely tasted a bit better than Jack Daniels from Tennessee.I could definitely see why a lot of friends from Arup used to go here after work (and some of them still do!).",1,,

I was dining with like, eight friends and everyone else had food and I was merely trying to appease the comfort of the wait staff for forgetting to put in an entire order. Then the waitress was RUDE about it all - she forced me to get another beer instead of just taking the $8 dumplings off. Oh and. The dumplings are great, but they are nothing more than the delicious dumplings you get in chinatown 5/$1 - except they charge $8... for 6.... so this place is lame. Terrible cocktails - no discernible bite. No alcohol? Cool art on the ceiling outlining what happens to your liver when you're an alcoholic.

175,Melissa A.,"Austin, TX",149,192,38,5.0,12/6/2011,"I've on one too many occasions come here with friends,  have had one too many glasses of wine, and decided to draw pictures of things only we found funny with our crayons on our paper table cloth. Why not? They definitely encourage it.  Considering they provide you with the well made, yet cheap/ reasonably priced wine bottles, the full colorful crayons and the blank clean paper table cloth that just begs to be drawn on.I've had some great times here with my friends, and brought my bf here too. Its one of those places that can easily drift back and forth from being fun and carefree to romantic and comforting. Sassy to classy. The Ear Regulars play on Sundays. They're a great jazz band that really adds a nice touch to one of New York City's designated Landmarks, which might I add, is also supposedly haunted. Though I don't think I've ever come across any ghosts, though I might have just been too busy having a great time. Or maybe those old sailors/ Prohibition ghosts are just laughing alongside of me. I think everything here is priced very well. My bf and I went to town on this place one too many nights and still left with money in our pockets. The beer and wine selections are more then you could hope for and everything compliments their food selections, as well as the overall atmosphere of years of historical inspired greatness.This is one of those places that defines NY. Once you come here, you'll feel shame for ever stepping foot into one of those ""new"" over priced ""speakeasies"". This is one of the originals. A classic old beauty with history. The definition of what NYC is.",2,,2
176,Monica S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,3/9/2014,"I love this place. I live in the neighborhood and just starting coming here regularly last year. The food is very tasty, and the drinks just keep on flowing. The waitstaff is terrific; they often have to deal with large noisy groups of folks, but both customers and waitstaff are cheerful and respectful -- it's just a laid-back, yet energetic, noisy, friendly place.I do have to comment on ""Emily S.'s"" ""review"" of her experience last night at the Ear. I was sitting there with my friend, eating my dinner, and this group of perhaps 20 people came bombing in to the dining area. The waitstaff was trying to accommodate them, putting tables together, etc., but most of the group just kept milling about, and, frankly, d--king the staff around. They got more and more loud and belligerent, and, finally, one ""bro"" climbed up on a chair and started bellowing! When asked by the waitstaff to please sit down, he began to hurl verbal abuse at her. I was absolutely flabbergasted at the outrageous behavior that ""Emily S."" and her group exhibited. The Ear can be a noisy place, but the vibe is always sweet and gentle fun. These folks definitely came in tanked with an aggressively bad attitude. Everyone there breathed a sign of relief when they took the staff's suggestion and left.",1,1,1
177,Louis W.,"New York, NY",0,6,0,1.0,3/1/2015,"I really don't like to give bad reviews, but this was in all honesty one of the worst place I have ever been in NYC. Staff was rude and unwelcoming. Food was beyond average. And the place, although somewhat picturesque, was not well looked after. Bear in mind that if you get a table in the main dining area, you will be seating so close to the old dirty bathrooms that you will have a hard time finishing your plate. This was the first time ever in my life that I didn't leave a tip in a restaurant. Please avoid this place by all means.",,,

182,Keith F.,"New York, NY",2,16,0,5.0,1/24/2014,"One of my favorite bars in the city, and it doesn't hurt that it's 2 blocks from my place. Angela is the best bartender you'll encounter in life, so enjoy her company and tip her well. Mickey is fantastic, but a warning, if you intend to use your cell phone at the bar, he'll probably throw you through the wall, so leave it in your pocket, or better yet, at home.",1,,1

I only had drinks on my first visit but could've stayed for hours longer. The crowd was friendly and the food looked good! The drinks were reasonable and one bartender (Eric?) was so friendly and welcoming - I wanted to stay longer just to hang out with him!! A great, humble, comfortable, historic scene in a city that can feel stuffy and arrogant. Love! Will make it my new go-to spot for city drinks.",,,
184,New York D.,"Manhattan, NY",4,43,0,4.0,2/15/2014,"Built in 1817, the Ear Inn is arguably Manhattan's oldest pub (some say the second oldest). And nothing inside the pub has changed since -- check out the memorabilia, who needs a museum?The house was built for James Brown (not the one you're thinking of), a black man and aide to George Washington during the Revolution. After the war, he settled in New York and worked in the lucrative tobacco trade. He was successful enough to move to the suburbs near the village of Greenwich and build this fashionable Federal townhouse. In later years, it would become a Speakeasy during Prohibition and the upstairs apartment had been used as a boarding house, a smuggler's den, and a brothel -- interesting as no women were allowed in the bar! Ghosts have been heard and seen, in particular one ""Mickey,"" a sailor still waiting for his ship to come in.Since the end of Prohibition, the Ear Inn had no name and was only known to sailors as the 'green door', but in 1977 the new owners decided to avoid  lengthy reviews by the Landmark Commission over a new sign by simply painting out part of the existing neon BAR sign and alas, the 'Ear' was born.Today the Ear now sits in a designated Landmark of the City of New York and is on the National Register of Historic Buildings. So come here for a bit of history or for the unpretentious vibe that attracts locals and tourists. You'll most likely want to become an Ear-regular.",,2,1

Cloke then turned the place into a rough-and-tumble watering hole for Spring Street's longshoremen waiting for ships to dock. Charred and axe-marked timber discovered in the Ear Inn's attic has led some historians to believe the dwelling was constructed partly out of left-over lumber from the great fire of 1776, which wiped out one-third of the city.""",6,2,6

There are some cool benches outside where you have a nice people watching view (oddly enough there are plenty of people, even on this quiet little stretch of block). Inside, the decor is kind of nautical, looks really old, and somehow all fits together. It's casual and the people here around happy hour time on a Wed were a very eclectic mix - older blue collar guys, young city hipsters, a few cute girlies, some not so cute girlies. All in all, a good mix.The beers are the star ! Beer prices are cheap and the have plenty of taps. They even have their own tap, named after the bar, which Brooklyn Brewery makes for them based on an old recipes - it tastes a lot like tobacco.Definitely a nice place to come, grab a drink, and relax.",1,1,1

191,Finance G.,"Phoenix, AZ",40,8,10,5.0,10/22/2014,"There is a reason why, although it is a bit out of the way, the Ear Inn is always packed. The place is amazing! Amazing drinks (which are fairly priced), amazing food, amazing bartenders and amazing people!The Ear Inn is a real place with an eclectic crowd where people check their egos at the door. Do to the configuration you find yourself striking up conversations with people. People do not come to the Ear Inn to be ""seen"" as people do at many NYC establishments. People come to the Ear Inn to relax, have a good time and to hang with good people. Nobody is trying to show off and impress anyone. The food is outstanding. I have never had a bad meal at the Ear Inn. I usually get the burger or the shrimp and crab cakes. I also highly recommend the garlic shrimp appetizer which used to be a special but was so popular it was added to the regular menu.if you are looking for a non pretentious place to go where you can relax and have a great time and great meal the Ear Inn is the place for you.",,,

194,Liz C.,"Brooklyn, NY",643,600,3,5.0,1/25/2011,"Asian-style appetizers, coq au vin, nautical accent pieces, butcher-paper tablecloth and crayons - somehow, it all works. The pre-war tavern Ear Inn is one-part TGIFriday's, one part downtown dive, and chill as hell.  The portions are gigantic ($7 scored me probably 30 garlicky mussels), and the food itself is comforting, unextraordinary, and priced to please at $4 - $13. The beer (it's the kind of place where ordering a cocktail would be frowned upon) menu is smart and understated. Best of all, set on a fairly deserted stretch of SoHo, Ear Inn feels like a familiar, private hideout. It's not - the building has been designated a historic landmark, and has a couple hundred years' worth of apocryphal trivia, but on a frigid weekday night, it felt like somebody's waking dream of a faraway, storied home.",13,4,13
