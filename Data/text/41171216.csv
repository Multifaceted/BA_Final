I did not see any elevator access so I don't thinks it's wheelchair accessible. The place is very spacious there were many pool tables available when I came in on a Saturday night around 10 after 10 it picked up and got really busy but still some tables were available. They have happy hour until 8pm about 4$ beer The drinks when they are not on happy hour are about 7-8$ they have good music, drinks and food. The people come here in 2s or groups. They ask for I'd so just have that out when you're ready to pay so that lines can move fast. The rental of tables are $12 per person for the hour.  A bit much but I had a great time. The staff who are the bartenders are great and fast. The atmosphere is super chill they have about 3-4 arcade games here as well very old school. To play they hold your card and then you pay at the end. I love that they even had foosball great for a date or a nice catchup with a friend. They have also TVs available. If you're coming here by train the 4,5,6  will stop at 86th street and Lexington.HOURS ARE....M-Th 3pm-12amF-Sa 1pm-4amSu 1pm-2am",25,8,15

Cue's were in good condition and an abundant amount of chalk. Good selection of beer's available and cheap for happy hour, I think I was drinking Brooklyn Lagers for $4. A couple were frozen so if you like your beer cold they have their cooler on the lowest setting.They offer pizza; I didn't try it but, it was cheap and nice to have an easy option for food if you were here playing. Drop in for a clean place, friendly staff, and affordable drinks.",,,

3,Kevin G.,"Alexandria, VA",7,214,426,5.0,2/11/2018,Me and my son always come here to shoot pool when I am in town. It has many tables so the wait is rarely an issue. If you get a yelp coupon your price is reduced drastically. The clientele always varies from the just learning to the highly skilled out have some fun. If you're visiting the city it's open late so you can grab dinner and a show then top it off with some eight ball (the game not the drug).,1,,

6,Daisy C.,"New York, NY",34,136,336,2.0,7/2/2017,"Came here for a company's outing on a Friday afternoon. 20$ for all day pool play is a pretty good deal especially for a location in uptown. They also have happy hour till 8. The place is decent size with at least 10 pool tables, a ping pong table, a foosball table and some arcade machines. However it was super hot and humid in the place. There were only ceiling fans and it is not cooling or pulling more air into the room. There were only one bartender the whole afternoon so it took a while to get our drinks. They only have pizza here for food and you are not allowed to bring outside food. It was not a very pleasant experience. We were uncomfortable the whole time there. It was hot outside and inside, so we were sweating the whole time.",4,,2

8,Brian V.,"Coppell, TX",289,2,0,1.0,6/28/2018,The bartender was so rude to us! If Ford is working do not go. Otherwise this place is good but she refused to give us the $25 unlimited pool offer even after we asked for it and was very condescending saying that the price sheet at the door wasn't right and she has her own rules and prices. Afterwards I talked with the owner and he affirmed that she made a mistake and should have charged us the appropriate price.,,,
9,Marianne W.,"New York, NY",5000,1116,19810,3.0,3/15/2016,East Side Billiards has business since 1990. They just renewed their lease. Check Groupon for savings or Yelp. The best place in NYC for pool players. My friends from out of town are avid players. Nice to have this location on the Upper East Side.,33,15,28
10,Christine H.,"Manhattan, NY",535,295,292,3.0,4/5/2017,"Came here for billiards on a Saturday night. It has a nice vibe, although quite pricey. At $10/ hour per person, we ended up paying a total of $40 for 1 hours worth of play, which seems kind of ridiculous. The place is very lively and there will probably be a wait if you come on a weekend evening. Then wait is never that bad though, because they have a lot of tables. Although, because of the amount of tables it's VERY easy to bump into someone will playing pool and that can get pretty annoying. As second on the wait list, my group waited around 20-30 minutes. Because of the pay per hour system, my friends and I didn't have time to get drinks. However, the bar seems very lively and energizing and I will definitely go back for a drink next time. Overall, I don't think this is a bad place but it also doesn't really stand out at all. For the price, you're better off going elsewhere. Although, their bathrooms are pretty clean!",,1,1
11,Daniel K.,"New York, NY",20,3,0,2.0,8/11/2018,"Overall pretty old bar and pool tables. Went in on a Friday night and it was pretty empty. They wouldn't let us use the ""$10 for $20"" Yelp coupon because it was a Friday (apparently the coupon's only for Mon-Thu).",,,

14,Greg W.,"New York, NY",45,123,41,3.0,3/26/2018,Not sure what a fair rating would be. The double flight of steps is a bit much. Faded paint on the walls screams has been. Once inside your greeted by 16 good shape tables. A recently tiled wall adjourns the back part of the room. Considering only one exposure it seems bright and airy. You are not coming here for food just a some pool and fair priced drinks. Maybe late night when you are not that picky on food you can wash down a toaster oven pizza with affordable drinks,,,
15,Jonathan M.,"New York, NY",39,35,0,4.0,3/27/2018,"I've walked past this place so many times having been a born and raised New Yorker and had never had the chance to go into the establishment. It was also interesting to walk past as it's clearly a pool place but also a walk-up.  Recently having just been I can say I was pleasantly surprised and will most definitely will be coming back and bringing friends.  The place is large and well lit, nice vibe.  Lots of pool tables but also an area just for standing, sitting.  Besides pool tables, there's skee-ball, ping-pong, foosball!   Drinks were fairly priced and food was cheap!",,,
16,Leprince B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,1,1.0,7/22/2017,"I'm extremely dissatisfied and disgusted with the attitude from workers at this place. I came on a Saturday night with friends and family from out of town to experience such hideous behaviors from the bartenders who were really rude and racist towards me. While my friends played Pool, I chose to play ""Fuse ball"" with my cousins until I ran out of coins to play for the last time. I asked him for 4 quarters to play one last time due that I had nickels and dimes at a dollar estimate and the gentlemen looked at Me likeI was CRAZY ,and told me to go outside and look for change meanwhile they had Change in their register. He then said he would rather I break my $20 dollar bill for $1 for play time and he is too Good to take COINS. I WILL NEVER come nor Suggest anyone else who considers coming here. They only cater to WHITE PEOPLES NEEDS !!!Ps: I was approached aggressively because I was telling my friends the situation and other witnesses felt uncomfortable.",1,,
17,Joanna T.,"Queens, NY",12,81,1921,5.0,10/7/2016,"I came here on a Wednesday and the place wasn't packed but it wasn't empty either. My friends and I paid only $20 to play for the whole day! That's a lot of time considering the long hours they're open. That price includes ping pong and their other games also. We were allowed to go out to get food (ate and hung out at the food place, came back an hr or two later) and continued to play. Definitely would come back.",3,,
18,Shalequa L.,"New York, NY",28,55,60,3.0,8/19/2016,I was a little nervous about coming to this place because of some of the ratings but it's a pretty chill place. The place is not dirty like someone said. The price isn't that bad and they have atleast 15 pool tables in here. The music is up to date and I knew most of the songs that was playing. The drinks are pretty good; one lady told me my drinks were 8$ each but then the other guy over charged me at the end of the night (I had order the same drink twice) other than that.. one of the drinks had a little fly in it. But I realized before I drunk it and they apologized about it and gave me another one ( it wasn't free though :( I would recommend coming to play pool with friends,1,,
19,Elhadji S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,1.0,7/22/2017,"I wish yelp had an option to give them 0 stars because they were extremely racist! The minute my coworkers and I walked in, we were followed by the manager, which made us feel very uncomfortable. The bartender refused to give us change and told us that we would have to go and look for it. In this day and age all race whether black, white, orange or blue, everyone should be treated with the same level of respect. I highly suggest that you do not attend this place because they will not treat you  fairly if you are colored. We will never be attending this place again!!!",5,,
20,Katie K.,"Minneapolis, MN",3,17,5,1.0,9/2/2017,"The only good thing is that you can play pool and fooseball. The guy behind the bar is a total a-hole. So rude and gave us attitude anytime we went to the bar, when we asked politely if it would be possible to change the tv station he did NOT like it, he barked at us that we couldn't bring outside food in the moment we walked in (we stopped at a bakery before coming here and had it tied up in a box inside a plastic bag--we weren't looking to even eat it here!) and we explained what it was....definitely has a chip on his shoulder.",1,,

My partner and I went after work and we had fun. Granted it was quiet and there were maybe 12 pool tables everything still worked out fine. The drinks were okay, nothing to rave over. As far as the food I would recommend eating before or after you leave since they pretty much warm frozen pizza.",,,

25,Pau S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,0,1.0,2/25/2016,"Racist Staff Racist Staff and Racist Staff:I went here with coworkers for drinks. There were 2 white millennial bartenders. I ordered a Long Island and a white coworker came after me and asked for beer. She didn't know what type of beer she wanted. Instead of the male bartender serving my drink, the male bartender just dropped everything and provided the white coworker a sampling of their beers while I was standing there waiting! I was so dumbfounded. There was no acknowledgement of what was going on, the second bartender just looked and didn't even offer to take my order while the male attender pandered to my white coworker ! No apology whatsoever for making me wait. Because my coworkers were present, I felt tongue-tied and shocked by the overt racism, my mental reaction was significantly slowed! This is in Manhattan where overt racism is supposedly dead!!! How dare he? I am so exasperated. I can't even!  Instead of the owners reaching out to me to apologize or offer some sort of explanation or cause of action they've taken to further educate their staff, I was contacted and asked to take down my post. Seriously??   To all my people of color, if you want to be treated with dignity AVOID THIS PLACE",24,,1

We walked into no air conditioning and when I went to complain to the bartender about how my friends and I are sweating bullets, some guy next to me starts rudely meddling in our conversation. Annoyed, I ask him who he is and then he tells me he's the owner. And then he starts trying to make me feel guilty for complaining regarding the lack of A/C and the high prices given how uncomfortable it is in there! Then he goes up to my group of friends claiming he wants to apologize and in turn, blames the whole A/C experience on me, calling me rude and difficult! My friends told him off and we left. As we were walking out, the owner starts complaining to other customers in the pool hall about us! I mean, who is this guy? If you can't get your A/C fixed, don't open your business on a hot, muggy summer night! Don't blame your customers and tell them it is too expensive! Oh, please, you have a pool hall that charges big bucks in the middle of Manhattan...you have enough money to fix your A/C.

Updated review",Place has been renovated slightly. Staff now does rounds to pool tables to take and bring new drinks. Yelp and Groupon offers are not accepted on Friday and Saturday. Spent about $120 for 3 hours of pool and about 10 drinks. Could be a little cheaper for just bottled beer.,,,

Perfect.The bartender, Ryan, was great and fun to talk with. We were just visiting NYC and he had a lot of good information of different areas and food. They had a happy hour until 7PM which made for cheap drinking while watching the game.We ended up coming back later in our trip to play some pool and enjoyed that as well. They had plenty of sticks to choose from and it wasn't too expensive as 20$ for two people for the hour.",1,,1

39,Robert G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,1.0,3/13/2017,"I went here on a cold sunday night about 1130 pm after movie and food. It isnt a spot you want to go out of your way to trek to, but for a local pool hall, its ok. Good top shelf liquor, pool, ping pong, cool vibes, all good if youre in the area. I go there often and usually after few months or so , they hire a new front desk clerk. So we walk in with food from shake shack. He[David] fat, miserable , moron  sees we have bags, quotes us a price , takes my credit card, gives us a table and we start playing. I pull out my fries and my drink as i play. Ive come here numerous times, theyre no signs posted saying no outside food or drinks and if thats the case why not say so upon entering with my bags? Shmuck. So the guy is playing some oldies soft rock. Like wth? So i ask whats on the station.theres no jukebox btw. . He says pandora and its on the rolling stones station, i ask if he can change to drake station. Like who doesnt love drake right? So he does, he plays one song, and then changes it to some african, safari type ish ive never heard. Id swear i was watching hyenas being chased on national geo. Thats the vibe he had going. Anyway about 15 mins b4 the hour is up, he wants to say no  outside food or drinks allowed. After walking by me 3 times , you just noticed ,smh. Ok fine, i stopped consuming in between my game and asked if he served fries and what time he was closing. He said they serve pizza in a toaster oven , yuck. And he was closing soon, in about 30 mins. Not giving me enough time for another hour to play, so why should i order anything if youre closing .we pay , he keeps 2$ change without saying anything. So i asked is there tax ? He says with a rude tude no, but come on man you been eating the whole time . I said excuse me ,? So you want to charge a surcharge for bringing in food ,when asked, i stopped eating?. He goes on ranting and hesitantly gives 2$ back. I dont care about 2 bucks, however ASK , dont just take my $$ bc u want it. Anyway, he then asked us to leave bc i put him in his place and got loud. Yes u pissed me the hell off when u got a tude and tried to keep $ that wasnt yours . Its dishonest and just wrong. We were waiting for an uber and he continued to harass us to leave. We ignored him and continued to wait as it was very cold outside and you cant just throw us into the cold after we patronized your business. Shmuck winds up calling the cops . All bc of fries and being confronted and called out as a thief. Watch out for this guy. If hes taking 2$ , god knows how much more he maybe stealing. This guys a loser and ill never step foot in this place again. Its dirty, old, stains on carpet, but u want to bust balls about french fries. Smh.",2,,

Although I love this place for pool and a laid back environment the drinks SUCK! They always have!  Everytime I go back I'm praying that the drinks are better but they're worse! We got lucky last night playing on the ski ball machine we hit the 600 points and won unlimited pool for the night so all we paid for were the drinks which came out to $40. I was drinking vodka/cran (I think??? May as well have been cranberry with a splash of vodka) and I kept thinking if I wanted juice I would've went to the supermarket and gotten 10 gallons for that price. Anywho, I've learned that if I'm going to play pool here I have to pre-game with a couple of shots at home first. Other than that it's still a good pool spot on the east side.",2,3,1

Let's be honest, it's a pool hall, it's not sexy or sleek, but they have a full bar and the staff is friendly.  On those laid back nights when you just want to shoot pool with friends, this place can work. One tip though, if you have any mobility issues, you may want to check out another billiards. This is on the 2nd floor and I saw no elevator in sight. That's definitely a drawback.",,2,

I went weds so they charge $9 an hour $20 for all day play per person which is a great price. You walk up some stairs and you a bunch of pool tables. I also saw a skee ball machine ping pong table some video games. Looks like they have a full bar with some seating and they sell pizza (not the best so unkess you are starving skip it). Overall the place and tables are clean the price is right its a good place to play pool at. The music can be a little annoying but thats a minor thing.,,,
45,Mathias Charles U.,"New York, NY",142,82,12,2.0,9/7/2014,"We went here with a Groupon, and had been apprehensive per the reviews that have mentioned this company's gross misconduct with the handling of these Groupon redemptions, and that is why this place has two stars. This is more for pool players that are serious and play in leagues - it is not catered to what I would imagine as the ""average Yelper"" or fun-seeker for that matter. I can respect that, but the marketing of this place should be more clear, or better targeted.The bartender was nice, but this place lost two stars when we were told about restrictions on our Groupons that were not brought to our attention before or at the time of purchase. I'm not one to debate bad business practices with businesses anymore. Especially ones I don't care to frequently patronize; bad businesses will ultimately fail one way or another. This place will probably, still, go nowhere; they're here to stay, and I commend them for their business model, geared towards league-playing pools, but that does not give them the right to screw people on a Groupon. Albeit, I don't believe the majority of business on Groupon are out to screw people, but this can at least be chalked up to gross negligence with regard to the terms and conditions on the Groupon.That said, the pool tables were in near-spotless condition, and the bartender was a really chill guy. Beer is cheap, and they have some snack machines to grab quick munchies if your stomach starts grumbling. The place is seriously musty, and I would guess they could use to replace their HVAC unit, or at least clean it. The floors could use an overhaul as well - same with the bathrooms.",7,,

As soon as you walk in you're greeted with kind smiles and an inviting feel. I stoped on for a quick drink and a game of pool, but stayed for the conversation and atmosphere. They invite you in with an amazing welcoming smile that you won't get many other places around here. If you are looking for something more then a pool hall I would strongly advise you to come here especially if Ray & Courtney are running the shift. I would defiantly come back, but not only for the GREAT DRINKS AND AMAZING PRICES, but mainly because of the amazing staff, and great atmosphere. BOTTOM LINE IF YOU WANNA PLAY POOL, AND HAVE GREAT DRINKS AND A GREAT TIME COME TO EASTSIDE BILLIARDS ANDS NOT ANYWHERE ELSE!",,,
48,Mik G.,"Manhattan, NY",1,14,0,4.0,6/30/2014,"Arrived at 3 on a Monday when they should be open. Wasn't open and waited an hour. Still wasn't open at 4. No sign on the door and no one picks up the phone. I suggest calling before going. Took a star for that.Other than that, this place is fantastic. It's exactly what you expect out of a billiards hall. Forget food. Drinks are fine. But the tables here are great. They are routinely serviced and the balls they give you to play with are also top notch and high quality balls. The sticks they have for public use here are also routinely serviced and re-tipped. You don't see this kind of attention to detail in a lot of pool halls so it's nice to see that here. The tables are also very well spaced so you won't find yourself too cramped if there are other players around you.The service is good here. Matt, one of the bartenders, is extremely nice and helpful. The patrons here are generally relaxed and a lot of them are regulars who come to play on their own for practice. They also host a pool league here which is always fun if you're into that. You'll also find a skee-ball game here as well as a pingpong table which is free to play on.The only gripe I have is that they can take a while to turn the air on, so it can get hot and a bit muggy in there. I am honestly someone who gets hot even in a room at 75 degrees sometimes so maybe it's just me.Price. The price here is fantastic. Especially for solo play. 15 dollars for the ENTIRE DAY. We're talking from OPEN-CLOSE. Weekends however is 15 dollars from open to 8PM. Understandable. Location is fantastic. You can take the M86 bus to Lexington and you're right in front of the place. Subway too. 4-5-6 will leave you right here too. One other thing is the food. Not very good at all. I'd recommend hopping over to the Shake Shack across the street after you're done if you can hold it. I usually come here to play, not eat, so for me the food isn't an issue at all.I highly recommend this place for casual fun, but especially for people who want to practice alone. At opening time, there's usually no one there so you can go in, shoot around, relax, etc. It's my favorite pool place in the city and definitely the best one I've ever been to.",3,,1
49,Uno M.,"New York, NY",0,26,2,3.0,6/10/2016,"Have been coming here in the afternoons for a few months now and with a good clean up and more care of the equipment and this place would be first rate, as it is it's a solid place to play pool. There are 16 9 foot Gold Crown III's with 5,1/2 inch pockets in plenty of space, proper old school. They play nice even though some of them show the signs of some late night abuse In the form of stains from spilt drinks. Unfortunately whilst the tables play well the equipment is not in the best of condition. The Balls are Aramith pro cups but are badly scuffed and have miss matched cue balls, the house cues are beyond well used and the tables are, frankly filthy, after just an hour of play my hands are black with dirt. Having said all that I will keep on coming back, the bar tenders are cool, the rates are good and the atmosphere on the afternoons is friendly and encourages you to hang out. A good clean up and more care of the equipment and this place would be first rate, as it is it's a solution d place to play pool.",,,
50,Karen E.,"New York, NY",1,11,1,3.0,5/22/2016,"I liked this place because of how cheap it was (we used a Yelp deal) and because it opens early on the weekends.

53,Michael W.,"New York, NY",741,1014,236,4.0,9/2/2013,"I rarely come up to the Upper East Side, but when I do, I try and make the most of my trip. As they say, you always have to put in effort to maintain relationships with your friends. Anyhow, any occasion, if you're looking to take it down a notch and make you night laid back. then what better way than to play pool? Located right off the 4-5-6 train, this place is incredibly convenient if you don't want to walk too much from the train station. The second time I came here, my friend told me to purchase the Yelp deal that they have going on. At $20 for $44, this makes playing pool for a couple hours, incredibly cheap! During our Monday afternoon, Eastside Billiards charges $7 an hour, per person. Thus for a party of 3, we pretty much got 2 hours of play for $20. On Friday nights, the price is a little higher at about $9-$10 an hour, per person. Anyhow, on top of that, they do serve alcohol here. During happy hour, beers are $3, and they actually do have a pretty decent selection. As far as the pool hall is concerned, there are plenty of tables to go around, and I've never had to wait to get one. If pool isn't your thing, then they actually do have one ping pong table just randomly on the floor. The tables themselves are pretty well kept,  and the guys here are incredibly nice. Eastside Billiards is that type of place where you just want to hang out and get away from that typical frantic Friday night. Go with the Yelp deal when you come though, because it just makes everything that much cheaper and in result, better!",5,2,3

Once you walk up the flight of stairs, you see that this place is a pretty generic pool hall. They have a lot of tables and a small bar in the middle. They were supposed to be open until 4:00am but they actually announced last call and closed around midnight, so we had to rush. This place is nothing exceptional, but there are not many pool places in this neighborhood.",1,,
55,E M.,"San Francisco, CA",0,16,6,1.0,6/8/2016,"I had high hopes for this place since we live close by. A year or so ago, I brought my preteen boys and their friends here without incident. But when I took my son and his friend here again on a random weekday, it was not pleasant. The boys were well-behaved, and I was with them the entire time. About 20 mins into the game, we were asked to leave. When I inquired why, the manager wouldn't give a satisfactory answer. Manager offered to refund our money --as incentive for us to leave. That makes me think it wasn't something we did wrong.  Maybe the manager wants it to be an adults-only establishment? I just don't like a place that operates this way. (It's too bad because teen customers become adult customers in a few short years.)",2,,

Once you navigate the long narrow stairs up to it you enter a nice place to chill out and play some 8-ball.Decent amount of tables and a few video games. Great jukebox. $3 house shots every night and happy hour until 7. Nice bartenders. Use Yelp app check in to score a free beer! There are leagues that play here so check the schedule or you might be waiting a while for a table.Prices are not bad at $7.50 - $8.50 per hour depending on the time of day you play. There is even ping pong here. Can sometimes be a bit of a wait during prime time hours so you might have to get on the list for a table. Definitely a decent place to chill out for an hour or two, and have a few cold drinks while enjoying shooting some pool. Yeah, ok, so I like playing with balls! Stop snickering!",4,2,2
57,Alyson C.,"SOUTH OZONE PARK, NY",178,21,0,2.0,10/6/2013,"DO NOT BUY THE YELP VOUCHER UNTIL YOU READ THIS. Headed over here with a group of 8 for the first time on Friday. The place itself is nothing exciting, just your basic old pool hall. I don't particularly care what the place looks like tho if I have a good time. First signs I wasn't going to -- skeeball was broken (pretty much the main reason I chose this over the hundred other pool places we could've gone to). So we bought 2 Yelp vouchers since we were 8, and nowhere on the voucher does it say any restrictions about what to spend it on. When we go up to the owner/manager/idk what to redeem and sign up for tables, we're told that they NO LONGER HONOR that voucher, and that they ended that deal months ago but Yelp hasn't updated it.The new deal is that for $20 you can get 2 hours of pool for 2 people and a pizza. We're 8 people, who don't play pool particularly well and weren't hungry -- plus we bought a voucher that never said it had to be used a certain way. So after a few minutes of trying to reason with the man, his solution is that we can use one for the pizza/2 person deal, and one for pizza and soft drinks. Keep in mind we were a group of people between 22 and 25, we weren't really interested in redeeming $40 worth of soda and pizza, and ultimately, we want 8 people to be able to play. After more debate between the group, trying to reason with that man again, we decided to just bounce and write Yelp for a refund. Would I go back there again? If someone invited me, I wouldn't decline. But until I have a better experience, I wouldn't freely choose to go there. I do give them some benefit of the doubt because its not their fault, Yelp shouldn't have put us in that predicament by being too lazy to update the page, but frankly I've worked in F&B before and I never would have let a group of 8 people buying drinks walk out on an empty night (which, why was Friday empty?)So just be careful with the Yelp vouchers, people.",2,,1

Also, I made a shot my fiance claimed was ""physically impossible"" so I guess I'm not as bad as I thought.Regardless, the place was very nice. There were quite a few pool tables and some ping pong tables available. The beer selection was decent and they have a $3 beers for happy hour.

They took us off the list and the guy was really friendly/teasy about it and befriended my friend. We just drank and played Erotic Photo Hunt until everyone arrived. They had $3 well shots, which we took plenty of advantage of. Also, a yelp check-in scored me a free beer, which was nice.We were finally able to get a table (there was no longer a wait at this point), and we played for a few hours. We all took turns and there were no issues at all. Bartenders came around every once in a while to collect empty cups and take more drink orders while playing.Overall, I definitely had a great time here (though I suck at billiards). I'd definitely recommend this place for some nice low-key fun.",1,,
93,DEE S.,"New York, NY",13,60,0,5.0,12/22/2012,"I love this place. Obviously those who does not have any prior experience playing pool will complain about restroom, stairs and the other negative observation they make. this is a cheap, clean and less crowded gem. I have been here several times and I have enjoyed the service of the bartender and free ping pong.",2,,
94,Sadri B.,"White Plains, NY",5000,2243,478,4.0,10/16/2014,"Cool place how I never notice before is a mystery.Pool is a game I play when I get the mood for it and glad I did. First the stairs going in Is good exercise. I like the decor of place with the casual set up.  A bar to get your drinks on. Nice amount of pool tables ands sticks,all in decent shape,and well maintained by cool staff. Prices are not expensive, and crowd is not rowdy or undesirable type,just folks hanging out and having fun. A ping pong table made me just giddy(Love the game). A lot of regulars here as people love to talk, about daily stuff while shooting pool. I usually don't go to pool joints,but the relaxed causal ambiance makes it enjoyable. The jukebox playing all types of music, is cool. The staff are friendly and Do a great job.Very important thing I dig is dress and conduct code, if trouble and dressing like a gang member or slutty is your norm,well not here pal.Nice couches and retro chairs to relax and watch the games on Tv's set up around place. Listen if you want to have a fun leisure time after work or dinner or whatever,come here it's fun, I know I did.",3,,

Also, the music selection is amazing, and if you want it louder, I can happen easily Pool s such a great winter sport, but the A/C is great in this place, so I look forward to playing this summer.",,,
97,Rebekkah K.,"Manhattan, NY",54,145,9,5.0,1/18/2013,"I had so much fun here after just stumbling across it with a friend on a walk through the UES to the train. Happy hour specials were wonderful (15/person for unlimited time, 3 dollar beers) and they have a great selection of drinks too. The tables were in great condition and the crowd was good. Service was memorable as she was super friendly and helpful. As for the music, well it was perfect for playing pool, indie-pop, classic rock, 90s pop, motown, they mix it up and it is never wrong. Definitely a good place to go with an out of town friend, a date, or a pregame before going to a bar or concert. I can't wait to go back!",1,,
98,Meg S.,"Rye, NY",6,11,0,5.0,4/1/2011,"Great spot!!! Gold star for Eastside Billiards. Uptown address with a downtown vibe; easily the UES's best kept secret though it should be on everyone's radar above 69th St.  Eastside Billiards is a low fuss, chill bar and pool hall that you can go to with a couple of girlfriends or on a date. I've been to Eastside about once a week over the past few months and I always have a great time. The bartenders make fantastic drinks and most of them are pool pros, so they make you feel comfortable and if you want to play they will set you up. Eastside is a great place to hang out at even if you don't play pool and has a big bar, and room for large groups so it would be a perfect spot for a birthday party or even work event.If you like drinks, pool and love music (amazing jukebox - GNR to Muse to Grace Potter) - this should be your uptown destination.",1,,
99,Kristin B.,"Westwood, NJ",123,204,6,2.0,9/2/2010,"Eh.  Long, challenging flight of steps to walk up after a long day's work/walk down after I've drowned my Working Girl (Melanie Griffith, not Julia Roberts people, get your minds out of the gutter!) sorrows in some crappy drinks (I asked for a skinny girl margarita and the bartender had no idea what I was ordering and when I told him how to make it he nodded at me like *I* was an idiot and then served me the wrong thing.  Oh, and he used orange juice instead of orange liqueur.).On the bright side there ARE a lot of pool tables.  On the downside, if you go too early (happy hour-ish) there are children there.  On the bright side the mini-pizza we ordered was decent.  On the downside, the clientele was kind of shady ::Cue doing that hand motion thing where you pretend to be a scale and weigh the pros and cons with your hands while making the ""I'm not sure face"":: FYI, Thursday is Ladies Night - I forget the deal specifically but I believe us girls play pool for $5 all night long.",1,2,1
100,Bobby C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",99,276,115,3.0,7/20/2010,"Ahh, I used to come here as a pre-highschool kid to hone my making out and cigarette ring blowing skills. They happen to have pool tables as well. The decor of this place is like kryptonite to attractive girls. The straight-as-an-arrow ""interior decorator"" decided to paint the walls prison-grey, and hang up some neon beer signs along with a couple of mirrors. The footlocker downstairs is a slightly more romantic place to take a date. As far as the pool tables go, they are average. They're not kept in immaculate shape, but they're also not the worst I've seen. Since you never feel like you're voluntarily here when you are here, I'd expect prices to be pretty low but at the same time, it is the upper east side so they're not. There are much better options for pool, namely Amsterdam cross town on the west side or Amsterdam downtown on the east side. I'd only go here if... Actually, I can't think of a good reason to ever go here. I mean, the subway and crosstown buses are RIGHT there. Just get a metrocard and go somewhere else. Stop being so lazy. Man, I feel bad writing such a terrible review, but it's true. There's no reason to play pool here, unless you really don't play pool much and you don't mind being in a prison like environment and you don't wanna go anywhere else.",2,1,1

The place is huge, they have many tables that are kept nice and neat and clean. Their cue sticks are in good condition and the staff is friggen awesome!! Love Alison, she's so cool, lol. Anyways, they play the games on I believe four televisions, they have a bar (though I've never ordered anything there), they have leagues... it's just a cool place to go and hang out!! Just an FYI though, to get in, you have to climb a long flight of stairs. Great place, check it out! Oh, price! They offer unlimited play for $15 daily, but on Fridays and Saturdays, unlimited play is from 1-8pm. At least I believe that's correct... I only go on Sundays really, lol. :-D",2,2,1
102,Aaron S.,"New York, NY",1,17,2,3.0,2/4/2010,"A relatively easy place to get to, I went with four other guys and we had a pretty good time playing pool and drinking some beers. The place had a bit of a weird smell, and some of the other customers were a bit rude, but aside from that it was fine. We went on a Wednesday night. There were $3 beers that brought us in, and the pool wasn't too expensive either. Don't be fooled though - there's a jukebox on the wall, but the bartender is only allowed to play a Lady Gaga heavy mix tape.",4,2,1

The drinks, I've never really tried. They also have darts available. It's about $7 before 6pm and I think $9 afterwards. Very reasonable. I'll be back here again. Make sure to have an ID or card available to hold your table. Also, $15 for the whole day at a table = winning",,,

105,Katie L.,"Manhattan, NY",6,43,149,5.0,11/3/2012,"I love this place. We usually go to Fat Cats downtown to play pool but after the last few times of overcrowding and random drunk kids all over the place jostling for space and spilling beers we decided not to go back. (plus there was a 2hr wait for a pool table). We then we went here to Eastside Billards. It's a bit far for me to get here from the west side but omg its BIG, and FULL of pool tables. I know people complain about how close these tables are to each other, but i've seen much closer elsewhere and I thought it was well spaced. The service was great! A waitress made rounds, taking drink or food orders and delivering them to your pool table. The manager was friendly and polite. The lighting was perfect, not too dim like a bar/pub or too bright. The people here were here for one thing, to play pool. Not pretend to play pool while making out and being half drunk. They have SO many pool tables here, which i have no clue how they got up in this area as the only way up is a tiny narrow long staircase. They also have a great Thursday Ladies night special from 8pm to midnight. I will def be coming back here often!",,,

Updated review","Even with the upgrades, the club falls short of being a hot spot. The place seems always dead. Drinks prices are great, but one might think they just add the extra costs to the table cost. Two hours of pool with four rounds of magic Hats cost me and my buddies $120. Ridiculous, I wo't hit this place up again until they lower prices. News Flash the Economy sucks.",4,1,2
109,Rubie R.,"Chicago, IL",27,98,0,5.0,5/15/2009,"This place is the shhhhh!I'm not at liberty to say why because otherwise I'd have to dispose of you.  I'm kinda glad it's gotten such mediocre reviews.  That is, I'm a greedy em effer and wanna hog this place for myself.  There.  I've performed my Yelp duty.  Now scramble like eggs and break fast.  I bet not catch ya nosy self 'round these parts.",1,5,1
110,Brooke R.,"Bay Area, CA",538,979,33,3.0,10/18/2008,"This place is in walking distance from my friend's boyfriend's apartment, so we came here a lot when they were together.  There are 18 tables and then a loungey area and a bar.  I love bars and am happy whenever I find them at unexpected places.This place is upstairs and the front door is downstairs.  No elevator, you have to walk up a flight of stairs.  So don't get too drunk at the bar because getting back outside takes some thinking and balance.The loungey area has leather couches and a big screen tv.I've always had to wait to get a table.  You're allowed to reserve tables and people that come here are typically wealthy enough to afford a few hours.  So all that equals a wait.The pool tables and cues are kept in good condition, although my friend always brought her own stick with her.  I was forced to use the sticks provided, but that's ok because I still was better than her :)Nothing about this place is spectacular but there's nothing wrong with it either.",14,12,15

I love Paul Newman! After watching that flick I had a fantasy that I would become some kind of hustler. Unfortunately my skill level doesn't match my bravado so that will very likely not come to be.  And I also don't want to get my hands smashed......watch the movie and you will understand where I am coming from). I guess I will just have to stick to being an amateur for the time being (ie, forever).  I satisfied my amateurish game play by going to Eastside Billiards recently.  This billiards hall seems kind of pricey in comparison to other pool halls but it's still worth going.  It's pretty basic, looks like a pool hall in Queens or Brooklyn-not the most attractive.  During happy hour beers are only $3 and their tv dinner pizza wasn't too bad.  The bartender was friendly.",,,
118,Trevor H.,"New York, NY",71,86,7,5.0,6/26/2009,"This place is an Oasis on the Upper East Side for people that like to shoot pool in a relaxed atmosphere that do not want to break the bank.The tables and equipment are in ecellent condition and are obviously well cared for, which is a huge plus for those of us who can sometimes a little bit too competitve when bashing balls around a table.The pool rates are not bad, they are competitive with other quality pool halls in the city and have rarely changed over time.They have also have a nice lounge area, with a projector screen, which is great if you want to watch the game in comfort.The real plus wih this place though is the happy hour. They have good drink prices anyway, but during happy hour you can get imports for as little as $2.50! Where else could you pick up a Heineken that cheap?At a time when pool halls all over the city are either closing or hurting financially Eastside has kept their act together and not hurt their patrons in the pocket.
