0,Jeannette L.,"Jersey City, NJ",1436,781,2455,5.0,5/16/2018,"Flower Section Review Only:I stopped inside this farmers market recently to purchase a fresh, flower bouquet for a colleague. I wouldn't have time to pick it up for her in the morning, so I bought the flowers after work the night before. I was worried about it, but the woman who runs the flower shop inside helped me out big time. She was friendly and told me exactly how to store and preserve them. She also wrapped them in a way that was easy for me to carry them out and travel with them. The selection of the flowers was much nicer than I expected going into the farmers market cold (didn't check out Yelp or anything ahead of time). As in other farmers markets, very good prices on fresh flowers. If I can, I'll opt to buy flowers at a market and then wrap them on my own (way to make it more personal). I'll definitely be back in the future.",17,11,19
1,Sussanna G.,"Nutley, NJ",204,35,97,4.0,8/14/2018,"Great prices, but avoid at all costs on the weekend as it's super busy and lines will be entirely too long. Best days to come are probably Monday and Tuesday. There isn't a huge variety of produce, but you'll be happy with what they have available. Cash, credit, and apply pay accepted.",,,
2,Annabelle L.,"Woodbridge Township, NJ",498,552,887,4.0,5/21/2018,"A hidden gem located behind a shopping center (right behind the fitness gym).  I only happen to know there's a farmers market because my coworker told me how to get here.This place has all the fruits and veggies for a very affordable price.  Strawberries for 89 cents a pound, blackberries for 2 for $2.  Bell peppers for 79 or 89 cents a pound depending on the colored peppers, etc. and more.  I love the Portuguese bread rolls of 4 for $1.  I purchased 4 bags filled of produce that totaled $10 bucks when I know if I'd gone to my local supermarket, I would have paid close to $25.  The place also has a nice selection of flowers and plants for sale.I wished I'd live closer to the area but definitely will stop by again to shop should I be near the area.  The parking here is a bit small and that's only because the market itself is small.  You can't really get through the isle without bumping another shopper's cart.  You're better off carrying a basket and shop.",11,3,9
3,Elysa O.,"Bloomfield, NJ",59,88,326,5.0,12/4/2017,Best farmers market in town. They are hidden behind the Retro Fitness on Franklin ave. Never really crowded. Always parking. The produce is always fresh at a great price. The ladies who check you out are super quick so I suggest to not pile your groceries on the counter to make sure you dont get charged twice. I stopped buying produce at shop rite after discovering this place a few years back.,2,,1
4,Chris L.,"Paterson, NJ",116,1102,971,4.0,10/9/2017,"This place is behind the retro fitness. This place is a gem as there isn't a place that can offer fresh fruits and veggies at such an affordable price nearby that I know of. I often come here to pick up a few items not a full shopping haul. I'm amazed at how cheap some of the fruits are. 69 cents a pound for plums is insane to me. I can get 2 pounds of plums for under $2. That's a lot of poop. I mean plums....They sell at least four different types apple but not honey crisp. They have white peaches but they are smaller than Hmarts. But who cares.Don't expect the fruits to be arranged in a nice pyramid or be advertised as organic.This is a mom and pop shop that is providing nutrient rich produce to the community. The same stores conglomerates are pushing out. They also sell rolls, olives, cured meats like sealed chorizo, and milk. Stuff I would avoid because I don't want to be  300 pounds. I'd be set if they sold entenmann's pound cake. They accept cc but I didn't try using their bathroom. I go to Wendy's instead.",1,1,1
5,Kathleen M.,"Newark, NJ",25,15,0,3.0,8/11/2018,Their produce is very good and the price is wonderful. I've given them three stars because of the obnoxious disposition of the cashiers. One of them insisted I handed every item to her. She wouldn't reach into the basket I had placed right on the counter before her. I didn't go there for months because of that. Today I went and the lady couldn't be bothered to say hello or goodbye.,,,
6,Melissa V.,"Rego Park, Queens, NY",155,70,197,4.0,5/21/2017,This is my go to for a huge variety of fruits and vegetable at a reasonable price. I love coming here and finding new things for my taste buds or experimenting with new foods to cook with!! You can't find prices like this anywhere to bad it's not organic fruits and veggies.,1,,
7,Tarah M.,"Irvington, NJ",204,34,93,4.0,12/8/2016,"Let me just say, for price and location you get what you get. Meaning: don't expect anything super special. So 4 stars because for the size of this garden fresh they still had a good variety. Someone was complaining about the parking lot here...be real, it's a shopping center with fast food places, BOA, a gym, etc. so the frustrations of parking is average. The prices were really good, I bought a ton of produce and cheeses and spent about $25. I will say they can clean in there a bit better than they do, but like I said for the price and location don't expect anything special. All my produce was fresh and really good, I bought 4 different varieties of mushrooms and I was uber happy!! If you want a better and bigger garden fresh try the one in Edison. This place in Belleville is fine for when you just got off work and need to grab a few things quickly.",,,
8,Fred L.,"Kearny, NJ",589,251,1250,3.0,6/4/2015,"Tired of giving your hard earned dollars to shop rite, path mark, A&P and Stop & Shop?????COME HERE for your fruits and veggies. The prices are amazing. The selection is good and the lines move fast. It's hidden behind retro fitness and Wendy's with tons of parking. It's not organic or a farmer market, but you will be pleased with groceries.I normally pick up scallions, peppers, cilantro, red onions, seedless cucumbers, apples, grapes, oranges, limes, lemons, shallots, banana.... The list goes on y'all. I think you know I'll return and I hope you enjoy your visit here as well.",3,1,2
9,PV D.,"Belleville, NJ",3,77,31,5.0,4/11/2016,"What a hidden gem in my neighborhood. We live nearby and come here at least twice per week for fresh fruits and veggies.Did I say fresh and SWEET Fruits? Of course you have to know how to pick them but you can always count on freshness. My favorite is the gala apples and pears. They're always 99cents per lb which is a lot cheaper than local big chain supermarket or even neighboring farm markets. I'm not fan of grapes but I had the sweetest grapes ever here. Sweet is in getting my glucose level to all time high and they were only 79cents/lbs! As you can tell, The cherry on the cake is the small price tag. We're big fruit eaters and everywhere we go, we cannot find more competitive price. It's on average half the cost of big supermarkets!!!",2,1,
10,Elizabeth M.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,18,0,4.0,4/28/2017,"The prices are unbeatable, and there are many nice surprises (though one cannot be certain what will be in stock from week to week.) One can come out with three bags of produce for $10 - and there are a few bonuses, such as a full stock of calorie-free Walden Farms items and large containers of spices.",,,
11,Jennifer M.,"Montclair, NJ",787,835,3585,5.0,1/22/2013,"This place is just excellent beyond words. The prices here are ridiculously cheap. How cheap?Chayote = 3 for $1Plantains= 2 for $0.79Strawberries= $0.99 for a quart sizeOkra= $2.99 for a packSpinach=$0.99 for a bag(prices based upon my 1/21/2013 visit)Local restaurant owners come in here too, with carts FULL of produce. So you know this is the place to go!Granted yes, the produce is not organic, but you if you're really looking to save on cash this place is a godsend! Don't get picky now. It's cheap for a reason. It's your typical produce from the supermarket. This is not a real REAL Farmer's Market. Fresh produce in January means you're definitely not getting the local stuff. So during the winter season you'll see a lot produce stickers say ""Product of Chile"" and such. What can you do (beside eat stuff in season).  But I'm sure it's different come the spring and summer. As the cycle goes...Credit card minimum is $3.00",6,,1
12,Mucio L.,"Bloomfield, NJ",199,51,181,4.0,7/31/2014,"So excited to find this awesome farmer market close to home.  The prices are about 20-45% cheaper than the local supermarkets.  It's not a huge place but they have a little of everything.  Very clean and nicely organized.  It is a little hidden, so park in the back of Wendy and you can't miss it.",6,4,4
13,Micheka G.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,10,0,5.0,5/21/2016,Best prices in town I would drive all the way on route 10 to get to a farmers market but not anymore. I didnt know it existed before.My go to place for fresh produce and affordable pricing.,,,
14,Praba B.,"Philadelphia, PA",208,63,5,4.0,8/26/2014,"This place is WACK. And I mean that in the best way possible. I don't think I've been to a farmer's market anywhere with prices as insanely low as this place. How do they even make a profit?! It's MAGIC~Here's some of the ridiculous bargains I've gotten from this place (the prices change day to day, so you'll have to see for yourself what's in store when you get there):Strawberries - $0.99 per cartonBlueberries - $0.99 per cartonLimes - 10 for $1Pomegranates - 5 for $2 (UH WHAT??!??!)Peaches - $0.99 per poundCilantro - $0.79 for an enormous bunchFor a poor fruit addict such as myself, this place is paradise. Never AGAIN will I try to buy my produce from a grocery store. However, I should mention that there is one drawback--the produce isn't necessarily always as squeaky clean as the grocery stores. And also, you should probably plan to use the produce within 3 days of purchasing it. This isn't really an issue for me, because this place is right next to the gym I go to and I'm able to shop 2 times a week. As for crowds, it's hit or miss. There are some times when the lines are so long that I contemplate putting back the ridiculously bargain-priced produce I had, but other times half of the registers are free. Oh well--the prices alone are enough to keep me coming back to this place as long as I live in the area!",2,1,
15,Jennifer M.,"Newark, NJ",1,10,0,3.0,8/18/2013,"I go to this farmer's market very often. Usually twice a week. I have always been a fan until today.This is not an organic or farm fresh farmers market. It is usually very busy so you will have to deal with a crowd, however, the deals are unbeatable. There are always deals and bargains for things that can get very expensive at your regular  grocery store.I am not usually one to complain and even less often return an item however I bought strawberries on Monday night. When I went to eat them Tuesday afternoon they were molded and rotten. Within 24 hours they had gone bad. And I 2 cartons. I took them back to return them because they were 2.99 each and inedible. The cashier tried to help but could not make a final decision. She called the manager and he told me I would have to pay a dollar each to get new ones. After I offered my receipt from less than 24 hours before and said I did not want my money back just an even exchange. He told me he would have to check the camera and to wait. 15 minutes later I was still waiting and just decided to leave. It was not worth my time for 6 bucks. Seriously considering whether I will return because of the unfortunate customer service. If an owner or manager is willing to fight with a loyal customer over a six dollar purchase they are not a business I like to support.",7,,
16,Jessamyn N.,"Bloomfield, NJ",390,19,45,5.0,8/3/2015,"My go-to market for produce! 99% chance it's cheaper than your local supermarket. It is on the smaller side but it's manageable. Great selection at all times. Like with any farmers market, items vary from time to time. They have a great baked good selection (rolls, pitas, bread, etc.) as well bulk food",1,1,1
17,Becca F.,"Bloomfield, NJ",32,32,34,4.0,5/31/2015,This place has everything I need with superb prices. I never shop for fruits or veggies in the super market any more but come here every week.,,,
18,Karla G.,"Newark, NJ",0,2,0,4.0,3/9/2016,"Listen!!!!I went to this place!!! Wow!!!..This place makes you go nuts...I was literally a Kid in a Candy Store!! I'm a comparison shopper, and this place is the Bestest (in my bad English tongue)Place Ever... My niece was with me and she enjoyed helping me because I can't see well; and she also commented  about the prices too.... I even had a little joke with my Dad; he asked me what were the oranges? He said they were small like tangerines, but the moment  he cut them there was so much juice coming from them it was Fantastic!!!! Yes Kudos to this Farmer's Market!!!i",,,
19,Jo R.,"Windsor, CT",2,15,1,4.0,1/28/2015,"This place is great! I can't believe I've lived in this area for this long and just found out about it. Prices are great. I've gotten strawberries for $0.99, blackberries for $0.99 and things like zucchini, limes, oranges and cilantro (huge bunches) are always at a cheaper price than grocery stores. It gets packed on Sunday afternoons, beware, but I get almost all of my produce from here.",,,
20,Luis L.,"Belleville, NJ",4,1,0,4.0,2/1/2014,"It was great, pretty cheap to. Ive past by it multiple times never gone in until I was looking for a farmers market on here.",1,,
21,Richard F.,"Belleville, NJ",2,37,0,4.0,2/21/2015,"I can't believe that one of the best farmers markets I know is right in my own back yard! I have been shopping at garden farmers market for about 20 years. I have seen it go through many permutations during that time frame including it once had a full service deli counter that was meh, Then this area became a small fresh seafood counter, again... meh, but I used it in a pinch. Anyway, a few years back the seafood section was removed and I thought O boy, this is probably a sign that this place is nearing closure. Since then the owners put a self serve olive and mozz cheese bar and added refrigeration to sell sausage and other fresh goodies that need to be kept cool. This latest move is proving to be a good move as business has never been better here!Years ago I was on the hunt for other farm markets because Garden is smaller than most and had some days when their produce just didn't look that good and then some days when it looked acceptable. Now there are days when it looks good and other days when it looks amazing! Unfortunately people noticed which means crowds and lines, but hey that is a good thing because it means good turn over, and the lines do move! As others have stated the bargains here are the real draw. They have always been cheap and I buy my produce here to stretch my budget after shopping at the local supermarket. Now with the added benefit of high turnover and great quality, this place really is a no-brainer! But please....Shhhhhhh! Anyway, Garden gets 5 stars for cheap produce, but minus one star for poor location with shabby parking lot in back of walgreens and Retro Fitness which makes for crowded parking and inconvenience.",1,,
22,Matt L.,"Boston, MA",0,5,7,5.0,8/4/2012,"Best stop for produce in the area. Prices are the lowest you'll find nearby (save for the occasional loss leader at the major chains) for fruits and vegetables without sacrificing quality. This store is part of a group of several other farmers markets (njfarmersmarketgroup.com…). The location is somewhat hard to find. It's part of a shopping complex, and you have to drive around the corner near Wendy's to find it. It is clearly marked with a big yellow sign.",2,,
23,P R.,"Nutley, NJ",0,12,0,1.0,5/5/2014,"This store claims to open at 8 a.m., which it does.  However, they are not prepared in the least for customers.  I was in there at 8:30 a.m. today, Monday, 5/5/14.  First I headed to their fresh breads and rolls, and there were...none.  I asked the fellow when bread usually arrives and he said around 10-10:30 a.m. Excuse me?  You open at 8 a.m. with no deliveries in sight.  Headed over for those gorgeous fresh strawberries and there were...none.  Just a big old empty pallet.  I asked him when they were going to unload the fresh strawberries and he said sometime after 10 a.m.  We're doing good here.  So let me go get some cabbage and there were about 7 heads of rotting brown cabbage left over from last week.  So from my total list of fresh veggies and fruits I was only able to get a package of celery and a package of carrots.  Although the help is pleasant enough, they are totally disinterested in their customers and basically when you ask any kind of question you get a huh.  So the rules are...never go to the Garden Farmers Market in Belleville, NJ until sometime after 10:30 a.m.  Ended up driving over to the Nutley ShopRite for some beautiful fresh produce.",2,3,
