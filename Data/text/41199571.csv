As it was a later stop in our night, I just stuck to a couple of beers. I was a little wary looking at the oyster bar just sitting out there in the bar, but if that's how it works for them and no one has gotten sick... well okay then.The music was good, bartenders were quick and attentive. There are two bathrooms in the back and they are only lit by candle, so very dark. Kept hearing good thing about the food from other patrons so I would love to come back and get a bite",3,,3
1,Holly M.,"New York, NY",41,105,175,4.0,11/16/2018,"Cute location, decent food, but really, the live jazz music (with no cover charge) and ambience are what make this place so cozy and perfect. The drinks were moderatly strong and unqiue. I would definitely go back!",1,,1
2,Frank W.,"New York, NY",217,104,69,5.0,4/15/2018,"Bar Belly is tucked away deep in Lower East Side on the border of Chinatown. It's a good thing it's so far from mainstream neighborhoods otherwise it would be overrun with patrons seeking a quality drink. Bar Belly should be considered a hidden secret given it checks all the boxes of an excellent cocktail bar: great vibe, good eats, live music (depending on the night), and of course top shelf cocktails. Bar Belly attracts a sophisticated crowd seeking a trendy pre-dinner drink. Given it's located directly across the street from the Fat Raddish and within one block of Kiki's, they're attract plenty of people looking for a quick drink while waiting on a table. The mixologists are able to whip-up a variety of cocktails tailored to your personal preferences. I thoroughly enjoyed my 'dusty martini' that was specially prepared.Be sure to check out the infamous and mythical Jackalope, the featured symbol of Bar Belly prominently hung on the wall for all to see.",,,1
3,Samantha E.,"San Francisco, CA",4,82,138,5.0,7/27/2018,"New favorite happy hour spot! I organized a happy hour meet up at Bar Belly for a group of ocean professionals and everyone loved it! First of all, for those who are eco-minded, not that this place is straw-free/plastic-free! They also have a partnership with the Billion Oyster Project, a nonprofit group that is working to bring oysters back to NYC's waters. Second, staff are excellent. Tommy was very helpful in planning our happy hour and we will be back. Third, excellent cocktails for $8 at happy hour! There was a special event the night we were there, so drinks came with free tacos. There was addicting free popcorn as well. Stylish and cozy space. Young and hip crowd. Highly recommended.",,,
4,Luci B.,"Queens, NY",124,1306,2648,4.0,2/15/2018,"Not sure what Lead Belly was like before, but now it's Bar Belly. I came here for Fat Tuesday, they had a New Orleans jazz band playing for Mardi Gras. They also had oysters: Kumamoto, Bar Cat, Wellfleet. Plus free spiced popcorn. It's really hard to make me unhappy in that sort of environment. Decor is quaint, a little rustic, clean and white, maybe a little Williamsburg. Great for dates. Service was extremely friendly. The food menu was very overpriced so we skipped it ($17 for 5 shrimp, for example), but did sound good.They play music a lot, with lots of jazz apparently, so there's a good chance I'll be back!",1,,
5,Lady N.,"San Francisco, CA",138,41,0,5.0,8/11/2018,"This place has it all! Drinks, food, crowd...even live music. Amazing cocktails and delicious food- they even bring popcorn on the house if you have table service. It's one of those nyc bars that passes the test of time. Definitely a great weekday date night spot and fun for wild times on the weekend.",,,
6,Sara S.,"Los Angeles, CA",230,292,125,4.0,3/27/2018,"This place has awesome cocktails and food! Great vibes, very chill and not pretentious. Good for groups and celebrations. Expensive, it's NY. Decent service.",,,
7,Lauren L.,"Union, NJ",3,26,26,5.0,7/18/2018,"My husband and I stopped in here before heading to a show around the corner. We were pleasantly surprised by the chill vibe, it almost felt as if we'd gone back in time a bit. They had live music, which was a nice added touch. We each ordered a drink - I had the Young Mula and he the Darkest Stormy. Both were super enjoyable and refreshing. We also ordered the lamb sliders, and while small, they were full of flavor. Before we left I ordered another drink and they didn't have the right ingredients to make it, however, the bartenders were really nice and made my husband and me a small cocktail on the house.",,,1
8,Cristina M.,"New York, NY",3,25,14,5.0,9/29/2018,"We were there last night after dinner in Baccaro and let me tell you...what a GEM this place is! Great looking people, fun crowd, superb drinks and 2 fantastic women DJ that made us dance until 2:30am!! The fact that there is a secret box with costumes and that they gave us some really cool branded hats from the bar, made it all even better. Also, their bouncer is one of the nicest and cutest in NY. Thanks for a great night guys!! We will be back!!",,,
9,Crystal R.,"Great Neck, NY",0,7,0,5.0,9/8/2018,Been here 3 times and I thoroughly enjoy it. Creative cocktails and brunch food is delicious. Also always have live music.,,,
10,Geraldine J.,"Manhattan, NY",3,7,4,5.0,9/8/2018,"Absolute gem in the LES with live jazz Thursday, Friday & Saturday nights. Bar Belly has a delightful staff with excellent service and the owner is warm and welcoming. The cocktails were delicious and I think every aspect of Bar Belly is on point. Highly recommend.",,,
11,Joe U.,"San Francisco, CA",57,14,54,4.0,6/17/2018,"Chill spot with great Happy Hour! M-F 5-7pm $1 oysters and $8 cocktails, $8 glasses of wine and $4 beer. The oysters were delicious, fresh, briny with little to no grit. They're served with a mignonette, horseradish and lemon. The Mojito was crisp, refreshing and not too sweet. The bar has a very classy, laid back vibe to it. The decor feels like you're at a local beachside bar in Southern California. Dozens of small candles are peppered all throughout the white wooden walls. The night I was there they had 2 gentleman playing guitar that reminded me of strolling through Paris. Quite nice! I tried the lamb meatballs which were a bit bland and under whelming but everything else about this place was on point!",,,
12,Sara W.,"Dorset, VT",206,6,0,5.0,8/16/2018,"I LOVE this bar. It was one of the first that I went to when I moved to New York and it has held its place as a favorite. Awesome happy hour, great live music & DJs, and a welcoming atmosphere. The bar itself is standalone but Tommy (owner) is the man, for lack of a better word. The cool uncle you've always wanted (I have a cool uncle, but'ye get it)",,,
13,Rashad T.,"Brooklyn, NY",417,12,6,5.0,8/15/2018,"Bar Belly is one of my favorite bar/restaurants in New York City. Deep Lower East/China town vibes. Great music even live Wednesday through Saturday. Great place for date night, after work friends, or just catching up over happy hour. The staff is fun, professional and the owner is a true gentlemen. I had the pleasure of dining and filming in the great establishment. Do yourself a favor grabs some delicious oysters, jam to the music and toss back a drink or two.",,,
14,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",537,500,333,5.0,1/31/2017,"Came here last Friday night with a friend who is a local and both of us were impressed with the vibe, the crowd, the drinks, the oysters and the food. This is definitely a great place for Happy Hour with $1.50 oysters and $10 cocktails and mixed drinks.No tourists, mostly locals and young professionals, no teenagers or creepy 50-something divorcees, there was a great live band and then afterwards  the DJ started playing old-school dance and R&B. Even if it is a small space, people were dancing it up anyway.The oysters were perfect, briny and plump. I ordered the fries made in duck fat (amazing and something you don't often see on this side of the pond) and the cocktails were also generous and yummy.Also since last Friday was Chinese New Year, a Chinese luck dragon even made an appearance.",5,,1
15,Jenni-Claire J.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",211,11,0,5.0,6/10/2018,A hidden gem in the lower east side! Stopped in for a nitecap with a friend and had a wonderful experience. It was 3am so it wasn't busy. The entire staff that was closing was so kind and accommodating even though it was close to their closing time (4am). The drinks were delicious and there was a really good selection of crafted cocktails to choose from. Will definitely be going back!,,,
16,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",847,3150,11026,4.0,12/30/2015,"Some mistakes stick with you for a long time. My mistake was that I missed the happy hour special. Luckily, this is an easily remedied regret.Ended up coming here for some cocktails with friends. Like others have mentioned, they make a mean whiskey ginger. Cocktail prices range from reasonable to above average, but you can watch the bartenders, so you know they actually put care into it (also why it takes a while for the drinks to come out).The place is actually very long, with a front room and a back. The back definitely looked much cooler, though we just had a half booth by the entrance.Wanted to try the oysters which I've heard a lot about, but it wasn't happy hour anymore, and I'm not made of money (yet).",3,4,2
17,Billy F.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,11,0,5.0,2/15/2018,This is a sweet cozy spot. We were immediately greeted with a warm welcome and the service was quick. The atmospheric cocktails were reminiscent of prohibition era. The live band added to that ambience . Perfect for a small group or date. I will definitely be coming back.,,2,
18,Chandler A.,"New York, NY",316,43,18,4.0,12/20/2016,"I came into bar belly last night for an event promoting Yola mezcal. Not knowing what to expect, I was so amazed by every aspect of this place. The decor and whole ambience is well decorated and cozy. It was definitely a later crowd because people started pouring in around 10:30 and began dancing to the fun music that was playing in the back ground. Most importantly the drinks were absolutely amazing and the bar tender was so friendly and nice. We had the kiss yola and mistletoe cocktails as well as another one with coffee liquor and eggs and beer (sounds weird but it's not). I should also say that the popcorn is to die for. Overall this place is a hidden gem. A little pricey but hey it's New York",2,,1
19,Brittany M.,"Hoboken, NJ",149,8,0,5.0,3/23/2018,Loved our experience. The bartenders really knew what they were doing and the cocktails were amazing. Lovely band too. We will be back!,,,
20,Dehlia I.,"Manhattan, NY",2,26,3,5.0,6/22/2017,Everything here is delicious. Great for happy hour and beyond.Kebobs are perfectly cooked. Juicy and divine. (Lamb and chicken both.) Potato tamasomething was to die for. I had to stop myself from licking the plate.,,,
21,Lauren F.,"Tacoma, WA",173,4,0,5.0,6/16/2017,"One of my favorite neighborhood spots. Has a great crowd, good food and drinks... not much more you can ask for. It can get pretty crowded on a Friday/Saturday night. They typically start with live music and move into a DJ. I've been just for drinks, dinner and happy hour. Happy hour is a good deal. One kind of oyster for $1.50 (which I hope doesn't creep up anymore) and some cocktails and wine on a deal.The free popcorn adds a nice touch. This spot used to be called Lead Belly but changed last year, in case anyone is confused.",,,
22,Matt A C.,"Walnut Creek, CA",259,121,192,5.0,5/18/2016,"Came here for an after the after-party party, and I'm glad I did. Blues, oysters and cocktails: what's not to like?Somehow they managed to fit about 20 of us in, even though we took up about a third of the space. The oysters were great, and the rest of the menu looked good. Next time I am in New York I would like to try this place sober.Cheers!",1,1,1
23,Cmtl S.,"Brooklyn, NY",93,31,21,4.0,12/2/2016,"I came in by accident (Thursday night 12/1//16) and immediately loved the ambiance of the place. I was still kind of working and waiting for my partner, So I had a drink; House wine $11. I had missed happy hour and wasn't really hungry But by the time my partner came we both immediately noticed how attentive the staff were. Seriously from the bus boy to the owner (I assumed she was) Because of this alone I'll be back. It's a plus that they have jazz, I don't know what all these non New Yorkers are uptight about. Its a cute spot and the service is a on point. Get your panties out of a bunch you're not in Hollywood, Loosen up",2,,3
24,Donna C.,"Saint Augustine, FL",240,178,1172,5.0,1/15/2015,"I was so happy we stopped in here. We were waiting for a table at the Fat Radish (see review) and stopped by to have a glass of wine and oysters. Even though we're are familiar with freshwater oysters in Florida, Jimmy and I had never gone to an oyster bar that had so many different selections. Carmine was are server and he was just awesome. We were only there for a short time but he was so knowledgeable and attentive. We ordered a dozen oysters and a glass of wine. It was such a great start to the evening. The atmosphere was so quaint. Had a nautical theme and low lights. Snuggling up to my fiancé on the lower bar seats was nice. Highly recommend going!",2,,

28,David E.,"New York, NY",43,3,0,1.0,12/1/2017,"Waited at the bar *forever*, it wasn't very busy. Seemed like the bartender was going out of his way to not serve us. Never coming back here.",1,,
29,Danielle V.,"Manhattan, NY",15,4,2,2.0,1/18/2018,"Sad to say, this place has changed. Visited recently only to find it had lost its je n'ais se quoi... This used to be a really cool spot to grab a drink with friends, but now it just feels different. End of an era.",,,
30,Ashley N.,"New York, NY",381,334,634,4.0,3/26/2017,I thought this place was called Lead belly not sure. But I love coming here for happy hour! They open at 5:30 and they have a happy hour from then until 7 that I always and only take advantage of. I'm not usually all the way downtown except for work and then I would head uptown immediately but when I have time I would always pay bar belly a visit. They have happy hour oysters for 1.50 each so I always order a dozen. I love oysters so much so having one so close to the train is perfect because I can just go in and out quickly. They also have amazing cocktails. I've been here in the winter where I tried their hot toddy and it was delicious. I've also had some of their wines. They don't have an extensive list of wines but they do have about one of each kind of wine. They have happy hour deals on their cocktails and some of their wines as well. I wouldn't say their wines are much to write home about but they make pretty good cocktails. The bartenders are super nice and attentive and they give you free popcorn! What's not to love? They have a lot of tables in the back but I usually sit at the bar because it's usually just me with a friend but they do accommodate to crowds. It's a small space but it's very intimate and if you call ahead of time they can move tables so you could be in a group of 10 if you want.,2,,3
31,Caroline W.,"New York, NY",205,54,73,2.0,8/3/2016,"A cozy spot, good for catching up with a group of friends. The dollar oysters are alright - they do own up to the dollar price. However, their peach sangria is very refreshing, especially in this summer heat. Scotch eggs are delicious, truffle fries are extremely thick cut but definitely hit the spot. NOTE: if you come in a larger party, they automatically add in tip without any forewarning - shows up on your final bill. I came in a group of ten and ended up paying double tip because of this. But when I realized this a few hours later, it was already too late. The service received in alignment with this guaranteed tip was also ATROCIOUS. We waited a good twenty to thirty minutes before having to flag down the waitress, which we had to do every single time we wanted a drink or order food. This is unacceptable, especially if you are going to give yourself a secretly guaranteed 20% tip (of which was not noted to me before seating, after seating, or noted on the menu).",3,,
32,Ilana S.,"Union Square, Manhattan, NY",1,24,5,3.0,7/14/2017,"Went for an 8pm dinner on a Friday night. When we walked in it looked like the live music was leaving and a dj was setting up. We were given the option of a seat in the front where we could hear each other or one in the back where we could not. The dj was actually good but they were right we could not hear each other. The drinks were good but the food was very bad. We ordered the hummus which was very bland, the tomato salad which was literally just tomatoes drenched in dressing and the potatoes which were also just unseasoned potatoes in a pool of decent sauce. If anything go for drinks and skip all food.",,,
33,Kristen L.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,269,76,5.0,9/2/2016,"It was my best friend's birthday and we saw bottles on fire through the window so we were super excited to come in here and check it out. Shout-out to the gracious host who immediately seated us, got us menus, and promised us birthday shots (tequila shots on the house - can it get any more lit tho). The Getaway is UNBELIEVABLE - the smoked rum and pineapple fusion was perfect. The music is so good here, with seamless transitions between 90s pop hits and current Top 40. I'm lowkey obsessed.",1,1,1
34,Tanya Z.,"New York, NY",388,355,624,4.0,7/29/2016,Cute spot. They have live music starting at 7pm. I dropped in on a Thursday night with 6 other friends. They accommodated us well. The drinks were a little on the pricier side but the poison arrow and Brazilian mule were really tasty !,2,,1
35,Harrison P.,"New York, NY",0,16,0,1.0,1/28/2018,"So me and a friend went there and my friend racked up a bar tab of about $150. He had left a $12 tip... which in NY for just the bartender I thought was alright... I mean he was literally just pouring us BEER, not making any crazy mixed drinks... and when we left the manager came out and I shit you not was yelling at us telling us we should have left more. I thought this was extremely rude and unprofessional. Patrons can tip whatever they please, my friend could have left more... but he also could have left less...WILL NOT BE GOING BACK BECAUSE NO ONE SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE THIS!!!",,,
36,Amanda C.,"Chicago, IL",115,17,0,3.0,3/29/2017,This place is super cool; the truffle popcorn and drinks rock but negative points for slow service. We waited 30 minutes for the fries and they forgot our drink order.,1,,
37,Cortney W.,"Brooklyn, NY",628,417,1323,5.0,2/1/2015,"Lead belly is an awesomely cute place on the LES and Chinatown border.  A group of friends and I went for the happy hour special. Since it was a Saturday, it was one of very few places that had $1 oysters and drink specials.  The place had just opened for the evening so it was relatively empty when we first arrived. It began to become more crowded as we were leaving. The lighting was nice upon entering. The decor earthy and the music was at a good level to have a nice conversation. The waiter had already set a few of our friends up and he approached us to tell us the specials for the evening. We ordered a few different appetizers and everyone was pleased with the choices. -The Scotch egg-Truffle fries-Bacon wrapped Brussel sproutsThe menu isn't huge. Perhaps because the oysters are the real star of the show. We ordered about 4 dozen and they were fresh and very good. One order appeared to have smaller oysters that were a bit sweeter. The wait staff was attentive and friendly the entire time.We will definitely be back for another happy hour!",4,1,1
38,Laura I.,"New York, NY",138,140,90,4.0,2/17/2016,Great spot and even better happy hour. We enjoyed some tasty cocktails and $1.50 oysters. Very happy they were Barcats and not Blue Points!! The Leadbelly has a cozy feel and is perfect for a date or catching up with friends. Will def be back to try more food like the scotch egg or grilled cheese!,2,1,1
39,Jinah J.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",371,19,7,5.0,1/7/2016,"I met up with some friends after work before we headed to a concert. I tried the oysters, the grilled cheese, the truffle fries, and had a whiskey ginger to drink. The food was absolutely delicious and the drinks were really good. The place is somewhat spacious for New York so small-medium sized groups can be seated here. The decor is cozy with suitcases packed in a shelf and vinyls against the wall. The waiters were attentive. Cozy place to meet up with friends or a date.",3,1,1
40,Jeffery J.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",52,15,4,1.0,12/10/2016,"I don't really do Yelp or even have the time to write this stuff but $6 for a Coke and $20 for a Martini really? Important Note to Manager/ owner or whoever gives a shit about running a proper business. Don't automatically charge the customer 20% gratuity for a Coke, this seems desperate. Also noted, this is not the Carlyle, it's Chinatown.",3,1,

Live music is a nice touch. Drinks are fine, Cucumber Julep was a favorite of our table. But everything feels a touch too expensive for the value and service leaves a lot to be desired.",,,
42,Katie B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,11/17/2016,"Bar Belly never fails to disappoint (even though I do think Lead Belly is a better name)The cocktails are classic with a little something different. It can get a little crowded on weekends, but during the week, a great place to grab a drink in a comfortable environment. One of few places in Chinatown like this, so definitely a gem. Word to the wise, the happy hour only includes 1 beer, 1 wine, and 1 cocktail.",2,,

The two things I will comment are the scotch egg and the drinks.The scotch egg which was good I think was 12 bucks which seems pretty ridiculous for what it is.I order a couple of old fashions and though they did you good rye whiskey, the drinks were 3/4 full and 16 bucks each. I think total we got 2-3 appetizers and 3 drinks and is was 100 bucks. Not my cup of tee.",1,2,2
44,Heather H.,"Jersey City, NJ",434,335,1,3.0,6/18/2014,"We came here for a friend's going-away party this past weekend - although we missed happy hour, we still were able to experience the atmosphere and the food a bit.Overall - the space was narrow as mentioned in other reviews. We claimed a small square (called a ""floating table"") and ordered two whiskeys (probably came to about $40 already).... and then got the cheese plate because the waitress thought it was her favorite thing on the menu even though she had no clue what cheeses were included. For $12, there were three microscopic slices of cheese, a dribble of honeycomb, three honeyed walnuts and ONE apricot. Seriously.....While Im spoiled when it comes to my bar spots and drink prices, I have to swallow my indignation and remember this is a fancy-pants place in Manhattan. The waitress, although clueless, was really sweet. The space was inviting and cozy, and we only got stepped on once or twice by runners and other customers. Recommendation: Come for happy hour, sit in a loungey-area, and maybe have a beer instead of their specialty drinks...",3,1,2

48,Paris S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4,18,30,4.0,2/19/2015,"I love this place! My date, and I stumbled upon this place on Valentine's Day, and I am so glad I spotted it. The ambience is very dark, and jazzy. Dim candlelit lighting which I thought was very romantic. The Staff is extremely funny, and kind. They make you feel welcome. We sat at the bar, and started off with a couple of drinks. My date ordered some beers, and I started with a glass of Chardonnay, and two or three Smoke Signal drinks ( Orange drink with salt on the rim of the glass ) let me start off by saying the Smoke Signal cocktail is the best cocktail I've ever had in my life!!!! So Delicious with the perfect amount of smokiness, a slight sweet flavor hits your palate, and the salt on the glass balances the sweet, smokiness perfectly. Take it easy on this drink! It will definitely have you feeling nice & tipsy. I can't wait to go back just for my smoke signal cocktail. The Bartender is so cool, down to earth, and very skilled in making cocktails. He knows his stuff; therefore you will not be disappointed. You get a small bowl of complimentary popcorn. Even the popcorn was delicious. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because the food selection is limited, the hostess at the front informed us about their sister restaurant directly across the street ""Fat Radish"" for more food options. He also recommended the crab gratin which I did order, and man was it delish! He was super sweet! Such a Beautiful person inside & out. Thanks for the friendly environment & great drinks!! I will be back!!",,,

50,Maeve M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",316,539,111,4.0,11/27/2015,"We didn't have a reservation and I was afraid we wouldn't even make it in the door but the bouncer steered us towards a teeny table in a really awkward location. Oh well, lesson learned - always make a resy. Despite this, and the fact that we were far from the awesome jazz band playing, I still loved the Leadbelly. If we had been seated farther inside it might even have been 5 stars. In any case, this is an awesome spot to hang out and have a few cocktails (definitely more of a bar than a restaurant, though they do serve part of the Fat Radish menu, owned by the same people). Learn from me and make a reservation so you can sit close to the live music - hard to beat that. Drinks-wise, my boyfriend had a gin gimlet, and I went with one of their cocktails, a spicy margarita which was okay. Next time I might try a gimlet or something more classic, but I'll definitely return.",,,
51,Lindsey S.,"Brooklyn, NY",28,158,592,4.0,12/3/2014,"I came here with a friend of mine on a Thursday night during their happy hour in order to have some of their oysters before we were heading to dinner in the neighborhood. We had seen this place after dining at the Icelandic joint Skal nearby. It is located across the street from the Fat Radish and shares a kitchen (I think) for their hot food. Their happy hour oysters were Barcat and Malpeque (both east coast) that night which means $1 each. A great deal. We split a dozen of the HH oysters and had one each of their other offerings (that night's selection consisted of: Ninigret, Montauk, Shigoku and Kusshi). We sat at the bar (though I don't think you have to in order to take advantage of the HH deal) and had a couple of glasses of wine with our oysters. Our oysters came out within 15 minutes of ordering them, which was perfect. In the meantime, while we were sipping our wine, they had freshly popped popcorn for us as a free bar snack. I love that! The space itself is very nautical in its theme. With weathered white painted wooden walls and white washed cement covered brick. My friend and I loved their bathroom set up, too. Just a neat space. I definitely want to go back another time to try some of their other food, and of course for more oysters.",,,
52,Janice L.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,536,697,2.0,7/12/2014,"Yea, there's a reason why this place only gets 3.5 stars despite the location and being across from the Fat Radish. Tips: dont get the pitcher. It's $50 bucks and gives you less alcohol than a $10 mixer. And, it's also filled with ice- how wonderful. Our cucumber julep almost tasted like a slushy and impossible to sip. We also witnessed at like 3 cases of mistaken orders within the 2 hours period we were there.Conclusion, hot mess. Overly loud music. Oh, and over priced. Well, at least come for their oyster happy hour.",1,,

This place is so tiny and got so crowded you litterally couldn't move. I don't mean figeratively. I mean I litterally was trying to leave and could not, bc there was no room for people to move out of the way, even to squeeze past them. It was probably a fire hazard to be honest. Also it smelled weird in there like sweat and mildew.....it was strange. I did however really like the music they were playing, and the crowded seemed like my kind of people. Eventhough I was so overwhelmed by how crowded it was. I would go back on a week night or earlier on a weekend, but not stay that late.",1,,

Spicy Pineapple, Cucumber Julip, Dirty Lemonade and the best one was Spicy Pineapple $13 for sure. Their kitchen is located at Fat Radish across the street and you can order things like their famous Scotch Egg for $9 too! Most of night they opened till 2 am but after 12 am kitchen close.

I used to live across the street and took numerous friends, fellow Yelpers, and the occasional date here over the years but I never really felt like making it a super-regular spot. Great cocktails (the Happy Hour special is highly recommended) and a pretty good wine and beer selection. Most of the food is good to share with a group, especially the oysters (just get a dozen, 6 is never enough). I liked the avocado toast and truffle 'fries' (they're more like truffle oil-drizzled potato wedges), as well as the Scotch egg. The peeky toe crab was also fun, but I don't always go with crab eaters.They're now serving the fat Radish burger, but for $19, you're probably better off with just oysters.It looks like they're no longer doing trivia, which is great because it wasn't a good trivia experience. It's too narrow of a bar with difficult seating (small tables and stools) and some of the other teams were cheating (and also found themselves uproariously funny). It's filled with similar clientele late nights on the weekends, so I recommend showing up early for happy hour then peacing out.",4,2,3

They have a small menu but it's just enough if you aren't picky.  For those who don't eat pork you may find it even smaller - 2 dishes out of a handful had pork/bacon in them.

When someone at our table ordered a glass of white wine he said that was a bad choice and suggested a different wine. When she asked what it was like he replied ""being raw dogged over looking the Mediterranean."" When another girl at the table misheard him, she asked for clarification, he said ""being f&^%ed without a condom"". Then when the girl didnt like the wine he had suggested and asked for her original choice he said ""you're a white trash whore with no taste"". While obviously (or rather hopefully) he was kidding, and he did divulge that he was ""heavily medicated"" we found him obnoxious and beyond rude for a place that has wonderful food and drinks and prices that reflect the level of class you'd expect there.

Truffle fries are $9 and are small, but actually really good, though I'm not sure it's worth $9 - they basically give you a whole potato that they cut into wedges, fry perfectly and season with cheese and truffle oil.The regular selection of oysters was good considering I don't like oysters, but the regular non-voucher happy hour oyster selection was _even better_!

The bar itself was great - warm environment, very cute decor and live jazz. The service - AWFUL! My Tuesday evening there was possibly the worst service I've experienced in Manhattan, and at $13 a drink - I think that's pretty unacceptable. The waitress (wish I knew her name) was the worst! We, a party of 4, each ordered a drink and sat at a table in the back. Waited. She brought us 2 drinks. She needed to be reminded of what the other 2 were, and came back with them - 1 of which was incorrect.Next - 2 of us ordered drinks. We waited. We waited some more (at least 15-20 minutes). We asked her where our drinks were and she assured us that they were on there way as if the wait time was not out of the ordinary - no apology. She brought 2 drinks over - 1 of which was incorrect.Separate bills for drinks and dessert? We asked for the check, gave her our cards and then she brought over another bill for the dessert. My friend gave her a $20 to pay for her $13 drink, and the waitress didn't bring her change until asked. I'm sorry - did you really think you deserved a 53% tip?",4,2,

Their cocktail list has so much going for it.  Lots of fresh and crisp concoctions with citrus highlights, delicate fruits  and refreshing flavors,  Next time I'll sample a bit more off the menu, but for this visit we all settled on lemony Whiskey Gingers, and Cucumber Mint Juleps. I enjoyed the energy of this place as well as the fun music selection (lots of throwbacks and fun oldies).  In the front is bar seating and some small cafe tables, but in the back there is room to do some dancing if that's what you're in the mood for.  Can't say anything about the food here, but based on other reviews it seems like it makes for a better night spot, and the crowds of young, beautiful people probably makes it a great singles spot as well!",,,

The place was super crowded because apparently a promotion that Leadbelly ran with TravelZoo was about to expire so there was a mad rush to redeem the vouchers. So the restaurant was understaffed, slower than usual, and out of a few offerings. But still very generous in their efforts to seat everyone.A tourist couple next to us was extremely rude. They returned their dozen East Coast oysters saying ""this is a joke! these are not oysters, they're snails."" Another couple near us also returned their oysters. Apparently people who don't usually get oysters are expecting those giant phlegmy tasting China Buffet type Pacific oysters. gross.Well -- the servers handled these hostile voucher diners with a lot of grace.

One could sup here fantastically every night without conventional dinner, like a charmed bohemian, while listening to old-timey live jazz music. The menu of small plates changes seasonally and it's prepped in the excellent Fat Radish kitchen across the street. The cocktail menu changes seasonally as well, and there was significant bitching on my part when the Almond Russian cocktail (a White Russian made with homemade almond milk) was scrapped, due to low demand. Upon consideration, I should've ordered more when it was on the menu!!! The service and scene is laid back and extremely sweet. Because of it's small scale, it's a great place for a couple or up to 4 people. A few times, I've been there and some large parties sat in the back of the room, but it changed the energy of the room, for the worse.

The toast that accompanied it was a bit on the hard side...but other than that.... it was A-ok.  The menu is limited with small bites, so don't expect a full gourmet meal here.  This place is best suited for lots of oysters and specialty cocktails!it's got a unique vibe to it...but the atmosphere was totally dead.  i hope it picks up...this place has potential.  but like with all nyc spots, you better keep swimming before you sink.",1,1,2

103,Teresa H.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0,1.0,2/22/2014,"I went here last Friday for a friend's birthday party. The bouncer outside was very friendly so I had high expectations as we walked in. Of course, as we opened the door we were overwhelmed with a damp, pungent smell, that of cheap whiskey, body odor and stale mold. It was incredibly crowded and we couldn't progress past the bar, which featured a bin with six oysters sitting in dirty ice; people were putting their beers next to the oysters to keep cold.We bought a round of shots and the bartender told us that we had to wait ten minutes, as they were waiting for glasses to come back from the kitchen. We asked for his finest whiskey and the barkeep argued with us about what their best was. When we finally got their best (Dewar's), it was warm. Taking a shot of warm whiskey in a seedy, dank and crowded bar is not a pleasant experience. I am concerned about how much this place is a fire hazard. It is long and very narrow and as you head to the bathrooms it gets hotter and harder to breathe. There are candles placed on every surface, and if one table is upset there could very easily be a terrible fire (I didn't see an emergency exit). The lines for the bathrooms were so long that we just left. Hands down, going to Leadbelly was one of the worst bar experiences I have ever had in NYC. Maybe it is nicer when it is not super crowded but I would never eat raw shellfish that has been left out in such conditions.",,,

106,Anne S.,"New York, NY",79,5,0,2.0,6/26/2014,"Went here for the first time last night (6/26) -- was looking for a nonpretentious, nonprecious happy hour in the neigborhood. From their own website, I knew a happy hour was from 6 to 7 p.m. Fine. But what were the specials? The site didn't tell me.After googling around, I found out there are $1 oysters (great if you like them, but alas, I do not) and...what about the drinks? Only one review mentioned that they had $1 oysters, $3 beers, and one $6 cocktail special each night. Yay! I could do that (their cocktails are normally $13, which I will never find reasonable, no matter how awesome they are).Long story short: They do have $1 oysters from 6 to 7, but only one $5 beer (I don't like beer), and...NO COCKTAIL SPECIALS. C'mon, man. COME ON. Not even a happy hour wine. We are not all hedge fund managers!The place, at least at 6 p.m. (when they opened) to 7 p.m., was empty, but cute and comfortable. The bartenders were nice enough (I liked the guy who made my drink), and I will admit that my two $13 cocktails were pretty great. I don't know if they were worth $26 (plus tip), but...they were good. And the place is clean. And we made some small talk with another couple at the bar (also saddened by the drink prices). So, it was, ultimately, fine.If you don't mind spending the money, it seems like a cool place. But, I am a cheap girl, so...I will continue my quest to find pretty drinks for $8 or less.Sigh.",3,,

111,Grant B.,"Brooklyn, NY",289,126,27,3.0,12/12/2012,"While working a listing in LES/Chinatown, I kept walking by Leadbelly across from the Fat Radish.  It looked interesting in that 'rustic-urban-farm-to-table-cocktail-bar' kind of way.  I ran into a manager outside one day, and got a tour.  I decided to go back that night for dinner followed by live music.  Quite a nice evening planned out.And the experience?  In short, I'm enthusiastic about the potential (much like the area itself) and hope they can tighten up the operations and flavors a bit.I'll start with the two plates I ordered.The Bacon wrapped Brussel sprouts-pleasant had a pleasant sweet-hot glaze that waz perhaps a touch on the runnier side.  Could have ha a bit more stickyness, but the flavor was already more complex than a sticky/hot/sweet general T'so's or sweet thai chili glaze.  Unfortunately, the brussel sprouts themselves were a fair bit too Al dente for me.  It seemed like they were hardly cooked and took a lot of sawing to cut them which means that bacon is falling off everywhere. The macaroni and cheese was solid, though not incredibly unique or anything. There was a nutty flavor from the Jerusalem artichokes (sunchokes) and pasta shells were a good choice as they capture a lot of sauce.   The cheese sauce creamy with a fine consistency if not a touch thick. However, there were definitely too many sunchokes with pasta shells outnumbering them only at 2-1 or 5-2.  The jalapeno lemonade drink tastes mostly like a jalapeno that is not too spicy.  There is a slight nip to the finish, but the drink itself was not quite lemony or sweet enough to be a take off 'lemonade'.  I also tried the beet juice spicy tequila drink.  It was earthy (as expected with beets) but could have used something citrusy to elevate it or berries to sweeten it.  Also, not sure how I feel about heat with beets.The ambiance is great if you like old Timey/rustic interiors as I do. It is funny how a gut Job (used to be Sweet Paradise) looks old with craggly plaster lines over brick, reused corrugated tin, and some exposed wood beams above the music. area.The staff was friendly, but not necessarily as self aware as they could be.  The bartender in front of us was mixing drinks and splashing us all night (a couple drops at a time).  I should have scattered some spare shot glasses in front of us to try all the different drinks!",,,

118,Paula W.,"Washington, DC",0,4,0,2.0,12/26/2016,"I went in with a large group of friends. We were in great spirits - celebrating a friends show and ready to have a good night of drinks and give this bar good service. The waitress was doing her job when she told us that our 1 friend of the 15 or more people we brought in couldn't bring something in to eat when this bar's restaurant was closed. (most bars let you bring food in when their kitchen closes. Most bars. this is a lame place that masquerades as a cool bar) We escalated it up and spoke to a manager who  was a total buzzkill. She gave us a song and dance about the kitchen being closed and there were ""rules"" and she couldn't make one exception with one individual. She told my friend (the one who brought in all the business) ""to get oysters"" or ""popcorn"" as that was still being served as part of their snack menu this was their option as a meal substitute.. we couldn't believe it. In most normal places, when someone brings in a huge crew and she's asking to bring in a sandwich from an area that is dead and it's after midnight and the bar's own restaurant is closed, there is some flexibility. it's not like we were all asking for pizza. she wanted to sit quiet and eat. As a long time new yorker, really disappointing to go out to a place that really just misses the mark - real people get it when the arent serving food that it's OK to make an exception when noone else is there -  the owners are clearly uptight, money making only establishments that dont care about the people or the vibe they are creating. not going back.",,,

Friends and I went for happy hour expecting to order oysters for $1 each. When we got the bill, they had charged us $45 for an ""oyster sampler"" which we had known nothing about. One of the waiters told us only certain oysters were on the happy hour menu but it was so poorly advertised we had no idea. I argued with the waiter because no one had made it clear to us which oysters were part of the happy hour special, and even a waitress told us SPECIFCIALLY that we had not ordered anything off the happy hour menu BESIDES the oysters. Isn't ""the customer always right?"" Our waiter was incredibly rude and I had to literally fight with him to change the price of our over $200 bill, even though he claimed ""they were losing money."" Also, we found a live crab in our oysters.  I understand that this probably means the oysters were insanely fresh but it was still disgusting and disturbing. Seriously, if you want a great oyster bar with great service, go to The Mermaid Inn.P.S.-- after we ""caused trouble"" over the overpricing of the oysters, the waiter proceeded to include a 20% automatic tip on our bill even though there were only 4 of us.... pretty sure that's just improper restaurant etiquette.",,,

We arrived around 11pm ish on a Saturday and it was really packed so be aware of it. I can't comment on the food but the oysters looked very good. The crowd was mainly hot people with few hipsters (not my preference lol).
