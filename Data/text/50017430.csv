0,Anonymous D.,"Baltimore, MD",0,34,0.0,5.0,7/20/2018,"Had a great stay here! Very clean, mostly very quiet, and very nice staff!I can't be happier with this hotel. I just wanted a place to crash while being a tourist, and this hotel checked all the boxes. Loved the blackout curtains in the room (a wonderful touch!), checkout isn't until noon (!), and they will hold your bags after you check out the last day! There was some street noise (dumpsters being emptied one morning, a few sirens here and there) even 8 floors up, but really, what do you expect in a city? The room was small but comfortable, and so very clean. Bed was comfy too. It was a couple blocks walk to any subway stations, but it's nice to have a couple different stations to choose from. Very close to Penn Station, so it's convenient for Amtrak. Breakfast isn't complimentary, but I don't really want to eat hotel breakfast anyway when I'm in a city with other options. Great stay! I will recommend to others and would come back again. Everyone I came in contact with here was very nice and helpful.",1,,
1,Marina C.,"Boston, MA",1,15,1,1.0,10/25/2018,"Easy location, clean, and quiet. However, I am VERY frustrated with the service. I came in for a job interview, so I came the night before intending to get a good night's sleep. After dinner, I came in to the lobby and asked the front desk staff to assist me with a late checkout. He was helping other customers, and I just intended to ask how I might go about doing that (in passing), he brushed me off and I apologized, went upstairs, waited a few minutes and called back. He then proceeded to ask me to call back later as he was busy checking in guests. I kindly explained that I had a job interview the next morning and needed to get to bed. He shooed me off the phone and said he was busy. I sighed and hung up, and took a shower. 10-15 minutes later, I called again. It was now nearing 11:30 and I desperately needed to get to sleep. He said he was still busy and asked if he could call back. I insisted that I needed to get to sleep and to be at a VERY BIG JOB INTERVIEW IN THE MORNING (like HELLO this is IMPORTANT I'm not just being difficult!) and he got very angry with me. I continued trying to insist that he assist me with late checkout, since I wouldn't be back from the interview in time for 12 PM, and he got very aggressive and angry and said it had been a busy night and he was still checking people in. He was incredibly rude and did not treat me well at all. I understand that hotels get busy, but treating your guests so incredibly rudely is never okay. I am still waiting on a resolution to this and instead took to Yelp to warn others.",,,

3,Gina C.,"Englewood, NJ",77,63,128,4.0,11/3/2018,Great location! Around the corner from MSG! Pretty hotel and great room size for a big city hotel. The only negative is parking down the street with no hotel stay discount ($54 a day)!,,,
4,Maisha R.,"Jacksonville, FL",1939,1090,4845,4.0,11/26/2017,"This Courtyard is conveniently located very close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. It's also in close proximity to the Empire State Building and not far from Flatiron. It's on a busy street in Chelsea, across from a police station. The lobby is small but inviting, with beautiful tile artwork behind the counter. I was warmly greeted and offered apple cider as I waited, which I thought was a nice touch. The room and bathroom were decent sizes and they appeared clean, but in need of some renovation, particularly addressing the cracked tiles in the bathroom.I worked out in the small gym in the basement, which was perfect for my needs. There were a few treadmills and an elliptical, along with a small area for lifting free weights. A water cooler was by the door. For nourishment, they have a bustling cafe just off of the lobby.Nice location, comfy beds, great hospitality",8,4,7
5,Steph G.,"San Clemente, CA",12,307,547,4.0,1/2/2018,"Clean modern Courtyard just a few blocks from Penn Station in New York which I like. Makes it easy to get in and out of the city and back to Newark airport. Although I do have platinum status. The hotel does seem more like a revolving door for tourists and less business travelers. Few minutes walk back to time square and theater district etc. This property is usually priced a bit higher than the other hotels in the neighborhood including another Marriott courtyard a few blocks away. Friendly front desk staff. Has a bistro. I had a Junior suite which was nice, clean, but had a very distinct smell of bleach in the bathroom. Comfortable bed. I like that I can control the temperature. Wi-Fi worked at an adequate speed. Would return because of the proximity to the area that I like to be in.",1,,

8,N M.,"Standish, MI",0,1,0,1.0,11/6/2018,"We called 3 hours ahead to notify them we would be a late arrival for our reservation that I had confirmed the week before and had made months before.  They assured me there would be no problem.  When we arrived we found that they gave our room away and had no others!  They admitted our late arrival was noted on our reservation.  They said there was ""something wrong"" with the room.  It was midnight and after travelling 10+ hours by train and dragging our luggage from Penn Station they sent us to a Fairfield in to a smaller room in a 3 star hotel that is $150 less per night with no compensation.  They were rude and unapologetic. We had to walk 6 more blocks with our luggage to the other hotel.  I called my credit card company who contacted Marriott that next a.m. and they assured me we could return to the Marriott (I had no other options) and that Marriott would make it right and compensate us.  We lugged everything back to the Marriott at 9 a.m. to be put in an inferior room yet again.  They assured us they would move our stuff to a better room while we were on our reserved tour that we were due to attend and everything would be taken care of.  When we returned they had not done anything and balked at my request for the appropriate room.  They finally moved us to a room on the top floor.  We missed 2 meals and were late for two events.  There were no apologies.  They were the only rude people we met in New York.",,,
9,Lena S.,"Los Angeles, CA",218,149,88,4.0,2/26/2018,I stayed here for work and it was lovely.  They have a nice work out area.  The mattress on the bed was heavenly! The breakfast is pretty good and the free wifi seemed pretty fast. The only thing that was kinda odd was that if you leave your bag there with the bellhop it takes a really long time to get them again.  It seems as though they keep them downstairs and they have to take an elevator to stow and retrieve bags so it can take a really long time so be sure to allow for that.,1,,
10,Tracie J.,"Prosper, TX",92,61,33,5.0,4/4/2018,"Classy, clean and great customer service! I'm so glad I picked this location for this trip. We will stay here again. No bed bugs, just a great, comfy bed. I read other reviews and we did not experience this at all. The staff that checked us in were so nice and accommodating, they made us feel welcomed. They also congratulated my son on nailing his audition that we had flown in for. Getting off the elevator (19th floor) we came across a maid who greeted us just as nice as the front desk staff! We entered the room that is super clean and the beds are so comfortable. Yes, we will stay here again. Great job Marriott!",,,

Oh...how could I forget. ..CARLOS!   The friendliest, most charming, sweetest man in NYC works here.  Carlos works at the cafe inside this Marriott property.  Every morning when my coworkers and I would queue up for coffee,  not only would he greet us with a genuine friendly smile but would make sure we were happy and that everything was to our liking.  At one point we were locked out of our conference room and Carlos happened to be walking by, he made sure a key was brought down and stopped back down to make sure we were ok.  Did I mention he runs the cafe on a different floor?  This is an example of a person who is highly engaged and wants to ensure visitors leave feeling the pride in his city.  Thank you Carlos, we think you are the jewel in that hotel.",9,4,8
13,Paul P.,"Nashua, NH",116,56,48,5.0,10/15/2017,"Very nice hotel right around the corner from Penn Station / Madison Square Garden. Unlike other reviews - found absolutely zero bedbugs. To the contrary, linens and bedding are some of the cleanest and finest I've ever seen. Bathroom is super clean with what appear to be all new faucets, shower, and toilet. Beautiful blue glass backsplash, and a double sink in the suite!Friendly and helpful staff - Stephanie and Tim were super polite and helpful at check-in! There's a very nice cafe / eating area off the lobby, and what looks like a bar & grill next door. This a nice somewhat upscale hotel.As you can probably tell I will definitely return!!",,,
14,Noelle N.,"Whittier, CA",0,27,4,4.0,7/21/2018,"Great location. It's within walking distance of Times Square, Empire State Building, and Central Park. It had higher reviews on Expedia compared to Yelp for some reason.",,,
15,Amber G.,"Wilton, NH",49,13,40,4.0,1/4/2018,"The rooms were nicely made, and everything seemed very clean. We were there for three days, and I would rate this hotel four stars. Nice view of NYPD headquarters across the street. Most of the staff was very friendly, except for some of the front desk women who seemed very annoyed when asked questions. The elevators are very fast, which is nice when there is a lot of people. I did not rate this five stars for a couple of reasons; the two double bed rooms seem big when you first enter, but they are really small with four people in them. If you have the option, upgrade to a larger room. I was with four people and we had to slide around each other at the end of the beds. Also, the cafe downstairs is nice, but it costs way more than it is worth. I got an orange juice for $9. I recommend going to the bagel shop down the street (great breakfast sandwiches). Also, before you book, ASK FOR A FLOOR THAT IS HIGHER UP. We were on the third floor and could hear everything that was going on outside.",1,,
16,Monique L.,"Long Beach, CA",32,38,3,5.0,6/17/2017,"My husband and I pulled up and immediately saw the outdoor patio which is in front of the hotel. It was a beautiful evening so there were many guests sitting outside hanging out. We walked inside of the hotel and we were greeted by Adriana and Johnny. Adriana was finishing up checking in another guest, but took the time to acknowledge my husband and I. As we were being helped, we asked about things to do in the area and Adriana and Johnny made some great suggestions. Both staff members also took much pride in their workplace because they shared fascinating details about the woman who created an amazing piece artwork behind the check in desk. They knew who she was and what materials she used to create her art pieces. We wrapped up checking in and headed upstairs to our room. There are 3 elevators so we didn't wait long at all. We got into our room and the view was nice. The room was modern and CLEAN! Legitimately the BEST Courtyard we have ever stayed at! We ate at the restaurant next door and it was good. They had a great happy hour menu. We also walked around because we were not far from everything. We were down the street from Madison Square Garden, we walked to Times Square (it was 30 blocks, but a very nice walk). From there we walked to Central Park. It was a great adventure and the walking didn't bother us at all. Be prepared and have your walking shoes. I am very pleased with the service and the experience and don't want to stay anywhere else when we go back to NY. We will definitely be back in October, thank you again Adriana and Johnny.",1,,
17,Ashley O.,"Springfield, VA",94,126,152,5.0,4/24/2017,"The staff here was really wonderful. They were always greeting you and asking you how your day was so I was really impressed. The rooms were very clean, but a bit small. I had a room with a king bed and there wasn't really much space to put my bag, but this was the only downfall. I also loved that you needed a room key to enter the hotel during late hours as well as getting into the elevators. This made me feel really safe!",3,1,2
18,Rosanna B.,"Spring Valley, CA",15,64,62,5.0,5/31/2017,"I love staying at the Marriott in every city. Their service level is getting close to becoming the Nordstrom of hotels. Every time I walked through their front door I was pleasantly greeted. They always had sufficient staff to work the front desk and enough bellhops. If you are visiting the city and unfamiliar with it, this makes you feel very safe. I especially appreciated the small store breakfast bar they had that sold Starbucks coffee. I just wish they were open past 11:30am. The gym was nicely equipped and clean at all times. The rooms and hallways were also very well maintained and huge plus for having a fridge! My suggestion would be to have more ice machines other than the one downstairs.",1,,1
19,john w.,"Muldrow, OK",0,62,1,3.0,7/27/2017,"Safe.   Near the Garden.  Rooms old and dated, but friendly staff and quick elevators.   We just crashed here and did not spend much time at the hotel.  Typical trip to NYC.  Up and out by 8, home by 9, off to bed.  Nothing special here.",,,
20,Miranda L.,"Newmarket, NH",41,5,1,4.0,6/2/2017,"After a four hour train ride to New York, our hotel was much-needed. When we entered the modern exterior, the staff were extremely professional and welcoming. They immediately made me feel comfortable and safe. The hotel has some great security features, including the need to scan your keycard to go up to your floor on the elevator. The elevators were pretty and modern, and felt sturdy. First impression of the room was very neat and just overall good. Decorations were minimalist and pleasant. The bathroom was also nicely decorated and neat. The bathroom was very clean and I felt comfortable with the clean modern materials, that could be easily sanitized. One thing I was displeased with was the duvet on the bed. As I pulled the covers back, the sheet that was wrapped around the duvet fell back and I could see various stains (including one that looked unwashed and was dark red). I was kind of grossed out because the duvet was also kind of discolored. I know it would be hard on maids to do duvet covers, but they may be a better option than just having the duvet sit between two sheets. I was a little disappointed that the duvet didn't seem to be washed between guests, because the one stain looked fresh and unwashed. All the other bedding and towels were fresh and white, and the pillows were comfortable, the mattress sturdy and comfy.One other disappointment was the lack of complementary breakfast. There was a small stand downstairs that sold things (somewhat expensively), but some sort of cereal station or pastry offering would've been nice. We found some great New York breakfast places to substitute, but by the time we found somewhere to eat and got there, we were starving. There was, however, some packaged coffee offered in the room. Overall, some sort of breakfast offering and a completely clean duvet would've earned this places 5 stars, as it was overall a pleasant experience, and the location is very good.",1,,
21,Junise G.,"East Bronx, NY",117,1,0,1.0,3/27/2018,"This was probably the worst experience I ever received in a hotel. My boyfriend was placed here at the Marriott for work. On March 26, 2018 around 8 we decided to leave the hotel get dinner and come back. Before going up my boyfriend and I decided to  stopped at ""Dewey"" (the bar connected to the hotel) where they were having a private event, for a drink. We asked the host since it was a private event if we were able to take the drinks up to our room. She said yes , in which we proceeded into the lobby. In order to get into the lobby from Dewey you have to have a room key upon entry. As we entered the lobby, my boyfriend asked the receptionist if the waters were for sale because we had cash (considering I just bought a drink with cash). Her response was no and we continued on to the elevator. As we were walking to the elevator ,the door man ( who was Caucasian), followed us to the elevator and before my boyfriend got in the elevator he tapped him and ask if there was an issue and if we needed help with something as if we were lost. When he realized that my boyfriend had the room key in his hand he said never mind. In the elevator there for two other Caucasian men who were going to the 7th floor who might've had something in their hand, but were not asked the same question. For the first time in my life I experienced racial profiling and made both my boyfriend and I uncomfortable.",3,,
22,Melissa S.,"Washington, DC",55,133,62,4.0,4/29/2017,Comfortable hotel with a decent view- for me at least. The staff were accommodating and the rooms were clean.

I don't mind the sound of sirens or the bells ringing at 7am-Clean, comfy sheets-Ample bathroom space-Good water pressureCons:-Not a fan of the armoires for hanging jackets/pants because it's just awkward how they're stacked in front of each other-It's Manhattan so I usually assume really small rooms, but this was bigger than I thought-Slow elevators, but I wasn't too concernedBasically, this hotel met all my needs and I was comfortable. I'm highly allergic to things but this place didn't break me out at all. So I don't know if it's because I got lucky. I will say this though, prices for this hotel were astronomical before Jan 1. I stayed here for 3 nights after Jan 1 and the prices per night were decent. They didn't stick me with a huge price hike after a Sunday night stay.

33,Sally L.,"Duluth, GA",220,86,168,4.0,8/28/2016,"This is the Marriott I stayed at for my week in NYC. When we arrived, it didn't seem as glamorous as the pictures tried to make it seem, but it was still very clean and welcoming. We were lucky in that we were able to check in before the intended check in time of 3:30? 4:30? When we arrived at 1:30 expecting to ask them to hold our luggage, we were instead greeted with 4 key passes for our room. There isn't much of a view outside the windows, unless you count the weird castle-like building across the street (which by the way, is a police station? wat..) The wifi is a little spotty, but it works and it's free for your duration. The location is also a decent location. While it's not super close to landmarks like Central Park or Time Square, those places are but a 20+ minute walk. What this Marriott is close to, however, is K-Town. It's just a few minutes walk away. It's also a 20ish minute walk to Chelsea Market and the Highline. Considering the price difference of this hotel versus those 15-20 minutes away, this hotel is definitely worth the price. The room was clean and inviting with quite nice pillows and comforters. The shower is also awesome with it's pretty tiles. The sample personal care items when I went were Paul Mitchell's line of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and shower gel. There's a list of the amenities offered on their website so there's no use for me to place it in my review. The only thing I wish they had more of was outlets. With 4 people staying in their 2 double room, it was a major pain fighting for outlets. I guess there are only little bits of things that I nitpicked about that didn't put this at 5 stars, such as wifi reliability, not enough outlets/loose outlets that didn't hold onto our plugs, and the open window we found when we returned. My allergies are super sensitive, so coming back to the smell of New York inside my hotel room wasn't the greatest. But my stay here was really nice. It's not a 5-star experience but it's a good place to come back to after walking around so much. There's also 2 pokestops right outside the hotel, and if you get the right rooms (like we did!) you basically have unlimited pokeballs ready for your next day's adventure. You just have to hope your GPS is accurate in reading that you're close enough to them.",3,,1

Updated review","Was contacted by the hotel asking me to contact them. i did, and sadly, I never received a return communication from the property. Nothing. I did, however, receive a call from Marriott Corporate Loss Prevention (i think), telling me they found no evidence of bed bugs. How so? I have pics of the 50+ bites i received during my stay, but will spare all my fellow yelpers that level of detail. It wasnt pretty. For what its worth, Marriott made no attempt to reach out to offer anything for my pain & inconvenience, nor did they put points for the stay in my account. As a Platinum member, ive made the decision to shop my status with another brand, and change my loyalty relationship. So very disappointing.

39,Kat D.,"Miami, FL",300,227,185,2.0,10/23/2015,"Dealbreaker:   We're on the 2nd floor of the hotel and can't get phone reception without opening our window - and then still get only one bar from only certain parts of the room.  Not sure if this makes the hotel more money through phone calls, or if its lack of consideration for guests, but my friend who I'm here with for fun had a work emergency this morning and couldn't use her phone.  We're both with different carriers and neither of us could use our phones to dial out.   We would not stay here again based on that despite everything else being great.HOWEVER - the place is really clean, the staff is really nice, and the location can't be beat.  They don't do room service or serve alcohol which can be expected from the price of the rooms compared to other hotels in the area, but there is a pub next door with great service.  They'll even help you out if you tell them you want a glass of wine to drink in your room while you do work ;).   They should have a better relationship with this pub so that you can call in your order in advance from an in-room menu, but its still pretty awesome.",,,

41,Sung L.,"Plano, TX",0,35,10,4.0,7/10/2016,The hotel was directly opposite the police station. So I felt really safe there. And it was within walking distance of so many things. Madison square was practically next door. The staff was really nice. The only problem I had was the a/c. It didn't get cool enough during the daytime. Which wasn't really bad since we spent most of the time out of the hotel room. We only made pit stops to drop off stuff that we had bought and to use the restroom. The public restrooms in NY are really bad.,2,,

Talked to multiple people and the last person I spoke with was  Andy doll and they all promised to pay for my dry cleaning... Two months later not a penny! Not to mention the things I threw away and 3 days of disinfecting and washing and drying all the rest of my clothes in the house because I had nightmares when I got home! I also got a exterminator to come to the house and paid it out of my pocket! Thank you for the horrible experience!,3,,1

Rooms are modern and clean, AC works well (which is a MUST during these humid summers) and we got a good price since we booked with a AAA discount. This review is really more four and a half stars and not five because they put us in a room directly across from the elevator. It hasn't been too much of a problem at night, but yes, you can hear every time someone enters and exits the elevator during the day. The free WiFi is also spotty but I appreciate having it then not. Nevertheless, I am really happy I chose this hotel, it will be our go to whenever we come back to NYC.",,,1

We stayed here the first two nights of our trip before moving over the the Holiday Inn Express Times Square (closer to the convention center) and this hotel is like 20 times better! The rooms were actually quite spacious compared to others in the area, it was in great proximity to everything, and they had starbucks coffee downstairs! Checkin had no problems, and everyone was friendly. It was strange to use my hotel room card to move the elevator, I usually had to dig through and find it before we could go up.

Front desk staff was friendly and property definitely met Marriott standards. It's walking distance from Penn Station, ideal for people coming in from out of town. Plenty of food options from all price ranges in the surrounding area. They have an on-site Starbucks cafe open only during breakfast and a decent restaurant attached for drinks and bar food. It is 15-20 minutes walking from the Javits Center or you can opt for a car or Uber.",,,

Marriott moved me to another room and their inspection confirmed bedbugs. I was offered nothing in the way of compensation (except payment for dry cleaning bills) or even a free night's stay at another hotel in the future. I had multiple conversations with Marriott's corporate office and they refused to assist me. Basically, they tried to say that it was possible that I brought the bedbugs in with me and they couldn't be sure they were responsible. I will never stay here again and I can't believe how unhelpful Marriott was. Very disappointed.",6,,

This was our first time staying at this hotel, but as is to be expected with all Marriott hotels, it was a wonderful experience! The location was great, the rooms were clean, everyone at the front desk was extremely friendly and more than helpful. We needed to check in fairly early in the morning (9:30am) and even though our room wasn't ready, they were able to hold our luggage and valet our car. The next day we checked out at noon but still had some things to do, we weren't planning on heading out of the city until around 4, and they were able to hold our luggage and allowed us to keep our parked there until then which was greatly helpful.I would definitely recommend staying here and we'll also definitely be staying here in the future!",,,
51,Don B.,"Memphis, TN",39,56,0,5.0,7/6/2014,"Great experience!  The rooms are decent sized for a Manhattan hotel.  Small, but not tiny. The bathroom is large - huge walk-in shower was a nice surprise.  Fridge, really nice HDTV (with an actual great picture - rare for any hotel!)I had an issue with my air conditioner. The staff responded within 2 minutes and sent 3 technicians to fix it.  Unfortunately, they could not - BUT - they immediately moved me to another room with zero hassle. (And an ice-cold AC!) The maintenance guy even went and got my new keys for me and offered to help me carry my luggage. The location cannot be beat. 2 blocks from Madison Square Garden, which of course connects you to the entire city through Penn Station and the subway and train system. They also have the 24-hour pantry customary for Courtyards. And a nice little a la carte breakfast place. The room was spotless, linens fresh and the bed was comfortable.  Free wifi to boot.  The staff - all extremely friendly and personable.

The outdoor are was awesome, and the staff were incredibly attentive and, in short, a cut above the rest. With proximity to Penn Station and 28th St, you can get almost any train from just a short walk. The only thing that docks the star for me is the TERRIBLE pull-out. If you don't need to sleep someone on a pull-out, this is the place for you. Great find in NYC.",,,

Nice service, still has that new feeling, and very convenient location walking distance from Penn Station. I was on the 9th floor during my stay, and the hotel was quieter than I expected it would be. One note, there is a church nearby with either a carillon or bells that may ring in the early morning, I was up already but perhaps others may not appreciate the wake up call. Exceeded my expectations, I would for sure book again since the pricing is reasonable and it's a newer property than others in the price point.",3,,
54,C N.,"Milwaukee, WI",0,28,13,4.0,2/8/2014,"This hotel is still fairly new (stayed in early February) and it appears as such.  The rooms are small, as to be expected in New York.  They are equipped with everything you have come to expect in the Courtyard by Marriott chain.  The bathroom is not as small as other NYC hotels I have stayed in which is much appreciated. Enough room to put toiletry items on the counter.Things to note is that this hotel has no bar or restaurant and a very small lobby.  There is plenty of dining and work space in the business-time back lobby area.Staff was polite and welcoming, but not over the top.  One of the only cons I can find is the toilet paper and tissues are of the absolute lowest quality.  I would highly suggest the hotel spend a few extra dollars on higher quality paper products. Additionally, the street/block the hotel is on has no street lamps in the evening making for a bit of a dark evening walk to 7th Ave or Ave of the Americas.I will certainly stay here again.",2,,

56,Plain White T.,"New York, NY",1,338,124,2.0,11/12/2015,"Customer service was fine but this hotel seriously needs to be clear with how its policies are presented online and elsewhere, particularly with online prepaid rates (unlike most locations this location does not charge you until after checking out at the end of your stay even when doing a prepaid rate) and having someone check in who is not the reservation holder (I arranged for 2 people in my party to check in ahead of me but was not told by the hotel up front that they would need a physical credit card to put a hold on or a cash payment from them at check-in, which was embarassing since I told my party that I already took care of the room costs - isn't that what I entered my CC info online for?).  The front desk manager actually handled the issues very well and accommodated me with complimentary points, but it was still a pain to deal with having to refund both their payments then switching the card on file back to mine.  If their policies were clear to begin with, this debocle may have been avoided.In addition, a phone charger was mistakenly left in one of the rooms and I left a message for housekeeping the day we checked out.  When my call was not returned more than one week later, I called back and after being put on hold for a few minutes, the staff advised they were not able to recover it.  Thank goodness no one left anything valuable there.On a better note, the rooms were clean upon arrival, staff was nice, and the concierge will store your bags for the day at no charge after checking out.  The hotel is located right near Penn & MSG.",,,
57,Gary W.,"Danville, CA",0,8,0,4.0,6/11/2014,"We stayed here for four nights last month (May 2014). What a wonderful experience! The building is only a few years old, so everything is pretty new. The room was snug, but not tiny. All the furnishings were not only nice, but interesting. More upscale feeling than the usual hotel blah. Most importantly, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Every day we had some question about directions, transportation, what-to-do suggestions, etc. The staff people on duty answered our questions, and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable with what they told us. This is really almost a boutique hotel disguised at a Courtyard Marriott. Very limited food service, but, hey, this is New York; there's food everywhere! And even the food staff (breakfast only) was very friendly. Two minor annoyances: I agree with the reviewer who noted the paper goods were almost see-through thin. And our window still had a large piece of plastic protection film waving in the breeze, apparently never taken down when the hotel opened.These quibbles aside, our stay was very enjoyable and would happily stay there again.",1,,

This property opened only a couple of weeks ago and so I expected a very neat and clean hotel and was not disappointed. The room was cozy with a very nice bathroom and a New York city view; the room was quiet, as this property is located directly across from a NYPD station on a relatively small street there was very little city noise. Located in close proximity to Herald Square and right around the corner from MSG, and only a short walk from Penn Station (about 3 blocks). We walked from Grand Central - it worked. The hotel staff was extremely busy but remained very professional, courteous, and polite, especially the bellmen. It is clear that the hotel is putting out an effort to make their guests feel welcome. As a tourist visiting the city, I vote yes on this hotel and recommend it to all!Did I mention the hotel was reasonably priced? Best value on comparable properties in the area, hands down.",1,,

63,Jeff J.,"Chicago, IL",117,369,139,1.0,3/1/2015,"This Courtyard Marriott suffers from a design flaw that made it virtually unstayable for me. The heating unit for the room is located in an enclosure right by the bed, and it makes a loud clicking sound every time it turns on and off, which is frequently. When running, the fan also makes a loud humming sound. Death by a thousand cuts for a light sleeper. After dealing with this for half a night, I decided to turn the unit off and hunker down under the blankets for the rest of the night. Then in the cold light of morning (and I mean cold literally) I asked myself one simple question, why am I paying New York hotel prices for an unheated hotel room? Minutes later I was checking out (after making a reservation someplace else), turning a 4 night stay into a one night stay. Which is too bad, because the location is good, it's a new, clean, bright property, and the staff are friendly. The problem is none of the above, but Honeywell, who designed the heating system, and Marriott's management, that installed it. Bad show guys. As hotel professionals, you should know better.",,1,
64,DLynn L.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,6,0,1.0,11/4/2014,"I travel quite a bit and this stay unfortunately was the worst I have ever experienced. Whenever I stay at a hotel I always leave the Do Not Disturb sign on my door to protect my privacy (and belongings). Unfortunately during this stay, the housekeeper ignored the Do Not Disturb sign and entered my room anyway.When I returned to my room after running the NYC Marathon and noticed my room had been serviced against my wishes I immediately took an inventory of my belongings, especially my wallet which I hastily left my wallet out in the open. Sure enough, a small amount of money ($20 or so) was missing. I called the manager immediately and reported the theft. A Loss Prevention person came to my room, asked me a few questions and took a picture or two. After that  I was told I would be contacted the next morning with the results of their investigation. No one ever contacted me the next morning. I eventually received a voice mail from the Assistant Manager at 3:30pm that afternoon. When he and I connected to days later (after I called them instead of them returning my calls) I was basically called a liar and that the hotel was standing behind their employee. They said that I was wrong and that the Do Not Disturb sign was not on the door as I insisted which is why the housekeeper entered the room. They went on to say that the housekeeper denied taking the money so they found no reason to continue to look into this matter.It was a small amount of  money but to me, that is not the point. My privacy was clearly violated and then for the property not to even so much as apologize is unforgivable.I have since reached out Marriott's Corporate offices to seek a proper apology.",1,2,
