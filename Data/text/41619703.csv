0,Aimee L.,"Mastic Beach, NY",142,117,561,5.0,8/12/2018,"Our waiter alone is worth 5-stars. Even while underdressed and young-looking, we were served efficiently and politely. Of course, the extensive options on the prix fixe menu are also a plus. To start, we were recommended Bordeaux for red wine and riesling or sauvignon blanc for white. I went with the riesling because of the uncomfortable summer heat we just escaped. Our wine glasses were constantly refilled before they were even empty. We were also pleasantly surprised to learn thatThe Canadian bacon was too salty for my liking but the lobster risotto gets a thumbs up. The steak - which would've been the best option at a steakhouse, now that I think about it - was sooo good. I wish I could've traded my risotto back for a steak instead. Against my better judgment, I went for the risotto because I just had steak not long ago. Lesson learned: order the steak. And obviously don't ever get it made well done.",4,,1
1,Tom C.,"Queens, NY",24,5,1,5.0,8/4/2018,We went to Tudor City Steakhouse as a large group lastnight for Restaurant Week and everything was excellent.  I was not sure if they would accept a large group of 11 on a Friday night so I email them and asked.  Miranda responded right-away and included the RW menu which I responded asking to make the reservation.  Miranda called me the next day and confirmed my reservation promptly!The dinner was as good as it gets and the steaks were well prepared to the temperature and all my friends had a great time!  As we tried out many of the options on the RW menu and we were not disappointed at all and great value!  The manager David and all the servers on our table were really good...We will be back again!,,,
2,Caz B.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,5.0,10/21/2018,"What a hidden gem. My friend had a gift certificate and three of us went to celebrate my new job. Everyone was friendly and gracious. Our waiter Kirk was a treasure. We went with a few of his suggestions and were not disappointed. From the salads, to the petite filet mignons to dessert, all were excellent.",,,
3,Kelly S.,"New York, NY",0,9,3,5.0,9/28/2018,Wonderful! Attentive and kind staff. Delicious food! We had the skirt steak. It was cooked to perfection. The crab cake was just as amazing! Did I mention how amazing the cheesecake was??,,,
4,Steve O.,"New York, NY",7,79,4,3.0,11/14/2017,"Let me begin by saying I have great hopes and expectations for this restaurant. But, further thereto, let me also warn they are not yet met. This restaurant deserves to be five-starred; but not yet. It's an instant classic, with a venue that has been a restaurant since the beginning of Tudor City, but it needs tuning.The first few times I entered, I only had cocktails and bar food. But both were very good -the appetizers were, in fact, brilliant. The Old Fashioned cocktail was supposed to be made with Old Overholt rye, according to a sign, but it was not. And there was no muddling of sugar and cherry. Overall, though, still a decent cocktail. The bar is limited in size and is becoming busier every day. Often hard to find a seat.This is a steakhouse near where I live. And it is a welcome addition for its promise, since the other steakhouses in the neighborhood, notably The Palm, Sparks & Pietro's, do  not sell a porterhouse steak -which is, to my mind, the single best cut of steak available. Moreover the restaurant promises that it ages prime meat in its own aging locker. Finally, I note that this restaurant is apparently part of the same group that owns Four Cuts, on First Avenue, where I have previously had dinner -and a great porterhouse. So this promises to 'one up' Four Cuts, and that sounded good. I should note, they also serve a lot of seafood and even have ceviche. But as with all new ventures, there are still hitches in the road. Most importantly, the steak was imperfect and does not compare, yet, with the Four Cuts I had, and certainly not with Keens or Peter Lugers. It's good, and was served medium rare, as I asked, but was a little tougher than I expected and the flavor was not outstanding (but it was, in fact, very good). The sides were a mixed bag. Home fried potatoes were served too cool with some of it dried out and hard-chewy. Asparagus and the truffled-cream corn were both excellent. I highly recommend the latter. Given some time, I expect to rank this restaurant much higher. For now, however, I am somewhat disappointed.",4,,1
5,Tony E.,"Bronx, NY",42,64,0,3.0,8/31/2018,I must say I am kind of disappointed after reading all the great reviews. I don't know. Maybe I caught it on a bad day. First off let me start off on a positive note or two. The food was fantastic. The place is very bright and clean. Nice atmosphere. Here we go for the down side. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. They did not have the one we wanted so we settled on  a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. It was strike one. Then the waiter went to get an ice bucket and never put the wine in it. We asked a couple of questions and all they were concerned about was some computer issues that they were having. And how overwhelmed they are with upcoming UN events and meetings. Not my problem. We had to ask for more water when the second pitcher tasted like tonic water. We did not want to say anything at this point. We also asked what the side sauce was. When I asked what was in it I was looked at like I was painted purple. Still on the fence if we are going to come back. I could see if the place was busy but it was us and another table of two. We could not even pay. We had to wait because of there computer issues. Not cool !!!,,,
6,thomas r.,"Manhattan, NY",118,11,0,2.0,2/16/2018,"I was excited to try this place out, especially because we live so close to it and we wanted it to be a successful longterm business.  But considering the price, we were mostly disappointed.  Some pros and cons of this place:- The bread was embarrassing - a stale white bread.  A steak house should have a much higher quality bread.  It's the first thing a customer eats, so it was a disappointing start.- The Ambience needs a lot of work, we thought.  The sound design of the place was pretty bad - maybe some low music or something to help? And the design of the place could use some work.  They had battery powered plastic candles on the table.  If you're going to charge $50 for a steak, I think a real candle is in order.  - The staff was great though - very friendly and helpful.- The actual steaks actually tasted quite nice.  No complaints on the cuts or quality of the meat.",3,,
7,Kurt V.,"Washington, DC",15,17,0,4.0,3/17/2018,"I ordered the Caesar salad, to be followed by lobster risotto.  The $12 salad was totally pedestrian and I feared the same with the entrée.  Actually, it was amazing. A rich broth, a half lobster, flavorful, well prepared.",,,
8,Maggie R.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,5/7/2018,Great happy hour and location for Tudor City residents. Lovely location and gorgeous in the Spring. Highly recommend!,,,

Updated review","Thank you, David L and Shelley of Tudor City Steakhouse for your gracious offer to give me a 'do over', as of 12.11.2017. I have responded equally graciously, and hope that my next experience is great.I have not yet heard from your PR team!  Am hoping this is genuine and sincere. Looking forward!",4,,
10,Angela M.,"Charlotte, NC",51,5,1,5.0,10/13/2017,The quality of the food and service are both great. The steak was perfectly cooked. The sides were perfect as well. It's a fairly new place and it would be really great to see it succeed.,,,
11,Kim M.,"Worcester, MA",0,1,0,5.0,3/2/2018,Live right next to it and will keep coming back! Steak was delicious and the sides are awesome. Best onion soup I've had in a really long time.,,,
12,Brandon C.,"Flushing, NY",0,8,0,5.0,2/11/2018,"Reservation honored. Attentive, hospitable, pleasant service. Generous portions. Tender, flavorful porterhouse steak served in the classic New York style. Flavorful sides. Clean, uncluttered yet homey atmosphere with plenty of open space. Reasonable prices for a Midtown steakhouse. Will return.",,,
13,Kitty K.,"Hinsdale, IL",4,97,2,5.0,4/17/2018,"Superlative. I live in Chicago, a town that has more than a few great steakhouses. However, my heart now has one more reason to love my birthplace of New York City after dining here. Pre-dinner Manhattan: just the right balance of bourbon and vermouth. Generous portion, served in classic stemmed glassware. The lobster bisque: Equally generous with fat, chewy pieces of the treasured crustacean in a creamy, buttery base. Wedge salad: Completely fresh, served with the house vinaigrette instead of the recommended bleu cheese dressing. Grilled salmon: One exquisite filet resting in a sunshiny beurre blanc sauce. Sirloin steak: Served on the bone and cut with precision. The flavor was sumptuous. Wine list: Many of the predictable superstars from California and France. Good by-the-glass selections, too. Service: Wow. Ken Kirk is the embodiment of an expert who knows the menu and wines inside and out.  It's a treasure.",,,
14,Domenick D.,"Financial District, Manhattan, NY",32,26,0,4.0,10/9/2017,"I was happy to see a new restaurant open in this remote and charming space.  Tudor City is little known and often forgotten Oasis in Manhattan. Many of the residents, including me,  prefer it this way. But we desperately needed a replacement after losing L'Impero/Convivio.  I went with a friend and had a very meal. The rib eye steak was prepared the way I like and was large enough for 2.  My friend was very pleased with the burger on the menu. The sides were a little uninspired and could have used some creativity.  They're just starting so adjustments are expected. I will definitely return.",,,1
15,Miranda D.,"Manhattan, NY",62,15,9,3.0,9/26/2017,"This was a tough one, I've been looking forward to this restaurant for months. A small group went for happy hour at the bar. We ordered drinks and a few bar bites and appetizers. The calamari was great and a nice portion for a happy hour special. The wine and beer specials were also great! We also ordered a few different types of ceviche. My ceviche was not the one I ordered, but enjoyed it none the less as they all looked good and staff appeared occupied. At the end of our meal we asked for the bill to be split a certain way and it came back divided incorrectly. We entertained ourselves watching the bartender make drinks, which was unfortunate because we also saw the drinks go to tables incorrectly. Hoping this is due to the new opening and we will go back and have an improved experience to review! Maybe with more time the service will change to match the delicious food.",1,2,1

17,Alina M.,"New York, NY",13,21,4,5.0,10/8/2017,Lovely Steakhouse in the heart of historic Tudor place. Ambiance is very classy and some spots offer unforgettable views of Brooklyn Bridge. Service is attentive but not disruptive. Obviously steak is a hit but I also tried the vegetable lasagna and salmon tartare and can highly recommend them! Thumbs up for the homemade desserts! Love them! Keep the good work,,,
18,Vic A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,5,5.0,4/17/2018,Super chill place with one of the best happy hour specials in the area. Good afternoon place to have a nice quiet steak dinner without all the noise from New York city restaurants. Perfect for larger groups.,,,
19,Anastasia N.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,10/20/2017,We came here on Thursday. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at the bar. The service was something I have never experienced before. It was earlier at the night so I'm  guessing the bartender had more time to pumper us. This place was absolutely amazing!,,,
20,Katrina O.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,4/14/2018,"Excellent steakhouse. A friend and I went for the early bird special and everything, from the Cesar salad, filet mignon to Apple cobbler was excellent. I highly recommend this steakhouse.",,,
21,Ahmed S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",43,6,0,3.0,9/26/2017,"Went there for lunch today. Let me start with the positive aspects: the service is great. The waiters are attentive and very friendly.  On the flip side, the steak I had was not on par with what is on offer in the other premium steakhouses in the city. I ordered the sirloin, and while it was perfectly cooked, the quality of the meat itself just didn't have that dry-aged, prime ""edge."" Another thing, it came sliced.  In my opinion, never bring a steak to a customer sliced unless you tell him/her first and give them a choice. The side of  onion rings was perfect, though. Avoid the truffle butter as a sauce; it is barely edible.  Another issue I had was the fact that the AC was not on even though today was quite warm, so I wasn't exactly comfortable while dining.",,,
22,James W.,"New York, NY",3,15,7,5.0,2/1/2018,"While in Grand Central I picked up the NYC Pocket Guide and saw an ad for this place, I then googled the restaurant and a listing for it came up on GoVisitNYC.com. I called the restaurant to see if there was a menu special for restaurant week and there was not one, I was kinda disappointed in that, however, my business partner decided we go there anyway because it was close.  We had the clams casino, superb and we both had the ribeye with sides of mushrooms and potatoes, nothing to complain about.  It was a nice clean restaurant, not many people in the place but then again it was early evening.  I talked to the waiter and he told me they also owned Four Cuts Steakhouse that I was at previously at a few months ago.  I had a good experience there as well.",,,
23,Rebecca R.,"Manhattan, NY",10,24,0,4.0,12/23/2017,"Best macaroni and cheese ever: crusty and delicious. It's a side dish ($10.95), so I also ordered asparagus ($11.95), because they must pay a fortune in rent. But the mac and cheese alone is almost a meal. Another time, I had broiled shrimp ($35.95), which were incredibly fresh. We shared a salad, and they split it onto two plates in the kitchen, which was nice of them. The owners seem to realize Tudor City is middle-class, and they have a handful of entrees under $30 (vegetable lasagna $22.95, hamburger $17.95). Two negatives: Staff members are a little cold, and there's no weekend brunch.",,,
24,Glen K.,"Huntington Station, NY",0,2,0,5.0,1/16/2018,Very nice meal and very nice evening. Quiet quality steakhouse in a wonderful location. Service and ambiance was great. We'll be back!,,,
25,Lisa W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,1/8/2018,"My husband and I ordered the Porterhouse steak for 2, which was delicious and cooked to perfection.  Elegant and upscale atmosphere without being stuffy.  Very friendly staff and attentive waiter (Franco).  Overall, a great experience at Tudor City Steakhouse.  We will return.",,,
26,Jill M.,"New York, NY",12,160,1,5.0,10/12/2017,"This is a new addition to the Tudor City neighborhood and is a great place for dining or just to have drinks and appetizers at the bar. They have a great happy hour and bar bites that are delicious. My friend and I had a few glasses of chardonnay and ordered the filet mignon sliders and a side of truffle fries. Food was really tasty and the fries are to die for! (Wish they would add prosecco to the happy hour drink menu!). Lavon the bartender was the quintessential bartender - attentive, but not obtrusive. Friendly and professional too. Tudor City Steakhouse is located across from Tudor City Parks which is a beautiful setting. I think (but don't quote me) they are also going to have outdoor seating which would be fabulous. I think this location is ideal for people who work at Pfizer and the United Stations - the restaurant seems like the perfect ambiance to host business lunches and dinners.",,,
27,D. K.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0,5.0,10/6/2017,Decided to pop in and sit at the bar for an early dinner one night this week.  I had a nice glass of white wine on the happy hour for $7 and a cheeseburger.  The burger was very tasty and the fries were a cut above the fries at other establishments...very good.  Service was good and the staff was very friendly.  I look forward to returning some time soon.,,,
28,Mark H.,"Manhattan, NY",39,8,0,1.0,9/22/2017,"I was truly excited about having a new neighborhood eatery on my block...until I looked inside. The first thing I saw was a child sitting at the bar. What is this, Applebees? I decided not to go into the pretty empty establishment (a Friday night at 7:15) and spotted the menu complete with ceviche and sushi, constant ""ladies night"" (hello, it's 2017), not one but 2 happy hours, etc. I decided not to ever go in because the people who put this business plan together are not too smart. I will never go in and will share with all of my neighbors my first extraordinary non-experience. I am completely disappointed, having resided in Tudor City for 20 years and truly expecting something well thought out. The last time I was in the location of the new restaurant, Valentino, the designer, and his retinue came in and were completely bowled over by the atmosphere and the service and incidentally invited by partner and I to join them. If I saw him now and he wanted to return to the same place, I'd tell him to go to TGIFridays or Olive Garden.",,,
29,Robert G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,11/2/2017,Steak- dry. Atmosphere-depressing. Service-non-existent. Don't waste your time.,,,
30,L J.,"Manhattan, NY",0,28,0,2.0,9/29/2017,"Just okay so far.  Beautiful, serene setting.  The ""filet mignon blue cheese"" sliders were burgers with cheap american cheese and overly salty side salad (like you would get at a mediocre sports bar).  The first ""old fashioned"" we ordered was not an old fashion...at all.  We think it was made with rum.  The second old fashioned was quite tasty and well-made.  They recently opened, so we're hoping they are still just puling things together.  Disappointed so far, but will go back in a few weeks and try again.  The setting, with ample space, broad views of the river, strong breezes and cool wood interior is quite lovely.",,,
31,Barbara R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/14/2017,"Something has gone terribly wrong with the decor and mood of this new place.  We were excited to finally have a neighborhood spot, but the decor is bland, uninviting and terribly over-lighted.  The lights on the back of the bar strip it of any sense of relaxation, and the same can be said of the dining room.  The food was good on the whole, but in the absence of any warmth and intimacy from the decor and lighting, the entire meal felt awkward and uncomfortable, largely from overhead light sources, which are a friend to no diner. For that reason alone, we won't be back.  Would also have liked a nice, cozy place for after work drinks, but felt at the bar like an interrogation was about to begin! The  interior designer must have been AWOL at critical decision stages!  Something is just terribly ""off"".  As said, the food was good, but not great, so didn't justify the steep bill.  The location had so much potential, so it's especially disappointing after our high hopes and eager anticipation.",,,
