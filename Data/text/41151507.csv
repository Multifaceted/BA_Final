0,Miho H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",10,3,0.0,5.0,10/20/2018,"This place is one of the best restaurants I've ever visited. Foods are fresh and tasty, service is excellent and very welcoming, atomosphere is gorgeous. A must-go spot for me whenever I'm in NYC!I went BG restarurant for the first time with my husband and daughter about last week when we were in the city, to celebrate our 8th wedding anniversary. We made a reservation well in advance and requested for a seat by the window, and the table with a fantastic view of Central Park was ready by the time we arrived. Soon, our waiter Scott greeted us, he was very nice and kind. We ordered lobster salad, lobster mac and cheese, roasted califlowers. Everything we ordered looked and tasted wonderful. After the meal, we ordered BG cake and some ice cream for dessert along with a cup of coffee and tea. We really enjoy everything the place had offered to us. Just before we were ready for the payment, Scott came back to our table with an updated bill on his hand, saying that dessert were on them because it's our anniversary. What a great surprise! I really didn't expect anything like this, so I was deeply impressed. Thank you for everything BG restaurant!I'm already looking forward to my next visit.",,,
1,Cara N.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,181,28,1.0,10/11/2018,"Let me preface this review by saying that our waiter, Tarek, was phenomenal. He was friendly and attentive, and generally provided great service.I went back and forth about writing this review, and felt a range of emotions. I chose BG Restaurant for an intimate birthday celebration, and while I had an enjoyable time, I will not return.Some friends and I visited BG Restaurant this week for high tea for my birthday.  We walked in, and were immediately given the once over by the hostess.  Listen, I'm grown, so it wasn't my first ""once over,"" but I don't expect to receive it from a hostess at a restaurant I'm about to patronize. So anyway, we were seated, and greeted by Tarek.  We're sitting there, and I see a woman walk out with a dog flung over her shoulder like a baby. That's right, she had an entire dog, sans dog carrier, in an indoor restaurant. I was surprised, but figured having a dog in the restaurant must have been viewed as less egregious than dining while Black, so I just went back to my conversation.  A few minutes later we were joined by my third friend/the fourth member of our four person party, who ended up finding our table on her own.  Why, you ask?  Because the hostess led her to a table of Asian women, because why wouldn't my friend, who happens to be Asian, sit at a table with other Asian women?The food was ok.  It was only my second time having high tea, and my first time was at the Grosvenor House in London. The food and service at the Grosvenor House were phenomenal! I know I shouldn't have compared the two experiences, but they really were night and day. Everyone at the Grosvenor House was friendly and welcoming, whereas only the waitstaff at BG even acted like they appreciated our business. After tea we went downstairs to do a little shopping, but were treated with more of the same of what we received from the hostess, so we decided to take our business elsewhere...permanently.As I said earlier, I went back and forth about posting this review, because I know this type of treatment isn't uncommon for Black women, and generally women of color in this neighborhood, and in this city.  That said, it's always wrong, and somebody needs to call them on it.  I'm mildly confused by how someone employed by a higher end establishment could take it upon herself to decide what was in my pockets while she was at work.  I had the day off, and had made a reservation to enjoy a leisurely afternoon of tea and sweets with friends, while this hostess was, again, working.  Simply put, I'll thank you not to try guess what's in my pockets while you're at your job. I know BG Restaurant and Bergdorf Goodman are higher end, which is precisely why I chose them. The hostess and sales associates should also know that.  Perhaps some general sensitivity, and reality training would be beneficial, as the hostess and sales clerks were clearly lacking both.",6,,
2,Queen R.,"Brooklyn, NY",153,575,19,2.0,9/30/2018,"I was super excited to try high tea at Bergdorf's. After all- a place with the type of reputation and perceived opulence must be phenomenal. I've had high tea in England, Vienna, and several cruises, and enjoyed that experience- so I figured I could take my mum here to celebrate her bday. The tea was the best part about this service. That tea is the stuff dreams are made Of! I could have that tea for the rest of my life and feel content and happy. I was so Delighted by it- I almost forgot we had some tasty baked goods coming our way. We didn't. Our server, while nice and super accommodating- not at all list and explain the varieties of food that would accompany the High Tea. Turns out as a vegetarian you're stuck with cucumber sandwiches and that's it. The sandwiches were cute. Nit great or fresh. Also my mom did not like the fact that truffles were served in half sandwiches so we just picked off 2 sandwiches. Scones were the best part, albeit a bit dry and hard. Clotted cream was perfect. Also if you're serving me one stone, why are you giving me three different jars of preserves and a whole ton of clotted cream?Portions felt very sparse. The desserts were average at best. Macaroons were good. Thanks for the complimentary bday cake! Overall felt like I overpaid. Beyond underwhelming. Lack of service was disappointing. Wouldn't go back.",,1,
3,Lucy M.,"New York, NY",154,38,14,5.0,11/18/2018,The afternoon tea set was amazing. The sandwiches were really tasty and the clotted cream was very clotted (according to my friend and if you like clotted cream). For a price of $45 per person it's not bad for high tea. Make sure to make a reservation in advance (we came on a Saturday afternoon). Ask stars for having holiday themed cookies too!!,,,
4,Sheri S.,"Minneapolis, MN",554,554,1772,3.0,8/19/2018,"I enjoy going to afternoon tea.Service: We were running late for our afternoon tea reservation so I called ahead to put them on notice. Shirley, was a hotess I spoke with politely adjusted our reservation and  let me know she would alert the team. Isaura was our server. She was pleasant and attentive.Tea Selection: For the tea selection, I had the Citrus roibis tea. Mom had the Peppermint and sis had the Jardin Blue. We each were able to refill our cups three to four times. Now, when one goes to TEA, you expect great quality tea. Unfortunately, my tea was just ok. I expected to enjoy a higher quality, stronger tasting tea from an establishment such as BG.While we waited --- which was a pretty long wait in my opinion --about 20 mins after the tea arrived for the tower of sandwiches and treats arrived. During this time, I observed that the staff changed the table cloth after each guest left, a signal of fine dining which is admirable, but expensive to maintain no? (I suggest putting some nice glass over those tablecloths and call it a day).The seating along the wall were quite close together but we made it work and I was able to take in the view of Central Park in the background.Sandwiches: My personal fave was the Salmon caviar,  then the Brie without the ham, third was the egg sandwhich, and rounding out the list was the cucumber dill.Scones with the Devonshire cream were solid. Assorted Sweet treats ranked from best to least appetizing: Strawberry layered treat, pistachio macaroon, vanilla macaroon, chocolate coffee cake, lemon meringue, tiramisu, and a mini sugar cookie . I must say:First, I expected the restaurant to be a bit more opulent than it was. It may be because I could tell the signature green chairs and sky blue leather seats were a bit worn. The wallpaper and light fixtures were beautiful to look at. Plus, the baby blue Versailles chairs were very elegant, lavish, and quite perfect for a Instagram photo op, which I definitely took advantage of.- But it may be time for a makeover BG.Second: I understand that prices have gone up in the city, but I have also noticed that the portion sizes of the sandwiches have gotten smaller compared to the presentation of pictures from prior years provided by yelpers. I don't have an issue paying for quality as I thoroughly think these sandwiches were better in taste and freshness than Lady Mendel's Tea Salon but the portions were smaller than a generous tea experience from Alice's Tea Cup.",8,5,9
5,Gabby F.,"Beverly Hills, CA",51,57,216,3.0,9/14/2018,"Came here for afternoon tea and a break from allThe shopping. We didn't have  a reservation but we got seated pretty quickly. We didn't come here for a meal but for a small snack, some drinks, dessert and coffee. Our waitress was kind until she realized we weren't ordering too much. No matter what, flu should treat people kindly the way we treated her. Extremely upsetting...besides that though, we got a yummy Mediterranean platter w/ hummus and tzatziki. The wine was delicious and the experience was great beside our waitress. It's expensive so be aware. But truly super classy and top notch. The view is great too so make sure to be seated by the window.",,,
6,Xingye C.,"New York, NY",96,4,5,5.0,11/10/2018,My friend and I came for high tea service. The staff was nice enough to accommodate us with window sits as I requested in the reservation. It's such a beautiful view overseeing Central Park during the Autumn season. I love all the sandwiches. The Scone and the cream are the highlight! And the price is reasonable given the location and the view. Perfect to go with BFF after shopping around.,,,
7,June S.,"New York, NY",189,552,4070,4.0,3/19/2018,"I have been looking for a good afternoon tea spot in the city, and I found a nice place with a great view. It is located inside the Bergdorf Goodman, on the 7th-floor. The inside was much bigger than I expected. With many windows lining up along the wall facing the Grand Army Plaza, it was nice and bright. And the view, oh my, it is awesome! We could see the Grand Army Plaza with its golden sculpture really well. And, we could see into the Central Park as well. The view would be even more fantastic once the trees become more green in Spring and Summer.For afternoon tea, all the food items are pre-selected, only thing we need to choose is what kind of tea we want to go with the afternoon tea. They had nice selection of tea, and they use loose tea leaves, not tea bags. The three-tier afternoon tea kind of looked small at first glance, compared to some other ones I've had from other places. But, it was actually a good portion, not too much, not too little. On the bottom tier, they had savory items and tea sandwiches. Second tier was scones, with jams and devonshire cream. They only had two scones, but nice big size. The top tier was filled with petite sweets. They looked really great! I could not wait to get my hands into these ones!Everything was really good, tasty and well prepared. We enjoyed them all very much. It was almost surprisingly good, since I didn't have high expectation for some reason. Our server was friendly, attentive, and most of all, funny! We always love it when we have a great server. It makes the experience extra fun. I would love to go back again for another afternoon tea, when the greens come back to the trees for even better view!",5,1,3
8,Su C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,66,188,5.0,9/16/2018,"Great place for a celebration with girlfriends whether it would be a bachelorette gathering, birthday or just tea time to catch up.The restaurant is mid-sized with a bar on the side. The chairs and tables, you can tell that they are great quality and fancy. We were sat by the window area with the view of the central park. Fantastic view. I would normally not expect high quality food since it's at BG at a great location attracting tourists, but everything we ordered the ingredients were very fresh and had amazing flavors, not overly done either. The staffs are very professional and our waitress even gave us 2 fancy desserts with the candles for our friends birthdays on the house. I mean our bill was bleeding of course, but then they also gave each one of us $25 gift card to use at the department on the same day! We went to the underground level where all the cosmetics are and we each grabbed a lipstick or other skin care products. It was fun shopping with unexpected gift cards from the restaurant.I would love to come back here for a tea time later.",,,
9,Mahsa T.,"New York, NY",981,879,724,2.0,2/24/2018,"Terrible service, they messed up my reservation which I had made well in advance. They were unwilling to fix their mistake by asking two people to move over one table so they could put two tables together. Instead they crammed six of us into a table for four.Terrible food. My steak might have been good had it not been burnt beyond recognition. Too salty and I couldn't eat the over charred broccoli either. It was all bitter and burnt to a crisp. I was so hungry I didn't want to wait for another or make my tablemates wait. I didn't eat any of the broccoli - it was so burnt it was disgusting. I tried to eat around my charred steak and had the sharp burnt edge scrape my throat. I've attached a zoomed-in photo (even in this photo you can tell how burnt the steak is). Will never eat here again. And I recommend you avoid it too. Crammed space, bad food, terrible service.",6,3,3
10,Marie S.,"New York, NY",278,122,165,5.0,7/22/2018,"In love with this place! Came here for dinner after work with a colleague of mine on a Thursday night. The restaurant is on the 7th floor of Bergdorf Goodman. When you enter, you walk into a quintessential classic NYC upscale ""café"". The staff is phenomenal and very attentive. I requested a window seat when making my reservation because the views are amazing! We were seated right next to the window, in these beautiful classic gold chairs. The decor is very traditionally upscale and the ambiance was fabulous. What is nice about the menu is that some of the options give you the breakdown of nutrition, which is helpful if you're on a diet or need to watch your carbs on keto. We ordered the scallops to share as an appetizer and they were brought up in two different plates which is always nice, but rarely seen. I ordered the roasted chicken salad for my entrée and it was great. After dinner, we were offered an amazing array of desserts I hope to go back and try one day. Overall, why have breakfast at Tiffany's when you can have dinner at Bergdorf? Will return for sure.",,,1
11,Vivi C.,"Atlanta, GA",98,55,35,4.0,2/7/2018,"We were visiting the city during a long weekend and wanted to grab something delicious in the middle of a day full of museum visits and this place was perfect. Thankfully I'd made a reservation for the afternoon tea because by the time we got there it was already sold out and the rest of the restaurant had an hour long wait.The service was impeccable, attentive but not in your face. We got a perfect table in the corner on the restaurant by a window which made the tea experience even better. Their selection of teas covers the classic black teas as well as some more exotic choices. The tower of food was pretty good, the only thing I had that wasn't delicious was their egg salad sandwich which was a little undersalted.Overall, a pretty great experience for $40 something dollars, and definitely worth it if you don't live in NY and want a little something special on a quick getaway to the city.",1,,
12,Amanda B.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",0,28,10,5.0,11/9/2018,The best Tea lunch ever! I recommend making reservations and dressing nice. It's such a beautiful elegant place but the food and tea is even better! It's very fun too it's decorated so beautifully,,,
13,Sabrina P.,"New York, NY",0,14,10,5.0,9/14/2018,"wow just wow! excellent service, excellent food, excellent views...what more can you ask for? hostess was great, checked in our shopping bags and seated us with a table right next to the window with beautiful views of the plaza and central parks. the chairs were extravagant! loved our seating arrangements. our server Adam was amazing, with great recommendations and attention to detail. definitely a hidden gem located on the 7th floor- I say take the long way up with escalators for a great little tour of the shopping center (also helped work up an appetite) but has elevators for those who need. Definitely coming back!",,,1
14,Corinne D.,"Villa Park, CA",61,56,74,5.0,6/21/2018,BG s is always one of my go to lunch spots or Tea times when I'm in Manhattan. This small upscale restaurant is yummy and filled with interesting people. The last time I was there I met a young couple from Texas seated beside us who flew in on their G6 for a quick lunch at BGs. The food is wonderful  and the restaurants ambiance is just as impressive...a must try for Lunch or Tea later in the afternoon.,,1,1
15,Noor S.,"New York, NY",20,220,107,3.0,12/17/2017,"Dissapointed! In the past, afternoon teatime was a blast with great service and sandwiches but unfortunatly my friend and I left unsatisfied. We requested no pork but the snack came with pork. We had to keep trying to get the waiters attention for water multiple times.In addition, we ordered the jumbo crab cake salad and it was flavorless. We had to request new plates and silverware from a different waiter because our waiter was no place to be found. The components of the ingredients of the crab cake just didn't come together well. On top of all of that, we felt rushed by the waiter to pay and when we did, he picked it off the table in a hurry. Just weird and unprofessional experience. I def rec the restaurants manager needs to train certain waiters/waitresses on how to serve customers properly at BG.The decor and seating arrangements are beautiful but overall teatime experience isn't special.",,2,
16,Harshini R.,"Manhattan, NY",14,126,43,3.0,7/15/2018,Mediocre service and food. The staff were very sweet but I expected a lot more. They never came by our table to ask if we needed anything else. I expected better service and food for the price.,1,,
17,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",875,1242,25,3.0,1/3/2018,"This is like a 3.5 star for me - a nice experience but probably more bells and whistles over a really solid high tea experience.  Yes, I came here for high tea with my bff on a Friday around 3pm. To be clear CALL for a res. There is plenty of space available on Opentable; I made a reservation a couple days in advance thinking that a 2:45 reservation basically meant I could be seated for high tea which begins at 3pm.  But, when I arrived, I was told ""they were sold out for tea"" and that the reservation ""had to be actually 3-5pm"" and that they will ""try to accommodate us."" Er. Their dining room, while tight, had plenty of two seaters, namely, available. And as long as there was space for tea, I'm not sure how they could be ""sold out."" Do they make a limited number of tea items and tea? Hm. Anyway, we ended up being seated with no issue at 3:15 but note - make a res in advance and on the phone. The regular tea (non champagne) is $42 pp (or something very close). I forget what the cost is WITH champagne but think it was at least $10+ more. Seems like a lot but it's really a nice ""ladies who lunch"" experience. You can choose among the artisanal teas they have (forget the brand) and my bestie and I both picked the Jardin Bleu which was a black tea that's pretty floral. It was pretty amazing actually  - had awesome aroma and flavor. They had many teas to choose from, from classic Early Grey to various herbal, greens, etc. As far as the tea tower - for 2 we received some tea sandwiches such as a yummy tuna, egg salad (not a big fan of that in general), chicken salad. We also had little savory bites of smoked salmon spread on bread, and cucumber/dill on bread.  We received two delicious scones (rightfully medium sized) which were the right portion size, with artisanal jams. I enjoyed the apricot. You do get good clotted cream but I think i.e. Alice's Tea Cup does a much better clotted cream. The top layer of the tower had petit fours type sweets- very sweet white chocolate (not a fan) of different varieties (white chocolate/pistachio), red velvet bites, pumpkin pie bites (yummy!), macaroons. The service, albeit slow, was prompt and polite. It's a nice experience but would still like to try the Plaza, Lady Mendi's. Another one nearby is the Pembroke Room...The convenience of this place is that it's on the 7th Fl of Bergdof's so you can try to get some shopping or in my case, browsing, if need be.",10,2,5

They put plates down getting the orders wrong and could care less! Very irritating to endure.The place is spotless clean and is still have that decoration of the old world BG Of yesteryear.The turn of the century curved chairs.You can smell the deliciousness on the whole floor.

It is upscale, chic and just think rich housewives (in lack of a better adjective lol). The service was very smooth and the entire experience is super stress-free.However, the food was very mediocre. If it weren't for the environment, I would probably never eat here... got the gnocchi and i feel like 80% of the gnocchi I've had in the city was better. It was too oily on the outside by dry on the inside, and the sauce was nothing to write home about. The side of spinach was too salty.",,,1

Our seats were overlooking the breathtaking scenery of Central Park in Autumn in a rainy day.The food and service is 5 star.

23,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,3.0,1/1/2018,"I went here with my family around the holidays to have a nice brunch out in the city. We made a reservation about a month in advance so we were seated upon arrival.To start with the meal, we ordered the lobster mac and cheese and the lobster bisque. The lobster mac and cheese was decent and had pretty good flavor overall. The lobster bisque, on the other hand, was served cold and then reserved to us fresh out of the microwave--and yes there was a film on top, which would be expected from a microwave--so we decided to pass. Needless to say, we were appalled that a place like BG would use a microwave to heat a bisque.For my main course, I decided to go with the entree portion of the scallops with artichoke ricotta ravioli. The ravioli was flavorful and super rich. The scallops were also rich, but didn't quite hit the mark in terms of flavor or cleanliness (aka gritty).My brother ordered the filet medium rare and was served a medium well steak. They agreed to refire the dish, but it took over a half hour to come out which really created a disjointed meal for the rest of us.Overall, this place is clearly in a pristine setting--but just know that's primarily what you're paying for. The food isn't terrible, but for the price there is so much better food throughout the city.",,,

This time I strayed and tried something new, the Scallops with Ravioli. They were fantastic!! The scallops were cooked perfectly and the pasta was delicious. The ravioli filling wasn't my absolute favorite, but it was still fantastic! I also ordered a mimosa then a cocktail, and both were great at the recommendation of our waiter.If you go alone or only with one other person request to sit at the tables by the window. The chairs are gorgeous and the view is great (Central Park and the Plaza). I love visiting here every time I come to New York. It never ceases to be phenomenal from the service to the food.

The lobster salad was also really good as well.I opted for the pastrami spiced salmon as my entree, which was really left field. The spices weren't as strong as i would have liked, but it was ok.

My mother got a special chicken crepe with truffle, and my dad and I got the crab cake salad. We enjoyed it very much, our spot was super cosy and intimate. My one thought is that our salads only had one crab cake, and while larger than most I've eaten (and clearly it was high quality ingredients), for the price ($30+) it was a little bit of a rip, even for super ""New York"" experiences. as someone who is from here, I was a little surprised despite knowing that obviously this visit would cost more than it should.

I was excited to experience the cuisine they offer.I came here for a late lunch with a date. The ambiance gave me an Alice in Wonderland vibe. Large domed chairs line the edges of the restaurant, and the rest is organized, orderly, and posh. Ask to be seated by the window. The view over Central Park, and a busy 5th avenue is beautiful. The drinks here are very good. I tried 2 different drinks, and both were refreshing and tasty. Sadly, I forget the names of the cocktails. I had the Gotham Salad to start. I was unfortunately unimpressed. I wasn't a fan of the beets and the ham in the salad. It didn't have the flavor I was expecting. I didn't finish it. Then followed a roasted chicken dish. It was better. Nothing to really boast about, but good. I definitely enjoyed it, but it wasn't memorable.The service was forgettable. The hostess was nice, but our waiter wasn't very warm and welcoming. Overall, a pretty decent lunch and dinner spot to be seen in with the trendy, and wealthy people of New York. 3 stars for the ambiance, the view, the tasty chicken, and drinks.

We have gotten in without a reservation and usually isn't a problem, but they encourage to make a reservation on their website. Tea time is quite nice. They give a great selections of tea sandwiches, desserts, and petit fours. Also they have a nice selections of teas. Lunchtime is delicious too. The lobster salad is so good. The last time I came I had the salmon and my friend had the lobster napoleon. Salmon was perfectly cooked and so was the lobster. However, the lobster had a piece of netting in the food. We ate the entree though and my friend didn't fret over it. But when the waiter noticed it, the manager came over and gave it to us on the house. Really superb service.",,,

Of course we wanted the amazing view (perfect for a good photo - see below)! The service was wonderful and was in close competition with the food. My friend and I got the soup, lobster Mac and cheese and the (to die for) gnocchi with an added side of spinach. Take the time to walk every floor of Bergdorf's, you won't regret coming here!",,,

Waiters are proper although they seem strict on servicing only the tables to which they're assigned. Enjoyed a few plates from each section of the menu:Beet Salad with coach farms goat cheese, mâche, red quinoa, walnut bread crouton, red wine-herb vinaigrette Mediterranean Plate - hummus, baba ghanoush, cucumber mint yogurt, warm pita bread Baby Kale and Brussels Sprout Salad - roasted butternut squash, marcona almonds, spicy candied ginger, cumin-honey vinaigrette Roasted Cauliflower entree with peperonata, spinach, caramelized pears, golden raisins, cornichon-caper-mustard aioli Sides: Simply Steamed Broccolini and Market Vegetables (mainly fennel)The BG dessert consisting of flourless hazelnut cake, white and dark chocolate mousse, raspberries, and caramel drizzle Everything tasted good (if not average) although the cauliflower is actually a dish I enjoyed and would love to have again. The portions of the starters and salads, sadly, are quite small (at least lighter than what I'm accustomed to or expected). The menu is standard, leaning more towards seafood and veggie options. This is a nice cafe-like white-tablecloth establishment to stop in while in the area.. more formal than the Plaza Food Hall.",1,,

Reservations are recommended and do ask for a seat by the window. I would come here once in a while to enjoy the 7th floor view that overlooks The Plaza Hotel and Grand Army Plaza Fountain.We had the Grilled Salmon (bomb.com!), Artichoke Soup (refreshing!) and Grilled Asparagus (Yum). Everything was cooked to perfection and the ingredients are top notch. A warning, it is pricy.It's a fun place to people watch and chat with your girls.

If lunch is more of a hobby than a meal to you, look no further than BG.There are very few restaurants that have the same kind of feel as BG Restaurant. It's a dying breed in a city that seems to be increasingly nonchalant about customer service. This place is nothing short of classy and I recommend everyone to give it a shot. Much better than I'd expect from a restaurant in a department store, but that's Bergdorf Goodman for you.All of the staff and the manager are very friendly. Everyone always greets you kindly.

Drinks took a while, and our appetizers came out first, which was odd.Food: Butternut squash soup was great, bread was delicious, drinks were fine.Overall this restaurant was just okay for the prices.

This restaurant is rather classy, situated on the 7th floor of Bergdorf Goodman overlooking Central Park. The interior decor has a hints elegance and daintiness at the same time. They have these really cute blue cocoon chairs - if you want to be seated in them, make sure to add that in the note when booking your reservation. The afternoon tea is fixed price at $45/person. It came with your choice of hot tea in a teapot, tea sandwiches, scones, fruit preserves, and a few more petite sweets. I enjoyed the tea sandwiches the most. Didn't try the fruit preserves, the scones were alright as I'm not a big fan of them anyways to begin with, and some chocolate covered sweets. I will consider coming back here for a special occasion. I would say the price isn't worth it - I've had better afternoon tea with this concept elsewhere for a fraction of the price. Of course, this is the price one will have to dish out for the atmosphere and view. P.S. I also want to note there were some very annoying small fruit flies flying around our food we had to swat away during our time here.",3,,

I went with a friend just to ""check-out"" the tea service and I mean wow!! Everything was beautiful, the set up, the finger sandwiches and scones, ALL of it. Our waiter was really helpful in suggesting a tea both my and I enjoyed (Jardin Bleu). I thought I knew a little something about teas but his suggestion did end up tasting better than my selection. The sandwiches now were super cute, everything was cut small and two of everything was served needless to say it was all good. I thought this place was wonderful to show my mom she raised me right (in other words that i have good taste). The service was as expected, attentive and super nice not in an annoying always interrupting your conversation type of way. Highly recommend.",,,
48,Marc P.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,25,7,2.0,11/5/2017,I had eaten here about 5 years ago and I remembered it as being excellent. Today we went there at 1 for lunch. We were both very disappointed with the food and the service. We both ordered soup. One was the cauliflower and  one the chicken vegetable. Both soups had no taste at all. The chicken soup was actually greasy. Our beverages took far too long to arrive. For entrees we had the Pennsylvania roast chicken and it had no Taste and no seasoning. We alsoHad the Asian chicken salad which was ok. Not great but not as bad as the soups and the roast chicken. On a positive note the restaurant has a busy energetic vibe. It's a beautiful place. I just hopeThe food can once again be tasty and the service better.,,,

Bergdorf definitely lives up to its reputation as a fancy establishment.I came here for afternoon tea with a girlfriend on Saturday around 3pm. The tea and champagne were great, but the food was not. The sandwiches were stale and the sweets were nothing special. The scones were probably the best thing we had but I've had better scones at other tea rooms.For what we paid (over $60pp with tax & tip) it wasn't really worth it. I am a huge fan of high tea - but this place just wasn't my favorite. It's a decent one-time experience to have, but I wouldn't go back.

Definitely not the luxurious experience I expect from one of my tea spots.",1,1,1
52,A N.,"New York, NY",8,22,31,3.0,1/2/2017,"Never had afternoon tea here but this used to be my go to spot for catching up with friends. Going off of taste and presentation, the desserts here are well worth the money and incredibly decadent. You can't go wrong with any of the choices really but I remember the chocolate ones being particularly memorable. Also, the tea here is unbelievably fragrant and delicious. So why have I stopped going? Well, food is only one aspect of my dining experience when I make the decision to patronise a business. During my last visit, I noticed that BG Restaurant is seriously lacking in good table service and manners. The shortened anecdote includes a smarmy waiter who decided to snidely remark on what the guests ordered and then came back again later to comment on how the guests were consuming the food. Mind you, there were no children at the table and no one ate with their fingers or even remotely in a manner that warranted such remarks. How someone like this can work in the service industry at a high end restaurant is truly beyond me. I love your desserts and teas, BG. But they aren't worth the the experience of having to endure a waiter like this.",2,,

Afternoon tea includes a three tiered plate. The first tier includes a variety of sandwiches. They were ok, nothing amazing. They included cheese, eggs, and salmon. The second tier included scones, jam, and clotted cream. The clotted cream was my favorite part of the meal. It paired really nicely with the scones. Lastly the top tier was the dessert section. It included a mini macaroon, cupcake and fruit tart. Again the desserts were good but not spectacular.  It's definitely not a filling lunch if thats what you were going for.

Comfortable seating.  No TV.  No loud music (actually, no background music at all).Minuses:  There's actually nothing special about their High Tea: no tea cozies, no sugar bowl, no mini serving utensils, no fresh cream, no fresh scones, no fresh flower, no classic porcelain, it's all pretty ordinary.  The sandwiches, scones and petit fours were nothing special, either, and it's actually less in quantity than what other places serve for high tea.  Bathrooms were down the hall and were not kept clean on a busy Saturday afternoon.  One toilet never stopped flushing, another had a leak on the floor.If it's your first time for High Tea, this restaurant is probably fine, but compared to many other places that we've been to, it's really worth less.",1,,

There is a partial view of Central Park, but the restaurant is large and has walls of windows that provide lots of light. My server was Luke and the service was excellent!!

I called on the day of to make a reservation for 2 at 3:30 on a Friday afternoon, but it's definitely not necessary as there were still quite a lot of empty seats when we arrived.I think the biggest downside to Bergdorf is that there is no variation in the tea sets, so you can't customize what finger sandwiches you want. The set is standard either with champagne or without champagne. We chose the latter ($45/person). For the tea itself, there is a selection of about 10 different types of teas. My friend chose the lemon green tea, which she really liked, while I chose the Sri Lankan vanilla black tea (decaf), which I thought wasn't strong enough in the vanilla flavoring.We started with our savories on the bottom tier. Luckily, I was very impressed with finger sandwich selection (turkey, chicken, tuna, salmon, cucumber, prosciutto, egg), but if you're very picky, then you might feel a bit constrained here by the set menu. My absolute favorite was the middle tier: the SCONES with clotted cream, strawberry jam, apricot jam, and honey. So delicious. The worse part was there's only one scone per person.Finally, the top tier was the sweets: chocolates, mini tarts, and macarons.

It starts from 3pm on the weekends.  If there are only 2 in your party - you may get a window table which looks over 5th Avenue and the Plaza. Definitely worth asking for this as it adds to the occasion. Made reservations a week in advance and came here for afternoon tea at with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. High Tea - For $42 each, you each get a pot of tea, an amazing selection of egg, tuna and salmon with caviar sandwiches, warm scones with clotted cream, a selection on jams, and to top it off - an assortment of cakes and macaroons. The tea sandwiches were great; the scone was delicious, as were the French macaroons. The presentation was perfect; all items were served on a three tier platter.The restaurant is beautifully decorated with an old-school charm - not flashy at all just elegant. Great view overlooking the skyline and Central ParkIt was a great 1.5 hour spent with my friend catching up on a cold day in NYC. It came out to be $50 per person after tax and tip.

Not your average fancy either. You are surrounded by fancy older women with nothing, but designer from head to toe. I love fancy, and I own Chanels as well, but I did feel a bit uncomfortable, maybe because of the age difference? Seriously felt like I was dining first class on the Titanic or something.I made a reservation about 2 months prior heading out to the big city. Once arrived I was seated right away so kudos there. For starters I ordered the deviled eggs priced at $14.00. Main dishes consisted of ahi tuna salad $32.00 and braised beef short ribs $42.00. I understand this is Bergdorf Goodman here, however none of these dishes are worth the ridiculous prices. Deviled eggs came out with 2 eggs cut in halves, but the sizes of the eggs were literally a extra small size. No joke. The best is suppose to be the bacon on top, right? Not really in this case. It came with ONE TINY PIECE of bacon on top. Nothing was special about the ahi tuna salad except the seasoning was pretty good on the fish itself. Braised beef short ribs came out very tender with spinach under, but still nothing special.Total for this ridiculous lunch came out to be $94 something, right under $100. Like I said, maybe my appetite is just too big for this place, but seriously having dined all over high end restaurants in Los Angeles, this place is a NO in my books. 1 extra star because afterall it is part of an amazing department store for all your bougie label whore needs.",5,7,3

I mean, you certainly aren't paying $$$ to get a sub-par experience.I took my parents here while they were visiting NYC. I wanted someplace where my mom could get her elegant afternoon tea meal but also have options for my dad, who isn't fond of such delicate fare.We ordered afternoon tea for my mom and I. Our tea tray had no salmon sandwiches!! Everyone else who ordered afternoon tea got them. I know, because I looked around. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? Instead, we were given double the amount of tuna sandwiches. Salmon sandwiches are like, standard on afternoon tea service. Our server also realized that, because he was telling us about the food on the tray. Instead of acknowledging the mistake, he quickly pretended like it didn't matter. NOT OKAY. I didn't want to create an awkward situation in front of my parents so I didn't say anything. But that was NOT COOL.My dad ordered ""Lobster Napoleon"" which is like a fancy lobster lasagna. It was quite tasty, but not worth the $36 for a layer of lobster sandwiched between two flat noodles. Our server was very nice and friendly. But the service was super slow, the restaurant way too chaotic and crowded, and completely overpriced. My parents had a good time, but I know better than to come again.",10,1,1
79,Kaitlin N.,"Manhattan, NY",300,36,16,4.0,2/11/2016,"When I heard my Anglophile younger sister and mother were both visiting for a weekend, I immediately started researching Sunday afternoon tea services. My younger sister spent some time in London so she has somewhat particular standards for tea.The setting: absolutely adorable. If you are in a group of two, request the ""whisper"" chairs. They look straight out of a Newport mansion living room. Our party of three was too large for those tables, but they sat us right next to the window which has a really beautiful view.The tea includes your pick of about 7 teas. I ordered the ""Nuit à Versailles"" which was really lovely. Then they bring out a tray with a scone, an assortment of tea sandwiches, and an assortment of desserts. Overall the food was very good, but not incredible. I think the real enjoyment is from the experience, which they absolutely nail.The scone, however, was a total standout. Very grainy.Overall, it was enough food that I was stuffed for the full afternoon and my mom couldn't even finish hers!",1,,
80,Ella B.,"Manhattan, NY",287,168,51,2.0,10/6/2015,"It's a beautiful restaurant- love the ambiance. I've been here plenty of times but I'm in shock how slow the service was. We literally waited half an hour for two salads- our coffee was never refilled until we had to ask twice. Btw, my coffee cup had lipstick stains- GROSS. Finally when my salad came, I found hair in my salad. Why is this happening to me?! I asked my server to take the salad back and she asked if I would like another one. I said it would take another half an hour to get it so I said no thanks. Obviously I lost my appetite. She said it would take two seconds- hey if it only takes two seconds, why did it take so long to chop it out in the first place?!I mean, I expect nothing but the best from BG and this experience was definitely a negative one. I don't think I will be coming back here anytime soon.",6,3,2

Our best friend-on-another-ship is defined by foods- and all the moments of dining we share together. She took me here on a surprise whim. And it was a truly beautiful experience. Bergdorf  Goodman's does tea time like no other. Service, decor, and the view atop of Central Park is breathtaking. (Hint (to bae's future hubby): propose to her here.) The tea sandwiches, the pastries, and tea itself were amazing. And the clotted cream- this is the definition of a good tea place- in all the little details. We stayed here so long that we even skipped into an evening meal. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious- namely the Scallops with truffle shaving  and cheese ravioli. If you want to impress your girlfriend or if you also have a bae to feed, bring them here. They will never leave your side, as I'll never leave bae's.",2,,1
82,Jennifer M.,"Montclair, NJ",787,835,3585,3.0,9/21/2015,"Recently visited the BG Restaurant with a friend for High Tea.This place for high tea was just a passing grade. The appeal is all there. The restaurant is beautifully decorated. Had I wished I had sat in one of their French Porter chairs when I had visited, but there were only three or four sets of tables with them and they were all taken. Fixed at $42.00 dollars per person, you had your choice of tea, along with a set of sandwiches, scones, and dessert, rationed for the amount of people eating high tea crumpets at your table for the afternoon. Sadly, our tower of treats had two of each savory item, but didn't apply for the dessert items. Most of sandwiches (Turkey, Tuna, Chicken, and Egg) came on the same type of bread, which my friend and I thought was a snore. The egg, and turkey could have used salt and pepper. Each item could have used some sort of mustard or cheese just to change up flavor. The desserts were a little too sweet, but the scones actually were tasty. Although a piece of my heart wanted to the scones to be served warm. Having looked at all the other dishes served to the other tables, I would have done proper lunch rather than high tea. It's simply not their calling.",6,2,3

We got one seated at a quiet corner with fancy arm chairs. Our waiter was decent, he wished me happy birthday but he looked impatient when he was waiting for us to make up our minds on the tea selection.It took a really long time for our teas and desserts to come. (we made reservation days ahead so I expect them to prep our order in advance) We ordered two different kinds of tea and to our surprise, they tested the same. I had the versailles (peachy flowery tea) and he had the lemongrass something. I don't understand how they tasted the same. Plus, the tea was only lukewarm. I was looking for sugar on our table and guess what we weren't give any tea spoons when our waiter served us our tea. He did come by at the end and ask how are things but I didn't feel like telling him we weren't happy with our tea. The dessert/sandwiches are just okay. They look better than they actually taste. I am a vegetarian so I couldn't eat most of the sandwiches they offer there. They gave me a candle on top of the cake tower, which was nice. Overall, I've had better afternoon teas at more low-key places. The environment is nice here but if you really want to enjoy a good afternoon tea, I would not suggest this place. (See my other reviews on tea houses in NYC)",2,,

Beautiful and upscale interior, excellent service, prime location with nice view of Central Park and delicious little treat to accompany your tea. Nuit a Versailles was my choice and I was pleased with it. The server even surprised us with complimentary creme brûlée and chocolate mousse for our special occasions (so nice!). I took away one star,  because for 45 /person I would have loved a glass of champagne or smth to accompany the tea and tower. The portions of tea sandwiches were super small albeit delicious) Will still revisit this place when I get the chance, just for the atmosphere and experience.",,,1

Inevitably I end up at the cafeteria below to grab a bite. The pretty cafe with sweeping Central Park views, amazing beet salads, beef salads, croque monsieur and raspberry iced teas! It has a charming old world quality to its decor and vibe. At first I was irritated that they wouldn't deliver upstairs (to the salon). Living in Manhattan you get very spoiled and want everything to be delivered. But later I realized the experience was worth the effort! of taking the elevator two floors down to this lovely room. Service is gracious, hospitable and efficient. Oh and the raspberry iced tea is out of this world!",5,3,4

For a nice restaurant, they are over-staffed but the servers are not very attentive. Me and my friend had afternoon tea there, we all agreed that the sandwiches must have been set aside for a while because the bread is so dry. However, the scone is Amazing! Wish we could just get the scone and nothing more! The top shelf's dessert is not impressive either. Overall, we r disappointed. Maybe we anticipate too much???",1,,

Five star view which you can glimpse central park, I took away one star, or probably should be half as some of the food was not at the amazing level.Sandwich was as good as it can get, and I especially liked the tuna one with caviar. scones were good but not great, probably because when we got to the second level, they were already kinda cold. Macarons were always my favorate, so hard not to give a unbiased view here.As the afternoon tea was fixed, the only option provided will be the tea part. Venilla tea that I have got smelled with the true venilla flavor, yet was a bit too light...Anyway focusing more on the view, you will be more satisfied!",,,

Lox with cream cheese and caviar on top was delicious. I love that they also included a blueberry scone. The rest of the sandwiches/pastries was forgettable. The restaurant is on the 7th floor so the view is not something I would be back for but the interior is really cute. Overall, it's a very nice place to have a chat and treat yourself to tea or champagne. The service is ok, professional I guess. The crowd is quite mixed and you can spot quite a few fashionistas.

91,Dominique N.,"Manhattan, NY",544,19,31,3.0,9/13/2015,"Brought my mom here from out of town, because she wanted to have afternoon tea with me after I talked on and on about how great it was in London (see my other review if interested). In short, I'm gonna say ""meh."" To be fair, I haven't had much experience with other places in New York when it comes to afternoon or high tea, but having had my standards raised in London, it's hard to go back.First off, the decor. If you're a party of two and request to sit near the windows, you might be seated in the whispering chairs (?) which are two cute seats overlooking a great view from the 7th floor of the department store. I'll give them points for that, along with their cute plates and utensils, but beyond that...can't really praise them to the high heavens. The carpet is pretty dirty, and some parts of the room just look a little overused. I might expect this at another place, but Bergdorf? Surprising.Moving on to the price and the food, since my mom doesn't drink, we just ordered the standard tea service which I believe was $42 a person. For the value, I'm going to say not worth it. While I really enjoyed my tea, and most of the sandwiches, I found some to be dry, and the desserts not impressive. The scone was good, but not great. The deal breaker for me was that there was no milk to be found. Of course, the waiter was more than happy to provide milk, but this is afternoon tea. WHERE'S THE MILK?Also, when I was in Europe, you could re-order the sandwiches to your own delight! Is it not the same way here? Maybe I'm just ignorant, but like I said, it's hard for me to be generous with my review since I can say I've had much better for around the same price point. Service was friendly, and quick, as expected.Would I come back here? I guess. But first, I think I'll try the tea over at the plaza.",2,,

Disclaimer - We only had high tea & the review would have been 3-4 stars if the service was elevated.  Ambiance - The dining room was immaculate with views of central park and open spaces.  The china was beautiful and the table was set so delicately.  Food & Tea - The finger sandwiches were good.  There was a variety and I particularly enjoyed the turkey sesame. The scones were a bit dry for my taste and I would have preferred them sans cranberry. The Devonshire cream was delicious and paired well with the variety of jams presented.  There was PLENTY of food and treats and we took some to go as we couldn't finish it all.Service - We mentioned the air was a bit cold and they said they would fix it, they never did.  We asked for hot milk and by the time it was brought out the tea was cold. We asked for our check and we were SUSHED. I am sorry, we are not paying for high tea to be shushed.  Then when our bill was dropped off they dropped it off with so many attitudes, for no reason at all.  What did we see when we got the bill? Gratuity was included so they obviously didn't care about the service their patrons received.  Bergdorfs did a great job with the ambiance, and scenery but their service really weighed down my rating.  I only hope it was a fluke because the real life princess seated behind us was in distress over her table seating so the staff was more concerned with that.

The department store is on 5th Avenue and 58th StreetParking:As I am a NYC newbie I have no idea where you would park. As I was walking in my now ruined Valentino rockstud pumps trying to find the damn place...I walked by a parking structure that I believe is used for Bergdorf, & Trump on 58th street. Honestly take a Uber, taxi, subway whatever. I don't know how people drive in NYC I would of ran over all pedestrians at this point.Decor/Ambience:Well ladies and gents this is Bergdorf Goodman so be prepared to see bags worth more than your children's college education and noses set higher than the World Trade Center! That being said it's definitely a scene I'm accustomed to but if you aren't...who cares right!The decor reminds me of going through the catalog for Horchow and how they always set the bedrooms in this very colorful yet classy state with chandeliers and bold chairs that create a color statement. Yup it's really pretty and definitely a place I wouldn't mind bringing my grandma to.Afternoon Tea:So I made my reservation so I could be seated at precisely 3pm when Afternoon Tea is scheduled to begin. I was seated by the window on the most comfortable and cutest chairs with a view of the Central Park and the all the wonderful traffic! They have 2 different options: $42 per person for regular tea service or $60 per person for tea service with Rosé Brut. I opted for the regular because I am not trying to be walking around these streets in my once wonderful heels drunk. The tray was assorted with delicious sandwiches and honestly it fills you up when you eat everything and drink the tea. (Sorry for no pictures guys I was so hungry and lonely with my nice view of the people below)They had 3 tea sandwiches which was tuna with various garnishes. Some had dried cranberries which were delicious and 1 had basil on top and another had egg and onions. There was a small single bite of rye bread with caviar and smoked salmon. And a small but absolutely delicious bite of a tart bowl filled with cream cheese and bits of salmon. The deserts were so good and honestly I didn't even chew them like a lady should. They were so delicious I just devoured then ALL!  For my tea I choose they Nuit á Versailles which went perfectly with my sandwiches and desserts. It was the perfect amount of herbal and fruity notes and I couldn't have chosen a better tea choice honestly.  If you are going to be entering this store ever...you must come up to the restaurant and have the afternoon tea!!Yelp 100 2015 Challenge - 18/100",11,9,9

I have to say, this restaurant had the nicest seats I have ever sat in. It was a royal-type of seat, that made customers feel like kings and queens. The food was very nice, and the service was great. I saw a lot of locals that frequently came here, because I heard bartenders speaking to customers as if they knew them, which was really nice. This restaurant is situated on the top floor, so you have great views of Manhattan. It's the environment that really catches peoples' eyes. I have to say, the music was great.

It is as elegant and luxurious as anything else at Bergdorf, and the food is exceptional. Try the tuna tartare as a starter, and if you're new to this restaurant chances are you should order the Lobster Napoleon as a main course; it's a signature dish, and popular for good reason. If you'd like a lighter option, the cod is exceptionally tasty too!  Reservations are a very, very good idea.

The space was too cramped, loud, and it was obvious the waiters were [really] stressed out. It took us even a few minutes just to get a hold of the host. You get off the elevator on the 7th floor and see a tiny restaurant with gorgeous/sweeping views of Central Park -- so, make sure to ask for a window seat when you make reservs. ALSO: This is the kind of place where you're almost guaranteed to see Anna Wintour or Marc Jacobs lunching. This is also the kind of place where people wear their sunglasses inside the restaurant. #fashioncrowdOverall: I'd go on a weekday in the winter or something to avoid the crowd.

My sister and I were seated by the window overlooking Central Park -  such a pretty little view. We loved the decor, but you can kind of see that things were getting a bit old if you really paid attention. I got the grilled chicken salad and my sister got the smoked salmon nicoise. Both were good! Portions were just right especially since we were already kind of stuffed from munching on their complimentary bread basket. Very fancy schamcy atmosphere and the staff were very nice and attentive. Not sure if this would be my go to place when I visit NYC, but coming here was definitely a fun experience.",1,1,

The sandwiches were great, but the sweets were just average.  The Bernardaud china was lovely. I love Bernardaud china.Unfortunately, the service was terrible. They forgot about us most of the time.

Just appears that more people tend to go here after shopping/ without reservation so there is always a line.) Afternoon tea was $35/person which included lots of sandwiches, scones and desserts with a pot of tea. Everything was delicious. I have been here a couple times and could never finish all my food.

123,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",140,352,290,3.0,9/20/2015,"I think the biggest pro about this place is that it isn't as popular as other afternoon tea places.  I know this because we tried to get last minute reservations at several other places and had to settle on here because they actually had availability.  Location is very good with the proximity to Central Park and shopping, both on-site and surrounding.That said, the vibe still manages to be touristy.  Like everyone around us was speaking another language or English with an accent.  This was an ""experience"" for them I realized possibly on their checklist of things to do while they were in New York.  It was rather noisy actually.The afternoon tea experience here isn't memorable or that good.  It isn't bad either, but just okay.  The view is . . . a seventh floor view of Central Park.The sandwiches tasted slightly stale, the sweets bought from somewhere, and the scone wasn't warm.  The tea was week as I had the whole pot and felt nothing.  I ate everything and left hungry and had dinner immediately afterwards.  It was a great girly place to catch up but it did feel too much like you were just in the restaurant of a department store.  It being Bergdorf Goodman didn't make it any more special like I had hoped.  The decor was just okay as well.  Way too modern.  I was almost disappointed on this front.  I had hoped to be blown away, but I must be turning into a jaded New Yorker to not have been impressed by the afternoon tea, food or decor.  It was't bad, but just not memorable enough for me to want to come here again when there are so many other options I much prefer in the city.On a positive note, the china was nice and the server was polite.  And they don't rush you in the least even after several hours, which is a sign of a classy place.  Decorum is observed and the patrons were well dressed which I appreciated.",1,,1

127,Beverly P.,"Washington, DC",29,7,170,1.0,5/16/2016,"I usually don't write reviews, but our experience here left such a bad taste in my mouth that I feel compelled to. Everything was going well (courteous server, splendid view, good drinks), until we got our entrees. My boyfriend ordered a combination dish of braised short ribs and filet mignon, which he specifically asked to be cooked medium rare. When they brought the filet, it was well done. We told our server about it and he took the entire dish away (including the unfinished short ribs and the sides) apologizing and saying the kitchen will fix it. A few minutes later, a manager came out claiming he didn't understand the problem and asking if my boyfriend wanted the steak cooked a bit more. Uhmmm, what? It was WELL DONE and almost charred to a crisp on the outside and basically inedible and you're asking if he wants it cooked a bit more? Did you think he wanted to eat charcoal for lunch?! Anyway, we again patiently explained the problem and he went back to the kitchen, again promising to fix the problem. The manager then came back out and apologized, but explained that the chef REFUSED to do anything about it because, in her expert view (I mean, how much of an expert is she really if she can't tell the different between medium rare and well done?!), the steak was fine as is. Again, uhmmmm WHAT?! So if your chef already knows how she wants YOUR CLIENTS to eat their steak, WHY ASK THEM FOR THEIR PREFERENCE in the first place?! What kind of ""fine dining"" establishment are you running?! The manager again apologized and promised my boyfriend they wouldn't charge him for the dish (because basically he ate nothing as they took the entire plate away) because he just ""wants to make him happy."" So, the bill came and the $45 dish was there. Unlike this establishment, we had way too much class to argue about this and went ahead and just paid the entire bill (plus 20% tip because why should the server suffer for their HORRIBLE CHEF WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING). My boyfriend has a lot of pride and generally doesn't like to make a fuss about things, so when he brought the INEDIBLE STEAK to their attention, even that was already too much for him. They made a huge deal about it and the entire episode was just embarassing. How ironic that a restaurant that puts on airs and purports to exude elegance and class could handle a customer service issue in such a tacky manner. This place used to be one of my go-to places whenever I was in NYC because of the view and the afternoon tea service, but because of this fiasco, I will NEVER AGAIN come here. For anyone who wants to have autonomy over what they want to eat, this place is not for you. If you want a TACKY CHEF who wants to shove her terrible, tasteless food down your throat and expect you not to complain about it, then come here. You'll be in for a rude awakening.",10,1,1

It was a tight squeeze into the elevator to the 7th floor, and when we got out at the restaurant we realized that it's because this is apparently THE place to see and be seen at Central Park South.As we enjoyed our salmon (perfectly roasted, with celery root puree, crispy brussels sprouts and chorizo) and lobster salad (a beautiful, if smallish portion), we also enjoyed watching a parade of feathered hats, leopard stoles and leather gloves as the cartoonishly well-dressed patrons sat down to eat lunch.For dessert, we had the cardamom panna cotta (so rich that a few bites was plenty for each of us) and the gourmet chocolates (tiny, but plenty of them). Skip the passionfruit tea, as it's really just tart tea mixed with even tarter juice. Service was prompt, although good luck flagging down the server if you are in a rush.

We decided to have a quick bite at BG restaurant. We have dined there many times over the years and had impeccable  seating service. However, on this day, upon entering the restaurant, the African American hostess did not greet us or smile. We stood there and asked for a table for 2. Simultaneously, an African American bald headed male rushed to seat us at a table in the bar area which was noisy. We asked to be seated in a quiet area of the restaurant. We mentioned an area that we are familiar with. He rudely said in a condescending tone ""That is reserved."" We know that BG does not hold any particular seat but accept reservations. We have been a BG cardholder for twenty years. We have never been treated in this manner. We left the premises. By the way, we are mature African Americans. A word to the wise.

Location: overlooks Central Park and right next to the plaza hotel on the 7th floor of the Bergdorf Goodman store.Resturant decor is beautiful! Shout out to our gracious host Vincent he was from San Diego and gave us a beautiful table with gorgeous chairs. It was 2 of us for tea $45.00 each, the tea tray comes with different sandwiches, scones, and dessert. I forgot the tea names but we had a lemon one and a Versailles tea- both were very good, perfect temperature and full of flavor. We were both pretty full at the end. The sandwiches were very good- there was a chicken with cranberry, egg salad, small tarts one with caviar. We split the scones and the desserts but honestly we were pretty full and didn't eat a few of them.

He was always available, like my very own dutiful butler for the duration of the meal.  For tea we ordered gout russe and jardin blue.  The teas were both light with a hint of fruit.  We had the tea service royale which comes with champagne  and it's $60 per person.  Our teas and goodies came promptly.  There were 3 tiers and the bottom is a sampling of different tea sandwiches...the classic watercress sandwich, egg salad, cucumber, chicken salad, turkey, smoked salmon with caviar and some kind of puffed pastry. The sandwiches were okay...they weren't really anything that you would rave home to about.  The second tier which had the cranberry scones, clotted cream, and assorted jams and honey was the piece de resistance! Those were the best darn scones I have ever had! I'm not big on scones but gosh darn it I wish there was more than 2.  Surprisingly the little sandwiches and scones were actually very filling and by the time we got to the 3rd tier which had macarons and little bit size cakes, we were stuffed and couldn't eat another bite.The ambiance is definitely cute and chic. We were seated by the window so we had a beautiful view of Central Park. Unfortunately we did not get to sit on the egg chairs..maybe next time.  Dining here is definitely an experience.  This is a place where you can see how the ""other half"" live.  On my right was this extremely chic older woman with a bouffant and wearing head to toe Chanel and on my left were very fashionable women toting around Hermes bags and wearing Fendi scarves.  There were a sprinkling of tourists also.  The dress code here is fashionable, so if you want to be treated well don't come here in a t-shirt and flip flops...unless you're a celebrity.Will definitely come here again to check out their lunch and dinner menu.",5,,4

151,DJ Z.,"Philadelphia, PA",3,16,85,4.0,2/21/2013,"Food is ordinary but you are paying for convenience, good atmosphere, and service. For all those reasons, definitely make a reservation because this area is tourist central. When my friend and I arrived at 4pm (which I thought would be down time), the restaurant was packed. I previously made a reservation for two so we were seated as soon as we arrived. My friend and I opted for the $35 per person afternoon tea service. There is also a $50 per person option that is the exact same set but adds a glass of Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label Brut NV. Tea:Since price is on a per person basis, each person gets their own pot of tea. I defaulted to Earl Grey. Service was attentive and offered more hot water when my tea ran out.Food:The tray comes in three levels (top to bottom):- Muffins, brownies, and petite sweets.- Macarons, cranberry scones, devonshire cream, and fruit preservatives.- Mini sandwiches, smoked salmon on toast, cheese on toast.Keep in mind the selection varies from day to day so you may not get this specific combination. All the sandwiches were simple and decent. The scones were warm, which was a minor but nice touch. The top level of sweets wasn't anything spectacular; that was the only level we did not finish.The service was really great from beginning to end. We had a few servers come by to check on us throughout even though our table was relatively low maintenance. The food was ordinary but this place provides a great atmosphere and you are really paying for the experience. It is definitely worth trying once if you are shopping on 5th.",5,,

I'll include pictures of the view that we had while dining. My friend and I split the lobster mac and cheese, which was yummy but a bit too rich to be an appetizer, I had the salmon while she had the chicken, and we had the banana split as a dessert. The salmon was big, delicious, perfectly seasoned and seared, and I was definitely stuffed by the end of the meal. We were here on a Saturday afternoon, which meant that it was filled with ladies who just wanted a shopping break, like my friend and I. They ordered sandwiches and salads, all of which looked good as it passed by our table. The salmon itself was a huge piece of fish, with pickled cucumbers and I think it was some sort of Mediterranean plum? There was a spicy sauce on the side which complimented the fish well, it was delicious and light. The waiter was friendly and attentive, and he even gave us some of his personal recommendations, which we took and were glad that we agreed to take his suggestions. The ability to sit by the windows with the cute chairs definitely helped start out the service into a great meal and a solid lunch. I'll be returning soon with the hopes of having high tea!",,,

Many people were dressed up for tea so have fun with it and put on your floral print dresses and heels!",3,,

Here are some tips:- make reservations in advance, because this place is crowded!!- be on time!! (at least 1 person from the party)- The restaurant is on 7th floor of the storeFood and service were great! Two of us got the afternoon tea that comes in 3 tiers that includes mini sandwiches, scones and little sweets + tea. I got the lobster salad, which was delicious!! What a nice place to enjoy elegant food with a nice view. Although everything was good and to the point, i was disappointed with a couple of things. 1) We sat next to the mirror wall, and the mirror was dirty and had lots of random stains... 2) the water glasses looks cloudy like with some residue. I would expect that such a nice fancy place with $40/pp for tea would pay attention to little details like this. There goes 1 star off the review.",2,,1
158,Michelle T.,"Costa Mesa, CA",783,999,1157,4.0,5/8/2015,I was very excited to try the high tea service here. I made a reservation on open table and added a note to be sat by the window.  They did exactly that. The tea itself was delicious. I forgot the name of the tea I got but it had yummy notes of berries. The window overlooked central park. The tiers of finger sandwiches  and pastries were good but not out of this world. The tea was the high point of the experience. It was around $45 for the high tea without the champagne. It's a great place to try once in the iconic Bergdof Goodman.,,,

We were running a little late, and called ahead, and they were happy to accomodate our 15 min delay. The interior is tasteful and luxurious and not over the top!! I sat facing the mirrored wall, but could see the gorgeous reflection of Central Park!I got the Asian style salad with filet mignon; forget the name. The steak was perfectly cooked and I liked the balance of crunch with the other veggies (cabbage, etc). I'm not sure if I would get it again, as it was $37, but fit my desire for salad and steak! The breadbasket had lots of options too. The best best part of the whole experience was the amazing service and to top it off we were given a small 'gift-certificate' for later shopping that day, which was a very pleasant (and I imagine somewhat unusual) surprise. . so this could happen to you too.Be sure to book in advance if you want to go at peak times!",,,1

162,Arlene M.,"Pittsburgh, PA",484,973,4398,4.0,6/23/2013,I fell in love with this restaurant a couple of visits ago. Being from out of town it reminded me of the old style restaurants that we had when I was younger that were near the top of the department store.I've only eaten there for lunch but have never been disappointed with my choices. As a matter of fact I usually end it with a delicious dessert! It is a bit pricy but not more than I would expect to pay at a fine establishment such as Bergdorf Goodman. The restaurant is small but does get crowded for lunch so I would highly suggest making a reservation.I had been fortunate to have a window seat where I could see what appeared to be the entrance to Central Park and a lovely fountain below.The floor where it sits on is decorated in the art deco style with pictures that reminded me of yesteryear.I loved eating here during the holidays since the holiday merchandise is on the same floor and I can just go shopping afterwards.I would definitely recommend this place.,,,
163,Enzo M.,"New York, NY",0,35,21,1.0,1/2/2015,"Brought my family who were visiting from out of town for the holidays.  This was our second choice since the Mandarin Oriental was fully committed.  Brevity is the most effective way of communication so here it goes:1) We were seated immediately even if we came a bit early.  CHECK.2) A few minutes after we were seated, Grant (our server. I think that's his name) asked us if we knew which tea we wanted knowing that we didn't have enough time to go over the menu. WANT TO CHECK BUT CAN'T.3) Sandwiches and pastries came before the tea which arrived 10 mins later.  Shouldn't the tea come first or at least the same?  WANT TO CHECK BUT CAN'T.4) With a few pastries left the server asked us twice if the table may be cleared.  Clearly, the meal was not over yet.  We said not yet.  What's the rush?  WANT TO CHECK BUT CAN'T.5) After the third time the server asked us if we were done, we finally agreed though we did't think he would clear the plate of a guest who still had a pastry left and was in mid chew.  WANT TO CHECK BUT CAN'T.6) We were given the check and was asked if he can get it back seeing very well that we were in the process of signing it.  We shouldn't have signed.  WANT TO CHECK BUT CAN'T.7) Spoke to the manager at that time, an extremely professional gentleman of Asian decent (just in case you read this you know who you are) who apologised profusely and promised to open the bill and reverse the charges.  CHECK.While it is true that Manhattan has more diners than seats available, the arrogance of BG Restaurant is not just distasteful, it is downright reprehensible.  Not only will we not return, we will discourage anyone who would like to go....at least not when our server is on shift.  Go to The Plaza, The Ritz or The Mandarin Oriental.  You'll get what you pay for.",1,,

Wanted to try their high tea menu but figured a salad was more appropriate. I was sitted by the window which gave me a very nice view of the street! The waiter was very patient and informative.

It's the perfect tourist spot with a beautiful view of Central Park and unique majestic decor which was recently redone.  The food is typically quite good but definitely on the pricey side especially for lunch. I don't recommend the Mediterranean Tuna salad simply because it tastes like canned tuna not poached tuna for $30!

166,V.

I don't understand all these people raving about the view on the park. Not many tables have it and honestly it's not that great of a view, the windows are small and what you see is basically Grand Army Plaza, few trees, and a lot of traffic. So don't bother going for that. The general decor of the dining room however is very very pretty, much more than the park. The service was very good, hostess and waiters were nice and attentive but not intrusive. I highly recommend making a reservation, it gets pretty packed (with beautiful fashion people ;) )",,,
167,Stace C.,"New York, NY",622,302,2086,3.0,10/6/2014,Meh. This review is for afternoon tea only. I've definitely tasted better. If it weren't for their service and ideal Central Park location and view I would've docked another star. Their afternoon tea sandwiches are honestly terrible in taste. This is being generous. The only thing they have going for them is their scones which I really enjoyed. They also did provide two types of jam and honey on top of butter which helped. Their tea selection is truly small. They should expand their list to at least carry jasmine. I wouldn't come back unless they revamp their menu especially since there are many other places in NYC that does afternoon better.,1,,

I used to be able to get a bottle in my local perfumery in Forest Hills, but they closed. Extremely pricey, but what do you expect for 5th and 57th next to The Plaza. The cologne was $10 more here than in Queens, but, again, it's the flagship store in Manhatten.The gals behind the counter are sweethearts, and I kind of know them cause this is my go to store for my Moms perfume at Christmas.  Very helpful, always polite, and, I must say, for women in their 50's and 60's, kinda hot. Prices are through the roof. If you have two grand to drop on a blazer, stop by.  If not, go to Lord and Taylor's, Macy's or Men's Wearhouse and get the same high quality garment for a third or less of the cost.

When I asked for sugar, I was given sugar packets. Isn't this high tea? Where are my sugar cubes and tongs?And the food itself was not very good.If you really want to do tea, go to the Ritz Carlton.

The food, the ambiance, the winter wonderland views, and the service could not have been better. I had called a few days earlier to request whispering chair seating, and I recommend that you do the same. Even on a cold weekday, the place was packed! The restaurant is very elegantly decorated, with floral wallpaper and Tiffany-box-blue seats. The service was stuffy at the entrance, but Catherine, the wonderful woman who was my server, and her co-staff, were just wonderful! I couldn't decide between the afternoon tea or their regular menu, but I heard that their regular menu is a better bet. I had the lobster salad, which was exceptional! Huge, succulent pieces of lobster on delicate artisanal greens, celery, roasted red onion, grape tomatoes, and a generous portion of avocado were dressed with the perfect touch of champagne vinaigrette. The salad cost around $40 but was so worth it! I can't wait to have it again! You also get a generous serving of bread from Pain d'Avignon - their mini long rolls with picholine olives and rosemary are my absolute favorite! Dessert was a tray of their sweets - macarons, petit fours, and the lemon meringues in mini-shells were just delectable! With the check, you are treated to a taste of Charbonnel et Walker handmade English chocolate (since 1875!). Absolutely perfect lunch from start to finish, and it went by so fast! Staff will not rush you, but I didn't have enough time to really linger. Next time! Quick tip: don't confuse the restaurant with their dark basement cafe. Also, have fun dressing up! Take out that Gucci bag, the Prada sunglasses, and your darkest ruby-red lipstick; it's great to be alive!",2,,

Updated review","I was pleasantly surprised when a BG manager reached out to me after my previous experience and not-so-great review. She explained to me that they were indeed understaffed that day and the older gentleman who initially took our orders usually only works slow days/shifts and had come in on short notice to fill a gap. Completely unexpected, I was offered a comp-ed afternoon tea for two. I was impressed with the manager's honesty and willingness to accommodate my crazy schedule (which was for a date after she would be leaving BG). Our 2nd experience was much better than the first, in terms of service. I believe this is much more like their normal level based on my observation of the tables around us (and that we didn't get some super-special level of attention). The food is good but nothing phenomenal, which is par for the course as these afternoon tea tiers go. Our clotted cream was quite good and the server was patient in explaining various teas to my mom and helping us choose one she would like.TL;DR: Managers care about their rep and customer satisfaction. Compared to other afternoon teas in NYC, this one is consistent and in a lovely, if sometimes hectic, setting. It's a lovely oasis from the shopping outside and below.",,,1

I ordered the cookies for dessert with the french macarons (absolutely do NOT recommend. I would much rather take a cab to Laduree). I have not tried the afternoon tea here (I spent the entire summer in the UK and I am afraid I may be dissapointed). The server we had was very polite. The view is gorgeous. If you are ready to splurge, definitely come here. After the lobster macaroni and cheese, I was so full! I had nice chunks of lobster in mine as well.

183,Amy R.,"Lexington, KY",31,176,80,1.0,8/15/2015,"I'm spilling it. Right here, I'm spilling the dirty little secret that is Bergdorf Goodman Restaurant. IT IS NOT WORTH RIDING TO THE 7TH FLOOR FOR. I'd LOVE to know what these 5-Star raters are eating up there, because I sure as Santa know I didn't get a bite of it! We reserved for tea and arrived (and were seated) promptly. We were served by Eric, a nice enough young man. We chose our tea and were then served the tea and a triple layer tray of finger food. The sandwiches were stale and unsavory and I can't say anything nice about the rest, so I'll say nothing at all. Eric made a nice gesture in bringing my friend a complimentary cookie platter with a candle on it for his birthday. Thus, a star is born.Whatever I hoped to experience from the days of Jackie O. and friends lunching together is gone today. The same furnishings and carpet are still there (dirty, stained and in bad need of updating), but gone are the days of high society ladies brunching and lunching. They've been replaced by the who WANTS to be who of New York and by hopeful tourists like me just hoping to take a peek into the ""big"" girls club. If you are part of the first group, you can have my window seat from here until eternity. It's all yours. But, if you are a part of the latter crowd, save your money and save yourself a trip.

The afternoon tea is definitely filling and has enough food that will keep you full until late supper time. Everything on the afternoon tea settings (sandwiches, scones, macaroons, pastries) were all good, but as another reviewer mentioned, nothing typically stood out. What did stand out were their teas. I had the jardin bleu and while I'm more of a coffee drinker, this tea stood out and was paired perfectly with the items on the afternoon tea setting. We also ordered the chicken milanese and the chicken came on top of arugula salad and it was also a hit at our table. The chicken was soft and moist that I was able to just use my fork to cut pieces off and the vinaigrette dressing that was mixed with the salad was just tangy and sweet enough be paired with the chicken.

I'll start with the decor and ambiance. Our impression was that glory days of this place were over. The restaurant has old decor and the dirty rugs + our table cloth that had a huge stain on it. Hopefully BG plans to renovate the upper floors too, including this restaurant. Second, not all menu served were equal. One of the guest was given an outdated menu (oopss...).  The appetizers (the tuna tartar, Mediterranean platter and the croque monsieur) were nothing to die or eat for. We skipped the entree and moved to dessert. The Meyer lemon meringue was not eatable. The meringue was not baked/cooked just a gooey mushy egg whites. The Meyer lemon filling was way too sweet and the tart crust was thick. It was a work of an amateur patisserie cook. As a whole this dessert was less than mediocre. The other two guests had just plain fresh berries which were fine. It was a total waste of $$ and big disappointment.

Great view of Central Park and the menu did have some interesting choices. The food was well prepared and the portion sizes just right. Two downsides: 1) The carpet was extremely dirty. 2) While the waiters were friendly and attentive, during lunch we were asked at least 5 times if we were finished and could they take our plates away while we were clearly still eating. Was kind of uncomfortable to have to answer ""No, thank you"" multiple times while we were chewing food and / or having a conversation over lunch. Again, waiters are courteous, but the Maître D' needs to do some waiter training. The restaurant was 2/3 full at most and there was no reason to make us feel rushed while having a casual lunch. I would go back again but prefer if the wait staff would take a step back.",,,

But wow - the staff at BG made us feel like we were high society socialites - and I was wearing Birkenstocks, for heaven's sake! The view was phenomenal, the space serene and intimate. Our server was outstanding-personable, but not overbearing, with great attention to detail. We felt 100% comfortable sitting here sipping tea and nibbling scones, rubbing elbows with some high flyers in the NY scene (I am assuming here..but it sure seemed that way). The stacker of tea sandwiches, scones, and sweets was delicious - some of the best I've ever had at an afternoon tea - and my only teeny complaints were the lack of scone variety - even though the one they gave us was delicious - and no lemon curd (my favorite!). If you are looking for a civilized afternoon tea experience that won't be too pricey ($45 pp, which is fairly reasonable), look no further!",,,
