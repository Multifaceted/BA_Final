0,Klarissa M.,"Brooklyn, NY",41,10,2,5.0,7/13/2018,This place was awesome! The hostess and waiters were completely nice and accommodating! It was our first time having Persian food and we were not disappointed. Our waiter helped us order and id take her recommendation any time! So helpful. The food was hearty and yum and we willBe back. Cheers,,,
1,Shayan S.,"Oakland, CA",24,187,79,3.0,8/5/2018,"I'd order the food to-go next time. (I'm Iranian-American for context) It's a weird vibe. The interior design is tragic. The blasting music and tv screens with music videos just felt really off in terms of the ambiance. It was a Sunday around 5. The waitress looked kind of disheveled, not really well put together. She forgot to order one of our dishes, and then said she gave us a discount on drinks but didn't actually. The Fesenjoon was good. The Mast o khiar was good. I think my cousin had gheyme or bademjan which was ok. Since Persian food is really sub par in the area, I'd go back here if I was having a wild craving, but I'm definitely not staying there.",,,
2,Kitty C.,"New York, NY",0,41,0,2.0,7/28/2018,"I think the food deserves perhaps 4 stars.    But the service I had deserves a minus 4 stars. The woman that several reviewers have written about was as bad, rude, nasty, and perhaps racist (like the reviewer below, I am non-white) as they describe. On top of that, she was felonious, charging me $2 more than the menu price for every item, as well as charging me dinner prices, when it was lunchtime. When I demanded to know why, she said, ""It's the weekend, everything is $2 more."" That, as we all know, is a pile of bullshit. She gave me back $4, which I accepted so I could get out of there without punching her and getting myself into trouble.     The owner would do well to replace her with someone who is humane and pleasant, as befits a hostess/waitress. I won't be going back. And I advise you to be on your guard, if you go there.",,,
3,Michael J.,"New York, NY",1,19,0,3.0,7/19/2018,"My 3-star rating is a compromise between the good meals and nice atmosphere I'd enjoyed at Pars at least a dozen times over the years and the bad experience I had this evening (7/19/2018).  Whenever my partner and I want a good meal in a relaxed atmosphere in our neighborhood, we could always rely on Pars.  The friends we've taken on several occasions and Iranian co-workers have also enjoyed Pars.But tonight we promptly seated by a young woman, given water, and then ignored.  After about ten minutes we asked the young woman to take our order and she said she would tell the older woman who was tending to the other three tables in the restaurant.  After another five minutes of waiting while the older woman going back and forth and not even looking at us or saying that she will get to us soon, we left.  On the way out I told her we would return when they were less busy and she simply said ""Okay,"" not seeming to care and certainly not acknowledging let alone apologizing for the unreasonable wait.  We will go back to Pars and hope that we won't be ignored again.  There are not many un-noisy pleasant places to eat near us, and we would hate to lose Pars.",,,

Updated review","Very impressed with the service. The manager Sherri was very kind and personally delivered me wine. The music is rather calming and peaceful, matching the ambient decor that is at these premises. Strangely I never thought I would be able to study here, but the general environment here, allows me to do some work. Ordered the gheimeh, made of lamb and split peas. Great food. Will definitely come back.",1,,1
5,Heather P.,"New York, NY",5,29,4,5.0,10/12/2018,Underrated and perfect Middle Eastern food.  Staff is incredibly friendly and probably my favorite for lamb chops in the city. I have been coming here for many years and will hopefully be coming for many more.,,,
6,Behdad K.,"Vienna, VA",106,7,0,1.0,9/2/2018,Really bad persian resturant very bad food there are much better options in nyc.The service is terrible and the food is one of the worst quality persians food I have ever had and I am persian so I know how it should be.,,,
7,Ali K.,"Manhattan, NY",110,239,1311,4.0,1/26/2018,"Friendly and inviting Convenient location Family owned And the food is authentic ,aromatic, rich without being overwhelming.Several items from the menu like the Tadigh weren't available but we did try the Koobideh (skewers of meat with aromatic basmati rice), fesenjan (chicken stew with pomegranate) and the saffron tea and baklava.The Persian food competition is low in Manhattan but Pars would be in the top four or five for sure",,,
8,Marc S.,"Manhattan, NY",1,19,65,4.0,12/16/2017,"Delicious Persian food in a delightful setting with carpets and pillows and the enticing aromas of spices and scrumptious food. We had the Mirza Ghasemi (eggplant, tomato and egg spread), delish; the mixed grill, succulent lamb kebabs, white meat chicken and steak filets; the fesenjan, chicken in a pomegranate and walnut sauce accompanied by two types of rice--cherry rice and rice with onions and raisins. The cherry rice was the best. We finished it off with the saffron, rose, and pistachio homemade ice cream. The manager, Sheri, was warm and personable and made us feel right at home.",1,,
9,Quynh D.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",184,3,4,4.0,6/29/2018,The food is tasty overall. The lamb kabob is well marinated but overcooked so it's chewy. The mirza ghasemi is delicious. I had the dessert baklava as well.,,,

11,Al L.,"New York, NY",0,93,108,3.0,6/7/2018,"The restaurant has an interesting interior, which is a mix of cultural design and puppetry. There are muppets on shelves and a photo is on the back of the menu.The service industry is dependent on having listening skills. I believe there is room for potential improvement in this area.Unfortunately, the soda was flat and the food had more grease than expected. Perhaps this can be improved as well.Otherwise, the music is enjoyable and some some items, such as the hummus and salads, were delicious.",,,
12,Elnaz K.,"Los Angeles, CA",54,6,1,1.0,8/16/2018,They don't have any idea about the concept customer service. Being nice at the beginning is not enough.I ordered Tahdig with stew separately but they brought it on top . I was very disappointed by the quality and expressed my experience. Instead of just apologizing and accommodating with my request they become very deffensive and unprofessional trying to justifying the quality. The kebab was descent though. But we were very disappointed by their behaviour. No wonder we were the only customor that time. It's always nice to say just Sorry and move on. They include that order in the check although we didn't eat that!,,,
13,Brooke C.,"New York, NY",47,4,0,1.0,8/31/2018,"The food was inedible, to the point that I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  I've never complained to the BBB before.  The restaurant refused to refund me, offered to give me something else but I was scared to eat anything else given how awful the first dish was.  Rotten vegetables, etc.  They then said that no one else complained that day so it must be me.  Beyond sickening.  Avoid.",2,,
14,Jon D.,"Bloomfield, NJ",0,4,0,1.0,6/22/2018,"Decided against my better judgement to give this place a second chance. It's pretty evident that the owners are acting as the servers, probably because they don't want to have more people on payroll. The woman who took my order was rude and basically upsold me when she asked if I wanted a salad with my entree (which i thought was included). I ordered the Soltani (lamb kebob and beef kebob). When the food came out the lamb didn't taste like lamb, it tasted like a microwaveable salsbury steak. The beef kebob was overcooked and lacked flavor. The rice was ok. And it was way overpriced. I've had middle eastern food from a food cart that is way better and at a fraction of the price.",1,,
15,AlphaMay A.,"Queens, Queens, NY",0,2,1,5.0,3/28/2018,"Delicious food, excellent service, relaxing atmosphere. On a late afternoon, I ate the salmon special, olive appetizer, saffron tea. Lovely place.",,,
16,Sarah G.,"New York, NY",179,350,239,5.0,5/31/2017,"Have I seriously not reviewed Pars?We found this spot on Yelp two years ago after being disappointed by the mainstay Persian offerings across the city (which, as we Persians know, are few and far between).We were thrilled to find a place where we could get our kubideh fix -- light fluffy rice with flavorful, grilled beef. The added bonus? The taftoon (bread) they serve before the meal is TO DIE FOR. They serve a few pieces on the house -- extra is $2 an order but SO worth it. We've brought several groups of friends and family here, some locals and some visiting from out of town, and they've all loved it. Oh. I'm totally burying the lede. Thanks to Pars, we had a fabulous last-minute wedding reception here!Last fall, my darling partner and I decided to get hitched. Several factors, including my ailing mother, led us to our decision to semi-elope at City Hall downtown. Not wanting a huge wedding but still wanting to mark the occasion with good food and drink, we chose Pars Grill House! We wanted a place that was true to us, not too casual but not stuffy or formal, but still had a touch of class. And of course, the most important thing: fantastic food that everyone in our ethnically eclectic group, from my Iranian-born father, to our Ghanaian, Jewish, Black, Polish, Puerto Rican, and French friends, would enjoy. And Pars delivered!We planned everything about five days in advance and were happy that the owner worked with us to coordinate everything so we wouldn't have to worry. My husband spoke with him a few times just to nail down the head count and what time we'd be there. They offered us a prix fixe menu, but we decided to go à la carte, since we wanted to order several different dishes and were bringing our own wedding cake.The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. I especially enjoyed that our waitress called me ""arooz khanoum"" all night, which is the endearing Persian term for the bride. It was a sweet, unexpected nice touch.We coordinated with the owner beforehand to have a belly dancer come to perform during our dinner. She usually performs at the restaurant on Saturday nights, but since our wedding was on a Monday, we had to commission her ourselves. We paid $100 for her to come for about three songs, but I want to say that she stuck around longer than that and had me and my new husband come up to dance with her! It was a really fun addition to the evening. All of our food was delicious -- we ordered so many different plates and kept the wine flowing. Everyone ate so much and took whatever bits were left home because it was too yummy to waste!Thanks again to the staff who cranked up the music a bit and allowed us to use your dining room as our makeshift dance floor. Persians know that it's not a real wedding unless someone dances! They took extra special note to play certain traditional music, like for the knife dance before the cutting of the cake, and ""Baba Karam."" Thinking of these memories makes me smile so hard! Thank you thank you for that.I would say we were probably at the restaurant a good four hours -- taking up a good half of one of the dining spaces -- and were never asked to hurry it up or leave. The kind staff topped off our night of celebrations with some delectable Persian tea. The whole evening came to about $1,000 with included tip for 12 people. Our guests left happy and full -- and that's all we could have asked for. A huge ""Merci"" to Pars and its staff for making the night I married the love of my life such a perfect, zero-stress, fun, lovely, delicious, dance-filled evening. I will be coming back here frequently for ages to come!",3,1,
17,Spot Z.,"Brockton, MA",0,15,0,5.0,7/27/2018,"I love to go to this place!  My latest lunch there saw the manager, Sheri, ordering for me (I hate selecting items from a menu) after inquiring about what I like. She also fixed me two stiff drinks that made me feel like I was John Cheever or some such.  The food was delicious as was the atmosphere.  Lawd willin', I'll be back again on my next trip to Gotham.",,,
18,Elsa B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,2.0,9/30/2018,"Was much better. When it changed hands, service declined. And they use prepackaged greens for salad. You can taste and smell the preservatives.",,,

20,Michael S.,"Great Neck, NY",0,84,0,2.0,9/8/2018,"Pars had been recommended to me by friends who live in the Chelsea neighborhood.  It is clean and the staff is friendly and obliging.  The food seemed tasty but the portions were unbalanced. A beef stew for $16.95 came with a mountain of rice, a soup bowl of green liquid, a dozen red kidney beans, two whole cooked limes, and perhaps four tiny chunks of beef.  I know that restaurants don't want to raise their prices for fear of scaring off customers, but this dish needed more protein or more accurate advertising: Rice-Mountain With Green Soup Visited By A Scattering of Beef.  I would have paid a bit more for a more lavish portion.",,,
21,Hilonet H.,"Los Angeles, CA",0,6,0,1.0,9/14/2018,WORST! The tahdig would definitely never be served at a Persian dinner or the cook would get slapped! Embarrassing - and koresht was underwhelming,,,
22,Suzanne E.,"Chicago, IL",101,353,28,5.0,3/24/2017,"I was here in November for a drink, by accident, and loved the atmosphere and the bartender, and made a note to come back, and I am here right now after having found El Quixote too packed with Friday post-work revelers. I think it's a little early here for the mad rush, so I get to chill out in peace with a dry and potent cosmo and a lovely small dish (I forget the name, I think it's number 10), and proofread a book.  This place is good for concentration, sort of soft and murmurous noise from conversation and muted music. The waiter didn't know what I meant by Persian hot sauce (maybe it's a Chicago Reza's thing) but another guy who may be the chef or owner got me a dish of really hot and delicious Persian pepper and coriander chutney that I want to learn how to make, AND the staff just gathered to see the kitchen staff celebrated on a Farsi TV channel (in English). One more dish to try, with friends this time.",3,,
23,Fara T.,"Herndon, VA",80,10,0,1.0,9/2/2018,"Me & my husband travel to different places often . Discovering newyork , we were searching for a good persian cuisine. Seeing online pictures and reviews we decided to come to pars! I am very disappointed and dont like to write bad reviews , however I have to mention this for others like us who come to visit NYC and want to eat good food at a persian restaurant! We ordered fish kabob that in the picture it shows it in the dish with specific sabzi polo and if you are persian you know that mahi comes with sabzi polo. After our order came , seeing white rice with mahi we objected to the order and it was not changed , but for extra money they brought 30 minuets later when our food , and fish was finished , the sabzi polo !!!! Not only it was late already we were charged extra ( voice of a man in the background that sabzipolo is more money all the way to the sitting area where we could hear loud and clear) . We never asked for 2 baghlava ( that you can buy from safeway or market ) they brought 2 huge baghlavas with chai and again charged us extra. No arguments but we walked out saying thank you and appreciative . Just not fair nor professional to charge ""extras"" without confirming . By the way they dont serve kabob koobideh which is on the menus and barg kabob tasted really bad! I am super disappointed & was hoping to have picked another restaurant on my last day in NYC ! Dont make the same mistake!",,,

Everything was Americanized enough to satisfy a large variety of people. I fully understand this since I work for a Mediterranean restaurant in NJ.I have absolutely no complain about the interior.The waitress was very sweet and nice, as well, but the only thing I did not enjoy as much was the koobideh. Of course it was not bad, but it was not my taste; I like my koobideh to be prepared with more of meat and piyaz rather than soya/bread or other substitutes! ;)Nevertheless the portion was fairly big and came with such great, complementary bread and ash-reshteh.Kudos to the owner and his staff.I did enjoy my lunch and will be going back when visiting the city.",,,
26,Sarah S.,"Ithaca, NY",1,8,0,1.0,7/23/2018,"I've been here a few times, but my experience on July 21, 2018 was quite terrible and I'm not sure I'll return to this restaurant again. My sister and I entered the restaurant at around 7:30 pm. There were a few people seated at some tables, and there were many empty tables. The waitress, a middle-aged woman with short hair wearing shorts and a tank top (the name on the receipt was Mania, so perhaps that is her name), told me and my sister that there is no room for us. She stated that there is a party and that she can't seat us. All the seats at the bar were empty, so I asked her if we could sit there instead to order dinner. She said no. From looking at the various people seated in the restaurant, it was obvious that there was no party and that these people did not all know each other. Then a few minutes later a couple walked in behind us and requested a table for two. The same waitress told them to follow her. Before they could, my sister asked them if they were at the restaurant for a party. The couple said no. So I asked the waitress why she was ready to seat this couple when they were not here for a party, but she would not seat us? At that point it became obvious to us that she's racist. Everyone in the restaurant was white. The couple was white. My sister and I are of a darker complexion (we are South Asian). She became flustered at my question, and then she told all four of us (the couple, my sister and I) to follow her. She seated all four of us at the same table. It was awkward at first being seated at a table with strangers like that. But the couple was so lovely and we had a great time. We spent two hours at the restaurant chatting with the couple over dinner. However, it was obvious by the way the waitress was dealing with me and my sister that she was begrudgingly waiting on us. We (all four of us) left the restaurant at around 9:30. By the time we left, there were still many empty tables.... There was never a party. This is a shame, because the last time I went to this restaurant with some friends on June 9th, we had a very diverse group and we were treated very well by the owner (the puppeteer). The owner of the restaurant showed his puppets to us (they are on display) and talked to us about his life and career in puppetry. He made our experience on June 9th so memorable. So it is unfortunate that we had such an unfortunate experience because of this waitress on July 21st, and I will think twice before going there again because of her. I do wish the puppeteer well though. He's such a nice man and the waitress needs to learn from him how to be hospitable, which Iranians are known to be (she is certainly not and she does a disservice to Iranians everywhere).",1,,
27,Aurora B.,"New York, NY",1,5,0,4.0,6/2/2018,"Just enjoyed a delicious Persian dinner at Pars Grill House. This place is truly authentic in every aspect: from the cozy decor and music to the Farsi-speaking hostess, and of course the cuisine. The homemade bread is absolutely delicious, and the kashkeh bademjan. My mother had the lamb and rice. I ordered the chicken kabob. The meat was tender and juicy and smothered in saffron.

They also have a really great classic New York bar in the front. A great recommendation for a newbie to Persian food is ""Fesenjoon"" or chicken with walnuts and pomegranate sauce. I married into a Persian family and this is the dish I always impress my own fam by ordering when we've eaten Persian. Pars's fesenjoon is delishhhh. :) To the reviewer below who clearly doesn't know how to order Persian food: You do not fault Indian or Thai food for being spicy and so you should not fault Persian flavors for their subtlety.

It's in a convenient central location to boot.Also -- and I know this is the one important factor for SERIOUS EATERS -- I can attest to their QUALITY of Persian food.

The location was fairly convenient between Madison Square Garden and Chelsea in an area otherwise overrun with pubs, salad specialists , and quick bites. The menu lacked creativity and had no depth. The offering is heavily weighed toward kabobs made with beef, chicken, lamb, and ground beef/lamb. My entree was a Cornish Game Hen kabob, and a lamb kabob served with bastmati rice and a few grilled vegetables. The portion was fair, but the food was bland and overcooked. Service was good, although uninformed. Overall a 2 1/2 - 3 star.Majeed,Bland, overcooked and uninspired is not satisfied by your response.

50,Vahram G.,"New York, NY",0,13,0,5.0,2/25/2018,"This restaurant deserves a 5 plus for sure, I agree with all the positive comments and 5 stars that previous reviewers have given. We had not been in this place in many years, our last experience was not good so we did not go back, but we did not know there was a new owner and management running the restaurant.It is truly family owned and operated, the manager Sherri is extremely kind and attentive, the décor and the atmosphere is wonderful, the music pleasant, all this before even you get to the food. The food is the best part, for appetizer we had Salad Shirazi and Kashk Bademjoon both were very tasty and delicious, and they bring you this wonderful warm bread to go with it, for main we ordered salmon Kabob and vegetarian dish everything was done to perfection, the rice exactly the way needs to be done, and for dessert we had homemade Baklava and Persian saffron tea which was wonderful.

63,Cecilia S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0,1.0,2/13/2018,"The entire dining experience at this establishment was marred by the waitress.  I may not have an extensive knowledge of Persian cuisine, but I am well versed in liquor of my choice.  I ordered a certain brand of whiskey ""neat"", but she says ""on the rocks"".  I said no ice, but she looks at me as if I don't know what I am saying.  After few more words to ensure no ice, she gave me a contemptuous look and off she went. What came back was too cute for words; we all laughed an incredulous laugh at how small the shot glass was and only ¾ filled.  I rarely take my drinks in a shot glass, but I take a small sip because the color was too light to be what I had ordered. It was not what I ordered.  I bring this to her attention but she is confrontational and asks me ""what kind?"", which was an odd question.  I cancelled the drink, and we are no longer in the mood to drink.  I noticed cuts on her hand when she brought the drink, and the sight gave me a shiver; I thought she should protect her cuts with bandage.  Okay, she is not a bartender and perhaps she is having a bad day, but she was just rude overall.  She was not happy with what we ordered, resentful to serve us and she made us feel downright unwelcomed.  She brought us our bill without bothering to ask if we wanted coffee, tea or dessert.Good thing I checked the bill, because she neglected to take off $9 for the drink I never got.",,,

Well by 240 I heard nothing so I called the restaurant. ""Oh your order has been ready for a long time""....so FYI when I arrive the place is completely empty. I said there should be a second text to the hostess - she shrugs ""you should call/ I've called them (seamless?) to fix it"". J asked how long my order was ready for - 30 MINUTES. She offers to reheat my obviously cold order. Before I left I said it would have been better had they called me since they aren't busy. Her response? ""I could have"".

We had a child in the party that went to town on his kebab. The doogh (yoghurt drink with dried mint), tea, and house wine were good, too!

The restaurant itself had this cozy authentic folklore vibe which I liked.I was greeted instantly and escorted to a table by the window. While I was going through the menu a waitress brought me home made Persian style bread and yoghurt on the house. - Yum! Since I am not Persian I had couple questions regarding to the spices and dishes which my waitress explained kindly without any condescending attitude that you often get dare to inquire. Note meanwhile there was a huge group filling up at least half of the restaurant.I sticked with the chicken kebab though since that was my point of craving.My chicken came moist and warm from the kitchen with a generous amount of rice and grilled veggies.The new owner of the restaurant came by my table to ask if everything was good and recommended to try my chicken with a spice that was sitting on my table unnoticed. I was absolutely charmed by the gesture and grateful for the exotic addition to a dish that I have eaten plenty times before.She also explained that the big group of people were from Columbia University supporting Iranian culture.I walked out not only culinary content but with actually an experience which is the forgotten reason of why people go ""out"".

Food was fine but nothing stood out. I would not recommend the baklava. Normally baklava is one of my favorite desserts but this one was off - it had an overpowering spiciness and wasn't moist.When we asked for hot sauce, we were told ""Sorry, but saffron is expensive so you wouldn't want to cover up the food's flavor with hot sauce."" Then someone brought over their hot sauce options - Cholula and Tabasco. C'mon guys. You can do better. How about a homemade hot sauce or some other alternative that you can offer? I didn't find that response to be appropriate.As we were leaving there was a belly dancer coming out to start a routine.

Updated review","You say you were there and you allowed this to happen? Even more pathetic.I was eating my first course by then at another restaurant and both the other patrons made positive comments to me about their disbelief of your staffs actions. But, I do absolutely understand you defending huge mistakes on your part here, that's natural. I hope you will learn a lesson from this experience and make sure no one has this experience again.No worries about me, I have too many amazing and more than equal choices in this area as do the rest of us. And after telling others in our neighborhood about this they have all said this is typical for your place. Sad that they don't also use Yelp but sadder to know you treat people badly often.Hope that gets better for you....",3,1,

Updated review","After years of avoiding this place I found myself in a new apartment across the street, so I mistakingly tried it againI'll leave the food alone for nowthe service is terrible!! This place is run by 3 of the oddest ethnic woman I have EVER met! They are not Persian or bukharian.  Nor are they polite, helpful, accommodating...just very awkward young ladies that made me feel very uncomfortable!! Called for an order, they said just come in and order it's simple, I waited there for 20 minutes like a puts!  Being an American born Persian, this place just makes me sad and maybe even a little offended.  We don't have many Persian restaurants in NYC, I hate that this place is so poorly representing the food and hospitality that is connected to any true Persian eating experience.",4,2,

86,Shannon M.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2,37,10,4.0,12/4/2015,"I went to Pars on a Wednesday evening and I was planning to first check out the atmosphere to make sure it wasn't too dead. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was actually pretty full. I unlocked the Yelp deal for the free glass of wine with the check-in, and our server offered us 2 glasses. The service was wonderful throughout the entire meal.I came with someone who had never tried Persian food before, so we ordered 7 things. Needless to say, we ordered too much. The first 3 came as part of the appetizer combination option. We got the Maasto Moosir, the Kuku Sabzi, and the Kashk-e Bademjan. The portions were so large that we had to order another side of bread (they charge $2 for extra bread, but whatever). I can't speak for the kuku since I hate the dish in general, but the other 2 were great. My favorite of those 3 was the Kashk-e Bademjan though.We then got Tadig with gheime and the Fesenjan with chicken. This was seriously the biggest portion of Tadig I've ever received at a restaurant. I could have eaten just this and I'd be fine. I've definitely had better Fesenjan. It tasted like the took leftover chicken from abgoosht and put it in the fesenjan.For dessert, we got tea and the saffron-rosewater-pistachio ice cream. Usually, this flavor of ice cream is heavy on the pistachios and I'm not a fan.The proportion of pistachio to ice cream in this was perfect.I'm definitely going back. I recommend the Tadig, the Kashk-e Bademjan, and the ice cream. I have Maasto Moosir in my fridge so it wasn't really a novelty to have it here.Tips for anyone who wants to go: The sides menu offers smaller portions of the gourmet rice dishes if you don't want rice as your main dish.",1,1,

My friends were confused, assumed they'd misheard and went in search of another bathroom. Once they realized that they had been wrongfully shunned, they returned to try using the bathrooms again and were again approached by the incredibly rude owner. We demanded our check to leave, at which point the owner came over to our table I assumed to apologize...but no. He rudely talked over us, raised his voice trying to ""explain his side of the story"".  No apology. Our bill came with no discount, again no apology, nothing. I asked the waitress to have the owner at least comp our wine as he had ruined our experience there...she dismissively tried to explain that ""people from the nightclub try to use our bathrooms"". Sorry, no...the restaurant was fairly empty, we had been there for hours in the direct line of vision of every employee including the owner, and he wrongly assumed without asking.They did comp our wine, but ended up overcharging one of us by hundreds of dollars, DID NOT SAY THAT THEY DID THIS OR PROVIDE A VOIDED RECEIPT, and here we are on the phone with the banks fraud claims department.",6,1,1

I highly recommend the fessenjan atmosphere.n if you wish to try something new, its a stew made of pomegranate and walnuts and has such a unique taste its hard to describe. I previously said this was amazing but having gone recently the quality of food has fallen drastically. I mean its not bad but it went from being delicious and soft to tasteless and bland. The fessenjen has a great taste as a stew but the chicken inisde was so hard, I mean its meat in stew guys the whole point is for it to be soft and juicy. The kebabs also were suddenly tasteless. They must have changed chefs or somethnig because the difference it too stark.I would recommend Ravagh instead if you have the choice.",1,1,

I learned the other night that Pars imports all of its importable ingredients from Iran, including its saffron but I also discovered the reason for  Pars' kabob's exquisite and superior quality, texture, aroma, and exceptional taste.  As my mom says, ""it's  even better than kabobs in Tehran.At Pars,  they buy the best quality meat, and now I see why the kabob at Pars is phenomenal.

I asked for fesenjoon (usually with chicken) but ""with no meat, vegetarian."" The waitress told me they could do that. When they brought the food, I discovered after several bites that there was a large piece of chicken in my food. When I brought this to the attention of our waitress, she said ""oh you said no meat, you didn't say vegetarian. They just picked the meat out of the dish. There is no vegetarian fesenjoon."" When I responded saying that I had asked for it to be vegetarian, she started to argue with me saying I didn't. Even if she hadn't heard the vegetarian part, she clearly heard the ""no meat"" part, and there was still meat in the dish! After a lot of arguing, she finally took the dish back and I didn't eat anything because I had lost my appetite.I figured that because they took back my dish, they wouldn't charge me for it. When the bill came, I discovered that they had charged me for the fesenjoon and the rice, which I did not eat. I asked the waitress to remove it and she said she couldn't. When I asked to speak to the manager, she left and came back with a new receipt, and told me in farsi, ""We took it off for you, but the manager said to tell you that we are ONLY doing this because it's the New Year. Otherwise we would never do such a thing."" And then she proceeded to argue with me again over the fact that I said ""no meat,"" saying I should still be charged. Also they still charged me for the rice I didn't eat.Seriously, what??? Since when is it okay to charge someone for a dish they sent back? Especially if they requested it with no meat and it came with a big chunk of meat! I have never been so disrespected in my life. It's just unheard of that you would argue with a customer like this, especially when you just gave a vegetarian person meat. And the level of attitude I received with the ""only because it's the new year"" comment... Just ridiculous.Avoid this place if you are a vegetarian, or if you are a person who wishes to receive good customer service or to be treated with any respect. Also the food that I did have wasn't even good. At all.",43,4,1

97,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,5.0,9/10/2013,"Places like Pars Grill, passed up by the sheeple in favor of trendier eateries, put a smile on my face. I'd walked by a few times on the way to UCB and wondered why it's always empty. Well, on a recent Saturday night, I had a chance to find out. At 7:30 pm it was perfectly semi-occupied, no reservations required. We got a nice table, the seats covered with Persian (let's pretend, if they're not) rugs and the atmosphere deliciously muted. At any minute, a belly dancer could jump out, or a group of men could be sharing a shisha nearby (none of this occurred, but the possibility is in the air).The food was excellent. We kept it simple with a yogurt mint dill appetizer, with dunkable bread, and a small shepherd salad (healthy/sane portions, unlike the ones you get more exuberant Russian-accented restaurants). My Kobideh (aka lyulya kebab) was excellent: two skewers, one lamb and one beef, very juicy and perfectly seasoned. It comes with that light Persian saffron rice (yum). We didn't have room for dessert and I regret that, but the wine was good and they even had a Yelp check-in offer for a free glass with ever entree.Hidden gem!",3,2,2

Service was spotty--at some points very attentive but at other times it seemed the four employees working the tiny restaurant were going out of their way to ignore us.  The place is small and intimate, but the Middle Eastern disco music diminished the ambience just a bit for me.  I'd definitely come back, but I'd avoid the steak and stick with the poultry or fish, instead.",1,,

101,Rod J.,"New York, NY",35,6,0,1.0,3/13/2016,"This is yet ANOTHER Persian restaurant that chooses to cut corners and not use authentic recipes in their cooking. I am 100% Persian and have seen this happen in many of their dishes. Do NOT be deceived. Here are a couple examples:1) The yellow rice is NOT saffron. I grew up to home made Persian cooking and trust me, if there's real saffron, YOU CAN TASTE IT. The yellow additives or food colorings are Persian restaurants skimping out and coloring your tadeeg. 2) Jooje kabobs are supposed to be marinated in the following ingredients: Lime, olive oil, home-made yogurt, saffron (surprise), minced fresh onion, salt, pepper. This place colors its chicken and cooks it over a flame. There's no presence of any of the mentioned ingredients. 3) The mast/moseer or any yogurt dish is just yogurt out of the container. Real home-made quality yogurt has acidity to it.All of this is pretty similar at Ravagh (or most Persian restaurants) and is pretty embarrassing to me that a place like this is trying to call itself Iranian.I was with a group of 6 and we spent over $300 at a place that will never get another dollar from me. It would be nice to see this place start taking reviews seriously or it will be another Starbucks in a few years.",3,2,

When we arrived, ghe owner was speaking to the only other guests --a couple -- in what I assume was Farsi. He offered me some dried pineapple to give to my daughter. The hostess/waiter, Sheri, made great recommendations for me and my vegetarian spouse (two different stews) and also picked a hit for my four year old (a delicious lentil soup). My daughter broke a glass, and the owner not only came by to clean it up, but helped cheered up my daughter, who was distressed about it, by making a game out of the whole situation.  The stews were great. I had one with chicken in a rich walnut, pomegranate sauce. My wife had a vegetarian stew with mushrooms in a green stew steeped with parsley, fenugreek, and dried lime.  Unique flavors you don't typically experience. Finished of with saffron tea.  Tables also have shakers of sumac. Decor was elegant but also warm and homey.  We sat on a bench tossed with embroidered pillows.  There were photos of the owner who appears to have been a puppeteer for a children's television show in Iran.

There was also a nice yelp check in deal that gets you a free glass of wine with an entree that my friend and I took advantage of. I was quite happy with my entree and really enjoyed the various spices used - fenugreek, coriander, lime. It comes served with some saffron rice which accompanied it well. My only problem was the stew came lukewarm and I'm not sure if that's just how it's meant to be eaten but I guess my Chinese and American mentality still wants food to be hot or cold with none of that gray middle area.During dinner, we were also treated to basically dinner and a show where a belly dancer came and performed, weaving her way through the narrow passages between tables. Be careful because she does twirl, which can fling her scarf in your food or whack your head - both of which actually happened to me.",1,,

Had to ask for several things more than once despite the waitress appearing several times to ask how things were; No follow-through however. We requested an extra piece of bread for the appetizer because we had dips left over. There were two of us with one (large round) piece of bread. They charged $1.95 for the second piece of bread.

116,Atif I.,"New York, NY",177,641,1730,4.0,4/21/2012,"""I thought you said that we don't need a reservation? The hostess said the wait was an hour at least!!""""Oh, wow! In a way, I'm glad for I've come to an empty restaurant on Saturday afternoons.""I love Pars Grill. For all its quirks, it's my favorite Persian restaurant in the city. Unpredictable, yet consistent. With the kind of flaws one overlooks, because it's who they are: inside and out. Not perfect, like the touched up teeth you see in reality TV shows. Not scared to show their flaws while opening themselves up. So you know: Friday and Saturday nights turn into cultural events at Pars Grill with a Belly Dancer who entertains for a good thirty minutes. Personally, I'm not a fan of belly dancing, given that it reminds me of female exploitation in centuries of yore, and as the more talented cultural cousin of pole dancing. But, I must commend the belly dancer at Pars as thanks to her skill, dexterity, and personal charm - the experience didn't reek of titillation. Well done, her!Beyond the entertainment, the food is top notch! I've brought vegetarian friends here multiple times, for the menu is friendly to all. Pars does an excellent job at eggplant dishes, and I recommend two highly. First, the Kashke Badamjan: mashed, lightly fried eggplant, with yogurt sauce, crushed walnuts, and sautéed garlic mint, and then the Mirza Ghasemi: a blend of smoked eggplant, chopped tomato, and scrambled eggs. Both of these are so different, and delicious, that they've converted me into eating eggplant {in case it weren't clear, there's only a handful of vegetarian dishes that I do eat: pizza being one of them!! ;)} I've also tried the Borani: sautéed spinach, yogurt, and garlic, and the Mast-e-Khiar: yogurt, diced cucumber, and mint - excellent for summer months.In terms of entrees: you must try the Grilled Kebabs. I love the Kobideh (two skewers of ground lamb and beef mixed with spices and grated onions), even though if you want variety you might order the Soltani, for then you would get one skewer of Kobideh, and one of Barg (Beef steak). I prefer the Kobideh (their version is perhaps the best in the city). Also, best-in-class are the Joojeh (one whole Cornish hen cut into pieces, then grilled). Find a food critic who looks down on chicken or poultry (amongst the various meats) and let them try the juicy hen, I'm sure they would realize that it's only because of their limited knowledge of the ways of the world. Finally, the rice. Dear Lord: Pars serves my favorite rice dishes in the city. Not just the ""Gourmet rice"" dishes that have saffron rice topped with cherries, burberries, pistachios - to bring out all kinds of sweet and sour flavors, even their plain saffron Basmati rice would put every single purveyor of Indian cuisine to shame, in terms of each grain standing apart, and being cooked to perfection (none of the clumpy, moist, sticky rice you see across Indian restaurants and those of the cuisines to their east).Yes, Pars Grill has its flaws. They will often burn the bread (""Noon"") or serve it lukewarm. The grill will char parts of the meat more than they are intended to, but it still reminds one of a meal at a friend's house, with all its shortcomings. Sadly, they manage to screw up the desserts more times than I would like, be it the Falludeh Shirazi, or the Baklava - still Pars remains very close to my heart (4.5 stars)",19,10,16

If you refuse to take it off the bill after we send it back -- that is wrong. Don't mess up your business with crappy customer service.

Not to mention my mom is the best chef of Iranian cuisine of all time. So I had the MirzaGhasemi, which is a Northern Iran specialty dish involving smoked eggplant, garlic, tomato- and some other goodies. It's extremely delicious and hard to get right- they definitely hit it on the mark! On the other hand- the Koobideh needed some work. My qualms about the koobideh: -Half of a grilled tomato= cruelty. Let's be real- that is NOT enough tomato to accommodate the food!-The meat was a litttttttle overdone. Still delicious- but I prefer that juice to seep through a little. -The rice is not enough for the amount of meat you get. Now for someone like me that has a 2:1 ratio of meat to rice in every bite it kind of worked out. Looking back it looks like I have a lot to complain about- but this is the food I've grown up on, overall it is great and I would come back.

They bake really good bread on the spot, too.Yes it's the best Persian food in NYC as the sandwich boards outside claim, but I'm personally not a fan of the Koobideh (as my family does it differently, and that's what I'm used to).  Otherwise, I haven't had anything less than spectacular there, and believe my I eat at Pars often.If you're Persian reading this: Note that they have Abgoosht and Kaleh Pacheh so be prepared with comfy shoes to walk back home in.  Also, the Fesenjoon is sour, not sweet, so if mama makes it sweet you shouldn't get it, get the Shirin polo instead :D.",6,,

We walked in and we were seated and all was well except I noticed that there was a couple of flies lingering in the dining area. It wasn't a big deal because their windows were open. I ordered the Barg (fillet mignon), because I noticed that it was a fan favorite based on a sign I saw displayed at the front door, and I found it to be sub par. There was literally no flavor to the steak, and that was disappointing. What really prompted me to write this review was not because the food wasn't outstanding.

I understand that it can, and will happen during this time of year, but it was the way the waitress handled (or didn't handle) the situation. Here it goes:Me: Excuse me, there's a bug in this beer. Waitress: uhmmm... uhhh... (there's an uncomfortable pause and she looks confused) We-- We serve the beers straight from the bottle. Me: (at this point I look a bit annoyed for obvious reasons) Okay, but there's a bug in this beer. If you'd like, you can see for yourself. Waitress: (still looking clueless and is clearly at a loss for words) Is there anything you want me to do? What do you want me to do?Me: What can you do for me? So, here's the thing; What I expected was for the waitress to apologize, and she hadn't. I also expected her to either ask me if my mother wanted a drink to replace this one free of charge, or to remove it from our check altogether. She did neither. My mother even overheard her talking about the situation with another coworker, and STILL, there was nothing done about the bug. I felt like the whole exchange between her and I should've been recorded and presented at a job orientation for the SAME position because she clearly had no idea how important customer service is or what it even is.",18,6,3

Updated review","Update: Please read the owner's comment and see how sincere my other reviews are - his level of class speaks for itself. Go to Ravaugh, and if you want more suggestions inbox me -We ALL know that this food is fortunately sold by those wonderful street vendors but for those who don't eat on the street, we can sit down and pay thrice the price...I was chewing and found something that was shaped like a certain type of hair found on the nether regions of the body. It was bright red. The women came over and told me it was a piece of fabric. Haha she says - we do not have anyone that has red hair. I won't get into that logic, but even if it were a piece of fabric, when I'm paying $20.95 for a piece of fish and rice, I do not expect to experience those moments of anxiety of yanking something that feels like hair out of my teeth and thinking its from someone's crotch. Yes, it has happened and does happen. I wasn't expecting compensation for the whole thing, but an apology? An attempt?And where pray tell was the piece of fabric before it got between my gums?She could have easily deducted the $2 dollar tea I ordered - easily instead of losing a frequent customer. I'm sorry - even though the staring is intense and uncomfortable they do strike me as nice enough people, but not fair. To the owners - when a customer shows you something like this again and handles it calmly - they are paying for the experience and you need to make an effort to compensate that.",9,5,1
147,N G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,5.0,2/26/2013,"Pars is absolutely the best Persian restaurant I've ever been to (coming from a native Iranian, this is a huge compliment!)The kabobs are juicy and flavorful, the rice melts in your mouth and the persian ice cream is a must-have!My friends are addicted to this place! Don't leave Pars without trying the below: Appetizers-Kashke Bademjan (eggplant)Tahdig with any stew of choice (all stews are amazing)Entree-Chicken breast kabobKoobideh kabobOr the Pars Mixed Grill (this gives you a taste of variety of kabobs)Side Dish-Maast Khiar (yogurt)Dessert-Persian Ice Cream !!!!!!! (this is heavenly)Persian TeaThe only downfall is that they don't bring out Panir-O-Sabzi, a 'refreshing mixture of fresh basil, mint, parsley, and cilantro, radish and walnuts served with feta cheese', which is an Iranian delicacy brought out at as an appetizer at any other Persian restaurant you go to (sort of like bread and olive oil at Italian restaurants). It takes away from the true Iranian hospitality experience. Regardless, Pars still gets 5 stars. The staff is great and the food is always delicious! Enjoy!",1,,

My friend and I were unsure about what to eat, so the both of us literally asked our waitress to help us decide.

""I was craving Persian ice cream the other day and thought of you."" We both plan to go back.If you must know why I didn't give Pars Grill House and Bar a 5-Star, it's because I took half a point off for their sanitation grade and another half off for not allowing me to use my free glass of wine Yelp coupon on a Lunch entree.",,,

I wanted to give the food away to the homeless but I really don't think that's the right thing to do... Its possible that they give their old food out for delivery, and serve fresh food in the restaurant... And maybe that's why there are so many positive reviews. But even if there was a fresh version of the food I ate, it would still be mediocre-bad.    If you want Persian food in the area go to Ravagh. Persepolis is a bit far but in my opinion they have the best Persian food in the city. Also as a Persian Im really embarrassed by the owner's comments on the low starts reviews!!! They need to learn how to respect their customer's opinion no matter what.ps. I only opened yelp account to write a review about this place.

The rice always is well cooked and delicious (they could probably put more in each serving). We have had a great experience here with the staff. They are all friendly and helpful.

Overall, the food to price ratio wasn't 100% there for me... I felt the appetizers (Kashk-e-bademjoon and Shirazi Salad) were quite small for the $6.95 charged as well as the quality of the kabobs for the price charged (way too buttery out of the kitchen) was a bit of a letdown.

Conveniently located to the UCB theater (and on a stretch of not-too-many restaurant options), this place is cozy and cute, with embroidered pillows and padded banquettes for seating. They do a nice job; lovely table settings and cloth napkins FTW!But the food. Ooooh, the food. I went in not knowing exactly what ""Persian"" (Iranian) food was going to be like, but having a vague notion that it might be like other MIddle Eastern food I've had. It is and it isn't. There were flavors and ingredient combinations that I'd never seen before, but everything worked.I have a theory that ""comfort food"" transcends national borders, and this place was definitely what I'd imagine would be served to me by someone's Iranian grandma. I ordered a braised lamb dish and my boyfriend got a braised chicken dish. They both came with heaps and heaps of saffrony, dried-fruit-studded basmati rice that was buttery and delectable. The kind of rice I'd wake up at 3 AM and nosh on in the middle of the night.The lamb and chicken were both cooked on the bone till they were falling-apart tender. Nothing was overpowering or overspiced, but neither was it lacking for flavor. And the warm flatbread they serve you was delicious as well. I haven't stopped thinking about the food since I ate it, and I'm already plotting my return. They seem to have some regular happy hour specials, which will be the perfect excuse to go back!Service was pleasant and prompt. Pars is way above par (*groan*...I HAD to).",1,,

The wait for the food was too long. I can deal with all of it if the food were good. The kashke bademjoon was flavorless. The Ghormeh Sabzi was an inch and a half of oil with a few maybe 3 chunks of beef. Where was the lemon flavor? The torshi clearly was not homemade but jarred. All in all we were really disappointed in what we hoped would be our place for koobideh & Khoresh in the city.I am just now reading the comments from the manager/owner of this restaurant to me, 2 years later.  And I feel compelled to respond because he was so rude.  I happen to speak Farsi, and cook Iranian food for Iranian people all the time.

Updated review","This is an update: The food is still 4 star, the Fesenjun is still very good, the Baghali polo is still good, and the Barg still decent (Rafagh still makes a better Barg) The rudeness is through the roof though. You don't need to believe me, just read the responses the owner has left for recent 1-2 star reviewers. It gives you a good idea of the level of respect they have for their costumers. Sorry, but such rudeness is not acceptable, even when what you serve can not be matched elsewhere. In case of Pars, traveling a short distance to Ravagh will not only get you food that's at least as good, but service that is polite and owners who respect costumers.",3,,1
188,Srinivas G.,"New York, NY",55,22,0,5.0,2/22/2013,"As a fervent connoisseur of Indian food and having tasted Parsi cooking during Thanksgiving at my friend's house - who are from Iran, I have a basic sense of what to expect in this cuisine. Usually, I travel from the east side to the west side of Manhattan just so I could satisfy my cravings for beef, lamb or fish skewers. On their lunch menu, I highly recommend the Koobiden which is basically a skewer of beef and lamb, mixed with grilled vegetables and rice. In case, you are willing to spend $20 for lunch, then I will suggest the Adas Polo with Lamb Shack. This is a mixture of rice, braised lentils, carmalized onions, and raisins served with braised lamb shack. Most importantly, the lamb is super moist and tender, the meat must have been thoroughly slow cooked and/or the lamb was probably very young. Whatever the case is, you cannot go wrong if you pick this place.",2,1,1

Tell me what is more inspiring to the soul than a cook that respects the most simple of food staples and raises it to an experience that will revive your spirits? This is what the food should do.",1,1,1
191,R T.,"Somerville, MA",7,70,0,3.0,7/5/2011,"My husband and I were visiting NYC and wanted a meal before seeing the Upright Citizens Brigade. Pars fit the bill (mainly because they had outdoor seating and are just a short block away).I had the Shirazi salad ($7) and the Chicken Breast kebob ($17), and my husband had the Koobideh ($15). These prices aren't any different from what we pay for a dinner out at home, so that was not an issue. We had a table right in the window. We had pretty good service all things considered. We got in and out in plenty of time to get good seats in the theater. We had never eaten Persian food before so I have no frame of reference there for spiciness or authenticity. But all in all, the meal was flavorful and tasty, we don't feel we overpaid, so we were satisfied.",,1,1
192,Craving Cholent X.,"Stamford, CT",0,191,4,3.0,7/19/2013,Food gets 4 stars. Tadig was great...as was sabzi ghomeh and grilled meat platter...and I LOVE the bread. Dessert (pistachio ice cream and noodles) was... interesting.Service gets 2 stars. Not horrible but not particularly good. Servers tend to hang out in the far corner talking amongst themselves and ignoring the tables. I like that they don't hover but I'd also like for someone to notice that my water glass is empty. The décor could use some help. It looks a little kitschy...like this was someone's idea of what silly Americans would think a Persian place should look like.,,1,

195,Gedda G.,"Bronx, NY",2,14,0,5.0,10/6/2011,"Being a resident of a completely different borough, I am still a ""regular"" in Pars, or rather, I am Pars' addict! even if you know nothing about Persian food (just like me a couple years ago), just pick a pretty name of the dish on the menu - there's really no dish there that you'll not fall in love with. However, my super favorite is kahske bademjan, which is a sauteed eggplant with herbs and spices or (for an appetizer) and shish kebob which is always so tender and so juicy! Their portions are more than just generous. I enjoy seating in the main area, where the atmosphere is more authentic, but for those who like to have a couple drinks to get prepared for a feast, there's a spacious bar with full liquor menu and a sweet barista.The service overall deserves a fair A+ as they always are very attentive. I am usually ordering very quick, but unlike many other places, the waitress never made me wait. The water is filled frequently (those spices!) and their bread is homemade and absolutely divine! All in all, great experience, strongly recommend.",,,
196,Jim M.,"Watertown, CT",0,16,0,5.0,10/5/2013,"Awesome! The food, the service, everything was great.  Ate there today and had kabobs and zareshk pollo. Absolutely delicious. October, but the big windows were open and it was like an open air experience. Then the manager sent over some desserts gratis. Amazing place. Highest recommendation!",,,
197,Alex A.,"Spotsylvania, VA",59,16,2,4.0,7/8/2013,"The food was very good,  one of the better persian restaurants in NYC. I thought that some of the prices were a little high. Service was somewhat slow, especially since they were not busy, but I would definitely be back.",,,

He kept checking in with us and basically answered all our demands with an outstanding service and exceptional food. It was extremely easy to tell that he uses only best ingredients for everything on your plate. I'm still here as I write this review waiting for desert and can't wait to come back with G. I highly recommend it. Merci.",,,
