0,Cyrus A.,"Manhattan, NY",138,79,73,5.0,11/11/2018,"Beer Shop is a fantastic beer vendor and neighborhood watering hole all wrapped into one small, clean location on the UWS. They always have ten or so beers on tap, ranging in style and brewer. Lots of smaller local/regional breweries get featured, as Beer Shop rotates its lineup regularly.In addition to the taps, the place is actually a beer shop. They have a set of fridges behind the bar with domestic and international varieties of beers (and ciders). These also rotate regularly, but the staff is always helpful if you have a particular brewery in mind, or if you want recommendations when looking for something new.The space is small, but they make the most of it, with a no-frills bar, a long bench with attached stools, a few small two-person tables, and a perch by the window up front. There's also a few outdoor seats when the weather's nice. Bonus points for a clean bathroom!Overall a great spot for beer enthusiasts and a nice stop if you're in the area, even if you aren't looking for beers to take home.",,,
1,Melissa P.,"New York, NY",13,81,14,4.0,11/18/2018,"Pretty hipster feeling location on the UWS. It has more of a Brooklyn feel than UWS; wood seating that isn't too comfortable and very trendy decor. The beer selection was pretty good, while the bartender was knowledgeable and kept to himself for the most part. The space is also quite small (as most of Manhattan spaces are), so this isn't really somewhere I would try to go with a group.",,,
2,Adjanie T.,"Bronx, NY",516,140,1026,5.0,3/24/2018,"Great place   Little place with great beers and lovely staff !      We were eager to come to this place. We came in and it was magical. The bartender made us feel at home. He found a chair for my nephew and instantly he guess our favorite beer flavor hahaha that is why I said its magical lol..   You can order tap beer or bottle beer.  The board had 10 different beers and we order 4 different ones to taste. My favorite,  number 9,  dark with chocolate flavor.  First time trying sour beer, it's wonderful.   Bought 2 beers to take home. They were a little expensive so don't come here to shop for beers every weekend LOL...   I will come back",55,33,56
3,Kristie P.,"Inwood, NY",162,98,292,4.0,7/21/2018,"Came here for a couple drinks Friday around 5. We were able to snag a table outside (pretty crazy since there are only two and the inside was pretty full). The staff was super friendly, helping me pick out some beers from the fridge in the back. They also have a small selection of beers on tap. No table service so make sure you order at the bar. Will definitely be coming back!",,,
4,Greg S.,"Beaverton, OR",167,362,182,4.0,5/11/2018,"This great little shop on the Upper West Side is a beer oasis. Mind you, I didn't actually drink a beer on their premises...traveling with a child can limit your options, but that's where Beer Shop NYC came to our rescue: a great selection of cans and bottles to go!Like everyone else these days, we're hooked on the Hazy New England style IPA's. The staff were incredibly friendly and happy to offer up some Hazy options. They chose some great ones! But sadly they also recommended a couple they said were Hazy when in fact they weren't. On my second visit to Beer Shop for some takeaways, I did a little more investigation on my own in tandem with their recommendations, and that made for a better experience.And as a bonus, If you're a beer lover that likes to try local beers when you travel, this place has a great selection of NY and NJ brews.",1,,
5,Jill L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,5.0,10/21/2018,"This place is awesome! Great selection of beer. Super chill spot to stop and have a pint. Make your own 6 pack or have Eric do it! Expertly curated for my hubby who likes IPAs, even went into the back to grab some special brews...friendly, helpful staff, and great local hangout.Great addition to the neighborhood! Tiny shop so don't miss it!",,,
6,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1325,2209,8239,3.0,11/29/2016,This is a decent place.  Came here with some friends from beer club to check it out to see if it would be suitable for a beer club gathering (it's not).   They had a nice variety of beers and the big table in the middle was fun to sit at.   The bros behind the counter weren't particularly engaging or outgoing compared to the folks at other beer stores like Top Hops. If you're in the neighborhood it's probably worth stopping by but I don't feel it is a destination type place.,4,2,2
7,Bill D.,"Astoria, NY",0,4,0,5.0,9/14/2018,"Great selection of beer, literally any kind of beer you may like, they have. Not sure what you like, they'll help you figure that out. Erik and Thomas are extremely knowledgeable and are nice and very helpful. By far the best place in the UWS for beer. I am a repeat customer because of them. Every time i bring a new person there, the fall in love with the place.",,,
8,Heather B.,"Tuxedo Park, NY",191,229,87,5.0,4/3/2017,"Came across this spot the other day and had to stop in. I love craft beer and was excited to try some new stuff. The bartenders were helpful and provided my friend and I with samples and recommendations. I loved that they had Hill Farmstead on tap which is a rare find!Space is super small which is the only downside, but other than that - it was a great time and a nice beer selection!",2,,
9,Deina S.,"San Jose, CA",1,30,12,5.0,6/6/2018,"The beer shop is definitely a place to check out while you are in the city! We actually met the owner and he was just a ray of sunshine. Told us all about the beers and where they came from, super passionate. We came in on a Wednesday and the flights were $10 for 4 beers. Love trying new beers.",,,
10,Alex T.,"Atlanta, GA",381,19,0,5.0,5/10/2018,"Great service, dope beer, reasonable prices for the rarity. Delicately will be back. I'm making this a little longer so it will post as a review. Blah blah blah",,,
11,Sydne P.,"Manhattan, NY",315,60,41,4.0,5/29/2018,Went here yesterday after spending some time at the park. Got asked to see my ID in which was probably supposed to be in a joking funny way but it was kind of weird. Beer was good and it was a really fair price. On Wednesday it's even $5 off that already good price! Super clean and fun little games on the table. I live far so probably won't be back soon but I enjoyed going.,,,
12,Nate C.,"Manhattan, NY",12,211,7,5.0,8/27/2017,"Good selection of local beers on draft plus a ton of variety in the fridges in the back. I would highly recommend getting a flight. Atmosphere is low key, and the vibes are super chill. There's also some outdoor seating so you can keep those low-key chill vibes flowing right on out to the Amsterdam sidewalk and watch the beautiful people of the Upper West Side stroll by",,,
13,Kelly E.,"New York, NY",124,399,56,4.0,11/27/2016,Enjoyed this place - has a nice neighborhood feel. You can go to the back and peruse the beer selection in the fridge or sit at the communal table and drink with some new neighborhood friends.You can get growlers here (certain specials each day of the week) but they do have a weird policy where you 1) buy the growler 2) cannot reuse the growler. I guess it just confused me why I would buy the growler separately (or rather they advertise it as such) if we can't reuse it? I gave up on that and just buy my fave beers to bring home from the back.,1,1,
14,Nick D.,"New York, NY",80,508,704,4.0,6/30/2016,"After being next door for lunch, we stumbled on this little shop. Very modern looking on the inside and seems fairly new. They had a pretty solid draft list going and what shocked me was they had two rare beers (Grimm, Mexican cake) that you could take growlers home. Usually with the more rare beers, they don't even allow growler fills so that was definitely a plus. You can also buy beer to go which is pretty normal now in the bee world.  I guess my only problem was the seating. The stools are not too comfortable and there is no ledge really to put your feet on so you're almost hanging off them leaving it to be slightly uncomfortable. But for the beer drinkers, this is definitely a nice little spot to stop, have a flight, and take some home.",3,,1
15,Eileen K.,"New York, NY",540,85,307,4.0,5/14/2017,"Not a bad neighborhood beer shop joint. They always change their drafts, even throughout the day! It is a small place that I would say probably seats 20 people only and it pretty narrow and tight inside. Some beers are extremely overpriced, but it's a cool spot to come check out what they have to offer. There are also board games available for people to play!",,,1
16,Nish S.,"Birmingham, MI",157,162,2212,4.0,5/5/2016,"This is a nice cozy bar which is very contemporary, friendly, not intimate. Decent snack selection. Beer selection is great. Staff very courteous. U was here with friends and we had real fun. Lots of beer for very good price.I tried their sampler which has a decent size.",3,,1
17,G S.,"Manhattan, NY",6,162,2,4.0,8/14/2016,A group of us stopped in here on a pub crawl. This was the group's favorite spot. The alcohol content was very high on some of the selections so my friends came out close to p-$$3d. I'm sad to read the below 3 star reviews but perhaps the feedback has been taken on board by the time we visited (so thanks for that). We've recommended it to fellow beer friends and would return again to try some more flights.,1,,
18,L G.,"New York, NY",22,118,26,4.0,9/25/2017,"A great little place in the wall that could be easily overlooked if you walk too fast, like most New Yorkers. We were guilty. We walked back and forth and missed this place twice before a kind waitress from another restaurant pointed it out to us. We tasted several beers on tap. Although some were super delicious and we could drink them all day, everyday, there were some that were very distasteful for our tastebuds. You can also buy bottled beers from a good selection in the fridge towards the back of the beer shop !",,,
19,Halvard L.,"New York, NY",0,4,0,5.0,10/5/2017,"Great spot on the UWS. The beer list is even updated on their website! Generally fantastic selection of beer, and very knowledgeable and courteous staff. If you need a place to go for good craft beer on the upper West side this is your place.",,,
20,Larry Z.,"East Hampton, NY",0,28,1,5.0,3/10/2018,Very cool place. Every town should have one.  Tremendous selection of beers.  Very helpful and knowledgeable staff.,,,
21,Chris M.,"Manhattan, NY",3,41,0,5.0,12/13/2016,"Visited about 8-10 times now.* bartenders (Matthew and Brad) are legitimately friendly, professional, and knowledgeable and I've done well by their retail bottle recommendations* have as representative a sampling of categories as the other 8-10 beers shops on Manhattan* the scene at the small bar + ~4 tables is your usual chill unpretentious beer-shop-bar crowd.  Also Brad and Matt are as capable as bartenders as they are as retail clerks.* you can drink a bottle purchase from the cooler at the bar for a small capping fee ($2, glass supplied).  Only one other shop in this city (Top Hops) does that as far as I know.* they stay open lateThe place isn't perfect:* bottles are about est. $1 more than at other shops.  That said, they're paying UWS rent and the next nearest shop is in East Midtown* only two coolers, instead of the usual 8-15, so about 70 import and 70 domestic facings (estimated)* (last time I checked) the chalkboard of what's on tap (15-20 beers, estimated) is always all lovely geeky USA craft beer, but nothing (my preferred) Belgian/UK/German/etc.Honestly it's a good shop.  Is it 5 stars compared to what it could be (size, selection) or compared to the best in the country?  No.  But it's up to par for a Manhattan beer shop and highly recommended if you live in the area.Again, special shoutout to Matt and Brad, who honestly halfway make this place what it is, imo.",1,,
22,Eric H.,"New York, NY",6,39,1,5.0,5/17/2017,"A new favorite. Mostly friendly staff, fantastic beers on draft. One of the coolest things this place does is of their 10 draft lines have each of those lines dedicated to a particular stylistic range of beer (or in the case of line 10, cider). Because of this one can always count on some variety on draft and know that they're going to find something within a particular taste profile they might prefer. Even in  some of the larger craft bars one cannot rely on variety.In addition to the 10 draft lines there is a modest selection of high quality bottled products in the back. No food is served but it's ""BYO"". Outdoor seating is available. Inside a communal table is offered which includes some games and such. Overall great vibe and setup. The only drawback to the places that it's quite small, but it's also intimate.The beer pours top quality. For craft beer lovers on the upper west side this is a must try establishment.",1,,2
23,Therese B.,"Manhattan, NY",25,18,1,5.0,6/28/2016,"I love this little spot. I stop all the time for new beers. The bartenders are all friendly, and made a point to all learn my name. Lots of times I simply say ""pick out some good ones"" and they've never disappointed me  YES. It's a bit pricier than a bar. But if you're looking for a 5 dollar shot of whiskey and a pbr this isn't the place for you. They have a solid selection of GREAT beers. And for that you need to pay an extra buck or two. Get a flight! It's a great deal and a good way to try a ton of different beer.",3,,1
24,John F.,"New York, NY",0,29,0,2.0,4/10/2016,"Come on guys, get your head out of your ass. This is a bare-bones bar that sells a glass of beer for $10. If you ask for peanuts it's four dollars extra. The fact that delivery packages lineup on the side under the owner's filthy jackets doesn't make it more attractive. The small sample sized trays are not advertised, or I was not cool enough to know about it. If you are a beer bar, show some love in the details - where is the collection of bottle-labels or caps or exotic beer bottles? There is no story in your bar. I was so excited to see this bar come to my neighborhood, but I simply can not pay 14$ (without tax or tip) for a glass of beer with peanuts in a self service bar. Please change before you are forced to close!!",3,,1
25,Nick C.,"Columbus, OH",7,68,5,1.0,6/18/2016,"We had a terrible customer service experience at the beer shop recently, which is pretty sad consider how much potential it has. One of the employees, Matt, was confrontational and actually tried to fight 4 of us for having forgotten about the $2 corking fee for a beer. I'll be shouting from the roof tops about how bad of an experience we had. Do not shop here!! Just go to whole foods, the selection is just as good, it's less expensive, and they deliver.",1,,
26,Evan H.,"New York, NY",314,781,44,5.0,12/29/2015,"After waiting for Beer Shop to open, I got a chance to stop in today. The tap selection is great, with most available for growlers. They seem to mostly feature New York beers, which is always appreciated, and they had a sour on tap (I hope there is more on that front).The selection of bottles and bombers in the back is also pretty nice. I saw most of my favorites represented. I wonder if they are able to get things in that they dont currently have.With the prices all listed as singles, custom 6-packs seem to be the way you do it here. I wonder if there is a discount for buying a 6-pack of the same beer. I look forward to coming back to try some of those taps.",4,,

Updated review",The Beer Shop is a welcome addition to the UWS. I come here often to grab a unique beer and their different beers on tap are always a plus for me.,1,,
28,Chris P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,6,5.0,10/7/2016,"As a draft beer lover, this little beer boutique is a gem down the road from me.A relatively small store but with well thought out selection of craft beers. Guys working there a knowledgeable and friendly. always asking how my puppy is. Oh they have outdoor seating so perfect for me to unwind with the puppy outside, weather permitting obviously.It's not the cheapest but I'd prefer pay a little more for a nice beer than pay little for a rack of terrible beer. Each to their own.",,,
29,Jan E.,"Lake Mary, FL",247,35,16,5.0,12/28/2015,"Great cold brew, craft beers. Owner Nick is always here to give you a suggestion. Plus you can craft an 6 pack of your favorites to go! Come check them out! Support locally owned!",2,,
30,Ben P.,"New York, NY",2,8,1,5.0,1/16/2016,Great spot! Interesting 10 beers on tap and lots of different bottles to try. $15 beers flights with four generous pours. Will be back for a growler of Other Half Hop Showers!,2,,
31,Anya V.,"Manhattan, NY",4,15,7,5.0,12/26/2015,"Great addition to the neighborhood! Part beer shop, part beer bar, they have a great selection of hand picked craft and microbrew beers. Tried a flight of four beers - the Prairie Bomb and Vietnamese coffee porter were my favorites! The owner and bartenders were super knowledgable and friendly. Check them out!",2,,
32,Evan T.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,1.0,2/25/2017,"Limited selection, but confusing layout. They have 2 doors of cider and 2 doors of beer, none of which is labeled by style or geography. 8 beers on tap, 7 of those bring 12oz pours for run-of-the-mill IPAs. The bartenders or employees seem to think that the customers are peasants who don't deserve their beer. Beware the corkage fee.",,,
33,Richard f.,"Bronxville, NY",0,16,0,4.0,8/16/2017,"Delivers on its promise.    Frequently rotating kegs offering a broad range of excellent ales; cool,engaging, understated vibe; friendly, personal service.  A place that knows what it wants to be, and how to be it.",,,
34,Seth G.,"Manhattan, NY",197,34,0,5.0,1/6/2017,"Great beer selection! Quiet, well-chosen music, great ambience, an excellent fixture.",,,
35,Joseph L.,"Brooklyn, NY",57,124,94,4.0,10/21/2016,"Cool little bottle shop. They have a decent selection of drafts. Also a pretty good bottle selection. They actually carried a session beer that I was looking for. So I was happy. They even have a small outside area. Perfect for chilling and drinking a beer during the summer. I do wish the selection of bottles was a little larger. Also its a little pricey, though I guess that's normal for the area. The staff was helpful and informative. Definitely try it if you are into craft beer and in the area.",,,
36,Erica M.,"Manhattan, NY",1,14,0,4.0,5/1/2016,"Here's the thing about Beer Shop -- it's a beer shop. It is not a rowdy club, a dive bar, or a pub. It's what the name implies, a place to buy a great selection of well-priced beer, cider, and mead. The small shop has an interesting selection of micro-brews and independent beers on tap that change out regularly. In addition, there are refrigerators in the back of the store with a large selection of bottles and cans from around the world that you can enjoy there or take home. The staff is friendly and helpful and make great recommendations -- they know their stuff. The only thing that would make it better is if they had koozies for the cans and bottles.",3,1,
37,Scott H.,"New York, NY",3,19,0,5.0,11/7/2016,This place is low-key awesome. Great beer selection and the guys who run it are cool. Backgammon and dominoes boards are available.,,,
38,John P.,"Queens, NY",155,594,399,2.0,1/28/2016,"The store has a good selection but it's extremely overpriced.  Not one draft was under $10.  George Keeley's, which is about 2 blocks away, is selling one of the beers they have on tap here for $4 less for the same size pour.  You can go through their entire draft list on beermenus and see that every one of their beers is $3-$4 more than anywhere else.  I won't be going back unless they change their prices to be in line with every other bar in the city.",5,3,3
39,Anthony G.,"Fairfield, CT",171,4,0,1.0,1/26/2016,"Overpriced and a absolute rip off. I give this place 6 months. Walk next door to any bar and get the same beer for half the price, or less. I live across the street, if this place doesn't drop their prices they're in trouble.",4,,
40,Rahul D.,"Manhattan, NY",4,23,0,2.0,1/20/2016,"The prices are way too high!  I was shocked to see 12oz pours costing $12!  There is no reason for that.  They are selling local NY brews which is great, but they are way overpriced.  I would recommend you check out Dive Bar a bit further up or go to City Swiggers on the UES where they pour delicious craft beers at $6-$8.  The bottle selection here has some interesting things, but it isn't huge and again it's too pricey.",3,,1
41,Shaun P.,"Long Beach, CA",2,16,1,4.0,4/10/2016,Good addition to my old neighborhood. Great beers that are tough to find in the UWS and the staff are mostly very friendly and helpful. Main drawbacks for me are some of the prices are kinda ridiculous. It's literally the only shop I make a point of checking prices in as it's easy to make a $60 six pack before tax and tip (seriously). On tap pricing structure is also a total mystery too as some beers are twice as much as other places in the city. My friends have also commented that the lighting is so bright that it deters them from sticking around.. Maybe that's the point)? Maybe you're not supposed to hang around too long? I'd definitely recommend this place. Some great beers and an overall fun experience. Wish they'd put the Edison bulbs to better use and dim the flood lights though. More competitive pricing would also be a bonus.,1,,
42,Brian K.,"Jersey City, NJ",32,4,0,2.0,2/10/2016,"The problem here is the pricing.  Sometimes they have items priced almost double what you can pay just a few blocks away.  It makes no sense to me.  They have a good selection and a nice space, but the pricing has to change or they will not remain open.  I paid $15 for a bottle of Grimm here before realizing it was selling for $9.75 at many other places.  There is a difference between profit and ripping off customers.",1,,1
43,David R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,4/16/2017,"Fantastic Selection of bottles and draft Beers.  Relaxed atmosphere.  Make sure to purchase Growlers, so that you can experience and appreciate this Gem of the UWS.",,,
44,Serge Z.,"Manhattan, NY",83,17,4,1.0,4/26/2016,"It's the attitude of the bartenders that gets me. Your beer selection isn't /that/ great, and even if it were, having a chip on your sh*lders isn't the way to run a successful business. They seem to be catering to some nonexistent or rare beer-snob crowd willing to pay too much and sit quietly before leaving. They don't have food, just overpriced snacks, but if you, say, try to bring a slice of cake from next door over for someone celebrating a birthday, the bartender will get upset. Or if you try to stay till their posted closing time instead of half an hour early when he wants to go home, the bartender will get upset. So I suggest helping them get their sleep and keep their blood pressures down by heading across the street to George Keeley where they have a good, reasonably priced beer selection and friendly servers, to boot.",4,1,2
45,Ashleigh Z.,"New York, NY",1,12,0,1.0,4/23/2016,"I was excited to see this place come to the UWS but disappointed by both of my experiences there. The place is overpriced, the bartender is surly and unaccommodating, and they very much try to get you to leave before closing. I understand that they want to get home after a day of work, but you can't make people leave even before you close, especially if they're spending hundreds of dollars. Beer Shop NYC seems ill suited for business in NYC, and I won't be returning.",3,1,1
46,Mike L.,"New York, NY",2,5,0,5.0,1/16/2016,I'm really excited that this place opened. They have great craft beers and play good music at a low level so you can speak to the person you're with without yelling.,2,,
47,Simon C.,"Paris, France",46,2,0,2.0,6/12/2016,"I'm not sure if this place is a bar or a beer shop, but in any case it fails at both. The beer selection on tap is good, but that's the only positive point. Seating is terrible, it's freezing inside, it's not cozy/intimate and the beer is more expensive than a regular bar. As a beer shop, they don't have that many choice and you can easily find most of the beers they have in a regular store.",,,
48,Jacqueline R.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,1/16/2016,"This is a long overdue addition to the UWS. Half bar, half retail beer shop with an awesome selection on tap and in bottles. Might have to make this a weekend regular.",1,,
