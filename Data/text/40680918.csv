Updated review","It is sometimes difficult to express perfection, but this evening's servings were just that. Luiz is an excellent waiter, careful, meticulous, and knowledgeable about what is being served. An appetizer of Halibut Tostadas that resembled mini tacos was delicious. It was comprised of fried halibut, guacamole mousse and tomato. Our entrees of fresh Alaskan King Salmon with spaghetti squash and beurre blanc and North Carolina Poulet Rouge (a special French breed) with fingerling potatoes and sautéed spinach were simply magnificent, prepared to perfection. This restaurant has talent in bringing in and preparing one of a kind delicacies. I always enjoy dining privately and peacefully with large space between tables. In addition to the meal I had to photograph their lemon meringue pie that looked fit for the taste of a king.",,,
1,Carol G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,1,1.0,11/11/2018,"In our household we call the proprietor ""goniff"" a Yiddish term with a literal translation of ""thief.""  That is due to the outrageously high prices at the restaurant and the store adjacent. Usually, however, the quality is worth the small fortune of dining here on a special occasion. Not lately. Today, the French toast we ordered, with a $16 price tag, looked like someone already ate a portion of it before serving it to us. See the photo to believe it. Do the math. $8 per (paltry) slice!  When we asked for another slice we were charged another $8. This was our last outing here despite the convenient location in an area of third Ave with too few brunch options.",,,
2,Kathy N.,"Sunnyside, NY",5,51,30,5.0,1/10/2018,"I had several great experiences here , Marco the bartender was my server . He really cares about making me the customer totally satisfied . The food is incredible, always fresh and delicious. Great ambiance and the store next door Eli's Market has excellent products but expensive( totally worth it).All of it is great all around, I highly recommend it.",1,,1
3,Rita G.,"Fair Haven, NJ",1,60,0,5.0,9/15/2018,"First visit to Eli's Table. Went for an early (6pm) dinner on a Saturday evening, seated promptly at a comfortable corner banquette. Well-heeled, older crowd. Sparse at first then the dining room was full by 7:30. Excellent, attentive service. Dimly lit, rustic and cozy ambience. The food: 5 stars all around for freshness and flavor. We enjoyed three dishes to start: the cheese plate, tomatoes and mozzarella and lamb ribs. The bread  was as fantastic as you'd expect from Eli....served with fresh creamy butter and sea salt. We shared the brisket as a main, and marveled at the tenderness and flavor of the meat and silky gravy. It is a lighter dish than expected, and happily so. Very, very good. Lastly, with  dinner we enjoyed a bottle of Vouvray. A thoroughly satisfying experience. Only disappointment was that we had no room for the amazing looking desserts. We will be back!",,,
4,Jill D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0,5.0,10/22/2018,"Eli - I love the butcher, cheese, produce and bakery products.  I shop here most when entertaining.  But please - why do you have the awkwardly large shopping carts?  They are so hard to use and it's almost a deterrent for me.  Yesterday I had to share the elevator with the poor girl who has to move the carts and she might hurt herself with that task.  Look at the carts in Grace's - they are just right!",,,
5,Sofia R.,"Weston, FL",0,17,11,4.0,11/12/2017,"The place is really nice inside, a bit crowded but it's NY.Brunch is really good. Also, the best thing is the jelly they serve, DELICIOUS!!! Service is a bit slow, but the food makes up for It. Definitely recommend.",,,
6,BRYAN C.,"Plainfield, NJ",3,13,0,1.0,9/15/2018,Went for brunch. Ordered a pastrami sandwich. The bread was amazing. There were probably 4 slices of pastrami. There was more mustard than pastrami. I did not ask for mustard. The waiter did not bother to stop by our table and ask us how our food was??? They added a 20% gratuity for our party of 5. My daughter did like the jam...,,,
7,Jia L.,"Philadelphia, PA",133,137,258,4.0,6/21/2017,"I'm surprised at the few reviews available here -- and def wish I had more reviews to consider before choosing my dish! Major regrets for not getting the soft shell crab. It didn't sound like a specialty so I stuck with the salmon...like I said, major regrets. Salmon wasn't bad but the soft shell crab I nicked was basted in butter, crispy without being overfried, with a healthy crab to batter ratio. Much better than the version in some Japanese restaurants. Anyway. A cosy little place with decent food - probably a little overpriced. The appetizers - burrata, tuna tartare, flatbread, octopus - were good. The octopus was perhaps great, in being cooked just the right amount, not necessarily in an innovative way. As for the mains, like I mentioned...that soft shelled crab. We picked a bunch of desserts to share too, and they were interesting but not fantastic. It was all stone fruit themed, much to some of our party's chagrin. The banana cream pie was solid - not quite a pie though, as it didn't have a defined crust, and had the consistency of a slice of cake. The stone fruit stew with sour cream was good, but I say this without much prior experience with stone fruit stews in general. The crostada was honestly a pizza, and I liked the vanilla ice cream on top more than the pastry itself. The wine was very good, of course. All in all a solid fun meal, not too stuffy, great food. Probably not somewhere I'd return if I had to pay, but otherwise pleasant. 3.5",,,
8,Teresa H.,"New York, NY",161,388,17,2.0,4/11/2016,"Much like their grocery, this is an overpriced establishment.  We had a very, very mediocre experience here.  Came with another couple for an 8:30 reservation.  By the time we arrived, 2 of the 3 seafood menu items were no longer available.  Bummer.  The braised artichokes appetizer was bland and the artichokes had not been properly cleaned, leaving some of the stiff leaves for us to pick around.  Yuck.  I had the striped bass, which was good, but my husband thought his chicken was only so-so.  The lemon meringue cake was interesting, in a good way.Service was fine and the space itself is very pretty, but we were just totally underwhelmed.",3,,
9,Liam C.,"New York, NY",0,15,0,2.0,12/17/2017,"Pretty average food at a high price. I stopped by for brunch here and for some decent (but not great) brunch food and two mimosa's it cost close to $100. Overall it felt like a bit of a price gouge. It's a pity - its a nice little space, but all in all I could have got the same thing elsewhere for half the price. I'd skip out on this one unless they decide to review their prices downwards..",,,
10,Molly S.,"New York, NY",103,527,405,4.0,5/24/2016,"Great for brunch! UES doesn't have a whole lot of options for early weekend ~morning~ people, so luckily this place opens earlier than most. We came in at 9:30ishAM on a Saturday and there were only a few people..they have lots of two seater tables with a squishy couch...if your brunch-mate is nice they'll give you the couch :P. I ordered the spinach quiche, bf ordered the spinach omlette, both were great! And came with a nice side salad, huge portion. Pre-brunch bread is not included so order a croissant to eat with the giant jar of jelly on the table. The croissant is HUGE..we're talking the size of your head. Also not super pricey, all food + coffee and tip was about $20/pp. The service was a tad slow...aka we had to wave them down for more coffee and I chugged my water too often and was left empty. But overall a great little cafe feel, cute tables, varied well-priced menu and friendly service.",,1,

Updated review","Writing my second review of Eli's, as it has been years since I last commented. 1. The wine is absurd, both in selection and value; that list is my paradise.  And Randall, the director, is a consummate host who, despite his encyclopedic knowledge of wine, makes even the most novice wine-drinker feel special and happy. 2. The food is varied and consistently delicious, with a specific emphasis on the absolute best provenance and quality of products. 3. The staff is one of the nicest families you've ever met. 4. Even considering 3, above, the bartender, Marco, must be the nicest bartender in NYC, and his whiskey knowledge (and selection) is not too shabby. 5. The tables are spaced far apart so you have total privacy. Yup, I like Eli's.",,1,
12,Paul M.,"Manhattan, NY",119,132,112,4.0,11/12/2015,"Eli's has a dizzying assortment of bottles priced at $300 per.  Thankfully, as shown above, that is not all they had.  Also, the adjoining wine store had some terrific and hard to find Burgundies.  Côte de Nuit St Georges, Chassagne-Montrachet (in white AND red), Beaune, Meursault, etc.  I could have talked wine with these blokes all night.  Great find.Have some of the homemade chips/crisps whatever.  You will not be disappointed.",,1,1
13,Richard C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,4,0,1.0,8/26/2017,"A disappointment. My wife and I had lunch there today.Foolishly expensive ($7.50 for a glass of OJ). The bread was hard and dry - I had to snap it rather than break it. The fried egg on my roast beef hash was cooked solid. They replaced it graciously enough but the replacement was as tough. The roast beef hash, too, was dry. Everything seemed to be leftovers from Fri night.The service was good and the restaurant itself is pleasant.",,,
14,Perry T.,"Manhattan, NY",101,439,0,4.0,8/3/2016,"Came here last night for drinks and dinner and was very pleased! Eli's Table has an incredible wine selection and a great menu that covers classic American food (sliders, steak, chicken, salmon, etc.). Sitting at the bar, we had a light champagne with fried zucchini and halibut tostadas. We then moved to a table by the window for dinner, sharing a delicious bottle of white burgundy, octopus, salmon and chicken. Food is delicious, wine selection is extensive, and above all the service is top notch.",1,1,1
15,Katherine P.,"New York, NY",132,95,4,4.0,1/19/2017,"They actually serve dinner here, so I'm not sure why it's not also classified as a dinner place. Anyway, everything was extremely fresh and the food was fantastic. I usually skip the bread but I couldn't stop eating it here. I went with colleagues so not sure I would make the trek up for it on my own but I highly recommend it for anyone who is in the neighborhood or willing to travel outside of the midtown area.",1,,
16,Catherine M.,"Northport, NY",57,10,0,5.0,3/10/2017,"I have fallen in love with this neighborhood gem.  Every experience that I have had with Eli's (including the restaurant, wine shop, flower shop and market) has beem exemplary. The staff is the most knowledgeable, friendly, warm, and kind group of people I have encountered in Manhattan.  They have studied the food, wine and spirits and are happy to describe and explain the origins, sourcing, and presentation. I expecially want to acknowledge the bartender Marcos.  He took time describe and allowed us to taste several different wines we were considering.The design and decor of the restaurant is unique and romantic with large wine barrels, salvaged wood table tops, dim lighting and table tops spaced enough for intimate conversation.  The bathrooms are beautifully designed with cloth hand towels and scented candles.The food is locally sourced and organic wherever possible.  Presentation is classically elegant. Some favorites are the halibut tostadas- perfect bites of crispy halibut with mashed avocado on a crispy chip, Dover sole- beatiful filet, amazingly fresh and clean flavor, and Poulet rouge- super juicy breast with perfectly crispy skin served with fresh peppery greens. Also, don't miss the complimentary homemade bread served with Fruity olive oil for dipping.The wine list is one of the most extensive, unique and well priced in the city.  They focus on small batch producers.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable and willing to let you taste each of the wines.",,,
17,Joey R.,"Mount Hope, Bronx, NY",0,3,1,2.0,10/23/2015,I did not try the food but the staff is really nice an the wine is great. Having a sommelier on had is really nice if you don't know what to choose but feel that they can be more attentive. Feel since I'm not a regular or buying a more expensive glass of wine I'm not that important. I been to places an bought less expensive drinks but got way more,3,,
18,Josie C.,"New York, NY",7,51,5,1.0,10/3/2016,"Came for Saturday breakfast at 10am. Used to frequent this place years ago. Everything has changed. The quality of the food is still great but the service , preparation and presentation has declined so much that it is now a case of the emperor has no clothes. My salmon was hacked and the other dishes looked like they had been thrown at the plate. Incredibly sloppy especially since it took over an hour to get our meal at a time there were just 4 other occupied tables. We also received 3 of 5 dishes, then another was served while the missing items from the first three were brought out and almost 10 minutes later got the last person's meal- of all things, oatmeal. When it came time to clear our plates, it was so awkward all conversation stopped. The people who work there are very nice in demeanor but need some training as in how to wait on customers, serve plates and clear a table. For the prices we pay to go to Eli's some attention to detail is expected. This was beyond disappointing. Prices are up, portions are smaller and the service is atrocious.",2,,
19,Melanie R.,"New York, NY",11,39,0,2.0,6/30/2017,"What happened?  This was one of my favorite East Side haunts.  A testimony to good taste, even Eli eats here with his extended family.  The menu was varied and imaginative, the wine list a treasure, and the staff attentive and yes, it was pricy but the portions were ample and you owned the real estate for the evening.  I worried, it was rarely crowded but didn't expect to spend the evening as the only ones in the restaurant--two at the bar--and a mother and daughter who stopped in for an appetizer and then disappeared.  But after a dinner where Eli's special Jerusalem bread and sweet butter was the best dish we had, we were virtually ignored by the staff--our waiter disappeared and we had to ask another waitress to order dessert--the menu was standard restaurant fare-generic-salmon, steak,pasta and chicken and soft shell crab--everything that could either be assembled, or cooked quickly by a cook, not a chef--and a $12 coconut Sunday--a scoop of ice cream, chocolate sauce and toasted coconut which went with the $6 cup of coffee--We were so shocked we asked if there was a new chef.  We settled on the soft shell crabs--2 crabs hanging on to a bed of macie lettice--well, not quite a bed, more some shreads--dripping in butter, rubbery and not very appealing.  Granted, not fair to review a restaurant about to close for the long Fourth weekend--but brunch there, a new introduction ,should have been an early warning.  French toast on brioche was two sad little pieces of brioche bread that tasted and looked like it had been cooked sometime earlier--whatever my companion had, it wasn't memorable--but it was crowded and we could forgive the waiter for being brusque when we asked for butter and maple syrup.There are too many restaurants on the upper east side with generic menus and average food.  But Eli's remains the only one with that great bread!  Is that enough?",,,
20,Kat C.,"Woodside, NY",4,38,28,5.0,11/6/2016,Food is fresh and made with quality ingredients. The wine is also awesome. Had Hope as my server and she was very knowledgeable and attentive. Rest of the staff was also super sweet. Would absolutely come here again.,,,
21,Sylvie M.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1,25,0,4.0,12/8/2016,Eli's table has a good ambience. The service  was okay and the food was good. There were about 5 of us there and we were easily accommodated which was nice.,,,
22,Bruce E.,"Hagerstown, MD",0,97,0,4.0,4/5/2015,Many good brunch visits and each has been fun.  Service is excellent along with raspberry jam and bread basket.  Price seems high but value is truly amazing.  Portions are generous and preparation is top notch.  Roast beef hash lox and eggs and goat cheese spinach omelette today were great with their unique Zabar matzoh.   Missed the usual bread basket for holiday of Passover.  Warm butter is also nice touch,,1,
23,l. s.,"Pittsburgh, PA",0,12,0,5.0,9/19/2016,"Love this place! Delicious food, all fresh and simply prepared. No over used sauces or fish sitting in olive oil. So refreshing for the UES. The service is attentive, and the ambiance very nice. The tables are not squished together and one can have a pleasant conversation because the noise level is not bad. We love Eli's.",,,
24,Ray W.,"Toronto, Canada",8,61,1,1.0,11/8/2015,Poor service (ie non existent). Ordered the eggs Benedict which costs 16 bucks when I wanted the salmon version they charged 5 more. So for 21 bucks I got two tiny brioche which literally 2 slivers of salmon. Don't get me wrong if price and quality/qty match... I have no issue. But not here. Avoid.,4,,
25,Sallie B.,"Manhattan, NY",178,4,0,1.0,10/11/2015,"BIG disappointment!  The wait staff is nowhere to be seen, the food is expensive and only fair. Before remodeling, this restaurant was aptly named, TASTE; white tablecloths, a medium din & lively ambiance, an attentive wait staff & excellent food -- all only a memory.  After waiting more than fifteen minutes, I finally got up to find a waiter to take our drink order.  I got up three more times to find our waitress.  Two in our party ordered the $18. lobster roll appetizer; both were surprised to find only one tiny piece of lobster inside.  My $38. swordfish was delicious but the bed of vegetables beneath, was not up to par.  I asked for a slice of lemon twice only to have to get up to find our waitress to ask a third time.  (I never get up in restaurants)! We were told the remodeling was to bring in a young, hip crowd that loves loud music and bare tables.  The restaurant was almost empty on a Saturday night.  We will not return.",6,,
26,Martin E.,"Manhattan, NY",0,11,0,4.0,4/13/2016,"Hard to defend the prices and/or quality in any of Eli's establishments but I think most locals know that going in. I still find it amazing there are so many locations, I've never met anyone who has been particularly impressed. This is a good option for brunch with kids on the weekend. The staff is very accommodating.",,1,
27,Sandy W.,"Malibu, CA",0,14,0,4.0,3/11/2016,"This is a fun, good place with great food and a real neighborhood feel. The bar is welcoming and friendly (with great potato chips) and table service was great. Nice selection of food and a large (too big?) wine list. But servers are helpful and provide good recommendations. The lemon merengue cake us fantastic!",,1,
28,Sky A.,"Manhattan, NY",2,10,0,4.0,2/28/2015,Great steak and pasta dish. The dessert was tasty - a complex maple custard that went great with a port. No idea why the place wasn't packed. Hidden gem - hope people find it so it sticks around.,,1,
29,John Y.,"New York, NY",0,2,0,5.0,1/5/2016,"A huge fan of this establishment. The ambiance is always very sophisticated (even when there's a newborn baby around) and the interiors are decorated with great taste. There is always something to admire from each seat of the restaurant.The food is always fresh and very well curated, working with what's in the season. I have a hard time choosing between breakfast and dinner as they are both delicious in their own right. The wine selection is also excellent - you can find rare and delicious wine here marked perhaps slightly higher than other New York City restaurants, but the quality makes it worth while. We give the blueberry pancakes all of our thumbs up!",,1,1
30,Dayle B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,1.0,7/6/2015,Eli's Table has been recently renovated and I am quite sure that Eli has paid for his renovation by serving his patrons half portions of food.  The halibut tostadas although tasty were minuscule. The fig salad was so small I could count the Arugula  leaves in one hand. really?,5,2,1
31,Ben T.,"Roswell, GA",270,474,16,3.0,6/15/2015,"Located in the Upper East Side we came into Eli's Table for after dinner drinks and sat at the bar with some new friends. My review is based on a glass of wine and one mixed cocktail. First off, the space is beautiful. In my opinion it's decorated well with a dark romantic French vibe. The volume of patrons was lacking for a Saturday night as the bar was mostly empty. Being my first time in NYC I figured most people were headed downtown by this time? Either way our service was decent but slightly lacking considering the low volume at the bar. My cocktail was fine but I have honestly had better. The old fashioned was one noted with smokey tones dominating the drink. I was excited to learn the bartender makes his own bitters and mixers which show dedication to the craft however I felt the recipe needed a little refinement. Overall for my brief stay I had a great time but felt they needed to do a little more to make this an extraordinary experience. Thanks!",,,
32,Lee M.,"Hightstown, NJ",2,38,0,4.0,11/15/2014,"I messed up on the name of the restaurant. The name is "" Taste. ""New restaurant having a soft opening. Did not eat but the bar is great. Will return for diner soon. Looked at menus if they can execute it will be a winner!",,1,
33,Jonathan S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,10,0,2.0,5/14/2016,"Had an impressively bad brunch here. Let me preface this by saying I'm a fan of the Eli's franchise in general, but had never been here because of the mixed reviews. However, some friends suggested brunch and I went along with them. I knew we were off to a bad start when our server interpreted ""grilled cheese and grapefruit"" as ""grilled cheese on grapefruit"" without batting an eye, then when told it would be shared demanded to know with whom it would be shared.  Next came the corn bread, which tasted identical to the corn bread at Boston Market. The problems continued when our entrees arrived - or rather mine never arrived. One person received the wrong omelette and did not send it back, reasoning that it would take too long and he was ok with the dish he was given - however 10 minutes later the correct omelette arrived. We tried to explain that we would take it but would obviously not pay for both - he responded by taking away the correct omelette and saying he would send over the manager. In his defense, I don't think he spoke a word of English. Highlights of the conversation around the table included ""this tastes like airplane food"" and ""why would you serve lox without cream cheese."" When our server arrived to ask how everything was and we listed the problems, she said she would tell the manager and he ""might"" come over. Needless to say he never did despite 2 different employees relaying our complaints. To their credit when the check arrived both omelettes and the food that never came were not on it. Of note, a glass of milk in a paper cup for my daughter cost $3. Prices were average for the upper east side, but for that a certain level of quality is expected. It has been suggested that their business model is to deal with mediocre food and service lapses by providing discounts in response to complaints, paid for by inflated prices, rather than trying to improve quality and service. If this is indeed their plan, it seems to be working. Food and service get one star - the extra is for the ambiance, which was quite nice.",3,,
34,Matthew D.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,2,0,2.0,12/9/2014,"I arranged a brunch at Eli's Table this past Sunday for a party of nine. On the same day I made the reservation, I called the restaurant to let them know that one member of the party was elderly and used a walker to get around. They assured me this wasn't a problem and was something they were prepared to deal with, including ensuring that person could get in a back way that didn't use steps. They never made any record on our reservation of this conversation and never did anything to help us with that party member. I called several days later to ask about prearranging a cake or a different celebratory dessert for the two party members celebrating birthdays. After a long conversation with a manager, we agreed on two servings of two different desserts. The person I spoke to, however, simply lied to me to get me off the phone and did not make any notation that party members were celebrating birthdays and we'd asked for dessert for them. On the day of, I was eventually able to run down a maitre d' who arranged for a cake of a totally different type that I was told on the phone wouldn't have been an option, but it required me to run around the restaurant chasing staff down, and then making a separate request for plates to eat the cake on and another for silverware to eat it with, neither of which were provided. Additionally, waiters and servers seemed severely over worked, our coffees and waters were never refilled unless we flagged someone down to ask for it, no one ever came to our table to check on us. The food was good, competent executions of various brunch standbys, but I left with a real sour feeling and won't go back.",5,,
