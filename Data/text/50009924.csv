My mom ordered the chorizo wrap and said tasted like it had bits of plastic in it. She was unable to swallow it so it was tossed in the trash. Unfortunately, we sat close to the restroom, worst mistake ever! The restroom stunk soo bad - the smell of crap wafting in the air, it made you lose your appetite almost immediately. In addition, the workers gave us odd looks the whole time we were there. One of them glared as I passed the chip area, like what, do you think I'm going to steal a chip bag? As a matter of fact, another lady was actually stealing chips while they were fixated on us. We will never come back here, overall not a good experience.",,,

Updated review","Toasties is a busy place after Mass on a Sunday.  They are not the fastest place, but the quality of their food is better than most off these breakfast/lunch places.  A scrambled egg platter will put a smile on your face.  It is around the corner but worth the visit!",3,1,1
3,Alex W.,"Boise, ID",12,229,363,5.0,7/26/2018,"I can't believe I haven't been to this place sooner-- it literally has it all!  Pizza, salads, sandwiches, snacks, etc.  They offer so many amazing sandwich combinations, it would take you days to read over the menu and decide.  I went with the ""Popeye"" sandwich: grilled chicken breast, melted mozzarella, spinach, alfalfa sprouts, roasted red peppers, shredded cabbage, romaine, honey mustard, and I added balsamic vinaigrette.  WOW!  What a tasty, and filling sandwich!  It was also pretty reasonably priced for around $9, so not bad at all.  The service is also very fast & the employees are friendly. Make sure you stop in when you're in midtown if you're looking for healthy, tasty, and cheap options!",3,,1

6,Frank W.,"New York, NY",217,104,69,4.0,11/30/2017,"Faster than fast food!! Toasties has a monopoly on the midtown, lunchtime sandwich scene. Their sandwiches are superior to Pot Belly, Lenny's, Subway, and all those random delis found at every other corner. And they have more than just sandwiches! With a hot food selection, plus salad bar they offer more variety at a reasonable price than any other quick-service lunch spot in midtown. They're run like a well-oiled machine. Toasties also has an excellent reward system - buy 9 sandwiches, get the next one free!

Both were pretty good, nothing special, just good. We got a side of fruit, it was fairly fresh and tasted fine. The drink and chip selection is much better in the back than up front, which is weird.

Updated review","TL; DR: Take your business elsewhere, as I will be doing with all my future personal and corporate catering needs.Full kvetch of a real time lunch review fail blog:I've been hearing from multiple co-workers that Toasties has gone down hill...or they registered surprise when they heard someone still liked/ordered from them...et al.  While I've been dealing with this location for just shy of three years, it has only been through delivery and catering for the various companies I support.  So I figured I'd give another try today, in person.Placed a pick up salad order.  Schlepped a couple avenues.  Went to the register.  Was redirected to pick my greens up at the pick up counter.  I didn't see a pick up counter.  Communication was trying - at best - so I walk in the direction the woman was insisting I go...until...""OH!  *she turns to look at bag right next to her* Christopher?""I nodded yes...and was given my bag.*blink....blink*Schlep back to the office.  Open the bag.  Salad is chopped, though I selected not chopped...and looked to be without dressing.Repeated schlep.  Went to the salad guys this time.  Explained there was no dressing.  They didn't understand...or were not believing me.....When I pull out the salad, they both registered a look of recognition, and pointed to the register.The new woman at the register - who was the first (out of four) employees to be able to clearly communicate and give proper, nice customer service - literally dropped her shoulders and head when I pulled out the salad; she also recognized it.  She told me there was dressing, just very light, and they were aware that it dries up very quickly (Mgmt: why are any of your dressings non-coating, regardless of them being light or cream-based?!).  She then kindly instructed me to ask the guys to give me more, letting me know that she watched them make it, and understood my issue (read: she knew they were being stingy, said something, and lost that battle).I went back to the salad guys, who already had a side of dressing waiting for me (so it really was that easy to simply give a returning, dissatisfied customer that for which he paid...)....though it barely filled half of the container (it was a tablespoon...at most).All that, a wasted lunch break, having to stop at a mini deli to pick up dressing...and the salad was no better or fresher (in some cases worse) than less expensive area competitors...plus I can get nearly the same sandwiches/soups/goods at any number of said competitors?No thank you.",6,1,1

The guy ahead of me had an iced vanilla coffee, which I decided to copy. The coffee was really refreshing and not bitter, which many iced coffees can be. My granola was yummy and really filling.

The line to order was long but moved fairly quick. I ordered a spicy grilled chicken on pita. Waiting for my order, after I paid, took a while. People were constantly checking the time since the food seemed to be taking forever.I brought my food back to the office and while it smelled good, it tasted just okay. My pita fell apart from the heaviness of all the ingredients they used. The chicken wasn't bad but definitely wasn't the best I've had.

33,Stephanie S.,"Las Vegas, NV",210,226,143,3.0,4/10/2015,"Toasties is your run-of-the-mill overpriced midtown deli - nothing to run across town for, but irresistible only for its convenience. If you work at 488 Madison, you can also ask the security guard about the not-so-secret door that leads you directly to Toasties without having to leave the building!I use seamless (by googling ""Toasties 51"") to check their daily soup menu, and make the trip downstairs for lunch when they're serving the creamy Corn Chowder or Spicy Kale with Tofu options.Their sandwiches are made extremely fast and fresh, and I love the eggplant parmesan on whole wheat bread with avocados for $1 extra (you know, to make it healthier!)They have well-stocked shelves of potato chips, but they often run out of the Deep River low-sodium kettle-cooked chips I lean towards (when that happens, I usually just ""settle"" for barbecue.)I'm not really a salad person, but next to the salad bar they serve a hot lunch buffet. Their mac and cheese will usually hit the spot for a comfort-food craving but it's CREAMY not baked, and the cheese tastes like processed American (not cheddar, gruyere, or any of that fancy stuff!)",1,,1

When we went in, we were not greeted and I noticed there was both a salad side and a sandwich side.As for the sandwich, I ordered the union sq. It was pretty good up until I noticed as I ate more and more, my sandwich was trenched in spicy mustard and I was unable to fully enjoy my sandwich anymore. It was quick to make, probably took about 10 minutes. As for the salad side... I was very disappointed at a nice cafe like this. As I was waiting for my sandwich, I walked over to take a look at the seating area. Three employees behind the salad side started getting extremely creepy and actually bent lower to look through the salad bar glass. On top of that, they started ""meowing"" literally. I looked at them and apparently they were meowing to me and at a distance, I asked why on earth are you meowing to me? They laughed and continued in a even more creepy way and I felt super harassed and uncomfortable. Terrible!Aside from that, I wish I had enjoyed the food and atmosphere more but without the unnecessary uncomfortableness.",1,,

The product is a bit fresher, and there's way more options.

However, it does get crowded at lunch and therefore figuring out what line you're standing in can be a bit tricky. Also, there is a handful of tables, if you want to stay and eat, but you basically have to get lucky with someone leaving at the time you want to sit down.Bathroom: I'm not sure if there is one available for customers.Staff: They guy that made my sandwich was rather quick and the cashier was helpful for a n00b like me (patiently waiting as I grabbed a bottled drink).Food: I had a pastrami sandwich (which was actually pretty tasty and a decent size for the price) and a bag of chips with a bottled drink.Value: You pay about what you'd expect for a chain sandwich place. And the food is decent so you only feel like you're overpaying by just a dollar or two.It was a fine experience and sandwich, something new for me, but I won't be placing this into the normal list of lunch spots as it really didn't ""wow"" me.",,,

We needed a quick and cheap bite to eat one Sunday morning when we came through the city for a few hours en route to our final holiday destination. We were seeing the tree, of course, and wanted a place close to Rockefeller Center. My husband pulled up Toasties on Yelp and we decided to give it a shot. This must be a new chain since I left NYC a few years back, and I am wishing it was around during my New York days! Toasties did not disappoint at all. It was about noon when we came, and despite being full of patrons, it did not seem busy or crowded. There were so many options for sandwiches and soups and salads, but we opted for a late breakfast. We ordered way too much food - but then again, the portions were enormous. I had a Greek omelette, hubs had the strawberry pancakes, we split a bagel (provided by H&H Bagels! yay!), and got some OJ. The omelette was good - plenty of feta stuffed into it and a fair amount of tomatoes - and certainly more than I could eat at once. It came with toast and hash browns (mmmmmm). Hubby's pancakes also hit the spot. Certainly nothing fancy about them, but they were hot and filling and decently flavorful. The bagel was good as well, although by the time we attempted to eat it, I was stuffed to the gills from my oversized omelette order. The OJ was packaged as if it was freshly squeezed, but it was definitely from a box. Oh well, you can't win them all. Toasties is also really CLEAN (the bathrooms are great, too, and saved me in an emergency diaper change for the little one), which you don't always get in similarly priced places.",,,1

Are you kidding me?All the cabs were full.I walked from one end of the island to the other end but there was a stupid parade on 7th ave. Loud horrible music. I just wanted to eat.I could smell something in the distance....I followed the smell. The smell led me to Toasties. I was planning on a nice brunch at a nice French restaurant but oh well, I settled for Toasties.It was pretty good. I had a huevo ranchero wrap- eggs, cheese, and salsa in a wrap. They made it right after I ordered so it was nice and piping hot! Yum. The place was clean, has a small seating area.This was not my idea of brunch but hey, for $5, I was pretty happy with what I got.",,,2
57,Suanne L.,"Brooklyn, NY",199,956,810,5.0,2/23/2013,"Toasties is the best hot sandwich I've had in a really long time! I am absolutely a fan. During one particularly cold day, my new coworker took me to Toasties, vouching for its excellent fresh meats and hot sandwiches. He was a big fan of the Faddy Natalie, which has fresh turkey - not the processed Boar's Head deli meat. Like an actual turkey breast out of the oven. I had my eye on another prize: the daily special. Spicy pastrami with coleslaw, chipotle sauce, cheese, and huge chunks of really tender pastrami. It was tender, juicy, flavorful, fatty, spicy, and had a great mix of textures. LOVE.Other notes: The location is bright and clean, with fast service. Price point is great for the area ($8-10 for a sammie). They also do salads, cold deli sandwiches, and a hot entree with sides. There is seating for 20-30, which is very Ikea - white and minimalist and clean. The drinks are on a side cold case, which is a bit out of the way. Service is fast, especially during the lunch rush, and can be a bit of a rushed show. They deliver too!",3,,2

They also have steak from time to time by the pastrami, the steak is also juicy. You can request to have both on one sandwich or just go with the steak. Either or you won't be disappointed.",,,

I'll also say that this review is about this Toasties in particular, and is based solely on service and their treatment of their customers. What I want from my Toasties breakfast is simple - a large, filling breakfast wrap and an Iced Coffee...and I prefer to get in and out as quick as possible. Do I pay before my wrap is ready? Yes. Am I willing to pay more for extra eggs? Of course. But today, in an attempt to add extra eggs, I was told I could not. I did add tomatoes and spinach. I then paid for my wrap and coffee at the register, before my wrap was done. When my wrap was given to me, the man who made it proceeded to ask for an extra dollar because of the ""vegetables"" I added. Sure, I'm definitely overreacting here. Toasties is solid as can be, and I will continue to be a customer. But when there are 4 Locations (plus two Lenny's locations) within three blocks of where I work in midtown, there is ZERO chance of me going to this one.",1,1,

If they did use dressing it was so little that I could barely tasted it over the burnt grill chicken on one of the chicken pieces. I am not saying the whole chicken was burnt but it was definitely over cooked/dry and burnt on the thinner side. For $10.00 a sandwich you would think the quality would be better. I was curious about their store policy and phoned in and the girl who answered the phone was really nice and accommodating and said that if I was still in the office they would send someone over to see what the problem was and refunded me the money. Well, that's too late since I went home already, but good to know that they put their customer first. She also mention that they didn't received any picked up order today from their shop but the guy that I placed it with in the office said he definitely went to this Toasties on 51st street.

This was clearly the work of the Midtown Corporate crew.Toasties sux, its a glorified Subway that sells H&H bagels in the morning; which is its only redeeming quality. In all honesty a sandwich, chips, and drink would cost you almost $14 here. Which is absolutely ludacris for the junk they are serving up. There are about 1000 places in Manhattan that does what toasties does (toss salads, put together overpriced mediocre sandwiches)Don't go here, message me if you need a good midtown lunch. Because for what you'll spend on 1 meal at toasties, I'll get you lunch for 3 days and they'll all destroy toasties in quality and taste.",3,2,

They have a great selection of hot sandwiches. I was introduced to this deli, by a colleague and then got my whole team to then follow suit. The boys love it, because of the large hero rolls for their monster cheesesteaks.  My favorite sandwich if I have to pick one is the Sergeant Sweet Pepper which is a chicken cutlet, mozarella and sweet peppers and its warm. I am usually pleasant after I eat this sandwich. LOL. But they also have a turkey sandwich, from their carving station area. Yum, freshly carved turkey, bacon and a herbal mayonnaise. What I do appreciate about Toasties, is their efficiency when placing an order. They are definitely crowded with all the finance heads during lunch,but the number system keeps it moving.",,,

This place is great during the lunch rush, however I found that it wasn't as good as it's sister store just a couple blocks down, hence the 4 star review.That being said, the food here is good and cheap, so if you're around I would definitely stop in and give it a shot.",,,

131,Michael F.,"New York, NY",519,391,85,4.0,4/6/2010,"They have the best sandwich ever, The ""Thanksgiving Special"": turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and gravy on the bread of your choice.When I was living in LA, I'd go to the Stage Deli from time to time, where I was introduced to a sandwich known as the ""Danny DeVito."" This sandwich was a lot like the Thanksgiving Special listed above without the gravy, and on rye bread with a little bit of mayo. IT IS FREAKIN' HEAVENLY.Just sayin'.Oh yeah, and it's downstairs from where I work, so it's damn convenient.",4,2,2

133,Michaela E.,"Brooklyn, NY",47,56,57,4.0,8/11/2010,"I love Toasties! Having lived in the UK with sandwich shops lined with fridges of preprepared grub for the past 10 years, I initially found places like Toasties really confusing... I realise now it's probably meant to be, just to highlight how amazing the guys making the sandwiches, wraps and rolls really are. I am absolutely mesmerised by the skill of not only hearing and remembering the shouts of each order in the chaos, but how perfectly they create each piece. Everything they make is huge! The rolls in particular must feed people for lunch and dinner. My absolute favourite is a Sophie Blue wrap... Lettuce, cucumber, green peas, avocado, blue cheese and grilled chicken. Lushness!",1,,
134,Quincy G.,"Brooklyn, NY",8,62,0,4.0,4/23/2010,"If you have a very long and important meeting to go to after lunch, then don't go to this place because everything they make is so good that it will put you into a food coma if you're not careful!  I'm partial to:- Spicy Marvin with no cheese which is hot peppers, meat loaf, and bacon...while the meatloaf could actually be a little bit more meaty, combined with the gravy and all the other toppings...you barely notice it! Really dang good. - The Popeye with no cheese, the spinach and chicken together create an oral symphony! - Tonkatsu - Grilled chicken, grilled onions, tonkatsu sauce, and romaine sans the mozarella cheese is really good but the tonkatsu sauce is a little on the saly side! - They also have this hot food platter area, where you get the Spicy Marvin's and the Thanksgiving Special, and they had this beautiful looking skirt steak with scallions. I got that on a sandwich and although it was 10.45...it was DIVINE! I didn't need extra sauces or anything...freakin amazing! - I've also had their pizza which is also very good...I think I tried the sicilian and veggie slice...Veggie slice was much better!!!",1,1,1
135,Chris P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",60,138,0,4.0,3/3/2010,"This spot is legit. You can get everything from a fresh deli sammer to homemade meatloaf.

140,Lauren B.,"Brooklyn, NY",2,7,0,4.0,12/9/2010,"No one has written nearly enough about their soup selection. Their vegetable soup is delicious. I love it so much, in fact, that I call about once a day to ask them their soup selections so I don't have to walk all the way there in order to find out what's on their menu. (I'm lazy! It's cold!) Anyway, I just tried their lentil soup yesterday and it was delicious, as well. Their soups win. But their sandwiches are great, too. Chicken caesar salad wrap. MMMM.The only downside to Toasties, in my humble opinion, is the whiny people waiting for their sandwiches. If you really think about it, there are tons of people walking in and giving sandwich orders and then ALL of those sandwiches have to be made in the same amount of time for everyone to get their sandwiches right away.Not possible, people.

Updated review","Finally ventured outside the office and visited Toasties. I can now attest that the place is very clean, spotless and very efficient! Line up according to sandwich, salad or market table - place your order - get a print out - then pay and wait for your # to be called. Quick and easy. And the place is pretty cool looking too. Big bonus - get the Toasties punch card. After 9 sandwiches - get one free! An even better reason to leave the office.",1,1,1
148,Michael H.,"New York, NY",36,33,0,5.0,7/8/2011,"When you're in midtown it seems like an very average lunch will cost every bit of a ten spot. While Toasties will cost you that and perhaps more, the difference is that it's worth every penny. I went yesterday for my first time and had the Thanksgiving sandwich. It rang every bell in the delicious sandwich department - seriously it was the best sandwich I've had in New York since a stop to Carl's Steaks about six months ago. Anyway, this sandwich had it all: Fresh turkey? Yep. Ho-made stuffing. Check. Canned cranberry sauces (Yes, but that's a good thing.) All topped off with a gravy that compliments the rest of the insides perfectly. Oh, it was on hero and that was fresh and tasty as well. Are you sensing a theme here? Good. So go. I'm going to go back as soon as I can.",,,
149,Gautam S.,"Manhattan, NY",512,15,0,5.0,8/1/2011,"This is the best toasties by far. Look no further for your go to lunch and light dinner place. the sandwiches are fantastic, the EZ and Smoked Jack are fantastic. Also, the salad guy at lunch time may just be the best salad chopper in the world. They have an unlimited amount of dressings and while the salad's can get quite pricey, they are worth and and can feed a hungry guy too. Great fruit as well.",,,
