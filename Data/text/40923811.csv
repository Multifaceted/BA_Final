1,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,324,577,4.0,9/13/2017,"Came in here completely by chance on a Saturday night and the vibe here was great!Bartenders are super friendly and attentive. It was not very crowded when we were there so it was a welcome change from having to fight through crowds to place an order. We stuck with beer and wine which were at your typical Manhattan rates, but tax is included so what you see is what you pay. Good music and a chill crowd as well. I would come back here for a drink.",1,,1
2,Lamin S.,"Lexington, KY",264,75,49,4.0,1/20/2018,"Great ambience for a bar, nice young professional crowd stopping in for an after work drink. I was attending for a private event which was in a separate, back room. A great space with a bar, intimate though spaced enough to not be on the top of each other. Drinks were good, strong, well made and the bartenders where attentive and friendly.",,,
3,Zoei D.,"Los Angeles, CA",6,21,0,5.0,1/26/2018,Great little place for after work drinks with friends. They have a room in the black with another bar i was there for a private event and it was really great. Friendly and fast service,1,1,1
4,John D.,"Jericho, NY",111,3,0,4.0,3/4/2018,Nice little bar in Chelsea with a good atmosphere and great customer service. Beers were about $5-6 and the mixed drinks were perfectly made. The bartender gave my friend and I a free shot early on and definitely earned his tip. Could've turned the AC up a bit on a hot day but still a nice place to hang out.,,,
5,Sarah G.,"Madison, NJ",70,15,4,2.0,2/1/2017,"OOF.  Service was great, thus 2 stars. I get it.  I'm in a great neighborhood.   I lived in the city for nearly 20 years.  I've worked in the city longer than that.  But I also own a bar and know what things cost and how to treat customers.I spontaneously took about 45 colleagues to Black Door last Friday.  Typically I would never show up anywhere with that many people and not give the bar a heads up, but at 4:15 on a Friday I knew this would be great business before it got ""Friday Night"" busy.  We were there for a little over two hours and the bartenders were on point.  The first was alone for about an hour so total props to her - wish I had gotten her name.  When the second bartender showed up she was totally capable but not very friendly.  BUT....  Well drinks are $9 and brand names are $10?  $9 for a fireball shot?  No Happy Hour pricing and zero buy backs?  Maybe this review is more about me being a sucker but 2 1/2 hours later I left with a bill for $2,500.  Again, OOF.",5,2,
6,Karen S.,"New York, NY",461,423,851,4.0,4/1/2016,"I am a creature of habit.  I have immutable routines. If I go to Sid Gold's and still haven't had enough, or if I just miss my bus, I hit Black Door. The problem is that bartenders like me and give me free shots. The last time that happened, I woke up at 10am in Harlem with balloons.By the time I get here (after Sid's closes @ 1am), the vibe is strictly Hip Hop. Not normally my scene, but there's such a mix of people it doesn't matter: Lonely Businessmen tying to get the hottest chick back to the Hotel Motel Holiday Inn. Some guys to give the Urban soundtrack some authenticity, and just one old dude playing way out of his league. But he's harmless and if you work it, he'll just buy you drinks all night.  No harm, no foul. The ambiance is dark wood and dimly lit. Flattering to all. There are hooks along the bar for your belongings. I've stressed before how that should be a frickin' given at any bar but sadly isn't. At this time of night the service is prompt and attentive. Almost every time I get home I have no recollection if I paid my tab or tipped correctly. But I guess I do because the bartenders still treat me right. Cheers!",9,13,6

12,Jessica R.,"New York, NY",1,1,0,5.0,11/3/2017,"They have a few great staff members but Alyssa and Jessica behind the bar are two of the most ""on point"" you'll find on this side of town. The bar is always chill- even when it's packed. Dimly lit, so there's always a make out session in a corner but it's easy to ignore. The music may be loud but it's always good. Old school hip hop and r&b and a mix of old and new pop classics. Great drink pours and ""hustle"" type service.",,,
13,Sandra P.,"Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, NY",2,1,0,5.0,4/13/2017,"This has been my go-to spot for three years. The bartenders are always super attentive and ready to fill up when you're empty. The prices are cheap, especially for Chelsea. I also noticed that their well liquors are Jamison and Bombay, good luck finding that somewhere else for less than $10.",,,
14,Augie R.,"Chicago, IL",167,829,135,1.0,11/26/2014,"Here is how fair I tried to be to the Black Door:  I was there two weeks ago and had a terrible experience, but I returned a second time to give it another chance.  That was a mistake.The first time I visited, I ordered a Manhattan and it was simply terrible. I have no idea what was wrong with it--it's such a basic drink to make, I can't recall a time I've had even a mediocre one, much less a bad one. Maybe the bartender used dry vermouth rather than sweet?  My friend ordered an Old Fashioned, and it was so terrible he left with his drink only half consumed. I don't like giving one-star ratings, so I wanted to give this place a second chance. I returned last night with a different friend. Again I ordered a Manhattan, and again it was simply awful. It tasted nothing like any Manhattan I've ever had. I should have returned it, but I choked it down and vowed never to return.  As for my friend, she tried to order wine, but it was so poor she returned it. As if remarkably poor drinks were not bad enough for a bar, on both visits I found the staff rather rude. The server on the first visit acted like she was doing us a favor to take a drink order and she knew nothing about the liquors stocked at the bar. On the second visit, my friend asked for a drink menu and the bartender acted like that was a ridiculous request and waved at the mirrors on the backbar where some wines and liquors were listed (but almost impossible to read.)  As for ambiance, the place does have a very nice and comfortable decor, but it is ruined by two things. First, on both visits, the room was ridiculously warm.  (I really don't expect  to sweat while sitting quietly in a bar on a November evening.) Second, what is with the stupidly loud music?  Is there anyone in the world who wants to try to scream a conversation over ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" played at 100db?Based on my two visits, the Black Door really, really earned this one-star rating.",5,,

21,Jim B.,"Somerset, NJ",347,1506,175,3.0,3/12/2014,"Walked in, saw no beer available on tap, little odd these days but this is a small bar; so I went with an Old Fashioned cocktail.  Nicely done and affordable at $9.00.  Bartender was personable, knows how to have a casual conversation with a new customer.  Some free bar snacks.  Place is too nice to be called a dive bar, but add some garish lighting and put in a couple of video games and it could make the transition.  As it is the lighting is subdued (?) or just a bit too dim. Neighborhood place. Nobody else needs to know.This particular bar has been there for 12 years but the building is quite old - older than me for sure.",2,1,
22,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,4.0,1/8/2014,"Not sure when this place popped up, but I'm glad it's there. It has the feel of a neighborhood pub, with a slightly more convivial atmosphere. It feels right for an after-work drink with a small group of coworkers/friends, and more than appropriate for a casual date (there appeared to be several in progress on a Monday night).I didn't get to spend too much time in the main bar room--we were visiting the private pre-New Year's party in the back. Speaking of the back room, what a cool place to host events! There's a bar back there and plenty of space for your friends to spread out and water themselves with booze.The beer options were quite decent--there was Sweet Action, Rogue Dead Guy (a nice, mellow maibock), Lagunitas, and more. Not sure about food options, but it's a keeper for the neighborhood, which could use more hangout bars.",2,1,2

The atmosphere is lively and welcoming... unless the man we had tonight, Wednesday April 1st is your bartender. I walked into the bar with my friend after we got off work nearby (we work in the industry, chef & bartender here) I order a Bulleit Old Fashioned & quite frankly I'm excited to get a nice cocktail after my crazy shift at work. He makes it and hands it to me, we pay. The gentleman sitting directly next to us ask us the bartender what the drink he just made me was and his answer, while standing right in front of me was ""A huge pain in my ass"". Let that sink in.Really? A simple Old Fashioned is a huge pain in his ass? He didn't even have to get a shaker out and why am I even justifying this? I bought a top shelf bourbon cocktail. The man next to me was almost interested in dropping his cash for it too until the bartender shut it down by saying it was a huge pain. He could have really increased his sales tonight but instead we are leaving now looking for another bar where we are welcomed and not a pain in anyone's rear end for ordering a Jack and Coke with a shot on the side  and an Old Fashioned. We just dropped 40 bucks to want to bail and never come back, and we almost we're going to stay here the whole night until he made that absurdly rude comment right in front of our faces. Please hire staff that WANT to serve your guests!!!Shaking our heads as we walk out the door & not look back, then telling all our co-workers to forget this place as well.",7,,

It's got a great feel with its low lighting, dark wood bar and tables, and super cute tile floor. The seating isn't limitless so get here early or be ready to stand. The bartenders are fine...not remarkably kind, but nice enough and can pour a good drink. This is my first stop when I stay in Chelsea (mostly due to the fact that it's next door to my hotel) and never disappoints.

Overall, nothing really special about this place...",,,
33,Luke T.,"Tucker, GA",461,649,867,4.0,6/6/2012,"The concierge at the Hilton across the street recommended this place, primarily because I wanted a bar in the vicinity and the Black Door is right across the street. SO, if you are piss drunk and need a place to stay.. there is always the Hilton across the street.Hmm.. after reading the other reviews, it must have been an off nite. There was less than 10 people in the bar. Very quiet, somber, all black decor, black bar, black walls, black board...very somber.. very vampire like. servers in black t-shirt.. very goth..Service is so-so. We grabbed a table in the back and nobody came to serve us in 10-15 minutes. In a situation like this, I normally leave. But I sense they want me and my business partner to leave. Partly because we are in suits and talking business...  So I decided to upset the establishment by moving to the bar and refuse to leave. In the end, I got served, even bummed a cig from the bartender. Bartender is nice, the uptight dude in black t-shirt server is not so nice.. If I were back in NYC again and in this Hilton across the street, I will bring me and 12 other executives to crash this fratty bar again, take over the bar.. just cos I can.. just cos the want me out.. muaaa ahahahaaaaaaaaaa",,,

This place is packed with college students or maybe they were just dudes with backpacks pretending to be students. Is there a discount for students? I think there are better places for happy hour deals. Show me the discounts!Note: you need to order a 2 drink minimum to use your credit card which is a bummer if you're like me and don't want to buy two drinks due to alcohol allergies. Seriously. So I gave the bartender my card and thought of strategies while I sipped my wine. Out of desperation, I asked my boss' boss to lend me some cash so I could pay cash instead. Wine will make you do crazy, stupid things! But it was all good. Paid back my debt and the bartender was apologetic.",,1,

41,Dishan W.,"Brampton, Canada",258,502,379,2.0,8/7/2011,"The only reason we came in here was because our hotel was on this street. By the time we walked in here around 11pm, it was already pretty packed and seating was hard to come by but we managed to score a table by the wall for ourselves which was already pretty wet and sticky in places. The crowds made it a little difficult to order drinks as a lot of the girls were obviously served first and like someone here mentioned already, there were quite a few single (or girl only groups). I guess some of you guys would find that a draw, but most of the girls we saw were slobbering drunk, loud and even a little rowdy with some crying going along if I remember right and dancing ensued as the night went on by the aforementioned girls.. I think I would prefer to come here when it's a little quieter for a drink but it is a very basic set up with a long bar and very little space to seat yourself. Drinks are not too pricey so that's a plus and they seemed to have a well stocked up bar.If you're in the area (aka hotel on street) and want to just step out for drinks this is a reasonable option, but other than that not a place I would want to re-visit.",,,1

For the reasons mentioned above, it's convenient, full of friends and serves alcohol - it wins in my book.Unless something really terrible happens, I will continue to frequent this place and continue to be pleased with my experience.And note on that back bar - I would love to have a private party in it!

45,Jia J.,"New York, NY",316,470,422,4.0,12/13/2012,"Adding life to a windswept block with not very much else to offer to the people, Black Door is apparently the reverse mullet of pubs; party in the front and business in the back. Except in this case, ""business"" meant a function in which alums from about twenty different classes from my high school took over the shockingly nice, collegiate back room to go hog wild in a classic environment that offered a full bar and bowls of blue gummy sharks with white bellies (you know the ones).Drinks were about $14...if you were drinking scotch and sodas all night as I was, whilst admiring the fine wooden floors and tall windows that somehow never inspired my curiosity of what was outside. As the room filled up, people hung up jackets up on jackets hanging on a sort of island shaped coathanger and fanned out across the L-shaped space with limited seating at high tables with high chairs to match.The back room had its own huge, clean, handicap-accessible bathrooms, but those not knowing this happily endured short, fast-moving lines for two smaller, moodlit, but not-that-much-dirtier unisex facilities in the hallway connecting the two segments of the business.Whenever I peeked down the hall, I saw the front room filling up as well, with professionals in their late 20s and late 30s, having a ball over some grow up drinks and the requisite loud convo. At some point in the night, people started getting rowdier, dropping their new iPhone 5s shouting ""it's so thin and light!"" and talking shit within hearing distance from high school era nemeses and doubling up on pizza slices from the comical stacks of pies that the event coordinator had ordered to the room during the madness. People from the front room started figuring out what was going on, and a couple infiltrated the room, hitting on girls who weren't having it anyhow. Party crashers were definitely overshadowed by the awarding of a football jersey signed by an unnamed NFL member, presented by another unnamed team member who happened to have gone to school with all of us back when we were all unformed punks. It was awarded to a kind of anti-hero type of dude (from an area with a rival NFL team, if he even cared to follow sports), who handed it off to an even more counterculture fellow who put in on (fit like an American Apparel dress - one of the loose ones) and stalked out of the room to continue his adventures elsewhere.With things getting hazy, I managed to leave two huge bags full of heavy framed awards I'd constructed for a swim team banquet that weekend. I had left them right on an open bookshelf oddly placed near the kitchen before I realized there was an annex where the alum event would be.So early the next evening, I returned to the venue. There was no more sign that a back room existed, but the front room was just opening up to early drinkers. In the dark but clean atmosphere, members of the staff were busily throwing up Halloween decorations all around. Apologetically, I walked up to a guy with arms full of fake cobwebs and asked if he's seen. His face lit up, and he hopped to the back and emerged with my bags. I told him I had to take care of some other business next door first, and asked if I could leave the stuff there for maybe 20 more minutes. ""Sure!"" he said, and I walked off confident that my stuff would be intact when I came back. And it was.The front bar is a three-star experience, just your regular bar with an honest staff and a variable after-work crowd that kind of morphs with the passing of the hours and the drinking of drinks. The back room is a serious contender as a venue for a work party or some sort of nice networking event, and my impression is that you only need to hit $1,000 drink limit for the bar, which is easy if you round up a few New Yorkers who want to get liquored, and then charge them $14 for drinks that are actually worth the price (if that price were humane to begin with). The Black Door back room provides space for lighthearted debauchery in a debonair setting. Gotta love it.",1,1,

There was a bouncer there too. Danielle S. and I tried to scope it out but we were stopped by said bouncer.

I don't think there is tap- if there is, I completely missed it.- $10 for a glass of red wine seems kind of high for me. Hmm...-It doesn't seem like there is a credit card minimum. I was able to charge my glass of wine on my card with no problem. - Get ready to talk really loud the whole time that you are there because a.) they play rock music on blast and b.) the acoustics in this place make it so that everything sounds extra loud with people talking plus the rock music I can't imagine that I will be rushing to come back here but if what I have described above is your kind of thing, go right ahead...but don't try to tell me that I didn't warn you.",9,3,4

If you've been to the bar, you've seen me, and likely know me. Hi again. The mix at this laid-back Chelsea standard is extremely eclectic, and changes demographic every hour or two. This makes for a lively crowd that anyone can feel at ease in. The lighting is very dim and flattering- making after work and late night stop-ins more comfortable if you're feeling a bit disheveled.The bartenders are outgoing and friendly, and remember familiar faces well. Drinks are very well priced for Chelsea. There is a good selection of bottled beers (nothing on tap) and the wine selection is small but well chosen. The bartenders are all seasoned mixologists, and cocktails are the bread and butter here. There is a very good variety of call and top shelf liquors, so you are guaranteed to find your favorite brand.Music is provided via playlist and varies according to bartender, but is generally a good and crowd-friendly mixture of rock, hip hop and classics. A large party room is available to be booked for events, and can accommodate a dj. Fridays and Saturdays between 11pm and 1:30 am can be very packed, so go late like the regulars do if you are in the mood for a calmer environment. Mondays, Tuesdays and Sundays are my favorites, as well as any night past 1am.

The ages and gender vary pretty widely as well.It's a good place to come if you're in the area, but not somewhere you'd go out of your way to visit.They have a very large collection of liquors displayed on the shelf (my friend told me they have some expensive rare stuff as well, though I wouldn't have known it).",,,

It is pretty loud and the crowd is a mixture of 20 something working group and random hipsters. Overall it's a great neighborhood place that's not too far from a few other good bars so it's worth a try.  I would recommend this for someone who wants a bar scene but with good music.

Jamey - the guy I've worked with for events is super easy to work with and really nice. The bar minimum is reasonable, so it isn't hard to meet and murder in an evening. They don't double book events, which is just the biggest headache known to man, so perk. 2 private bathrooms in the back area too, so the party doesn't have to share with the main bar. I went to a large birthday party here in like 2005 and promptly forgot it existed. Then I was doing a site visit in the area for another venue and walked past the awning and remembered feeling like I was in a mirrored ballroom, kinda like that scene in the move 'Labyrinth.' So I ended up booking a holiday party here for an organization I did events for and it. was. off. the honk. It was a 4 hour open bar so people might have gotten a tad, uhhhm, happy? We *might* have had 175 people throughout the night, but not at one time. The bartenders worked with me on a drink special, we ran our own iPod (because we're cheap and awesome like that), and brought in a ton of decorations. Santa and his slutty Ms. Claus got down on the dance floor too. It was a memorable night. So, I of course booked another organization's event here, but a MUCH more tame event with local politicians and tastemakers. It was also a huge success with about 120 people attending. We had these twin model-type girls running coat check who got asked out about 15 different ways (poor girls, champs tho - good hires Black Door!). Both events we had a check-in table out front, used a microphone and had a lot of staff assistance with set-up and tear-down.

The female bartenders serve other girls (has anyone noticed that most girl bartenders will only serve guys!? i get the big tip thing but this lady needs a drink), 3. there's always just enough room for me to dance, 4. people are friendly, laid back and happy to chat.

It's a great little bar though, the prices are average for this part of the city (think 6 bucks a beer), and there's a back room with another bar (although it's usually closed or saved for private parties). And the bathrooms aren't completely disgusting, which is a nice change up.The bartenders are cool and usually are playing some great music (last time I was there, there was a heavy dose of Interpol going on which is right up my alley). It really depends on who's working though, as I remember one night I got a heavy dose of Britney Spears's Blackout album.It's usually a good crowd, but seldom, if ever, overcrowded.

Still, it was a low key place and not too obnoxious in general.

Do you like drinking in a small, dimly-lit room? Hopefully you like all of the above, because if you don't, you probably won't get along with Black Door too well. It's a very different bar because there is no TV. There is no light besides candles. The room is spacey minus several high-top tables and stools and the bar. The music is loud but at least not annoying. I strongly recommend coming here with a friend or significant other. You can grab a drink or two and stand closely to each other in order to hear each other. Don't bring someone you just met or aren't close with; you will end up yelling at each other when you're talking, keeping a reasonable distance between you. Don't bring more than two people here; you will no be able to keep a group conversation going. The beer selection is nice but it is all in bottles, which is strange to me. $6 a bottle.

The bartenders do a pretty good job of getting drinks out to people even when its crowded. I would almost describe this place as your standard NYC bar as it kinda falls in a lot of different classifications but doesnt really fit one particular description. It is close to a couple other places but a little out of the way. Its usually pretty low maintenance to get in which is nice and I've always had fun there.,,,1

146,Right R.,"New York, NY",2,39,0,3.0,7/3/2006,"my office is a block away, and this is the best bar within a short walk. not pretentious, reasonable prices, and decent crowd. i wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but one of the better options in the hood. they pour a good martini, which absolutely devastated me one evening when i had three too many.",2,,1
147,Erin M.,"New York, NY",2,19,23,5.0,10/11/2009,"I love this bar! It has fun music, great bartenders and usually a cool crowd.",,,
148,Marcus B.,"New York, NY",100,20,1,2.0,5/1/2009,"NO draft beer!  Besides that OK bar, like everyone else said very laid back.  The crowd seems to be a mix of ""hipsters"" and late 20s working professionals.  Its a decent place to take a girl for a couple drinks if you live in the neighborhood.  Not bad, but been to better, it is what it is.",,,
149,Jonathan P.,"Charlotte, NC",14,106,4,3.0,11/4/2008,"I went here with my friend Eric, who lives and works in Manhattan, so i figured he would have a good idea of what bars to go to.  He did.  I liked how dark and relatively small black door is.  With the menu scrawled on the mirror behind the bar and shiny rich wood grain beneath my elbows, I dug the vibe and especially the music.  The first song I noticed as we ordered our initial brew was a little diddy by Nirvana called ""Lithium"", and since this was the jam Eric and I used to rock out to as young pre-teens in Charlotte, I felt it was apropo that it was playing for this random meet up in New York City. The next track was Silverchair keeping with the early 90's grunge rock theme. Black Door is a  pretty chill place, with a  laid back vibe...but still clean and classy.  It seemed to attract a pretty cool crowd, too, cute girls and rich dudes buying lines of Patrone shots.  If you're ever in the area, pop in and grab a cold brew they're not  cheap, but nothing in New York is.",,,
150,Michael W.,"New York, NY",4,108,0,4.0,9/30/2010,"good spot for a couple drinks, reasonable price, service sucks, as waitress never came by, but otherwise a good bar.",,,
151,erin l.,"New York, NY",6,13,0,5.0,12/21/2008,nice place. nice vibe.  really classy feel.  easy to get to and big enough for a  group of friends to meet up at.  i'll be back to visit again.,1,,2
