0,Kaitlyn C.,"Ardsley, NY",197,25,4,4.0,6/4/2018,"This deli is a great lunch spot in FiDi. They're very quick, you're in and out in just a few minutes and it's not a very crowded space at all. They really pack on the meat and toppings for you for a good price. I enjoyed a roast beef sandwich (including a pickle!) for $7.95 which is the deli standard, however, I didn't realize how much meat I would get for that amount! I was very please and full from my lunch. They rebuilt this place a few years back after Hurricane Sandy and the inside has plenty of seating.Along with sandwiches they have salads, soups and hot dishes that you can pick up anytime. They deliver too which could be convenient if you can't (or don't want to!) leave your desk or bed.",,,

3,Ayanna B.,"Montclair, NJ",359,242,87,4.0,10/5/2018,"When I say this is the best salad I've had delivered, I mean the BEST! I order the small extravaganza salad. Switch out the toppings, dressing on the site, pretty good price at $7.95! But then I add the grilled salmon. I had it once in a sandwich and nearly died from the flavor. I wish it could last forever. I kept making yummy sounds. My office mates thought I was either exaggerating or maybe they should steal my lunch. The next week we all got grilled salmon on our salads. We all made yummy sounds. The greens are crisp and fresh. The pressed juices are phenomenal. The price is okayyyyy. Don't get salad dressing in, they put too much. But order from there, because the salad is ridiculously delicious.",,,

5,Maggie C.,"Kansas City, MO",692,477,536,3.0,12/17/2017,"Got delivery from here at nearly midnight, ordering the chicken gyro platter. They calls us 5 minutes later to tell us they were out of rice, and that they could substitute fries for no charge.Delivery came 30 minutes later, food still piping hot. Gyro platter came with lettuce, tomato, red onion, very thin grilled chicken, cut up pita slices... and my fries. The chicken was not seasoned, and it was extremely dry. Pita was soft, and the cucumber sauce included was well made and delicious. Overall, fairly decent for a 10$ meal that came to the door within 30 minutes.PS, they have so many wraps to choose from. I was overwhelmed.",2,,

7,Tonya W.,"Oakdale, Savannah, GA",0,10,38,4.0,7/28/2018,I've gotta say I was impressed the two times we ordered while visiting last week from. This was definitely a great late night restaurant.

8,Michael M.,"Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, NY",75,21,0,1.0,9/11/2018,"I came in yesterday for eggs with cheese, onion and avocado and it was 6.50.  Way overpriced but I paid and left. Came in today and left off onion to save money and it was 7.00. When I asked why they said yesterday mistake.  Needless to say I didn't pay that criminal price. Went one block and found same for 5.75.",,,
9,Sylenya P.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,16,24,4.0,4/15/2018,"A favorite of mineI work overnight in the area so there are not too many spots open for food, drinks or snacks besides this one. I can not say this is The Best of New York Food but the food is pretty darn good. I have ordered a sandwich called the Skoof on more than one occasion because I like peppers and onions plus the addition of a spicy sauce is great. I've also ordered breakfast sandwiches here as well and have had no problems with their food. I am really in love with this place because they have instant Ginger Tea. The place is never crowded but then I only visit here after 11pm which is probably different from 9/10 am. Food is worth a try.",1,2,2
10,Mark C.,"Silver Spring, MD",80,259,425,4.0,5/12/2017,"This is a 3.5 star review..This place opens 24/7.First off, it's tough to have restaurants that are open  late in the evening. I stayed at a hotel nearby and needed to have a late meal. This place was a few blocks away from me so I decided to give it a try.When you walk inside, you will see a display of fruits (bananas, apples) in front of the store. Walking inside further, you will as a cashier, grill and assortment of grocery like items. They were serving soup even late into the evening. Kudos to them for having soup available. We had the chicken noodle soup, Phillips cheesesteak, fries and veggie omelette. The chicken noodle soup is a late night food that will satisfy your needs and hunger. The Philly cheesesteak is okay (lack of seasoning) but their fries are hot and crispy. Definitely loved the fries. Their veggie omelette is a thumbs down for me. It was very bland that lacked seasoning such as salt and better.Also, their prices were a bit high. Just make sure you avoid their omelettes. They also sell various drinks here to satisfy your thirst. The staff here are very nice which is surprising as they work through the long late night hours. At the time, they only had 1 staff working the grill area and another staff working at cashier. So it was a 2 person work environment.Overall, this place is good for late night eating. You will see tons of working professionals coming here late at night after getting off work. Their chicken noodle soup and their crispy fries are one of the reasons why I will come back. One thing I would work on is seasoning your food. At times, we needed to put salt and pepper to our food as there was no flavor in their omelettes and sandwiches.",,,
11,Maur M.,"New York, NY",0,5,12,5.0,9/7/2018,This deli is amazing.  Authentic NYer coffee that you must try at least once.  I absolutely was addicted to it.  Nice egg sandwiches too.,,,
12,Valerie V.,"Raleigh, NC",208,237,556,4.0,9/15/2017,"I opted for a Stu- grilled chicken, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, honey mustard, in a whole wheat wrap. It was lighter and perfect and fresh tasting.  Grilled chicken was warm and tasted freshly grilled (not like refrigerated grilled chicken that was warmed). I was actually dying to try their Reuben sandwich because that sandwich is one of my favorites (and where better to get that than a NY Deli?) but I was not in the mood for something heavy - you have to be in the mood for that guy. Anyway- this wrap was exactly what I wanted for a quick lunch in the area and I would definitely go back to try other menu items!  I also loved that there was a market in there with fruit and a salad station.",,,
13,Joe M.,"Beacon, NY",11,72,50,5.0,3/14/2017,"I chose this restaurant for one reason only - during Nor'easter Stella it was the closest one that was open and took orders through Seamless. The most stalwart of my employees braved the elements and the firm rightly deemed they be rewarded. Why five stars for takeout?  The order was 100% correct.  The food arrived hot and it all not only tasted great but it looked good too. What did we get?  Philly Cheesesteaks, Burgers with and without bacon, Chicken Club and Chicken Cordon-bleu sandwiches. All with mounds of regular and Curley fries.  I would definitely go there again. The menu is ginormous and it looks like they have breakfast all day. If you're in the FiDi with a group and no one can decide on one type of food, The Best of NY Food is your answer.  Greek, Italian, Spanish, Jewish & Italian Deli and everything in between is represented here.",,,
14,Katherine J.,"New City, NY",0,37,5,5.0,8/9/2018,"Great food and the best hash browns.  Always hot and crispy! The food is always fresh.  They have sandwiches, hot food and a salad bar.",,,

Updated review","This is an update to my original review.  Today I ordered a soup and salad for lunch.  The chicken soup was full of chicken and noodles; it was incredibly delicious.The salad was very good, just lacked enough lettuce.  The serving portions of the other vegetables were all sufficient.  The order was delivered in a very timely manner.  I will not hesitate to order from here again.",,,
16,Desi A.,"Tampa, FL",7,14,364,3.0,6/1/2017,"Stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning. They were around 30 minutes past (start of breakfast?), so I figured we'd be ok. It was our first time there, so we were talking a checking out the breakfast menu above the grill. The cook asked us what we wanted, and I explained we needed a few as we had never been there before.I kid you not, no more than 60 seconds  later he asked us what we wanted again.  We were the only ones in the store, so it wasn't like we were holding up any line. My kid and I both settled on whatever we happened to be looking at when he asked what we wanted a second time. I ordered the Italian omelette with home fries, and a side of turkey sausage. My kid ordered a cheese omelet and when we asked for hash browns  the guy looked like he wanted to lose it. He reached around the counter, grabbed two hash browns from the fridge in a hurry and threw them on the griddle. Exxxxcuuuuse me for walking in and ordering breakfast... during regular breakfast hours. The breakfast was good, but the sausages were slit open like they rushed he cooking to get us out of there.  The sausage definitely didn't look like some of the pix I've seen that were part of what lured me in. In the end we spent $25 on breakfast and were full. The customer experience leaves a little to be desired, but I imagine that it's not too much of a problem if you arrive knowing what you want ahead of time - and not on a Sunday within 45 minutes of 7:30AM. I would of gave them 4 stars if it weren't for the fussy cook.  Would go back again - but only with a game plan.",,,
17,Mick O.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,2,3,2.0,1/9/2018,"So up until today we have been regular customers at Best of NY because the quality and portions are great. We come from the UK and aren't really used to the massive potions that are served here! This morning the hot food turned up cold and the rice pudding looked like they had enough for one portion and they stretched it to the four that we asked for. Why bother??Always tip well, always polite!It's always the little things that get you in the end - time to find a new diner!",,,
18,Renee L.,"Bronx, NY",0,1,0,1.0,10/4/2018,"Came in today to stop for breakfast before work. Going off the menus displayed ,I had an omelette with 1 meat cheese (which is and additional $.50 and 3 veggies as menu reads. No sides. No toast. No potatoes. The man rings me up for $6.50 I ask why? He says. ""Oh come on I didn't even charge you for cheese! Nor of our omelets come with meat. If you want meat it's 1.00 more"" then shows me the sign that says for extra meat 1.00. I told him i did not get extra meat I only order what was to be I included. The other options all have meat in the omelettes ,if order those you would charge me $1.50 more?  And if he didn't charge me for the cheese where the $.50 come from?I paid and stayed to eat. The omelette was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately the fact that I was over charged for their benefit is unfair. I know it's a $1.50 bug this is a busy area so if their doing it to me they are doing it to everyone! PAY ATTENTION!",,,
19,Brandon E.,"Atlantic Highlands, NJ",301,494,192,4.0,11/21/2016,"Is this the best of New York food? Nope, but it is quick, tasty and pretty cheap. I've been a few times and haven't been disappointed. It seems most of the negative reviews are for delivery, this is a block from my office so I just pick up.I haven't had breakfast but just hoagies. They have all be good, the chipotle chicken is delicious as well as the buffalo chicken. The hot roast beef Mo Mello needed some kinda sauce it was a bit dry, but still not bad. They have a bunch of options and for $8.95 for most hoagies and $7.95 for a sandwich it's a pretty good deal. They also have a salad station.I would suggest not getting a drink here, they're a bit overpriced. Overall, friendly, quick and tasty. This is fast becoming my regular lunch spot.",1,,1

22,Regina R.,"Manhattan, NY",299,43,62,4.0,9/13/2016,"I only heard of this place through the Boar's Head app. They were offering 50% off deli cuts sandwiches at participating delis and this place was one of them. It's a really good price considering I paid only $3.29. I can't say anything about their other items, but the sandwiches they've made me are stuffed to perfection. I usually write in the notes to add lettuce and pickles and they do it with no extra charge. I've tried their pastrami, roast beef, and corned beef. I'd rather come here everyday than pay $20 at Katz Deli for just one sandwich. I mean, of course the quality of the meat is different, but you can't complain at the price!I would come back and try ordering something else if it was a little closer to my office. I'll definitely update my review once I do!",2,,
23,Elton W.,"New York, NY",1009,377,1497,3.0,5/24/2016,"One of your basic New York Deli's, but probably the best one within a few block radius of Water Street in the Financial District.I come here for breakfast fairly often as they have very good small Turkey Sausage Links that are very tasty.  Also prefer this deli to it's nearby competitor (Water Street Cafe, for which my co-workers and I nickname ""the dirty water"" ) as it's much much cleaner, not nearly as crowded and they take their time to make your order.  When you go to other deli's, they rush your order and many times, get my order wrong.They have lots of seating, reasonable prices and like I mentioned, Very Clean, which is important as many NYC Deli's can be undeniably dirty and not sanitary.But, keep in mind, this is a Basic NY Deli, so don't expect much.  But for inexpensive, fast & casual breakfast and sandwiches, this is a very good option in the area.",24,11,17

25,Esther K.,"New York, NY",203,365,81,1.0,5/2/2018,"DOUBLE CHECK THE PRICES AND YOUR RECEIPT! I ordered 2 ham, egg, and cheese sandwiches on croissant and they tried to charge me $.50 extra on each sandwich. I asked them why I was paying $7 for each sandwich and they said it's a $1 extra for after 11am and an additional $1 for the croissant. While I can understand paying extra for the croissant, I wish I knew about the $1 extra for breakfast after 11am. I didn't know of this after 11am charge nor did the guy tell me prior to taking my order but its on their paper menus which are tucked away by the register. Either way, when I saw the price for a ham, egg, and cheese sandwich on the menu, it was $4.50. I'm not a math genius but I can add 4.50 + 1 + 1 is $6.50 not $7.00. I told him it should be 6.50 and not 7 dollars. He hesitated for a moment and I pointed to the price on the menu and did the math for him again. He finally gave me a dollar back.

Sandwiches usually are really filling and run around $7-$8. Salads come in two sizes, and the large is really satisfying for $7.95. The ingredients are pretty fresh as well with a good selection of toppings and dressings. I do find that if you get more than the allotted amount of toppings that the price varies day to day.

54,Christina R.,"Hastings-on-Hudson, NY",404,280,169,3.0,8/18/2011,"I wouldn't say it's ""the best"" of New York, however it does offer a large selection and is always open!There are very few places open in the FiDi before 6am. Best of New York is open all the time and it's probably one of the most of convenient places in the area. This place stocks random things...you will find cup of noodles next to Pringles chips and chocolate bars...lets not forget deodorant, razors, powerbars, desserts, salad bar, and sandwiches.  They have my favorite European soda Orangina readily available. The sandwiches have fun names for example ""the Jeter"". I've only tried one of their sandwiches, it's wasn't earth shattering... but decent, and their other options make up for it.  The prices are moderate, and they over charge for certain items such as Nantucket Nectars juices. However, the prices are ever changing. They accept plastic, but their is a $5 min. Their delivery is ""speedy"". Overall, a pretty good place to find ""stuff"" at random hours, but nothing special.",2,1,1

56,Hector M.,"Jersey City, NJ",537,513,2227,4.0,2/1/2011,"Everytime I walk into The Best of New York, I feel like reliving the scene from Elf (World's Best Cup of Coffee): youtube.com/watch?v=CUPD…If you can unhinge your jaw like a snake, then you can definitely handle one of their sandwiches.  Their sandwiches are jam packed with cold cuts or chicken cutlets.  The guys behind the counter are efficient and lines move quickly.  They also have a salad bar and buffet station which I haven't tried yet (I can't eat salad/soup for lunch and have not summoned the courage to dive into the buffet).",4,4,2
57,Bill B.,"Nutley, NJ",23,337,247,2.0,12/29/2013,Best of? Perhaps if this is the only place you have been to in the city and are visiting from the mid-west. The coffee was decent. I can't say much for anything else. An extra star for convenience.,,,
58,Candice S.,"New York, NY",1,4,0,1.0,10/7/2013,THE WORST OF NEW YORK!!!I had to call the police to get them to give me my money back! I ordered food from this place and I live right down the street.  The delivery guy lied and said he delivered the food to me but he never did.  The Manager was extremely rude and unprofessional. They would not give me my money back (I had paid with a credit card over the phone).  The delivery guy said he delivered it to someone who looks nothing like me.. The delivery guy and the manager only wanted to argue and they had no customer service skills.  I had to show up with the police to get a refund.  Please be careful if you order delivery from here.  After speaking to others in my building I found out that this seems to be a common practice for them.  I am not sure if they are running a scam and think people are too lazy to care that they did not get there food and they keep customers money or what.  But I have NEVER had such horrible delivery experience.  Beware!!,,1,
59,Benjamin K.,"New York, NY",130,24,1,4.0,3/7/2014,"The place you love to hate, but order at 3am every time anyway. Try the grilled cheese, Mr Mellow sandwich, and curly fries (the regular fries are lame).",,,
60,Gene P.,"Brooklyn, NY",144,46,6,2.0,10/30/2011,"Pros: open 24 hours, large menu, delivery via Seamless.comCons: overpriced ($4 for a tiny grapefruit), food is mediocre at best (had a broccoli omelette - it sucked)I go here a lot because it so close to my apt, but unless nothing else is open, go somewhere else.",,,
61,Jenna B.,"Los Angeles, CA",107,32,0,4.0,8/17/2010,I just ordered from them and am very happy with the food- I had french fries and a grilled cheese sandwich as well as pancakes :) haha It was so good and it was my first time eating from there.I had the food delivered and it was very prompt and quick service- the fries are amazing and the delivery guy was even nice and respectful- two thumbs up!!xoxo Jenna,3,,1
62,Jimmy R.,"New York, NY",26,98,65,4.0,7/5/2014,"alway orders some wraps from this place .... try the buffalo bob that shit is good ! they deliveries are good , sometimes they send me the wrong wrap but its ok because they are all good...... hot and spicy biaatch",1,,5
63,Steven A.,"Baltimore, MD",0,3,0,1.0,6/5/2015,DO NOT BOTHER..  We Ordered two burgers and wings.  We called about 45 minutes after we placed the order for them to tell us they had no wings.  They agreed to sub the wings for an additional burger. When the food finally arrived (an hour+ later)  the burgers were made Completely wrong!  No condiments whatsoever and were completely dried out! . I called back for them to apologize and say they would bring  the condiments out.  An hour later i call back and the f****** guys had the nerve to get rude with me and say they werent coming back out for that!  (after he said he would without me asking) ...dont waste your money or time.... Complete DOGFOOD..  Sadly id rather go to McDonald's......,,,
64,Laura W.,"Carrboro, NC",94,223,5,4.0,1/19/2010,"3.5 stars. The service here, yes, is helpful. The guy behind the counter saw me staring up at the menu with what must have been a bewildered look, and kindly offered me a paper version, telling me there were more options listed there. I got a bagel with lox spread. The lox spread had big chunks of smoked salmon in it - YUM. The bagel itself wasn't quite what I was expecting from the much heralded ""New York bagel"" - I'm still loyal to Charlottesville's Bodo's - but the quality of the lox made up for that. 1.5 stars off for a few reasons: -Price goes up by 3 dollars on bagels, just because it's after 11am. Even so, my meal was still cheap (under $5 ). -Construction was going on in the store (I'm talking a guy sawing a 2x4 right in the middle of the refrigerated aisle). Seems unsafe to me.",2,,1
65,Eric G.,"Wanaque, NJ",13,11,0,5.0,3/3/2015,"Great lunch spot.  Delivery, pickup, or sit in are all great.   I generally order through seamless to beat the lines, but generally there is little to no line.",,,
66,Daniel B.,"Charlotte, NC",32,70,45,4.0,1/13/2010,"Kudos to the staff - hard to find good service in the middle of the night but these guys were spot on!  Financial District isn't known for having a lotta choices at 3am outside McDonalds, but this fills the bill quite nicely.  Great selection of REAL food and willing to make just about anything you want (within reason of course).  Felt like they could have had a better selection of snack foods & on-the-go items considering the size of the place, but overall the selection was pretty good.  Prices were good too.  They made me an awesome sandwich for under $4.  Can't beat that.  Took that along with some drinks & snacks back to my hotel & was happy as I could be!  I like staying in the Financial District, so next time I know where to go for breakfast - my mouth's watering just thinking about it.It's also a good alternative to places around the Seaport; close by but miss the crowds (plus it's local & not so damn commercial!).  :)",1,,
67,Victoria R.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",32,12,2,2.0,9/14/2011,Only reason I come in here is because it's located right around my job. Only place open that early btw. Decided I wanted a iced coffee and was literally given a cup full of ice with coffee. Yuck! I understand if I had to put my own milk/sugars but they filled it so high it had no space. The min. Use of a debit is $5. Sometimes I need to buy things I don't need which sucks! I go just because it's there really if not I wouldn't.,1,,
68,Dennis R.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,3.0,10/21/2012,A breathe of fresh air in a neighborhood overrun by corporate restaurants. Good breakfast sandwiches.  (Id give it 3.5 if I could.),,,
69,Alice M.,"London, United Kingdom",174,194,33,5.0,9/26/2008,"I think this place is special in comparison to all the surrounding overpriced restos and vendors (including the street fairs that often pop up along Fulton Street) and the Vitamin water is no more overpriced than the Europa Cafe across the street which charges nearly twice as much for a bottle than this place.With its unassuming exterior and interior decor, The Best of New York Food actually has delightfully fresh egg sandwiches with cheese & bacon for only $3!  Definitely bigger and better than any breakfast sandwiches Wendy's may offer, 2 blocks down, and faster too!Their egg sandwiches are melted right to perfection and hits the spot every time, a treat I look forward to in the mornings before work.Staff has always been friendly and generous with their niceties.Sometimes I leave thinking my name is really ""Sweetie""*I haven't really tried their hot lunch foods yet though, so for that I have no opinion.",3,3,2
70,M B.,"Baltimore, MD",0,28,0,5.0,6/18/2013,"Ordered for delivery at a hotel. I'm an athlete and look for healthy options most of the time and whenever I'm on travel it's near impossible to put together a good tasting meal that's what I'm looking for. At this place, I was able to get plain grilled chicken and steamed veggies and a big salad... the food tasted awesome, the portions were to however many oz's I wanted and everything tasted fresh. Saved my day! The delivery was really quick too!",1,,
71,Harmony I.,"Fort Denaud, FL",40,344,7,1.0,11/3/2011,"The best food? No way. Actually was one of the worst meals that I have ever had in my nearly 4 years in New York. Ordered delivery via Seamless web. My chicken cutlet club sandwich was horrid. The chicken was dry and tough, the bacon was fake bacon bits tasting bacon and the lettuce was wilted. The side of potato salad that I ordered? Simply mayo with hard, sliced potato. No seasoning, onions, celery, eggs, nothing....and the mayo was just horridly overpowering. The chocolate cheesecake that I spent extra money on arrived as regular chocolate cake....dry, dry, dry and fake ass, processed tasting chocolate. Just a bad, bad meal.",,,
72,Bob D.,"Cambridge, MA",0,10,0,5.0,5/25/2013,So glad that Best of New York is back open after having been closed in the aftermath of Sandy. Their breakfast is great - egg bacon and cheese on a roll for under $4 with great coffee and very nice staff. This is a great spot for locals to get good NY deli food at reasonable prices. Highly recommend Best of New York.,1,,
73,Abigail S.,"Miami, FL",270,378,51,3.0,12/29/2007,"Best of New York Food is nothing special, but their scallion cream cheese is made fresh and the bagels are pretty good.  The Vitamin Water is overpriced, but when you're still getting over the flu and can't leave the house to go get supplies yourself, the extra cost is worth it.Typical bagel joint in a desolate part of town.  Three stars.",1,,1
74,Reema S.,"Brooklyn, NY",35,42,3,5.0,6/12/2008,"I used to live right across the street from Best of New York and must give it 5 stars because let's face it - when you're a student sharing a studio apartment with 3 other people, you need a 24 hour joint nearby with strong coffee and good service. Nabil, who used to work the night-shift was a really nice guy, and always took care of me. Aside from the fact that Best of NY is convenient, its one of the only spots in lower Manhattan open 24 hours and serves yummy food (like egg and cheese bagels) at all hours of the day.",4,2,3
75,Andrea C.,"Los Angeles, CA",115,54,17,2.0,9/22/2008,Was everyone drunk when they came here?? This place was AWFUL. I only give it 2 stars because the delivery was fast and they packaged everything very well. I ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich and it was so cold and gross that I literally took 2 bites and was gagging. My boyfriend got a ceasar wrap and the chicken was tough and gross. The fries were undercooked and super soggy.,1,,1
76,Eric B.,"Dallas, TX",4,20,3,4.0,3/9/2008,"I godamn love this place for very neighborhood-specific reasons. Sure, it's your average New York lunchtime deli and the grill is pretty much always open. This isn't so much a big deal if you're the average Manhattanite. But look, if you live in the Financial District, it's hard enough to find any place that's open 24/7 (except for Charly's, or Gold st. which is still crap, unfortunately) so this place is perfect for the late night and early morning greasy spoon craving. Garaunteed to meet all of your expectations, but moreso when you're drunk.",1,,
77,Tim H.,"Austin, TX",5,10,0,4.0,1/3/2010,"Best of New York is certainly nothing special. I can't think of reason 1 why you would go out of your way to eat here. That said, it serves consistently good food, on the cheap. The staff are fantastic, and are always generous with portions. If you are in the neighborhood, definitely worth it. Sandwiches, hot tray, salads, name it. It all works.",1,,
