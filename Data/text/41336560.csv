0,Sarah X.,"New York, NY",51,101,260,5.0,11/19/2018,"I got the Brooklyn blackout cupcake, mini red velvet and a cheesecake slice here which were all amazing. The blackout cupcake seems to be their most popular, so I was excited that they still had some available when I got there. I was worried it would be way too sweet since there's icing both inside and outside, but the ratio was actually pretty on point. I really wanted to try the red velvet, but opted for the mini since I wanted to get many other items. Like the Brooklyn blackout, the red velvet tastes extremely fresh and moist. I don't think the minis have icing in them though, so I definitely want to try the full-size red velvet next time! The cheesecake was really delicious, but I wouldn't say it's the best I've tasted in NY. The crust tasted a little burnt, but this actually may be intentional for flavoring since it wasn't actually burnt. Still extremely delicious, but I think the cupcakes are really the hit item here.. or maybe worth it to try the cheesecake with strawberries? This definitely a stop in and go place. The line was almost out the door when I went around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon. People who were able to get a table were kind of squeezed because of so many people in line and it's a very small shop. Definitely worth checking out if in the area!",2,1,1

The peanut butter cupcake, which is quite generous in size, I planned to share with my bf but he never got a single bite! Once I dove in that decadence there was no stopping me! I'm not even a sweets person! This cupcake was sweet, tart, smooth, crunchy & sinful all in one bite. It really blew my mind. The next morning for breakfast I had the pumpkin pie. It was unlike any other I've ever had. It was velvety in texture, rich & lite all at the same damn time! Wait for it....croissant like crust! I kid you not. Moral of the story, this bakery is dangerous because once you have a bite of their sinful treats, you're never the same & you always come back forMore!",1,,2
2,JANUARY S.,"New York, NY",1,14,0,5.0,11/11/2018,"This was introduced to me by my ex's brother during one of our Sunday dinners past. I have been a fan since! Their red velvet is The Best I've ever had!  It's perfection really; the cake and icing ratio is def on point.Whenever my nieces visit, we make a beeline for Two Little Red Hens. We always buy extras for them to take home to PA. My sister always reminds us to save her a cupcake!I've only been disappointed once by this place but it's not a deal breaker. I wanted to bring in cupcakes for one of my good friends at work. Unfortunately, they don't start churning those magical cupcakes until 11am. Aside from that, this place is awesome! Also, the people are so friendly :)",,,
3,Gloria L.,"Philadelphia, PA",107,180,326,5.0,10/1/2018,"This place has some of the best cupcakes I've had before, especially since there's so much competition in NYC!  They are extremely busy, so whenever I go, I expect to stand in line for at least a little bit.  I went on a Sunday afternoon at around 3pm, and it was still super busy! But I understand why.  Their cupcakes are just delicious! My absolute favorite flavors are the Brooklyn Blackout and the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cupcake.  Their regular sized cupcakes are well-sized (pretty big) for $4 and they also have a mini-cupcake option.  The cupcakes are on the denser side and there is a lot of icing (even inside the cupcake), but it's not too much where the icing gets overbearing and too sweet. They also sell coffee, cakes, cookies, and cheesecake if you're looking for a different dessert!",3,,1
4,Victoria J.,"Philadelphia, PA",289,118,44,5.0,9/19/2018,"I am currently standing over my kitchen sink weeping into the box that once held a piece of cheesecake from this establishment. I'm overwhelmed with joy that I've just eaten at the best bakery I've ever been to IN MY LIFE. I'm a huge fan of red velvet cupcakes and I get them everywhere I go and man did this one blow me away. The cake was moist and dense with the perfect cream cheese icing. Heavenly!No seriously. Say goodbye to Sprinkles and Magnolia Bakery because you'll never be going back to those insignificant chain bakeries again! Two Little Red Hens is all you need. One thing, don't plan on eating in there. It's small and space is a little tight with so many people trying to get their delicious desserts, but the trip there is oh so worth it.The staff is friendly and efficient--I guess that's the result of having a small space and tons of customers.  As you can see in my picture, they also nicely pack your to go items (there's a little cup in there to hold them steady). I will definitely make the 30 minute trek anytime I need a cake or cupcakes.",2,2,3
5,Tony T.,"New York, NY",240,873,1307,4.0,11/18/2018,"Great bakery on the upper east side that has all the baked goods that you could want. Got a cake and cupcakes here. The cakes are sweet but not overly so and the same goes for the cupcakes. Sometimes they run out of flavors, which is to be expected. There's a line most of the time.",,,
6,Nataly N.,"Brooklyn, NY",285,427,1177,4.0,9/1/2018,"During my recent visit, I got 3 items to go: Key Lime Pie cupcake, Brooklyn Blackout cupcake, and New York Style cheesecake with cherry topping. Although I wasn't impressed with the cupcakes, this place has by far the best cheesecake I've tasted in NYC and I would definitely recommend locals and friends visiting from other places to come here for the cheesecake! The Key Lime pie cupcake was okay. It was a bit too spongy/airy for my taste. However, it was moist enough, with a good amount of flavoring. The key lime custard filling was not mind-blowing. Although I'm a huge chocolate fan, I did not like the Brooklyn Blackout cupcake, which is all-around chocolate, but not made from the best quality chocolate. The cake portion was dry, while the chocolate topping and filling were more sweet than chocolatey. However, the cheesecake was amazing. It had a crunchy, well-patted down buttery crust, topped with fluffy yet creamy cheesecake that melts in your mouth, and the cherry topping was not just generous, but it also tasted like they made it fresh with real cherries. The price was reasonable for the size. The bakery itself is tiny. There are only a few spots to sit, and the way the counters are arranged makes ordering a bit awkward when there is a line. The idea is that customers can look at the selections in the cooler while waiting in line to order, but the 2 girls in front of me were so large that they blocked my entire view and kept shifting their backs into my view when I tried to see around them. I was only able to see all of the cupcakes when I got to the front to order, which only allowed me a few quick seconds to make my selections. One should never be forced to make big decisions in such little time! Nevertheless, service was okay and they wrapped up my order with reasonable efficiency. It's close to Central Park, so I'd definitely come back to take more slices of cheesecake to enjoy in the park.",12,2,8
7,Elizabeth D.,"Queens, NY",143,122,150,4.0,11/8/2018,"This is a very small bakery but they have a small, but delicious assortment of cupcakes and cakes. They have marble, chocolate fudge, peanut butter fudge, key lime, red velvet, Boston creme, coconut (as of right now) and a variety of pies and cakes. The shop is really small with only three tables (two high tables with two seats each and one other round table with four seats). You'll most likely not get a seat here because it's pretty popular, but there's usually only a very short wait to get your cupcake. They have their standard size of cupcake which range from $3.25-$4 and their mini cupcakes (of the same flavors) that are $1.95. Personally I would just go for the larger cupcake for $2 more. It's a lot more cupcake for your buck.I got the marble cupcake and it was delicious. I love the frosting on it, it was really silky and smooth. My only complaint is that the inside of the cupcake wasn't swirled, as I thought it was going to be since it's a ""marble"" cupcake but instead the bottom is chocolate and the top is yellow pound cake. You can definitely taste the difference in the batter and the yellow pound was more crumbly than I expected. But the servers are really nice and and they're pretty efficient.",,,
8,Anna L.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",40,208,261,5.0,9/22/2018,"Two Little Red Hens is a tiny bakery with two tables. I went on a Saturday and there was a line to the door, but the wait isn't too bad. The cheesecake is very good. It is heavy but not too dense. The key lime cupcake was delicious and has fresh lime zest in the frosting! Definitely give it a try! Best cupcake I ever had and I tried a lot of cupcakes!",3,1,3
9,Drew A.,"Hicksville, NY",4999,1213,6244,5.0,10/29/2018,"This place is teeeny tiny, but they've mastered the art of moving a line along, so don't be all scared. The minor wait will be worth it. There's really not too much to say here, it's a small bakery with cakes, pies, cupcakes and some cookies; you can probably find a similar spot every few blocks in Manhattan. Why you should stop in here is bc all of the above is absurdly delicious. How? Why? Don't ask me these things. All I know is that there's a good time happening in that dessert display case and I'm all about good times. As a bonus, they have a rotating selection when the seasons change, so you can pick up your favorites and try something new too. I don't hit up bakeries often, but when I do, I make it TLRH. You should too.",17,8,14
10,Yayrin K.,"Queens, Queens, NY",14,4,0,5.0,11/16/2018,I had 6 inch Brooklyn Blackout to go.  The cake was unforgettable. I would definitely come back here and try other things! And people were super nice too!!,1,1,1
11,Joan S.,"New York, NY",320,80,209,5.0,6/29/2018,"One of my favorite bakeries in NYC! I ordered the Key Lime Pie cupcake and the Brooklyn Blackout cupcake. I've also had the Carrot Cake (full size). These pastries are absolutely DELICIOUS. I'm usually not a big dessert person since I don't have a sweet tooth, but my dessert stomach definitely opens up when it comes to Two Little Red Hens. I would say that my favorite is the Key Lime Pie flavor, given that I enjoy fruity flavors and desserts on the lighter side. The Brooklyn Blackout has a rich chocolate flavor that isn't too heavy. The Carrot Cake is amazing - not too sweet but still very flavorful. When you walk it, you'll find yourself in a cute little shop. There's enough room for a couple of tables. At the counter, you can see their dessert on display and order there. The staff is very friendly. On one occasion, I was able to snag a table and share some cupcakes with a friend. On another occasion, I ordered my pastries to go and they package it in a box with their cute pastry shop label on it. Give this place a shot - this place won't disappoint! Given how wonderful this place is, don't be surprised if you see a line when you arrive. It'll be worth the wait :) I'll definitely be back to try more of their dessert.",2,,

Updated review","Memorial Day 2018:Busy busy today. There was a good 15 minute wait, all worth the the best hands down red velvet cake around! I also tried their cherry cheesecake today, which appears to be a popular item. Basically it's their New York cheesecake with cherry topping. I wasn't very impressed, tasted like your average cheesecake slice. But that's not the reason I come here and circle the block like a shark looking for parking. It's all about the red velvet! Moist delicious cake with a yummy cream cheese frosting. Happy Yelping!",3,,3
15,Jackie W.,"New York, NY",61,69,26,5.0,9/17/2018,"The BEST cakes. Two Little Red Hens is my go to bakery for birthday cakes and my go-tos are the banana cake with cream cheese frosting and the brooklyn blackout cake. I am obsessed with anything banana and my friends order it for me every year, and it keeps getting better and better. The cream cheese frosting is so rich and delicious, paired with the dense banana bread cake.The blackout cake is a classic all chocolate cake designed for chocolate lovers. You really can't go wrong.LOVE, LOVE LOVE!",,,
16,Sherry S.,"New York, NY",196,52,139,5.0,8/28/2018,"This cute little bakery on the UES never disappoints. It is right off the 86th avenue Q train stop and if you're not looking closely, it's pretty easy to walk right past it! There is usually a line on the weekends and on some weekdays, which doesn't surprise me because literally everything they sell is perfect. I have yet to try one of their pies, but the cupcakes, scones, and cookies that I've tried have all been on point. The cupcakes are perfectly moist and the icing can be pretty sweet, but not overbearing. My favorite cupcake has to be the chocolate peanut butter. The saltiness of the pb is a perfect contrast to the sweetness of the chocolate. Another plus is that the peanut butter tastes really fresh, unlike some other cakes with pb that taste like highly processed pb. Many reviewers rave about the Brooklyn Blackout and it is definitely worth trying if you are a big fan of chocolate. If you're not big on chocolate, I would probably stay away as it is VERY chocolatey. Another favorite is the class red velvet. The red velvet cupcake from here is hands down the best red velvet cupcake/cake I've had. The frosting is just a bit too sweet for me personally, but it is perfectly creamy and well-balanced flavor-wise. Beside the pastries, the workers here are always so kind even though they probably have to handle hella crazy customers everyday! They always have a smile and are never rude and never try to rush you. This place is a must try and definitely worth the wait!",2,,
17,Seonghee P.,"Jericho, NY",58,33,15,5.0,11/3/2018,"Amazing dessert place - love literally everything on the menu. The cheesecake is phenomenal, the key lime pie and the key lime pie cupcake is amazing. The cream inside the key lime pie cupcake is honestly the best part. The seasonal pumpkin cheesecake is really good too - more creamy than the original cheesecake but nonetheless really good. Hands down the best cake place I've ever been to.",,,
18,Allen T.,"Queens, NY",290,185,395,4.0,10/30/2018,"Walked past this place, and saw a line out the door. Like most curious onlookers in New York, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. While the line was really long, it moved extremely quick. The process of ordering then paying and receiving order was very fluid. I got the brooklyn cupcake and the NY cheesecake. Cupcakes have filling them which when I cut into oozed out. Very delicious! The cheesecake, was not bad. I enjoyed the crust and the top of the cheesecake more than the middle. Definitely will be coming back soon.",,,
19,Mei L.,"Manhattan, NY",43,83,419,5.0,5/17/2018,"If you are a ""cup cake"" person, let me warn you stay out of here because you will love it so much after trying it and you won't able to leave their spell. It is like been caught in a bad romance with Two Little Red Hens: I want all your cupcakes, I want everything in the store, but got to share with everybody and my tummy is too small to eat them all. I can dream and I can think all your delicious goodies, but I can't have them all. Their cupcakes are delish and moist. Not too sugary nor bland. It is just perfect. They have mini and regular version of cupcakes. I usually don't like frosting, but their frosting is exceptional and delicious indulging. They are cream cheese frosting, which give full of flavors to the cupcakes. There are few tables in the back, but I don't suggest to stay there. This bakery is small and too crowded. It is a delicious treat. Enjoy it.",2,2,1
20,Emily R.,"Manhattan, NY",5,51,83,4.0,8/23/2018,"I was feeling a bit sad and it was a rainy, gloomy kind of day so I demanded an adventure for pastries. We trekked the park and all the way to 2nd just to try out Two Little Red Hens. The bf has actually heard a coworker recommend this place recently so we figured why not?There was a bit of a line and the place is really small - just a few tables. Waiting to pay and get your stuff started to get crowded, but it speaks to how good their products are!I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have any dairy free options available, but they do offer it if you order ahead. We just grabbed two slices of pecan pie and a dairy-free mocha (with almond milk)Our coffees were amazing and when we later had the pecan pie, we decided it was maybe the best pie we've ever had (sorry mama!). It was perfectly mixed between the caramelised pecans, the gooey sweet filling and buttery flakey crust (with a hint of salt) for a very satisfying dessert! I'd love to come back and try their cupcakes - I'm sure it would be worth a  tummy ache for a lactose intolerant :)",1,,1
21,John D.,"New York, NY",97,230,215,4.0,10/24/2018,Pumpkin Pie has to be the best I've had. Creamy and delicate with a wonderful crust. It's a small place so there is easily a line coming out of the establishment. Service was quick. They tend to run out of a lot of things. I would love to try more such as the other pies. When I came they only had pumpkin or apple. Seem to have a large selection of cupcakes.,,,
22,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,5.0,3/16/2018,"Two Little Red Hens consistently makes me want to come back for more. I highly recommend a visit to this tiny but famous bakery whether you're a local or not. Don't be shunned when you see a line out the door. This place is really tiny, but the line moves at a decent speed. I have yet to try everything, but I can speak to several of their desserts.I will note first if you are coming by around the holidays, expect a long line out the door. Order ahead if you want something guaranteed. Also, they serve pies in the morning, cupcakes in the evening, and specific flavors on certain days of the week. I have tried numerous things here: the mini key lime pie, key lime cupcakes, peanut butter cupcakes, brooklyn blackout cake and cupcakes, red velvet cupcakes, chocolate/vanilla sprinkled cupcakes, holiday themed cheesecakes, coconut creme pie, chocolate mousse pie, tri-berry scone, chocolate chunk cookies, and oatmeal raisin cookies.Everything is amazing. My personal favorites are the key lime cupcakes, key lime pie, and chocolate mousse pie. Their selection can be limited or sold out by certain times of the day, so your best bet is to come in the morning or early afternoon, except if you want cupcakes. All their cookies are large, soft baked, and delicious. Their creme pies have a wonderful texture. The list can go on, but I would recommend their creme pies and cupcakes first. I love this place. It's become one of my favorite neighborhood spots. For parties, I've made sure to stop by and get some dessert to bring. The reaction has always been positive. It's a definite must visit in the Upper East.",21,4,14

It's a really small shop with minimal seating. They hand a few different cupcake flavors and a bunch of small cakes. They thankfully have mini cupcakes too for people who want to try multiple and can't eat many of the regular sized ones. Had the yellow cake with chocolate fudge icing. The yellow cake was delicious and moist! The marble one was delicious too, loved how the icing was a combination of Swiss buttercream and fudge icing! They also have a variety of coffee drinks on the menu.",,,
24,Rachel R.,"New York, NY",5,49,57,5.0,5/28/2018,"Looks like everyone and their moms have reviewed this place so I guess I'll add my two cents in too. Living just a couple of blocks from this place is DANGEROUS. I always find myself here when I'm craving something sweet aka that time of the month. Cupcakes-wise, everything is a solid choice...I don't think I've ever had a bad cupcake here. Standouts include my go-to Brooklyn Blackout (chocolate lovers rejoice..that chocolate filling is to die for), Red Velvet (love their cream cheese frosting!), and the Peanut Butter Fudge Swirl. I would pass on the Boston Cream Pie as it doesn't have as much oomph, but that's just personal preference. I like how they have bite-sized mini cupcakes too if you're unsure of a flavor.Their cheesecakes are yummy, especially the Cherry Cheesecake. Come earlier in the day if you wanna get them as they often sell out. They have pies/pastries as well with my favorite being the Apple Pie (not the Apple Crumble...there's a difference!). During the fall/winter months I highly recommend getting their hot chocolate...one of the best in NYC imo and deliciously rich. There's only like 3 small tables near the entrance so not much space to hangout and eat, plus the inside can get pretty crowded at times with two lines going on.",,,
25,Christina F.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",15,72,221,4.0,8/8/2018,This bakery is a gem on the UES! The red velvet is AMAZING! The rest of the flavors are good but personally not my favorite in the city.

26,Greg R.,"New York, NY",225,147,56,5.0,7/18/2018,"Outstanding!  Agree with the other reviews. I got 3 small (tasting) cupcakes and one large cupcake. For the 3 small I went with the Brooklyn Blackout (most popular), carrot cake, and peanut butter swirl. The Brooklyn blackout definitely lived up to the hype. Incredible chocolate flavor and cake. The surprising one was the carrot cake.. it was almost as good as the Brooklyn blackout. The cream cheese topping and carrot cake were delicious.  Even though I'm a big peanut butter fan, the peanut butter swirl was my least favorite of the three. Not bad, but in my opinion it wasn't close to the Brooklyn blackout and carrot cake.  Their cheesecakes also looked great.  The people who worked there were very friendly. Will definitely be back!",3,,1
27,Nicole Q.,"Dallas, TX",262,387,1588,4.0,2/25/2018,I only ordered the cheesecake here. They really have it down. It was uniform and creamy. The top was level and had no cracks. The graham cracker crust was delicious!Interior is pretty small. Maybe 2-3 small square tables. The display had lots of beautiful multilayer cakes about 6 inches in diameter. They also make cupcakes in small and large sizes. I'd like to come back someday to try their different pastries.,96,47,82

Now it all makes sense because the cupcakes are UNBELIEVABLE! I tried the red velvet and the blackout. Both were so creamy and tasty, but I preferred the blackout. It was super decadent but not too rich to the point that you had to wash it down with water or milk between every bite. It was chocolate perfection. The red velvet was also really good and wow the icing actually tasted like cream cheese. Haven't had a red velvet cake/cupcake like that in so long. Highly recommend this spot and can't wait to head back and try some cheesecakes too!",1,1,2

I was looking specifically to try their famous cheesecake and red velvet cupcake. Unfortunately, since I arrived so late, there weren't many of their most popular offerings left. I had a Brooklyn Blackout cupcake, a Boston Cream, and an iced coffee to go. The Brooklyn Blackout was a bit too sweet for me in the first few bites, but I became accustomed to it and it was quite good. Ordered Boston Cream on a whim, and it was surprisingly delicious. Cream in your cupcake - what we didn't know we needed. Iced coffee was alright, but I loved that it came in one of those lids where you don't need to try. My only complaint is that there is very little seating, which I would've liked on a rainy day. I ended up having to split the cupcakes with my friend on the train, but it didn't make it any less delicious. I'm definitely coming back here to try the cheesecake and red velvet!",1,,

I had called ahead in the morning to ask whether the 4 inch red velvet cakes usually sell out by the evening, and the girl on the phone told me that there are usually some left but there's no guarantee. When I arrived, there were luckily still a couple of the 4"" red velvet cakes left and I asked for writing on it (which they did for free!) I chose to have fudge icing for the customization, but they also had other colors available. I was also able to conveniently pick up some birthday candles that they sold in the store. I liked how they packaged the cake really well so that it could endure even the bumpiest of subway rides.I recommend having the cake fresh instead of refrigerating it because it was absolutely delicious eating it the same day it was baked. The 4"" cake was perfect to share among 4 people. I was impressed by the cream cheese frosting but thought there could be way less of it since consuming that much frosting was a bit sickening.",1,,

Once you step inside it's easy to forget that Manhattan is right on the other side of that glass. It's got an authentic aw-shucks vibe and baked goodies to make you feel right at home. And the staff is equally as welcoming. I'm honestly usually all about the icing when it comes to a cake/cupcake, and while theirs is delicious in every way and not that overly sweet kind that hurts your teeth, it's the cake that is the standout. It's fresh and flavorful, just like a homemade-but-without-all-the-work-and-mess cupcake should be. I also love the refreshing break from show-off-y weird flavors that no one really wants to eat (I actually saw a Buffalo Chicken Cuocake last week! *gag*). They're like plussed-up basics...Brooklyn Blackout, Key Lime, Red Velvet, Boston Cream, all fantastic. I should also mention they have baby sized cupcakes of almost all of the flavors, and while that seems fun, we went with the standard size. This time.",,,3

Updated review","Best bakery in New York! Well their red velvet cupcakes are to die for! My second review, still the employees are okay.Location: 5 minute walk from 86th station. The bakery is small, seating is probably around 10 people max. The interior is nice, feels like a countryside vibe! Service: The employees are still not that great. I felt like I was discriminated at some point. They smile at certain race but when I came, no smile at all and just ask for my order. Hopefully this will change cause indeed they sell really good pastries.Food: Cupcakes are a must! They come around 11am that is why I don't have pictures! But try the red velvet, brooklyn blackout and carrot! Anyway every flavor is good! I tried the eggnog before it was soo good! For today I had almond cherry scone, which is good! Huge chunks of cherry and almonds in there! Mocha latte is good too! Cakes are a bit pricey!Price rating: 8 out of 10. The only expensive here is the cakes, 15 dollars for a very tiny cake. Other products are okay price.Get the cupcakes!! They are soo good and moist! A must visit bakery in upper east side!",,1,

I was craving cupcakes on a Saturday night and stopped by here after hearing others rave about it. It was getting close to the end of the night for them since they were starting to run out of things, but I was able to get 4 of their cupcakes. Red velvet, key lime, coconut, and carrot. All of them were so good and I'm so glad I got all 4. Although they were all amazing and i would get all of then again, my favorite was the key lime. It had the most perfect sour key lime filling, with a light vanilla frosting....So good!! I also really liked how much the coconut flavor stood out in the coconut cupcake. I got a mint tea with my cupcakes, which was good, and we were able to grab a table inside but they only have a couple tables so most people take their dessert to go. I can't wait to be back soon to try more flavors!",3,1,

You could walk past it and never even realize that the best cupcake is under this little red awning. For about 3.50 a cupcake, it's not expensive. I asked what the best seller is, and it's the Brooklyn Blackout. It's a chocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting and pudding inside. And boy is it perfect. It is the most perfect texture. Moist, soft, and not too sweet. I was worried about the pudding on the inside, that it may be overly sweet, but it was perfectly balanced. I was so incredibly impressed. The chocolate flavor really comes through. It's a small store, and just as I ordered, 10 people filled up the space in no time. Absolutely amazing.

There were a few people in line before me, but after a few minutes the line got much longer which is a testament to how great their baked goods are.I ordered a chai latte and a small yellow vanilla cupcake. I don't usually like cupcakes because they're too sweet, but the icing on this cupcake was  really light and not too over the top. One thing to keep in mind is that the selection dwindles down pretty fast since it's such a popular bakery. By the time I got to the bakery they didn't have all of their cake selections.",2,,

Updated review","This place has never disappointed me. It was my husband's birthday and I got him his favorite yellow cake with Swiss vanilla buttercream. I tried to ask for no sprinkles but it seemed not possible. It was a good idea to let the cake sit at the room temperature for a while and let the buttercream soften.I have also gotten a slice of cheesecake and cherry pie. The cheesecake was indeed again the best in NYC! The cherry pie was very good and I was able to tell that they made the sauce in-house. About two days prior, we went there with one of my coworkers. We got a mini chocolate cupcake, a regular yellow cupcake, and a carrot cupcake.  Normally, I don't like carrot cakes but this one was very good! I loved that there had walnut inside and the spices weren't super overwhelmed.",5,,1
45,Heather R.,"New York, NY",212,248,234,5.0,1/12/2018,"I blame living 2 blocks from here on some of my weight issues. I love everything about this bakery...the quaint space is so charming, but the baked goods, well... they will keep you coming back over and over. My favorites are the cupcakes... ultimately, the Brooklyn Blackout is my winner. However, the Red Velvet, Banana, Coconut, Peanut Butter, the plain chocolate cupcake with the buttercream frosting is lovely too. Over the fall, they had a Spice cake cupcake with a cream cheese frosting that was yummy.. yet, let's move on to the other bits... The cheese cake is amazing, toppings or not, depends on your preference.. the cookies are great, scones in early mornings and I'm a fan of the mini Coconut Cream pies too, as they remind me of being a child when my mom or dad would make them...They offer cakes in several sizes and flavors, smaller pies, cupcakes in a few sizes and typically coffee/tea, & water.. Early mornings.. they serve scones and muffins, they're gone by mid morning typically. Then, the magic starts happening with the cupcakes. On typical days, I will stop by for a coffee and a cupcake, or have picked them up  with family, friends to stay and share... or alone to take home for a later time.. after having a bite next door. You really cannot beat this place... it gets busy and they will run out of the favorites by early evening, depending on the day, or around holidays. Don't get discouraged about the line... you typically just walk in and there is a line to order, so I would recommend that you spend this time figuring out your game plan when it's your turn. It's small, but so good. :)",2,,

On any day of the week a line can form at this little bakery with people just waiting to get their hands on some cookies, cakes, cupcakes, coffee, etc. Don't be surprised if they are out of some things because of high demand, especially by later in the day. They offer a few seats, but it's probably best to take your snack to go during peak hours. Everything sold is a very reasonable price for the quality they are (i.e. a small cake of about 4"" will run you about $15). My absolute favorite there is the Brooklyn blackout brownies which are chocolate all over and filled with a chocolate pudding type filling. Yum!

It has a nice crunchy texture that adds another dimension to the cheesecake. Everything I've ever ordered from there whether it be cookies, cupcakes (and of course now cheesecake) I've never been disappointed. My personal favorite cupcake is the chocolate peanut butter, if you're a peanut butter lover like myself then you'll love it. I can't wait to try their pies next! I love the decor in here too, it's has a very homey vibe -- and of course the smell of fresh baked goods always adds a great touch.

The cheesecake itself was light and airy in texture (in American cheesecake standards, definitely not at the Japanese level), but the flavor was a little lacking. I guess I like a little more creaminess and cream cheese flavor common in homemade cheesecakes. The Brooklyn Blackout was a total letdown for me--I've had some very good chocolate cakes, and was expecting this to top those, so that's partially my fault.",1,,

It's so worth it to come here. There are a few seats available, 2 high top tables with 2 seats and one table with 4 seats. We stumbled upon this little place after our dinner and got two things: red velvet cupcake and their classic New York cheese cake.The cheesecake was so moist, so rich, and tasted amazing. It never got to the point where it was ""too much"". I shared the piece of cake and once it was done I was really sad LOL. The cheese cake tasted slightly sweet, has that hint of salt, and that rich - cheese cakey taste. I'm horrible at describing this but you have to try! Sure, the price may be a bit much for a piece of cake but every bite is worth it.The red velvet cupcake was amazing, too. I've never had a cupcake that was so moist and soft. The icing was not too sweet at all, it had the right amount of cream cheese and sugary goodness. It's the first time I've ever finished a cupcake icing along with the cupcake itself. It's amazing. I'de recommend anyone to drop by this gem if they can. Do yourself a favor. Also, try not to order everything. Honestly, the place smells amazing and all the cakes looks too good to be true.",2,1,1

I decided on ordering 2 regular-sized cupcakes - the vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting and the Brooklyn Blackout, a chocolate cupcake with chocolate frosting with chocolate pudding on the inside. While the cake part of the vanilla cupcake was light and airy, the vanilla frosting was quite dense and sweet - these aspects balanced each other out well. As long as you eat them together (as opposed to eating all of the cake part first to indulge in the frosting later like I usually do), you will be satisfied with this very vanilla cupcake. My mind said I could eat two cupcakes in one sitting, but by the time I finished the very vanilla cupcake, my stomach said no more, so I reconstructed the box that I somewhat tore apart, brought the Brooklyn Blackout cupcake home, and refrigerated it for tonight. Each regular-sized cupcake is probably large enough to leave you full for at least a couple hours.The Brooklyn Blackout was as decadent as it can get. Three different types of way to include chocolate left my sweet tooth satisfied for the night. Similar to the vanilla cupcake, the frosting was quite dense while the cupcake portion was light and airy. The pudding turned out to be my favorite part, and it was such a delicious surprise when having that first bite of the pudding in the cupcake. Overall such a great find and I am glad I included Two Little Red Hens in my Yorkville food crusade. I would recommend this place to anyone else in NY!",,,

I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. I've tried most of the daily flavors, but one day I'll work through all the seasonal flavors. Luckily, the black out is always available (unless you're there too late). The cupcakes are so rich. I always get it to go so I can have it with a glass of milk (call me a kid, but that's the only way to have sweets). I'm also a fan of red velvet and that delicious cream cheese icing.

Updated review","URGENT: the Brooklyn blackout cake is one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had, hands down, and you need to try it. Anyone who tells you that you have the same experience with their BB cupcake is LYING to you. You can't simulate four layers of cake and three layers of pudding in a cupcake. You just can't. The pumpkin harvest cake was also perfection. Moist and pumpkiny. I write for a living. +1 star to my overall rating for how amazing these cakes were.Edit 6/2017: rhubarb scone and key lime pie are amazing, and the pecan coffee cake is simply phenomenal. Cherry pie is great too but definitely go for the key lime (weekends only.)Edit 11/2017: pumpkin scone is as amazing as it looks. Pumpkin muffin is also decent but definitely on the sweeter side, if that concerns you. Oatmeal raisin cookie is delicious.Edit 12/2017: GINGERBREAD IS THE BEST EVER OMGGGG. Banana bread is great.Edit 2/2018: Tried a bunch of mini cupcakes. The carrot cake and key lime were my favorites; the red velvet was amazing, too. And do I even have to tell you the Brooklyn blackout is worth getting? Sweet potato pie was also A+++",1,,2

Brooklyn blackout is good as a mini cupcake because it's quite rich. Banana cupcake was also very good. My family always asks me to bring a lemon, raspberry, or coconut cake every time I visit! I have to stop myself from going here every weekend because it's just too good! Also, there will always be a line, so expect to wait. And if you need a cake on a holiday, get there once they open.",,,
70,Emanuel C.,"New York, NY",551,141,305,3.0,4/18/2018,"This place is also slowly becoming an indulgence. We think their cupcakes are fantastic and I like that they have mini-cupcakes that are not so large. Arguably their cupcakes are almost the same volume as a slice of cake. While their food tastes great and they have a few flavors that are not in the norm, their prices are a bit outrageous. It is very easy to spend $50-60 per visit. It is right next door to Schaller and Weber...So naturally, if I have my daughters with me when I shop there on the weekend they want to go next door and grab a cupcake. They (my kids) don't necessarily discriminate, especially my middle daughter who usually just wants vanilla based cake and frosting; essentially she doesn't discriminate because she doesn't try anything else. My eldest like's an assortment of tastes and flavors and she discerns heavily what she will and will not eat. My wife and I just want a treat that won't kill us with a smattering of nuts. While I will pick up a snack or two on the weekend. I'm trying to keep it under $20. I'd suggest their portions shrink by 5-10% and they adjust their pricing a bit. I do enjoy some of their coffee's but I have had a few cups here that were less than stellar. The brewing hasn't been consistent each time.This is arguably a gourmet dessert shop. Their cakes are fantastic! But the coffee does not always follow suit. As a Cuban man raised on strong blends of cafe and taught to make a variety of them for guests as a necessity and from our own family bakery growing up, I like trying different coffee wherever I go. I'm almost an elitist snob about my coffee. Unfortunately, in my humble opinion, the coffee here is reliant on the equipment, not the staff who are not barista's. Keeping in mind that this statement is me giving them the benefit of the doubt in lacking training or focus for brewing a great cup of coffee versus uncleaned and unkempt equipment.The space is also ridiculously small. Last time I was there a horrendously annoying woman kept pushing in front of myself and the line, while most folks were getting irritated by her, she kept asking questions and instead of the staff politely telling her, to please wait and get to the back of the line (which stretched outside), they did not, which allowed and does tend to allow this type of entitled behavior from various customers that I've personally seen each time I've walked in. I can understand, people have a hard time seeing what is available to buy because:1) The place is always so full you can't really see the counters until you are ready to pay and you end up holding the growing-in-frustration line of patrons. 2) There is no real menu setup that makes choice easily selected. 3) While it's nice that they have a couple of bar height tables in the location, this tends to hinder the space. While waiting in line people are nudging and budging through you to get to the table or you are sitting and eating or drinking a hot beverage and are getting bumped by the lines, especially if they are adapting and shifting to annoying people trying to skip ahead. I'm seemingly beating this place up with this review. So let me bring this back to focus. Really good food and the staff are extremely courteous and bubbly. The prices need to be adjusted. The coffee can be much better. But it is not terrible. I'd consider focus training all of the servers as barista's and have them become artisans. You are charging for the premium of getting top shelf coffee. just follow through. This is likely the easiest thing to adjust.The space isn't good for seating. Consider utilizing it to maximize sales and funneling people in and out faster, instead of 5-8 people who can sit in clutter and shoulder-to-shoulder disruptive obstructions. arguably mocking us with their privilege to sit while we wait and stand and shuffle.

I do wish it had a LITTLE more of the lemon tart gel though.Overall, I would suggest coming here for baked goods.  They have a large variety but go early on or call ahead to check what they have left because they run out quickly!",3,2,4

They even put my mini cupcake in a little cup to keep it safe on my trek home and wrapped the other. They had an awesome area of cupcakes and cakes, there's something there for everyone!

Even though the line may be long, they are super quick and get you in and out. We tried the marble cupcake and the banana cupcake which had cheesecake frosting. They were both fantastic.

They also never ran out of a flavor. As soon as one ran low, they immediately restocked it.There are displays of their cakes to go (3 different sizes), cupcakes, and pies. I love that they have mini versions of all their cupcakes! It's really the perfect size if you want to try multiple flavors.Since it was PI DAY, we could't leave without getting a slice of pie. We got an apple pie + mini brooklyn blackout cupcake + mini peanut butter fudge cucpake for the two of us.EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! - Brooklyn blackout is definitely a chocolate lovers dream - rich chocolate cake with a lighter chocolate pudding? inside, topped with chocolate frosting. Half a mini was definitely enough for me. This looks like the most popular flavor here- Peanut butter fudge cupcake is a PB lovers dream (aka me!) - chocolate cupcake with light peanut butter pudding? inside, topped with chocolate and peanut butter swirled frosting. LOVED this!- Apple pie was standard, but delicious nonetheless. Not sure if all their cupcakes have a filling inside, or just the ones we ordered.

The coconut cream pie cupcake was to die. It was a perfect combination of cream pie and cake! I was skeptical to try it at first thinking the pudding in the cake might be gross, soggy- but it was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend trying it if you're a coconut lover.  The banana cupcake was also insanely good! It taste like banana bread with a yummy cream cheese frosting, it was not overwhelmingly sweet which is a plus for me! The vanilla fudge was as expected, cooked perfect, yummy homemade frosting!  They are available for orders and if you want a specific Cake, full pie I would order ahead!

I haven't tried everything but I can vouch for their perfect red velvet cupcakes (addictive cream cheese frosting, perfect cake crumb and texture), their pecan chocolate pie (chock full of pecans with big slabs of chocolate!) and my newest obsession: the pecan crunch coffee cake. It's a large square slab of coffee cake with a lovely cinnamon pecan streak through the center and a crispy nutty, sugary top. How do they do it? I don't know but what I know is that I can't make a coffee cake to rival it. So I'll just have to make the trek here for my $3.25 coffee cake!Another amazing thing about TLRH: the price.

My fiancé only likes key lime pie. The only thing he wanted for his birthday this year was a key lime pie. Simple, I thought.  I called several weeks in advance to find out precisely how to order as I wanted to make sure that I had everything done early so I wouldn't have issues. I was told I needed to call back the Tuesday of the week I needed the pie and order then. Easy enough! I called back on Tuesday, went through the steps of ordering, and then the girl says ""sorry we actually can't accept pie orders this weekend."" This was super confusing. I figured maybe because it was July 4th? So She assured me, multiple times, that there will be plenty of key lime pies in stock on Friday if I just walk in to purchase it. This still worried me though, and she said worst case scenario I could come back Saturday to get it, if they happened to sell out Friday before I got there. I was already pretty upset by this answer, but it seemed certain I would purchase a pie on either Friday or Saturday. Friday rolls around, instead of going home from work I come here to get the pie. I order a pie at the counter and am told they have no cold pies this week or next. WHAT? I clarify again. I tell the girl what I was told on the phone to come in. She says they won't have any cold pies this week or next due to an issue with a distributor (so I'm also guessing they don't actually make their baked goods?? As it was not just this pie- it was all cold pies). Then, to top it off, I say ""it would have been nice to know this when I called twice about this pie, so I didn't ruin my fiancé's only birthday gift"" and the girl working very rudely responded with ""it would have been nice for us to know too.""Like- I get that things happen.

Updated review","It has been a while since coming to this bakery and for a good excuse, I was excited to come back here again! I still remember the first time having their cupcakes and their banana cream cheese cake that really left a good impression on me so I recommended this bakery as an option to order a birthday cake for a celebration coming up! I came in the afternoon around 3-4pm and it was packed; a line forming when I arrived and as I left- tells you how good this place is! The line moved fairly quickly as the ladies behind the counters had a system that made it painless! You get to the counter and someone will take you order, go to the register, pay and get your goodies! Today I ordered a banana cream cheese cake cause I remember it being soo moist and soo good as well as their infamous Brooklyn blackout cupcake and their yellow vanilla cupcake! Prices are reasonable for their size and quality for sure! After dinner, we sampled the cupcakes and cakes to see the possibilities of coming here to order the birthday cake! Their yellow vanilla cupcake was light and not too sweet like other bakeries which was a big plus! Cake was moist and delicious! The banana cake was super super dense and creamy(filling). I enjoyed every bite! My sisters thought it was a little on the dry side but personally I think the cream cheese filling complimented the cake well! The Brooklyn blackout is dense and just the way I remembered having it in the past! Two Little Red Hens is a must try!",,,
98,Matt O.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",355,18,23,5.0,8/30/2018,I went for the first time and it was very tasty! I got the banana cupcake and it was delicious.

I'll definitely be back again.,,,
99,Julia K.,"Solon, OH",116,75,59,5.0,4/12/2018,So charming we stopped here every morning! The lattes were wonderful and the baked goods Devine! Absolutely loved the maple latte. It was a perfect start to each morning in the city. The cupcakes (which don't start coming out until 11am) we're some of the best I had ever had. I was devastated when I found out they weren't selling them yet before leaving the city. I wanted to bring them back home for my family. Instead I brought home some muffins and scones which were also incredible! The scone was moist and soft and delicious which can be difficult to achieve with scones. I had never seen a pear ginger scone before and knew I had to try one. It was such a unique flavor and they completely nailed it.  You can tell everything was freshly baked with love. My first day back home and I am already missing this sweet little bakery.,,,
100,Sumana K.,"Philadelphia, PA",125,161,401,5.0,1/6/2018,The Brooklyn Blackout was a total knock out! Chocolate-y but not overwhelming. Soft and moist. Got three individual cupcakes instead of sharing a mini cake between 5 of us because the cupcakes are stored at room temp while the cakes are slightly chilled and take about 1 hr to warm up. So stick to cupcakes if buying for immediate consumption. Can't wait to try some of the other flavors!,2,,2

I've been to a lot of hyped up places lately that just don't leave feeling your time and money were well spent. This place was worth the trek from Central Park and then some (we walked!)We came late on a Saturday night so the desserts were pretty picked through. Basically whatever was left in the glass was what they had. We noticed this deterred a few people who left disappointed but in our opinion what we had was still so worth it.We got the Blueberry, Ginger, Plum pie and two Boston cream cupcakes. They were perfection! Mouthwatering and unique. The cupcake was the best I ever had. They also were kind enough to let us stick a candle in it (but of course not light it). The place was small with only 4 tables. We actually managed to snag one which was nice. It appeared that most people were taking it to go. Next time I would try calling in and ordering exactly what I want. My final impression on this place was this: I have to have my birthday cake from New York City EVERY year, no matter where I am. Also, do you deliver to Boston? :)",,,

Their cupcakes make great gifts and are such a treat in regular and miniature 2-bite size. I've tried almost every basic flavor of the cupcakes and most recently enjoyed the key lime cupcake and coconut cupcake. I've come here once before to pick up a cake in the morning before work. I was there 7:15am waiting for doors to open 7:30am. While waiting, I see other would-be customers trying to open door (even though I'm standing there) and at 7:20am there was a already a line forming behind me. It's not new and it wasn't the holidays.

Ok I just took a break from this review to eat some semisweet chocolate chips inspired by my memory of the chocolate cupcake we ordered here. I'm not a bakery person per se, I actually bake a lot. My nickname is ""bekki crocker"" because of it. Enough about me, the cupcake was really good. Very decadent and chocolately. Cake part was moist. Frosting was not overwhelmingly rich which I have experienced at other places that I will not name (SAS cupcakes in Newark, DE now closed). I'm actually the sick species of human that enjoys every part of the cupcake...EVEN the cake-only part at the bottom. You might have thought we were extinct but low and behold, we are not. It was delicious and I ate the whole thing remarkably fast. This is the only item I have had here so I am not sure what else to say.

We thought we could try it for dessert and thankfully when we walked back, it was still open.This place deserves a serious commendation for carrying the world's best banana cream cup cakes. Unlike in most other bakeries, not just the frosting matched the flavor but the cake tasted like banana as well. I cant even start talking about that creamy rich frosting without throwing in a bunch of cliched adjectives. A real winner that doesn't make me feel guilty.Apparently Brooklyn blackout & cheese cake are the raved ones here, but unfortunately they were gone since we got there late evening.

I usually shave off the frosting from cupcakes but this frosting cannot be chucked- it's simply amazing and complements the cupcake to perfection. I'll go for a red velvet next time.... I don't doubt it's just as amazing. Both times I've gone there has been no line to wait on, so I'd say it's key to go during non-peak hours, e.g. 12-1pm and after 4pm.

114,Juliana T.,"Manhattan, NY",207,239,464,4.0,11/14/2017,"Yes, Two Little Red Hens makes great baked goods, but for me, the best thing about this bakery is the ambiance.  When you walk in, you find yourself in what feels like a mom-and-pop-shop in small town USA.  Signs are hand-written, tables/chairs are tiny and wooden, and the staff are some of the most friendly in UES.  Combine these wonderful attributes with delicious cakes, pies, and cupcakes, and it shouldn't surprise you that it can get pretty crowded in here at times.I came on a Friday mid-afternoon to pick up some cupcakes, and stood on line to order.  The ordering system is a little confusing; the line to order is in the middle, the line to pay is on the left, and the line to pick up pre-orders is on the right.  Despite how small the store was, the line moved along relatively quickly.  After placing my order, I got on the left line to pay, where they also brought me my order.  My 3 cupcakes were packaged nicely in a box with 1 upside-down cup in the 4th quadrant to keep my cupcakes from toppling over--so smart!  My only complaint is that I wish they were use paper shopping bags instead of plastic bags for to-go orders to keep cakes and pies from moving around too much.I ordered the three most popular cupcakes: Brooklyn Blackout, red velvet, and carrot cake.  I was most excited about the carrot cake and red velvet, but actually favored the Brooklyn Blackout (chocolate cake with chocolate frosting) out of the 3!  The cakes were moist, and the frostings were creamy without being tooth-achingly sweet.  I will definitely return to try some of their pies, too!",8,2,4

Their Classic American cupcake, an old school simple cupcake with real buttercream icing, was a far superior version of the classic Magnolia Bakery depression-era cupcake recipe. They were a little bigger than Magnolia's,always fresher, and the price was much better. So why one star? They decided to stop making their best cupcake. All that's left are basic run-of-the-mill cupcakes. The closest one to their Classic American is far too sweet. When you've got a cupcake that puts Magnolia Bakery to shame, why get rid of it? It's the cupcake that brought me there in the first place (I kept hearing about their classic American cupcake and how I had to try one), and the cupcake that made me spread the word to my friends and neighbors. It's a real shame. I haven't purchased anything there in months. Not worth it.",2,2,1

It was not so heavy and sweet but it had strong and smooth cheese flavor. I had a cheese heaven moment. Inside was so cozy and lovey. I really liked the atmosphere here.

My friend got a slice of the New York cheesecake and I got the classic cherry the first time we went. The cheesecake was bomb. definitely belongs in the top 5 that I've had in New York. The pie was also delicious but it got overwhelming half way through. And because I had to settle for it because it was all they had that day, I wasn't enjoying it as much as I should have. When I went the second time I got the blueberry and it was so amazing. Just the right amount of filling with the perfect flaky crust. I would definitely recommend this.Overall, anyone around the UES should give this place a try. It is a small place but its cozy and the staff is so friendly and accommodating.

Updated review","Memories from the Corner of my Mind.....Rainy Day Memories... My morning snack was a piece of NY Style Cheesecake from Two Little Red Hens. I can't tell you how happy I am that this great little bakery has survived the 2nd Avenue Subway construction! I had no problem at 10-10:15 AM getting a seat so I could enjoy my cheesecake. I am a Cheesecake Factory Fanatic but I have to say this is the best NY Cheesecake in the city! I enjoyed looking at all the goodies before I made my decision. There are scones, cookies, cupcakes, pies, and cherry cheesecake too. The service was very fast and pleasant employees. The place is clean and well stocked with napkins and anything else you need to enjoy your desert. If it wasn't for my health I'd be here every day for a different treat. I do plan to return soon for the Peanut Butter Cupcake. They were huge! You definitely owe it to yourself to stop by for a treat when you're in the neighborhood!",109,66,112
135,Linda D.,"East Bronx, NY",75,264,1433,5.0,11/5/2017,"We were on the look out for a good desert on our way back up town. Remembered I had this bookmarked! It's a really tiny place! Adorable decorated! The line was out the door at one point. Only about 4-5 small tables! So they had nice looking cakes, but it was to purchase the whole cake. I could have easily eaten a small size, but that wouldn't be good for me. So we ordered, a slice of NY cheese cake, pumpkin cheese cake, a Brooklyn black out cup cake, and 2 marble cup cakes. Oh an a cute mini peanut butter chocolate cupcake. (Bite size). They were really all delicious. Very fresh! They had a nice organization to the ordering process for such a tiny bakery! We will visit again!",1,1,1

My wife and I ordered six different cupcakes and thought these might rival Mollys cupcakes for best in the city. We were way wrong. The vanilla frosting and vanilla cake tasted like eating a stick of butter. I think they forgot sugar and vanilla in the frosting. The Boston creme tasted weird. The marble cupcake was ok, the Brooklyn blackout was ok and everyone says it's great. I thought average at best.The red velvet and peanut butter cupcakes were good but nothing special. I would definitely prefer Molly's cupcakes to these. $4 per cupcake I just expected more flavor.",3,2,1

139,Lee H.,"Great Neck, NY",0,6,1,5.0,11/5/2018,After reading so many reviews about the brooklyn blackout I decided to try it and it was sooooo delicious. I'm usually not a big fan of chocolate cupcakes because they're usually too overwhelming. But the ones here makes me want to come back and eat more. It's full of chocolate flavor and yet not too overbearing where it makes me feel guilty having more than one. I love love love it! It's such a cute and quaint place too!,,,

The Brooklyn blackout, and the peanut butter fudge take the (cup)cake. They have a bomb boston cream, carrot cake, and key lime too. I've tried the classic New York cheesecake and it's SUBLIME! There's always a queue here, and later the evening goes, they run out of specific flavours. They also have mini versions for about $1.75 which are good if you're taking two cupcakes to go and decided to nomnom on a mini one for yourself :P. The big cupcakes are about $3.75, if I'm not wrong. These cupcakes are also aesthetically pleasing, for those of you instagrammers and food bloggers. I'm fortunate enough to live rather close by to TLRH and would never pass on an opportunity to swing by there! It's also tricky since my self control is strongly tested each time I'm around here haha. Seating is a bit cramped and more often than not, I take it to go. You can always sit in and get an Arnold Palmer or another beverage to go with that mouthwatering cake.",,1,

Their bittersweet chocolate ganache frosting is heavenly. Since moving to NYC over two years ago, I never found a cupcake that matched it's deliciousness. Flash forward to yesterday when I wandered into Two Little Red Hens on a whim.I ordered their yellow cupcake with chocolate frosting and it was EXCEPTIONAL. The frosting was the perfect amount, and hallelujah not obnoxiously sweet! It had a lovely chocolate flavor to it, as if made by your mom (if she was a professional pastry chef) for your 5th birthday. The cake was soft and fluffy and tasted very fresh. I cannot wait to go back and try their coconut creme as well as their chocolate cupcakes. Their display case has full sized cakes too, which I will for sure be ordering.I'm sorry it took me over two years to find this place but I'm so glad I did!",2,,1
143,Courtney C.,"New York, NY",359,110,40,5.0,3/31/2018,"After living downtown for years and inherently despising anything above 14th street, I finally got myself to Two Little Red hens. Saying that I have a sweet tooth is a massive understatement. Sugar, flour, and butter are my main food groups. SO, when I came here, the bar was high. Everything. Is. Marvelous. If you can get past the teacup sized interior and line out the door, you will find cake heaven. They're known for their cupcakes and cheesecake. Cheesecake slices are massive, and you'll want to buy two for yourself, but they are rich and so filling. Go for a slice. Or two, who cares. Best in NYC. Now cupcakes are difficult because everyone has different taste. I'm partial to the light texture and sweetness of Magnolia's vanilla, but love the creativity and decadence of Molly's. Two Little Red Hens nailed both flavor and texture. I love that you can also buy bite sized ones, which are equally as delicious as the full sized. The go to flavors are Brooklyn Blackout and carrot. Oh my god, the carrot is the best I've ever had. If you're lucky enough to strike gold with their seasonal flavors, the key lime is OUT OF THIS WORLD. I do have to say, I didn't love the red velvet. Very blah. Now an uptown girl, (literally, I moved two blocks away,) I made this bakery part of my weekly routine. This morning, I tried the ginger pear scone. Sounds off putting right? I always think of scones as dry, crumbly, thick bread, in need of clotted cream and jam to provide flavor - not to mention Tea to prevent your mouth from drying up. NOT the scones here. Their only flavor was insanely delicious - rich balanced flavors with just the right amount of sweetness. The scone's texture was almost cake like; light and airy, with intense moisture. I couldn't decide whether or not to devour it all at once or savor every bite like the precious gift it was. Five visits, six different products, and Two Little Red Hens impresses every time. Already looking forward to my next treat!",3,2,1

So, although it was far, and out of our way, we decided to give it a shot. After the long commute, we arrive and... THEY WEREN'T MAKING ANY CHEESECAKE THAt WEEK because it was Thanksgiving Week. (If you ask me I think that's all the more reason to make it. I mean that when all the tourists come.) That was a big bummer! But we decided to try their cupcakes instead. Their cupcakes were actually really good. We each got a different flavor, and I'd probably have to say their Coconut or Pumpkin Spice has the top two. The place it's self is small, and got crowded quickly, with not much seating. The workers were talking amongst themselves, and continued talking for at least 3 mins, until finally acknowledging us. Pricing wise, we spent like $20 for 4 cupcakes. All in all, it's a good bakery, but disappointed us after traveling out of our way for something they were known for, but didn't have.",,1,

I have tried several items (cupcakes, key lime pie, buttermilk biscuit, cinnamon bun).

The cheesecake is seriously amazing - not super dense like a typical NY style cheesecake, but rather soft and fluffy with a subtle hint of tanginess and a delicious crust (which i would love to have more of actually). I've had junior's, eileen's and mahzedahr's cheesecakes and I can confidently say this one is the best.The mini cupcakes we got were great too but I'm looking forward to having the fullsize ones soon!! The one negative is that oh my god they take absolutely forever to pick up the phone!! I've called two or three different times and always had a 10-30 minute wait before someone even picked up the phone, just ridiculous. I understand it's super busy but at the very least pick up, acknowledge the caller, answer their question if it's brief, or place them on hold. Introduce a simple online ordering system so you don't have to spend time on the phone taking orders. One time I was on hold for half an hour just to ask if I could change my pickup time. Come on....Edited to add: recently went back for a few more cupcakes. The key lime cupcake is pure amazeballs!!!",,,

My boyfriend surprised me by taking me here on our last trip. He said this place was on the list of best cheesecake in NYC! And it was pretty darn delicious! A slice of plain cheesecake was $4. To my surprise it was lighter and fluffier than other typical New York cheesecakes. I prefer the thicker and creamier kind, but this was worth the try! Everyone has their own preference. It was on sweeter/vanilla side, which is my favorite! Some cheesecakes have a tangy taste to them, but not this one. A basic gram cracker crust, which was tasty but could be thicker. Overall, if you are looking to try a new cheesecake in the city definitely worth the trip. But if you like thick, rich, and creamy cheesecake then this might not be your favorite place. They sell other delicious items as well! I also bought a double chocolate cupcake and it was to die for! Not too sweet, but sweet enough. It was amazing!! They sell cakes, cookies, pies, and coffee. The store has very limited space so plan on not eating there. The line was pretty much out the door when we were there (Sunday afternoon around 2ish) but the line moves fairly quickly!

They even write personalized messages on the small cakes with dainty elegant icing.I love the tri-berry muffins, so buttery and perfect. The muffin selection changes seasonally, so in the winter you don't have a ton of options, but the tri-berry and banana chocolate are reliable standbys.It's a small shop, and I've seen the line out the door, so your best bet is to come get your baked goods first thing in the morning.",4,,2

158,Bryan S.,"West Bronx, NY",40,15,6,3.0,4/29/2018,"Just a note here to say that the ""New York Cheesecake"" as it was labeled here at Two Little Red Hens was not at all thick and rich, but rather light and fluffy. As I've come to know it, when you say a cheesecake is New York Style that means it is incredibly dense. Take this paragraph from a Chowhound article for example: ""What makes a New York cheesecake official is its dense texture, which feels so smooth and rich you can't eat more than a small-to-medium slice without regretting it later. Because it's heavy. Haters compare it to a brick or a slab of cream cheese on crust. But pro-New York cheesecake enthusiasts are adamant about its superiority."" bit.ly/2Kpg4IeIf you like a light and fluffy cheesecake then feel free to give this one a try. Maybe it works for that kind of thing. Personally, my craving for the dense wonder that is a NY Cheesecake was left unsatisfied.

I have had their spiced cider in the winter and it warms all of the crevices of my cold, black, New Yorker heart. I just tried the iced black currant tea today which at first sip I thought was incredible - but after I drank a bit, it is pretty much a normal black tea.My favorite pastry of all time here is the triberry scone. I especially enjoy taking it home, warming it up with a little butter inside. However it is delicious in any shape or form. I have also tried several of the cupcakes in mini version which I will review now.Peanut butter fudge something deliciousness: I was a little worried it would be too much chocolate with not enough peanut butter but one bite inside I got the peanut butter surprise! It was excellent. The chocolate was rich and then cut perfectly with the salt peanut taste. The red velvet is a classic and delicious as ever, the cream cheese frosting was light and sweet, though less exciting than the others I find. However that is more a red velvet thing than a TLRH things.The chocolate blackout is yummy - rich and rich and chocolate chocolate. And that is all for now - my food high is making me more incoherent than normal.TL;DR: make this a spot you visit no matter the season. You will not be disappointed.",3,,1

Only down sides are some things sell out early, they only have fresh batches of goodies after a certain time (so going early in the morning gives you the smallest selection), and it's small without much seating. I usually just get a few things to go anyway so that's fine by me. The line moves pretty fast even when there's a crowd. I love them and I'm sure you will too!",,,

I've tried their red velvet, banana, brooklyn blackout, cheesecake.. they're all fantastic, Their cakes are amazing b/c they're so moist and not too sweet. And the cream cheese frosting is to die for. i'll admit the brooklyn blackout was a tad too sweet for me and my least favorite flavor out of the ones i've tried. I've tried their cupcakes too, but b/c the sizes are smaller, it can be a hit or miss regarding their texture as it can be sometimes a bit dry. Usually you have to place an order a day in advance, if you want decorating and writing on your cake , however, I've had an occasion when I came to the bakery directly and just wanted a cake w/o placing an order in advance, and they've asked me if I wanted any writing on it.

We've tasted just about every bakery out there (from cupcakes to cakes) and we continue to keep this bakery at the top of our list.

Updated review","My favorite chocolate cake ever is from here, the Brooklyn Blackout. It's moist, stays delicious days after being in the fridge, and has a deep chocolatey flavor. The reason why I'm giving this place such a low rating though is because aside from the Brooklyn blackout.. all the other cakes are just not good. I've tried multiple cakes from here, from the red velvet, to the carrot, and even the yellow cake with chocolate frosting. The best one had to be the Brooklyn black out. The red velvet was really dry, the carrot was not very memorable, and the yellow cake with chocolate frosting wasn't bad. The yellow cake was pretty good but I swear the chocolate frosting tastes like it's from those supermarket jar stuff. Too sweet and artificial tasting! If I were to go back, i would come back here for only one thing!",2,,2
177,Catherine C.,"New York, NY",231,133,171,4.0,3/27/2018,"I got two things to try: Plain cheesecake and the Brooklyn Blackout cupcake.The cheesecake was BOMB. It was fluffy but rich. I was starving and was able to finish the whole slice, But for the good of your body and my future reference, it's probably best split between two indulgences. And yes, future reference because I will be back to pick it up in the future! Cupcake: Underwhelming, and too sweet. Sure it's better than a grocery store cupcake, but as someone who is not really into cupcakes and find other desserts much better, this one didn't do a good job of persuading me I need anymore in my life. Like, I would still rather have a brownie than this. The line is incredibly long but fortunately not out the door, because it loops on the inside haha. Be sure to ask for end of line when you get in, it will not always be at the door, because of the loop, haha!",,,1

180,Mitch M.,"New York, NY",592,6,0,5.0,3/9/2018,"The best cheesecake in New York City! Two Little Red Hens are probably better known for their cupcakes and cakes, but my girlfriend and I go here at LEAST once a week to treat ourselves to some delicious cheesecake with fresh cherries.The cake is rich and fluffy, and not overly sweet. The crust is the real winner though, and definitely seems like a brown sugar/graham cracker mix, baked to perfection. The cherries add a tartness that further enhances the cheesecake's flavors and adds an endearing sweetness.I'm basically writing this review specifically about the cheesecake, because it's that amazingly good. I'll let other reviewers talk about how incredible the cupcakes are - but the one additional thing I'd like to recognize is how friendly and professional the staff are! Everyone working there is patient and kind, ready to answer any questions and aware of everything going on behind the scenes at Two Little Red Hens.PRO TIP: If you only see plain cheesecakes behind the counter, you can always inquire about them and someone will check for you in the back.",1,,

Wasn't disappointed in the end.I will say that the cupcake is good. However, there might just be a little bit TOO much chocolate. Not only is the cake chocolate flavor and is there chocolate flavored drizzle and frosting on the top, but there is also chocolate on the inside of the cupcake as well! Not only did I feel like this is a little too much, but also makes things a little more messy than they need to be, since it kind of comes bursting out, which was a big surprise for me and my kitchen floor.

As I sat waiting for a friend, I watched countless people pay $$$ for cakes that were customized on the spot, so the cakes must be really good!I wanted to try the cupcakes, since I heard that is what they are known for, but those are not available until after 11am. I did have the cherry almond scone and the cinnamon roll.  The cinnamon roll was good, better than most, but still not the best. The scone, however, was perfect, and the cherry almond flavor was the perfect summer/Fall transition flavor.
