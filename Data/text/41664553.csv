However, once I decided to just walk into this sign-less establishment, things went up from there. :)I got the Pad See Yue and it was delicious. The noodles and Chinese broccoli were very fresh and the sauce was clean.The music was a bit too loud, but besides that, I enjoyed my lunch here.Also, they do take credit cards now.",

The prices were fairly decent for the portion sizes you get. The food was good and tasty. We ordered the pork green curry, the pork fried rice, the chicken rolls and all of that was really good. The service, was a bit bland. No interaction, no walkthrough of the menu, etc. Come here for the food and not the service.",
3,,7/8/2018,154,,"Brooklyn, NY",Kateria N.,46,3.0,109,"The Thai people are known for seasoning some food but this place must have lost the memo. There is no honor in serving the tofu eaters a dish like the one pictured here. They did absolutely nothing to make this taste good. It's almost like the scarecrow of dishes at this place; saying ""don't come any closer you vegans"". Why do they think they can serve this and get away with it?They took a block of tofu, cut it up, and deep fried it (probably in pork oil). No seasonings whatsoever. The name should have warned me Tofu Tod. What is that? The nickname for some kid in Thailand that was bullied because he liked Tofu? Ugh!!Don't get it and be wary of other dishes containing unseasoned flavorless tofu. Bye.",1

7,,6/28/2018,4,,"Manhattan, NY",Kimberly G.,21,4.0,74,This place is super laid back. The menu is extensive. There are actually multiple menus and so much to choose from. Everything tastes delicious and flavorful. They have so many options that everyone can find something they like. The staff was good enough and got the job done. The prices are resonable. If you like Thai food this place is a must try.,
8,1,1/1/2018,400,,"Brooklyn, NY",Diana T.,256,4.0,135,Sister chain of Joya. Food is pretty decent for Thai food in Brooklyn. Probably the closest to real Thai food. This place is cash only. It's also pretty easy to miss as the restaurants name is not even on the restaurant!,2
9,,10/14/2018,1,,"Brooklyn, NY",Malika B.,0,1.0,6,Please be mindful of this establishment ! Very shocked and disappointed! Biggest issue and major concern is they are committing fraud with acceptance of card payments... on 2 separate occasions the food was paid for by card ..On the first visit a tip was left via the credit card and they changed the tip amount to a higher amount and submitted to the bank..on the second visit my niece and I split the bill via credit card and we left a generous cash tip and they inserted tip amounts on both cards after the fact and submitted to the bank !!!This is illegal folks !!! Have already disputed with the bank and reported this business !As for the food it isn't that good..and the service is less than stellar.. server rushes you to order and is very unfriendly and doesn't check on you to see if anything else is needed...I have eaten there several times in the past and paid cash.,

I just started working in Fort Greene, so of course I had to come to National for lunch. Their lunch special is enticing and cheap, but the quality of the food leaves a lot to be desired. I had a summer roll, which was just ok, and chicken pad see ew. It was slimy, sweet, and the chicken had a texture I didn't care for.The staff doesn't seem to care, and I had to stand up and find someone to get me the check. In reference to all the cash only reviews, they took my credit card, no problem, so maybe that's changed.I won't be back.",1
12,,9/9/2018,33,,"Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, NY",Kimberly E.,3,2.0,34,"My husband and I were strolling pass this restaurant and it smelled delicious. We ordered the summer rolls from the handwritten specials menu. Unfortunately it was the first Thai restaurant that I have ever been to that somehow messed up this simple dish. For dinner we had the Pan-gang curry and a spicy fried chicken salad. Curry was delicious but the ensemble of the salad was confusing and left much to be desired. The vibe inside was great and it was a great night, nice drinks. Likely won't visit again, but they did have great prices.",
13,1,8/14/2018,202,,"Brooklyn, NY",Gina P.,71,5.0,40,"As soon as I stepped foot into this restaurant, I knew that the food was going to be good. It just smelled so legit and of course I was right :D The shrimp and mango summer rolls was an excellent choice because it was very refreshing and tasty. As an avid spicy food eater (who had been deprived of hot sauce that day), I just had to order the beef pad thai extra extra spicy. The pad thai was everything it needed to be: flavorful, delicious, satisfying, and a good size. However, it was not as spicy as I expected. Then, the waitress brought me a spice rack that essentially changed my dining experience there. On the rack, there were 4 different types of peppers, one that was clearly housemade and it was PERFECT. I loved that they offer the spice rack as an option for people to customize their dish according to their tolerance. My boyfriend ordered the spicy noodle and he enjoyed it as well. The restaurant has outdoor seating, but we dined inside that day because it was raining. Amazing food and good service, so I'll definitely be visiting again!",1

15,,3/16/2018,2,,"Brooklyn, NY",High Standard S.,1,1.0,86,"For years, this place has felt pretentious and the service has been decidedly rude. Neither me nor my friends felt welcome here. As others wrote, tables are jammed too tightly into the space. Reviewer ""Treatmelike A"" left out of his review that he threw his plate of food onto floor, smashing it and splashing food all over neighboring patrons, causing a crazy hostile scene. He won't return becuase the restaurant would never have him back.",1
16,,8/8/2018,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Sherika G.,23,3.0,29,"I've never actually dine in here, just did take out. The first time I came I had the spicy shrimp pad see eww. The taste wasn't bad, but for some reason it felt kind've heavy on the tongue and left a weird after taste. The second time I came I ordered the chicken pad Thai, which was really good. The food here isn't expensive and you get a lot, i wasn't able to finish both dishes. I'll come back since it's near my job, but isn't my first choice when I'm having a Thai food craving.",
17,,8/3/2017,219,,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",Karsten V.,194,3.0,107,"As it's more conveniently located to my residence than Joya is, I've been coming to National for years. It's a straight shot to Atlantic and then a two blocks away. Never had a bad time here until yesterday....This place used to be better. It is a great spot for a quick date night, as the food is delicious (per Joya standard), but the service last night was where i deducted stars. We were seated, put in our drink orders and had to wait about 10-15 mins for them to come to come to the table. It's like we were forgotten. The place wasn't that busy, so it's not like there was a reason for this. Joya is bigger and was busier on the Friday night that i went, and the service was still better.The food was great as always, but i can't stand unnecessarily slow service. I'll probably stick to takeout since this is one of the better Thai options near me.",1

The ambience is great, felt very pleasant. The food was on another level! The portion sizes are decently big. The appetizers are great to share amongst a table.

The prices have gone up than what you see online ($9.95), but we had no complaints because the portions were sizeable and made with good quality ingredients. We scarfed down our food. The pad see yue is one of the better ones that I've  had. I like that the greens they used were Chinese broccoli. The spicy noodles were not spicy at all, but they were delicious. There's no lunch special and they now accept credit cards.",4

At all.I ordered a lunch set that came with:- starter - choose between a few options (house salad, mango salad, soup) and I chose the tom yum soup- main - vegetarian pad see eowThe tom yum was sad. A sight of onion slices and mushrooms swimming in oil speckled broth.Non spicy, unsavory broth that was bland and unappetizing. No zing of lime, no lemon grass flavor. Mushrooms in the soup were undercooked.. perhaps this was toned down for the American palate, I thought. The pad see eow was a monumental fail.Nothing reminiscent of those in Thailand or even rest of NYC! It was more like thick rice noodles fried with Asian black sweet sauce. Zero flavor, super oily. The upsides (thus 2 stars) were that my noodles had quite a lot of tofu pieces and the price was pretty reasonable for a starter and main for lunch. Service was also prompt and nice but... Otherwise, never again ):",

Every meal I've had here has been great and they always have plenty of options and specials to choose from. I normally skip out on dessert here but I recently tried the fried ice cream and it was a hit with my friends. Their spicy chicken basil dish is my fave with the right amount of heat, vegetable and enough rice to go around.",3

The service is good and the ambiance is nice. But the food is always too salty and just not tasty. Last night I ordered beef with broccoli but had to send it back because the meat was over cooked and as tough as shoe leather. My friend had the Pad Thai and it came out burnt! The spare ribs  we had for our appetizer only came to life once we doused them in peanut sauce. One thing I did thoroughly enjoy was my cocktail. I ordered a cosmo and it was delectable,  citrusy  and strong. I had two. They were the best part of the meal. I think that they're always so busy 'cuz the location is fantastic and I am unaware of another Thai restaurant in the area. I would definitely go back for drinks, and maybe an appetizer if I was starving, but not for a meal.",

35,,2/18/2018,118,,"Brooklyn, NY",Lori K.,0,2.0,9,"Service was fine; food was like if your college roommate wanted to try cooking Thai food for the first time. I've worked in a few Thai restaurants before and eat Thai food very often and the pad see ew was just not good, though I ordered it thinking ""hard to mess this one up"" after reading some sub-par reviews. It inexplicably came with a lemon (which is the first time I've ever seen it served that way--soy sauce and lemon don't really mix) and it was over-seasoned with garlic yet under-seasoned with soy sauce, which might explain why other people complain about the bland taste. The lighting in there erred on the side of being too dark to read the menu and the bad ventilation in there means you're smothered by the smell of smoky stir fry. Would recommend trying Nourish in Prospect Heights or Born on Flatbush over this any day.",
36,,5/13/2017,5,,"Manhattan, NY",Mike M.,0,5.0,12,"This place reestablished my love for Thai cuisine. They make these chicken curry puffs (think Thai empanadas), that I had to re-order at the end of my meal. Yes, to take home, after I had eaten one whole puff and a full meal. I ate them later. Don't judge me till you've tried it.Of course we had other items from the menu... Green coconut curry with chicken and vegetables... glass noodles with veg. All were really great and came out quickly.  It's no wonder the place was packed the whole time we were there.",1
37,,5/26/2017,106,2,"Brooklyn, NY",Michael S.,0,1.0,6,"I had ordered from this restaurant in the past and the quality has definitely deteriorated. I order the fresh thai rolls and kaang nuur, sliced beef with eggplant, zucchini, bamboo shoots, peppers & carrots in a red coconut curry sauce.Thai rolls were bland and not fresh. Its clear these are prepared earlier then just sit there until someone orders them. The beef was very tough and there were fewer than 5-6 small pieces of beef in the entire curry.When I called I told the lady that I had been pleased with the quality before. She said that the beef should be tough and overcooked. That's the way its prepared. I have been to Thailand and have eaten at many Thai restaurants in the city.  This dish is not prepared this way and the quality of the beed is inferior. I would avoid this restaurant.",

Updated review",197,2,"Brooklyn, NY",Fazeela S.,348,2.0,338,"My first Yelp obituary:My past 4 trips to National have become increasingly more disheartening upon each bite. I am sad to let it go. Their quality and flavor has exponentially decreased (read: jumbo shrimp has been replaced with minute shrimp that can barely be seen). The food is rarely spicy even if you ask for it spicy. They skimp on vegetables and protein and overdo the noodles, rice, green peppers, and especially onions. They were amazing when they opened a few years ago. I added a star for nostalgia. I will have pings of memories of their yesteryear when I find my new local Thai spot.",4

As other reviewers have mentioned, the quality of the food has dwindled just a bit in the last year, but the portions you get can't be beat for the price you pay. I love their curry puffs, tom ka gai (coconut soup w/ chicken & mushrooms), and pad see ew. The staff there is also a huge reason why I keep coming back. They've always been very friendly and efficient. Many of the wait staff recognize the regulars. It seems to be a pretty popular dinner date spot. The space isn't the biggest, so expect a short wait on weekend (and some weekday) evenings. It's also cash only so be prepared!",1

Pretty sure they forgot our corn on the cob appetizer, and after almost half an hour of us staring hungrily at everyone else being served (people who had been seated after us), I saw our waiter peep over at our empty table and then run panicked into the kitchen... they forgot us. They brought out our corn, but not our other appetizer dish.  It was a long amount of time in between as well until our entrees (and appetizer noodle dish) came out... One slip up I can absolutely forgive, however we had ordered a vegetarian noodle dish and found chicken at the bottom of the plate. Being a vegetarian- I was very upset that I had potentially been eating chicken remnants from someone else's meal that had been left in the skillet. They also forgot to bring brown rice as I had ordered it, and never even offered to refill our drinks. While the food was the great quality we expect from Joya, the service was so subpar, we will not be going back. Food is five star, but service is far from it.",3

Last night I went with a friend and we each got tom ka gai soup to start. It came in medium sized bowls with lots of mushrooms and chicken. We also had veggie spring rolls to share. She got the pad thai and I got the massaman curry. The spring rolls were good with lots of clear noodles inside. Unfortunately, I was full by the time I started eating my curry, but it was delicious! Lots of yummy chicken and potatoes, and a big portion! I'm looking forward to lunch today!The restaurant is small, with a lot of seating and a bit loud, but service was great and efficient.

It was the biggest mistake I have made in some time. First, I called to place an order and after being place on hold for 10 minutes, they hung up the phone. I called back and it took another several minutes for them to pick up. ( this should have been a sign for me). Finally, I got to place my order of Pad Thai noodles with shrimps and fired rice with chicken, an easy order, you would think. This was the most disgusting food I have ever had period! The noodles and the shrimp were tasteless and the rice instead of being fired was so gummy, gummy, gummy that it seemed like it was glued together. It was a very disappointing meal so disappointing in fact that I am going back to National today to return the food and hope I get a refund. It was really that bad. National Thai food not so good.

They're a great Brooklyn band with a fresh sound and tight percussio--- oh wait, I'm not reviewing the band, am I?So I'm reviewing National, the Fort Greene sister of Song and Joya. Let me just say that service here is quick. Almost too quick. They turn tables around like nobody's business (I guess it's their business), so don't be alarmed if there's a wait at the door (doubly so if you're a small party).Food is cheap cheap cheap, but also good good good. Noodle and rice dishes start around $8 and beers are $4 a bottle. Not bad at all, considering it's cash only.I had the seafood and mussels in red curry over noodles. It came with tail-on shrimp, calamari and some veggies. The red curry was surprisingly (and delightfully) spicy. It wasn't a particularly well-balanced meal, but I liked it nonetheless.Kitchen service is super quick. We skipped appetizers because we were in a rush, and we were able to finish our meal in less than half an hour, which is amazing. We didn't even have to rush while eating because the food came so quickly. I liken Thai food to Mexican food in that most of the dishes are the same ingredients; you just have to know how to put them together.

Siesta/kitchen closing time at 3pm (ummm yeah, I didn't know about that either) and they were okay to take a to go order (there was someone there who had just got their food with a wild little kid).  Maybe it was the dry, nonchalant, pretentious attitude of the counter people when I approached with a smile and a question about lunch specials or the response when i took out my debit card.  Which ever it was, I'm not too sure but a star was lost.....  next, I'm told that they only take cash.  No options, I had to ask where the nearest atm was.  Next door and a pointing finger was the response.  So I went to a seedy freestanding machine that I'm afraid might have sold my info somewhere far far away.  I come back to pay, again still smiling because they are handling my food.  What did I get? Blank stare, my change on the counter, and a cool walk away from the counter.

I open the bag, noodles separate, check.  Soup broth smelling delicious, check.  Chopsticks and spoon, check.  Shrimp and calamari fresh and cooked proper, negative.  The seafood smelled super fishy and was like crustacean jerky!  Plus the shrimps are now like half the size than before.  That was the final straw.... i will not be returning, I was so irritated I forgot to get tea.  Oh well, no more nouveau, millineal faux, Spice wannabes for me.  I found a real Thai place in Queens (Thailand Kitchen) who has gained a new customer with their polite demeanor and delicious Thai tea.

It's so close to my work which makes it really convenient for take out or if I wanna go with friends during my break or after hours. The space is relatively small yet welcoming. They have some pretty non-traditional decor which makes the atmosphere unique and modern looking. I know it's posted everywhere, but cash only people. (I believe there is an ATM right next door FYI.) Their lunch specials are good so if you're looking for a quick bite, get there early to avoid the crowds. Lunch special $10 includes an app + an entree from their regular menu. I love that! There's not as many restrictions unlike other restaurants that essentially only have pad thai, pad see yu, lad nar and green curry for offerings. I mean don't get me wrong, they're all stellar choices but sometimes I need more options. Their Thai Peanut Salad is HUGE. They give you a nice serving of mixed greens, shredded carrots, grilled tofu and delicious thick peanut dressing. I could have this as a meal alone. I also ordered the Spicy Noodle (extra spicy) which was great. Thick broad noodles with egg, peppers, onions and tons of spice. Yum. Again, the portions are really big so unless you're starving... expect to take some of it home. I've had quite a bit from their menu.

That's personal, hire more staff. My food tasted good hence three stars. Also the manager/ owner lady did try to make up for it by being super nice.

There are four outside seats that were all taken and we sat inside and the AIR WAS OFF. OK it's a small soon to be sweltering restaurant.  We ordered snapper, which was fried well and had a mango salad on top. However, it is as if the two meals were done separately. The mango salad had a pickled taste to it -- which was tasty -- but it was not related at all to the fish. The fish also had not been fileted, so it was filled with bones -- which were hidden by the fried outside. Again, it was not terrible, just not well executed. (Snapper can be fileted easy enough.)The Tom Kha Gai was very good. I'd recommend that by itself. Also, it's BYOB, and has a very small wine and beer menu as a result.This isn't the best thai food I've had -- Sripraphai in Woodside still holds the crown and this isn't close -- but I am holding out hope that this restaurant was having a bad day.

He then went to stand at the counter and continued to not do anything. Our food came out fast. The spicy noodles weren't anything to write home about. They weren't spicy at all, but it was ok. We had to go through hell to get someone's attention again. The staff was clearly ignoring us. I saw the same dude that was standing at the corner glance at our table and quickly glance away when we tried I get his attention. We just wanted more water! Our server comes back, we ask for more water and I see him go to one of he girls (one of the girls on her phone during their rush) at the counter, and she immediately looks at our table and rolls her eyes making it clear that he was talking about us. At the end of the meal, I advise him to talk sh-t about the customers where they can't see him and to tell his fellow coworker that I saw her roll her eyes at our table. We were NOT high maintenance. Attending to what we need if your effing job! After I called him out, he still didn't offer an apology or a discount or free dessert or anything of the sort. I will not be back here. There are so many other great (not that their food was great by any means) Thai restaurants in the city. Take your money elsewhere.",2

There were so many menu items to choose from that I didn't know what to choose. My co-worker told me to try the Pad Thai and so I did.The restaurant had  limited choices in Pad Thai. They only had chicken, mixed vegetables, and shrimp. I decided to order the mixed vegetables Pad Thai. In addition, I ordered the Thai Iced Tea.  The order arrived within 20-25 minutes.The Pad Thai was below standards, it wasn't tasty at all. The noodles weren't even cooked to the typical color of Pad Thai. Pad Thai is suppose to be a golden brown color, but this Pad Thai was whitish. The vegetables weren't that great either. The broccolli was an ugly green and it just wasn't appetizing at all.The Thai Iced Tea tasted great and came in a medium size cup for $2.00, not bad.I don't think I will come to National to experience the restaurant and I'm not even sure if I want to order from here anymore, knowing the quality isn't great.",

The food was excellent but our waitress was so clueless and seemingly disinterested in us that I had to write this review. We had hardly sat down when she came over to ask if we were ready to order - we were not but we did order beverages, two wines and a soda. We also asked a question about one of the apps. She continued to stand at our table waiting for a food order until my wife told her we needed more time to decide on our food. The two wines were delivered along with, surprisingly, the app we had only asked a question about, not actually ordered. Since we had decided by then to order said app we didn't say anything but did remind her about the soda.When she came back with the soda we ordered the rest of our meal.When the entrees arrived the multiple members of the waitstaff seemed completely confused about what we had ordered, never mind who had ordered what. Only two of the four dishes they brought were correct and we stated so. They then came back with three more entrees, only one of which we had ordered, but given that we had a show to get too we just accepted a second entree.We also ordered another glass of wine. However, that order took forever to be fulfilled. I had wanted to order a second glass of wine myself but the delay in the entrees and the first wine reorder made me skip the second glass.As stated originally, the food was excellent but the waitress - a petite female who was either Asian or Hispanic - was awful.

If you come here on a Saturday night, they got the music pumping a bit loud and will be hard to hear anyone you are eating with. Come here at other times and they'll be playing some good tunes at a lower decibel level. What's different between this Song or Joya, just the location really.

My friend met me at the restaurant and got our table. I came in 5 minutes later. The waiter came by and took our order for an appetizer. After we ate our appetizer, our waiter came back to take our order- a ""white"" man came up to us and told my friend and I that because we have been there for 2 hours he would not serve us because he needed the table. We were so confused and dumbfounded. My friend explained that we had not been there for 2 hours (actually 20 minutes). He (the white man) then said ""hunnie you have been here since I have been here at 12 pm- and she (looking at me) came in because you were waiting for her. I need this table because i have a party of 12 coming and we need this space."" He then looked at the waiter and said ""I need this table they need to move now!"" The waitress was mortified , my friend and  I were appalled. The waitress said that we could have another table. My friend asked ""who are you?!?"" He then stated ""I am one of the owners!"" I kindly excused myself and left. My friend was polite enough to pay. I have never been treated in such a way. We are regulars at this restaurant and apparently the ""regular"" crew was not present. I will definitely NOT be going back there- and all my friends that live and work in that area will NOT be patronizing a racist establishment where ALL African Americans look the same. Apparently we looked just like the two Black women that were sitting and eating beside us. They had just left about 10 minutes after we got our appetizer. It's okay- they just want get my coins....and the food was horrible today.   Such negativity going into the food is NEVER a good thing....Good night good folk. Eat well Live Long",16

Why is it so hard to find a half-way decent Thai in this area?!Although the food was edible,  it was bland at best, and downright unpleasant at worst. It felt sloppy and rushed. Where's the love, guys?For specifics - the beef in my husband's grilled beef salad was chewy and none too fresh - slightly funky aftertaste. Also the Thai vinaigrette was overly-sweet. A good Thai salad lives and dies by the freshness and liveliness of its ingredients, and sadly the beef let this one down big time.My ""Fresh Thai Summer Roll"" actually was pretty fresh, and nicely-made - but pretty bland. It was crying out for some tangy sweet chili sauce to bring it to life! Instead I got a dollop of weird mustard. Nope, wasn't working! Then for an entree I had the Koong Pad Khing  (sauteed shrimp). Although the ginger sauce was OK, the shrimp were way overcooked, like little bullets, and there was the strangest taste to the broccoli... like liver or something! How on earth do you make broccoli in ginger sauce taste like offal?! Amazing!Husband had the beef panang curry. ""Mediocre"" was his verdict.So yeah, won't be trying that one again I'm afraid.

A good friend put me on to this little hole in the wall spot that anyone would just walk past without looking at twice. But between the quality of food, the prices, and the atmosphere you can't go wrong.Had a really cool waiter who was extremely helpful. Im not very familiar with Thai dishes and reading the menu was like translating ancient scripture. But he was able to explain everything to me in detail, no problem.My friend and I had 2 appetizers 2 entrees and she had a soda while I had a water. Keep in mind, these aren't small portions... Im 6'5 220, but I couldn't finish my Drunken Noodles. What was the damage? 22 BUCKS! Cant beat that, especially in downtown Brooklyn where you have to put chicken wings on a lay away plan.Afterwards my friend and I just relaxed right in the restaurant and had a conversation for almost 2 hours. No hassle from anyone either, in fact the waiter kept filling my glass with water way after the check was paid. The ambiance is pretty nice though. The restaurant has a bit of a lounge feel to it with the dim lighting and you can easily find yourself getting a little too comfortable.The food did take a bit longer than i'd like, and I was really frustrated because I didn't know what I was getting into. But once it came and everything else went smooth it was all good. This is like a spontaneous ""hey, you wanna grab something to eat"" type spot.

I called National for a pick up around  2:30pm (on a Tuesday). Because of the severe cold I decided to wait for the C train instead of walking. It took me about twenty five minutes to get to the restaurant.When I did get there, I smiled at the woman standing at the register. What I received in return was something closer to ""the finger"". This young woman shot me a dirty look, then turned to her male coworker to say something in what was possibly Thai.She was clearly annoyed with me. Obviously I have no idea what she was saying about me, but she was clearly talking about me. Alright, your customer takes a little longer than you expect to pick up their food.. Is this the first time this has happened?? And your reaction is to stare daggers at them and talk crap about them in your language? I ordered this lunch for me and my girlfriend who was home sick, so I did not walk out as I should have. When I handed her the money, she snatched it and then shoved my change back into my hand. The smug look of satisfaction on her face made it crystal clear this was about more  than me taking too long. I understand that people who get their kicks out of treating people this way usually feel quite small themselves. Still, that's no real consolation.After taking the food to my girlfriend, I came back to speak to a manager. I explained to this woman that her treatment was ridiculous. She couldn't have cared less. The same arrogant attitude she showed me earlier, was the same one she had when I came back to complain. She didn't care that I wanted to talk to the manger, because she is the manger. I was also told by her co-workers that they all own and run National together. It would make sense that it's a family run establishment.I have supported ""Joya""in Cobble Hill for years, but may not anymore due to it's connection to ""National"". Business proprietors who don't see their customers as human beings, should see less of those human beings in their establishments.Oh, and on top of all of that, the food is just fair.",3

I also got a shrimp salad, and although I wish the shrimp was a little warmer, it was tasty nonetheless. But the soup was the winner for me, and it was so big that I couldn't finish it. When I woke up this morning paying for last night's debauchery, all I could think about was that Chicken Noodle soup and how I wished I had taken the rest home.

The soup was yummy as always. HOWEVER, the usually cozy red curry was anything but! The heat (spice) of the red curry was ABSENT as was the usually creamy texture. Not only was the spice missing the curry sauce was WATERY!!When I entered the restaurant I saw that their grade was pending! It couldn't be; the standards at National subpar!? I should have heeded the sign. I will, of course, give my beloved National a chance to redeem themselves. The chance could have been today, but it was just too soon.

I'm amazed I didn't lose my teeth digging into the meat, yes, it was that tough! The meat felt like a piece of leather. And absolutely no flavor.. Had to ask for hot sauce and even then it was lack luster. Complained to the wait staff about it & they asked if they could change it for me half way through the meal. Thought they would at least reduce the charge of the rice to half? But nothing.. Charged us full price. That's pretty sad service for a new restaurant that's pending grading!",

The sauce is not too sweet or salty, and they give a fairly generous portion of broccoli. My partner has ordered the different curries with beef, eggplant and chicken, and they've all been excellent.

It seems snobbish to complain about little things but since most restaurants do this well the glaring difference cannot be ignored. The food and prices were great though. We had a pad thai spring roll appetizer, pad thai entree and coconut curry with chicken and broccoli entree. The pad thai was the usual which is fine. I'm not expecting some genius remix, just well done favorites. The coconut curry was very good. Could have been a bit thicker but the light flavor matched it. Perhaps just a bowl vs. flat plate would have helped but the food was very good.

Updated review",0,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Sha M.,3,1.0,21,"I will no longer be going to or ordering from National. Sucks cause they're literally around the corner from my apt so it's quick and convenient though not the best thai (just regular) but after my last visit... I brought one of my friends there who had never had thai food. I ordered the salmon fillet with grilled veggies  over pad thai. When it came it had eggplant (which is a veggie that is usually specified in the menu because it's not a common veggie). I explained to the waitress that I am DEATHLY allergic (my throat closes up and I go into shock and may stop breathing and die type of allergic) to eggplant and asked her to please explain this to the chef so that I get one with absolutely no eggplant in it. She comes back with my order 5 minutes later. This was not a regular pad thai and included grilled salmon so I highly doubted they could have cooked and plated another one so quickly. My friend thought the same so we called her back and I asked ""is this the same plate I gave you?"" She didn't respond. I re-asked the question and she goes ""oh, but I took off the eggplant"". I was floored and pretty pissed at this point but tried to remain calm because I didn't want to ruin the experience for my friends and other diners so I AGAIN explained to her that I cannot eat anything that eggplant has touched ""When I said deathly allergic I meant my lungs will stop working, ambulances will show up and your restaurant will most likely get sued."" So she goes  ""oh!"" takes the plate and leaves. Didn't come back to give me options and NEVER APOLOGIZED. Being a good dinner companion, I actually went up to the counter and asked that they just change my order to a super fast shrimp pad thai (they always have some ready) so that my friend wouldn't have to wait for me. We ate, paid (no discount was suggested and I was so over it I didn't care) and left. My friend had his first (albeit hairy) thai experience and commended me for not just walking out after they tried to serve me the same plate. I told him I didn't want to ruin his meal, but trust that NATIONAL will NEVER see me again. Sucks for them because I live in the neighborhood and used to bring people there all the time as well as order for take-out and delivery.NOTE TO OWNER: When you have restaurants, you cannot take allergies lightly and try to trick your customers because you will harm them. Teach that to your employees and teach them proper customer service. I couldn't dismissed this as a random incident and still frequent your restaurant if 1. she had been apologetic 2. she didn't try to re-serve the same plate 3. she had offered an alternative and discount.

192,,3/8/2011,278,,"Brooklyn, NY",Maria M.,373,4.0,464,"I love National.  I've been here several times with my boyfriend.  We usually get the broad noodles and then get another dish to share.  The noodles are definitely my favorite choice here, though I was disappointed to find the spicy basil noodles were not very spicy at all.  They were tasty, but not hot at all.  I remedied that with an array of chili sauces (you have to ask).  I also tried and really enjoyed the fried tofu with a delicious spicy tamarind sauce.  The fried calamari is also tasty, and the ""small"" portion is plentiful!  I highly recommend National as a local, cheap, tasty food option.  National is good for dates and friends alike, just make sure to bring your own bottle if you want a drink.",
193,,6/7/2013,3,,"Lyndhurst, NJ",Kevin S.,0,5.0,18,"Unbelievable.  Two entrees and an appetizer for $23?  That's unheard of for me.  I started with a mango salad (for $4.95), and it was a very sizable appetizer with fresh mango, lettuce, and peanuts, with a tasty dressing drizzled over it.  It was aesthetically pleasing and a delicious first plate.  Then I had the beef in a red curry coconut broth ($8.95), while my friend had the same dish only with chicken ($7.95).  We could not believe how much food we received for such an inexpensive price, and we were even more pleased with the taste of the dishes.  This is some of the best Thai I've ever had.  I cannot wait to return.Also, our server was very kind and the outdoor seating was a nice surprise on a beautiful evening in Brooklyn.",
194,,1/22/2014,6,,"Eugene, OR",Bruce N.,2,3.0,26,"Lots good to say about this place, but the food for the most part was average and my only reason for trying it was attendance at a BAM show.  The interior was nice, the staff super-nice and attentive, but the food was no different than you could find in dozens of Thai places.  I liked that they made my Som Tum ""Thai"" spicy vs NYC spicy at my request, but Som Tum usually ground peanuts in it.  Mine didn't.  Fighting a cold, I had the chicken noodle soup.  Nothing really Thai about it, but it was OK.  My wife went with a Panang curry that was tasty but, again, pretty average within its genre.  I see this as more of a decent neighborhood place and not a destination restaurant.  Prices extremely reasonable and for that I'd give an extra 1/2 star if I could..",
195,,5/3/2014,366,,"Brooklyn, NY",veranda b.,19,1.0,62,"We didn't even get to eat because the owner was so rude. When we walked in, there was no hostess.  We scanned the room and after a minute we wandered to the only a available 2 top. Some rude man (found out later he's the owner) yelled at us for sitting down. I told him we didn't have to eat there.  He said, no lie. You don't.  So we left. Rude rude rude and crowded for what?",4

197,,4/15/2013,24,,"Staten Island, NY",lauren s.,0,5.0,51,"It's your typical Thai restaurant - great decor, ambiance, food, etc but what stands out most of all are their prices. $10 a meal WITH tax and tip included!The service is super fast so don't expect to hang around too long.",

199,,8/3/2014,44,1,"FLUSHING, NY",David P.,0,3.0,89,"Tried this place a bunch of times because I was working on a construction site nearby. Seating was plentiful with a modern ambiance but I could never eat at the actual restaurant because I was usually covered in mud. The food on the menu did not lack flavor, perhaps a little too much flavor if there is such a thing. I couldn't bring my food in my construction trailer because the strong smells would overwhelm my coworkers. I enjoyed the spicy noodles the most, but most of the time I would feel groggy and parched after my meals. By the second or third time I had gotten food from national, I began to notice that my fried rice and noodles were pretty saturated with oil, and began to look elsewhere for food that wouldn't leave me incapacitate after the meals. Lunch specials are a good deal however, with fresh appetizers.",1
