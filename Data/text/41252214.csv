0,,10/16/2018,673,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Maddie M.,2,5.0,1,"This place is pretty unique because you can come by yourself and relax, come with coworkers for happyhour after work drinks, AND/or with your crew during the weekends to party it up. If you come around 4-7 during the weekdays it's pretty chill and relaxing in there. But I've also came to lazy point on a Thursday around 9 and the place was packed by 10,11 and I had a blast vibin' to the DJ and singing/dancing. They usually have parties there as well which can get super fun! People are always chatting, laughing, or dancing here. Always a good time. Bartenders and owner are super friendly and cater to your needs if you just ask :) Also, I may or may not have fallen in love with the bartender there ;) GO!",
1,,9/28/2018,720,,"Flushing, NY",Daniel F.,1131,2.0,628,"Lazy Point, with an emphasis on the word Lazy.Lighting - Can someone please turn on some lights? It was way too dark inside and I honestly don't think it works with the setting.Less lights do not equal hipper and cooler bar. I'm convinced that the employees just can't find the switch and maybe too lazy to look.Customer Service - Here's the big issue that dropped my review from a 3 star to 2 star. They failed to show that they respect theircustomers on at least 2 separate occasions. 1) We called before coming to the bar. We have some people who may need help getting into the bar via wheelchair ramps or what not. The guy that answered the phone was being a real jerk when we asked about handicap accessibility and really not helpful at all. Instead he asked how many handicap people we're looking to bring. I don't see why that matters. When we asked if there was a lip at the doorway, they said no but when we got there ... of course there was. 2) We actually had a huge party, because the girl that was leaving our company is extremely popular. So it was extremely stuffy inside and we all took frequent breaks outside just to catch some breeze. She kindly asked if they would turn on their AC units, and the guy working the floor had the audacity to tug on her jacket and say ""No, you should take this off instead"". Just terrible handling of the situation. You don't touch your customers! We only wanted to stay longer and not feel nasty doing so. I'm not sure if the ACs wereall broken, if the guy on the phone was the same guy that tugged on her jacket, if they're trying to save money on electricity, or if it's back to my first point the staff is just lazy and in most cases rude. Side note - There was one bartender that I kept ordering from that night which was extremely nice!  Drinks - Their drinks were good but happy hour prices aren't impressive. Can easily go elsewhere for better priced HH a few blocksaway.Food - Price and quality doesn't align. With their $15 (3) fish tacos and their weak $10 grilled cheese. Both lacked any taste, but I'll forgive the chef. It's hard to cook in the dark. They also labeled their French fries on the menu as ""fingerling potato tempura"". Stop trying to make things sound fancier than what they are, it's really false advertising. We also noticed that avocado toast is under ""bar snacks"". This may be getting petty, but in my honest opinion bar snacks should only be bowls of peanuts, chips or pretzels.  Interior - Ok, I actually really like the interior with the blue floors, and the layout of the benches and tables. Looking at Yelp's indoor pictures, this was the reason we picked this venue. Sadly once you get here, you'll notice how tacky the place really is with the ""Live Laugh Love"" Pillows, ""endless summer"" posters, and fake plants and palm trees scattered everywhere. Going back to my first bullet above which works in their favor actually - you can't really see anything once the sun goes down. But seriously - someone help these guys find the switch already.",1

Their fish tacos and spicy chicken sandwich are my personal favorites. This is a great spot for parties or happy hours because its really easy to reserve and you don't need to put down a deposit to reserve space, which is so hard to find in NYC! On the weekends they have amazing dj's so this is a really fun place to go if you're looking for somewhere to dance, but is more low key during weekdays if you're looking for the kind of bar where you can sit down and enjoy a cocktail. Also the bartenders are extremely attractive which never hurts ;)",2
6,1,10/11/2018,325,,"Manhattan, New York, NY",Rashida Z.,0,5.0,1,Definitely the spot to go to when you feel like escaping out of the city. It's cozy clean and refreshing when you walk in. The food is delicious and the staff is extremely friendly! Most importantly the drinks are YUM!,

We were able to get a table and the bartender checked on us often! We got this awesome deal with a burger and a beer for $10! The burger was delicious and the drinks were decent price, especially considering the area that we were at! This would definitely become one of my go-tos after work! Also, bartender is cute!",2

9,2,4/17/2018,150,1,"New York, NY",Ms G.,129,4.0,262,came here with a bunch of friends last minute for happy hour. the raw oysters were surprisingly not bad at all and the fish tacos were actually really good. one of my gfs got. burger and beer special. she consumed that with the quickness. there were about 8 of us but im guessing we came early enough that there was a table available. the cocktails selection was decent. i just stuck to the happy hour menu but all in all we had a good time. tbh i still think about those fish tacos. they were light enough. usually i get fish tacos that are drenched in oil and it feels like my arteries are slowly clogging but i didnt feelthat way about these. i got seconds. worth it.,4
10,2,5/4/2017,12,,"Manhattan, NY",S P.,12,4.0,15,Beach-themed bar. Casual and relaxed. Ate at the bar and staff as very attentive but the service was slower than I would have liked. Food was tasty but portion size was not filling. Burger patty was small albeit delicious (kinda tasted like a Big Mac!) and needed the tempura potatoes to make it filling. The margarita on the rocks with salt was just right. The place seems to fill up arounf 5:20 with the after-work crowd on weekdays. Would definitely come back just because the bar staff was so nice and attentive.,3

Men, do not take women to this bar.A few weeks ago, a group of my coworkers went to this bar for a happy hour. We'd been here before, and it was close enough to our office that it was convenient for a majority of the group.After about 6 hours, two of the women in our group started becoming incoherent, despite only having 2-3 drinks each throughout their time there, having had dinner beforehand, and eating bar snacks (fries and a sandwich) during their visit.Our group believes that their drinks were tampered with by a bar patron, called called Lazy Point to let them know about this, and to request to come in and view security camera footage of the area of the bar they were seated in. Lazy Point did not return phone calls, or multiple e-mails over the course of the last few weeks.Ladies, please avoid this bar at all costs.

14,1,12/19/2016,143,1,"Washington Heights, Manhattan, NY",Josmanuel A.,763,4.0,124,"I was introduced to this place because of the phone app fever. I have to say this place is hidden and is a good spot. I recommend the avocado toast and the Montauk cheeseburger. The drinks I recommend is the margarita which is strong. The Pinot noir hit the spot as well while waiting for some grub. The soundtrack to the place is the highlight. They play a lot of oldies. It's a great place to be with employees for a night after work. It's not a great place for couples on a Friday afternoon. I also feel the lazy fish tacos should be included in the fever package or at least as an item I could buy if it's included in the menu. Beside that the place was not bad. The customer service was good, but it could improve by providing everything in the menu if the price is right.",

16,5,8/24/2015,757,3,"Princeton, NJ",Kevin M.,1561,5.0,900,"Shout out to Yelp on this one. Lazy Point was truly a great find in a part of town where upbeat bars aren't always the norm.Located off the beaten path close to the west side highway, Lazy Point is a fun bar that resembles a beach club. From the decor to the music, you will have a hard time thinking you're not steps away from the ocean.Aside from the atmosphere, the drinks are also excellent. The list of drink specials are creative and the alcohol selection is great. Lots of variety and more than the just the basic version of each spirit (especially rum). They are also very accommodating and seem to be hell bent on doing anything to keep your spirit high. I asked if they made a certain cocktail, which they didn't. So I told the bartender what was in it, and he whipped up his own version on the spot. It turned out to be delicious. That did it for me with this place...This is definitely one of the better bars in the area and one that will undoubtedly do well. Great drinks, jovial atmosphere and awesome music. Perfect.",9

19,3,8/18/2016,505,1,"Brooklyn, NY",Grace S.,187,5.0,119,"So, to be quite honest, I wouldn't have tried Lazy Point if it wasn't for work. My office has booked this location (there are options to book the front/back of the restaurant) and I must say, this is always a personal favorite of mine!! Our office has a lot of off-sites and happy hours, and despite frequenting many other spots, I always cheer a little on the inside when this spot gets booked. Maybe its the native Californian in me speaking, but I love the chill, beachy vibe and it is the perfect summer spot. I feel like I'm at a beach shack or in Montauk by the beach whenever I come by here. S E R V I C E + The service is fantastic and they're always so accommodating, even while handling some of our larger groups of 25+ people. Everyone is friendly and the bartenders also know their stuff and gave us good recommendations on cocktails. + For one of our visits, the office wanted to order food and despite us not flagging ahead of time, they went ahead and served us anyway, making all the bar food friendly for a group our size to pick at. F O O D & D R I N K+ We ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, the fingerling potato tempura, the cheddar grilled cheese and the lemon parmacesan potato chips and they were all DELICIOUS. So good. The grilled cheese was definitely a personal favorite of mine cause I love cheddar and the bread was just so fluffy and crispy. I also loved the ingenious idea of the fingerling potato tempura, it came with chipotle tartar sauce that was amazing, as well. + The wine and beer selection is standard and not too extensive; but they do have a range. Also, one interesting thing I noticed about this bar is that they have wine on tap lol, I've never seen that before but first time for everything. ALL IN ALL...Everything is priced reasonably (considering its area) and I love the ambiance. I somehow always feel refreshed and cooled down (like I'm at the beach!!) whenever I come to this spot...I swear I'm not crazy; its such a relaxing space. So for your next summer spot, instead of going to a rooftop bar where you're going to be sweltering in the heat, come here!!! And if you want a slice of summer any other season, this is your spot. Definitely coming back 100 times over :)",3

We come here all the time after work. Perfect place to bring a co-worker/friend/date. Gunther, the manager, is always friendly and attentive. Nick and Daniel with always put a smile on your face and make sure your drink is full. And the best part is that it is slightly tucked away from the circus/end-of-the-world chaos of areas like Chelsea and the L.E.S.Their house Pistachio Mule with a dozen oysters easily transports you to Montauk... even if it is a freezing NYC evening. It's a hideaway from the pending winter. I always take off my coat and pretend it's a sweaty July or August.A breath of fresh air where every bar is doing the same crap and BECAUSE it doesn't attract a crowd of wild idiots I'd say it is one of the best bars in the area.

The snack menu is simple but satisfying, complete with fish tacos, oysters, and sandwiches (the Grilled Cheese with aged Cheddar is an awesome throwback to your childhood).  The cocktail menu is reasonably priced and will generally put you in your happy place quickly.This place fills up quickly on the weekends, but there usually is ample space to move around.  The crowd is generally young and trendy, but casual (and somewhat wild) enough to make you think you're at the shore.",2

It's run by a dad who is paranoid about damage to the space but is comfortable painting it right before admitting you.

I just wish for a Thursday night (relatively early, like 7pm) the music would've been kept down a little. I felt like the place was a little to ""turnt"" for an evening.

30,1,3/29/2015,6,3,"New York, NY",Tanya F.,4,1.0,41,"I had been a big fan of Anchor Bar (previously in the same space) and enjoyed the great music and dancing many times.  The new owner has done an excellent job redecorating: the dark, lodge, dive-y feel of Anchor Bar has been replaced with bright white walls, picnic tables and beach house feel.  The music is also still great and on point. While this is all excellent, my 1 star rating is not unwarranted ... At a friend's birthday party last night, a girl and one of my friends started dancing on one of the banquets, the owner came over and pretty aggressively pulled them down.  Fine, you have new furniture and you would like it to be maintained, reasonable enough.  However, a few moments afterwards my friend and this same girl were dancing, just dancing!, but a small circle had surrounded them, at which point the owner came over, forcibly moved over the girl and preceded to smack my male friend, IN THE FACE, at least 4-5 times!!!! after which he grabbed his jaw and shook his face!!!!!  It was literally the most innocent, benign fun and the owner did not take kindly to it. Completely out of proportion to the ""offense""! In summary, the place is fine (as many other places in the city are), but if you are assaulting customers, I would confidently say I'm not going to be making a return visit.",15

It started before I even stepped into the bar itself or tried their drinks (which are delicious btw). I was planning a party for 2 friends' birthdays with a guest list of 100+. Believe me, for a guest list that big, it's impossible to find a place that's not over the top, trashy, overcrowded, or expensive. However when I dropped a message in Lazy Point's inquiry section, Jason (the owner) was not only quick to respond, but accommodating in every way. He doesn't believe in minimums or fees, only throwing a good party. I wish every other bar owner had the same values.He reserved the whole back space for our party (our group ended up taking most of the place). The vibe is super laid back and casual. Music, mixed with classic 90s and top 40s, and at a good volume (shoutout to Jeremy the DJ). The drinks were creative, affordable, and fun. Jason not only checked in from time to time, but threw in extra perks that blew us away.. It's rare and amazing that it feels like the bar owner is co-hosting a party with you. Thank you Jason for bringing hospitality back into NYC's bar scene. Lazy Point, welcome to the neighborhood. You got a whole party of people who will be spreading your name.",9

They go ABOVE and beyond to make sure you and all your guests have the most amazing celebration and truly make the night, from welcoming my party with so much enthusiasm at the door to reserving us a table at no charge, complimentary champagne, tending to us so kindly all night long and even hailing us cabs at the end of the night...serisouly, am I at a bar or am I in heaven?! The space is recently renovated and it is beatiful inside, with an expanded dance floor! The overall space is not too large, but the perfect spot for a more initmate party (although by no means small..I think we were about 15-20 people in my group and we had a large table for ourselves and room to dance!) with a DJ in the back and more tables up front and seats at the bar if you don't feel like busting a move. The pace picks up around midnight or so when the bar starts to fill up. The DJ plays hands down the funnest music I have ever heard, with a bit of everything from current hip hop and r&b, the BEST throwbacks and some top 40. I have been here 3 times on a saturday and never left without dancing for at least 3 hours. The bartenders are lovely, drinks are strong, and crowd is friendly and attractive.

Even when the bar got packed, he was still attentive, and brought our drinks over to where we were sitting if he needed a few minutes. Which was another great thing! It was a party in the back, with fun music to dance to, but we hung in the front (I was catching up with a group of friends I hadn't seen in a while), and we were able to sit and chat and hear each other without shouting.

42,1,12/12/2015,12,1,"Indianapolis, IN",J P.,0,1.0,9,"The name of the bar says all. Lazy describes this place perfectly. The cocktail I had was missing at least 50% of the ingredients listed in the description. That only left gin, not Fords as the menu described, but a cheap gin, and lemon. There was so much lemon juice it was like drinking a lemon cleaning product for $14. Many other items listed on the very small menu, they did not have. They were out of most Beers, the gin described in the cocktail ingredients, they had vodka at all. How can you run a bar without those basics? My guess is this place is about to fold and the owners have given up. Don't waste your time or make the mistake of wandering in.",

From the beginning when I emailed them (via their site), they were not only super responsive -- and incredibly fast in getting back to me -- but once we got there, the attention was top-notch. We reserved a little area in the back over by the DJ and we danced all night to fun music -- a good mix of Top 40, classics, hip-hop, some EDM. The decor is lovely, feels like you're in a beachside resort. Thank you Lazy Point for making my friend's birthday one she will never forget. Great cocktails to boot!",3

The place is designed really cool and provides for a fun ambience. The music and cocktails were also excellent. Staff was extremely helpful and hospitable, going over the cocktail menu and making suggestions for me and my date. Top notch staff all around. Definitely will be returning to Lazy Point in the future.",4
45,,11/16/2016,0,,"Brooklyn, NY",Ebony J.,1,2.0,7,VERY rude manager. Great bartender Daniel. Great drinks. I went last night with a friend. We had a voucher. The manager took a menu out of my hand while i was reading it and told me i could not order anything off of that menu. He turned out to be wrong. He later apologized for his attitude and gave us complimentary chips.  And he kept trying to be nice to us. Other people there said he was rude to them too.,

47,,5/14/2016,0,3,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",Sabs K.,0,1.0,1,The bartender is the worst. Im a normal girl at a normal bar and he served drinks to every man before he served me. I spent 45 minutes at the bar and all he did was yell at everyone and get moody and nasty. I told him that ive been waiting more than everyone else and all he did was snap back. I gave up and left the bar because all he did was ignore me.. Awful moody bartender that only attended boys.,2
48,1,3/19/2015,0,,"Greensboro, NC",Mary Ellen L.,0,5.0,7,"What a unique treasure this place is! Tucked away in Hudson Square, this bar feels as though you have stepped off Manhattan and wandered into a little slice of beach life heaven! Such a refreshing vibe in a city filled with bars - this place really stands out. There are white picnic tables illuminated by driftwood chandeliers & candlelight, great music, great crowd. The staff was wonderful, so friendly and accommodating, and eager to please. True hospitality. What a great place this would be to have a party!The cocktail menu is ridiculously creative - mixology at it's best. I tried the Volstead (Reyka Vodka + St. Germaine + Lemon + Strawberry), and the Beets by Dre (Hendrick's Gin, fresh beets, rosemary & lime), both were phenomenal but the Beets drink truly stood out as a mixology masterpiece. The fresh rosemary sprig in the drink added a nice soft flavor that only got better and better towards the bottom of the glass. Genius!I hope to go back soon to sample some of the other bar creations and get my beach vibe on - you should too.",1
49,,9/29/2015,0,,"New York, NY",Dave H.,0,1.0,2,"Lazy is right and super rude bartender.  Ordered some bar bites (fish tacos, tempura potato skins) to split amongst 3 people.  When we asked for sharing plates we were told to use our napkins.  After we pressed on asking for plates she begrudgingly searched for some and as she dropped them off said ""we aren't a restaurant - people use napkins.""  Well guess what we aren't coming back and I wouldn't recommend to anyone.  It's a shame as a lot of big companies are moving in the area but it won't last with service like that.",
50,,3/29/2015,2,2,"Manhattan, NY",Cara B.,0,3.0,5,"Great music, good crowd and fantastic drinks. The owner/manager was a major buzz kill, he was standing on a chair watching the crowd. He also actually had the nerve to pick up my friends purse and try and move it without reason, which was shortly after he told us to check our coats because of security reasons. Didn't realize he was going to be the security concern that we needed to watch for.",2
