Well - so we went to two different bars and tried Guinness before coming here to see if it was really 'different' and were not disappointed ! Oh and yes, try their curried fries while you sip Jameson and ginger ale.",,,
1,Bianca T.,"Boston, MA",137,130,65,1.0,9/2/2018,"Would someone please either fire or retrain the nasty blonde bartender? I came in on Friday at 7 pm ish for drinks and dinner. I sat at the end of the bar and waited 8 plus mins before the bartender even acknowledged me. She was busy messing with her phone. Changing the music and then talking to the waitstaff. I ordered a Manhattan and the nightmare began. She doesn't understand the basics of bar cleanliness or mix techniques. First she drug the GLASS through the ice bin -- she didn't use the tin or ice scoop. Biggest bartender no no! Then she added the liquor to the tin and shakes it with the said glass and rather than using the proper strainer she flipped the same glass in her hand over, inserted it in to the tin and uses it to pour the drink in the martini glass. Sooooo gross!!!!!!! You touch money and filth and then put that in my drink?!?! She put it down in front of me and I couldn't say a word as my jaw was dropped ... in shock of her carelessness, blatant laziness and nasty bar skills. I tried to get her attention for like 10 mins. But she was all over the place, huffing, rolling her eyes and general treating folks at the bar badly. Not to mention she over poured the guy next to me who was weaving and a drink away from falling off the stoll... embarrassing! He was obviously drunk and she continued to serve him!! Terrible!! My friend shows up and when she finally comes over I say very softly (as to not alert others at the bar of her gross preparation of my drink) ... she grabbed the drink of in front of me. Makes a face like she realizes I was aware of her missteps and tossed in anger in the sink ...She said nothing more to me, no apology, no ""can I remark it for you?"" .... I sat stunned for a moment and got up to leave ... So my friend and I went down the street to Another restaurant and had a lovely dinner and several drinks!I hope the owner is reading this because I am super disappointed.. I had been to the Amsterdam gem before but was never treated so poorly!!!Fire her -- she is a liability! The health department would have a field day if they saw the number of indiscretions she manages to do in a matter of mins. I will think twice before I return!It's a shame -- the first time I came in there was a super friendly young guy bartending and the food was delicious!",,1,

My boyfriend's spinach salad with grilled chicken was extremely dry and plain. I ordered boneless chicken wings, which I thought were yummy. We ordered drinks (a mojito and a margarita) which were pretty good. Overall, the experience was average and the price was too much for what they offered.

Then I TRIED to understand (maybe its a stressful day) i walked inside to ask for the cocktail menu and the bald waiter with glasses said we don't have a cocktail menu, then when i insisted he pulled it out of the cabinet next to him. clearly there was no will to serve us. not sure if it was because our race. but it definitely seemed like that. this is the first time i get this level of service. very rude and unprofessional. will NEVER come here again. what a waste of time.

I went in one night, I didn't see a certain kind of beer on tap and asked if they had it in bottle. They didn't, but the bartender actually was convinced they had it. The effort was noticeable. I never forgot it. For an Irish bar, their nachos were SO GOOD! In fact, I talked about them so much for like a year, hubs and I went one night and he didn't even look at the menu - just said nachos since I sold him on it (he's an easy mark lol). Nice people, good eats and solid drinks. Go here. Now.",3,,

The Gate is perfect for a quiet pub where you can visit and watch sports. The menu is mostly comfort food with an Irish American slant. I felt more like I was in someone's living room than a bar. I ordered chicken pot pie. Very tasty on a freezing cold night. My friends ordered the stew, the chicken breast entree. Good portions! The burger looked good too. I'll be back for sure!",1,,
12,Richard Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,16,0,5.0,3/25/2018,"Went in with a group of ten Saturday afternoon. Food was very good and the service was fantastic.

14,Katharine S.,"Arlington, VA",352,588,461,3.0,1/21/2016,"Nice ambiance. I like that this place had a bar/pub vibe, but they also had someone to seat people. Exactly what my friend and I were looking for. I ordered the Mallager Mule (ginger beer and Jameson) and it was very good ($10)We shared an order of calamari, which was crispy and tasty. It came with a sweet/spicy chili sauce that was perfect. Very happy with the calamari ($13)As an entree, I had the turkey sandwich. It was pretty good. My only complaint was that the bread tasted very cheap. Blah. It came with lettuce, bacon, mayo, and avocado. The turkey was good. Generous portions. It also came with fries - these were typical fries. No seasoning or anything original about them ($13)Service was below average. No one asked us how our food or drinks were. No one asked if we wanted dessert or anything else. Meh. Bill came to about $33. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but it wasn't a bad experience by any means, either.",4,1,1

16,RhodeRick M.,"Brooklyn, NY",87,6,1,4.0,5/29/2017,Fantastic organic food. The chicken pot pie has larger pieces of veggies and real chicken chunks that filled the bowl. The staff is very friendly with the Irish Pub laid back feel. This is truly a great find.,2,,
17,Patricia O.,"Manhattan, NY",2,43,2,1.0,1/13/2018,"Had absolutely tasteless, overdone burger (well done; had asked for medium rare; part of the bun was burned on the outside, they don't toast the inside), and the fried were tepid and also tasteless. Service was ok. Lacking in atmosphere. Can't decide if it wants to be an Irish bar or a place that appeals to the stroller brigade. In trying to do both, it succeeds at nothing. Will not go back.",,,
18,James D.,"New York, NY",53,15,0,5.0,3/25/2016,"My go to local place and without a doubt the best pub on the UWS.  It does not try to be an I Irish Style pub.  It actually is.   Equally perfect for friends or business acquaintances, or just myself. There always seems to be a good crowd with a nice mix of local and people just checking out the area.    Great atmosphere with a good game always on the TV's.  With so many generic pubs and bars with ""character"" created overnight it is nice to be in some place real.  I always get a good drink whether it be Guinness, Stella or Jameson's.  A feat which is all too rare in the city these days when most places are just looking for big tabs and quality is secondary.   Early Sunday afternoon brunch is perfect for my requisite Irish breakfast.  Even more relaxing due to the fact that they are on the corner and have a large window exposure on two sides.  I am by no extent a food connoisseur but if I am going to eat out I want it be something decent.  On that point food here excels.  I know for a fact that everything is cooked to order and I am not getting anything nuked.  Food is quality and fresh. Think hearty Celtic food with nice healthy portions.  I have a robust appetite and always finish much fulfilled.  Fish and chips is my staple when I need something to go. Introduced English friend to their curry fries.  I think I saw a tear come to his eye the first time he ate them.  He was homesick and they have the same curry sauce as used in Ireland and England.     Have also used for catering for work events and my coworkers were truly impressed.   For the most part two co-owners Siobhan or Paul are behind the bar. It makes a nice difference.",4,,1

20,Karen S.,"New York, NY",461,423,851,3.0,2/17/2015,"It's my 3rd year living on the UWS and it's high time that I find my neighborhood bar. I can't keep going all the way out to Sunnyside to Molly Bloom's if I want a solid Irish joint. I miss you Molly... :( First, don't sit in the front during the winter. I should have sat further in, but the couple making out in the most dispassionate PDA I've ever seen distracted me. Smashing your face together and holding it there is like watching little kids playing house. Slightly disturbing but you don't want to say anything and give them a complex. Thankfully the server brought them their check and broke it up.  I came for the ""Celtic"" Onion soup mainly. It's traditional French Onion soup so don't worry. All the molten cheese you try to eat too fast as usual, on top of a slice of baguette. The onion was very sweet. I'm on the fence about it. I still ended up tipping the bowl to finish it all. I could have sworn I ordered the Fish & Chips because I was already killin' it with the onions in the soup. My server brought out Bangers & Mash. I really didn't mind because I was eyeing it anyway, but it was loaded with even more onion! I really do love onions but now I'm going to be peeing them for the rest of the week. (TMI TMI) The presentation was surprisingly fancy for such a staple dish. It was a mashed potato volcano with gravy lava, buttressed with 4 good sized sausages. It was cute as a button. The gravy was a bit greasy, but overall it was successful. There's free, non-password protected WiFi. But I couldn't see any outlets. This is crucial to becoming my home away from home. But I could have made it work if they had hard cider on tap. I know I'm asking for a lot, most places don't. Not even Molly's. But Magner's in bottles and two others in cans... I can't.I was just on the UES at an Irish bar and had some of the best cider on tap since I was in my 20s in Bainbridge section of the Bronx. IRA/Sinn Féin embezzling and FBI raids and ""jump up jump up to jump down"" House of Pain type bars that sometimes would serve you skunky Woodpecker, but you didn't care. You loved it. THAT'S what I want, but I don't want to go across town to get it, dammit. I'm going to have to go crosstown aren't I? I mainly can't do this because the service was more inattentive than even I like. I don't need someone asking me if everything is okay every 10 mins. But I also don't like have to wait 10 mins after finishing my drink to finally flag you down to get another. It was not busy. In fact it was a ghost town compared to other places up the block that I walked past on my way home. And it was only 11 pm. Nope. I'm going to have to keep looking. Jesus. This was the longest 3 star review that I think I've ever written. Sorry!",3,3,3
21,Louisa R.,"Manhattan, NY",315,3,5,1.0,2/20/2017,"I live in the neighborhood and the service at St. James Gate is the worst in the area. I've gone there with friends just to grab a drink and to eat and was disappointed every time. People recommended their calamari but honestly, the portion is tiny for how much you pay and it is mediocre food. Not to mention, they always play their music WAYYYYY to loud considering the vibe/size/atmosphere of the pub. Often times I can hear their music from my apartment in the wee hours of the morning, even after they've closed! Whether you're planning on eating there or living near/above them, I'd reconsider...",1,,
22,Rob F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,23,0,4.0,6/7/2017,Comfy irish pub on the Upper West side on a nice corner. Nice windows and vibe. Owners who regularly bartend are quite hospitable and make folks feel welcome. Good music and cheer!,2,,
23,Sil A.,"Bronx, NY",1,72,8,4.0,6/7/2016,"I love most of the places on this neighborhood. However i usually go to the happy hour across the street. I don't even think St James Gate has a happy hour. I've been here about 3 times and its pretty cool i guess. the drinks were good, could've bee a lil stronger. The calamari is good though i wished it had a different sauce. The bruschetta was very salty last time i had it. What makes this place different from the other local bars around there is the Vibe. It has a much older crowed which can sometimes be good or bad. It's good if you just want to hang there and relax alone or with a friend. It's not too loud and no one will bother you. There a lot of old man and they can be creepy at times so that's a Little weird.",,,

Nice lil bar spot that we found, nothing too fancy or special about it but cool for a nice night cap with some friends to have a few drinks and take a few whiskey shots.Probably not a spot I would come to on the regular but good enough that if I am already out and looking for a random spot to catch a few drinks dolo or with a few friends off the cuff that I know it's around.",,,

33,Maggie L.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,4.0,12/8/2016,"I live further uptown so I found this place while wandering around the neighborhood after seeing my doctor. I was famished and needed a warm, satisfying meal. What a find!  Paul, the bartender/server is charming, friendly, and takes good care of you.  I confess, the only thing I've had here so far is their fish and chips--on all 4 visits.  If you order them, you'll understand why:  freshly made fries and fish (no reheating here), with a crisp golden coating on the generous pieces of fish, and delicious cole slaw, also a good size portion. In fact, the only problem I have is that the portions are so large, I can never completely finish the dish.  I gave 4 instead of 5 stars only because the table layout is odd, and sitting at a table against the side wall in front of a stair bannister to downstairs feels isolating. I sat at the bar once, which was very nice. The high seats by the window in front are nice, but cold in winter.  There is a loft and a back area, which I'll have to check out. I like the quiet, relaxing ambiance, but then again, I've never been there with crowds since I come at odd afternoon hours. By the way, on my travels I've seen Irish pubs (actually named ""Irish Pub"") in many non-Irish cities, including Tel Aviv, Graz, and Aix en Provence.  I guess everyone wants to have one and I can't blame them.  Wondering whether anyone else has come across ""Irish Pubs"", so named,  in other cities.So yes, this is a one dish review, but there's a reason fish and chips can be had in almost every pub: they are good, basic food, like a burger, and they can be awful or the heights of flavor and satisfaction . These are the best I've had anywhere, including on a trip to Ireland. I've read some negative reviews, but they have to be those inevitable slip-ups that every restaurant (and every business) experiences. Next time I'll try the bangers an. mash, since people seem to love them -- long live Irish pubs, especially the St James Gate",1,1,1

I did enjoy the upstairs landing with a few tables. My friend and I were lucky enough to enjoy a private dinner and catch up without any other customers arriving to sit up there as well for a solid two hours. Talk about good luck!I see this more as a place I'd get future drinks as opposed to eating a sit-down meal...",5,4,4

The place was dimly lit and had kind of a rustic atmosphere. We were immediately greeted by a waiter and we ordered appetizers and drinks. We had the Celtic Onion Soup and the boneless buffalo chicken wings. The soup was one of the best onion soups Ive ever had. The boneless wings were tender and very good. The we ordered some turkey burgers and these were served on a fresh bun with some of the best fries around. My husband had a couple of Bluemoons and I had a glass of Cabernet. I should've asked the waiter what kind it was because it was soooooo yummy.  They played great 90s music in the background ...definitely had me reminiscing. Why not 5 stars? Well you had a couple that was carrying on like they needed to get a room and another in what like seemed to be a love spat otherwise I had a nice time relaxing with hubby here before our long drive to CT.,3,1,1

Checked out a few of the local watering holes, but they looked a bit shaky.Then we found St. James Gate on the sunny side of the street. Great atmosphere, small but welcoming bar. Found table in middle of restaurant with perfect views of games (Mets vs Yanks, Isles vs Caps). Service with a smile immediately from Ashley (sp?) our server. Very pleasant and helpful with menu suggestions. We ordered some brews and the smoked salmon appetizer. Very fresh and tasty.My wife ordered the fish and chips as her main ( and let me tell you, there was so much food, she needed a bigger boat...apologies to Roy Scheider) and she loved what she was able to finish. I had the chicken pot pie and it had to be the best pot pie I can remember having. I was able to finish this very large portion and help my wife with her fish. We were very satisfied with the quality of the food and the service.Stayed for a couple more drinks and chatted it up with some of the locals and we just had a very pleasant pre-show experience.

48,Lynn D.,"Chicago, IL",2,39,1,3.0,10/5/2013,"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  My boyfriend is into sports and there was a MLB game playing and I had a craving for good old American fare.  The place was lively, but still manageable (means we were able to get seats without a wait - I was hungry and didn't want to wait).  The sound level was nice.  It was lively, yet not too loud where you had to yell to talk to each other...which is good because it's a bar/restaurant.  They had several televisions and different games playing including the baseball game.  It means I get to eat and my boyfriends gets to watch baseball...it's a win-win.I ordered the St. James turkey sandwich with avocado.  It normally comes with bacon, but I don't like bacon so I asked them to leave it off.  Without the bacon, it was pretty bland and not very flavorful.  I wouldn't order it again.  The bacon version might be good for those who like bacon.  The fries were good and flavorful and offset the blandness of the sandwich somewhat.  I would go back and order something else.    My boyfriend ordered the shrimp fajita which came out on a smokin' sizzlin' skillet.  I was quite jealous and had ""order remorse.""  The dish had 4 jumbo shrimp with sautéed peppers and onions.  I tried the sautéed veggies and they were quite flavorful with a little bit of spice, although a little bit greasy.  The fajitas came with health servings of sour cream and 2 other sides, which I can't recall.  Maybe guacamole and salsa.  He enjoyed his dish.Overall, an average experience.  It depends on what you order.  I would go back again...but I would order something different.  They do have a Guinness and chocolate ice cream that looked interesting for dessert.  We didn't have any room for dessert.  The servings are large.",1,1,1

We sat down at one of the three open tables outdoors and ordered coffee which was just fine. The server did not push us to order food. The weather was absolutely gorgeous at a mild 75 degrees with the sun glazing, the tree providing sufficient shade and unnecessary droppings of pollen and mite size yellow bugs on the table, couples spending quality time on a stroll, dogs of all sizes and breeds pouncing back and forth, cars slowly passing by tailing a gentle breeze- a perfect picture of happiness in the pleasant Manhattan suburb. This is how Sunday is suppose to be spent. As time went by the sun slowly creeped into the table, on my legs, and to my arms and face, and I with the temperment and skin tone of a vampire, dashed away indoors and ended up studying next to a bunch of alcoholics drinking at 2pm Sunday afternoon. I cannot comment on the food, but the service and coffee (cream and sugar) were excellent.",,,

Don't see how calamari and fried mushrooms are considered authentic. But hey, I had pretty slim pickings since I eat a mostly vegetarian diet. The calamari was too chewy and the dip was a weird sweet chili sauce. Not a fan. The fried mushrooms were slightly better.  I felt sick by the amount of oil that these mushrooms had in them. Maybe the restaurant should increase the temperature of the deep fryers so the mushrooms don't need to be fried as long. Both dishes were overly salty. The Irish coffee was WAY too sweet. And this is coming from someone who has an extreme sweet tooth. Couldn't finish it. Would have asked the server to put more coffee into it to dilute it, but service was pretty terrible. I can't even excuse it on the restaurant being busy.  I will never come back here. There are so many bars in the area, I see no need to come back to this place.",,1,

58,Ryan G.,"San Jose, CA",28,89,21,4.0,2/1/2013,"Cool bar. Seriously lacking Irish pub.St. James Gate looks and bills itself as an Irish pub, but the most Irish beer served is Guinness. To their credit, they also serve Smithwicks, but do not serve nearly enough Irish beers to call themselves an Irish pub. That said, St. James Gate is a cool bar. We asked for the Rangers game to be tuned on a TV. They offered to tune the TV in the upstairs loft and sat us at one the the four tables there. As it was a weeknight, the bar was slow and we briefly shared the loft with another couple who were not interested in the hockey game at all. After they left, we had the whole loft area to ourselves, which was super awesome. The server made periodic trips up the stairs to check on our beer consumption and offer us more, even though we were her only table in the loft. She never seemed inconvenienced for going out of her way for just us.Overall, St, James Gate is a low-key bar with an awesome loft area and good service.

They were still doing brunch and the whole menu looked enticing. I ended up ordering a beer (coney island lager) and opted for a sandwich. I got the New Yorker, which was rye, bacon, egg and cheese served with french fries. The sandwich was good, and the fries were fantastic as well. Service was good and the place wasn't terribly crowded or loud. They also set up a few tables outside when the weather is warm enough.One thing that bothered me was when I was waiting for the bathroom, the person that came out didn't wash his hands, and normally I wouldn't mind too much, but I noticed him go straight into the employees door across the way.",2,2,1

Wait in line somewhere else. This place is so not worth the fast sit-down.St. James was very inviting with their windows open, lots of sunlight filtering in and lots of tables open. There were so many open tables for a reason. This place blowwwwwwws.A chef should be able to accommodate some easy substitutions or requests from the customer...nothing outrageous of course, but easy requests. For example: all I wanted were scrambled eggs, instead of their omelet because the menu did not offer any scrambled egg combos. Making scrambled eggs is not that different from making an omelet. Eggs are still beaten in a bowl, add-ins are still added in at the same time...the only difference - an omelet is flipped once...scrambled eggs I guess do require a little more in-the-pan action with a wooden spoon. But really...minimal effort on the chef's part.Well, I asked for scrambled. The waitress then proceeds to tell me that the chef usually just ""flips it over."" I again say that I would appreciate scrambled over omelet. (Is it really that hard???) The food comes out and there's my omelet that I didn't ask for. WHATEVER. Maybe the food will be good anyway...The eggs were dry and overcooked. There was not enough cheese to even call this a cheese omelet. The only thing good about my meal were the potatoes. And let's all be real here: potatoes are not hard to make. But then again, neither are eggs. I mean...they're eggs. Nonetheless...the chef still fucked them up and the waitress could have cared less. I paid $12 for shitty eggs and potatoes.So my dish sucked. What about the BBQ Chicken Sandwich my bf ordered? He said, ""George Keeley's...SO MUCH BETTER."" (And cheaper might I add) So the sandwich sucked as well. Again, the chef was able to make some good fries...but came way short when it came to the actual meal. Pretty shitty.What else sucks about this place? Service wasn't real friendly and for some reason the waitress decided to squeeze an entire orange into my Blue Moon to the point where it was so damn sweet I couldn't finish it. Thanks for sticking your dirty-ass fingers in my drink.Will not be back. Highly recommend you stay away from this place. We'll have to see how long St. James actually stays in business.",1,3,

There was a good selection of food including some specials at low for NYC prices.I had the Irish beef stew. It had plenty of meat and came in a soupy broth consistency along with carrots and potatos and a side of mashed. It was rustic, not refined - but still satisfying.My wife had the Quiche Lorraine. She described it as ""eggy"" i.e., with a scrambled egg taste to it rather then the refined taste you would get in a french place. It also came with some kind of cheese toppings that is not in the traditional french style.

83,Bob B.,"Manhattan, NY",2,10,0,3.0,7/14/2011,"In a neighborhood devoid of much personality when it comes to bars and restaurants, St. James Gate isn't really a standout. But why I chose to drink here as opposed to at other establishments in the area is because it is very chill and low-key. The drinks are good, the staff is always friendly and helpful--although I wouldn't exactly say enthusiastic, the food is actually pretty great for bar food, and the decor is brighter and a bit more cheerful than bars in the area. It also has a slightly older, more relaxed and non-""fratty"" clientele than the surrounding bars which I like.Good place to come to unwind after work, and I've never had a problem getting a seat at the bar.I can't really say anything BAD about the place (maybe except for the music - but they are willing to turn off the Black Eyed Peas Pandora station if you ask them). Also - I kind of expect IRISH bartenders when I am in an Irish pub. I find it kind of lacking when I am in an Irish bar I being served by someone who doesn't even speak English very well.What would get five stars from me would be if they paid a little more attention to details such as hiring some younger, and more enthusiastic IRISH bartenders, and paying a little more attention to the music they play.

Here is our order our with reviews for each:Appetizer: Mac n' cheeseProbably the only good part of our experience there. Entree: Fish and ChipsWe've had WAY better and WAY cheaper fish and chips.

Met friends here on a Friday night for drinks which wound up turning into lots of drinks, food and fun. Who would think a dive-looking Irish bar on the UWS would kick garlic mushrooms, calamari and boneless wings into overdrive? The bruschetta was a bit different but solid -- someone needs to school them on how to properly toast and scrape garlic cloves onto on-the-bias-sliced baguette -- but otherwise, no complaints at all -- unless you despise 80's music. A strange choice for musical accompaniment in an Irish pub, but clearly this is not your average Irish pub and, clearly, it's worth a visit for drinks and eats.Incidentally, it's quiet early, but picks up steam later. And the service is solid.Definitely worth a (return) trip.",,,

I like that they take the time to properly poor a Guiness... points for that. Unfortunately we werent eating, so I can't speak on the quality of the food, but our server was very friendly, and gracious, We were lucky enough to score a table from some guys as they were leaving at half time... right next to the window where I could people watch!

109,Scott R.,"Austin, TX",303,784,12,3.0,10/5/2008,"St. James Gate fills the gaping pub void between McAleer's on 425 Amsterdam Ave (80th/81st) and George Keeley's on 485 Amsterdam Ave (83rd/84th) that cannot be filled by the gazillion bars in between those two. They've done a mild makeover of the previous tenet - Louie's Westside Cafe.  The interior makeover is good.  I just wish they redid the exterior which is all windows on two sides.  Way too much natural light.  The only thing that should be well lit at a pub is the customers...The menu is surprisingly non-Irish.  A Shepherd's Pie is surrounded by standard bar far like a Cajun chicken sandwich, a tomato and mozzarella sandwich, and fajitas.  No fish and chips?!The Celtic Onion soup ($4.95) is very good.  The difference between this and French Onion soup - as confirmed by my bartender - is that this was served in a pub instead of a cafe.  (Interestingly enough, they still call the fried potatoes French Fries...).  You can get a soup + any of the sandwiches (inc. the burger) for $10...not a bad deal at all.  The Burger ($9.95) gets points for texture as it's more of a loose confederation of ground beef than the united patties you often get at a bar.  But there wasn't a ton of flavor here.Mac & Cheese ($7.50) and Mashed Potatoes are both tasty but they are rich (cheese for the former, butter for the latter).Service is friendly.  The vibe inside is nice enough - probably the tamest of all the Amsterdam bars (post-post-frat?).  Has Irish (Guinness + Smithwicks) and domestic (Brooklyn, Blue Moon) on tap.   There are a couple of big flat-screen TVs.  They don't have the NFL package so - if you're going on a Sunday - hope you're watching the Giants or Jets....It may not be the equivalent of walking through St. Peter's gate but that's no reason to demonize it...",4,5,1

116,Brendon T.,"Brooklyn, NY",73,49,2,3.0,5/22/2011,"This would be a four- or a five-star review were it not for the brunch we had today; in fact, in looking at the other reviews for this place (most low reviews seem to mention brunch), I notice a pattern.To get the good (which is the majority of our opinion on SJG) out first: it's a fine bar and is unusually low-key, quiet, and friendly for its area. Unlike a lot of the other bars on that stretch of Amsterdam, they're almost never dominated by frat boys or the young singles crowd, and you can almost always hear well enough to carry on a conversation inside. Many of the staff are ""authentically"" Irish, judging from their accents, and nearly all of the rest are friendly and efficient. The food can be pricy, it's true, and so I wouldn't generally go there for dinner, but for snacks or a quick bite, they can be great - the curry fries are among our favorite unhealthy foods, and their near-constant ""special"" salad with blackened chicken is excellent.Today, however, we were shocked by how poor the service AND the food were at brunch. We went in for a hangover brunch, picking our way through the Taste of the Upper West Side, and despite the only-half-capacity crowd, everything seemed to take forever. Our drinks took a while to come, then we didn't get side plates on which to eat our muffins, then those took forever to come once we asked for them, and finally, our food took an inordinately long time to appear. The waitress (who I'd never seen before) seemed extremely awkward - once we'd officially been waiting for A Long Time, I pointedly made eye contact with her and smiled only to have her look awkwardly away. A simple acknowledgement of, ""I know your food's taking a while and I'm sorry, it'll be out ASAP,"" would've gone a long way.What's worse, once it did finally come out, our food was badly mis-cooked in different ways - her cheeseburger, ordered rare, was cooked past well (gross), and my over-medium eggs were so under-done that piercing the yolks let out a clear mass of whites (even more gross). I suppose I jinxed myself by remarking to my partner that ""over medium eggs are safe because I don't mind an egg that's more easy or hard."" Wrong - they found a way to make one unpalatable.Again, one bad brunch doesn't make this a bad bar - it's a fine place to stop by for a drink or a light (if not inexpensive) snack. Until they get their act together on weekend mornings, however, I'd stay away. And that's a shame, because they have damn fine white and black pudding.",,,
117,Dan B.,"Brooklyn, NY",440,973,42,1.0,3/17/2010,"This place is garbage and here is why: $16.95 for corned beef and cabbage.  They give you about 2-3 ounces of corned beef and completely fill the rest of the plate with mediocre cabbage.  The taste of the corned beef was pretty bad too.  Look, I could have gone east on 80th st to Columbus Ave and got a HUGE 1/2 pound corned beef sandwich that actually has GOOD and JUICY corned beef in it and then boiled cabbage at home for maybe $5-$6.  $16.95 for the worst corned beef and cabbage I've ever had at a self-proclaimed ""Irish"" restaurant?  That's just ridiculous.  You really have to be lacking in the attic to think that this place is a good deal.  Places like this exist to rip off the post-frat boy douchebag crowd because they don't know any better and wouldn't be cultured enough to tell the difference.  Not only that, it really pissed me off that I got maybe 4 slices of corned beef and the group of people sitting next to me ordered the exact same thing and got a heaping portion.  Regardless, the corned beef tastes pretty bad anyway. Also, the only positive reviews on this place are from people who have no reviews and no pictures.  So, you would definitely be wise to avoid this place and not let the managers post fake reviews to mislead you.  Guinness was an unprecedented $8 each.  There were two of us and we ordered 2 Guinnesses and one plate of that nasty corned beef and cabbage and our bill came out to a little over $36!!! Only one of us ate for Christ's sake?  I felt like I had been ripped off so bad.  I want to save others from making the same mistake I did.  I should have taken a hint that this place would be bad when I noticed the type of people that go there.   If you see a bar or restaurant where there's loud and obnoxious college douchebaggery going on, then you'll most likely feel like a simpleton yourself when you leave.  It absolutely astonishes me that people will pay this kind of money for this low quality food.  You can go to Soom Soom on W 72nd St for Christ's sake and get the most delicious falafel sandwich in your life for about $4.95, and yet I see places like this packed and places like Soom Soom relatively empty.  I guess I'm going to have to start drawing cynical conclusions regarding the intelligence of the human race.LOL MATTHEW F AND KRISTINA F both have no reviews and no pictures.  They both posted pretty much identical reviews both on the exact same day. HAHA.  HMMMMMM I wonder who those people could be.  I don't know what kind of naivety it would take to think that THAT strategy would fool anyone.  I guess it would take precisely the same amount of stupidity as someone who would run a restaurant like this.   Now they're probably either going to add pictures or delete the profiles or something like that, but come on.  Managers posting fake reviews? On the same day?  Maybe you guys should concentrate on the quality of the food you serve instead of engaging in childish internet play.  I am embarrassed that such a place exists on my Upper West Side.  Leave the neighborhood, we don't want you.",5,5,

My friend Kristen found a hair in her meal and after our server told her it would be off the bill... it wasn't. We had to ask him again to take it off. Had several rounds of drinks with my friends and never had a drink bought back for us.... in fact.... they charged us for drinks we didn't have and the server argued with us but after he rang in our check (with gratuity of course) offered to buy me a drink... way too late to redeem himself or the bar.
