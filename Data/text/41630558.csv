0,Allison C.,"Cornwall, NY",22,8,1,5.0,5/31/2018,This place is just consistently good. Fresh French fires. Juicy tasty chicken. I've come here on several occasions at different times and it's always been delicious!,,,
1,Carrie H.,"Issaquah, WA",47,461,549,2.0,6/23/2018,While visiting Grand Central Station with a group tour we found this place. My teenage daughter was interested in their steak and I had an interest in one of their sandwiches with fries.I must say I was very impressed with how kind and patient the staff was for being located where it is. There's plenty of seats located nearby for all the customers from the various food vendors to eat at. There's plenty of security that's easy to see to make you feel safe which is great.As far as the food goes I can take it or leave it. Neither my daughter or I were overly impressed as her steak was a bit rough from being overly cooked and had no flavor without the sauces that came with them. The serving of fries they give is huge and I ended up sharing it with a couple other people from our tour group sitting nearby. There's no free refills on drinks so keep that in mind. Overall it's good enough and perhaps a good place to chill and get a snack as long as you have proper expectations as to what type of food you're going to get.,,1,
2,Rebecca G.,"Manhattan, NY",58,723,45,3.0,11/16/2018,"Upon showing Grand Central Station to a friend who was visiting, we stopped by Tri Tip Grill for lunch. I ordered the Tri Tip salad, which was just an average lunchtime salad. However, the steak was well-marinated, and the salad itself wasn't too heavily dressed so all in all, it was A-OK.",,,
3,Julie Ying X.,"Brooklyn, NY",204,469,469,3.0,8/1/2018,"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  I got the 30% off Groupon cashback deal and thought I would check this place out since it's close to work.  I ordered the Chipotle Border Tri Tip sandwich.  The sandwich was smaller than I expected.  However, the steak was cooked well - warm and juicy.  The pepper jack cheese, chipotle sauce, and the peppers went well with the steak.  The bread was a bit too thick so it was hard to eat the sandwich.  It's pretty pricey for a sandwich ($11) but it's not bad with 30% off ($9).  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if there's another deal, I would come back.",,,1

5,Andrew T.,"Volcano, HI",113,490,400,5.0,9/12/2017,"I forgot to take a picture of my dinner sandwich, sorry, I was woofing it down only slightly less aggressively than my dog would have (I've learned from the best, sorry, yes, I was that guy with my head down in my seat on the train).  It was messy but good.  Should have gotten a fork with it.There's a more brand-name competitor next door with a long waiting line so I bypassed them and headed to Tri-Tip grill (no line) on both the way in AND out of Grand Central since ""time was of the essence.""  Service was fast and friendly and I was not disappointed --- I enjoyed both my breakfast sandwich and my dinner sandwich.",,,
6,Scott B.,"Brooklyn Heights, NY",1142,623,2346,2.0,7/30/2017,"I came to Tri Tip today after the gym for a quick bite. Overall, my sandwich was pretty good, but I wish it had been a little hotter. I got the Philly, and it was delivered to me lukewarm. My partner Tony ordered the tri tip sandwich with cheddar and bacon, and it was barely warm as well. Maybe that is just the way their sandwiches are served. If so, they should change that practice! Size-wise, the sandwiches are on the smaller size--by New York standards that is... and because they are small-ish, they are overpriced.As for taste, everything we ordered tasted pretty good. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the fries were crispy and fresh.Note that I gave this restaurant 2 stars, but my real rating is 2.5 stars.",3,2,
7,Jade M.,"New York, NY",53,119,328,4.0,12/14/2016,Was surprising good. Can't believe I can get something like this around grand central. Good clean and flavourful beef sandwiches.I wasn't even able to finish half of the sandwiches as it was a little too big for me.Food from train station normally is over priced and a bit bad in the UK. Captured market and what not I guess. But not Grand Central Terminal - food is top notch here.Tbh the beef they told me should be medium rare but came out more like medium to well done.Fries were crisp and soft inside.,4,1,3
8,Jim H.,"New York, NY",9,48,128,2.0,7/13/2018,"I got their pulled pork and it came on a bed of mixed greens with no dressing. The pork itself was a bit dry and they could've offered dressing for the salad. I actually got bored mid meal, stopped eating & wrapped it up to save it for later. I didn't get a side dish because those were carbohydrate loaded and I was trying to watch my carbs. I'll eat here again when I'm not watching my carbs and get one of their sandwiches. But, I don't expect much from that. But, I'm not going to disregard this place just yet. I debated on giving Tri Tip a 3 instead of the 2 star rating that I gave. But, the meal I had wasn't good enough to be more than 2. Plus, there are so many other food vendors downstairs at Grand Central that are quite good. One more thing to mention is that everything downstairs at Grand Central is counter service and they're all begging for tips when you pay with a credit card and they expect no less than 15%. I think this is so insulting to waiters who offer you table service during an entire meal and waiters work really hard to give great quality service and they don't get much more than 15 or 20% themselves. It's unfair for counter service people to expect a tip, when they make a better wage than do waiters, & counter service is where the client places the order at the counter and takes it away. Next thing you know, people at the drugstore are going to want a tip for ringing you up & bagging up your item!",,,
9,Adam H.,"New York, NY",4,68,1,2.0,11/8/2017,"Dining at Grand Central doesn't have to suck anymore, but these guys seem committed to the suck. It's mainly about the service which seems to be completely unsupervised and anarchistic. The staff will leave your food getting cold while they fool around with each other. They mix the hot, fresh fries with the old, stale ones, resulting in a random mix of acceptable and inedible food. And the attitude they project is really poor. Sorry that I interrupted their fun by trying to buy some food. Trust me, I won't let it happen again. Giving 2 stars because I only give 1 star if a place makes my physically ill.",1,,
10,Chris S.,"Astoria, New York, NY",154,245,9,2.0,9/13/2017,"The lines during lunch are atrocious while the staff seems completely chaotic.   I waited for 35 mins for a 15 dollar salad in a train station food court.  I know, I know - I heard it - But let's face it, Urban Space is a few foot steps a way and REALLY sets the fast casual standard for Grand Central.   The produce was not fresh, the steak was very bland, and the dressings tasted like Kraft garbage.    Trying not to sound like Johnny rain cloud here, but I would skip it.   Plenty of other delicious options down there for a quick lunch to take back to the office.",,,
11,Nick D.,"New York, NY",80,508,704,4.0,1/12/2017,"Luckily I work and live down the street from Grand Central so I get to experience their food court quite often. I've walked by Tri Tip a few times and questioned why I haven't visited because I'm a huge meat eater. I ordered the Roadhouse Buck which was thinly sliced steak, roadhouse onions, blue cheese and red ranch. The sandwich definitely covered the flavor aspect but this sandwich was covered with onions as you can see in my picture. I like them, but I don't love them. Next time, I'll let them know to go easy on them. This came with a side of red potato mashers with gravy which was good but not great. An overall nice lunch spot that I would visit again.",2,,
12,M'Ral B.,"Mamaroneck, NY",1,17,0,2.0,5/22/2018,"The quality of this place has really gone down hill. You could think that with Shake Shack right next door they would try a bit harder to woo patrons, but they don't. The staff was eating while on the job. The food was not appealingly displayed and the back counter was scattered with pots and pans of various levels of cleanliness. The B rating from the health department certainly makes sense. Additionally, the sandwich I ordered was dry and it doesn't come with cheese..just meat and au jus. With tax, I paid over ten dollars--a ten dollar sandwich should definitely come with cheese!Visited on April 27, 2018.",,,

The service is fast and I've always been treated kindly even though they have a high employee turnover rate!!The only hard part is finding a nice spot to sit to eat. Grand Central seating near this area is congested. Taking this in consideration I go for lunch very early when I go here so I can get a table.For a huge delicious salad you can't beat the Tri Tip Grill.,1,1,1
15,Timmy T.,"Brooklyn, NY",13,10,0,1.0,1/25/2018,"Wow, if you like things that suck, then may I recommend the pulled pork sandwich at this not-so-fine eating establishment in the food court of Grand Central. Everything about it was bad. The 'pork' was primarily globs of fat (which I almost choked on). I could've saved a lot of money and just taken a spoon to a can of Crisco. They do that thing where they put the cole slaw *in* the sandwich, not on the side. Speaking of the slaw, it is named 'apple slaw' because they put 2 or 3 bits of apple in it. Fun. The bun was really dry and stale. The mashed potatoes were ok, but no gravy or jus? I wish there was a way to make the Earth spin faster so that I could put today's lunch at Tri Tip further behind me.",,,
16,Karen C.,"Santa Monica, CA",196,358,1071,5.0,8/14/2015,"4.5 stars for the price & quality of steak, as well as the portions, you can't really go wrong with stopping here for a quick bite.I sort of had low expectations of this stand because it seems so ""fast food""-like that I assumed the tri tip steak would be mediocre but acceptable for a quick lunch. Instead, the steak (prime rib?) was great! And they did not skimp on the portion. It just wasn't as hot as I would've liked it to be, so minus 0.5 stars.Plus, the line isn't long, it's underrated next to the Shake Shack stand, worth going to!PS, they sell alcohol!",,,
17,Daniel S.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",476,325,1387,4.0,10/9/2014,"Tri Tip Grill serves hearty, smokey, and luscious tri tip meat - one bite, an instant vacation to a Texas cookout filled with charred flavor and gummy texture.  It's surprising to find it hidden in the basement of Grand Central food court next to the renowned Shake Shack, the place with an extraordinary long line during lunch.  If people knew about Tri Tip they would realize they are standing in the wrong line.The tri tip small plate consists of 3 thick slices burned on the outside and soft pink blush in the inside, a perfect medium rare.  I initially felt ripped off spending $12 on 3 slices of meat then realized each piece is like a thin steak which led me to be filled and satisfied to say the least.  It's not a meal yet not a snack.  We can define it as a hearty serving of pure protein with horseradish and french dip sauce and fried caramelized onion rings.  You can't go wrong ordering the Tri Tip Small Plate.  Cons - no vegetables and carbs.  Wait, fried onions.",6,4,4

The counter people were nice enough but my problem was with the food.

By that time I was too hungry to wait on the long line for Shake Shack (consistently good), so I settled for this, which I didn't expect to be great, but nor did I expect it to be this bad. Namesake tri tip was tough, as in couldn't be sliced by the supplied plastic utensils. Vegetables also undercooked -- not al dente, just raw. Huge portion -- of inedible food.

The sandwich was very tasty. The steak was the prefect texture for a sandwich,  tender but didn't fall apart in your mouth or the sandwich. Even Bob Thomas would like this sandwich because it's chucked full of meat.  I got bbq on the side and you should too. While the sandwich is flavorful it needs additional sauce. Even a beverage wouldn't wash that beef and bread down easily. It was pretty cheap at $10 so I  was a satisfied customer.",,,

The large salad underneath was fresh and lightly dressed with a vinaigrette.

That one thing...? ...Small Plate Tri Tip Steak.I recommend getting it medium cooked. For about $10 you get about 8 ounces of steak, onion strings and au jus sauce. Note, steak portion is the same serving size as the large plate but without all the fixings.I usually get a side of bbq sauce and double dip my always juicy steak.  Admittingly, the plate can be a bit heavy in terms of a meal.

The red ranch sauce was fanTAStic!!  Chicken was grilled perfectly as well and the bacon was thick and crunchy.  Service was quick for being such a small kitchen. My coworkers and I marvelled at how everyone was so efficient for their small space. The only complaint I have is that the proportion of the sandwich was off, so that one side you got delicious heaven and then the other, you got bread and sauce-less, cheese-less chicken.  However, I'd go back to explore the rest of their menu.  For $10, it was a good value.  (Oh, the french fries were perfect too!)",1,,1

It IS very refreshing to be able to eat steak in midtown that isn't a $50 filet mignon, but this is obviously not some gourmet, fancy restaurant, so you get what you pay for. I ordered the small version of their philly cheese steak and a side of ranch, because that's how I like it. It was alright, but the onions and peppers were served in the sandwich as huge slabs so I wasn't really able to enjoy the flavors because I pulled most of them off of the sandwich. The steak was fine, and the sandwich was good, but I don't know that I'd eat here again because I didn't feel very well afterward.

37,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",360,1568,103,2.0,12/11/2014,"On my way out to the suburbs from Grand Central, my friend and I decided to grab lunch at Tri Tip in the lower level of the station before heading out. I'd heard many things about how good the sandwiches here were, so I was excited to try one of their standard steak sandwiches. Getting our food wasn't much of an issue (aside from being provided with zero napkins for a sandwich that you drizzle / drown in au jus), and we eventually found a spot at one of the tables in the seating section to chow down at.Unfortunately, I came out of the meal quite disappointed. Maybe I should have gotten a sandwich with more condiments on it, but that wouldn't obscure the fact that the meat itself was chewy and rather flavorless without the au jus - which would have worked really well for something that already had intense flavoring but ended up coming off as a bit too light on this sandwich. I would also add that it was quite difficult to pour the au jus in any sort of fashion that either a) provided enough flavor, or b) didn't drench the sandwich and meant you have a running river of greasy au jus at one end of the sandwich. Ultimately, though, the chewy meat makes it problematic to eat a sandwich - you take a small bite and end up with a giant mouthful of meat and a lot of stringy tendons stuck between your teeth. I might come back to try something else, but this reminded me of some of the less-stellar cheesesteak places I've been to in Philly - and it pales in comparison to something like the prime rib sandwich at Eataly, which is what this aspires to be and falls quite a bit short of.",1,1,1

Highlight of the meal were the onion straws that were done nicely and went great with ketchup. I know it sounds stupid, like that dude from Top Chef that said ""but...sweet always goes with savory."" Anyhow if you're ever in that mood for something simple and hearty like a roast beef sandwich in au jus then look no further.  I'm pretty certain that they are using tri-tip, that said its just like a rump or round roast (aka roast beef) the cut easily dries out and I can see where other diners are frustrated. If you argue about the ""marbling""  over each of these cuts then you are splitting hairs because the cuts all pretty much taste the same. Anyways with the few poor reviews, I can see that its possible if the reviewer happened to have bad timing and got some slices of beef that had been sitting and ended up being overcooked which would be management's job to ensure that all the dry ends are evenly distributed or whatever the case. Its sliced beef it dries out easy you know. I went during a prime midtown lunch rush and didn't experience anything of the sort. I say that again, I didn't experience anything of the sort. Lunch was a solid 3 stars. The bread was of the type that absorbs all the au jus once you dump it in. It can be pretty bland without the au jus. It was an all in all decent lunch experience!  If I were closer I would go to Carl's Steaks over this in a heartbeat but Grand Central being across the street from my job, I'm glad that its there. Today their Big Buck combo won out over a gut busting Clam Chowder and  Bouillabaise sandwich from Grand Central Oyster Bar's takeout window. The bouillabaise is one of my favorites for lunch as its basically a mostly fish stew slopped over some tasty portuguese type of a roll. I didn't want the office to smell like fish and as one of you snarky New Yorker might be thinking - I AM NOT one of those 'dang Asians that reheats their octopus eyeballs steeped in anchovy sauce with dried shrimp butt paste over lo mein in the office's microwave to stink up the whole afternoon at work...  At least not anymore anyways, hah hah.  I only say this after I once ate squid and pickled preserve veggies over rice much to everyone's anger in the office, ....or....that time I reheated my pork belly and shrimp paste on rice in the microwave and the container blew up so that the shrimp paste got all over the microwave. These were rookie Asian assimilation errors from way back when.  Lmao.  At least I'm honest right... I'll eat a squid ball right in front of you so what!",,,

Updated review","I came back here last week. The cashier was very nice to me. I ordered the Big Buck medium rare again in hopes that they improved it. My friend that I was with ordered the Border Buck.The problem i had this time around was that my buzzer wasn't working, so my 2 sandwiches were sitting at the counter for a few minutes longer than they should have. This probably led to some steaming of the meat. Overall though, the Big Buck was better. It wasn't salty at all, and it was very moist. You can see the bread had pink juices, so you can tell the tri tip beef was originally medium rare, but I guess due to the steaming it was more medium. I believe the reasoning of why it wasn't as salty as before was where the meat came from. If you get the end pieces, you tend to get more of surface area of the exterior of the meat where all the seasoning is. This time around I didn't get much of it, so it wasn't salty. The au jus was a perfect complement to pour into the sandwich. My bread did fall apart quite easily; i think the guy accidentally cut the bread too deep, but it's all good. My only minor complaint is the amount of onions i got this time around. It seemed like it was very little compared to the 1st time i got it. My friend's border buck was spicy and good, says he. I don't know since I didn't try it.I'm just glad this place has improved since its opening week. The meat was the perfect flavor; it wasn't salty and it was very moist. The au jus is awesome.",1,,
46,MK M.,"Jackson Heights, NY",270,335,93,1.0,9/11/2014,"Everytime I come here, the cashier girl is on her phone and they never have what I want either because they just don't have it. Like today I ordered a salmon sandwich at 9:50 (just aioli, lettuce, tomatoe, bread, lunch menu) they lookTo see if they have salmon, they grab a empty plastic container and pull out several disgusting looking pieces of salmon, all looking bad. ""We don't have a full piece of salmon"" though they had 3 pieces of bad looking salmon. (3 pieces can equal one idiot) i reply with you guys never have anything because it's true, I'm work at the oyster bar so I get meals here and they never have anything I want. So she replies with we are only serving breakfast now with tons of Spanish attitude, so I say then you shouldn't have all these menus up if your only serving one. I say u know what, I can go somewhere else, she replies yea you do that. This is what u get when u let employees run a business in GRAND CENTRAL STATION, horrible",,,
47,Peter M.,"Manhattan, NY",15,36,1,1.0,4/20/2015,"I stopped by Tri Tip for a quick salad, assuming it would take a few minutes to order and prepare. I waited for my salad for over 15 minutes, while I watched the staff behind the counter hand out multiple orders that were placed after mine. I finally asked the cashier what was going on, and she refunded my order, and she may or may not have mumbled an apology under her breath. I walked away, with no food, after wasting 20-30 minutes on this place. I do not recommend it and will never go back.",,1,1
48,Helen L.,"New York, NY",129,131,36,5.0,7/26/2015,"I woke up super early to catch the MetroNorth so I didn't get to eat breakfast at home and was really hungry by the time I got to Grand Central. I don't come to this area very often so I don't know what's good around here, but I was in the mood for a egg and cheese sandwich so that was what I was looking for. I passed by the Zaro's breakfast bar but couldn't bring myself to pay $9 for a breakfast sandwich so I walked away. Good thing I did, because I then found myself in front of the Tri-Tip Grill and their breakfast menu. I ordered their breakfast sandwich on an English muffin and medium rare Tri-Tip. It was quickly made and to my happy surprise, they included tater tots along with the sandwich!! The sandwich itself was delicious. Can't go wrong with meat, egg and cheese! My only complaint is that even though the cashier made sure to ask me how I wanted the Tri-tip, what I ended up getting in my sandwich was pretty well done. But it was still very very tasty so I won't hold it against them!FYI: even though their menu said breakfast was only available Mon-Fri, I was there on a Saturday, and they were serving breakfast.",,,
49,Henry R.,"Hobe Sound, FL",3,10,1,1.0,11/1/2015,"I THOUGHT - and the store signage lead me to believe - that I was buying a ""Philly Buck"" sandwich that would be a ""Philly Cheesesteak"" style sandwich.Instead I received a bun with sliced meat, peppers, onions and cheese that was simply heated under a heat lamp.BIG FAIL !I feel deceived.  And unhappy.No manager was on duty and the cashier didn't seem very interested in my complaint.  Her reply to my polite comments was ""the onions were grilled?""Huh ?",,,

53,Sharon L.,"Flushing, NY",25,86,180,4.0,10/11/2012,"I stopped by Grand Central Terminal for lunch yesterday and was headed to Two Boots for pizza when a free sample of Tri Tip Grill's delicious tri-tip changed my mind! As I perused their menu, I noticed that their menu options are very similar to the menu at Buckhorn Grill which I tried (and loved!) on a trip to SF. A quick search on my phone confirmed my suspicions-- Tri Tip Grill is a NY franchised version of Buckhorn Grill. The chef and owner of Buckhorn Grill got his start selling his famous tri tip sandwiches at a chefs' market in Napa Valley. Tri Tip Grill's namesake is a cut of beef from the bottom sirloin and while it is just as flavorful and lean as top sirloin, it is less tender and therefore requires slower cooking times. Previously, this cut was used for ground beef but its lower cost and versatility soon made it a popular choice for chefs. Tri Tip Grill advertises that they age their beef for 21 days, then rub it in a specialty marinade and seasoning before charring it over an open fire until medium-rare before finishing in a wood smoker and oven. The result is a roast that is tender and juicy with a flavorful, charred outer crust. The small sample I had was exactly that.. And I knew I had to have it! Tri Tip Grill's signature tri tip sandwich features a handmade artisan roll, thinly sliced tri tip, sweet caramelized onions, and their homemade au jus. The sandwich comes in two sizes-- Little Buck with 4oz of meat and Big Buck with 6oz of meat for only $1 more. Both sandwiches are 6"" long. The sandwich comes nicely packaged in a plastic box with the au jus in a separate container. I like the packaging because it kept the sandwich from getting soggy.I opted for the Little Buck and while I felt that it was a satisfying portion of meat, I did think that the meat to bread ratio was a little off. I had to discard chunks of bread to even things out. Next time I would get the extra meat. I was also a bit disappointed by the quality of bread. It wasn't warmed and at first bite, tasted like supermarket rolls. However, once it was properly dipped in the au jus, I had to admit that I spoke too soon. The bread was the perfect texture for soaking up all the delicious juices from the meat and au jus. It also held up to repeated dippings and kept my hands from getting too messy. The tri tip was juicy and tender and was perfectly tasty on its own but was closer to medium than medium rare. The outer crust reminded me a little of the crust you find on good quality pastrami. The sweet onions were equally delicious but I wish there was more of it. I liked that the au jus tasted light and clean-- it wasn't oily or too salty and allowed the flavor of the meat to shine. After a few bites, some might say that the sandwich becomes a bit one-dimensional but not me! I appreciate its simplicity and savored every bite. Service was quick and efficient, at least for those of us ordering their signature dish, and I got my food within 5 min. I can't comment on the poor woman before me who ordered salmon! I noticed that you can buy a whole tri tip roast for $23.. Sounds like it'd be perfect for a special occasion or for a quick weeknight dinner! Steak salad, anyone?",1,,1
54,Brooklynbaby R.,"Manhattan, NY",55,196,23,4.0,3/28/2015,Wow who knew grand central has a decent salad place.  For fast food this is pretty good for the price and quality.  Wednesdays they have upgrade day.  If you order any salad and they add the meat (steak) to it.  Really great for the price and the steak is actually good.,,,
55,Michael C.,"Hoboken, NJ",24,185,0,5.0,5/30/2012,"Oh man that Tri Tip is like butter.  Just absolutely perfect.  The crispy onions on the roadhouse buck just bring it over the top. I'm pretty full after the smaller size, but sometimes I'll spring for the bigger one.  I always read about the one in Rock center, but it was a little far to journey on my lunch hour so I was definitely excited about this one opening up in Grand Central.  The lines have been short during my lunch time visits there and the flashing buzzer is convenient for picking up your order.  And lately they've been running $5 specials on the small size (different sandwich each time).  Good stuff.",4,1,1
56,Amber N.,"Perth, Australia",55,52,467,4.0,1/7/2015,"I had a yummy roll with thin sliced steak and au jus and I was so satisfied. The meat was juicy and pink and the jus went perfectly.

57,Tami B.,"Brooklyn, NY",25,42,88,4.0,2/4/2012,"Can you say mmm mmm good? Now imagine saying it between bites of perfectly cooked medium and/or medium rare steak accompanied by red mashers (drizzled lightly with gravy) and broccoli w/ garlic...that's what I did during my lunch the other day and I gotta tell you; my co-workers stared at me like I had six heads. They could see the wonderful goodness that it was BUT could not taste it (poor creatures) and I wasn't trying to share. This was one of those ""you've got to get your own"" situations!!I ordered the Char-Roasted Sirloin Tri Tip Platter that comes with 8 oz. of sliced tri tip steak and it's served with red mashers (red skinned mashed potatoes), GRAVY (which they were kind enough to put in a small condiment cup with lid) roasted veggies (I chose broccoli), bread and butter (which I gladly gave away because the calorie count from those mashers put me over the edge). The price for my platter was only 12.95!!! Not bad at all.Do yourself a favor and try it. I haven't had the chance to try anything else on the menu but my colleagues were pleased with their sandwiches...so I'll keep you updated when I try something new and I plan on it people!",10,4,4
58,Casey F.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",1,8,0,2.0,6/24/2012,"UPDATE: I received a personal e-mail from the owner of Tri Tip Grill regarding my experience. In it, he made a very sincere apology and he also explained that they use high quality ingredients. Many other Yelp! reviewers have testified to the quality of their ingredients - so my experience may have been an anomaly. The owner really cares deeply about the customer experience at Tri Tip Grill and I will be giving it another chance!Tri Tip Grill's business model in Grand Central Terminal is to catch people on the fly just one time, using the cheapest ingredients possible while charging outlandish prices. $6.00 for burnt tiny bacon, a slab of cheese, a rubber egg, squashed between burnt sliced bread--all buttered and mashed flat to tasteless dorm room style perfection. They even got the coffee station layout wrong. No trash can, no counter space = can't put cream and sugar in without professional juggling skills. In fact the sugar packets were covered in black grime inside what looked like a dusty fish bowl. My understanding is that they have other establishments in NYC. I will never go there after the crap they pulled on me in Grand Central. I don't care how good people say it is.",1,,
59,Vanessa S.,"Coral Springs, FL",185,177,90,5.0,1/5/2014,"Found this place while aimlessly wandering in Grand Central food court. I was undecided, but as always- the yelp sticker lured me in. I had a regular Philly buck. Perfect portion, perfect taste. The tri tip was tender and cooked well. I love me a good philly cheese steak, & this deserves bragging rights!! Will definitely be back again!!",2,2,3

Updated review","I gave Tri Tip another shot after having a not so great experience.  I think my issue was a miss order, so my fault.  I'm man enough to admit it.  First time I tried to be somewhat healthy and ordered the chicken sandwich, which was good for what it was a chicken sandwich.  No bells and whistles, and not delicious tri tip beef which is what I got with Big Buck sandwich. Really quality meat, thinly sliced.  Big sandwich for $8, and the qaulity was there.  Salty, tasty beef, the au jus very delicious.  Sauteed onions really nice touch.  Reminded me of Chicago Italian beef sandwich which I am quite fond of.Should add after my first visit, owner sent me an email, which shows he cares about his business and customer opinion.  I was pretty blunt in my first review posting, but owner didn't take offense, so that scores extra points with me.  If you are in the market for a great beef sandwich, hit the Tri Tip you won't be dissapointed in the least.",,,
61,david l.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,5,0,1.0,4/5/2014,"I ordered a Tri Tip Steak Salad this past Friday.  They were busy and I was mesmerized as to how quickly they were filling orders and I thought ""they obviously know what they're doing"".  I had also noticed they proudly displayed their ""A"" Dept of Health rating and thought all was fine.I started eating my salad which was sufficient for a $10 salad in midtown, though 1/3 of the way through I found a toothpick with a red cellophane tip.  I thought ""wow-I better look further"" and I then found a broken toothpick with a piece of green chewing gum wrapped around it!!!!!!  I couldn't believe it, of course immediately felt sick, closed the lid and went back to Tri Tip.  I showed it to (who I believe was) the manager whose first response was ""show me your receipt""!?!?!?!?!?!  Fortunately I had the receipt, he then asked if the toothpicks may have come from the plastic pre wrapped utensil package they gave me..............I was astounded.  Only then did he apologize and tell the cashier to refund my meal.Clearly this place has BIG problems...........prospective patrons beware!!!!!!!!!!",1,1,
62,Paul B.,"Manhattan, NY",498,23,3,5.0,10/7/2014,Roadhouse buck all the way. Too good to miss out on! My 2nd time here... I'm worried I'm hooked. Most tender and juicy steak meat with the awesome crunchy onion strings is a lunch to die for. And if I eat this everyday I may suffer from high blood pressure... but all worth it. Doesn't help that I work around the corner. I may switch to trying their salads too.,,,
63,Jason Y.,"Beacon, NY",22,148,23,3.0,3/9/2014,I have had Tri-Tip several times for lunch at GCT and think they have pretty good sandwiches. I often get the chicken instead of the beef and it tastes like it's been cooked way in advance- it's not bad- just a bit dry sometimes. But I do love the chipotle sauce and the fact that they have horseradish available. Good fries as well.,,,1
64,Mike E.,"Union City, NJ",157,37,1,4.0,9/3/2012,"Hey all, I was pretty happy with this place. You can really tell the effort they put into preparing their sandwiches. I got a big buck platter with vegetables. The grilled veggies were delicious (although small in quantity). The beef itself had a rich flavor and the BBQ sauce they serve was smokey and sweet as well. You can add extra beef to the sandwich if you're really hungry, but for a quick work lunch the standard size is plenty! Try it out!",,,
65,Drew S.,"Marlton, NJ",0,31,0,1.0,12/6/2015,I was at Grand Central on Saturday and got the Tri Tip platter. I ordered the meat as served medium rare. I literally could not cut it with the plastic knife and fork. I had pick the meat up with my teeth and rip it apart. It was so tough that it was inedible. The only good part of the meal were the mash potatoes and grilled vegetables. The restaurant was fairly busy as Grand Central was jammed with people coming and going into the city for holiday shopping. Absolutely no excuse to serve meat like this.,,,
66,Jane R.,"Brooklyn, NY",749,559,71,4.0,7/18/2013,"I came here while waiting for the train. Definitely a new place in GC. I ordered a steak and onions sandwich (The Big Buck) with au jus which was about $10. However, it was pretty good. The meat was tender and juicy and just overall delicious. I could have made it a combo for an additional $3.25 (soda and your choice of side). I would definitely grab a sandwich from here again. And definitely a lot more filling and satisfying than the other options around (Junior's, smoothies? etc).",2,1,3

Updated review","I received an email from David K., the owner, apologizing for my dining experience. He offered me a free lunch to give them another try. I have to give Tri Tip Grill big props for taking ownership of their mistakes and making sure their customers are happy. I decided to give them another try today and I wish everything went smoothly this time around. Unfortunately I still ran into a problem. I ordered the Border Buck and when I got back to my office I realized they gave me a Big Buck instead. I was a bit annoyed but unfortunately I did not learn my lesson the first time around. I should have checked my bag to make sure I received the correct sandwich. I shouldn't have to double check to make sure my order is right but then again if I did there wouldn't have been an issue. I am guessing someone out there opened their bag and were ready to dig into a Big Buck but instead were stuck with the Border Buck. Having said that I found the sandwich to be much better this time and I enjoyed the fries. Overall the food is very good. Clearly they still have some growing pains since I am currently 0-2 on my order being correct. I would give management 5 stars for taking action, 4 stars for the food and unfortunately 2 stars for the ordering process and the fact I have yet to receive a correct order.  I would love to give 4 stars but that will have to wait until they get things ironed out at their Grand Central location.",,,
68,Todd R.,"Wake Forest, NC",48,5,1,5.0,10/19/2014,Ate the Bacon Cheddar Buck and it was wonderful. The meat was trimmed to small strips with piles of bacon and cheese. The sauce was wonderful.

69,Thomas C.,"New York, NY",113,7,0,5.0,10/27/2013,"I wish they had a tri-tip in every Manhattan neighborhood. The tri-tip steak is unique, unlike any other steak in the city. The sandwich combo with a side caesar salad is to die for. The ""Caesar Pleaser"" salad is equally good, with $20 worth of steak on top. Once I even got the take-home roast, which made everyone in my family very happy (And a great value at ~$20). Keep up the good work guys!

My sandwich was mosty onions and cold steak, the fries were excellent though.It's expensive for the size of the sandwich, but it's NYC and it's in Grand Central so what can you expect.

I was really surprised at how big it was and considering I almost paid $6 upstairs for a large bag of skittles (even too rich for my blood in a drunken haze) I'd say this place is a steal. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the steak I got in the salad was cooked medium well (still delicious) and the sample was medium rare (and much more tender), but you should definitely scope this place out!",,,

91,David W.,"Manhattan, NY",1,4,0,1.0,8/7/2012,"I used to love this place.  The past three times I've been here have been horrendous.   The employees are the worst imaginable.  Paying over $12 for a lunch, you'd think they could get something right, but they utterly fail.  Lets just talk about my most recent foray.Big Buck, no onions, combo meal.  I double check with the server (who has a VERY hygienic ponytail down to his ass - nice touch) to verify that there are indeed, no onions.  He takes a peek, says no onions.  Once I fight for a seat in Grand Central, I sit down and the first thing I notice - wow, onions.  So I give up my rightful seat and tell Mr. Pony Tail that I ordered a sandwich with no onions.  What does he do?  Picks through my sandwich WITH HIS FINGERS to remove one piece of onion, and returns my sandwich.  I politely ask him for a new sandwich, and he obliges.  What do I receive?  A half full sandwich full of grey chewy meat - not the pink tri tip beef I used to recommend to all of my friends and coworkers.  So horrible was this meal that I felt urged to create a Yelp profile just to complain.So to whoever owns or manages this location - you have a lot of improvement to work on.   The first two recommendations - introduce some basic level of quality control into your restaurants & hire competent employees.  Until then I don't know if I can bring myself to give you guys another dime.",,,

93,Nickey V.,"Newtown, CT",0,2,0,4.0,7/29/2013,"I've always had a soft spot in my heart for Arby's roast beef sandwiches, it must be the Midwesterner in me (JK no Midwestern roots). Although Despite my wonderful experiences with Arby's, I have rarely ventured into the world of Steak sandwiches. I tried ""Tri Tip"" for lunch today and it was phenomenal. Even though I went at a peak lunch time (12:30) , my meal was ready in less than 2 minutes. It is a little tough to find seating but once you do it's worth it because the sandwich is delicious. I had the ""Big Buck"" and the steak wasn't overcooked and the roll wasn't soggy (two problems the folks at 'bys run into time to time). Overall a great, quick lunch!!",,,
94,Stan P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,181,0,3.0,3/2/2012,"Tried the big buck, the border buck, and the tri-tip platter.  I find the platter to be much much better than the sandwiches, but my GF disagrees and thinks the thinly sliced beef for the sandwiches are much better.  We both agree that the bread is just blah.  And definitely do not get the chicken - dry and overcooked!  GF wonders if they will serve the thinly sliced beef on a platter...",,,
