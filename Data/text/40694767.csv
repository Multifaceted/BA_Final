0,Brittanny K.,"Brooklyn, NY",174,90,232,4.0,11/16/2018,"The New York luncheonette is that classic NYC diner that you see in the movies. At least that's what it reminds me of. It has every kind of comfort food and it's very good. Every time I come it's always packed so you know people like it. My co-workers and I frequent this place a lot when we want to get away and just relax to a nice comfort meal. Grilled cheese and chicken fingers are a classic choice we usually go with. They serve breakfast all day so the pancakes and bacon are a good choice as well! Try the omelette made to order as well!  In fact, they are some of the best pancakes I've had to be honest. Recently I tried the chicken souvlaki, which is an open faced pita with chicken, greens and tiziki sauce. So delicious! This is a great spot for lunch and although they can be busy the service is always mostly great! I'll be frequenting this diner for the days to come I just hope the secret doesn't get out too far! I like my little safe haven lunch spot!",1,1,1
1,Julian L.,"Navan, Republic of Ireland",3,3,2,4.0,11/12/2018,"Staying on 3rd. Walked past here on first night in NYC. Looked very busy but made a note to come back.When we returned, we weren't disappointed. Breakfast for 5 was $100 inc tip. Server was attentive, & the food came quickly despite a full restaurant & a fast moving queue.Returned for lunch/dinner. $140 inc tip for 5. Very reasonably priced. Again staff were very friendly, service was fast. Never felt rushed so they could turn over the table.Wish we'd eaten here earlier in our stay. Best place we've eaten in on the Eastside.",,,
2,Philippe L.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Canada",20,50,0,2.0,7/14/2018,"Went there on account of it being known for their breakfasts.  Scrambled eggs, french toast, sausages and coffee.  29$ with tip.This is by no stretch of the imagination a good breakfast place.  It's a very average place that churns out breakfasts quite rapidly.  How about an orange slice in there?  Everything on the plate is brown.Will not go again, there are other options.  Look again.",,2,
3,Trey W.,"Palm Springs, CA",0,74,55,4.0,10/17/2018,"Great spot to get breakfast/brunch. Fast service and good selection of ""traditional diner food"". Not fancy, just good food!  Eggs cooked PERFECTLY!!!!Gets busy on Sundays.",,,
4,Carmen H.,"Salt Lake City, UT",132,30,58,3.0,4/6/2018,"I'm staying at a hotel near by, passed this place and thought I'd give it a shot! The place had a lot of people and thought it would be a good place to stop for breakfast. We came in and were seated quickly even though people were waiting. (I think it was because we were 2 people) Their menu had a lot of great breakfast and lunch options. I ordered a egg, bacon and cheese on a bagel with home fries. The food came quickly and it was delicious. Our server was very nice and came to refill our water whenever it was empty so he was aware. All of that was great. The only negative thing that I didn't particular enjoy was at the end. I was almost done with my meal and other servers kept passing by pointing our checks like they were rushing us to go when we didn't even finish our food yet. I would understand if we were done and just talking but that wasn't the case.",1,,
5,Amy B.,"Bethesda, MD",29,61,6,5.0,6/3/2018,"This little restaurant was exactly what we were looking for! After sleeping in (if you can call 7:45 sleeping in) and logging a short run to, through and back from Central Park, we wanted to fill our tummies with some good old fashioned diner food. We'd spotted New York Luncheonette on the way toward the park and decided to give it a try after burning some calories. The place is amazing; it's very small but the friendly waiters can turnover a table quickly without making the diners feel like they are unwanted or being rushed. By my estimate, we waited for only 5-ish minutes for our table. We ordered coffees and egg dishes for our mid-morning breakfast. I'm very picky about my eggs. Please don't serve me anything egg-like that is goopy, runny, wobbly or otherwise partially cooked unless you want to see me gag vociferously. I asked for a mushroom and swiss omelette cooked extra well with potatoes and rye toast. My boyfriend ordered an egg sandwich on a bagel with potatoes on the side. We may have waited 7 minutes (if that) for our food to be served and sipped our coffee in the meantime.Upon arrival, my eggs were browned accordingly...just the way I love them! The potatoes were nicely seasoned and had peppers and onions mixed into them. The toast was, well, it was toast. But it also wasn't burnt or under toasted. My guy polished off his breakfast and was VERY pleased with it.The luncheonette is a simple, no frills place. But it's perfect for that anytime quick meal when you're looking for very good food very fast. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town.",1,,
6,Nicole V.,"Ozone Park, Queens, NY",3,23,22,3.0,10/29/2018,"If you're not super hungry, I'd take the time to find somewhere else to eat. The food wasn't anything to brag about but that's expected with diners. This one was a bit expensive. I could go to Sweetgreen for the same price of their cheese omelette. The hostess was sweet but my waiter sucked. The guy rushed us the whole time, and I wouldn't say he was rude but he certainly wasn't nice. He placed the check mid-way into finishing my food so I held onto it until I was ready to leave. I hate being rushed. There wasn't much people around or coming in while I was there.",,,
7,Natalie H.,"San Antonio, TX",3,46,79,4.0,9/12/2018,Chicken parm was a big portion and freshly breaded chicken. Friendly attentive staff. Kid friendly and the menu option is endless. I will def be back to order breakfast at dinner. The omelette looked amazing.,,,

9,Nick R.,"Skokie, IL",157,201,69,5.0,2/6/2018,This place is everything!! Made my visit to New York complete to be in a proper and classic New York City diner.  It was especially charming during the Christmas season. Sat at the counter just for the feel! I had a Reuben sandwich with fries and it was delicious. My girlfriend had an omelette with hash browns everything tasted great. The staff was friendly. Very comfortable place to hang out.

Breakfast served all day.After another job interview I was starving and had not eaten much so I found this diner close by as I really needed coffee and eats. Nothing like some pancakes and a hot cup o' joe to fill your tummy and hit the spot.Nice service, plenty of seating, and clean looking. Standard solid diner fare.

16,Lia O.,"Hackensack, NJ",0,13,0,1.0,8/8/2018,"I've read the reviews and it appears that the dine-in service is radically different from their delivery service which is appalling.  Twice I've ordered from this restaurant for delivery, the most simplest of food: a grilled cheese sandwich - plain ole white bread with plain ole American cheddar and bacon - only for the order to be screwed up even though the correct order is CLEARLY labelled on their delivery slip which is attached to the order!  Last time I order delivery from this place.",,,

She kept it simple with a bagel and cream cheese and an orange juice.

Updated review","Many, many thanks to New York Luncheonette for staying open during the blizzard of January 2016.  Despite nearly 30 inches of snow and a city-wide travel ban, the diner stayed open all day.  We were stuck in NYC (flight cancelled) at the DoubleTree with no-where to eat -- except here.  We had a great dinner and great service under the worst possible conditions.Thank you so much!  We always come here for breakfast in New York City, but now love this place even a little bit more.",2,,
35,Sam W.,"Houston, TX",95,351,198,4.0,1/3/2017,This place is not that fancy but pretty much a go to NYC deli.  The food is not all that great but dependable.  It's pretty much your standard deli menu.  It is also affordable.  We ate here several times on our recent trip to NYC because it was close to the hotel and affordable.,1,,

49,Rohan K.,"Issaquah, WA",380,527,121,1.0,3/26/2015,"We stopped here for breakfast because it was next to our hotel. BAD IDEA.Our server asked us whether we would like coffee or juice even before we took off our coats and while it seemed nice of him at the time, I later found out that they had been billed at $5.50 for each tiny glass. What a rip off.The breakfast itself was extremely mediocre. The potatoes were flavorless and dry, clearly frozen and reheated multiple times, the bacon and sausages were greasy, the fried eggs were very undercooked and the Spanish omelette was bland with no seasoning whatsoever and some store bought salsa poured over it from a jar.Our server was not very friendly and seemed more keen on turning tables quickly. He dropped a knife and fork on me along with some food and didn't even bother to apologize. When I signed the check he picked it up before I was done and then angrily brought it back to me saying I should add a tip(which I would have had he not taken it before I was finished).A very poor experience and pathetic food for unreasonable prices. I'm definitely not going back here again.",3,,

It's in a nice, tourist-friendly location, but this place definitely lives off of families staying in the nearby hotels.

59,Ron L.,"Boca Raton, FL",7,110,6,4.0,11/28/2015,"I don't want to oversell this fine restaurant, but I'd eat breakfast here any day of the week! The place is clean, the staff exceedingly friendly, and the breakfasts we ate were perfectly cooked. As an example, when I asked for very well-done bacon, I got very well-done bacon. My wife requested a well-done English muffin, and got it cooked perfectly. Me, I wanted it lightly toasted and it came out perfectly. This is even more impressive since the place was crowded and it would have been easy for the kitchen to ignore our requests.There are plenty of places to eat in this neighborhood, but many want you to either serve yourself or to wait in line for someone to take your order. The New York Luncheonette is a traditional style restaurant with waitress service that will get you your breakfast much faster, and it will be delicious to boot.Count on me to eat here again the next time I'm staying on the east side of Manhattan!",3,,

Seats here are in pretty close quarters, so I had to squeeze in between our table and the one next to us hoping I didn't knock anything over. It was a close call. Our server was very nice, and the food came out pretty quickly. I had the one egg platter which came with toast and potatoes. I would definitely recommend adding a little hot sauce or ketchup on top, but I was happy with my food and cleaned my plate.  Two of my friends had bagel sandwiches which looked good, and the other also had an egg platter. Beware of the orange juice -- it costs $5+ a glass (the cost of a meal here). My friend was shocked by the price, although she said it did taste pretty fresh.",,,

I was visiting from out-of-town and the concierge at a nearby hotel I was staying at recommended I go there for a nice brunch.First of all, my initial impression of the food was that it was horribly presented and plated. Seriously, I did not see ANY sign of effort put into making this food look more presentable. It looked like something I would sloppily throw on a plate when I'm cooking at home. The presentation wasn't just lacking, but it seemed like it was actually made to look unappetizing. I honestly can't recall another restaurant that put this little effort into their presentation. But fine, I am willing to forgo presentation for amazing food. However, the food was mediocre at best. My omelette was soggy and the ingredients were bland. The omelette lacked the balance between the eggs and the ingredients that would have made it tasty. My friend also noted that her pancakes lacked the fluffy texture that makes good pancakes good. Not to mention, most of the omelettes were priced at over $12 after tax and tip. With that type of pricing, I would have expected something much much better. Of all the restaurants I tried in New York during my trip (one of which was McDonalds), this was by far the worst. However, I will give it an extra star for the speediness of the service. Our food came very quickly and the ambiance of the restaurant was welcoming. I just think that they tried to take the theme of homestyle food a bit too far.",1,,

They brought me burnt tasteless pancakes, and a thin omelet with some weird sauce on it. The omlete was supposed to bring potatoes in it, which usually are fried and made with the omelet, but instead they were boiled and on top of the omelet. I would have not minded too much if this had been a cheap diner but I actually paid around $17 for a crap breakfast. I will not return and I will make sure whoever visits New York stays away.",1,1,
138,Barbi V.,"Hollywood, FL",106,9,2,3.0,10/30/2013,Food was out in record time. Can't be mad at that in this fast paced city. The food was average.,,,
139,Rachel K.,"Boston, MA",2,42,1,5.0,3/23/2015,"We stayed at the Kimberly next door and wondered in on Saturday morning. We were sat right away and decided to sit at the bar. Very friendly service and I was amazed how many people were working.  Sometimes I find that can be a bit much with everyone running into each other but they had a great system down here.  My husband had the lox and onions omelette and I had the french toast with bacon. I was a little worried once the french toast came as it had an orange tint but it was DELICIOUS. It tasted like fried dough.  My husband who's not a huge french toast fan even loved it. Bacon was nice and crisp.  For the area, prices are a little on the cheaper side. Coffee was delicious and definitely will return on our next trip!",,,

141,Vivian C.,"Baltimore, MD",0,15,0,2.0,7/30/2014,"Mediocre diner food at best. Zero effort goes into making the food look the least bit appetizing, as someone pointed out, and the food itself is just average. Omelettes we ordered were flat and had minimal ingredients, and were not cheap (about $15 each). Only good thing is that the service was fast and it's a relatively cheap sit-down option for midtown Manhattan. This place must get all the 4+ ratings from tourists who don't know any better. We only came here because it was close to Sloan Kettering hospital. Never again.",2,,
142,Shep F.,"Miami, FL",1,13,0,2.0,10/27/2013,Food is OK but too expensive. Much better deal at the Morning Star Cafe on 2d Avenue.,,,
143,Eddie S.,"New York, NY",0,61,5,5.0,1/29/2014,"Why 5 stars?  NY Luncheonette is EXACTLY what your classic NY diner should do. For what it is, they're perfect at doing it. Don't be expecting culinary wizardry.  I order a swiss omelet, it comes exactly like I ordered, it comes quick, and doesn't break the bank. You get turkey clubs here, sandwiches, maybe a Greek specialty, but that's it.  It's my go to lunch spot for a quick, cheap, consistent meal.",,,

145,Derek A.,"Barre, VT",50,280,7,3.0,10/18/2012,"Nothing particularly outstanding here, but a good, solid breakfast with well prepared basic menu of eggs, pancakes, etc.  Not worth going out of your way for, but if you are looking for an inexpensive, quick, reliable breakfast, you can't go wrong here.",,,
146,E B.,"San Diego, CA",0,55,0,5.0,2/28/2015,"Fantastic food & Excellent service. I was super impressed with Brisket Sandwich and Buffalo Burger. Very lean and not greasy. Been eating here 2 times per day, during my NY stay. Nothing else, I tried, is as good as this place.",,,

149,Henry H.,"New York, NY",110,93,0,5.0,1/30/2010,"This is an old school diner in every sense of the word. I'm lucky because it's basically right outside my apartment so I can come here a lot and man is the food good. Everything you used to get at diners can be found here. I recommend their bacon if you have a hangover (or just like bacon) and their eggs. There's nothing better than going down here after a long sleepless night to get some eggs, hash browns, and corned beef hash.",1,1,
150,Alex B.,"Miami, FL",176,73,58,4.0,9/20/2012,Breakfast was good and quick. Staff was super friendly. Pretty good place for a quick breakfast on the east side. Will defiantly return.,,,

152,Michael C.,"Burlingame, CA",102,103,13,3.0,7/9/2012,"Went here for a quick lunch in Manhattan and I felt it was just pretty average.  The prices were reasonable but not great.  The quality of food was reasonable and the portions were pretty good.  If I was very hungry and this was the only place that was open, I'd go back.  Otherwise there are more than enough good places in Manhattan that you shouldn't be coming here.",,,
153,Tim S.,"Gary, IN",4,31,4,4.0,10/16/2012,We felt we were lucky to find traditional breakfast food near our hotel! Great food and service...over priced like everything else in this city. They try to rush you in & out and keep a quick turnover....just be aware...but we were OK with it.,,,
154,Rob O.,"Clarks Green, PA",0,8,0,4.0,4/6/2013,"""I have been here twice for breakfast. The omelettes are consistently good. I had the California Omelette this morning. Avocado in it. Yummy! Very fast service. Typical NYC. A little small and tight. But it is mid town Manhattan.""",,,
155,ashley S.,"New York, NY",119,149,4,4.0,1/30/2010,"This is a little diner in midtown. It's a classic diner, lots of tables, classic counter, and plastic menus. It's always busy but rarely do you have to wait for a table. It's breakfast all day there so it's a good place to go to kill a hang over. The food is good food, it's not spectacular but it's satisfying. The service is great and the food comes quickly. I've had the turkey club which was good. This morning I had ham and cheese omelet. It was good and just what I needed to kill my hang over from last night. If your in the area and are looking for a classic diner to eat at - this is a place to stop. I just wish they had booths - I like booths when I'm hung over and eating.",,,

157,Janet L.,"La Puente, CA",3,14,0,4.0,6/7/2014,"We had dinner here on Memorial Sunday 5/25/14.  We have been New York sightseeing for few days and the very last time in New York my sister felt sick so we just ate at this place because our hotel is very close by.  I always like the family style restaurant compare where my sister and brother likes the ""fancy"" place we have been dinning the last few day.  The Chef's Special sounded good so I ordered the grill salmon, my brother ordered the BBQ, and my sister ordered the salad.  Each entree came with a large portion and just like other family style restaurant ""no fancy"" food.  I really enjoyed.  I have been eating the ""expense"" food last few days, from Jean Georges in Trump Plaza to Peter Luger Steak House.  But I like this food the most.  I enjoyed the casual atmosphere and down to earth food.  Maybe this just fit my style.  I hope my sibling will not be reading this one since they paid a lot for me on the other ""fancy"" restaurants we have been dinning the last few days.",,,
158,Tony U.,"Oakland, CA",318,995,876,2.0,10/22/2009,Nothing memorable about this place; was in a hurry prior to going to the airport.  I could pretty much repeat verbatum what Shane L. posted.,,,
159,Theresa C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,186,0,4.0,7/2/2012,My husband and I met here for breakfast on a Friday morning.  The place was packed but they fit us at the counter and right away we were given the fasted and nicest service I've had in a while.  My omelet was amazing and the coffee was fresh.  The only negative thing i can say was that i ordered wheat toast and they gave me white.  It wasn't a big deal so I just ate it and I would definitely come back for more!,,,
