0,Frank H.,"New York, NY",0,16,0.0,5.0,10/14/2018,"Great chicken wings. I might go so far as to say they are the best chicken wings I've ever had. Crunchy on the outside, nice and moist on the inside, a wide variety of great flavors to choose from. What else would you want from a chicken wing. Slightly pricey but worth it. My favorite flavors are Hot and the monthly rotating flavors. Kinda bummed they got rid of the onion rings though.",,,
1,Ginette P.,"New York, NY",517,988,6100,2.0,11/12/2018,"After having drinks in the area we wanted to grab a bite to eat, we were close enough that we could smell the fried wings so we decide to give it a try. Pretty small place we were lucky to find an open table, once seated we placed our order. First problem we placed our order & it took over 20 minutes which was not fun since we noticed others after us got their food before us. We got 10 wings plus an order of the tater tots Flavors are super limited, We got Honey BBQ & medium wings ... now for as many great reviews as this place has I'd expected something better.  Wings were not perfectly fried & kinda chewy which was disappointing. The Tater tots were great nice taste perfect when dipped in the extra sauce & ketchup.  Not really sure what all the hype is about here, barely any flavor choices & the tater tots outshine the wings. Slow service, pricey wings for what u get.",6,,2
2,Christina G.,"New York, NY",320,431,540,3.0,11/4/2018,"Spot has been on my hit list for a while. Was a bit underwhelmed. Tried regular wings in the hot and spicy bbq. The wings were very crisp on the outside, but lacked sauce on the hot. The spicy bbq were saucy and much better. We also got an order of large tots. These could've been cooked a bit more. The middle was very mushy. Prices are pricey for wings and beer.",1,,
3,Adri P.,"New York, NY",283,177,129,2.0,10/26/2018,"Ben heading the hype about Dan and Johns for awhile. Was in the neighborhood and saw this location. Decided to eat in. The wait time for the wings took over 20 minutes. We were starving, so it felt like eternity. Several people that ordered after us got their orders before ours, which was frustrating. Finally got our food. It looked delicious. Tater tots were great. But the wings left a lot to be desired. They weren't fried crispy and they were super chewy -- not tender. Unfortunate. The sauces were good. We ended up dipping the tots in the sauce and leaving the chicken behind. Such a waste, especially for the price.",,,
4,Diana B.,"New York, NY",82,56,199,5.0,8/16/2018,I am a huge fan of hot wings and when I stumbled upon this place while around the east village I had to try them. Their wings are amazing!!! It's so hard to find good wings in the city but they have nailed it. I ordered the hot wings and they came perfectly doused in hot sauce. The wings were tender and cooked very well. The staff are friendlyThey have a few tables and seats at the bar so if your lucky to grab a seat you can enjoy them in the restaurant. If you want them to go you can also order them next door. The staff are friendly and if you love wings definitely check this place out!,2,,

6,Arianna B.,"Wellington, New Zealand",441,16,3,3.0,10/16/2018,"The wings are meaty and not overly fatty. Got a platter of two wet sauces: medium buffalo and spicy bbq. (Both my friend and I preferred the buffalo) Skin had a little crisp which was nice. Tater tots were you standard cafeteria tots. I didn't love the blue cheese sauce, kind of akin to the texture of mayo and not super flavorful. Overall, not the best wings but a solid overall spot for lowkey sports bar and a roll of paper towels on every table. Also gotta love that some of the staff are native Buffalonians.",1,,
7,Leng Leng Y.,"Manhattan, NY",56,23,141,4.0,10/14/2018,"Food: Great wings with numerous choices of tasty sauces! Must say--one of the best wings I have had in NYC. Loved the assortment from spicy to non-spicy options! Another plus is that the price is right! Great option for lunch or dinner!Drinks: They do have a beer of the day special which was like $4-5 for a can of beer. Can't go wrong with beer and wings!Service: Quick and prompt service! Can't complain there!Vibe: Small and cozy sitting place. It's great for casual dining and hanging with small group of friends or great for take-out. Although I went during their non-peak lunch hours, I appreciated the clean and tidy environment.",1,,
8,Carla C.,"New York, NY",506,108,3,5.0,11/4/2018,Stopped by Dan and John's to try out their wings. We got the spicy bbq and buffalo wings with a side of tater tots. The wings and tots were great! The wings were sauccccyyy and the tots were crispy. Highly recommend!,,,
9,Avita S.,"Redwood City, CA",243,121,228,5.0,5/16/2018,"One of the best wings I've had. My boyfriend discovered this wing place the last time he visited New York and what a wonderful discovery. He usually doesn't like Buffalo sauce but Dan and John's has changed his mind.I won't start with directions since I'm not from NY nor do I live there but I know we took about a 10 minute walk to get here. It's pretty tiny place with limited seating, so it's more of a take out kind of place. The wings are drenched in sauce but still really crispy and the meat is juicy. We get the mild and medium buffalo sauce. We also tried the BBQ and that was okay. I was only in NY for 10 days but had the chance to eat it 3 times and 2 of those times was twice in a day pre- and post- Raclette. Here I am in SF and I miss Dan and John's.",2,2,2
10,Dimitric H.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",61,115,154,5.0,5/23/2018,"Great amazing wings, they offer a variety of traditional buffalo sauces which are placed along a 'heat' range which is standard. Along with two BBQ flavors. Fries were also on point also the tater tots were great. I think the standout is how they manage to cook to order, this is the reason why the quality is kept at a high standard.I'm so happy that they decided to expand the space creating a intimate sports bar environment. Smart move on them. On my visit I think the owners 'Dan and John were serving customers at the bar, they were great and gave amazing service. Very cool people. I will be back again for sure.This is my new favorite wing spot currently. 5 stars",2,1,1

Updated review","Funny as a follow up I went directly to the site, mind you I did not mention our previous altercation and I must say that the staff was super friendly. They must have been really busy that day. Unfortunately, the wings were good but nothing to really be excited about. Is the same level as atomic wings.",,,
12,Bryan Patrick S.,"New York, NY",207,28,4,5.0,9/15/2018,"The Short: The best wings I've had in NYC to date, and the most authentic ""Buffalo"" experience. The Long: After a recommendation from a fellow Buffalo ex-pat, I tried this place out. It's a small spot on 1st Ave. that is easy to pass by given the number of options in the East Village, but it's simplicity is part of its charm. A few tables, a few barstools; it's roomier than it lets on from the outside. A large group wouldn't fit in here, but one person or a few buddies will find a place to sit when it isn't packed rather easily. Upon entering, it's easy to see this is the real deal. A metal buffalo head statue is mounted on the wall near beauty photos of wings, opposite a neon sign for Labatt Blue (which IS on tap aside beers more familiar to New Yorkers). Bills and Sabres decorations are scattered. Sports on the TVs. A no-frills listing of menu items. ""Brick"" back wall. This evokes many a wing joint from Buffalo very quickly.  The place is set up for ordering quick takeout, with a section of the bar devoted to ordering and pickup. Paper towels are smartly placed at every table or seating area, as are ketchup and salt & pepper for the fries. An extra paper boat is handed out with each order for the bones. These guys know the wing eating experience.Most ""flavors"" were simply how hot one wanted their wings, with a few extra options of BBQ and a ""flavor of the month"" mixed in.I ordered a Combo with traditional Medium wings and tater tots. The wings were fantastic, and I'd say they would rival some of Buffalo's top offerings if put side-by-side. They were perfectly fried, beautifully sauced and decently sized. The tots were also perfectly crispy. And they offered blue cheese on the side! (Yeah, sure they offered ranch as well, but come on. Blue cheese is the correct way to eat wings.)My only critique would be the size of the order; combos start at 5 wings with no simple way to upgrade to 10 without ordering a completely separate order of wings. Staff was very attentive to the customers and the cleanliness of the eating areas. This is the real deal. If you want a taste of Buffalo or just a REALLY good chicken wing, Dan and John's are the way to go.",,,
13,Demi H.,"New York, NY",6,69,52,2.0,8/16/2018,"Dan and John's Wing's is known as the best wing place in NYC. My boyfriend and I HAD to check them out. We were looking forward to dinner here for the whole week, when we finally came on a Wednesday night our hopes were SO high. We came at about 9:00pm on a Wednesday, it was pretty busy. Which was a good sign. The gentleman who took our order was very nice and friendly. We ordered 20 wings & fries. He helped us pick out a few flavors: BBQ Spicy, BBQ Sweet, Medium and Flavor of the week Teriyaki (although he said they normally have ""better tasting"" flavors of the week). The price wasn't bad, $36 for 20 wings, fries and two waters.Unfortunately, my boyfriend and I were soooo let down!! At first look, the presentation was appealing, but I thought the wings we received were a little on the small side. Once we began eating them, we weren't that pleased. There was SOO much sauce on the BBQ (spicy & sweet) flavored wings - they were basically drenched, it was over powering and kind of gross. Meanwhile, the medium buffalo was basically dry. The Teriyaki flavored wings had a lot of sauce as well, but it was bearable and very flavorful. The fries were just FINE, nothing special, maybe I should have ordered the tator tots which seem to have a lot of hype.Honestly though, I was looking at a few pictures and none of the wings look as drenched in sauce as our order. It may have been a simple mistake which happens.Overall, I'm happy I tried it but I'm still on the search for the best wings in NYC.",2,,
14,Jenny C.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",121,295,367,3.0,8/14/2018,"I've bookmarked Dan and John's Wings for the longest time and was super excited to do my food adventure of the day around this neck of the woods. I like that the menu is simple and to the point. We ordered 5 boneless wings with sweet barbecue sauce on the side, as well as the combo (we opted for 5 traditional hot wings, tots, and a soft drink). It took what felt like around 20 minutes to finally get our food. Perhaps it felt extra long since the air conditioner either was not on, or was incredibly weak. Still it was better than eating outside I guess considering it was like 90 degrees out and super sunny. At least there is complimentary self-serve water. The seating area itself was very tight in terms on space. Don't come with a large group.Finally the wings. I thought the hot wings were good. I mean you can't really mess up buffalo wings in my opinion. The wings were big and juicy. Bold with flavor. The sweet barbecue sauce was delicious, but I wasn't a fan of the boneless wings... I definitely prefer traditional wings. The tots were tots, they were fried well but really nothing special.This spot is okay. I am not sure why the reviews are so glowing though. The wings are also pricey for what it is. Call me classless, but I rather stick with wings from bars and ale houses... same difference!",1,,
15,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",282,1524,1490,4.0,2/7/2018,"Stopped by here on a Friday night to satisfy a wing craving. Extremely tiny spot with some ledge seating for those who want to stay.Menu is simple and to the point. Ordered the 10-piece traditional wings ($14ish), a side of tots ($6ish), and a ginger ale ($2). Pricey for what it is; held out hope that it was overall worth it. Got the food within 15 minutes, and even managed to snag a seat while waiting. The heavily glazed wings come with celery, ranch, and a few wet naps (necessary). Great taste and juicy interior, was able to plow through all of it with relative ease. Tots were on the oily side; wish they had a smaller size for a reduced price (best to split).Service here is efficient and super-friendly; bumping this up to a 4 star review. Don't like spending over a dollar a wing, yet the quality is there.",3,2,3
16,Peggy W.,"New York, NY",529,185,191,4.0,7/18/2018,"Delicious wings packed with flavor, with spiciness levels that meets everyone's taste.I'm always surprised by the lack of good wings in NY. I do quite enjoy Buffalo Wild Wings but am unwilling to make the trek to Time Square on my own will. I've walked by Dan and John's Wings a few times and finally decided to give it a shot on a Sunday afternoon. I'm glad I was able to find a solid go-to wing spot for the future. My boyfriend and I shared 20 wings (10 spicy BBQ, 10 hot), fries and tots. The wings were definitely larger than I expected, so we ended up finishing ~16 between the two of us. You can pick different flavors of wings in intervals of 5. The spicy BBQ was good (super saucy), and the hot was as to be expected but nonetheless a solid option. They have an extra extra hot flavor (""inferno"") that I'd consider trying at some point just for laughs. The fries and tots were both really solid, although I'd go with tots if I had to pick between the two.The employees were super nice and the service was good, but it took a while for the food order to cook. There's also ~3 small/medium TVs to catch a game.",1,1,

Updated review",Better experience Tuesday @ 5pmDifferent guy (solo) but was pleasant unlike dude who answered the phone the other day. He took my order and prepared it. I was the only customer present. Order 5pc hot traditional  ($8.27) wasn't actually hot and a small fries ($2.75).,3,2,2
18,Jessica H.,"New York, NY",157,28,23,4.0,10/8/2018,I can't believe I never knew this was in my hood.The wings are suck the bone dry delicious. They don't get a 5 because it's a bit expensive and I wish they had a happy hour wing deal.,,,1
19,Ivan K.,"Manhattan, NY",68,74,455,4.0,11/8/2018,We tried the medium buffalo and naked wings. Wings were of high quality and crispy. Buffalo sauce wasn't the best I've had but OK. Wish the had another sweet option like Thai Chili.,,,
20,Paalika B.,"Scottsdale, AZ",241,280,348,4.0,7/6/2018,So good! I've had both traditional and boneless and they are amazing! I love that they have a variety of sauces including seasonals. They expanded this place so it is no longer a tiny whole in the wall. 10 wings for $16 is quite pricey - not worth it to splurge every time I am craving wings.,1,,1
21,Joseph M.,"Seattle, WA",12,40,16,5.0,10/12/2018,We got the 50pc flavor of the month and hot wings. The wings were very good and the price was very reasonable. First time visiting this place and it's one of my favorite place.,,,

23,Eric Y.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",521,145,1453,4.0,12/1/2017,"Having lived in Buffalo, NY for a nice chunk of my life, I lost something when I moved back to NYC. I've come to realize that I had moved way too far away from Duff's or Anchor Bar. To this day whenever I'm traveling to or through Buffalo, I make sure to get wings at least once. The problem is that when I happen to crave Buffalo Wings, not much in New York City can really fully satisfy it; However, Dan and John's wings is probably the closest I've come to quelling my deep hunger for wings.Dan and John's is a simple wings shop, primarily focused on flinging the best wings coming out of any kitchen in New York City. As a heads up, I would definitely refrain from calling Dan and John's a restaurant, more like a stall with five or six seats. I also see a lot of people sitting by the tree in front of their shop. Although the space is tiny, they definitely bring a good wings recipe to the area.From what I can tell, the wings at Dan and John's are fried and then tossed in one of their many sauces (none of this baked wings BS). Their Buffalonian approach to cooking their wings results in a crispy skin with succulent wing meat, the bone meat will usually pull out clean from the flats. Although they seem to primarily focus on their normal buffalo wing sauce, ranging from mild to insane; I have also seen Dan and John's experiment with different flavors like garlic parmesan and bourbon bbq. One of my favorite non traditional wing sauce, is their spicy bbq sauce, which perfectly balances that spicy heat with subtle sweetness. On top of their wings I have also had their tator tots a few times, including the buffalo tots. Personally I felt that the buffalo tots, on top of eating buffalo wings were a bit too overwhelming. I try to stick to plain sides, using them to soak up some of the hot sauce at the bottom of the tray. Also don't be shy about asking for more sauce on the wings. Usually my friend and I like our wings to be really saucy, I usually ask for more sauce!Although nothing can compare to the wings at Duff's and Anchor Bar, Dan and John's has been the closest to capturing their essence in NYC. If you're a buffalo native and you're reading this, give Dan and John's a shot. It's the closest I've found to the taste of home. #Buffalove",7,2,3
24,Lindsay W.,"Brooklyn, NY",10,9,9,1.0,9/6/2018,Ordered at 7 PM and got an email thanking me for ordering directly so that the restaurant gets all the profit. (They aren't on Seamless) Called at 8:45 and was told it would be another hour until my food would arrive. Then was hung up on. Called back and was told my order had been refunded and canceled. And was hung up on again. So now it's 9 PM and I'm hungry with a canceled food order .... not cool Dan and John's. Maybe there's a reason restaurants are on seamless and share a little profit to offload the order/delivery work.,2,1,
25,Lilly T.,"West Islip, NY",26,21,44,4.0,8/28/2018,Delicious wings! The staff is so warm and welcoming. The guy who took my order was so cool and chill. He was great to talk to and gave great recommendations. We got the BBQ and ghost pepper/inferno one! The loaded tots were also good! They were just okay and not out of this world but still deff recommend it! Great spot!,2,1,5
26,Ryan H.,"Buffalo, NY",100,3,1,5.0,7/21/2018,"I wish there was an option for six stars. I have to admit I am originally from Buffalo so when I heard the two owners were from the homeland I had to give it a try.  Being from Buffalo, NY has made me into sort of a ""wing snob"" but I had heard good things about this place since I moved into the east village. The wings did not disappoint, not for a second.  I ordered 6 sweet barbecue and 6 hot. Both were phenomenal. Perfect amount of crispness as you bite into the wing and tender, juicy meat as you bite through it. The sauces were on point as well.  If you've ever been to Buffalo their hot sauce reminds me a lot of the world famous Duff's. The rest of their food is bomb too. I've had their tater tots and their chicken finger sub. Honestly you can't go wrong at this place.  And for you western New Yorkers or Canadians reading this... they have Labatt on tap. One of my favorite places in the East Village.",,,

Both are great and not very spicy. When I visit New York, I come here at least twice cause it's the best buffalo wings I've ever had.

The menu includes traditional & boneless wings, as well as subs and chicken tenders. Lots of beer options, too. The wait wasn't too long considering how many people were in the restaurant. It probably took around 20 minutes.If you live in the New York area or are just visiting, I would definitely recommend this place.",,,

Ordering in the middle and they are passing food across the counter. Menu is small, no frills just getting your fried wings of deliciousness. It's on the pricier side for wings, but they know what they are doing. I got take out (wings and tots) and had a bit of a drive back to the apartment. I was half expecting everything to be really soggy but I got home and the wings and tots were crispy as if I had ordered them in the bar. I tried calling ahead and placing an order while I was on my way over, but they have a pretty frustrating phone prompt system that makes it quite difficult to place a simple order to pick up. That would be my only suggestion to them, please fix!!! Other than that the food is pretty legit.",1,,

These wings are what wings need to be, all the time. You have wings and they dont resemble these, youre a joke.Crispy, saucy, exploding with flavor, everything a great wing should be by the tens or twentys. Today we went with the mild(my family doesnt eat hot like i do) and teriyaki. Now I usually dont like teriyaki, but gawwwwddddd damnnnn. These were something to stand up and applaud. Sweet, savory, unfortunately its only a flavor of the month- so go TODAY.Dan & Johns is up there w the top wong spots the city has to offer, theres no going back.Will be over here again soon enough!",6,1,

I straight up got Dan and John's the next day because IT'S THAT GOOD. I have a crush on these chicken wings. I want to start individual 529 college savings accounts for each chicken wing and each of the owner's children to put them through university. I feel pure love for this place. For real these dudes/employees of all gender are so sweet, and like maybe really high all the time, but I LOVE them and I LOVE this place. The wings? Wacky good. The specials? A DAMN TREAT.

After a few beers, I headed over to Dan and John's Wings for the main event. I ordered the spicey bbq and medium wings with ranch. The guys were cool and the wings came out pretty quick. Here's my complaint, the medium flavored wings weren't crispy at all and we're on the fleshy side and we're rather plain. The bbq spicey were def better.

47,Brian L.,"New York, NY",127,8,2,5.0,6/20/2018,"This is the platonic ideal of wings. I don't know why good wings are so hard to find in New York- maybe it's just that I've been unlucky. There also just a lot of completely mediocre places to eat in this city. Whatever, bottom line is that most wings I've had here are under the ""just fine"" category. But these? Aww man. I got the Inferno Traditional Wings. They were perfectly hot. I'm a bit of a heat seaker, but not too much. I don't like a case of the rumblies so I generally like the level below the hottest sauce on the menu. I asked what a person who likes a lot of heat should get and was told that that one was the one. It was perfect. PERFECT. You could perfectly taste the tangy saltiness of the Buffalo sauce, while also getting some series spiciness. A lot of places mess up that balance and all you taste is the hot pepper but I got a ton of flavor out of this. Granted, I started hiccuping immediately after I took my first bite but that's my own problem. After the third of fourth bite, I was used to the heat and it was a joy from there.The wings are fried beautifully too. They're at that ideal level where the outer layer is crisp while retaining all the sauce. It's not soggy. But it's also not fried too much. That's the cardinal sin of disappointing wings. They leave em in the fryer too long! Lay off, baby! These guys perfected the fry. The wings are also big. I usually don't feel like a 5 piece wing order is enough for a meal but these are substantial and I left totally full.Nice blue cheese sauce too! Really thick. More of a spread. I enjoyed it a lot. Just get the wings here. They're fantastic.",1,,

I was not disappointed!The staff was super friendly, giving me samples of their various sauces and reacting with respect when I started crying from the heat, they didn't shame me. They sympathized. ""That one really kicks it up a notch"" they said. Well bless them for protecting my pride.In all seriousness, Dan and John fry a delicious wing. The texture was perfect, the flavor was on point. What makes this place unique isn't just the many flavors of sauce or the care that is put into tossing the chicken. It's the people behind the counter.They did a couple things that showed me they really cared. First, while trying the sauces I spilled a little drip on my shirt. The man serving me noticed before even I did and handed me a moist towelette. It didn't end there. I left my backpack there, and they found my number in my journal and called me up immediately. I really appreciated that. Let me be clear. Doing the human thing and lending a helping hand is appreciated, but it's the wings that deserve the credit. I will certainly be returning soon.",4,,1

Today, we ordered their chicken fingers and French fries for the first time.

I try the wings pretty much everywhere I go, so needless to say I've had quite a few at this point. While I wouldn't say the ones here are without a doubt the best I've ever had they are high up in the rankings. I ordered the bone-in with the inferno sauce and was very impressed. Great flavor, nice heat (though not what I would consider inferno), and an excellent crispiness to the outside of the chicken. This spot is definitely a little pricey, but as far as standard buffalo wings go I think you'd have a hard time finding anything better. There's pretty much no seating, so plan on doing takeout if you're with more than one person.",1,,

If you love wings then you need to give this place a chance. I tried their boneless and their traditional wings (all flats), and they were perfect.

The man with the beard working the counter was so kind and attentive while making sure we knew everything about the menu.We ordered the 20 pack of boneless wings with 4 sauces (mild, medium, bbq sweet, and flavor of the month honey mustard) and a side of tots. I love that the boneless are the same price as the regular wings. The boneless have the perfect amount of breading and crunch without compromising the meat portions. The order of tots was HUGE and totally justifies the price. Tots for days. My only complaints would be that their blue cheese dressing seemed oddly mayo-y in texture and the honey mustard was more like a honey mustard bbq instead of a normal honey mustard.

75,Amanda H.,"Brooklyn, NY",82,122,4,2.0,9/5/2017,"This is the kind of review I hate to write, because I believe in my heart of hearts that Dan and John's Wings are probably delicious. It's hard to tell, though, because the handful of times that I've ordered from here something's gone wrong. For example, a couple months ago they just forgot half of the order. They said they'd make it for me, but I'd have to come pick it up. More recently, we were hosting a fantasy football draft party at a nearby bar, and ordered in advance for wings to be delivered at 2:30pm. I get a call at about 1:50 from the delivery guy telling me that he's there waiting for me -- we're not even at the bar yet, so he tells me he'll just come back. We arrive around 2, get set up, and the delivery shows up at about 2:40. Of course, this isn't a new order, our wings had just been sitting around in a delivery bag for nearly an hour, so everything is kind of lukewarm and mushy. Meh, for sure. I guess I'd order from them again if I was planning to go into the shop myself, but hard pass on the delivery. They also recently got rid of their vegan wings, which was a big selling point when we were hanging with vegetarian friends.",4,1,1

I  was in the area and craving some wings so we went to their actual store in the east village. It's a small place, mostly people for take-out but they do have a small bar seating by the window. My boyfriend and I weren't in a rush so we ate the wings there. I prefer traditional wings compared to boneless but we ordered a 10 piece bonesless, which came out to about $14.00 and that is a little on the expensive side for me with no drink or fries as a side. You are able to choose two different flavors when you order a 10 piece or more, so we got half Mild and half Sweet BBQ. The wings themselves had a nice flavor to it, I don't normally eat boneless but they were good. I preferred the Sweet BBQ over Mild and I usually love Mild but the sauce wasn't my favorite, I've had better mild sauces. Im going to come back and try the traditional wings with sweet bbq and see how it is.This place would get 5 stars if they weren't so expensive as well. The staff was nice and the food was good, but $14 without drinks and a side is too much for me.",2,1,2

My family and  I all agree that they're all delicious.  Buffalo wings are not all about heat. Anybody can slap some hot sauce on chicken. The wings have to be crispy. The sauce has to be flavorful and spicy if that's the way you like it.  This place fires on all cylinders.  Service was quick and accurate.

No frills and nothing distinguishing.For over a dollar a wing and basically no interior (tiny place just enough to sit, we actually ate on the ordering counter), I expected the wings to be top tier. They were good but merely that. I ordered the insane hotness wings. They were hot but not the hottest I've had by a long stretch. Blue cheese dip was good but nothing special. Included celery was fresh. As a fan of wings, nothing will draw me back here and the no frills experience certainly won't. My friend pointed out there was a big bowl of wings in the back, indicating they were refrying. I can't attest to that, but the wings didn't seem particularly fresh. The sauce was hot and peppery but notdistinct in any way. I liked the all black and interior and how small the menu was.

82,Ruwan J.,"New York, NY",376,678,30534,5.0,3/2/2016,"FINALLY, there is a legit BUFFALO WINGS joint in the east village (EV)! thank God! all hail Dan and John's Wings (DAJW)about 10 10 years, the buffalo wings scene in the EV has been TOXIC and IRRADIATED by various bars and fauxKwing (SeeWhatIDidThere) place that claim to be authentic, but end up trashing the perception and concept of wingz by churning out mediocre to terrible sauced chicken parts. BUT rejoice bc Dan and John's Wings have come to repair the damage and take wings to new heights. FLYYYYYY high.i discovered DAJW at Coney Smorgasburg this past summer, where i feasted upon their tater tots and wings. fast forward. they opened up a delivery/takeout wings slingin' joint downtown. FOOD?meaty crispy wingzzz at a variety of spice/pain threshholds. you can get traditional or boneless (go with the boned. keep it realzies. the boneless are good too, i mean who doesn't enjoy breasts au natural (SAY WHAT LOL) err i mean chikn breast meat!) both the traditional wings and boneless can be ordered in a variety of saucy flavors: Mild to Medium to Hot to Inferno to Insane as well as BBQ/Sweet, BBQ/Spicy, Garlic Parmesan, and Plain. for me, i like medium, but i am tempted to try the HOT and then maybe scorch my soul on INSANE in the future. however hit a nice sweet spot on Cayenne hot zone -- a nice amount of heat with an edgy curve of garlic, vinegar, and a host of secret ingredients i imagine). the wings and drumsticks have a nice amount of crispiness and meat to them. love the fat content, not greasy, and keeps the chicken from going dry or stringy. the wings are a perfect storm of flavor, savor, and spice. 5 wings ring up at $7 and change. a lil pricy, but you more than get your money's worth in terms of quality. BELIEVE.the tots? awesome. eat them while they are hot. endure the mouth-roof-burn. crispy, fatty. mmmm fried taters. and yeah you get a sauce to dip them in...i opted for bbq/sweet i think. these aint your average tots...they taste freshly made--meaning they don't come from an industrial sized bag of frozen foodery...and if they are...all places should source from said company bc the tots are the truth! you get a good-sized amount of tots--not mountainous, but nor a dirt pile either. just right. got commitment issues then these rings are for you! i'm talking about onion rings fool! the rings are crispy. breaded/coated perfectly. you can actually taste onion not just coating.  i think it comes with bbq/sweet dipping sauce, nice pairing. make ""erryday"" FRYDAY with these legit onion rings. if you get a 5 order of wings n drums plus the tots or rings...you are going to be more than full.tots and rings are totally shareable sizes OR you can glutton away and order both. i won't judge!i didn't hit the draaaanks (beer here) yet, but they had Six Point, Narragansett, and PBR by the can. good in my book. again this place isn't big, so it's not a substitute for your local beer bar, but grabbing quick bites and a beer would work. DAJW is primarily a takeout/delivery spot, so camping here for long periods would be problematic. they have soft bev's as well. though i wished they stocked CRUSH grape soda, for real!the space itself is smallish. counter is front and center for ordering. cans of beers that are available are lined up flush to the left. the draft tap is centered. and right behind the order counter is the tiny kitchen where the magic happens. there's a small amount of seating to the left of the entrance probably about six stools (total) that are flush to the front and left of the space where's there's an inset tabling raised that that hooks from the front around the left of the space. the staff is chatty. good-humored. really friendly. it's very casual and the upbeat energy there is natural not faked. so if wings are your thing...visit these Lawds of the Wings!drops mic bc my finger be sticky from this sauce.i out.zzz",43,44,41
83,John P.,"New York, NY",6,80,74,4.0,5/10/2018,"The wings here are good. No complaints about the food. Their prices are very high, which I sort of can understand because of the crazy rent they must have to pay.  An order of 10 traditional wings comes out to $16.01 (including tax). I am not complaining about the price. However, I was very turned off by having to pay $1.00 extra for a little cup of extra buffalo sauce on the side (maybe 50 cents for blue cheese or ranch dressing I can understand) on top of spending $16.00 for the wings.Advice to Management: If someone is paying $1.60 per wing, I think a little extra sauce on the side should be complimentary. At these prices, no one should have to pay $1.00 for a small container of extra buffalo sauce.  It is not about money, but about principal. Therefore, I will not be returning.",,,
84,Andrew B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",435,2,1,5.0,2/11/2018,"Delicious! Some of the best wings I've had in NYC. If you're looking for actual traditional style buffalo wings this is your place. As I was eating one of their traditional hot wings I proclaimed ""this tastes like the wings in Buffalo, NY"".  The owner then chimed in to say ""I'm from Buffalo"".  So that made a lot of sense. Both the flavor and the way that the wings are cooked(the right amount of crispiness) are accurately reminiscent of the wings in Buffalo, NY.  I also had the Lemon Pepper traditional wings which were delicious as well but had a much milder flavor in comparison to the ""hot"". They were also great and not over seasoned so it wasn't a sodium overload. I will say that the ""hot"" traditional wings were damn good.  They were very flavorful and savory although not very spicy, so if you're looking for more heat I would recommend stepping it up to the next level of spiciness. I also had the tater tots which were on point as well. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are only a couple of seats available so mostly it's a takeout joint. There is extremely friendly staff who believe in their food. The service was all together excellent. The food came within 10 minutes.

Somehow they keep the buffalo taste in all of the flavors! My favorite is the spicy BBQ which is just the right amount of buffalo and BBQ mix for me. There's also honey BBQ which is sweeter, original buffalo (which was too salty for me) and garlic. The garlic was a temporary flavor but extremely tasty and garlicy - We all agreed that they should keep it as a regular!",1,,
87,Jon S.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,647,1,4.0,1/30/2017,"Real nice wings, which I ate right out of the fryer on a Monday night. Like many of the small storefront restaurants in this part of the village, the space is tiny and poorly insulated. There's a space heater that heats up part of the space, along with the hat coming out of the kitchen.The wings are nice - not the jumbo kind some people are using - but a normal size and expertly cooked. I went with the monthly special, a bourbon dressing that was a mixture of tang and smoke. For a dine in customer, the price point can seem a bit steep. For 10 wings and a seltzer it was $17 (you are eating on a stool). With card swipe options requiring a tip of 15, 20 or 25% (or 0%) that means it's more than $2 a wing. Yes, this is New York, but that just feels a bit too much for takeout eating in the freezing weather.",2,,

Their buffalo flavors are solid as well. The wings are very large and cooked perfectly. Aren't dried out or covered in too much breading. This place has become a staple for my friends and I on game days. Wouldn't be a football game without some BBQ spicy wings from Dan and johns !",2,1,2
89,Christopher L.,"Chapel Hill, NC",168,6,0,4.0,9/27/2017,"Got: Two 10 piece, one boneless one bone in. Tried mild, hot, insane, and garlic Parmesan.Bone in is 5/5 - just the right amount of moisture without the sogginess, good size, easy to eat, texture is firm and nearly crispy on the outside and supple once you get to the chicken.Boneless is 3/5 at BEST. These little horse shit chicken nuggets were covered in soggy batter that was indistinguishable from the chicken. Mild: 2/5 - flavorless (what did I expect?)Hot: 5/5 - reasonable level of spice with a subtle vinegary kick and plenty of room to taste the nuances of the chickenInsane: 2/5 - tastes like vinegar. Shops usually use an obscene amount of sauce for their spiciest offering in order to be more extreme. This ruins any semblance of balance (believe it or not, extremely spicy food can be balanced..)Garlic Parmesan: 5/5 - fantastic. Just very well done - marriage between two of my favorite flavors and a well cooked wing",,1,

Wish I didn't have to write this review, because the food is awesome, but this is the third time I've waited 2 hours for a delivery (meaning it's over an hour late).

92,Will K.,"Portland, OR",139,84,111,3.0,1/18/2017,"With a strong craving for wings I ended up ordering on a Sunday night for delivery.  Background: the Steelers playoff game was later that day.  10 hot wings, 10 spicy BBQ, an order of fries, order done.  Flash forward 2 hours later and the food finally arrives!  Two hours is a bit ridiculous, even if it's before a quarter final game. In their defense they had sent me an email after I ordered warning we of this ridiculous wait time. Fine. I waited.  What finally arrived were tasty hot wings, mediocre spicy BBQ wings, and terrible fries.  The fries were a dead give away as to what had happened.  They were very soggy and almost cold.  Obviously the order had been prepared way before the delivery guy was ready for it.  Is there food good if you eat there or pick it up yourself? I don't know.  I'll never know.  What I do know is that they aren't good at timing their prep with their delivery.I am disappoint.",1,,2

95,Cynthia L.,"New York, NY",3,29,136,5.0,10/1/2017,"Being relatively new to the Wall St. area, I found choosing the right wings place a little trivial. The lower Manhattan is riddled with amazing spots to dig in on some BBQ chicken wings but this one has to be the perfect late night wings stop. I had the sweet bbq boneless chicken, which comes in a great serving. I can't explain how delicious the quality of the sauce is... you immediately get a rich flavor combined with the tenderness of the chicken. Also, the to go order is very well organized because I got my wings, a small side of celery, a dipping sauce of my choosing (blue cheese or ranch), a wooden pick for my pop chicken, and a hand wipe. Being the most complete combination of a take out, I felt the heartwarming quality of their service. 10/10 recommend if you're running around Astor Place!",,,
96,Kelly C.,"Brooklyn, NY",463,159,677,4.0,11/30/2015,"I tried these guys at Smorgasburg about 2 years ago and wasn't impressed. Maybe it was an off day but my wings were cold, undercooked and undersauced. Fast forward to now and I'm really glad I gave them a second chance at their new storefront because since then I've had some of the best wings ever and am totally addicted even though I'm not even a wing person. 5 wings are about $8, 10 for $13. They cook them fresh so be prepared to wait at least 5-10 minutes. When they get busy it can take 20+ minutes so plan your time. It's worth it - the wings are crispy (my number one gripe with most buffalo wings is the lack of texture...number two is where to wipe my hands) and juicy and have an appropriate amount of sauce. They have a sauce for everyone, from mild sweet BBQ to Insanity spicy. So far I've tried the three spiciest: Hot, Inferno and Insanity. Hot tastes like regular Frank's which is good for most people. Inferno is my preferred - I felt the burn but not overwhelmingly so. I'd give it a 7/10 in terms of spiciness, though my spice tolerance is moderately high. Insanity is definitely more of a challenge and I was done after a couple of bites - probably an 8.5/10. Side notes: French fries are great, they're always hot and fresh (almost too fresh, I've burned my mouth because I'm impatient) and they have wet wipes and paper towels (the Bounty kind, not thin useless crap napkins like other wing places) conveniently located in front of you so you don't leave with Buffalo Hands. They also have beer. Small place, 4-5 stool seats, take out/delivery available, open till 2 am for prime late night snacking. Best wings downtown for sure.",6,1,4
97,Jessica L.,"Anaheim Hills, CA",697,313,788,5.0,11/13/2015,"Dan and John's wingy adventures started 3 years ago Smorgasburg before they settled into their storefront in the East Village. Their menu is pretty straight forward, you have 3 options of wings you can choose from - traditional, boneless or vegetarian (I'm so curious about this - not curious enough to try, but close) with a wide array of sauces that can pretty much be categorized in two, hot or barbecue. Don't get me wrong though they have some variety thrown in there, I saw an inferno hot sauce. In addition to the wings they have tots, fries and onion rings. Fair warning, if you are looking for a grab and go place for your wings, you have come to the wrong spot. They cook up each batch of wings FRESH as they get each order, so yes you will have to wait. But the wait will be well worth it. The tots come out crispy and piping hot. And the wings have a nice crunch to each bite. To revisit the sauces, we got the hot traditional and the hot barbecue. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate the hot sauce as a 6. The hot barbecue was interesting, wings were tossed in their sweet barbecue sauce and then topped with hot sauce. A lot of flavors going on there, none bad. Pricing here also made me scratch my head when I first looked at the menu, but as I was munching on my wings and listening to others ring it a little light bulb lit up. They went ahead and calculated the tax into each offering, so instead of paying $19.47 cents (or whatever) your grand total comes out to an even $20. Genius. One more thing to note, they are more of a take out eatery but if you are so inclined (like we were) they have limited seating along the walls. Bonus, they have hooks attached to the wall so your stuff is flopping around as your are eating. Staff was great. After we ordered one of the cooks explained to us why it would take a minute for our food to come out. One of the owners even rung us up and from our brief conversation you could just tell how passionate he was about wings and when he was telling us his story about how they came about you could just see the pride in face.",9,4,4

I come here on a regular basis and have ordered wings for New Years Eve, the Super Bowl, etc. The BBQ sweet is a huge hit at parties. Personally, I'm a fan of hot.Both boneless and classic bone-in are great. Boneless are surprisingly juicy with a nice crunch on the outside. I recommend sticking with classic bone-in.  I actually just had some yesterday for the Super Bowl. Unfortunately they messed up the order and didn't give me any sauce. This is the second mix up when getting an order to-go. They immediately refunded me which is much appreciated. My only suggestion is to double check to-go orders!

One of the owners Dan was in and out, had a great conversation with him and he seems like an awesome guy! Great establishment and will definitely be back for more! Thanks for the wings!Edit : they opened up the front next to the original one for more space and now have a great bar area and more tables. Super awesome upgrade!

100,Chloe C.,"Manhattan, NY",229,199,1033,2.0,10/26/2016,"Recently I've had quite the hankering for wings. It's almost insane, how often these yummy chicken arms have crossed my mind since football season started. Mind you, I'm not a football fan, but I do love any excuse to eat a sumptuous, mouth-watering buffalo chicken wang, whether that's bone-in or boneless.That said, I've had Dan and John's Wings bookmarked for a long time...obviously due to the hype that other people have created about them. I was on my way to Union Square from Williamsburg, and had been unsuccessful in my earlier attempt to procure the previously described perfect chicken bites.I decided to finally give Dan and John's a try, since nothing besides a chicken wing was going to satisfy my hunger at this point. In hindsight, that was a big mistake. I was not at all impressed by these overpriced nuggets, or the sauce that they came tossed in. I went with two orders of boneless wings: one insane, and the other in the sauce-of-the-month, which was mango habanero. Typically, and when wings are good, I can really fu*k them up...by this I mean, I can beast on them dudes without caring that anyone is watching, or that sauce is in my hair. But these wings did not elicit that response from my taste buds, and I was honestly left feeling like I'd been duped. These were most definitely Domino's chicken kickers in disguise--down to the mango habanero sauce, which was making a ""special"" appearance in the month of September. My grand total for these 20 boneless wings was in the neighborhood of $25 which would have been much better spent at a number of other places. Long story short, this place is for tourists, but they definitely don't know their wangs. I won't be a repeat customer.**The insane sauce, was just about average on the spicy scale.",8,5,1
101,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,5.0,10/26/2015,"If you know me, you know my love for winged creatures--especially for their delicious wings--especially when their wings are fried up and tossed in Buffalo sauce. As you can imagine, when news of Dan and John's storefront opening reached me, I was euphoric. The two dudes (yes, Dan...and John) have been slinging wings at Smorgasburg for a while now, and the only issue one could legitimately take with them* was getting your hands on it in the off-season. The brick-and-mortar launch could not have timed better--just in time for FOOTBALL season!Anyways, if you're a wing nut, you've got to try D & J. They are easily the best Buffalo-style hot wings I've had in New York City, and rival some heavy hitters in Buffalo itself. Wings come in a variety of shapes and flavors to please all palates (they've got boneless and even veggie wings...YES, veggie wings). Spice level ranges from mild to infernal and INSANE. Pro Tip: HOT will make most spice fans happy, and INSANE is best utilized in high-stakes bets. If you like a little sumpin' sweet, there's also BBQ and spicy BBQ (both excellent). You've got a choice of blue cheese or ranch, and tater tots (or fries/onion rings) make a great side.They also have beers both on tap and in cans, and prices are reasonable. D & J also scales well for catering and events. If you've got a party coming up, fellas, they've got buckets--BIG BUCKETS. Service was pretty brisk. There were several people ordering ahead of me, but I had my wings within a few minutes.Did I mention the place is decked out in Buffalo memorabilia? You'll find a mounted Buffalo head (not real, PETA peeps), photos of the guys running this place, evidence of the 2015 BuffaloSnowPocalypse, Bills and Sabres tchotchkes, and other curios. It's not a huge place (though there is a TV on the wall and a few chairs for eating on the go), but if feels like home. These Buffalo dudes are so friendly it hurts, and by the time you're done you'll want to hop on an 8-hour Amtrak ride to their beloved town.*My only other issue is one of these dudes might be a Mets fan (I spied a ""Let's Go Mets"" scrawled on the menu chalkboard), but hey, no one's perfect.",6,4,6

There are at the most 5 chairs inside. I think the price was super overprice for the value. It would acceptable if it was organic chicken but it's regular chicken. There wasn't much sauce on the wing and not a pool of hot sauce at the bottom. I actually like extra sauce to reapply the sauce after my second bite. Couldn't do this. I ordered just 5 traditional wings for $9. That's crazy. I don't think it was worth it. Maybe $7 but $9 is a lot for 5 wings and 4 pieces of celery no fries no drink. No complimentary water either.

They also do take-out for those who don't wanna stick around.The wait for our wings was about 20 minutes. We got our hot wings first and had to wait a while more for our sweet bbq wings. It's a mixture of wings and drumsticks (which I love). You get your choice of ranch or bleu cheese to go with your wings and celery. The hot wings were a bit tangy and had some kick but weren't overpoweringly spicy. They were definitely better than the sweet bbq. I would probably not come back for the sweet bbq. I'm glad we had fries and the celery also, because around the 8th wing or so, I was needing a flavor change (even with two types of wings).",,,

My first attempt was on Super Bowl Sunday, which obviously didn't work out in my favor (sold out days before.)I live with three other girls, and we all decided it was a perfect night to try out some wings. When we got there, they let us sample the different sauce options. Almost all of us went for the Sweet Chili (monthly special, which in my opinion needs to become a permanent menu member) and the hot or medium traditional Buffalo sauce. These were the best wings I have had in my life PERIOD. The wings were perfectly sized (sometimes they're creepily large and I feel like I'm eating an elbow) and SO crispy, even though I ate them probably 45min later. I have never shared such a spiritual eating experience with my roommates ever. We were all confused as to how these were so good, and ate basically in silence for at least 30minutes.

I ordered 5 of the bone-in chicken, traditional Hot, fried hard.  The wings were a little larger than I would have liked, but they were still pretty tasty; I loved that they were super saucy!  You can choose between ranch or bleu cheese for your dipping sauce (I opted for the latter).  There are only 5 seats at the L-shaped counter, so your best bet is to take it-go, or be like me, and just eat it outside, standing.

Being from Buffalo and a recent vegetarian, chicken wings are important to me and a part of my soul. Finding an acceptable wing substitute has been my mission since my switch. This is the first place that has done the vegan wing justice! Order your vegan wings hot and extra crispy and eat them right away so they don't get soggy! The sauce left me begging for me. It is definitely genuine Buffalo-style hot sauce. The Garlic Parmesan however didn't wow me but I imagine it would taste better paired with a chicken wing vs seitan. The customer service is great as well. Fantastic place in a great location. If you're not nearby, I recommend taking the trip (N/R to 8th or 6 to Astor place then walk down 8th to first ave)!

You walk into a very small interior, with the counter in front of you and 4 stools with an L-shaped counter along the front window and side wall.  The cashier/owner was super nice and friendly, and he said it was the first time he's gotten that many veggie wing orders at one time!Throughout our stay there (~30-40min), the place had a decent flow of people ordering takeout and/or delivery.  There were times when nobody else was inside, so we got a chance to chat with the cashier and he was an extremely friendly guy.  We talked about the business and he told us the seitan was locally sourced from Monk's Meats, which is cool - love seeing local business supporting each other.I don't know how much wings typically cost, so I guess my only knock on them would be that they're expensive.  I'm used to paying more whenever I get veggie wings (rarity), but I'm pretty sure you can buy wings a lot cheaper than here - however, you're paying for their quality, freshness, and delicious sauces!The veggie wings do take some time to prepare.  We got sides of onion rings and tater tots - both of which are delicious and hit the spot.  I liked that their onion rings aren't too 'bready' and they were fried nicely.  Tots were great.As for the wings, I ordered 10 - half in the Spicy BBQ sauce and the other half were Hot.  I was debating about getting the Inferno or Insane, and the cashier let me try both sauces, but they had a similar tangy/spicy taste to them so I opted for the hot.  Given I don't eat veggie wings often, I mainly wanted to try sauces/flavors that were different from each other.Now for me, the wings are all about the flavor, the spice, and the texture - and Dan and John's nailed all three.  The spicy BBQ was a nice combination of sweet/smoky BBQ sauce when you first put the wing in your mouth, followed by a spicy aftertaste.  The best thing about the veggie seitan wing is that it did not break apart - the texture was nice, and it was chewy, but not crazy chewy.  The wings were a decent size and I was definitely full after eating the 10 of them (in addition to a couple of onion rings and tots).  The Hot ones were good - again, very tangy initial taste and the spicy aftertaste was a lot stronger than the spicy BBQ.  Nonetheless, they both were good and a bit messy - just the way they should be.  The last couple of wings I had started to get soggy, as the sauces started to infiltrate into the seitan, but they were still delicious.  The sauces are hot, as towards the ended, I needed to start dipping them in ranch to neutralize the spice - but it was soo good.  A little sweat when eating wings should be the norm.Overall, a very enjoyable experience and I'll be back!  They also have some craft brews to choose from.",3,2,2

My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place after wandering the streets of East Village. We were pretty hungry and didn't feel like eating at a restaurant. This place was perfect. We order 15 wings- mild, bbq sweet, and garlic parmesan. They were delicious, but I would pass on the garlic parmesan. It didn't have much flavor, but the other ones were delicious. You can't go wrong with wings on a late night. But don't count of eating there if you're with more than 3 people. To-go is the way to go. I would come back here when I'm back in nyc.",2,,1

The place also is extremely busy, call in or order online or you'll wait forever in a cramped room or outside. Overall, I think this place is more popular of an idea than it is good.",,,

Crunchy exterior and tender moist meat. I had the buffalo wing sauce, which was good but not super memorable. The wings I give 4/5 stars. I deduct a star because of poor value, more than $1 for each wing section.

Sad because they were noted for that -- at least here on Yelp. Seems my hunt for vegan wings continues. Nonetheless, I caved and had a small order of Boneless Bites but it was coated in a lot of batter. I guess most people prefer it this way (extra crunchy) but for me it took this to a whole new level of guilt. I can see why people love the sauce though, it's great and the mold had tons of heat and flavor but I think once was enough for me.",2,,

Our order took over two hours for delivery when the confirmation said 35 minutes! It was a simple order of wings, from a wing restaurant, and we live only a few blocks away - totally unacceptable! No one ever called to notify us that our order would be so late. We called several times for updates with no explanation from the guy who picked up - and he did not seem to think it was an issue.

My favorite by far is Duff's and I have yet to come across anything similar in the NJ/NYC area. I've tried both the hot traditional and the inferno traditional. The hot isn't spicy, but give a little taste and is quite comfortable to eat. The inferno was spicy when immediately consumed but if eaten the next day it kind of dies down a bit but is still really yummy. The only thing I would suggest for improvement is more sauce! The sauce tends to get absorbed by the wing and loses a bit of its affect. Also, the blue cheese wasn't very blue cheesy, a bit too mayo for my taste. But all in all, a great find and I'll definitely be back for more take-out! Be forewarned, the seating is extremely limited so take out is probably your best bet.",3,1,1

The place has only seats for 5 people with one person crammed into the corner. The woman turned on a movie and the tv is above you while you eat!! It was set on volume 80!!! Twice we asked for it to be lowered. It was lowered to 70!!! I saw on her face she was not happy I asked to be lowered l. Try to have a conversation with my boyfriend next to me was impossible. He was sitting next me with our elbows touching and I couldn't hear him! I had to say what? What? I can't hear you. This is how tight the seating area is and I'm just 5'2""!!! I find it rude to have tv so LOUD knowing you have paid patrons eating while you have tv on so loud!!! That's just RUDE. It's not a club or a movie theater!!!  The wings it's was good but I wouldn't say the best. Due to the experience I got I will not go back.

Almost to much so for me,  turns out hot more in my wheelhouse . Also tried the spicy bbq, which were a pleasant surprise! Am a buffalo wing purist and usually stick to hot wings, but these bbq ones were darn good. Fried, then sauced with a deep, tangy, sweet, and spicy bbq sauce then finished on a grill lending some nice chared grill marks and flavor to those bad boys... mmm mmm good!  Awesome wings and reasonably priced.

The wings weren't too saucy or soggy; great texture and flavor. I was glad I ordered an extra blue cheese and will also get an extra hot sauce next time. I do wish the sauces weren't so expensive, though - $0.92 for a teensy tiny container is too much! The order came with 3 small pieces of celery, which was kind of funny - I love having celery and carrots with wings, so I was glad that I had some in the fridge that I could whip up for myself. I also got the tater tots with spicy BBQ sauce which were great! They even arrived hot and crispy. The order was huge - perfect for sharing, although it would be nice if there were a slightly smaller side when ordering by yourself.This food ain't cheap - the 10-piece + tater tots + tax + delivery tip came to more than $25 for just me.

162,Helen F.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",84,231,427,5.0,8/17/2016,"I love Buffalo wings, they are my ultimate comfort food. So on my last day in New York, with a bit of a hangover, it was my mission to hunt some down. Yelp pointed me in the direction of Dan and John's Wings! It's a little store on 1st Avenue but pretty easy to spot due to the large buffalo logo. As others have mentioned, it's not a big space and there's only about 6 stalls. It was an extremely hot day but they were managing to keep the space relatively cool with a fan and an air conditioning unit. Service was super friendly but not over bearing. You just go up to the counter and place your order. Prices seemed to have been calculated to include tax so our order of 5 bone-in wings, 5 boneless, a side of fries and two cans of cola came to a lovely, simple total of $24. So, the menu is simple. Choose bone-in, boneless or veggie 'wings' and then a sauce- basically a variety of traditional hot buffalo sauces, a couple of BBQ sauces and a special. What more do you need? I had bone-in wings with hot buffalo sauce. As others have mentioned, the hot sauce is not extremely hot. It was a beautiful, tangy sauce but I could have handled more heat and my spice tolerance isn't even that great. If you're wondering what sauce to go for I would definitely try one up. The wings had plenty of juicy meat and five filled me up nicely for lunch. The skin wasn't as crispy as others have mentioned.Edd had the boneless wings with hot BBQ sauce- THE best hot BBQ sauce I've ever tried! These had a lovely crunchy coating and are perfect for people who dislike eating meat on the bone.The fries were amazing, the best ones I had in the US. The closest to UK chips I had, nice and chunky and perfectly cooked. The portion was big enough for two to share but not too large. And the ice cold coca cola made my day. Really wish I'd tried this place before my last day otherwise I would have been back to try all variety of wings and sauces!

I don't dare to try the others because I am not a big fan of spicy food. I am sure that those wings are just as delicious as the ones I like.

We ordered a 20 pc and split between the BBQ Sweet and BBQ Spicy. Other flavors included mild, medium, hot, inferno, and insane (which I will try next time).BBQ Spicy was certainly the more memorable flavor, however every wing possessed a flawless crisp, slightly charred on the outside with a steaming, mildly juicy chicken inside. I'm not always a fan of heavily sauced wings, but when the formula is done right, bring it on. Every bite put me in a euphoric state over and over again. Crunch, sauce, meat, crunch, sauce, meat.The sauce was a finely blended swirl of spicy buffalo and tangy BBQ, almost alternating on my taste buds every other second.

181,Cheyenne M.,"New York, NY",180,19,0,5.0,8/30/2016,"This place though?!?!?!!?!?! Yes, Dan and John work there, and are very hands on!(I absolutely love Dan!!! Super awesome, funny guy. Seriously.) Their wings ARE. TO. DIE. FOR. Legit!!They have a specialty flavor of the month, and it changes every month. The teriyaki ones were amazing, hope they come back for an encore.  I personally prefer the traditional bone-in wings with the medium or hot sauce, just because... why would you eat wings any other way. They also have boneless wings. Great taste. Crispy outside with a juicy center stuffed with white meat. And there is even a vegan option, and no it's not buffalo cauliflower! (Just a SIDE note: tater tots, onion rings, fries)They offer delivery and catering.... because football season is underway. Definitely stop by and get a ten piece and customize it the way you want, it's worth it!!!!Not a place to sit in, however. Kind of a bummer because I would be in there every football Sunday with a group of people having a wing party!!!!!!",,,1
182,Kern C.,"Brooklyn, NY",45,216,37,5.0,8/23/2016,Outstanding wings. I normally go to mighty Quinn's but they are inconsistent with their wings. This spot served them up in a variety of flavors. My favorite was the BBQ sweet. I did find myself dipping the wings in the hot sauce so maybe spicy BBQ would have been the best way to go. Their blue cheese wasn't that good though. I do wish that they can get another side option as well . But those are just side notes on an otherwise other worldly wing spot.,,,
183,Devonne C.,"Manhattan, NY",334,42,131,4.0,5/18/2016,"This is my go-to place during Football season -- or anytime I'm in the mood for ordering wings to go. I came across this place for the first time 13 days after they first opened and I just keep coming back. The best items to order off the menu, in my opinion, is the Spicy BBQ traditional wings and the french fries. The sauce makes these wings sticky, spicy, sweet and salty. Dan & John's also grills the BBQ wings and drenches them in sauce (nom nom nom).They also have vegetarian options which comes in handy on the rare days you just don't feel like eating meat.",1,,1
184,Tiffani M.,"New York, NY",146,64,89,4.0,4/24/2017,Great wings. Very fulfilling. I had the sweet bbq which were great. Definitely recommend this place if you are hungry for wings.,,,
185,Claudia D.,"New York, NY",63,133,27,5.0,9/28/2017,"The wings are INCREDIBLE. Ive only tried the sweet BBQ sauce and OMG, they are so very good. I want that sauce to put on everything. The wings are large, and great quality. Extremely fresh. The wings are crisp yet not overdone at all and have a good amount of sauce. I won't order from anywhere else. Granted, Ive had issues ordering both times but the owner himself assisted me out and was quite helpful and kind. The only small kink are that I wish I could just call and place the order but you can only do so if you pay in cash when the delivery guy comes. They dont take CC over the phone.  (They have had many issues with credit card fraud unfortunately so if using a CC, you need to go through their online ordering system). The delivery guys are very nice and honestly, both times, my order came within 30-45 minutes with the food piping hot. I just wish they (and I mean a general they bc no one seems to be able to do it) could perfect the delivery of crunchy/crisp french fries. Still, I wholeheartedly give them 5 stars because their wings are simply the best in NYC, hands down.",,,
186,Andy D.,"Shirley, NY",5,36,1,5.0,12/12/2015,"Holy shit. Buffalo wing miracle.Wandering around the east village and I walk by this wing place. Figured I'd give it a shot. While I'm waiting for them to be cooked I'm chatting with the guy, turns out he is from Buffalo and went to Fredonia, where I went to school. Not only that but his girlfriend is from Lockport, where my fiancé is from. They called me by my first name, too, which was very cool.There is buffalo memorabilia all over the walls. In addition to the wings, they also have good fries and even serve draft beer! Then the wings come out. I literally had to close my eyes to savor the first bite. These were as good or possibly even better than the best order of wings I've ever had at Duffs in Buffalo. Huge, meaty wings with sauce that left a tangy, spicy heat taste in my mouth. The wings are seared and have a perfect crunch and char to them.I am floored. If you ever find yourself around 1st Ave and ninth, and you like wings, do not miss this place. The staff are the most friendly people ever and the wings are very possibly the absolute best I've ever had. And this is coming from a total wing snob.Keep up the good work guys!",5,3,3
187,Angela K.,"Yorktown Heights, NY",0,15,6,4.0,11/3/2017,Great wings if you're in the area. Wouldn't go out of your way. Liked that the hot sauce used isn't just franks red with butter. Spicy bbq was good with a mildish kick.,,,
188,Steve F.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",0,5,0,5.0,11/1/2017,"My first time there. Service was quick. The wings were great  and the ""Insane"" sauce was awesome. I'm  definitely going back",,,
189,Ragita B.,"Jamaica, NY",61,9,1,4.0,10/5/2017,Chicken wings are great night snacks. I always go here for my late night snack while at work,,,
190,Monica L.,"Brooklyn, NY",0,59,0,4.0,4/5/2017,"Wings were very good but a bit pricey. I agree with the others their hotness scale isnt too hot. Would go back again though, to try the flavors of the months.",,,
191,Shopi V.,"New York, NY",2,35,36,5.0,1/2/2016,"OMG!! A Wingasm!! These boys are smart, happy and well raised. We saw their authentic Buffalo wings recipe on YouTube, decided to give a try at their spot on St. Mark's Place and we absolutely love it. Dan & John are friendly, the 80s music in the background is subtle, they greet every customers and take your order with the same happiness. They suggested us to order 10 wings(half traditional Buffalo wings, half BBQ wings) and those wings are amazingly crispy and tasty. No need to go to Buffalo to have some real wings now.",2,2,2
192,Randy W.,"Glen Oaks, Queens, NY",18,20,21,4.0,4/14/2017,"Yea I remember this place on 1st Ave, very small inside but you get the to see the kitchen and the guys hard at work in the back. I ordered only 5 hot wings and some fries, only because it was my first time didn't want to waste anything you know? Quality wings quality blue cheese fries were salty but cool. I'm going back next time I'm in the city.",,,
193,Art C.,"Brooklyn, NY",168,1053,63,4.0,11/16/2015,"Very impressive wings. I hate when my wings are overwhelmed with sauce, too tangy, not fresh, overcooked, undercooked, etc... This was not any of those things that I hate. My guess is if you like wings like I like wings, you'll like this place as well.",4,2,2
194,Jeff D.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1,11,4,5.0,2/22/2016,"This place is the REAL DEAL. Walking in was like stepping back home. These wings were big, crispy, juicy and delicioussss!! If you want a true buffalo wing experience come here. Now.",1,1,1
195,Page N.,"New York, NY",0,4,1,5.0,7/29/2016,Thought I would do my duty and partake in National Chicken Wing Day.Traditional BBQ Spicy had me sweating just a lil' bit.Wings are delicious! Thanks Guys,,,
196,Jen C.,"Bayside, NY",277,114,28,5.0,11/20/2015,I have been to Buffalo and if they are not 100% for real they are better (if that exists)AND. they have tater tots!!!!,3,3,1
197,Shahin G.,"Irvington, NJ",834,119,52,5.0,12/30/2015,"Came here a day or two ago and had such an amazing time. My best friend wanted me to find the best wings in Manhattan and Dan and John's came up as a top 3 option with the ""New and Hot"" label next to it *Sold*   The BBQ sweet and the BBQ spicy are the winners in my opinion although we did stop by again that same night for more wings. What's better than 10 wings? 10 more wings 2 hours later :)   I can't wait to try the Insane wings next (maybe it's inferno). I'm definitely up for the challenge for the heat. I like the open kitchen and the fries are yummy. Have to say that was the largest small order of fries I've ever received.    Wings and Monday night football was the way to live the night (Broncos and Bengals). I will be here again and thanks for the free sodas guys!!",2,1,1
198,Kenan W.,"Philadelphia, PA",2,9,0,5.0,9/6/2017,Some of the best wings I've had. Classic is crispy with buffalo sauce. The crispiness is great and so is the flavor this is one of my go to places at night,,,
199,Greg M.,"Manhattan, NY",21,20,0,5.0,10/26/2015,"After watching South Park I can't help but think that people will moronically give these guys less than 5 stars based on ""the decor not being up to my standards,"" or ""lack of seating,"" or ""the medium wasn't spicy enough.""Simply put, these wings are the best in NYC, hands down. In a city with everything food-wise, we now have filled a greatly desired need for this city's food scene thanks to these two masterminds. One order wasn't enough, as I immediately had to order seconds. If you want great wings made by passionate, awesome people, this is your new home.Keep doing what you're doing guys, and I cannot wait to return!",4,2,2
