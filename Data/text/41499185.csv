Including the playlist - B&B had the 90s hits locked down. If there's going to be music blasting at higher than preferable decibels, it may as well be old school Britney. And while the outside might look a little like a generic suburban chain (sorry), I thought the food was outstanding. I'm always a little nervous proposing a place to eat because the odds are good that someone is going to secretly hate it but everyone was pretty satisfied (I think). I tried to pick a place where the menu had something for both people who love veggies (me) and diehard burger fans (everyone else I was with). I also couldn't leave without trying the chicken lollipops. Not a lot of meat on each lollipop but if you're into saucy wings, you'd like these. I absolutely loved my salad, so much so that I'm looking to recreate it in my kitchen. The grilled avocado paired with beets, broccoli, quinoa, and almond were sublime. The rosemary tater tots were also delicious but I was too bowled over by the salad. We had two different waitresses but both were very friendly and swapped out two flat Cokes in a row. Would definitely come back if I were in the SoHo/Nolita area.",7

Both the Double Barrel and Bash were phenomenal. While I ordered my Bash sans bread, and my date ordered the Double Barrel in all its glory. Both of us were incredibly satisfied and satiated. I highly recommend going!",1
2,2,9/28/2018,208,,"Boston, MA",Collette S.,160,3.0,241,"A pretty average dining experience. Not disappointing, not super special, just a solid meal. We came to Burger & Barrel for dinner on a Friday night with friends as they are said to have one of the best burgers in NYC, the Bash Burger (caramelized onion & bacon jam, pickles, american cheese, secret sauce, fries).  The price tag is about $20 for the burger, which my friends did seam to enjoy. I had the ricotta and Spinach Ravioli ($22) which was just OK.  It's served with a red tomato sauce, and does have a healthy amount of raviolis, but there was nothing too different or unique about the dish.  We enjoyed the Guacamole appetizer to start, along with the Ricotta Toast (kumquat marmalade, crispy rosemary, chili flakes, candied hazelnuts, country bread) which was definitely the most favorite thing I ate here! Highly recommend. Overall the atmosphere was cool and the service was good.  The prices seem a little high, likely because it is on Houston street and a lot of tourists come here to eat because of the location to Soho shopping.",2

Decided to go with the bacon bash Burger that was just immaculately amazing. Not only did I finish it with insects, but he onion rings they topped with it, once thrown on to the Burger, where the flakiest and crispiest and seemingly least greasiest onion rings I've ever had. Service and ambiance are simple in all the best ways. A friendly staff that doesn't have to ask too many questions, they get you, and politely wait for a sentence to end to jump in for orders or refills. This is a great place to get close to a new person, enjoy a conversation with top notch food and service. Highly recommend for your next date night.",6

Updated review",21,,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",Shanita M.,74,5.0,42,So it is official this place earned all 5 stars and then some......so I finally went back and tried the bruger....and it was so worth it.......But what makes this place great is the staff....I went in a little before 6:30pm and asked the hostess was it possible for me to be out before 8 because I had tickets to a play......she assured me it was no problem........so once I was seated I asked for Mari.....the bartender I spoke about in my previous review ....but she was not at work.....I explained to my waitress I had gone in for the drink she makes......well....these people were so attentive they even texted Mari to ask her for the recipe......when the manager realized they lacked ingredients she actually went out and bought everything needed for the cocktail.....and I must say Jasmine the bartender got the drink spot on...Customer Service means everything to me.....and it is a plus the burger is good and they make great cocktails.......The spot is not overly expensive but cost more than your average burger but more than worth it....,1

Pretty spacious and not too crowded.While we were waiting for our food which didn't really take long to come, we were surprised to be served with a plate of mini blueberry coffee muffins on the house. That was very generous and sweet of them and the muffins were yummy. Since this is a burger place, most of us ordered burgers. Everyone raved about the Bash burger and it did not disappoint. Got medium rare and it was very juicy. It came with fries which were pretty good. The B.E.C. Burger and the Black bean veggie burgers were also decent.I ordered the avocado toast since I wasn't too hungry; however, they gave me the breakfast bowl instead. Informed the waitress about the mistake and she quickly apologized and brought out the right dish. Great service and good brunch spot. Prices maybe a bit higher but it's convenient if you need to find a place in the hood.",1

The decor was classy with a nice wine list for a burger joint. - bash burger: juicy and perfectly done. I did question how the onion rings fit with the burger. The onion rings was too greasy. The fries were subpar -- they were too dry. - Kobe sliders: had great expectation for these two sliders. But they were disappointing. The bun was hard and the meat was uninspiring.- artichoke crab dip: too salty. The dip didn't have artichoke taste and we only found 3 pieces of artichoke. The chips were overfried.  On top of that the music was pretty bad. They were playing 90s pop music. Tldr; the burger and wine were good, but the rest were subpar.",1

Updated review",74,,"South Orange, NJ",Ben D.,1310,5.0,203,"Like a fine wine, this spot only gets better with time.  Flavors are still exploding out of this kitchen like they were a few years back but the stakes have been raised.  Chicken lollipops are as good at they were on day one but joining the party are the grilled blue point oysters with hot sauce butter, lemon and parsley.  These things are the closest NYC will ever come to New Orleans type flavor and are a must have!  The 8 hour roasted prime rib (served nightly a la carte)  does not disappoint, excellent crust surrounding this cut, served with a horseradish cream that you can't stop using.  Special shout out to the truffle burger.  Phenomenal flavor on the aged beef patty and the shaved truffles puts this masterpiece over the top.",2

We finally spotted Burger & Barrel and decided to give it a chance. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon which also came with a little arugula side salad with a light vinaigrette dressing. It was delicious! We also ordered the artichoke and crab dip which was delicious. The portions aren't very big but for the two of us it was perfect. My friend ordered the Soho Breakfast and judging by the way she cleaned her plate up it was good as well.

Doesn't come with French fries but it is part of the appetizer menu, so I understand. Service was fine - nothing to complain about except for when I was walking towards the back to use the restroom, a man who seemed like a manager told me I had to be a guest in order to use the restroom - and I was.

The food was calm and the ambience was there. Very casual very laid back scenery. I had a chocolate milkshake & it was so pungent I had to get a mixture of vanilla which didn't really help BUT the chicken lollipops in two sauces (Asian and buffalo) were appetizing.

The fries were perfectly crispy, the chicken was perfectly fried, amazing! I love this place and would love to bring guests here as well.

39,1,1/13/2017,135,,"Brooklyn, NY",Nick M.,390,3.0,160,"Burger and Barrel is an odd place. Wine bar and burgers with an atmosphere similar to a Hillstone and a sommelier. I liked the concept but our dinner here was very mixed, and as we ate and sat, I changed my score many times. It's hard to separate out the good and bad and maintain context, so I'll just give you the story of our dinner.We arrived for our reservation and were seated quickly. BnB has a nice atmosphere for a bite and a chat, but it's a little loud for a place calling itself a wine bar. First dish were the risotto croquettes. While tasty and cheesy, something about the texture made me think they were frozen just minutes before we ate them. For entrees I had the Dash Burger while my companion had the Prime Rib. While the burger was excellent with a lovely bacon jam and cooked perfectly medium rare, the Prime Rib was unbelievably salty, tough and stringy. We actually sent it back, something I almost never do. We opted for the baked chicken, which was juicy and delicious. I want to add the presentation on all the dishes was amazing, the chef really has a knack for style.Overall the staff were very friendly and attentive. The manager stopped by to check on us after we returned the prime rib, it was a nice touch. I finished off the night with a mint chocolate milkshake (alcoholic), which was thick and delicious. A final note, while the restaurant is rather clean, we sat under a vent which was blowing visible dust into the air at regular intervals. Not annoying enough to get up, but noticeable none the less. Those who are very allergic to dust will want to steer clear. Should you go? If you're in the area, it might be worth a visit, but I wouldn't go out of my way. While the presentation is amazing, I got a strong feeling that the ingredients used in their dishes aren't all that fresh. This may be even more noticable in the seafood or veggie dishes. I may try again at some point, if you go, maybe stick to the burgers?",4

Updated review",375,1,"Austin, TX",Josiah C.,24,5.0,91,"Stopped into B&B per a recommendation, and was absolutely floored by the quality and taste of the classic burger! Half way into one of the juiciest pure-bred American burgers I've ever had, I noticed ""Chopped"" judge Mark Murphy sitting across the bar, casually munching on a lovely bowl of pasta. If it's good enough for him, I definitely made the right choice! Perfect for a business lunch or a romantic dinner date, B&B isn't cheap but it's worth the splurge. Sit alone at the bar top and try any one of the delectable burgers paired with a local craft beer (amazingly diverse selection, I must say), or bring a client or friend for a sit-down dinner and you'll both be impressed by the attention to detail, undeniable quality, and colorful plating techniques.

I liked all the stuff on it - onion & bacon jam, American cheese, and their special sauce, all blended together that added to the meat. My slightest comment, pickles were a bit too overpowering and I felt like it was masking all the other tastes, so I took some out from my burger and then it was perfect. Why only 4 star?

The first time I went I got a chicken sandwich, which is t even on their menu anymore. I also got a lake salad that was pretty boring, and it was actually arugula...not kale. I recently decided to try their burger, since they are a large part of their menu. I went with the classic just to compare with other simple burgers. It was also pretty boring, even with special sauce! It needed more, and I prefer regular white or red onion in the burger. This one comes with two onion rings in top, which some may prefer but I don't think it classifies as ""classic."" The only upside were the fries. Since this place is considered a wine bar, I think they should incorporate more options that pair well with wine. Right now I feel like their menu clashes with the ""wine bar"" aesthetic.",

We all ordered drinks as soon as we got in but the apps came, the main meal came and some people still didn't get a drink. We ordered with the same people three times asking for the same drink.

We both had our eyes set for their Bash burger - I (a fatty) went with their sweet potato fries while my bestie opted for their house salad as the side. The burger (their signature) was juicy and flavourful! The cheese was beautifully melted and gooey. Even though I couldn't taste much of the bacon jam or house special sauce in the burger, I still found It to be one of the top burgers I've had to date! It was simply delicious! As if the burger didn't win me over enough, their fries were perfectly cooked and not one bit greasy. True indulgence - so yummy!

I asked for the burger medium well and it definitely came out well but it was a really good burger. The fries and onion rings were good as well. I also tried the B&B chicken sandwich which was very good. It tasted like fresh organic chicken. The only issue I had here was the service. The girl was friendly but she was either overwhelmed or just wasn't paying attention, Im not sure. I asked for lemon for my water but I  didn't get it. I let that one go and later asked for ketchup. She forgot about that as well. Being that she didn't check on the table I basically finished  my meal before she even came by to ask for the ketchup again. None of this is that big of a deal but when your averaging $18 a burger I would kind of like better service and my burger cooked at the right temperature.",12

Sad moment - not realizing happy hour ends at 6:30.  Oh well. Grabbed a few drinks at the bar before our 7 o'clock reservation. The restaurant quickly filled up by the time 7 rolled around.  I came to B&B with my usual burger crew, and we always share everything. Best way to taste as much as possible.  Having previously been to Bowery Meat Company, we asked if the BMC Burger was the same as the burger from Bowery Meat Company. Our waiter told us no, that it was different. Wrong. He was so wrong. While we googled, he had thought to ask either the chef or another staff member, came back and apologized and said he was wrong, it was the same burger. Given that info - we ordered 2 different burgers, the Bash Style burger and the Double Patty Burger (add Bacon). Both were tasty, but my preference went to the bash burger with the onion & bacon jam and special sauce. Unfortunate that it wasn't cooked medium rare as requested, but was medium. On the sides we had the rosemary tater tots, and the regular fries. The rosemary tater tots were incredible. The regular fries were mediocre and nothing special.  We also had the Brussel sprouts with bacon, which were awesome! I have to mention the appetizer we had before our burger feast, because it may have been my favorite part of the meal. We went bold, and opted to share the mac 'n cheese which was creamy, cheesy and ALSO had bacon. Believe it or not, it was not planned to have bacon in all 3 of our dishes, but we did, and I don't regret it for a minute!  Overall, a successfully delicious burger meal and I walked out uncomfortably full. The desserts sounded incredible, but we didn't have an ounce of room in us to even think about it. This didn't come close the top of my burger ranks, and I'd recommend their sister restaurant Bowery Meat Company for food and service, but if you are looking for a more casual option, this is it. The service was lacking here in my opinion, especially compared to BMC. I felt our waiter didn't give us much attention after our initial ordering.",3
63,30,3/28/2016,285,12,"Manhattan, NY",Rachel W.,532,4.0,201,"Three words: Rosemary Tater Tots.  Seriously so good! Do yourself a favor and order them. I had been here before a while ago, but don't really remember much from that visit.  I went back this weekend for an early (10:30) brunch on Sunday.  There were some other tables, but it wasn't too crowded.  It was starting to fill up more when we left around noon.  I was feeling slightly hung over from the night before, so I decided I needed some hair of the dog, and ordered a bacon bloody mary. This was good, but I imagined there would be a long, crispy stick of bacon in the glass, but the bacon was crumbled up on top. It was good, but not exactly what I was expecting. I also felt like I should order something carby to absorb all the alcohol in my bloodstream, and ordered the BEC. The waitress said it wasn't that big and suggested I ordered a side.  I got the rosemary tater tots! Best decision ever, but to be honest I thought the sandwich was kind of big and would have been fine without the side. The bacon was a bit thicker cut; the egg wasn't runny which was nice. My cousin took a bite out of his steak sandwich and the egg opened and dripped down his hand. Overall I thought the BEC was good, and I liked the brioche bun.  I didn't taste anyone else's food, but everyone seemed to enjoy what they got. I shared my tater tots and I think everyone agreed they were amazing.  I don't know why I never really think to come here, but it's definitely a good spot!  I'll have to remember and come back some time soon.",25
64,,9/3/2017,327,,"New York, NY",Kevin N.,5,2.0,5,"I came here on a recommendation from a coworker who said this was the best burger they've had in the city. That was quite the statement for me especially since I quite often look for new burger places to try. Coming from Texas, I definitely have my favorites there, so I'm constantly looking for my new go-to in the city even after the two years I've been here.After reading past reviews and checking out the menu, I finally decided to give this place a try on a Saturday night for dinner. Safe to note that since the burgers here start at $19 and up, I was ready to be IMPRESSED. We walked in around 8:30-9PM and there was no wait for a party of 2 given it was also pouring outside. We ordered the hush puppies which were actually delicious and were stuffed with a good amount of shrimp and came paired with a spicy mayo aioli. However the burgers, were another story. I might have overhyped them in my mind prior to actually coming here but once again for the price point, I was expecting a lot more. We ordered the double barrel and the 40 day dry aged BMC burger.   The buns were not toasted and reminded me of buns that you would have with the frozen burgers you grill at summer time BBQs. I'll have to say the meat was juicy as I ordered medium rare, but the flavor was nothing special. The BMC burger comes with raclette cheese which was good, but I think over powered the taste of the beef and made me wish I had gotten an alternative like cheddar. My friend compared the double barrel to a McDouble with mac sauce since he mentioned the ""special"" sauce tasted very similar to that of a Big Mac. Finally, the fries were good but inconsistently crispy and soggy. I will also mention that the waitstaff was attentive and kept our water glasses full. I really wanted to like this place but as I took each bite of my burger, my opinion kept leaning towards not. I would potentially come back to try a different burger/different foods and wine as they could be inconsistent with their food given the amount of great reviews/feedback I've seen but it won't be anytime soon given the price point.",1

But we were starving, so everything tasted good at this point. Then we each ordered a Bash Burger (medium), and I swapped rosemary tater tots in place of regular fries as my side. When our burgers finally came out though, my burger was actually somewhat disappointing. The burger patty was mushy, and the bread was soggy on the bottom. The onion rings were cold and oily like the oil in which it was fried wasn't hot enough. The tater tots also tasted oily, and the flavor of rosemary was a little overpowering. Overall, I'm happy to cross Burger & Barrel off my list of places to try but won't need to get another underwhelming $19 Bash Burger here again anytime soon.",1

We were seated right away by the super energetic hostess and served within a few minutes. The service was perfectly fast because I was starving..I only had a green tea ice cream waffle 2-3 hours before coming here. I ordered the veggie burger with the tater tots and I was disappointed. They gave free onion rings which was very much appreciated. I think the massive amount of oil from both the tots and onion rings left my stomach feeling gross. I enjoyed it but the after feeling was not fun. The veggie burger was very dry and bland. There are way better veggie burgers around for a cheaper price. I like that they served the veggie burger on a multi-grain bun - makes us veggie heads feel special! Along with the veggie burger was one piece of lettuce and a thin slice of tomato.,4

It started off with the service not being so great. We didn't see a waitress for the first 15 minutes we were sitting down. We also noticed that the table of two ladies sitting next to us were having some service issues as well. Finally we had someone come by and we were able to place our order quickly.We started off with the chicken lollipops and they allowed us to do half buffalo and half bbq. This made it very easy for my friend and I to share. The lollipops really weren't anything special at all. They basically looked like fancy chicken wings. They did taste ok, but definitely could've lived without them. After we shared the lollipops as an appetizer, we each ordered our own burgers. I decided to just go with the classic cheese burger. All of the photos I've seen of these burgers looked excellent. When mine arrived it wasn't cooked the way I had asked, but since I was so hungry I decided to just go ahead and have it. I wish it was closer to the medium rare side though instead of being almost well done. The burger was delicious though. I did enjoy my burger and the side of tater tots it came with. When my friend and I finished our burgers, the waitress came over to us (who we hadn't seen very much) and just placed our check on the table. It was pretty awkward considering she hadn't asked us if we wanted dessert and we actually did want some.

The only time someone payed attention is when the second bartender clean my plate and asked if I wanted another glass of wine. When I decline he promptly gave me my check clean my plate and walked away. If someone asked me earlier I would of like to order another seltzer water with lime and a dry martini with a twist.

The desserts were also fairly disappointing. The drinks at the bar were great and I would probably come back here for the cocktails, but probably not the food. Also, there are only 2 bathrooms! 2 unisex bathrooms, I waited outside for nearly 10 minutes for one to free up and when I came out the person after me was still waiting, which suggested only 1 bathroom was actually in working order!",4

Walking by on a regular basis, tonight was the night to try and, boy, it was really not worth the pennies, the expectation, or the attitude. First of all, the service was horrible. Our waitress was extremely unpleasant and dismissive. We ordered the Kobe sliders to start and they were nothing extraordinary. For $13, you get 2 tiny sliders gone in 2 bites. There is only a dollop of sauce and a crumb of bacon. Very pricey for a very lame bite. Not worth it. We then share the BMC burger and while it was good, it wasn't great. I loved the onion/raclette combo, but there is nothing else on that burger... I don't think Guy Fieri would rave about a burger from a burger place everyone is raving about. Seriously, there is nothing on that burger besides the bits of onions, the melted cheese and the meat. There was barely any of that tomato aioli in there either. This quite lame burger was $23. $23!!After reading other reviews, I wished I had ordered the bash style, for the bacon jam and the onion rings every seem to like. And how come other sandwiches don't get the flipping onion rings?! So yeah. Nope. Over rated. Preppy. Not very friendly staff. Not so good burger.",2

Whether sitting at a table or the bar, my water glass has been maintained and no empty plates lay around.  At this latest visit, I had some glasses of Malbec and their versión of ""Mac"" & cheese. The self imposed quotation marks are the result of their use of rigatoni (as opposed to the traditional elbows), fresh sauteed spinach, a bechamel sauce, breadcrumbs and crispy bacon bits. Listed as an appetizer, this was a meal by itself, so much so that I could not even finish it.

It really had no flavor to me, just too salty. It wasn't all that juicy, no delicious grease soaking the bun. I couldn't taste the aioli it came with really, the bun was totally bland.

But they are a little shy with the ketchup for my mediocre fries. Why? But that waitress....

We only waited about 15 minutes for the food to arrive. The burger (medium-well) was juicy and cooked to perfection. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a hamburger this much.

Probably the result of the aged meat.If the burger was good, the herb-rosted organic chicken over farrow and mushrooms was delightful.

Overall, the spot was a great find and we were so happy to stumble across it. It was a Friday night and we did not have a reservation so we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. We decided to wait by the bar and try some drinks. My boyfriend has the Doctor, which he loved. He ended up ordering two! I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir. The restaurant itself is beautiful. I found the decor to be cozy and current without being overly trendy. I felt like it was a spot that I could hang out all night. Once seated we were ready to start eating! We started with the tuna tartare. First impression, I was totally impressed by the presentation. It almost looked too beautiful to eat, but that didn't stop us. The tuna was fresh and well seasoned. It was topped with a layer of avocado that added a layer of creamy texture. The potato gaufrettes, which I would call potato chips added a salty crunch that perfected the dish. A must try!For entrees I had the ravioli stuffed with burrata with a heirloom cherry tomato sauce. I loved the burrata which made the raviolis very creamy, it was something different that I had never tried. The sauce I found to be too watery and did not add much flavor to the dish. I think this could use some slight improvements to truly make a killer dish. My boyfriend has the BMC burger which he said was good, but not amazing. I think he regretted not ordering the highly acclaimed Bash Burger. He is a huge burger guy, so I think his hopes were very high. Although the meat blend of the BMC is of higher quality, I think he would have enjoyed the toppings of the Bash burger better. We ordered a side of Brussels sprouts which were amazing! There were large pieces of bacon and the sprouts were cooked to perfection. We ended with dessert which were apple pie pirogies. They were delicious  but at this point we were stuffed.

The atmosphere is upscale and classy, dark and cozy. Dark wood and leather everything. The place has great acoustics too -- the music was loud but not obnoxious.Since it was rather late, we decided to split everything, including a drink (we're cheap drunks). We ordered the Spring Fling, tuna tartare, bash burger w/ rosemary tots instead of fries, and the warm chocolate toffee cake.Spring Fling -- made with elderflower, sparkling wine and something else that I can't recall at the moment. This was citrusy, fizzy and just delicious. Strong, too -- I was all warm and fuzzy after half of my half, haha.Tuna tartare -- this was wonderful! Fresh diced tuna topped with avocado and chili oil which gave it a light kick. I can't remember the last time I had a tuna tartare this good. Oh, the tartare was surrounded by potato gaufrettes, which I learned were just waffle potato chips, although some amazingly crispy chips at that. I love chips.Bash Burger -- comes with onion and bacon jam, pickles, american cheese and special sauce and topped with two super crispy onion rings. Solid burger, cooked to a perfect medium. The onion and bacon jam was mostly onion, as I barely tasted any bacon flavor at all, but I enjoyed it nonetheless -- who doesn't love caramelized onions? The rosemary tater tots were piping hot and freakin' amazing. So crispy. So heavy. But, so tasty! Rosemary is just the perfect seasoning. I will be requesting a sprinkle of rosemary on my tater tots at every place I happen to order tater tots in the future.Warm Chocolate Toffee Cake -- this was bittersweet and rich but super moist. It was accompanied with candied pecans and a scoop of bacon ice cream. BACON ICE CREAM. This was surprisingly delicious. Actually, I'm not surprised. There were itty bitty bacon bits in each creamy bite and the savory sweet combo was excellent, especially paired with the cake. Devoured.Service was exceptional! Our waiter was a total ham and really fun to chat with. Our water was always full too. There was a small mishap with our order -- we ended up waiting about 25 minutes for our burger. Our waiter was all like, you guys either eat really quickly or it never came..and when we told him it hadn't come yet, he had the most horrified face and apologized profusely. It really wasn't a big deal but he ended up getting us another drink on the house and comping the first one. Unnecessary but definitely appreciated.I will be coming back asap.

Did I mention it came with the most crispy and cut fries? We ate it ALL with no regrets. Oh yeah and ended with ice cream sammich's that brought our mid 30 year old selves back to child hood.

I think in most parts of the world American cheese is not even seen as cheese. The onion rings on the top of the burger were good. They had a nice crisp with out being greasy. The burger itself was whatever. The onion jam was pretty flavorless. The bun was a ton of bread. The fries were nothing special. If this meal was cheaper I would say it was perfectly fine. The price to quality is just not there.Kudos to the staff. Each person was was friendlier than the next. The ambiance was nice and enjoyable.Maybe you will like the burger.

I've been here 4 times within the past two weeks for lunch and it had never been anything short of a mess. The servers are bartenders the bartenders are servers there is no structure and the people that are so called ""bartending"" are inattentive and when you ask them for a menu or water while they're checking their precious phones they give you an attitude the rest of the time you are there.

Normally I don't like a lot of toppings or American cheese (prefer cheddar) or any 'special sauce', but it works for this burger and was really good. Comes with two onion rings and fries or rosemary tator tots, which of course I chose the tots cause no one makes them anymore. The meat itself had a nice black peeper flavor to it and the ""jam"" was awesome. My only gripe would be that the bun was a little thick, meaning the bread-to-meat ratio was a little high, in my opinion, but not a deal breaker. The place itself is really cool with a great ambiance and the price was reasonable ($17) for a high end burger.  Highly recommend this place.",3

My mom cannot eat soy and our server went truly out of his way to make sure that everything she got was completely free of any soy products. I got the roasted chicken which was perfectly cooked and extremely tasty and the everyone agreed that the burgers were delicious as well. My dad got a pasta dish that was too spicy for him and our server immediately offered to have them remake it with less spice. He didn't take him up on since he had already eaten a good amount, but it was a very nice gesture. I also enjoyed that they offer beer flights.

135,2,6/2/2015,79,3,"Clarks Summit, PA",Marcee A.,697,2.0,40,"I generally do not take the time to write out a review. However, I want to share my experience so that it may serve as a fair warning to other yelpers looking for a restaurant. The bottom line is be very specific when placing your order, return it immediately if it is not correct, and don't bother ordering dessert. If you are interested in finding out the reason behind my review, read on.I wanted to like this place. Our server was very friendly but in the end not very helpful. My husband can be picky about The hamburgers that he orders because he wants them completely plain. He stated this very clearly to our server. His burger ended up coming with a tomato catchup/mayo sauce slathered on the bun. He ate it without making a fuss. When he asked the The server about with the sauce plus she said him a line that the burgers are just very juicy when he went further and explained what he saw on the fun then she came clean and said oh that that was mayo and catchup. She made no apology for her error when placing our order nor did she offer to make it right.I ordered the shredded zucchini salad. Although it tasted delicious it was a rather small portion for the $13.  Because I was still hungry I decided to splurge and order the salty chocolate peanut butter brownie option for dessert (after all the pictures that have been posted all looked wonderful). That was another major disappointment. It looked like something that you would get at a restaurant chain like Friendly's or Perkins. And it didn't taste much better than it looked. When the server asked us how we liked the dessert I did explain to her that I was surprised at how poor the quality of this dessert. Once again she made no offer to make it right, to remove it from the bill, to ask the manager to come over to speak to us--nothing. I am not a native New Yorker so perhaps my opinion of how an unhappy customer should be treated comes from growing up in a smaller town. I'm used to servers, management, owners wanting their patrons to return and share good word-of-mouth endorsements. Perhaps in a large city there's enough turnaround of clientele that there is no concern for repeat business. The only reason I gave two stars is because the my salad was fresh and tasty.",2

I basically just had avocado soups and it wasn't spicy not one bit I was so disappointed. The tater tots were okay they remind me of school lunch back in the day. The burger was regular not bad but not great either just okay nothing about the bash style burger stood out to me. Let's get to my favorite part the service one word ""SUCKS""!

And it's the other stuff that elevates this place to 5-star status: great atmosphere, great service, and a ton of other great food.We started with a bunch of appetizers, which were all really excellent:- Meatballs & Tomato Ragu ($14)Three large meatballs with delicious Ragu sauce and some toasted, buttery bread. These meatballs were really really good.- Chicken Lollipops ($13 for 6)I'm lazy so I usually avoid buffalo wings since it's too much work with not enough payoff. That's why I loved these: they had huge, juicy pieces of buffalo chicken, with just a tiny bone stuck in the middle, that it was very easy to rip all the meat from. These were great.- Soft Shell Tacos ($10 for 2)You can get either prime rib or fish tacos, so we chose the fish. They were slathered in some kind of neon green and white sauces, which were pretty good, and the fish was nice and crispy.For the meal I wavered between the overpriced sounding Truffle Burger ($26) and the Bash Burger ($16), but I had to go for the Bash since that's the one I've been hearing so much about. Plus, bacon jam just sounded really intriguing.This was a really great burger. It comes stacked high with too huge onion rings on top. I tried half of one, but wasn't a huge fan as it wasn't really that hot for some reason, so I skipped eating the rest since I had plenty more beige to get through.I got the burger medium, but it came out quite pink, which was unfortunate for this style of bun, since the bottom bun was almost completely soaked through from the blood. I hate when this happens since it becomes a real mess to eat the burger and you can't really put it down.So I wolfed it down, and it was still delicious in spite of the soaked bun. On the side, I asked for Tater Tots instead of the usual fries, which are not on the menu but I knew about thanks to Yelp photos. These were pretty overwhelming. They were really crispy and hot, which was good, but were somehow really heavy.Unfortunately this place has some amazing options on the dessert menu, so we had no choice but to get two things even though I was pretty sick at that point.We got the Warm Chocolate Toffee Cake and the Salty Peanut Butter Sundae ($8 each). Both were incredible. The toffee cake was insanely rich and moist, and when paired with the bacon ice cream it came with, you have the perfect bite. The peanut butter sundae was pretty genius too - it's 3 scoops of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, covered with peanut butter sauce and studded with brownie chunks and pieces of peanut brittle. Really great.I would definitely come back here to try another one of the burgers and to finish off the rest of the great desserts.",9

The onion rings topping it were forgettable, and the fries alongside it had a distinct peanut oil-y flavor that lingered for a while on the palate.

The roasted root vegetables (parsnips, potatoes, etc.), the Brussels sprouts with bacon, and the grilled cauliflower were all cooked very well.I also had the Blood Simple cocktail, but substituted the regular tequila with Tanteo jalapeno tequila.

171,,5/7/2017,1,,"Jersey City, NJ",Steph M.,1,4.0,3,This place is great for date night! The dim lighting and intimate table space makes it fun and great to be with your loved one. The burgers are delicious along with the onion rings. Their alcoholic beverages are very tasty and enjoyable with your meal. Our waitress was nice and friendly which I look for anywhere I go out. Highly recommended!,

Updated review",2,,"Melbourne, Australia",Hannah C.,1,5.0,9,Best burger ever. Great service. Couldn't have asked for a better place to spend my afternoon. Reasonably well priced. Nice location and again great food. They have the best service. I couldn't say anything bad about them at all.,

The place is nice - good ambiance and relaxed vibe. We were greeted and seated right away. Unfortunately, we missed the happy hour (only runs from 4-6pm), but that wasn't a big deal. It seemed like our waitress was new because she wasn't exactly friendly, not that she was rude either, but I don't know... something was just a little lacking from the overall service we received.Moving onto the food - we ordered 3 small plates to share since we didn't have much time nor did we have much of an appetite. Everything we ordered was savory and tasty - 2 thumbs up for the food!This probably wouldn't be a destination spot for me, but if I'm in the area and needed a place to go, this would be just fine with me.",
175,,5/7/2015,44,,"New York, NY",Kristina S.,131,3.0,151,"Grabbed a quick dinner here a couple of weeks ago and it was just ok. First, I ordered a dirty martini with Belvedere vodka and was told there was none so I settled on Kettle One instead. No big deal. Well...when I received the martini it was the smallest dirty I have ever seen. $15 for a shot of vodka with an olive. The waitress later told me they actually do have Belvedere but I passed. I was with 5 other people and no one was too crazy about the drinks.Onto the food...we ordered a few appetizers, fish tacos and Mac and cheese. These two are the only reason I would remotely consider going back here. The fish tacos were perfectly done and had a tasty sauce and well proportioned for an appetizer size. The Mac and cheese was gooey cheesy perfection and we all couldn't get enough. We all ordered some type of burger for an entree. I believe it was called bash burger (some variation) and the lamb burger. The bash was undercooked and wasn't anything special. I actually thought that it was loaded with sauce to make up for the natural lack of seasoning/flavor. The lamb burger was on the dry side and was as basic as they come. Great fries though, especially the sweet potatoes. Go here for beer and appetizers and skip everything else!",

I ordered a bash burger and I was so excited for it and when it came it looked so good. BUT the onion ring that everyone talks about was terrible it was so oily and nasty I literally took 1 bite &&& the French fries were over fried so over fried that it had a burnt taste, and im the type of person that likes fries crispy but these fries were terrible.Im not sure if its because me and my friend look young that they thought it was ok to make burnt fries and greasy onion rings..Im never coming back here not worth it.

We stepped in and it was like we walked into another club with their blasting music. It wasn't the cheap eats we expected but rolled w it anyways ,... Appetizers of truffle fries, tater tots, corn salad and guacamole were amazing. We could have done without the gauc but everything else I kept grabbing over and over. For my entree I got the Mac n cheese which is really a starter but it filled me up. Rigatoni pasta (yum) with a cheesy base and tasty bacon. My friends raved about their dishes too which were the lamb burgers, the fish and the pork ribeye. The pork ribeye was a bit raw (it was weird to us too?) but had good flavor. All in all, I'm really impressed and will come back !",3

For dinner we ordered a few glasses of wine and started with the meatballs ragu, baja tacos and rock shrimp hush puppies.  all were really good but the tacos were amazing. if i had known how great they were i would have ordered 6 of those bad boys.For dinner we each ordered the Bash style burger with a side of truffle fries and tater tots to share.  The burger was delicious and had the right amound of flavor and cooked to perfection.   The next time I go there I want to order the famous and super uberly expensive truffle burger.",
181,,9/29/2016,72,,"Brooklyn, NY",Max R.,0,2.0,7,"-great looking restaurant -food smelled great (but never got it)-service was HORRIBLE!!-walked out after sitting at table for 30 minutes waiting for foodThat's the short version of this review.Elaborated, my girlfriend, mother, and I went to this spot which I was excited to go to because I always pass by it and it always smells so good from the sidewalk.  When we go inside we are seated and about 10 minutes go by before someone asks which water we prefer. Another five minutes go by before our waitress shows up and takes our orders. My mother who cannot eat gluten asked if the soup was gluten free and the waitress said she would check for her. The waitress never came back, so about 15 more minutes go by and we don't know if my mother is going to have any food to eat.  At this point we decided that the service and attention to its customers was just plain awful and left. The Hostess checked in with us as we were leaving and we told her everything to which she apologized for saying it was the waitresses first night; and I appreciated that, but it was too late at this point.  My mother who felt bad left a few dollars on the table for the waitress.We walk out and go up the block and decide to turn around to go to sliver spurs. A staff member is outside, I'm guessing the GM and is all like ""we got burgers coming out guys"". He then proceeded to be rude because we didn't tell anyone we were leaving. Uhm yeah we did. The hostess. This GM clearly has no idea what is going on in his restaurant and to wait outside to maybe catch us just to yell at us?  What kind of customer service is this. Furthermore, when you are charging $19-24 for a plate your staff should always be checking in with the table, especially when the food is taking longer to come out. But even better, how about you come back to the table and inform us if the soup is okay and safe for my mother to eat?!  The GM condescendingly said to us that the soup is gluten free. Well then why didn't your waitress know that?  Oh she's new, then why wasn't there an experienced staff member there to support her on her first night?!  And btw, my mother left you some tip money which she did not have to because all we had was just water!Truly disappointing. I was very excited to come here, but when you charge the prices they are charging, and treat your customers the way we were treated, it would be a long time before I ever consider making another trip back here, if I ever do.",4
182,,12/8/2015,98,,"New York, NY",Jay K.,43,4.0,11,Burger and Barrel is a nice classy spot that has opulebt decor and also a nice menu. The price point is above average but its well worth it. I have been here 3 times now and may make it one of my MANY happy hour spots. Fyi their happy hour is Monday thru Friday 3:30 to 6:30 pm. Take a look at the Menu for your self! :),1

184,,11/17/2012,153,,"Queens, NY",Anna H.,9976,5.0,765,I had a nice reserved table with my girls tonight. The atmosphere is very laid back and cozy. Our waitress was really attentive which I like. I suggested one of my friends to try the Bash Style Burger because there were a lot reviews on this particular burger. I got the Southern Fried Chicken and my other friend got the Pappadella (how ever you spelled it) with a side order of Tarter Tots. I love how the cornish hen was very well seasoned that I didn't need to dip in ketchup and yummy crispy skin. The Tarter Tots were so superbly delicious with a hint of Oregano that my friend pointed out or some kind of herb. I am happy the food was portion size because it leaves room for dessert. I shared a mini icecream cones with one of my friends and its delicious and bitesize.,1
185,,11/7/2014,282,,"Queens, NY",Shaji K.,1490,4.0,1524,"Always looking for the biggest, juiciest meatburgerwich in the city. The Bashburger should be on everyone's list.Aforementioned Bashburger ($16) w/ rosemary tater tots. On the expensive side, but incredibly well made, despite the feeling it might fall apart at any second (it didn't). Two giant onion rings on top that you can either take off and put to the side or put in the burger. Strong but not hard bun with a good beef to ingredient ratio. Tater tots were hot and on point.A few beers on draft ($8) to pair with the meatrocity, but it's more of a wine bar than anything. Definitely a good place to go back if you don't mind the price, desserts are hard to turn down.",1

Updated review",808,,"Huntington Station, NY",Michelle B.,3040,4.0,1305,"I recently returned to burger and barrel.  I started with the Chicken Lollipops covered with ancho chile bbq sauce. Not bad, but nothing special. I also nibbled on the pretzel. Warm and soft.Couldn't resist the bash burger.  While it was a bit on the greasy side, I still think its an awesome burger. I love that the burgers are stacked with onion rings in addition to the side of fries.Plus, our waitress was super friendly so that made the meal all the more enjoyable :)",

I got the breakfast sandwich and asked if it came with a side. The waitress said no so I ordered a side of potatoes. Guess what? The sandwich comes with a side of potatoes, so then I had all these potatoes I couldn't finish. Also? They said the sandwich comes on an English muffin in the menu..it was some sort of thick, dry iteration of an English muffin. Sad.Also, no breakfast burger on the brunch menu?????",2

Last but not least, don't forget to try their salty peanut chocolate ice cream!",
190,,9/28/2015,30,,"New York, NY",Derek C.,0,3.0,83,3 1/2 stars. The place is trendy and the service was great. They have an extensive wine list for a burger joint.  The food portions aren't large here. The quality of the meat in the burgers are good but I just don't see the huge hype. Get the tots over the fries.,2
191,1,7/13/2012,537,,"Spokane, WA",Tiffany L.,685,3.0,609,"In general, I thought B&B was a really cool place with decent food and a nice vibe. Still there are things that make me choose my stars carefully. The interior is dark and modern-rustic with shades of brown, leather, wood and brick textures. Wine bottles are everywhere, letting you know that they are vino-centric, and that they are. The bottle list is decent, the cheapest around $30 and most expensive at almost $500. Wines by the glass list falls short, but they do offer ""wines on tap,"" or by the Barrel (where the latter part of the name comes in). I tried two glasses this way, a Riesling and a Rose, both were good. They are, however, served in glasses not too much bigger than a double shot glass, and they can be downed pretty quickly, especially for the price of around $10 per glass.Our waiter was fairly efficient and very down-to-earth, in fact at times acting a little too ""cool."" If you want your waiter to say things to you like, ""Ready to booze it up some more?"" then you're in the right place. People searching for classier experiences, look elsewhere. Haha. He was really helpful and insightful about the menu items, though.We started with the Watermelon Salad which is on their separate ""Market Menu,"" a changing menu that consists of seasonal offerings. The salad was delicious. Fresh, sweet watermelon stacked perfectly with feta cubes, fruity and delicious olive oil, and shishito peppers. It was really, really good. I thought it was worth the $12 for the unique flavors and showcase of true, fresh ingredients and flavors - my husband, however, thought it was way too small a portion for $12. Be warned these aren't really ""sharing"" sizes.For dinner, I was sold on the Spring Pea Ravioli, and hubby settled on the Bash Burger because of the rave reviews. My ravioli was delicious and i was surprised, the brightest green filling was fresh and full of flavor, the asparagus went nicely and the sauce was light, enhancing it perfectly. I loved it, and it was a just-right portion.Now the Bash Burger... what obviously makes this burger so good is the bacon jam, right? Hubbys burger had barely none on it. I mean, we lifted the top of it and all the burger was was pickles and cheese, and maybe the faintest proof of this so-called jam! It was still a really juicy, really good burger, but would probably have been a million times better if it actually had on it the ingredients as they were listed. The tator tots are however amazing, super crunchy and salted and herbed nicely.We also got dessert. The bourbon-spiked milkshake is amazing... and actually really boozey. Banana cream pie isn't so bad, either. Everything was enjoyable and with all that food, 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers, about $110. Which isn't bad, but also might be more than you expect from the type of place. I would still check it out, see what you think.",2
192,,2/20/2017,20,,"Bakersfield, CA",Angel M.,0,1.0,28,Not worth the money! It's a rip off I payed 20 something bucks for a burger! The burger wasn't good it took them almost an hour to bring our food never understood what was so good about the place it's a rip off that's what it is I'd rather have a burger at McDonald's to be honest and it's fast only takes them like 5 minutes to call your number not like burger & barrel taking almost an hour to bring my food what a shame after hearing the reviews of the food but I hate it when I go somewhere and it takes them an hour to bring my food that's one of the things I hate alot I won't be coming here again,

If so, you should definitely come here.Pros:-clean restrooms (although they only have two stalls for the entire place)Cons:-slow service...especially when it came to refilling our water-their burgers were bleh...cheap bread with mediocre meat. The only thing that's different is that they place a onion ring on top-their fries actually taste stale...i mean even McDs is better-the food took a very long time to come out (25+ min)-the restaurant gets pretty loud and packed so if you want that bad burger, make sure you make reservations There are much better burger places in nyc to check out (ex: umami, bare burger, etc).

198,2,4/30/2014,1273,1,"Manhattan, NY",Kevin W.,1020,4.0,735,"If you come here and only eat one thing - you can't go wrong with their famous Bash Burger.  The meat is tender, succulent and perfectly cooked.  The bacon onion jam works perfectly with the yummy cheese and meaty goodness.  The size is also just right - no too big, not too small.  I also can't say enough about the two onion rings that come with the burger.  Perfectly fried, crispy and just all around good.  The fries on the side were also nice, thanks to the perfect texture and the slender, yet steak fries feel.  If that's all you're gonna get, you'll do fine with that.Of course they serve other items.  We gave the shrimp scampi starter a try.  It was definitely good, but for the high price tag and tiny portions, I think you're better off going with the burger.  The fish tacos starter dish was definitely better for the price you pay.  The sauce that goes with the tacos was divine and I think this works better as either a sharing dish or a small entree for folks with small appetites.The ambiance of this place is great - dark but quaint and definitely bustling nearly the bar area.  The service was also top notch.  It's a good place to catch up with friends or even for date night.  We didn't get a chance to try out the wine selection but the beers on tap were excellent.  No complaints on that front.  In short, this is a nice all-around place to grab a bite or drinks with friends and loved ones.",2

The Bash burger was so delicious. The Classic was even better. I have to admit, this is my all time favorite burger, ever. No seriously, it was that good. The tater tots that came as a side were also perfectly crisp nuggets. The tap wine was on-point. I officially love this place.",1
