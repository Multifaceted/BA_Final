0,Alex G.,"New York, NY",8,35,6,5.0,11/5/2018,Best wine bar in the city. Hands down. Excellent selection of small plates and wines by the glass. Everything from the classics to more obscure varietals you can't find most places. The people are the greatest asset. Everyone is so welcoming and friendly. Definitely venture to Ardesia if you find yourself in Hell's Kitchen.,,,
1,Linda X.,"New York, NY",46,86,210,4.0,10/18/2018,"Ardesia is on 52nd St between 10th and 11th so this is hidden pretty far west in Midtown, but is a charming place in the area. Happy hour runs Mon-Fri from 5-7pm. It's $2 off any glass of wine (and draft beer) and they have 35 wines offered by the glass.Cheese and charcuterie is a good idea at any wine bar so we got a mix of 3 cheese and 3 meats which came with pickles, bread, and spreads. The highlight, for me, was the burrata with bacon-bourbon jam and toasted Amy's bread. We couldn't get enough of the first that we had to order a second. It's incredible and would definitely come back for it again.",,,
2,Joe S.,"New York, NY",330,578,37,4.0,9/3/2018,Okaiiiii ardeeeeseeuh. Things I loved include:- Service at the bar - Soft pretzel with mustard- Crostini with rocotta- Strong wine selection - Outdoor seating with plenty of room inside This place is a hidden gem. PLEASE DONT CLOSE.,1,,3
3,Cynthia Z.,"Manhattan, NY",166,155,1847,5.0,11/14/2018,"One of my favorite local wine bars, located on 52nd Street between 10th and 11th Ave. I love the variety of quality wines here and how some seasonal wines like prosecco has real rose petals in it for a flavor kick, giving it a nice summery feel. The food here is also pretty good, although the portions are small for its value. So far, I have had croquettes, deviled eggs, garlic shrimp skewers, quail egg toast, roasted brussels sprouts, spiced lamb skewers, seared flank steak, and pulled pork sliders, and they are all on point. You definitely cannot go wrong with them. They actually have one of the most flavorful roasted brussels sprouts in the neighborhood for those who are health conscious. Great service and beautiful ambience. Plenty of seating inside and outside. The outdoor seating during warmer weather evenings are just beautiful. Definitely recommended.",3,3,3
4,Cat W.,"Boston, MA",0,49,7,5.0,11/5/2018,"I was delighted to see this restaurant had a great charcuterie menu: in particular, they serve a great local goat cheese from upstate New York: St. Johnsville Goat Cheese! What an excellent cheese curator this bar has. Please keep stocking local artisanal dairy selections like St. Johnsville!In addition, Ardesia has nice ambience and seating and courteous, friendly service.",,,
5,Liza M.,"Washington, DC",96,252,1794,5.0,12/5/2017,I love this little wine bar! It is tucked away on 52nd street in a quiet little neighborhood. I met up with a friend right before Thanksgiving and we got a few glasses of wine and a charcuterie plate. It was perfect and I loved that our server picked some cheeses and meats that complemented each other and our wines. We caught up after not seeing each other in 2.5 years and felt like we had privacy and ample time to chat. The ambiance is very date-like. We joked that we felt this was like our first date... I would only bump up the light like 1/4 of a notch just so you can at least see the menu. We definitely whipped out the phones to add a tad bit of light so we can see. I promise our vision isn't that bad and we're not secretly 80 yrs old. Other than that this is an really cute spot that I'm looking forward to trying again next time I'm home for the holidays.,2,,1
6,Jennifer M.,"Milltown, NJ",0,34,14,5.0,11/8/2018,"Great pregame spot before a Terminal 5 show. I was drinking a natural wine from Spain and I really enjoyed it. The service was a symphony of efficiency, everyone pouring, serving and clearing. It's a fund, loud place and they were playing Barry White and other fabulous vintage R&B. Food was excellent.  We had pretzel, croquettes, burrata with bacon bourbon jam, lamb skewers, olives, deviled eggs and all were well seasoned, beautifully prepared and balanced.  Not a miss among the dishes.  Will definitely return.",,,
7,Shannon W.,"Paramus, NJ",552,444,808,4.0,3/7/2018,"I'm so glad my gf found this place, I loved the ambiance and the food/wine and the service was excellent. The place itself is dimly lit, with candles on all the tables. It's a intimate and cozy space, with a nice bar front and center and small tables on the outskirts of the bar. Perfect place for a date, or a girls night out like we had. We sat down and immediately ordered an excellent bottle of sparkling from France. They have a fantastic wine menu, both by the glass and by the bottle with prices that are very reasonable. For dinner we snagged the mixed olives, artichoke & crab dip, roasted cauliflower and beet salad. Everything was excellent. The artichoke and crab dip was my favorite, it was served in a hot skillet with toasted bread on the side. So much cheese, yum! The roasted cauliflower came with panko-gremolata and was so good, we ordered two. The beet salad was nice and light and paired nicely with the goat cheese, walnuts and tarragon vinaigrette. ...As any wine lover knows, you can't leave a wine bar without cheese and charcuterie, so we ordered a second bottle of bubbles and did the 6 selections for $33. We choose 4 cheeses and 2 meats which came with slices of toasted bread, home made pickles, and whole grain mustard. Everything was fantastic. Our waitress, Sarah, really knew her stuff too, she was great. We're all in varying aspects of the food and wine industry, so we were asking some in-depth questions, but she was on top of her game! My only minor complaint was the small stool like seats with no backs. My back and my legs started to hurt after while, but everything else was excellent!",5,2,2
8,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1897,811,3.0,1/31/2018,"Ardesia is a romantic little wine bar hidden away on a quiet street, ideal for dates or grabbing a drink with a girlfriend. It has quite an alluring charm to it. I don't think you should go with parties of more than four. Walked in on a weekday at 8 and sat at one of the empty high top tables. I got the garlic shrimp skewers and the roasted cauliflower dishes. The eight shrimp pieces were very small, super garlicky, and pretty standard. The cauliflower was my favorite, as it's got a lot of breading over it that gave it taste, but it is admittedly oily. They're pretty small for the price, definitely tapas-style, but they're pretty tasty and were enough for the time being. My company got a sparkling red wine that ""has a kick to it."" I thought it was way too strong for my tastes, but I'm a child when it comes to alcohol. We also split the ice cream sandwich - it's so good! Service was on top of things until it was bill time and no one could be found. Argh! But they were friendly and professional when it came to ordering, bringing out food, and water refills. Saw some signs for a Superbowl party and an Oscar viewing party, even though there was no TV in sight, but I wonder how those events are!",4,2,5
9,Ryan R.,"New York, NY",730,1659,149,3.0,1/1/2018,"Went here with my family to grab a small bite to eat after seeing a show at the theater.After perusing the menu, we decided to split a few things:Croquettes (2.5 stars): The croquette of the day was of the ham and cheese variety--needless to say, I wasn't impressed.Spiced lamb skewer (3 stars): These had decent flavor, but were overcooked.Roasted cauliflower (4 stars): Probably my favorite dish of the night--had a nice char, but were a little soggy from the oil in the dish.Pulled pork sliders (4 stars): These were also very good--and at a decent price point as well.Overall, this place is mainly a wine bar that serves up some small ""tapas-sized"" dishes. Though there are a couple decent items, I was pretty underwhelmed overall.",2,,1
10,Chris G.,"Philadelphia, PA",1,21,0,5.0,7/28/2018,"Found this place on Yelp, as i was going to visit a friend in the area last weekend, but had to kill a couple of hours before hand.  Found it very easy, and from the outside it had a modern exterior.  Entering, I thought the place was on the smaller side (from a Philly perspective, maybe not from a NY perspective) so I could easily see this place filling up pretty quick. Sat at the bar, swung through the wine list, but my eyes fell on the rose summer flight, so i needed to get that.  4/5 of the wines were good, and would potentially get again.  Bartender was good, as i appreciate the type that comes around infrequently when not necessary, but it always attentive when necessary.  Ended up also getting a charcuterie / cheese board and a few other apps, and everything was great.Overall, would highly recommend, as the service was good, wine was good, food was good, and ambience was good.  Have to give it w 5/5.*Just to add, there is also plenty of outdoor seating too, which in cool weather / at night it probably great!",,,
11,Melville G.,"New York, NY",113,324,577,4.0,10/6/2017,"This is a really charming wine bar! It's not necessarily something you'd stumble upon but the quiet location it is in makes the ambiance all the more intimate.The place is done up beautifully inside and out. The inside is warm and inviting and the outside is nicely decorated with plants and lights. We came here on a balmy Saturday evening and really enjoyed our time on the outside seating area.The service here is really friendly and the server helped us pick some great wines. We wanted something small to nibble on so we got some Smores (which were just way too sweet). Haven't tried any of the other food here but maybe I'll give it a try next time.Really wonderful, romantic place to come with a date and grab a drink or two.",,,

I'm not a huge drinker but I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine and a small light bite for dinner.  The grilled garlic shrimp skewer is my favorite.  It's delicious and perfectly portioned.  Service is prompt, efficient, and friendly.  Outdoor seating is relaxing and quiet.  Inside seating is intimate and elegant. Love it!",1,,
13,April B.,"Pearland, TX",0,28,38,2.0,12/5/2017,"A rainy night in the city made me look for someplace walkable from my hotel. I found Ardesia, but should have walked further. The place was crowded and loud, even early in the evening, but the menu options sounded good, so I wanted to give it a try. I ordered a selection of the smallplates, and a glass of port. The port was the best part of the evening. The Croquettes weren't much more than deep fried cheese curds, the lamb skewers were well-dead, and the Brussels sprouts had too much fish sauce added too late in the sautée process and were so pungent they were almost inedible. The kicker that will prevent me from coming back is the staple I found in the shrimp skewer. Very glad I take my time eating my food. The server was great and let me know they would comp the shrimp and my drink, which was appreciated, but won't get me to return.",4,1,1

16,Margaret C.,"Mount Sinai, NY",496,17,8,5.0,6/2/2018,"Came here for a friend's birthday and this place was wonderful. They have a great outdoor seating area, several tables inside, and a bar top. The vibe is really enjoyable and not too loud. This is a great spot for a date or a mellow girls night. We got two glasses of rose and Cabernet, both were amazing. And we ordered the croquettes (they're truly the best I've ever had), the NY pretzels and the cheese plate. Everything was exceptional.",2,,

For drinks i ordered the perfect raincoat, their version of an old fashioned. This came complete with a large ice cube and orange peel. So good i ordered 3 of them!We opted to order their combination of six for $33 - 3 charcuterie and 3 cheeses. Honestly we suggested the waiter to recommend ( Lenhart ) and he delivered on point. The only negative is their happy hour specials which wasn't really attractive. Just $2 off their wine. Bummer! Still, great place to grab drinks and enjoy conversation with great company.",1,,2
18,Laura G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3,23,55,5.0,10/2/2017,Cute wine bar in a quiet area with out-of-this-word burrata!We wanted to find a nice wine bar with happy hour on a Friday evening and we hit the jackpot with this one! They have happy hour from Monday through Friday from 5-7pm which gives you $2 off any glass of wine and draft beer. There are over 35 wines offered by the glass.We also loved the burrata served with bacon-bourbon jam & toasted Amy's bread. The devils see eggs and homemade NY style pretzels were also delicious!,,,

Dined outside and Matt was our waiter for the evening. Super sweet cozy place actually. Idk.. I kind of wish there were more food items listed on the menu rather than a never ending list of wines Totally get it, a wine bar but ugh how much can a person drink versus eat.. I know I can certainly munch the evening away. Anyway service was great no complaints.Thanks Matt!

21,Melissa T.,"New York, NY",0,8,0,5.0,5/31/2018,"Ardesia was great! I was looking for a cute little wine bar close to my partner and I's apartment with amazing success. We were greeted by Mandy (HUGE shoutout to Mandy!! She was extremely sweet and very knowledgeable about the wine and cheese selections, not to mention very fun to chat with), who sat us outside and was very accommodating when the weather turned cold and we moved inside. My partner and I tried a variety of the cheeses, all really great, especially the Gouda! When we were indecisive, we asked Mandy to surprise us with another type of cheese. All of the cheeses come with a small complimentary side, such as the Gouda coming with some sort of cinnamon cookie and the Camembert with petite potato chips. Ardesia is intimate, cozy, with all of the servers very friendly. Definitely will be frequenting this place in the future!",1,,

Fire the cook PLEASE. Do your establishment justice for the near future. First time I came with a good friend visiting from out of town. We read good reviews on the wine selections however read too many bad reviews in regards to the food and it's entirety. But decided to give it a try using our own judgement and opinions. We now regret not using the reviews instead. I wasted money on ordering food that I nor my companion ate. My companion felt a bit I'll after eating the lamb which wasn't cooked right. The sliders were over cooked. Not to mention the loud music which interfered with our intimate convo we were trying to have. And was the chef going back and forth outside in his uniform during business hours!??? How unsanitary.,1,1,
26,Deanna Z.,"Long Island, NY",26,38,110,5.0,1/19/2017,"Cute wine bar, great for dates. Came here with my boyfriend last weekend. The food was excellent and the staff was very accommodating. While we were sitting down, a group of girls next to us knocked our red wine all over our table and ice cream sandwich (what nerve!). When we told our waitress she was kind enough to bring us 2 new glasses of wine, another ice cream sandwich, and club soda for my boyfriend's pants!!!! I personally thought that she went above and beyond in terms of great service. The food was great. We got a cheese plate, the soft pretzel, lamb skewers, shrimp skewers, the croquette special (chorizo) and the ice cream sandwich. The cheese plate was elaborate with graham crackers, bread, and honey. The soft pretzel was awesome. Comes with mustard and a cheese sauce and comes with two nice sized pretzels-- highly recommend! The skewers were pretty good, but they only come with two. I personally liked the shrimp over the lamb and could've done without the latter. The croquettes were a must! So so sooooooo delicious-- my favorite part of the meal! For dessert, we had a choice between pistachio and strawberry for our ice cream sandwich. We chose strawberry, it was good but it was a little too frozen for my liking. Overall, I had a great time at this intimate wine bar and would love to come back for another date night.",,,1

39,Jem S.,"Brooklyn, NY",32,441,166,4.0,5/31/2016,"Ardesia is recommended for its list of drinks that includes a handful of cocktails and wines. It's not really a place one would go to eat a full meal. They serve small plates (not unlike tapas) to share with others, but don't expect a huge selection.My friend and I ordered the lamb skewers, devilled eggs, beets salad, and burrata. The lamb skewers were cooked well and flavoured nicely. The meat didn't taste super gamey, which I liked. The devilled eggs were mediocre and the only interesting thing about them was that they were topped with a piece of pork rind. The beets salad was delicious with walnuts and soft goat cheese. Instead of the traditional red beets, they used golden ones. It was probably my favourite plate. The burrata was a close second. It is served with toasted Amy's bread and a jam that contains bacon. As a result, the jam was sweet but also had salty elements. The burrata tasted good on the bread and jam.I would recommend Ardesia as an intimate and relatively quiet date spot for drinks and one or two plates to share (or dessert). The ambience inside the restaurant was great as it was dark and not loud at all. The outside had a string of lights on the wall that made the outdoor space cosier. Despite being in Hell's Kitchen, Ardesia was like a romantic getaway from the bustle of the city.",1,,

We also spent our NYE here as a party so we have had a range of experiences - all wonderful though!It's a very quaint, intimate wine bar and doesn't get too busy as far as I have seen. Their wine list, as you'd expect, is extensive with a great selection (hello rosé season!) but also priced pretty reasonably and their bottles are priced well also. They have a lot of local NY choices which is great, like Wolffer Estates for example. They have a large range of charcuterie which is a decent size, as well as another page of lighter food items to share. They also have a large tv above the bar and have a number of events there. Their NYE celebration was great and very reasonable! And I loved not trying to kill someone to get a drink - it was busy but not obnoxious, exactly what we were going for.

I've seen this place pop up on Yelp before but it's just a little too out of my way. If you live in the neighborhood though then this is a great spot for you. They have happy hour specials, a great wine selection, good food, and there is outdoor seating during warm weather. We shared a few things including the burrata and roasted cauliflowers. The cauliflowers took me by surprise. I mean, really, they are the most unassuming vegetable and nobody ever loves cauliflowers. But these were so yummy I was inspired to make my own version at home. All in all we had a good time and I'll keep this place in mind if I'm in that area again.",3,,2
48,greg w.,"New York, NY",16,412,1,5.0,8/27/2017,Went for dinner and drinks on Friday night and we sat outside.  The night couldn't have been more beautiful.  Now for the food and service... Started off with a Caesar salad which was normal and then had the deviled eggs .  Also had the lamb and skirt steak which were both cooked perfect.Drinks all looked really good!  I had my usual vodka Martinis.  The service was excellent!,,,
49,Diane W.,"Manhattan, NY",110,160,330,4.0,2/23/2015,"Came here for Valentine's Day dinner with the bf. Lovely ambience, really perfect for date night or a girls night out! One side of the restaurant isa bar, with a chalkboard wall and the wine menu handwritten which was a cute touch. The seating had couches along the perimeter of the room, giving it a lounge-like feel.The food itself was delicious! I had been wanting to try burrata for the longest time, and was super excited to see it on the menu. It was my favorite out of everything we ordered - the texture was rich and creamy, yet was light in flavor. It also came with this caramelized onion (?) spread that was sooo good mixed with the cheese.The quail egg toast was really yummy! I think the bacon really made it though - typical. Only gripe is that it came with 2 pieces of toast, each only about 3-bites big. Lastly we ordered the pulled pork sliders. The meat was tender and flavorful, but these were pretty standard. The saltiness was a bit too overpowering as well. I loved the tiny potato chips that came with it though! Overall, Ardesia is a really nice place to share some tasty small plates before heading out for a night on the town. It is a little far from the subway and the prices are steep for the amount of food you get. I would give this place 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding it up because the atmosphere was great and I had a good time there!",,,
50,Sarah B.,"Bristol, CT",18,97,11,5.0,9/21/2016,"Loved the wine selection. The bar tender was knowledgeable and suggested a great wine for me. Nice ambiance at the bar or the tables. Didn't stay for meals but the ones coming out around us looked amazing. We did have the buratta, and that was to die for. The bar tender even suggested other places for us to try later in the evening and we took him up on his suggestion and had a great time.",3,1,1

54,Riva L.,"Washington, DC",446,256,168,2.0,6/17/2016,"2.5 stars for...good drinks, OK food, bad service.The good: the drinks. We all tried a lillet spritzer with amazing flavor. It was light, fresh, and refreshing. It had a good complex flavor of lemony bitters. The atmosphere is also great. We sat on the patio and I love the lights.The OK: we ordered two cheeses and one charcuterie. Dang, these were overpriced. We kind of expected...a quantity of cheese and meat for more than one person? As opposed to 3 bites worth of cheese and four slices of sausage. That's ridiculous. The cheeses were great but they need to step up their portion game. The bad: we met our waitress, we ordered with our waitress, we didn't see her again for over an hour. Even as she passed us by and we called out ""excuse me! Miss!"" repeatedly. We has ordered cookies and an hour later they still had not shown up. When we asked about them (after a lot of waving our hands and eventually literally running after her through the restaurant) she goes ""oh they'll be out in 15."" Really?? Just say you forgot about them. And please learn to check up on your tables. A table with three empty drinks and three empty plates should be checked in on. If she hadn't disappeared for so long, I probably would have ordered another drink. It was not busy enough for the innatentiveness to be even remotely acceptable.",2,,
55,Lee M.,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",127,58,63,5.0,5/24/2015,"My quest to find all the great small plates restaurants in the world is now one restaurant closer to being completed, and this is not just another check on the list, it is definitely a jewel to which I will return again and again! The setting is beautiful and fun, the drinks are varied and probably all delicious, and the service is calm and friendly. Even with all of these great attributes, what is truly remarkable about this place is the food. I've been having dreams about it for the past two days since I ate there, and yesterday my mouth started watering as I walked past!The small plates here are truly small plates. They are perfect if you just want a snack, but they also work well for dinner. We started off with the soft pretzels, which were incredible. A dressed-up take on the typical New York street food, these pretzels are a little smaller than what you normally find-with an outer layer that is perfectly crispy and a soft, doughy inside-and they're accompanied by dijon and a killer house-made cheese sauce (don't worry about what it's doing to your arteries: it must be healthy for you if you're eating it at a chic/hipster wine bar, right?).After the pretzels came some delicious sugar snap peas with some sort of a zesty ricotta/lemon festival on top. Along with the peas came a plate of asparagus with balsamic glaze and fried egg. These plates were both delightful and combined some wonderful spring flavors.My boyfriend and I had almost forgotten that we had ordered one more plate, and like anyone who knows they're the real star of the party, the Pulled Pork Sliders showed up last. Now, pulled pork is really a great food; I don't think I've ever had a bad pulled pork dish. But just as it is really hard to mess up, I think it's equally hard to make it truly exceptional. These sliders were truly exceptional. The plate came with two sliders, which were about two to three inches in diamiter. The buns were light and fluffy, with just a little bit of garlic butter brushed on them as they were toasted, and the pulled pork inside was unbelievable. Tangy, spicy, sweet, juicy, and delicious. It was a really perfect end to the meal. I wanted to keep the flavor in my mouth so much that I passed on dessert!All-in-all the bill came to $65 for two people (including one drink each) before the tip. Not exactly cheap, but a great price for a nice date!",2,1,2

""Sorry we are making you work?!"" She made it clear she didn't want to deal with us. Even though we were all in our 30s, respectable, professionals here on a business trip. We planned to have dinner there, since the Yelp reviews were so great, but ended up just getting a round of drinks and going to Totto Ramen just a block away for dinner.

I was surprised to see they had one of my favorite beers, left hand stout (recommend if you're into dark beers). If you order it, let it sit for a few minutes after pouring because it tends to be more foamy and milky than other beers.We ordered one soft cheese and a salami the server recommended that by standard came with a mustard spread, a pate? and a flavorful cauliflower side, enough for us to satisfyingly pick on with our drinks.  the bill came out to $30 bucks (not bad at all!) Not sure if it was a busy night, but I do think the servers should check up on their tables more often to see if they need anything. Not a big deal, but luckily we weren't in a rush.Outdoor seating is very quaint, romantic with beautiful lighting just like the inside.",,,

The sophisticated wine selection, service and scrumptious NY pretzels will not disappoint. Frankly, the entire menu is delectable, including the cheese selection. Keep in mind it's tapa size style. The setting is cosy and relaxedwith a ""hardly any noise "" outside seating arrangement to enjoy a warm evening. It's certainly a wine bar to indulge in, anytime you're in Hells Kitchen and far enough on the West Side of town.",,,

The staff are welcoming and helpful, the ambiance is dark, cool, and classy yet relaxed and understated. And I am a big fan of the menu. We ordered: -  Chicken liver toast -  Duck ban mi -  Goat cheese crostini -  Deviled eggs -  Lamb skewers -  Flank steak -  Wild boar salami -  Red wine and a don't fall off the roof cocktailI thoroughly enjoyed all of our dishes. My favorites were the chicken liver and the cheese crostini. I actually asked for extra bread twice. Maybe three times. Each of the dishes was well presented, made with quality ingredients, and designed to share easily. I can't say anything about the wine menu because it would probably kill me slowly, but other members of my group were more than satisfied with their selections. To end the evening, I bought in a cake, which was subject to a fee, but we were celebrating and I stopped caring. Overall, we left happy with our experience here and I would totally recommend.",,,

There's not much that far west and we were going to a concert nearby. It was a cute atmosphere and not too crowded. We both had a few glasses of the sparkling rose (wine by the glass is $2 off from 4-7.) We also ordered the croquettes, the burrata, a carmel ice cream sandwich, and the s'mores to share. The croquettes that day were chorizo and very good. The burrata was amazing. We asked the bartender for recommendations on what to order and he said the bacon-bourbon jam with the burrata was not to be missed. He definitely did not lead us awry. It was delicious. Dessert was just as good. The carmel ice cream sandwich was way better than your normal grocery store version. The s'mores were simple (how can you go wrong with graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallow?) but well done. They had a sort of smoky taste which made them reminiscent of a campfire. Overall, we were very pleased. The service was quick and friendly and I would happily return next time I'm in that part of town.",,,

When I think date spot, I think cozy, intimate, and maybe some lounge music in the background but relatively quiet so you can hear what the other person is trying to say. I went here on a Thursday night with a friend (not a date) so we could have a normal conversation over food and wine, and I could not, for the life of me, hear what she was saying half the time. At some point, we were shouting and sitting right next to each other. The music is LOUD and sounded like the Billboard's Top 100 playlist. Ordered ricotta crostinis, artichoke dip and a shrimp kebab as snacks. The food was bland with small portions and super expensive. Maybe I just went on a off-day but this place seems like it's for your recently graduated post-college crowd trying to be fancy.",4,4,2

Delicious. The burrata and beet salad were also divine; they'll bring out more bread for you with blinking an eye, as well.I don't find the tall tables as comfortable as a lower down tables, but there's a decent amount of seating.

Between my boyfriend and I, we order 4 tapas (quail egg, pulled pork buns, croquette, and lamb skewers), and a meat and cheese platter. We were making fun of how we didn't think we would be full from how much they provided on each dish. I have to say that the food was pretty well presented and tasted pretty good. The service was both fast and attentive. I would say that I would probably have gone elsewhere because of the mediocre food taste/selection, and moderately high cost.",,,
68,Tammy V.,"Queens, NY",20,79,12,5.0,9/18/2015,"Went to Ardesia last night with my husband and another couple. We sat outside, and it was a beautiful night. We were very impressed! It began with great service from Daniel. He was attentive and had great wine recommendations for us. He answered any questions we had with a smile and he was on top of everything.We ate and drank plenty. I recommend the Alborino to those liking an elegant white. It's like a sauv blanc without the tartness. I think I love Alborino, this is the 3rd one I've tried lately. We then switched to a bottle of Chardonnay, which was very nice. It has some oak, so if you don't like oak, maybe steer clear, but the oak was not overwhelming. It was a good, balanced wine. A couple in our group were drinking the Syrah. It was from Europe, so they said it was lighter than the Syrah's here, but they enjoyed it so they ordered a bottle.The small plates were really good. We liked the burratta so much, we ordered another one almost immediately! There was a hard cheese that Daniel recommended that he said would be the closest thing to a parmesan, and let me tell you, my cousin and I said we could eat a block of that delicious cheese. I wish I remembered the name of it. Ask Daniel!Then, that amazing pretzel came out with two dipping sauces. The table also had steak skewers, shrimp skewers and deviled eggs. I love eggs, but deviled eggs always kind of grossed me out, but these were delicious. I didn't try the shrimp and the piece of steak I had was a little tough.Anyway, we will be back to enjoy this cute place. Thanks for a great night!",1,1,1

I had a summer salad, some crostinis, and a cheese plate. none impressed. my friend had a meat plate and wasn't impressed, either. the crostini are essentially just bread and cream cheese, and the bean sprouts in the salad were salted way too heavily.The best thing I had was the cheese plate. the cheese itself was really good. unfortunately their signature bread was nearly inedible so I could've saved myself the time and bought cheese at the grocery store.

The pork slider was so disgustingly sweet and had an herbal taste that did not compliment the dish. The burrata was dense (which defeats the purpose of a soft cheese) and both bread and cheese tasted stale.

88,Tamara H.,"Manhattan, NY",121,353,373,3.0,1/7/2013,"This was ok. I'm not much for a seating arrangement here- came for a birthday party and the space was very small, seats uncomfortable, tables too low, and barely any table space.They forgot to bring our cheese platter. Then, I told them to bring out a dessert for someone's birthday. Instead of nicely presenting it with a ""happy birthday"" they just placed this wrapped ice cream bar on the table. We were confused and didn't know what it was. It was awkward (though it turned out delicious).The wine was good though and about 60% of the tapas were good:1) Deviled eggs- good2) Shrimp - not so good, swimming in oil3) Spiced Lamb skewers- OK, nothing special here4) Seared steak - good5) pretzel - good6) beet salad - good7) roasted cauliflower- OK8) duck manh mi - not so good, barely any duck pate 9) ice cream sandwich- great10) cured meat - OK I would not necessarily rush back here.",3,,

92,Maeve C.,"Brooklyn, NY",200,331,2,5.0,8/22/2014,"UMMMM, WHAT???Apparently there's an adorable and romantic tapas bar outside of the West Village. Is this even allowed?I came to Ardesia with my bf and two other couples, and we spent far too long (and far too much money) eating endless small plates and drinking wine. The Greatest Hits List is as follows:- Burratta with bacon jam and farmhouse bread- Goat cheese ricotta crostini- Lamb skewers with yogurt dipping sauce- Roasted asparagus with shaved cheese, a fried egg, and balsamic reduction- Shrimp skewersThe summer salad and flank steak were decent but the above listed were well worth it, and we definitely ordered seconds of those. For dessert, the homemade ice cream sandwich is amazingly delicious, and you should definitely ask about the cookie of the day. The s'mores are a cool idea but lacking in execution, so give those a pass as well. If you're looking for a spot to entertain out-of-towners, go on a date, or just treat yoself, hit up Ardesia.",3,2,2

The service was great when you could find a server. Our main issue was locating a server - there seemed to be 2 servers for both the inside and outside patrons. Perhaps someone called in sick but we were always wanting more water and had to wait quite a while before we could ask for more bread. It was also a bit uncomfortably warm. The bar was nowhere near full of people and we loved the atmosphere but we actually wanted to leave because it was so warm inside. The cheese plate was great and well presented. The food was all on point if a touch pricey. Good food, great service when you could find a server, please turn on the AC.I'm definitely willing to give it another shot and see if they were just short a server (who controls the AC) that night.",,,

Would like to go back and try some of their more exotic tapas - duck bang mi, quail egg toast, chicken liver mousse. Menu was a bit all over the place and the dessert menu was pretty unimaginative. Menu Recommendations:  Suggest better pairing of wine and food and also including recommendations on the food menu as to what wines might go well with each item. Its a pretty eclectic menu so its hard to figure out what would go best together. Service Recommendations:  Suggest that they do not keep the dish cart by the tables, our waitress kept banging used plates into the cart and this occurred almost every few minutes. She continued to do so even after someone put in a complaint with other staff. She was also pretty rude and short when it came to answering questions about the menu and clearing our table when we were clearly still eating and drinking. Ambience:  Really nice outdoor seating and very chill, relaxed, and away from the hustle and bustle of midtown. Inside was just as chill.",3,,

The duck part of it was minimal.The mangalitsa ham was delicious.

There's a good selection of cheeses and charcuterie, but also sliders, pretzels and other nibbles. The bartender was quick with recommendations and honest assessments of the menu. He described the evening's special, a chicken liver mousse, as ""intense and iron-y,"" which freaked out my friend but sounded delicious to me. And it was! The wine selection is also good, but more limited if you drink by the glass instead of by the bottle. The decor in the restaurant is comfortable, yet chic. I met friends and we sat at the bar,but there ate also plenty of tables with plush cushions. It seems like a great place for a date or a catch-up night with friends.",,,

Very sleek and modern.So, good beer and good staff.  Will have to go back next time I'm in NYC and try out the food.This looks to be one of those hidden gems.  So, come on, New Yorkers, keep this place in business.

I've been to better wine bars, in terms of food, the ambiance etc. However, the decent service wins Ardesia another half star. FOODI read upon the reviews before going there and ordered the hyped steak. Meh. yeah the green sauce is less commonly seen but it's quite bland. WINEprobably the only place that I have tasted decent Spanish wines. not bad!AMBIANCEWatch out ladies, the place is **especially cold ** for a wine bar. bundle up a bit if you plan to stay long the place is also kinda big for a wine bar and the day we went there was an happy-hour crowd.... hmmm luckily they are not rowdy, but there is a risk for being too huge you know SERVICElast but not hte least, very friendly waitress :) I asked her about the wine since I really enjoyed it. She went back to the bar and got me more info, written down on their biz card. very friendly and knows how to do business. Thumbs up!Overall it's a safe bet to take your friends/coworkers. Won't impress others much either",,,

Quiet, intimate and beautiful but very small tapas/wine bar a short walk from the theatre district but sufficiently far away from the crowds and madness. You would not stumble on this place by accident that's for sure. We had about 6 different small plates and all were excellent. Reasonable selection of wines by the glass including some nice Spanish and Argentine reds (my favorite). Much larger selection by the bottle of course.",,,

Note to self: This isn't traditional Spanish tapas but rather that all their dishes are small plates. Nonetheless, the food and drinks were definitely one of the best tapas in NYC I've had so far.  The restaurant handled a big group (about 20-25 people) pretty well.  Other than the champagne and drinks that were flowing, we ordered multiple orders of the deviled eggs (with pickled jalapeño and pork rind), ricotta crostini, garlic shrimp skewers, burrata (with bacon-bourbon jam), beet salad (with fresh goat cheese, citrus, walnuts, and vinaigrette), arugula salad (with Pecorino Romano and lemon vinaigrette) and seared flank steak with salsa verde.  Everything was pretty amazing.  But the standouts of the night were the garlic shrimp skewers, flank steak, and my personal favorite, the burrata.  Oh my G! Words cannot even describe the burrata. I think if given the option, I could just eat the burrata over and over again.Overall, highly recommended for a date night or night out with friends!",2,1,2

Since i did not order anything else i can not judge the rest of the menu but the pretzels were amazing.Per order you get two pretzels with mustard and cheese sauce on the side, it is an appetizer on the menu. They were amazing, darker than regular pretzels, soft, had a buttery taste to them, just the right amount or salt. Has to be the best pretzel i had in NYC and i have had a whole bunch of them.Also would like to point out that cheese sauce that came with order also was very good.",,1,

The duck banh mi is also a must try. Everything was really good so I highly recommend trying everything! Loved this place and I'll definitely be back. It is a little out of the way, but it's definitely worth checking out. Super cute place for a first date or a tenth date. It isn't extremely loud in this place, but it also isn't super quiet.

Not only was she rude but she knew nothing about the wine. She never smiled and it honestly seemed like she hated her job.We ordered 6 cheeses and probably should have doubled the order because the portion sizes were very very small. I don't even know if it would have been adequate for 2 people. We also ordered pretzels and they were burnt.Bottom line, there are much better places in Hells Kitchen.

109,Catherine S.,"Atlanta, GA",114,206,1243,4.0,7/27/2011,"Spent about 2 hours here with a 15+ group to kick off a Saturday night of 30th Birthday celebrating. We had half of their lounge area (big open seating on a large wraparound couch) for us and had several waiters stop by often once the party got going. Wine selection covers the old/new world geographies with a good variety of pricing. The location is a little out of the way, but worth for the non-cramped, don't-have-to-scream-to-be-heard setting. Atmosphere is just like in the photos from the website - clean lines on all the furniture, high ceilings and just the right amount of candlelight. A girlfriend recommended this place after going on a date here and having a great wine and food experience. She was less into the guy, and that part didn't work out, but Ardesia did! I would recommend this place for any group gathering that is looking for a classy place that is fun and easy to plan. Party / Group Planning Process: I called about 2 weeks prior to the event to reserve a spot. This process was low pressure and painless - not like most places in NYC! There was no deposit demanded and no minimum spend promised. They were flexible on time and did not cap our reservation. Ardesia has a simple system of options for drinks and food for groups and one document that explains it all (ranging from unlimited pours for 2 hours at a certain price and a la carte with food pre-ordered...). They also have a very nice event coordinator who was very responsive to emails. I went with a la carte drinks and pre-ordered 4 platters of food (crostini with ricotta was the runaway favorite) a few days before the event.",6,,

The tapas were all amazing and the summer night was perfect for dining outside. We ordered the deviled eggs, lamb skewers, garlic shrimp, and the beet salad. While the food and service was great, the portions felt rather small, even for tapas.Fyi - there's a great pizza spot to pick up a few slices on the way back if you're staying at the Hudson hotel.

115,Jessica L.,"Queens, NY",56,17,0,5.0,1/22/2014,"I don't know if I have enough words of praise to say about the staff at this wine bar. The drinks were great, the food was delicious, but it is the service that cemented the night I had as amazing.I made a reservation for 2 people at 7pm the night before; I'd heard 6:30 is when this place gets super busy and I wanted to get straight to catching up. Then I found out we'd actually be 3 people and that they'd like to switch to meeting at 6:30 instead. The hostess/server took this change in stride even though she wasn't informed until we showed up early, and the interior already packed.We aren't big wine drinkers, so we started off okay with hard ciders and beers; there was no pressure to order large wine bottles, and when we did switch to other drinks with some questions, our same server offered suggestions that left us extremely satisfied.Every plate we ordered was delicious, and only really ""failed"" in direct comparison to other dishes that same night. Definitely get the roasted cauliflower; pulled pork sliders had a nice sauciness that wasn't overpowering as some renditions can get; quail egg toast was buttery and rich. The lamb skewers had decent-sized chunks of lamb that were liberally spiced, but we ended up leaning towards the tender garlicky - and smaller - shrimp skewers. Even the beet salad we ordered (for obligatory vegetables) was fresh and flavorful. We probably could've used more bread for the chicken liver pate (smooth and not too heavy on the tongue or stomach) to begin with; but we were too full to accept their offer to bring more bread - probably shouldn't have ordered that last.With house-made charcuterie and a large cheese selection on offer, we felt we had to at least give it a try. Knowing nothing about either, we pestered our server for information and more suggestions. (This girl was amazing for putting up with our uneducated selves.) The slate of Saucisson was a hit; the recommended cheese (which I can't remember the name of now, but it was a mix of cow and probably goat milk) suited our palates perfectly, mild and creamy as we had asked for. We were kind of shocked at first that it was a small slice for $6 together with the bread, but it turns out we didn't need that much cheese on the bread anyway.I would be remiss to not include dessert. I'm not much of a dessert fiend, but my two friends certainly were. The desserts seem simple, but one order of S'mores and one order of fresh-baked cookies (the flavor of the day was chocolate peanut butter) later, the decision was unanimous: another more round of cookies! The strawberry ale we ordered as a dessert beer to go with it was addictive.It's a bit far from the subway (at least 2.5 avenues over), but it was well worth the trip. The food and drinks are extremely satisfying, and as admittedly out-of-place as we could've felt, we were always made to feel comfortable. Though I'm someone who doesn't live in the neighborhood, I can't wait to head back.",1,,

This place is no exception - really great variety, and everything we had was delicious!I had seen on Yelp that the Quail Egg Toast was pretty killer, so we tried that...and it lived up to the hype! Creamy and yummy and wonderful. Also had the beet salad, which was good, but distinctly forgettable, and the lamb skewers, which were perfect. But the highlight was definitely the Quail Egg Toast. I still can't get over it. Damn.Downside? I had made reservations for an old friend and I, and even with them, we got stuck at a table right next to the door with the cold wind blowing all over us anytime someone entered/exited. Whiny nit-picky? Maybe. But still, it definitely made the experience slightly less enjoyable.This place has a really great vibe, neat chalkboard motif and some pretty hip clientele. I was definitely a fan, even with the crowded-not-great-table-ness, and I'm sure I'll be back soon! Mostly to try some more wine.

So glad that my second experience didn't disappoint and that Ardesia is still as solid as before. Everyone raved about the food, everything was delicious. We had a variety of bites throughout the evening, but I would highly recommend the burrata, ricotta crostini, and the sugar snap peas. A couple people in our group have celiac, so it was super helpful to see items marked on the menu as gluten free. We mostly had the rose champagne (couldn't get enough!), but their wine list and beer selection is really great and has something for everyone. The service we received was outstanding, as well - attentive and patient with our large group and great advice for selections. And if you want to hear the people you're with and not have to fight over limited space, this is the place to go.

The other two male staff were friendly apart from one kept forgetting our wines and chatting to people at the bar rather than waiting on tables.

I'm pregnant so I couldn't eat many of the cheeses that were unpasteurized or soft, and our waiter went above and beyond to tell me which ones were hard and most likely more safe. He then offered to have the kitchen make me something off the regular menu, even though they were only serving the happy hour menu. It was so kind and we were blown away by how helpful and accommodating they were. Another server came by and offered to put flowers I brought for my sister in a vase, and brought them back out to us in water, which was so thoughtful!

The salt cod brandade and creamy quail egg toast were both incredible. Oh, and they paired perfectly with whatever red wine the waitress said they paired perfectly with. The shrimp and chorizo dish and the butter lettuce salad with buttermilk dressing didn't stand out by comparison to the first two, but ultimately, I'd have eaten any of it with pleasure.

133,Chris H.,Hong Kong,173,603,2140,4.0,12/3/2010,"Is it about the journey?  Or the destination?Given Ardesia's far flung BFE location, one could make the argument that it's a 'destination' venue - and you would be correct.  The well curated menu of tapas, hard to pronounce cheeses and house made charcuterie is almost too sophisticated for the Hells Kitchen locale, but worth the schlep.  Plump, intensely juicy cocktail sausages with a shmear of spicy mustard was an instant hit, as was the trio of crostini, each generously adorned with a fresh ricotta, excellent chicken liver mousse, and a sweet kobocha squash puree.  A duck banh mi was less successful than I had envisioned - the proportions were wildly skewed in favor of zingy pickled carrots, while stingy with the duck pate and cilantro.  The salt cod croquettes were mushy, instead of fluffy like a proper buñuelos de bacalao (which is what I believe Ardesia was shooting for... they missed this time).In the case of Ardesia's wine list, it's all about the journey.  The wines are impressive, yet given the selection of wines-by-the-glass, they're accessible and affordable.  It's far to easy to linger past your bed time, progressing through a global itinerary of wines culled from Ardesia's impressive menu and erudite bar keep.   To quip on that pesky vis-à-vis - something about the merits of the journey vs. the destination - in Ardesia's case, it's definitely both.",7,2,7

After what seemed like hours of chatting, two rounds of drinks, and snacks - we were over the moon with this place. I especially loved how everyone around us that night were in the same mellow mode.

To your far left, there is a comfy couch nook, straight ahead is the bar and to your left and right are sit down tables.They have a generous wine list as well as food menu from Artisanal Cheeses to Duck Banh Mi?! Yes, Duck Banh Mi. Did I try it? Unfortunately, no but we did order a cheese plate to accompany our wine.

139,Mykel B.,"New York, NY",366,463,39,3.0,3/31/2013,"It's pricey. Cost us about $45 each, and that was with NO MAIN DISHES. The service was great though, with our waiter, friendly, chatty, and always on the spot. I wish I could remember his name to single him out with a compliment, but it's completely slipped my easily slippable mind. (He has a Japanese fiancée. I remember that.)The main problem-- at least on the night we were there-- is that the good-looking menu reflects someone's imagination, and not the reality of the stock. Could I have a ""bored housewife,"" I asked. (Yeah, it was embarrassing, but the first one tasted so good!) ""Sorry, sold out."" ""How 'bout a refill on the Magners?"" ""All sold out."" ""How 'bout ANY cider?"" ""Sorry, none left."" And so it went. We moved to the few things that were available, and they were very good. The lamb and shrimp skewers (three little ones for something double digit), and they were EXCELLENT as were the olives ($8 for a small plate).The atmosphere is  low key and friendly. Some single tables in the back seem quite romantic. Come with a full wallet, and pick a back-up item when you order... maybe two back-ups. --Drink Club NYC is a roving group of NY imbibers, a different bar every week.",1,1,

146,Laura A.,"Brooklyn, NY",234,344,1231,4.0,8/13/2012,"Yelp app assure that I am a Regular at Ardesia, without even knowing that I have actually been there even more. And I don't have any intention for that to change. Truth is, not everything is perfect. However, Ardesia has so many elements done right that it will surely got you without noticing. Go more than once and you will be sold. Like many other things in life you need to like what you see and looks and presentation are impeccable here. Ardesia is in my opinion one of the most charming places in town. The central theme, and for what I guess the name stands for, is slate (Ardesia in Italian). Look at their web site. Also focus on the huge chalkboard to your left when you come in. The menu is written there. But no worries, a very elegant written display of the menu will be provided to you. Everything else is harmonious; the color, the light, the metal elements. High ceilings and modern style from the lamps to the tables. The overall design is simple and chic. Seat at the bar or the high tables with stools. Or you may prefer the open room decorated as someones dining room with a sofa attached to the wall surrounding the whole room. But with individual tables separated enough to give you some intimacy. The wine menu is ingenuously classified as old world wines (European) versus new world wines (America, Australia, New Zealand and Africa) for both, red and white category. I find it to be ingenious because is not often you find it like this. And also it helps to find faster what you look for. For instance, my inclination goes most of the times to French or Spanish reds. Got it? red and old world. Voila, 3 sec. The selection will not disappoint although the offer by the glass seems a bit limited honestly; but it is certainly fair and a good selection. All what my friends and I have selected have never been disappointing. In fact, when I go for something else besides my preferences it is also being extremely pleasant. Last time we got a bottle of Zinfandel ""York Creek"" Ridge 2007, from Napa Valley ($66). It is an excellent choice. Please order. Another glass among my regulars here falls into the sparkling category. Yes my friend, you can also go bubbly if you want. The list is even shorter but there is great options in there. My recommendation: Raventos I Blanc L'Hereu, a cava (Spanish champagne) from 2009. Not too sweet, not acid either just pleasantly crispy and refreshing. At $10 the glass I find it to be incredibly fair. You may find interesting that during happy hour, week days from 5pm to 7pm, any glass of wine and draft beer is $2. I really have to say it here because I'm still astonished. Those are really old world prices. I wasn't impressed with their Duck Bahn Mi, neither their Pulled Pork sliders. It was long ago and I can't recall the precise reason, but it was enough for not order them again. I would recommend to go with the classics for wine. Cured meats and cheese. I still have in my mind the addicting nutty flavor left after every single bite of their Ricotta Ginepro cheese. And the intensity of their cayuga blue can't be missed as well. You should order one cheese selection per person in order to enjoy as the portions falls into the tiny category. Quail Egg Toast is another good thing to order. But mainly their Ricotta crostini, even when it is a bit oily and eventually salty, as well as the Burrata, a fresh Italian cheese made from mozzarella and cream, with an addictive texture that interestingly can also be eventually salty in certain bites. Finally, don't forget to order the German sausage plate: Weisswurst and braised sauerkraut . All good in there but that mustard is another thing that creates addiction. They should serve it just with bread by the pound. Arugula salad is simple and well executed and I have regret we haven't order more often since it adds the freshness that you will need to clean the palate in between bites and also it compensates the bold flavors that you may get in here. The major disappointment however came in form of dessert. Something to skip in my opinion if the offer is still the ice cream sandwich, the s'mores and even the fresh baked cookies. There is no more options in fact. Maybe the cookies will satisfy you. After all, they are served hot. Besides my critics and besides the desserts, Ardesia is certainly a place to become a regular. Given by the service also. Which is extremely pleasant. No one will rush you, not even after a couple of hours in there. And the fact that a woman is behind the business on a men world, is something worth to mention and to be considered I believe. But most importantly is about how you feel and a few words are coming to my mind: peace, calm, friends, intimacy and even romance could happen. Isn't it perfect after all?",11,6,8

The server gave me wonderful recommendations of hard cheese to pair with the Riesling I ordered. The Eins Zwei Dry ""3"" Riesling was delectably smooth with the right tint of sweetness and floral aroma to it. The server was a pleasure to chat with, and even poured me an extra glass on the house. The prices here are very reasonable and the quality of the cheese and wine are worth the price.

I recommend the Slate of Crostini (three different toppings on three pieces of toast). The pâté was amazing and I kinda wished I could have had more of it in a separate dish or just had the pâté on all the pieces of toast. The Burrata (buffalo mozzarella) was also good -- creamy and flavorful. The Duck Banh Mi sandwich was simultaneously salty, sour, sweet and slightly gamey from the duck. An interesting mix. My Pinot Bianco (Alois Lageder, Alto Adige) was a single-note crisp white wine which allowed the food to shine without drawing too much attention to itself.Our server was friendly and helpful, not shy at all with recommendations on the food and wine.

I wasn't able to book on Yelp due to not having a US phone number but an email to the restaurant requesting a table was promptly and positively responded to.Upon arrival, we were shown to our table and all ordered one of their summer liqueur spritzers - these were lovely and refreshing after a sticky, hot subway ride! We chose two dishes each and some olives to share. The portion sizes are on the small side so I would recommend ordering three dishes each. The food was delicious, however, just not quite big enough for myself and my friends. I had the beetroot salad and the garlic prawns, both of which I would highly recommend. The s'mores were amazing - they were so good that we had to order ""s'more"" once we finished the first lot.Co-owner Declan also bought us some drinks after hearing we were fellow celts which was an added bonus!I would recommend Ardesia for a quick drink or a meal and will definitely return next time I'm in NYC!",1,2,2

Our waitress was recommended a great wine that we had no problem finishing but I give Ardesia only 2-STARS because they RAN OUT of their lamb skewers, flank steak, and more than just a couple of their cheeses.

Beautifully lit, great music, ample wine selection and very generous space -- particularly as far as Manhattan is concerned.  Appears to be a patio that will allow outdoor seating when weather improves.  Will definitely be back but I might suggest that Andrew working the bar last evening improve his customer service as he was generally inattentive despite the place being nearly empty at 1am and lacked the courtesy to thank us for our patronage both while dropping the check on the table and in exiting the establishment.  It's these small yet important social skills that make all the difference.",,,

AMEN!), Ardesia somehow has that cozy atmosphere without making you feel like you're sitting on top of the person next to you. Our bartender/server, Tyler, was incredibly helpful and friendly.  He picked out a good wine for each of us, let us taste it, and helped pick out some great recommendations for their cheese platter (6 amazing cheese of your choice, totally worth $30).We also ordered the pork sliders and the shrimp/sausage dish - both of which were incredible.I'll definitely be back, especially when the weather warms up to enjoy their lovely outdoor seating!",,,

178,Elizabeth L.,"Manhattan, NY",3,13,8,5.0,12/25/2014,"I visited here with a friend last week. It was a great experience and we both agreed the offerings here were delicious. We split a bottle of Jura red wine from the nicely curated wine list, which was perfect for what we were looking for. We had the olives, lamb skewers, quail egg toast, deviled eggs, and the roasted cauliflower. The only thing that did not deliver was the lamb skewers, as they were not perhaps as full-flavored as they could have been, but were good anyhow. The olives were just right, the deviled eggs were light and yummy, the quail egg toast was amazing, second only to the cauliflower, which is perhaps the best thing there. DO NOT SKIP THIS DISH. We ate it like we needed five of the plates.At the end, we had the s'mores desserts, which were a nice version of exactly what you'd think of as a s'more. We also had the ginger ice cream sandwich, which was delicious and a nice note for the end of the meal. These we had with a glass of dessert wine each, the $8 one, which was a perfect end to our stay.Throughout our visit, service was great. All of the staff we talked to were very helpful and amiable, and I have no complaints. The bartenders in particular were friendly and efficient, and our dishes were spaced out nicely.",,,

I know you're thinking.. ""why in hell would you go to a wine bar for dessert, Juni?"" ...but the truth is after a delicious birthday dinner at Taboon, down the block from our building, we only went into Ardesia to check it out and give it a neighborly inspection. To our surprise, they have Smores and Ice Cream Sandwiches (different flavors available) on the menu, and both were delicious! I will certainly be back to enjoy their wide selection of wines, cheeses, and meats! We were too full to drink... i mean we barely finished dessert, but the wine list is quite fabulous and the glasses start at only $7. Ardesia is also very beautiful inside.. the combination of chalkboard wall, wooden stools and tables, dim lighting.. it all adds to a very chill and relaxing atmosphere.

I arrived earlier than my cheeky monkey friend and they let me sit down wherever I wanted, nice!Their wine menu is broken down by Old World whites and reds and New Worlds whites and reds. The menu lacks description, but you can ask the server and they'll explain anything you need to know. The snacks menu is awesome, I wish I had been more hungry to try everything. I had the croquettes (béchamel and chorizo) and the spinach and crab dip with Amy's bread. Oh Lord, the dip was good! Very rich and had a strong crab presence. Drunk. Like seriously. I had a glass before I left my house, a glass while I waited for my friend, then we had two bottles.

186,Somin Y.,"Manhattan, NY",129,207,65,4.0,11/25/2013,"What a gem in hell's kitchen! So glad that I found another go-to spot for wine night with friends. Think wine selection and food here are definitely better than Casellula on the 52nd st (another popular spot for wine/cheese lovers in hell's kitchen).We arrived early Saturday evening (like 6pm ish) as we didn't want to wait in a line. We were seated on a bar table right away. It was actually more spacious that I had expected; they have tables, seating areas at the bar, and also nice and cozy lounge inside. **Drinks - Not to mention that they have great wine selection, their beer menu was also above my expectation. My friend got Edelweiss, and it was sooo good. Belgium, germany, japanese, and some other beers are also available. **Food - it's tapa style, so every dish is a small portion, even sliders or toast. (If you are hungry, then you might need to grab some food before coming to this place.), but still it's of great quality and very flavorful. We tried a bunch, and here are the list in order of our preference. - Salvatore ricotta crostini: serves small three pieces. Just perfect to go with wine. Ricotta cheese on top of the toasted baugette is so silky smooth. 5 starrrrrs!- Pulled pork sliders: two mid-sized sliders. I liked the pressed bread along with pulled pork which was tender. The bbq sauce was delicious. - Quail egg toast: three small pieces. It was delicious, but the portion was a bit disappointing. Fried quail egg was so small, and it was served  on top of bacon, not a slice of bread. I would not have this dish again next time. - Chicken liver mousse: It was okay and wasn't that impressive. Still believe Spotted Pig's chien liver mousse is the best in the city. - Cheese platter: $6 for each, and we ordered 3. A cube of cheese served on the platter here is so small given $6, and none of the 3 blew our mind. I  would recommend Casellula if you want to have good cheese selection with reasonable price.  Will definitely come back for weekend early or late night wine. Very intimate place, so this place should be good for dating too ;)",2,,

I have never been there before but she told me about it and said good things about it. I was optimistic and thought why not try it here and see what's so nice about it.We went there around 10pm and to my shock it was not as crowded as I thought. I think it was because we went on the night of the presidential debate. Off the beaten path and not on a main street, this place is a cozy wine bar. I was thinking that because it was not on a main street the prices would be more reasonable but in reality they were actually more. The wine list, while impressive, was way over priced. The food while small, was delicious. I had the quail eggs with bacon on toast, very delicious!!! The wine, while very delicious, was over priced. It was the Qupe Syrah from California, dark, rich and robust with slight earthy tones on the finish. Still delicious. Would I go back? Maybe, maybe not.... I could probably get same wine for cheaper and same quality food elsewhere.",,,

Really nice ambience and seating on couches led to a very intimate and romantic setting. The food was delicious. We shared the croquettes (unbelievable), the chorizo shrimp, quail egg, and 2 cheese dishes. Perfect size to share with a date and we ate every bite. It is very light and satisfies your hunger while not leaving you too full.My biggest knock against the restaurant is that they left cardboard boxes out for people to see. I was a little disappointed to see that and thought they should hold themselves to a much higher standards. But, everyone makes mistakes and perhaps because it was the weekend before Christmas things were a little hectic. If that were taken care of, then I think it would have been a perfect night.

I'd already made a reservation via 'Opentable' back in the UK before the holiday, which was good as Ardesia is very popular and filled up within an hour after our arrival at 7.45pm.The Manager and bar staff really looked after us and even found us two corner seats up at the bar when the 'Birthday party' next to us in the lounge increased from 8 in size to over 20.The wine is excellent, my wife and I started with an aperitif of 2011 'Bien Nacido Y Block' Qupe Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley) ($12 each), followed by an excellent 2008 Clos du Papillon, Savenieres ($65).The food whilst not of the Clos du Papillon standard, was still very good, we had a platter of 6 artisan cheeses ($32) - Compte, Flory Struckle, Elsa Mae, Chevre d'Argental, Marieke super Gouda and Chiraboga Blue served with Amy's Bread and seasonal garnishes. In addition to this we had garlic shrimp skewers ($8), spliced lamb skewers ($11) and a Charcuterie platter ($12) of saucisson and finocchiona.After around three hours of excellent wine, food, exceptional music (via spotify) and very personal and friendly service. It's not cheap, but it is worth it. Wines start at $36 per bottle for a French Muscadet or $51 for a bottle of US Santa Maria Valley Pinot Noir, which is less than we'd pay in a restaurant in London.Would we go again next time we're in NY - definitely",,,1

Updated review","Ardesia, I was wrong about you. So, so, wrong.I decided to give this place another go as a friend and I were leaving the Armory Show at Pier 92/94. Ardesia was the closest around to grab a bite and drink from.  We ordered the artichoke crab dip and the duck bahn mi. I happily devoured both, while washing it down with a Magner.I would also have to say that the service here is always great and inviting. I don't know his name, but every time I've been here I've been helped by the gentleman with the glasses. He's always been very helpful when anyone I was with needed recommendations or had questions about the menu. He also happily rewarded me with my free glass of Rose for my third Foursquare check-in, while usually I feel kind of cheap and lame for trying to scheme for free drinks with my e-coupon.Speaking of third time visits. My third time was for a friends birthday. A friend of mine wanted to have a surprise party for his girlfriend, and I recommended Ardesia. We were a party of about 20, and they were very accommodating. They allowed us all to open our own tabs to avoid confusion, and were very good remembering the owner of each tab (See! All Asians don't look alike!). I would also have to say that this place is great for a big group on a Saturday night. I think it's too far from the train that it just doesn't get packed. Ardesia you have become a regular stop for me. When I'm all the way by the Westside Highway that is.",2,2,3

198,Jaime B.,"ASTORIA, NY",66,72,3,3.0,2/13/2012,"A group of friends and I headed to Ardesia for my birthday dinner before a show. We loved that we were able to make a reservation just a few hours before heading to the restaurant.When we arrived, our table was ready, and our server got our drinks quickly. We ordered a variety of dishes. The spinach and crab dip was delicious and to me the most memorable dish. The pretzel and croquettes were pretty good, nice and hot. We ordered a cheese plate, which had a nice presentation on the board but would have been better if the server who delivered it would have taken the time to tell the group which cheese was what.Our server was great at first, but as the night went on, he was around less and less. Our water glasses went empty for a long time. He asked before the meal started if we were trying to make a show, and we told him we were but that we had a little time. But at the end of the night, we were rushing to make it because it was took so long to get our check. The restaurant had gotten busier, and it looked like he was running a lot of food, but it would have been nice if he had been just a little more attentive or asked another server to check on us. It made the difference in our experience. I would have given Ardesia four stars if not for that because the night began so well.Ardesia has a great atmosphere; it's a lovely spot to gather with friends for a drink and snacks. It's tucked away on a quiet street. I might come back here, but perhaps at a time when they won't be crowded.",,,

All the servers were amazing; helpful, nice and provided great service.Now to the goodies. The wine selection is quite nice. We ordered a few bottles of white wine because it was 200 F outside. As for the food, the burrata was out of this world. We tried the croquetas and the olives, both good to open your appetite. The salads were fresh and tasty, the cheese platter has a nice selection and the bread was super fresh.We didn't have any dessert because there was no room left.I don't think this place was too expensive at all. It's a perfect spot to go ""have a glass of wine"" and munch on something. If I were a guy, I would take a date here.But since I'm a girl, I think I'll bring my guy here one of these days.",1,,1
