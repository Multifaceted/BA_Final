0,Natalie K.,"New York, NY",103,39,1,4.0,10/21/2018,"This is truly my favorite Aussie brunch spot in all of Manhattan. I've gone time after time and it never gets old! The ambience of this little cafe is so great - located in a section of an old church. It's so quaint and homey. The avocado smash is amazing - so much flavor and I always add a poached egg. Definitely a good portion so it's worth the higher prices for avocado toast.I also have swung by this location and others for the delicious wellness lattes! The tumeric latte is my favorite, but the matcha is also really good too. The beetroot isn't bad, but a little sweet for my taste.Only knocked off a star because during non-outdoor seating seasons, the wait can be really, really long for parties larger than 2. There's really only 2 actual tables for groups that big.Love this spot and will be back soon!",,,
1,Debby T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,117,176,3.0,10/15/2018,"S.L.O.W.  I would give this location 2 stars, but because I think it's pretty and the food was decent when I ate there once, I will give it 3 stars. But way toooooo SLOW.First of all, I would like to say this location is great, convenient (from my office), great during the warm weather. They have moved the to go coffee ordering to outside during the warm weather. I came here when they first opened so the wait inside for a latte wasn't bad. However, twice in the past week, I waited 9 MINUTES for my latte (to go). A latte should not take this long. I realize I'm an impatient NY'er, but this is a ridiculous long wait. I'm curious if there is only one espresso machine?  One barista? There has to be a more efficient and quicker way. Also, $5 for a ""small"" cup is not acceptable. Anywhere in the neighborhood gives you a large cup for $5.",,,
2,Rhen S.,"New York, NY",75,18,0,3.0,10/6/2018,"I've been here several times and the food is always great. I never mind the wait and the servers are always on point and helpful. Today I asked one of the team closest to me at the time to replace my mimosa because the glass was dirty. She responded immediately and was extremely helpful. While she was waiting at the coffee station for my new beverage, the ""manager,"" Alex, berated her for walking away from the silverware to assist me and told her to go back to what she was doing.  Within 10 minutes time I observed this manager, Alex, speak to the team in a condescending and demanding manner that was hostile and disrespectful while doing absolutely nothing to make their jobs easier. Barking orders like a drill sergeant. Awful. The team, in fact, was doing an exceptional job at making things work in an extremely busy and fast paced environment. So, thank you to the team for making my brunch an exceptional experience. A few simple words of advice for Alex:A leader is someone who encourages others to take ownership of every role and praises them for taking initiative to make everybody's role easier. A leader is on the front lines, not barking orders behind a ""title.""  A leader is a ""by example"" role. A leader is reliable, consistent, and supportive. Sadly, I saw none of that.",2,,

Updated review","Their cappuccino is the best I've had in the city so far. It's not the traditional/classic/authentic/thick-foam cappuccino that you'd expect in Italy, but it has a chocolate(?) topping that makes it very tasty(but not sweet ; don't worry)Interesting interior deco(this café is technically part of the church next door; even their restroom is in the church) and friendly staff. Outdoor seating can be limited on weekends but if you can find a table outside, the ambiance is great(right next to  church and Central Park)",,,1
4,Elizabeth Y.,"Bronx, NY",138,484,256,3.0,7/16/2018,"Quick turnaround. Less than a 10 minute wait to get a table for two for a busy Sunday brunch. Food usually comes out very quickly. Even on a rainy day, they have awnings to cover the patrons. To be honest, $23 for an avocado toast with poached egg and salmon is a bit too expensive and did not live up to the name. The toast was very difficult to cut through and there wasn't much oil on the toast giving it a very dry texture. My poached egg was mostly cooked with a only a small amount of yolk that was runny and the rest of the yolk was cooked through. I can make better poached eggs and avocado toast for much cheaper price.",2,,
5,Belle D.,"Dumont, NJ",583,115,176,3.0,6/22/2018,"My girlfriend and I were at the Guggenheim, so we stopped by here on our way out. We both were huge fans of the use of the church architecture and how they made it feel so modern inside. I especially loved the white marble and blue-green accents. We chose to sit inside because it was a little hot out, and we got to pick anywhere to sit. There were booths that were built into little alcoves in the wall, which I thought was an amazing use of the space. We asked what the seasonal cider was for today and our waiter said he didn't know, seemed to guess at a brand, and then said it was pear. When we got handed our bottles, it was actually Doc's original apple cider.. this was a huge disappointment for me because I actually went to that orchard last weekend and had I known it was Doc's, I wouldn't spend $7 for a bottle.I also decided to order the avocado toast $13 with chorizo. The prices were a little ridiculous, especially for the add on or chorizo for $5. When the toast came out, there was a lot of avocado which I appreciated, but the chorizo was just one half of a full sausage. Needless to say, I was underwhelmed. Overall, the dish was tasty.Deducted a star for the server not knowing their menu well and another star because nothing about this place makes me feel drawn to come back, especially in Manhattan where there are soooo many places to go eat. Love this place for a cute vibe though.",1,1,1
6,Robin Y.,"North Bethesda, MD",532,121,207,4.0,9/25/2018,"Everything about bluestone lane was so loveable and endearing. It's a cute brunch cafe located nearby central park. I ordered smash avocado toast with poached egg (recommend), and a cup of coffee. Food/coffee was excellent!service is a bit rough but understandably so because you're in prime location next to central park--i mean, what do you expect? a five-star restaurant service?!?",,,
7,Brian H.,"Olney, MD",232,67,129,5.0,6/29/2018,"Love the Bluestone Lane Cafe at this location.  Very creative in it's presentation as it's home is part of an old church, with seating outside.  Location is good as it's close to the Guggenheim, across the street from Central Park, the Met and the M86 crosstown bus.  The cafe is quaint and busying with customers and employees, but all the same it's quiet enough to talk and hear those you are at the table with.  We enjoyed a table for 4 and found the service to be friendly just like the Time Square location.  This was our first time at a Bluestone Lane Cafe, but love the great options for a meal.  It appeared from observation that their most popular entree would be the Classic Avocado Smash, which my wife loved and enjoyed and was very filling even thought it's not a huge portion (thank you for not tempting us to eat more than our bodies can handle).  I chose the Ricotta & Berry Fruit Toast, mostly because it comes with honey and I love honey.  Both entrees were great and well worth coming for again.  But all the other options sound splendid as well and worth at least a try.  Brekkie Board, Husk Bakeshop Banana Board and a Bacon & Egg Roll, yes please to all three.  I must say their coffee is fantastic as well, their flat white is great and well worth a visit just for a nice afternoon coffee.  Full of taste and simply delicious.  If you are near the Upper East or West Side or Central park or the museums mentioned above give Bluestone Lane a visit, it's just so unique and worth a stop, even if you get a drink to go.  If you are visiting NYC like we were, stop on by make it part of your plans, this was our last stop before leaving the city, it was a perfect way to end our time.  It's more of a locals spot too, which is we love, get away from the touristy part of the city and get to know the people that make the city so great.",,,1
8,Amy Y.,"New York, NY",36,173,149,4.0,7/1/2018,"Gluten Free Banana Bread topped with whipped ricotta, toasted pecans, fresh banana & berries - so good! I don't usually like banana bread, it must have been the gluten.Matcha latte - first time trying this, it's okay.",,,
9,Nick M.,"Dallas, TX",290,149,464,4.0,7/1/2018,"Woah! What is this place? I had a couple hours one summery Sunday afternoon and on my way to the Met decided to get some coffee...Since I honeymooned in New Zealand, I'm a sucker for an authentic flat white, even when it's 100 degrees outside. I came to the right place! As a self-respecting red-blooded American who wishes he lived in New Zealand, I got myself a Flat White. Pretty darn good but I personally prefer the Flat White at Boundless Plains Espresso down in FiDi. If they're asking you whether you want your Flat White small or large... they're doing it wrong.The food, however, was really great and perfect for a summer day of walking around the city. I got the avocado smash with a poached egg, and added bacon + mushroom per the server's recommendation. I don't THINK she was staring into my soul and correctly surmising that this is almost identical to what my wife and I ate every day for breakfast on our honeymoon, but in The Big Apple, you never know. My poached egg was over, but I still devoured it. Fair warning too that her ""suggestions"" cost $8 extra, so if I'd been here a for personal trip and not for business that would have really stung.Regardless of the execution, the atmosphere is just unparalleled -- an Aussie cafe in an old church right next to Central Park, The Met, and the Guggenheim? Whaaaa?Be prepared to be seated at other people's existing tables if you're going solo and it's crowded... it's awkward for the first 5 minutes but if you can pretend you're one of the girls out on the town for Sunday brunch, you just might survive.4 stars b/c my Flat White was not on par with Boundless Plains or honeymoon in New Zealand and I know it's possible to get one right in NYC -- but I'll be BACK, y'all!",,,
10,Monica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",80,127,412,4.0,5/24/2018,This adorable cafe conveniently located just a few blocks from the Met museum is the perfect spot to sip some coffee and snack on banana bread. They have a large outdoor seating area where you can people watch to your hearts content. This place feels very European and on a warm sunny day it's THE perfect spot. It's also built into a church which is really cool.,4,1,3
11,Susanna N.,"Queens, NY",6,28,49,3.0,9/18/2018,"Having studied abroad in Australia, I was looking for nostalgia so I decided to finally try Bluestone. The environment is very nice and menu really reminded me of Melbourne. Classic Avocado Smash: can't go wrong with avo toast. Everything was fresh from the crunchy baked bread to the avocado. I do wish they had more choices of avocado toasts though, as this one is very very classic and can be made at home. Warm Coconut Quinoa & Oat Porridge : Porridge is very popular in Australia and not very common at restaurants here. I found that this one was too sweet for my liking. It was good but after a few bites I couldn't eat it anymore. Cold brew : amazing and very strong! The reason I rate it 3 stars is that for me the price wasn't worth my meal. As I said, I wish they had more variety reflecting the amazing and complex dishes in Aussie. Maybe next time I will go for something different.",,,
12,Shachi B.,"New York, NY",61,555,743,3.0,6/9/2018,"The food here is good, albeit extremely expensive. My gluten-free friend and I came here for brunch. We were seated pretty quickly, which was great. One note - this is not a place to linger after your meal. The space is so small that you really should help the staff along and turn over your table as soon as possible. My friend ordered the gluten free banana bread and she loved it. (See pic.) I opted for the egg sandwich without meat but with avocado. I was disappointed that I still had to pay full price for the sandwich PLUS extra for the avocado. I hope they consider allowing a no-cost swap for meat-free diners. While the flavors themselves were good, the room temperature egg was not my favorite. Plus, it was $16 which does not seem worth it.We also split an avocado smash toast on gluten free bread, which was tasty. Again, my preference wouldn't have been for the egg to be room temperature, but oh well.",,,
13,Brian T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",224,42,32,4.0,10/14/2018,"A great place for coffee near the museums. Potent cappuccino and flat white but the kiosk out front and barista bar inside cause confusion for ordering. Venturing into the inside of the shop, we were prompted to order our coffees at the outdoor kiosk. After ordering, the limited outdoor space makes for traffic jams and unintentional blockades in and out of the cafe. If the system was implemented to direct expediency and efficiency, it can be improved upon. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our coffees!",1,,
14,James V.,"Miami, FL",895,15,19,5.0,10/27/2018,Next door to the Guggenheim is this gem of a place.  The decor reminds you of a cathedral but the staff is neither judgemental nor unattentive.  We had the Classic Avacado Smash and added a poached egg and salmon.  Variations of this dish are ubiquitous these days but Bluestone's version is exceptional.  We'll executed drip coffee and interesting tea selection.  This place is well worth a visit on its own to the upper East side.,,,

Since i'm here in the summer you can order your food outside if you don't want to sit down. the staff is so sweet except for one of the hostesses who blocked me from walking in and was rude and way to close to my face! relax it's ok. i ordered a double espresso and the avocado smash with prosciutto on top. total $21, super steep but the location speaks. they have their own detox drinks which look good but not enough for me to spend the $ on them!

20,Melissa B.,"Manhattan, NY",181,94,51,4.0,9/29/2018,I was excited to try the Bluestone Lane on the Upper Eastside. I'm a fan of their Greenwich Village location.Their food was delish.However the service left something to be desired. Servers were super sweet but very slow. After getting our food we did not see our server for a bit. We saw him about 45 minutes later walking out of the restaurant. He never told us he was leaving. Trying to get our check was a bit challenging but once a new server came to our table she was very apologetic (even though she screwed up the bill.) In their defense it was a Sunday in the middle of prime brunch time.So if you have time to spare and are planning to have a leisurely Sunday brunch this location will work for you!,,,

26,Kim B.,"New York, NY",339,747,140,4.0,5/14/2018,"I'm really torn for how to rate this. Ambiance/atmosphere- 5/5Food/ beverages- 5/5Service 1/5. What makes me hesitant, was that it seemed like the issues we had with service are an underlying issue, and not related to our specific server or experience. The atmosphere is charming, European, medieval... the entire time we were eating I kept mentioning that I felt we were in ""classic NYC"" or ""classic europe"". The majority of the restaurant is outdoors, with only a few cozy seats inside. It's across from the reservoir in CP, which makes it prime people watching location. The inside is beautiful, and was a place I would love to cozy up with a book, hot chocolate, or meal. The only downfall is that the bathroom is in the church next door, and is quite the process to use. The coffee mugs, decor is cute, quaint, lots of turquoise, and really has a lot of personal flare. I want this to be a nook in my house. The food and beverages were excellent. The avocado smash is what to get here, and it's delicious, savory, fresh, loaded, and the bread is Balthazar, which is incredible. The iced hot chocolate was unique, refreshing, and flavorful. The service however, really set us off and am not sure if we would go back. While we were able to be seated right away, everything was chaotic and disorganized. They brought us the wrong food/drinks multiple times, it took over 20 minutes to get our coffees, over 20 minutes to get our bill, we never got the water cups we asked for. This didn't seem to be specific to our server, as everyone around us had the same problem. What should have been a 30 minute breakfast was well over an hour. I am not sure if I have ever experienced such chaotic service as here.",7,1,2

The staff here is INCREDIBLE. They handled the situation like pros, (given how awkward it truly is).  They wrapped my food and my awesome waitress (Shantee?

31,Kent M.,"Edmonton, Canada",45,142,20,5.0,8/20/2018,"Bluestone Lane is such a special place! Located along Museum Mile, it's the perfect spot to fuel up for a nice brunch, latte or juice. There was a 15-minute wait at around 11AM on a Monday, and to be fair, the space is not very large (especially on a rainy day which takes their ample patio out of commission). The café is nestled inside of the beautiful and historic Church of Heavenly Rest, and offers really beautiful detail (sandstone archways, etc. Apparently its interior was featured in Architectural Digest, which I believe - it's a vibe, to be sure. The staff was super friendly, especially the host, who was a hoot! She made people laugh while they waited, which kept pre-breaky hunger pangs at bay. The servers were super conversational as well.I had the matcha latte (with almond milk, if I recall), and it was delicious - very earthy and comforting. My dining partner's hot chocolate was even better. On the food side, I was really happy, too. I ordered the Bacon and Egg Roll (with house-made chutney), and it was so hearty and tasty. My friend did the Classic Avocado Smash, which was also good (but although I felt she made a better drink selection, my Bacon and Egg Roll stole the show!).

At some point I thought the reason they were taking so long was because they were probably waiting for their veggies to grow. But I guess I was wrong. They are just seriously this slow.

Quite honestly everything about this place is cute from the pillows and cushions that they have for their communal seating to the wooden boards they serve everything. The menu has your typical brunch offerings, which is good because it's a place that will please everyone and allows you to see how Bluestone's version of your favorite dishes. The only downside to the location is that the only restroom (note that restroom in singular) is in the foyer area of the church next door, so there can be quite a line - plan ahead! I started out with the wellness flight because I was too indecisive to choose between the beetroot or the golden tumeric latte. I really loved the subtle sweetness of the beetroot latte, the sweet kick of the tumeric latte, and the high quality taste of the matcha latte (the third flavor in the flight). Our waitress spilled a little of the drinks when she set the platter down and shifted one of the beautiful latte leaves that was on top, but she quickly came by to clean up the glass. This really wasn't a big deal at all because hardly any liquid spilled out, but this is the kind of attention to detail that this restaurant has - to go as far as to clean up such a small amount of liquid that really only slightly affected the presentation. Pretty bummed I didn't order as to-go coffee because they come in very pretty blue, nautical themed cups, but I will next time for sure!For my meal, I ordered the rainbow bowl and 10/10 would order it again. There are so many colorful and healthy components to it that I could make each bite unique with all the combinations of ingredients. Don't be fooled by how filling this is just because it's a salad. You'll start feeling really full about half way through, but won't be able to stop yourself from finishing the rest.

In any decent place it would be a question of a few minutes, not there. And do not ask for bread, which they won't bring you by default, which you'll get 20 minutes later, for a price, by which time you've finished your salad. But which you'll eat anyway since you're starving given the size of the portions. On the positive side, eating quickly allows you to escape the loud boring music as quickly as possible.Just so you know, sometimes your order just never arrives...

We both ordered avocado toast - the bread they use is really delicious! I got a brekkie board, which is half avocado toast and half yogurt with fruit and granola.

Sitting across from central park in a very cool setting (part of a church so the architecture is great) you can have a very solid cappuccino (one of the better ones I've had). I didn't even add sugar as the thicker than normal frothed milk layer (I don't use IG but it's exactly the type of picturesque cup you'd consider instagrammable) gave enough sweetness to it. Waitress was lovely and even brought out a water bowl unasked for my pup which was very thoughtful of her. Tried the salmon brioche which was decent albeit not exactly noteworthy. They seem to have a lot of locations but had a none chain feel to it, at least at this location. Definitely a mix of locals and tourists at this small but very quaint spot.

Uhm okay... so I'm looking at the picture I took of my food and realized the ingredients don't exactly match up to the description online (mine had carrots, avocado, and corn), so maybe there were seasonal changes on the actual paper menu. Anyway, going off of what I had, the veggies were fresh, & the yogurt dressing added a tangy kick. However, the other ingredients were... okay. My avocado was unnaturally acidic (too much lemon?), & I feel as if the spinach base wasn't the best contribution, texture-wise... maybe shredded kale might be better? I ordered a matcha latte, and similar to the other location, it was alright. I understand that matcha isn't what Bluestone specializes in, but I think looking into the matcha-to-milk ratio would definitely help. Would I bring other people here? Most definitely, because of the location (& Instragrammable food; I have to say it). However, in terms of the taste of the food specifically, it's getting there, but there's room for improvement.",1,1,

There were many more options in the menu that I was curious about. Many gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan choices. The place was very crowded so I didn't have time to try other dishes or coffee, which was unfortunate. However I will definitely try visiting again. This place was very impressive.",,,

Bluestone Lane popped up and I gave their menu a quick scan and decided to give it a try.     It was so hot out and I ordered takeout at the place because I was in a rush. To order takeout you have to order from their cart right outside the store and let me tell you, my order came faster than a McDonald's order. Even though the place was packed inside and out, my order arrived in less than 7 minutes. It was fast and efficient.     The staff there are so nice and they take the time to answer any questions you may have about any of their items on the menu. I definitely enjoyed my experience here, even though I didn't dine in. I will most definitely be coming back to try some of their other items on the menu.If you happen to be in the neighborhood one day and are craving brunch/a quick bite to eat, I would certainly suggest checking this place out.",,,

My friends had the muesli and the avo smash and both liked them. I also had the hot chocolate and it was warm and rich. The food set us back quite a few dollars, but the portions were decent and the quality of the food was good. My only issue with this place is how crowded it gets in the winter- everyone waits inside (fairly so, it's like 15 degrees outside) but the crowds start to seep into the restaurant itself so people who are waiting literally have to surround the tables. Not sure what they can do to fix this problem, but just know that you can probably expect a few people waiting for a table hover right behind you as you eat.",3,,

The bluestone lane rainbow bowl was bland and had a small ration of quinoa. The presentation of the brekkie board is great but the avocado toast was also lacking in flavor. Nothing exciting about the collective granola and yogurt. My dad did seem to enjoy his moroccan chicken sandwich.

I was attracted to the this cafe because of it's beautiful arch door and the outdoor seating is prime for warmer days in the city.  The arches continues inside and the  stunning interior also allows you to enjoy your coffee in the winter months.  I came here during the fall, where the weather was unseasonably warm.  My friend and I were seated within 5 minutes despite the huge crowds. I don't know how we lucked out, but thank you to the staff because our seats were prime for some people watching too.  Just as we were enjoying our views, a lady just took a fall right in front of us.  We quickly got up to help and the staff were on top of it by offering to call the ambulance, a seat and a glass of water.  I was just impressed with the attentiveness and the care for a fellow human. I had the latte and my friend had the mocha latte, DELISH. The coffee was brewed with perfection and the right amount of hot milk.  It is on the pricier side, but only a quarter more compared to most lattes in the city.  It's totally worth the price to enjoy a sip of coffee from this gorgeous cafe and Central Park as your backdrop.",2,,1

As the sun came back out I plopped down into a sidewalk table. It's really a nice spot to grab an iced coffee and bite to eat.Located near the 90th street entrance they offer cool seating inside under a cathedral like setting, or on some small tables outside by the sidewalk. Clean bathroom that is usable connected to the main church which is next door. Small but good selection of pastries, sandwiches, snacks, hot drinks, etc. Some wines and beer too. Occasional specials on the board for food and drink. Very friendly and helpful counter staff. This place is a little gem!Terrific iced coffee. Outside seating always a plus.

If you break up the price of the full size portions my plate shouldn't have been more than $11 but there's a $5 premium for getting the combo and it was a bit small.

Our food came out a little slow and we never got water for our table, but that was fine (we were too cold to complain!) I ordered the avocado smash as well as the granola (I immediately realized afterwards that I should've ordered the brekkie bowl, which had both in one serving as I couldn't finish two entrees, technically). My dining partner ordered the breakfast roll, which looked delicious especially with avocado.

When it's warm out, the outdoor seating is prime, and there's practically no wait to sit. When it's cold out, it's just indoor seating: a few booth spaces but most of the Seaton available is at the community table in the center of the cafe, so it can get crowded, especially for Sunday brunch time 1 pm-ish. When it's crowded, I recommend taking the food to go and hanging out at Central Park to eat (if you don't mind the cold). Don't be intimidated by the line, it moves pretty fast. Their matcha latte is my fave matcha latte in the city (second to Matcha Cha Cha in flatiron) because it's not too sweet and just the right amount of splash of milk to bring out the matcha flavor. I LOVE their avocado toast. If you're craving avo toast, go here. I get mine with prosciutto. I also recommend coming here before or after dropping by the Guggenheim or the Met.

Unfortunately the avocado from the salad had a strong fuzzy taste, caused by lemon inside the avocado being left too long, causing fermentation (which causes the taste). I wouldn't usually mind this mishap, especially if it could be easily fixed by replacing the avo. It happens. However the server denied it and failed to take the steps to resolve the situation.

I was also pleased that although I was sitting outside, I was not forgotten by the staff - who were very friendly and accommodating.

It's located in a church but doesn't have any religious/holy feeling to it (if that makes any sense) I ordered the brekkie board ($16) which consists of an avocado smash and a granola yogurt parfait - it's the best of both worlds.

I also ordered an Aussie Iced Latte (which I unknowingly said in an Australian accent) - it normally has two scoops of ice cream in it but I asked for one.

After he took our order we didn't see him again. Seriously. Then a cute girl (possibly from New Zealand or the like) came to check on us, asked if we needed anything else and eventually brought us the bill. Our cards sat on the table or almost 10 minutes and I tried to flag her down twice while after she attended to the small table directly beside us. Was ignored. It's possible she wasn't aware that we no longer had a specific server it seemed.

The avocado smash toast is very refreshing and the yogurt granola is not too sweet and blends really well with the crunchy granola. The brisket has very deep flavor but might be too heavy if you don't like heavy stuff.THE cutest thing to mention here is the hot drink - we got hot chocolate and mocha latte and we were delighted to find out that the barista is able to ""paint"" animals on top. Though the bear on macha latte was a bit distorted due to the soft texture of almond milk, the elephant on hot chocolate and the abstraction of animals gave us a lot of fun.Since the place is IN a church, you can see the flying tetra-sectional vault which is part of the church architecture; yet the cafe and restaurant set up naturally blends in with the environment and creates a deeply soothing and delightful ambience to appreciate the food and drink and time with friends.

On my particular visit today it took over 15 minutes just to get water and service was beyond slow, the water bottle cap and wood boards the food came were moldy and musty but the real winner was the state of the bathroom.

I got the Brekkie board which comes with half an avocado smash and half of their yogurt with granola. I will never understand why avocado toasts are so popular and expensive in places like these. Honestly, all avocado toasts taste the same for me and this is coming from a person who has eaten many of that in various different locations in and out of manhattan. None ever stand out and the one at this location is the same. While it was good (hard to mess it up), it's nothing unique. The yogurt with granola was decent. I liked their granola mix more than the yogurt and toppings itself. Service: very disappointing service. There's a sign that says ""wait to be seated"" but as my friend and I were standing outside doing just that, no one came for 10 minutes although you could clearly see the host standing there with his back turned to us. The other waitresses disregarded us as well. After trying to get someone's attention for a bit, we decided to just walk in and hope to get noticed by a staff member. This took another 5 minutes and my friend and I were so confused as to whether or not we seat ourselves or if we actually had to wait to be seated. When we finally were able to sit down, the waitress who served us was a bit ditzy and rushed although I can't blame her because it was busy around the time we went. Suffice to say, I was not impressed. I expected better for some reason but left feeling disappointed.",,,2

They kept messing up the order and coming back to me every 10 minutes with a different drink from the Iced Almond Milk Latte I had requested and paid for. While I do understand that mistakes happen, bringing me the wrong drink, multiple times, every 10 minutes in unacceptable. After I had been waiting for over 30 minutes for my drink, I complained to the manager who not only was lacking managerial skills in making sure customers were attended to, but became so defensive that he started accusing me of crossing the line when all I did was ask to get the item I had paid for. He walked away from me and came back 5 minutes later, with my drink, which was again the wrong one. Had to go back, bring the right latte I had requested. Total disappointment.",,,

Event that was terrifically bad. I put my name down for a table for 4 including a stroller. My husband and I go to this establishment every second weekend if we are in town. Also bring friends and visitors. I was always seated within max 20mins wait, waiting is never an issue if you can see that the line is managed properly. After 20 mins the lady handling the seating came to me and asked me to ensure that all 4 people were there in the next 5 mins. My husband and a friend were walking with our daughter to entertain her during the wait, so I called them. I told the lady we were there, she acknowledge it and proceeded to seat other 4 people in the table that was for us. She then to told me that we would have had to wait longer. No way we could do that with a baby, so they offered us a table inside. We were crammed in and one of the waiter served a piping hot coffee over the stroller. The food was really average, and the flat white was no were near the coffee I go there for. If this was the first time I tried this place, I would not go back again. The other annoying this is that they kept coming by asking, 'did it work out well in the end anyway'? Well no, we asked for a table outside, and they gave t away, the food was not as good and the coffee was terrible. We voiced our discontent, there was no point to keep asking us the same question. I think I will stay away for a while.",,,

My favorite thing to do is sit in their outdoor seating and enjoy the fresh air.They have a variety of coffee and drinks, which are very good.

If you like a robust, no-nonsense cup of jo, Bluestone is hard to beat. The flat white is also a classic here, and the largely Australian staff will charm you with their friendly service and winsome accents. Further, the food selection here, while impressive, is generally overpriced and not worth the wait. However, this location is absolutely stunning!

The corner shared table was near the entrance which made us colder whenever the door opened which was quite often. The café was packed with people tucking into hearty breakfasts.We both opted for the perennially favorite avocado toast with prosciutto on mine. Chamomile ginger tea for Eden and a hot cappuccino for me. Thick slices of grain bread topped with a mound of mashed avocado and slices of prosciutto came and we ate deliciously hardly uttering any words.

The wine was reasonable: Sauvignon Blanc was 8 and Pinot Noir was 10. Durable drink ware was used, which was pleasant compared to other outdoor cafes which serve wine in disposable cups. This is a delightful addition to the destination area around the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum and the Guggenheim Museum (you might also want to be aware of Eli's Essentials/Bar 91 at the southeast corner of 91st and Madison, Gina la Fornarina on 91st between 5th and Madison, and the Cooper Hewitt cafe).TIP: Can get busyBONUS: Excellent outdoor seating",1,,
98,Ashley S.,"Manhattan, NY",286,457,898,3.0,3/17/2017,"This is an ok place for coffee and pastries, but I find them a little pricey. I came for a cappuccino this morning. Granted I got the bigger of the two sizes, but it cost me $5. It was pretty tasty but nothing astounding. Also, even though this place is a chain, they don't honor the Bluestone Lane rewards app that gives you $$ back when you spend a certain amount on food and drinks. I will say that the ambiance is nice. The outside seating is wonderful in the summertime as it overlooks the nice reservoir area of central park. The indoors portion of the restaurant is attached to the Church of Heavenly rest. It must be a part of the former church that they sold off, because it looks like a church, and the architectural detail is amazing. Maybe a sit down brunch will wow me, but if you're just stopping here for cafe fare, I'd say it's about average.",3,,1

Place was packed with young crowds and tourists on a weekday late afternoon. We didn't want to wait for any outside table and sat inside the restaurant but had to share a table with 2 other strangers. My cappuccino was good and my daughter ordered a popular Asian cold chocolate drink ""Milo"" on the menu.  The desserts were not on the menu and we had to walk out to a cart outside to pick what we wanted and the server would brought it to the table. Not too many desserts were available when we were there. Place was a little crowded but that's the norm in the Manhattan. Service was fast and friendly and never felt as if we were rushed to leave.

The bread was well toasted but the star is the amount of well made avocado on top. Banana Toasts - The banana flavor came out amazingly and it was hi-lighted by the fresh fruit, pecan, honey and cheese.We also got a bunch of different drinks: the ice chocolate, matcha latte, ice late and they were all very well made.If I'm ever in the vicinity, I would not mind stopping by to grab a quick delicious bite!",,,3

Updated review","A bit late on the update but after giving this location a second try a little bit later on with more attentive staff/management, I'm pleased to say the experience was worth the trip to the UES. We ordered the avo smash - only complaint here is that I wish the bread on this was a little softer but that's also personal pref. Others at the table got the brekkie bowl and the Bircher Muesli which was delicious. Lattes here are always a good idea!",,,

Very nice, open cafe and nice atmosphere during the day with a lot of fresh air and greens.SERVICE:Simply not good enough. Trying to pay attention to customers but fails. Before ordering we got served an Orange juice and a dish that we didn't order. Ended up being the order from the person sitting next to us and even that order was wrong.Asked for water 3 times so I decided to refill the water at the front door myself. Got the water from the waitress when we paid and ready to leave. Seriously? My mom can juggle 5 plates at once and manages 6 tables at the same time. If you can't do it just find another job or practice.FOOD/PRICE:My Avocado Smash $12 (toast with avocado, tomato etc on it) was delicious. My friend ordered Viet Banh Mi $14. Toast for $12? Wow you gotta be kidding me. And her Banh Mi, you can get double the size at a vietnamese authentic place for $3 and that's standard.Food is great but if you walk out still hungry and broke... not sure about this. I can't believe people are willing to pay so much for a piece of nothing.BLUESTONE LANE APP $5 discount:NOPE don't use it. I downloaded it wanting to save $5.

The bacon and egg sandwich is on ciabatta bread and added aioli for flavor but small portion so you won't be full at all if this is the only thing you're ordering, especially if you go in hungry.  I went home and made my own sandwich. Cons: small portion size, overpriced (avocado smash- slice of bread with avocado spread topped with cherry tomatoes  is ~$16 with poached egg...

While I was here, items my party ordered included the avocado toast and the yogurt bowl. The presentation of their food is super aesthetic and is also pretty good, but all are items I wouldn't necessarily rave about.Naturally, there was quite a bit of a wait during our Saturday morning visit, but it wasn't too bad given the restaurants proximity to Central Park. One other thing to note is that the wait staff was a little bit on the slower end during our visit, making it pretty difficult to flag down a waiter for simple things like a water refill or getting the check.

I ordered the Brekkie Board, which is an absolutely yummy duo with Smashed Avocado toast and their Collective Granola (house made granola with Greek yogurt and a Citrus Curd). The whole dish (board?) was delicious, but the granola was just divine. I think I'd probably just end up getting a full size granola the next time I go so I won't cry so hard when I finish eating it. There are quite a few BL locations, but this one is beautiful and tucked away in between a church and the Guggenheim.

I was impressed by the way they used the church to mold a cozy coffee spot right next to Central Park. I ordered the bacon and egg sandwich with no avocado (Yeah yeah I like to try something not too food trendy once and a while) and the egg was cooked a perfect over easy. Brioche bun was soft but held the sandwich together, and the bacon was nice and crisp. They only take credit cards which was ok by me. The wait staff was friendly and very accommodating to a relatively large crowd. It seemed to fill up quick on an early Saturday so get in before the rush of post-central park runners!",,,

However, I found the service to be inattentive (they never refilled our water) and the food, though beautiful in presentation, was nothing special. I had the Breakfast Bowl and found the flavors bland and the tomatoes mushy. My friend had the Avocado Smash (equivalent to Avocado Toast) and though she liked the feta/avocado combo, they refused to scramble her egg as oppose to poach it and the bread was hard to cut and eat. For the price (my one breakfast entree with no drinks or add ons cost me $14) the food was not worth it at all.",,1,

I was allured into the ""Brekkie board"" as it promised half portions of the avocado toast and the granola, but in reality, the small portions just left me unsatisfied. Taste wise, the avocado toast was nice, however the granola had a large amount of lemon curd. Also my green juice was good, but tasted a bit too much like apple juice to truly feel like I was getting any of the other ingredients out of the price I paid.

It is also right across the street from Central Park, which makes it an excellent location for post bike ride or run refreshment, and also great for people watching since Engineers Gate is a popular gathering point in Central Park. The coffee is also excellent - the ""Long Black"" (what we typically call an Americano) is delicious - rich and smooth, no bitterness. But the service here is ATROCIOUS. Not like I stopped here once and got unlucky with bad service either - I get coffee here on a regular basis, typically during the week when the crushing crowds that mob the place on the weekends aren't present. The service is nearly always lousy. For one it is very slow - it will sometimes take them 5 minutes to serve you a drip coffee, if they remember it at all. They also will try to force you to use the outdoor kiosk when sometimes all you want to do is enjoy your coffee inside and admire the space and the architecture (or maybe try to get warm on a chilly morning). Today we were told to order inside since the person who was supposed to man the kiosk was running late. 2 minutes later we were told we were not allowed to order inside now that the employee had arrived.This place has 5 star potential - I hope they can figure out a better way to serve their patrons.

If I had to say the two top things about this location they would be: gorgeous interior and amazing customer service.

There's table service and I saw some tasty treats being eaten, including avocado toast.I went up to the counter and perused the coffee menu, opting for an Aussie latte- an iced latte with ice cream! Sold. Since I was staring at the pastry counter I also purchased a cinnamon sugar donut, which happened to be gluten free, and very tasty.

The place is so crowded and tiny, there are so many people waiting and they stand just next to your chair scattered between tables (obviously to not wait the 30 minutes in the cold) and make the experience in the place stressful. I was looking forward to have a nice Sunday brunch with my friends but I felt like sitting more than 20 minutes was holding back others that are standing above my plate waiting for me to finish.

However, one critique, if you're serving high quality iced coffee/cold brew it is essentially criminal to not offer simple syrup. I'd expect somewhere like Dunkin Donuts to only offer crystal sugar packs to have to inadequately try and stir in a little sweetness... except I'm pretty sure Dunkin Donuts offers simple syrup now. Maybe you all were out of simple syrup the day we came by. If so, let me know.

He started off on the right foot with his greeting and bringing us water.

It's very possible that this particular location gets more foot traffic than the space can accommodate since it is right next to Central Park, but the service just needs so much help. In the time that we (me and one other person) sat down, they could have flipped the table 3 times-- and there is a wait for tables here. You can tell that the service is flustered and disorganized.

Our AS toast was not seasoned with anything, very bland. Feta cheese crumbles should be salty and tangy but didn't help these toasts.I checked the menu again to see what was missing when I back home. Them I found out that it should have had a tangy-creamy Tahini sauce (lemon juice, salt and garlic. Those flavors and salt would definitely be enhancing the toast. Our toasts (another toast with bacon was the same somehow, even with salty bacon) were not like the likes but bland, but they were beautiful. The perfectly poached egg didn't saved this toast obviously. Not knowing missing key ingredients, I asked our nice waiter to get some fresh lemon slices, olive oil, and salt & pepper. The salt and pepper were on the counter. Definitely lemon brighten the flavor but table salt and pepper did not helped much. This salt, for this toast, needed to be corse salt and black pepper needed to be fresh and not stale. The table salt made everything just too salty, not good. Olive oil over it disguises a little but not worth $32 with a cappuccino (after tax and tip) for lunch - our bill was $64.This amazing space is small but with neo-Gothic style beauty. I think it is a part of the historic Episcopal Church of the Heavenly Rest. But the location is perfect when visiting Cooper Hewitt  Museum, Guggenheim Museum, or National Academy Museum.

I wholeheartedly support the Aussie cafe's takeover of New York and what it means for the breakfast: instead of your standard espresso and eggs Benedict, they have flat white, smashed avocado toast (yes, everyone knows you can just make it at home), banana bread with ricotta, and almond milk oatmeal. I'm all for a greasy spoon every once in awhile, but there's something both hearty and fresh about Australian brekkie that makes me want to eat it everyday (though I may have to draw the line at vegemite). Weekends 9am-2pm is a crapshoot here but once you're seated, the food comes quickly. I'm not exaggerating when I say I wanted to eat everything on the menu, and made sad eyes at my cousin until she gave in and ordered the top two that I had narrowed down - the banana bread with honey and ricotta, and the almond oat porridge with fruit and coconut. Even now, I still go back and forth about which one I liked more. The banana bread was ridiculously moist and topped with generous dollops of ricotta, honey, and fruit. Gimme that every morning. There was a little too much coconut on the porridge for my liking, but it was otherwise a 10/10, with lots of blueberries, bananas, and melted cacao. Even in the face of a slammed Saturday brunch, the service remained very mellow and laid-back. Unless you're one of the larger groups lucky enough to snag your own table in one of the vaults, be prepared to eat on top of your neighbor at the communal table. I wouldn't while away my weekend morning and chat away, though, because it does get very loud. NEXT TIME: more of the banana bread, portobello toast, more of the porridge",4,1,2

191,Mark Nowell M.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",128,138,400,4.0,8/4/2016,They have good food and I love the interior and the fact is that it's a cafe in an old church. Love their yogurt and avocado smash!,,,
192,Lou M.,"Tampa, FL",5,124,33,5.0,3/29/2017,"Fabulous Brunch/ Lunch! Enjoyed cappuccino, avocado toast and amazing Greek yogurt with house made granola- nice small place next to Guggenheim in a Church!",,,
193,Arielle S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,17,1,4.0,8/20/2017,"Great atmosphere and the food is really great! I had the avocado smash - it was delicious, the bread was fresh, and the tahini base added great depth. I needed more kick though, so I added hot sauce. The espresso was a bit bitter/acidic for me, but it's strong and I'm sure people with knowledge about coffee would say it's great quality. Service is nice, but they probably won't check in on you more than once unless you seek it out. The brunch all day Sunday thing is great, portions aren't huge but you won't leave hungry. Great quality, fresh, and right on the park - it's a great combination! Definitely worth a visit.",1,,
194,Jim H.,"SoHo, Manhattan, NY",3,86,3,2.0,10/18/2017,"Amazing food, but this place needs a lesson on restaurant management. Every time I am here, the line is filled with people asking to cancel simple coffee orders as it is taking too long. On my last trip, I waited 14m for my to go iced coffee, and waited 30m for my to go yogurt (and never got it!, I finally gave up and left). Such a shame as the food and everything is quite good.",,,
195,小米,"Queens, Queens, NY",84,2,2,5.0,5/28/2017,"Beautiful café! Had a comfortable morning with their nice attitude and delicious food. Food is more expensive than other café, but I am willing to pay for it. =) It's crowed in weekends. Better go earlier to line up for seats.",,,
196,Tracy W.,"New York, NY",370,54,40,5.0,4/1/2016,"Best avo toast !! I got mine with a poached egg on top, which was cooked perfectly. The coffee is also top notch and delicious. If you're trying to avoid the crowd, I'd recommend coming here before 12-2 (peak brunching hours) because there is a bit of a wait during that time period on weekends.",1,1,1
197,Anastasia H.,"Philadelphia, PA",0,8,3,3.0,3/7/2017,"Meh. Beautiful spot, but very, very small (and so even with only 20+ patrons they were busy) with below average service. I stood in the doorway by the ""please wait to be seated"" sign for a good 10 minutes before having to ask if I could sit at one of the bar stools, received a glass but no water, they were out of vegemite, etc. I ordered a flat white which was okay and the avocado smash which was DELICIOUS. Worth $13? Maybe not, but still really good. Tip: They don't accept cash! Definitely a surprise. Service 1/5Ambiance 5/5Food 5/5Price 3/5",,1,
198,Chuck S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,5,2.0,10/28/2017,"Good food- terrible service. I live in the neighborhood and stopped in for breakfast this morning. The woman seating people told me there was a wait for a table, even though there were open seats. Then, seated another couple that walked up right away, right in front of me. I flagged her down and asked if they had open seats, then she acted out off and sat me. Maybe they don't like single seats?Once seated, I waited 15 minutes for a black coffee, literally never got water and was never once checked on once food was dropped.I'm sure they get enough tourists that they don't care if they treat people like crap.",,,
199,Davina C.,Hong Kong,227,79,76,5.0,4/16/2016,"This is my 4th Bluestone Lane location, and my experience here once again goes to show the consistency of its quality throughout its stores!  The outdoor seating is perfect for people watching or just enjoying the first glimpses of spring, and the indoor seating equally gets a lovely amount of natural light.  In terms of the food, they've recently updated their menus, so now when you order the Brekkie Board, you're not limited to the yogurt pot but you can choose from oats or a smoothie bowl.  I got the latter, and I loved how it wasn't too sweet.  They don't explicitly state it on their menu, but the smoothie bowl's base was made from a blend of avocado, spinach and almond milk.  The avocado toast portion of the Brekkie Board was delicious as usual - basically an amazing weekend brunch here!",1,,
