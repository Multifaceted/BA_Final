1,Susan F.,"New York, NY",1,125,638,3.0,7/14/2018,"Had lunch on a Saturday when all NYers are out of town so no trouble getting a tableSat by the window. Cute room, larger in the back. Prefer the frontHad the shrimp salad which had great components to the dish. The only problem was the chef totally drowned fhe salad with the dressing. It's a worthy dish just make sure you ask for the dressing on the side.  Would def order it againThe tuna nicoise salad was also a beautiful plate. He was lucky because the dressing came on the side!  Tuna cooked perfectly. Haricot verts crunchy good. Nicoise olives and whole anchovies!! Oh my so goodWill def return",1,,
2,Jaewon H.,"Manhattan, NY",2,4,0,3.0,11/13/2018,"My burrata prosciutto salad was a decent little plate for the lunch. A whole burrata piece with maple syrup drizzle on top, fresh arugula, and mini size of figs which was not too sweet was just perfect. But the truffle fries that I had for side is not what I expected in this place. It was just fried  frozen potato from restaurant depot with a hint of truffle. The interior is ok, kinda hidden gem in crazy midtown East area.",,,

Updated review","I loved August before. I've had dinner there three times and brunch once. But it was pricey. LUNCH prix-fixe is a game-changer. Two courses for 25 (appetizers include a delicious tomato soup, as well as three salads and entrees include a signature salmon burger--not my thing--and a huge wonderful lightly-dressed and protein-heavy Cobb or gruyere omelet). The cocktail menu is updated. The spicy grapefruit margarita with jalapeno is fabulous. Three courses--appetizer, entree, dessert--is 30! The new bartender is female and really cool. They used to have a hot theater director/actor, Park-Slope raised, NYU Tisch. He was hot and smart and arrogant but not without justification. Once I brought a playwright friend for drinks and appetizers and they got into a big fight about Israel and politics (AIPAC). Both Jewish, both brainy arts guys, but that was a little awkward as my friend is sort of centrist and this guy was not at all center or right of center. I'm so excited about the lunch prix-fixe. So much fun!",2,1,4
4,Rosa C.,"New York, NY",70,302,102,4.0,1/21/2018,"August is a bright and airy restaurant, with high top tables as well as traditional lunch tables. A very aesthetically pleasing place to dine. Great options include the New England Breakfast and the August Burger!We visited for brunch and we had a reservation, which was good because the restaurant didn't have too many available tables at 1:30pm. I had the ""New England Breakfast,"" which used to be called the Skillet Breakfast on Cornbread. It's basically scrambled eggs with chicken sausage pieces and roasted cherry tomatoes served on a bed of cornbread in a skillet. The current menu doesn't mention the cornbread, which is very misleading. Luckily, our waiter told me that the dish comes with cornbread and he asked whether or not I still wanted to keep the extra side of potatoes I was trying to order. With that new bit of information, I decided I didn't need the $10 potatoes and I gratefully went ahead with just my entree. I quite liked the dish! The cornbread was very good and had bits of corn in it.My party also said the eggs benedict and the August burger (medium rare) were both very good.My friend who ordered the Mushroom and Gruyere omelette got a plain gruyere omelette instead. He didn't realize it was missing mushrooms until he was halfway done with the omelette. We brought this up with our server and he apologized profusely and got another omelette made- properly this time. I think they handled the situation very well, though it's unfortunate that the situation happened at all.",,,

Updated review",For the price you would expect alot better.Food was OK. Nothing very impressive.The biggest problem about this place is that they put tables for 2 about a foot away from each other so you feel like your in a $1.00 per slice pizza parlor only worse. Why worse? Because you have a waiter putting his ass in your face while he's attending to the table next to you. Next time I'll go to the pizza parlor and save $200 and avoid butt face.,,,

If it weren't for being with friends and their kids I would have got up and left. Place was barely packed, you could tell understaffed, but waiting over 40 minutes for a Bellini and more than an hour for food is beyond ridiculous. Also the staff had attitudes and I get it could be frustrating but every table next to us I could overhear complaining. Food was ok when we eventually got it but Definitely won't be coming back.",,,

Updated review","Originally gave this 4 stars(4.5, damn yelp), but after coming here another time I had to update to 5 stars. Original review below:Decor - the interior design is a good blend of modern with old school New York. The walls are sandblasted brick with a gray finish that have up lights coming from behind the benched seating that sets a good ambiance for work events or a romantic date night. The bar is slightly small, but enough to accommodate the casual walk in.Service - the host was very welcoming and accommodating. The Resturant takes coats which is convenient in the winter, and the host/concierge stops by throughout the meal to see how things are going. He was kind enough to pull up a second table to our own in order to give us room for our wine and house bread. The rest of the wait staff seem a little undertrained but performed at a high level. The waitress seemed to lack knowledge of the daily special, but other than that was very helpfulFood - The food was the best part of the experience. They serve house bread with homemade yogurt/butter sauce. We started with the Burrata as an appetizer that was hard to resist ordering another. We ordered the braised short ribs and braised beef(daily special) that came wonderfully cooked and impressively dressed. The sides of grilled Brussels sprouts, fried green tomatoes, and eggplant were all amazing accoutrements to the dishes. We finished with a chocolate lava cake with peanut butter ganache with banana nut ice cream that was a satisfying end to a delicious meal.Overall 4.5. Highly recommended",,,
10,Alisha M.,"Manhattan, NY",31,18,18,3.0,8/27/2017,"Extremely slow service, took about an hour for food to come out once we ordered (not an exaggeration). Also the french toast we ordered was completely burnt, I uploaded the picture to Yelp separately. Yet, interesting items on the menu. I enjoyed my Soft-Shell Crab BLT and my family enjoyed what they ordered, only drawback were those mentioned. I'm sure I would've given 4-stars if the slow service didn't ruin the experience.",,,
11,Kimberly T.,"New York, NY",53,385,10,2.0,12/29/2017,"Stopped in for lunch with a girlfriend visiting me near my office. Food was decent (I had tuna tartare and she had the salmon burger) but the service was pretty horrendous. Talk about slow. Granted we did arrive during lunch, but it was far busier when we left so the slow service was just not acceptable. The tables are also incredibly close together so feel free to come here and dine with 50+ of your closest strangers now friends.",,,

Updated review","Made lunch reservation for 12:15, arrived on time & not many people, did not get main entrees of cobb salad until after 1:30. Order the pix fixe which is two for $25 or three course for $30 which was appealing and had many options. We had large size portion of beet salad which was very cold with goat cheese schmear hidden beneath. The zuccini fries were good a bit on the salty side. The cobb salads had wayyy too many olives & large chunks of ham, bacon bits, bleu cheese, & hard boiled egg with romaine/iceberg lettuce. I do like the ambiance & decor. Comfy booth/banquette seating & pleasing atmosphere. Service is attentive, just took forever. I want to love this place, but hasn't lived up to my expectations so far.",3,,

So I lived in the West Village during the time that August was on Bleecker Street. Moving forward, several years later, I have moved, August has moved, but I wanted to stop by the UES location to say hello and get some good eats.Made a reservation for an associate and I, and I don't know what I've been up to in order to get all this good karma I've been getting in restaurants lately, but I AM NOT COMPLAINING because I honestly got the best table in the dining room!!! Like, I feel like it was waiting just for us!!And the food was good of course, but I already knew that.My dear friends at August, I'll see you again. So much love and kisses.",1,,
15,Rehema K.,"Glenside, PA",0,2,0,2.0,4/27/2018,"I've been to August twice. The first time was great. Bartender was SO friendly. We didn't eat but the drinks were so good we decided to go back again the next week.During our second visit, the service was not great. There is definitely a 'regular' crowd (read: we aren't the regulars) and that was definitely reflected in the way the bartender and staff interacted with us. In addition to the sub-par service, the $27 burger was not a $27 burger. The meat was ok. The fries were ok. Only saving grace was the bun. That said, I wouldn't get it again. If I head back to August, I'll probably go only for drinks.",,,
16,Vine F.,"Manhattan, NY",0,23,0,5.0,11/16/2017,"I highly recommend August. If you want a good meal w good people, its the place to be. I had an important dinner where I was making a connection btw 2 people who are very special and important to me (my partner and my sister). I stopped by August around 3:30pm to make sure I could introduce myself and make them aware of the importance of this meal at 7:30pm. I met Alexa who was kind and assured me I would have a nice table and great time. I felt good!Then I arrive late to my reservation with my sister. My partner would also be joining late. We are welcomed by Nick, who immediately greeted us with a smile and sat us at a quiet table. This was the beginning of my interaction with Nick. He was kind, thoughtful, and accommodating the entire evening. A true joy to be around. The place was buzzing with energy and every seat was full. I was grateful they held our table despite us being late.  We start w the jalapeño margarita and the tuna tartar while we waited for the last person to arrive. Our server and Nick were appreciative of our slow, lingering pace.Tuna tartar was awesome and drinks were  great! Nick came by to check in on us and make us smile and confirm we were happy. I knew then, tonight was going to be a very good night. When my partner joined, we switched to wine and ordered the beet salad, mushrooms, Brussels, and lobster crab cake. All were tasty but the mushrooms were so good we ordered another asap. Nick kindly brought out a few other tasty dishes for us to try which was so thoughtful and generous. Dont leave this place without trying dessert. We aren't dessert people but we were having such a wonderful time, enjoying each others company and food and atmosphere - i had to order the creme brulee, warm chocolate cake, and the dark chocolate sorbet. We ate them all. Nothing left on our plates. The warm chocolate cake was bitter dark chocolate which is exactly they way i like it. The D chocolate sorbet was superb! And the creme B was sweet and crunchy. I was so pleased. We had to order the port next....All and all - a dinner that was very important to me finished better than i could have imagined. I took a chance on August (because i had never been there) and they took a chance on me. Im grateful to my sister and partner and Nick and August for making it a wonderful night that has left a lasting impression on me.",,,

Though the menu is comprehensive, I asked to substitute a carb side dish for a vegetable and was told there are no substitutions and advised  to ORDER a side dish.

18,Lena A.,"Santa Monica, CA",657,302,578,5.0,11/30/2016,"We really enjoyed our dinner here. From the moment we walked in, the staff was so friendly and made us feel as though we were coming over to a friend's house for dinner. In fact, our waiter greeted us so warmly, we paused for a second thinking we might know him. He took great pleasure in our pleasure with our dinner and had spot on recommendations. The ambiance was warm, cozy, and intimate. We loved the brick walls, eclectic wall art, and inviting bar. The perfect spot to cozy up to a great dinner when it's cold outside.Everything we tried was fabulous, but the biggest hits were the zucchini fries and the spaghetti. The fries were so light and not overly fried, with a perfect aioli sauce to complement. The spaghetti was freshly made, so light, and so flavorful. They even cut up the spaghetti so you don't have to bother with awkwardly twirling around long strands of pasta. We also enjoyed the grilled caesar salad, cornbread, sole, tuna tartare, brussel sprouts and salted caramel crème brulee. While it was all good, we wanted to have those zucchini fries and that spaghetti again and again. No pasta compared for the rest of the weekend, which means it's a MUST-TRY!We'd most likely be back and with all the great food NYC has to offer, that's saying a lot!",3,2,3

20,Stella R.,"Manhattan, NY",1,162,21,3.0,8/27/2017,"Rather dissapointing experience.I was a big fan of August in it's former location and perhaps dinner is a better experience here but brunch was pretty lacking.We were a party of six on a August Summer morning early afternoon. The restaurant was maybe 1/3 full.Our waiter while friendly was not too attentive and the real annoyance was the 40 minutes wait to get our good, especially when we had two hungry kids in tow.4 of us enjoyed our brunch (salmon burger, regular burger, Cobb salad, soft shell blt) but the French toast came our black and burned and I was surprised it was actually served. When we brought it to their attention, they offered to replace it but at this point the poor hungry kids were devouring our food.Similarly the dessert took another long time to arrive and we were so done. August, you show promise to return to your former glory, but hire some more wait staff and kitchen staff.",,,
21,andrea p.,"New York, NY",347,450,859,4.0,1/8/2017,The food was excellent but the service was painfully slow. We were told to at the end (after waiting 1 hr for our food ) that one of the waiters was missing .The cornbread and my crab cakes Benedict were superb .,,,

23,Laura S.,"Manhattan, NY",120,296,4,3.0,6/12/2017,"I really wanted to love this place. The layout is perfect with a bar near the front window area and seating in the back. Totally unexpected for the location, right? Also, the cocktails are fabulous. Tried a spicy margarita which was great, and difficult to choose from a vast array of delicious and refreshing sounding options.The food unfortunately was so-so.Tried the roasted tomato soup as well as the chilled pea soup with scallops. Both were great.We also ordered the zucchini shoestring fries which were disappointing. They were covered in a very thick batter and had no flavor. The charred Caesar salad wasn't terrible, but it wasn't a properly mixed salad. Instead, it was presented as two romaine heads covered in dressing.On the house, we received the crispy eggplant with burrata tomatoes and pesto. Though I definitely appreciate freebies, this one had no flavor, and ended up turning what I was hoping to be a light meal into a heavy one with too many fried foods.The inconsistency bothers me because I loved the vibe and the cocktails! Service was great too. I think the menu could be refined though.",,,
24,Zachary S.,"Vero Beach, FL",305,355,3135,3.0,10/1/2016,"I was one of the first to try August after it moved up from the Village a few years back. I was drawn in by the sleek decor, great location and inviting menu. I stopped coming for several reasons. These were: The noise levels were high, the bar a bit on the small side, staff turnover rates that seemed unusually high (""I'll have to check with the kitchen, today is my first day"" was a frequent server response when we had a question or special request), the hosts/managers openly bickered and, most importantly, there was inconsistent (and uninspired) food. I returned for lunch the other day because it was conveniently located near the cinema we were going to. Some things have gotten better. It seems quieter and they've added high tops in the front to make the bar area more attractive. I'm writing this review because I was disappointed with my choice for lunch. I ordered Niçoise salad. Apart from the fish, it had a solid chunk of lettuce, sliced fingerlings, haricot ver, a hard boiled egg and anchovy dressing (which wasn't very good). Where were the olives and tomatoes? Why no herbs? I didn't mind spending $23 for it, but I've never had a restaurant offer such a poor excuse for a Niçoise salad. It makes me wonder about what else the kitchen puts out.",3,,1

26,Nina L.,"New York, NY",541,717,153,5.0,7/9/2016,"For my 600th Yelp review I would like to take a second to commend the management staff at August for their seamless transition from the West Village to the Upper East Side. From the appropriate alterations in the decor, to the vibrant seasonal menu, August has all the components of what a wonderfully balanced New American establishment should possess. I came here with my family early on a Friday evening and from the moment we were seated it was a phenomenal experience. The staff and host were incredibly attentive, including detailed recommendations of menu items. We ordered the burrata with beet purée as an appetizer and even though we're a family of Italian-American origin we were blown away by the freshness and texture of the cheese as well as it's pairing with the subtly sweet beet treatment. For entrees I sampled three, each better than the next. We agreed we highly recommend the cod, mushroom risotto, and roasted chicken on the summer 2016 menu. The cod was perfectly cooked, the risotto creamy but delicate, and the chicken crisply coated.I'm eager to return and suggest August to friends. The chef is truly talented as is the ownership in it's operation of the restaurant.",4,,

37,Emily L.,"Manhattan, NY",151,13,0,2.0,1/9/2018,"I will preference this that the night started out with 5 stars, and the service slowly made it go downhill. We went here for a friend's birthday dinner. We were seated promptly, despite not having the full party and offered drinks right away. We asked if we could order appetizers before the entire party got there and they were very accomodating. We let our waiter know that it was our friend's birthday, he acknowledged it and noted that his birthday was the day prior.Our appetizers arrived --cornbread was excellent, fried eggplant was okay (don't think you're ordering a burrata as the burrata was minimum), zucchini fries were great for a group. We then ordered our main courses. There were 7 of us (so not a small group) and the majority of the table were choosing between two dishes asking the waiter for preferences. The waiter was joking around, steering people in the direction that he wanted them to go. I actually think I may have been the only person who had a definite choice--the swordfish--which I noted I was going to order as soon as we looked at the menu. When the meal comes, everyone was served and they brought me the sole. While the sole looked fine, I had ordered swordfish (as it was grilled and not pan-seared) and wanted it, so I flagged the waiter to let them know there was a mix-up with the order. As opposed to apologizing for the mix- up, I received a bit of attitude from the waiter and then had to wait probably a good 30 minutes as my friends ate their food (as we didn't want it to get cold) and until my swordfish was ready.  No apologies from the waiter, not even an acknowledgement on why it was taking so long to bring the new order (as grilled swordfish doesn't usually take that long to cook). While I did confirm with my friends that I definitely said swordfish, we all agreed a simple apology for the mix-up (even if he thought it was my mistake) would have gone a long way here.From there, the dinner went downhill. Nobody checked in on us as we finished our meal, except to take away my friends plates as I still ate (we asked that they keep them). We ordered dessert (as it was our friend's birthday), which they brought out with no candle, despite us repeating that it was her birthday. We got the bill, and while they took off some of the wine we ordered, it wasn't acknowledged upfront (as that would have meant an apology for the food mix up) and a generous gratuity was automatically added.While the food and ambience were nice, the restaurant certainly wasn't cheap.  For that type of money, there are plenty of other places around the city to go where the service is much better.",,,

The waiters looks completely overwhelmed and were running back and forth to the chicken, assuming host and busboy duties. My vegetarian friend asked for a tartine with the beef and the dish came from the kitchen with mistakes twice. Drinks were not served in time, the check took a long time to arrive. My beet salad had no dressing, etc etc. So many little details adding up to a bitter experience unfortunately.

All were superb.  I can be snobby about food, and the zucchini was in a very light batter and the lemon mayonnaise wonderfully tart and fresh and wonderful.  When the charred Caesar salad was served, it looked a little strange, but it was wonderfully fresh tasting but with a hint of charred smoke taste. Again, wonderful.  The gruyere and mushroom omelette was nice and light and flavorful. It could not have been better.Oops, I almost forgot the Mange sorbet my wife ordered. I hate sorbet, but I tasted it anyway, and it was by far the best sorbet I have tasted. It was so full of mango, that it was half like a mango puree. Truly great.           Highly recommended",,,
41,T C.,"New York, NY",0,17,6,3.0,8/12/2017,"It's nice - menu is boring & basic. No one offered me bread , when dinner came , no one offered salt and/or pepper. My spaghetti was really linguini , or ""can I get you another drink?"", No one asked - ""how is everything""  - music only played in the front, nothing in the back - I'm not coming back - but from what I hear they are not lasting much longer anyway ... this is restaurant 101 - disappointed -  the food was ok, I'm headed to Tavern 62  by David  Burke after this .. cheesecake lollipops here I come !!!!",,,

44,James A.,"New York, NY",0,3,0,1.0,6/24/2017,"I was once a regular at the downtown location back in 2004-05. Of course, the founding chef Tony Liu was plucked up by none other than Keith McNally. Shame... Comparatively this place should have a different name, for it is poorly executed from the service to the inconsistency of the plates. Although the owner, Andrew Chapman, stole the concept with his silver spoon from a Mr. Jason Hennings, he knows little about the craftsmanship of what makes a great restaurant. He's probably on vacation. Go figure.",,,
45,Connor C.,"New York, NY",2,10,9,5.0,11/11/2016,"I left thoroughly impressed with my experience at this spot; everything from the service to the atmosphere to the food was spot-on. I went with some friends and was fortunate enough to try many of the items on the menu, and nothing we tried - from the hot cornbread to the mushroom puffs to the Long Island Duck to the apple cinnamon crepe for dessert - was anything short of excellent. If you happen to work in the area or ever find yourself by the Lex/59th St subway stop, make it a point to drop by here and enjoy a fantastic meal. Bang up job by the staff there, particularly the chef who created and executed that menu as well as he or she did.",,,
46,Alex K.,"Brooklyn, NY",9,11,6,5.0,3/8/2017,"I couldn't have recommended this restaurant more highly. August was an exquisite experience.This restaurant offers the best of the best, in service, food, and atmosphere. Bringing my family here for dinner was the best idea, because we all enjoyed our food so much, that we got to meet with the humble and genuine head chef of the kitchen. The chef shows how much the restaurant means to him and his team, and it all shows in the quality of food, service, and atmosphere. I ordered a Filet Minon with crab, a delicious dish with the most tender and juiciest steak I have ever tried. It comes with asparagus, which is topped with a variety of spices that give you amazing flavors beyond the average dish. Appetizers were phenominal, in the sauces, cheeses, bread and so much more. Augustis a beautiful, modern restaurant, with a calm and relaxing setting. The waiters are the kindest people and will always share a smile with you. The food was prepared to perfection, with time and effort showing. The dishes were works of art, and tasted just as good as they looked. August deserves more than 5 stars. Will definately be coming back with friends and family. Alex K.Brooklyn, NY",,,1
47,Hope S.,"Manhattan, NY",237,59,3,3.0,4/19/2016,"SO, the reasons why I am giving August three stars are the following:Inconsistent food: I've had bomb meals here and then I've had half frozen crab fritters here.  The chef is amazing but cannot produce consistency, which is a major problem for a restaurant to have.  Every time my boyfriend and I have gone and had something go wrong, they would either send something out on curtesy or take care of our check all together.  The last time I was here was a week ago and we ordered our entrees which never came out, so they picked up the check for us.  This chef should move out to a more rural location with less traffic such as Westchester of Greenwich, where he would get the same cliental so he can focus on mastering consistency",1,1,1
48,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",140,352,290,5.0,6/14/2016,"The staff here is extraordinary.  We came early for dinner on a Sunday and they seated us in a lovely corner spot.  Service was attentive, sweet and polite.The restaurant is lovely and a nice cozy and classy spot for a quiet Sunday dinner.  I'm rarely on the UES so always pleased when lucky to have landed in a nice place.I had the salmon and my friend has the cod and we both finished our dishes.  The salmon is really superb.  I loved the avocado cucumber relish that accompanied it.  And the croutons.  It was one of the most memorable and best salmon dishes I have had.  Perfectly cooked.My friend and I stayed for *hours* and the staff were just so chill about it.  They left us to talk endlessly after we were done and they had taken our plates and that is what I would consider the perfect Sunday dinner experience.  We hadn't even realized how late we had stayed until I noticed the staff had even changed clothes and were eating their dinner.  Really extraordinary service with smiles all around.",,,
49,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",481,584,4462,4.0,5/19/2015,"KenScale: 8.0/10August had been a perennial date spot in West Village before shutting down abruptly due to rent hike. I have never had a chance to check out the place, but fortunately it was reborn on the Upper East Side nearby Barneys. I'm glad that it has started its second life, because my recent dining experience was quite satisfying. It's hard to categorize the food at August; perhaps American bistro with French accent would probably be the closest description. I really don't care either since the soulful dishes coming from the kitchen can make you smile. I've had some outstanding burrata dishes in New York City, but the one at August that came with sweet onion crumble and pickled ramps was another winner, and I can't stop thinking about that delicious crumble! Hamachi crudo with avocado mousse, snow peas and lime sorbet also had very nice touch, with juicy crudo that had citrusy flavor working very well together. North Atlantic cod with lemon broth and sea beans felt somewhat overcooked but it nonetheless had clean flavor. I was also a fan of the roast duck, with the combination of sliced breast working so well with apricot puree and warm radish salad and making me think when was the last time I had a duck dish this good. For dessert, go with the crème brulee, While it doesn't look fancy, the combination of yogurt and lavender won me over as well as my dining companion, who declared it the best crème brulee she's had in her life. I can't speak of how the ambiance has changed at the restaurant compared to its old days on Bleecker Street, but the dining room is still modern without being stuffy. The restaurant has a full bar with some interesting cocktail choices. I had no problem getting a reservation a week in advance. If you happen to be walking by Upper East Side (perhaps after a museum tour or shopping at one of the department stores), do check out August. It will surprise with you some flavor and texture.",,,
50,Caitlin F.,"Mount Kisco, NY",152,2,0,2.0,1/16/2017,I went to August for Brunch last weekend and though we were sat right away for our noon reservation everything after that point was down hill. The service was painfully slow and was told after waiting over 1 hr for our food that one of the waiters was missing and that there were other larger groups of tables that needed to be tended to before us. I pointed out to the waiter that we were actually seated and orders in before the larger groups and when he brought out our food it was ice cold. I could only imagine that they had completely forgot about our table.,1,,1
51,Naeem M.,"Silver Spring, MD",114,145,1,5.0,2/16/2016,"A perfect Valentine's Day dinner date in a very cozy, intimate atmosphere with great service - one of the more memorable dining experiences I've had in the last few years and yet another reminder why the NYC dining scene is so much better than anything in DC. It's all about the little things - the charm and intimacy you can find in such a restaurant in such a big city.Though offered the special V-day menu, we instead went with the regular dinner menu's risotto with mushrooms that were perfectly sauteed - very meaty chewy in a subtle yet gritty risotto base. My short ribs with crispy brussel sprouts glazed in a honey-Srichacha sauce (giving it a General Tso-like flavor but not as sweet or overpowering) came out perfectly as well - probably some of the most tender beef I've had.The bread was pretty decent but the lemon yogurt sauce it came accompanied was a unique revelation (bread refills are free so make sure to load up).Though smallish, tables were far apart and quiet enough to have engaging discussions about love, life, and purpose - a great place for dinner whether a first date or for celebrating a silver anniversary. Side note: Our host (resembling a combination of Chekov from the Abram's Star Trek and Malcom from Malcom in the Middle) was very entertaining - after spying me Instagraming the short ribs, he offered us free dessert for tagging the head chef - a great personal touch. We went home with chocolate-covered strawberries.Couldn't ask for a better Valentine's Day dinner.",1,1,

53,Chelsea J.,"Austin, TX",295,3,0,1.0,11/15/2017,"I've been wanting to try August for a long time as I always pass by and think it looks so cute and charming. Finally made a dinner reservation for 8PM. My plans changed and I had to push back dinner to 8:45PM, and when I called to let them know this, the hostess on the phone awkwardly told me ""the kitchen closes at 9, so....."" (mind you, you can even make a reservation on OpenTable for 9PM) When I said we would definitely be there before 9 and could order right away, the hostess on the phone was mute. I finally asked if that was still okay and she told me it would be best to come another night. I canceled my reservation, angry that they rudely brushed me off, and turned down service when they were clearly still open. Still deciding where to go, we thought we would just pop in and try to get a table anyways.. walked in exactly at 8:45, and of course after they told us again the kitchen is closing soon, we got a table, and placed our order by 8:50. The servers were slow, unattentive, and overall annoyed by our presence (even though the restaurant was packed, still at 10PM). To the chef's credit, the food was good, but because of the service and general rudeness, they make me not want to go back.. plenty of other restaurants in the city with good food AND good service!",,,

It is to die for. I also ordered a watermelon salad which was out of this world and the salmon. Everything is 5 stars. The staff is super friendly and I also met the manager who was very friendly and asked if I liked everything. You can also sit at the bar. I chose a window table and the front opens up so it was wide open and felt really nice. This was in the summer so it was perfect. Nice ambience and subtle lights. The bathroom was very very clean. Overall a must try if you go to Lexington. You will not regret this. Also this is a perfect place for date night. It is very cozy and romantic. So if you're thinking of where to go this is the perfect place.,,,

My friend had the spaghetti which she said was nothing to rave about. However the chicken was cooked perfectly.Now for the service- My friend and I had been promptly seated once we got to the restaurant and were served water as well, however, it took over 15 minutes for us to be asked if we were ready to order. After dinner we ordered dessert and after a minute another waiter walked by and offered us a dessert menu. Usually at a restaurant this size, waiters are assigned different sections to serve, however, it seemed the waitstaff is told to walk around the restaurant and serve whomever they want which can be frustrating if they do not come your way. At the end of the meal we handed off our credit cards to a waiter who became too busy and never came back. After waiting for 15 minutes we had to wave down the manager to ask what was going on. He went around asking every waiter if they had the bill and credit cards. After another couple minutes the manager returned and asked if we were sure that we had handed a waiter our credit cards which honesty made us both worried that our cards had been handed to another table. They were finally about to find our cards but all that frustration could've been easily avoided if the waiters were allotted areas to serve.",,,

I was immediately impressed by the decor and energy when I entered the door. It feels welcoming and intimate without being low-lit or cave-like or filled with private booths...like the best modern bistros of Paris. The menu is shared plates and while not extensive, it is certainly sufficient. The bartender was friendly and very well educated about drinks of all kinds. The wine list isn't extensive but it is good, and I know wine. We had cod, chicken, and delicious Shishito peppers - all were excellent. The bill was reasonable, though the wine markup does seem on the expensive side. Next time I'd bring my own bottle, but if I forgot to do so I'd still spend my money and choose something from their list. Definitely would return on my next trip to NYC.",,,

We don't have high chairs2. We don't know if we can fit your stroller3. Our wifi is ""down"".

67,Bob G.,"JAMAICA, NY",17,200,300,4.0,5/13/2017,"Visited August on a Saturday evening with a reservation. Host gave us the option of being seated at one of the hi top tables adjacent to the bar or one of the coventional tables in the dining area. We opted for the latter. First off, the dining space is incredibly desinged to make the most of the space. Kudos to whoever designed the space. Service throughout the evening was impeccable. The staff was attentive but unobtrusive; there at the right times. Now to the food. The Chilled Pea Soup with Scallopes on Toast with Lemon Crème Fraîche was excellent though a bit difficult to eat since the soup was chiled but the Scallops on toast were hot.  Sugar Snap Peas Excellent but the menu price was $14 and the price on the bill was $17. The waiter adjusted the price but not sure why this happened. The Roasted Tomato Soup ithGruyere Toast was excellent The toast was  hiding behind the bowl and was added to the soup. The $36 soft shell crab special  couuld not be better. The crabs were crisp on the outside but juicy on the inside with a fantastic texture and flavor.The Grilled Australian Sea Bass with Zucchini, Roasted Peppers, Mediterranean Olives, and Basil Potatoes was excellent. This dish was perfect and the Basil Potatoes were amazing! Dessert was Hot Applie Pie À La Mode A hot brioche with wonderful apple filling and vanilla ice cream. Delicious! Overall, a fantastic dinner.",,,

If you get drinks it starts to get pretty pricey very quickly. But I think it's worth it. The people here are all so nice, I've never had a problem. The decor is very nice and clean. Now I usually don't write reviews unless a place sucks so much I have to write about it, but there's something I need to share. I guess this week August is offering a restaurant week menu. It was all very good, but the outstanding thing was from the dessert. I got the apple and hibiscus sorbets. The hibiscus was too tart for my liking, which is fine others probably like tartness... But the apple was amazing. There were tiny bits of Apple still in it, it was so fresh, but at the same time almost  nostalgic, like kids apple juice. It's as if they made kids apple juice fancy 5 start fresh apple juice and then turned it into an amazing sorbet. And I just felt like I needed to share this.I don't know how long he restaurant week menu will be around but either way this place's food is pretty great and the people are amazing.",,,

There was only one couple drinking and just me and my friend. We had to get the bartender's attention a couple of times as we only had about an hour left to order our drinks before they were closing.

First of all, the service was very good. Excellent recommendations on food, and while the knowledge of the wine list was a bit lacking, our choice turned out to be very good.For appetizers, we had the burrata and hamachi (they had just sold out of the popular fried green tomatoes). The burrata was served with a very interesting crushed walnut dust along with some fresh beets that worked really well together. I highly recommend it. For entrees, we went with seafood. The red snapper was delightfully presented with excellent garnishments of tomato and cucumber. The cod, while not as aesthetically prepared, was fresh, delicate, and tasty.As mentioned earlier, the white Italian wine selection was very good, quite complex, and served pleasingly chilled. Not outrageously priced either.Give this place a try... great for a date.",,,

We were the second table in the restaurant and it took nearly 25 mins or longer for the food to come. I ordered the chicken sandwich. My bread was hard. The chicken was extremely deep fried and there was a piece of hair in my salad. Needless to say, I didn't touch the salad on my plate even after they returned my food. Yeah nothing to brag about",5,3,2

We've been disappointed by overhyped places claiming to have a farm to table vibe, but the food at August is really really good. They actually know how to cook fish. In fact, this was the first perfectly done fish I've had since moving to NYC 9 months ago. The appetizers were a little more creative than your usual fare. And I'm still daydreaming about their freshly baked cornbread, which was bizarrely scrumptious. This place has better food at a better price than other hyped up places in hipper parts of town.

I work in this area and I normally go to Fig and Olive but after checking out Yelp this is truly a 5 star restaurant. Everything from being seated, even though I didn't have a reservation they asked where I would like to be seated. I wish I can remember the host's name because he truly elevated my experience from beginning to end. This host needs to be recognized, I have never met such a top notch host even at 5 star restaurants. I do not remember what appetizer my friend ordered but it was yellow tail with amazing sauce thing with vegetable sprinkles! I'm not being literal here of course. I had the fried green tomatoes (AMAZING!) and their salmon. My friend had the scallops and she loved it.The drinks, my friend had a class of wine and I had the Manhattan and I have to say, one of the best in Manhattan. I rate PDT's Manhattan (bacon old fashion) the best in NYC. We just simply had an amazing experience, everything was simply perfect and the HOST stopped us on the way out to ask us about our dinner. What we liked best and what we disliked of course we had nothing but great things to comment on.This place is a hidden gem and if you would like a nice dinner with great food and drinks this place should be at the top of your list.

80,Arpan N.,"Manhattan, NY",1,6,2,1.0,3/31/2017,"We went here for dinner. The service was not close to what I had expected after reading the review. The decor was of a cheap diner (steel tables with no mats). The silver ware was resting on the table - just didn't feel it was justifiable for the hype of this place. Also, the food that we got was sub par - I have had better. The price did not go along with the door and food taste and service. I was there to celebrate a birthday and when they got the cake out - they did not put any candles and when I asked for a candle they said they were out of it. However all the other tables that were also celebrating birthdays had a small candle. I wouldn't recommend this place.",,,

The food was absolutely awful. We got this cornmeal gnocchi appetizer that said it had a cheddar sauce but was delivered with a brown mushroom sauce and pieces of mushrooms that made it look like a plate of diarrhea. Sadly, it didn't taste any better. The center was dry and, well, cornmeal-y. When our waitress came by and asked how the food was, I let her know it was only okay and tasted a bit odd. She just thanked us for the feedback, and that was it. I don't expect them to take the meal off our tab, per se, but it would have been thoughtful to ask if she could get us something else or if she could do anything to make it better. Nope.Then I got chicken. It had been 45 mins since we finished our appetizer and still no food. As soon as I asked how much longer it would be, the waitress soon returned with out food. The chicken was overcooked and tasted old and dried out. Not sure if it was sitting under heat lamps or what, but it was tough and not flavorful at all.Sadly, we will not be returning to this aesthetically attractive spot.",2,,
82,Gilda B.,"Manhattan, NY",1,5,0,3.0,9/1/2015,"August Restaurant would have received 4 stars if the waiter that tended to us wasn't so sour and unpleasant to deal with from the moment we arrived.  I ordered a starter and entree and he brought out both together while giving my starter to another guest in our party.  He didn't seem to care about the snafu.  Also, it's rather unprofessional to complain to your co-worker about the table your working while they are still seated - that did not go unnoticed.  The food, decor and ambiance of the patrons are lovely and a welcome addition to the area.",,,

I had brunch here recently and it was delicious. The Mimosas were perfect, the eggs tasted like eggs, (no mean feat these days), the greens crisp. I would like to see an ""assemble your own"" omelet option even if from a short list of ingredients and some sort of home fry type of potato rather than the (delicious) french fries that accompany the omelet. This is a busy spot already - I recommend the bartender stick to bartending and leave the tables to the wait staff, (who were excellent).

Finally they have opened and it's such a great addition to the neighborhood!  Love the light airy decore. Nice bar area for cocktails (fabulous) and good atmosphere.  Price points are refreshingly affordable (cocktails are in $10 range,  appetizers around $14 and mains around $32, big enough to share). We started with the burrata special (amazing) and peektoe crab (tasty but a little salty after the burrata. Would recommend starting with the crab with a glass of bubbly then moving onto other dishes. For our main we shared the veal - amazing and perfect on a chilly winter night.   Dessert was salted caramel creme brulee (highlight), which was incredible. Tables in the middle are good for small business dinners, and corner tables will be the go-to tables for dates. Great spot, really excited that they have brought a breath of fresh air uptown!!Highly recommend.",7,2,

We ordered martinis and wine - all great and reasonably priced. The food is not cheap and served in very small portions. It's all delicious, but almost absurdly meager given what you're paying for; however, for four of us to split three appetizers and two bottles of wine (with a round of cocktails to start), it was $60, so not awful either.

The ""fresh squeezed"" juice was neither fresh nor squeezed and was more likely Tropicana from a carton, for which I was charged $8 a glass. The food was a B- at best (""hot"" dishes were cold) and the portions were so small, we had to go elsewhere to eat afterwards. A definite pass!",,,
88,Jojo K.,"New York, NY",4,12,0,3.0,1/30/2016,"This wasn't my first time at this restaurant in its new location, but it's been the worst experience.  Friday nights tend to be busy in New York City, granted.  With understaffed and overwhelmed servers and with an excuse of being short handed in the kitchen, the only thing prompt about this evening was getting seated and clearing the table of our plates.  It took FORTY-FIVE MINUTES for our server to take our food order, and second drink order. It took another twenty minutes for someone to realize our drink order was never put in.  The manager, we think, tried to accommodate, but he pretty much served us whatever he wanted.  When we told him that it was wrong, he said he assumed it was what we wanted because it started with the same letter.  Then, he said he wouldn't charge us for the mistake.  Really, I would think not.  It was obvious that the kitchen was backed-up when it took another twenty minutes to get our appetizers. THE ENTREES were over salted and luke-warm, the scallops were more like a salt-lick than seafood.  They were returned (and, I rarely feel the need to return anything back to the kitchen).  So, half the party ate while half the party waited for the replacement.The replacement entrée (which took another 20 minutes) was cooked with more care, served hot and well seasoned.  Apologies were given. The meal took 3 hours and 15 minutes (granted we ordered dessert and coffee).In one word...INCONSISTENT.  The wait wouldn't have been so bad if the food was done properly, hot and well-seasoned.  I know this place can be good, I just wish it was good all the time.  I've read reviews where people have said the food was a miss...now I know why.  I'll probably go back, but never on a Friday or Saturday night.  And, maybe not for a while.  New Yorkers work hard for their money and there are plenty of restaurants to spend it at (since, I don't really cook).  The 3-star rating is for the previous dining experiences, or it would have been a 2.",1,,

We left grateful for our Open Table points knowing that we could use them elsewhere and made a pact to never return.We ordered the Watermelon Ricotta appetizer to start - along with a bunch of other things to try. The appetizer came out with only chunks of watermelon. We asked our waiter where the ricotta was and he told us it was sprinkled on top. We said there was absolutely no way that was possible.

There was an issue with the bottle of wine we selected and with no questions asked, they brought us a new bottle. I had the tuna tartare and it was delectable.....tangy, tender, and very flavorful. For my main course I had the cod and this could have been the best cooked piece of fish I've ever had. It was delicious! The sting beans and rice that accompanied it were seasoned perfectly.

93,Kalie K.,"Manhattan, NY",7,75,4,4.0,5/10/2016,"I recently came to August for my third visit and was as impressed as my previous two. I selected it originally for it's seemingly rustic and inviting vibe the outside offers, and feel that the culinary experience certainly upholds this feeling. Many great, fresh vegetable dishes that are reminiscent of a true farm to table restaurant. Food does have a higher salt content than many restaurants may, but this is something that appeals to me when done well and gives the food an additional flavor kick we all hope for. Menu is always slightly different (so don't get too attached to any one dish, particularly the starters) but each time we have tried a special that has been a favorite. Will definitely be back!",,,

The eggs were nothing special, but, well they're eggs - aside from a touch of gold leaf, there's nothing much you can do to them to make them particularly amazing. The service was wonderfully friendly and very prompt, and all of the little touches around the restaurant (e.g. the pretty little tulip in a vase in the middle of our table) made the dining experience all the more enjoyable.

My stomach cried!  We called over the manager and the entire table insisted the size was inadequate and offensive.  He was incredulous with my shock and said ""this is our normal portion, but I will talk to the chef"". He came back and said ""this is our portion"" and offered me carrots as a supplement.  Yet another upper eastside restaurant that thinks it can take advantage of the costumer because of its address. The offensive part was that the manager (English bloke in case you need to know) totally knew it was a pathetic looking meal and at 9pm when the restaurant was almost cleared out he could not accdomodate me with something I should have had in the first place, a substantive piece of chicken. To boot, they pack you in like sardines. I think the restaurant is only getting customers because it is a transplant from the West Village which tends to have more innovative restaurants than.

I ate there the week it opened months ago, as well as two weeks ago and j wasn't disappointed. Service is attentive and friendly--the waiters are not stiff as you might expect from a high end establishment in a neighborhood like this.

Updated review","How is this place so under the radar?  The food is as good as any of the top restaurants in NYC right now.  If there were downtown it would be on everyone's list.  Also it's much better than its west village predecessor.This was my second dinner here and I thought the food was equally phenomenal to the first time.  Although the menu and dishes seem simple, the taste is anything but with extremely creative flavor combinations which are difficult to describe, done with an expert touch and gourmet twist and plated beautifully - we had fried eggplant which was lightly breaded with a parmesan cream, raisins and tomatoes which was interesting and light, not doughy.  The flavors were subtle and unusual together.  The burrata with beet and farro sounds like any other farm to table dish but was served beautifully in spherical domes with yellow and red beets.  Chicken with fried rice and Chinese broccoli was great and surprising - rice came in cubes with white cheddar which was an interesting twist and anything but a staple chicken and rice dish.  Scallops with hen of the wood mushrooms were cooked perfectly and paired with a maple based sauce and I also loved the brussel sprouts with sriracha and honey for a spicy/sweet taste.  Also the pita chips and homemade sweet potato hummus they bring in the beginning is delicious and the wine list is very varied, with a wide range of prices and creative options.  Overall reading the menu it seems to be ordinary, but taste the food!  It is inventive and you will not be disappointed!",,,

120,Tracy T.,"Manhattan, NY",2,60,10,2.0,1/2/2015,"I really want to like this place more than I do. I even waited a few days to write the review because I thought maybe as I reflected on it, I'd think better of the experience. That didn't happen.  I read the other reviews and thought, maybe I am just missing something, but despite more reflecting, my opinion hasn't changed. I think this place has a ton a followers from its downtown location who are really excited about its reopening. I don't dislike this place, I just didn't enjoy the food or experience as much as I'd hoped. We dined here 2 weeks ago pretty close to it's opening, and here's our take:Sure it's loud on a Tues night at 8:30, real loud as others have mentioned, but I can deal with that. But it's also HOT. And by hot, I mean stripping off all possible winter layers and still sweating. Even our waitress was sweating something fierce. I feel terrible for the people working there. We mentioned the heat to her and she apologized saying she totally understood the discomfort. She propped open the front door to let in the freezing air (snowflakes that night) to cool down the place. She explained that it's not so bad in the front by the bar, but we were in the back where most of the tables were located. And speaking of those tables, they are crammed in there. We sat along the back left wall with tables to our right and left. The wall seating is one long booth bench, and there is less than 10 inches between your body on either side. Place had just opened and was packed, and space was very very tight.The food...The pita chip type things and dips they put on the table are nice. The tzatziki is especially yummy. My boyfriend had the mussels and really enjoyed them. I had the artichoke soup. It didn't rock my world, but it was good (except I did not like the crunchy chips on top....odd flavor). It's not something I'd specifically seek out to order again, but good.  It was a pretty small bowl and was $12. Way overpriced. We ordered the chicken and short rib entrees. The chicken was fair at best. It wasn't really bad but it was really small.  And by small I mean one small piece of nicely cooked chicken, 2 small pieces of dry chicken, 4 sauteed mushrooms, and maybe 3 carrots, and I tasted NO truffle. The plate looked like a sad face to me.  A small and delicious entree is fine. But small and fair and almost $30 plate? Eh. My boyfriend had the shortribs, a $40 dish. They were good. They were not even close to great, or anything more than just decent. We have had WAY better. We had 2 drinks each and decided to find desert elsewhere. 2 apps, 2 entrees, and 4 drinks none of which were above average was $200 after tax and tip. No thanks.I don't want this review to seem like I am complaining about the prices. We have no problem spending good money on good food. In fact, dining out and sharing nice meals is one of our favorite things to do, and we do it often. And I truly wish this place was better. Minus the heat the night we were there, the new interior of the establishment is beautiful and could be a great place to go for a date night. But the food is mediocre, its not just hot, but hot and loud, and it's expensive for the quality.",4,,

It must be stale. The same goes for the lamb French dip and their chicken sandwiches. But I must say that the ambiance is great, probably the best on Lexington in that area, so I'll keep returning. Maybe the salads are better.",,,
128,Kelly C.,"New York, NY",0,10,0,1.0,10/20/2015,"Incredibly expensive prices for food that was mediocre at best. I ordered the $24 roasted romanesco cauliflower which the server confirmed was an ""entree portion"" and what arrived was a large piece of burnt, fried cauliflower atop a coyingly sweet puree (which looked and tasted like baby food). My boyfriend ordered bass, which was bland and very oily. We had sides of pattypan squash and green beans, both of which were undercooked and covered in burnt garlic (which was the overwhelming flavor of both dishes). Will not be going back here!",2,,
129,Hayley B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,0,5.0,6/17/2015,Have been going to August since it was a tiny West Village favorite. Never disappointed. The chilled green bean salad is so simple and so perfect.,,,

131,Andrew B.,"Miami, FL",0,1,0,1.0,7/22/2015,Worst service I've ever had in my entire life. Food was mediocre and overpriced. Would not recommend It to anyone,1,,
132,Alain B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,7,0,1.0,7/11/2015,"Terrible service, ultra slow, unfriendly, understaffed. Very disappointed and won't ever try my chance again.",1,,
133,Mariana L.,"New York, NY",0,19,0,1.0,11/29/2015,"This restaurant is super overpriced for food that is below standard, out of season and undercooked. Service is slow, we had our starters before receiving cocktails. A totally underwhelming experience. I would not recommend it, and I will not return. Super overpriced too!",,,
134,Ermela K.,"Staten Island, NY",25,5,7,2.0,6/9/2015,"The food is over flavored and poor quality. They try too hard to be ""fancy"" but they fail, miserably. Too overpriced as well, to add to the poor dinning experience. Just what this neighborhood does not need.",1,,
135,Alexander M.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",1,4,0,1.0,3/29/2015,"One of the worst dinners, period. We had read the reviews and went because friends recommended this place. It just so happened that three days ago they changed the menu for spring, and something went really wrong here. The recommended green tomato appetizer came deep fried in a batter so even the slightest bit of tomato flavor was eliminated, the mussels weren't bad but so over salted that all we tasted after a while was salt, the sock eye salmon also recommended and ordered medium came deep fried through and through, the poor salmon dry like a bone, over a tasteless sth and topped with mushy green leaves that must have soaked in dressing for so long you couldn't even feel a crunch, and again so badly over salted that there was no chance of any sock eye salmon taste to be tasted. The risotto was tasteful but nothing to write home about and certainly nothing to come back for. This was one of the worst dinners ever, and unless they make some dramatic changes I cannot see how anybody could eat here.",1,,
136,A G.,"New York, NY",103,31,3,3.0,2/9/2015,Food was ok. Portions were small. Waiter talked us into apps and tried to upsell me on the $22/glass wine.  Not bad but nothing special and pricey for what you get.,1,,
137,lala l.,"New York, NY",0,123,1,4.0,5/12/2015,Service is a wee bit slow but that's ok because it's a nice leisurely place.  Food was excellent.  I will certainly be back for the burrata.,,,
138,Cd G.,"Manhattan, NY",0,18,0,3.0,8/29/2015,"The cantaloupe soup was excellent but the skirt steak with corn left a lot to be desired. Good flavor in the steak but very tough (ordered medium rare and was nicely pink/red center).  The presentation of the steak was nice - 3 pieces on a bed of corn but this corn concoction was sweet in a very odd way. I mentioned the toughness of the steak to the waiter and although he brought it to the chef's attention - he was right behind our table - no one came over or spoke of it again. It remained on my plate and no one asked if i wanted it wrapped to go...My partner had the red snapper (ordered as they were out of the monkfish) which was more tasty than the steak, but not really anything special.  The wine was good and not outrageously priced. Note the dinner menu on their website is not current as none of these dishes are listed there - better they rotate these entrees off the menu and try again!  Keep the soup please though.",,,
