0,Cameron L.,"Corona, NY",7,3,3,5.0,9/19/2018,"We had our wedding at George's/Kaufman in June and it was so amazing. First, John and Sarah, the managers, are so wonderful. They made the planning process a breeze. They answered every email and met with us when we would just show up to ask questions or see the spaces.When the studio decided to turn one of the event spaces that we were planning to use into a sound stage, John did everything to reassure me that the change wouldn't effect my day. It ended up being even better than our original plan. Jamie, the bar manager, is also so great! She created the most amazing signature drinks for us and is such a sweet person. Secondly, the food!!!!! When we went for our menu tasting we were blown away! EVERYTHING we tried was unbelievable. I'm a chef so this was an extremely important aspect of the day for me and was not disappointed. Unfortunately, on the day of we were running around so much that we didn't get to eat anything, but our guests are still raving about all of the food. Even my extremely picky and judgemental grandmother. They even accommodated my vegan cousin at cocktail hour and dinner. People are still telling us how this was the best wedding they've been to and how great everything was. I can't thank John, Sarah, Jamie, and the entire George's staff enough for making our day so special. I can't wait to throw another party there. Maybe a baby shower?",1,,
1,Chris F.,"New York, NY",67,107,138,3.0,9/30/2018,"Okay so my husband brought me here for my birthday dinner. It's been awhile since we've been here, the last time it was under the name Astor Room. Here's the tee:Highlights: Sophie who was the pianist for the night. She was lovely, talented, beautiful voice and very charming. We were the only people in the place and she bantered with us, even sang me happy birthday at one point. The other highlight was the cocktail - The Orange is the New Peach. It was so tasty i had two! The mid points: the service was lack luster and here's the thing; we were the ONLY table there. Idk if it was the servers first time but the reality is, we shouldn't have to flag down someone for the check when we're the only table. The desert was tasty - they served a creme brûlée with a candle in it for my birthday which was appreciated and tasty. It's listed as a lavender creme brûlée but we couldn't taste the lavender- but creme brûlée is yummy so we dig in. We also ordered the molten chocolate lava cake, which was a special for the day. That was yummy as well. Both were served with shaved chocolate and a salty white crumble, really not sure what it was but it did add a level of flavor to both desserts. The bad: the food, well appetizers and entrees. We had calamari for an appetizer, it was seriously greasy and over cooked. This is a go-to item for my husband and I as we both enjoy it. I only ate a few bites due to the way it was cooked. So damn greasy i was afraid of an upset stomach. I ordered a salmon special with a kale purée (see the photo) it was very pretty but the fish was flavorless, and mushy in the middle. Now i love sushi and enjoy salmon but this was like, slimy with a salty crust on top. It was just weird; i kept anticipating it to be frozen in the middle, but it wasn't. It was prepared with carrots and mushrooms which were basically raw, good thing i enjoy both. The purée was very salty but the dish needed it... all in all I wouldn't order this again. My husband ordered a meatball pasta special, he commented that the sauce was very tasty and the pasta was cooked well; however the compared the meatballs to IKEA meatballs. He kept mentioning how he thought they were frozen and just thawed for the dish. It was disappointing. Now keep in mind that there was some kind of private party in another room, the waiter mentioned this when he brought our food out, maybe that skewed our experience with the quality of food and service? Idk. I'm happy to try this place again, we love the atmosphere, drinks and music... just eat ahead of time before you got",,,
2,Brian G.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",155,390,30,5.0,8/22/2018,"I was looking for a fancy place to have a celebratory dinner after proposing, and found out about George's. I had seen the Astor Room signs around the neighborhood, so when I discovered Goerge's I learned about the whole history of this place. I made a reservation for kind of late, because I didn't know when everything was going to go down. I received a call early that afternoon, asking if there was any way I could move my reservation to earlier because my reservation was for 8:30 and the place closed at 9. I told them the situation and they replied with ""don't even worry about a thing, we will make sure you're taken care of. Good luck!""That was such a great thing to hear, and when we did arrive around 8:15, we were treated wonderfully. Seated right away, and served some delicious food. We started with the steak tartare, topped with a Scotch Egg instead of the traditional fried egg, which was excellent, and a couple of cocktails. We got the duck and the pork chop, both of which were wonderful.Maybe I'm biased because I don't go to places like this very often, but I found everything wonderful, and will be back for the next big occasion.",3,,1
3,Jin C.,"New York, NY",45,67,447,5.0,10/14/2018,"Came here after visiting the museum of moving image and so glad we happened to came across this gem. It was happy hours and we sat at the bar. I believe Sarah was our bartender and she was super attentive to everyone who sat down and I was quickly amazed how she made all the cocktails. We had a few glasses of Sauvignon Blanc with our half dozen oysters. They have this amazing honey peppery bacon that is made in house. We were not hungry but saw another party ordered a grill cheese sandwich which we knew we had to get as well and didn't even take a picture before digging right in. It was crispy and buttery with 5 different kind of amazing gooey cheese. While we were there, we witness a couple getting engaged, a big party was arriving and the live jazz band just starting for the evening dinner service.",,,
4,Diana B.,"New York, NY",82,56,199,1.0,7/10/2018,"Very limited selection on tap beer. Extremely poor service, never have I ever experienced such service. Lack of respect from staff. I do not recommend coming here. There are much better bars to stop by with friends to grab a beer and enjoy a game!",2,,
5,Tiffany P.,"Corona, NY",139,53,191,5.0,6/20/2018,Stumbled upon this outdoor bar in the heart of Astoria just yesterday and I am so excited to have found a new summer hangout! The bartender was super sweet and recommended two delicious pizzas and Moscow miles that were absolutely perfect for a hot NY day. I will definitely be going back and I highly recommend you stop by!,,,1
6,S. D.,"Oakland Gardens, NY",1,36,0,1.0,9/30/2018,"This is 1-star for the atmosphere which was ruined. I learned, after arriving on a saturday night, that there would be a 4-piece band. Well that's okay. But when we got there the band was amplified by microphones and it is a small room. Awful, too loud. The waiter couldn't hear me. We couldn't hear each other. We couldn't wait to leave. I won't rate the food because we wolfed it down just so we could leave.",,,
7,Brendon B.,"ASTORIA, NY",1,8,0,1.0,4/4/2018,"I used to love this place. They recently re-branded as ""George's."" They say it's in honor of George Kaufman who recently died, but they changed a lot more than that.1) The menu is very different. Almost completely revamped.2) The experience feels a little more ""upscale."" Which is fine, just a bit different of a vibe (not that it wasn't classy before).3) Prices have gone up. We're talking the cheapest beer they have is now $9.00 and it's all local stuff (I'd rather walk to the local breweries to save the $2 to $2 dollars).4) NO MORE HAPPY HOUR!Sad! They had one of the best happy hours around. To completely get rid of it is just depressing.I probably won't be back unless I read some great reviews.They probably were going to make these changes anyway, and are just pretending it's in George's honor. Kind of sad.",5,,
8,Sally B.,"Detroit, MI",32,197,1,5.0,6/3/2018,"Celebrating a friend's birthday, we had such a good time and a delicious dinner. The menu is varied and there's something for everyone. Our group tried the table side-made Caesar salad (with white anchovies... yum!), French onion soup, white chocolate cauliflower soup (yes, you read that correctly), steak tartare, six-foot long pasta, pork chops and (huge) T-bone steak. And dessert, of course... but lavender creme brûlée! The drinks are perfectly made (and big - - good thing we took the subway!). John, the host/chef, is inviting, funny and knowledgeable. George's is a bit off the beaten path, but well worth the trip. One note of caution... the live music is loud!",,,
9,Amanda F.,"Glendale, NY",55,8,0,1.0,8/29/2018,Atmosphere was tacky and the maître d'/manager guy was a major creep. Food was pretty average especially considering the prices. The service was nothing to write home about. Drinks were overcharged even for craft.,,,
10,Asuka K.,"Huntington Station, NY",14,7,9,3.0,3/25/2018,"Nice place, we came during brunch. We had reservations and were seated right away.  We were given our waters and asked what we wanted for brunch. They slacked on giving our refills on water and drinks (we did the unlimited drinks) so we always had to ask for it.  No one asked how we were doing. I got the country fried steak and regretted it. Another friend also got it and said it was dry. I got to try the regular steak and that was good. There was a lady playing piano and singing which was nice. We asked her to play britney and she played a pretty melody of Britney songs.",1,,
11,Christopher W.,"Bronx, NY",0,13,0,5.0,5/28/2018,"Fantastic brunch! Lovely hostess, excellent and diligent service, and you can't beat the deal! $35 for a starter and meal, unlimited mimosas or bloody Mary's, and coffee.Would definitely recommend!",,,
12,Raymond W.,"New York, NY",101,4,0,5.0,5/7/2018,"I can never say enough good things about this place. Good food, good drinks, phenomenal staff! Planning on having our wedding here soon, and John has been with us every step of the way, going above and beyond every expectation. Go for brunch and enjoy the piano and vocals of Morgan Riley!",,,
13,Luis R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",141,6,0,4.0,4/1/2018,The service was warm and genuine. The staff looked like they slept well. The food was magnificent. I didn't know rice could taste that good and the oysters paired well with the beer. I have 2 suggestions. 1.) employ a quite policy. People kept running their mouths and taking video with flash. It was annoying as hell. 2.) the rhythm section needed to come way down in the mix. Vincent Herring could use dynamics or if he did it was impossible to tell.,,,
14,Billy P.,"Madison, AL",0,137,103,5.0,4/13/2018,Great relaxing atmosphere.  Live soft music playing oldies.  Very friendly and engaging staff.  I would eat hear again.  Very nice place to take a special someone.,,,
