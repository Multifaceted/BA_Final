0,Ronni S.,"Whitehouse Station, NJ",0,82,19,5.0,10/16/2018,"This is a great wine bar (with a few beers). Nice ambience and Patrick, the bartender, was excellent. He gave us some good recommendations on wines to try. Overall, I'd highly recommend checking out this place with friends or a date.",,,
1,Caroline H.,"Manhattan, NY",181,153,145,4.0,12/5/2017,I like the vibe here - and the wine!  The bartender recommended a great chardonnay.  Seems like a good date spot.  I wish I'd discovered Vanguard sooner!,,,
2,Zehra M.,"New York, NY",138,98,157,4.0,4/8/2018,Incredibly classy wine bar on the UWS. My friends and I were looking for a place for a drink after seeing a ballet performance at the Lincoln Center - this place was perfect. We got a bottle of wine with some tartines and they were delicious.,,,
3,Miranda L.,"New York, NY",26,2,0,5.0,10/2/2018,I have lived in the area for the last few years and have regularly come to the bar and brought numerous coworkers and friends for drinks. I work at Lincoln Center and have often referred friends and patrons to this location. It is so nice to see the same faces behind the bar from week to week! I know that regardless of when I drop by I will have a warm and knowledgeable person to interact with and send me in the right direction in regard to wine selections. I am thrilled to have this spot in the neighborhood. Isabel and Jim are total highlights!! Isabel always knows what to suggest that I will absolutely love.,,,
4,Jonathan A.,"New York, NY",0,34,5,4.0,8/19/2018,I love this little gem. Decent wine selection. Great finger foods. Quiet atmosphere. Good service.,,,
5,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1049,242,3.0,1/21/2017,"I like this wine bar. It's classy, quiet, and chill for a date or for classy friends hanging out. You can sit at the bar, at tables, on cushiony booth type seats. I also really enjoyed the combo meat and cheese plate; there are two small loaves of warm baguette and about four different kinds of cheeses (Parmesan, Brie, blue, and maybe Roquefort?) and about six different kinds of meats with mustard and apricot jelly.I will give you a warning though: if you sit at the bar and the seductive blonde bartender offers you olives oh-so-casually, know that they aren't complimentary - they set you back a cool $7 - and I don't even like olives. I hate them. So yeah. Don't get scammed like I did.",1,2,
6,Alex A.,"New York, NY",2,20,0,1.0,7/12/2018,"I wish this was a better wine bar...this neighborhood can definitely use one. They do carry a nice Sanserre but unfortunately their food sucks. The pita chips are greasy, thick and too salty. The hummus looks as if it wasn't blended enough and someone forgot to use spices. The flatbreads are tiny squares of saltine crackers (maybe a little thicker) with shredded cheese on it. It crumbled when I bit into it. Did I mention they don't have table service? So if you want to order your food or a drink you have to leave your table and go to the bar which I wouldn't mind if the bartenders had better attitudes. If your thinking of going here, don't.",,,
7,Tara S.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",62,303,270,4.0,5/3/2017,"Located a few blocks from my workplace. My volunteer group had chosen this as our meeting location. I was skeptical but happy due to the distance to my workplace lol. The staff were friendly. It's it a wine bar. Cheese and wine - don't expect much more. For what they do they are a solid choice. The one bathroom alone impressed me with the decor. Great selection of wine with different price ranges. I saw a happy hour sign for $30 bottles(not sure which ones). Solid, chic and chill wine spot.",1,,
8,Tom M.,"New York, NY",13,53,15,4.0,7/25/2017,I really like so much about this place.Very good wine and always a few good happy hour specials including entire bottles of wine.Excellent little tartines and toasts as well. The quality is definitely a step up.Also very nice décor and very cool how they always have classic old movies playing.Well done!,,,
9,Logan J.,"Boston, MA",156,313,424,5.0,3/20/2015,"This place is an amazing hidden gem.  I came here one night with a friend after we exhausted the area looking for a place to grab a glass of wine.  There are tons of other local spots to grab a glass of wine, but we wanted to go somewhere that wasn't too loud to catch up.  Neither of us had been to this place, but based on reviews, we thought it sounded like what we were looking for, and we were so happy we tried it!The space is perfectly arranged with a large wraparound bar in the middle, small tables when you walk in, and larger tables off to both sides of the bar.  They have added a lot of cool touches to the space and decor to add to atmosphere like vintage posters on the walls.  Unlike some other places in the area, it didn't seem pretentious at all; it was a great casual place to meet a friend.We ended up getting a few small plates and glasses of wine.  The small plates are a perfect size for a snack, and the prices for wine were reasonable (most were $11-13).  We were completely happy with our decision to come here and will hopefully be making it a regular spot to return to!",2,,
10,Nick G.,"South Pointe, FL",111,21,2,4.0,10/1/2017,Guys please update the hours. On Sundays they work only until midnight. Not until 2.00am as it's said on here.,,,
11,Ashley A.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,24,0,4.0,4/29/2018,Nice and usually quiet wine bar. They have a good selection of wines and few small plate food options-would highly recommend the goat cheese flatbread. My only complaint is that you have to get up and order at the bar. But overall it's a very cute place and I will definitely be coming back!,,,
12,Taylor G.,"New York, NY",299,106,37,2.0,12/21/2016,"I went here with high expectations on a chilly night, and though the wine selection was great, I found service to be slow, and our waitress/bartender were rude.

13,Leslie C.,"Aptos, CA",51,26,0,5.0,5/15/2017,"Comfortable, low-key and friendly wine bar! Sat and chatted at the bar; bartender Maarine had some terrific wine recommendations and we will definitely come back when next in the neighborhood!",1,,
14,Emily F.,"San Francisco, CA",198,64,15,5.0,12/9/2014,"An ideal date spot with a unique menu and wonderful service. I came here for a date on a Friday night and the place was far emptier than I expected. The vibe is intimate, but more laid back than other wine bars I have been to in the city (a good thing). You order at the bar and the bartender brought our bottle to us and made several great recommendations in terms of what we should drink next and which food items would work best for the two of us to share. We are looking forward to coming back!",2,,
15,Denise F.,"Los Angeles, CA",76,123,17,3.0,11/15/2015,"Fun decor and perfect layout for groups, dates or just dinner.  The space has a long bar and moderately priced cocktails for the area. Unfortunately during my last visit we had an incredibly grumpy bartendar, but! Dont let that deter you from this great neughborhood bar.",2,,
16,Alexa S.,"New York, NY",738,187,194,5.0,12/2/2015,"I went to Vanguard Wine Bar one night with a friend and loved it! It's a cute little spot that's kind of hidden. I had passed it many times until I finally decided that I wanted to try it out. I went on a rainy Saturday night and it was a little busier than I thought it would be. The bartender was really sweet and helped me and my friend pick out the right wine. I ended up going with the Barrymore, to my surprise this wine is actually made by Drew Barrymore and it was quite delicious. We didn't try any of the appetizers, but they looked great! As soon as I walked in, I immediately thought this would be the perfect date spot. it's cute and cozy and a great atmosphere to have a great conversation! Looking forward to visiting again.",1,1,
17,Dave F.,"Hoboken, NJ",417,624,1367,4.0,5/19/2013,"On the TV above the bar they had Midnight in Paris playing. So fitting... When you walk into the bar you feel like you are transported back to the 1940's in Paris from the music to the subway tiles on the wall. It is both romantic and lively, in a mature sort of way that doesn't exist anywhere else in Gramercy. They have a nice wine selection with glasses around $10 and bottles in the $40 range. If you need a great post date spot for a drink and are tying to impress your date, come here.",,,
18,Elle D.,"Manhattan, NY",84,130,23,4.0,3/31/2014,"Met up with an old friend here and had a wonderful time! The noise level is reasonable for having a conversation, and there are plenty tables and bar seating to accommodate its mid-week crowd.  The bar tender was very knowledgeable and friendly. She made several great suggestions. I just wish they had a happy hour so I could try more of their wines! The meat and cheese platter was also delicious, with a nice selection of cheeses. I would absolutely recommend this place for a casual get together or a first-date!",1,,
19,Ali C.,"New York, NY",91,414,2,4.0,4/2/2015,"Cool spot in an area I wouldn't necessarily consider ""cool."" It's in no man's area of Murray Hill (meaning 30th and 2nd). It kind of popped up out of nowhere on the street!  I was meeting someone at 7 and usually, wine bars attract a pretty big crowd by then. To my surprise, there were ample tables and even a few bar seats left! A few glasses of wine later, we were chatting it up with Isabelle the bartender who was AWESOME. The crowd was an older crowd, older meaning near 30 and over which is a-ok with me. My one complaint would probably be the food. It's not really event a complaint. It was good, not great. I got the mushroom, ricotta and truffle flatbread. It was SUPER small and the flatbread was more like a cracker. Either way, I'd absolutely be back!",2,,1
20,Christine L.,"West Palm Beach, FL",447,584,714,5.0,10/25/2013,"I've walked past this place a million times because I live right next door - and although I've peeked into the window a bunch, the inside is not what I expected from looking in from the outside.  It's very intimate inside and has a neighborhood feel.  Great bar seating and also high tops that are like little coves with pillows.  It was a perfect date spot for me.  When they're not busy the bartender will come around to the tables, but for the most part you order up front at the bar (both drinks and food).  I'd come here again - likely when they are serving their $30 bottles.",1,,
21,Tara S.,"Providence, RI",0,13,0,5.0,1/21/2017,"This wine bar is the best kept secret in murray hill! Great wine and small plates and the atmosphere is awesome, felt like I could be in Paris...can't wait to come back!",1,,1
22,Michael O.,"Manhattan, NY",199,13,8,5.0,5/24/2016,Best first date/date spot in nyc. Big bar to sit at incase you don't like the awkwardness of sitting at a table(although they have that too) oldies playing on the tv (but my type of oldies like casino or goodfellas)and light classic jazz music in the background. Not much more you can ask for. The apps are pretty damn good too.,1,,
23,E V.,"San Dimas, CA",0,20,5,5.0,9/24/2016,"Visiting New York from California. Stopped into Vanguard for some wine. Great ambiance and great wine. Kurt was behind the bar pouring the wine .. He knows his stuff and he was great .  They have small plates to go with your wine . The hummus and charcuterie plates are perfect pairing with the wines. Great wine selection, great atmosphere and great service. We will be back next time we visit New York and hope Kurt is behind the bar!",,,
24,Leilani L.,"New York, NY",24,88,38,4.0,2/15/2015,"The only reason why I took off a star is because there is no happy hour.

25,Julia V.,"Manhattan, NY",356,143,74,4.0,1/5/2015,"I haven't tried the food here, but the wine list is amazing. It has great varieties of everything from bubbly to red, and I was personally surprised of their variety of Old World wines (especially the GSM blend, which I highly recommend.) The ambience is dim lit and romantic, with vintage posters all over the walls and an old movie playing in the background. I especially love it as a stopover after a movie in the movie theatre next door.The bartender there is also very friendly, letting us sample wines that we have never tried before. Glasses range from $10 to $17, so it can be pricey. However, it is a very non-pretentious and enjoyable post-date location overall.",1,,1
26,Andrew B.,"New York, NY",2,66,3,5.0,11/10/2015,"The Vanguard wine bar is a place you go to explore quality wines at reasonable prices.  The head bartender, Isabel, is knowledgeable about everything they have and can match a wine to your palette just by asking a few questions.  Other wine bars tend towards popular labels, often serving unbalanced, highly acidic, or immature wines.  Vanguard, on the other hand, has a robust selection of French and American wines that range from the familiar (California Merlot) to the bold (Bordeaux Medoc) the pleasantly surprising (Upstate NY Riesling).  The menu also offers a nice selection of flatbreads, salads, and other snack which you can enjoy with whatever wine Isabel picks out for you.",2,,

28,Flo K.,"Downtown Ann Arbor, Detroit, MI",1,6,0,5.0,7/6/2015,"I love this wine bar. Definitely the best place to have aperitif in the neighborhood. Never overcrowded, lovely ambiance with old movies playing on the tv, a fantastic wine selection and knowledgeable staff. I'm still dreaming of the $10 Pinot blanc from Alsace!

29,Cyrus P.,"New York, NY",841,876,530,3.0,1/21/2013,"Someone else said on one of their reviews here: ""Wine bar for beginners"", and I think I would have to agree some. Let me start off with my rating.  I gave Vanguard Wine Bar 3 stars when I could have easily given them 2 and I would like to have given them 5. Firstly, this place is beautifully made.  The ambiance is as top notch, if not better, than any of the other wine bars in the city.  The decor, the marble counter, the symmetry everywhere, and the touches of retro and classic feels everywhere.  The fact that they were playing black and white films on the center screen behind the bar also added a major plus, and the music selections are on point, which means that they were carefully curated for the ambiance.  The speakers are well placed and almost hidden so you can't see them, which I love.  Almost all the fine details of the physical and sonic aesthetics of Vanguard were very well handled. Now we get to the cons.  The wine selections seem to have no real meaning.  It's almost as if they chose some of whatever list the distributor gave them.  The price points are a little high for the area and for the actual wine selections.  The food being cooked sometimes lets off unpleasant aromas into the entire place which can be a real turn off.  The bartenders, as my lady friend mentioned, did not fit the look and feel of the place.  Vanguard could be great, it could be chic and fashionably, and it could easily be ""Thee Winebar"" to go to in NYC, but it falls short on some of the very details that matter the most.  Overall, it's a beautiful place to check out, the lighting is perfect, the music soooo good, and the vibe is nice, so give it a try for sure.  I was pleasantly surprised to see such a place in this neighborhood.",3,,
30,Grant C.,"New York, NY",94,451,206,3.0,1/6/2013,"Nice looking place, and nice guys working here, but I felt like it is kind of a wine bar for beginners. If you don't know much about wine the menu is arranged into categories, something like ""big and bold"" or ""fruity."" I tried a few of the reds and wasn't too impressed with any of them; did better with the whites. Still, a nice addition to this sad stretch of dive bars. I'll be back to see how it comes along.P.S.: Sad to see the number of shill reviews that have posted since my visit here.",3,,
31,Laurent B.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",2,7,1,1.0,11/21/2014,"Why treating customers like shit as if they are responsible for wanting to leave after waiting 1 hour for a cheese plate!?I have come to this place a couple of time. Usually it's fine, not wonderful but ok and close to my place. Tonight I came after having a cocktail in another bar. I wanted some wine and food (it was 8:30pm). We arrived, seated on our own and ordered a glass of wine, a cheese plate and a flat bread.we waited an hour drinking our wine but as you can imagine after an hour, we were hungry! We were sitting in front of the cook so we knew what he was doing. Didn't know when our order would even start I asked the waitress that seems to be the owner the check saying its been too long. She was pissed even though the cook had not even start our food (and we knew it) and left the check without saying a word. ""Sorry we were busy"" would have been enough (we saw the poor cook on its own doing his best but when its crowded it's crowded...). No she just considered us as shit because I asked the check for what we got served AND they hadn't even started the food for us... And btw, a cheese plate do not take that long to prepare...I came a few time before and of course the owner wasn't the very best welcomer but damn, are customer just nothing that you don't even apologies when things go wrong because of you!?!Food looked good but never tasted. Cheese plate pricey for what they serve. Wine ok but expensive for what it is.Avoid this place and her, that's probably for the best!",3,,
32,Christine S.,"Manhattan, NY",46,165,2,4.0,3/28/2013,"Some people on here have called this a wine bar for beginners, but really, who cares.   Wine snobs can go flock somewhere else if you don't like it. Leave it for the rest of us who just want to enjoy some good wine with some good company. I've been to Vanguard 3 times, and with each time, I like it even more. It's quaint with a warm interior filled with vintage decorations and they even play old movies on a screen behind the bar. And don't even get me started on the bathroom. Probably the NICEST bar bathroom I've ever been in. Don't believe me? Give it a go. They have a decent amount of wines and some small plates, too. I've heard the food is fantastic, but I can't vouch for it personally because I haven't tried it yet. I do, however, like the wine. And from the looks of it, everyone else in the place likes the wine, too.The staff is really helpful and extremely nice. They even dress the ""vintage"" part. Really seals the deal on the time era they are trying to go for. The prices are pretty average as far as glasses of wine go in the city.I'll definitely be coming back here soon for an after-work drink..or three.",1,,1

36,Will W.,"Manhattan, NY",221,13,0,5.0,1/25/2015,"I love finding the smaller bars that I have a quiet and sophisticated theme to them. This bar is one of those. The ambiance is not too loud, but not so quiet that you have to speak in whispered voices. The wine menu is designed for the casual drinker (separated by how it sits in the mouth rather than type), but a great variety to keep an experienced drinker entertained. The little bites are perfect; don't expect to fill up on the food here.Great date spot, and a great place to go when you don't expect to be out drinking too late.",1,,

38,Rita M.,"New York, NY",3,47,1,5.0,5/11/2013,"My favorite place in the area to relax and unwind after a day's work, or just on the weekend when I feel like grabbing a drink with someone near my place and catching up. Beautiful, beautiful interior (even the bathroom is gorgeous -- how many bars can say that?!) and solid wine and food, every time. Unlike some of the other reviews, I happen to think the wine selection here is interesting and sophisticated, and at a decent price. Now, I wouldn't call myself a snob or a connoisseur (I might hate myself if I did), but I've tried some really good stuff here, and have never been disappointed by the selections or suggestions by the staff. Even though this is a wine bar though, I think I come just as much for the food. The tartines they have are SO good, and not expensive for what you get. Try the white bean and kale one.... oh man I wish I had some of that right now. The charcuterie and cheese plate is expensive, but worth it if you're in the mood to splurge. It's sinful. Best bar in the area, in my opinion. Oh, and the music is also amazing. Perfect for a date or low-key evening with anyone.",,1,

It was not too crowded or too empty, the lights are dim and the conversation just the right volume. Ordered a bottle of Syrah, caviar trio, and cheese plate. Now we are half drunk. The TV was playing Amelie, which is my favorite movie. The caviar trio was much smaller than I expected, but the cheese plate was good portioned. None of the foods were too advanced, just basic and ok. What made me like this place is not the food, but the just right atmosphere, the friendly bartenders, and the nice wine. They don't have too extensive a collection on wine, but got most of the basics and I agree it is more of a beginner wine bar. Will I come back? Maybe. If I happen to be in the area and want to stay in somewhere pleasant and quiet.",,,

We asks lots of questions and I was pleased with their recommendations.The food is quite good as well. Try the white bean hummus. Surprisingly delicious for hummus!

53,Mikka S.,"Millburn, NJ",0,14,0,5.0,4/28/2014,"A lovely place with a modest, unpretentious menu.  Caviar and Chenin Blanc ... yes.  Isabel is a beauty as well!",1,,1
54,Said D.,"Manhattan, NY",0,31,0,5.0,2/2/2015,Love everything about this place. The decor is perfect. Wine list is interesting and unique. The teeny tiny kitchen shells out excellent small plates that work well for groups or just a snack between glasses...or bottles of wine. Just go. It's perfect. And bonus is no frat kiddos from the neighborhood.,,,
55,Kale H.,"Manhattan, NY",264,75,9,5.0,11/19/2014,"Every time we pass by this bar my boyfriend always has to point at it and say, ""Look, your favourite wine bar!"" I've only been here once, but it was love at first sight. We came on a Sunday night after a movie and the vibe was absolutely perfect. Dimly lit, just the way I like it, and so, so chill. No one was really there except four other couples, so it was quiet. The decor makes everything feel so homey! The bartender seemed out of place because she was just too chill and was in very casual clothing, but I honestly liked it because I didn't feel the need to sound or look better just because I was in a wine bar, unlike other wine bars I go to. She let us taste the wine we chose and waited for our approval before giving us a glass. We ordered some meats and cheeses which were delicious but quite pricey compared to other places I've been to. Nevertheless, I cannot wait for another chance to come again. Gorgeous place, and not pretentious at all.",,,
56,Susan A.,"Hoboken, NJ",2,85,0,3.0,12/16/2014,"The good news: beautiful space, lighting, and noise level.  We ordered the meat and cheese platter that was very good and reasonably priced.  There was a good choice of small plates to choice from also.  An interesting wine list but maybe I caught the bartender on a bad day for the service.  From the description of the wines the one I liked the best was $17 dollars.  A bit much.  I asked the bartender if she could recommend a similar wine but not at that cost.  When the bill arrived it was $16.00 a glass.  Really?  I would have left a better tip if she was more thoughtful.  This type of service turns me off on returning.",,,
57,Lauren H.,"New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,2/2/2013,"I went to Vanguard last night (Friday) with a friend of mine after work and we had a great time. We were early enough to get a seat at the bar and we got to talk with the knowledgeable and attentive bartender Kyle. I particularly liked how how the layout of the wine menu is made into taste categories as i don't know my wine regions very well but I do know what I like to drink! We had some food too and we particularly loved the hummus and the sauteed kale, roasted garlic and ricotta tartine, so delicious!The Decor is beautifully done along with the lighting which sets the mood perfectly, it's a great place to relax with friends and an excellent date spot too.I would highly recommend this wine bar to anyone wanting to enjoy a night out with a glass of wine (or two!) in a great environment with excellent service. We traveled down from the UES just to try it out and would do it again in a heartbeat! Planning our next trip already!",,,
58,Marytere B.,"Manhattan, NY",8,6,0,5.0,1/14/2013,"Neighborhood Gem!This place is like an oasis in the desert! After blocks of nothing you find this beautiful wine bar. My mouth waters just thinking about their small plates. They have amazing open-faced tapas. The bread/toast is perfect and it is topped with different delicious selections. The shrimp and the mushroom ones are must-haves! Literally, the best shrimp I've ever had.  Unfortunately, they were the only plates I had. I can't wait to try more food and wine off their innovative menu. Love the creative way the wine is presented! It makes ordering a wine I've never heard of easy because the categories and descriptions tell me exactly what I want to know. The menu was my sommelier that night!  This place is the perfect date spot but somehow it is also the perfect girls night out spot.  Oh, and the service was exceptional-Impressive considering they had been open about a week when I went.",4,,
59,Magdilena L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,5.0,1/14/2013,I live in the neighborhood (Kip's Bay) and visited this place last week with my boyfriend before going to a movie. We had such a good time that we came back over the weekend with friends. The service was attentive and the menu choices/prices were great! This is exactly what we need in this neighborhood.,2,,
60,Shitake B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,1,0,2.0,1/9/2013,"If this place is to survive and thrive they need to resolve a couple of things. First, if you are going to charge $13 for a glass of Beaulieu or Bonnaventure please have it served in a proper wine glass and please please give the customer the proper pour. The Bar tender and Management need to reevaluate the profit margins in a bottle of wine and understand that if you want repeat business the customer needs to feel that they are being served the proper amount. If not, this place will find it's 12 year lease an albatross. If you are looking for a place that will leave you thirsty and hungry, this is the place. Very disappointing considering that this would be a great neighborhood find. Would love to return, great looking place. I hope they improve the menu and correct its pours.",1,2,
61,Serg M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,31,0,5.0,5/29/2014,Such a sexy place. Nice cozy place with pillows at your table. Perfectly lit and great wine selection. Their small plates menu is good too. Great place for a date,,,
62,Daniel O.,"Annapolis, MD",3,90,1,3.0,9/14/2013,"The atmosphere, wine, and food were all good, but the prices are high and the portions are tiny. A good place for a quick drink, but not if you're hungry. Unless the prices fall or the portions expand, I wouldn't go back.",,,
63,Nellie P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,1/14/2013,"Love, love, love this place!! First, its absolutely gorgeous and you feel immediately ""at home"" upon entering. Second, the wine list is amazing and very easy to follow. Third, the staff is wonderful, very friendly and very knowledgeable. I will definitely be going back VERY soon. Thanks for adding this gem to an otherwise lackluster area!",1,,
64,Sarah D.,"Brooklyn, NY",49,8,0,5.0,1/14/2013,"Vanguard Wine Bar is an amazing addition to the Kip's Bay neighborhood.  Whether you are heading to a movie and need a snack and a wine, having drinks with friends or having a romantic evening with your significant other, this is the place to do it!  The wine list is very well thought out and the choices are fun and interesting. The pricing is outstanding and the ambiance is stunning.  The staff is warm and friendly and the food by Soa Davies is delicious and perfectly portioned and pairs wonderfully with the list.  I can't wait to go back!  Cheers to the owner for doing a fantastic job!!!",1,,
65,Beth C.,"Manhattan, NY",0,8,0,2.0,1/26/2013,Went last night.  Great vibe but agree with other review that the  pour is light when you order by the glass.   $12.00 for a quarter glass of wine is unacceptable.,,,
66,Jill W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,14,1,2.0,7/25/2014,good spot but wish bartenders looked at customers,,,
