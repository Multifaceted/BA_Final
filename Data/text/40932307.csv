2,Tim K.,"Brandon, Tampa Bay, FL",141,397,694,4.0,1/14/2018,"Hopping pub in the West Village.Incredibly active and happening little pub.  Plenty of draft, wine & mixed drink options to be had here.  Bar is shaped kind of like a peninsula, and service was pretty good.  A Guinness draft was $8 - little pricey, even for New York.This place has a full menu including appetizers like wings and nachos.  They had what appeared to be a back room which you could have private parties in.  They had door staff checking IDs, even ours.Heavy college presence so not your place if you don't want to deal with that kind of raucous party and shenanigans.",2,1,2

Updated review","A 20-something bar all the way! The bar is dirty. Music is good - classics. Drinks are par and at least one of the bartenders was drunk tonight (mid-way through the night). The cow bell within the bar is less than desirable, but even more, a bartender (balled head) randomly poured Jäger into my beer glass. I asked him to replace it, but he was clearly more into the conversation (unrelated to bartending) with my friend than assisting a patron. The second star is for a female bartender who was kind throughout the night and replaced my tainted beer with a partial glass. As a former cocktail server in soho and midtown, how the first bartender reacted was completely unprofessional. I will not return and anyone with morale shouldn't.",,,

5,Alison C.,"Hoboken, NJ",1096,1400,635,3.0,10/24/2017,"When my colleagues decided to hold a team happy hour at Fiddlesticks Pub, I was not entirely aware of the space and did not know what to expect.  Of the few people that had been there in the past, they all agreed that the bar was typically crowded and full of young patrons...like fresh out of college young.  However, when we arrived around 5:45 pm on a Thursday, the place was mostly empty, and the few customers that were there were actually professionals in their 30's.  The restaurant was huge, with a giant bar in the center of the main room and several smaller areas on all sides, actually making it the perfect choice for our team event.  Once our dedicated server got comfortable with the size of our group, he was on top of his game, effectively keeping drinks in our hands at all times.  Speaking of beverages, the cocktail options sounded creative, but I stuck with my favorite Deep Eddy Ruby Red Grapefruit Vodka and Club Soda.  My colleagues ordered the Nachos with the Works, which had an enhanced topping list including Pulled Chicken, Beef Chili, and Guacamole.  Wowza!  These were the best nachos I had ever had!  The chili was extremely saucy, chunky, and flavorful, and the bounty of peppers added some crunchy spice.  My only critique would be that we needed more chips to sop up all of the gooey toppings.  I also heard that the Chicken Fingers were delicious, though I did not try them.  Fiddlesticks Pub was more of a 3.5-star restaurant for its food and service; but the casual pub was still more of a neighborhood dive bar than an awe-inspiring destination.",1,,1

9,Raphael S.,"New York, NY",1,4,0,1.0,1/11/2018,"This pub is lacking in all of the most important categories. The drinks are watery, the crowd is unimpressive, and most of all, the bouncer is supercilious. They have a haughty air towards guests. If there's anything my grandfather taught me, it's that the customer is always right. It is blatantly evident, that the employees at Fiddlesticks do not abide by this mantra. One star.",,1,

12,Bill S.,"Long Island, NY",638,2402,4794,3.0,6/6/2015,"A divey bar in the heart of the west village. I love it!Fiddlesticks is a dark pub with a bar that's tilted?? This place was probably here for 100+ years. Its very dark inside and the floors, man... You need to be aware of your surroundings. There are dark steps in a few spots that aren't standard heights. Going to the bathroom is not recommended after a few drinks. There are steps involved, be careful!There are tables for outside dining, I'm not a fan of that in NYC. It's a crowded sidewalk, get away from me suckas!Inside the pub is decorated with old items from New York City. Horse saddles, shoe shine chairs and old bar mirrors. Its an hodge podge of items hanging around.There is a back room where we stayed, drank and mostly hung out as well as smoking a few stogies outside. Fiddlesticks, nice old place to drink a beer on tap. Can someone explain the tilted bar?",5,4,4
13,Priyeta K.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",197,70,24,2.0,3/18/2016,"This place was your average bar, pretty big and gets packed with a younger crowd. If you're looking for a place to dance in the area, it's a decent place to come. Would have given it three stars instead of two, but the rude bartenders knocked down their rating. They have a free house shot check in deal for Yelp, but the two bartenders my friend and I asked were very unwelcoming about it and acted like it wasn't a thing, adding a comment about tipping them if we got it, even though my friend purchased another drink along with it. Don't have a deal if you're not going to honor it! We got the shots, but probably won't be coming back.",2,1,2
14,Heather V.,"Bridgewater, NJ",83,193,23,2.0,3/17/2016,"Extremely disappointed with fiddlesticks because of the service. The bartenders were so extremely rude. One drunk bartender commented on a blemish on my face before serving me my drink. Are you kidding me ? They offer a free shot when you checkin on Yelp but none of the bartenders recognized this deal and were not friendly to provide the shot. The atmosphere was fun, with a young crowd and good top 40 music. But the service was so unwelcoming I don't know if I would return.",2,1,1
15,Logan J.,"Boston, MA",156,313,424,4.0,3/6/2015,"Yeah, yeah, this place is kind of a dive...so what.  I came here one night before heading out to a few other places with friends.  We ordered a few drinks for their happy hour ($5 well drinks, beers, and house wine) and appetizers, and ended up having a pretty good time.The place itself isn't too much to write home about.  It's a casual spot with where the staff puts on a fake brogue.  The venue is large, and is a good place for groups, especially if you're starting out the night here.  I read in other reviews that this place gets crowded on the weekends, but early in the night or on weeknights, this place has plenty of room to spread out.  They have a pool table in the back too, which is a plus.The food was shockingly good for a random pub.  We ordered the spinach dip and sweet potato fries, and I would eat both of them again in a heartbeat.  The dip was warm and creamy, and fries were perfectly crispy--just what we needed on a cold, winter night.  I was impressed, and I'd like to think that the other items on the menu are just as good.This place was a surprisingly nice stop on a random night with friends, and I'd definitely stop by again.",2,,

Also some outdoor seating for people watching on Greenwich ;) it always makes for an interesting afternoon. I've never eaten here but I am sure some people do:)If you are looking for a major scene, this is not the place for you !

It took 40 mins for them to serve me my food. They never offered to take something off the bill (which I'm not asking for)  but they never even apologized or even asked to get me something while I/my family waited. Very poor hospitality.

I've been here a bunch of times, usually just for happy hour or drinks on the outdoor patio, but last night I got the Fiddlesticks Salad and it was REALLY good. For $11 you get a massive salad with avocados, feta, tomatoes, and a bunch of other stuff thrown in. **Maybe get dressing on the side if you like yours lightly dressed, however, they are pretty generous with the dressing.Sometimes service is better than others. Waitstaff is usually good and you always have someone watching your table to make sure you're all doing ok.They put out sunscreen SPF 50 on the patio when its sunny out for customers to use so they don't get burnt - how cute and thoughtful is that?!",3,,2

Three cocktails, which were made to perfection, plus my food, came out to less than $35 before tip!Definitely check this place out.

The music is loud so you have to yell a bit to hear the people you're with. I think the bartenders would be great if there weren't always so many people to attend to. It's difficult to get their attention but not really their fault.Overall a good bar if you want to dance, get a bit wild, and take advantage of a free shot for checking in on yelp.",1,,

All I wanted to do was close out my tab and he screamed in my face that I needed to wait (which I was) and then continued to scream at my boyfriend who was upset this guy was yelling at me. Everyone around me was embarrassed for this guy who was clearly making a fool of himself yelling at me. If you can't handle bartending a busy bar on a Friday night...

She'll sit and watch them work and openly criticize whatever they are doing.

Also the bartenders here are pretty responsive and reliable, so that mixed with a fairly attractive albeit sloppy crowd, it's always a good and drunken time at Fiddlesticks. While it can get unbelievably crowded, you can usually always find some space at the side tables near the street seating. It's also usually a good idea to order from the waitress if you don't have cash, because closing a tab at the bar is incredibly difficult, due to the crowds. My only gripe is that I think the prices should be a little better given the college-aged crowds.My friends and I usually head here after Greenwich Treehouse to liven things up, since Fiddlesticks usually has a more active crowd. People do rag on how crowded and sweaty it is, and while not unwarranted, it's not a bad place to be if you're a person who's trying to meet new people, which is the case 50% of the time, right? For now, I'll enjoy it for what it is. Maybe just let me enjoy a Bud Light for less than 7 bucks. C'mon son.",1,3,

There were a group of people who wanted to play pool, but ended up just taking seductive photos ON the pool table? Needless to say, they kindly gave us back the table as I think they were a bit too tipsy to play.Drinks: Normal bar drinks, but they did have a drink with St. Germain and Elderflower, and any drink with those two guys and you had me at hello.

I personally like it here, it's low key and we always have a good time. Plus, they have good spinach & artichoke dip which i always find myself ordering after 4+ beers.

Lol.  This was up my alley scene-wise.  The crowd was young, laid back yet lively, friendly, fun... I like the lights hung around the bar.... Creates a nice, laid back ambiance. The decors dated, for sure... but who cares, it's a chill place.  Not a place to go and ""be seen"".   I'll make sure to return next time I'm in the village!",2,1,1
54,Babs D.,"New York, NY",0,9,0,1.0,11/6/2014,"Hmm how can I describe my fiddlesticks experience? My first time there I absolutely hated it and left within 5 minutes.  However, I was in the area last night and thought to give it another go after all it was a Wednesday night-it shouldn't be plagued with recent graduates making out and spilling beer down each other's shirts.So I walk in and like honestly decent crowd. Cheap drinks and friendly little Irish bartender.A couple of drinks in, our bartender changes to this tall man named Jimmy. It's so funny, because he seemed nice and smiley. Introduced himself and mentioned it was his birthday tomorrow (aka today). Now I'm not wishing him unpleasant bday wishes, but I am wishing him an inconvenient day. You see it was a Wednesday evening in a bar less than popping. Young professionals all just grabbing some bevis with their colleagues. Do you have that image in your head?Now imagine solemn music in the background. Sappy, soft love ballads. Like what? You agree, that doesn't make sense, right? So I create a Spotify playlist and am told we can put music-which was legit! What was not legit was then being told song after song-one more. It is like he was just saying anything to keep us happy. And the DMB songs just whining away-MAKE IT STOP.I rather hear no then string us along.Does it stop there? NO.He then proceeds to talk about my friend in front of her saying she was a drunk girl and didn't know what she was talking about when she mentioned the drink was a little weak. Now we know our G&Ts. Jimmy obvi doesn't. We had our lil irish man recreate the bevi. (Love ya, Patty)My advice is if you want a bartender to server you a weak G&T, lie to your face, and then shit talk about lies then go here!Have fun, but I will be taking my business elsewhere.Bye bye bye, fiddlesticksRIP",1,4,

The staff is great and the food is usually delicious. I get the irish breakfast for brunch every time and it's consistently delicious. Today, my boyfriend got the steak and eggs, medium rare and at first it came out cold. They refired the steak and it came out well done. Not sure if they just microwaved it. Anyhow, the chef also sliced the steak and that made the steak dry. Just a suggestion, don't slice the steak cause it makes the steak cold and dry.

We had to get up and ask for service multiple times -- watched countless members of the waitstaff standing around while we tried to make eye contact for water, drinks, food, and the bill (seriously -- every time). After waiting about 10 minutes for someone to pick up our bill with payment, we considered just walking out, but instead took our bill to the bar with a simple request: a fixed amount on one card, the remainder on the other. We watched the bartender walk everything to another register, work with three other staff members to slowly run the two cards, and then give everything to another member of the waitstaff to bring to us with some serious tude. And guess what -- the amounts were wrong. Not hugely surprising, but seriously? What a mess, and really a shame because, like I said, the good was surprisingly decent.",1,1,1

The atmosphere is unique.  The tables are super uncomfortable.  If you're any taller than, say, 5'10"", your knees will be wanting to shatter again the strange boards that stop you from being able to get your legs under the table. The music is approaching ""Douchey Level I"". The service is unique.  Solid, but quirky.  The food.  The nachos are quite good.  You should get those (preferable with the ""pulled chicken"").  The mac and cheese is decent, but at $14, you might want to reconsider (way too pricey for what it is).

I got the lamb stew and my friend got a burger. Not spectacular meals, but I probably won't come back for the food next time, just for happy hour. Seating is first come, first served as there's no hostess. Also, to note, bathrooms are upstairs and there was an attendant there.

I paid 5 dollars for my Guinness at Happy Hour which was actually really nice. However, in general I was very underwhelmed by the service. I felt like the food took far too long to come out, especially since I just ordered Jameson fries and Pigs in a Blanket, and the bartender's weren't anything I'd call exceptional. They weren't bad. And I understand that I was sitting at a round bar, and there was one or two bartenders who were fairly busy. I don't expect a ton of conversation at happy hour, but through in a quip man, ask me if I want another drink before I've been sitting with an empty glass in front of me. There's little things that you can do service wise to bump your rating up from a three to a four or five, and this place didn't have it.That said, the food I had was rather good. I enjoyed the Jameson fries which came nicely seasoned, and the Pigs in a Blanket was tasty, but for eight dollars I thought the portion was a little small. The best thing about what my friend and I ordered was the dipping sauces. The fries came with a sauce that I couldn't readily identify, but it was delicious, and the mustard sauce that came with the pigs in a blanket was the highlight of my time there, it had a bit of a spice and a really nice aftertaste while being very aromatic.Overall, this was a nice bar with a relaxed atmosphere to it when I went which was around six o'clock on a Friday evening. I recommend it as a nice place to get some reasonably priced drinks and some tasty appetizers. It's a great way to start an evening, but it's not the kind of place I can see myself spending hours at.",2,,

A great menu to choose from, and all very reasonably priced. Terrific service too from my waitress and boy the portions were huge. Before long I was inside seated at the bar (no need for sunscreen in there) getting looked after by the wonderfully fun and friendly bartenders who really know their beers and whiskeys. Here was a place with personality that was making me feel at home. And as it got later the crowd kept building, with the free flowing music and drinks combining to send the place into orbit.

85,Dan R.,"Brooklyn, NY",635,550,148,3.0,3/16/2011,"Fiddlesticks has hosted many a going-away party for my office. By nature, this makes it a bittersweet watering hole. You'd think I'd be sick of this place, but that's not entirely the case.I like to believe the large, round bar in the center of the main space is a welcoming trait, but really it just gives the illusion I have a better chance at getting a drink. Which I kinda don't. I do happen to favor the side passageway between back and front and upstairs bathroom in between, but I'm always wondering what extra rooms they're hiding along those sneaky corridors. The offshoot dining areas are gracious, but totally under-utilized.Still, this place can turn into a party. The bartenders have thrown down house shots on occasion, and the semi-circle centerpiece bar fixture dictates an almost organized chaos. But Fiddlesticks leaves little room for those who like to wander, despite its deceiving square footage. And for drunks like myself, wandering can be kind of a big deal.And yet I never seem to have a bad time here. As long as people continue to leave my company and subscribe to that whole grass-is-greener theory, I will be there with bells on. After all, what's a going-away party without a proper shit-faced send-off? Fiddlesticks won't let the door hit you on the way out, but it may just kick your ass.",5,2,4

I didn't order food for brunch but the rest of my party did and they didn't have good things to say about it. I did try the fries, which I liked, but then again how hard is it to mess up fries? Everyone at our table had a plate with eggs, and the consensus was that the eggs were done incorrectly or cooked too long. It's a big place that is good for groups and I like the decor. The restrooms struck me as a little odd. The men's restroom looked like a 5 star hotel (I could tell just from walking by, the door was open and there were mirrors) and the women's restroom looked like a stall in a crappy concert venue. I'd come back if a group of my friends were meeting here but I won't go out of my way to get there.",,,

I am pretty picky about my Bloody Marys, but was impressed. Plenty of horseradish,  Worcestershire sauce, tobasco, etc. I ordered 3 more. The only other addition I would like to see next time is a garnish of a few green olives and stalk of fresh celery to offset the great spices.If Jack is taking care of the Bloody Mary mix--and they bring back the 2 drinks that used to be included with the brunch a few years ago--I just might become a regular brunch customer again!

We chilled out and waiting for waitress service, it took about another 15/25 minutes. Once she was with us, she was flawless and on her game. She was running around so much, we begged her to sit. As usually the prices were Manhattan high, so we drank for hours and paid a pretty penny. The layout of this place is strange. Most of the table space is on one far side, leaving the bathroom on the far opposite side (down a hallway and up the stairs). The trek to the bathroom got considerably longer once you packed the place with people. To sum it up, its too loud and too crowded.

Updated review","Ish ain't changed after a 3-year hiatus.Still lots of college-lookin kids and still not as cheap as other Irish pubs in the village area.There is an outdoor area to drink/eat....but if you smoke, you gotta stand on the other side of the partitions...WTF...makes no sense.",1,1,
97,Clementine C.,"San Antonio, TX",180,617,122,2.0,3/29/2013,"Still don't get this bars popularity - here's why:Sweaty and sticky.  Fratty and bratty.  This place is probably great for one-two night stands, but it's not this amazing spot where you have to go.  I've been there on several brief occasions, and I see why my guy friends like it.  As a girl with over an ounce of self-esteem, I see it as a spot for picking up dates rather than enjoying a good drink, or the bad drinks they serve.  Beer is fine, bathroom sitch is great, and it can be awesome if you are part of a big group.  But, avoid for girls night out or pairs, because this spot ain't for that.",1,1,1
98,Jill D.,"New York, NY",28,39,4,4.0,2/23/2014,"Came here on Saturday for brunch with two other girlfriends. While two of us were waiting for the third, we made reservations at a brunch place a few doors away. The waitress at this other place was RUDE. So when our third person arrived, we abandoned the original place and came to Fiddlesticks, where the hostess had greeted us on our initial visit with menus and a polite attitude.So happy we made the switch. Fiddlesticks was great. For a large omelette (2 toppings free, others $1), tasty mixed green side salad, and two slices of (white, unbuttered...) toast was $15. The smoked salmon and red pepper filling was a good choice. Though they had no butter or jam, which seemed a little odd, it didn't really affect our meal that much.Included in that $15 was 1 complimentary boozy brunch drink. We chose the bloody marys and asked for them to be made strong (it had been a chaotic morning). The bartender made our free bloody mary (and subsequent second round drinks) so strong. The second round of drinks was $10 per drink and totally worth it. This is indicative (imo) of a quality place. Take note, snooty brunch joints and glossy dance halls: Don't skimp on the booze. You think we're drinking mimosas for the vitamin C?Atmo and service were both great. It was pretty quiet when we arrived but picked up a little during our stay. Wasn't ever too busy. Good music on but quiet, conversation possible. Servers were all really wonderful to us, polite and helpful, funny, just great. Maybe it was the extra strong bloody marys, but this was one of my better brunch experiences. It's chill, no-frills, not snooty, kind of divey, and fabulous. Will def be back!TL;DR version:Pros: Good food, one free brunch drink, friendly staff, great atmosphereCons: No dessert! Minimal brunch food options (7 choices), not a lot of ""extras"" (these are all so minimal so whatever!)",,,
99,Christine N.,"Manhattan, NY",140,352,290,4.0,6/29/2013,"I keep telling people this place has the best burgers in Manhattan.  The reason being in addition to the beef patty with all the trimmings, they add turkey bacon AND an egg in the burger.  The egg takes the burger to a whole new level of goodness.  That coupled with the deep fried seasoned curly fries you get on the side . . . let me just tell you that you will feel like you are having a heart attack while you are eating it.  But it is just *that* good.  LOLThey have outdoor patio seating during the day where you can opt to eat your burger or eat inside in the more bar/restaurant-like area.  Reading the other reviews, I'm surprised people come here to hang out in the evenings.  To me, it is more a burger place.  If you are going to come here in the evenings at all, come for the burger and not for the bar/crowd scene.I also love Shake Shack and while many will argue that is the best burger joint, I consider that more delicious fast food-style burger and Fiddlesticks more like the real sit-down high quality pub-style burger.  There is a time and place for both in your stomach.  Unami burger has also just recently come from the West Coast to New York  so I need to try that one as well, but once I do I will reassess the best burger situation.",1,,

Half the people in this bar are either 21 or using fake IDs to get in here.  They play top 40 hits and other techno songs.  The bar is packed and chances are you will be vying for a space.  This place is a great place to stumble into on a drunken night.  It is also fun if you want to feel youthful for the night, but I would not recommend it otherwise.  I have been here twice and I have had fun, but really this bar is nothing special.",,,

103,Andrew D.,"Silver Spring, MD",159,307,7,3.0,3/24/2013,"We ended up here one night when all the other places we wanted to go were just slammed. It was a good haven in a storm, but not necessarily a destination that I would seek out.The bar itself reminds me of the inn from the Fellowship of the Ring, where Frodo and the gang meet up with Aragorn for the first time. It is big and open, but dark and dingy at the same time. The music is not too loud, but it is somewhat random, flipping from the Pogues to LL Cool J. Weird stuff. The clientele is stretched between NYU kids to crusty old Irish mobsters, firemen and clubsters.The staff was adequate at taking orders and delivering food, not too friendly or too aloof, just very busy. They were quite good at managing the crowd and explaining to people that the wait would just be much longer than they'd hoped, or that they had to move because their table was reserved for 8:00... Luckily that didn't happen to us.The food and drinks were fine. Not excellent, not bad, just fine. Decent, predictable pub food. The shepherd's pie was bland. Other than that, nothing to complain about.Despite the middling feelings I got from each of the components of my experience, I still felt kind of good about the place, and it's somewhere I won't hesitate to go if my other plans didn't work out. It's just... not bad at all.",1,1,

105,M E.,"Seattle, WA",17,87,11,2.0,6/4/2013,"Took us 45 minutes for food. The 2 tables next to us both left because they were waiting so long. They told us ""The kitchen is slammed so it'll be a while.""  It was a Sunday afternoon, the place was only 1/8th full.I ordered quesadillas which probably isn't the best idea at a pub, but I did. They brought out ranch dressing instead of sour cream for my quesadilla's. I complained and the waitress said ""We don't have ranch dressing here. It's sour cream. I just got yelled at by the kitchen, they said it's sour cream.""  Now I didn't study at Le Cordon Bleu, but I'm pretty sure I can tell the difference between ranch dressing and sour cream.Cocktails were horrible. Granted again this is a pub so we should have low expectations, but still, there should be a basic level of quality.That aside, we had to go to the waiter station to ask for our check and again to pay it.So all around everything was horrible: kitchen service, waitress service, food quality, drink quality.If you go here, order a bottle of beer and that's it.",1,,
106,Meghan M.,"Boston, MA",161,1029,8,2.0,2/17/2011,"I really liked this place when we walked in.  The ambiance is really charming, it's super cozy, and a definitely different vibe from other pubs in the general vicinity.  This warm fuzzy feeling went out the window rather quickly.  We were seated at a quiet table in the corner of the bar to the right of the entrance.  The beer list is decent and the menu is pleasantly simple.  I ordered a Boddington and the hummus (decent but too many onions!).  I tried the fish and chips and the batter on the fish was WAY too salty.  The chips were quite good though.  Once we placed our order, we didn't see our waitress again AT ALL.  This meant any requests, including that for the check, went via the busboy.  It was strangely terrible.  And then, unfortunately, I went to the bathroom...This place turned into a club!  Girls in sparkly tops and jeggings.  Girls falling down drunk in the bathroom.  Weird top 40's music pounding.  Why, Fiddlesticks, why??  I could have forgiven the other flaws and given you another shot but now I just can't.  In essence, this is not your typical West Village bar whatsoever...More like someplace I'd find in (my beloved) Hoboken.",1,,1

What makes it even worse is that their website advertizes a 10-15 dollar brunch with 2 drinks ie: bloodys, wine, screwdrivers, bud, but that's not what we were offered or paid. We also waited 50 minutes for our burger and omelet. The burger was really good but the fried egg on top was not.The omelet was pretty good but the side of hash browns was awful.Our server was pretty green but he was very nice. They had the game playing on TV which made my son happy so that was a plus.  It's a very old place which I imagine has lots of history and because I was with good company I didn't sweat the small stuff.

Yesterday we brought a visiting friend there and found that one of the best brunches in the city had been reduced to a choice of bacon and eggs or french toast with no libations included. For the same price. We left and ate at Coppelia. I don't get it. The menu on the web is still th good brunch menu. Bone Lick Park, Elephant and Castle and Coppelia were bursting at the seams with brunch customers while Fiddlesticks was virtually empty.

113,Scott S.,"New York, NY",1,28,2,5.0,8/6/2014,"My fiancé and I had our engagement party here, and I couldn't say enough great things about the staff here!  I called about a month before because this was a surprise for my soon to be fiancé, and the management was very willing to help and was very accommodating.  They reserved the back area for our party at NO CHARGE and said her friends could decorate beforehand.  When we showed up that night, her friends had already decorated and the place looked awesome.  Later, I found out that the fiddlesticks staff provided balloons and markers to write on the mirror and encouraged more decorating for our engagement.  The bar also provided 3 champagne bottles for a champagne toast for everyone at the party (this was not told to me beforehand, so it was a GREAT and WELCOME surprise!).  Our waiter, Jack, was very friendly and went out of his way to make sure he was always around to take orders and was also always sure that everyone had a drink in their hand if they wanted one.  They did not even need to have our credit cards on file or in advance for tabs -- very trustworthy and made us feel even more welcome!  At one point towards the end of the night, these immature young guys came to our section and ripped down the decorations.  My friends and I gave them a piece of our mind, and right away, one of the managers and bouncers came over and told us not to worry.  They then provided our section with a second bouncer as to not allow anyone in our reserved section, unless they were invited to the party.  The only one complaint was that the back area with a few steps up (where our party was reserved), was VERY hot.  I don't know if the AC was broken or something, but it was hot.  This wasn't too big of a problem because the rest of the bar was fine, but better AC in that area would make the bar EVEN BETTER.Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend having a party or event at FIDDLESTICKS.  The staff was amazing and VERY accommodating.  THANK YOU!",3,,

Nothing to write about.People in my group ordered the burger... $15 and it comes with an egg on top.

It's a cute and casual pub and on a Thursday the place was packed, presumably for the Happy Hour that goes until 8:00pm. The bar is large and there's space in a back room section behind the bar. There was even a DJ spinning during hh, which added to the feel of the establishment. We started out ordering from the bartender, then ended up snagging a table since our party was so big and we seemed to be getting in the way in our initial standing room location. At the tables we ordered from a waitress and, after reading other reviews, I was sure to check that the drinks at the table were still on happy hour prices and they were! A lot of people seemed to be complaining about the lack of happy hour prices at table, perhaps it's certain tables? Regardless, I'd check before ordering.We spent the evening catching up enjoying a couple beverages and ordered a couple appetizers. The nachos were good, but they missed the ""sour cream on the side"" direction and the hummus/pita was decent, but we had to order extra pita twice because there was so much hummus and so little pita. Oh, and the extra pita was $1 each time! Kind of a crock. Still, even with the pita and the screwed up nachos and the ultra hipster waitress, we had a nice time and I'd return.

Maybe I'll come back here. The waitress was very attentive and nice. It's an OK place. The prices are a turn off though.",1,,
145,Jill L.,"Philadelphia, PA",182,340,6,3.0,7/24/2012,"Visited Fiddlesticks while on a weekend trip to NYC from Philly.  Seemed like a very average Irish pub in NYC.  Drink prices seemed on par with prices at nearby places (however very elevated from the prices I'm used to in Philly).  The crowd could be described as early to mid-twenties and it seemed that it was mostly groups of friends out for girls/guys night outs.I wanted to give it to two stars, but I pumped it up a star because they offer outdoor seating, which was awesome because the bar area was ridiculously hot.  And I'm not talking about gorgeous people hot.  I'm talking about sweating off five pounds hot.Overall, I would visit Fiddlesticks again if I'm in the neighborhood and looking to get a few drinks with a group of friends.",,,

147,Marica d.,"Easton, CT",0,8,0,1.0,3/5/2013,"Went to Fiddlesticks with a large group for a friend's birthday and hope my review can dissuade at least one person from going here, as I know I NEVER will again. After being told our large party could be seated, but basically would be on the hotseat for the entirety of our meal (due to the fact that they had an upcoming reservation) we hesitantly accepted since everyone was either at Fiddlesticks or a short distance away.As we waited, our waiter appeared and reminded us of our time crunch. To try to move the process along, I asked for a drink menu and was promptly told ""yea right like I have those for you"" Really? No posting of offerings or prices? Please tell me this is a joke. Shaking off the initial proverbial slap in the face, I ordered a margarita which eventually came after I suspect the ice required for the beverage was harvested from the Swiss Alps.  Would have loved for my drink to taste a little less like a spiked 7-11 slushy, but hey you win some lose some on that.The food was standard fare. Nothing spectacular, but oh wait let me interrupt my review to remind you, like we all were, to consider wrapping this dinner up and maybe eat faster since we have another party coming. At that point we decided to try to get out of here as quickly as possible and request the check. I personally assisted the gathering of funds for a bill well into the hundreds and accurately totaled, tip included.  We PURPOSELY paid 100% in cash to avoid splitting the bill among 10 credit cards and to make our exit from this horrific place as easy as possible.As we were all getting our things ready to leave, we were then swiftly approached by the waiter accusing of us of shorting him ""at least 80 bucks"". After every inappropriate word flashed through my mind at how ludicrous of an accusation this was I swiftly bridged the gap of difference as the birthday girl herself was beginning to get flustered at the situation. A friend took this cash from me and finished with the waiter as I am sure my veins were beginning to pop from my head.To add the icing on the cake,  as we were trying to conclude this debacle, I was told by some other indeterminate employee that i had to vacate the area of our table as ""the next party is a the bar and you really need to move""To the management at Fiddlesticks, I sincerely hope the staff member who stole our/ my money had a very good reason/ life problem that brought him to the lowly state that would get him to steal from your patrons. I work pretty darn hard for my money and don't appreciate the service/attitude I received from your staff. Next time, if you can't seat a party in an appropriate amount of time to let them enjoy each others' company, maybe consider not being such money hounds and just tell the truth. TO ANYONE WHO TRAVERSES THIS ESTABLISHMENT: PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD. CASH 100% IS A MISTAKE WITH THIS PLACE.",,,
148,Jan C.,"San Francisco, CA",641,88,10,2.0,5/8/2011,"**DISCLAIMER RATING THE LATE NIGHT PUB ONLY***Came here on Saturday night around 10:30pm. Reminiscent of laid back San Francisco bars with pool tables and enough empty space for a makeshift dance floor. Crowd was kind of sparse but picked up quickly, to the point that I had to find ways to strategically maneuver my way around either same-sex crowds or makeout sessions...which brings me to my next point.... PICK UP BAR, PICK UP BAR, PICK UP BAR. did i mention this was a pick up bar??? i couldn't find any angle i could turn at which there wasn't some couple making out or grinding.Got kind of awkward around 1am when the lights went on the music went off, much to the dismay of beer-goggled folks who actually had the chance to glimpse who they were making out with. it was early enough that people were enjoying themselves, but not early enough that people were too drunk to notice. The bartenders tried to keep patrons in by telling them that they were just fixing the sound system, but by that point, the lucky people had either hopped into a cab to get some, or the unlucky ones were on their way out the door berating their friends for letting him/her make out with a grenade.Drinks depend on the bartender. At the beginning of the night, the first bartender was a little skimpy on the alcohol and looked at me funny when I asked for a Long Island with pineapple juice, but another bartender basically gave me my ""See ya!"" drink. Ummm... also.... definitely found out recently that my bartender swiped my card for a $120 tab. Hopefully it was on accident, so I won't mark the bar down a star, but still. I know things get hectic but you have to be a little more careful, dude. Crowd was okay. Girls weren't too friendly. Guys were too friendly. All in all, I will echo my previous reviewers and say this is a young, fun, hormonal college crowd. Not my every night bar, but it's great to know if I'm ever looking for a decent-looking one night stand I have a one stop shop.",3,3,2

There are these cool little nooks you can eat in, and we managed to get the one right by the window and could watch all the Halloween revelers walking to the parade. The service here is great; attentive, fast, and VERY friendly. The drinks aren't huge, but are well-made and not with the cheap stuff. Started with the artichoke dip served with freshly toasted pita - delicious! I had the Fiddlestick's burger (locally sourced beef, Irish bacon, cheddar, and a fried egg.) It was hearty, hot, and awesome. The bf had the shepherd's pie (second choice: they were out of the beef stew) and said it was very good. Again - hearty portions.

160,Mike B.,"New York, NY",15,401,19,3.0,3/8/2012,"A lot has changed since the last time I was here, but the overall impact of the changes is basically neutral.Here's what I mean: the beer selection has improved.  Nothing too out there, but a solid line-up: Captain Lawrence, Goose Island, etc.  The menu has been completely revamped.  BUT the steak sandwich I had didn't have much steak on it, BUT it was tasty and came with a generous side salad BUT the salad had WAAAY too much dressing.  The food prices are about 30-50% higher than they were;  They used to have a really affordable lunch special and it seems they may have done away with that.  They've also done away with what I always thought was the best (sometimes the only decent thing) on the menu: the cajun chicken sandwich.  If they knew what was good for the them, they'd bring it back.But the cardinal sin as far as I'm concerned is they DON'T HAVE MASHED POTATOES!!!  (""We're now serving a potato cake instead,"" our waiter explained.)  An Irish pub that doesn't serve mash!!!!!  WTF!They also appear to be the kitchen for the wine bar next door, so it's kind of comical watching waiters navigate their way in and out of the bar (especially on a crowded evening) and along Greenwich with full plates of food.Their outdoor seating remains dog friendly.",,,
161,ilana Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",90,28,7,1.0,11/9/2012,"This is a bit of a different review. I will never, and I mean NEVER, enter this establishment. Not even if you paid me. I would give it 0 stars but yelp doesn't allow that. The woman that owns this bar is the biggest (enter ANY colorful metaphor here) that I've ever encountered. Now let me paint the picture for you: About a week and a half ago the tri-state area was destroyed by hurricane sandy. We are still working very hard to get back to normalcy. This evening, I am filming on the set of nbc's Smash. We are filming interior and exterior shots at a restaurant 2 doors down from Fiddlesticks.  As I walk up to the location, I see large wooden boards in front of fiddle saying things like ""NBC doesn't love nyc"", ""the Rockaways are this way (arrow pointing)"", and ""NBC, your generator and food carts should be in the Rockaways"". As we began to film, the owner of the bar proceeded to make herself known, search for the camera, point her middle finger at the camera ruining our shots, even gave her customers free liquor so that they would come out in below freezing temperature to yell and scream and ruin the shot. Did she care to know that people working on this crew are displaced from the hurricane and still continue to work? Did she care that I happened to have been working this gig because I am currently unemployed because the bar where I work was submerged in 8ft of water from the hurricane? Does she care to know that NBC raised $23million from their televised hour long benefit for people affected by the hurricane? Or what about the incentives the city gets from having shows produced in the area. The production company came to her yesterday to offer her money for her troubles. The production company offered her $8000 and it was given to charity. Yet, today, she still wants to make a stink about it? I have been volunteering since last Friday in areas highly affected by Sandy. Here's the kicker...this woman has not once volunteered in any area that is in need. So maybe I should be reviewing the food, the drinks, the atmosphere. But based on my experience with this ignorant, ignorant woman, I would rather throw up in my mouth, pour it into a cup, and drink it.",13,2,4

My boyfriend and I just happened to stumble upon this pub while strolling through the West Village on the eve of my 21st birthday and decided to go in for just a drink. After being greeted by the very friendly and Irish bartender Rory, we knew we found the perfect place, as it was a Tuesday night, and all drinks cost $4  between Sunday- Wednesday. We loved the pub's authentic Irish charm- they even pour Guinness the correct way (I studied aboard in Ireland, so I know!)The best part about this place is defiantly the bartender Rory! He's most personable and fun bartender I have the pleasure meeting, and made my birthday week unforgettable.

When I finally escaped, I felt like I had emerged from underwater. Smelly, sweaty, crowded water. I do have to say, though, that the bar itself is really a cool place. It's huge, there are a fair amount of places to sit, and the bartenders are cool. If you don't mind a crowd, Fiddlesticks is a great place. If not, I'd suggest going during the week.",1,1,1

My burger was delish though for once I wish there were a middle ground between medium rare and medium. The waitress had no problem allowing us to sit there, enjoy the sunny day, sip our drinks, and enjoy our food. There was no rush and everything was done with a smile. I'll definitely be coming back and next time it's onto the steak and eggs! Or the fish and chips... so many to choose from!

It gets packed to the brim on Friday and Saturday nights. It's hard to move around, it's hard to talk to people (they definitely amp up the volume, so get used to shouting if your buddies aren't right next to you), and it's hard to get your fair share of overpriced Manhattan booze because there is never any open space at the bar.

There were only a few people so food was served very quickly. The waitstaff was helpful and came by to check up on us a couple times. The guinness beef stew was awesome. The shepherd's pie was ok.

183,Amanda H.,"Hamilton, Canada",233,329,880,4.0,6/11/2009,"One lucky Tuesday Fiddlesticks made such a good first impression I came here twice in the same day.  Visit #1: Aprox 4:30PM.  Met a friend for an outdoor seating afternoon snack and chat.  We shared the Mac & Cheese and had a few beers.  Mac and Cheese was amazing - definitely a contender for top 5 best mac and cheeses I've had in NY.  One of those baked dishes that comes in a betty crocker type ceramic dish.  The waitress can hardly hold it it's so hot, and the cheese is bubbling on top.  You try to wait until it cools off but every bite you take is so cheesy, creamy, perfect, and wonderful you don't care your mouth is burning.  And this continues, until the dish is cashed - somehow it stays hot, scalding hot forever.  Yum.  There is a pretty good happy hour offering $4 beers but you can't get it if you eat/sit outside.Visit #2:  Aprox 8:30PM.  Came back later that evening with another friend for drinks, it was a little chilly so we voted for inside.  Thick wood all around, fairly lively bar crowd, cozy dark corners away from TVs - plenty of beers on tap to choose from.  I tried a ginger cocktail, it was way too sweet and there wasn't nearly enough whiskey for my taste.Stopped in yesterday afternoon in-between West Village events - I was famished and ordered my standby, the Mac (photos attached.)  I ate about 1/2 and was so full I had them bag up the cajun chicken sandwich I also ordered - what was I thinking?  There was noooo way I could have eaten all that food - but it did heat up nicely in the oven this morning, and made for a spicy breakfast.",,,
184,DH H.,"New York, NY",90,896,2,2.0,5/29/2010,"We were looking for a place to sit outside, so we stopped by here.  There were not tables available, so we told the hostess we'd go in and sit at the bar; she said ok.We walked in, some sort of awful mid-90s technopopcrap (Real McCoy or 2 Unlimited or something?!) was playing at a speaker-distorting volume.  Note that this was at 5pm, not late at night when there would be a slightly better reason to play loud music (although, not Real McCoy - there is no excuse to ever play that in this century)Anyway, we looked at each other with the most horrified expressions and turned around and walked right out.  The hostess laughed at us as we left.  I'm not sure if it was commiseration or mockery.",3,2,1
185,Stephanie P.,"Pomona, CA",152,627,331,3.0,7/5/2011,#136 We really only spent about 30 minutes here so I don't have too much to add. =) + Plenty of room+ Pool tables+ Friendly and efficient bartenders+ Great crowd- Expensive drinks- Way too many college babies,,,

187,Louis T.,Long Island,142,10,2,4.0,9/24/2010,"The staff was polite, friendly, and attentive. The veggie burger there is outstanding.(This review is now 4 months old because Yelp forces me to finish reviews on their website instead of on their iPhone app).",1,1,1
188,Natalia A.,"Manhattan, NY",67,26,0,1.0,7/30/2012,"It makes me sad to give it such a bad review because the staff is nice and the food was pretty okay, but a cockroach crawled on my arm during Sunday brunch. They were nice and didn't charge me for my food, but I'm pretty sure I'll never go back again.",2,,
189,Andrea A.,"College Point, NY",12,141,8,4.0,6/10/2013,Came here to have a few beers.  The beers weren't too expensive ($7 each).  They had a pool table which was $2/game.  I guess because we got there mid-day they didn't have change for the pool table so we had to go to a local store for change.  They eventually got change for us so we could continue to play.  They played a different variety of music.  The old school family pictures kind of freaked me out in the hallway on the way to the ladies room but I guess that was part of the decor.  Overall had a great time and if I'm in the area again I would go back.,,,
190,Emily S.,"Pacific Beach, San Diego, CA",62,95,5,4.0,9/4/2013,"This is a review for happy hour, which I've been to twice. Yes, I've also been here late on a saturday night and I realize it has it's share of douche bags. Anyway, it's pretty awesome for happy hour. Goes until 8pm, casual atmosphere, but not like a dive bar. Outside seating, beer/wine/house spirits are $4, and there fries are super yummy.",,,
191,Sarah M.,"Cincinnati, OH",2,15,0,5.0,8/30/2013,Came for happy hour.. Had a great time. Our waitress Siobhan was the best. We live around the corner- will definitely be back. Good cocktails and great outdoor seating,,,
192,Julia H.,"Redmond, WA",1,20,0,4.0,10/3/2010,"Love this place for brunch. Excellent food for a great price of $10 and includes two alcoholic drinks! The menu is a little limited and nothing too fancy, but everything we ate was very tasty.The services was great and loved the eclectic decor. They even offered free sunscreen to people sitting outside in the sun.",1,,1
193,Martina R.,"San Francisco, CA",54,186,0,4.0,5/28/2011,"Came for a bite around dinner. An Iris fare. Has traditional burgers, salads, sandwiches, but also has entrees like the ""Thanksgiving Dinner with all the trimmings."" Fun looking crowd around the bar - lots of space, and an area set off for pool. Outdoor seating available for those eating or enjoying table service and the front was all open for the summer air. Nice, casual spot.",,,
194,Chris C.,"Brooklyn, NY",105,47,6,2.0,6/14/2010,"Let's see Fiddlesticks...The bouncer must not check ID's too closely, ton of underage people the two times I have been here. Bathroom attendants in a sports bar type bar? At least keep the bathrooms clean and don't scream on the phone while your working.  Nothing worse than the awkwardness of not wanting to tip for having to pee. $6-7 drafts * sigh *Won't honor their foursquare promotion drink dealsWay over crowdedA little smellyEveryone who works there seems to be kinda mad at you. Food isn't that bad though, so not a 1 star performance.  2.  2 stars.",2,,
195,Lily M.,"Manhattan, NY",12,333,16,1.0,8/8/2010,"Walked in, turned around, and left. Elbow to elbow with other people. OKAY music. The end.If you don't like personal space, this is the spot for you. I'm sorry but I actually like to be able to BREATHE thank you very much.",1,1,
196,Caitlin M.,"Brooklyn, NY",188,376,43,1.0,2/21/2010,"Let this little star represent a bushel full of negative stars. This place is the haven for newly graduated, just graduated frat boys and the girls who like them. By now, you're imagining a lovely white winter wonderland. Well, you're wrong. It was an absolute blizzard in here. I arrived at Fiddlesticks at 12:30 on a Saturday night and was thrown into the mosh pit. Think Titanic without enough life rafts or holiday Walmart stampede and you'll get the drift here. If you like grinding up on strangers and wading through the splish splash of assorted drinks sploshed on you, this place is for you. And to anyone who thinks this place is fun, I say fiddlesticks!",3,1,1
197,Maria F.,"Little Rock, AR",10,11,0,3.0,10/18/2011,"After having experienced Fiddlesticks on a not so busy Friday Happy Hour and an insane Saturday night I can draft a well rounded review.The bartenders are nice and the drinks are pretty inexpensive during happy hour.  There are tables but I am pretty sure they were intended to be used for eating so we ended up standing around the bar, which was fine anyway. Fun pop tunes, a little bit of dancing. All is well in the world..... then I came back on a Saturday night.The demographic went from young professionals to college kids, which was totally fine. The downside was that it was so crowded that I literally could not move. This had to be a fire code violation of some sort. I am sure I would've had fun if there were just a few less people or a few more square feet.",,,
198,Jason D.,"Brooklyn, NY",77,48,85,1.0,11/13/2012,"Tried to go there last Thursday night, but the rowdy chanting drunks outside made the place seem not welcoming. Bar fail! Plus they seemed not to have any Irish music playing.",,1,
199,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",121,1106,2,3.0,11/26/2010,"came here for fiance's coworker's birthday. it's a laid back bar with a low-key vibe. Nice mix of people, decent drinks. i like the area inside - lots of comfy chairs and nooks and crannies where you can have a more private conversation (should you want one). it gets quite crowded towards the end of the night",,,
