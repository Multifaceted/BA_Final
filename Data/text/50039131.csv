0,Julia C.,"Clermont, FL",37,95,18,5.0,8/10/2018,"There are several of these around town but this one was next to my hotel so I popped in several times.  The iced coffee was delicious, I probably had 4 or 5 this week.  The sandwiches we're tasty and I appreciated the fresh options, including fruit.  I wish these were near my home so I could go here more often.",1,,1
1,Steve A.,"Orlando, FL",249,1181,3443,4.0,2/17/2018,"I like the simplicity of Pret if you just want a coffee and croissant. The baristas can certainly whip up something fancy, but sometimes it's nice to just serve yourself a cup.The chocolate hazelnut croissant is noteworthy, because it's filled like pain au chocolate, but is the shape and consistency of a croissant.",2,1,1
2,Kurt W.,"Clearwater, FL",0,5,0,1.0,9/18/2018,"Terrible. An employee by the name if charmaine is rude and disgusting. High turnover if employees so you rarely see familiar faces. The atmosphere is fine but its only for stuck up yuppies and business professionals. Avoid vindora/helen and ashley. Those two female managers are very condescending. Food is good, but those all three of the people i mentioned have to go.",,1,
3,Tameeka B.,"Elmhurst, Queens, NY",249,152,523,5.0,6/19/2017,"This location is spacious. The almond croissants are the bomb. They are light flaky and buttery but I still got an extra side of butter to add to this croissant. It's a great breakfast and reasonably priced.The green / mango tea with pomegranate is refreshing and delicious. The staff is friendly, the wifi is reliable and it's not far from radio city hall. This place is a great cheaper priced option for this area.",1,,
4,Walter R.,"Santa Clara, CA",23,13,6,3.0,8/26/2018,"Food is good and prices are accesible, staff is friendly. Just wanted ask you to double check you're being charged the correct amount and for the right food, was charged with a more expensive sandwich and didn't realize until later...",,,
5,Niloy B.,"Bronx, NY",6,22,2,2.0,3/28/2018,They run out of food on a regular basis. The lines to pay  are utter chaos...no organization at all...no manager to direct the lines...people skipping...frustrating experience,,,
6,Alyssa Y.,"Newport Beach, CA",3,17,25,5.0,6/5/2018,"This place has super fast services, and I really enjoyed their coffee and bagels. Since it was so fast, I didn't expect to have a warm and toasted bagel, but it was! They have regular, decaf and flavored self-serve coffee. The place was busy, and they didnt seem like to have time to pay enough attention to the self-serve area.. they ran out cups and sleeves, but they were nice and helped me out quickly when I asked for their help at the counter.",,,1
7,Michael M.,"Las Vegas, NV",17,186,234,4.0,8/10/2017,Great quick and affordable place for lunch.After walking through Central Park stopped in for a well needed break.,,,
8,Hannah K.,"Toronto, Canada",9,108,265,4.0,8/2/2018,"This is the happening place between 7:00-9:30 AM ( is the best time for people watching ) You will see sales person at Sephora,  billionaire,  office workers wait -on -line for coffee, breakfast quiche / sandwiches.  I always loved Pret - a - manger.  But this location is the best :  1) back up helpers on line to help out on waiting customers 2) one person always checking out shelves for refills 3) coffee refill personnel is always on the go   I love their food ( my quiche was piping HOT ) But I m not impressed with their diluted coffee.  Nope  I had to go down to starbucks ( 1 hour later for my java )",,,
9,April H.,"North Miami Beach, FL",119,9,2,5.0,8/11/2018,"I highly recommend this restaurant. Friendly, professional employees, especially Varnell. He treated my daughter so special since it was her bday! We will definitely be back. Ps. The chicken noodle soup was delicious!",,,
10,Ben H.,"FLUSHING, NY",85,49,14,2.0,9/21/2017,"I really only go to Pret for coffee and their chocolate chip cookie. Lately, in the last few months, this location decided they weren't going to leave their milk supply out, for the coffee. You have to go to the counter and ask for it. Really annoying and inefficient. I'm also not sure if its just this location or a new Pret policy.",2,,
11,MeMe B.,"Manhattan, NY",34,58,154,4.0,3/17/2017,"Good quick stop for healthy munchees! There's also free wifi! I had the kale Caesar salad, chicken not much flavor but that's where dressing comes in. I really love Pret A Manger's coconut water!! The fact that they aren't wasteful and give their food away to the hungry makes me happy and always want to support them! Wish more food establishments would do the same!",1,,
12,Kelsey C.,"Pottstown, PA",98,6,8,4.0,11/2/2017,"We were looking for a place to grab a small bite for breakfast and saw this place out of our hotel window. I don't eat bread so it is always a little hard to find something, but I ended up grabbing the balsamic chicken with mozzarella and tomato baguette and an English Breakfast tea while my mom grabbed an egg and avocado baguette and a coffee. Everything was delicious! My mom really enjoyed her coffee. The atmosphere was great, the employees were friendly, and the prices were pretty reasonable (especially for being right off of Times Square!)",,,
13,Shirley C.,"Manhattan, NY",4,10,0,3.0,8/22/2017,"I come here regularly as it is right across the street from my office. Food is always a solid option here but my review is on a drink I recently ordered, iced almond milk matcha latte. I literally cringed when I saw them make it. They poured the matcha powder directly into the cold almond milk and stirred but that just left huge clumps of the powder at the bottom of my drink. All the other pret's that I've gotten it from mixed the powder with a little hot water first to make it smooth and then poured it into the milk. Not sure if it was laziness or lack of knowledge but please keep it consistent.",,,
14,Anonnie M.,"New York, NY",1,21,3,2.0,7/25/2017,"Why are all the Prets in this area so sloppy? I used to often get lunch at Pret when I worked in other parts of the city, but the 3 locations nearest me in the Rockefeller Center area are so sloppy, I've often gone in, looked at the food, and left in disgust. The one in the concourse, the one on 50th between 6th and 7th, and the one on 7th and 52nd all have a problem making sandwiches in particular - they seem to think the best way to make a sandwich is to have 2/3rd of the ingredients falling out of the front. Get it together!",,,
15,S. S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,5,0,1.0,4/6/2018,"This is the worst place. I work nearby so I only go in when I am in an hurry or am lacking better judgment. Every time, they amaze me with how inept they are. They run out of food. They run out of coffee. They run out of milk, and cups, and sleeves, and utensils... On a daily basis. The staff is clueless and doesn't pay attention. The lines to pay are disorganized chaos. Only about half of the lines have the LevelUp app functioning, so you wait on a line and get to the front and they tell you to get in a different line to pay. They have mischarged me for the wrong food items. They must have some mandated ""give-the-customer-a-compliment"" policy, because really, my coat is really just okay, please stop staring at me blankly for a full 20 seconds when i get to the front of the frustrating line and then compliment my coat. I get it. Ugh. I go in every now and then, and I know you're going to run out of coffee. You work there every day, how do you not anticipate that? Make more coffee. It's simple.",,1,
16,Laura G.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,14,0,5.0,12/28/2017,"The staff is really nice and friendly, the space is always clean and welcoming. The salads are my favorite, and it's annoying the dressing costs extra but they are so fresh and tasty it's worth it. They donate their extra food each day, which a lot of places don't do. Their coffee is really good. Love this place",,,
