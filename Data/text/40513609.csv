0,Bridget B.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",219,272,152,4.0,7/22/2018,"I am giving this review a 4 because the food deserves a 5 and the service deserves a 2-3. We were seated immediately, but our waiter abruptly comes and asks if we are ready, without introducing himself or even saying 'hello.' I also couldn't understand 95% of what he was saying so I opted to just guess what he meant. There was also a man filling waters and when we asked for refills, his face became bitter. I would understand if the place was busy and everyone was running around to provide service to everyone, but it was quite empty.The food on the other hand was delicious. My father and I enjoyed our burgers and fries. They tasted so fresh. My mother ordered the Salmon and she loved that it was odorless and juicy. It came with 2 sides so we chose corn and fries. The corn was a bit dull and tasted like it has been sitting in the water for a long time. My brother ordered the club sandwich and he enjoyed it as well. I took a bite of the bacon from his sandwich and it was as crispy as a potato chip. For a family of 4, we spent about $65. When you are patient, you can dine for cheap in NY! Do not be intimidated by trying something different and new!",2,2,2

Updated review","This diner is directly across from the bus stop, which is the only reason we stopped in. This was our second visit. The place still looks the same....old and dirty. The lady at the cash register....I guess she ""greets"" and seats???? Well, she seems to be grumpy and lacking words.Our server was prompt, quick with greeting us (even before we sat down!), taking the order, bringing the food and packing the food. The food itself was average, so this time I stuck with a plain bagel and coffee. The cakes in the display look good at first, but also appear to have been in there for a while.",3,1,2
2,Pooja M.,"Fremont, CA",528,258,1050,2.0,10/9/2018,"I really wanted to like Skylight Diner because of all the amazing items they have on their brunch menu, and diner food can feel so homey which is nice to have in a city like NYC that has posh and trendy food sprawled throughout the city.Our party of six waited more than half an hour for our food to arrive, and while I understand that Sunday brunch is a busy time for restaurants, we could see other patrons being served their food even though they arrived after us. I was definitely starting to get hangry (and trust me, when I'm hangry, it's bad for everyone!) and wanted to check in with our server about the food, but unfortunately, no one ever came to check up on us during our service while we were waiting for our food.And even when the food finally did arrive, a lot of the order was messed up - we were served the wrong pancakes, there was a missing side of bacon, a missing side of toast, etc. It was incredibly frustrating to first have to wait for a long time for our food to arrive and then when it did arrive, it was not even correct. And to make matters worse, the food was incredibly mediocre. I ordered the Salmon benedict, which is one of my favorite brunch menu items, but unfortunately, the lox that was served with my benedict was way too salty and the English muffin was hard to cut into. I ended up leaving it half eaten which is a shame, because I really hate wasting food. My experience at Skylight Diner left much to be desired, and the only saving grace I think was the great company I was with. I unfortunately do not think I will be making a return trip.",3,1,1
3,Sunshine S.,"Manhattan, NY",0,13,1,1.0,9/9/2018,"I just found a one-star review about Jose on the first page here and this is about him as well. I live just a few blocks away from this diner so I occasionally ordered food via Seamless or take-out. Most of the time, the experience wasn't enjoyable but it was still tolerable. Today i came here to pick up my waffle and sausages for my Sunday breakfast and Jose was already irritated by something when I got there. He asked me what I ordered like a NYPD or something... and again got irritated cause i added a sentence that I already ordered on the phone. He put my waffle, butter and syrup on the counter so hard with a disgusting attitude but it was still okay for me until i realized he missed a fork and knife.So i came back to ask those and he threw me this attitude again insisting he already put it. What's the point of his madness? I believe he needs some therapy...or something. So i had to open the brown paper bag again to prove that i am innocent. The other guy next to him tried to give me folk and knife and finally Jose put those on the counter(not to me) throwing all the anger and rudeness. There were quite many people  and I felt almost insulted by this guy. I asked the lady behind the counter ""where is the manager?"" and she told me manager is not here and Jose got mad because she was messed with two people already...? What does that mean? She sounded like... There are reasons on his rudeness so i have to understand him...? Oh also she added ""anyway you got the fork and knife?"" so what's a problem?  This place is just so stupid and they literally ruined my weekend morning. I won't never come back. I found most of the customers here were tourists. if you're local you'll definitely have a bad experience at some point just like me(before i left this review my yelp reviews were all five stars).",1,,

5,Darya S.,"Manhattan, NY",918,1898,816,1.0,6/22/2018,"Before visiting, I thought the other one-star reviews were being harsh, because how bad could a diner in the heart of New York be? But no, there is nothing redeeming about this one. What made my jaw drop was the service. I'd asked for our food to go, and Jose, the server, literally rolled his eyes at me, scoffed, and got mad for my request, even though more than half of my dish was left and 99% of my friend's meal was as well. He took it, threw it into a plastic container while angrily cursing at me under his breath, and threw it in front of me, like I was the biggest annoyance of his life. Who does this? It's part of your job to prepare food to go if the patron asks. He was so mad at me that I felt the need to say, ""thanks, sorry about that,"" even though I had nothing to apologize for. Then, trying to be understanding, I asked the hostess if everything was okay with Jose and if I shouldn't have asked him for my food to go, and she merely responded, ""he's busy."" This left me with the worst impression. I had also gotten there earlier than my friend and scouted out two seats by the counter so we could be by the one TV they have and watch a World Cup game. I kept getting asked for my order (as in every thirty seconds), and I kept letting them know that I'm waiting for someone and that it'd just be a few more minutes. They were visibly annoyed with me, even though the diner was halfway empty and I wasn't taking up anyone else's space. I've never felt so unwelcome somewhere. As for the food, it was fully tasteless and the coffee was nothing to rave about. To start, I got the Mediterranean omelette and the iced coffee. My friend got the eggs and bacon, which he maybe took a bite out of. My omelette was a waste of an omelette. I didn't taste any of the ingredients. It was hardly edible. You can replace the potatoes for fruit for a fee, which I did, and that was the highlight of my breakfast here. The iced coffee tasted cheap, like water. A Starbucks breakfast, with the soccer game on my phone instead of on a TV, would've been better. Go figure.",10,3,3
6,Elvis L.,"Stone Ridge, VA",70,276,242,4.0,3/17/2018,Much better than iHop in my opinion. Traveled from VA to NYC over the weekend and found this nice little dinner around the corner where I stayed. Service was great and the food was good! Wasn't expecting much but this definitely exceed my expectation for a little dinner. Would definitely come back and try out their other items on the menu.

Updated review","I have reviewed this diner previously, but when I come to NYC (which isn't often), I always end up here. As diners go, this is a top echelon. Great variety on the menu. Came with my wife this time (previously only on business), and she liked it too. The cooks get the over easy eggs perfect, the coffee mug is always full, and the ambiance is bright and cheerful- great for the morning!  Service is efficient and attentive but never feel rushed. I am sure I will be back again!",,,

It's a step up from ihop, affordable, and I didn't have any issues with their service like the other reviewers. Our waiter was very pleasant and our food came out quickly. They're also open 24 hours and serve beer.I ordered the fried egg and sausage on a roll which was cheap and filling. I also tried some of their French fries which my friends and I really enjoyed.

Went here for a drunk meal this past Saturday night/Sunday morning since it's a two minute walk from my friends apartment and I was thinking about eating here ever since I knew it existed lol. The place looked clean but had a strong smell of cleaner which I don't appreciate when trying to eat. Two positive things were that the server was very nice and the food came out very quick, probably within 5 minutes. I got my typical diner meal- grilled cheese and a side of fries. The grilled cheese had a weird taste the first bite, but other than that it was average. The fries were thick cut and undercooked, not a fan. About $12 for this meal, pricey but it's NYC so can't fault them. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but I would go again if I was in the area and in a pinch.",,,

My colleague ordered Chocolate Chip Pancakes with a side of Sausage and a cup of hot coffee. Finally I came to a decision of Waffle with a side of Bacon. My food was just average like nothing so special about waffle and 4 strips of bacon but my colleague really liked her pancakes lol On a side note, they have a Daily Special menu but the dishes comes with way too much food.I left the tip on the table and my colleague paid the bill by the cashier register when you first walked in.",11,8,8
21,Vicky T.,"Manhattan, NY",0,41,2,2.0,4/27/2018,Skylight diner needs to really kick it up about 10 notches of they wish to remain in business with all that is happening in this area.  Some new diner will pop up nearby and put u guys out of buisness!!You have the location and the diner.  Do something quick!!The waitstaff makes mistakes on your orders at least 4 out of 10 times and this is unacceptable for a diner that is never very busy. Everytime I come in there... the occupancy rate is probably 30%Seamless is also hit or miss. You make an order and just cross your fingers that it comes out the way you requested.

After reviewing the menu, I went with an unusual food order for me, the vegetarian chili omelette. I enjoyed my meal while watching local cable news on the television and glaring at very large chocolate chip cookies which I finally decided not to indulge with. Jose was professional and friendly during the dining experience. The meal came with two slices of whole wheat toast and potatoes. I wish I was in a rush since it arrived in just a matter of minutes. As with most diner meals, it kept me filled until the next morning.",,,
26,Amanda D.,"Carlstadt, NJ",372,397,813,4.0,1/15/2017,This is a great diner in midtown NYC. I come here with various groups of friends at differing times of the day and night. They are open 24 hours! The interior seems a little out of date but the staff is super friendly. The diner is separated into two main areas. The area you first walk into and an area further in the back up some stairs. The back seating area is the best are in my honest opinion. This place has great prices for the area. The food is good and fairly quick. One of the best things about this place is they don't rush you. I like coming here to just to spend time with friends. I have come with small and large groups. They don't eve mind breaking the bill apart for everyone. They take credit card and cash. The last time I went here I had a tiramisu that was just delicious! I have also had burgers and other light snack dishes. I come in with friends some of which are picky eaters - when I come here they don't concern me as the staff will go off menu for her. Needless to say I do recommend this diner when you are looking to eat or hang out with friends. The dress is definitely casual but I am sure suits are welcome too. Even with people hanging around this place I don't find the noise level high at all. Conversations flow here the atmosphere promotes it. Happy Eating All!,2,,

Updated review","It looks just like an old-fashioned diner on the inside but a bit run-down. The waitress assigned to our table was a bit rude and impatient. I told her we needed more time and then she came back two minutes later to say, ""you ready yet?!"" After we ordered, the food came within 2-5 minutes - the quickest I've ever received food at a restaurant. However, the food was terrible! My boyfriend had French toast and eggs and I had a cheese quesadilla. It wasn't good at all. It seemed to be old food just reheatWe are ended up paying and not even finishing our food.

Beware: the ""matzah ball soup"" consisted of two bland matzah balls, maybe 4 limp noodles, no chicken or vegetables to speak of, and a broth that was somehow fluorescent yellow. I realize I might just be a Jew with high standards for this soup, but I haven't seen a matzah ball soup as skimpy or as strange before. One thing to remark on: probably the grossest restaurant bathroom I've ever been in. There was a grimey plunger and trash can in the only stall, the room smelled like pee, and the toilet paper dispenser was broken, meaning that the only toilet paper consisted of a few sheets clinging to a roll propped up on a pipe behind the toilet. Probably never cleaned. You can probably find a cleaner bathroom in nearby Penn Station.",,,

The diner itself was pretty spacious and when we got there, the venue was pretty much empty aside from 2-3 other parties. We were seated down immediately near the back of the diner and we were set to order. My friend and I settled for pasta dishes and my other friend had a wrap. The pasta dishes came with a choice of soup or salad. I opted for the salad instead. Overall, the food tasted like what typical diner food should taste like. Everything was inexpensive and we were all pretty much satisfied with the service and the meal itself. Would I be back? Sure",3,2,1

The restaurant was well lit and not very noisy for the amount of people there.  High ceilings and full windows certainly brighten up a place.The simple order of eggs and corned beef hash came exactly as ordered.  Again, not a big deal but so rare in most of these diners.  All was tasty hot and fresh.Our waitress came over to check on our process and brought some fresh coffee without me having to ask multiple times always with a smile...very refreshing!Check was delivered quickly and very reasonably priced..   Clearly, The Skylight Diner will be on my ""return"" list and I look forward to my next visit.",2,,1

After an hour I decided to call to see what the hold up was.

The menu is really extensive, though slightly pricier than other diners I've been to. Last time I was here, I had the California chicken wrap, which comes with fries and coleslaw. I also ordered a hot cup of coffee. Our waitress was super attentive and nice, and came by to refill our coffee whenever it got low, which I really appreciated. The wrap was pretty good - the chicken was yummy, though I did unexpectedly find a bone in there. I wish there was a bit more of the avocado salsa in the wrap, as it was quite good.

The food is average at best, and uninspired trash at worst. I've had from salads to meatloaf to burgers and wraps. The salads are bad - everything is straight out of the can or the supermarket. The ""famous"" meatloaf is just a tasteless pile of grinded up meat with some simple sauce. The price is also ridiculous. Everything always come out to $12-$18 for a very mediocre meal.The only saving grace of this place is that it's 24/7 and that you can sit there while waiting for your Megabus two blocks down.In summary: the food is REALLY bad because their cooks just literally opens a can or frozen box and dump it on a plate.

Asked for the whole wheat wrap option instead of white and this was delivered and no supplement to the bill.Hot chocolate was in a small cup and for $3 in a diner I'd have hoped for a tall glass or refills.

We both had $9.45 wraps (one chicken salad, one tuna salad). They came with a side of fries and a tiny cup of coleslaw. The decor has a cute, retro diner vibe. Skylight's been around since 1996.

It's diner food and I'm 10 blocks away. I called to see if I could cancel and was told my food already left. I said that was quick, considering Seamless told me an hour, and he said that Seamless just atomically puts an hour on the weekends. After another 30mins (11:50am) I called back and was told the guy has been in my building. Strange considering there was no call from my doorman or knock on my door. I told the guy that I basically expected cold food since it had been out for so long and just wanted to cancel. He said he didn't really care, he gets paid anyway, and then just hung up on me.Update - 12:07pm the delivery guy just rang my doorbell. That means that it took my food over 50mins to get 10 blocks, and that hour the guy told me Seamless just puts on there was actually completely accurate.These guys are rude, arrogant people who provide horrible service and don't care about the customer; evident by all the other horrible reviews.

(My 59th time, her 4th time). When we walked in I was reminded of an old fashioned type of diner. We were quickly seated and our dinner was started. Our waiter was honestly okay. He looked kind of sullen. He wasn't mean to us but he didn't greet us with a friendly smile or happy attitude. More or less he took our order and bought it over, never checked to see if things were okay, took our dessert order bought it over, bought me fresh coffee when I asked for it and bought our bill over. I wouldn't say he was terrible but a smile could have helped. The bathroom I used was kind of dingy looking. I think I might have mistakenly used the employee bathroom even though there was nothing to designate it as an employee bathroom. If it was an employee bathroom they should have a better bathroom being that they are working there. I didn't like the coffee but I didn't say anything because what could they do to make a cup of coffee better. Sometimes the coffee just sucks and I politely have a few sips and leave the rest on the table. My dinner wrap was alright. The vegetables were fresh but the black beans didn't taste that great. I did like the fact that they substituted mesculin greens if you didn't want to have french fries. For dessert my friend and I split the peanut butter cake. She didn't like it too much but I did love the cake. I might give this diner another shot again, I feel like I should have ordered a breakfast item and I probably would have liked the food better.",2,1,1

The food is served in generous portions but sometimes the bread will be a little stale or certain sides will not be available. The service here is friendly and cooperative and the lady who runs the register is really sweet. This is a good diner due to its location and the fact that it is a 24 hour eatery.,1,,

Updated review","My all time favorite diner in NYC. As a Jersey girl, I love diners. I haven't been here since summer 2014. Unfortunately they increased their price. My two favorite dishes and to be honest the only meals I order here have increased by $2. The ""Vegetarian Chili Omelette"" is now almost $10, and the ""Mucho Nachos with Shred Steak"" is now $14.95. By the way, you can find the nachos in the ""Specials"" menu (small white menu inserted in the middle of the big menu). All in all, I still love this diner. The food is still good. I'm still amazed by the steak last night, well-done but still juicy. A little pricey now for a diner but it's NYC so I can't complain too much.",1,,

They sat us down at a booth, but when they saw that I only wanted tea, they immediately told the manager and he said that we cant do that, we either needed to move to smaller table or order a min of 8 dollars to stay in the booth, which I think is pretty damn ridiculous and there wasn't anyone seeking a bigger table. the irony is that they're going for calling themselves a ""diner"" which symbolizes a friendly and simple atmosphere and a quick bite to eat, but they just turned down costumers who were seeking a thirst quencher.

The cashier didn't care and we asked for the manager several times, never had he decency to show up. We live and work nearby and have spent thousands of dollars there and never will again.

I'm sure the Hudson Yards project will change all that eventually, but we were perfectly happy with what we got. I got a grilled cheese with tomato and my husband got a greek wrap sandwich.

105,Michael R.,"Manhattan, NY",298,73,25,4.0,3/1/2016,"I'm a big 'Meetup-er'.  What is that? Well, I help to organize a few social groups on Meetup.com.  One of the hurdles that most Meetup organizers face is finding a nice reliable venue to use to host gatherings that doesn't charge you for it. Meaning that most venues in the city charge you to use their space, or make you commit to a minimum dollar amount that must be met by your group. If the amount isn't met then it's up to the organizer to pay the balance.  I'm reviewing the Skylight Diner for two reasons.  One is that they are very 'Meetup friendly', having hosted many different Meetup groups for years.  They don't charge to do so (of course with the expectation that people will eat and/or drinks), and their wait staff has always been friendly and attentive to my members at our group meetings.  One thing that I LOVE is that the waiters have no problem writing separate checks for everyone.  This is a very rare thing in NYC.  I've waited tables before and know it's a PITA, and it's very well appreciated, as sometimes I've hosted or attended Meetups at the Skylight that have upwards of 30 people. Having one bill given to the table would most definitely cause an ulcer to the organizer, as there will Always be people that underpay and the organizer will be left paying their tab.  The large area in the back of the diner is where groups always host their meetings, leaving the rest of the spacious front of the place for regular customers. I've been to the Skyline countless times and have always had good service and good food.  I'm a big fan of their Matzoh Ball Soup, and their Vegetarian Chili Omelette ain't too bad either.  Their food ain't 5-stars (hey, it's a DINER!), but it ain't 3-stars either.  Another Great Thing is their proximity to both Madison Square Garden and Penn Station.  Their prices are much better than their pricey Tick Tock Diner competition just an Avenue away on 8th. Oh, and the big AMC 34th Street is a 5 minute walk away, as well as the best audio/video/photo store in NYC, B&H. Nice clean bathrooms too, plus they're open 24/7!",3,,
106,Eric S.,"Amherst, MA",0,42,0,3.0,6/3/2016,"I want to like this place. Actually comforting and cozy, like how we want to think diners are. Classic ambiance, but freshly remodeled. Everything is clean. Waiter was friendly as heck and kept bringing out more coffee. It can be hard to get a second cup, but here a third comes with ease too. They need more wait staff though. Our Waiter was racing around. I asked for wheat bread, but got white. Pickle and slaw came well after the sandwich.They forgot to charge for my grapefruit half too. I had a meatloaf sandwich, and it was actually comforting. Cheap, crappy white bread with the uniformly molded lines on the crust. Gravy from a can. Meatloaf probably seasoned with instant bouillon. Huh. Somehow it was more than the sum of its parts. Other person had rigatoni in sauce. Yeah, not so sure. Pasta was a bit mushy, and the sauce had a disturbing orange hue to it. Tasted eerily like bottled Russian dressing and Velveeta may have been used in its production!Rolls were a bit stale. Appreciate that they at least don't wrap them in plastic!",,1,

On my last visit I came in on and ordered the steak quesadilla which was on special. The steak was delicious, very tender. The only thing I did not like about it was the onions in the quesadilla were huge. I had to pull most of them out. I would have liked the onions cut smaller. Overall, delicious.",,,
110,Sonya M.,"Chicago, IL",116,415,382,3.0,3/2/2016,"We stopped in for breakfast one morning on our way downtown. It was crowded but we only waited 5 minutes for a table. Our waiter came swiftly but he seemed a little out of it the entire length of our stay. He repeated the order more than 3 times and just didn't seem comfortable or confident in his job performance. That was a little off putting but hey... no big deal. The guy was doing his best so we left it alone.I ordered the scrambled eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast. The portion size was quite generous considering the location (NYC) and price. My friend ordered the french toast and we had so much food left over that we were able to give the leftovers (untouched) to a homeless person. The food was decent. It wasn't the best breakfast I've ever eaten but it wasn't horrendous either. I'd probably go back if given the choice if that says anything. My friend enjoyed her food as well so we left relatively satisfied.",1,,
111,Alexandria F.,"New York, NY",0,23,0,4.0,3/31/2016,"I am actually a fan of this diner. As a Brit to the core, that's tough to admit, but if you come to Midtown wanting a true diner experience, the Skylight Diner is it. Great for breakfast, lunch, dinner but also coming back home with a big group of girls after a hard night drinking, and wanting cheesy chips- this diner is great for that. The grilled cheese is pretty good, but the menu itself also has a pretty amazing selection for even the fussiest eaters. Reasonably priced, efficient service and a cool, Grease Is The Word-inspired diner decor. I definitely recommend the cheesecake/the desert menu in general- Skylight is one of the few places in Midtown you can pop in just for a coffee and a whopping great slice of cake that isn't an overpriced bakery or a Starbucks. Also, perfect, large tables for big groups and if you say at the start you want to pay on separate tabs they will pop your orders into separate bills for you that you just take to the cashier when you're ready.",1,,

Server was ok, but never took drink orders. Everything from the French fries to the meat loaf was horrible and we are not picky eaters by any means. I struggled to cut my broccoli with a knife. It was rubbery as though it sat under a heat lamp after being boiled. The meat loaf was nearly floating in gross gravy. Everything was bland and flavorless.

I used their website to order, so I'm approaching this with a slightly different perspective from other reviewers.The layout was clean, simple, and effective. One gripe was that it said that my order wouldn't be started until the time I chose (to have it delivered hot exactly when I wanted) - but the first available time was nearly an hour off. And that was for STARTING my food!I wound up pleasantly surprised in that regard - apparently, that time means nothing, because I was eating in under half an hour. I like the speed, but pulling a ""Scotty"" on me was not appreciated. And I promise that that will be the only Star Trek reference in this review.So, food. I got the chicken parm, which came with fries. As the review score indicates, this meal was A-OK. The chicken was cooked properly, which is about all I can ask. The breading was decent, not soggy, but not particularly seasoned. At least, not that I could tell - I got a weird, occasional mouthful of giant onion chunk from the sauce, so it mucked up my tastebuds a little. When that wasn't happening though, it was pretty good!Value-wise, I think I could have done better. Chicken parm + passable tip comes out to around $14-15, but it was like 2 AM and I didn't know the neighborhood, so I'll file this as a learning experience.",1,1,

Mexican Frittata [$9.95]I went with a Mexican frittata, which featured a huge disc of egg, cheddar cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes, and onions. It came with two slices of buttered wheat toast. Huevos Rancheros [$8.95]The GF had the huevos rancheroes which came with creamy black beans, crisp corn tortillas topped with green chile salsa, and lightly fried eggs.

My wife mentioned it to our server and he offered to make another.  But with time short, I couldn't risk it again.  He didn't charge the extra for the chicken.  Service was quick but our server was not at all friendly.  His people skills are quite lacking.

136,Sara L.,"Manhattan, NY",710,534,3377,3.0,11/10/2013,"Skylight Diner probably gets most of its business when there is a major event going on at the Javits Center. On our break from Comic Con, a group of us starving and tired souls were desperate for food but also a proper place to sit down and eat. Of course, every possible restaurant within a few blocks radius of Javits was packed with Comic Con enthusiasts, so we decided to walk a little further out. Then comes Skylight Diner, which appeared to us as a sanctuary. The diner was packed, but the wait was a tolerable 20 minutes. Stumbling upon this place for the first time, with very little expectation, the experience was surprisingly not bad at all. Skylight has a rather outdated, 90s appearance but while being quite spacious and relatively clean. It was 3PM in the afternoon, bustling with many customers. We eventually got seated after a surprisingly tolerable wait. Our waiter was attentive to us the entire time. Two of my guests had a cheeseburger, another had the chicken parm sandwich, I had the gyro wrap. Our dishes came with a side of fries. The food took about 25 minutes to prepare, but they gave us a forewarning that the kitchen was backed up. We were all pretty happy with our food. I enjoyed my gyro wrap very much, and I'll note that the portion size was very generous. The fries were also great. All in all, I was pleased with this choice. Everyone was in happy agreement with the food, especially while having no expectations. Being that we were all very hungry, the food left us surely satisfied. I can't say for sure if being very hungry clouded our judgement a little, but I can say for certain that the food didn't disappoint and was well-priced. Taking the fact of how busy it was that afternoon, the service was satisfactory. If you are on a break from a Javits convention, you should definitely consider walking a few more blocks over to Skylight.

I'm a turkey club junkie w/ wheat toast dry and Russian dressing on the side next to my fries.  I needed a garden hose strapped to my mouth to prevent the dry lip smacking due to the painfully dry oven roasted turkey breast aughhh.

145,Huhdar H.,"Brooklyn, NY",46,12,1,1.0,5/19/2017,"Absolutely awful. I am vegetarian and ordered the supposedly ""Famous Chili"" - it was horrid. Tasted straight out of a can of cheap beans with absolutely no flavor. It was supposed to come with ""diced-chopped"" onions and shredded ""cheddar"" cheese - It was all soupy with tiny pieces of wet onion (like five!) so tiny you could hardly tell or taste it was an onion. And the cheese - which was a tiny sliver of a melted portion and tasted exactly like Mozzarella - and I found out when I mentioned it to the waiter that it in fact was mozzarella - and that they really use a ""cheese mixture"". Plus there were chunks of vegetables like celery and zucchini in it that tasted nasty, and had not been mentioned on the menu. It was served in a tiny bowl usually used for French onion soup. I also got the egg cream soda, vanilla flavor, which really tasted like watered down seltzer with milk and had horrible consistency. If they managed to mess up the smaller menu items this bad, I'd hate to see what they do the main course food items. I was horrified by the food and I would never come back. Stay far away!!!",,,

They make a righteous grilled cheese sandwich too.The sodas are extremely iced and since the servers are usually very busy (refills are few and far between), your best bet is to order them with no ice. The coffee is great, very flavorful without being burnt. You will usually end up with 2 or 3 refills per seating no problem.Service can be hit or miss. Some servers are really top notch and make sure everything is as ordered. Some servers have poor time management and disappear for great lengths of time, make substituions on the fly without asking you if the kitchen runs out of something  (like giving bread instead of a requested wrap for a sandwich), or need to be tracked down in order to get your table check to pay them.More times than not, you get good service,  which is why I still go there for the reasonably priced,  good food.",,,

The soup, appetizer and the rest of the food was brought out ALL at once, 20 min later. The food wasn't too bad but the bed of lettuce, salary and carrots which were on the plate with mozzarella sticks were not fresh and clearly were a day or 2 old, the turkey was too dry to eat, the tomato and lettuce in the sandwich wasn't fresh either and not worth the 13$, the French fries were also extremely dry.

I am not too sure what it is on a daily basis but I can attest for what it was last night. My waitress was no where near courteous about the service she gave my friends & I. She only appeared to take our orders and bring the food, not to mention she forgot about the drinks we ordered and only brought after the food came and was reminded by me. You would like it was crowded and maybe she had too many tables, that was not the case at all. She was not swamped when we were leaving I saw how friendly and conversant she was with another table and made me reconsider her tip altogether. Maybe this is the reason she didn't give us her name in the beginning. The food was not mind-blowing but it was good enough to satiate your hunger. The term ""our famous"" bacon cheeseburger was mislead. The burger itself wasn't flavorful and was very greasy. It was good but not enjoyable. I think the service here needs to be upgraded because business will always come there way. If you walk a little further up 34th or 9th there are better establishments you find.",1,,

In other words, just go to McDonald's if your main goal is either to stave off hunger or eat breakfast in the afternoon. There's one a block up and a block down.If you're looking for an All-American diner in midtown Manhattan, this ain't it. The only novelty about this place was that every order was called out over the intercom. Other than that, the place was disappointing. At least I did not suffer alone.My friends called attention to the diner's appearance: noticeably unkempt, with grime along the ceiling, missed spots on the tabletop, and dirty paper towels under the table. I'd have been willing to stand an extra minute or two for a cleaner booth.The service was okay. Our water came promptly (with no straws, however), and our waitress wasn't rude.We waited a while for our food, which is understandable because the diner was busy with fellow Comic-Con patrons. I ordered the steak and eggs, which arrived severely under-seasoned. The salt and pepper shakers were practically glued to my hand the entire meal. For $15.95, I expected at the very least a meal with zest.Some people live by the mantra ""No regrets."" If you are one of them, you should avoid this diner.

It gets a 3 because I at least enjoyed the onion rings, the crispy bacon on the burger and some of the chili cheese fries, but it's not enough that I would come back just for that.",1,,1
190,Maribelle V.,"Manhattan, NY",10,21,0,2.0,7/10/2014,"I have been a customer for years now....but the last few times I was there.....I was disappointed.The attendant at the front desk (a female individual) never smiles.  I had the unfortunate experience on 3 occasions were she wanted to sit me in the back where you have to climb 2 steps, but even those were a challenge with my foot operation.  I was with a cane both times and have been having difficulty with stairs...even two steps so I was not pleased.  I left.The food....depending on what you order.....and who may be the cook on that day....can vary from good to poor quality.  Sometimes I have been served cold food and it is supposed to be hot.  Sometimes the vegetables are too soggy, the chicken overcooked and the toast burnt.Still....it is an average place to get somewhat of a meal since there is not much else nearby unless you want chain restaurant food, Chinese or deli sandwiches.",1,,

192,Saravanan S.,"Downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",13,5,1,3.0,3/13/2015,Was starving early in the morning and decided to grab breakfast early! Thank god skylight diner was openGood breakfast and good atmosphere. Staff members were friendly and the meals were tasty. Had the pancakes and corned beef with some eggs and toast.,,,
193,Gabe M.,"New York, NY",136,8,1,1.0,1/14/2017,"The grilled chicken was bearable, as were the fries (though a few we're just raw potatoes). Otherwise, I got dirty silverware and a used napkin, the lettuce was slimy, the bathroom was unusable, and worst of all, it's overpriced.",,,
194,Alex R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",23,63,146,2.0,11/23/2015,"I came here with my friend. It was Sunday evening and the place wasn't packed.We ordered 2 burgers - Italian and Blue cheese. Nothing special. But I have never met that buns were cold! Please, don't keep them in refrigerator. It's disgusting to eat a cold food, when it has to be warm.",,,
195,Ernest Z.,"Islandia, NY",17,6,0,1.0,7/27/2015,"HORRIFIC SERVICE, I would NEVER expect to wait as long as i did in a packed diner forget one that only had a few people in it. When we finally got our menu and ordered it took forever to receive our food and those were the only 2 times the waiter was seen!!! Never came back to check in, no refill on drinks NOTHING! WOULD NEVER GO BACK!!",1,,
196,Tiffany L.,"New York, NY",121,1106,2,3.0,8/2/2012,"I've been here 3 times now. The food isn't phenomenal, but the fact that it's open 24/7, there's never a wait, and you get a ton of food for relatively little (considering it's NYC) it's a great option!  Classic diner with a HUGE menu (literally and in food options.)Hubby and I came here for a double date before heading over to AMC to watch ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (sidenote: the IMAX in that theater is NOT a true IMAX - go to the one in Lincoln Center instead!!) Service is quick and they let you make side substitutions on your order. The pancakes are yummy!",,,
197,Erin J.,"San Antonio, TX",0,14,0,3.0,1/16/2016,"The food is good, classic diner food in big portions. I would rate it hire, but both my mom and I have had digestive issues from this place on separate occasions...",,,
198,Leslie C.,"Dallas, TX",139,315,30,3.0,10/30/2013,"Good diner (typical NYC diner food), near Javits Convention Center, good selection, decent service, solid 3 stars.",2,,1
199,Shang S.,"New York, NY",172,413,90,3.0,4/17/2015,"This is my no-fuss go-to diner for grabbing a morning breakfast. The food is exactly as you'd expect, it's not GREAT food, but it's very filling, and there's always a place to be seated and service is friendly enough.",2,1,2
