Went on a Sunday afternoon to watch football and celebrate a friend's bday. Cocktails are $16 and really weak. Burgers $16 and just ok (5 Guys is better). Place was playing music so loud we couldn't even talk, and there's no dance floor. Why do that?",2
2,,8/4/2018,134,1,"New York, NY",Victoria L.,0,1.0,21,"Went in on a Friday night at around 10:30. Place was practically empty and there was only 1 bartender working the huge bar. Waited a good 5 minutes for 2 beers. I've never seen such a empty fridge either behind the bar. What should normally be stocked to the brim with a variety of bottled beers and mixers and garnishes was nearly empty with maybe a few bottles here and there. Is The Ainsworth closing down? Because based on my review and the most recent one, looks like they're just running through the end of their lease and closing shop. It's depressing. Also, upon entering, the hostess asked me if we had a reservation and it was 90% empty. I mean... was that necessary? I get it's part of her job but there's a line drawn when it's being ridiculous. Definitely would make sense if this place were on the verge of closing but if it's not, somebody call John Taffer of Bar Rescue.",2

Everything was delicious! I had the famous Mac and cheese burger which is fried Mac & cheese, with a patty and cheesy macaroni spilling out. OMG the most guilty pleasure for a cheat day haha. I also tried their 24k golden wings which were really good! Taste a little like buffalo wings but really good and saucy. The thought of it being ""gold"" is mental lol. The candied bacon was something by tastebuds we're excited about. It made me want to go home and attempt to recreate it lol. Also tried the Brussels sprouts with bacon, a ribeye sandwich, the side of macaroni and a few drinks. Top notch everything in my opinion. The chefs took their time with my table to perfect every dish!The only downside was that I was not informed that they would close early. Apparently they close early when it is not busy. They said they lose more money. They were scheduled to close at 1 am and closed at about 11 pm. With that being said I was not notified that the kitchen would close early. As a dessert lover and connoisseur, I was eager to try their desert. I was sadly disappointed. Other than that everything was fantastic! I would give 4.5 stars but half stars are not an option lol. High recommend!I posted the menu because items slightly differ online and each location =]",2
4,5,3/9/2018,815,2,"Brooklyn, NY",Ingrid S.,10944,4.0,1318,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars but upping it to 4 because of their famous Mac and Cheese Burger. Ambiance - Bro-bar but an upscale bro bar with plenty of televisions on for sports. I thought about it quite a bit. But this is like where that guy from college was pounding back 40s of Olde English and slamming his head against the wall and then suddenly you accidentally see him ten years later and he's miraculously succeeded in life and is now loaded and drinking away and eating cheeseburgers at The Ainsworth. Maybe I have way too vivid of an imagination. Maybe I hit it dead on the nail. But it didn't stop me from visiting the place and checking out their menu.For my drink I went with a maple old fashioned. It was a little too sweet than I particularly like for old fashioneds but I still drank it and I wasn't planning on getting drunk for the evening anyway. They do have a nice happy hour though until 7pm of $1 oysters, $5 draft beers, and half off wines.Appetizers - We split both an order of oysters and the Hanger Steak Flatbread. The oysters were oysters. Nice presentation but I can never eat too many of these guys. The flatbread was one of my favorite parts of the evening. Steak was flavorful and chopped up with a great sauce and liberally sprinkled with gorgonzola cheese. For our meals we split the mac and cheese burger and the porterhouse steak. The burger is impressive. It's definitely shareable. It was juicy and cooked right, the mac on it is tasty and definitely not dry and there's some kind of deep fried mac layer as well. One thing it could have used that's random is a sauce base to cut the carb on carb on carb action. Maybe a chipotle aioli or a hot sauce to cut it but something. Or even pickles on the side. But it was good. The steak on the other hand wasn't so good and so not good that it almost made this review 3 stars worthy. It was just a really poor cut of meat and not worth the price tag. Half the steak was ribboned with thick layers of fat in between. I took half of it to go with me and even the next day, it was barely edible. The chimichurri sauce that its also served with is incredibly oily. Like 90 percent oil, 10 percent cilantro and fresh herbs ratio kind of chimichurri. Service was outstanding however and makes this place pleasant to dine in. I learned about the burger challenge. Brace yourself. But if you finish three mac and cheese burgers stacked on top of each other (mind you I was only able to eat half of this sucker) with a side of fries and a pickle spear you get the meal for free and $500 in cash. They only note that professional food competition eaters are not able to participate for the cash prize. But hey, remember my first paragraph? I bet that guy can finish the burger challenge.",8

Fun Friday evening hanging out with families.The place was loud so we asked to sit by the window near the entrance. Service was quick as the waitress took our order promptly and the food came out in 15 mins.Appetizers:Wings: we ordered mild and it definitely had a kick to it. There were 8 pieces per order and they were gone in a minute!Flatbread: it wasn't bad but I liked it when the crust was crispy. It was a bit soft on the edge.Guacamole: chips were so good and guacamole was very fresh!! We literally took the very last tiny bit before the waiter took the tray away.Beef sliders: yum!Main dishes: well, everyone ordered the burger except I ordered the apple poppy which was awesome!! Loved having some fruit and raisins and pecan in my salad. Portion was generous.So going back to the burgers. Each one came with lots of fries and you can ask for truffle fries instead of regular ones. Both were good. The hanger and classic burger were juicy. The Mac & Cheese burger looked very messy and it was very messy to eat! We had lots of fries left as we were all in food coma.",1
7,,9/8/2018,67,,"El Paso, TX",Alexandra G.,87,3.0,28,"The food far outweighed the service at this restaurant and bar. We had originally made reservations at a different Ainsworth and were relocated to this place. It wasn't a big deal to us because the commute was about the same for both places and they threw in a free round of drinks. Not too shabby. When we walked in we couldn't find a hostess so we walked around looking for someone to help us. Finally, we were seated and order our drinks. They were pretty good, nothing out of the ordinary. We order the famous Mac and Cheese burger and were soo satisfied with it! It was extremely delicious. I would come back just for that. However, they could work on their service. I think tweaking that part would make this place that much better.",1

I ordered a Cobb Salad, and my friend had a Chicken BLT.  It took forever to get the food, and they initially got our order wrong.  The had my salad, no sandwich and flatbreads we didn't order. They took the food back, it was meant for another table.  Again, Service was very slow, and not good, the food, meh.  Too many good places in NYC, so this won't warrant a second visit.",3

The atmosphere feels like a high-end sports bar - similar to Bounce.A great menu with delicious burgers and appetizers. Good drinks too. However, the service is pretty awful. While the restaurant was pretty empty, we were asked to move tables after ordering to accommodate other parties coming...Despite the snippy server and long wait-time for food, I'd come back for the mac & cheese burger.",1

13,12,5/14/2017,319,6,"New Hyde Park, NY",Josh G.,6053,4.0,582,"Thank you, Facebook. For when I can't find local food places via activity on Yelp, I turn to those that post pics and videos and links of foodish adventures. That's basically how I got word of The Ainsworth. The name is fine and the place looked great from this ""Insider"" video, but what grabbed my tastebuds and eventually led me here was the mac & cheese burger. Words won't do justice. Go to the pics.Hey wait! Before you leave you might as well read the rest of the review as to why The Ainsworth received four Yelp-filled stars. I mean pictures are a little better than my writing, but trust me when I say The A had a prestigious and chic vibe that crossed over nicely with the best attributes of a sports bar (the bar and the sports, of course). Our waitress was a friendly gal and did well in keeping up with our demands (not like my mother and I are that demanding...well, at least I'm not). We ordered drinks, an app, and a few entrees (one you already know).The beer menu wasn't super vast but they did have Ommegang's Witbier to start things off. Mi madre had her wine. Our appetizer would actually be considered a ""small plate"" under The Ainsworth's medium-sized menu, though it means little to me as long as the food is good. And our sweet & spicy tri-color cauliflower did the trick with a more tangy than hot sauce along with tender veggies.Main course time! Starting with the item you don't know, mama got steak tacos complete with guac, chipotle adobo, and lime. I took a bite and was pleased (but more importantly so was she). If you're still with me it's finally time for the burger unveiling. Of course I went for the mac & cheese style and it came pretty close to my expectations. Gooey macaroni with cheese oozing out from all over the patty. Speaking of patty, there was a fried mac & cheese patty loaded onto the burger as well. Speaking even further about the patty, it was a bit on the small side. But the juicy, cheesy flavor was there. Fries and a pickle rounded out my rectangular platter.Overall, The Ainsworth is worthy of its burger credentials and warrants a visit even with its Manhattan prices. Consider it next time you find yourself strolling the city, if for no other reason then as a way to say ""I've been there!"" when you see the social media video.",15
14,2,5/4/2018,467,,"Queens, NY",Sha'velle D.,490,5.0,83,This is my second time being here the first time I didn't write a review but I had the Mac and cheese burger with fries and that was amazing although I wasn't able to finish the actual burger in one serving. It took me about two days. So I'll say that's worth your money especially if you're on a budget. Today my boyfriend and I came to try the 24K gold wings. We ordered the 10 piece for $30 and we had  two drinks I can't recall what drink it was but it was sweet and good. The wings I was actually excited to try and nervous at the same time. They taste like chipotle honey bbq. I didn't know what to expect but I was thinking they would probably be gross but I was surprised. Would definitely recommend you guys try it. Doesn't hurt to try anything once. Either you'll like it or you don't and it's definitely an Instagram worthy dish. Don't go in to this thinking just because of the color or the idea of it being gold that it I'll somehow not taste like wings. They are literally gold chicken wings.,9

(I'm talking about The Ainsworth, if that wasn't clear. It should've been, since you're reading reviews of The Ainsworth.)This is ostensibly a sports bar, and the flatscreens, burger-driven menu, and rowdy crowd would tend to agree. However, the selectively enforced dress code, the $16 cocktails, and the weak pours of beer are understandably confusing.Thankfully, they also offer friendly service with a smile (although it is strangely slow, even when the bar is not packed), a passable selection of beer, and a convenient and fairly comfortable place to gather...especially if you need a few cocktails/beers before eating entirely too much meat at Wolfgang's next door.",23
16,2,4/1/2017,148,2,"Long Island, NY",Lawrence C.,995,3.0,357,"Super courteous and attentive staff here. I waited to meet the guys before a concert at The Garden and was seated with a bottle of Perrier. It was on a Sunday at 5pm so the dining area was midfull. I had the Goose Island IPA (India Pale Ale) which was light and crisp and went well with appys and the entree. We shared 3 apps. The wings were average. Calamari was great, neither overdone nor soggy and seasoned well. The sliders tasted great, not overdone. My bud had the Mac n Cheese which was cooked medium. He stated the sliders were better because it was way too dry. I had the same burger medium rare which was juicy and perfect. I cut it in half and was able to handle all that cheese, mac n lettuce tomato. I really should have stopped after 1/2. Friend's friend had Chicken BLT which has avocado and garlic which he enjoyed.The bar was full of patrons watching the Kentucky Wichita State game. I had a great experience.  Would go back for drinks at the bar.  Advise to anyone getting a burger, order it medium rare or rare.",6

Shoot it was super packed...jeez christ barely any walking room. My other colleague was sitting towards the back of the house by the bar.I got the green beer and took me awhile to drink it then sadly the beer got warm and bitter so my colleague drank it to not waste it lol. The music was pretty good with a mixture of old and new. The minus is the bathroom was on the other side where there was a mob of people in the path.,9

I ordered 2 gin and gingers, and was given two $30 drinks with Bombay Sapphire... When I absolutely never would have ordered the most expensive top shelf alcohol. I would recommend either not coming here, or specifically specifying what alcohol you want. I find it incredibly rude to presume that you want the most expensive alcohol, especially when you aren't asked at all what kind you want.  I wasn't ready to spend that much on drinks and my bartender automatically charged my for two Bombay Sapphires.It was way more than what I was prepared to spend, and if you want to be overcharged for top shelf alcohol and pay more than you are comfortable with, then come here. Apparently the bartenders don't care how much they charge you and just want big tips.  I've never automatically been charged for top shelf liquor without prior asking, so I was really upset and felt incredibly uncomfortable. If you come here for drinks, be warned, ask the price before you order, otherwise the bartender will assume you don't care and will charge you as much as possible.",11

20,2,2/24/2017,277,2,"Boston, MA",Melissa H.,416,3.0,113,"If your not specifically looking for this place you may walk right by it, there isn't a ton of signage outside and it's nestled toward the middle of 26th street. Once you get inside though the decor is great, plenty of chandeliers hanging and simple wood decor. Now getting to the part we all want to hear about... the food. Naturally I ordered the mac and cheese burger and my father ordered the French onion burger. We had also ordered chips and guacamole to split which were pretty subpar, not really worth mentioning but I did. The mac and cheese burger far exceeded my expectations and was a culinary treat, definitely too much for me to finish but I appreciate the size. My fathers burger however was quite mediocre and not even that big. He was able to finish it no problem and wound up having a couple bites of mine. Service was also subpar for it not being very busy our waiter wasn't very attentive. Overall: if your coming for the mac and cheese burger you won't be disappointed, if your coming for anything else well then at least I warned you.",2
21,1,1/9/2018,220,2,"Conshohocken, PA",Brooke M.,99,1.0,126,"I came here for New Year's Even this year and it was hands down the worst NYE experience of my life. If the service on a daily basis is as it was on on NYE, I would recommend that you do not come here either!I fortunately had a VIP ticket which gave me access to an expedited line but some of my friends did not. The line for general admission tickets was over an hour long in single digit degree weather which is absolutely inhumane. My friends were told that the venue was almost ""at capacity"" which makes no sense since this was a ticketed event. The bouncer finally just gave up and let anyone and everyone in the doors. The VIP experience is far from any VIP experience I have ever had (and not in a good way). The VIP room we specifically payed for was roped off doing nothing to prevent those with General Admission tickets from coming in the space. I normally would care less but being that we paid more money to avoid being pushed and shoved, it was annoying that literally anyone could come in the area.When we purchased our tickets, the website clearly stated that there would be appetizers. The only food that was passed through our section in the Red Lounge was one tray of mozzarella sticks and then cookies that were given to those who purchased tables (we did not have a table so these were not for us). By 1 am, the coat check was nothing short of absolute chaos. My coat tickets were taken from me by the coat check girls and after still not receiving my coat 25 minutes later, I was taken into the basement to find the coats myself. When they weren't down there, I was told to get back in the coat check line and try again. When I finally got back to the front of the original coat check line that was still in complete disorder (at this point, 45 minutes later), I was told that my coats were no longer there and someone must have taken them. After some persuading, I was let back into the coat check to look for the coats myself which I confirmed were not there after going through every coat on the racks as well as those that had been tossed negligently on the floor. My friends finally got a hold of me to tell me that our coats were on a separate rack against a wall by the main door not being looked after. My boyfriend went to take my coat off the rack and out of no where, was told to ""put the fucking coat down"" by an employee. What should have been an easy task was turned into an hour and a half long goose chase looking for four coats. Needless to say, I will never come back to the Ainsworth and I recommend that you definitely do not come here if you are looking for a fun place to go on NYE. You will just leave as discouraged as me, my friends, and all the random people I was talking to over the course of the night. I have been to other nightclubs in the city on NYE that were well managed and provided everything that they promised unlike this place.",8
22,,7/8/2018,0,,"New York, NY",Stefan S.,0,1.0,2,"Overall, poor service and average food.We went to the Ainsworth for an ""all-white"" day party on Sat July 7th. The brunch menu was $40/person and included one entree (no sides included) plus 2 drinks. Not unreasonable but not exciting either. The brunch menu itself was very limited from the regular menu, so no mac n cheese burger option there.I tried ordering a drink called ""The Chelsea"" but the bartender informed me that they ran out of ingredients to make the drink. This was at 6pm. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria but it easily took 30 mins for us to get it. In the meantime, we had already ordered and finished our food.Our waitress, who never gave her name, was very inattentive. We asked the maitre d' a couple of times for the waitress to come by our table but that didn't help. On the rare occasions we did interact with her, she never bothered to say ""hi"", ""thanks"" or ""you're welcome"". It seemed as though she did not want to be working there that night. When we got the check, they automatically included an 18% gratuity. We were only a table of 3 so I did not understand why they did this. If it were up to me, I would have left only 5% for the poor service we received.",2
23,1,1/8/2018,413,,"Groton, CT",Dacia D.,5,1.0,2,"Start the new year off right...sick as a dog courtesy of The Ainsworth. After paying $150 per ticket (there were six of us) we were made to wait outside in line for over an hour. I understand having to wait for processing or even if they were too crowded BUT the bouncer actually said they were ""holding the door"" for no reason. We arrived at 10 and waited and hour AND our friends that arrived at 9 were also made to wait for 45 min. One of our friends was pregnant so we requested to buy a table to be allowed inside and were told ""no amount of money is getting you in"". It seems like they didn't want people to take advantage of the open bar they had paid for. Long story short, don't go here for NYE it's a waste of money and will get you nice and sick for the new year. P.S. Went here for dinner earlier in the week and service was slow and orders had mistakes. So that's just one more reason not to support a restaurant that thinks it's okay to leave paying guests outside in severe freezing weather.",5

I like how when they play a big game that they then have a dj in between during commercials but they play everything so loud, people try and talk over and it causes the whole place to be a decibel above bearable. The food is pretty good and I tend to find it pretty consistent. I would definitely go with the burgers. Those are what shine here. They don't really ever have any sort of drink special...that's a bit annoying as things are just always on the pricey side. And when it's football season, specials are appreciated.

Should've taken that as a hint.When we received the menus we asked about drinks. The waitress showed us the menu and told us ""beers on right and cocktails on left"". One of us in our party ordered a cocktail, however they were out of that one. Okay so we asked about another cocktail and then she says they're all out of cocktails completely.  And they only had one kind of beer available apparently.....at a sports bar. Why even bother with letting us look over the drink menu?By the time our food arrived, one in our party did not get the buns for their burger (they did order it) and one did not get their meal at all. We waited a bit before proceeding to eat and share our meals as we could not flag down our waitress. By the time she came around, we told her about the buns and the missing entree. She came back later and said the entree is being rushed. About 20-30 min later the meal finally arrived.When it came time for the check, they comped us for the entree, but charged us for a drink we never ordered. They did take the charge off when we told them, but wow.I know people have an off day and I don't like leaving bad reviews, however this warrants it. Not great service for a bar in New York City.",1

It was massive, I would honestly recommend splitting it with someone. I got the burger medium and it was too dry. My friend got it medium rare and it was much better. The Mac and cheese was delicious. Overall it was ok, I don't think I would order it again. It was also difficult to eat, but that was to be expected. Went here on a quiet Wednesday night with a friend. We made a reservation but the place was almost empty since it was 9. The service wasn't great, we had to flag down our waitress twice.

Restaurant itself is well decorated, plush booths and chairs, large bar to the side, and TVs all around so you never miss whichever game is on.For the meal got an Egg White Omelette ($15) and a Bloody Mary ($14). A bit on the pricey end of things, yet held out hope on the flavor. The omelette is fairly large, served with home fries and toast. A delicious balance of feta, spinach, and tomatoes within the egg. Bloody Mary was made perfectly - just the right amount of spice and vodka, with several olives and a celery stick. Servers here continuously check up on you and the food came out in 20 minutes. If the price point wasn't so high I'd probably come here often. Also, can see how the place can become packed on game nights.",1

Mac N' Cheese burger was to die for and still remains by far my favorite burger of all time! Also try the taco tuesdays, I had the chicken and shortbread both were fantastic. Truffle fries were good but a bit drowned in truffle oil so choose wisely. Prices are great for the city. The Ainsworth is must for everyone! You won't regret it.",

My orginal order were artichokes and salmon tartar. To my surprise, they were 86 on the tartar; so I placed and order for artichokes and broccoli starters. Was surprise on how large the plating were for starters. Both dishes looked very appealing to the eye but don't let that fooled you. What I tasted was just grease and lots of it. Tried deeping them in sauce in hope to cut down on the grease but it did no good, in the end I couldn't finish my food. 2 rose and 2 dishes came to $70 including tips (service was wonderful).On service alone, I would definitely come back.

And of course... you're surrounded by a bunch of people... who look like they went to 'Bama.  Sorry (not sorry).  All the guys had plaid shirts with Patagonia vests and khakis... the girls dressed like they were casually at the club.  The last two times I went, I was the only minority other than the bouncers.  Once when I went specifically for a football game, my guests were happy to feel the energy of being in a Bama bar... but other than being in that situation again, I will not be back.",2

We got the Ainsworth Sangria to share with our other two friends and I also got the Fall'n For You cocktail since it had Hennessy in it.

And the front doors are beautiful!-Food- This is where the stars come off... I ordered the buffalo chicken tacos, which come three per order,  and requested the bleu cheese on the side (I like to control the amount of sauce haha). Firstly, there was not much chicken in the tacos. They were mostly filled with garnish, and empty space. The shredded chicken was very dry, even with the buffalo sauce on it, and even after I added the bleu cheese sauce. The tortillas used for the shell were very bland, and it was overall not very good.-Service- The hostess, Monique, was great. We arrived here around 12pm, and she kindly advised us that there were a lot of reservations so we would ""only"" have the table until 4 which was MORE than enough time! Our server was very kind as well. She kept the drinks flowing the whole time.-Price- Overpriced in my opinion based mostly on the amount of food and partially on the quality/taste-Did Not Like- The chicken was so dry :(-Recommended?- I'll pass",11

Mac n cheese lovers dream come true. Mac n cheese could have been flavored with a bit more spices, salt, pepper, but nonetheless still amazingly cheesy. Reason why I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the service & price. I felt like ordering the drinks and app took a bit longer than normal. It came out to $230 something(?) for 4 of us.

I had a group of 10, the happy hour special includes $5 dollar drafts, but 3 of the 6 taps are mysteriously out. How can an upscale bar in NYC be 'out' of 50% of their advertised happy hour beer. I suspect that the taps magically got refilled after the happy hour special ended but was having such a bad time it wasn't worth it to spitefully stay and see if it was true. The bud light draft was warm and stale, the bud light bottles had been put in ice too late so the bottle outside was starting to become cold but the beer inside was warm. The beer list wasn't accurate either, they didn't have coors light somehow, or 2 of the other beers I asked for. Is the bar having a cashflow issue that they can't properly stock beer, or is a manager that is too inept to correctly forecast how much beer they will need?  It was taking about half an hour between when we ordered a drink until the drinks came, so we started ordering a new drink when the waitress came so that we could at least be assured we could get 1 drink every half hour, which she got VERY hissy about. But she also wasn't checking if we needed anything so it was the quickest way for us to possibly get served.Additionally, from a health standpoint All 8 of the water glasses on our table were dirty, smudged, and had lipstick and fingerprints all over them.",2

The DJs play amazing music all night and is a great place to go, not just after work but at night as well for a good bite and some great time with friends. The food menu is really good as well, from their pressed chicken to their steaks, as well as their mac n cheese burger. They all taste pretty good, and they have an extensive drink list as well. The layout of the space is great because if you are there for dinner, you are a bit segmented from those who are there to just hang out at the bar. The noise gets a bit high, but the space is more of a clubstaurant, so you can't really expect quietness from such an establishment.

I'm fairly certain there are no other establishments that check off all 4 of these boxes.Even for the less narrowly-minded/focused, this is a great place to go with some friends, especially on a Sunday during NFL season (or Saturday if NCAAF is your thing), and get some actual food with an unobstructed view of as many games as you need to keep your eye on.It's not Michelin Star cuisine, and I'm sure there are plenty of reviews here deriding the ""crowd"" The Ainsworth attracts, but I'd beg of you to assess your priorities, and if they're aligned with what the place offers, just go for it.",1

We came here after a horrible experience at our 1st choice (a place on 28th st & 11th ave - you do the math, I'm not granting them a review b/c they're not worthy). After some research and a recommendation from a friend, we walked up to The Ainsworth. It was gorgeous inside, freezing A/C (which I love), TVs everywhere but still felt classy enough to sit and enjoy a date or a conversation without the typical sports bar atmosphere. Since there were no major games on, it wasn't packed or even really very busy. Top 40 music playing over the loud speakers with a mix of everything. We also walked in fairly early on so there weren't many people which helped us grab 4 seats at the bar. The bartenders were awesome. The drinks were awesome. Between our group, we tried the Mr. Moore & The Chelsea-delicious. And I typically don't like ""exotic"" drinks with a lot of ingredients but the ingredients in both of those drinks just worked so well together. I was starving and ordered the Caprese burger-amazing. It came out piping hot with french fries in less than 15 minutes. We also ordered a massive amount of appetizers-again, piping hot and delicious. We stayed for a pretty long time, watched as the bar filled up some, but the tables were still pretty empty when we left...but that's fine for me.Was it expensive? Yes. And I don't believe we ever received any happy hour prices-matter of fact, never saw or heard any mention of happy hour. So we paid the price b/c we know NYC. And quite honestly, the more we drank, the less we cared that the drinks were $15 b/c they were so on point. Was my burger worth $17? Probably not but I paid it, so nothing I can do about it now.

In that they're open late, I strolled in close to midnight on a Friday night and gave it a whirl. Spoiler alert? It's a unique menu item, but the execution is just okay. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?The Ainsworth is an interesting hybrid of somewhat classy dining establishment, bar, and maybe kinda sorta club? Around midnight on a friday night while the kitchen was still open and I sat at the bar, the music was pumping pretty loud and a majority of the patrons were simply sipping on drinks. My bartender was great, and while the music eventually grew to be annoying, I can't fault The Ainsworth for catering to the late night crowd in the name of trying to sell drinks. If you're looking for a quiet late night sit down go elsewhere, but I wasn't. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?$15.00 is usually my cap when it comes to a sit down burger, so when i saw that the Mac and Cheese Burger was priced at $16.00 my heart sank a little. However, it should be known, while it isn't pictured, that this burger comes with a more than healthy amount of thick cut steak fries, and in that the burger itself is more than significant, I was fine handing over $16.00 for this mountain of goodies. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?It was here at The Ainsworth stumbled a bit. First and foremost, let it be known that a mac and cheese burger is a ridiculously good idea, and I'm frankly stunned that I hadn't before seen something like this in Texas where I've been living the past two years. Let's break it down:The bun: This was a weak spot. Considering all that's contained within the bun, there was simply too much of it, and I ended up not eating half considering it was really nothing special. Would have loved if it had been toasted a bit or even buttered as nutritional value is obviously already out the window if this is what you're ordering. The patty: Honestly nothing special. I imagine the kitchen was so stoked when they came up with the idea that the beef patty was an afterthought, and it seems like the burger relied heavily upon the mac n cheese for flavor here. The fried mac n cheese patty: The highlight, as the mac and cheese that covers both patties wasn't anything special. The fried mac n cheese here was like a beautiful risotto ball only full of mac n cheese, and the contents had good flavor. All in all, this burger was really no more than a sum of its parts, and some of the improvements that I hinted at above would be needed to push the overall quality of the dish a bit. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?A great burger? Yes, but as I mentioned, not the best in Dallas. Let's recap - Great idea, but there are better burgers in the city, and the mac n cheese doesn't quite crack the top 10 when it comes to flavor and quality. No Star Granted.",3

We walked in at lunch time on a Thursday, welcomed by.... literally no one. The hostess stood at the front dais with a sour grimace on her face and seemed wholly put out by our decision to enter the restaurant. We asked to sit at a low table with banquette seating because a friend with small children would be joining us, and the charming waitress showed us to a high-top table. The small correction (e.g. reminder of what we had just requested) stirred her irritation, and we soon understood why. Every low table in the place was covered with dirty plates and glasses. The staff hadn't cleared any tables. They also weren't even working on it. ...So we waited. For an overly long amount of time. We waited even longer for our waitress, who was remarkably out of sorts. We decided she must have had a wild night the evening before. The smeared makeup, inability to concentrate, slurring, and general malaise were clues enough. The best part of the whole experience was when she brought me a pepsi and, after taking a mouth-puckering sip and flagging her down for 5 minutes, I reported to her that it was completely flat. She said, ""I'll get you another one""--failing to recognize that the problem was in their carbonation/syrup mix. So she brought me another glass of the exact same disgusting ""drink,"" never letting the real problem of the situation intrude upon her remaining neurons.Surprise of the day: The food was actually pretty good!Don't go here.",4

Staff wise that is middle of the road - are the staff and servers courteous and friendly - that is a yeah, are they quick with your order - that is a not on your life - you are sitting there waiting at least an hour and that is the average just don't don't go there hungry all I can say, you will starve if you go on with an veracious appetite.The food itself after the long and tedious wait is really good the mac and cheese burger is awesome - it is just the waiting for it to come.  If the staff could be more attentive, and you did not have to like flag them down multiple times I would probably give this a better review. Also this place is high end - service may not always be high end, but place is. Go knowing your pocketbook or wallet is going to be crying end of the night because it will be empty and it will be.  This place is not for the frugal minded still it is a pretty good place to hang out and enjoy the games.",

Cocktails are expensive but not more so than other places around the area. And holy crap. So many bros. The ratio of males to females in this place must have been 3:1.  It was intense. I was here for a farewell happy hour and was just mingling with my group, but all the single (and not so single)  ladies were busy scoping, as there was so much to scope. Of course they are bros, so managing  expectations would probably be a good idea.The drinks and food were nothing special, although I found the female bartenders were pretty friendly. Or maybe they were just happy to serve a customer who wasn't ogling them.Crazy story - apparently a group of random douchebags convinced a bartender to put their drinks on our friend's credit card, closed out his open tab, and signed the credit card slip in his name!!!

96,,6/27/2016,193,,"Manhattan, NY",JohnnyPrimeC. C.,4275,4.0,212,"My wife paid a little under $50 for a Gilt City flash deal that got us two drinks each, an app to share, two entrees and a side to share at The Ainsworth. Pretty great deal if you ask me.We started with these crab tacos. These are $21 regular price, so I thought that was a bit high considering that these are small and the plate comes with four pieces. Do these look like they're worth $5.25 each (before tax and tip)? I don't think so.They were tasty - good crunch on the shell, though I wasn't sure if the crab meat was actual lump crab or some kind of crab substitute. Either way, I wouldn't pay that kind of money for them.For a nominal upcharge ($12), I went with the 20oz bone-in, 28-day dry-aged rib eye.This was spectacular. The aged flavor really popped for just a 28-day stint in the aging box. I could taste the nutty and funky qualities with ease. While it was grilled instead of seared, didn't have much of a spinalis (fat cap), and there was a bit of hard grizzle in the meat, the cook temperature was a perfect medium rare and the flavor in the eye was excellent. 8/10.As you can see, the steak was topped with some crispy fried shallots. Nice touch!At $42, this is a great deal, especially considering that the flavors of this thing can easily rival some of the best steakhouses in town. I guess it was just a bummer that I got a cut with little fat cap and a few bites of grizzle.My wife went with the famous mac and cheese burger.That's a fried mac and cheese patty on the bottom, a cheeseburger patty on top of that, and then mac and cheese on top of the burger.While that is all totally unnecessary and probably only done for Instagram fodder, it was indeed a fun item to eat.It didn't taste that special to me, but it sure did make for some handsome photos.French fries came with that burger, as if there wasn't enough to fill you up with the burger itself.These could use some work. Some were a little bit un-crisped and heavy, but otherwise decent.On the side, we shared the asparagus with a fried egg on top. Both the asparagus and the egg were cooked perfectly and had good flavor. Look - it was either this or more fries, so give me a break.",

101,,10/8/2015,284,1,"Manhattan, NY",Jenn P.,874,1.0,130,"I've been to this bar multiple times but this past time was the worst of my experiences here.On the positive side, the bar is pretty big and has big TVs.  Late on Saturday night, it wasn't too packed.  We arrived around 1AM or so.  At the door, the bouncer told us they were approaching last call.  Cool - we were just meeting up with some friends, so that was fine by us.Here's where the issues started.  First, as mentioned before, the bar wasn't very busy, but the bartenders were EXTREMELY inattentive.  It was hard to get their attention - even AFTER they announced last call.  We had a bartender blatantly walk past us multiple times.  I was unable to successfully get her attention, but another member of my party eventually was able to order drinks.  After he signed the check, she approached him and essentially yelled at him for not leaving a tip.Now, I would never stiff a server or bartender unless the service was truly horrific, but on the flip side, as a former server, I would NEVER approach a guest about a lack of tip.  I thought it was super unprofessional.  And, quite frankly, with her attitude she didn't deserve a tip.  Lastly, possibly five minutes after receiving our long sought after cocktails, they announced that they were closing up and put on the house lights.  The bouncers came by and HERDED everyone out.  I think I made it approximately three sips into my Jack + diet.  To be fair, the bouncers were really nice, but you aren't going to even let me drink the cocktail that it took me 20+ minutes to get? While not a completely horrific experience (let's not be melodramatic here), this was disappointing.  There are plenty of other bars in the area that I would rather frequent.",3

To that end, she expressed her desire to go to the Ainsworth to stuff her face into a mac & cheese burger, photos of which propagate the food Instagram world. If you have never heard of this culinary masterpiece, you are clearly not from around here.Having walked a bit from Summer Streets and devouring free hot dogs, we were tired but not too hungry at 10AM when we arrived. I have been to the Ainsworth Park location a couple times and loved each time I was there and was expecting no different. It was very empty inside, maybe one group of 8 and that's it. As time went by, there were maybe 5-8 tables total in the entire massive restaurant. This will be important as I comment on the service later.I ordered the mac & cheese burger and my gf had the seared tuna salad (she only wanted to take pictures of the burger and a couple bites). The restaurant is pretty dark and has a bar-feel to the place. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. There were no customers, so I had no idea about what was going on, but it should not have taken so long. We waited maybe 45 minutes before the food came out. My burger was slightly cold and instead of the warm, stringy cheese on the mac, the cheese was already congealed and hard. Part of the fun of the meal is that it's messy. The entire thing was lukewarm, leaning cold, and just kind of pitiful. My gf's salad looked fine, but it clearly could have been put together in 5 minutes. Perhaps they were busy raising the cow and vegetables needed to make our food. Who knows.I asked for some ranch to accompany the fries (which I enjoyed), but I had to wait about 15-20 minutes before that came. By then, I was already pretty much done with my food. The entire time, it was really hard to get the attention of the wait-staff, as the place is massive and they kept walking around the other side of the restaurant so that we couldn't make eye-contact. Overall, the meal was just okay, but the wait when it was so empty was preposterous. I'll continue to check out this chain, but at the Ainsworth Park location.",5

It is a bit overpriced for a sports bar, but definitely worth a bucket list trip on your foodie list. They have  nice selection of beers available and I ordered a cocktail called The Harvest which was surprisingly good! Not something I would normally go for but I ended up liking it a lot.

We were stone cold sober when we arrived at the bar.There were a few people there, but it wasn't packed to the gills the way I'm used to this bar being. The bartender poured our second glass of Pinot Grigio at about 1:30 and said, ""this is the last one."" Just like that. My boyfriend pointed out that she didn't have to pour it if it would be too much trouble, but she did anyway.About halfway into that drink a woman with long brown hair walked up to us and said, ""we're going to have ask you to leave."" Our friend asked if he could finish his drink first, and she said , ""Sure. Ten minutes."" As if we were in a prison and were visiting with an inmate there.I've worked in restaurants, and never in my life have I seen such a rude display coming from the staff. The manager, already in her coat, glared at us from the back of the room until we left. If someone is paying to drink at your bar, there are much better ways of treating them than we were treated last night.

We booked the ""Ultra VIP"" package for four, even though there was only three of us, because I was told that we wouldn't have reserved seating with a table any other way. We spent just shy of $800.00 on the package with high expectations that a seat and table would be offered to us. We three, arrived promptly at 9pm and after some confusion (which was fine), and was sat at a small cocktail table in the back room (also fine). It was a perfect spot for 3/4 people, and even though there was quite a few tables around us, I assumed it would be fine. The evening started off great, however around 10 pm, the table to our left showed up with 10-12 people all cramming into a size for 4. By 10:30 pm the table to out right did the same. People in their party kept just coming and coming and shoving their way into our area. We basically were sandwiched between two extremely loud parties, which had to regard for our table or space. At 10:45 we got up because our poor server/hostess had disappeared into the sea of chaos and we needed to use the ladies room. Upon return, our poor table was gone. It was taken over by young ladies and men, our bottle, mixers and favors were being drank and enjoyed (which we paid $40 corking fee) and there was no way to even argue our way back in. To say this is a disappointment, would be an understatement. I was sad that my birthday never had a chance. At 11pm, still hungry since we never had a chance at the food that was supposed to be offered, our drinks being enjoyed by the huge parties that took over (I find it hard to believe that they all purchased the VIP option), we left. Upon departure, I would have loved to speak with a manager, however the hostess was unclear of their whereabouts and with the crowds, I assumed there wasn't much that could be accomplished. I feel cheated by spending that much money, to be treated so subpar. I would like to think it isn't not the normal practice of this establishment.",4

When they're at the top of their game, I'd be hard pressed to suggest a better sports bar in the hood. When things are going sour, they're no different than any other mediocre experience.Solely based on venue alone, The Ainsworth delivers. The modern and spacious interior isn't just pleasing to the eye, but really showcases the space's versatility. It is part lounge, part sports bar and with plenty of TVs and a killer audio system to boot. For the non sports fans, this doubles as a solid restaurant where one can order an array of edibles that would hardly be considered as bar food.There is no shortage of variety when it comes to this place. For crowds, it can be everything from herds of college football alumni to DBag city within a few hours. Then there is the work crowd for the lunch or early dinner hour which may or may not include a lively happy hour.The place may not seem like a place to score cheap hordes of food and that's about right. While the smoked chicken quesadilla is a decent starter, it certainly doesn't feel like a $14 appetizer. Same goes for a bowl of standard hummus, which is a pricey $12 on its own. I do remember enjoying a Mexican burger ($16) once, but I also remember being incredibly disappointed with their AINS 26 ($15) burger, which was undercooked and under seasoned. Not feeling like a burger? Perhaps a grilled sandwich or lobster sliders? Together they're only a whopping $30. No biggie.What usually trumps a good time here isn't so much the crowd, but the service. I've had a fair share of awesome bartenders and apathetic wait staff. Some cop a little attitude sometimes, but considering their unruly crowds at times, few could blame them for being less of a stickler to detail.",12

Come on, when you add macaroni and cheese to anything, it's automatically going to be better. It was definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had! My friend agreed.

138,,6/19/2016,178,,"Bayside, NY",Jessica D.,127,3.0,157,"So I have been here three times, with last night being one of those times. The first time I came here was for my best friends boyfriend's birthday and we had a great time. My friend arranged to have the back seating area reserved, which they did for no extra charge, and the staff made sure that was ready for us when we got there. They also gave our group a complimentary bottle of champagne which was very generous. More of like a lounge place, but people were still up dancing in this back section.  All in all, we had a good time.The second time I came back here was just for a few drinks before heading to another bar for the night. A friend was nearby in the city so this just happened to be the closest place for both of us and it suited its purpose-again, a good time.However, last night, The Ainsworth disappointed. My friend had called to set up her birthday about a week or two in advance, and wanted the same set up as we had earlier in the year;reserved back area. Over the phone, the hostess told her that this wouldnt be a problem and that we have the area reserved as long as we bring 15 people. On our way there, my friend gets a call from the ainsworth asking if we are coming for our 9:15 reservation, which we thought was strange. Anyway, we told them we were about a block away and would be there soon. Upon arriving, the hostess told my friend that she would not be getting the back room that it was closed for the night, and basically just going to be dinner service all night because they weren't busy. They then told her that they also cancelled the DJ for the night because it wasn't busy. We were kind of annoyed that they called us about ten minutes before to see if we were coming, and failed to tell us about all of this until we got there. I will say, they did follow through with the complimentary bottle, and let us have it there until we figured out where we were going for the night. I know it wasn't their fault that the place was dead that night, but I just feel they should have called and said that to my friend when they found out that they wouldn't be opening the back room or having a DJ. I'm still giving the Ainsworth 3 stars because of the two other fine experiences I have had here and because I want to try their mac and cheese burger, but I don't think we will be planning to have any other parties here.",

Sometimes you may be sick of  the cavernous, rudimentary Irish bar with mediocre pub grub, stale Guinness, and bathrooms that'd more fitting for a rest stop off of Highway 95. For those moments when you want to put on your Big Boy Pants and experience some Sunday NFL action like a post-graduate professional, The Ainsworth comes in strong. Their food is all well above your average sports bar fare (wings, burgers, etc...), it's clean, there's plenty of room to spread your wings, and you can't look anywhere in the room without spotting a TV. Sure cocktails will run you $16 (as opposed to a $5 vodka drink at a less refined locale), but you're paying for a different experience here. It's not an experience I can justify on a weekly basis, but for the occasional change of pace, it's a nice departure from the norm.Outside of Sundays you can expect a pretty typical NYC nightlight experience during the rest of the week. Good looking people, occasional haggling/bartering with bouncers at the door, a guarantee you'll drop a couple hundred at the bar, et al. If that's not your scene, you should probably find a different watering hole for your adventures. For those in search of that sort of vibe, you'll be just fine.",9

The snobby, stuck-up, belligerent blonde bartender--while messily half-assing the mixed drinks she was making--gave us an attitude about it (it was barely 8 PM) and charged us $6 for drafts instead.

The other patrons were pretty fancy in suits, button downs, and shift dresses, making my jeans t checkered van ensemble stick out like a sore thumb.They played music at commercials during the game. The song choices were slick, catering to the 30 something yuppie crowd harkening back to their frat bro days. I'm talking jah rule, mystikal, 50 cent and the game - you know early 2000s kegger classics. The house speciality cocktails were my favorite part of the experience. I started with a belvedere, orange blossom, ginger and blueberry drink served over slushy ice with a ginger blueberry garnish. It was a refreshing choice for a hot evening. Then selected a jalapeño infused don Julio with lemon juice and agave syrup, garnished with a chili pepper. Holy hell that was outrageously delicious. Was going to try a bulleit bourbon with ginger and black cherry next, but couldn't pull myself away from that spicy sweet sour tequila concoction.My crew ordered food. Came out relatively quickly despite how packed it was. I'd already eaten but tried a few bites of spinach dip, a chicken blt sandwich, a burger, and a few fries.

The event was including a DJ and dancing, something I really like to do. Aside of there lack of designated dancing area, which they could easily open for us, there were over 500 people, they were rude when we tried to dance upstairs!The DJ stand has no view to the crowd, which means that the DJ cannot do his job. Cannot see the people he suppose to play music for!Till now, this was my opinion, now why they really deserve bad review!The bartender, aside of ignoring people for 30 minutes minimum! Took my order, and another female at the same time. I ordered double Absolute vodka with orange, and didn't really payed attention to what the other girl did! I saw the bartender take a bottle that don't look anything like Absolute, with no sticker on the bottle. I thought it was for the other girl. When she gave that to me, I said: ""I ordered Absolute!"" Her response: ""it's the same price, and it $21.5.""Never told me anything about a different vodka and just charged me! Never go there again!",1

166,,11/15/2016,0,,"New York, NY",Jacques V.,8,2.0,53,"For all the lists putting this as a top sports bar in NYC it really can't be farther from the truth.  It has more of a sports bar in a random city like Charlotte feel, trying to be what they perceive is good quality and classy but actually a joke with bad food, drinks and service.  It's for classy bros effectively. I was meeting up with an old friend to watch Sunday night football.  Goal was to find a place with great food, service and cocktails that wasn't your typical bar grub of fried or over-cooked garbage. I shouldn't have trusted the lists.The good - clean, lots of Tvs and lots of seating. Some of the waitresses were hard working and sincerely sweet.And the bad - overall lack of management quality.   I got there after my friend who ordered.   I waited 15 minutes for the waitress, as did all the tables next to us.  Turns out our waitress was moved sections and nobody told the other waitress she was servicing our area after that.I ordered a cocktail not on the menu (like most bars) but caveated my order with the understanding that if they didn't have the proper ingredients that I would have one of their signatures.   I was literally told the bartender is grumpy and didn't want to make it.  I got the other drink.  Surprise - it was awful and for some reason had sugar dumped on top, way too much sugar.  Typically online bar tending degree type of bar.  They don't know actual quality cocktails.Another point my friends beer came and didn't have the bottle opened.  He walked to the bar to have her open it and she was grumpy about it.  Seriously.The food was poor even for a basic sports bar.  Ordered shrimp tacos and they used low grade shrimp, bad quality tortillas and filled them with some type of slaw which was neither tasty nor healthy.  I'll give you one, you can't be neither.  They had music blaring rather than playing game sound.  Which would be passable if it was decent music or you could manageable have a conversation under it.  It was poorly dj'd mostly 90's/early 2000's music that has not aged well.  Like they went out of their way to pick bad music.  Last, with 5 minutes left in the game they shut off the big screens.  Like, closing up - don't care if it's in the middle of the best game of the year.  We had to ask them to turn it back on which they did, but seriously who does that at a legit sports bar?",1

I didn't mind waiting about 20-30min, even though we were only one of 3 tables.  The Macaroni & Cheese Burger looks better than it taste.  Waited another 20min after requesting the check....

Heavy on spice and garlic, but ok. Fries were great. Starters were ok, nothing special. They also obviously sat under a food warmer for awhile, as a crust had developed on the dip.

It made it easier to get around and talk to people. Lots of TV's for those watching sports.I can't comment on value for the food since the appetizers were complimentary. The food quality was average. The bartenders were really nice.My only major complaint: the bathrooms were disgusting. Seriously, it was a Monday night.

Nice atmosphere/decor. Service...you have got to step it up and big time, and if that happened then I'd say we'd have something to look for here in the future.The Deets:So I was in the mood for a late Sunday brunch (ok so I had an early breakfast, don't judge), and looking around at what is near I came across The Ainsworth. Since it was near to the Hilton Fashion District, I decided to give it a go.  It offers a nice atmosphere, with a great seating area and also the front windows can be wide open for the breeze to come into the front tables. The hostess confirmed my Open Table reservation and I was seated. They have a pretty good brunch menu, lots of things to choose from including apps, salads, breakfast items, burgers, sandwiches, etc. At 10 bucks a pop, I only got one mimosa (no, they are not bottomless). I ordered the steak and eggs for my meal. The skirt steak was amazing good and gives this place the 3 star A-OK rating it has. The steak really had outstanding taste and tenderness. The scrambled eggs were so-so, a bit undercooked/slimy for my taste but not bad. The hash browns looked more like stewed apples in appearance, so I am guessing they were grease soaked. I didn't go there though. Service was pretty slow for the most part, a lot of waiting. In fact, when I paid my check I stated to my server I would need my change back (so I could give her the tip)...and she never appeared back. I had to go tell someone else to find her to bring back my change. Even after being told, it was a wait until she returned with the change.

I can say that the macaroni on the burger was good on the burger. But when I tried to eat the pieces that had fallen off the burger alone, it didn't have much of a taste.

If you're going to spend $200 for a ticket, you should let people into the venue. The site stated an open bar from 9pm - 2am with small bites. I never saw 1 piece of food this place. I wasn't hungry thankfully. The coat check was a mess, I do think the girls were doing the best they could considering  everyone had large winter coats. They also stated you can pay extra for the mezzanine with champagne, but there was no mezzanine in this restaurant/bar. The drinks were good and the bartenders were pretty fast. Any alcohol we consumed at dinner was completely shivered off of us and there's nothing like doing the countdown in a club stone sober.
