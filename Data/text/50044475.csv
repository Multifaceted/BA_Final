0,Kasandra O.,"Manhattan, NY",4,17,3,5.0,9/12/2018,"Shuttle service was wonderful. They took me to the airport as soon as I dropped my car off and they picked me up in 5 minutes at the airport when I got back. I got lost looking for the pickup point where they instructed me to wait, so the phone lady sent the shuttle driver to pick me up where I was at, now that's  great customer service. As for my car, got it back exactly in the condition I left it in. It was waiting for me out front when I arrived. This service was worth every penny I spent.",1,,
1,Kiara W.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",30,73,43,4.0,7/13/2018,"Very quick and efficient!!! The bus drivers come off greet you, they take your bags and place it on the bus for you. They also remove it when you get to the airport. The reservation system on their website was very step-by-step and easily manageable. The location is easy to find. Wondering why the same companies parking is more for LGA (Laguardia) than JFK. Will definitely use SmartPark for every vacation though.",1,,

Updated review","In the past, SmartPark has been a reliable, easy, and trustworthy service. My most recent experience has completely tainted this opinion. I dropped off my vehicle at 5am in a Friday and departed for a weekend trip. Upon arriving back in NY at 11:30pm on Sunday evening, I was told that days earlier one of the valet drivers discovered that my key was stuck in the ignition. After multiple drivers attempted to dislodge the key, the key snapped and was stuck in the ignition. Not once was I contacted in the three days that past to let me know. Instead, valet drivers who have NO authority to do so decided to take apart the ignition console, open up the hood of my vehicle and disengage the battery/spark plug to turn the car off. Mistakes happen, and mishaps do occur -- but the failure to let the customer know that there has been an issue is an absolutely disgusting oversight on management's part. The negligence and invasion of trust has completely left me speechless. Not only am I now in-convened because I cannot operate my vehicle without opening up the hood and manually re-plugging in the battery and spark plug, I also have to seek out service for my car. I will no longer be using SmartPark services and will continue to let friends and family know to withhold theirs as well.",1,,
3,Matt B.,"Hartsdale, NY",0,6,0,5.0,7/6/2018,This place worked great for me and my family on a recent trip. Shuttle was ready to go when we arrived and quickly picked us up when we landed. Car was waiting for us.,,,
4,Emm M.,"New Rochelle, NY",0,14,0,5.0,3/13/2018,"I have used SmartPark LGA several times now. It occurred to me that taking taxis, car services, asking people to drive us to the airport and pick us up is inconvenient or expensive, and now as older adults, taking public transportation is too taxing. Driving 20 minutes from Westchester to SmartPark near LaGuardia is quick -- and we've gone in traffic -- and then they put our bags into their shuttle bus and drive us right to our terminal. For a week we're spending around $120, which is a little bit more than a taxi one-way to the airport from home. But we're in control of when we leave, not waiting for anyone else. The people at the desk at SmartPark and on the phone are very nice and helpful, and if you are a loyal customer they are very generous and will go out of their way even if they are overbooked. We have been okay so far with the time we have had to wait when we arrive at the airport. We'd like it to be instantaneous, but sometimes they have just left the airport after picking some other people up and have to have time to return for us, which is 15 minutes each way. Sometimes it only 5 minutes, and sometimes it more like 20 -- that's the only part that can be annoying, especially when it's cold, but we can deal with that. It is still convenient. I've read in other reviews about things missing from their cars. There are things that you have to be smart about in this world. We clean out our car when we are going to leave it in a lot no matter where it is. Employers can check out their employees to a point, but they can't be sure of every facet of their workers' character until something happens. I don't hire a cleaning person or painters or other workers for my home and leave cash all over the place. In terms of payment, you know the price when you make a reservation. And you don't have to pay in advance unless you choose to. Regarding harming your car: They go over the car with you when you first arrive to check for scratches and dents. And when you return, you should go over it again. Just like when you rent a car. Bottom line: We are and will be steady customers.",2,,
5,Clyde A.,"Holmes, NY",6,2,0,5.0,1/18/2018,Had a great experience with my family. Drop off was easy and quick. Pick up took about 15 minutes. Cost was half what it cost to park at LaGuardia. I wish I knew the name of the guy that greeted us at drop off. He drove us to the airport and picked us up. Very professional person. Look forward to using Smart Park LGA again.,1,,
6,Tara D.,"Newtown, CT",0,12,0,5.0,7/18/2018,They are wonderful. Very affordable. Kind and courteous staff. Made getting to and from the airport very easy. Will definitely use again!,,,
7,Ashok G.,"Chatham Township, NJ",10,77,64,2.0,12/6/2017,"Pick up was terrible, I had to wait for 45 min at the terminal with my kids. All the other parking shuttles had come about 3 times and there was no sign of SmarkPark LGA shuttle. I had to call several times and followup to get them to pick. Didn't expect such a shady experience :( Will think twice now before I choose this place.",,,
8,Eric R.,"Santa Clara, CA",10,20,13,5.0,9/10/2017,Was looking for long term parking last minute on the way to LGA and came across Smart Park. I was really happy with the customer service and impressed that they document the arriving cars for any damage before parking. We waited maybe 5 minutes to be driven to the terminal and got there in no time. When we got back it was extremely easy to coordinate getting to the lot and we waited no more than 10 minutes from when we got our luggage. The car was ready out front when we got back and the whole process of getting from the airport to Smart Park took less than 30 minutes. The price was very reasonable and we were extremely happy with the service.,1,,

10,Catherine B.,"Sheffield, MA",0,6,0,5.0,4/23/2018,"I read all the reviews of Laguardia airport parking -- there seemed to be no good choices, all of them had some very negative reviews.  I went for Smart Park and it worked out totally smoothly.  No long wait, no dented car, no missing items.  What more could you ask for? I was totally satisfied.",,,
11,Alfred R.,"New York, NY",17,11,0,5.0,5/7/2017,I've been to different parking off sites. This is now my go-to spot. Sometimes looking for the best bargain can come back and bite you in the butt. This place is not the cheapest but this is the type of professional service I expect.,2,,
12,Jay R.,"Presidio Heights, San Francisco, CA",0,32,0,2.0,1/11/2018,"Simply cannot recommend.  Drop off was easy enough, but pick-up was terrible - almost 30 minutes - driver drove past me dropping off someone else - no consideration that this is January and that they ask you to wait outside in the cold.  Too many other options - plan to try another service next time.",,,
13,Michael M.,"Mahwah, NJ",6,163,32,5.0,10/24/2017,"Talk about a smooth and easy transtaction.  I had an early flight out of LGA Friday morning, 6:55 am, and coming in from Northern NJ, I decided it would be easiest for me to pay for off-site parking.  I went to Groupon to see what deals were avaliable, and it directed me to SmartPark.  I arrived at 5:15 in the morning, and with my reservation in hand, left my car in a trusted attendee, and boarded a shuttle van after waiting for less than 5 minutes.  They went to 2 different terminals before mine, and the driver helped me with my bags, off of the van.  After landing back from my vacation Sunday night, I went to the outside section, called the office for Smartpark, and within 5 minutes the van picked me up, and drove 5 minutes to the lot, where my car was waiting for me, dent and damage free.  Went in to the trailer to pay the taxes and everything said and done, it was 60 dolalrs for 3 days of parking.  I have found my new off-site lot.",,,
14,LE F.,"New York, NY",0,59,1,2.0,9/18/2017,"Called for pick up over 20 minutes ago.   They said they'd be right over.   Called again 5 minutes ago.   They said ""3 minutes.""    Still waiting.   This is not a busy time at the airport, so there is really no excuse for this.  Finally here.  27 minutes would be understandable with bad traffic, but there is almost no traffic.   I will never understand why customer service people lie about schedules.   (On the plus side, the driver is very nice.).   So .. we finally made it here.   But they seem to have lost the car.   They have sent someone out to search for it, but it this is really tiresome.",,,
15,Crystal B.,"Mattituck, NY",187,4,8,1.0,4/5/2017,"Smart Park LGA did everything right until we got back into our car after a 3 day trip to notice something we left in our car was stolen. I booked this online which was fast and easy and they took us in the shuttle quickly, but when it comes to leaving things in your car, just realize that it might be gone when you come back. beware of the workers here with sticky fingers!",,,
16,Rafael P.,"Monroe, NY",0,3,1,5.0,3/18/2017,They delivered on everything as promised! I registered online. I pulled up to their garage and was processed and driven to my terminal within 20 minutes. When I came back I called and was told the shuttle would be there shortly. 15 minutes later we were on our way to the lot. Once there my car was waiting. Paid quickly and was out. The staff was friendly. I recommend this to anyone looking for long term parking at La Guardia. Tip: I had to come back to the airport to pick someone up later that day so instead of driving home I caught a movie at the theater right across the lot.,,,
17,Heather P.,"Middletown, NY",0,5,0,5.0,9/14/2017,"Decent price, close to the airport and great customer service!  I didn't have to pick up my luggage once both to and from the airport.  Upon arriving back in ny the shuttle was there to pick me up within 5 mins from the time I called to say I was ready.  My car was there waiting for me as soon as we returned to the lot.",,,
18,Trinh L.,"Federal Way, WA",0,11,0,1.0,12/16/2016,"The one star I give SmartPark LGA is one star too many.My car was valet parked on SmartPark LGA lot from 12/1 - 12/14.  It cost me $365.00 which I paid online in full before driving to the lot.I picked up my car on 12/14 and immediately noticed new, extensive scratches on the front, driver side, near the headlight.  Via emails, I explained and submitted photos of the damage to SmartPark LGA on 12/14 and 12/15, respectively.   Adam Smith of SmartPark LGA telephoned me on 12/16 to deny any responsibilities.  He also implied that those scratches came into existence after I left his parking lot on 12/14.What do I gain by falsely accusing SmartPark LGA  for causing damages to my car when I have already paid in full in advance?Any businesses, big or small, that have integrity, are concerned about providing reliable services to its customers, would have taken a different approach.  SmartPark LGA has proven that it is not such a business.Please keep my situation in mind if you decide to valet park your car at SmartPark LGA.  Better yet, stay away from SmartPark LGA if you value your car at all.",,3,
19,Andrew W.,"Chappaqua, NY",0,13,0,5.0,5/6/2017,"After my flight was cancelled by American Airlines due to a storm, Smart Park was kind enough to not charge me for the 3 hours I spent at the airport. I will give them my business going forward in return for being the sole bright spot in another bad day of dealing with airlines.",1,,
20,Dennis G.,"Long Beach, NY",0,2,0,5.0,11/4/2016,"Absolutely the only way to access LGA during construction . I made a reservation dropped my vehicle and was on the shuttle in less than 10 minutes .

21,Robert F.,"Babylon, NY",1,27,0,5.0,10/18/2016,I had a small issue regarding the # of days parked. When I brought it up to a manager he resolved it right away even though after speaking with him I think I was in the wrong. I will use this company everytime I need to park at LGA or JFK,,,
22,Susan R.,"Nyack, NY",0,3,0,5.0,6/30/2017,Best service!   Called they picked me up in two minutes.  Professional!   Tried bolt before.  Not good.  Took 49 minutes to pick me up.   Go here!!,,,
23,Leo B.,"Selden, NY",0,3,0,4.0,6/22/2017,"I've used both Smart Park facilities (LGA & JFK) on numerous occasions. I've received great service from both locations. However, I need to raise this issue so that you are forewarned. Last night I noticed that the coins were taken out of the change holder. While the amount of money was inconsequential, it did provide a stark reminder not to leave any valuables in your vehicle. But I do like their service and will continue to use them.",,,
24,Alex E.,"Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY",0,4,0,1.0,5/7/2017,"So we were flying out of delta and we found this lot. Seemed fine. Arrived there without any major issues (didn't matter so much that it's in a super annoying area to get to). It's a simple task, store your car, drop off and pick you up. Well of course we landed in LGA. We called the number provided to get pick up. An entire hour went by for a shuttle to come. I called 3 separate times all every response was traffic. Asked the driver and he was just picking up other people. If you want to wait over an hour getting a shuttle that's still 20 min away from the airport, I would avoid. Otherwise the lot and the drop off went fine.",,,
25,B G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1,32,0,5.0,2/9/2017,"Just a quick word: the best. They made the whole process easy, coming and going. The price was reasonable The staff was friendly. Coffee, tea set up.

27,Meghan S.,"Stonington, CT",0,1,2,1.0,10/21/2016,Do not park your car here. I left my car with them for three days and during that time they crashed the entire side of my car and they're denying responsibility. I had to file a claim with my own insurance agency,,,

Updated review","I'm going to change my rating to 3 stars based on customer service.  I received a response in response to my review and they said they are going to work on the issues I noted in my first review and the way to improve is by getting feedback from customers.  Also, I had an issue with my car being scratched.  I filed a report when I picked up my car and they compared it to the video they took when I arrived, and knew the scratches were not there when I arrived and they were responsive.  So one star for my experience, and 4/5 stars for the customer service.  If they have good customer service, my hope is they will address issues with customer experience at the lot.",,,
