1,Amanda G.,"Yonkers, NY",962,883,4893,4.0,10/1/2017,"Had a great time here for my girlfriend's bday. It started out at another bar but they came to Mercury because the other place was dead. Murcery was much livelier. They have a beer pong table in the back by the bar. There's plenty of seating back there if you arrive early enough. The place gets packed; very energetic vibe. The bouncers are very nice. I visited the ladies room and someone annihilated one of the two stalls. I asked the bouncer to please ask someone to clean it and he took care of it ASAP. The staff here is much nicer than some other places where they act pretentious. I would definitely come back, especially for happy hour.",16,10,16

We have $1 chicken mini tacos (very delish, esp with the green salsa served with it), and Tuesday special drinks (margarita for $6 and wine for $8)The service was excellent. Everyone from the bar tender to the man that deliver the food served with a friendly smile and was quite kind. The environment is dimly lit with great music and plenty of seating and big open windows.",1,,

5,Emi E.,"New York, NY",0,18,7,4.0,7/15/2018,"I've only been here on Sundays, but I've told my friends that I totally recommend this bar. Great staff good food (wings, calamari, quesadillas, and steak and eggs) and one of the best happy hour and brunch deals in the city. Always a chill crowd as well.",,,
6,Eddie C.,"New York, NY",820,192,181,4.0,11/15/2017,"Mercury Bar is a down to earth place with solid food and pretty good lunch specials at $7.00 for two items. The bar doesn't pretend to be bougie and attracts a varied clientele from yuppies and lost tourists to blue collar workers. Drinks were pretty cheap.The service was slow even though it wasn't busy.My favourite item was the Philly Cheese Steak. While not too authentic (they use kraft single slices), the flavors were good nonetheless. I'd come back.",,1,
7,Celeste O.,"Queens, NY",4,32,17,4.0,4/3/2018,"Came here on a whim for a good happy hour.  And that I certainly got! I sat at the bar, the bartender whose name I dont remember. I dont think she ever gave it.  But she's Irish, was super nice. The happy hour here has to be the best I've seen in a long while.   My bill for about 3 beers and a wrap for lunch didn't come out to more than $30. They just have deals all around.  And the timing of happy hour is the best as well.  I will definitely be returning soon for my birthday.",,1,
8,Jeremain M.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",287,14,12,2.0,1/8/2018,It was a early Friday night and I was out with a friend so we decided to stop into Mercury Bar. The atmosphere was nice so we stopped in for happy hour drinks and a bite to eat. When the waitress came over she was nice and gave us a happy hour menu. So we ordered there 2 for 1 appetizers and drinks. The drinks came out ok speed but when the appetizer came out I was shocked at the quantity and quality. Food tasted like frozen food and the quesadilla were the smallest quesadilla I have ever seen. I would not return for food.,,,
9,Chris G.,"Manhattan, NY",206,22,0,5.0,8/5/2018,I arrived before he night really started to pick up. Incredibly friendly staff that took my request for water with professionalism. They were really personable and enjoyed talking to patrons visiting. You should definitely check this place out.,,,
10,Penny L.,"Orange, CA",0,9,12,5.0,4/21/2018,"I was on vacation and my mother and I stumbled upon this place. My expectations for the food was low because it is a bar but oh my did it exceeded that! Food was excellent! We had the eggs benedict for their brunch deal and it was probably one of the best eggs benedict I've had! (Btw, house fries means house potatoes not French fries). Not only was the food great but their wait staff is on point. Moriah was our server and she was AMAZING. She was so attentive to us, refilling our drinks before we even had to ask and taking our song requests so we had an absolutely wonderful time! We are so greatful to have stumbled upon this place, can't wait to come back.Thank you again to Moriah!!",,,
11,Kajol G.,"Plainsboro Township, NJ",603,4,0,5.0,7/28/2018,Amazing food and service!!! Crystal the manager was the homie! She came and talked to us and made sure we were okay. It was my friend's birthday and she was so sweet and hooked it up. One of the nicest managers I've ever met who took the time of day to talk to us!!! Love her and the spot,,,
12,Lisa F.,"Denver, CO",115,323,323,1.0,5/2/2017,"This should be short and simple. On girls night and waiting for our table at Blockheads we decided to grab a quick drink at Mercury Bar.We headed in and went straight to the back bar where you could barely hear yourself think let alone speak to someone. At 6:30 PM on a Friday evening it was more of a night club than a bar with loud music.They were still on happy hour and we decided to try the Sangria - $6 good deal right? NOT! First of all the ""sangria"" had an almost milky consistency and tasted NOTHING like sangria you know like the real kind where you use wine and stuff.This place is a dirty gross excuse for a big city college bar. There is no need to return to this place unless you are looking to slum it with some broke down people when you want to feel better about how far you've come in life (I'm sure I'll get such great hate messages about this but hey TRUTH HURTS PEOPLE!)",2,2,
13,Lauren C.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",0,1,0,1.0,6/29/2018,"Last night i visited the bar with a few co workers, we approached the bar and were greeted by the bartender he offered us a menu and asked if we'd like water, shortly after our water we walked to the back where our friends were playing beer pong and the waitress told us not to order from the bar which was confusing to us... we waited 25 minutes to put in an order with her because she said not to go to the bar since we were seated near the beer pong. She was very Nasty when we jokingly told her how long we waited and if the ice melt, then we see her push her way through a group of people and the bartender that we saw in the front of the restaurant, he looked pissed off! overall the bar is pretty, the food is good  drinks are made well but the service is lacking... 1 star for the nasty waitress and time between our orders being placed and dropped off...",,,
14,Nicole N.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",29,10,0,4.0,6/18/2018,Excellent menu with a great variety. There were so many options that I wanted so I will definitely be returning to try them out! Nice cocktails too with a good happy hour. Staff were a little laid back. Not rude or anything just left us having to get their attention even though the bar was pretty empty at the time.,,,
15,Ana M.,"Manhattan, NY",28,77,122,4.0,2/18/2017,"Still one of my favorite bars. I've been coming here for about 3 years now and the staff has changed and is sad because some of the good ones are gone. Still the food is great! I usually have the chicken  quesadilla for $11. I use to order patron café when it was on the Tuesday happy hour menu for $7 i believe. This particular bar is great for groups of course but also great if you are alone. You can easily meet people. The traffic is usually 20s and 30s, after work, young professionals, depending on the day of course. Love this bar just wish the girls that work here were nicer",1,1,1
16,Madeleine D.,"Charlotte, NC",200,37,42,4.0,6/3/2018,Fun place to start out the night. It's got great cocktails and a good environment to hang with friends and talk about the week. Went on a Saturday night around 9 and it was decently crowded yet still open enough to easily talk to your friends. Definitely recommend if you're a local in Hell's Kitchen and looking for a cool spot that's not filled with tourists and has some bomb drinks.,,,
17,Lissette C.,"Woodside, NY",112,10,9,4.0,4/29/2018,Really nice looking bar. Friends and I went in for happy hour on the weekday and it wasn't crowded. Service was friendly and quick as well. Waitress was friendly and provided us good recommendations from the menu. There's room to play beer pong which is awesome. Music was good too.  Happy hour prices seemed reasonable. Would deff go back here.,,,
18,Holly B.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3,13,7,2.0,12/9/2017,"Came here while we waited for brunch. For a bar in Murray Hill it is extremely over priced. If I'm paying $15 Bloody Mary, I'd prefer it not come in a tiny plastic cup!",,,
19,Kenneth E.,"Manhattan, NY",342,242,298,5.0,1/20/2017,"Came here past happy hour to get a quick drink to pass the time while I waited for a party to start. They were playing a bunch of sports games which was pretty nice. There are a lot of TVs everywhere. We sat down at a table even though we were just getting drinks, but the servers didn't have a problem with that, since the place was only about half full. They served us with a smile and made sure our water was full in addition to our alcoholic beverages. Even though we had paid the bill, she saw me sucking on ice, laughed and refilled my cup for me. I think that really says something about the service there. I wish I got her name so I could call her out for being such a great server. My beers (shocktops) were $7 each. Not too bad. The music they played was so on point. There was a good throwback mix of 90s music, today's hits etc. I just wish there was a dance floor. It makes you want to dance. There were some girls who made their own dance area which everyone seemed OK with. Definitely would come back here, without a doubt, next time. Great bar.",1,1,
20,Bloss C.,"Jersey City, NJ",769,1081,2521,5.0,12/28/2016,"Five stars for this DETROIT LIONS bar.  If you like the DETROIT LIONS come here.  They play the game on several screens, including the big screen in back, and they play the game with sound.  Everybody in the bar cheers for touchdowns and nice defensive plays of THE DETROIT LIONS.  A DJ plays music during the commercials, which is awesome, I hate it when bars keep the volume on for commercials.  They play the other games also.  The bartender was nice.  GO LIONS.",2,,1
21,Lissa B.,"Brooklyn, NY",163,50,45,5.0,1/17/2017,Haven't had any problems with this place. Every time I come here it's a great night. Food and drinks are delicious. And some nights have different Themes.  One night my friend and I stopped by for drinks after work.  It ended up being trivia night. My friend and I didn't plan on participating. Somehow they talked us into it and we had a blast.  I've also been here towards the weekends. They have a DJ playing great songs and the wall tvs sometimes playing the music videos.  As the night goes on the tables are moved and it's time to do some dancing.Basically mercury bar just has a great vibe and a great set of people. I'll definitely continue coming here.,,,
22,Karla A.,"Brooklyn, NY",94,258,315,5.0,7/7/2017,"I mean you can't really go wrong with generous lunch options at $6.95. Mercury Bar is a constant mix of all walks of life. You'll see blue collar workers, construction workers, your everyday moms, it's an interesting place to people watch. Philly cheesesteak and spicy chicken wrap are my faves. Their burgers are quite tasty too. My coworkers and I frequent Mercury Bar often. The service can be slow at times but if you're there for lunch time they do get busy. I have also been after work and vibe is pretty much the same. They have constant specials and play these 90's music videos that take you for a nostalgic ride if you're into that sort of thing. LOL",,,
23,Emely O.,"Mount Eden, NY",7,9,24,5.0,2/22/2018,"I've went a few times with family and friends! I really enjoyed this place. Nice atmosphere, employees are attentive and gracious! Great music with a decent size to dance! The later you go the more crowded it becomes but with good people and some excellent drinks you will have a great time. The only draw back is there isn't enough vegetarian/vegan variety on their menu! Wish they would add more. Definitely would stopping by again!!!",,,
24,Jatin K.,"Plainview, NY",391,105,388,5.0,6/13/2017,First off great atmosphere but the manager Amanda?? Forget about it. Most amazing down to earth genuine person a bar can hire. Really knows how to look after customers and did a great job to accommodate us. Amazing service,,,
25,Jason A.,"Hoboken, NJ",275,98,1315,4.0,10/9/2015,"I went to this bar with my cousin a couple weeks ago on Sunday to watch the Detroit Lions game.  As soon as we walked in we noticed how packed the bar was (so go early), but luckily we got two seats at the bar. My cousin is a huge Saints fan and wanted to watch the Saints game as well . (why would anyone want to be a Saints fan when they can be a LIONS fan?!?!- but I digress...LETS GO LIONS!!) Most of the TV screens was on the Lions game and they had the smaller screens on other games. I spoke to the manager and he said if no one around you opposes that he will try to accommodate my request to have the Saints game on. A couple minutes later he placed the Saints game on a smaller screen next to the bar. Needless to say that my cousin was very grateful. At the bar we ordered Wings (which i highly recommend) and beer. The wings were very good and also the drinks were reasonably priced. There were two waitresses that were working their butts off trying to get everyone's order. I must say that even when the bar was slammed with orders, our waitress still periodically checked on us and made sure that we were being taken care of.  This bar is a great bar to watch any game but it is great to watch a LIONS game. It shoud be noted that when you have commercials during the game, the DJ plays some great song to keep you having a good time. I do not know why there are so many negative reviews but to each their own. I must say that i really enjoyed the atmosphere and would highly recommend this bar to anyone. I would rate the bar as follows: Pricing is 3.5 Stars, Atmosphere 4.0 stars, Food 4 stars and Staff 4.5 stars.    The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment.",1,,1

Updated review",I was in Murray Hill recently and I was so happy to see mercury bar was still there!!! I love this place. The staff is so fun and friendly. I came with a couple of friends for drinks and snacks before a late movie. Such a Gem in Murray Hill! The bartenders are all attentive and friendly and the manager Amanda was amazing as well! If you're in the Murray Hill area and want a fun cute place to grab some good food and drinks I highly suggest Meecury bar!,,,
27,Michelle P.,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",0,17,59,4.0,5/9/2017,"Happy hour did not disappoint! My hubby and I shared a meal and shared a drink for just $14! Can't beat that with a bat (in Manhattan!) Ambiance is clean and nice. Not crowded at all during happy hour. Only gave it 4 stars cuz menu could be a little clearer but other than that, this is a great place to pop in and out of and leave with a happy tummy!",1,,

29,Ceren A.,"Brooklyn, NY",1160,1193,7576,3.0,5/12/2016,"Pretty close to where I work so we stopped by last Saturday since the other places were busier. I gave 3 stars but it is like 3.5 When we got there, it was like 10 pm so the place was more like a bar-pub but after a specific time, they moved the tables to sides and turned the place into a club. It is kind of logical anyway. We tried the volcano nachos and chicken wings. Both were fine. Portion was really big for nachos. Price is $8.95. Wings were okay too. Our server was quite attentive. Beer glasses were never empty. Atmosphere is kind of cool too. The ceiling is high, the mirror behind bar makes place look even wider. I will try some other dishes and might go with 4 stars in future.",12,5,7
30,Saasha G.,"Brooklyn, NY",128,152,446,3.0,11/4/2016,"Great for lunch specials 7.95 but the best thing is the frozen sangria.. I go here frequently for the lunch specials which can change daily, but I've never had any issues with the food. It's. asic bar food at a cheap price and I appreciate that since budget is necessary on NYC.",,,
31,Shane G.,"Brooklyn, NY",48,2,0,5.0,12/28/2017,Best bar I've been to so far. The staff are friendly and they give some good advice about life topics. I will come here with more people next time.,,,
32,Anna T.,"New York, NY",227,155,177,5.0,5/20/2016,"Mercury Bar has the BEST happy hour in terms of drinks and food. They have a great selection of $5 shots which includes my favorite Jameson. That was already a plus for me. The Razz mojito was also $5 and it was made perfectly. The majority of the happy hour drinks  are $5 with the exception of $4 beers. Their regular menu is pretty extensive but their happy hour food menu is limited. No worries though, because I tried the hummus, flat bread, and steak empanadas and all were good and will fill you up. The hummus was my favorite! I couldn't stop eating it. I can taste the garlic which i absolutely love! Also, i asked for more pita bread and the server happily brought me some more. Last but not least, order the brownie dessert. Drizzled with caramel and topped with vanilla, and some whip cream, it was just a plate of heaven. What i loved was that it was not so sweet either.         The reason why I gave this place a 5 star was for the impeccable service. Matt was THE best!! He really took good care of you. Our water glasses was never empty. Our table was constantly cleaned. He always asked us how we were doing. It was a great experience.        They have large TV screens for all your viewing needs. They have a beer pong table in the back which I cannot wait to come back and play. I hear on Fridays and Saturdays, the place gets packed and becomes a dance floor with great music. I'll definitely come back and check out the rest. Thanks again MATT!",4,,1
33,Aparna T.,"New York, NY",438,108,105,2.0,2/12/2017,"My friends and I stumbled upon this place as we were trying to find a bottomless brunch deal with less than a 30 minute wait. Luckily, a table was getting ready to leave as we arrived and we were promptly seated by a friendly hostess. Upon arrival, the first thing we noticed was the great music. Multiple TVs throughout the restaurant were playing everything from 90's R&B to Top 40 tunes of today. This kept the place lively and the mood upbeat. My friends and I ordered family style and thoroughly enjoyed our entrees. The huevos rancheros and waffle skillet were the top two contenders of the afternoon and I would definitely recommend that to anyone. This place offers many drink options included in the 2 hour bottomless brunch deal: mimosa, bloody mary, frozen sangria, frozen margarita, beer. It was really great to see so many options available besides just the classic mimosa. I decided to go with the frozen sangria while a majority of the table stuck with mimosas. To make sure the drinks were free flowing, we asked for a pitcher of mimosa at a time instead of waiting for our waitress to keep coming back with individual drinks as the service was a bit on the slow side. This might've been where our problem lied. The ratio of champagne to orange juice was just not acceptable. My friends literally felt sick an hour and a half into our meal because they were basically speed-drinking orange juice! This really felt like a waste of our money and our time as we didn't receive an adequate amount of champagne. I have frequented this establishment at nighttime and will definitely come back in the evening for a fun night of drinks and dancing, however, I will not come back for their brunch.",2,2,2
34,Henry Z.,"New York, NY",228,14,0,3.0,2/12/2017,"I propose re-naming this establishment to Orange Juice Bar.I arrived here with a group of 5 for bottomless brunch and ended up with a totally average experience. The staff was friendly but pretty slow on service (likely from being under staffed.) The food was really good; we all shared the French Toast, Waffle Skillet, Chicken and Waffles, Huevos Rancheros, and the Farmers Skillet and were extremely happy. The Farmer's Skillet was 100% the MVP. Along with the food we wanted to drink mimosas and frozen sangria; however, we ended up drinking orange juice and sangria. I really cannot emphasis enough how un champagne-y the mimosas were; indistinguishable from drinking out of a tropicana bottle. Although Mercury Bar seemed like a great place to get wasted at brunch, we ended up just feeling sick from drinking to much orange juice.Overall would have been an awesome experience if I wasn't so excited to drink some sparkly wine that morning.",2,2,2
35,INDIA O.,"New York, NY",6,68,54,3.0,3/28/2018,Came here for happy hour. Appetizers were 2 for 10. The portions were small. The wings here are crappy. The drink specials were on point and the staff friendly. I still like Mercury West much better. The chicken fajitas there are everything.,1,,
36,Svetlana S.,"Lower East Side, Manhattan, NY",0,9,1,5.0,4/21/2017,Stopped by for lunch during a week. From a looks of it it's your typical bar. But I took advise of a very pleasant waitress and ordered  tomato soup and a sandwich. Delish!!! Soup was very flavorfully and cheese to my surprise.   And sandwich was a very generous portion and full of flavor as well! This is  not your topical bar food! All for $6.95. Definitely NYC hidden gem! Check them out!,,,
37,Sally V.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,10/19/2017,"Came in due to the advertisement on the outside of the restaurant stating that Drafts were $5.  Came in was handed menus, I didnt look at because I knew whatI wanted.  Bill came around and my beer went from $5 to $8.

38,Dominik D.,"Staten Island, NY",191,2087,4888,4.0,2/28/2016,Pretty happening bar. It's populated but there's room to dance on a Saturday night (a blessing in this neighborhood). The music is good and the dance floor lights are engaging without being obnoxious or blinding.,1,,

Plenty of TVs, an available food menu, and more seating/beer pong tables in the back. The waitresses and bartenders were nice as well. This place doesn't feel snooty like many of the bars in Midtown, so come check it out for yourself.",1,,

I think for my birthday my party must've ordered them over and over knowing how much I love them.Mercury has great food. I've been a couple times as I work close by. Recently had my birthday after work there. The manager was very accommodating, however, the second waitress to take over our party was a bit rude and lifeless. A couple of my guests noticed. But to be fair that was the first time I've experienced that, the girls are usually super friendly. I guess everyone has their days. Today for lunch we had fast & friendly service. Music and vibes are super fun at Mercury. Not a pricey place where you can get a stiff drink and great food... Steak bites!!!",,1,

42,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",161,613,558,2.0,2/12/2016,"""Hit or miss but most times a miss""I wanted to relive some of my ""old"" day when I used to live and working the area (circa '06/07). This place, along with the now defunct Bar 515, was perfect for grabbing that happy hour drink or 8 and for listening to old 90's music. The vibe was carefree and chill back then. Now, it has changed, which could be do to the increase of frat boy culture. The pros (I guess): -music videos from the 90's are still shown here. So, you can get your PM Dawn and Blackstreet ""no diggity"" on. -The drink prices are reasonable  The cons:-The bouncer situation makes it feel a bit like a police state, especially on nights when there are only 5-6 people at the bar. -The food is barely edible. The chicken wings are more baked than fried. I have a suspicion that they are prebaked, slathered with whatever sauce,  and thrown into the microwave when they are ordered. -This con may be a personal annoyance. I HATE with bar tabs have the suggested gratuity amounts and the bartender circles the amounts. Ummmm, I think most people can calculate or estimate a 15%, 18%, or 20% tip - I have be doing it for YEARS!!!! Plus, it hurts you because most people would round up to the nearest 50 cents or dollar rather than giving a tip for $5.47. Like I said this may be more of a personal annoyance.",1,,

First of all it was super reasonable and the portions of food was really great for the prices which is 15 dollars for 2 hour bottomless plus I have to get an plate of food. The waitress there was super on point with mimosas. I loved her because we bonded over just fashion and I let her try on my hat. Her name was Carmella and every time she came to our table it was like she had this psychic connection that we needed more mimosas. The vibe there is super fun and laid back especially on brunch!

52,Benjamin R.,"New York, NY",143,44,34,5.0,8/21/2016,"I was at Mercury Bar Saturday night at around 10:45pm, I was drinking and had nothing to eat all day so I ordered one of the flatbread items off the menu.It took nearly an hour for the order to be filled but that is only because it was a busy night and Mercury Bar takes pride in their artisan flatbreads. I have been at some of the finest restaurants in New York, London, Paris and Milan, but have never had a flatbread of such sheer elegance. One can tell the Chef-de-Cuisine made the bread from scratch with premium flour from Tuscany. When the flatbread from Mercury Bar came to me at 11:30pm, it was perfectly dressed in a Chipotle aoili and fresh cilantro and, what I must assume, was organic California avocados at the peak of their freshness.Zagat and Michelin, if you are reading this, please know to give this place a coveted star",1,1,

55,James L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",0,1,0,5.0,1/14/2018,"I went here a few weeks ago on a Sunday for brunch and the service was absolutely terrible. Though the food was good, The female bartender was rude and arrogant and the waitress refused to help us because we weren't sitting at her table. Terrible experience and to say the least, I said I would never come back. Yesterday Saturday Jan 13th, my friends wanted to go to watch an MSU game and Mercury happens to be an MSU bar. After my last experience I didn't want to return, but THANK GOD I changed my mind last minute. What a change!!! Our bartender Ashley was absolutely awesome! She was funny, helpful, and even knew about basketball and football so we all could relate and converse. As busy as she was she made sure we were all taken care of. Even bought us a drink on the house (which she didn't have to) because she asked us to move down a few seats to accommodate other guests. Good job on the upgrade mercury. Looks like I'll only be coming here for Saturday brunch from now on.",,,
56,Quincy K.,"New York, NY",323,12,3,2.0,2/12/2017,"Sigh... I seriously considered putting some distance between me and my current Mercury-induced hangover before writing this review, but I'm hoping that reliving the experience will expedite this whole ""purge the demons"" process. So here goes... This was not our first pick for brunch (PS 450). Nor was it our second (The Flying Cock). But they say third time's a charm, so we came in with the quiet optimism of desperately hungry twenty-somethings, rabid for a bottomless brunch deal they could write home about. We should've recognized the immediate danger this particular establishment posed when we walked in and immediately ran into coworkers (not the ""omg Jimmy from accounting is here!! Jimmy, pull up a chair"" kind of run-in....the ""Oh shit my mid-level pseudo-superior who's been making my life marginally more difficult for months is over by the bar. Quick, put your hoods up"" kind of run-in). But we put our metaphorical big-girl panties on, and made pleasantries during our 15 minute wait for a table-for-five. A quarter of an hour later, hopelessly grateful to have escaped the stiff social situation we'd found ourselves in, we took our seats at an elevated table in the back. TVs around the room showed a constant stream of music videos (like...the kind of songs where you know all the lyrics and are happy to bop along, but for some reason were never made fully aware of the skanky visual accompaniment). We quickly ordered a slew of boozy brunch offerings to capitalize on our full 120 minutes of imbibing (Mercury charges the standard $15 for two hours of bottomless drinks when you buy an entree). The frozen sangria proved to be disappointingly un-chuggable, but I'd imagine someone more interested in sipping-related activities would enjoy this sweet, richly colored grown-up slushie. The frozen margaritas were a study in the power of sour mix (I learned there IS such a thing as ""too much of a good thing""), and the mimosas...hold on I need to take a breath...lord above. Okay so if we're being honest, the Mimosa Disaster of 2017 was mostly our own damn fault. Suffice it to say we got a leeeettle bit overly enthusiastic about taking FULL advantage of our 2-hour drinking marathon. So, like any good recent college grads, we got down to business on several pitchers of mimosas. But, like any responsible restaurant where bottomless brunch is served, they stuck to a solid 5-to-1 ratio of juice to champs. Somewhere along our determined battle towards tipsiness, each of us ended up consuming what HAD to be the equivalent of a full gallon of Tropicana a-piece. I'd talk about the food, but honestly just the memory of all that orange juice sloshing around in my stomach has me feeling a little queasy. So here's my bare-bones assessment: Chicken And Waffles - 10/10 would munch on that again; Farmer's Skillet - a mini cast iron hot tub of cheesy mushrooms and taters that can't be beat; Waffle Skillet - glorified sausage-egg-and-cheese without the sausage or the joy; French Toast - unexceptional...but like it's still french toast so quit your whining; Huevos Rancheros - could def have more beans. But literally any dish could stand to have some more beans in my book. Beans are life. Two hours later, all five of us had unbuttoned our pants in an attempt to mitigate the extreme discomfort that only comes with a stomach that is literally filled to the brim with orange juice. I've never experienced anything like it -- a sloshy, decidedly un-tipsy walk home was enough to make me never want to even see the color orange again. There's a reason no words rhyme with ""orange""...it's pure evil. #NeverAgain.",2,3,2
57,Rachel F.,"New York, NY",334,160,41,2.0,7/7/2016,"Mercury Bar is a convenient watering hole if you live in Murray Hill. I had been here a few times with no real complaints, until I decided to come in for a bite with my boyfriend and his friend and to watch the NBA playoffs/finals/game (idk, sports?). Anyways, we sat down and immediately the waitress was rude to me. No idea why. I am always very aware of my behavior towards waiters and waitresses, I try to be as polite and upbeat as possible. She wasn't amused. At first my boyfriend told me I was being paranoid. But as she kept coming back and only speaking to him, he began to agree with me. It was crowded so I get that she didn't want to stand and chat, but then she brought me an ice water with a crumpled receipt floating in it... not even kidding. A receipt. This does not just happen by accident?? So anyways, instead of complaining (because I'm pretty sure we would just be met with more inconsideration) we just got up a went down the block to Tonic East.

Probably because she put enough sour mix.- Bartender couldn't make 2 of the cocktails on their menu. It was approximately 10pm - I guess maybe bar stops making cocktails that are on the menu at a certain time?- They carry a fair variety of beer and they even have cider.,,,

I note her successes (me) and her failures (my sister, Clarelle) and all the fond memories we shared. My mother drank Zima, which this bar does not carry. I drink white wine in its stead, which is not this bar's specialty. Clarelle tells me that I need to stop obsessing about my mother but she's just a harlot who is jealous of my reasonable weight.Some nights there have been 'beer pong' tables placed out, which are not good for those who are at this bar to mourn. Same goes for the music, which I would describe as 'bad for weeping' and 'junk a tramp like Clarelle would like.' A man here once asked why I was so sad and then offered to make me cry tears of joy while pointing to his 'penis.' That was sweet. They also have nachos.I will continue to come here weekly and cherish my beloved mother's memory. Clarelle will continue to galavant and bring shame to our name.

78,Benjamin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",87,316,1,3.0,9/15/2014,"With the departure of the Motor City Bar, this was my first attempt at the current Detroit Lions bar. My review is based on a Football Sunday. Pros: Lots of Lions gear in the house, along with a large, inflatable Lions player at the front. Good deals on larger amounts of beers (pitchers, buckets, etc.)Good deals on food. We had the start portion of wings, which was $6 for 10 wings. The wings are not very big, but still a nice deal. The server hooked us up with two different sauces, which she said is something they aren't supposed to do. Cons: For a team specific bar, there are many different games on. That brings in non-Lions fans. It was nice to see other games for fantasy football purposes, but I can do that at any bar. No specials on single drafts or bottles. The draft beer is served in plastic beer cups. Not the cheap kind that one would get with a keg, but something that looks like a traditional beer glass until you pick it up. Maybe I am a beer snob, but I thought it made the beer taste funny.Neutral: There is a DJ who plays before the games start and during commercials. It can get loud. (Not game, cheering loud...can't hear yourself over the music loud.)In conclusion, I would say that this isn't my type of bar. However, I can see how it would be the type for many others. The servers are easy on the eyes and there is alcohol and food. As a Lions fan, the search for my regular game watching bar continues.",1,,3

My boyfriend and his friend ordered several beers already and just wanted to keep their seats and enjoy the night. The bartenders and bouncers quickly took the regular's side, and just as my boyfriend came out of the bathroom he was kicked out in minutes.On top of that, they took away his beer, which he didn't even get to drink, without issuing a refund!

In mixed company (black, white, gay, straight, 21, 31, et al.) and looking for a place where everyone can have fun? Mercury Bar is your spot. And oh, is your cell on 3% and you're trying to update the homie on your whereabouts? They've got a phone charging station for that.I could say I wasted my youth at Mercury Bar. I just walk by on some days to see what's going on. I was definitely a regular here at some point between 2012 and 2014, especially on Friday nights when the place is usually live. Weekdays are a toss up. I've only been giving it a rest because, as I've entered my later twenties, I've found that my bed is more seductive than bar hopping. You'll seriously find everyone in here, from the transplant recent grad IB kids who've taken over Murray Hill, to us NYC natives of varying ages, work friends meeting up for happy hour and others who just came for the game and a cheap beer. It's much more diverse than a number of the other bars on the third ave strip, especially those between 34-35th street.The food at Mercury Bar is standard bar fare. I've had more actual meals at the 9th avenue location, which has a very different feel (no dance floor, less early twenties takeover). They used to have a great lobster special when I was a kid and would come here with my mother. I wish they'd bring that back, but I don't think they're competing for the sit down dinner crowd anymore. And lobster's ain't cheap.Mercury Bar's got some excellent happy hour specials you can check out here: mercurybareast.com/events. I've never been upset by anything I've ordered here. The nachos and wings are popular, as are the burgers. The servers are generally friendly and attentive. There was a bartender guy who'd been there for ages and was pretty cool, but I think he may have left :(The music: MercBar ALWAYS has good music. I have been here on a Monday at midnight and still, GREAT MUSIC. Often they will play videos that correspond and change with the music which enough places don't do. Get on this, bars of America. One minute it's 90s Mary J, next minute it's Major Lazer, next it's some Britney remix and then Rick Ross. And still somehow I can usually catch a groove. Sometimes I'll say I'll leave MercBar when the music gets wack and before I know it it's 3:00 a.m...which brings me to the below:Advice: The later you stay here the more random it gets. If you're a girl that means all of the cute guys you'd met around midnight have vacated the building and been replaced by skeevy creepers speaking broken English with a [insert language] accent lingering around waiting to see if they can bag the drunkest chick. Hopefully I'm not talking about you! But if that's what you're looking for by all means, enjoy! Otherwise leave before 3:00 a.m.",5,3,2

And ONE night had to ruin it all.The short version: I bring a group of about 7 or 8 folks here and we're at the bar hanging out, later decide to have a go at beer pong, the night progresses and wanes as the bartenders Sasha and Steve cry ""last call"". We're gathering our jackets and such. I can't find my wool overcoat. Everyone's looking around and helping, even the bartenders. Not sure who figured it out but a friend of Sasha's ""accidentally"" took my coat and left. How they figured that out I don't know. Sasha calls them so they can return, and they do. Things happen, I understand. But when they close up, we all leave, I say my goodbyes to my friends as they hop in cabs and their own cars. As I head to the subway I realize my very expensive LG Bluetooth headphones are missing, and my pockets have been ripped! I head back to Mercury and the manager is leaving, I ask where Sasha and Steve are and he says ""The Flying Cock"" which is right next door. They're at the edge of the bar hanging out after hours, having drinks and such. I knock on the window to signal for them to come out. They see me and signal ""What do you want"". I signal the 'headphone' signal and they're completely shewing me away. Total 180 from the kind of people they are when working. I knock on the window more to try to talk to them and another guy who is hanging at the bar tells me to ""Go away"" while Sasha and Steve at this point have their backs to me. I had no other choice but to call 411, 311, then 911 and scheduled for a cop to come and witness the incident. Had to wait outside in the pouring rain for about 40 mins until Sasha and Steve finally left the bar. ""What are you still doing here?"". ""I've been trying to tell you guys to call your friend again because he has my bluetooth headphones, they're very expensive..."" and so forth. Sasha and her guy friend hail a cab. Steve: ""Look, we'll just deal with this tomorrow. The guy'll be here some time tomorrow!"" Are you kidding me?? After brushing me off and me having to wait in the freezing cold?Sasha then yells at Steve to leave me and get in the cab, like I'm some sort of vagabond begging for change. They leave, the police finally come. I go through the entire scene with them, piece by piece. They say the best I can do is file an incident report against Mercury Lounge for now, which I did. I might've figured Sasha to be that kind of person, but not Steve. In the end, this could've all been prevented if they just had a conversation with me and called their friend instead of ostracizing a regular patron. And if they treat regulars like this, how will they treat folks they don't even know? After this review I'm not going to spend another minute of my life trying to deal with them. There are plenty of bars on 3rd Ave with cheap drinks and a more hospitable staff. I'll be sending everyone elsewhere. [That was honestly the short version]",4,1,

94,Jay L.,"Harlem, Manhattan, NY",160,572,45,3.0,10/7/2013,"First time here the other night...nice bar to go to with a group of friends. Great place to watch games. A friend of mine who was with me when I was here got her drink order wrong though...she ordered a vodka and cranberry and only got a cranberry juice. Not sure if the waitress who took our order is more so at fault for that or the person making the drink but I know who's ever at fault for that one has to be a little off to think that someone...at a bar...would just order cranberry juice...(confused look)My friend tried to get the waitresses attention the first few times to no avail so that she can get her right order and when she finally did it appeared that the waitress had somewhat of an attitude which is not cool at all, especially if you are looking for a good tip. Surprisingly enough my friend gave her a sufficient tip which I didn't think she would considering I know how she is when she gets upset and it ain't pretty, I on the other took into account the attitude the waitress had with my friend and only gave her a $1 tip and lucky for her that gratuity is already included in the bill cause she sure as hell did not deserve the extra that either me, my friend who got the wrong drink and other friends that I came with gave here.Nonetheless though Mercury Bar is still a real good place to come through too when in the Kips Bay area and want to kick back and watch some games with good company.",1,1,

Not one or two men - THE MAJORITY OF THEM.The staff is super nice and helpful so make sure you tell the bouncers what's up.

This place passed the eye test from the street so we went in.The atmosphere was chill, laid back. There was a beer pong table setup but no one was using it. There was also a dance floor and a DJ booth so I guess this place completely transforms on the weekends. During the weekday though, it made this place feel a little skeezy.The food overall was good not great. Fajitas tasted ok, no complaints. The drinks were dirt cheap though. I mean that in the nicest way. My coworkers and I couldn't believe the great happy hour deal. If our time there had only been during happy hour, this would have been a 4 star review.

I've made this place my birthday spot for the past 2 or 3 years. There is usually a good crowd that comes here. The prices for drinks are what you would expect for a typical Manhattan bar. They do have good happy hour specials, but other than that, you pay upwards of $12 after happy hour for special cocktails. This is a sports bar so whenever a big game is on, this bar is jumping with sports fan. Keep that in mind if you plan on coming here to party. On Friday night when I came here, after 11 PM, they turned the back seating area into a mini dance-floor which I loved. The DJ played mostly Top 40 hits. I love having a mix of all types of music, not too much techno, not too much hip-hop.My girls and I come here when we want to have a good time. We usually don't know when exactly the days are that they have dancing, but every time they do, it is a really good time and good fun. The drinks and food here are pretty good as well. The food is reasonably priced for a Manhattan bar and food comes out quickly. This is definitely a spot worth checking out. You'll have a good time on busy nights.",10,8,9

As if people don't get into an anaphylaxis shock from a peanut allergy.. Like it wasn't an important thing to worry about. Thank god I had Abby as a bartender to check up on me constantly to make sure I'm okay. DONT COME HERE IF ABBY ISNT HERE.

111,Dwayne P.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,0,2.0,7/1/2015,"Love the specials and the music.  However, what's going on with the selectively rude and inattentive bartenders?  We come here religioisly, day and night. We have encountered a total of 2 bartenders who actually understand what customer service is.  People do not go out just to spend money, they want that awesome service, especially if we (customers) have not provoked any thing but that.  This last instance, the bartender didn't hear what I ordered so I repeated to her the order. A simple order of wings.  She came back with two orders.  When i explained in only ordered 1, she attempted to chastise me stating ""You ordered 2"".  I know I'm not a small guy but I'm by myself and that does not follow any logic.  The two orders came in two separate plates as well. If I wanted to order a double order of wings for myself, wouldn't it come in one plate.  When you make a mistake why argue with the customer, when you are clearly wrong?This isn't your personal establishment so why leave customers with a bad taste in their mouths?",,,

So I yelped it, we got dressed and headed out. First off, there are no sneakers allowed at this location. For whatever reason. I don't wear sneakers, so I didn't care. Secondly, we were asked where we wanted to sit and was led through the rambunctious crowd who'd clearly had their share of drinks and was enjoying the music. Thirdly, we were asked if we wanted menus or just drinks by our waitress Victoria (whose the absolute best and sweetest). She made her way back and forth through the crowd with our drinks all night (and we had a lot), all smiles and recommendations. Lastly, and all that really matters...we had a blast! Different ranges of music, mixed crowd, no one was stush and drinks were good and strong. No complaints here!

They play all the current/mainstream songs, which is enjoyable so you can dance and sing along with your friends and enjoy the night.But BEWARE of the creepers--oh my god.

While trying to figure out where to go next, one of the bartenders brought us beers on the house and asked us if we wouldn't mind waiting to see if a table opened up. This nicety paid off-- a few seats opened at the bar and we claimed our seats and had a great time. All three bartenders were fantastic people; super nice and gave us a ton of attention even though the place was crowded. Food wasn't too bad (i.e. burgers, wraps, and wings).

I also had the Buffalo chicken sliders which were not bad but were not great either. I was annoyed by our waitress. She seemed like she was new. I asked her if I can redeem my Yelp coupon ($8 for two well drinks) that was given to me by checking in. She didn't know what it was...she went to ask her manager and never gave me an answer.

They have good drink specials as well.The one negative is the music is played at way too high of a volume, you have to yell to hear each other and after a while it actually hurts. Besides the volume, they play throwback songs from the late 1990s early 2000s which is fun.Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place.",,,

Although it is usually more crowded filled with the after work, after college crowd, we were happy to easily find a table at the rear of the bar. All tables here are either 2 seater or 4 seater stools with a small tabletop.  We had happy hour drinks which were $4, Buds, Bud Lights and Miller Light drafts, a little higher than elsewhere in the neighborhood but still  okay.Mercury has a fairly extensive dinner and bar menu. What stood out from their bar menu - a separate white menu handed to you if you arrive during happy hour - were the reasonable prices. There were four items, such as chicken wings and quesadillas, all under $8. The quality of the wings was not so good. They were heavily sauced and had that refried ""steamy"" quality that I dislike. As for the regular dinner menu, I tried the sirloin steak and brownie/vanilla ice cream dessert.  This is where Mercury hits the mark. The sirloin was done rare and was very tender. The sides were up to par with the steak. The side salad had a delicious vinaigrette dressing that just clung to the mesclun. The fries, I could tell were hand cut and very fresh. For dessert, the brownie was nice and warm, and went well with the heaping scoop of ice cream. This dessert was also surprisingly well-presented by a bar!As for the service, I think because of the smaller crowd, we profited from the attention of the bussers and waitress. I was surprised as I didn't get as much attention in past visits. Although Mercury is a mixed bag, (i.e. lots of tvs, sudden bursts of loud music, guys playing beer pong in the back), there is something for everyone here. If you a bit older like myself, you'll relive you college days here.  That's awesome!",,,
145,Jade W.,"Bronx, NY",8,38,0,4.0,8/8/2015,"We were drawn to the great happy hour- $5 cosmos until 8pm; drinks were strong! We ordered the pulled pork sliders (pork was juicy and sauce was tangy) and the appetizer platter/combo (mozzarella sticks, chicken tenders, bbq chicken wings, French fries and calamari).  Everything on the platter was good- tenders were juicy, calamari was tender and the wings had a good flavor. The waitress was very attentive! Will definitely go back for HH!",,,
146,Breezy B.,"Bronx, NY",48,8,0,4.0,8/16/2015,"Hands down this place can be either a hit or miss, but every time I've been here it was a great time. Barely a wait and no cover charge just come here and enjoy the dance floor and the music.",,,
147,Lily C.,"New York, NY",520,4,0,1.0,9/7/2016,"Went here after a concert with some friends. Probably the worst service I've ever experienced. Getting one drink each took wayyy longer than it should have. The waitress took forever to acknowledge we were sitting there for a while, then took forever to come back for drink orders. Drinks arrived... They fucked up a vodka red bull, and the waitress was so confused as to what we were saying and had no idea what drink it was, told us the bartender has no idea what he's doing because he's new. Wtf? I tell her it's impossible to fuck up a vodka redbull, and explained it's just half vodka...half redbull.... We quickly chug our drinks bc at this point we just wanted to get the fuck out of there. Of course, took forever to get our bill. It's not entirely her fault, because she shouldn't be the only waitress running the whole floor. Probably wouldn't come back again. We went down the block to Joshua Tree bar and had the best time there instead.",,,
148,Lia P.,"Loyola / Notre Dame, Baltimore, MD",0,3,0,2.0,10/16/2016,"Went here because a nearby bar was too packed and my boyfriend and I wanted to watch football and grab something to eat/drink. They advertise both outside and on the menu that they do bottomless brunch on Sat & Sun till 6 PM, but the waitress informed me after I ordered that this doesn't apply to football Sunday. Ordered the pesto flatbread to eat, which is advertised as pesto, garlic, tomatoes and basil. I got a flatbread with onions, cilantro, unripe tomatoes and no pesto. Tasted fine, just not what I ordered. Overall, very unimpressed.",,,
149,Samn R.,"Euless, TX",239,239,155,2.0,12/7/2013,"I went here for a Michigan State football watch party. It was packed. There was no where to sit, no where to stand and hardly any space to walk through - which was senseless because there was no available destination... unless you were going downstairs to the restroom. Speaking of the restroom... a little signage would be nice? I had to be redirected from the men's room (blush).This is not a proper venue for college watch parties. Maybe it's cool for other nights, but I prefer not being smushed up against some random guys crotch and relying on his cheers and groans to determine how the Spartans are doing.",,,
150,Danielle M.,"Manhattan, NY",0,6,0,3.0,9/2/2014,"Overpriced drinks, but the bartenders on Thursday/Friday night are killer. Super friendly, they will start feeding you shots- and even keep away the creepers, ladies.Bathroom, though....let's just say it could use some work.",,,
151,Sam L.,"Gaithersburg, MD",141,463,737,3.0,11/17/2013,"One of the best MSU alumni bars in NY.Even though I'm a DC resident, everytime when I visit NY over the weekend, I bound to end up at Mercury bar for a MSU game.  Plenty of TVs, Spartans specials and very nice waiters and waitresses.  The music choices are great and they play the fight song at very good timing.But there are a few shortcomings:- The food was just below average, even by bar standards.  We got a monster platter and two types of wings.  The chicken tenders were too dry, the calamari tasted too salty, the wings were very skinny, no one (6 of us) liked the mozzarella sticks, and fried pickles had too much breading.- Men's bathroom can use more frequent cleaning, especially when there's big games on in the afternoon (2-3pm).  Paper towels run out pretty quickly and they're not very good about refilling.- Too dark during afternoon games.  It could be brighten up a bit and not lose the TV or projector brightness.",,,
152,Melitza R.,"Brooklyn, NY",33,27,2,3.0,6/11/2015,Happy hour menu is sketchy.  There are TOO MANY TVS.  I repeat TOO MANY!!  We couldn't hear ourselves SCREAM.  The DJ was pretty cool but otherwise just too loud.  The drinks were nothing to write home about.,,,
153,Sara L.,"Brooklyn, NY",117,2,8,1.0,8/2/2015,so i used to love this place used to because last night i was pulling out my id and hes like you cant wear sneakers inside.... firstly they were cute secondly two girls came out wearing sneakers and thirdly its a spooooooooooooooorts bar if you want people to wear 5 inch heals then maybe try not having sticky floors and being a sports bar i didnt really care that much cuz i wasnt sober but if you want people to come back than stop being a total douche,,,
154,Ashley F.,"Los Angeles, CA",4,2,1,1.0,7/3/2015,"They don't let guys in with shorts and girls with ripped jeans. I came in with 2 rips in my jeans and they wouldn't let me in because I didn't meet the dress code requirements. The GM is a jerk btw, and he was very proud of the 10 people in his bar. So we went next door to Bar Rua and had a great time!",,,
155,Mike S.,"Jersey City, NJ",294,130,0,4.0,1/6/2013,"I can't vouch for the drinks here cause by the time we arrived, we were already blasted out of our minds. However, the scene was real fun. Good DJ and a large dance floor which never got too crowded.  Definitely a good place to go if you wanna let loose and not pay a $1000 cover to get into a megaclub.",1,1,2
156,Janelle M.,"ASTORIA, NY",10,19,17,3.0,2/10/2014,Nice place to have a couple drinks. Nothing crazy. A waitress had a small attitude when we didnt tip her right away but i dont care. We ended up leaving after a while. It wasnt a big deal. Wouldnt mind going again because its close by next to blockheads.,,,
157,Nicole K.,"New York, NY",188,33,8,4.0,10/23/2013,"I walked into this bar by complete accident. After exiting a cab with a group of lady friends, there happened to be a group gentlemen standing right outside our cab who refused to take no as an answer to, ""just have one drink with us."" So, we ditched our arranged plans and walked into the first bar we saw.It was a pleasant experience. They have small TVs which would be great had a game be on that evening. However, I was most impressed by the music. They played a mix of new and 90s which really got the crowd going. The back area was filled with lights and dancing. Everyone at the venue was having a great time and the energy was a great vibe. I will be returning in the future.",,,
158,Grace Y.,"Los Gatos, CA",311,39,27,3.0,10/2/2013,"Came here with my friend to watch a Michigan State University game on a Saturday and to also get some brunch/mimosas.  It's a pretty decent bar, and I love that there are TV's on every wall and corner.  There are multiple waitresses running around taking orders, but it's so hectic during game days that they sometimes forget about your order.  Luckily, my friend and I ordered our meals half an hour before the game started, so we got our food pretty quickly.  The food is okay, and it said on the menu that we would be receiving complimentary mimosas or bloody marys. Of course we couldn't pass on that so we each got a drink.  When we received our bill, we noticed that we were charged for the drinks, and the waitress told us that the deal was no longer available...thanks for telling us after we ordered!As for the ambiance, it's pretty great on game days. Everybody is friendly and it's a good time.",,,
159,Leo K.,"Brooklyn, NY",238,442,483,4.0,5/22/2013,"Good standard barFew times I came here it was nice and not crowded, and they have quite a few tables on the side and in the back.4$ happy hour for well drinks, can't you really go wrong with that on a Friday or any dayThe waitresses were attentive and quick with the drinksExtra star because they have phone charger lockers for 3 bucks, while I did not use it, every person I was with was mesmerized by this and wondered how every bar in the world doesn't have this. We unanimously agreed they deserve an extra point just for that.I must have fallen from another planet because I never saw that before",,,1
160,Lucy L.,"New York, NY",27,4,0,1.0,5/15/2015,Good music before but the new services sucks. The manager just was getting into an argument with me for no reason.. They have no customer service! When i approached the manager he kicked me out instead of talking to his bartender... Before there was a great bartender now it suckss don't waist your time!!!! By the wayyy they are extremelyyy racist they said I didnt speak English!,,,
161,Luke W.,"Brooklyn, NY",217,112,9,3.0,8/27/2012,"I'm actually kinda surprised that people have been rating it so bad.  I've been to this place a couple of times, and really, it serves its purpose.  The food fare is typical for a bar, and if my memory serves me correctly, it is slightly pricey but nothing too crazy.  The drinks are decent, typical Midtown type of place.  Prices are also average.The main purpose of this place at night during the weekends is for the dancing.  Reading some of the reviews, it was strange to see that people had such a hard time - I went out with a cousin and about 5 other people, and we had a pretty good time dancing for a while and had our own circle.  Crowded, but managable.People were not so much the typical bridges and tunnels crowd that you would experience in Murray Hill, actually people were quite friendly.  Coulda been because we were with a number of good looking girls too :).  Either way, people were joining our circle, and we all had a great time.A lot of the music is corny as hell, yeah, but that's what people want to hear these days.  Good dancing music, some 80s stuff but a nice variety that isn't dull.I gave a minus-1 star because of the midget Mr.T sweatin' me because I went over the velvet rope to stand with my cousin and friends.  Chuck Norris would be very disappointed in you, my friend.Overall, it's a nice place to hang and dance with some people you enjoy doing things other than talk about the weather and other trivial topics.",1,1,2
162,Shane C.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,4,5,5.0,8/19/2014,So I was originally going to go to blockheads for some cheap drinks and some tacos and on my way I saw this bar and they had $1 tacos. Who could say no right?? I really recommend this place to anyone! Really cool and chill setting and the music is pretty cool too. Everyday they have specials for you too!,2,,
163,Christina M.,"Brooklyn, NY",351,50,2,4.0,2/4/2013,"I love to come here for the music. My friends and I make our own space on one of those nights that you just don't really like dressing up and going anywhere with a cover or all the way downtown (they live 1/2 block from this location). Some nights are better than other, but I love the music, it is what keeps me coming back. Some nights are 90's throwbacks bringing me back to my childhood and then there are the hip-hop throwbacks that are just always a good time. One of the funnest nights I had in a while was here, when the DJ just kept playing all of my favorite music until 330am. I can't complain. The food is typical bar food and the drinks aren't anything to rave about, but when you are looking for a low key fun dance night, stop by. It can get really crowded, but I have never had a problem having a good time here.",,,2
164,Craig Q.,"Near West Side, Chicago, IL",0,6,3,2.0,11/29/2014,Don't order a strawberry mojito!  Plus they want to hold your credit card & DRIVERS LICENSE just to eat... RIDICULOUS!  Other than that... It was OK!  Music was good!,1,,
165,Alexander E.,"Manhattan, NY",15,16,3,1.0,5/19/2012,"This bar is a sh*t show, literally. Me and my friends were playing beirut right next to the waitress' bathroom and they all kept going in and out and the stench was hurtful. I think they might have all had a stomach flu or something. We didn't eat any of the food so I can't critique that, but there was something really wrong. I think there must have been, like, dirt on the floor or something because after playing beirut all four of us felt seriouslyill the next day. I'll probably go back to play more root, but I might make sure to wash the ping pong balls more after they fall on the floor.",3,1,1
166,Sarah G.,"New York, NY",179,350,239,1.0,4/26/2010,"Yep, this was my spot back in the day right after I turned 21 and didn't know any better.The drinks? Expensive. The crowd? Obnoxious. The guys? Molesters. The girls? Hoochies. The bartenders? Sheisty.The only thing saving this place is its location for those who think Murray Hill is the ""it"" part of town. The sheistiness? My ex left his credit card here by accident, and they swiped a $200 tab at 2:45 a.m. when we were out the door the night before by 10:15 p.m. Save yourself and go a few more stops downtown on the 6.",3,3,1
167,Cyrus P.,"New York, NY",841,876,530,3.0,7/1/2012,"If my memory serves me right, it was a Thursday after work and we walked into this place because a.) we were looking for a bar with a nice fun looking crowd, b.) it was ladies night here and they were offering 2 for 1 drinks, and c.) they had food and we were tired of walking.  Oh yea, and Blockheads was an hour and a half wait...We got in and quickly found a table by the front bar.  We sat down and observed everyone having a blast.  Waiting for a waiter, we spend 10 minutes discussing our work days until we realized that no one had come over to ask us for anything...  As we  searched for a server to make some eye contact with, finally a young lady came up to our table.  Young lady: "" We're serving free drinks, would you like one? It's a promo.""Us: ""Fuck Yea! Thanks!""The young lady came by after another ten minutes and gave us another round.  We continued to discuss our work days, problems, solutions, and ideas.  Then we realized that we had been here for a little over half an hour and still got no service...As we got up again to search for someone to order food from, two other girls came our way and asked us if we wanted beer?  At this point I was already feeling a little nice so I said 'Sure! why not?'.  They said it was a beer promo so the beers were free.  We both looked at one another, picked up our cups, and toasted with our beer glasses.  Again we continued to chat and again we got another round of free beers.  After almost an hour, we got up and left because we were hungry, went on over a few blocks down to Banc, and called it a great night!Total bill = $0 Dear Mercury Bar, please message me whenever you want us to come over and drink for free again.  Thanks! Sincerely yours, Roy P.",1,2,1
168,Jay L.,"Manhattan, NY",1,13,9,2.0,12/3/2012,"DON'T GO hERE ON A TUESDAY!!!!The ""bartender"" name Dana ( a gay guy) is very rude, and doesn't attend well to patrons....not even a good tip would make this guy smile.Years ago I would go to mercury, ...they would had juxbox, and it was very nice place to hang out...now it's just NOT the same....it's sorda like a scene Out of a frat party / with bartenders that you hire for the day.Any other day BUT Tuesday ....its a OK place",1,,
169,Valerie L.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,4.0,6/24/2016,I wasn't particularly looking for this bar but we happened to stumble upon it. They had GREAT happy hour prices on food and drinks. We got $5 frozen margaritas and $8 for cheese quesadillas and fried calamari. Food and drinks were both great. I also loved the music.,,,
170,Aaron R.,"Nashville, TN",7,99,0,2.0,3/15/2012,"Initially, I was so excited when I walked in this bar for the first time. Dark, but not gross and the patrons definitely had a good vibe going. However, what makes it or breaks it for me is service, because lets face it...anybody can put ice, vodka and soda into a glass. Well the service broke it. I had the misfortune of sitting on Dana's half of the bar. How do I know his name? Because he kept introducing himself to every female on  either side of my empty glass. When he wasn't doing this, he was busy in the corner replaying the same crappy songs over and over again. The woman bartender on the other half of the bar was kicking ass and taking names with her drink orders which caused it to be packed over there as she handled everybody who wasn't under 23, female and a size 0. Liquor tastes the same wherever you go, so go find somewhere where you can get treated well.",5,1,
171,Liz G.,"New York, NY",318,107,12,4.0,3/1/2012,"I normally go to the mercury bar by time square, however this location won me over.By far the music & ambiance is better. I also like that it has a dark grungy feel to it. I had chicken fingers & mozzarella sticks which were pretty good for a bar.What really won me over was how polite the management and staff were. I had a gift certificate for the 9th ave mercury bar, upon arrival the bartender said it was okay to use.When I went to close out my tab, I was told by the manager I could not use the certificate.After going back and fourth with him he honored the certificate and let the bar take a $50.00 hit.I thought it was very honorable of him to do that. This location has my stamp of approval!!!!",5,1,2
172,Natalie P.,"Bronx, NY",0,8,0,4.0,3/11/2015,"A little loud but this place is what a bar should be all about. Fast service, quality bar food (I just LOVE the calamari), good STRONG drinks, TVs for the sports nuts, a nice set of wines to choose from, comfy seats and doors that open up to outside. The staff is not snobby and don't push you. They don't rush you, they talk to you if you feel like talking. Plus if you order enough drinks, they'll give you a round on the house. NICE. The only reason why I take away one star is that it feels tight in there. I'm not sure if it's that there are too many seats or the fact that there's a row of tall tables between the bar and the booths, but it feels too crowded. Anyway, I still recommend it and go back when I'm around that part of the city.",,,
173,Lee S.,"Nanuet, NY",1,47,1,5.0,9/29/2015,"Always fine times here with stories to match. Like that one time two people were literally having sex on the back bar. Don't know what was funnier: them (thinking no one can see) or how upset Security was. Small dance space which makes the wannabe Micheal Jacksons irritating..... Drinks are decently priced for midtown. Overall, I keep coming back on a Friday or Saturday night",1,,
174,Patricia R.,"Tampa, FL",93,195,61,4.0,7/11/2014,Nice atmosphere.  Happy hour from 3 to 8 every day.  Omg 4 dollar frozen sangria on happy hour awesome. Bartenders are nice.  Food is pretty good and reasonable priced . They play good music also have a few tvs  for  all those sporting events . .gets pretty packed after 8 pm but before then enjoy happy hour and not as crowed.  No dress code or anything like that . Pretty good spot for after work meet up with friends.,1,,
175,Caprice J.,"ASTORIA, NY",23,9,0,4.0,6/20/2013,"I love this place, the service is awesome, even on packed nights the bar is pretty timely. The music is always really good and they play the music videos on their televisions when a game isn't on. Great place to go with a group of friends as they have a nice amount of seating. Extra restrooms downstairs is a plus. The food here is also pretty good by standard. I had the wings and a friend of mine had the disco fries. Both very good.",,,

Updated review","I see nobody from Mercury wants to respond to this. Thought I forgot this incident? It's been awhile. Maybe it's made up, maybe it's from the eyes of a drunkard. No. I won't forget it. How could I? I was left with a reminder. BTW I have had pain on dorsiflexion of my ring finger. I thought it was just a small sprain from when I fell down. It didn't resolve and it's there to this day. It's now clear it is a hairline fracture in my hand. Yes, caused by your BOUNCERS. If I had a video camera you would be sued. You guys are terrible. Yeah, laugh away. I know none of you care. Same I'd do if your bar burned down. I'm sure someone in the establishment reads these reviews. And you still have no response. Good for you. Most people care about their safety going out at night. It's a risk and many things can go wrong when all you're trying to do is go out have a good time. You'd think it's some random person starting trouble. NOT STAFF OF A BUSINESS TAKING YOUR MONEY. Been out hundreds of times in the city, honestly this night was THE most dangerous and dramatic for me. If you want to go somewhere safe, DON'T go to Mercury!!! There are other places that aren't cheap, dark, dingy divey bars where your life is at risk.THE WORST ESTABLISHMENT IN NEW YORK CITY",2,4,

184,SaSi C.,"Washington, DC",59,82,2,3.0,1/24/2014,I had a surprisingly good time when I went to this venue for a birthday party. Drinks are the same price range as other party venues in NYC.

185,Justin C.,"Manhattan, NY",167,20,0,1.0,10/6/2011,"I rarely write negative reviews but I went last week for the Yankees game 1 of the Divisional Playoffs. Any sports fan knows the game was rained out after 2 innings. I went planning to eat dinner and have some drinks while watching the game. Because of the game, not because I typically dress this way, I was wearing a Yankees cap and a Yankee t-shirt. I ordered two entrees and a bucket of beer and right as the food and drinks arrived, they announced the game was rained out. Even before I take my first bite the bus boys are trying to rush me away from my table because they want to clear it out for dancing (it's 9:30 and 1/2 empty). The only reason they want to do this is because the game is rained out. I told the bus boys this was ridiculous and that they at least were going to wait until I was done eating because I wasn't going to eat standing up. Finally, as I'm finishing my food, they literally pull the table out from under me. I then take my drinks to the bar just to finish the bucket I had bought and the bouncer comes over and basically kicks me out because I'm decked out in Yankees attire. The fact that I had just spent $120 in 35 minutes apparently didn't matter. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. AS***LE bouncer and bus boys, poor service and the food wasn't very good. Basically I just hate being rushed and the fact that it was not even half past nine and they were kicking me out just because the game was rained out really got on my nerves. So typical of a bar that isn't managed or run well at all. Guess that's why no locals go here and I've subconsciously avoided the place for the majority of the 5 years I've lived in Murray.",2,,1

189,Diana K.,"Brooklyn, NY",24,152,1,2.0,8/25/2012,"It was a friend's birthday and we came here for drinks and dancing.The music was pretty standard. Lots of Chris Brown, Katie Perry, mixed in with some older hits like AHHHH TSSSSS PUSH IT! The dance floor gets very crowded so everyone's rubbin' up on everyone and you gotta watch your toes, but it's a fun time for about an hour.The bouncer was nice to us girls, but a jerk to all the guys in our party. There are lots of rules. One (attractive) male friend couldn't get in because he was wearing a white tee. Would you deny James Dean? One (fashionable) gay friend couldn't get in because his shirt was sleeveless. I borrowed a jacket from someone in the bar and brought it out to him. They also made him take off his ostentatious necklace. Freakin' communists, those door lords....I understand and abide by dress codes at upscale joints, but Mercury Bar is a pretty low class watering hole for average-looking people to grope each other in the dark.",,,
190,Heather S.,"Brooklyn, NY",190,339,56,2.0,12/31/2011,"Wish I could have loved Mercury Bar but two key elements kept me from doing so...:1) It's in Murray Hill and I kind of hate Murray Hill. 2) You just charged me $8 for a Coors Light? $8?! Coors Light?! Really? C'mon.This is all true. I dropped in during Sunday football to watch the Jets get manhandled by QB Dog Killer, Tebow lose to the anti-Christ, and the Lions Megatron Miracle against the Raiders. Pretty cool bar, if you're a Lions fan. Ton of large screens and a bunch of smaller HDTVs showing the games, but with the focus primarily being on the Detroit games, seeing as how it's a Detroit bar. They keep the sound on for those games which is always a nice touch.Lots of rowdy fans, a ton of beers on tap, but the lack of Sutnday Funday drink specials really killed it. There's something about watching $8 disappear into a glass of water (yeah, I just said that about Coors Light) that really irks me.",1,,

Is this a whites only bar sorry to say.....we were kicked out because we were the only Africans there. I will NEVER go to this bar again. I never knew Racial prejudice still exists in the US.",,,
192,Mark N.,"Harrison, NJ",467,1606,6050,3.0,5/11/2012,"Late on a Thursday evening this dark and somewhat cavernous place was packed with ,mostly drunk early 20-somethings bopping to Top 40.. if Katy Perry is your thing you will be happy.. I hung out by the bar mostly, my bartender, a pretty young lady, was efficient and professional. they have a few different beers on draft, pretty full bar, some TVs with sports, and a dance floor area.. restrooms downstairs were relatively non-nasty by bar standards. nothing too memorable or distinctive about the place, but the relatively reasonable drink prices and liveliness (at least on a random thursday night) make it seem a reasonable option..",,,
193,LaTrenda S.,"Queens, NY",144,51,17,4.0,7/15/2013,This is absolutely my favorite place to go for lunch during the work week. The chef is amazing. Food is so delicious it ceases to amaze me. Everyday is a different special and so far after going 3 days in a row...very impressed. LOVE!!!! This place is a gem.,2,,2
194,Jay P.,"Manhattan, NY",0,34,1,1.0,10/30/2015,"I don't know what happened to this place. My friends and I have been here hundreds of times over the last 8-9 years and have never had a problem. We went here almost every Friday night for many years and we were very close to some of the bar staff. However, we haven't been here in about a year and decided to visit tonight. And the strangest thing happened. As my friend I are sat at the front bar with our drinks we asked the female bartender (not the pretty tall one, but the older one) if our friend was expected to work tonight (unaware that this person no longer works there). In an accusatory manner, she asked why we were there and implied we were some sort of undercovers who need to leave them alone. I don't know if this women was up to something shady, but her response was completely rude and it was embarrassing. We've always enjoyed this bar and were looking forward to going back, but this situation was completely uncalled for and my friends are I are certainly never going back.",,,
195,Marina K.,"Brooklyn, NY",183,336,85,4.0,6/8/2013,"Your standard bar, EXCEPT they get serious points for having lockers on the wall where you can charge your cell phones for 3 bucks. Genius! All bars should follow suit!",2,,1
196,Brittany P.,"North Babylon, NY",161,80,21,4.0,3/16/2014,"Came here on a Saturday night after hopping around day drinking so this review might not be the most detailed lol. Place isn't that big however it holds a lot of people as it was PACKED. Decor ect is nothing to write home about. I liked how the bathroom was downstairs as that gets rid of the bathroom line crowd at least. Drinks are average price for this type of place. I had an absolute blast dancing here for hours, surprisingly good dj considering the venue. One large bar when you walk in, and one in the back at the end of the dance floor. Quick bartenders. Would definitely come here again if I'm looking to dance the night away without looking for anything fancy.",,,
197,Margaret L.,"New York, NY",1,23,0,4.0,6/5/2014,"I came in here after having dinner in the area on a monday night, just looking to have a few drinks with friends. It was really busy for a monday night, it may have had something to do with the $1.00 drafts (Coors and Bud). The bartender was KILLING it with the music, mainly 90's/00's pop music, which i really enjoyed. The bartender was great and gave us drinks and shots (which was very unexpected for a Monday). Not my favorite bar, but definitely a great and unexpectedly fun night.",,,
198,Matt G.,"Bronx, NY",0,44,0,1.0,3/12/2013,"I have been here several times and every time I leave disappointed. I really wanted to like this place because I am a Detroit Lions fan and the show all their games but the bartenders are obnoxious, the bouncers are aggressive, the drinks are over priced and like all places with bad service the gratuity is included.",3,,
199,Jane P.,"Chelsea, Manhattan, NY",81,69,7,1.0,4/5/2014,"This review is for the ambiance only, as I didn't eat here. It was incredibly crowded and filled with weird older men just trying to ""get it in"". The music was alright but the whole place just reeked of beer and urine and was overall trashy. I ended up leaving after 15 minutes.",,,
