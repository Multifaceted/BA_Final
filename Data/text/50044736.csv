0,Annie T.,"New York, NY",7,120,204,4.0,11/11/2018,"After dining at Sushi Yasaka across the street, we wanted to grab a drink, and Gebhard's loud, bold-faced signage beckoned to us. I also think the bar has a name with great allure.This place is so wonderful! It's just a chill, low-key bar (but not divey) with a ton of beer options, including flights. When we went in on a Friday night around 9:30pm, there was still plenty of seating available. I must say that the standout feature was its music! I struggled deeply to Shazam practically every song they were playing, though each attempt was a failure given the din of the chatting patrons. The two songs I do remember from that night were The Stooges' ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" and The Replacements' ""I Will Dare,"" if that gives you an idea of the ~*bar vibes*~.",,,
1,Ryan S.,"Pasadena, CA",160,504,13,2.0,10/28/2018,"It was a party of the three of us on Thursday, October 25th at about 7:30PM.   You walk down into a basement bar, which kind of looks like a dive bar, but pretty popular.  I found this place on Yelp, which most people enjoy; however, we had a totally ""off"" experience.We sat at a table and took a look at the menu.   You order at the bar, and the food is brought out.  Well, all three of us ordered food.  My food was one of the specials. I think it was a chicken cheesesteak grilled cheese.   Guess what? They forgot it!  Yes, the food for the other two people came out, and then I waited an additional five minutes and then I inquired at the bar. They told me that ""she forgot to put it in"".  All in all, I received the food 25 minutes after the other food was brought to the table.On the menu, it says the sandwich comes with House Made Chips.  Guess what?  It doesn't.   My plate came piled with very stale bagged tortilla chips.  I'm not kidding.  One bite of those, and I was most certainly not going to consider continuing with those.Meh.....probably wouldn't come back, unless someone else really wanted to go.",1,,
2,Rex K.,"Toronto, Canada",0,463,5,4.0,10/7/2018,"There's a little seating area at street level, but otherwise this place looks like your typical basement dive bar from the outside. However, once inside you realise looks can be deceiving. As the name implies, Gebhard's specialises in beer. They have an absolute huge selection of beers of every style imaginable, from lagers, through IPAs, stouts and wheat beers to ciders and more. Many are on draught, with an even largely selection of cans and bottles.The staff are very friendly and helpful with guiding you to a style of choice if you're undecided on what to drink. There is a typical bar food menu, which helps fill a hole, but is nothing special. This is not the place to come to for a nice meal, but for sure is somewhere to come for the beer.I'm looking forward to going back next time I'm in NYC.",,,
3,Lucy M.,"Gainesville, FL",1,5,0,4.0,11/18/2018,"Good draft beer selection for the UWS. Very nice bottle list. I got the wings which were very good but a little bit spicy (granted I'm a huge baby when it comes to spice, but a warning would have been appreciated). Service was very good and bartenders were friendly despite being busy on a Saturday night. I would be likely to come back if I was craving a decent draft beer and didn't want to have to travel far.",,,
4,Ingrid S.,"Brooklyn, NY",815,1317,10936,4.0,2/21/2018,"I've been here a number of times so far and have failed to pen a review. The bar is the brother/sister co-owned bar of Beer Culture in midtown (which I've also frequented a number of times). Usually this spot participates in the beer and whiskey etc passports that give you great deals on drinks at different spots you wouldn't normally find or check out on your own or maybe would. But it opens you to new and fun spots like this one. A few of my friends are obsessed with the dive Irish bar next door. I'm more obsessed with craft and refined beers than dive pubs but both are special in their own way. Beer is priced a bit more expensive than some spots but there's a dollar off on drafts during happy hour. Caught up with a friend recently and was surprised to have three craft beers come out to just around twenty bucks still. Not bad. Tried their tots and dipping sauces (spicy mayo/some kind of pineapple pepper jam relish). They also have poutine and cheese curds on the menu which almost happened but I restrained myself. The staff is great and makes great recommendations. I really wanted 'Sweet Baby Jesus' (trust me in that it's a beer and I'm not a religious fanatic and a delicious one at that's brewed with peanut butter) and they thought they ran out of it but literally dug into the back of the fridge to find the last bottle for me. Winning. Not a lot of bad things I can say about the spot especially when they have imperial stouts, porters, brown ales, triple ipas, belgium beers you've never heard of before in your life. If the draft menu doesn't suck you in they have hundreds of bottles in the fridges. You can also take beer to go for pretty much half the price of what you pay to cork it and drink it in the shop.",6,,2
5,Sonal B.,"New York, NY",55,170,20,5.0,2/18/2018,"The vibe was great for a Sunday night neighborhood bar. Even though the food menu is limited on a Sunday evening, the fried cheese curds are quite good. I'll go again just for the energy!Service is quite friendly too. I tried the ""two roads"" beer and I am a blue moon drinker. Not good ;) but then I found out that you can actually sample before you order. Next time I'll do that.",1,,
6,Eliza G.,"New York, NY",58,89,46,4.0,6/17/2018,"We love Gebhard's! It's a great place to go when you're craving a craft beer and a chill atmosphere. This is one of our favorite spots to visit. Trivia on Monday night at 8:00 is a ton of fun (down with the Blue Shells!!). The beer selection is excellent, and the service is very solid. The bartenders are knowledgable and on top of things. They have my favorite buffalo wings in the neighborhood.There are a few things I really love about Gebhard's that I don't normally notice about a bar. First, the temperature control in the main bar area is great. I know that might sound silly, but it makes such a difference! Second, the Wifi is really good. This is helpful because, at least with AT&T, there is zero cell signal (which honestly can be a nice break). The ambience is relaxed and divey, but tidy, and the bathroom is clean and quite charming with its chalk-covered walls. There is only one thing about Gebhard's I don't love, and that's the instructions about how to handle your check written on the wall by the cash register. I know working in a bar can be busy and challenging, so I'd like to help by asking for my card in the way that suits the staff; the trouble is, I've noticed that what's written on the board changes, sometimes in contradictory ways (""We don't care about your f&*%ing bank"" vs. ""Tell us your bank""). I always feel a tiny bit like I'm walking on eggshells so as not to inadvertently annoy the bartenders. I hope I've done okay so far, because both the beer and the service are great!Also just want to give a shoutout of thanks to this place for offering a variety of price points. It makes a big difference to be able to order your favorite upscale beer and then continue the fun into the evening without going completely broke!",2,,2
7,Artim A.,"Thomaston, CT",0,33,18,5.0,11/11/2018,Stopped in for the first time yesterday and everyone and everything was great staff was very knowledgeable on there beer selection and there was a lot of beers the gbc burger was slamming it was freaking delicious only small complaint I would have is the tortilla chips on the side didn't make much sense I woulda rather a classic lays chip or something equivalent but everything was perfect I will definitely be stopping in here again,,,
8,Chris M.,"Manhattan, NY",824,153,147,4.0,11/28/2017,"Cool bar in the Upper West Side.The lady and I were on a casual stroll one Saturday (11/04/17) afternoon and stumbled upon Gebhard's.  It turned out to be a great find!The setup is a welcoming beer hall.  Bar and table seating towards the back with televisions playing football - that's my kind of scene.  There's a smaller section upstairs that includes darts and foosball.  Patrons and bartenders alike were very friendly.The beer selection was legitimate.  There was a good variety of known classics and harder to find craft beers.  For example, Lawson's Sip of Sunshine was in stock during my visit.  Food options included bar favorites and a weekend brunch menu.  We had the fried chicken sandwich and nachos.  Both items filled the spot.I recommend coming here if you're looking for a casual hangout with good beers and ample food.  I know I'll be back!",6,1,5
9,Billye D.,"Brooklyn, NY",143,113,70,5.0,9/14/2018,Good little spot great selection of beers and the food was  burgers were great but a little to salty for me but other than that great spot to hang out in,,,
10,Sophie G.,"New York, NY",307,45,45,4.0,5/12/2018,"I live in the Upper West Side, and Gebhard's has been on my list for a few months now. I was looking for a local bar close to home, that had a chill vibe and wasn't ridiculously over priced.Finally came on a rainy Saturday night, and it was everything I hoped it would be! Not too crowded, very laid back vibe (you can come in your hoodie and Nike's and it's all good!). Beers are decently priced ($6-$9), and all their beers are listed on a big chalk board near the bar. Definitely a ""local"" NYC spot for those who don't like the big crowds, ridiculous clubs with cover charge, or overpriced cocktails. They also have a pretty great food menu even though we didn't eat. Poutine, wings, loaded nachos, tater tots, all the great bar foods you could imagine while sipping on your IPA. Next time there's a major sporting event on TV, we'll definitely be there!",1,,

Updated review","I realized a review update was in order!  Much of the original review stands (the poutine remains magnificent, the beer selection vast, the service friendly) but there are a few big changes:- They have liquor now.  No mixology here, but if you want a drink or a shot, you got it.- Thie chicken sandwich is now fantastic.  The menu overall's changed a few times since this place opened, and while some changes were sad (they had this pickle-heavy salad that was unique and terrific and I miss it often), other changes were for the better.  The chicken sandwich is one of these changes for the better.  They have events like trivia nights, and some board games behind the bar.  It gets lively, but not usually crowded, in the evenings.  I like it best earlier and on weekends, though, when it's quiet and you can hear the soundtrack that the weekend bartender, Priscilla, picks out.",3,2,2
12,Jazz C.,"Manhattan, NY",2,112,370,4.0,8/18/2018,Good spot to try many different beers at reasonable prices.  While I wouldn't call this a gastropub the food is pretty descent such as the fish tacos and tater tots (best thing).  The sliders and buffalo wings were just ok.  You order drinks and food at the bar and they bring the food to you.  Place gets pretty loud even when not fully packed so if that is your scene then great.  HH ends fairly early so if you get off work at 5 then you are out of luck.,,,
13,Peter V.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",8,13,15,5.0,8/27/2018,"I really can't say how much I enjoyed this place. I was scouting bars for a watch party I was hosting and this was the spot. Their extensive been selection was incredible. All the beers on tap are written on a giant black board and you have so many to choose from. The menu of bottles and cans are nothing to sleep on either. The food was really great as well. The giant pretzel was cooked perfectly and not heavily salted. The small nachos was big enough to feed my 6'6"" 350 lb brother and 3 others. The wings were loaded with flavor. The sliders were my favorite. They tasted perfect warm soft bun, sautéed onions and cheese. Can't go wrong with that. My group had a great time. I highly recommend this place if you are a beer connoisseur. They even have a cool small game room upstairs. You will not be disappointed.",,,
14,Brigitte S.,"Honolulu, HI",653,391,6228,4.0,7/6/2017,"I read about this place in a foodie article on the top 10 places to go in the city right now [summer 2017] and this joint sounded like a decent place we could hit up for snacks and craft beer. We wound up really needing a drink and somewhere to sit and think about what we needed to do next so we walked over out of Central Park.We almost walked right past the entrance so don't let it slip by you - you walk downstairs into a basement bar that has both sidewalk awning seating as well as an upstairs area with tables, games and balcony seating. Service is a no go but they do for free wifi which is a plus. They had a good amount of beers on tap as well as a hefty bottle and can list. They had some NY beers but I'm an IPA gal and found myself gravitating to the bottles. Beer was decently priced. All my beer was tasty but I didn't really try the tap stuff. My boyfriend enjoyed his beers though and he tried a few. You go up to the bar yourself for service.The menu actually has some tasty sounding items like burgers and chicken sandwiches, poutines, and tater tots but we just wanted a snack and I love me some cheese so the fried cheese curds with a spicy sweet pineapple chutney sauce. They were fried to perfection and the sauce was bomb. I was licking my silverware. It sort of reminded me of pimento cheese flavors when you ate it all together. I almost ordered seconds! They actually had a whole list of sauces they make for dipping you can order and I almost ordered fries just so I could try all the delicious sounding sauces. Definitely a nice low key pub craft beer joint with tasty food and a great place to hang with friends. I will be sure to stop back in here next time I'm in town.",3,1,5
15,Katrinka K.,"Omaha, NE",327,99,67,3.0,1/2/2018,"So this is a cool spot in UWS.  I think they are going for a German-ish beer hall, while it doesn't quite hit the mark they have a killer tap list, it is quite and you feel like you can just hang out. The food is just ok. Orders the burger the bun was a little dry and the burger was just lack luster. Also had the poutine with tater tots. They use chicken gravy and it is a little salty but with a coffee stout anything tastes pretty good.",1,2,
16,John V.,"Albertson, NY",12,3,0,2.0,10/10/2018,I've been here a few times but will never go back. I've been because they have a great selection of beers and the staff is ok. If you are not a working person and have lots of daddies money then this is for you. If you are a working guy/gal looking for a fair price and maybe a buy back( they don't know what this is) then this is not the place for you. Very expensive and don't even try to make you feel appreciated,,,
17,Mike B.,"Washington, DC",24,136,508,4.0,6/7/2017,"A great beer bar on the upper west side. They have a good selection of bottles and cans as well as a significant tap list. Service was prompt and friendly. I enjoyed the cheese board and the pretzel. The Maudite was a very nice brew. Malty and spicy, but not so intensely alcoholic as similar beers. The Shake chocolate porter was a pleasant surprise. Much less hoppy than most beers from the Western US, and with strong chocolate notes that manage to not seem artificial. (A rare trick for ""chocolate beers"", in my experience.) La Trappe Isid'or was very effervescent and had notes of spice.",1,,
18,Anita V.,"Manhattan, NY",22,93,44,4.0,1/8/2018,"Really enjoyed this spot! Came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and really dug the vibe, the food, the location and the service. Let's dive in, shall we?The vibe is your typical pub feel sans the sticky, musty smell of ages old layers of beer. This place is clean yet fun and homey.  I could see this place getting packed on thurs or fri night. For brunch it was the perfect mix of knowing its day time and get hiding from it because it's a little lower than street level.After ordering the food came within 15 mins and it was perfect and just what we needed. I had the BLT with tater tots and I mean how can you go wrong with tater tots?  And my partner had a smoked sausage with cheese curds, another win.We really didn't come in for any libations but the barkeep was extra welcoming and patient, and recommended ciders that we both enjoyed very much.   Though I'm not in this area often, really hope we can come back again.",,,

21,Kendall F.,"Austin, TX",4,4,3,1.0,3/3/2018,"Uncomfortable, sexist experience at what is otherwise a lovely neighborhood joint. Last night, I went to grab a flight of beers with a friend at the bar and noticed that half the bartenders were wearing black shirts with the word ""WHORES."" written in bold letters across the front. I chatted with bartender Max, who was wearing one of the shirts, and he said that WHORES. is the name of a band (composed of three middle aged white dudes) from Atlanta. I explained to him that, as a customer, I wasn't happy with the connotations behind the shirts, and Max simply told me that I wasn't the first customer to raise concern and that I should listen to the band. Gebhard's, I hope in the future you won't condone staffers wearing apparel that makes half the population (aka women) feel demeaned and lesser-than. This place is super close to where my good friend lives, but I'll definitely think twice about ever going back.",13,12,3
22,Colin H.,"Washington, DC",1,5,0,5.0,10/24/2018,I ordered the knockwurst BP style and it was honestly the best sausage I've ever had. Good beer selection. Friendly staff.,,,
23,Atavia W.,"New York, NY",25,31,1,5.0,2/15/2018,"This place is AWESOME!! I don't know where to start... Space--There are two dynamic environments to choose from: lively downstairs and cozy quiet upstairs. We decided to sit upstairs to watch the olympics and engage in conversation. If you're into darts, that's available upstairs. Chill place. Downstairs is cool too but gets a bit crowded.Service-- Although everything has to be ordered at the bar, the service was fantastic. I have to mention one person in particular - Michael. He was the absolute BEST!! The channel was changed to basketball downstairs which changed our Olympics winter games upstairs. We asked Michael if he could change it back and made several trips upstairs to make it happen. Very appreciative of Michael at this establishment. Thank you!Food-- I ordered the sliders with fries and my friend ordered a burger with fries. Both cooked to perfection. Bread was good too. The sliders were so good that I'll definitely be back for the burger. The beer selection is vast and offers an option for every tastebud :) You have to try this awesome place. You cannot go wrong here.",1,,
24,Serg R.,"ASTORIA, NY",5,13,0,4.0,7/22/2018,"Definitely worth checking out. Nice staff, pretty good bar food, great selection of beers, and low-key unpretentious vibe. Try the giant pretzel and the sausage party.",,,

27,A C.,"Burke, VA",0,8,2,4.0,3/19/2018,"Looking for a quick, but somewhat hearty meal after running the NYC half marathon, we decided to check this place out since it is close to the place we were staying. There's no table service; you order at the bar, which wasn't a problem. We sat at the bar, but there are tables in the bar area, seating upstairs and in another room on the main level. We ordered the burger with a side salad and fish tacos with a side of fries. Both looked very appetizing. I ordered my burger medium, but it came out looking well done. It was still juicy and very tasty. It really hit the spot for me. I would order it again. My husband also enjoyed his fish tacos. We both decided we would come back to try some of their other dishes. In other establishments, when we are seated in the bar area, service is usually pretty bad so I was initially concerned. But the bartender on Sunday was very attentive and friendly.",,,
28,Bill T.,"New York, NY",1325,2208,8237,3.0,7/28/2016,"Not a bad place.  It's an interesting setup.  When you walk in, by descending some steps, there is a little bar up front but most of the action takes places at the back bar.  When I was there, service was friendly but very slow, even when there was only one other person waiting to get a beer.    They had three kegs that were tapped but didn't bother to erase the beers on the chalkboard sign until about an hour later (that's a pet peeve of mine).   I didn't understand why the didn't just erase it after I heard three people ask for a beer that was already gone.   The reason that's a pet peeve is because they have to explain that the beer is out and then the person has to make another decision so it just takes  even longer to get a beer.Prices are high.  $9 a mason jar of Greenpoint Hook, Line & Sinker?  That would be pricey for  a pint much less a small jar.  Also paid $9 for a pint of Gun Hill pale ale.   I liked the beer selection but I'm not a fan of waiting long periods to overpay for beer.    Not my type of place, but give it a try.  It's a decent vibe.  And the tater tots are very good!",14,10,13

I tried the entire time to grab the bartenders attention, but eventually I decided to give up and leave. This is after I came here two weeks ago because of the beer selection. That visit, I waited about 10 min before I was briefly greeted. I waited another 15 min. and then people who sat down next to me ordered and were served. I was ignored. I knew exactly what I wanted to order both times and wasn't given enough regard to convey that. I tried politely to grab their attention and even returned today, chalking my first experience up to fluke. Neither time did the bartenders seem especially busy.

Our food was delayed for about an hour and a half and that was strange-but the bartender told us that they would give us a beer on tap for free because our food took so long to get to us. We had an overall good experience-would go again!",3,,

Come summertime Gebhard will be a popular spot so get there while you can to check it out. As for the food, the prices seemed a bit high, but hey welcome to NYC right?Cheers!",,,

Sister bar of Beer Culture in Hell's Kitchen, this spot is similar but with more room, beer, and food.Barely anyone inside on a Sunday afternoon, so got to pick one of the many tables around. Bartender is really nice as we slowly picked the beers we wanted for the sampler ($12). Solid variety in the drafts: IPAs, stouts, lagers, marzen, schwarzbier, and even a sour. Upstairs a few games like shuffleboard and darts, with comfy couches near the window.Again, setup here is amazing, and the craft beer list is solid. Didn't get to try the food, but the nachos looked pretty good. Definitely the best beer bar option in the neighborhood.",2,,1

They have so many beers - it's really a beer culture. If you like craft beer- this is the place for you. They've added liquor and of course they have wine. I've order food too and each time I get an elevated version of bar comforts. Try the sliders with waffle fry buns - it will change your life. I have to mention the staff again - bc really these guys are the heart of this place. Their passion for beer, music, food and friends is really what sets this place apart. They've done a great job at creating a sociable, safe and fun place in our community.

49,Justin L.,"New York, NY",904,988,34,4.0,5/10/2017,"The UWS side is a wonderful place to live.  It has the general amenities of the city while being distant enough to retain a neighborhood vibe.  But one thing the UWS is lacking in is top flight beer bars.  This is a real problem for a beer guy like me.  Especially in comparison to the UES which has heavy hitters like the Jeffrey, Bondurants and Pony Bar, the UWS needed badly to step up its game.  Enter Gebhard's.  An extension of the Beer Culture location in midtown, this place goes a long way towards filling that void.  The setup is weird as the bar is in the basement of the building, there's a zoo exhibit-esque viewing area on street level that you can walk up to, and there's a random upstairs seating area (separate from the other one) on the 2nd floor which also houses the bathrooms.  The front door also doesn't close by itself so if you're sitting by the door then expect to be regaled by the bartenders yelling at people to shut it.  Regardless of this, the bartending staff is otherwise friendly and knowledgeable about their beer.  For items on draft, they offer 2 sizes you can order across a well represented, diverse array of styles.  Breweries vary from NYS locals to the usual craft beer suspects, but each time I've been I've found more than 1 thing on draft that was worth having.  Even if there isn't anything on draft, they have a huge bottle selection that can either be enjoyed in house or to go a la places like the late Bierfkraft, Good Beer and Top Hops.  This is a huge plus as while the setup is strictly a bar, the place doubles as a beer store.  Food is good quality.  First time we came we had nachos which were very good and a huge portion.  Second time I had a burger which, while very good also, just wasn't worth the $20+ they were charging.  It seems like every bar/restaurant is using the recent 'fancy burgers' trends as an excuse to upcharge on otherwise ordinary burgers.  I'd stick to the sausages here instead as they looked great and are more moderately priced.  This aside, consider me a big fan of Gebhard's!",1,2,

Updated review","Just wanted to leave a quick update to note that I went back with a friend thanks to the good beer passport. The only beers that were eligible = a couple pilsners that didn't really taste like anything (not even like a crisp, light beer, just... nothing). A better bar that only wanted to cover $6 toward the advertised ""free"" craft beer might've said anything up to $6 is free, if you want something else, you pay the difference (of $1-3). Not Gebhard's. So much disappointment (which is strange, given that this hasn't been my experience at all at the midtown location).",1,,
55,Patrick O.,"Coeur d'Alene, ID",14,213,449,5.0,3/14/2017,"I debated on giving Gebhard's four stars but decided to go with five b/c of the service.  Yes, it can be slow.  And was for a period of time when it got busy.  They only had one bar tender working and I waited for what seemed like forever (we'll call it  well over 5 minutes) at the bar for service.  But the redeeming factor was that the bartender acknowledged me waiting, thanked me for my patience, remembered my tab, and thanked me by name when I tabbed out.  I really feel like the effort put forth outweighed my wait for the beer.  They have a great selection of beer with plenty of localish brews on tap.  There is a dartboard upstairs.  I personally liked the dark, cozy, tavern feeling that the back of the restaurant provides.  And if that's not your jam then you can sit closer to the front where you have views of the street.  If I have any complaints, it would be that it could use slightly bigger TVs.  I was sitting away from the bar and had a hard time making out what was going on (it was selection Sunday).",2,,1
56,Katie H.,"St Petersburg, FL",170,24,2,5.0,9/15/2017,"Great spot on the UWS for those of us who feel juuuuust a bit old at the mainstream Amsterdam bars (rhymes with Schmakes Scmilemna and Schin Scmill). Good crowd on a Thursday night, but not crowded by any means. The bartenders know their stuff, which is great for someone like me who doesn't. I told them the two beers I remember I like and they found perfect compliments for both. The flights are great too, to try different beers (of which they have a TON). As far as food, I'll agree that it's slightly overpriced but pretty much everything is on the UWS. I had the sliders, which delightfully came on a pretzel bun, and they were delicious. My date had one of the brats and he seemed to thoroughly enjoy it too. Two thumbs up for Gebhard's!",1,1,

59,Melissa S.,"Manhattan, NY",244,545,8,3.0,2/18/2017,"I was quite disappointed in this bar. Their tap list was pretty mediocre for a place that has the word beer in the name. I came here with a group of people and a few of us ordered food. Although people all had different things to eat, the sentiment was the same: overpriced low quality food. $18 for a burger is far from unheard of in New York but for that price, it should be half decent. Also, charging extra for fries instead of chips? Now that's just obnoxious.",2,2,1

66,Hilary C.,"Bronx, NY",1,83,0,5.0,4/25/2018,"I checked this place out because I had a gap between leaving work and heading to the cinema, and I discovered that I am quite late to the party. This is a comfy, divey place filled with people who, like me, enjoy drinking beer. I happened to be in the mood to sit and drink and read an e-book on my phone, and despite the noise it was a relaxed atmosphere for doing so. They do indeed have a terrific beer selection -- also nice, clean taps and properly poured. You can get wine and cocktails. It's a drinker's bar. I wasn't exactly sure when my companion would arrive on the nearby subway, but he texted me in time to motivate a food order. We had some french fries and sliders, which were tasty and reasonably priced considering the neighborhood. If I want either drinks or food or both in the future, I'll return and order with confidence. Not sure I'd want to go too late, as I suspect people get pretty hammered!",,,
67,Kyle B.,"New York, NY",200,11,0,2.0,5/24/2017,"I would have given less stars but the BURGER and beer selection saved the day.  Here's the problem and hopefully management will look into this. A female bartender took our order and recommended the poutine and even delved into why she was recommending it. We then watch her leave from behind the bar with no bartenders behind the bar working; bar is busy. We watch her start drinking beers with friends. Our burgers come out but no poutine. We wait and wait while we watch her sit at the bar (another bartender started to serve drinks) and drink. She pounds the rest of her beer and then goes right back to work behind the bar. At this point we're all done with our food and ask her what's going on with the Poutine- she admits she forgot to put the order in which is harder to digest since she gave us the rundown on why we should order it. How can you explain something with extra detail and then forget about it completely less than a minute later? We complained to the male bartender he took a beer off our tab. It seriously felt like we were on an episode of ""Bar Rescue"" before John Taffer steps in. I want to give it a second chance but not for food, think we'll have to stick with just the beer. Simply put- this is what happens when there is staff drinking at work.",2,3,

Of course, it's only been open for a week, and they haven't even hung their permanent signage, or opened the enclosed sidewalk area to customers. So I hope they can attract enough customers to justify the rent, while still offering the personal space I hold so dear. It's a tricky balance.But hey, the Emerald is still kicking, just a few doors down, and they always have plenty of free space. What Gebhard's offers over the Emerald is an impressive beer selection, and a less funereal vibe.The food I've tried so far, the burger and the chicken sandwich, have been great. Even without the pickled jalapeńos, which I didn't know existed, but now love, it would be a quality burger.Anyway, let's keep this place in business, but save me a seat.",2,1,3

A beautiful blossom of beer and Bacchanalia in a neighborhood that has desperately needed more of both. I love Beer Culture, so I was pretty excited to hear they were opening a second location uptown, where I live and where there has been a relative dearth of proper craft beer bars. The space is airy and welcoming, the bartenders knowledgeable and friendly (unusual for the UWS), and the tap list comprehensive, with enough styles to please all drinkers.

I would comment about the service, but there was none. Even trying to get a check was difficult. It seemed the only thing our ""server"" knew what to say was ""you have to get that yourself at the bar"". Also there was a mistake with our order and the server said he would let the owner know. Usually at a good place the owner or manager would come over and apologize and maybe do something to make up for the mistake. But this place? Nope!

My impression:Good:Nice beer selection, flights available which I enjoy, decor is good and bad. The newly added decor is done well but unfortunately intermixed w leftovers from previous bar.Bad:I didn't have food because too many of the previous business items were not only still in the bar but completely filthy. For ex the bathroom was nicely decorated but the air vents were thickly coated in dust and grime which couldn't have accumulated in a week after opening. The windows on street, ledges etc all appear to have been neglected in cleaning prior to opening, which made me hesitant to order food or return. Overall it's a shame that the owners didn't just hire a prof cleaning company prior to opening. This place sat closed for an extremely long time so to see it not sanitized prior to opening was a disappointment.I was on fence about posting this, hopefully the owners will see and realize that these locals unfort noticed the above misstep and clean up before any other first time customers decide not to return.Bummed, on 72nd St.",4,,

101,David C.,"Austin, TX",0,6,0,3.0,9/19/2016,"Their beer selection is good, but the main reason I went was for a fried chicken sandwich.  Unfortunately, it turned out to cost 50% more than the advertised price on their website.  What was annoying wasn't so much the mistake, but that the waitstaff didn't even offer to give me a dollar or two off.  I drank a beer and left hungry.",,1,
102,Kirstin A.,"Manhattan, NY",0,4,3,5.0,7/6/2016,"I was anxiously waiting for this bar to open as its only two doors down from my apartment and there are precious few good spots to hang and get a good beer in the upper west side. I had pretty high expectations and I was not disappointed! This place is great for some quality craft beers, watching a game or playing a board game upstairs, or meeting friends and get appetizers and drinks.",,,
103,Roger Y.,"Manhattan, NY",0,3,0,5.0,7/31/2016,"This place is new and amazing. Friendly owner, bartenders, etc. great food. Upstairs space is amazing for games and hanging out. Beer list is superb. Been waiting for a place like this close to home for a long time. So glad it's here. Def recommend.",,,
