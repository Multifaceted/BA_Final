1,Bora I.,"East Brunswick, NJ",7,4,12,2.0,4/11/2018,"My wife and I met up with friends here before going out to dinner in the city.  First of all, it is a quite small place that has about 7-8 small booths.  While the size of the property is understandable because it is NYC, the lack of chairs in this establishment had some of us sitting in the booth, while the rest of the party was awkwardly sitting on stools crouching down trying to join the conversation.  That could almost be forgiven since we were only there for about 20 minutes, if the staff knew about their promotions, especially ones that they put on Yelp.  My wife noticed they had Heinekens for 5 dollars if you checked in on Yelp.  I went to the bar to ask about it, and not only did they have no idea what I was talking about despite me showing the promotion on my phone, they didn't even serve Heineken anymore!  As if the bartender was doing me a favor, she said she could give the whole group one free Stella, but couldn't do anything else to help us out.The only reason why we didn't leave is because we had already established that place as a meeting place and didn't want to change last minute, and the birthday boy had picked the place.  Definitely won't be going back there, and I hope no one goes there in the hopes of getting a 5 dollar Heineken, because they'll be sorely disappointed.",2,2,2

How hipster would you have to be to want to pretend-write in a bar??? Anyway, the wonky clientele is part of the charm in this place. It's a closet-sized space that has a few booths where people can nurse their drinks. Selection is limited but prices are reasonable. Decent place.",1,1,
3,Sam S.,"New York, NY",235,30,7,4.0,4/9/2018,"Small (I can only figure the name must have been selected for its irony), cheap (**cash only**) and solid drinks, good volume for conversation but also good music. (I recall ""Vitamin C"" // CAN playing at one point, which became another talking point for me and the new friend who brought me here.)Our trio got to the bar around 11pm on a Friday. All of the seats were taken, but we soon snagged a cozy booth from a group that was leaving and settled down for a few hours. The bartender was super friendly, and the vibe among the other patrons was rather chill. Nice spot to unwind.",,,

I instantly fell in love.When we stopped talking, I used the opportunity to steal Big Bar as my own.It's a very small bar-- about 4 booths. A couple of bar seats and limited standing room. But even while packed it's not claustrophobic. (Despite the fogged windows!)Before I go on, I must add IT IS CASH ONLY! But if you can run to an ATM or have a cash oriented mate, it's totally worth it!The lights are super soothing and I think they play music? I've never noticed, which is great because I love bars you don't have to shout at.The bartenders are cool and have a heavy pour. The drinks are very cheap. I think we paid three dollars for a good sized Jameson shot. We were shocked it was three dollars and shocked it was real Jameson. BB is def one of my regular haunts when I remember to take out cash.

Overall, a really cool find and I'd love to come back.",,,
9,Near M.,"New York, NY",32,122,128,4.0,4/15/2015,"Yay! I've been to this place quite a few times but went on an unintentional hiatus from the place for about 2 and a half years. I finally went some time last week (from the time this is being written/typed) and things are still as cool as ever. Despite its name, its actually not big and its quite small, dimly lit, divey and at the same time intimate. You come here if you want to be able to drink and have conversations with your friends and/or the always friendly bartenders. There's always interesting characters and interesting people to encounter and like an another yelper has mentioned, some of the most intriguing, thought provoking and entertaining conversations I ever had have occurred here. The music is always groovy, ""alternative/not mainstream"" (for lack of a better word)--and not to sound pretentious or like a music snob--but the bartenders here play some good fucking music. Its totally NOT your typical top 40 bullshit you'll hear blasting at a deafening level at many other typical NYC bars. The drinks for happy hour are standard NYC happy hour (4-5 dollars for beer) and after happy hour are pretty much standard NYC prices (I believe). The beer and alcohol selection is good for its size. All-in-All, if you're looking for a bar where you can meet interesting personas, be able to actually hear yourself talk with your friends and/or new friends you may meet and bartender, not have to scream at the bartender for a drink, not have to squeeze your way through a legion of drunk ugly fucks, than this is the spot to go to. If you want your mindless, spineless, soulless, ugly top 40 blaring music type of bar and crowd: go else where. This is where the COOL people play. Big Bar is a small bar with a big personality.BY THE WAY: Shout out to one of the coolest bartenders in town, Brian Richgruber. If you have the honor of meeting him and having him as your bartender, tip him real good. HEY, tip him monetary wise, I mean of course, unless there's a mutual agreement than you can do the other tipping if you know what I mean *wink wink*. ANYWAY, Big Bar is not that type of environment or maybe it is! See for yourself.Yay! I'm a fan.",3,3,2

14,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4932,2412,5152,4.0,7/1/2012,"I'm guessing by now you've learned that Big Bar is anything but palatial as far as space is concerned, but it's big in many other facets that give true meaning to its name:+ It's big in personality. Their staff are all very friendly and project nothing but warm and fuzzies.+ It's been in frigid circulating air. In these summer months, the smal space = less surface area to cool, and that results in a pleasant respite from the fmuggy conditions (F word + muggy).+ It's big approachable locals. I've had a few great conversations with people of all walks of life... never awkward, forced, or creepy (yet).In all, these small virtues are a large part of why this tiny rathskeller has the depth of that canyon in Arizona, despite what the cover of the book may imply.

16,Greg C.,"New York, NY",46,57,16,5.0,11/23/2015,"This place is great. It is very small, but cozy and not claustrophobic. I think it used to be a small restaurant because they have booths, which are fun to sit in while having some drinks with friends. The lighting is all red which creates a really cool atmosphere. There was only one bartender on a busy Friday night, and she was ON POINT. I never waited too long for my beer. They have Blue Point on draft, some wine (which my friend said was meh- but this isn't the type of place to come for wine), and a full bar. The draft beer was cold and carbonated well. The cocktails the bartender was making looked good too. I was here early-ish (around 9pm on a Friday), so I'm not sure if it gets super packed later. But before 10pm it was lively without being annoyingly crowded. I'll definitely be back to this place- had a great time!",1,,2

Just good clean fun...errr....good fun (scratch clean)!Big Bar is pretty small space-wise, but it's big on friendliness and good service. I went here a couple of weeks ago with yelpers and nonyelpers. And we all agreed it was a true gem.The owner was hanging around the bar and we were able to chat him up a bit. Super nice and chatty. I love how New Yorkers can do that. The bartender is excellent. A good bartender is not just eye candy, but someone that knows how to mix a drink. And actually, if a bartender knows how to mix a drink well, I don't care what he or she looks like. I will worship them forever. Our guy just happen to be cute AND able. Now that's a bonus. He was able to mix a good Manhattan (strong) and also made a very decent Margarita. I am now curious if he can make a good dirty Martini...I guess I'll have to come back to find out. The other patrons in the bar were also friendly and giving off good vibes. There is a joke book floating around the bar and I was able to share a few laughs with other bar patrons. I also learned a new dance called the Jumbo made up by a very unique and quirky customer. A great place to hang out and meet interesting characters. Truly memorable for all the right reasons.",8,2,3
19,Jin C.,"New York, NY",37,1048,236,4.0,3/12/2014,"I'm not sure why I was expecting this place to be more divey. Maybe because its name is so generic and uncreative that I wasn't expecting a more romantic and intimate interior. It's actually pretty decent inside. The lighting is dim and red, there are booths, there are stools - it's more of a date/small group sort of bar where you can chit-chat while still being audible to each other.",1,,

It feels like you're drinking in someone's living room! (No, not in a creepy way.)As my friend put it, it's never crowded, but everyone is pretty chill here.

That's basically science right there.Is it small? Of course. In real estate parlance you could even say it's ""cute."" Some say that's a good thing. If you want to bro out this ain't your place.

27,Lucia H.,"Montgomery, AL",43,90,3,3.0,6/14/2013,"Fairly decent dive bar in the area.  My review may be slightly swayed because I went here during one of the (ever so infrequent) super hot days a few weeks back, and they weren't running the AC.  The drinks aren't spectacular, but they're cheap!  It wasn't crowded at all either.I've been to better dive bars, but for that area it's pretty good.  I would definitely go back again but wouldn't make it a regular spot either.Don't let the name fool you, the place is fairly small- especially the bathrooms!",,,
28,Tiffany L.,"Queens, NY",78,396,259,3.0,1/24/2012,"Big? Not quite. It was actually almost the size of my studio apartment...pretty sad, actually now that I think about it. The bathroom was even smaller. I had to sit sideways on the toilet (don't judge me for sitting on public bathroom toilets!) cause my legs wouldn't fit. Also, there was like verrryyyyy low lighting in there. A little bit creepy.I normally feel uncomfortable in places that are tiny, but for some reason, the bar felt very homey...and I felt comfortable as if I were actually in my own studio apartment. Or maybe it was the fact that I was there with a totally chill friend. (here's looking at you, Sean S!)The bartender (Roxy) seemed down to earth as well. Supposedly, she makes the best ""Manhattan's"", which she kept offering to Sean throughout the night. And from what I could gather, he seemed to enjoy her Manhattan's.I only had a rum & coke which was like any other rum & cokes I've ever consumed. I got the vibe that this bar attracts a lot of locals/regulars. Jazz music was playing in the background. They had strange lighting, too...red to be exact.

Maybe it was Opposite Day when the owners decided to name you. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and leave it at that.This place is far from big. No kidding. I walked in here and for a second I felt a bit claustrophobic. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU HATE THE PERSON YOU ARE WITH. Really, don't. The place is so intimate, the music so chill, and the atmosphere so conducive to a quiet night out with someone you enjoy being with that it would probably cause you to kill yourself if you actually had to have a conversation with someone you did not want to be out with. One beer on tap. Blue Point. I like that, so no complaints. The bartender made me a mean margarita with a lot of love, so more of the whole no complaints thing. Solid happy hour specials, plenty of seating (for such a ""big"" place), and a crowd that was far from pretentious.

Updated review","After all these years, this has remained the little big bar that could for me. Kind of like Richie Rich (techland.com/2009/01/04/…) is the poor little rich kid. Um, what? Anyhoo, while I suspect not more than 30 people could comfortably fit in here, I rarely have seen more than 10-15. Perhaps because of its smallness, people not-in-the-know just walk on by, but if you do find yourself drifting in, expect an close-knit vibe with just the right amount of hipster pretense to make you feel like you're in on something special. Forget the speakeasy trend, people; the real deal has been here all along, with bartenders who know how to pour big.",8,3,3

I then question why...Why is it that I'm planting just 2 stars here, while everyone else seems to go 4 and up? My drink of choice. That's why. Let's start from the beginning, yes?My girlfriend's Swiss friends had just arrived in town, and we were all meeting up for dinner. Since I was off work an hour after everyone else, they decided to wait for me at a bar near our restaurant choice. When I arrived, I first noticed the discrepancy, or the irony, of this bar's name. The place is TINY. I can't imagine what it looks like crowded. It being Tuesday, I was naturally jonsing for a beer. While I waited on the bartender to return from the great unknown, I studied the beer menu. I use ""menu"" loosely. I *guess* there were options. I mean, you can order a canned beer (Guinness), bottled beer (Corona, Stella, 3 other similar), and draught beer (their specialty whose name escapes me). Just ONE beer on tap? Really? Fine. I ask for a taste. I suppose it tastes ok. I'll take that. Eh. My girlfriend ended up finishing it for me. It definitely lacked any sort of flavor, though I may just be spoiled by the current wealth of Octoberfest brews out there! It being happy hour, my beer was $5; normally $6. The atmosphere of the place was kind of cool; moody red lighting, cozy booths, etc. The bathroom, however, was smaller than an airplane's lavatory. Look, this place is clearly a cocktail joint. I get this now. So, for those of you looking for that sort of place, by all means give this place a go. If you're like me and looking for a wide selection of delicious beer, keep on going!!",1,1,

That does not mean that it is a particularly good bar in terms of drinks; it is a good option because of its location and atmosphere. The location is great because you are in a very fun neighborhood and can easily transition to a whole bunch of interesting activities. Atmosphere wise, the bar was only half-full on a friday night, which I like because it means you can actually having a conversation. The bar has basic booths, wooden tables, and ugly kind of gross bathrooms. The music level was a little too loud but you can still have a conversation without shouting.  The only interesting thing about it is the red lighting that pervades the place. As far as the drink selections go, they have an atrocious beer selection that is overpriced. They also have a decidedly mediocre selection of liquor.

Everything they are saying about the size and the fabulous red lighting and the good bartenders is right on.  There might be a slight gay tinge here.  I am pretty sure I kissed a girl one night at the Big Bar.  But hey.  That could happen in any number of places. It could be a good place for groups if you got there and took over the entire place.  I also think you can call ahead and arrange such a thing. I think the bottom line with this place is that it is cozy, comfortable, and you can actually have a conversation with your companions without resorting to shouting.  That's kind of an indulgence.",3,1,1

Of course, it's obviously not difficult to find a bar in the East Village to take them that happens to be open and has more than a few like-minded drinkers. But finding a spot at this point in the evening that has an honest-to-goodness chill but fun clientele whose goal isn't to get so obliterated they don't fully remember their middle names, however, might prove to be a tad more difficult.But not if you know about the cozy, warm, lovely, near-perfect  vision of cuteness that is Big Bar (which also happens to conveniently double as possibly the perfect solution for agoraphobes). The cocoon-like atmosphere, constant stream of gentle gin-soaked '50s tunes and the presence of a decidedly non-frat crowd all handily make up for the fact that there's only one beer on tap here (Brooklyn Pilsner).And, bonus -- you're likely to impress out-of-towners just by knowing about this place. (Yes, maybe even more so than taking them to the now-cliche of a ""secret"" speakeasy. Make them do a secret handshake before they enter and you'll pretty much achieve the same effect.)",3,,1

Updated review","My love for Big Bar has only increased since my first visit. They make a mean vodka martini with plump, juicy olives that still have the pits in them. $9, I believe. There have been no more setting-fire-to-sweater incidents and in fact the two other times I've gone there haven't been candles in the bathroom. It's always been the same bartender when I've gone and he is warm and not pushy at all about getting you to order more drinks. Extra points for that. One note: the ADDRESS IS WRONG on Yelp!! It's 7th st, not 75th st!",,,

Next, he pointed to the picture on the wall and said, ""that's me and i'm the owner"". I really can't stand posturers so I had to reveal how cranky and inhospitable the owner was. We would have departed early if our friends weren't enjoying their drinks so much.
