0,Anna A.,"San Diego, CA",0,9,6,4.0,11/17/2018,"We came to this place off a recommendation from a local. We really wanted good Chicago style pizza, but their thin crust pizza ended up taking the cake! Definitely recommend the thin crust pizza. The place was a lot smaller than we expected, and we had to wait in a cramped corner for about 15 mins which wasn't a big deal especially because they let us put our order in while we were still waiting.Only reason why I wouldn't give 5 stars is because the waitress Fawn was a complete killjoy. She was very unenthused and we're not sure if it was just our table she wasn't fond of because she was laughing and smiling with other tables yet that smile and laugh would disappear when it came to us. We hadn't said anything rude or argued so we weren't really sure what her deal was. The bartender was really nice however so it seems other staff were great.",,,
1,Michelle H.,"Brooklyn, NY",141,87,25,2.0,9/9/2018,"This place was highly recommended online, but I don't think it lived up to its hype. It's NY so everything is small, but this takes the cake. They put together as many tables as possible to cram everyone in. We had to pull out tables to let others in to fit. Even this super skinny woman had to ask for some space to get through.While sitting on top of each other, we had the watermelon salad and a plate of fries. Pretty good on that front. The pizza was okay. I was expecting more flavor, but I just didn't get that experience. The medium was still a really decent size for 2-3 people.Maybe my pizza taste buds were spoiled by ordering the apple wine. We asked the waitress if it was sour because we didn't want a sour tasting drink. She said it's definitely not sour or bitter. When we got our drinks, it was surprisingly amazingly sour. The bottle was on our table so we looked at it and it says 'sour and bitter taste' in the description....I'll have to continue my search for a good deep dish in NY.",5,2,2
2,KosTello D.,"New York, NY",17,13,44,5.0,8/30/2018,"When you live in New York City but crave Chicago... go to Emmett's in Soho.Kos & Tello have yet to experience Chi-town together, but we hope to, and tonight, we played pretend.  Tello first eyed this tiny bar and restaurant tucked just below Houston on MacDougal about two months ago, but it sat, regretfully, on the to do list knowing the calorie content that can come with Chicago's famous fare.  But today, a morning of house work in 90 degree heat provided us the sweat equity we felt entitled to in order to experience this gem sans guilt.  Kos tried a Chicago based IPA from Revolution.  Great, not too hoppy, definitely potent, and having fasted for this meal, a little tipsy forward.  Tello went for the Champagne of Beers which was an icebreaker with our bartender, who admitted to her own love of the High Life, and we were insta-friends. Tello ordered a Chicago style dog (Just the Dog to save the calories and the cost of the side of fries, chips or salad).  Delicious, yellow mustard, green as Xmas relish, onions, hot peppery-goodness, tomato slices.  It was missing the traditional celery salt and the pickle. However, for Tello, it was the perfect layover for the 30minute downtime whilst they oven bake our Medium Deep Dish, with choice of jalapeños, fresh garlic, and red onion.Ah... the pizza.  Instinctively we both added a little crushed red pepper and fork and knifed into the giant masterpiece of sauce and cheese and carb overload.  Sauce was pepper forward but also sweet, cheese... cheese, crust was actually lighter than expected for a deep dish.  New York, Chicago, Sicilian or Napolitano, this is just straight up good pizza.  We realized after our second piece we neither spoke to each other for 15minutes nor did we reach for that crushed red pepper.  It had all the flavors it needed.  We agreed we didn't need toppings, no matter how tempting those add ones can be, this doesn't need it, especially for your first visit.  Go purist.  We debated with our bellies over those last two pieces.  Was it worth the stretched stomach?  Ultimately, our desire to drink a few more High Life's and possible play a few rounds of MegaTouch, won over the tempting calorie pie monster and we carried the rest home.  Breakfast!?  Perhaps with an egg on it, while googling flights to Chicago.",2,1,1
3,Sidney Z.,"Encino, CA",96,421,4,4.0,8/23/2018,"The only square cut pizza I've ever had before Emmett's (tonight) was at Barone's Restraurant Sherman Oaks, CA. By square cut, I mean literally the usual wedge cut triangle comes I the shape of a square cube.So far I'm 2 for 2 with this novel cut as both times not only were both delicious but easy to handle and extended the time to consume your pie.Emmett's is the lovely little restaurant in Soho that's not only affordable (a big deal in NYC) but also comfortable and very good.Our Caesar Salad was this large basic (not frou frou) bowl dressed just right with crouton crunch and parma/anchovy flavors. Our Nadine pizza was chalk full of basel, tomatoes and different cheeses.The Belgium Pilsner we choose were these light crisp quenching brews that really enhanced our meal.I have a real Love Story with New York City and the whole pizza thing. Emmett's kept that story alive and well last night.",2,,2
4,Matthew R.,"Manhattan, NY",143,726,51,4.0,7/30/2018,"Emmett's doesn't disappoint with their deep dish, and would be right at home in Chicago. While I wouldn't consider it top tier in Chicago it's far better than the lower end chains like Giordanos. We had a half spinach pie and it was delicious. Crust was cooked well, had a great texture, and tasted great. That being said their Italian beef wasn't up to par which is the reason for the 4 stars. I like my Italian beef soggy and while it was dipped, the bread was too dense to allow the gravy to fully penetrate. There were sections of the sandwich that were just dense and dry.   The fries were bomb though and while I didn't try the hot dog my 2 Chicago native friends both thought it was great. I'll skip the beef next time but the pizza is a winner.",3,1,2

But it's fine, because if I'm eating deep dish, I'm out here to eat a casserole Took my friends here last week and grabbed a tiny table. There's no happy hour. Thumbs down but whatever, we're here to eat. We get the supreme which is meat, peppers, sauce, good shit. You can half and half a pizza which is good and cool.Takes about half an hour to get our food. Which is fine.Our waitress cuts it up and serves the pizza, weird and infantile, but ok sure.We take a bite. And it's flavourless. Even the sauce is flavourless. I'm genuinely confused, thinking maybe I've just lost my tastebuds. Nope this casserole seems to have no seasoning at all. Total bummer consider I do like Chicago style. This is a poor fake of the real good stuff. Shame.",2,2,

The family size comes with 8 thick slices.  If you're moderately hungry you can get away with 1 or 1.5 slice.  One thing to note, it takes about 30-35 mins to prepare so don't come here if you're in a rush.  The place is tiny and intimate with just a handful of tables plus a bar.  The service is friendly, but due to the long wait for the pizza, an update at some point would have been helpful on when it is arriving.  (Especially if you're starving and impatient.)Overall, great option for deep dish.",4,3,3

I have never had pizza before so I have nothing to compare it to but I will say, it did not disappoint! I loved the overload of hearty marinara sauce with a crispy crust.

I've never had deep dish pizza before, however after trying this place, any other Chicago style pizza I try will have to live up to this!I cam here on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving with my boyfriend.  He found the place by recommendation from a co-worker, and I'm sure glad he did!  It wasn't too crowded when we got there so we got a seat at a table.  The inside is quaint but it gives it a cozy feel which is part of the charm.  We ordered garlic cheese bread and the traditional pizza.  Figured we'd go traditional for the first time and not get any toppings so we could really judge the pizza itself.The garlic bread was on thin bread, which looked like the same way they cook their thin crust pizza (which I have to go back and try btw because it looked awesome).  We devoured the entire order and luckily within seconds of finishing out pizza came out.  Our waitress was so friendly and served us both our first slices.  Watching the cheese and sauce drip as she served the pizza had me salivating, I could not wait to try it!After the first bite, I was hooked. It was amazing!!! Of course, this is not your typical NY slice of pizza, but it's still absolutely delicious.  The only reason I was disappointed was because after my second slice (there were 6 in the pie) I knew I wouldn't be able to have a third, and I really wanted to because I could not get enough!! Luckily, I packed up our two left over slices to go and ate them as leftovers later in the week, still just as good!The place started to fill up as we were leaving, but my recommendation would be don't be turned off by the wait! It's absolutely worth every second!!",1,,

We ordered the Mozzarella Sticks for appetizers, our waitress let us know we may want to start with something small because the pizzas do take 30-35 minutes to cook. So glad we did the Mozzarella sticks were perfect and the side marinara sauce was delish.My husband and I ordered the Magnum P eye..   pineapple and ham deep dish. It was absolutely amazing! So extra cheesy and perfectly baked, I could only finish one slice it was so filling, Don't be fooled by its size this pizza fills you up!

20,Michelle K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",30,14,3,1.0,12/7/2017,"It pains me to write yet another bad pizza review, but here I am, in the Mecca of all gooey pizza goodness, wishing I had just stuck to Papa Johns which is at least consistent in its mediocrity. Ordered from Emmett's via UberEATS following a late-ish in the night food craving, ordering fairly basic essentials: mozzarella sticks and a pepperoni thin crust pizza. I knew things were not going to go well when I bit into the thick, barely fried, semi-stale tasting mozzarella stick, cooked as though inspired by lightly fried fish filets, and it seems my powers of premonition hadn't left me yet. The thin crust was certainly not NY-style, which I can appreciate, but it was completely lacking in sauce (see sauciest ""slice"" in the photo below), cheese (despite the order of extra cheese), warmth, or the ooey-gooeyness that makes pizza so pleasurable. Whether off their game or worse at delivery than dining-in, Emmett's has firmly landed on my list of ""never order from here again, no matter how desperate or trusting you might be in the moment.""",1,2,
21,Mini K.,"New York, NY",190,128,307,3.0,12/19/2017,"I went out with work people for a lunch. We had family size deep dish pizza, some thin pizza and salad. I think the food was good, but not exceptional. The deep dish pizza's crust was bit hard and not as good as some deep dish pizza I had in Chicago. The thin crust pizza felt a little bit like frozen pizza. I also ordered arugula salad and there was more apple than arugula and sauce was bit strong. I understand that the pizza is cooked fresh but we waited around 30-40 minutes for the pizza as well (they did warn us). Overall the place wasn't bad, but I definitely had better pizza in the past.",1,,

And no UNOs does not fulfill that craving. UNOs just leaves me broken and disappointed afterwards.Emmett's though, Emmett's does the job. I was so happy to finally find a GOOD Chicago deep style pizza place in NYC.It's a tiny place that can't seat a whole lot. And preparing the pizza takes a long time (as it does with any Chicago pizza place). So you can order before you get seated.And just to be clear. I don't choose Chicago-style over NY-style or vice verse. They're completely different foods. So I choose both.",2,,1
24,Sharon H.,"Los Angeles, CA",259,178,735,5.0,3/11/2017,"WAY BETTER THAN THE HYPED LOMBARDI'S PIZZA!!! Don't get me wrong, Lombardi's was amazing, but this was off the charts!! My boyfriend and I were really craving some deep dish pizza and hands down, we did not regret this one bit! The location was a bit hard to find because their sign wasn't obvious and it's a bit of a hidden gem. The seating is quite limited with a max capacity of about 20-30 people, I would guesstimate. On a cold and windy day, heavy coats are a must, but these coats can be hung on a rack outside of the seating area in order to conserve seating space. We came in around 2-3 PM, and this place was still serving plenty of pizzas! DISCLAIMER - Just a heads up in case you've been starving yourself to come here; to prepare a fresh deep dish pizza, the wait time ranges from 20-40 minutes. Trust me when I say, the wait will be worth it! My boyfriend and I shared a medium (10"" sized) Gabe Froman pizza. The portion was HUGEE and loaded with cheese, spinach, pepperoni, sausage, tomatoes, and sauce!! They really do not skimp on any of their ingredients. Each bite was packed with flavor and stringy goodness - incomparable to Lombardi's pizza. I never imagined myself in LOVE with deep dish pizza more than my love for thin crust pizza. I always thought of myself as a thin-crust-pizza-kind-of-girl, but this has changed my perspective entirely. The crust was not dry at all, like I thought it would be. It was thick and bread-like which complimented the sauciness perfectly! Not only was this pizza the bomb, but it was extremely filling!! We took 1/3 of this pizza home as leftovers!! When we were at Lombardi's we were definitely full, but didn't have any leftovers. Honestly, the best pizza I've had during my trip to New York! So GLAD we ventured away from our New York food itinerary list (believe me, it was long) and popped into this joint.",10,9,9

Now that I'm a resident, I try to go once a month. The atmosphere is cozy and the workers are really chill.But the deep dish is where it's at. You can taste the love in the crust, cheese, sauce, and toppings. And I don't feel judged whenever I ask for pineapples. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but it's worth it.",2,,
26,Chris F.,"New York, NY",67,107,138,5.0,3/19/2018,"Okay so this was one of the oddest restaurant ordering situation I've ever had but it makes sense. Here's the deal, when it's crowded (which seems to be most of the time since there are like 8 tiny tables) you order while your standing outside. Like the server comes out and asks you want you want to order and your on the sidewalk. It takes about 40 minutes for the deep dish pizza to be made, so it helps with flow of tables and your overall wait time. You're going to wait for a table anyway so they get your order in ASAP. Weird, right? But totally efficient and that was appreciated. The girls working that night had a super smooth operation going, kept up with everyone's orders and who came first etc. it was impressive and so was the food. We ordered the largest deep dish (it was enough for 3 guys) and the pizza was great. It made me think ""this is what people mean when it's a pizza pie!"" The crust is more of a thick pie crust, then a layer of gooey cheese and then red sauce. It was very tasty, not too sweet and lots of flavor. We also had mozzarella sticks which were big fatties and i made the mistake of diving in too early and having volcanic melted mozzarella but it hurt SO GOOD! Service was good but 3 guys at a tiny round table was awkward... wouldn't stop me from coming back tho",2,1,

28,Jennie C.,"New York, NY",53,354,492,4.0,10/9/2017,"By far the best Chicago style pizza in NYC. Chicago thin crust is very different from a New York slice so don't expect anything close to it. As one reviewer wrote in a one star review this ""cheese and cracker"" pizza is pretty much exactly what you'd get in Chicago. May not be your cup of tea but the sauce is perfect and when eaten fresh the gooey melted cheese is just the right amount for the cracker thin crust. Service is amazing here, friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Pizza is definitely fresh and that's clearly visible from the dining area as there is a large window where the food comes out to the bar area and a clear view of the dude making the pizzas. So why 4 stars? Hot muggy day and the windows/doors were open and A/C was not blasting. I'm a sweat-er and pizzas hot and I add red pepper flakes so.... lotsa sweating involved.",1,,

If I wanted to eat cheese & crackers I'd have copped a box of Ritz and some Cracker Barrel cheese and called it a night! How you gonna play a New Yorker with some cracker thin crust like you didn't even try to keep it 100% ... Then ya had the nerve to reheat an already made pie they probably frisbeed into the oven to get those good ole black bubbles in the cheese poppin with authentic char on the bottom just to let me know it actually touched that brick surface ... please!If you treat your take out customer's that way, I'm wondering if those deep dish pics circulating on the Gram have been photo shopped for extra thickness ...

Probably a couple pounds of cheese though, that was nice. On a busy night, a single server was flinging undercooked pizzas to unsatisfied throngs who ordered appetizers that never came, asked for wines that were on the menu but not available, and forced down pies topped with lunchtime salads instead of properly assembled and carefully stewarded deep dish deliciousness.

Updated review","Visit #4 little late for 2017 Decor is still the same, guess if it ain't broke don't fix it. Menu has expanded to include some movie ""specials"". Ate the Gabe Froman sausage king pie. Thin crust is a Barnaby's look alike ( didn't try it this time and the waitress (( not from Chicago )) had no clue if my comparison is accurate ) Crust and sauce are spot on.  Personally was hoping for more Chicago style Sausage ( ? Lou's full patty style) Overall still a yearly repeater.",,,
33,Kimberly H.,"Brooklyn, NY",85,189,164,4.0,8/1/2017,"Only good place for Chicago deep dish pizza  in the good old city of NYC. So I read about this place online and just so happened to be in the village .. and kinda just walked by this place. I almost didn't walk in because It was empty on a weekend around 5ish.. let's just say I am glad I went in. After being lured in, a nice guy sat us down. Gave us this menu with plenty of pizza options. We ordered the delicious root beer and a medium deep dish pizza with sausage and pepperoni. The deep dish takes about 30 mins to make. They tell you in advance.  Which is fine.. because I like to drink and they do have a bar lol... so like 10 mins later our pizza comes out... except is isn't our pizza... it's a regular flat pizza... so I'm like.. hey this isn't a deep dish.. the guy goes.. well u didn't order a deep dish..and I'm like yes I did and you told me it takes like 30 mins to make.... on top of that the pizza has peppers.. I'm allergic to bell peppers... that's how I know I didn't order that pizza ! Finally another man (I think he was the owner) comes out and apologizes, takes the pizza and tells me he will make me a new one but it will take about 20 minutes .. in the mean time your second round of root beer is on the house.. I'm like cool thanks .. sooo 20 something minutes later our pizza comes out.. its deep dish and it's beautiful... gooey cheese lots of Pep and fresh sausage! I'm in love.. up until I bite into an overly chewy very pink piece of sausage .....  by then I was like don't want to complain again, so  I took the sausage out and continued to eat my pizza..which was delicious ..Bill comes.. they charged us for the free root beer I tell the waiter it's supposed to be free.. he goes no its not.. by then I was just annoyed, so paid my bill and despite that horrible waiter left him a decent tip and went on my way... Just some notes the medium is huge for 2 people  you will be taking the leftovers to go.The root beer is delicious This pizza is instagram worthy The restaurant is really small.. and does get really busy after 6PM.Great spot to bring a small group of 4 or less also great for dates.. The Owner is really nice. The Prices are very reasonable. They use real mozz and fresh ingredients .. you can literally taste how fresh it is.",1,1,1

36,Mike F.,"Rockaway Park, Queens, NY",3,60,181,4.0,7/2/2017,"Yes, the age old debate, Chicago style or NY style. Apples and oranges, really. It's like trying to compare a Sicilian slice to a regular, or crack cocaine to just regular cocaine; it just can't be done. No matter your preference, Emmett's will satisfy. All the ingredients were on point, and the pizza was cooked perfectly. I went with what I was told is a rather new creation for Emmett's, the deep dish with a caramelized cheese crust. Which, is a take right out of Detroit's pizza playbook. Don't worry, the deep dish crust is still there, but it comes surrounded by a layer of crispy cheese. Obviously if you're given the choice between a regular version, and a version covered in caramelized cheese, go with the latter. The 10 inch deep dish is recommended for 2-3 normal people, but 2 people with a halfway decent appetite could easily handle the 12 inch. One warning, the place is very small, there's maybe 8 seats at the bar, and about 15 table seats. With pies legitimately taking 30 minutes from order to table, watch what time you go, because peak hours will be tough. There's a nice table by the window that looks out onto the street, unfortunately, due to my friend's bloated girth, we were unable to dine at said table.",1,2,2
37,Aqueelah M.,"Brooklyn, NY",159,11,5,4.0,1/17/2018,"First, let's get this out of the way: I was born and raised in Chicago, home of the deep dish pizza. In February 2015, I moved to NYC, which, of course, is also known for its pizza. A friend/co-worker of mine brought this place to my attention after I talked about how much I missed the tomato-y, cheesy, succulent, probably-should-be-regulated-by-the-DEA goodness of Giordano's pizza. So, we scheduled a day to go, and we went. Now, prior to this excursion, I was really reticent to try any pizza other than that which I would find back home. In fact, up to that day, I only had one slice of pizza since moving to NYC, and it came from a little hole in the wall pizzeria two blocks from work: a thick-crusted Sicilian-style cheese pizza, which wasn't half-bad (but it wasn't mind-blowing either).Anyway, on to the good shit.Whenever I got deep dish back home, I always got veggies: tomatoes, onions, green peppers, and spinach. Tomatoes were not a listed ingredient at Emmett's, but the waiter (whose accent kind of reminded me of Chef Louis from The Little Mermaid who was chasing Sebastian around the kitchen while singing ""Les Poissons"") accommodated this slight deviation, which of course resulted in cool points. When I took the first bite of the immaculate starch, dairy, and vegetable pie placed in front of my friend and me, the following quote from A Clockwork Orange blasted through to my prefrontal cortex:""Oh bliss! Bliss and heaven! Oh, it was gorgeousness and gorgeousity made flesh. It was like a bird of rarest-spun heaven metal or like silvery wine flowing in a spaceship, gravity all nonsense now. As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures!""My friend does not know this, but I had a mini-foodgasm at that moment. The other thing I loved was the vast array of Goose Island beers available. I didn't have one, though; instead, I had a cider ale.Emmett's is supremely close to the deliciosity that is Chicago-style deep dish pizza. I suppose that's because Emmett himself is a native Chicagoan like me. I highly recommend other Chicago transplants who love their deep dish take a gander. My only complaint is how tiny the place is. Luckily, it wasn't too crowded when I went, but I could only imagine the sudden onset of claustrophobia that I would feel if I had come on a busy night.But yeah...GO GET SOME. NOW!",1,1,
38,Katy W.,"Manhattan, NY",0,19,0,5.0,10/10/2018,"Went there today for lunch with colleagues from work. I had the fortune of trying the classic deep dish, the hot papi, and a hot dog. It was my first time trying deep dish, and I loved it. Crispy, doughy crust, blended with a delicious mix of sauce, veggies, cheese, and meat, the pizza made me happy. The hot dog had the perfect snap, and I was delightfully surprised about how much I enjoyed the hot papi!",,,
39,Anita K.,"New York, NY",184,69,88,4.0,8/6/2017,"I had high expectations for this deep dish pizza since I've tried the original in Chicago (like Giordano's). I got the Cheese Louise deep dish with fries. The pizza took 30 minutes, which was honestly too long. We were starving and did not expect to wait that long. When the food finally arrived, I gotta say it was worth the wait, especially if you've never had deep dish before. I had  2 slices and had to call it quits after. I was stuffed!! The pizza is sooooo cheesy and the crust is so thick!!Did it compare with Chicago's? I would have to say I enjoyed Chi-town more but Emmetts did come in a close second. I would definitely recommend! A solid 4/5. (Also side note: happy hour ended at 6; kinda disappointing)",,,
40,Ashley B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",18,31,19,5.0,1/28/2018,"This place is delicious let me start off by saying that!!! I went on a Sunday late afternoon with some friends. Thank god the time we arrived was a great time because this place is small. It has about 8-10 tables and a bit of a tight squeeze. We were greeted by the bartender/waitress cause she did just about everything. This place is super friendly and has great service. The food:We ordered a order of mozzarella sticks, they were fresh and homemade. I knew it was gonna take about 35 mins for the pizza to cook, it felt like forever lol. I got the original that comes with sausage, peppers and onions. We did not have to wait the 3 minutes to dig in. I guess they let it sit before arriving to the table. The pizza was slices of heaven! I didn't eat all day and I will say 2 slices will fill you all the way up!! I would recommend this place 100%They have thin style pizza also, next time I'll try both, but really you come here for Chicago style deep dish pizza (aka pie).",,,1
41,Bree C.,"Manhattan, NY",374,88,90,4.0,1/22/2018,"I highly recommend visiting this place if you want to venture out and try something other than NY-style pizza as Emmett's serves up delicious Chicago-style deep dish. There are a variety of options and toppings and each has a little something for everyone. My friends and I ordered the meat lover's pie and it was absolutely perfect. Very filling and the crust wasn't too soggy or hard. The pizzas are made to order, so be prepared to wait a half hour before it comes out. Also, the place itself can fit roughly fifteen people at a few small tables and roughly six more along the bar. The staff tries to accommodate everyone as quickly as they can, but they struggle with letting people know accurate wait-times and also keeping an eye on which party came first. My friends and I were waiting first, but the hostess acknowledged two other groups before taking down our name. There has got to be a better system when you consider how small the venue is. The fantastic pizza and a decent selection of craft beers make up for the horrible wait.",,,1
42,Kevin A.,"New York, NY",4,87,149,4.0,8/19/2017,"The one and only deep dish pizza restaurant in NYC! I would visit Chicago again for pizza and this place offers just what I am looking for. The cheese is stringy and fresh, and the texture of dough is just right. There are many different toppings that you can choose from. They also have an awesome beer selection. The wait time could be a bit long. Remember, this is deep dish, so it takes longer time to bake than New York style pizza. In terms of capacity, you might have to wait for a while to be seated. This place is small and it can be crowded and loud depending on when you visit. I guarantee it's worth waiting though.",,,
43,Natalie L.,"Queens, NY",86,16,40,5.0,9/15/2017,"At first it started as kind of a joke when my now husband suggested we get Emmett's pizza for our wedding but after looking into other lame wedding food, it just seemed like the obvious choice. Their small shop had never catered a wedding before but they definitely DELIVERED on our day :)They were on time & the pizza was great. I even handed off gluten free dough to them to cook & prepare / cook with their ingredients and it was just as delicious. They delivered in 2 shifts because their kitchen is only so big but the whole thing was seamless and professional.Our coordinators / waitstaff fell short -- not labeling the pizzas for guests but Kandice from Emmetts stuck around to announce ingredients to guests as they went through the buffet line -- even though we only hired them for drop off service.Go to their shop in the village if you want something different than the traditional pizza you find in NYC. It's not crispy or floppy and you have to eat it w/ a fork but if you're into that, it's well worth the wait (thick, saucy, Chicago style pizza takes longer to cook y'all).",,,
44,Alina M.,"Paramus, NJ",504,351,866,5.0,8/22/2016,"I first came to this place as part of an NYC pizza tour and a few months later came again with friends. This place is known for it's deep dish pizza (or so the tour guide said) and so we ordered a deep dish pie. Somehow, despite the large amounts of cheese and dough, it wasn't overly filling and doesn't put you into a food coma. Everything about it is absolutely delicious, from the sauce to the cheese to the perfect crust. If you're a true pizza enthusiast, you MUST try this place at some point in your life.This place is very small and has a homey feel to it, the employees are friendly and make you feel welcome. There are only about 4 tables so if you're coming with a large group, I would consider calling in advance because this place just isn't built to accommodate large groups. But that's part of it's charm, in my opinion. Will definitely be back for more next time I'm in the area.",6,,2
45,Olivia R.,"New York, NY",314,137,170,3.0,9/10/2016,"Surprisingly good service, surprisingly not the best pizza.We went on a Saturday around 6:30pm. As literally everyone said, Emmetts is small so I could see there easily being a wait - fortunately there wasn't. Full disclosure: I've never had deep dish before. Emmetts was my first.We ordered fries and a ceaser to start. I didn't have high hopes for the ceaser but we still wanted some greens. We got what we expected. The fries were on the thinner side, well seasoned, and perfectly crisp. Some of the best I've had!Now, for the za. Honestly it was almost all cheese and no sauce. We got it topped with mushrooms onions and pepperoni but honestly it just wasn't there for me. The crust felt flavorless and didn't add anything to the pizza. The mozzerella was overpowering, and I'm someone who friggen loves cheese. Genius move: asked for a side of marinara sauce to put on the pizza/dip it in. Even then, something was still lacking. I felt like I was eating flavorless cheesy bread. I'm sorry but I did.Our waiter was super attentive and great. Maybe this is how deep dish normally is, IDK, but I don't think I'm a fan.",3,,1

It's a small space which is why I preferred sitting at the bar rather than grabbing a table.  We ordered (I do not remember the name on the menu) but a deep dish pizza that had pepperoni and sausage.  Now, I wanted the thin crust but my SO insisted we should try the deep dish.  Because if you're coming here they are known for the Chicago style deep dish pizza.Was it good? I have a love/hate relationship with Deep dish.  It leans towards hate, but if there is one thing I can say about their deep dish: it tastes better than some of the crappier options in Chicago, but it does not taste as good as some of the better deep dish places in Chi-town.The CHEESE on this pizza is wonderful.  The whole experience is elevated because of the great service, small space which lets you get friendly with rando strangers, the deep dish pizza timer, all the cheesy goodness you witness (sighs amazing sight). I would come back (I wouldn't go out of my way to get back here, but I do think this is worth a shot if you've never tried it).  Next time maybe I'll stop by for a thin crust...",3,1,1

The sausage on the pie was probably the best part. But the pizza itself, no wow factor. I wasn't hugely loving the sauce either. Too salty for me.

Too long!We arrived to dine in but upon hearing it was 45 minutes to 1.5 hours for a table, we opted to order the food to go. We still waited about 30 minutes for the pie to come out, but it went by quickly.We ordered the Classic + Pepperoni, and also got an order of mozz sticks. When we finally got the pizza box, it was HEAVY! We walked to a bench and just ate out on the sidewalk. (Hey, I don't need to have a fancy sit down meal every time! :D)The pizza was hot but glorious. I love deep dish, I love toppings and I loved how packed this pizza was. This was only my fourth deep dish pizza I've eaten ever, and I have to say, I would go back! It was just STACKED with flavor and so filling. I could have cried from happiness.The mozzarella stocks ended up being a cold after thought.We had left overs of course, and the leftovers were somehow even better than the pizza being fresh.

A friend and I shared a mushroom and sausage pie and we didn't leave a single crumb behind. This is a small restaurant. So, so small. This is a place for a date or to catch up with one friend, not a place to hang with your bowling league. We ate at the bar rather than try and vie for one of the few tables.

I think the only thing in the menu I don't like is the salad because it takes up room for the deep dish!    Which I will suggest extra cheese, sausage and pepperoni.   On your second visit try the thin crust you won't be disappointed.   The place is smaller so expect to wait for a table or bar stool during the peak hours.     Also it's great to know the owner is willing to jump in the kitchen and make the pizza.",1,,

The cheese is good quality and there is a good amount of it on there to accomplish the signature cheesy pull whenever removing a slice from the pie. The sauce was okay, but could have had a more robust flavor. Toppings needed to be cut smaller. Portions are HUGE and filling.Arugula salad was flavorless -- needs some element of sweetness or a more flavorful cheese on it. Also needs to be seasoned with salt and pepper.Service was super friendly, but it took a long time for the pie to come out.

65,Rob K.,"New York, NY",0,23,1,3.0,5/20/2018,"I'm by no means a Chicago pizza expert...I've only had Lou Malnati's and Pequod's (my favorite of the two). I ordered Emmet's Cheese Louise pie, with sausage and pepperoni, which I felt would be an approximate combination of what Pequod's does in terms of the caramelized cheese crust, and Lou Malnati's signature toppings. The Louise was good. Very tasty, with a nice balance of cheese and meat. Maybe a bit heavy on the sauce. The crust was decent if not a little tough and a tad thick at the base where the outer crust meets the base crust. A very serviceable pie, but not quite on Pequod's level.  I had to stop myself from finishing a Pequod's pie by myself, but I was good after 3 slices of Emmet's. While the pie was good, the restaurant itself and the service left something to be desired. The dining room is really cramped. Throughout the meal I was subjected to overpowering nasty cologne and perfume from our left and right neighbors. I was literally elbow to elbow with the dude on my right, and we were not at a communal table.  Side note to diners everywhere...can you PLEASE NOT dump a bottle of perfume/cologne on yourself before going out to dinner in a tiny crowded restaurant?  Not everyone is going to think you smell amazing. The place is also kinda shabby, and not really in a chic way.  It looks thrown together on a very low budget, possibly even dumpster sourced. Service was just plain meh. We were greeted by one of the most dour and joyless hostess/waitresses I've ever experienced. Stone faced and curt is no way make someone feel welcome. I had to coax my wife to Emmet's. She's not the pizza monster I am. So I plied her with the promise of Italian beef.  Sadly, we were told they had sold out of Italian beef, despite us arriving for an early dinner. If you only have a few menu choices, doesn't it make sense to make sure you have plenty of everything on the menu, especially on a Saturday night?  My wife was relegated to the arugula salad with chicken, which totally defeated the purpose of making the trip to the West Village for some Chicago specialties. We could have gotten that salad in 50 other places much closer to home. And the salad was just ok. When the pie came out, I asked for a Coke. ""No problem!"" I was told by a different and much cheerier server.  So happy people do work here!  The only problem? She never brought it. The next time I saw her, she was sitting at the bar looking at her phone. We ordered a bottle of Perrier for the table and it was poured over ice at the table.  I can't even remember the last time I was served sparkling water on ice, without even asking if I wanted ice.  Conversely, the Coke I finally scored was brought to me in a bottle with no glass at all.  It should have been the other way around guys. During the meal, no one checked in on us. Anything we wanted we had to wave someone down to get. All in all, a decent pizza that wasn't quite good enough to make us overlook the subpar experience.  I might consider takeout, but we won't be back to Emmet's.",,,

Yes it's an intimate west village restaurant/pub type. I've read some of the shitty reviews from shitty people who don't understand nyc dining. Bar seems to be first come first serve, unless you're eyeing on a spot and let other people know it'll be yours. You can't mess with a hungry New Yorker about calling dibs on bar seating unless you're a chump. Yes, it's true, there's one server and a bartender, they are diligent fast working and super pleasant. I appreciate their beverage list and quality beer options on tap. The music was tasteful nostalgia. Upon ordering the deep dish pizza (that I came there for) bartender did inform me that it would take about 40mins. No problem. Fresh pie for me? Hell yea. I got chips to snack on, thinking they'd be some generic lays type. Nope. They were housemade, and served warm crunchy and effin delicious. Finally, my pizza arrived accompanied with a tiny hourglass timer because the pizza needs time to cool before they cut and serve it....It was everything I hoped for, generous amount of cheese, tasty perfectly cooked crust, and the sauce! The sauce! It was sooo so tasty. I wish I wasn't full off of beer and chips, I would've killed half the pie. I'd most definitely return again and again and bring a friend or two.",1,,
67,Phylicia M.,"Riverdale, Bronx, NY",8,61,53,5.0,7/27/2018,"This is definitely one of my favorite pizza places because I loveeee thin, crusty pizzas! This review is not about deep-dish-- I don't eat that lol. Anywho, Emmett's pizzas are full of flavor from the crust on up. Multi-dimensional flavor makes it extremely enjoyable. Now I know that was a heavy sentence, but I meant it: crust, sauce, toppings all thoughtfully made! With the option to create your own, you can build a delicious pizza full of your favorite flavors-- this isn't always the case at other pizza places. My favorite pizza on their menu is the Hot Papi: pepperonis, slivered red onion, jalapeño, and a paprika ranch that is a welcomed fresh group of flavors!! And I'm the girl who HATES ranch otherwise. Get a side of fries with your pizza because they happen to get this right, too!! Their thin fries are also my favs for being perfectly crusty on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

69,Mia M.,"Brooklyn, NY",53,58,62,2.0,3/23/2018,"Chicago girl here! Does this remind me of home? Nah. Did they try really hard to come close to Chicago style pizza? I believe they did try. I can't get with the crust, it's just not as toasty as our Chicago deep dish pizza and too gummy for my taste. Almost reminds me of the gooey crust you get from heating up frozen pizza in the oven no matter how long you keep it in the oven, it's just too doughy. The beer selection was great though-- they had some nice bottled stouts. The only way I'd come back here is if I'm way too tipsy to taste or enjoy food and make sure I don't have the expectation of a Chicago style pizza and accept it for what it is, almost deep dish pizza from no particular region. Ingredients were fresh. We asked for Italian beef, they said they ran out. I wonder if that could have helped make it better? Nah, maybe not. It's okay. I respect the effort. Just alright. Also, if you want to sit at the tables, prepare to be tightly and intimately close with your neighbors. You have to pull out the tables to sit down and it's quiet enough to hear about your table neighbors s- e- x  life. Just sayin'. Service wasn't that great, they don't check on you much even though it's so small and they can only fit like 3 customers in the restaurant. We had to keep calling for help.",,,
70,Shawn H.,"New York, NY",59,467,2648,4.0,4/20/2016,"I really enjoyed the deep dish here -- I don't know if it's quite at the same level as some of the top places in Chicago, but it's easily as close as I've experienced in New York. We got one with soppressata and one with spinach and mushrooms. Both were great, but I surprisingly liked the veggie one more. We didn't get any sides, which I regret to some extent, since they look awesome on here, but that (and the thin crust) will be something to look forward to next time. Two medium pizzas were more than enough for four people -- we were all stuffed, and we still had leftovers.I would definitely recommend going at off-hours -- it is a very small place, and while we were able to sit right away at the bar, that was only because we got there pretty early. (Also, the bar was pretty cramped -- I would definitely prefer a table next time.) Regardless, I am excited to have this as a default deep dish option in NYC.",1,,

First time we went was not too long after they opened and the owner was a one-man show, pouring drinks and taking our orders. As of last week (3/22/17), there were two servers and a separate bartender. Must be doing pretty good for a place that seats about two dozen patrons total. And now I know why! I think the pizza was even better the second time around. It was my hubby's birthday and he tells me before we go how this is his favorite pizza place in the city. (News to me :) This says a lot coming from two people who seek out pizza everywhere we go and whose weekly diets consist of several nights of cheesy bread and red sauce with a variety of toppings.The large took a little longer than the stated 30 minutes to bake, more like 45 minutes, so you may want to have some mutz sticks or fries while you wait...we had the fried cheese and it definitely tasted fresh. I think it may be the same cheese they use on the pizza, just hand breaded. Toppings are plentiful and you can taste how good they are. Well seasoned sausage balls (not crumbled or sliced), thick pepperoni and cheese that stretches by the foot when you spatula a piece off the pan. This is some serious Chicago pan and totally different from most artisan or standard NY pizza joints. And that's what makes it stand out on its own! It's the white swan of pizza in a city of lots of ugly ducklings. Tip: Last summer, there was a pop-up Emmett's booth in the Broadway Bites Urban Space in the Fashion District where they sold slices of their amazing pan (cheese and pep only). If you don't want to commit to a whole evening and entire pie, be on the lookout at the Urban Spaces around the city to see if they return. They were also a vendor on the food delivery site Served by Stadium so you could always get some delivered. Just be prepared for a carb coma if you opt to order during lunch.",,,

74,K. D.,"New York, NY",60,65,100,4.0,2/4/2017,"Emmett's focuses on some of Chicago's famous staples and I tried the Chicago style hot dog. It starts with a poppyseed bun and an all beef frankfurter. Add yellow mustard, onions, sweet relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato wedges, pickled sport peppers and a dash of celery salt. What you will not see on this style of dog, is ketchup. Friendly staff. Great dogs!",1,,
75,Syyu C.,"Manhattan, NY",548,270,1485,3.0,2/5/2016,"Went to Emmett's on a whim one Tuesday night to try deep dish pizza without going all the way to Chicago. There was no wait when we arrived around 7pm, but the place quickly filled up by 8pm. It's a small low-key restaurant, with only bar seating with stools and 5-6 tables for a party of two. They push the tables together if you have a larger party.  We put in our order of a medium deep dish pizza ($24) right away with a side of fries ($5). The pizza charges an additional $4 for meat toppings, and $2 for vegetable toppings.Once we put in our order, we waited.. waited.. and just waited for our pizza to come out. I understand that deep dish pizza takes a long time to bake. With the menu mentioning to allow at least 20 minutes for cooking, our pizza actually took almost an hour to come out. I was already picking at the crumbs from the fries that came out 40 minutes earlier.  The pizza was pretty good - I definitely enjoyed it. Two slices of the thick pie (a medium comes with 6 slices) was enough to keep me full. The pie was fresh - not oily or greasy at all.  But it's not something I would wait an hour for, since it was basically melted cheese on top of thick dough. The tomato sauce tasted a bit sour, and the crust was not flavorful as I would have liked. However, the pizza was still great to try once! But I'll leave my next deep dish pizza experience to when I'm in Chicago.",1,1,

Emmett's is a bar- a charming one on one of the prettiest streets in the Village. This place is popular and small. Ate:Arugula saladBar pie- half pineapple The rocket salad with apples & walnuts was spot on- perfectly dressed. The thin crust came out lovely - round cut in squares, made to share.

First we had a noisy family next to us then a bunch of women with way too much perfume who were on their phones the whole time, so it ""could"" be romantic if you could ignore the crowd.

The menu is very small but the food is tasty. The three of us split the homemade potato chips and split a deep dish pie of half spinach half pepperoni. The pizza was great. Just as close to Chicago style deep dish as you can get in NYC and, I've been to Chicago before.The restaurant is tiny all of the tables are very close together but that gives it an old school charm. My main suggestion for any type of improvement would be for Emmett's to expand their menu maybe add some entrees. Bottom line - good deep dish that makes for a great picture, but your in NYC go for the classic NYC slice.",1,,

Needless to say, pretty stoked to try it out.Came in and no one else there (aside from a couple finishing up), so was able to quickly order a Small Sausage Pizza ($22) and a beer ($6). The menu says the pizza will take 20 minutes - I waited 35 minutes, then another mandatory 3 minutes so it could cool down. Was definitely hungry when I finally got to chow down, so was able to finish off the entire thing in about 12 minutes. Very cheesy and thick sausage chunks for each slice (4). The crust was crisp but chewy enough to eat all the way through (and to mop up the extra sauce).Love the pizza, but just not at the price and wait time. Good for the novelty of having a true deep dish in NY and that's about it.",2,1,

85,Eric W.,"New Haven, CT",33,26,0,4.0,1/7/2018,"Took a drive down to try this spot out. Been hearing a lot about it lately. Small little restaurant, about 10 tables with bar and very easy going, laid back environment. Service was good. We had the deep dish pizza w pepperoni. Tangy, zesty sauce smothered in delicious cheese. We had the 12""deep dish that took about a half hour to make. Eating just 2 pieces filled me up plenty. The crust is alittle bland but some how goes very well with the intense flavor of the sauce. Def not your New York style pizza, however they do make a thin crust that we didn't try. Never had Chicago style pizza before but I am loving this place for their pizzas and chill environment. We will be back!!",,,
86,Anna N.,"Manhattan, NY",61,199,240,3.0,3/28/2017,"Does this place stack up  to Giordano's? No. Will it satisfy your deep dish craving? Yes. When I entered the first time, the 2 employees were friendly. This place is definitely small with only a few tables. Therefore, you'll be elbow to elbow with your neighbor. I came early to beat the lunch crowd. I ordered the deep dish pizza with pepperoni, caramelized onions, and green peppers. When the pizza slice was cut and placed in front of me, the slice collapsed on the plate immediately. The bottom of the crust isn't as thick as other deep dish and some parts of it was even cold. That made me question how fresh this pizza was. Some deep dish pizza, you really have to put effort cutting through the bottom but not this pizza. Another yelper stated it was like ""sloppy"" deep dish pizza, and I have to agree with that. I think it was good but not great. Not worth it if you have to wait an hour for a table. I also don't like paying by signing the nasty Ipad.",2,,1

The cheese and sauce weren't bad, but the crust was so overcooked, you couldn't even cut through it with a knife. We ended up just eating the toppings off and leaving the crust. Waste of money. Most frustrating  was the service is nothing even close to the hospitality you get in the Midwest. Waitress was rude, would take 20 minutes to refill the water and roll her eyes when you asked twice- should mention there is no AC and it is sweating hot in the place, so you'd think they'd be filling the cups more.",,,

Their sausage is by far the best sausage I have had on a pizza!!! And wow I loved their thin crust!!

I knew that Emmett's had to be the real deal because another Chicagoan that is living in NYC highly recommended this place. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the pizza and the ambiance of the restaurant. I would high recommend going to Emmett's because the crust alone is enough to say you experienced Chicago style pizza. To be fair I will list out the pros and cons of Emmett's. Pros: The pizza is delicious and the crust is buttery and flaky They fill the pizza with a ton of toppings so you don't go hungryThis is a great date night restaurantThe staff are friendly and always have recommendations for youCons: The inside is extremely small so I wouldn't recommend this place for groups (roughly 8 tables)Whenever there are regulars at the bar it gets kind of roundy and takes away from any conversations that you are trying to haveToppings are pricey and can add up quickly ($4 for meat and $2 for vegetable)Not recommended for groups larger than 2,4,1,1

And no deep dish to be found. FINALLY. I found a place outside Chicago that offers exactly that. Emmett has really done it. AND he is too modest to brag about the excellent Chicago style hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches- with real Chicago style giardiniera.(The deep dish is good too, if you're into that.)Also love the staff and the atmosphere- and yes it is a younger crowd but that's the vibe.

As a native New Yorker who enjoyed Giordano's and Lou Malnati's in Chicago, obtaining deep-dish pizza in New York City was akin to getting a ride on a narwhal...until my friend texted me about it. We got a 10"" pizza in one of the set styles (it was a vegetarian option). The name escapes me, but the overall result was solid after our 30-minute wait. The sauce had good balance while the cheese was flavorful. The crust was interesting, as it had a subdued taste that complemented the richness of the cheese and sauce. That said, I think the crust actually could've used a little more salt--and this is coming from someone whose chief complaint in restaurants is when things are too salty. The place, as reviewers have mentioned, is TINY, but the wine and beer selection is pretty legit for a pizza place. Definitely come here in groups of four or less. If you can, visit during off hours--we visited at around 3pm, and we had an empty table next to us until 5pm. The waiters/bartenders were all really sweet and easy to talk to, like seeing old friends.

Seems as though they were not only short staffed but not enough tables to accommodate the restaurant.

Our waitress was nice and kindly agreed to helping me get a good pic of her serving the first slice. :)The inside is very casual and kind of crammed with limited seating, but not a big deal if you come early in the day. My only complaint would be that on the menu it says that the pizzas take 20 minutes to cook, however, I know they take longer than that. Despite the restaurant only having two other parties there besides us, our pizza took 50 minutes to come out. I don't have a problem with waiting I just wish they had a more accurate time estimate written on the menu so people can expect the longer wait.

The waitress told us we could get a small, but to pick a medium if we wanted leftovers, and we had a slice left for each of us for lunch the next day (you know, to celebrate America's Presidents). The pizza was flavorful and fresh, and as we ate it we reminisced about the one time we had deep dish pizza in Chicago and then didn't eat for a full 24 hours afterwards because we were still full.

115,Krina S.,"Jersey City, NJ",173,303,704,5.0,1/4/2015,"I've been meaning for a while now to check this place out. I was really hoping it'd live up to the hype, and it definitely did! I was such a happy camper after this meal. My bf and I got there early on a Fri night... the place is TINY, so we got there early to avoid waiting for a table. You can also sit at the bar. Normally I don't like doing that, but this bar is pretty wide so you have plenty of room and so that's where we ended up voluntarily sitting. It turned out to be a good choice because then we got to chat up Emmett himself who was manning it; super nice, chill guy.Food: get the French fries. I don't know what it is about them, but these are probably some of the BEST french fries I've had. They're perfectly sized, seasoned, and fried. Totally worth it as an app for only $5, and you'll have something to munch on while waiting for your pizza. The pizza itself is delish. Love the crust. I'm not from Chicago, but my bf is and he loved it both times he's been here. My only minor complaint is that there's a tad too much sauce, but that may just be a personal thing. For 2 people, a medium size is perfect, if you want a slice or 2 to take home. Drinks: Great, wide beer selection.In conclusion, Emmett is cool peoples, the place is a great date night spot (albeit tiny), and the pizza is very yummy and well-priced. Will definitely return when my waistline can spare it.",1,1,1

119,Christina C.,"Brooklyn, NY",293,76,77,4.0,1/8/2016,"Deep. Dish. Pizza.I first tried searching for deep dish in New York (a bit blasphemous, I admit), but after a meal here, I am absolutely floored.For me, even though I'm a voracious eater, one meaty slice of deep dish, willed with sausage and pepperoni, was enough to get me through the rest of the night. They also have an amazing pear cider (called ACE), which I highly recommend. The seats were limited, but we came at a good time: my boyfriend and I were able to be seated immediately. The pie takes a bit long to cook, and we were left impatient towards the end of the nearly half-hour wait. However, we had some delicious potato chips to hold us over. When the pie finally came, we were rewarded with cheesy-filled goodness. Though it might strike as a bit pricey compared to the NYC thin slice, think of this place as an investment into your culinary travels, especially if you've only had UNO Chicago Grill (chain restaurant) deep dish, and not the real kind like here.PS. Come early in the night for a good seat.",1,,

Can hinestly say is in the running for the best pizza I've ever had.  I tried the thin crust ham pizza and the pepperoni deep dish pizza, both of them were absolutely unbelievable!! The bartender was super friendly too.  The one negative is that the pizza took quite a while to come out but needless to say it is worth the wait.Highly recommended!",,,

123,Dana K.,"New York, NY",6,52,13,4.0,4/3/2016,"It's no substitute for Chicago, but we're in Manhattan and it is the best thing you are going to get. And it's actually REALLY good. It's doughy, and cheesey, and just the right amount of saucey. It will leave you full and more than satisfied. And it's actually pretty inexpensive when you split the pies between a group! I've never had the thin crust, which does look very good, but when I go to Emmett's I go for something I can't get in New York, the deep dish. It's a very small restaurant with about 20 seats total and a bar that seats maybe 10. Bar is first come first serve. I've been there on weeknights with no wait for two, and weekends for like a two hour wait for four.  BUT they take your number and call you when the table is ready, so go in expecting that you just need to hang out at one of the million bars near by, because it is worth it. Also it takes at least 30 mins for the pizza to come out, because they have to actually make the thing. Beer/wine selection is decent and the vibe is low lighting fun for dates or small groups. The Mozz sticks are amazing as well. Super good place if you just need some deep dish pizza and happen to be in New York!",,,
124,Roberto B.,"Los Angeles, CA",127,80,2,2.0,11/11/2016,"I have two basic criticisms about Emmett's. The food, and the clientele/service.Firstly I want to point out that I have reached the summit of deep dish Mount Everest, and it is called Dough Box in Los Angeles. I know what divine deep dish should feel, look and taste like. Emmett's is sloppy deep dish. Literally. It's a gooey, cheesy, unrefined mess. If your idea of deep dish is that it should just be a receptacle for 5 pounds of cheese, then this is your spot. Personally I like tasty ingredients and a little subtlety - and Emmett's failed me in both departments. The sauce just isn't that interesting. The cheese tastes like a blob of microwaved Kraft mozzarella. And worst of all, the crust was completely dry and felt like it lived on a different planet compared to the gooey center of the pizza. One was too gooey, the other was too dry. Regarding the clientele/service. The restaurant, as is common with the West Village, was jam-packed, tiny and hot. It was very bro-ish which *sigh* tends to be the new face of the Village. I sat at the bar with a friend. There was a group of young villagers behind us, in the minuscule corner by the window. They couldn't have been more obnoxious. They were knocking into us, shouting, ordering over our heads like we weren't there. And the waiter was happy to engage in similar behavior and talk VERY loudly over us. At one point he felt it was okay to exchange tips about hip-hop albums at an insanely high volume- to the point where I literally could not hear anything my friend was saying.Is this a restaurant/bar or a keg party during orientation week at NYU?!?There was an attempt made to apologize since we were obviously very frustrated with the constant interruptions and yelling. But what is a man to do?? Be an asshole and tell them that no, it's not okay to scream over our heads while we're trying to eat and drink? Or just smile and take it on the chin because, you know, we're all having a blast and let's get drunk and eat pizza and wooooooooo?!?I opted for another option. I paid very quickly and ran away. Probably never to return again.Hint 1: don't have a waiting area attached to your bar seating.Hint 2: don't yell over patrons Hint 3: don't overcrowd your restaurant Hint 4: take a trip to Dough Box and learn from the zen masters.",,3,1
125,Kimberly L.,"New York, NY",13,26,88,5.0,12/10/2015,"Every business should strive to have the attitude of the people who work at Emmett's. Makes me happy that such people exist (and yet sad that such people don't). Shout out to Paul, Camden, and nameless bartender and waitress (sorry). They're all helpful and easy to engage with. I asked ahead of time if a small, outside dessert would be allowed after the meal in honor of a birthday. They said yes and offered to plate it. Extra respect for the transition between waiters, because our new waitress brought out the stashed dessert without a whispered reminder. Very smooth.Food's great. $11 for the arugula salad - featuring grana padano, sliced apple, lemon juice, chopped walnuts. My friend and I shared their $18 small deep-dish pizza +$2 spinach topping. Let me tell ya: it looks small but it's filling. We just-finished it. Skeptics can sit their butts down (everything is subjective), but the deep-dish here is really good. It's a solid crust on the bottom with hearty sauce; always mindful of how it holds up in that area. I ate the crust-edge with like 1/2"" of the remaining sauce+cheese since it looked like it could use a moisture factor. Delicious. Ideally I'd have a picture of the wonnndrously stretchy mozz as a slice was pulled off.One hun'ned pa'cent. Nice beer and wine selection to boot.",1,,
126,Lisa C.,"New York, NY",236,268,129,3.0,2/7/2016,"Disclaimer: I'm a born and raised New Yorker so of course I'm gonna be a harsh pizza critic. I came here on a Friday night with a native Chicago friend and he loveeees deep dish pizza. Now i've had deep dish pizza in Chicago myself and I didn't like it but I was willing to give this a try. Emmett's is super tiny with maybe 5 tables that seat at most 20 people. There are also bar seats available. The menu is very limited to some various appetizers and the pizza. If you order deep dish, it's about a 30 min cook time so do not come hungry already. The fries we had were very flavorful- but I also could have been very hungry. As for the pizza, i loved the cheesiness but I'm sorry, still a NY thin crust pizza gal at heart. I viewed it more as a cheesy, saucy cookie with sausage and peppers. Good flavors just not what i'm into. I would love to come by again at a less busy time because the crowds and noise dampened my experience as well.",,,

128,Juliane L.,"New York, NY",383,633,1398,2.0,4/17/2014,"Well.... I really wanted to like the deep dish pizza, I really wanted to be like wow a quiche and a pizza in one shot, can't go wrong. What a disappointment. First of all, it looks terrible, it reminded me of a kid's playdough creation.... I know, don't judge your plate by it's cover, oysters look awful but they aren't that bad, not the case here: looked like playdough, tasted worst than playdough. It really saddens me, I don't want to be mean, but the recipe has to change, we are SO spoiled in NYC with amazing pizza than this is gonna die out fast. Let me elaborate on the quiche pizza here: 1) The dough... There is an aftertaste to it. What is it? Olive? beer? yeast? It's not good. The texture is at the same time too caky and not soft enough. It's like bitting into a butter cookie without butter. yeah, not too good. 2) The layer of cheese is so thick, it's disgusting. Cheese doesn't taste good either, it's a gooey madness of harden flavorless something. yeah, not so good either. 3) The tomato sauce. Failed again. No flavor. Straight out of the can? It was so bland, couldn't taste spices, couldn't taste garlic, or olive oil, or basil... couldn't taste anything that makes a good tomato sauce. 4) We ordered our dish with bacon. $4 to find tiny pieces of bacon in the sauce. What?!! ugh. It was so so bad, You couldn't even tell there was any, but when you were lucky enough to find a piece of it, that awful tomato sauce hurtful flavor took over. Way to ruin bacon. Overall, this was very mediocre, I am hurt to have spend the money and the time there. Oh yeah, and $4.50 for a diet coke, COME ON. I didn't even eat an entire slice. You know sometimes food isn't too good but you eat it, I couldn't even eat this.",6,1,

130,Charles B.,"Manhattan, NY",0,2,0,1.0,6/9/2017,"This place is an absolute DUMP. I decided to give it a second chance after they took two and a half for delivery and try it in house. We were seated after fifteen minutes and tossed menus ten minutes later. Ten minutes more and our orders were taken -  a deep dish and a thin crust. One full hour later we had nothing. Ten minutes after that we had our thin crust. Asked to have everything bagged up and they told us it'd be another twenty minutes for the deep dish. That was about right. So two hours later we had our food.With so much GREAT pizza nearby -- Arturo's, joes, johns, spunto, keste-- why waste your time here?",1,,
131,Meghan A.,"New York, NY",230,582,505,4.0,2/13/2014,"Emmett's is hot hot hot right now. I came at 6:30pm on a Wednesday, put my name and cell phone # in with a 90 minute wait, which ended up being an hour wait. We got a call about 30 minutes in asking if we'd like to place our pizza order, which is unusual, but logical, as it takes 45 minutes for the pizzas to cook. The staff was well-meaning, but flustered, and I could see the helplessness on their faces. This place is small! And when opening, I am certain that the owner did not anticipate this type of buzz or interest in Chicago pizza. New Yorkers are all about the thin crust, right? So I don't want to criticize the staff. However, I can criticize the aggressively obnoxious party of 4 that steamrolled the hostess with ""oh, we have 6 people now. Yeah, we'll just squeeze in"", then proceeded to unapologetically sit on my purse, and pretend that it was ok to put 6 people in an already tight 4-person table. The girl was literally 1"" away from me. If I wanted to eat dinner with a bitch in my lap, I would have brought the dog with me.So the shitshow and popularity of this place aside, this is actually some really great pizza. My only foray into the world of Chicago pizza was going to the old Pizzeria Uno on the Upper West Side when I was little, and I remember being pretty disappointed. Emmett's is what I would expect from the best of the Chicago knife and fork pies. Thick buttery crust, formidable, but not stale or too tough. Thick robust tomato sauce. Good quality pepperoni (I am sure they use the same supplier as my favorite pizza place of the moment - Fiore's). And gobs of stringy mozzarella that make life worth living. My husband and I split a 10"" medium pizza and a salad, and that was the perfect amount of food for us. To be fair though, I was pretty hungry going in.The beer and wine list was reasonably priced ($7 Gruner woo hoo!), but I can't see coming back. The popularity, clientele, wait times, and overall helpless hot mess factor is a big detraction for me, so I will definitely stick to takeout.",11,19,9
132,Diana C.,"Martinsburg, WV",12,188,389,4.0,12/27/2016,"Loved everything. Got a medium deep dish with sausage and onion, Greek salad, and house chips. All great!",,,
133,Mike C.,"Forest Hills, NY",5000,1636,64753,5.0,2/2/2014,"At last, we can finally eat an insanely delicious, overwhelmingly massive deep dish pie without having to go to Chicago.There is literally nowhere in NY to get a good deep dish pie, so after eating at all of the major players and some of the smaller places during a trip to Chicago a few years ago, I've been itching to go back for another taste of that buttery, cheesy, mass of pizza.Luckily for us in NY, two brothers from Chicago have opened up a little spot serving up these deep dish pies, just as good as any of the great pies from the homeland.It feels like a bar inside - dark, with pretty loud music, and a bar where most of the available seats are. There are also some tables along the side, but it is a pretty small place. I came on Super Bowl Sunday, so it was almost completely empty, though they were pretty swamped with several pickup orders. These people were smart, because these beautiful pies can easily feed several partygoers.Just like all deep dish places, the menu has the helpful notation that pies take 35 minutes to make (I remember seeing 45 minutes listed on all of the menus in Chicago, which is what it ended up taking here, so don't bother trying to come here for a quick pie).My only real complaint here is that they need to get some more good stuff on the menu to order while you wait those 45 minutes for your pie. They could make bank if they offered up some greasy bar food or even some Italian style sandwiches or something like that instead of the few forgettable salads on offer (we tried the small Arugula Salad for $8 just because we of course needed something while we waited). The only other thing on the menu is burgers, but I feel like I'm the only person ridiculous enough to order a burger as an appetizer for a huge pizza (I actually didn't though). Also, if you come here and get the burger instead of the pizza, you need to sort your life out).Most importantly, the pizza was incredible, and just as good as some of the best pies from Chicago. It kind of doesn't look like it will be good, when it first comes out: a huge mass of red sauce, surrounded by a pale-looking, thick wall of crust. Once you taste it though, you see how wrong that is. It's more like 48 minutes before you can eat though - they set down an egg timer next to the pie, explaining that the cheese is still cooking in there, and that you need to wait before cutting into the huge, piping hot pie.After those longest 3 minutes of life, Emmett's brother skillfully cut the pie up into 6 huge slices and started us each off with one. Don't worry about getting caught like DeBlasio, you definitely need to start on these slices with a fork and a knife. As suggested, we got a Medium for the two of us ($20), topped with pepperoni ($3) and sausage ($1.50 for each additional topping). If you eat like a normal person, the smaller size is actually probably enough, as this is some heavy pizza. But it is so good, and so worth the heavy feeling you will have after. The huge wall of crust is actually delicious, and I ended up eating way too much of it. The sauce is slightly sweet, and the sausage and/or pepperonis had a little kick to them, making for a really great combination of flavors.Emmett's brother provided some good, friendly service at the bar, with friendly chit-chat while we waited. He mentioned how the menu is still in soft opening mode, and they would be adding several more items by the summer, like some Italian Beef and other Chicago specialties. I only wonder if they can handle the volume if they get popular, and I hope they can, as the pizza is excellent and I would love to come back to try some more great stuff in a few months once I feel hungry again.",25,12,16

Actually, it's probably the only other place besides Uno's in several hours radius of NYC.  In general, I was pleased with Emmett's.  After about an hour or so wait, hunkered down in the windowsill behind the bar, we put in an order in advance.  It takes about 45 minutes to get to see your pizza once you order it.  Once it is ready, they bring it out and start an hourglass.  After all this waiting, you need to wait those final minutes so they can cut your pizza with an axe-like motion (to break the crust; see my picture. note too, the two women staring in amazement in the background).  Of note, if you order a family style pizza, it doesn't seem as thick and they bring it out in a pan ready to eat and sliced.  The pizza itself was good. I wouldn't say 5 stars as it is not the best Chicago Style I have had. The crust is substantial--very thick on the bottom.  The amount of cheese and sauce was just right; not too overwhelming. Sadly, I didn't get to try the toppings as I was with a veggie person who just wanted to eat cheese (I am jonesing for snausage and pep). However, for the time being, it is the best you will find outside of Chicago, Detroit, or SF.  And it is better than Unos.   I'm happy this came to NYC; I will be back with carnivores.",7,4,6

I think something that could really improve on their wait time is to get the order from people that are waiting and charge the order first, having their pizza ready to go by the time they're seat would really help and get more customers through the door.[Food]: I really liked the ingredients they used, but the pizza was a little more soupy than I would have liked. I have mixed feelings on the crust. It is good, but it is so HARD. I really like the way Giordano in Chicago does the crust. I think Emmetts can take their game to the next level if they tried to emulate that.[Decor]: This place is small, maybe 5 or 6 tables maximum. There is some bar seating, but that's also small as well.

I hustled over there, girlfriend in tow to try it out. The place is small and tucked away from the main drag which makes it seem like a little secret and even though it was really busy we got a table right away. We ordered their large sausage-basically a Chicago staple and the owner walked up to us. He was from the Chicago area and really seemed to know his stuff, calling the pizza here a mix between Geno's and...and then he stopped so we could form our own opinions about it. I mentioned to him how I heard that he'd be making an Italian beef sandwich soon-which inspires joy-joy feelings from me. He was waiting to perfect the giardineira first before putting it out there.The pizza-which takes time which is also standard for a pizza of this depth was pretty good. The sauce was tasty-a little too much sauce that it literally runneth over after pulling a slice out and the crust was a little thin for my taste (not that it was any less authentic, we all have our preferences.) The sausage, for me wasn't distributed enough, and even my not a huge carnivore of a girlfriend commented that she almost forgot we ordered a meat topping on it. When the owner came up to us when we were done he asked us what we thought of it. He was really looking for constructive criticism and when we let him know about our thoughts on it he really took them well. I feel like they're really trying to dial in their stuff to get a true Chicago style pizza and the owner is really great with getting feedback. I'm looking forward to coming back and then back again to see what it will be like after they work everything out and get the Italian beef online.",9,1,2

144,Scott G.,"Brooklyn, NY",34,455,10,2.0,5/15/2016,"I've eaten at Emmett's twice over a two-year span, and both times I wasn't impressed with their deep dish pizzas. Unfortunately, besides the global pizza chain Uno's (yuck), I believe Emmett's is the only Chicago pizza spot in NYC, which leaves me with very few choices when craving a pie. When compared to the other deep dish pizza places I've been to in Chicago and San Francisco, the tomato sauce was soupy and caused the pizza to fall apart. Ingredients (meat and veggies) weren't fresh and missed that ""pop"" other pies carry. The crust was way too soft and doughy.",3,2,
145,Kristyan Rose G.,"New York, NY",2,21,4,4.0,5/1/2016,"I would give 5 stars but I wish they had more seating and were perhaps just a little cheaper.Food- good beer selection and the pizza is all that they say it is. I had a deep dish with pepperoni and mushrooms. The pepperoni slices were thicker than usual in a good way. The crust wash cooked through and I didn't find it watery at all.Service- we sat at the bar and were served by the bartender. She was loaded with phone orders on this rainy day but was capable and friendly. The manager/owner guy flirts around and keeps things interesting. Good thing he's cute because with the small space, you can't escape him.Atmosphere- laid back vibe, cozy, and comfy. Very limited seating. Great place for a good convo among friends.Price- the pizza is expensive but it's worth it considering all the cheese they load on that bad boy. Beer is well priced. I'll be back!!",5,,

Well, fine.Knowing that the pizza would take 45 min to cook, I asked if I could place my order in advance. The waitress said NO. Urm.. why? We finally agreed that she would call me 30 min prior to my table being ready, so they could start making the pizza. Well, we went to a nearby bar. I was hoping to get a call in 30 min. Nope. Silence.Waited another 30 min. Still.. silence. I decided to call the restaurant myself and placed an order for an extra large pizza with pepperoni and onions to feed 4.We walked over to the restaurant and the waitress refused to acknowledge us. She pretended that we were invisible. How awkward. It would have been nice if she would have looked at us and told us that our table would be ready in XX min or at least acknowledge our presence.Anyways, 30 min later, we finally sat down. We had definitely waited more than 90 min. Even though we had ordered the pizza some time ago, we waited another 20 min for the pizza. We had to order wine to feel better. The waitress had already left a bitter taste in my mouth even before I had sat down. As for the pizza, it was delicious. Amazing thick crust, lots of gooey cheese- I can't complain.

I honestly cannot get enough of Emmett's.It is a really tiny restaurant so if you don't get there right when they open expect to wait a while - also large groups aren't the best for this place. It's not the best crust I've had but their sauce and fillings are primo (for what you can get in NY). It takes about 25 minutes from when you order for the pizza to be ready so be prepared to wait!I would recommend just grabbing the pizza to go and eating it in the park (though that does prove to be a little bit messy given the fork and knife nature of this pizza).,2,2,

Updated review","Came back tonight to try the pizza. We came in around 7:30 on a Thursday night and it wasn't a problem to get a table for 4 (two adults, and of course the two teens). A little trouble with ordering, as the server seemed to maybe not speak english too well. But pointing to the items on the menu worked just fine. After ordering the Goose Island beers, the bartender (Dillon) came on out to ask if we were from Chicago since we went straight for the Goose Island. Hubby explained that we had been here last week and he recommended them...and then Dillon apologized for not recognizing us and proceeded to chat us up. Adorable (as I've stated previously).The pizza was delicious. We got two - one with veggies and one with meat. I am not an expert on Chicago style pizza, but I will go on record as saying it's Zachary's-worthy and those who know what that means will get it. Oh, what the hell - here you go everyone else: yelp.com/biz/zacharys-ch…When the pizza came, Dillon brought us out two glasses of wine that he said he loved with pizza. I have no idea what it was (even though he told us LOL) but it was delicious and he was right - it went awesomely well with pizza.As we were leaving he came out from behind the bar again to say goodbye.This is the neighborhood place you wish to have....so go ahead New Yorkers....go. You won't be sorry.",,1,

My boyfriend and I custom ordered a chicken, fresh tomatoes and basil large pizza (and our waiter kept updating us on our pie's cook time, which was nice since deep dish does take a long time to bake), we each had a glass of wine (we're not winos, so can't complain or attest to exceptionalism) and were promptly asked if we wanted a 2nd round, but not hounded when we declined. I had no complaints about the crust, and am anxiously waiting to devour my leftover slices which is almost my favorite part of my deep dish routine. The place is quite small as others mentioned, but it seems as though they have optimized the efficiency of their layout because our surrounding parties, though very close, never projected a sense of intrusion or discomfort. Another plus was that our wait staff was very responsive to our checkout.",,,

My biggest gripe with Emmett's is they charge full price for half a topping.  Each topping is $4 and $2 for vegetables.  I ordered a half pepperoni and half sausage pizza and was charged $8 :(",3,1,

The servers were rushing us from the get go and when the pizza came, we were ready to boomerang picking up the slice so people can see the beauty of this pizza. Instead what happened was that the servers immediately served us each a slice and just placed really quickly on our place. I am still shook after that. The pizza is pretty good.

From Roberta's to Tottono's to Satchel's (from my hometown in Florida), I thought I had tried and eaten the best pizza. Emmet's, however different, really blew me away. The crust is made fresh, the sauce is rich and somewhat spicy, and the pizza doesn't skimp on anything. A 10 inch pizza is plenty to share between a couple of people, with bigger sizes more suitable for groups. What more can a pizza lover ask for?Keep in mind that the joint is small (the cozy not cramped kind,) so make sure to reserve a table. Even on a Sunday night at 9pm, I found the restaurant completely full. Also, the corkage fee is $40, so don't plan to bring a bottle of wine. Glasses of wine range from about $9-$14, with bottles of wine starting at about $36.

167,Ben L.,"Queens, NY",962,976,2710,3.0,12/9/2014,"So my knowledge of deep dish Chicago pizza is limited since I have yet to go to Chicago and I have only had Uno's. I was super excited to find an Uno's alternative but to be honest, I was a bit disappointed. First, the place is tiny and cramped. There were only like 5 ish tables and the seating was kinda uncomfortable. And second, the place seemed like a bar that just happened to have food. It seemed very divey. There was a small bar on the right. Side note, I am a born and raised New Yorker and I didn't want my allegiance to get in the way. If food is good, food is good. I don't care for NY vs CHI. And I think Chicago pizza is completely different so you can't really compare NY pizza and Chi pizza. But comparing Chicago pizzas, I like Uno's better.The foodDeep Dish Chicago style pizza with sausage and onions- Where do I begin? First the sauce, it did have a nice tang but it didn't have the love I was expecting out of the sauce, it kinda had a store bought feel and it bothered me. Second, the onions, while there, were such a non factor. I figured sausage and onion would be a great combo, but I barely noticed the onions at all. My friend, who lived in Chicago, was pissed that the sausage came in crumbles and put on top as opposed to having an actual layer of sausage like they do in Chicago. Lastly, the crust is usually my fav part of the pie, I like dough, but the crust was kinda dry and flavorless, it was basically limp. It was also kinda weird that the center wasn't really hot. The pie was fully cooked, but I was expecting the first bite to burn my mouth and it just seemed warm and not blazing hot. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",3,2,3

I had a reservation at hundred acres for brunch at 1:30 and it was packed and we were early. We decided to find a bar to enjoy a beer to kill time. We went to Emmets by chance. While we were there, a group also seated at the bar ordered a large deep dish pizza. It smelled so amazing that we actually cancelled our other reservation and decided to try one ourselves. YUM! It's definitely a busy spot and it takes 30 minutes for the pizza to bake but it's so worth it. I will be back.",,,
169,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",875,1242,25,4.0,1/4/2015,"On a rainy Saturday, bf, me, and another couple came to Emmett's on a Saturday at 7.  We were lucky we only had to wait for a table for 15 or so (but make sure you come early because it otherwise gets really crowded and tables are easily given away for parties that keep the crew waiting.. it's a tiny restaurant! They do do takeaway though :)We began with a few glasses of wine- a glass of Riseling, Syrah, Malbec and Cab (what I got- my favorite red) which was the typical full body profile I expected. There were weird sedatives in our friend's Syrah, so we pointed it out to the waitress and she replaced it immediately free of charge.  Our waitress was actually a hardworking sweetie, being by herself in the restaurant, but the service overall was a little slow.. I think that was due more to the cooking time of the pizza than anything else.  For 4, we ordered the family size for $30 and man it took forever- like 45 min. They do warn you on the menus that pizzas can take up to 20 but they should say more like 20-45 min.  Oh well, we had the delicious house cut potato chips (very salty but yummy) and caesar salad (also really salty but yummy) to share. As for the pizza, of course we went for the deep dish which was a unique experience. They do offer NY thin crust which I think is a waste but hey to each their own.  It was awesome- really yummy heaping red sauce (a bit sweet), which we had with sausage, mushrooms (that was an accident), spinach, and peppers on it. The sausage was super flavorful and I really enjoyed the peppers. The best part is the crust- a hard and dry yet delightfully fun to eat crust.  You need some initial help serving the pizza when it comes out hot, and you need a knife and fork to eat it. It's really more like a pie!It's a fun trip to Chicago while in NY and I would recommend. Dinner came with two shared plates, a family size pizza and 4 glasses of wine came to $100 which is really reasonable i feel.",2,,

Said 20 minuto, nah, 30-something. That's stupid, yo. Then, got some potato something joints, I swear to god they were deep fried Muncho chips, I'm not even lying. I googled the texture of Muncho's chips, and they were exactly the same, and the damn things were $10! Cray.The pizza, I got some sausage and green peppers on the family order pizza. I ain't gonna lie, the pizza was mad big, but I was mad disappointed when I saw the way the sides were prepped. There was barely any meat on it, and the green peppers were damn near raw. Yeah, I know, sauce on top, but that looks kind of stupid, i like the cheese to hold the sauce ON the pizza, not have the sauce all over the damn place. Now the doh, lol, come on son, we all know that's for an actual pie like cherry or apple pie. It does not go well at all with these crazy concoctions they offer.I didn't order drinks, because I'm NYC born and raised, ordering drinks from restaurants automatically makes your bill go from $50 to $150, so I ain't stupid.Oh, check this, so I got the potatoes (boiled Muncho's potato chips if you ask me,) the family size pizza with 2 sides, $50. $50 BUCKS FOR A PIZZA BASICALLY. Chill, I ain't coming here no more, best beli' dat. It was $50 for a big ass doh with some sauce and cheese really. And yo, what's the deal with the candles and dark atmosphere!? It's fucking pizza for god's sake, not a lovers lounge. Get some fucking light up in there, yo' ass be walking out with pizza sauce all over and shit, and not even know it!All in all, i would never come back here again, if it wasn't for my high ass friends, I wouldn't have ever went, nor had I even heard of it before, too.

My ranking of deep dishes are the following Lou'sEmmettPequodGino'sGiordanosPeople who say this is nothing like a deep dish have probably only tried one place in Chicago that does a different style crust.

They also get points for being very polite with a customer that was extremely challenging. In fact I'd had never seen a customer ever do what this dude did to a server. When the server brought the couples pizza to the table and began to take a slice off the platter he ever so slightly pushed the slice off of the spatula. This was than challenged by the customer wanting to know if he had washed his hands. I can understand this customer not wanting to see the action take place but in all my time in Emmett's I did not see any unclean actions. And, as any good foodie knows the more high end the restaurant the more touching of any food will happen. Points to the server for being polite and knowing the awkwardness of the situation.",,,

Luckily a table cleared early and we got a nice seat by the window. However, everything went down hill from there. We had ordered a bottle of wine at the bar, and the hostess took our pizza order before we sat, because she told us it typically takes a long time. Our pizza didn't come out until an HOUR AND A HALF later, and that's being modest. The waitress was not apologetic, she kept saying it was busy in the kitchen. That would be a reasonable excuse but for the handfull of customers who arived much later than us and got their food first. We were forced to sit there salivating over the smells. The people sitting next to us felt so bad for us they even offered us a slice of their pizza. Not an ideal way to spend a Friday night date.

The firs time was okay, the pizza was okay, nothing too amazing. I do remember it being really salty. Like saltier than what I'm used to when I go to Chicago to eat deep dish. The staff was weird, but my friend and I just chalked it up to them being new.Fast forward to the other night. My friend really wanted to come here, I didn't. I said, every place deserves a second chance and since they're from my hometown, I'll do it. The bartender/owner was seated talking to patrons so one of the servers got our orders and was nice enough to leave a pitcher of water for us. Then walk in a few dudes who sit next to us and put their jackets on the rack behind them. They then block our way out by putting a stool where we would need to walk. So whenever we needed to use the restroom, it was a lot of ""excuse me, excuse me"" and them not really moving. Weird and jerky.We ordered the fries to start, which were good, not amazing, but good. Enough to tide us over (well her because I wasn't that hungry)Our pizza came and with it a tiny hourglass. The owner/bartender explained that because the kitchen is tiny there isn't enough room for the table pizzas and the bar pizzas to both cool off in the back, so they put this out with the hot pizzas at the bar and we wait until the sand has all dropped to the bottom to cut. Cute idea. He cut the slices for us and we ate. Now I thought it was salty before and I still think it is. It's ok pizza. It's nothing to rave about. Being from Chicago, not a lot of Chicagoans really go out for deep dish like that. That being said it was okay. My friend liked it, but I think we were both turned off by the really weird vibe (that I won't go into here, just know it involved a VERY loud woman).So yeah, it's okay.

181,Michael C.,"New York, NY",21,47,20,5.0,12/14/2015,"I wish I was eating here now instead of writing this review.  I have never had such authentic good Chicago pizza outside of Chicago until this place.  I have been here twice and both times were 5 star experiences.I am from the suburbs of Chicago and the friend I went with both times is from downtown Chicago.  We both love NY pizza, but there is a special place in our hearts for Chicago pizza.  There are some misconceptions about Chicago pizza...like it is only deep dish.  Chicago also has really great thin crust pizza.  it is distinctive from New York.  Emmet's really delivers with an amazing thin crust pizza.  It is a must try.  So no one should cancel out this place because they don't think they would want deep dish.The last time I was there, I met the owner.  Very cool guy who bought us a beer because he saw 2 people who ordered more pizza than 2 people could possibly eat (we wanted serious left overs!).Great date place.  It is small, so there can be a wait.  Better to go with only one other person, though they of course seat more.  Casual, but in a cool way.",1,,
182,Josh K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",292,1301,45,5.0,5/17/2014,"Ignore the haters. It's amazingly good deep dish pizza. Do not get the salad, eat it at home beforehand or something, it really sucks. Crust is not the best I've ever had, but given the other choices here (Uno's) it is great. Best deep dish crust for me still goes to Little Star Pizza in SF with the cornmeal on the bottom.When your pie is brought out you will be asked to wait for the pie to coagulate/settle, respect this or the pie wil just be a goopy mess in your plate.Come before 7pm to get a table easily. It is easily 1hr+ otherwise.Quite affordable for 4 people to share a family size pie and you will be damn full.",3,,1
183,Missy S.,"New York, NY",556,222,143,2.0,3/2/2014,"Mediocre pizza. Hard crust (too hard even with fork and knife), long wait for the pizza to cook, minimal topping options. Why no spinach?? Broccoli? I like the environment and the service was friendly enough but in execution, wasn't impressed. The best part of the night was the sausage on top of the pizza.If I go back, I'll try a burger.  I hear they get their meat from one of the best meat distributors in the city.",7,,
184,Anya K.,"Toronto, Canada",1,11,20,5.0,5/6/2016,"One of the most delicious pizzas I've had in my life.  Definitely try the Chicago deep dish, it is very filling but so tasty. Amazing sauce and nice cheese. Crust is fantastic too. The service is really good, everyone is really friendly; the only one negative thing I can say about this place is it gets super busy in the evenings, and there aren't THAT many tables. But don't let that stop you from trying this place out! A real gem!",,,
185,Alex A.,"Miami, FL",5,124,18,4.0,1/9/2016,Great service and an awesome Chicago Style/Deep Dish Pizza that two can easily devour. I really enjoyed the experience. Their beer selection was also impressive. Worth a trip and I'll be back for more.,,,
186,Deanna W.,"New York, NY",344,320,232,4.0,1/27/2014,"Oh Emmett's! You sly fox you. Back in November when New Yorkers were set agog by Jon Stewart's jabs at Chicago-style deep dish pizza, a couple of brothers quietly** set up shop in my neck of the woods. Their specialty? Pizza, done the Chicago way. Though I remain wedded to the New York notion of pizza, I allow that variety is the spice of life and so when Emmett's opened up my curiosity was piqued. I am no deep dish pie aficionado, my previous encounters with this variant were at Uno's, usually at the behest of friends wanting to try something new. Which isn't much of a benchmark but it gave me the idea that deep dish style is a reheated previously frozen carb tub of sauce and cheese- a heavy contrast to the crispy New York slices I usually consort with. But let me tell you dear reader, that the concoction I've enjoyed several times now at Emmett's is actually 'fairly good.' Made to order, their deep dish pies sport a robust, flavorful sauce and gooey, stringy cheese. One can add toppings such as green peppers, onions, peperoni or some of their fantastic crumbly, fennel based sausage. If there's an Achilles heel in their pie, it's the crust. I found the band to be rather stiff and floury, a stark contrast to the buttery, flaky crusts I've read about elsewhere. But I cut them a bit of slack on this front. A variety of salads front the appetizer section of the menu which is probably a good thing since you'll want to order some greens to assuage yourself of the greasy guilt you'll feel after wards. They also do a decent pub burger: it's slightly greasy with a good char just like one's my father used to make back home. Located on a sleepy stretch of Soho, Emmett's is a cozy but loud local boite. They play good music here and the drink menu features several interesting selections from the Bourbon County stout to the Pear Cider from Sonoma. The owners, those two brothers from the Windy City, are welcoming and friendly. However, I must warn prospective deep dish goers that the place is TINY. There's room for about ten at the bar and sixteen at the tables. So get here early or be prepared to settle things the Chicago way if you are a party of more than two. All in all, I like the place. I'll gladly reach for a fork and knife for their pie but just don't call it ""pizza"" pizza to me.** By quiet, I mean quiet. Not much fanfare. Like seriously Mike C, how have you not graced this place with your presence?? :)",13,5,11
187,Jaime M.,"Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, NY",8,30,17,1.0,10/7/2015,"Save yourself the time, money and effort and stick to NY style pizza.  The food sucked!  The crust was awful perhaps better on an apple pie!All in all close up shop!  To add the location is infested with mice!We sat by the window and to be honest I couldn't focus on the awful pizza as I was to busy counting  rats! Thank god for my lovely date Not a fan instead go to your local UNOs ( trust me you will thank me)",1,1,
188,Skipper M.,"Brooklyn, NY",65,13,6,5.0,4/12/2014,"Wow. Born and raised in Chicago. And by Chicago I mean the actual city. This place is legit. Just like home and right up there with the windy city's best. Real Vienna hot dogs. Emmett's own Italian beef recipe brought me to tears, made me miss home. Not even lying, that dipped beef ranks up with Johnny's and I would eat it over a beef from Al's any day of the week.",2,1,3
189,Sam M.,"New York, NY",52,26,3,2.0,10/27/2015,"NOT CHICAGO DEEP DISH. I AM OFFENDED. No, seriously. This is so stupid. People here have an aversion to tall, high depth pizzas. So when the first place to say ""screw it, I'll be different!"" turns out to be lame, it's a huge disappointment.Infatuation agrees with me on this one. Sorry, but the (high depth) pizza is just plain lousy here. Not sure what is appealing about this establishment. Their one claim to fame - the one redeeming trait - manages to disappoint. When will there be a restauranteur courageous enough, BRAVE enough to open a decent deep dish pizza joint in Manhattan? Seemingly: never. Lou Malnati's, you will forever have my heart (and tummy!)",1,,
190,Peter T.,"New York, NY",11,66,683,3.0,1/25/2014,"I was raised on Malnati's and later Edwardo's and Gino's in Chicago. My best friend worked at the Malnati's take out on Lake Avenue near the Edens in high school. I've eaten A LOT of Malnati's, and Emmett's is no Malnati's. It's good, but when ordering a Sausage pizza I expect there to be, you know, sausage. Instead of a sausage pie I got a cheese pie with a couple of lumps of sausage. My wife thought they forgot the sausage completely. What a disappointment!That said, it's my only complaint.  Crust was great and cheese and sauce were worthy of being called Chicago style. I will go back but I guess I'll have to get the pepperoni because if this is how they roll with their sausage distribution, it's just not worth ordering it and being let down.",7,,2
191,Adam R.,"Brooklyn, NY",423,741,150,5.0,2/4/2014,"This is not the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. But it's probably the best deep dish pizza within a three hundred mile radius. Probably more, hence the five star rating, because this is a destination restaurant.Most important is the crust. It's buttery, flaky, a bit crunchy, and done right. Sets the tone for the pizza. After that the cheese is good. Comes out of the oven crazy hot, and then cools relatively quickly, though watching the egg timer can be torturous! The sauce is pretty authentic, though could be a little less acid-y and a little chunkier. A small complaint.Bigger though are the toppings, I tried the sausage and mushroom, need more flavor. This is probably my biggest complaint. The sauce, cheese and crust are such big players in a deep dish pizza, that the toppings really need oomph to make their presence felt. And these don't.Another small complaint is that they currently don't have spinach, but will be getting it ""soon"".Cool vibe. Laid back, chill, if a bit cramped. The place is small, and packing as many seats in, is important, I understand.",5,1,3
192,Kimberly Y.,"San Francisco, CA",218,342,97,4.0,1/31/2014,"It's no Gino's or Giordano's, but this is the best place to get authentic Chicago deep dish in the city, as far as I know.Even though the restaurant looks like a typical fancy Italian restaurant on the outside, the interior is one of the most crowded I've seen. The tables are placed next to each other and seat about 16 people. I would suggest you come in groups of 2, and at most 4 if you'd like to wait a little more. I came in at 7:45 and already had to wait perhaps 15 minutes to be seated, and I only came with my boyfriend. (I'd suggest coming early!) There's also a bar that seats about 10 people, and I didn't see anyone eating there, so I assume it's only for drinking or waiting for a table to open up. The place is definitely very cozy, but slightly uncomfortable--especially if you have large coats. Multiple people knocked over their wine glasses or utensils during my visit, so be careful! There's also really no great place to stand and wait for tables.My boyfriend and I ordered a medium pizza with sausage, mushrooms, and green peppers. Prices are pretty reasonable if you just get a pizza, especially with few toppings. I remember medium pizzas are $20 and large are $24, so I assume small are $16 and family-style are $28. The first topping is $3, and additional toppings are $1.50. Small and medium pizzas are generally for two people; large pizzas are for three, or perhaps two who want leftovers; family styles are for four. Just remember when choosing the size that you will probably be hungry due to the 35 minute cooking time and wait for seating. (EDIT: I think prices went up by $2 each.)Our pizza took about 40 minutes to cook and come out. It wasn't actually as hot as I would've liked, but was pretty delicious. My boyfriend is a die-hard NY pizza fan, but he had to admit that this deep dish was also great. The crust was great, just as deep dish should be. They're also decently generous with toppings, but sometimes the pizza can come out a little too saucy and salty.Service was great, though there's only one waitress for all 16 people and one bartender. The waitress was really nice and competent, even with all the people she had to take care of. I would suggest Emmett's to allow parties waiting to sit down to go ahead and order their food since deep dish takes about 30-40 minutes to cook. Most of the time, people are just sitting at their tables, waiting for their pizza to cook. Even with the small space, they could take care of patrons more quickly this way, especially once they become more well-known. Thanks to Yelp for helping me find this awesome deep dish restaurant!",6,,
193,Celine P.,"Aalborg, Denmark",0,38,4,5.0,4/8/2016,"This place is just lovely. There was about 30min wait, this place is really small, but it was really worth the wait. The guy behind the bar and the waitress was really nice to us while waiting. They were in general really nice, open and helpful the people working in there. The place is really cozy, dimmed lightning and perfect for a lovely dinner. Then the pizzas, they were just amazing. I enjoyed every single bite. Lots of cheese and the dough was really crispy. JUST GO HERE. One of the greatest places in town.Though, the area is not as lovely, I think. While we were eating some pervert starred at us for like 10min (we were sitting right next to the window and he was standing outside, and then suddenly he took out his genitals...  Not so pleasant, but it has nothing to do with this great place.",,,

196,Yan T.,"Manhattan, NY",2501,1708,228,4.0,4/22/2014,"Emmett's is a small and cozy cafe with a super-hip SoHo vibe (you know the kind). There's only a few tables, and we were lucky to be sat immediately at the open-air table straddling the sidewalk. It was so close to my brother's place that he was able to go upstairs and grad a sweater for the cool early spring night.I'm not a deep dish pizza snob, so the only thing I have to stack against Emmett's is Pizza Hut, but I thought the pie was really tasty and hearty without busting my gut. The second largest pie was plenty for a group of three. It was expensive for pizza, but very tolerable for a SoHo joint. There's not much other than pizza on the menu, so make sure you want that deep dish before you come.The wine list was quite nice and the beer list was well curated as well. I would come back here, especially with Chicago denizens to appraise the pie.",1,,3
197,Rosemary V.,"Manhattan, NY",245,502,263,4.0,1/8/2014,"Went on a Tuesday at 7:30pm.Ambience/ service: The place is very small so I suggest you come early. Lucky for us, we went on the one day that was 5 degrees outside so we were promptly seated. The staff was friendly and attentive. Our waitress was quite helpful and sweet.Pizza: We ordered a small pie, which serves two people (4 slices). This size is good if you can eat but are not starving. If you're hungry, order the medium size. We added onions, peppers, and mushrooms and it was amazing. The crust is seriously the best part. With that said, there's nothing like pizza in Chicago.They also have a good selection of wines. The sirah was quite good.I went with a friend who is from Chicago and he gave the pizza the stamp of approval.Definitely worth checking.",4,1,1

Cudos to the service and kind waiter/waitress.Small Menu which isn't an issue. Be prepared for a wait , but be prepared to be satisfied. Rating is 4.5/5 , but Yelp doesn't like me I guess.",,,

Then three local people stole what was our turn to be seated at the bar because the hostess waitress was all over the place doing two jobs.Pre ordered our pizza to expedite our food so we wouldn't have to wait.Finally had to almost wrestle other people waiting to get our seats at the bar.Sat at the bar they bring our pizza.Ate two slices when the bartender tells they where sorry because they gave us the wrong pizza..pizza wasn't that great..I'm from NYC patsy's is way better pizza or joe's..They gave us pork instead of what we ordered..I don't eat pork..I felt like throwing up as I left the establishment..the only good experience I had was the people next to us were friendly and good to converse with..sorry!emmets you suck!!!!",,,
