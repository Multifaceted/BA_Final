I really got into the minimalist lime green and white walls.For me, the place had a old-style, unpretentious retro flavor that I remember as a kid. It's so relaxing ! Everything they got is straight up good and hearty. I recommend getting a few pastries as well at the front of the door. Just wonderful !",

I ordered food earlier today from seamless, and the estimate delivery time showed a hour wait once I submitted my order. I have conference coming up in 30 mins, so I was worried that I wasn't able to get the food in time. I decided to call them to confirm if the food is being made. They told me there r few orders ahead of me and would like to cancel for me. I said thx. Two mins later, someone called me and started accusing me of wasting their food, because the food is already being delivered, and I was like WTH... Their miscommunication led to my cancellation and now they accused me of wrongdoings. ""Never order food from us, never never order food from us, conversation ends!'' They don't even listen to me and said things very rude. Fine, I will never order from them.",

They've been around for 20 years (first in TriBeCa and now in Harlem)Good comfort food, unique shakes (try the strawberry shake which comes in a Mason jar) and hearty omelettes I tried the Turkey sausage Omelet with a salad.  A little bit pricey but they pay a living wage which makes it easier to pay the higher prices for me.The servers are friendly and seem happy.A wee bit loud at times.

9,,11/17/2017,6,,"Sacramento, CA",Molly L.,314,2.0,214,"I was a bit disappointed for the amount I paid and the quality of the food. A friend and I met here for brunch on a Wednesday morning because the other place she had suggested was not yet open. We went in, and the decor is nice and homey. Unfortunately though, the plate I got, the honey sriracha chicken and biscuit was overpriced yet the chicken was dry and really not appetizing at all. The ""honey sriracha"" came in a bottle and it tasted more like Tapatio... Also, the chicken crushed my biscuit, so by the time that I decided to give up on the chicken part of my meal, the biscuit was already drenched in the chicken oil and not really good to eat. The potatoes were also quiet bland and who knows if there was even any seasoning on them. I guess I had high expectations, but in the end, I wish I had just gotten the eggs and biscuit, since you can't go wrong with that. My friend got that and also ended up paying much less. The service was a bit mediocre, since our water was refilled only once. The only bonus to this place is that you get 10% off if you pay in cash. I don't usually have cash, but my friend did and so we did end up getting that. If I did come here again, I would definitely stay away from the honey sriracha chicken biscuit.",1

13,,9/2/2018,578,,"New York, NY",Alyssa W.,5,4.0,19,"Kitchenette is a super cozy, home-y breakfast/brunch option north of Columbia's campus. I've been here about 3-4 times, and each time the food has been great, but the service isn't anything to write home about. In terms of weekend brunch, its main attraction is the fact that you rarely have to wait for a table and the food is consistently good.Downside of Kitchenette is probably the price point -- unless you're just getting eggs without any of the sides (and how could you say no to their breakfast potatoes?!), the total is usually around $20, which feels a bit steep for breakfast staples. Finally, and this is absurdly nitpicky, but they only have apricot jam available for their biscuits. Apricot jam haters, beware!",

Updated review",0,,"San Jose, CA",Sharon S.,5,3.0,119,"This is a place I'd like to give 3.5...it's better than 3 but not quite 4 stars to me. I've eaten here about 6-7 times when visiting my daughter, who attends  college two blocks away. The breakfast and lunch menus are decent and consistent. The staff, while not super friendly, get the job done and they know the menu well enough to make recommendations. They do their best with special orders or substitutions.  They're always busy, and can make some mistakes with orders (it can be so noisy they don't hear exactly what was ordered if it's at all different from the usual). But...breakfasts are well made. I like their egg, bacon or sausage, toast (the biscuits are popular), and choice of a side option. I've had  the potatoes, the grits, and once I think I had a salad. They don't poach eggs btw. The biscuits are good but they taste as if they're made fresh in the early morning. Biscuits don't rest well--they should be served fresh, or at least warmed. The special pancakes are good, with the compote or jam changing seasonally (peach rhubarb, strawberry, strawberry rhubarb, etc). People rave about the strawberry butter, but the jams are really delicious and I prefer them to the strawberry butter. Their baked goods are a big seller. Many of the cakes have a really wonderful house / homemade flavor and texture.",
15,,7/22/2017,40,,"Bronx, Bronx, NY",Rolanda B.,299,4.0,139,"My first time having kitchenette was at its downtown location and I loved it -the sausage was out of this world and the biscuits were amazing. So naturally, when they opened up another location in Harlem, I was excited because it was closer to me. I remember going back each time and thoroughly enjoying the company of my friends and he food.Today the service was great but I was a little disappointed as the food was not as good as I remembered. Maybe it was being away so long,and the nostalgia that made me build up the taste in my head. But the sausage I once loved was dry, the biscuits were just ok, and the cheese grits were on the bland side. I also had a mochaccino and that was just alright. Overall the food was good, and so was the service, considering that we were eating brunch on a Saturday at about 2:30 pm. But I just wasn't as blown away as I have been in the past.",2

Met a friend here for brunch on a weekend and thankfully there was no wait. I was impressed with the huge menu. I ordered the spinach tomato and feta omelette, it came with home fries but no biscuit, though that was listed on the menu. The omelette was...serviceable. Not particularly hot or fresh or tasty. The home fris were bad. Just bad. They had onions and peppers mixed in but also some spices and it was trying just too hard and failing. I barely touched my food, wouldn't recommend",1

Decadent pastries, eye-opening breakfasts and creative fare all around, delivering comfort and full tummies all along Harlem/Morningside Heights locale.Outfitted with mis-matched, I'm assuming, second hand tables and chairs, this establishment though low on decor rates high in delicious plates. From coffee and chocolate cake to pink lemonade and chicken pot pie, there's something for everyone here.The wait staff always seems young and hip and eager to help, often earning a nice tip from me.So if ever you're in the neighborhood, I definitely recommend stopping in for a treat to remember!",
19,,6/27/2018,82,,"Manhattan, NY",Lynn L.,75,3.0,153,"First time here, came to meet a friend for lunch who was doing some workshops at Colombia. Small and cozy place with an extended menu of breakfast and lunch items. I got seated right away and my friend (who is vegan) came soon after. It was difficult to decide what to have, between all the items on the menu. I finally decided on pulled chicken with yukon hashbrowns with green enchilada sauce. The portion was good, the hashbrowns were not as I imagined. they were just large chunks of potato not ""hashbrowns"" which I imagined to be shredded or grated potato and was looking for that ""crunch."" Disappointing. The flavor of the dish was also just okay. I was full but nothing to brag about. I also got a small banana cream pie, good, WAY too much fresh whipped cream, it made the pie very greasy and i LOVE banana cream pie. I had to scoop most of it off to finish the small pie. They have vegan options, which is a plus. Didn't have super big expectations but the hashbrowns really were a let down. Lunch was also quite expensive, my dish was $16 and the pie was $6 (or $8?). just left me with a ""meh"" feeling.",

I got my omelet with the side of a salad but the salad was plain. I didn't like the dressing that it came with. However, the biscuit was good. The prices are pretty high for the quality of food that you get here.",
21,1,11/27/2017,209,,"New York, NY",Allison C.,449,3.0,1624,"I did want to like this place more. It's cozy. It's homey. It's comfortable. The staff is wonderful! But, despite being delicious, it's a little harsh on the wallet if enjoyed too often. I've been there for dinner with friends (and their mothers!) in the past. The menu is fantastically extensive, and it is definitely hard to pick one item easily! I've gone with the grilled burger with the oven-roasted garlic fries on many occasions - it's easy, haha - and it's been tasty; it's unfortunately one of those burgers were the bun is so small compared to the size of the patty and its toppings, so the bun disappears a little too quickly. The KMC (mac & cheese) is  delectable - you can't go wrong with four cheeses - and the buttermilk fried chicken is very on point! The mashed potatoes? WOW! It'd get a bucket of those alone! I say, from the pit of my gut, that perhaps it is the price points on the menu that turn me off from being a more regular customer. I mean, it is what it is. It's New York City. Ha! But with loaded salads starting at $17, burgers at $16, and even a BLT at $14.50, I'm a little more inclined to get items like those elsewhere in the neighborhood; my favorite UWS diner has a BLT & fries for $6, for example. I'll absolutely be back to Kitchenette, as there are more things I need to try on the menu, but I'll be more likely to go if someone is treating me, at least until my student loans are paid off in full. Haha.",

I have not gotten sick but there are better choices around the block.I've been here twice after living here for a year and I still remember being unsatisfied with the food I have gotten. The turkey burger smelled super weird and up to this day I can still smell it in my head. I didn't even take photos of it. I have also had the tofu scramble and it was nothing special. The portions are so huge I can have them for a week - maybe a lot of people like this. I can order a plate and share with three other friends - not very healthy to go by yourself.",2

What's not cool is the poor service. I've been twice in the past 10 days. I tried to overlook it the first time. The wait for a bowl of Mac and cheese was so long, we had to go look for the waitress (and she was not easy to find). There were two other patrons in the restaurant at the time. And then I went back to grab take out the other day. 3-4 servers were hanging out by the front counter, buried in their cell phones. I simply wanted a biscuit. No butter. No jam. Not toasted. Just a whole biscuit to go. The wait would have been laughable if it wasn't so frustrating. And worse, was watching them chill on their phones knowing all someone needed to do was put a biscuit in a bag. Again, the restaurant was next to empty. And yet.....Not good, Kitchenette. Oh, and I forgot the misdirected cake! The first time, we asked about a cake up front. We bought a slice to go, trusting the waitress knew what she was talking about. We got home and the flavor was completely wrong. Yummy, yes. But know your product or ask someone who knows. Don't just make stuff up! Again, not good, Kitchenette.",

30,,1/2/2017,128,,"New York, NY",Paul S.,1561,3.0,88,"This is the classic diner go-to in Morningside Heights. If you can get past the cons of noise and service, you will be in breakfast nirvana.For the pros and cons, the pros are their décor and polka dot theme palace of kitsch. There is also a good variety of tasty of menu items from savory to sweet. For their cons, I would steer clear of this place during peak times because they really do like to pack in the tables. When we dined on a weekend morning in early December, there was a large group that departed and then the wait staff moved the tables and chairs around so loudly it was almost intentionally loud as they dragged tables and chairs around the room.For the food, we ordered a few of their items. The Blackberry cherry pancakes for $15.00  was a-ok. The fruit was not as fresh as I would have liked it.  The Sweet Potato Waffles with toasted pumpkin, dried cranberries dolloped with cranberry butter for $14.50 was goodl. The waffle was tasty with the flavorful cranberry butter. The Kitchenette Breakfast Sandwich with two eggs, bacon, cheese, on a biscuit for $13.00 is the classic option which definitely worth order. The price is still pretty steep for uptown. I had a bottomless cup of coffee for $3.25 which was pretty good with my meal.FYI, there was a sign for Columbia University student or staff to received 10% off of their meals.  They also prefer that you pay in cash and you can get 10% off your bill for paying in cash.For the service, our server was efficient but I definitely did feel rushed. This place thrives on quick turn over their tables so if the loud room does makes you want to leave. The server will remove your plate as soon as you finish your last bite.As a solid uptown  breakfast option, I will be back again but I will try to arrive early next time.",2

I came here for brunch during the week so was able to get the $12 special that includes coffee/tea, grapefruit/orange juice, and one of the breakfast plates (ranges from eggs, to biscuits and gravy, to a fruit cup). I got the farmers plate which came with scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, and a homemade biscuit. The biscuit was a tad dry and I didn't really like the hashbrowns. Despite giving off the appearance that they were well seasoned they tasted bland and were just too thick of a cut for my tastes. The eggs were nice and fluffy though! While this special is a good deal, I don't think I would come back here again because a lot of their other options are overpriced, especially on the weekends/if you choose something outside of the $12 special.",1

We ordered eggplant parmesan (yum!) and something called ""supper bowl"" consisting of smashed yellow lentils, charred broccoli, sautéed greens and chopped scallions. You can add-on, so I chose grilled tofu. This was one of the most flavorful vegetarian dishes I have ever had. In fact, everything on the menu has a comfort food quality about it: very homemade tasting, delicious and served up in generous portions. It's also hard to resist the desserts as you must walk past a display of no less than five different house-made cakes (each more tempting than the next), cupcakes and many other goodies on route to your table. Oh, and killer strawberry shortcake!!!The interior has not changed at all in the 16 years that I've known this place. It does have a certain completely unpretentious charm...but seeing a new look someday might be nice, though really not necessary. There is something else to keep in mind: Kitchenette is a small restaurant in Manhattan, not some small town in Vermont, and it's near a major university. The food is excellent and inexpensive, so of course it is going to be crowed, noisy and slow during peak hours. How could it be otherwise?! If you can get there at off hours there is never a wait, and the noise level is no problem. In our experience we have never had anything but friendly and efficient service.

Service was adequate - my waitress was friendly and attentive, but both the food and check took a while to come out. I ordered the Farmhouse Breakfast which consisted of a house-baked buttermilk biscuit, two homemade turkey sausage patties, two scrambled eggs, and cheesy grits. The turkey sausage patties were plump and the best I've ever had - flavorful, hearty, and not too salty. I am normally a fan of oatmeal over grits, but with the cheese melted perfectly, these grits were so creamy and comforting. The biscuit was crispy outside and moist inside, and the scrambled eggs were fluffy.The whole meal cost $15 which was a bit steep, but the quality almost justified it and it is New York after all. I recommend Kitchenette for a delicious, nourishing brunch in Uptown.",1

I am a little bit of an introverted recluse and socially awkward when I'm by myself, so I hate eating alone because I feel like there's a HUGE spotlight on my table but I decided to step outside my comfort zone and asked for a table for one. The hostess was very nice and showed me to a small two-top, against the wall.After just enough time to peruse the menu and decide on my entrée and beverage, my server approached and took my order. I asked for the Farmhouse Breakfast which comes with two eggs, bacon or turkey sausage and a biscuit. She also asked if I wanted other sides but I figured it would be more than enough. I opted for the sausage and asked for a Mochaccino because someone posted a pic of one and it looked fantastic. The biscuits are huge and served warm with jam and a sweet butter. I asked for cheese on my eggs which was left off but they made sure to not charge me and it was no harm, no foul. My server was attentive and offered condiments for my meal and checked up on me to make sure I was enjoying myself. Although I felt a bit awkward, I also felt taken care of and at ease. The service was definitely on point, the place is quaint and charming, a little small but the set up it totes, cute! Even the bathroom was some sort of vintage, quirky hodgepodge of eclectic decor. I would definitely make another visit. They have a great menu selection and offer fall-inspired entrées. They also offer alcohol so, it's a full-service spot.",8

It was one of my faves when I attended teachers college just a few blocks away. I had to attend a workshop just a few weeks ago and I was very excited it would be in my alma matter. I immediately thought of Kitchennette Uptown for lunch! It was a very cold day and chicken noodle soup was an absolutely perfect meal for lunch. I also had a mini pumpkin cupcake with an almond milk caramel cappucino. It was the perfect lunch and made me nostalgic of some beautiful memories shared with special friends.

Huge disappointment. Then the waitress pressured me in ordering the apple cobbler waffles. They looked really sad. The apple compote looked like someone pooped on my plate. After drowning it in maple syrup it wasn't too bad. But I have to say THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!ITS SUNDAY MORNING PEOPLE!!! WHAT WOULD IT COST YOU TO SMILE AND HAVE A POSITIVE ENERGY! Damnnn talk about a shitty attitude!If you don't want to see grumpy people on a Sunday DO NOT COME HERE!

65,,9/19/2017,205,,"Manhattan, NY",Kasha J.,29,3.0,23,THIS REVIEW IS A REFLECTION OF MY DELIVERY EXPERIENCE.I was very disappointed that my food arrived an entire 30 minutes after the delivery window. 11:00 - 11:30 am turned into 12pm. I even fell asleep waiting on the food. The flavor and seasoning of the food was great and that butter was truly a great compliment for the waffle. But my food was so cold that my waffle was a little hardened and it made it much less pleasant to eat. This place is less than a quarter mile from me (0.4) to be exact so why a simple chicken and waffle order took so long??? I don't know ‍ If you live further than I from them well good luck to you. The restaurant should also indicate that their iced tea is unsweetened. They don't send sugar packets or alternative sweeteners so if unsweetened tea isn't your cup of tea... literally lol.... you will be disappointed. Fortunately I had my own sweetener. I will say that if I likely dined in at this place I'm sure I'll be far more pleased.,1

67,,5/31/2015,197,,"Brooklyn, NY",Fazeela S.,348,4.0,338,"Alert: Awesome homemade petite Key Lime Pie with excellent tart to creamy ratio. I was pleased to have stumbled into Kitchenette Uptown yesterday - to the tunes of ""Lollipop"", 1950s vintage decor and staff that welcomed with ""Hi honey what can we get for you?"" I had a very different experience than many other reviewers. (Note: After a quick glance at the menu I would NEVER think to order food here. This is a throwback 1950's-esque dessert shop. You can quickly glean this by viewing the freshly baked cakes and pies on display.)The service was superb. I mean a bit over the top in a good way. Everyone was interested in providing us good service. They underscored that all bakery goods were baked fresh daily and the iced tea and lemonade were also freshly brewed. I was feeling light-headed and ordered a peach iced tea (unsweeteened). It was really good! There was fresh peach purée mixed in (nothing artificial). My spouse ordered a vanilla milkshake and sucked it clean in minutes so I didn't even get a chance to try it!!!!The show stopper? The freshly made Key Lime Pie. I am a bit of a key lime pie connoisseur. It's my all-time favorite dessert.  It's always supreme in Florida - especially at Blond Giraffe in Key West - but when life prohibits me from traveling down there I seek alternatives. The pie was small so it was perfect for 2-3 people to share and not engorge. The ratio of tart to creamy was perfect (as opposed to Steve's in Red Hook which has a terrible ratio - overly tart. I have no clue why folks like their key lime). We ate it slowly - licking our spoonfuls in order to savor the flavor. I will be back for the Key Lime.",1

This time however, the grits were a bit watery, the delicious turkey sausage was super dry, the eggs were okay, and the biscuit was dry as well. My boyfriend's  potatoes were under done and over seasoned. Additionally, our waiter came with our coffee and just said grounds...indicating that he noticed there were grounds in the coffee and yet left us with the coffee, ground and all. Thankfully someone brought out our food and we had asked for new coffees, though there were still some ground left in our new cups. Did management change? It was so good before?

I don't even wanna know how this is possible. The scrambled eggs were bare-bones eggs. No salt, no butter. Incredible. An absolute beginner in the kitchen will do a better job. The food was so tasteless that it was hard to finish. We also had two coffees and orange juices. $5 per glass - better be good, but they were bitter. The food by itself was a disappointment.

Updated review",15,,"Atlanta, GA",Lillian H.,1,4.0,1,"Decided to give this place a second chance, and I'm very happy I did!  This time, I went on a weekday morning before 10am and took advantage of their ""10 before 10"" special - select meals come with coffee or tea and orange or grapefruit juice for $10.  Like last time, I ordered the Farmhouse Platter with over-easy eggs and cheesy grits. But unlike last time, the eggs were warm, the biscuit was halved and toasted (which actually made all the difference) and the coffee was rich and flavorful.  On top of that, the service was fantastic!  Glad I gave it another go.Also, if you pay with cash you get a 10% discount.  More money to tip your server! ;)",1

With it being small with as many tables/chairs as possible, it can get quite noisy when it gets packed The servers are mostly friendly and cheerful, the service here is ok. Food here is good but not too special.",

100,,1/13/2015,3,,"Manhattan, NY",So Yoon A.,145,4.0,25,"Had a farmhouse breakfast. It consists of eggs (you can choose either scramble or fried, I chose fried ones), bacon, biscuits, and cheese grits (or you can choose potatoes). I'm living near hear so I've come here since 2013 and I feel like the quality varies across menus. But I think farmhouse breakfast is a good choice every time.Cheese grit is nice and warm biscuit with apricot jam and butter is delicious. Bacon is a bit salty but that's minor. I didn't have hot chocolate today but peppermint hot chocolate with marshmallow is also a nice choice. This place is very crowded on weekends morning but other than those days, it's not bad. Also, i think for this place, brunch is better than dinner menu.",3
101,,6/27/2017,1,,"Manhattan, NY",Cristine L.,0,1.0,5,"This seemed like such a cute place, and was looking forward to having brunch with my guest, but alas, it was quite disappointing. For starters, our meals came before the coffee, despite asking about the coffee, and being told (politely) that they were busy. However, when the latte did get there, it was cold, and tasted as if it had been sitting out, as did my eggs and buttermilk biscuit, which was the least flavorful biscuit I had ever eaten...for $20, I could have stayed home, brewed a nice hot latte and made eggs and Bisquick, which am sorry to say, would have been a much more tasty meal.",2

Updated review",113,,"Monroe, NY",M Y.,106,3.0,80,"This was probably the worst experience I have had in this place. The service was terrible from the waitress Errica (i think that was her name). She was just miserable and just not friendly at all. She served us with an attitude that seemed as if we were disturbing her. I got the strawberry shortcake smootie and it was good until i found some plastic in the drink. Asked her to return it and she seemed puzzled. She was nasty about giving me a second straw, as we had two people at the table. The food was fantastic, I had the Shepard pie. If it were not for the chef, I would have rated this with a one. Be mindful, probably better to avoid her table.",1

It took a full 20 minutes to order and we arrived to a less than half full restaurant before 09:30 in the morning. After asking about ordering twice, we finally got someone to take ours. And the restaurant did not appear shorthanded, in fact there seemed to be plenty of staff just none we were able to summon to our table.I ordered the herb and goat cheese omelet with a biscuit (12.50) and breakfast potatoes on the side. The omelet had a bit too much dill for me to properly enjoy and the biscuit lacked the fluffy quality I look for in such baked goods.  I ended up leaving at least half my meal behind (despite arriving quite hungry), including the potatoes and I've rarely met a potato I didn't like.

111,,8/12/2014,145,,"Las Vegas, NV",Steve C.,159,1.0,59,"Not impressed at all.  This place needs a serious education in customer service and order taking.  We ordered two meals for lunch over the phone.  The fried chicken meal and a breakfast sandwich with crispy bacon on the side.  When it finally arrived the chicken was laughable.  Two tiny half burnt pieces which were bite sized all for only $14... Instead of the bacon being crispy and on the side like request the kitchen decided to under cook it and put it directly on the sandwich.  Now this is a forgivable mistake, but when we called to get it corrected the manager, ""Eve"" informed us that it was our fault.  I wish I were making this up. The sad part is that Kitchenette use to not be like this.  We've been coming here for years and the management and the food use to be a lot better.  It's a real shame, but I just realized there are hundreds of places to take their spot, so I'll be alright :)",11

Very generous portions and a welcoming staff.,

117,,4/27/2014,31,20,"New York, NY",Steve A.,17,1.0,60,"Am I hip enough to eat at Kitchenette? Apparently not.  There was a 30 minute wait, but I spotted some counter space and sat right down.  Note that hip crowds go to the right spots with lines, not always the best choices.On to my experience. Their first strike was bitter diner coffee, $3.25, with a brutal aftertaste. It's the emperor's new coffee. Hey everyone, you're drinking swill. It's okay to speak up. I stayed positive and navigated the menu.  Stacked Blueberry French Toast topped with blueberries sounded great and was wholeheartedly endorsed by the waitress. At $15, I expected it to be spectacular.  So 35 minutes later two slices of this French toast is put on the counter with a generous mound of blueberry compote between the bread and was garnished with 8 fresh blueberries.  I wouldn't print ""topped with fresh blueberries"", on a menu when the berries are merely a decoration. The bread was dry, as if this chilly afternoon was too cold for bread to dive into French toast batter.Hats off to a very cheerful staff but here's a suggestion, don't ask me ""How is everything?"" if you don't give a damn.  I gave the waitress my feedback and she must not have heard me the first 3 times I explained why the $15 french toast failed. I need Validation. You know some kind of feedback that I didn't miss something and this hip place really does have average food with high prices. Otherwise I'll probably be sucked in and give Kitchenette a second chance to sell me something good.",17

She said that kitchenette is a super cute spot and offers a bunch of breakfast and dinner options so we decided to try it out.When we got there, there was only one table seated. So we sat and waited to be serviced. We waited 10 minutes and finally someone came to get us water and asked if we were ready to order. We ordered and the waitress came back and told us she gave us the wrong menu, and we had to look over it again. I ended up getting the wings and kale salad appetizer. The salad was okay, and the wings were alright but it wasn't the best marinade I've tasted. I've had better wings at other spots but I guess you shouldn't expect much since kitchenette is known for their breakfasts...Overall - would recommend if you're not too picky and are craving some eggs and bacon. They do have a solid breakfast menu and it seems good but I don't think I'll have a chance to try it.",

Considering it's just breakfast food, I found the prices really expensive. Don't get me wrong, the gingerbread pancakes were very good and nothing like I've necessarily tried before.

The mashed potatoes were delicious. The meal looked huge and I thought for sure that I would be taking some of it home, but I surprised myself in finishing my plate clean. It was so good. I had to finish a perfect meal with dessert, so I ordered a piece of chocolate layered cake.

135,,5/9/2016,2,2,"Bronx, NY",Bronx B.,17,3.0,61,"The word ""quaint"" comes to mind when I think of this place.  I came here with a total party of 4 for Mother's Day 2016.  The first thing that I took notice of was that this is another Manhattan restaurant trying to take advantage of every little space.  This place is small, maybe too small.  As I was walking to my table I felt like my ass was in someone's eggs.  Also the tables were pushed together.  Not even a ruler width space to spare.  I thought people were eating together until I saw that a couple against the wall were done with their meal and the couple sitting in the aisle area had to get up so that wall couple can get out.  You know, like when you have to go to the bathroom on the airplane and if the person has common sense, the aisle person stands up so the other person can pass through.  So if you are a size 14 and up, you might have trouble getting around and being comfortable.A minor thing that bothered me was the chairs.  I felt like a elephant sitting on a wood chair.  It was not stable, and it distracted me a bit because I felt like I had to keep adjusting myself with the wobbly chair and clearing myself out of the super narrow aisle. So the food, it was good.  Not terrible but good.  My husband and sister ordered the French toast and they liked that fact that it came out hot.  I ordered the plain pancakes made with a four grain batter.  I have discovered that I just like buttermilk pancakes but I would not discourage anyone from trying them out.  I ordered my toddler daughter the farmhouse breakfast that consisted of two scrambled eggs and a buttermilk biscuit ($11.00!!!).  This was the best dish because that biscuit was delicious and so big, we split it into four to share.  We all had to order extra sides of bacon (which was delicious) for everybody because none of the dishes comes with any meat and I hated that.  My sister tells me that I am too used to IHOP.  I am trying to expand my food horizons here its getting too expensive to do so.  At least our server was friendly (I never caught her name-dang it) and aside from the wet floor, the bathrooms were clean.  Thank goodness.  I don't think I can take another nasty restaurant bathroom.Another note: they had buy one, get one mimosas or bloody marys for people who care about that kind of thing.  Again, nothing to go wild about.  I didn't try anything from their bakery because we had no more money after brunch.In one word this place is mediocre and expensive.  I want to like this place because it is so cute.  The décor is what sets it apart from everyone else but the food does not justify the price nor the cramped space to eat it in.Additional Note:  Since we paid in cash, we got 10% off our bill.  We still had no money leftover for cupcakes.",2

After reading a few mixed reviews on Yelp, I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to order. Most of the complaints seemed to either refer to the service in the restaurant or the portion sizes. And for $20, I wasn't sure the macchiato and omelette would be worth it. The delivery was ahead of schedule, which was wonderful because I was starving when I placed the order. Because of some Yelp reviews I was on the lookout for poor service, but he arrived with a smile on his face and kindly pointed out that I had entered the wrong address, which he corrected without a complaint. The portion looked somewhat small, but I could only get through 2/3 of it before I was completely full, and like I said, I was really hungry. The omelette was perfect quality for the price- plenty of cheese and great taste. The bread was soggy, which wasn't great, but what else could I expect from a delivery? The part that really got me was the macchiato. So, so good. I'd even go so far as to say I'd order this over the Starbucks version any day. All in all I'd recommend this place to a friend looking for a good omelette and coffee if they can spare the price. Looking forward to ordering again!",

These were divine. They were served with strawberry butter (OMG) and a marmalade on the side. The two omelettes were ordered were well prepared - one was a herb and goat cheese, the other was a create-your-own (we chose mushrooms, spinach, and a sundried tomato paste).  I would have preferred the tomato paste to be IN the omelette rather than on top of it, but other than that, it was fine. The decor is cute, the service was good. Nothing amazing, but the food was decent and not TOO pricey.

I came with family. My mother ordered a muffin, which she thought was alright. However, the real nightmare began when my father noticed that there was a lipstick stain on his cup. It was not small, but rather a full lipstick stain. The staff was polite, and they offered to make our food free, including food we had not yet received such as the chicken and waffles I ordered. The staff also said that we were not given a dirty dish, rather that the dishwasher was not always able to remove lipstick stains. I do not think that is excusable, but if you're okay with that, you should come to this restaurant. I was so disgusted that I turned down almost $20 worth of free food. It was nice of the staff to at least offer us free food, which is why I am giving two stars.",1

However, after ordering two unsatisfactory desserts - a brownie sundae and a banana split - we thought it best to forewarn future customers of overpriced items for decent food and, more importantly,  poor customer service. Both desserts arrived unsatisfactory and when we called to address our concerns the Kitchenette representative we spoke with justified the poor quality of the desserts. In short, as of January 27, 2015, Kitchenette is not worth the hassle. There are far better dining experiences on the Upper West Side and Harlem.

Even though it was quite busy, me and my partner were seated right away and our waitress quickly assisted us. I got the Kitchenettes Special which had Cheddar Cheese, Bacon and sunny side eggs in a homemade bisquit with strawberry butter. Sided with homemade fries & peach marmalade. The peach marmalade with fries were sooooo delicious! Now the thing that I rave about when it comes to this spot is that everything is homemade!! How awesome is that?

My mom came to visit me in NYC. Before her leaving, I brought her to Kitchenette in hope that she would get another good experience. Somehow we were forgotten intentionally by the waitress. She used to be very nice. But last time she asked people around us if they needed some things or if everything was good several times while ignored us totally. She did not talk with us at all until we left. My mom was not familiar with eating with forks and knives. Not sure if this offended her. This ignorance made my mom so embarrassed. Wanted to give one star. But there might be some misunderstanding. Anyway, very bad experience.",2

This place has a really cute bakery type of decor it seems like the perfect place to a grown up tea parties with muffins. Full disclosure I am not a ""normal"" breakfast type of person which is probably why this place just didn't really appeal so much to me. I got the chipotle turkey hash and it was okay but nothing great in my opinion. The whole thing was just very underwhelming and nothing in my plate stood out as being particularly tasty or something that I would want to eat again. My friend's breakfast came with some type of sausage thing and I tried it and was really not impressed. I was told by my friend that the bread was pretty good but I didn't even bother to try it since my biscuit wasn't that impressive. Even the bacon was disappointing since it was far from crispy.

When we arrived after making a reservation, we were seated right away but then were not spoken to for at least 15 minutes. Servers came and went right past us, and even served food OVER us to the people sitting next to us. Then when we ordered, our order came after about 20 minutes and mine was wrong. What is the option when that happens? I'm supposed to order something else and wait while my husband finishes his meal? We didn't have all day to be at brunch. The manager gave the ""we're really busy"" excuse which just about any place in New York City has on a Sunday morning. I get that places get crazy busy, but the whole experience was just disappointing. They really need help with their service. So...even though they gave us a $10 gift certificate (which wouldn't cover most items on the menu) and said they'd be sure to take care of us the next time we come in, we definitely won't be back.

The food is always amazing, and the service is usually great even when they are crazy busy...until we were served by Estefania.We sat at our table for over 20 minutes before she came to our table. Once she did, she took a simple drink order (water and two regular coffees) and our food order. After over 10 mins, she came back to our table and asked for our drink order again as if she never came the first time. She never once returned to see if we needed a refill, and after running a half marathon, this was more of an issue than usual.  Once the food order came out, for the first time ever, it was incorrect and items were missing. Her lack of concern during the initial order was the root cause. I asked for the additional items when she passed by our table not once, but three times before she remembered to bring it. I could not even get syrup for my pancakes which should be an obvious side for such an order (at least it has always been during past visits). As we sat at our table trying to salvage what was left of our brunch, she sat perched against a wall laughing and carrying on instead of checking in on our table. Finally another server was nice enough to bring us refills for our water. Servers have bad days, and I understand that. However, she did not seem to care at all.

The strawberry lemonade is served in a mason jar and is as beautiful to look at as it is refreshing to drink.The first time I came here on my lunch break with a coworker. After hearing how long the chicken would take decided to get the BLT to go. After giving us a mini scolding about to go orders waiting on the other side I heard this very unpleasant woman (I am assuming was the owner/ manger) then proceed to tell our server (a very pleasant young man) not to seat people ordering to go. The problem was that she was the one who seated us and we were originally going to eat in however the food was going to take way too long for us to eat in and make it back to work on time. This experience makes me believe that all the reviews stating they experienced bad customer service are true and that nightmare of an owner was to blame. As good as my BLT was I do not think I would go back.",2
189,,6/3/2014,94,1,"Long Beach, CA",Eric R.,19,3.0,412,Unique menu items that could earn 4 stars for sure. I have been here a couple of times and the service was much better the first time around.Our menu waiter was definitely overloaded with tables and the front lady who looked like the manager was too good to refill my girlfriends coffee. Hey help out your staff when help is needed. Hate when managers are too good to get into the trenches.,4

Do you feel that all hope is lost while writing your thesis and need some comfort food?Then order the Mac 'n Cheese BLT from here. I will not divulge how many I have eaten during these desperate times, but man are they delicious. The vegetables are fresh, the bacon is crisp, and the mac 'n cheese somehow miraculously stays encased in the buttery bread. I'm not usually a fan of wedge fries, but I love the ones from Kitchenette. While I love this signature dish, I have to admit my experiences with ordering breakfast here have been average. I love their biscuits, but the eggs and bacon didn't ""wow"" me considering the price. However, the service here is always friendly and the atmosphere definitely adds to the charm of this place.If this place wasn't so costly, I would go more often. But again, I definitely can't stay away from that Mac 'n Cheese BLT...",1
191,,7/11/2016,0,,"Manhattan, NY",Raymond C.,0,4.0,3,Nice lil hole in the wall dinner. Didn't have mimosas so I had the sangria but the sangria was strong. The food was good just want I wanted.,
192,,4/23/2011,348,,"Fort Lee, NJ",Juliette J.,502,4.0,397,"Hungover and starving, we headed over to Kitchenette for a sweet and savory brunch fix. Clearly everyone had the same idea as there was a line snaking out the door. Luckily there was seating at the counter, so we opted to ditch the 15 minute wait time and get our grub on asap.  I ordered the herb and goat cheese omelet with potatoes and a biscuit. I had a moment when I bit into my omelet. Muy delicioso. The red potatoes were perfectly seasoned, however the biscuit left much to be desired. The texture and weight was akin to a muffin.  It way too heavy and dry. It was somewhat tasty with the strawberry butter spread, but I felt like I was eating a giant cracker instead of a warm, moist and fluffy buttermilk biscuit.  As part of my never ending quest to find a red velvet cupcake better than Zoe's, I ordered one to go. The cream cheese frosting was super delish, however the cake was heavy and a tad bit dry.  Seems like baking isn't their strong point. Regardless, I had a pleasant experience overall.",
193,,4/26/2014,0,,"Flushing, NY",Samantha V.,0,1.0,1,"Me and my boyfriend went in there starving and hoping to get a good meal. We saw that it had great reviews so we decided to give it a chance. The first thing we ordered was coffee. It came out tasting burnt, and had a disgusting aftertaste. Disappointed, we ordered our meals hoping it would taste better. I ordered mixed berry pancakes and a side order of eggs. When I bit into it, the pancakes tasted bitter because the fruit wasn't ripe and the eggs tasted bland. The food had no flavor at all and unless I drowned the pancakes in syrup, it tasted terrible. Unfortunately for me, I am not a fan of syrup so I took two bites and left the rest there. My boyfriend got the lumberjack. He agreed that the coffee was disgusting and that the pancakes were tasteless. On the bright side, at least the bacon was good. We left kitchenette $40 poorer, still starving, and now upset that we had paid for food that did not satisfy us. I wouldn't go there again.",6
194,,5/9/2016,3,,"3ème, Paris, France",Olga W.,0,5.0,3,Really cute place!! The coffee latte is good and the food is delicious. It tastes like homemade. We had breakfast there the other day which filled us up for the entire day.,
195,,3/29/2014,290,1,"Manhattan, NY",Daniel S.,0,1.0,8,"Both of our breakfast biscuit sandwiches came out cold. Returned them. Came back warm, falling apart and half the original portion size. It looked very unappetizing. Returned one of them again and just sharedthe other one. $5 dollars for 4oz of grits?! They're just plain unseasoned grits with cold, refrigerated shredded cheese on top. Worth $1.50 at best. $15 dollars for creme brûlée French toast that had the sides of one of the pieces burnt crispy. Edible, but nothing special at all. Waiter did nothing to make our experience better. Not exaggerating when I say it was the worst restaurant experience in my 15 months in NYC.",9
196,,11/16/2014,305,,"Brooklyn, NY",Paris T.,5,4.0,19,"By far one of my favorite brunch spots especially for comfort food. The portions are a great size and good for sharing. Sometimes it can be a long wait but it's definitely worth it. Also, the servers are all pleasant. Can't beat service with a smile.",1

198,,6/26/2014,138,2,"Downtown, Boston, MA",Laurielle H.,69,5.0,38,"Came here on a whim to avoid the long wait at nearby brunch places. I made a reservation and got seated right away despite the place being packed. the waitress was very friendly and even accommodated us when we asked to move to another table because ours was too low and my friends couldn't sit comfortably. The menu is very expansive with a ton of delicious options. I think i ended up going with the Lumber Jane with mixed berry pancakes. While i thought the menu was pricey at first, when I got my food I realized it was totally worth it. A perfectly sized portion combined with delicious tasting food made this a great yelp experience. The pancakes are well sized and the amount of bacon they give you is amazing.  I am definitely going back again!",1
199,,1/27/2015,5,,"Manhattan, NY",S.X. A.,0,3.0,104,"My boyfriend and I used to come here all the time in 2011 and 2012.  It's changed so much! Kitchenette used to have a local, community feel - now it's consumed by brunchers and redefining itself as a hotspot for weekenders seeking expensive pancakes. It's nice to see a local spot get successful, but I'm sorry to see what it's done to the place.  I think it's too expensive now, especially for food that anyone can make quickly and easily at home.  We went recently and spent $50 on breakfast for two, with no alcohol.That said, it's worth going to Kitchenette if you want a hearty breakfast or dinner with some tasty Southern treats. Fantastic milkshakes and desserts! Service ranges from warm and friendly to aloof and incompetent.  Go early in the day or right before closing for the best experience.",
